"Had this beer some time ago entering it here just to catalog it. Oak flavor was way too strong and just plain tasted wierd to me. Have tried many Sam Adams beers but finding one I like is rare."

"This beer has such a smooth feel that is goes down easy even thought there is a bit of a punch that was not expected. A real jem from Boston Beer."

"Pours a nice red/auburn color with a semi-thick head. Nose leaves a bit to be desired, oak is notable, but little else is present. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and dries out toward the end. First sip is big malty oak, a little sweet for my taste. Reminiscent in some ways of a pumpkin ale. I tasted touches of vanilla and allspice, but malty oak still dominates the palate. Nothing offensive but nothing inspiring, either. Not a beer I’d go out of my way for."

"Beer is medium-bodied with medium-low intensity carbonation. The mouthfeel is never fizzy, though carbonation can be lightly felt as it slightly foams the beer upon palate contact. The result is a semi-foamy, semi-smooth mouthfeel that generally balances the weight and flavors well. Closes fairly dry, with ample stickiness left lingering on the palate."

"If you are looking for an oak aged beer, you will probably think you dont taste any oak at all."

"Notes: My impression went from ""Oh, cool, something called 'Mighty Oak'"" to ""Damn, this beer is really boring and I don't think that I will ever look for it again."""

"O: I love this beer, even more so out of a glass. Oak themed beers have a complex brewing process that has generous amounts of vanilla and caramel. Very nice blend of ingredients. Im pretty sure this is the last of this beer I will every have the pleasure of drinking, so im savoring the flavor."

"This beer got better for me as it went along. The mouthfeel was the best part. So smooth."
""
""
""
"Finish - Semi-dry, crisp, refreshing."
"Pours a clear amber body with nice head that laces lightly and lasts longer than expected. Caramel and sweetness in the nose with a hint of earthy hop lingering behind it. The body is very similar with light notes of the advertised oak aging, though this comes across as fresh raw oak. The oak works with the caramel notes in the beer, though the beer comes off a little watery for such an otherwise thick seeming beer. Finish is dry and otherwise clean. The beer almost seems as though they took Boston Lager and threw an untoasted oak spiral into the keg for a week..."

"3.1/5.00"
""
"This was an interesting experience. I'm glad that Boston Beer is experimenting, but this isn't really hitting it for me."
""
""
""
"O- a very different and interesting take on a red ale. It starts sweet, then moves into the oak taste which brings out a bit of the sourness. Overall different and something I'd like to see more of."
"Best damn beer i have tasted from the sam adams family of beers. refreshing, colorful, nice 1 finger off white head. wanted more of this beer than the 12 pack brew masters special offered. very sharp taste . equally as sharp after taste. not to bitter not to smoked tasting. quite perfectly infused in my opinion."
""
""
""
"This would be much nicer if there were a little more ""Mighty"" in the bottle. This brew just misses a bit. If the woodiness from the oak were a bit more pronounced it would have made for a much nicer brew. As it stands, this is a good, but not great brew. Samuel Adams generally comes through and this is no exception, but there is nothing terribly remarkable here."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Pretty good amber ale with the oak flavor adding some complexity. A bit off balanced though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"C-"
"A good session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Mighty Oak is a decent red. The oak flavor compliments the style very well."
""
"O- A good ale, definitely worth having, but lacks some of the complexity of other oak ales. I suspect that it hasn't been aged very long, but I'm not an expert so I can't be certain. Still, overall well done and well balanced."
"O: Wait, did a caterpillar really fall in my beer? Presumably no. Not something that you'll slosh out into a red cup and play beer pong with, this is interesting but nothing special."
"O= interesting offering; not quite in the elite craft status but an interesting and creative Samuel Adams level offering nonetheless."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. This beer has a nice reddish body with partially no head to it. The aroma is nice and malty. The taste is right up front with some oak and vanilla flavors. Then the little bit of sweetness on the back of the tongue is a nice touch. Great mouth feel and overall a really good, drinkable beer."
"A coppery amber with a decent off white head. Bits of lacing here and there and good retention. Mild carbonation visible. Smell is full of sweet malt with vanilla and cherries in the back. Oak wafts in and out. Love the big, smooth, amber ale malt taste with a longish wooden dryness. Bitterness is English tea leaf hoppiness with oak and cherry-vanilla notes. A mild sourness faintly lingering as the mild biscuity malt blooms. Crisp carbonation and medium light weight make for excellent drinkability. A creative twist on a standard that is not gimmicky or tricked out. This makes me think about what was available in the days of wooden casks. This may be a resurrection of the flavors of old. I wish this one was on the shelves year round. Nicely done Jim!"
""
"The oak comes through more in the flavor, but primarily this is just a solid red ale with something extra. This was my favorite beer from the sampler pack I bought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium dark reddish amber, good foaming, some residual. Sweet malty caramel smell. Strong vanilla smell, woody sweet taste with a smooth gradual finish. The beer trusts the oak to hold the sweetness in check rather than any hop. Finish has a lot of vanilla. Nice blend, good taste, perhaps a bit too sweet - can get cloying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a drinkable beer but definitely not on my rebuy list."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not very impressed with this one. This is just an ok red ale among many."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance holds a reddish amber that supports a thin dissipating head leaving fair lace. Smell is light on the nose with the caramel malt, oak and fruitiness from the hops. Taste of the malt, vanilla, with a good balance of hops leaving a lightly bitter dry oak finish. Mouthfeel is light on the medium side with good carbonation. Pretty much a simple amber leaving not much to mull over."
""
"O- A pretty average beer, not very complex. The bottle described the beer as having caramel, vanilla, and oak notes, but I could taste no oak or vanilla notes."
""
""
""
""
" The taste is slightly caramel with mild amaretto-like almond taste with a slight nuttiness and light cherry accent with the tannin and mild toasty malt follows. The yeasty flavor combines with the aforementioned flavors with a bready note and light oaky vanilla in the background as it finishes. Overall a good amber, a good amber w/ mild oak influence in the flavor. This is a middle of the road but I am sure the oak made this better than just the base alone, drinkability is on the low side for the style."
"Overall this is a fine ale that's worth seeking out."
""
""
"The Mightly Oak ale from Sammy A is a nice offering but not spectacular. It is ruby red with foamy white head that is lacing nicely. The smell is typical of most ambers....neat and malty. There is a slight woody/oak twang to the amber. The mouthfeel is medium body with big carbonation. Overall it is decent."
""
"O - A good everyday beer to drink if you into ales, one of my favorite Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
"overall a bit on the simple side, but i'm sure that's what SA was aiming for. pleasant enough."
"Overall: Interesting. Not spectacular, but a decent beer that's worth a shot."
"Overall: Maybe someone else can make a low abv oaked ale, because this is not really any better than a macro such as Michelob Amber Bock. Actually, I would rather have Amber Bock."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Another decent beer from the mix pack. Too bad Alpine Spring is the seasonal when Whitewater and Might Oak are better."

"Not a beer I'd have on a regular basis, but an interesting one off."
"Samuel Adams Mighty Oak Ale is a very clear amber ale with a thin white head that fades to a blotch and leaves decent lacing. It has a faint aroma of sweet caramel, vanilla and oak. It's medium bodied and starchy with a dry, scratchy finish. It tastes pretty sweet with loads of oak. There's a strong note of dark cherry, vanilla and caramel. There's some herbal bitterness in the finish. It's not what I'd call a refreshing beer, but it has a reasonably complex taste. I personally would prefer something like this to be balanced out with more hops, but that's not the focus of this one. It all revolves around the oak."
""
""
"I find it odd this beer doesn't have the usual Sam Adams logo on the label and instead the name of the beer.. interesting. Pours an amber/red, smallish white head to it. Faint caramel aroma. Decent mouthfeel, thin bodied, some caramel malts, quite watery. Really don't taste any 'oak' in this one, clean finish. This one was a big 'meh' for me, way too thin and watery and the taste just isn't there. Guess they all can't be winners... drinkable but not much else."
""
""
"O - a good example of the style."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a darkish red color with a small whitehead that dissipates, but leaves nice lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malts and slight hoppy aroma. Tastes of dark roasted malts with not much complexity. Is light to medium bodied, carbonated properly, with a good finish. Overall, a slightly above average red ale."
""
""
""
"Overall, I think I'd tire of this after a couple. I like the take on the style, and the layers of flavors. A decent fruity ale with some nice accents."
"Came with two in the Brewer's Choice 12 pack. That's probably enough for me. Don't think I'd need to get six."
""
"O: This was a pretty good beer. It's quite heavy on the oak flavor and has a lot of sweetness behind it. Not sure if I would buy it in a six pack if it existed, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Overall: Feels a bit like their Irish Red with a modest oak character. But that's just me!"
"Overall: A good red ale, but a tad too sweet for my taste though."
""
""
"Overall: A nice tasting beer. Good use of malts although the oak could of been a little stronger."
""
""
"O: The oak is the most interesting thing here, the underlying beer seems to be on the simple side. I appreciate that this is just oak and not bourbon soaked oak, but it needs something else. Glad I tried it, but I won't go looking for it. Hopefully, the recipe can be tweaked and we can see Mighty Oak version 2 in the future from either Sam Adams or another brewery. More oaked beers please."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew, this is your ""everyday"" type of ale so don't expect nothing out of the ordinary. I grabbed in a variety pack and wasn't disappointed. Salud!"
""
"O- It has it's highs and lows, the oak character is good but doesn't stand out enough. Finishes too dry and the taste just doesn't wow me."
"This is a good red ale, better than the regular SA red. A malt bomb for sure, but not as deep or enjoyable as you might hope."
""
""
""
""
"Came in the Spring Mixed Pack. This to me is a English style beer in its hops and its malt profile. Not a bad beer but the vanilla notes didn't really add to the mix and I found the beer a little one dimensional. I expected more from the description of the beer."
"Overall – This brew wasn’t really my thing. It’s basically an amber ale with a little vanilla. I was a little disappointed in the ol’ Boston Beer Company on this one. Nothing really stood out as impressive or noteworthy at all. Forgettable."
"The finish was nice: the oaky and nutty subtlety gave this beer a nice ending. And made it easier to go back in for another drink."
""
""
"We’ve been somewhat conditioned to expect intense flavors from a bottle with “oak-aged” on its side — but it doesn’t always have to be that way. Oak can also work to enhance the other flavors within the beer without getting in the way, and it does so here. Mighty oak would be a little better if the base brew was more complex, but it’s a drinkable brew regardless."
""
""
"O - I didn't care for this one. Seems a bit off. No recommended. There are better Reds to be had."
""
""
""
"O- Meh. Not terrible, but definitely not a great example of the style."
"O: a pretty good beer, one of the best from the seasonal pack I've got... this makes the Sam Adams 'Red Ale' taste like Budweiser."
""
""
"D - Enjoyed trying it. First of a seasonal pack, so I will be reviewing them all."
""
""
"Did not strike me at all as an American amber or red - more of an English pale ale. Caramel malt character is predominant, with some rustic husky notes. Hopping is mild and nondescript. Slightly woody at the finish, but that may just be the power of suggestion."
"O: Just a meh beer. Wouldn't try this one again."
"Mouthfeel was smooth but seemed a bit thin. It goes down really easy too. Overall not too bad."
""
"Overall this was nice but a little to sweet for me. Needs a drier malt flavor or a more complete fermentation."
"The aroma is fruit (raspberry) and bread. The appearance is medium amber and very clear. The taste is raspberries and bread, with a malty finish. The fruit and bread flavors helped make this an above average amber ale, easy to drink and will try this again."
"This beer is quite timid in relation to it's moniker. The oak is so subdued that it's bareley there and beyond that it tastes like a pedestrian amber. I think they played it a bit too safe on this one, but good for them for taking a stab at a nationally marketed oaked-ale."
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It is smooth and has a nice flavor to it. I would have no problem having a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I think this is a nice beer and a good example of a red ale. It isn't really anything exciting, but it is just a nice easily drinkable beer. I just wish there was a little more oak ale. I'd say this one is worth checking out. I'd drink it again."
"Color is a nice amber body with about a 1/2 inch of opaque colored head. Smell is very sweet mostly caramel and toffee but I am getting some oak and vanilla. Taste makes me want to pick up another but not pay too much since it's sweet, easy to drink, and light on hops or overall oak flavor. Mouthfeel is medium but easy. Overall I would get it again if under 10 bucks or found a case for typical 30 dollar Sam Adams price."
""
""
""
"Nothing very mighty to it as it doesn't pack too much of a punch flavor-wise. But as a light spring beer, its not bad. Light caramel notes play off a bit of oaky roastiness, giving the impression of oak aging. The roastiness is pleasant and easy going, but mild mannered to match the slight vanilla notes. Almost effervescent in the mouthfeel, and it leads into a dry finish. Not much to mention on the hops, but this is a malt heavy beer and thats ok. It works well as an easy drinker, one to sip on and not think to much about. Good little afternoon beer on the deck on a cool afternoon. I probably wouldn't buy a six pack of it though, but worth a try."
"Overall: easy to drink this beer. The woody tones are mild but definitely builds the character of this beer. Enjoyable but it will not blow you away - its a good session beer."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel has a wonderfully creamy smooth texture. Really something to be enjoyed."
""
"Overall: this beer isn't objectively bad, it's simply really not to my taste. Overly sweet caramel segues into dryish bitterness without segueing through tasty. Eh."
""
"O - This is a good start for Sam. Adams but as with much of their brews, I would never purchase a 6-pack of this brew alone."
"12 oz bottle from verity pack. Pours red with a short lived, off-white head. Grassy hops in the aroma followed by caramel malt. The body is medium and crisp. Caramel malt is balanced on the palate by earthy hops with some woody, fruity and sugary notes. Long, earthy finish. Nice, easy drinking Amber."
"My bottle poured a clear, ruby red with an off-white head. In short, this tastes like an adjunct-free Yuengling. That is to say, it's a smoother red ale with nothing but pale and caramel barley character. If you're used to mass-produced red lagers, this is a treat. But I find it kind of simple for a craft beer. There's no real hops character, but the malt is clean and clear."
""
"O: A good and easy drinking beer, but is otherwise unremarkable."
"12oz. bottle served in a nonic pint. Enjoy before June notched on the label. Pours a brownish-amber hue with a translucent clarity and a loose, half inch, cream-colored head. Some thins strands of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose is pleasant and malty with toffee and some buttery notes. Taste follows nose with the addition of a faint metallic quality. Butter comes off more as diacetyl. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, not a bad beer. Nothing mind blowing but decent."
""
""
"It's quite a looker, with a stunning red-amber color capped with a sizeable head. Smells fairly similar to Boston Lager with a touch of oak. The taste is solid, it's a nice amber ale with a solid malty presence and some nice vanilla flavors. Just a touch of oak comes in on the finish. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid. I could see this being disappointing if you're expecting the oak, but it's a good tasting beer either way."
"Not my favorite of the pack, but the oak makes this one more pleasant to sip than a classic red ale would have."
""
"O: This is a new one from Sam Adams that tastes pretty good but is not overally interesting otherwise...would not mind drinking again if I came upon it in the future"
"Overall this is not one of Sam Adams’ best efforts. Not really any oak to speak of and too many off flavors."
""
"The beer pours a hazy brownish color with a small off-white head. The aroma is full of toffee and toasted malt, with a little bit of oak and some lighter fruit notes mixed in. The flavor is more the same, with a small amount of oak, which is almost completely masked by the toffee and caramel malt notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall the beer is above average but not something I could drink all night. The brew is well made and meant for someone who enjoys a strong oak and vanilla flavor. That someone is not me, which is why I gave it only a slightly above average rating. If you enjoy those two flavors, then give this beer a try."
"12oz bottle, pours bright copper with a gorgeous, fluffy, off-white head, that holds good retention and leaves sticky lacing all over the glass. Aromas are sweet and oaky with vanilla, caramel - creme brulee perhaps. Tastes are sweet caramel and toffee up-front with notes of brown sugar, oak, and a overly strong dose of vanilla - it's a sweet, malty mess with vanilla to boot. Finishes with a slight herbal hop bite, with more sweet vanilla sticking on the palate. Mouth-feel is syrupy, medium-to-full bodied, and smooth. Overall, I think this really could have been better. The oak aging took over everything and we're left with a vanilla ale that is rather off-putting. The appearance was the best thing about this one & it seemed to be all downhill from there."
"Still one of the worst house ale yeasts in beer. Oaky? Yes. Mighty? No."
"Overall a very pleasurable brew to drink, reminds me a lot of a really good Cream Ale..."
"The taste is a little all over the place. Real sweet caramel up front and then the late oak finish but kind of a watery mush in between. Texture is smooth but spineless. This isn't terrible, I just can't see going out of my way for it. Some buffed up hops would probably improve this but that would change the style. Maybe it's self fulfilling prophecy but I feel like my instincts were right on with this one..."
"A decent amber ale, but no real oak character to speak of. I really loved oaked beers, but was pretty disappointed with this one. Glad I didn't invest in the whole spring mixed pack."
"D - Just a total failure on this one. I'll pass in the future."
"Drinkability- I thought this was really good. I really liked the vanilla flavor in it. It was very well balanced."
""
"O - I think this Red Ale is pretty standard in that nothing is wowing about it, and it's a good example of the style. I think the flavors are very balanced, and I really liked that hint of cocoa that I picked up in the taste. So overall it's a very drinkable brew that I'd definitely drink again, but I won't go out of my way to buy it."
"Nothing groundbreaking here, just a simple, plain, well-balanced red ale."
""
""
"It's an okay beer, but nothing I'd seek out. For the most part it tastes like your run of the mill amber/red ale."
"Decent beer. Not something I'd buy a 6 pack of, but a nice addition to the mixed 12 pack."
"O - This doesn't really taste like there was any oak in this one. Okay, but not what the bottle advertises."
"Pours clear dark amber tone, smells of spices and cherry, taste is very cinnamon spicy with some rubbing alcohol aftertaste. A bit watery thin, on the malty side but enough of a balance with the spiciness to not make it too sweet, a tad bland not all the way there but close"
"O- I can appreciate the effort to put a new spin on the style, but it doesn't do a lot for me. Not bad by any means, just not something I would seek out."
""
""
"Pretty much just a decent amber ale. The ""mighty"" oak doesn't make a mighty difference to me, it is there but not a game-changer."
"o 2.0 hoped this would be better (obviously). sometimes, the tiny explorer inside me just can't resist a variety pack. but sometimes, with SA, it just seems like i'm getting 2 good beers for the price of 12."
""
"Nice, easy drinking beer that has a nice complex character."
""
""
""
"Taste is mild up front, with a malty sweetness on the palate following. The oak flavor is subtle, very subtle. Overall, not bad at all, but not one I'd pursue further, either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep copper with foamy beige head. head lasts a fair amount of time, spotty lacing. Aroma is grassy, vanilla; not woody or whiskey barrel. Taste is creamy, vanilla, sweetish.Mouthfeel is light and a bit tangy. Quite enjoyable!"
"Mighty Oak isn't a bad beer at all, and although the the malt and wood profiles are both noticeable, neither is especially powerful. I like this beer because it is the type of thing I ran into at a party and was able to enjoy, and hopefully it will introduce casual beer drinkers to wood-aged beers. Also, it's nice to taste barrel-characteristics and hops in the same beer, which is rare. Even rarer, however, is that Mighty Oak doesn't need to be boozy to pull this off."
""
"A great stab at the whole fresh barrel aged beer movement, this direction I'd love to see from more brewers. As for Mighty Oak, its a good start. The oak does come around and the beer is pretty drinkable, a bit more dry would work for me."
"Kind of an odd beer. Would've expected a hoppier aroma and a bit more malt presence in the flavor."
"Overall, another solid product from Sam Adams brewers choice pack, very impressed makes up for winter fails. Has pretty good flavor, I like the finishing cherry flavor."
""
"O - I am not a fan of Reds but this is less sweet than most, with a mildly smoky allusion."
""
""
""
"Overall it's a pretty inoffensive beer on all levels."
""
"O- Overall, this one didn't do anything for me, it was just kind of bland.  I wouldn't purchase it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid offering. The vanilla oak sweetness is not overbearing or cloying, and the finish is fairly clean (a touch of back of the tongue bitterness). Some additional hop balance and carbonation would bring this beer up a notch."
""
"Deep reddened copper color with a small, soapy head. Nice sheets of lacing. Aside from the typical Sam Adams yeast character, the aroma features mild spicy, woody notes, soft fruits, and a bit of vanilla. Malty, sweet flavor...a fair amount of fresh grain, oak, and toffee. Simple and clean. Nothing to get excited about; if it were available in six-packs, I don't think I would ever pick one up. Not bad...just nothing special."
""
"I'm not a fan of ambers and this reminded me of one except for the slightly oak'd taste. Nothing special with this beer. Quality is typical of a Samuel Adams beer. Good packaging and labeling. I'd would have preferred a stronger oak taste. Worth a try but I'd limit it to a six pack."
"Taste is a mix of sweet malt and fruity flavors, picking up a blend of oak and vanilla, carbonation gives it a nice crisp feeling and is refreshing, still, the combination of everything just doesn't seem to work together, some aspects playing tug of war with no one winning in the end."
"O: I was looking more forward to this one than any of the others in the mix pack, and I guess I was letdown in epic fashion."
""
"Pours a light amber color, creamy off white foam forms and eventually disappears. Strong caramel in the aroma, with hints of vanilla. In the taste, caramel and Munich malts stand out, oak flavor lends some dryness and noticeable tannins. Light vanilla, nutty and brown sugar flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a prolonged drying finish showing the barrel /wood chip influence. Overall, an approachable Oak aged brown ale, gets better with each sip."
"Pros: loys of vanilla flavor from the oak obviously. Really nice red dapple color to the body and a decent head. Cons: if the oak was left out this would have been a light red ale. Like killians quality. Its all oak favor and no body. Overall flavor is weak. Very disappointing. Could barley finish."
"This is very average. It's fine as part of a bargain 12-pack (only $12.99) but I would not seek this one out. Looking forward to trying the Whitewater IPA next - Go Pats."
"O: A nice red ale that is aged very nicely in oak. You still get that red ale base that is only complimented by the oak. Not too grainy, like a lot of red ales that I seem to dislike"
""
""
"Another fine, but less than stellar ale from the Boston Beer Company. When needing a beer for that ""malt-fix"" this is a good go-to choice. The wood character is terse and is easily overlooked. While the lack of balance keeps the beer one-dimensional, I do appreciate the focus on malt and complementary wood notes. Simply a timid beer overall."
""
""
""
"Just ok. Nothing about this beer really blew me away. Simple flavor and a little boring."
"Opinion: This is an alright beer. I was a bit disappointed between the aroma and the flavor. I was expecting quite a bit more deliverance in the flavor, but it ended up being a well attenuated version of what I was expecting. Overall the beer is pretty light on the palate and pretty drinkable, but not one I would come back to unless it was like the only beer on tap at a pizza joint...then I would probably take it over iced tea or something non-beer like."
""
"12oz bottle from this year's spring mix-pack. Pours a dark amber crystal-clear body with a thin film of khaki colored head. Vanilla and wood comprise the aroma. Wood, vanilla, caramel, and nut comprise the flavor. Medium in both body and carbonation. Not bad - decent. Tastes good, but nothing to write home about."
"A very well crafted beer. Another winner from the Boston Beer Co."
"Pours a ruddy amber color. An off white head stands about 1/2 inch tall then settles to a wide ring around my glass with some islands of foam. Smell is of bread, caramel, a little bit of grassy or earthy hops. Taste is smooth, sweet, caramel, vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium, light carbonation. This is a well made beer, it isn't going to turn a lot of heads, but it has solid composition."
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, decent malts, a but too sweet and syrupy, nice toasty malts and hint of oak, bit more hops would have helped, as well as dry finish."
"Overall – Not very good. Cloying in the sweetness department."
""
""
"Really no personality to this beer. A bit too sweet and no noticable oak flavor."
"From a mixed 12 pack, this beer is a brownish, burnt amber color. Slim head, with good carbonation, and great clarity. The aroma could be more intense, but it is very enticing nonetheless. Nutty, earthy malt character...restrained hops. There is a touch of oak in the smell, but it comes out more in the taste. Slight fruitiness, but otherwise very clean. Just a bit of sweetness in the taste, with generous malt flavors. Full in body. Nice. I could have a few of these."
""
""
""
"A pretty good beer for a style I don't often drink."
""
"Overall it's not that impressive, not as good as some of their other beers in the sampler pack."
"Interesting, and worth a try"
""
"O/D-A mellow drink. I would rather have a beer like this (mild) than a gross over-exaggeration with the oak. A simple drink. I guess its worth a try."
""
"I had this beer a couple weeks ago in the Sam Adam's sampler pack and decided to get another sampler pack and give all of them a try again. To be honest, I think this beer grows on you, and is actually pretty good overall. The look is what you would expect from a red ale. Amber brownish in color, and pretty clean looking. The main thing I get from the nose is faint vanilla, and possibly some light oak aging, and perhaps the smell of light, fresh bread. Taste to me is pretty good. The beer is sweet, but not overly so. Lots of malt, with a lingering vanilla taste, that follows to an oaky type taste. The oak taste in this beer does not taste like old oak barrels or anything like that, it's more like fresh cut wood, that's the best way I can describe it. Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonation is good. Liked this beer much more the second time trying it."
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty average beer and as far as Amber and Red Ales go this one wasn't that memorable, the flavors just seemed to be bland and with a name like Mighty Oak I expected a distinctive oak presence like what was claimed on the bottle, but there was hardly any to be found. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the blandness of the aroma and taste and the lack of oak flavor in this beer, it just didn't meet my expectations. This beer did have some good drinkability, the smoothness and lighter flavors made this beer go down quickly but it just didn't have enough flavor to hold my attention. I would recommend this as a starter beer for someone wanting to get into oaked beers but if you have a some experience with oaked ales you may find this beer underwhelming like I did. Samuel Adams can make some solid beers but this one fell short when it came to the aroma and flavor and with a name like Mighty Oak I expected a pretty big Oak presence and that is not what I got, better luck next time Samuel Adams."
"I don't really care for this, the flavor mix & overall presentation are just very bland with cloying sweetness really bringing this down. Not one I would buy again. The flavors seem fake to me"

"Overall a very good, drinkable beer. Reminds me of Bass Ale. Sessionable. The Oak character is much less prominent than what I'd expect."
"O: another impressive offering from Boston beer in this, what i believe to be their best mix pack yet"
""
""
""
"After sipping this and checking Boston Brewing's profile of this beer, it would seem like my taste-take is very close to their intent. A good malt lovers' beer..."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a bright amber with a half inch of white head, with minimal lace. Smell is very malty, carmel, vanilla, and a some breadyness. Taste is that, with vanilla being dominant, with a some clove in the finish. Body is average, not much life, easy drinking, and not dry. This is a nice beer, reminds me of what Octoberfest would taste like, of it was aged on oak chips."
""
"A tasty brew, I can't see myself going back to this one, but a real change of pace for these guys."
"Very drinkable yet interesting amber."
"My candid advice to you is to drink this one at or near room temperature. It really brings out the flavor and makes it a bit more creamy as an ale should be. Other reviews have it pegged. It's not a stout by any means -dont be fooled by the name- but as a light ale, it does pretty reasonably at room temperature. Cold, the flavor is quite masked."
"O: This is a very flavorful beer. Maybe a little too sweet to make it a session beer. However, it is very drinkable."
""
"Pours a clear reddish-amber with a dense off-white head that settles to a thick haze. Malty aromas of biscuit malt and caramel dominate with some piney hops and a touch of oak. Taste is similar to the nose, very malty, with plenty of caramel, biscuit, and buttered toast with a noticeable ""woody"" finish that imparts delicate vanilla and oak flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Overall a very approachable, drinkable brew!"
""
"Overall - Severely disappointed. This may be the worst beer I've ever had from Sam Adams. If you put me up in a blind taste test between this and Budweiser American Ale, it'd be blind luck if I got it right."
"This beer tastes like someone blended a red ale with Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel."
"Eh, I was expecting more."
"This is a decent beer but the caramel and vanilla are a little intense and sweet. It's one of the better beers in the mix pack however."
"O -- Overall this is a very smooth drinker. Not sure where to categorize it, but it's sort of brown ale-like with less roasted malt and a touch of vanilla. I've seen some posters talk about heavy and off-putting oak character, but this is far more mellow than many oak-aged beers out there."
"a delicious brown ale (that's what this beer feels like to me) that i was actually looking forward to the most in the pack. while it doesn't deserve the name ""Mighty Oak Ale", i think it's a good beer all on it's own. i hope Sam Adams does more oaked ales. an Oaked Octoberfest would be sublime."
""
"Overall – A nice brew with some interesting qualities. Get the oakiness without the overbearing alcohol flavors of many oaky beers. Not too shabby."
"This is a candy-like, though not overly sweet, malty brew with a nice touch of oak! Well-done! An enjoyable malty brew!"
""
"It's advisable that you drink this ale slightly chilled and NOT ice cold, which only serves to enhance some of its less desirable qualities and mask the already faint oak flavors."
"This beer pours a light bodied bright amber in color with a one finger bright white head. The nose is pretty sweet and malty. You get a lot of caramel malt and candied malt in the nose. It doesn't have any oak to it though, but I don't think this claims to be aged, just to have an oak finish. Not too shabby though. The flavor too, of sweeter candied and caramel malts. I don't get any oak or woodiness in the after taste. The sugar is somewhat creamy. It has nice flavor for the style, just on the sweet side of things. It drinks a little light in body and has slight residual sugar. Overall this beer is very approachable and not too bad. It's a little sweet for the style but it makes it a little more drinkable. The ""oak"" aspect is a little deceiving but it's a solid beer."
"Oviedo, Fl - Publix Supermarket - 12 oz bottle. I think PorterPounder accurately described this brew. Here are his words ""Sparkling dark copper pour, nice soft, slightly off-white head that leaves a wee bit of lacing. Aroma is slight, with some very brief vanilla notes, a hint of peppery spiciness. Flavor is chewy with some nuttiness, a hint of caramel. some wisps of vanilla and just a brief hint of bitter citrus in the finish. thick, velvety smooth mouthfeel."" Part of their Brewer’s Choice Variety 12-Pack."
"Overall this beer was a treat to drink due to it's easy quaffability (making up words now). I could easily drink many of these in one sitting and at this price point. Nothing really stands out as exceptional, but it is definitely better than average."
""
"O: I think this is a pretty solid beer by BBC. There are a few flaws to this beer, but the taste is amazing to me. A great Red Ale is hard to find and this for sure is one of the better ones on the market."
"Sampled from a Samuel Adams Boston Lager pint glass."
""
""
"Overall- I was expecting a more hearty ale. This is not a bad beer though. Add a little oak flavor and this beer would be great."
"Pours a bright clear red hue with a light tan khaki head forming thick and dwindling slow down the sides of my glass, the head is big bubbled with chunks of sporadic lacing left behind. Aroma has a nice caramel malt presence with a touch of oak/vanilla notes somewhat earthy blended notes but nothing as extreme in the oak character as most beergeeks are used to. Flavor is upfront with malt sweetness with a touch of toasted oak notes with a big fruity cherry note coming through and ending with a more caramelized malt presence. Drinking extremely effortlessly or I'm just really thirsty for a beer after work nothing extreme about the oak presence here. Just a nicely constructed red ale with a hint of something more complex than your typical red. Carbonation is sturdy really flows well, not cloyiing in anyway unless you're really sensitive to a maltier beer. Overall I would drink this again as part of a sampler but I couldn't honestly want to reach for just this in a sixer of it's own."
"Okay. Don't really get the oak in it other than the vanilla. SA doesn't really say how they get the ""oak"" in it. Oak barrels, chips, essence?"
"Overall, this is a nice, easy-going beer that drinkers expecting a beefier, heartier aged ale might find disappointing. Yet it is a decent steady, enjoyable with good flavor that, limited though it is, could go from decent to good with some work. I'd strongly recommend much more malt--oh, and some oak, please."
"D/O: This fruity ale has an old-fashioned English charm about it, suggesting that the brewer had a stock ale or old ale of lesser strength in mind. While not perfect, it really only stumbles significantly when compared to high-end barrel-aged beers. If Sierra Nevada's Old Cantankerous ale had been like this, then it would have been a much better beer."
"Drinkability: Pretty average overall."
"So, it is better than your averagee bland red ale, simply because of the nice small addition of oak in the flavor department. Next time, hop this guy up, add some vanilla, do something more, I think this is a good start, but far from complete."

"Pours out a fairly bright reddish copper color with a tan head. The smell is sweet, some toasty malts and vague spicey hops. As this beer has warmed a bit it has improved. At first I was getting some odd solvent smells but as it has warmed I am getting those nice oak notes I would find in my beloved Jim Beam Black, some definite vanilla and caramel notes in there. The taste is unfortunately not quite as complex and I found it a bit thin bodied even for a Sam Adams brew. The taste is a lot of sweet toasty malts, and some spicey hops finish. It finishes pretty dry. Mouthfeel is fine but overall this beer is just not as rich and satisfying as it could be. A good experiment for a variety pack but nothing I would ever buy by itself."
"Overall this is worth trying and a decent enough effort but a bit of a letdown for something called ""The Mighty Oak Ale""....just expected more woody notes....I would definitely buy this though if it came in 12 packs for 13,14 bucks...."
"Overall, this is a decent, but kind of a boring beer. If they were going for oak flavors, they are hard to find, instead the beer just comes off as malty sweet."
""
""
"Overall - Weres the oak? I think its hidden under the vanilla and cherry. I hoped this was going to be a great beer since im such a oak fan, but man, no type of oak at all comes out. Its ok, but nothing special here, could care less to drink again really."
""
"Pours a clear, reddish, amber color with a slight white frothy head. Scent is mostly that of dry malts. There is a unique taste here. Has obvious malt taste but with roasted tones. There are hints of vanilla and the oak really comes out in the dry finish. Another decent brew from Sam Adams, but why oh why does this only come in a 12pk variety pack?"
""
""
""
"Been really impressed with this mixed pack...probably my favorite mixed pack that BBC has released."
""
"overall - this is the SA i am used to - very underwhelming sub par craft beer"
""
"Found this in a Sam Adams brewmasters sampler 12 pack at Target, of all places. Hard to pass up as the sampler included three new varieties I hadn't yet tried. Poured into pint glass, with a perfect dark amber. Not much head, but decent lacing on the side of the glass. Mouthfeel was the low point for me, as there was no substance, just watery. Flavor was quite the opposite, though. Strong oak flavor, highlighted with a perfect blend of caramel and vanilla. This might be the driest finish of any beer I can recall. Decent beer that I would purchase on its own, away from the sampler. I want to prefer other breweries to Sam Adams, because I feel they are almost too mainstream. However, I can't deny that Jim Koch and crew put out some quality beverages. I'd rate it overall as an 89."
