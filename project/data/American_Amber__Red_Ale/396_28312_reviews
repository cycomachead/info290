"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth as it slides across the tongue with ease and the mild carbonation lets it go down like a milk stout, as the body is medium with a slight chewy feel but it's thin and watery at the same time. Good beer that I'd like to try again from a glass to get the full experience."

"Poured from bomber into pint glass. Large, thick, foamy head with great retention and lacing. Body is a clear and dark amber. The aroma was not strong, but traces of roasted malt and sweetness. Taste is roasty with a hint of caramel. Mouthfeel is great - full bodied and smooth. An enjoyable beer for the style."

"Thick ale, similar to a porter or a light stout.  Hop flavor is spot on for a nice atone and taste."

"Draft poured into a tulip glass.  Nice deep reddish color with a nice head, good retention and nice lacing.  Red ales are not generally my favorite style but this had a very nice hoppy aroma.  Flavor was good for the style with slightly more forward grassy hops than you might expect and a nice caramelly malty backbone.  Perhaps a hair thin on the palate.  Overall a very nice beer that I would  happily order again"

"Draft @ Gourmet Haus Staudt on 1/29/15.  Pours a deep red, brown in color with 1 finger of head and nice lacing.   Aroma is strongly hop-driven dank and resinous with notes of pineapple and citrus and some subtle malty sweetness.  Medium body.  Palate is dank, floral and robust hop bitterness with some sweetness from the malt backbone.  A nicely balanced beer."

"I love amber ales, and this is a nice toasted caramel hoppy ale. Some chocolate layers come in, but overall a nice malt sweetness. With a nice hop kick."
"Looks great. Pours great. Tastes great. But somehow has a bit too much burnt taste. Like eating a mouthful of semi sweet morsels when you were expecting dark chocolate. Great beer."
"Why NOT a vanilla, or chocolate, barrel-aged red ale? This concept fires the imagination. The space is there. This beer's a good red, a great red, even. But it doesn't really try to occupy that space."

"M: A bit too sweet for my tastes, as I'm not a huge fan of red ales, but still very drinkable. Kind of a weird hybrid of ale, porter and stout as mentioned above. I picked up a 22-oz bomber from my local shop for $3.50 on clearance, evidently they've had it left over since February. Not bad at all for that price."
""
""
""

"Overall it was a good seasonal beer. My gf got it for me and I gladly drank the whole bomber easily. Not my favorite style but a solid beer."

"O - one of the best and new favorite red ales I've had. My friends will tell you I'm a huge fan of this style and that's no doubt the case as I always have lots of different reds/Ambers gracing my fridge year round. But let me tell you, Alesmith's 'My Bloody Valentine' will compete with the best this style has to offer and may just top them all on certain days. What a treat! A valentines day treat that will have me making extra special preparations at having one of these fine dark red gems the day of V-Day next year"

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/24/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear dark red color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, citrus rind, caramel, toast, toffee, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of citrus hops with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, citrus rind, caramel, toast, toffee, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange/lemon zest, pineapple, citrus rind, caramel, toast, toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/floral hops with moderate caramel/toast malt sweetness; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent amber ale. All around great balance and complexity of citrus/floral hop and dark/toasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - really enjoyed this one. Huge malt character with vibrant hops. Loved every sip."
"I'm trying to keep this rating conservative, but I do love this beer. Drinking it on Valentines day may have made it even better. I love the strong hop nose. Possibly Centennial and Amarillo. I'm so glad I stocked up on this in San Diego. I'm not a big fan of Ambers/Reds usually either."
"Overall a very good hoppy red with an unfortunate but appropriate name."
""
""
""
"Overall, not bad, a bit too sweet for my taste mixed with heavy malt made it a slow drinker for me."
""
""

""
""
"This is a great amber, especially at $8/22oz. This is the definition of a price point beer. It's not $15, not $10. It's one hearty amber ale. Highly recommended, just a bit funky and sweet."
"A nice change of pace from my usual beers of choice. I am not a fan of hoppy beers, but this one balances the sweet and bitter notes so well, I didn't mind a stronger than normal hop presence. Tastes pretty much how I would expect a Valentine;s Day beer to taste, worth a try."
""
""

"22oz bottle $6.99 dated 12/23/2013. I wish this was a little fresher but whatever. Red color, good head and lace. Aroma us a malty red with a touch if piney hops, less than I expected. Flavor was caramel malts and again a small dosage of green hops. I really hoped this would have more if a hop blast since it's Alesmith but it was still a solid red. Not sure whether I should buy another bottle or not."

"AleSmith has really mastered the American Red category."
""
""

"a very well made beer, but I'm surprised people like it as much as they seem to here. its a really hoppy, really sticky, really thick, resinous ipa. deep brick red amber type color here, hazy and just thick as honey. the nose is citrusy hop, high alpha, robust and aggressive in all aspects. the malt bill is huge, the gravity is high, and i am shocked this comes in under 7% abv, its most impressive feature. a little pine from the hops, but its sort of tough to tell whether the sweet malt adds that sappy character or the hops does. I'm honestly not in love with it, it comes across a bit confused to say the least, bitter and sweet, but not in a good way really. it gets hard to drink, sticky and filling, especially with temperature, and just doesn't wow me the way it has for others. full body may be to its detriment here, just too much so deal with, but the carbonation tries as hard as it can to make this move, but its stuck. alesmith can really do no wrong for me, but i like this less than most of their other stuff, i expected more from a special release."
""
""
"Notes: It's a little dry, if I were to spend Valentine's Day alone, I would want it to be sweet and malty. It's nice for a red ale, however."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very solid red ale right here. They seem to focus on the malts more than the hops on this one, which is cool. This beer will be compared with Evil Dead Red, which I personally enjoy more. Evil Dead focuses on the hops. My Bloody Valentine focuses more on the malts. Two different takes on the styles."
""
"O- A very nice beer from Ale Smith. It drinks easy and had a nice hop presence that borders the pale ale category. Dont get Ale Smith in NC but if we did I would drink this on the regular."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich, deep ruby with a lingering airy head that left thick lacing on the glass. Strong hops in the nose, herbal, pungent and earthy. Also picking up nectarines and marzipan. Taste is immediately sweet caramel and woody/fruity hops, followed by a bitterness like orange pith. medium thick mouthfeel with a soft carbonic bite. Definitely a malt oriented beer but there is enough hop character to balance it and bring it back to center. Think of a sweeter, milder, less bitter friend of Arrogant Bastard. Immensely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is nothing like Evil Dead, not in any way. Evil Dead is bold, this is it's preteen cousin. I did not care for it. I can get the same taste from generic brands. Waste of $5.00"

"Taste starts sweet, cherries in the middle, with moderately bitter close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. Cherry starts to get a bit old as time passes, but a good brew overall."

"Great as a red ale. Really good hoppiness and not overdone, with chocolate in the secondary to give it an added dimension. Very good drinkability. Bottle from Campone's, well worth the $12 and email to keep aside for me.Hoppier than its scent. Above average mouthfeel."

"O - An above average red ale that delivers on all fronts."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Such a strange and unique combination of characteristics but decent enough to pay a visit to if given the opportunity. I am appreciative of the chance to try this but I probably would not have it again if I had other options available."
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the interesting blend through the aroma, and the gorgeous mouthfeel. The initial nose gives big fruitiness to match the equally as big shoes of the grain bill and the deep, spicy hoppiness. Between the chocolate and the strawberries it actually did feel oddly appropriate for the holiday. The flavoring came nicely, but much of the hoppiness was lost between the massive overhaul of caramel, chocolate, roast, and toast through the grain. This also made room for the sweetness to peak just a bit too much by the end of the sip. More than making up for it was the feel, which gave silky, creamy softness to each hit from the glass. This is a tasty, well executed beer, and it seems to not only fit the style, but fit well within the ranks and idiosyncrasies of the brewery."
"I find this to be an excellent beer, worth a shot if you're into stronger amber ales, despite the fact that the ABV is only 6.66%."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that is lightly foamy and persistently smooth across the palate. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness lingering across the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty darn good amber/red, i would even probably consider it a pale ale of ambers. Behind green flash red ipa, this is my fav. in that style. I highly recommend it to anyone. Actually gets really good around room temp, for some reason a good amber or red is the only style besides a barley wine i can handle at room temp, maybe a bba stout. Pick it up, delicious."
"Alesmith Brewing Company is one of those breweries that seems to never let me down. I’m not sure they’ve ever brewed even an average beer. My Blood Valentine is another fine release. It’s a very well balanced Red Ale that’s incredibly drinkable. Very glad to finally find it in Ohio. Easy recommendation!"

"this one is right on par with the rest of alesmith's ipa's. the artwork on the bottle is also pretty awesome."

"This is a really nice Red Ale and probably my current favorite! This has a ton of flavor without being overwhelming and the ABV isn't too high either."
"Overall: This is a good beer but nothing very special for the style. There are way better hoppy red ales out there. Tocobaga to name just one"
""
"Shazzam! This is great beer! Poured perhaps slightly too cold. Immediate hop aroma upon opening. Poured with a giant, foamy, frothy, thick, light tan head that slowly settles and lots of lace. Color is a clear amber red with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is a very heady balanced, fresh blend of caramel malt and hop that was mostly pine with a little grapefruit. Flavor's like nose, slightly roasty (which i love), dominated by the hop and just balanced enough by the malt and carbonic tang. Body/carbonation are faultless. Finish is like flavor, long, and just a tad medicinal. Very drinkable"
""
""
""
"Overall: This beers is okay. Nothing mind blowing, but its definately a beer of Alesmith well know quality. It reminds me of MBC Zoe, but just doesnt taste quite as good."
""
"O: Good stuff and an easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has a great balance between hops and malts and is rather easy to drink. It seems more like a hybrid between an amber ale and an IPA."
""
"Overall a good beer. For me, the only downside was that earthy quality, not necessarily a bad quality just didn't seem to mesh with the other flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: Different in a straightforward way; this brew brings earthy hoppiness built on a strong, sweet malt foundation. The sweetness is simple and almost overcomes this brew leaving little breathing room for the rest of the palate. I still enjoyed this beer which needed more malt complexity."
""
""
"O - Tasty beer, kind of all over the place though"
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. A decent balance of malt and hop presence, with an emphasis on the West coast dry-hopping. Nice beer, although I was hoping for a little more expression in the nose."
""
"Overall: Well done Alesmith. A very enjoyable and drinkable beer that doesn't sacrifice complexity."
""
"Overall, what this beer really has going for it is hop aroma. Otherwise, it's pretty a pretty average brew with a gimicky name."
""
""
""
"Anyway, The beer poured out as a deep red color. The head was a light shade of tan with a very good retention and lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is sweet, it's also hoppy and there is even some chocolate coming through on this one. The taste of the beer was pretty good, it's got some transitions from sweet to bitter then back to sweet. The malt followed by the hops and finally the chocolate comes in to settle things down a bit. The flavors to me sometimes get a little on the awkward side so at times I really liked it and other times I didn't. The mouthfeel was pretty good. Well carbonated and had a medium body. Overall I thought the beer was good. Sometimes though I think the flavors in it clash a bit and that hindered my thoughts on the beer. I enjoyed it but I feel there are better alternatives out there, it's still worth trying to see for yourself though."
""
""
""
""
"O: I actually did like this beer, despite my criticisms (cue joke about the exgirlfriend). Still, I probably wouldn't have again unless I was desperate."
""
""
""
""
"Juicy and smooth. Hardly any bitterness but still heavy on the hop aromas. Brilliantly balanced. An beautifully executed Amber Ale."
""
""
""
"O: I'm no red ale expert - I tend to dabble, but I also tend to like what I drink, and this was no exception, nor was it exceptional - a good, drinkable, enjoyable beer from a reliable brewery. Recommended."
"Complex and flavorful. Well worth a try. Nice to go with a decadent dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty darn nice beer. Not a ""top scorer"" in terms of Amber Ales, but fits the Valentine's theme nicely. Could even pair nicely with a chocolate cake or chocolate ice cream."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A fairly simple amber ale, the malt profile is rich and sweeter but the hops help counterbalance it well. A worthy brew."
"O- At first this didn't overly impress me, but it grew on me the more I drank it. I really appreciated the balance between the sweetness and the hops and I also thought it was a fairly unique brew that had a nice theme going on. Not the best amber I've had, but definitely one of the better ones. I'd definitely drink this again and I recommend checking it out."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a deep red amber with a fine two-finger light brown head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine hops, caramel malt, citrus and fruit juice. Flavor of dense, but neutral malt, light berry juice, citrus and citrus hops. Initial flavor is extremely well blended and satisfying. Finishes with toasted malt, pine and citrus hops, residual berry juice. Great medium body with nice creaminess. The flavor seems very low key at first, but is quite complex despite its subtlety. I could not stop taking sips from this. I was hoping for something a bit more blood red, but should have known Alesmith would go for great taste and feel rather than gimmick. Excellent."
"A classic horror film, a great band, and a very nice red ale."
"I usually despise balance, but this beer does a good job of mixing up interesting tastes, balance, & depth. Very good beer."
"Had to buy this for valentines day, you win alesmith marketing team. Maybe is for the band, I digress. Pours dark maroon with a two finger beige head that laces well.smell is very hoppy, some dark fruits, pine, some malt. Taste is hoppy from start to finish but also dark fruit, Carmel, malty, some grain, slight sweetness. I don't usually go for red ales but this is hoppy enough to keep my attention. Not just a novelty, a solid brew"
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good, tastes like no other amber rye ive ever had. Lots of citric fruits, herbal hops and caramel malts. Good beer, nice take on the style. Balanced well and enjoyable to drink."
"i'm enjoying this more than nugget nectar cause the hop and sweetness are not out of the ballpark like they are in that beer. very enjoyable"
"O - I had never heard of this beer. I stumbled across it three days ago and figured what the heck? It's Valentine's Day, and I'm cheesy with pairing beers and days of (in)significance. Being a product of Alesmith made it a safe gamble. It is an enjoyable hoppy amber/red ale."
""
""
"Decent mix of hops and malt here, malt getting the caramel and toffee thing to your senses right up front, the hops are probably a little on the higher side, but this is something that is approachably balanced but sturdy and slightly aggressive at the same time. A twist of vanilla, chocolate and citrus in the mouthfeel, very subdued compared to the other aspects of the beer. This beer puts a lot of different aspects together to make a far better than average amber ale, you get plenty of cascade hops I suspect, lots of caramelization, just the right amount of alcohol. Good stuff, glad I picked this one to try while I was there while the old lady as usual was pounding down Speedway."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nicely balanced yet very flavorful on both fronts. Less sweet than the smell indicates. The hop stays back until the beginning of swallow. It does take over and leave a long lasting aftertaste. Milky body with an under average carbonation level."
"B"
"O: I was excited to see a beer from AleSmith that I had not seen previously. I was not disappointed. Delicious beer. This is a treat and very accurate for the style as well as the specific idea they were going for."
""
"Not really sure this was a good description of a beverage suited for a romantic evening, but it's doubtful you bought an AleSmith brew to please your better half. Marketing aside, this is a damn good hoppy-red, I look forward to it each year (although it kinda gets lost in the Pliny the Younger-Citra-Exponential Hoppiness-shuffle)"
""
"Great malty flavors add a lot of character to this take on the American Amber style. Plenty of floral/citrus hop flavor and bitterness as well."
"Overall: Really loving this beer. It is amazingly clean and complex...I taste the distinct hops, but they never approach overly bitter..super smooth, I could have several of these on a cold winter's day."
""
"Exceptionally well crafted amber/red, probably one of the best there is, floral but not overwhelming on any front. Alesmith hits the mark again, get it while you can."
""
""
"Get it if you can, my kids. Get it if you can."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours reddish/amber (more of a bright red when held up to a light) with an inch and a half light tan head that stayed around for a while. There's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and hoppy, the brew smells like floral and citrusy (grapefruit, oranges) hops, caramel malt, and some mint. It tastes like citrusy and pine hops, caramel, toasted malt, toffee and a bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, it's definitely worth a try. $8.99 a bottle."

"Great looking beer. Pours a deep maroon. Looks pretty transparent. No haze or lees apparent. Nice big head, light beige. It's a bit rocky but sticks around for a long time. The aroma is a mix of floral and bright citrus hop notes. There's a little spruce to the beer, as well. Underneath the hops, some caramel and toastier malt flavors come through. The taste has good hop flavor, nice delicacy/complexity. The malt plays a larger role than in the aroma. Good depth from the darker malt. It almost has a light chocolate flavor. In both the aroma and taste, the beer just lacks somewhat in intensity for the abv. For a ~6.5% abv beer, I just want a bit more. Mouthfeel also doesn't really help, as it gets a bit watery in the middle. Still, it's a good beer. I just wish there was a bit more to it."
""
""
"The palate opens with an herbal and chalky bitterness that also has the flavor of a rather bicarbonate-heavy water profile. With pine and moderately juicy citrus hop flavors complementing the herbal and minty bitterness, the opening flavors are quite enjoyable. The mid palate brings a bit of toast and toffee. Sweetness, however, is minimal here. Drying, toasty and hoppy on the finish, there's a blend of pine and citrus pith present. Medium light in body, the carbonation here is rather excellent - creamy but firming, lending a soft and smooth palate to carry the flavors. The water profile is a little distracting, at least initially, but the carbonation makes up for it. Very good, highly recommended."
"Overall, tasty and not too expensive."

"Dark brown in the tall tulip, and a little murky in appearance. Not so carbonated in the mouth. One of the best hoppy beers I've had lately. On the cask at Local Habit in San Diego Feb. 15."
""
"It’s a dark red hued brew with nice foam. There’s a crisp, hoppy aroma to it, rounded out with some malt sweetness. Flavor is more citrus, reminding me of pink grapefruit. Nice flavor, sweet but not overpoweringly malty with some piney chew to give it character and complexity."

"Pours a murky reddish brown with a khaki head that settles to a small cap. Chunky rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest and grapefruit mainly. Taste is of citrus zest, grapefruit, and some other peppery and herbal hop flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has some nice hop flavors gong on."

"Best amber ale (if you can truly call it that) I've ever had."
"Red color is pretty hard to get in to a beer, but Alesmith did a pretty good job with this one. There is a light tan head which sits atop a nice brown and ruby body. The aroma is predominantly of fruity Centennial hops, with a bit of peach from some Amarillo. The malt underlying the hops is apparent...even with this much hop character, this is still going to be a malty beer. The Amarillo is lost in the flavor with the Centennials taking center stage. There is a caramel malt sweetness with a restrained bitterness that allows it to shine through. Pretty solid beer."
"T: Opens with some earthy, floral hop notes and moves quickly to a strong biscuity malt note. Toast, sticky citrus hops and a clean, hoppy finish. Leaves a slight unsweetened chocolate bitterness as well."
"Drink- I like the candy, creamy finish. The ABV was there but over done and had a nice sweetness to it."
"Extremely drinkable."
"Going in with little to no expectations, this beer really impressed me. I'll be back for more."
"D: really easy drinking and was tastier from the last time I had it; good hoppiness too. Also was good paired with a grilled chicken sandwich."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer, the most striking thing about it is the color as it's being poured - once in the glass it's not as interesting. A very good beer that's well worth a shot."
"D - Very easy drinking, had this at the bar, and everyone in my party liked it - was glad to have caught this on tap at Churchills and not had to hunt for it after Valentine's Day. At $5 for the pint, very affordable and it was a nice way to acquaint myself with Churchills, which I'd recommend..."
" "
"The fact that Alesmith makes any other reds is a crime. This beer was amazing. This year I was able to have it on tap at beachwood bbq, fathers office and najas. Out of the tap pours a thick, creamy love story. You can hardly see through it for its murky body and it coats your palate like a delicious blanket. This is my favorite beer of the style that I have ever had. A lot of times, red ales seem a bit thin and harshly carbonated. This is a beer for people who love big beers, but it keeps it relaxed with its non-threatening abv."
"""Sometimes"""
"D: One of my new favorite beers from Alesmith. It's unfortunate that this beer isn't one of their ""staples", but I suppose it will make me look forward to the opportunities I get to have it."
"Overall try this beer. It is world class for sure. I will drink it every time I see it."
"In a comparison of this beer with ""hoppy red"" offerings such as GF Hophead Red and Rogue Dry Hopped Red, I think this beer just misses the sweet spot. Stood alongside standard ambers such as Mendocino Red Tail, BP Calico, and AV Boont, it is a very strong offering."
"D: Tasty another world class Alesmith brews. One of the better Ambers made."
"D - Very. Easy to drink, easy sip wants another. Not too much of anything. Nice stuff."
"D- Incredibly drinkable. I could drink this stuff all day. I loved the distinct hop presence in this one which was just enough to appease me without being so strong as to mask the complex maltiness."
"easy to drink. way to easy. i gotta slow down. half a growler later im buzzing. well done alesmith"
"Yet another Alesmith beer that I wish was bottled. To be sought out, for sure."
"D - As much as I wasn't terribly impressed I still liked it and could drink this quite a bit. It's definitely quite different."
"I personally wouldn't have more than one of these in a night because it's just a bit too unbalanced and I couldn't dig the flavor."
"Glad I tried this one, but not blown away. It went quickly, but not sure if that's because I liked it, or I wanted it gone. A strange, complex, and worth trying brew."
"Who makes beer for Valentine's Day? That's a day for eating chocolate, but if you want your daily pint, My Bloody Valentine can fill that need."
"Drinkability: The aforementioned bitterness made this suffer here, but it still was very sessionable."
"D - Great drinkability here, glad that I got a growler of it, as it won't be sold in bottles."
"Had this on tap at Hamilton's maybe a month ago. Darkly colored with no head. Big resiny hopes in the aroma that fade into sweet malt and dark fruits. Taste starts with resiny hops and fades into citrus and dark fruits. Mouthfeel was damn near perfect, being right in the middle. I could drink a lot of this in one night. Can't wait to have it again."
"D- Oh man, I love this beer. The growler is half gone and I just cracked it open. I love Alesmith's stuff, but I really look forward to their special releases...I wish they would bottle this stuff."
"The body is between mid and full. A lighter carbonation but this enhances the malty and fuller body of the beer. Overall a good beer, no matter when you try it."
"Taste is primarily malt. There's some vanilla, maybe some darker fruits, and definitely some pine (not much grapefruit) hop content. A good beer, but certainly not a great one."
"D: A very good red ale, probably one of the best I've ever had, defintiely worth a try if on-tap."
"Drinkability is moderate, this is a well-balanced amber with plenty of flavor, definitely a lighter cousin of Evil Dead Red and Decadence, this is more reminiscent of PP Sharkbite in terms of a lower hop presence, definitely worth trying in honor of V-day!"
"An enjoyable red ale with some more unique characteristics. I'll try to get at least another growler of this while it's still available..."
"Highly recommended. A great, perfectly balanced red."
"Exceptionally smooth amber ale. Nice hoppiness but great malt backbone. I didn't get to take great notes on it, but man I sure did like it. It was incredibly easy to drink due to it's awesome balance. Enough hops to give a hop fix, but the balance was maintained very well. Quite a treat. I was happy to find it."
"Poured from the growler, direct from the tap at the Brewery in San Diego, about one hour after purchase. The red color is amazing - clear, with small bubbles of carbonation. Lacing apparent all the way down the glass, but the head disappates quickly. It tastes similar to their ESB, but has something more - a smoky/burnt caramel taste that's really intriguing. Alesmith keeps on putting out winners and I keep drinking them up!!!"
"D- amazing complex flavor and jaw dropping beautiful color. only gripe is that sometimes you feel as though your drink a soft drink (though this brew is not that carbonated, its still really sweet). to sweet to session but this would pair well with some cheesecake, mmmh mmh"
"Drinkability: Because the bar stated that this was a 10%abv brew, I must say that it is very drinkable. Not that I'd have another any time soon, but because it's so unnoticable. It feels like a standard red ale. It's so hard for me to believe that it's 10% that I think the bar may have been wrong."
"I had this at the release party at the brewery. This is supposed to be the same beer as the Evil Dead Red but it tasted different to me. There was less of a fruit taste and more bready yeast. The colour was the same deep red/brown with a nice cask poured head. Smell was slightly of fruit, some bread, almost oaty. Taste was more of the same, except subdued. The smell was much stronger than the taste. Mouthfeel was good, it really coats the tongue. I could have a few of these. This is a nice well made beer, but i think the last batch brewed as the Evil Dead Red was better."
"D: I found this beer to be somewhat standard (for an Alesmith beer). Least favorite Alesmith to date. Mind you there is nothing wrong with this beer, I finished ever last drop happily."
"Had this on the debut party at the brewery. Very rich malty aroma and seemed to pour red. But it was hard to tell as it was in a red plastic cup The aroma and first sip were similar with big malts and flavors, but on the end it just dropped off with no aftertase or not much remaining on the palate. Good beer just fell a little short at the end"
"update: it seems this beer is 6.3% alcohol. Lower than expected, but not too shabby."
"I think this beer would make a good session beer. I dont know the alcohol content, but I think it is up there. This beer is not overly aggressive. I think I could drink this one all night long. If AleSmith ever bottles this, I will have to get a few cases. One of the best I have had from them."
