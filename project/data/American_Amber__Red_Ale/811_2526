But, as stated, it's a little disappointing, given that I've liked other products from Highland, and this is their ur-product.  I've been told that on draft it better matches its promises, both in terms of official description and critical profile, but I suppose I'll believe that when I taste it; from the twelve-ounce bottle, it was decent, but underwhelming.","OrestesMethuon","Jan 28, 2015"

3.7,-2.9,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.75,"With a bearded bag-pipe player set against the mountainous backdrop of Asheville NC gracing the label, how can this lose? Filled on 10/7/14. The beer pours with a bright amber clarity, and a rocky manilla head. 2 fingers of foam recede, leaving lavish lacing on the glass.  The nose is dominated by biscuity malts. Tart cider-like notes and piney hops battle for second fiddle. The flavor delivers caramel sweetness, and a buttery toffee that reminds me of an English ale. However, the tangy hop bite quickly takes over, washing away the malts and leaving only nice toasted grain in the finish. The mouthfeel is a tad watery, with tame carbonation, though it doesn't detract from the experience. This brew achieves a very respectable balance.  A classic American Amber, true to the style. Nothing earth shattering, but a delightful and well-crafted treat from the Tarheel State.","JohnnyI","Dec 30, 2014"

Clean and refreshing ale with a hint of hoppiness. This is a taste that I think many people would enjoy (ala Sweetwater 420). Feel is superb. Clean, refreshing,  and tasty.

Smooth and sessionable, especially for an amber ale. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, my into to Highland and I am very pleased seems to veer the line between what I consider an amber and red (in a good way).

Extremely flavorful in ways that remind me of some oktoberfests: very malty and big on the toasty notes. Sweet toffee up front, toast and browned biscuits on the midpalate, before giving way to almost tea and bitter walnut skin-like flavors on the finish. I like this a lot and plan to make a part of my fall lineup.","droomyster","Jul 07, 2014"

Aromas of toffee sweetness, caramel and nut sweet, roasted notes, and subtle earthy notes. Flavors are roasted and richly sweet forward, with toffee and caramel creating a tangy sweet blend. Hints of roasted notes, honey, wood, and thistle help round out the palate. The body is smooth and light, with a tangy sweet and roasted aftertaste. The finish is slick, smooth, with a sweet linger.

Very slight hop aroma. Taste is well balanced, with a malty beginning fading to a nice lingering hop bitter finish. Medium body and carbonation, makes this beer very easy to drink.

4.35,14.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall (4.5): I’m definitely impressed with this beer. Red Ales usually aren’t my thing—I can dig super hoppy American Amber / Red Ales like Nugget Nectar, but I generally don’t derive much joy from Irish Reds, for instance. This is pretty tasty, though. Nice mix of Old and New World takes on the Amber / Red category. Definitely not the Nugget Nectar hop bomb type of AA/R, it leans more towards the Irish side of things. Maybe because of that, I bet this would be killer on cask, too. Surprised by how much I liked this, actually, especially after not liking the Oatmeal Porter very much. Nice work, Highland.","fmccormi","Oct 17, 2011"

This is deep burnished copper with almost no head, despite the rough pour. I think that any beer especially an American hopped amber should have the carbonation and head to bring up the aroma. The bee smelled mostly malty, with a bit of fresh hops, but mostly just grainy malts. The taste was mostly the same dominated by a biscuity malt and balanced only by a modicum of hoppiness. I think that this style (and not the double) should have an assertive hop character with grapefruit and tropical flavors and medium-high bitterness, which I find lacking in this beer.","Soonami","May 03, 2011"

Drinkability is missing from the scale these days and I think that is one of the strengths of the Gaelic. It has a slightly bitter feel but a smooth malty finish. I think it is a solid go to beer for entertaining and for good afternoon hang. Delightful despite it not being an ""A" beer.","dball","Apr 01, 2011"

The nose is full of floral aroma and sweet like honey. This is where the Cascade and Williamette do wonders for the aroma of a beer. The taste was on the upper bitter end for an amber, but it while I thought it was well balanced with the malts, the bitterness lingered a little too long. A tiny hint of earthiness, spice and fruit came through in the taste making it a nice light-bodied, flavorful, semi-sweet amber with character. I'd say while it's drinkable for me, it may be a little complex for those seeking a session. But if you're looking for a unique amber, definitely give this beer a try.","Prospero","Mar 12, 2011"

Some piney, earthy hop flavor to start, bitter floral aftertaste that lingers around on the tongue nicely. This is a very malty tasting beer, quite bready and biscuity, with a pleasant sweetness and a very dry finish. The mouthfeel is quite thin, leaning towards the light-light medium body with a perfect level of carbonation.

The aroma was comprised of malt, slight fruit, and nuttiness. The flavor is comprised of smooth and crisp malt notes with a subtle nutty flavor mixed in. It has a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is a very nice brew from Highland. It is quite drinkable and enjoyable. Worth a shot if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Jun 10, 2010"

I think either the addition of more intense hops, or malt (or both) would really allow this ale to stand out.

4.14,8.7,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"About a finger's worth of tan head, mostly larger bubbles which dissolve swiftly, the lacing broad but also slides down quickly. Full on amber red with enough brown to darken it into near opacity, more brighter orange around the rims. In the nose there's a lot of interplay between the caramel, molasses and the pine, herbaceous hops, orange peel, milk chocolate, brush of peach and apricot fruit, long presence in your nostrils. Full-bodied and broadly set, as in the nose it's impressive for its sheer stature and weight. As a result, it is a good thing the carbonation is very active. The molasses, brown sugar, caramel sweeter upon mouth entry, the overall finish is dry. Very leafy, almost twiggy, the pine and orange, lemon citrus elements drier than expected. Here you get a touch of softer, creamier bread dough with a few lactose accents. Easily drinkable while in no manner simple.","farrago","Feb 21, 2010"

Mouthfeel is solid. This brew approaches chewable. Definitely a different hop approach, much more earthy, with flatter bitterness.

Head eventually settled into a thin, broken skim with only a few spatterings of lacing preent during the tasting. Nose was malty with a light floral hops aroma in the background. Taste follows nose. Very malty with a toasted caramel character. Maybe even an earthy/peat-like quality in there. Mouthfeel is between light and medium with a hint of carbonation and a nice, unexpected creaminess.

I'm sticking my nose as deep down into the glass as I can go, and I'm not picking up much aroma - perhaps some mild caramel and nutty action, or maybe I'm just imagining it because my nose is all jammed into this thing. Thankfully it does have flavor and there is more of a hop presence here than in most typical amber ales. An almost sweet caramel malty taste followed by a bitter tang of hops. This went better with food - grilled chicken thighs seasoned with sage, oregano, basil, etc. and salt-n-peppa.

At 5.8% abv this might be on the high side of what most people consider a session beer, but I could easily put a few of these back without any complaints.

Hops kick in with the taste but the maltiness doesn't die down either. Still mostly caramel, but also some roasted quality blended in..Solid balance. The hop bitterness is there toward to finish, but doesn't actually linger, which may make this beer seem too sweet for some. Nice medium mouthfeel.

Very nice caramel malt with a good balance of citrus hops which gives this one an overall sweet character to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation.

It wants to be more thick than it is, but it just doesn't have the legs. A session brew that didn't wow me as the mouthfeel isn't very good--too thin.

Doughy and toasty -- the before and the after of bread? -- malt flavors come to the fore at first, followed by some mellow lemon and bergamot flavors; leafy hop flavors through and through. Bit of biscuity taste at the back. Solid taste, for sure. Medium light body, eminently quaffable.

Caramel malts and fruity sweet hops with just a touch of grapefruit rind tartness. There is a slightly sweet malt character that bridges to the fruit and slightly peaked citrus hop finish that lingers for the blink of an eye. This is balanced to the point of equilibrium, but nothing stands out. There is no carbonation present which gives this a bland, flat mouthfeel that is not appealing. Medium to light body, but overall the mouthfeel was sub par. Merely mediocre, balanced, but neither the malt nor the hop component were distinctive.

Taste is dominated by the maltiness, with some light hops and fruit coming in at the end. Mouthfeel is great with all the malt smoothness, and drinkability is on the same page.

Much more citric hop flavor than aroma. Citrusy hops are the first and last flavor, with soft bready malts in between, not sweet, but very biscuity. A bit of alcohol in the finish, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is soft and doughy with very little carbonation. This beer is extremely well balanced and highly drinkable.

Smells rich caramel sweet, toasted grains, and a tang that I think is citrusy hops, but it also comes across as kinda pine sol-ish. A hint of chocolate and some bready biscuit. Tastes caramel and toasted grains with mild hop bitter and an interesting citrus hop flavor. The hops have some grassy character, but also a piney flavor, too. Chocolate begins to rise late and persists as the primary flavor in the aftertaste. The finish is baker's chocolate dry. Medium easy downing mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.","mentor","Aug 02, 2005"

Smell is sweet caramel malt with a fruity background, maybe strawberries or cherries. Taste really doesn't live up to the smell, this really isnt that complex of a brew but it is tasty nonetheless i was just expecting a bit more frankly. Taste is your basic irish red with a very slim hops profile that isnt very noticeable. Begins with a sweet caramel/molasses flavor and a light fruitiness that resembles strawberries and a barely noticeable piney hops flavor that is very much in the background. I think this beer could be really good if they upped the hops a little as it would balance the brew out alot more. The mouthfeel is appropriately creamy and smooth with somewhat low carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good, and this could be a session brew but there are alot better irish red's out there (really King David's Red by edenton is a much better choice).","silver0rlead","Jun 10, 2005"

The hops are mainly grapefruit and fruity in nature. This is well balanced with a sweet malty smell. There is also a slight caramel aroma. Taste is mainly hop oriented consisting of pine hops which lead to a nice bitter finish. Similar to the aroma there is a nice balance to this which makes it really drinkable. Overall the flavor is light and refreshing. Coats the mouth well and is relatively full bodied for a red ale. This is a good beer overall and is quite quaffable.

This is almost quite dry in its maltiness, perhaps there is a hint of smokiness as well. The finish is quite drying with its mix of toasted, cracker, roasted, and smoke malt flavors.

4.15,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"A clear, reddish amber body is topped by a short but creamy head of off-white foam that holds quite well and maintains a thin lid throughout the glass, but leaves little more than some transient, spotty lace. Toasty and sweetish caramel malts and citrusy/earthy hops combine with a touch of yeasty fruitiness to lend a sweetened-fruit and malt character to the nose. The body is decidedly medium and it's very fine, natural carbonation from bottle-conditioning leaves it dextrinous, creamy, and smooth across the palate. The rich maltiness found in the nose returns in the flavor, but this time it's more toasty than ""sweet"" caramel, with a very subtle roasted edge and some low-level diacetyl. Its tempered with more earthy/mineral hop flavors than citrus; and a solid bitterness balances it quite nicely and leaves it rich and satisfying but still drinkable as the sweet malts are no longer able to become cloying. It can, however, build on the palate a bit with its fullness. Still, a splash of water, nip of cheese, or crust of bread can instantly take that down. Impressive!","NeroFiddled","Dec 07, 2003"

The taste is very appealing, with the strong raosted malt dominating, but with a decent smoked peat component. A hint of sweetness and carmelized sugar chimes in as well. A bit of bitterness lingers on the finish, but it is faint enough to make one wonder if it is hops or just bitterness from roasted malts. The aftertatse reveals a bit more of a pine note, verifying that there really is a low level hopping in this brew.
