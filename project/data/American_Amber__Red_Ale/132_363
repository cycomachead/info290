There was a decent enough malt taste to the beer but I had been expecting more hops to it as well & just more flavour really. At first I feared the can was past its best but when I checked the date it was a mere couple of months old so that doesn't seem to be the problem, it just seems like this beer wasn't for me and its not one I'll go back to I'm afraid.","flyingpig","Nov 10, 2014"

Smell is kind of malty, a bit of caramel. Taste is mild, a bit of hop bitterness, some light malts, easy drinking but a bit subdued. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer.","tone77","Sep 19, 2014"

My second favorite Rougue beer to Hazlenut brown. Paired with anything BBQ'ed. Only thing to make this brew better would #1 for my local stores to carry it (had to buy directly from Rougue website,also got one from Bevmo site) #2 for it to come is 12oz bottles which IMO would make it a little more user friendly.","dutesanch","May 30, 2014"

3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy copper amber color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of hop and malt flavors; with a nice malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice amber ale. All around good balance and robustness of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 23, 2014"

Aroma of caramel malt, yeast, sweet fruity esters and a bit of toffee and earthy pine hops fill the senses. Taste is sweet caramel malt, yeast and fruity flavors with some good earthy pine hops bitterness. Palalte is a medium body, slightly sticky mouthfeel with good carbonation. Finishes with a combination of caramel malt, yeast some toffee and fruity notes followed by some good earthy piney hops for balance.

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer is a hazy amber color with a lingering white head. The nose matches the taste perfectly. At first I was caught off guard by the bitterness and citrusy profile. TO be honest I wouldn't be surprised if they used orange while brewing because oranges are strong in the flavor profile. This is borderline IPA in my opinion. There is also a fair share of toffee notes, breaddy flavors and smooth light caramel flavors. This beer is rounded out by a nice presence from Rogues signature yeast. A solid, fruity red ale.","TwelveOunces","Oct 07, 2012"

Sweet toasted grainy bread up front, lightly buttered, with sugar free jam. Caramel with a touch of raisin. Some apple flavors and roasted malt on the finish. Piney hops come into balance and complicate flavors. Very very good and very complex with tons of layers. Even though it's released in the summer this is definitely a winter brew to me due to the flavor profile and heartiness of this beer. Good show from rogue.","jtierney89","Sep 24, 2012"

The liquid is a cloudy, glowing, opaque amber red, every bit true to the category, equal parts brown and orange rust, hordes of loose bubbles scattered throughout. The nose seems to take pains to play down the malt side of the equation, all pine, peat, salt and pepper, unprocessed grains and dry earth before allowing room for any butterscotch, caramel hard candy or cocoa accents, does not display discernible fruit nor citrus notes, lasts well without being showy. Medium-bodied, outsized carbonation fluffs it up big time in the mouth, at times you feel like its gonna escape your pursed lips. While there is an underlying astringency, here you get a lot more caramel, toffee, creamed coffee as well as cocoa roast. The grains turn towards country style bread and biscuits, less herbal. Here you get a splash of grapefruit and sour orange alongside the more saline aspect. Stains the palate deeply, you can taste it fully long after youâ€™ve swallowed. Well-crafted and unique in subtle ways.","farrago","Jan 07, 2012"

I thought it would get better once food arrived but it made everything taste worse. The bitterness stuck with me for quite a wile. I like hops but donâ€™t like a sharp bitter taste to linger for a long time. I would not get this beer again.

The retention is great and it leaves lacing on the glass as it slowly recedes to a splotchy layer on top of my beer. This is a beautiful beer. The smell did not impress me as much. The nose is a warm malty smell that is sort of nutty. The taste starts malty and finishes with an odd bitterness, not odd in a bad way, just different. The mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation.

Not a typical red as the hop presence is really pronounced and gives off a dry, almost pale ale vibe with the crisp backbite, but really enjoyable and does contain a good amount of sweet malt as well - the caramel/sugariness is pronounced in the middle of this beer and there is a roasted presence in the finish.

The flavors were at first quite malty, toasted with hints of caramel, spices and nuts before it became hoppy and bitter with hints of citrus rind. Long bitter finish. Terrific balance and a pleasant curve from one end of the spectrum to the other. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation perfect and the body medium full. This one really impressed me.

Super caramelesque taste with strong hops in the beginning that gives way to some rich, coffee style maltiness, then finishes bitter again at the end and lingers. This is a seriously complex taste that I didn't expect from this brew at all. I slept on Rogue brewery for a while, but this and Dead Guy Ale have really turned me into a Rogue fan.

Smooth, thick-bodied brew with a deep malty character that starts out with slight caramel sweetness, earth, spice, toffee and finishes hop dry. A great balance between the two creates a personality that makes this beer stand ahead of the rest. This should be the American staple beer: this is a beer that deserves to be guerilla advertised between Geico cavemen and Chevy truck commercials.

Turns out the American Amber is... whelming. Nice color, similar to other amber or copper beer, such as Otter Creek's amber ale, with a decent, but not great head. A nice pile of up-front maltiness before the hops hit, and bitterness similar to an IPA but much creamier. More malt at the back end to balance the bitterness.

Taste has moderate hop bitterness right up front but decent malt backbone with a touch of sweetness to balance it out.

For example, compared to Southern Tier's Big Red, this sample paled in comparison with regards to flavor and character... don't get me wrong - this is still an excellent depiction of the style, with the typical Rogue quality very apparent and a strong, crisp, clean, and clear mouthfeel with excellent drinkability due to the relatively modest 5.6% ABV...

Had a nice hop bite to go with the good base flavor. Good bitterness that fades perfectly before the next pull. Mouthfeel was solid and creamy.

First is the malt with its breadiness, sweetness, and toastiness along with hints of the fruity esters that I typically get from the Pacman yeast.

Rich malt--roasted coffee--in the nose and the same in the mouth. But not bitterly so. Actually a very enjoyable taste. Mostly rich malt with hops flavors of various types that, rather than meld into a single spice or fruity flavor, actually pop in and out, almost as if changing along the way down the glass. The complexity of flavors is most welcome and enjoyable. One obvious hop note adds a strange, "hot" spice that I can't quite place.

3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"22 oz bottle into a mug. Solid red color (amber for the expert), with two fingers of white head on top. Interestingly opaque-clear, depending on your perspective. Looks pretty good. Nose is mostly sweet malty, with light hop hints. Caramel comes through strong. Fairly mild, overall. Taste is, again, mostly malty. Caramel and toffee, with a good amount of molasses. Subtle hoppy hints show up later, but this is definitely a malt beer. Feel is a little to thin for me, with carbonation just a touch to high. Not bad, but nothing special. Not sure what to think of this one overall. It's definitely not bad, but I'm not sure if it lands up there with the Rogue's stouts I've had of late. This one's a very sweet beer, although that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's tasty, although not really complex or too interesting in terms of the hop character. Not bad, a solid and tasty (although definitely not mind-blowing) beer that'll have you coming back for another sweet beer or two.","soupyman10","Mar 28, 2007"

Nose is a great struggle of malts: biscuity, plummy, pale, and roasted. A bit surprising that there isn't a more pronounced hop presence on the nose, but change is nice too. Yeasty . . . more than anything else as I drink this I'm getting to appreciate Rogue's proprietary Pacman yeast strain, it's prominent here the way Ringwood is elsewhere, but to a generally more favorable result. The malt complexity from the nose is here and is made even more enjoyable by the quality of the yeast: notes of red grapes, strawberries, ripe golden plums, and more of that biscuity malt. Not altogether dry, but there's some dryness here to balance out the juicy malt - rather low bitterness, but nice mildy citric hop qualities in the aromatics. Great mouthfeel, smooth and creamy with a rather full-bodied feeling yet not overly thick, quite a trick to pull off! Very good drinkability also. Next time I enjoy this it's going to be with something from the kitchen, as this struck me as a great beer to accompany food.","Chaz","Jan 22, 2007"

What I don't much care for is the schitzophrenic nature that the hops play against the malts. There are basically two beers in one--an IPA and an Amber. Though neat, it's a little muddy to me. The tap version seems to let the carbonation and keg-sized volume to polish off of the harsh hop edges, add creaminess, and blend the beer better.

Lots of fruitiness comes in at the middle, including grapefruit and apricot. The hops are both flavorful and bitter. This is quite hoppy for an amber ale. The finish is a bit spicy.

It has a lot of British character, while still sporting a generous amount of US hop varieties. This beer is really drinkable, but the entire presentation seems like it would benefit from having an imperial counterpart. I think that if you just brought the malt bill up by like 1/4 to 1/3, but leave the hops the same...that you would have a really nice American stock ale.

There is also a very faint sweetness. After such a powerful nose, I was expecting to barely be able to swallow this beer, but it's considerably easy to drink. Complex hops and the citrus bitterness are delightful, but personally, I think that either they should be taken down a notch or else the sweetness (present at the very beginning and end) should be bumped up to ensure better balance...preferably the former. Not my favorite of the ever-joyable Rogue creations, but still, a great choice.","Opethsprite","Jul 26, 2005"

The beer contains a large malt sweetness, with lots of caramel, accompanied by some light graininess and brown sugar. The hops are clear, balanced, with a gentle crispness. Perhaps an element of tea. The mouthfeel is smooth, nearly flat. This is a fine beer, and amongst Rogue's strong offerings it's a good sessional, quite close to a dark ESB.

Smell is nicely balanced between a big hop presence and a sweet biscuity maltiness that has a little caramel twinge to it. I didn't dig the flavor as much. How such a balanced smell could be followed with such an unbalanced taste baffles me. I could barely taste the malt presence at all; in my opinion it was way too hoppy for the style. It tasted more like an APA or an IPA with a huge wave of Cascade flavor. I'm a hophead, so it didn't bother me as much as it surprised me. I really feel like a little less hop and a little more malt could make this one hugely better.

4.05,5.7,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark gold, copper color. The head is light tan. It had reasonably good head retention. It leaves thick laces on the glass. It smells slightly hoppy. It smells spicy and floral also. There is a very slight malt smell. It tastes moderately hoppy with a caramel flavor to it. It tastes spicy also. Maybe a little floral. It is just a little too carbonated. It is a medium bodied beer that goes down smooth for the most part. This beer is a great session beer because it s not very strong in alcohol. Also the flavors are subtle and do not overwhelm your senses. Ultimately, this is a preaty good beer and worth a try. If you like amber ales, you will definately like this one.","OStrungT","Mar 09, 2005"

The taste is so smooth and well-rounded. The malt is pleasant and perfect for a night by the fire or in the summer heat with a BBQ. This beer works well in all situations. The hop is underscored, but that is good in this case, subtle but effectively done, beer goes good with BBQ, pork chops and rice a must with this beer.

Quite a bit of roasted malt, with a touch of coffee-like character that mixes well with a good dose of spicy and bitter hops. Certainly enough of the resiny "flowers" for some "hop burps." The mouthfeel is a bit thin and most of the carbonation seems to have left this beer as it was poured. Could use some more body and some head retention, but this is still a fairly robust ale and I do like it. The roasted character is unique and might put off some amber ale drinkers, but I like it -- add some black patent malt and you'd have a hoppy dry stout!","marcobrau","Nov 07, 2004"

Hops didn't seem as strong as other reviewers indicated, and seemed mainly to help balance the flavor profile. The finish is sweet and lingers in my mouth.

But there was a good amount of sweet caramel taste and a toasted biscuit base to keep the bitterness in check. The finish has more hoppiness but it's more flavorful and less bitter and it lingers for quite some time. The flavors mix really well but aren't the smoothest.

Fairly simple smell but it is a fitting and pleasant one. Fairly hoppy in taste with both earthy and citric hops playing over caramel malt back bone.

The taste is big for an amber, with prodigious, citric bitterness dominating before a smooth, biscuity finish that carries heavily minerally notes.

Upon a smooth start, malts are immediately noticeable on the pallet. Some caramels and maybe just a touch of fruitiness is present, yet the malt sweetness is not overbearing. Some roasted notes make their way into the mix around mid swallow and hops round out a smooth finish quite nicely along with a bit of additional roasted bitterness.

Light tan head, retains impressively well and leaves a good bit of lace. Fresh aroma of spicy, earthy, and slightly estery hops with some grainy malt. An excellent aroma in my opinion. Very spicy hops with a rind-like bitterness in the taste. Balanced to perfection with grain-like malt. A bit of a fruity undertone and a bready finish.

Terrific huge, potent noseÂ… sweet toffee, alcohol, candy with citrus hops hints. Inviting! Tasty palate! Well-blended with a mix of sweet caramel, alcohol, candy, dark fruits and straight-up hops which are bitter and citrusy. Complex with layers of depth (both in the nose and taste). The maltiness dominates upfront and would overwhelm if not for the hops at the finishÂ… very well brewed. Medium-full body with brief moments of thinness, distant carbonationÂ… good mouthfeel.

Taste is wonderful as it starts with the cascade hops and is then followed by a very balanced blend of Goldings and a roasted malt flavor. Clean finish and a balanced body that is surprising due to the high carbonation. Very little carbonic bite makes this a very nice session beer as well as a good beer to pair with food.","RenoZymurgist","Aug 16, 2003"

Mouthfeel lighter in body but not thin healthy amount of carbonation just chill with a bomber of this stuff it does a body good.

Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a seltzer-like quality to it at times. This amber prominently displays a fruitiness to it, unlike any amber I've ever had in the past. Flavors of sweet malt, raisin and caramel dominate the palate. A refreshing hop bitterness kicks in towards the end which cuts through some of the beer's own fruitiness. Hops aren't as prominent as in other Rogue products. Definitely more flavorful than other ambers I've tried in the past. Dominance of the ale's fruitiness is definitely unique for this amber.","Winter","Jul 25, 2003"

The sweet maltiness takes on your tastebuds with the caramel flavors coming through noticeably. The hops make their presence known at the end of each sip.

Hops kick in as the beer passes over the back of the tongue. An interesting mix of flavor. Hop flavor lingers....and lingers....and lingers.... like a hangover.

There's a definite strong bite from the hops, but the maltiness is noticeable too. Hops win in the end for a pleasant crisp aftertaste. A very solid offering by Rogue.

The nose displays grassy, floral, and lightly citrusy hops (Cascade and EKG?) over some toffee-ish malt. The body is medium; and combines with a very fine, median carbonation to leave it mildly crisp and then somewhat creamy in the mouth. The flavor showcases a rich, mildly sweet and lightly toasty caramel malt that's exquisitely balanced by bold hop bitterness and vibrant hop flavor. This beer is almost alive in your mouth! It finishes dry with a rousing flash of hop bitterness and some lingering malt and hop. Very nicely done! It's straight-forward, and not really complex; but fairly rich in flavor.

The aroma consists of strong caramel, some pleasant nuttiness, and spicy hops. The flavor is nicely balanced between dark caramel, toffeeish malts and some spicy and mildly citric hops.

4.18,9.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Murky ruby in color, with a half-finger, very persistent creamy head. Aroma is dominated by caramel and toffee malt -- much sweeter than I expected, but with a aggressive and fairly unusual hop aroma -- rindy citrus and earthy. In the mouth, the beer is quite smooth and fairly creamy, on the full side of medium-bodied. Flavor starts off sweet, with crystal malt again dominating with toffee and caramel notes. Mid-way through the malt flavor becomes just a *bit* roasty, and then the Kent Goldings and Cascades kick in for a very bitter finish. This beer is balanced, I suppose, but in a very unusual way -- the malt completely dominates during the actual sip, but the aftertaste is so bitter that you almost have a hard time believing you ever tasted anything sweet in the beer.

Smooth and mysterious malt first impression attenuated by hop that starts big and end more floral.  Sense of some nutmeg as well.

Much like the tabloids or candy bars you see at the grocery checkout stand, this beer was sitting there, yelling at me, stating such words as "suck me until I'm dry". So, who am I to deny such words from a Rogue beer. In fact, I'm glad it did spoke to me. Had I not seen it trying to look innocent and heard it speak such perverse vocabulary at me, I never would have given it a second look. Now, that I got it home and popped its top, I'm about to enter ale greatness. The deep, dark 'tawny' amber color with it's beautiful head was more than inviting for my mouth to dive in and taste the delicious contents beneath it. As my lips joined the tasty liquid, a coffee aroma enlivened the nose. The full flavor was outstanding. Good overall ale in my opinion. So, if you to hear a perverted beer shout out at you, it's probably Rogue's American Amber Ale. So do the patriotic thing and obey it's commands and drink it dry.","sinistersteve","Sep 12, 2002"

It's very smooth going down with a little of that hop bite lingering at the back of the throat. This is one hopped-up amber which is easy to drink.

Specifically I pick up some caramel maltiness and slight citrus-rind like hop aroma.  This medium bodied brew also exhibits a nice blend of malt and hops.  The scale may be tipped slightly in favor of the hops.  (Hell, this brew's got an IBU over 50.  Not bad for an amber.)  It's really a nice tasting amber because even though it is highly hopped, you can find the malt profile easily and it is firm.  Good caramel malt backbone provides a great backdrop for the hops to do their stuff.  That would be providing a nice bitterness and slight citrus-like accents.  Very easy drinking.

Dark caramel & toasty malt aroma coupled w/ combination of a citrusy & floral hop nose. Signature copious use of crystal malt in the grist lends significant sweetness, but since the hop bitterness is high, sufficient malt / hop balance is acheived.

In typical Rogue fashion there is a huge nose of floral cascade hops that is off set by a hint of malt sweetness.  Nice caramel maltiness starts off in the mouth and turns into a slightly biscuity type flavor.  The hops are hanging in the background while the malty smoothness is presented.  Towards the end the hops jump in front and finish the brew off leaving a nice lingering bitter finish.  Smooth maltiness dominates the first half of the beer before it finished dry and crisp.

4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Bomber bottle. Red/red-orange with brown highlights body. Good looking carbonation. Big frothy off-white head. I like a head that when you pour additional beer in, it leaves a dent. Good lacing. Enormous Cascade/grapefruit nose. Do not be misled. Strong malt presence balances hop onslaught. Malt flavors at beginning of sip, finishing with hop tingle and citric aftertaste. Extremely drinkable. Definitely hoppier than the typical Amber, more like an American Pale (but not an IPA). Another fine brew from John Maier.","RonfromJersey","Jul 04, 2002"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a nice dark amber color.  It formed a nice light tan head that held and formed some nice lace.  A slight aroma of hops and malt. Flavor of malt, coffee and some slight carmel sweetness.   A good deal of carbonation for this style.  A bit of bitterness in the aroma and the finish/taste.","Wildman","Jun 23, 2002"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours with a large very light tan head, settling into a dark amber/light ruby liquid. Nose is clean malt with slight coffee notes. First taste is dry with medium bitterness coming through. Finish is quick and hoppy. Due to its relatively light body, it's quite easy to drink.","beerluvr","Jun 22, 2002"
4.04,5.5,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Lighter amber color with a good amount of visible carbonation, this amber ale presents with a lightly roasted coffee aroma and hops, always with Rogue, HOPS.  Clean refreshing feel with a twinge of bitter in the finish.  A good drinkable brew.  A 22 oz. bottle goes down like a 12er.  Nice.","beernut7","Jun 09, 2002"
3.68,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It's a dark brick red that is a nice color. There was no head except little traces around the edge of the glass and maybe a little flat. Good hops to the smell - flowery and a bit bitter. It has the taste of apple peels that I'm starting to expect from this type of beer. The taste was actually very similar to Molings, except witht the strong hopping you expect from Rogue. Not one of their best beers, but still good. I picked up a little of the odor and taste of a dishrag gone sour towards the end. That's going to lower the score a bit.","aracauna","Apr 04, 2002"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: This brew could also be considered as a brown ale due to its deep colour and roasted flavours. Great cold season session brew with a hot pot of beef stew.","Jason","Apr 02, 2002"
4.33,13.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Another winner from Rogue. A high level American Amber with a touch more hop aroma. Drinkable with a fine meal or all night long.","inebrius","Feb 27, 2002"
4.6,20.1,4,4,5,4,5,"Smooth and tremendously drinkable.  I was surprised at how much flavor the hops had, relative to the moderate degree of bittering.  The label referenced a coffee aroma, but I got none.  Either a very hoppy amber, or a very amber pale ale.  Energizer bunny head (kept going and going and . . . ).  Quality from start to finish.","Brent","Dec 26, 2001"
