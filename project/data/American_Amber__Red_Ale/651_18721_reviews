"A good to very good beer.  Red in color with a  one finger head that reduces to a film of bubbles covering the enter top of the beer throughout.  Liked the flowery hoppy backbone.  Needed more IPA type punch.  Smell of flowery hops and a bit of malt.  Solid Red IPA.  Smooth."
"O-Modestly above standard commecial beers.  I was hoping for more punch"

"an enormous hoppy red beer that ive been way too sick on one too many times in life, but every time i go back to it i cant help being impressed with it. its a frothy feeling beer, only a touch sweet from the red grain, and super hoppy like a west coast ipa. its got a real cascade hop profile, and is both oily and bitter at the same time. the beer has a sticky feel with its big body and all these hops, but it finishes rather dry for what it is. if you arent a totally gung-ho hop head, this beer probably isnt for you. its a total hop overdose, and even a couple of these will have you feeling silly. this was way ahead of its time i think, and is only now starting to get recognition for being the beast that it is. not ithacas best, but certainly one of me more distinctive india pale ales on the market."

"O- I had this beer last summer and really didnt stand out to me.. its not a bad beer by any means but there are alot better red ipas out there.. i recommend it to people who like malty ipas.."

"A very good beer, that is a solid example of the style, with an intense hop profile that steals the show, and enough malt to counter-balance the intense bitterness. Not terribly ""drinkable"" per se, since the alcohol is pretty high here, but it is good for a round or two. It would pair well with some carrot cake for sure!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-maybe its bias since I grew up a half hour from Ithaca, but I really enjoyed this beer. despite the past BB date. I haven't had a ton of Red IPAs, but I enjoyed the added malt that was present. a ton of flavor and very drinkable."

"Well worth trying, really nice mix of flavours, all balanced really well, complexity opens up really well. Just a well put together beer that offers a very good example of what a Red IPA can be all about. Very nice, would have again. Cascade hops work really well here, citrus and florals come through strongly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced, but slightly pushed back on the hops as in not being extremely hoppy. However, still a good beer with hoppy flavors and a nice malty body."

"Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy reddish amber. Aroma has toasty caramel, light citrus, raisin, and other dark fruits. Taste is sweet caramel and chocolate, plum, and light hop bitterness. Moderate carbonation with a clean finish. Overall, a delicious, well-crafted beer. The main drawback is the malt overwhelms the hop characteristics. There are some complex flavors here with roasted malts, fruity esters, and a nice hop mix."

"o: A very good red IPA, tasty and drinkable. If this is really over a year old, I'm impressed with its staying power."
""
""
""
"O - definitely a good beer, one of my favorite offerings by Ithaca so far. This one strikes a nice balance with its ingredients, rather than their other beers, in which certain ingredients tend to dominate."
"overall, cascazilla is not to big & not too small & they go down nice & easy. it's easy to drink but has some alcohol content. it seems to me like a good candidate to be enjoyed from a heavy pint glass!"
""
"Overall, for a red ipa. i was expecting a lot of malt which a got with a minimal amount of hopping. for the style this is a real nice brew. if i ever see this on tap somewhere i would get it."

"So far Ithaca hasn’t disappointed me. This is a great beer, hoppy but caramel malt is very present in its flavor, not only giving body to sustain its hoppy profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad beer at all. Guessing that it must have been best by October 2013, since I cant't believe hop taste would have hung around for a year. Sediment finally settled (was a long drink), possibly malt? Have enjoyed this on draft in the past, and would have it again. Hopefully with less floaties."

"This is a solid and very drinkable red, but can't quite compete with the top tier reds out there."
"Overall: Very well done red IPA. Nails the malt-hop balance, which can be difficult to do well for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thus, my overall will fall as an inbetween-er: for an amber ale, it's pretty tasty. For an IPA, it's a little disappointing. Yet again, I find myself hoping to get a fresh bottle and see if my opinion changes, or if this is just indicative of the style."

"This is the first, and maybe the last beer that I will have from the Ithaca Beer Company. I might need to chug a Ruthless Rye before I go to bed! Cheers!"

"Poured into a McDonald's collector glass (I'm...away from my glassware at the moment). Deep amber/red with a thin white head that fades into a thin disc of foam. Smell is nice and malty, with a generous helping of hops as well. Taste is bitter and crisp hops, with a clean malt background that has a slightly odd sweet twang to it (horrific memories of Cortland Red Dragon are resurfacing) but it doesn't stay long enough to ruin the beer. Overall I think the hop flavor could be more complex, but it's a fine drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts with pine, then moves to a dark caramel malt, finished with citrus. Has a malty, citrusy aftertaste. Has a moderate/heavy body with slightly above average carbonation for a Red Ale / Red IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good coiffing beer. Nothing amazing about it - not outstanding but not bad at all. Not something I'd buy again (like its cousin - Ithaca Flower Power), but not something I'd scoff at either."
""
"Pours cloudy, amber with ruby highlights. An off white head of creamy foam that fell slowly and left a cap with some fine , sticky lace. Nose is toasted malt, fat, sweet and nutty. There is the faintest whisper of chocolate. Light yeast. Hops are earthy with orange, grapefruit and dark fruits behind that. Light sweet pine and a little dank and oak as it warms. Taste is mellow and malt forward with toasty caramel, bread and grain. Toffee sweetness. Hops are oily and bitter with some light sweet pine, citrus and floral. Body is a little on the heavy side with a little butter and prickly carbonation. Finishes dry with a short lived bitter on the back palate and another whisper from the chocolate as the malt steals the show again to bring it to bittersweet. It’s not boozy but it is rich."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid Red IPA that had all the qualities you look for but nothing exceptional. And not enough hops to be considered a true ""Red IPA."""

"Doesn't hold a candle to Flower Power. Needs some more fruitiness, but the umami notes are delightful."
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent American amber. It has a nice hop flavor blend starting with more of a citrus and developing more of a pine later on."
""
""
""
""
"Powerful and smooth. The color is dark coppery red and the carbonation is very fine and small. So smooth, rich and hoppy. The rich flavor and full body blend wonderfully with the alcohol content so that you would never guess it is as strong as it is. Not until you finish the second beer. The best of Ithaca."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very tasty red. Such a nice springtime beer that is good to drink and share with other red ales."
"One of Ithaca's better beers for sure, love it."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a cloudy reddish amber with a small amount of off white head. The head sticks around more than I would have guessed. The nose has some nice citrus hops in it as well as a touch of malt spice. I found the taste to be more interesting than the smell. The citrus peel hops are stronger and the malt backs them up nicely. I'm also getting a mild fruity undertone. The body is medium and the finish is slightly slick."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - very drinkable. Had it after a Yards Brawler Pugilist, so it came across as much more flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A dusky brownish red with a light covering and some lace. Mild grapefruit and citrus. Caramel sweetness with a toasted whole grain bread underpin. Light yeast fruit esters. Taste is lovely and feel is surprisingly cask like. Mild and smooth hop bitterness with a toasted caramel malt core. An almost English fruitiness in the yeast. No alcohol in the taste. Finish is quite clean and dry with light grapefruit and faint coffee note. Feel is like the name says. Mildly carbonated but perfectly so. Supple and highly drinkable. A super beer that hides its abv well so beer careful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer. I'd like to get a really fresh version of this to re-review it."
"Overall an easy drinking, tasty red ale which a nice hop-malt balance. I'd drink it again but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good hoppy Amber Ale. It’s right at the best-by date so I bet the hops would be really nice if fresher."
"O: A very good example of an American Red ale, I wish it was 6% vs. 7% so I could keep drinking. I'm not usually a fan of this style, but it turns out to be great as the weather gets cold. Given we have a lot more cold ahead of us, I wish I had more of these in the fridge. Worth trying."

"Overall, really dig this, don't care if this is hoppy or not, just a solid good amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent amber ale."
"O-a decent amber ale, but a tad on the sweet side for me and lacking some of the complexity of other ambers (Zoe, Nugget Nectar)"
"Drink- A really nice extra. I could see this being amazing fresher. Always next time."
""
""
""
"O: Good beer -- would love to try this fresh on draft. This drink by date of July. So, should still be good according to label. Not a bad showing by Ithaca. But, just not at the level of Nugget Nectar, which is better."
""
"O: A great beer for those who enjoy earthy, grassy, dank hoppiness and round malting. Not my cup of tea unfortunately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by 5/12 thanks to the guy at the store for putting this together for me so my brother could grab it for me while in Long Island. He either didn't no his stuff or purposely screwed me. Pours a deep amber with a half inch off white head, that leaves some lace. Smell is carmel, pine, apricot, and grass. Taste is similar, with a kind of stale apricot and carmel finish, not bad for being a little old. Body is medium, enough life, not really dry, and drinkable enough. Will edit my review if I have fresh. I have been burned before when having someone pick it up or online orders. This is why I normally avoid getting IPAs or DIPAs with out someone giving the date."
""
""
"o - solid beer but this is one of my favorite styles and it didn't stand up to others i have had."
""
"O: One of the more memorable American reds I've had in a while. This one is right at the end of its optimal freshness period, but it's still drinking very well."
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful beer, not as good as Nugget Nectar but the everyday availability is a huge plus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Believe this is a specific bottle issue - storage or bottling - rather than a recipe issue or problem with the beer itself. Will definitely try again, but may well purchase a single next time..."

"Overall this beer is very good. The smell doesn't do the flavor justice, but in all other aspects the beer is nice."
"This beer was served in a pint glass, it had a amber color body with 2"" tan head. The smell was malty with nice a hop background to it. The taste is of bitter hops and some malt and fruit notes on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel was nice a smooth and overall a really good beer."
""
""
"O-very solid offering from Ithaca"
"Age is no friend to this beer, as is my experience with the bottled version."
""
"I've had better red ales, but I really like what Ithaca did here. I just have the same issues I have with Flower Power. This needs to dry out. Otherwise, it's adequately interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-i thought this one going to be one of those red ales that borderline an IPA, but its definitely more of a red ale. its slightly complex, and sort of balanced, but i'm just not a huge fan of this. it doesn't have a lot going for it."
"Overall: Pretty good, not as smooth but I'm not complaining. Made to be something comfortable enough that you'll to really like it but not enough to call great. Hope you all enjoyed. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a good beer that is drinkable with nice flavor, mouthfeel. It is really easy to drink and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a just off-white head. A nice citrus hop quality to this one. Orange and grapefruit hops with a nice bit of piney hop character, too. Under that is a fair amount of caramel and sweet malt. The flavor is a bit on the sweeter side, but there still is some good citrus and pine hop flavor and bite to it, just a moderate bitterness. Medium in body and carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: the best parts about this beer were the parts that i put a little else stock in, scent and taste were just off putting and unpleasant, not the best one from ithaca, actually, the worst one ive had from them"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Price Point - $1.99/12oz single"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - One of the better beers that Ithaca makes for sure. As much as I enjoy their Flower Power I think that this might be the best beer I've had from them. I'm looking forward to drinking the rest of my 6 pack."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Very hazy redish color with a creamy khaki colored head. Remarkable head retention. Smell is surprisingly lacking. My nose is literally in the head and I can't smell a thing. At least it's clean and not bad smelling. Flavor is very familiar. Solid bitterness, not scorching or lingering. Body supports hoppiness of the beer, thin-medium w/ light sweetness. Sugar is caramelized - dark flavored. Minimal malt character. Hops are as advertised very ""cascadie", with a citrus-grapefruit-must flavor. I enjoy this beer much more on the cooler side. Not surprised by the ABV, it does have an overall booziness. Fortunately, I'm a sucker for Big Hopped Red Ales. I would love to have a freshy from closer to the brewery, this one might be a touch old."

"Not really a hoppy beer, but a good example of a red, nonetheless. Easily consumed and leaves room for another."
""
""
"O: I think this may be old, maybe not fair to review it under these conditions, but I'll be revisiting this when I can assure it's fresh."
""
""
"This beer pours a nice dark mahogany color. It has a finger of light tan head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves a sheet of sticky lace behind on the glass. The nose is of caramel malts and juicy fruits up front. There are some piney hop aromas that come out as well. Also, there are some notes of toffee, citrus, and a bit of earthiness. The taste starts off with some nice toasted malt flavor. There is also some good flavors of caramel, toffee, and there is a nice bit of fruitiness. There is some earthiness and a nice mild hop presence that comes through as well. The finish leaves a bit of lingering sweetness and mild hop bitterness. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a smooth feel to it. There is some good sweetness here that is nicely balanced out by the mild hop bitterness. There is some earthiness as well. There is some good drinkability here. I could easily drink a six pack of this. The flavor is really nice and it never gets boring. Overall, I think this is a really nice beer, and a good representation of the style. I enjoyed this one and I definitely recommend trying it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this is a decent beer all around. Not something I would regularly stock in my fridge, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered. A solid B-B+."

"A VERY well done red ale. CASCAZIRRA!!!"
"A great beer from Ithaca, always a good call."
"A bit maltier than my preference, but still a solid beer."
"Overall (3.5): I’m a little surprised, honestly. I’ve had CascaZilla a number of times in the past, and enjoyed it enough that I’ve considered it something of a sleeper. This was good, but not exactly what I remember. I’ll still buy it in the future, because I’ve got faith in you, Mr Zilla."
"O- not bad but a little bit off. Hop profile is great but the malt struggles to come through. Not bad but could be better"
"Overall: I've always enjoyed beers from Ithaca and this beer is no exception."
"WELL DONE, GIVE IT A GO!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of citrus and hoppy bitter notes is quite pleasant. Taste is a nice mix between some citrus and bitter hops with a solid dry caramel malt with limited sweetness and light resinous notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Easily drinkable and a bit more complex then a plain bitter attack on the palate."
"Overall Drinkability - Pleasantly surprised by this beer."
"A nice red ale. Nice hop profile without being a bitter hop bomb, good malt balance."
"O: Very drinkable, great hop aroma and flavor, feels wonderful, and looks fantastic. One of my new favorites."
"O: I like this. It's bold, unique and makes its presence known. With a little more integration it could go from good to stellar."
"O: Not bad. not my favorite from the brewery at all. I think maybe this would be better a few weeks younger."
"Overall - I really wish I had more of this. I'm not always in the mood for reds/ambers, but apparently today I am. I could drink many many more of these and just continue to enjoy them. Of the amber/reds I have tried to date, this one is very high up on my list. A definite must try, in my mind. Cheers!"
"Pours a murky brown with a half inch of creamy, tan head that fades moderately. Lacing is excellent. Aroma is earthy, with hints cherrys, oak, and lemon peel. Mouthfeel is slightly dry and fairly rich. Taste is bitter, earthy, moderately hoppy, with a lingering piney taste. Yum."
"Drinkability is good, solid hoppy red ale that is a great offering."
"Overall, a decent beer. I wouldn't seek it out specially, but it would be a good beer to have with food."
"One of my favorite Ithaca brews. I will recommend this to those who are worthy."
" Even though I couldn't taste the alcohol in this, this still felt like a heavy beer. The carbonation is just right but it doesn't detract from the long-lasting finish that isn't enjoyable and the toasty and hoppy aspects of this beer that don't quite work well together. This is probably a textbook of the style but nothing more..."
"Pretty good beer, but not as balanced as I had thought or wanted. Drinks a bit like a pale ale in a way with the hops."
"D-not a bad beer. I bit too hoppy for my taste in relation to the style. I would have it again but with reservations."
"This beer is my Ithaca go-to beer and has provided me with satisfaction every time I've consumed it. I have tried many beers trying to incorporate strong hoppiness with rich malt (ie. Black IPAs), but this one is obviously different from the others. For the affordability of this beer, I would say it's worth trying a six pack at least once. However, it is superior served in a cask or growler."
"Pours a deep ruby brown color with a thinnish beige head that dissipates to form a ring on top. Smell is nicely balanced between malt and hop. Grapefruit and citrus meet caramel and brown sugar. A tried and true combination because it works so well. Taste is malty with darker sugar and caramel jumbled together with citrus and grapefruit. Slight mineral water type bite midway through with a long lingering citrus bitterness. Moderate level of carbonation and a medium body. Seven percent abv is nowhere to be found. Great brew, I'm glad I picked up six."
"SkÅL!"
"D: A pretty fine and robust red ale. Not quite imperial at 7.0% abv, but hefty enough and a little bit sneaky. Interesting and nicely drinkable, and a good East Coast does West Coast take."
"Pours a cloudy reddish-brown with minimal head. Caramel and nutty malts come through on the nose with a some mild hops coming through as well. Taste is a nice balance of malt and citrusy hops with a nice nutty finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth; well carbonated. I rather enjoyed this amber ale, will probably have it again in the future."
"O - This is a nice amber ale. It's hoppy, it's malty it's nutty, it has so many different angles it pulls you in after every sip. I like the thickness and the lacing."
"O: The beer is easy to drink because it has a good balance and the hops prevent it from becoming overly sweet, despite all of the caramel and malty flavors. No traces of alcohol are perceptible in the taste."
"Mouthfeel is relatively light and bubbly for 7%abv. Overall, I'm enjoying this red ale but need to grab a fresher bottle next time. Still, even at a few months old the flavor holds on well and stands out from many a boring red/amber ale."
"Good stuff Ithaca!"
"O: A good, but not great, red ale. Not as hop forward as I was expecting."
"O- A nice beer overall, and recommended if you haven't checked it out. Glad I got to try this one."
"O - Great beer overall. I enjoyed my sampler pack from Ithaca, but this is the type of beer I would only have one of in a night."
"The Rest: This is an old standby that I've had dozens of times but just never reviewed. For me, this is a good local, reasonably priced way to get a dank hop kick."
"O: Overall, this is a really well done Red that is good just about any time of the year. Yet another stellar offering from Ithaca."
"O- decent brew worth trying, good balance of malt and hops, at first I thought the caramel malts would be overwhelming but not at all."
"I guess for a beer called Casca Zilla I was expecting a bigger hop bite, but upon reflection - as a red ale, it's pretty solid."
"The CPJ"
"The pour of this beer is a nice looking red color with decent tan head on top. The smell has a really good hoppy aroma with some sweet caramel on the nose. The taste gives off a nice sweet flavor at first is kind of semi sweet with a pleasant hoppy bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium and rather enjoyable. It's a good brew, it's worth trying again."
"O - A very out of balance brew. Not one I would pour out, but flavor is slightly all over the place. A good brew, just missing a few pieces."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors all mingle really nicely and the hop malt balance feels spot on. There is a nice balance of sweet malt and some deeper bread malts that mix well."
"Overall this is a very solid brew but not excellent. I would like to try this one again in the future. Very good."
"O - Well done but I wouldn't trade it for a Nugget Nectar or Hop Rod Rye."
"A good red ale. Even though I live in New York, it seems tough to find this one very fresh. I'm curious to see how the hops are then."
"Attracted by the name alone, I had this beer on tap for the first time a few weeks ago and haven't been able to quit it yet. It pours an amber color without much head. The Cascazilla smells malty and toasted and it tastes like hop heaven. f'ing delicious!"
"Overall, well done brew, slight tilt to the hop side, but a good roasted/biscuit malt followup."
"Pours a brownish orange, with 3+ fingers of fluffy, lofty offwhite head. Great retention, loads of lacing. Nose has big citrus and grapefruit hops. Loafs of toffee and caramel goodness to balance it out, feels prototypical of the style in my eyes. Taste leads with the malt, caramel again, and fades into some indiscriminate citrus. Flavour finishes again malty, with more caramel notes. Some bitterness lingers. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Balance in this one is towards to malt, but I think I wanted a bit more hop flavour and 'bite' out of this one. Enjoyable, but left something to be desired."
"Overall: A good brew of this style. Nothing too interesting but not bland by any means. A solid beer, definitely a must-try for red ale lovers."
"The mouthfeel is a touch on the sticky side, but the medium body has enouygh carbonation from being slick to a flaw. Overall, this is a very enjoyable brew when it's this green. Fear not, beer drinking people. This monster won't be toppling over buildings in your city any time soon. It's not that fierce. But it is a great cross-over take on a hoppy American Red ale and one I'll be seen swigging any time it's fresh."
"O - A solid red and easy to drink. Hoppy and smooth."
"O - A basic straight-forward red ale. ABV is hidden well. Easy to drink but not overly interesting."
"Third beer of the night last night at the Yard House, Dedham, as my drink with my dinner. Served on tap into a pint glass. Dark reddish orange color. Not much head. Mix of hops and malt in the nose. Taste was pretty straight forward. Malty body, with a hit of hops at the end on the palate. Mouthfeel was smooth, and hid the 7% abv sort of well. Overall this beer was good with my burger, but really just seemed like an average red ale. I guess I had higher expectations due to the reputation I've heard about this beer in the past."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle (no date stamp) into a snifter glass at a local restaurant in DC which was a pleasant surprise as Ithaca beers are seldomly found in the DC area. Pours a hazy red-brown color with a two to three finger creamy head of off-white to light tan colored bubbles, there is some effervescence in the glass and retains nice lacing throughout the session. There were aromas of citrus, pine and grapefruit hops with lots of caramel and malt, a good amount of caramel & dark honey sweetness as well. Flavors consisted of caramel, piney hops with caramel, light bread and grain malt. Has some good hop bitterness on the palate after the finish and give a good drying on the tongue. Mouthfeel is about medium with a bit of carbonation through out, a nice IPA with generous caramel accents. A nice upgrade over the more popular Flower Power in my opinion."
"O - Another winner from Ithaca, but not even close to Flower Power."
"D- Very easy to drink and will return if vapodge graces me again or if I'm able to pick it up elsewhere"
"Mouthfeel /Drinkability - As stated, quite musty. Drinkability is high. But there were actually solid chunks of yeast that got stuck in my teeth. It just sort of tastes like a musty, slight sour and mellowed red ale. On my list of red ales, this is very low."
"Answer is Ithaca Cascazilla. Another tasty treat from Ithaca, not quite as spectacular as Flower Power but still a solid brew. I wouldn't complain one bit if this was on tap at a local watering hole."
"D- No alc. Really easy to drink. I only bought a single to try but would have had kept drinking this if had more."
"Pours a very ugly muddy copper color with a brownish hue. Short off-white head comes and goes quickly and leaves a touch of lacing behind. The nose brings forward some piney and citrus hops along with a bit of sweet bready malt. The flavor is fairly hoppy, though there's too much sweetness falling in behind it. Mouthfeel is medium with adequate carbonation. Good bitterness in the finish, though again it's too sweet. Pretty drinkable and I'd have it again, though not likely something I would purchase again."
"Enjoyed this one fresh on tap at the comfortable confines of the Chapter House in Ithaca. From the pint glass this shows a slightly orange-ish brown wth a fair light oatmeal colored head that leaves a nice trail of lace. The aroma offers a pleasing malt vinegar and citrus brightness. The flavor is mellow caramel malt with a nice citrus bite that finishes bright with solid carbonation for a tingly and somewhat chalky feel. There's some grassiness to it, toffee and a vague smoke hidden in there. Just a very drinkable hoppy brew that is refreshing and satisfying. Nice to finally try it on tap."
"refreshingly smooth on the palate. surprisingly drinkable. for something being advertised as ""monstrously hoppy"" I was gearing up for it."
"Deep malty amber color - I've had this beer in many ways (btl, tap, and tap at the brewery). Have never been disappointed. This is a hoppy beer, much more mellow and balanced than Flower Power. The maltiness is a good match for the level of hops, but that seems to be its only purpose, to help tone down the hops a bit. A better food beer than Flower Power I think."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I am not a man of many hops and this beer is one of the many that I tried that I am enjoying."
"Sampled from a 12oz bottle with a best by March 2011 on the label. Poured a murky, brownish-red with a brief off-white head. The foam reduced quickly, but left a healthy cap for the duration. Sweet malty aromas with a hint of maple syrup and mellow, floral hops. Medium bodied, with a resinous feel and assertive carbonation. Malty sweetness in the beginning, again with a hint of maple syrup. The flavor slowly transitions from sweet to hoppy from beginning to end. Floral hop flavors through the middle with a bitter pine hop finish. The bitter finish tends to linger for a while."
"Easy to drink and pleasurable."
"D: I never would have guess Amber on this one. I would have said ESB due to the lack of sweetness and bitter front end. However, this was a very nice drinker..."
"D- Damn fine beer."
"Overall very drinkable, once you get beyond the chunks of stuff floating in your glass."
"Cascazilla is an easy drinking, flavorful, well-constructed beer. What it lacks in complexity or various ""wow factors", it makes up for with near flawlessness in most areas. The kind of beer that would be one of the ones that come to mind if I needed to illustrate to someone what American craft beer is."
"Nonetheless, it is still very drinkable and worth trying."
"D - Well I don't really like it and would maybe get a fresh bottle but I believe I can find more hoppy brews so it's just OK in my book."
"This one may get lost in the shadow of Flower Power, but this one stands on its' own. I've always been a fan. Great beer from a great brewery. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light and very carbonated. this is a very drinkable beer at 7%"
"D-Easy drinking but not a terribly thought-provoking, or interesting beer."
"This is a hop-forward amber with the cascade really bringing the hop complexity to the beer. It's not as big and hoppy as Nugget Nectar but it's in the same vein."
"D: This is well put together, but not necessarily a top beer of the style. However, I loved this beer and would pick this up regularly."
"Drinkability is good. This is a tasty and complex beer, but I wish it had a thicker body. Still good stuff."
"Clearly this beer was brewed to be more muscular than its name implies. I'm a fan!"
"The Cascazilla has a wide variety of flavor. quite unique. malty, hoppy, sweet and bitter all in one. Some strong flavors but they make a great flavor."
"Overall- Edge to the hops here, throwing off the balance a bit. But, it is Cascazilla and was designed in this fashion. Not bad!"
"I liked the flavor but I thought it could use more hops. Maybe the keg I sampled from had been around a while but I expected more."
"One or two is all I'd drink of this. It's a good red ale, but nothing too special."
"It's okay - no stand-out qualities (though the 7% hardly seemed to show up in any facet - notable, I suppose) - a cheap six-pack beer (provided I can sniff it out cheap). But, really, it was a one-pint stand."
"I experienced the ""Cascazilla"" with my favorite sausage pizza and was very satisfied with how well they both got along. Into a pint glass, this poured a dark amber color with a slight red hue and carried a light sweet malt and citrus blended nose. It opened up with a mildly sweet taste into a malty center before ending with a light grapefruit bitter aftertaste. Nice balance and complexity in general and a great carbonated mouthfeel to cleanse the palate for that next bite of pizza. I'll be revisiting this again soon..."
"Pours a slightly hazy, dark burnt orange. A thick off-white head sticks around big-time. I pick up some pretty decent floral and herbal tones from the smell, as well as some sweet and dark syrupy notes. Nice and complex. Taste starts off mellow, but quickly twists into a green, minty hops. Thus the feel is cool and smooth. Is that detritus taste from the yeast, ala Mendocino? The hops stay around at the end, along with some earthy barley backing. The malts are kind of subdued on this one - my only complaint. The beer feels just a bit flat and ""round"" as a whole, yet because of the interesting hops, it's pretty tasty. A favorite of the ambers that I've tried."
"M: Full bodied with gentle carbonation. Extremely smooth!"
"This beer reminds me a lot of a Dogfish IPA, particularly 90 Minute. A lot of my friends love Dogfish 90. I'd recommend this beer to any of them. But much like Dogfish 90 (and most East Coast IPAs, for that matter), this one just isn't for me."
"Drinkability is only fair, because the flavors are really unique, but I can't imagine coming back to this again and again. While this brew wasn't really what I was expecting, it blends some interesting flavors, and some new ones I'd never experienced. Pick it up once, anyway."
"Unique to me. Happy to try it."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, and some caramel malt. Taste is just like the aroma, it's all pine/citrusy hops and caramel malt. There's good balance between the hops and malt, and there's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, I think it's easy and enjoyable to drink. I think it's a good beer, I'd buy this again."
"Overall, I really like this beer. I liked it when I first had it on tap and now I like it in just different ways. Where it was malty, now it is hoppy. Ithaca is capable of great things (Flower Power, Cascazilla) but also some nasty crap (Apricot Wheat), but never fear! This is one of the greater ones. Cheers!"
"Overall this is a decent but not memorable red ale. I could have another one or just as easily pass on it, on second thought pass all together."
"M/D: Medium bodied and on the creamy side. Very nice carbonation. Overall pretty good, very glad to have had it."
"D - Pretty drinkable well balanced beer. I am enjoying this one and wouldn't mind drinking it again but wouldn't seek it out."
"12oz bottle from a variety pack. The beer pours dark amber with an off-white, foamy head. Aroma of caramel malt, cherry fruit with hints of piny hops. Light, crisp body with a piny hops fill the mouth. Caramel malt provide some balance. Long, dry, earthy, hoppy finish"
"Drink well my friends."
"D: I think I found a very good Amber/Red ale. I hope it comes in a 1/6th keg in my area. Very smooth going down. I'm surprised it's a 7%'er, as it tasted much lighter."
"Poured into a pint, Cascazilla is amber colored with a solid inch of white head that lingers a couple minutes, leaving nice lacing. This amber ale has a some nice aromas, pine, citrus, sweet malts, and a bit bready. Tastes is somewhat malt forward, which was unexpected. Sweet and bready upfront, with some citrus in the middle and back. It is a creamy in the mouth, light carbonation, alcohol well hidden. Simply an OK amber ale."
"Pours dark copper to light brown with a tint of amber. It is a bit cloudy. The aroma is of floral hops and a bit of caramel malt. The flavor is of roasted caramel malt and floral hops with a slightly bitter finish. There is a good interplay between the malt and the hops with the hops predominating slightly. There is just a touch of sour in the beer as well. This is an interesting brew."
"Meh."
"Overall, not the best take on the style. A bit too malty for my liking. Not something I want to drink a lot of."
"This is another solid beer from Ithaca and probably their best easily available beer (Flower Power availability can be a bit spotty). I especially enjoy Cascazilla with food; it goes well with beef and pork."
"Reviewed on 26 October 2010, poured into Sierra Nevada XXX snifter, pours a 1-finger head that quickly dissipates. Color is deep orange in the light, enough that it appears brown. Lacing is very good, covering 90% of the glass. I'm assuming that Cascazilla is a portmanteau of cascade (hops) and Godzilla. I'm no expert at hops, but my guess is that cascade hops are important here. Aroma is light in spicy hops, brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of sweet malt with a very basic hop flavor. Bitterness -- not too much, not too little. Carbonation is I'm going into this review a little biased, as I am from Rochester, and LOVE Ithaca Brewing Company. This is one of my favorites from them. It is nothing that deserves to be on center-stage, but certainly a beer that others should check out. If you like an aggressive ~7% beer and like hops, drink this one."
"OVERALL: This beer seems to have been brewed for craft beer aficionados, not the average or casual beer drinker. This is a bold beer drinker's beer."
"Initial grade was a B-... upon further consideration... yeah."
"O - Nice enough, but there are many superior examples out there to spend my money on."
"d- okay, not as good as i was expecting, i had higher hopes for this. i wouldn't pick this up again, i'll stick to nugget nectar."
"Bottle. Pours a clear red gold color with a fluffy slightly off white head. Big aroma of sweet malt and fruit type hops characteristics. Whoa, such a malt bomb! Very sweet up front with a kick of hops in the end that lingers on. Medium mouthfeel and chewy. The balance is just ok with it being just a little too skewed to the malt side but overall not a terrible beer. Slight warming alcohol apparent."
"Future outlook: Decent beer...happy to have tried...probably won't need to repeat."
"Always looking to try a new red. Pours a good red color with decnt head, fades quickly though. Smell is definately cascade hops not piney but sweet. The malt is obvious. Taste is bit weak and fades fast. This beer is good though nice and cold but dont expect it to be as sharp as some better reds. Carbonation level is very good and continues throughout the pint. All in all a good session red as long as its cold."
"hop flavors are like their respective aromas. decent caramel backbone, but not very dynamic."
"Pretty drinkable and a solid imperial amber. I would think about getting this again, but I would also never take this beer over a Nugget Nectar."
"Overall- Not bad. Would more than likely be outstanding fresh- looks like this bottle is a tad on the older side and officially expires this month. Big hop bitterness but not quite as bright flavor-wise as I was expecting with a name like that. Because it falls a little flat on flavor, drinkability is a bit on the lower side. Will seek out a fresh batch or hopefully get a taste on draught and do another review!"
"Pours a dark amber, nice 2 finger of beige head, nice lacing.   I smell caramel malts, slight hips, slight plum.  Tastes are some caramel, toffe, hop finish.   By the name and the label art I thought it was going to be a hop bomb, but it turns out to be extremely balanced and very drinkable.  Reds usually aren't my thing, but I could drink this often."
"drinkable enough."
"A decent brew, but a little heavy on the red ale roasted malt for me. With a name like CascaZilla, I expected it to focus more on the hops."
"Overall a decent beer, the oak and hops play pretty well, tasty, not the best beer in the world but tasty."
"Pretty ruby hue with a moderately sized head. Decent lacing and retention. Nice blast of Cascade hops in the aroma as well as the taste. The initial flavor is very hop forward, followed by a sturdy malt backbone with appropriate sweetness. The feel is great. The alcohol sneaks up on you, as it's hidden quite well. I really enjoyed this beer."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Fairly drinkable for 7%. It has been more than a year since I last had this brew but this is the first time I am reviewing it and it certainly was much different than I remembered it being. Not bad overall, I would drink it again."
"Prost!!!"
"D-This beer is not too hard to drink,strong alchohol.If you like hops you should have no problem with this beer.The red malt is interesting and makes an unusual pair with the hops.a fruity taste tries to poke it's way out but is kept at bay by the hops.I may buy this again when I crave a strong beer with lots of hops."
"I've had the pleasure of enjoying an entire 6er of this and with this being my last one I figured it was time to review. Excellent beer can't wait to get more of these."
"All around, this tends to remind me the most of an ESB, but with an exaggerated hop bitterness focus."
"D - I would only go for one of these in a sitting.. maybe two but they would be a nice thing to grab... i would recommend picking this up if you come across it fresh..."
"D - This is a very drinkable brew with a very confident, hop flavor ... faint ""honey-grain malt"" finish rounds out a really interesting, tasty experience."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Color is a brownish-red. Very little head but some lacing throughout. Nice aroma of citrus, hops and a bit of pine. The taste is very balanced. Flavors of hops, pine and some malts. Not overly bitter, but does have a solid bitter flavor. A solid beer I try to pick up as often as I can."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Clear amber, copper pour with big caramel-white head and great lacing. Big spicy, hoppy nose with an earthy, caramel malt backbone. The Cascade hops are definitely the star here, but it's balanced quite well with a nice toasty caramel malt sweetness. Great earthy, herbal taste with just enough hop bitterness and malty sweetness. A very unique interpretation of the style that truly sets it apart from the standard Red. Nice almost creamy mouthfeel with a really smooth finish. Extremely drinkable for a 7% beer. This may have just taken the top spot for me in the Red beer category. Wish I would have picked up more of this."
"D - Decent, and a unique ""red ale"". Likeable, but nothing amazing. I'm glad to have tried it once."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle obtained in a trade. Pours dark amber with a medium bubbly head that slowly recedes to lace. Nose is both hoppy with citrus and soap, and malty with bread and hay. On the palate, the beer is hoppier with the malts taking a back seat. The hops linger for a long time with a nice bitter finish. The body is light with lively carbonation. The alcohol is masked well, but the watery body and active carbonation don't quite fit. This is a good beer that I could drink a lot of, but it is lacking the complexity and depth that I look for."
"D: A very average amber from Ithaca. Nothing about this beer really stands out and sets it apart. That being said, its not bad either and definitely something that I can see myself reaching for again. Give it a try if you're into the style as its a fairly solid representation."
"Decently balanced. Malty core with light hop finish. Much maltier than I was expecting with a name like cascazilla, sits much heavier and is much sweeter and not quite as dry as I was expecting, but still picked up lots of fruit notes. Over all a vert drinkable beer. Much sweeter finish, rather than a dry bitter hop finish."
"7%abv??? I don't believe it. This beer feels like 5%. I'd like to think I could drink a 6er of this in an evening, but I'd probably end up puking and sleeping upright to avoid the spins."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, but nothing remarkable. Would have like a little more hop presence in the taste to balance the sweet caramel flavors. I wouldn't turn this down, but likely won't seek this out again either."
"D: This is very enjoyable, probably better fresher, but a very worthy Amber."
"Had this on tap that the Ithaca Beer Company store front. It was an amber beer with some haziness to it. It smells of grapefruit and hops. I'm assuming from the name that the beer was brewed primarily (solely?) with cascade hops. A little thick with hop oils on the tongue but overall a good beer to kick back at the end of the day and fall asleep with as it is pretty strong."
"A good Red Ale that showcases hops rather than malts. Aggressive in bite and bitterness."
"my first bottle of this i didnt know the abv because its not listed on the bottle, then i cracked another one to do the review and surprise...7%. i would have guessed something like 5%. a little dangerous, but its a beautiful friday night on my back porch and i really dont see a problem with drinking the whole six pack. it was a long week. but needless to say, really good drinkability, if you dont mind the 7%, a great session beer."
"Hop forward, with a recovery of some bitterness that you can attribute to the toasted malt (which there is plenty of). Some bready/grainness follows to a lightly bitter and malty finish. Flavors are a bit soft (which you can also call smooth!). This might put some people off, but I like it -- makes it quite drinkable. Good balance, medium bodied, just the right amount of carbonation. This is very good beer. Holy dogshit! This is 7%? No hint of alcohol at all. OK, very dangerous beer here."
"D - A tasty and enjoyable treat from Ithaca... Hides the 7% ABV very well... Quaffable and quenching... Solid all the way around... An assertive and formidable American Red Ale..."
"Drinkability - Cascazilla is a fantastically complex and hoppy red ale that reminds me of a bold pale ale. The richness of the malt profile in addition to the bold, yet controlled, hop presence make for one delicious beer."
"Drinkability: This has a bit of a kick on the finish, probably from the abv. Funny this drinks like a brown ale but has the hops of an apa. Solid drinking beer, would try again."
"A good balanced IPA, the feel of this beer is pretty smooth and goes down well. It is pretty drinkable and has a nice refreashing feel to it."
"Nice deep amber color, very clear, with an off white fluffy head of 2"". Well retained and spots of lace left. Aroma is full of pine and resin with grapefruit zest and a healthy caramel malt background. Taste is a hop bomb. Rich bitterness and herbal hops all over the place. I hardly discern the malts here. Metallic as well. Not sure where this fits in though. Somewhat slick mouthfeel, decently full bodied for a red ale. Not something I would get all the time but I definitely think it's worth a try."
"Heavy, clingy hop demon. After two, would I have another? Maybe not. A tad too sweet, and the hops don't clear that the way they should, but it brings the humulus."
"Hop bill in the taste is a bit unexpected, I'm getting piney hops here. Some initial bitterness, followed by the piney kick, and some lingering sweetness from the malt. Something here just isn't right, not exactly what I thought I was getting myself into. I would like a bigger body on this one, but also with a bit more carbonation, though I'm not sure if I can have that. Decent drink, I'll have to revisit it in the future."
"D: red ales are not my favorite but this one was really tasty and went down great. I hope I can get my hands on some more."
"Notes: This one is highly drinkable a great find from a great brewery. Cheers."
"(D) i wouldn't guzzle these per se, but definitely would seek them out and drink a sixer 1 or 2 at a time. great beer."
"Please check out my video review: www.youtube.com/user/goodbeerinc"
"I'd be happy to get this again. Loads of flavor for around $9 a six pack. Those that enjoy hop flavor of the grapefruit variety should check this out."
"Although I was expecting an overpowering IPA flavor with a name like Cascazilla, the 'hoppiness' is toned down somewhat, but not to the detriment of the brew. There is indeed a nice hop flavor but it falls off extremely quickly. A good, refreshing offering from Ithaca. Maybe difficult to enjoy more than two in a single session, but definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: A decent but not memorable red ale. I could have another one or just as easily pass on it."
"Cheers!"
"poured into a pint glass with a little haze and a nice rich amber/red color. less than a 1/4 inch of head. good tasting, a tiny bit of sweetness. reminds me of the red rye, but not quite as hoppy. good hop flavor, just not the citrus hop that i like best. id buy again."
"Overall, a solid and enjoyable beer from a very good brewery."
"Notes: If you like cascade hops then you need to try this beer. It isn't the best amber ale you will ever try, but it is near the top of the list especially if you like this hop profile."
"Overall, I like this beer a lot. I find myself enjoying red ales more and more with each choice. Not the BEST one I have had, but I thoroughly enjoy it! Would definitely buy again after trying some others first."
"IMO this is a good cellaring beer, it should get better with age."
"Pours a dark reddish amber color with a large tan head that had good retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of a little Cascade hops, and that is about all. Kind of weak. But more hops come through in the flavor. Nice hoppy elements of citrus and pine. Malt gives a nice semi-sweet backbone for the hops to work off of. Not just another hoppy one-trick pony. Bitterness is moderately high. No sign of alcohol. A good body and carbonation. Maybe it could use a little more substance. A very good red ale that has good balanced elements. Rivals the best from the West Coast."
"Pours a dark coppery amber color with full fluffy off-white head. Good retention and nice sticky lacing. Smell is of pine resin and light molasses. Taste is a big rush of bitter piney hops, backed by a sweet and bready carmel malt presence. Mouthfeel is suprisingly creamy, medium bodied, smooth and not overly drying on the end. Slight bitter aftertaste. Nice beer, not to complex and maybe just a touch too bitter. Big Hops and Big Malts tgether make a pretty good beer."
"D- the body of the beer and the scent was very impressive. The beer is very drinkable as well. Good brew"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a clear red/amber with a 2 figer sticky white head. Big pine notes on the aroma. Up front this is a hop bomb with lots of sweet citrus and piney back bone. The hops linger into the finish without overpowering. Cascazilla is medium in body and average carbonation. A damn good imperial red ale."
"D = This is a beer that I could drink all day long. The balance -- just perfect -- makes it a refreshing gulper of which I do not tire quickly."
"single from the Foodery, NL, Philadelphia"
"I don't know if I could stick to these in a session. The sweetness is pretty high, and I think I'd switch to something else after a couple of these."
"The beer pours a brownish-amber color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is citrusy hops with some malt. The aroma is subtle. The flavor is orange, pine and juicy citrus. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Off tap at the brewery this beer was an amber/copper color with ruby highlights. The one-finger, khaki-colored head retained well leaving clingy and streaky lacing. The aroma was nice, a balance of Cascade hops (citrus/pine) and caramel malt. The flavors were huge and hoppy without being overwhelming. Lots of grapefruit hops, citrus zest and biscuity malt The mouthfeel was smooth, the body was medium and the carbonation average. Defined and yet sessionable. The 7% was well-concealed. A confusing Red Ale in the sense that it almost came off as an APA or IPA, but still enjoyable."
"D: I think the name suggests something more monstrous than what the beer delivers. After a few very solid offerings from Ithaca, I was a bit let down in several departments. Overall, a quality brew but it is clear that my anticipation got the best of me. But hey, a 3.6 aint bad."
" D- This beer has some nice depth to the hops but the main player is the pungent bitterness which is to strong and kicks you in the teeth. The malt backbone is good and is a welcome addition as the beer warms."
"A nice, hoppy amber, though not a replacement for Nugget Nectar if you are a true hop-head."
"D – One of the better reds I've had of late."
"I don't tend to like red ales or amber ales. I like EVERYTHING Stone has put out EXCEPT for Levitation, for instance. But I DO like this beer. There's a bitterness to it that I wish wasn't there, but it is easy to drink and definitely a step above other beers of this style that I've tried. I wouldn't kick it out of bed, but it isn't on the top of my list either."
"Taste is completely hops, with all the usual expectations that follow. quite earth and a finish that does have a slight fruity nature. This lines the mouth and lingers, a little syrupy and malt. Drinkability is affected by the dry hops - the lack of balance makes this a little less enticing."
"Pours a cider like hazy color with no head and some lacing. The aroma is of floral and earthy hops with a slight roasted malt. Deep roasted malt and caramel malt backbone with floral and earthy hop overtones. The moutfeel is light bodied. The drinkability is good, there is a nice complexity and a nice big malt taste followed on the backend by a nice hop bite. You might not go all night with it, but a few is for sure not out of the question."
"This beer has somewhat of a cult following in these parts, so I was excited to get my hands on one. Poured dark copper into an American pint, with two fingers of white head, fair lacing, and fair carbonation. The smell was somewhat sickly sweet, with pineapple, blood orange, maple syrup, plum, and raisins all apparent. The taste confirmed the smell; very cloyingly sweet from start to finish, with pineapple and maltiness most prominent. The mouthfeel was nicely medium-bodied, with a good mix of carbonation. Given the smell and flavor, I expected the feel to be more syrupy. Anyway, one was enough for me. A little bit of a disappointment after all of the hype."
"A: The color reminds me of pine bark, significant head on a hard pour that seems to stick around and leave some lacing as it drops - 4.00, S: Wonderfully fragrant hop aroma, lots of citrus especially grapefruit which shouldn't be a shocker given the name and implications that Cascade hops play a big part in this beer, there's also a touch of molasses or brown sugar in the depths along with a mild toastiness - 3.50, T: Pronounced hop bite, grapefruit zest and pine needle, solid backing of malts to back up all the hops, light caramel flavors - 3.50, M: Quite sticky - 3.00, D: A pleasant beer, edges more towards an IPA than an amber in many ways but that is certainly not a problem in my book - 3.50"
"12oz bottle in a pint glass. First off the only thing that makes this a red ale in my opinion is the color. It seems Ithaca already had an IPA but the head brewer wanted to make another heavy hop bomb so he created Cascazilla red ale. Color is a copper red like i think it should be. The smell is all hops and citrus, one of the better smelling bears i have had. I exspected the taste to be dominated by hops but you can tell the brewer spent time to balance this beer and not make it to bitter. It has a nice citrus bite to it but nothing to dominating like Torpedo in my opinion. Mothfeel is smooth with not to much carbonation. The alchol is masked very well and i could drink several of these easily. So far my favorite red ale i have had."
"Overall- Very malty and hoppy. This 1, at 7%, is too easy to drink."
"D: Very good and very hopppy red ale. I like this beer and have had my share. Glad to see it on tap and welcome most anything by Ithaca."
"The alcohol is definitely not noticeable, and the beer is a little thin. I don't consider either of these to be significant problems, and the beer just leaves me wanting more, more, more."
"This red ale pours clear with a small but noticeable off whitish head. Very heavy with Cascade hops but at that right point where its enough without being too much. Its mellowed off towards the end by a slight caramel flavor but overall a super crisp tasting beer. I wish they made a cologne because this beer smells fantastic!"
"D- Sessionable brew here. The hops are the star but like I said before, one dimensional."
"D- This is a nice hoppy red/amber- not a rel standout. I personally enjoy the malt biased ambers more. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys hoppier beers."
"Drinkability - it's hard for these to hang around long, they are too drinkable for their own good. And they are good!"
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory Pint. Best by February notched on the label. Poured a translucent copper with a loose, two inch off-white head. Head eventually settles into a quarter inch cap with delicate spots of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals citrus and some floral hops. Taste follows nose on a clean malty backbone, which provides some body while allowing the hops character to stand out. Mouthfeel is light-medium and lively with a partially dry and palate cleansing finish. I had the opportunity to have this on draft last week and was blown away by the flavor and drinkability. Truly a top notch amber."
"12 ounce bottle poured into unibroue tulip. Aroma is a nice burst of sweet malts and hops, some heat noted in nose. Taste is along the same lines, pretty nice. Nice masking of the abv in the taste. Pretty good balance of malts and hops. Solid offering."
"Cascazilla is a solid red ale, one that I'd recommend and will sample again."
"Drinkability: I can drink this all day long."
"D - im a big fan of cascade so this was quite pleasant for me. not my favorite red but a yummy sipper."
"Bottle from an Ithaca brewing company sampler poured into a sam smiths pint glass. Smells real friuty and florally, a lot like froot loops actually. Taste is more of the same but with a very hoppy piney background. club soda like carbonation and easy drinkability make this a real nice beer almost sessionable."
"This beer has grown on me since I started drinking craft beers. It has a nice amber appearance and is clear. It has a flowery smell to it and the hops are just right when you take a drink. It sits nicely on your palate not to heavy and it flows smoothly. I would put this in my top 3 beers from this company."
"Mouthfeel as medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Nice drinkability, no flavors are overpowering and I could drink several of these without getting bored with the flavors."
"Pours a kind of rusty amber with two fingers of head. Huge flowery hop aroma that is almost overpowering each time I bring the glass up to my mouth. The taste isn't as quite as hoppy the aroma but is still extremely strong. Slightly metallic at first but as I continue through the beer I become more accustomed to the taste and it seems to be better balanced. Fairly easy to drink, especially for the alcohol content."
"The feel of the beer is okay. It is pretty well carbonated, but still somehow on the thin side. It goes down quickly and smoothly, and all the remains behind is a citrus-rind bitterness and slight stickiness. It is definitely drinkable, and while not my favorite in the style, I would definitely try it again."
"A nice Imp amber but I think Troegs Hopback tastes better, more of a malt backbone and hop presence in it. Cascazilla has a bigger ABV but i wouldnt have guessed it. I think it could be more ramped up and be amazing"
"this beer pours a nice red color with a thick off white head that recedes to rocky lacing rather quickly. the aroma presents a nice bready malt aroma backed nicely by citrus hops. the taste follows with a nice balance of the sweet biscuit malt flavor and pine hop bitterness. the medium body and the good co2 make this a beer that I never pass up in the tasting room."
"Ithaca Brewing makes some impressive beer. Cascazilla's no exception. The only complaint I have is that it's not very bitter. I'd like it even more if it had more of a bitter kick to it. Otherwise, it's spot-on for a hopped up Amber Ale. This is damn good stuff that's well worth seeking out. Highly recommended."
"D: This brew is good. I'm not exactly impressed, but it performs respectably in all categories. I wish there as a little more flavor, but I guess it is supposed to be a hop bomb. I would drink this again, but probably won't seek it out."
"Last but not least, this label says stay away, minus the Ithaca beer co. It appears almost like a mighty morphin power ranger label with a dragon spewing fire out of his mouth with hops in the flames. +1 for originality , -3 for label cheese"
"Taste is sweet and hoppy with a good amount of bitterness but still being sweet and drinkable. Body is a bit light and watery although still quite tasty."
"Smooth and crisp with a bit of a resinous malt feel in the middle and end of the sip. Nicely textured and thoroughly interesting, the only thing that knocks this beer's rating down a bit is its representation of the style. Not quite a sessioner (7%, even though you'd never know it), but I drank these all night."
"Nice amber body topped by a thick, long-lasting head. Aroma is heavy on malt at first, then a nice pop of rosin followed by another blast of sweetness. Flavor is a wonderful mix of grapefruit and tangerine blended with pine balanced by caramel and biscuit malt flavors. Borders on a typical IPA of 8-10 years ago for bitterness. One of the more balanced beers I've had with regards not being well hopped but not numbing to the taste-buds. Mouthfeel tends to get a little aggressive carbonation-wise. Drinkability is good. Six-packs don't last too long. This has been a go-to dependable beer for a few years for me."
"This beer tastes a lot like an ESB. There is a lot of malt, not a lot of hop. The hop flavors exist entirely as bitterness and almost an aftertaste. The malt character is nice and although unexpected, pleasant. I really enjoy this beer. Mouthfeel is full (like an ESB), drinkablility high. Overall a pretty decent beer."
"This is surely a tasty brew with some nice raw hops flavor, fairly balanced by the roasted malt and sweetness and with a pretty decent complexity."
"From the 355 ml. bottle with a notched off ""September"" on the label. It does not say which year but I sampled it on October 8, 2009 so I have to think it is September 2009. A decent sounding amber-red pour into the pint glass with about a quarter-inch, long lasting beige head and rather cloudy in clarity. The aroma wafts of very sweet malts and pungent Cascade hops. The mouthfeel is pretty heavy with long lasting consistency. The taste is an enticing merger of sweet caramel malts and bitter Cascade hops almost to the level of a decent IPA. A nice spin on the Red Ale recipe."
"It's a rough brew, and certainly challenging to the palette. Monstrously hoppy with out being overbearing in anyway. A genuinely delicious brew."
"Drinkability, I think, is very good. The beer goes down very smooth and has a nice flavor. The excessively bitter finish may turn some people off."
"Drinkability: This is a solid brew, but it almost seems a little much for me, probably as far as balance goes. The strength of it isn't as balanced as it probably should be in order to enjoy a few. Granted, 7% isn't a low ABV, but it seems a bit more raucous than it should be, and with more malt balanced and less askance bitterness, this could be something much different and much more sessionable."
"Drinkability: Its pretty drinkable, not too heavy, looks nice, smells nice and, even tastes nice; the one thing is that the alcohol really makes an appearance at the bottom of your glass as all the other complexities diminish."
"Overall: Quite an well executed 'monster' it doesn't ruin your palate but rather is a nice nuance of hops and an interesting twist on the amber ale category. First time having an ithaca brew (even though they are so close to home) and was pleasantly surprised."
"Drink is good very easily sessionable and again absolutely smooth and enjoyable."
"This is my first time have a beer made by Ithaca Beer Company and I am pleasantly surprised."
"I pleasant surprise. A totally drinkable, nicely balanced, well made product."
"D: This beer was delicious and not your normal amber ale in my book. This was an excellent drinking experience and I would keep this in the fridge if I could get it in TN!!!"
"D: This is a beer that I would love to have on tap. Like...today."
"Very bitter and hop forward with a strong resinous piney hop mouthfeel. Caramel malt backbone with some biscuit notes and a slight touch of rye. The strong bitterness of the hops lasts throughout lingering over the malt backbone into a resinous bone dry piney hop finish."
"A sturdy drinking beverage, glad to have tried it."
"D- The ABV is what I, as a Barleywine/RIS fan, would consider on the low side. But no matter who you are you will agree that the ABV is undetectable. In the end I dont agree with the claim of ""monstrously hopped", but instead I find a quite nicely balanced and crisp, SEXY looking red."
"D- not bad. This isn't my favorite beer in the style, but something about it makes it hard to put the glass down."
"Very good red ale, almost like an Irish Red. The hops were the highlight of the beer. Recommended."
"While slightly subdued than some IPAs that I am used to, this is still a quality drink."
"This one pours a deep dark cloudy red with a massive tan head. It took a few minutes to get this one poured, and the lacing was huge. This is a beautiful beer. Smells of malt and hops. Tastes of citrusy hops mixed with sweet malt flavor in a nice balance of the two. Hoppy amber ale, that's what it says and that's what you get. As I worked my way through it, the flavors tended to get in the way of each other a little bit, as I was hoping one or the other would assert itself, but that never happened. Could have been a bit more complex, but still a fine drinkable beer."
"Pours golden orange with a 2 finger head that's leaves a massive ammount of lacing. Nose is hoppy with a caramel sweetness and some baked goods. Taste is the same but not as strong as the nose. Sweetness is upfront. The mouthfeel is on the weak side. Good brew but nothing to make it stand out over other choices available."
"This beer is all of a sudden everywhere and I'm not sure why. It has somehow become the local brew in new york city and I suspect because it's contract brewed somewhere around here. Anyway, not a bad beer but nothing to get crazy over. Decent color, good drinkability but not much else that distinguishes it from the many other choices out there."
"you can tell that it's dying off, but there is just enough of it left to tell how good it was in it's hay day...need a fresher one to double check on that..."
"A very nice amber ale and easy to drink. It's nice to see a beer that can be so complex with just a single hop."
"Cheers!"
"Eric"
"A fantastic offering by the folks at Ithaca Beer Company. Was estatic to see this at my local beer store."
"D: Quite nice. Perfectly balanced, flavorful, and a pleasure to drink."
"Thanks, jjayjaye, for the opportunity"
"~Jonathan Passow"
"Tried this at a tasting recently, it was one of very few that stood out to me. It's basically a hopped up Amber. The aroma is all Cascade hops. The beer was pretty balanced, the malts were slightly smoky. Perfect malt profile for and Amber/Red. Highly drinkable for 7%. A really nice beer that I hope to be enjoying more of soon."
"Hard to rate drinkability for this overly-broad style which includes many delicious lighter bodied beers of lower ABV, but the taste makes it highly drinkable in my book."
"D- i'm a huge part-time hop-head but this one seems lackluster for me. megalon wins."
"So far, my first impression with Ithica is a nice one. I find Amber Ales kind of boring, but this has just enought flavor punch to warrent a high recommendation. Not the best Amber I have had, but easily hangs with the best of them."
"overall,a pretty solid beer.always glad to have new offerings in ohio."
"Smell is hops and just a bit of malt. Flavor consists of a bunch of hops. Very bittering and rough. There's a very ample malt backbone to support the hops. Very full and thick on the mouthfeel. Enjoyable and very bitter."
"Hoppy reds/ambers are a nice thing, and while this isn't Troegs level, its a tasty treat and invites a revisit."
"Pretty much as good as it gets in the style. Ive been following the style since my first nugget nectar, which reallys falls more in the IPA side. This is a good beer, in a similar class as Founders Red Rye, GF Hop Head Red, etc."
"On tap at the River Street Alehouse for happy hour. $2 for a standard shaker ""pint"". Appears a hazed rich crimson/copper color with about a finger of off white foam. The head leaves a thin lace in it's path as I sip my way to the bottom of the glass. All types of hop notes going on in the nose and flavor - earthy, piney, citrus such as lemon and grapefruit, and a respectable amount of sweet caramelized malts, slightly spicy. This red ale is at it's worst, medium bodied and amply carbonated. A tasty, hoppy amber."
"D: Very good. I'd have to say this is a bit of a palate wrecker...not that this is a bad thing."
"Well balanced malty hop flavor. Some sweetness but a clean finish."
"D - Pretty drinkable, not a beer I would want to session, but I could. Pretty different then other ambers I've had, but delicious in it's own right."
"Pours out a dark reddish brown in color with a bombardment of head tension and some killer lacing. Smells are of earthy hops and caramelized malt. Taste is of well balanced mix of smooth bitter hops in the front and a mild sweet malt in the back. The mouthfeel is frothy, almost medium in body, great carbonation and is refreshing given the ABV. Drinkability is superb, the gulp factor is off the charts. A session beer all the way, and for this... comes recommended."
"Overall a very good beer but do not expect as much hops as a Great Divide Hercules Double IPA or even Sierra Neveda Torpedo. Still a very drinkable beer which I recommend"
"D - This is a good beer...it provides the hops but they are not overpowering in any way...perfect balance"
"D) A very delicious hoppy red, but dangerously smooth. I chug a few of these without thinking."
"I really am starting to like these American Amber / Red Ale's it went down really easy, very sessionable. I would drink this if it was on tap in front of me at a bar and easily recommend it to any one who asked"
"Thanks to Adam (PEBKEC) for the brew."
"Final Thoughts - If you catch this in the pub next time, give it a try. A pleasant surprise, and good entry into the American Amber genre."
"Mouthfeel is nice, light but crisp carbonation over a lightly sticky body."
"Pours a bright copper red amber color with a medium sized off white head with good retention and some soapy sticking. Dry bitter leafy hops, dried fruit such as apricot and apple and a red wine grape tartness and earthiness. Lots of hop flavor, fruity hops weak malt character, enough honey sweetness to begin to create balance but it just falls short. Its got a kind of medicinal, alcohol rich aftertaste and a sticky body. Good fizzy carbonation, bright and interesting enough to drink a few but this one doesnt quite wow me."
"M + D: Easy to take down ... Nice sparkling carbonation and a nice lingering of flavour."
"D- A solid effort but having had this in the bottle and on draft. The draft is a touch less balanced with bitter hops being more pronounced but the flavors are also less concentrated."
"slightly sweet taste, hoppy throughout but not 'monstrously' hoppy. hops come and go and don't linger. good medium body taste, the flavor spreads well throughout."
"Great one at a time, & as a decent substitution for when Nugget Nectar isn't in season."
"D: A hop-forward, but relatively balanced red... quite drinkable."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A well made red ale for sure. However, not quite as good as Red's Rye, or Nosferatu."
"It was very drinkable. Very good red ale!"
"The mouthfeel is pretty good, well carbonated and pretty smooth. Easy to drink, alcohol is well hidden, a well balanced brew."
"Had on tap at Ordinary Joe's in Oakville, pours a beautiful dark amber in color, nice red highlights, beautiful size head and nice retention. Aromas peeking through are nice cascade hop properties, grapefruit, mango and a nice zip of some malt sweetness. This one taste like your traditional red, a nice dose of malt is backed by a huge amount of fruity hops, nicely balanced and presented well to the palete. Nice carbonation on this one, the malt smooths it out a bit but the hops take over on the finish. I liked this brew alot, has great balance and was tasty to the last drop. Will defintley have this again, an awesome brew from the guys at Ithaca."
"Thanks, once again, to Reagan1984 for tossing this in on a recent trade. Pours a nice, deep red color with a dense, foamy white 1 finger head. Decent lacing left as that head slowly recedes. Smells delicious! If you are a hop head like me that is, a strong, sweet citrus hops aroma. Oddly that strong hop punch is a little muted in the flavor, as the sweet malts of the red ale style kick in to balance the bitter out. As stated, this is a amber/red, so I guess I should roll back my hops hopes, but that smell was so strong. Nice complexity to the taste, though, with that sweet and bitter battle in your taste buds. Fair amount of carbonation holds me back from being able to take too many of these, but a nice, somewhat new take on the style."
"as for drinkability well if hops are your goal in life this would be the red ale for you no doubt, was a bit more pronounced in the hop flavor when I had it on tap at CNY brewfest"
"Mouthfeel is, again, well balanced. Medium bodied, chewy, enough hops to keep me coming back with a nice malty backbone. This goodness mellows out to a nice, smooth, creamy finish."
"D- Not bad. A tad too bitter to drink a lot of, but that's what it's supposed to be."
"This is a nicely hopped, yet not too bitter, red ale that is very enjoyable. I liked it a bit more on tap than in the bottle, but still a delicious hoppy brew!"
"D- If I was out of nugget nectar and wanted a hoppy amber I would go to this before others in the style. I could only drink two bottles in a sitting as this got a bit to bitter for my taste. This has a very dry finish to itself."
"Tasted this again a few months later, and I still think this is a solid offering. The hops really shine, but are well balanced by the malt. I also like the funky bottle."
"Very sweet and fruity. Sweet, cherry flavored malt with citrus hops. Some hop bitterness at the end as well. Very syrupy mouthfeel made this beer seem like drinking a melted Luden's cherry coughdrop. Cascazilla seems to want to be part of the new big-ass hoppy amber style that seems to be catching on (Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale, Lagunitas Mondo Red, etc.) but falls short. Just be yourself little buddy. I think there's a metaphor in there somewhere."
"D: Very generously hopped red ale! Good flavor and drinkability. Hops definitely coat the tongue here. Some good strength and crisp freshness make this one very worth trying."
"D: I was impressed with this ale. I didn't expect the hoppiness from a red. Definitely wortyh checking out."
"Drinkability: Good moderately hoppy ale. Easy to drink because of the balance, but hard to drink a lot because its filling. Thought it might be a little hoppier though."
"I deffinatly could put back a few of these"
"Overall, a good beer. If the taste would have just continued and followed through the sip it would have been much more enjoyable."
"deep amber color with generous amount of head and lacing. smell is incredible with lots of hops and floral notes. some grapefruit and spicy citrus there too. taste is malty up front and then the hop bitterness comes and takes over at the end. taste is kind of perfumey at the end with the floral hop flavor, but it doesn't really detract from the enjoyableness of the beer. mouthfeel has enough carbonation to carry the alcohol and bitterness. quite drinkable."
"D - Amazing. This is one hell of a beer."
"Drinkability- Flavorful and balanced enough to retain interest for a session of several."
"This poured a clear, dark amber with white head. It smelled like caramel and red barley malt, with a bit of sweet honeysuckle and copper hops. It tasted like brown sugar and caramel malt, with some red barley and copper hops. It was somewhat oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty tasty red ale that was nice and clean. It had good body and was very easy to drink. It was sweeter than I expected, and was fairly basic, but it was definitely enjoyable."
"6/4/7/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"Drinkability - balanced, and totally yummy. This is god stuff!!"
"(rated Mar 1, 2007)"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Unibroue tulip. This beer pours a light tea brown with a huge 2 finger head that left behind pretty sticky lacing. The aroma is some of the most floral hops I have ever had the pleasure of smelling. Brown sugar and loose-leaf tea are also there in the aroma. The taste once again in floral hops up front but finishes pretty watery. Its like a big burst of flavor that melts away into nothingness. The mouthfeel is a bit dry for me but not overwhelming by any sort of measure. I think if I lived in Ithaca's distribution area, this could definitely become a go to beer."
"I had this on tap at Delaney's Tap Room in New Haven. The beer was dark orange colol with a rocky head. The smell was less hoppy than I'd hoped with the Cascazilla name, but actually pretty well put together for a hoppy amber ale. Lots of malt balances out the smell. Both components come through big in the taste, loads of ingredients but not really a mess, just strong flavors of hops with a solid malty backbone. The body could be a little thicker in my opinion, to complement the flavors, but it was OK. The beer felt stronger than the 7% ABV it has, otherwise I would have scored drinkability higher."
"Very drinkable, I could have a few of these."
"D: Very easy drinking beer; crisp and clean."
"D: Drinks easy but just kind of gets lost with all the other Cascade heavy beers out there."
"Very nice. An amber ale that is much like an IPA. A quality drinker from Ithaca. I'm glad I have five more to enjoy."
"Tastes of citric hop bitterness, a bit of sweet malts and spicy hops. I found the mouthfeel to be lacking a little depth."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. There was a nice amount of huskiness in the body which smoothed out in the finish."
"Pours a clear amber color with an average off-white dense head, that settled into a cap. The brew has a nice juicy hop aroma, some grapefruit. In my opinion this is what amber ales need. The taste is of a toasted biscuit malt, with an earthy stale grass hop flavor, light citrus/lemony hops as well. Again, I like the hop presence in an amber ale. The ale has a moderate body with soft carbonation leading to a silky feel; finishes with a hoppy bitterness. One of the more flavorful amber ales. Good hop presense but not enough where you would consider this an IPA."
"I don't think I could drink more than two in a sitting, but that might be a personal thing with me well-hopped brews. I'm sure others will enjoy"
"D: very easy drinking red ale. Solid brew."
"Sweet malt taste is balanced by the cascade and chinook hops leaving a nice long finish on the mouth. This is a nice session brew going down perfect with my pizza."
"The beer maintains such a nice crispness and fullness. The way the malts are used and the way that the combine with the cascades are absolutely amazing."
"This beer leaves a slightly syrupy coating on the tongue. Just a little too sweet in the finish. Good drinkability and goes down easy for a big amber beer."
"A good beer."
"D-Wish I had more than 12oz. This was a good beer and will look for again."
"The first time I had it I knew I'd be coming back to this one often. A super hoppy, well balanced red ale. The hop flavors and aroma's are perfect and make for a very drinkable beer. Add in the fact it's available all year and isn't expensive and it makes it even better."
"Pours out a dark mahogany color with a thick white head with a ton of stickyness. The smell is of a ton of hops with a lot of light malts right there with it. The hops come through mostly in the taste, but the malts linger in your mouth a little longer. Reminds me of a bizzaro Lagunitas Lucky 13, where I got the malts first, then the hops. Overall, a really good hoppy amber."
"Nice beer and one I will for sure have again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Nice mouthfeel and killer drinkability"
"Cascazilla had a great nice orange color with a thick white head that laced nicely throughout the pint. The smell was a great blast of cascade hops and the flavor didn't disappoint. This beer hit the tongue with a nice mouthful of hops and finish with a cascade flavor that slowly faded but never became bitter. The body was nice and not too thick. This is a drinkable beer that could sneak up on you fast!"
"I recently had this beer following Captain Lawrence Reserve Double IPA which is a close proximity. Both are excellent; however, this one was slightly more drinkable ... and interestingly are different styles. Perhapse a closer compare would be to Keegan Hurrican Kitty."
"Drinkability- This brew reminds me of Ports Shark Attack Red Ale with a bit more of a candy aspect. The hops are the star of the show (like you'd expect) and are put together really well. I have like 5 more Ithaca brews left from Adam and I can't wait to try the rest. Thanks again!"
"Drinks easy, but I expected more hop profile from a beer of this name. A good amber to be sure"
"Overall I thought this was a very nice hoppy red ale. I would have no issues at all with drinking this one over and over again. Definitely something to look forward to after a long day. I would have to recommend this one very highly."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Rich copper color with 1 inch tan head. Lacing was left as the head disappeared. Smells of citrusy hops. Well balanced taste of biscuity malt and citrusy/piney hops. Finishes dry without much of an aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy. Overall a very well balanced beer and suprisingly easy to drink."
"a part of the ithaca sampler, nice they slipped this one in, pours a clear, deep copper color w/ a thin head that disappeared immediately leaving little lacing in my goblet, giving a 3.5 anyway as it could be the glass ; a strong piney grapefruit-like aroma, some cereal grain & toffee and roasted nut notes, but is overpowered by the hops ; a rich flavor, nice well balanced hop bite backed up by a bready malt backbone, very good piney/citrus hop flavor, blends well with the nutty/caramel notes midway, a bit of mineral in the finish ; a med. body, kinda flat tho. more co2 would benefit this beer ; a pretty damn good brew, may as well be classified as an IPA for all i'm concerned..."
"Not bad, but the focus on the crystal malt character can be a bit much at times. If I wasn't focusing on tasting this beer the over-use of crystal malt really wouldn't bother as much as it does."
"Overall, an awesome red ale, a lot more hopped up, while at the same time very balanced."
"D - very good, easy drinking brew, crisp and clean. I enjoyed this beer and recommend it to all, don't let the name scare you away."
"Don't drink and review."
"first drank this at bobbique in ny on tap . picked up a case on mini vacation in pittsburgh . looks great in my brooklyn lager pint glass . nice color nice creamy head . drinks real good i dont know about a all night session but one real good beer . problem easy to find in pa then my homestate of ny ."
"Coming full circle, we kicked off this year's Penn State Brew Fest weekend with a brew we raved about at last year's event. Word was the demand had the State College distributors ordering cases only days after the event ended... indeed worth a year's wait. Dark ruby red body with medium effervescence--uneven off-white brownish head in a pint glass, opaque but intimidating... robust hops intrude immediately, appropriate to the bottle's label...beautiful malt balance with spruce, toasted caramel and occassional peat scents for complexity...heavy, full-bodied, warming rush...actively effervescent and crunchy palate... ""monster"" hops early, mega malt late hammering like twin pistons on the tongue--rich, pucker-sweet and a bit of smoke(?)...BIG taste but again, balanced beyond the predictable ""I ate a Christmas tree"" feeling that we sampled from others at the event. Now, in a 12 oz. and without the pressure of comparison, truly this beer is a standout in the style."
"Maybe the corniest most 1st edition jurrasic parkish VHS movie cover looking label art I have ever seen, but the beer inside is what matters. Pours a very nice looking clear super ruby red with a very nice off white fluffy head. Nose is hops and some creamy malt. Taste follows with a good portion of hops and some nice creamy malt backbone. An odd fruity taste through the middle. Mouthfeel is on the viscous side for an amber, but I kind of like it. Drinkability is quite good, despite the viscosity of the brew. Overall a very drinkable good amber, that would probably be somewhat of a regular in my fridge if it were available. Nothing really amazing, but a good hop presence and a solid amber ale. One and a halmber really. Good brew."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied with a crisp smoothness. Very easy drinking."
"I have had this on Tap at the Moosewood in Ithaca as well and if you can get it that way I highly suggest it. But if bottles are all you can grab than they will do just fine."
"Notes: A good beer. Good bang for the buck."
"this is as good as it gets, this is big and hopy and well balenced with the malt hitting sweet up front and fades effertlessley into hops. this beer should be out all year long insted of just seasonal, i always pack away a case for hibernating in the winter. the only porblem with this beer is that when it is served it only lasts for a few sips befor i find it gone. TRY THIS, ITS FINOMIANAL!!!"
"HV"
"D. Gotta love these hoppy red American Ales. Refreshing and an easy drinker. Pucker Up!"
"This beer pours a very red amber that is very see though with little to no head. The smell was faint on this beer but what I got was nuts and malts. This was a good red ale with alot of hops flavor, well balanced, much better than the smell and appearance would suggest. The mouthfeel was very pleasant on this beer and its a highly drinkable"
"D: I'd grab another fresh to see what it's like"
"this beer is super drinkable. the hops are there, but not in such force that the beer is tough to swallow. hands down, ithaca's best beer"
"Pours a clear burnt orange with a reddish center. Two fingers of foamy off-white/beige head has good retention and leaves a spotty ring of lacing. Smells of caramel, bread, grapefruit, pine resin, and grain. Tastes of grapefruit followed by toasted grain and caramel, then a nice pickup of spicy, earthy hops with a pine/dry grass finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Dominated by hops but yet not unbalanced with some sweetness and graininess and a nice dry finish. A good hopped up red ale."
"Drinkability is nice on this beer. It has a good smoothness to it and a really good hop taste. It is not too overbearing, though, making it a good session beer. A very nice selection in any weather or occassion."
"Drinkability- This beer goes down toooo easy! I am a big fan- and sad that I can't make it a regular down here!"
"Cheers..."
"D: Pungently hopped and sweet making for a great drinkable ipa."
"Overall this was just ok for me. I won't seek this out in the future and there are much better reds like the ultimate Hop Head Red. Sorry, but this beer can't stack up against the Green Flash."
"This is a solid red ale and I would seek this one out again."
"D. Intense flavor and highly enjoyable. Tried at the Penn Brewfest and had to seek it out."
"Recommended..."
"This beer really enveloped the taste buds and really didn't cloy. This is a beer with great mouthfeel, easy and refreshing to drink. Had it on tap, but gonna see if Mr. Capone has a bottle."
"Drinkability also gets a five since I can drink more than one in a session, as its below 7%. Such a wonderful beer. This and the Flower Power. Cheers!"
"Gorgeous ruby red color with two fingers of off-white head. Head dissipates slowly leaving lots of lacing. Nice cascade aroma, plenty of citrus. Citrus flavor comes through with a good malt backbone that bring a nice balance. Finishes slightly sweet with a citrus twang still in there. Medium bodied with good drinkability."
"I didnt mind this one, but would not seek it out again."
"A solid beer, one i'd most definately reach for again"
"This is a drinkable beer. Although it is pretty balanced, I would give the nod to the hops over the malt."
"I love this beer. And if you've lived in Ithaca, I hope you enjoyed my review."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure where the ""Red"" was in this beer, other than it's color, but I'd highly recommend this as a session beer if you're a fan of hops like me. Great work, Ithaca Brewing!"
"I'm comparing this with my memories of Great Lakes' Nosfaratu, and to my recollection, this holds up well. An exceptionally well-done shot at this style."
"Overall, a decent balanced red ale. Nothing spectacular here, but worth a try. Don't expect a big hoppy red though."
"Taste: Nice and bitter, just a hint of malty sweetness that's gone about as quickly as it shows up but lingers a bit more as it warms. Starts with Pine and Citrus followed by a nice Grassy and Citrus finish. Clean, crisp, balanced, and very drinkable."
"MF&D - Full bodied, creamy and sticky. Might not be a sesion beer, bit its very good nontheless. Check it out."
"Bigger isn't always better, but when you name your beer ""Cascazilla", you'd better deliver on something big."
"This one was a gusher. Poured from a bottle into a pilsner. Poured a cloudy ice tea brown with a tan white head. Spider web lacing with decent head retention. Smell was a nice mix of hops and malt. The taste was great. Hops up front followed by a nice creamy caramel malt finish. Very well balanced beer with a smooth medium bodied creamy mouthfeel leaving behind all sorts of flavor. Not as bitter as I expected which is a good thing. Perfect carbonation with a great body and an awesome example of this style. Jump on this one if you get the chance. Ithaca has yet to disappoint."
"D-A good brew that stradles that hoppy amber/IPA line. A beer that is always nice to see on tap...doesnt stand up to some other offerings for me....but certainly not a beer I shun! I never have an issue putting away a few of these!"
"D: Thank God my friend took my keys. The 7% abv was perfectly masked. Normally at Coopers (Scranton) I switch from beer to beer, but this one was too good to switch away from. Its biggest flaw is that it's not available in OK."
"D - Nice drinking beer. Good balance and tasty."
"Toasted caramel malt flavor up front. Sweetish cookie dough backbone. Piny, resinous hop flavor and bitterness come on strong and deliciously. Herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Chewy sweet malts linger. Nice. Medium body is maybe a bit too carbonated. Otherwise a very nice drinking amber ale, especially if you like hoppy ones!"
"Medium mouthfeel and good level of carbonation. This is a beer I could drink a number of in a sitting. Really tasty and just plain solid across the board."
"Not sessionable due to the 6.5% abv which is too much for me to session but a very drinkable solid beer."
"OK, better ""big reds"" out there."
"This ale had a beautiful appearance. The other aspects weren't as wonderful, but the only disappointing part was the mouthfeel. There was an arid level of dryness that I didn't care for, but don't let that keep you from drinking it."
"I could easily drink a few of these in an evening."
"Very similar in taste and aroma to a barleywine without all the alcohol.. Wasn't sure I liked it at first, but it really started to get tasty after a few minutes...thanks, Joe!"
"An amber, medium-bodied ale with a huge head that dwindled down to a thick ring leaving lacing on the sides with each sip. A piney aroma with some floral hints. A good amount of malt attempts to balance out with the hops, but the bitterness comes out a little stronger. The lingering taste of alcohol that hangs out too long is the only negative for this beer. A solid beer that I would like to try again in the future."
"Flavor is just popping with hops. Malts provide a balance to the hops but hardly stand out on their own. Some stringent woody tannins to. Medium to light mouthfeel. Hop oils really cling to the cheeks. Drinkable but 3 or so of these would blow your taste buds for much else."
"I just recently had this beer on tap also and it is even better and smoother than a bottle!"
"Drinkability: This is a very solid beer. It has some balls, yet it's still easy-drinking."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. What impressed me was that it is a very well balanced brew, an easy drinking hoppy ale that doesn't beat you over the head with the hops, them cram them into your unconcious mouth. I will most certainly be enjoying more of these in the future."
"Pours a clear amber orange with about a finger of white head, which works down quickly leaving some nice lacing. The smell is of grass and piny hops. The flavor is on the hoppy side but nat as overpowering as some of the style. A good amount of citrus hops followed by some medium malt backbone, and a lingering grapefruit bitterness. The mouthfeel is right on for the beer, and this one tends to be pretty drinkable. Not my favorite example of the style, but a good hoppy red ale."
"cheers"
"The beer poured a red-tinged brown with a single finger tan head. The nose was mostly hops with some fruity and floral notes. The taste is all Cascade hops, with the distinct tastes of pine and grapefruit without as much of a bite as I expected. It has a decently smooth almost oily mouthfeel and is very drinkable for a beer that's so hoppy."
" Cascade hops. Surprise surprise. It is a very focused beer. The nose and mouth are almost souly about the cascade but it deviates slightly to showcase some caramel, biscuity malt and bread dough, and then all is washed over again by cascade hop flavors of grapefruit and pine."
"I am just not a very big fan of Red Ales and that might be the case of the poor review but i really did not enjoy this beer and will not be having it again."
"This beer is dirty red in apperance with a slight chill haze. There a bit of a malty sent but the malt is fighting off the hops the whole time. This beer has a robust resiny body where you can just taste the citrusy resins. Other flavors you get are a grassy aroma with lemon and peper. It also appears by the label that there showcasing the cascade hops if so they did a good job. Good for hop heads , i just look for more malts from an amber or red. Also, evean though its not beer but on the bottle, the lable is hidiously kitchy."
"Drinkability: This is the best hoppy red ale I have tried. The balance is what makes this so good, since many can go too heavy on the hoppy side. This is a beer that I would seek out again. Good job."
"D - I think this is my favorite Ithaca beer its like an IPA ale definitely worth a try if you find it"
"D - Pretty good. A pleasantly hoppy ale that's worth a try. It is flavorful and pleasant, I might have it again."
"The great smell, taste, and easy drinking of this guy make this a winner in my book. Next time, I'll pick up a six pack, instead of just the one single. This went down way too fast."
"This beer pours a nice amber color with a red tint with a nice medium sized white head that is fairly thick and sticks to the sides of the bottle. The smell is of hops and some roasted malts, but mostly Cascade hops. The taste is a nice red ale with alot of hops. Good roasted malts followed by a citrisy, flowery, bitter hop flavor to finish it off. Pretty refreshing if you like that sort of thing. Good mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation. Overall a pretty drinkable beer."
"Pours a clear but fairly dark ruby with some tan head. Nose is sticky sweet with a good amount of hops. Flavor is smooth with slightly firm hops with a sweet tone. Touch of wood there as well. A hint of bitter on the edge. Feel is nice with the carbonation on the tongue and good with the liquid feel too. Overall very drinkable. A smooth and even red ale. Well worth trying, just not an overly inventive beer."
"d: alhrabosky was kind enough to give me this one and now I want a lot more. I'll try this next to Nugget Nectar in a few months."
"Cheers, Scott."
"I had this beer two days later on-tap at Red Bones in Davis Sq. in Somerville, MA. This beer is very good, and I would add some overall points to the beer. The dry maltish backbone very much complements this beer, and the piney hop resin notes do come through quite nicely. There is also more of a creamy mouthfeel with the beer on tap."
"This is a well balanced beer that is easily drinkable for 6.5% ABV. However, like all hoppy beers it's better to drink this one fresh."
"I originally wanted to try this beer based upon an ad in some beer magazine, marketing works. I like the label with a lizard breathing fire and red hops. Cool name too, I assume this is heavily hopped with cascades based upon the name. The color id a nice orange red. It has a very nice malty and hoppy smell like a good barleywine almost. The taste is chewy, some malts and finishes with a nice hop bitterness that is quite enjoyable. Thanks to Wasatch for the trade, this is enjoyable."
"D: Definitely a hopheads beer. I had one and I need no more. The hops actually were not as overwhelming as you would think. I have had better beers from Ithaca."
"D - Quite drinkable red ale with a nice hop profile that's not overbearing. I tried this beer at the Harrisburg Brewer's Fest, which led me to seek out this offering from Ithaca. It's quite tasty and well-balanced, though not quite the hop monster as I was expecting. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Yeah, I'll be passing on this one from now on. I suppose it's decent, but there is much better available."
"D: The abv is apparent but it doesn't diminish the strength of the beer. This is another nice hopped up red ale, in the same mold as Nugget Nectar."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: I really like the IPA/Red ale combo, I love the idea of giving the hops something to really play with. I just wish this had a bit more malt character. This might benefit from a category change or addition. That being said, I'll be getting a few friends turned on to this one."
"A decent beer overall. Technical details do take away too much from drinkability and enjoyment of the brew."
"Went from the Ithaca apricot wheat to the Cascazilla and I might just say WOW! Medium copper / amber color hidden uinderneath a fluffy white head that faded quickly but left behind some exceptional lacing. This brew would fool you if it wasn't for the label ,smell and taste mimick that of a quality IPA- pine and grapefruit aromas with a slight bitter finish. Good mouthfeel, creamy and alittle oily.A really good beer, I want more!"
"D - A quality ale, appealing to the eye and nostrils. A very tasty cascade flavor and bitterness. Great w/ fish and chips, the red ale cuts through the grease and really refreshes w/ citrus and bittering qualities. The carbonation level and feel really benefit the overall taste and sessionability is high. After the first two I was still craving more."
"Pours a nice tawny copper color with a two-fingered light beige head that lasts for a good half minute. Decent lacing. Aroma is predominantly piney and citrusy hops, but you can sense a underlying caramelly malt backbone to the ale. The malt comes through in the flavor with some caramel sweetness, and is complemented nicely with a decent bite from the hops. A faint bit of berry at the tail end of the sip. A moderately dry finish. Maybe a bit overcarbonated, but I'm not put off by it. I find it hard sometimes to get really get into red ales, but this one's really good provided you're a fan of the hop. I've had it on-draught as well and the carbonation seems to be at a better level than that of the bottle."
"Smooth mouthfeel, yet the hop creates a nice contrary bite. I hate giving straight scores but this beer merits the consistancy."
"This is a very pleasant beer, easy to drink and is good in all characteristics."
"Poured into a draft glass a deep redish amber with a fair 1 finger head. Head disappeared relatively quick leaving little lacing throughout. Scent is a slightly citrus revealing a hint of piney shadowing. Taste is definately up my alley: nice citrus, grass, and pine balance. Very pleasing to have such a nice hoppy bite in a red ale. If you are a hophead, and also fond of red ales, and you haven't had this one try it!"
"Pours clear and a moderately dark amber color with less than a finger light tan head that fades fairly quickly without much lacing. The smell is nice and strong, a rich caramel malty sweetness, almost syrupy, with a less prevalent floral hop character. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated with a slight bitterness from the hops, far from a hop-bomb that the ""-zilla"" leads on to be. Full flavored, the mouth and the nose are quite similar. Taste is malty but with less caramel than the nose, with a measured citrus hop character. My tastes have really changed and my memory is slipping; my first experience was draft and i remember thinking it had more of a hoppiness to it. I'm glad that i pulled this one off the shelf. I plan on snagging a sixer or growler next opportunity at the brewery."
"Nice bronze color with the slightest of a red tint. Thin white cap that leaves some thin trails of lace. Smell is very hoppy, some citrus but mostly piney. Taste the same as smell, with the hops continuing to dominate. In my opinion the hops is a little overdone and becomes somewhat metalic as you drink. Mouthfeel is slick and oily. Overall this beer is what it says it's going to be, a blast of hops. While I love a well done hop bomb this one just dosn't have enough balance to really make me exited about it. It's good but just not great."
"A hopheads beer i'd have to say !"
"Part of an Assortment 12-pack (4 different Ithaca brews) I picked-up at the Beer Zoo outside Hershey PA. Hopheads rejoice. Your perfect beer has arrived. Gorgeous red/brown color with thick foamy head. Citrus of hops present in the smell. Nice carbonation that you notice when the beer hits your tongue; and then the hops kick in. Wow. Amazing flavor, but a little much for any but the most serious hops lover. I noticed that, after swallowing, I could open my mouth and the saliva glands were still pumping like crazy. Flavor-zilla. Beware, but enjoy!"
"The taste is smooth. Malty, but it lacks more flavor than that."
"This was a nice first beer to try from Ithaca. It's a hoppy red ale with a lot of flavour that's well balanced with the malt. I could easily drink this one again, and often at that. Definitely worth a try."
"Nice, somewhat muted orange in color. Quite foamy at first. Low aroma-I was expecting more. Somewhat grassy and citrusy. Big Cascade flavor though not as pronounced as I had thought it would have. Nice mellow malt sweetness. Good hop bite in the finish. I am thinking Nugget Nectars little brother. Good body. Very drinkable beer. Not as pronounced as say, SN Celebration. However, having been blasted by hops so much recently it is nice to see a regular pale ale with a liberal but sensible dose of hops. Not too shabby."
"Pours an amber red tone forms thick creamy textured light beige head that lasts for a good while before settling specks of lacing all around the pint glass. Aroma contains deep pine with tree bar accents and a flow grapefruit rind bitterness coming my way also a flowery herbal essence with a noticeable light caramel malt presence just barely peeking through. Flavors upfront with hop bitterness and flavor more pine tree bark earthy floral tones as well and yes the grapefruit appeal seeks through as well, barely any maltiness to balance out the aggressive nature of the hop additions this brew has to offer bitterness comes of somewhat one dimensional in the finish. Mouthfeel is in the light to medium body range pretty thin actually for all of the hop character this brew has to offer I was expecting more oily textures and carbonation packs a spritzy zing as well not as moderate as I would prefer from a brew like this. Drinkability is decent but I would get bored with no interplay between malt and hops the bitterness really lacquers onto the old palate and I could definitely go for some more balance here, decent overall worth a try of course."
"Pours a dark amber red color with not to much head. I can smell the hops from here. Big hop aroma and some sweetness with it. It has a nice flavor big hop, kinda sticky sweet, but in a good way. Can this be, I am starting to like red ales, although there are tons of hops in it."
"D- It's interesting, it's complex. I would love to have more malt flavor in this beer but it is sort of a toned down IPA which I think would be great for some occasions."
"Pours a deep clean/clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tannish head, lots of sticky lacing follows. The nose is slightly sweet, malty, hoppy, slightly piney, a nice touch of grapefruit, and some caramel. The taste is very nice, hoppy/malty, nice touch of grapefruit/piney, and healthy dose of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty amber ale, glad I have another bottle of it, highly recommended."
"On tap at the 4th Ave Pub. A beautiful pour -- crimson/ruby with a solid off-white head, well-retained with rings and lace. Smelled strongly of Cascade hops -- grapefruit and pine -- matched exquisitely with sweet bready malts. Tasted much the same, well balanced, with the sweets up front and the hops providing a crisp, slightly bitter finish. Nice medium body, good carbonation, and a dry finish -- a very impressive showing from Ithaca on a beer that could be formulaic -- my new standard for hoppy red ales!"
"Overall, it's a very nicely balanced and well-rounded ale with a good amount of drinkability. Very nicely done!"
"D: If you can handle the bitter hop blasts, this is a beer you could put a few back in a sitting."
"Cascazilla pours an orange amber with a quickly dissppearing head. Aroma is big and hoppy, but there is also a sweet fruity malt smell. Flavor is all hops upfront, tastes like I'm chewing on a fresh cone. The cascade hops make themselves obvious, citrusy and slightly herbal. For all the hop flavor, the bitterness is nice and well rounded, and it goes well with the malt flavor. A nice hoppy take on the American Red."
"D- A very drinkable beer for those who love hops and I am one. The different base for the hops (red ale vs IPA) throws a curve, but is well worth finding and drinking. Can wait for my next trip to the area to get a case of the stuff."
"Excellent."
"Since my review the losest review is a 3.9 that is pretty good. Lots of raves on this beer. Love the beer label"
"Poured a clear, brownish red into a pint glass. Straightforward grapefruit aroma, strong citrus hops, and some mild floral elements. Taste was surprisingly well balanced considering the hop-emphasis on the label. Tasty cascade hops with great, bready malt backbone. Clean, tangy citrus aftertaste and a solid mouthfeel round out this very well done red ale."
"A wonderful beer that I would buy again anytime. Well done."
"Medium-thick and creamy. Very smooth; milky. It's an outstanding drink. Hops are delicious but they don't ruin the taste buds."
"Let this one warm folks! I should also add that I found this at a gas station in Watertown NY while visiting my brother. What a gem. Its drinkability is off the charts."
"All in all, Cascazilla is a great beer for anyone in love with hops but doesn't like the high alcohol that tends to accompany highly hopped brews"
"A hoppy red, significant whitish beige head on brownish body. Hoppy aroma including C hopn and other hops. Above average carbonated, very bitter not balanced, thin mouthfeel. Not satisfying acidic citrus finish, although some caramel in there. Tatebuds demolished."
"Pours with nice big round bubbles, froathy head that would settle slightly from an initial two-finger level. Clear body, deep copper colour. A fine hoppy aroma - smells nice and fresh, green hops with plenty of citruis notes. A nice mouthfeel, void of alcohol but also seemingly absent is the hops - they just don't show up in the flavour like they did in the aroma. A serious lack of bitterness! Serious lack! Little breadyness. The beer has malt but its nothing exciting or overly tasty. While some of the aroma hops comes through a little, the malts do nothing do contribute to the flavour. All it seems to do is hold up the hops - actually it seems to take away from them and work against the beer."
"A very nice enjoyable beer."
"Cascazilla is a good name for this beer because of its monstrous taste. A great blend of tastes. Its a a red ale with a hoopy middle and a caramel finish. Its pours nicely and has a dark reddish/brown color. Just looking at it you know its going to be good. Ive had it both in a bottle and on tap and I would recommend either."
"Again, not the hop monster that it advertises itself to be but a solid beer none-the-less."
"Comments: The bottle describes this as a ""monstously hoppy red ale"". That is right on the money. This has been the best red ale I've tried to date. Very good! Bold flavors in perfect balance. Only downside is the lack of aroma."
"Medium bodied tongue coating, bubbly, and refreshing...overall an excellent brew even with some age on it...hopefully I can find some more of these....I will be looking into Ithaca Beer for my store, and am now even more excited about my trip to Ithaca next month."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, theres a good kick to it, this beer has all of the qualities that make it a good one to stick with for the duration of an evening."
"Pours a nice copper, with a red hue. Thin head,good retention,and lacing was very good. Smell is malty, but yet has an earthy hop sent as well. Body is medium with some carbionation. Taste is very much like an IPA. Malt, but with a good balance of citrus hops. This beer was put in a six pack of partly sunny I bought in July! I'm glad I finally got around to trying it!"
"This was on tap as well at Red's in Seneca Falls. If you're expecting a normal red ale, you're in for a surprise. This brew has a very generous amount of hops which makes it almost like an IPA. Color is a golden red with a foamy off -white head. Smell is hoppy/citrusy. Taste is bitter due to the hops with some sweetness as well due to the caramel malt. Definitely a unique ale, give this one a try."
"Poured chilled from a bottle into a pint glass it pours a copper color with ruby tint. A two-finger high frothy head sits atop of the body. After sustaining itself for a few minutes, the head leaves behind a clingy white surface layer with soem lacing on the glass. Aroma is mostly of hops on my nose first but followed by some slight fruity malts and a hint of toasted almonds. Sweet caramel hits my tastebuds first with a resin-hop flavor following that helps balance out the sweetness of the caramel. Maybe some slight fruit in there, but nothing to really write home about. Although this beer was rather sweet, a constant bitterness ""lays in the weeds"" and sneaks in throughout helping the balance. Without it, it'd be too sweet really. Mouthfeel is solid for the style. Prickly carbonation, as expected hits my tongue with a medium body. Maybe a bit of alcohol detected as well. Drinkability is solid, and it IS a tasty brew, but it may be just a bit too sweet drink more than a bottle or two. With a little more ""Zilla"" (hops) this one would balance better and be a ridiculously drinkable brew. Still, try it. I'm glad the beer matched the bottle."
"A nice reddish orange and little head. The smell is hoppy and there is a slight cinnamon touch as well. The taste is bitter and there is a hoppy aftertaste that last a while. The mouthfeel is smooth and the hoppinsee makes this beer a pleasure to consume. If this beer was more readily available, I would bring it home more often. The abv also shows itself a little bit."
"D: Very good. Nice balance of flavors but with hops dominating in the end. Just as I like it."
"I'm not a big Red Ale fan, but when it's rediculously hopped...I'm all over it! The taste is pretty smooth, with a great hopped character. It's not bitter at all, which is always a good thing. Overall it's a great beer with a great taste. If you like hoppy, this is for you."
"This is the hoppiest red ale that I've ever tasted. I love the malt/hop balance. If you are expecting a Killians Red, you'll be shocked by Cascazilla. It's a nice crisp beer that smells as good as it tastes. I have rarely seen it on tap, it's mostly found in bottles/cases. I have tried nearly every Ithaca beer made, and this is my favorite. I wish it was easier to find in Massachusetts."
"Drinkability: I like it, and if it were distributed here, would make it a regular. Very sessionable."
"pours reddish amber color with a one finger tan head that fades fairly quickly with a fair lacing to the finish. honey fruity hoppy smell. taste is caramel honey bready with hoppy ending. mouthfeel is medium and smooth with the hop lingering on. nice beer i would put it on my buy list."
"Pours a dark red clear with bubbles cascading leaving a thick tan head. The aroma is strong floural hops, honey, grapefruit, grassy earthy notes. The taste is very smooth, the perfect combination of malty red ale hopped up to give it that nice bite. This is a fantastic combo featuring honey, low carbonation, citrus, toffee, and makes it session quality."
"Take the maltiness of a good red ale and mix it with the bite of hops. I dig the concept. This beer pours a deep copper color with a medium-large ammount of tan head that stuck around for a while, leaving a tiny bit of lace on the glass interior. Aroma is deep, brassy and malty. This beer is hoppy, and I like it!"
"Slainte!"
"Finally decided to give this brew a try today, was I afraid of the CascaZilla? Nah, just for some reason have not had the Ithaca Brews in a long time. The brew poured to a rust color with a medium sized light tan head while leaving a nice amount of lace at the top of the glass. A fairly impressive looking brew. The aroma has a very enticing hop smell (citrus, grapefruit) that dominates but I am able to pick up a nice malt (toasted and caramel) scent in the background. The taste is actually quite smooth, for such a hoppy brew; actually the hop is not over the top but is clearly strong and dominant. Picking up a nice malt taste that has a sweet feel and goes well with the hops. With this being a red ale as highlighted on the bottle I guess I would expect to notice the malt a bit more and it is there. Over all this is a fantastic brew, not sure it lives up to its name as CascaZilla but is a great drink. One that I would grab at anytime!"
"This beer is awesome. As soon as I popped the top, me and my friend could smell the hoppy aroma. This is the best Red Ale I've ever had. Its smooth and well balanced, however, I couldn't taste any malts. There was also a fruity flavor that I couldn't figure out. Hell yea."
"D- Might be my favorite red ale... yup, it is..."
"Drinkability is low because while it tastes good, i fear two would numb the tastebuds with all the hops."
"I've been comparing pale ales around the country, this past summer, and bought this for it's ""monster dose of hops."" Cascazilla has the hops and ""nose"" to compare to,say, Pyramid Brewery's ""Thunderhead"" IPA, but without the ""dryness;"" I think your sister would like it!"
"Decent mouthfeel, medium bodied, low carbonation. I'd like a bit more carbonation to crisp this up a bit. Drinkability is good, fairly filling beer which limits how many I would have in a sitting, but good flavor and aroma would make me have one of these every now and then."
"I was pleasantly suprised by this choice, a total darkhorse when I purchased it. Tasty and easy enough to drink."
"I was surprised to see that a lot of folks didn't get much head from this beer. Mine poured with a huge cloudlike head that stuck around for the duration. Left lacy patches of sticky foam down the side of the glass. Mild floral hop aroma dominates. Taste is hoppy with a mellow malt backbone, just a hint of balancing sweetness. Really a rather tasty and enjoyable beer, I could probably session a few of these pretty easily."
"I think Ithaca has crafted a great beer here. Awesome job combining the characteristics of a red ale and an IPA. I would love to have this on cask."
"This is one of the most unique beers I've had in years - The hoppy taste without the bitterness is incredible. A great session brew for hop heads like myself."
"You know as soon as you smell this that its gonna be good and I dont just mean for hopheads. Smell is all hops but delivered in a subtle manner --what a fine pale ale. The taste is excellent too as it has some good maltiness up front followed by woody hops character. Nothing that bites very sharply but still is apprent that this is a very American style pale ale. I like it a lot. I see it has been labeled as an amber--I stand by my earlier impresions. For drinkability, quite excellent also."
"Colors range from a golden-yellow at the stem of the glass, up to a firery auburn at the surface, topped with a tan ring of foam. Grapefruit citrus with piney hops in aroma. More earthty hops in the taste, followed by a sweet fruity finish. Mouthfeel is a little sticky, but overall very refreshing. I can see this becoming a regular. Plenty of hop character, not too sweet, and a modest amount of alcohol."
"Thanks to Nutbrown for including this wonderful nectar in our trade!!"
"What a surprise this was. I didn't know what to expect from it when I bought it. Poured a bright shiny copper color and extremely clear. Formed a 3/4 inch head which quickly dissipated, leaving behind little to no lacing at all. The aroma is what initially blew me away. Wow! Extreme grapefruit, sweet malts, maltball candies, extremely floral aroma. Then the sipping began and again a bright smile shone across my face. This is my kind of beer. Sweet maltiness with cascade hops all over the place. Grapefruit, piney, and a touch of brown sugar. Comparable to a DFH 90-Minute IPA ""light"" would be a good description. Extremely tasty brew. Mouthfeel is a medium, velvety body ending a bit dry. The carbonation is somwhere between light and medium...just enough to be subdued but enough to be noticed as well. I am glad I picked this six-pack up on a blind whim and will definitely be coming back to it in the future. I'll have to try out the other Ithaca brews as well. Well done."
"This is a pretty good hoppy treat. Nothing mind-blowing, basically a shit-ton of cascades packed into a bottle."
"Cascazilla indeed."
"D: Well this is a nice beer. I'm finding that I like these bitter ambers more and more. Good for malt lovers and hop heads."
"Roasted nut flavor characteristic and not a whole lot more. How can you make a beer called Cascazilla, touting the Cascade hops, have a picture of hops on your label, and not bring the hops? Mouthfeel is somewhat week and insipid, and finish has a somewhat soapy taste to it. Not sure what Ithaca Beer intended with this one, but they failed."
"D: Good offering from Ithaca. Kind of reminds me of a very hoppy rye ale. Probably would be good on cask with more of a resiny oily flavor coming through."
"Taste is fruity, hoppy, with dry citrus flavors and long finish. It's a very refreshing beer, very drinkable, and can be served cold without giving up too much flavor."
"Drinkability: very quaffable. One of the better beers from Ithaca Beer."
"Taste is hoppy without high bitterness. Leafy but mild ruby red grapefruit leads out, with a medium biscuity body taking over. Slightly dry finish. Regardless of the name, this is no hop monster. Rather, just a nice red ale with a good deal of leafy and grapefruit hop flavor up front. Balancedzilla might be more like it."
"D: Quickly becoming a favorite, regardless of season. A wonderful beer."
"Ultimately, drinkability comes down to hop appreciation, with this one. I could have a couple."
"The mouth is sturdy and the beer has good active carbonation. This went well with my BBQ and was able to cut the heat of some of the spicier offerings. Well done!"
"$5 a glass"
"Obviously red body, with a healthy head, small lacing, nothing great, average. A nice blast of hops on the nose and tongue. I find this beer exceptionally average. A good craft beer that falls into the BA realm of 3.5-4.0 rating of a mediocre craft beer."
"This pours a clear amber with a large tan foamy head, a pretty good looking beer. The smell is a real citrus and hoppy aroma that's very strong. The taste is strong with hops for a red ale, this is an IPA to me. The hops are really overblown on this beer,I like the taste,but it's not really a up to the style.. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing pretty well,but the malt and hops are a little off. This is a decent beer,unusual but good. I'd have this again,but how about calling this what it is an IPA?."
"CRUX: GOOD HOPPY RED ALE EVERYDAY DRINKER. Why they don't just call it an IPA is baffling to me, but then, many things are. Oh, well. Wish I could get, say, ""Red Seal Ale"" by North Coast Brewing around here. Until then, this will do."
"The drinkability was average."
"Taste presents plenty of malt up front commingled with pine and grapefruit. Quite well balanced in fact, low bitterness for the amount of hop flavor and a pleasant caramel malt sweetness in through the middle. Body is on the lighter side of medium, and all around this is a pretty easy drinking beer. Finish left me with a bit of honey sweetness and mild lingering hop flavor. Although I wouldnt call this beer either monstrous or red, it is a good, tasty, almost sessionable brew and worth trying."
"Pour an amber copper with an initially large head that dissipates quickly leaving a bit of lacing. Floral hops are the main aroma..not overpowering...just right. A hint of malt starts on the front exploding into a nice hoppy presence that satys throughout. Bitterness is just about right. Very smooth yet with a bitter finish that is just right. Smoothness as menytioned before...yet with a nice hop finsih."
"One of the hoppiest beers i have had lately, although not to hoppy to take away from the overall flavor, that is what you get with the cascade hops. the taste in your mouth is unbelievable. The caramel malts really come out too. Although it is a red ale it was not overly red and not a flavor that you would associate with one."
"Musings: This is not a ""monstrously hopped"" beer - at least the flavor spectrum doesn't turn that way. Let it warm slightly and you will be rewarded. Great tastes combos and feel will bring you home."
"Came to the table a deep copper with a slight chilled haze a thinner but well retained white head.Nice intermingling of caramel malt and healthy dose of those cascades with the cascades holding a slight edge.Caramel malt hits up front with some doughy notes but the big pine and grapefruit character comes thru to dominate into a long finish.Very easy to drink and packed withat cascade goodness,I went picked up a couple of sixers after having this."
"This is an enjoyable, hoppy red ale that you don't see to often."
"This is a red ale alright. Mostly red with brownish hints and a solid looking body. As you can imagine based on the name there are a terrific amount of citrus hops in the nose. The taste is a nice surprise, balanced yet hoppy as hell. I like the fact that you can taste the hops here instead of just heavily bittered ale. The flavor and aroma tell me IBC is using a bunch of hops at the end of boil and/ or dry hopping, either way the effect is tasty. A decent body as I mentioned before. The drinkability is pretty good here."
"D - Easy drinking & a nice change of pace. The hints of sweet/sour fruit made it unique to me."
"- if you're from the right coast and you've spent your life drinking right-coast beers, well, yeah. Ok, I'm not even from the right coast but I hated this beer to begin with. It's about the cascades, man. Your typical Maine/New Hamster/MA brewery just doesn't use 'em. And why should they? Well, this beer does. And taking it after YEARS of not drinking a single beer with cascades in it, well, was very harsh. Even then I acknowledged how well it was made - I just couldn't appreciate the flavor. Well, let me tell you, now I can. And it's awfully good..."
"Clear orangey copper colored with a thick anf frothy while head that sits up high and sticks around for most of the experience. Sharp aroma of tangerine rind, some piney notes, but no malt. Flavor is hoppy upfront, tingly and crisp, mostly of tangy citrus peel and grapefruit, some pine. Some sweet malts arise in the finish, but struggle to bust through the stronger hop profile. a bitter citrus peel lingers. Even mouthfeel, but not too full. Pretty hoppy for a red ale, and I might go so far as to say a little out of balance for the style since the malt presence is very understated. A decent selection though, I'd have it again."
"Great name for a beer. Pours a beautiful bronze with a thick, appetizing head. The nose contains that familiar Cascade grapefruit and some pine in a huge hop nose. There's also some nutty malt aromas underneath the hops. As would be expected, fruity hop notes dominant the taste of Cascazilla; the overall impression is of a slight sweetness at the front of the palate and a huge bitterness at the back. One nice twist this beer has is the caramel malt (being a red ale), which provides a nice undertone to the hops. This beer is medium bodied and very acidic. Not the most acidic beer I've had, but quite acidic nonetheless. This is the main drawback with this beer: its high acidity reduces the drinkability for me, and makes it unlikely that I'd want to order a bunch of these."
"Transparent bronze with thich ecru froth. Green Cascade blast to my nostrils -- astringent pineyness, not too citrusy. The aroma is almost chemical, kind of like new carpet. Grapefruit pith and pine needle flavor and that's about it. Any malt is completely MIA. Slight peach juice in the finish. Light to medium body, juicy, and quenching. None too complex, but I'd pick this up again if I really wanted hops and nothing else."
"i will certainly revisit.. their double ipa is nice too- keep your eyes out."
"The cascade intensity gives this one a nice pine and citrus flavor and a light body. A nice brew for an introduction to the Ithaca Beer Co."
"Deep amber, good clarity, topped with a thick cream colored head. Speckly lace, good head retention. Pungently hoppy aroma. Lots of citrus and pine, just pure american hops. Mild caramel malt background, pretty clean, a little bit of floral esters, allowing the hops all the spotlight. If you like big hop aroma, this is for you. Hops punch through immediately in the flavor. Moderate toasty caramel malt, smooth on the palate, slathered with bright green hop juice. Big citrus and pine, moving into a boldly bitter, agressive finish. Great hop flavor, a little floral, with pungent citrusy notes. Orange and grapefruit. A high level of carbonation, perhaps a little too much for my tastes. Something a little milder would serve to increase the drinkability. Still pretty nice, though, especially after sitting a while. Lingering hop flavor. Really great stuff for a session, when you're jonesing for some hops. Great balance, weighted heavily towards the hops, but not so much as to be too challenging or overpowering. Not super complex, mostly a cascade hop showcase, but I don't think a beer has to be really crazy to be good. This one's excellent, I'd say."
"I think that Dogfish Head IPAs ( 60 and 90....haven't had 120 yet)have spoiled me...personally can't imagine any IPA is going to top them."
"Last swigs: This is what it claims to be. Hoppy red. Thanks to fellow BA IthacaBaron for giving me the bottle. I must admit that I was excited to get this one."
"This was handed to me with a light to medium head with a grassily hoppy nose. The color was a quintessentially fall-like orangish/light-brown and it was also very cloudy, hence Imbiber's reluctance to pour it without letting it settle. I did not find the cloudiness to be bad, so no worries, mate. It was a very hoppy beer, especially on the palate. The finish left me licking my lips and the roof of my mouth both for more of the flavor and to clear the residue. Yummy."
"Ithaca generally is very mediocre, and this is their masterpiece (besides small runs like the DIPA). I asked the woman at the brewery if more Cascazilla is made every year -- she said to watch the stores soon. Good news for me :) I feel that while the aging changed some characteristics of the beer, it is just as good as when it went in."
"Thanks to fellow BA CharlesW for the bottle. Some excitement when pouring, ie, there was a bit of head, but it has since died down, and didn't even leave me with any lacing. I enjoy the aroma: malty, some grapefruitiness around the edges. The mouthfeel was a bit thick, I would still call it medium though. There's initial maltiness, followed by some low grapefruit citrusy ness. I enjoyed this one, am glad the abv wasn't overwhelming."
"12 ouncer sampled, no freshness dating, but it does have a Japanese horror film inspired label, a red hop spitting dragon and everything! Pours dark honey amber, creamy dark tan head, showing nice retention and also well dispersed, layered and fragmented lacing. Strong hoppy nose, burning the ole' nostrils with hop oil goodness. This is a pleasantly malty ale, hops quite present but not over powering. Notes of whole wheat, rye and, flowery, grainy, piney hops. Large and flavorful brew. Sort of reminds me of Arrogant Bastard. Sweet, creamy MF. Malty/hoppy/tasty. Seek this one out and enjoy-well done Ithaca"

"According to the label, I just finished a ""monstrously hoppy red ale"". I've had very few of Ithaca's beers, but it's hard for me to imagine that any of them are better than this. It is my considered opinion that the amber/red ale style needs a swift kick in the ass. Who better to provide it than the city-destroying, hop monster... Cascazilla."
"Ithaca does it again...now if they can only work their distribution into my area."
"Bender: Another solid brew from Ithaca. Top of their line. Serious competition to Landmark IRA. Glad to see Ithaca going out on a limb and being adventerous."
"poured witha a clear red amber witha fluffy light tan head that gradually settled to a skim. dry hoppy aroma, flowery and herbal. very citrusy witha grapefruit like acidity, very odd rhubarb like sourness kinda tart - not exactly desireable on my nose. nice slightly thick mouthfeel followed by a immediate dry hoppy taste. smooth body and a highly drinkable. good but the draft is so much better."
"Overall: A good amber ale -- the name really psyched me up to get an aromatic IPA though, and so I was a bit let down."
"While not ""monstrously hoppy"" or whatever the label suggests, this is one hopped up and refreshing beer. From what I've read this one is brewed with Cascade hops, and having cut my teeth on these western flowers, this beer kinda tastes like home. Very crisp, very hoppy, yet light. Something to drink on a hot summers day, if they're still making this fine brew by then."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a mildly malty scent with a boat load of Cascade hops, which were grown in NY. It is quite bitter and floral. The taste is good. It is refreshingly bitter and hoppy all the way through. The malts add a nice buffer and balance. It goes down easy and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great American red ale. I love the hops and the balance. This is a great offering from Ithaca; a good drinker."
"Nice crystal clear, ruby red body, moderate light tan head. Not much head retention. Lots of citrusy and flowery hop aroma. As the beer warmed, I could smell more of the sweeter malt. For all the hop aroma, the beer isn't nearly as bitter as I expected. It's much less hoppy than an IPA, and the bitterness doesn't stay around long in the mouth. It's actually pretty sweet tasting. There is a definite hop presence, just not as much as I expected from the bottle. For me, this isn't a bad thing, though, it's quite a drinkable and great tasting brew."
"There is also a nice sweet backbone, which coaxes a sweet orange flavor from the hops, and lends some caramel and toffee flavors. The mouthfeel is very rich, and does feel like a double IPA. Drinkability is high, would be an excellent session IPA. Good job Dan and crew..."
"Drinkability is very solid for a large hopped beer, malt cuts bitterings just enough to make very enjoyable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head above the dark copper brew. Head exhibits reasonable retention, with okay lacing. Aroma is slightly malty, with piney hops effects everywhere. Taste continues where the nose left off, slight initial malts, which quickly fall to the strong hops character. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent. Don't see that many sweet yet hoppy brews that are easily drinkable. This is one."
"Like so many other very good new brews, I've been too busy enjoying Cascazilla to bother reviewing. It's one of those beers. Generally speaking I've been doing more drinkin and less geekin. But here goes...I am enjoying this crystal clear ruby copper colored beauty as I pen this nonsense. The cascade nose cuts through the senses and gives a clue of what's to come. This is a boldly hopped brew. But one dimensional it is not. Quickly shifting gears, the aroma turns caramel sweet. The first taste is sharp bitterness, smoothed out promptly by malty graham cracker goodness. Lingering, oily bitterness and citrus finish it off. The hop flavor is big too. Drinkability is outstanding. Big ups to Ithaca for this brew."
"I have always enjoyed Ithaca beers, though they don't seem to get much recognition or respect as a great beer. Casczilla is a very easy to drink amber that makes anyone comfortable with it in their hands. A great session beer."
"Its a little unfortunate that this sour character really detracts from what could otherwise be a fine beer."
"Pours a clear mahogany color, with medium brown-white head. Smell is immediately attractive, deep and potent, composed of nutty, earthen flavors. Taste is excellent. First of all, the hops are extremely complimentary; they draw you into this beer, yet they dont have the sharp bite one would often find in highly-hopped beers. Meanwhile the malt is meaty and strong, filling yet still makes for a refreshing beer. A flavor hard to describe, but easy to compliment. Try this beer when given the opportunity  you will find yourself demanding more."
"Mouth feel is a little overcarbonated, which adds sharpness. Otherwise though, it's interesting to delicious beer."
"Hell of a kick here, I'm 2/3 done with a 1/2 liter share of the growler, and it's slapping the bejeezus out of me. Not something I'd drink more than one of in a night, but hey--that's the point of creative brews. I keep wanting to take another swig to figure out the ever-elusive two or three tastes I can't name, but they don't come to me. This is a solid beer, and an excellent beer for a beer advocate; do you dig the distinction?"
"Bottles should be out mid to late September. They're billing it as a hoppy red ale made with 100% cascade hops. The label looks pretty cool, it's got a lizard breathing firey red hops along the bottom and the lettering (can't remember if it's Ithaca Beer, or Cascazilla) is a cut out of a waterfall picture."
"Backwash: Maybe Im way off the mark, but this is now IBs best beer, aside from the super-limited Double IPA. Ithaca Beer has chosen to explore a fairly consistent (and I think very successful) house style rather than making another West Coast IPA clone. If you crave citrusy, grapefruity flavors, you might want to look elswhere; but youll be missing some pretty interesting, flavorful beers. I for one havent had too many American micros that really do finesse as well as Ithaca does, and these latest beers have improved upon the slight lack of flavor concentration apparent in some earlier beers (actually the whole line seems to have improved, especially the reformulated Pale Ale)."
