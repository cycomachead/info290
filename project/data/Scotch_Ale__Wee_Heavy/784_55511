The taste follows nicely with added flavor of toffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. It's got a relatively light mouthfeel but it's carbonated nicely.

4.32,6.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I cellared this one for ... at least a year and a half. I think it was longer, but it got a little lost in the back of the cellar. Obviously, the basement trolls that are supposed to keep track of my beers are not doing their job. With this failure noted, the beer was poured into a snifter with a dark brown appearance. A generous head of close to an inch crowned the glass, leaving a generous lacing as it receded. It looked like a the empty sides of an cup after a chocolate milk shake had been finished. A big bourbon aroma was present with hints of grape and vanilla in the background. The bourbon establishes itself early in the initial taste. The sweetness of the scotch ale stays in the background leaving a nice backbone. Notes of tobacco, grape skin, sweet malts are present and make an impression. I am a little surprised by the intensity of the carbonation on this one. The taste did not last as long as I would have liked, but the intensity of the taste compensated for the endurance. In the aftertaste, the bourbon mellows leaving a mild warming sensation. This is not surprising since the Brewers Gone Wild line of Tyranena typically is not high in ABV. Darker fruits emerge with a greater intensity as the sweet malts fade to the back of the throat. This beer aged quite well, though I recall it was also very good in a more fresh state.","JohnnyHopps","Nov 03, 2012"

4.04,0,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Very nice. Carbonation in the mouth is much higher than what the pour indicated. Dark bready semi sweet malts, vanilla, toasty oak, bourbon, dark fruits of plum, raisin, prune. Some light peat smokiness. Butterscotch on the finish with a light buttery flavor but not diacetyl. If the carbonation in the mouth was just slightly lighter I think it would have made the palate rounder and creamier and helped out a lot. But nonetheless this is a very nice easy drinking beer. Loved these BA offerings from Tyranena.","mcallister","May 06, 2011"

Flavor is smootha and richly sweet with accents of vanilla as well. Bourbon notes are subdued, but this is very drinkable for a Wee Heavy. Medium-full body with no impression of alcohol on the buds. Lightly carbonated and quite drinkable for the style.","Bighuge","May 05, 2011"

A lot of vanilla, nougat and oak...blended with a nice sticky sweet scotch ale....not much of a peated malt smokiness...if it has some it is muted by the barrel aged impressions...Body feels full....like I said a little sticky sweet....excellent aroma and excellent taste. Great beer.","ZAP","May 04, 2011"

Rich aroma of clove and heather almost, with a solid base of caramel and nuts. The flavor was a bit sharp, not as polished, but very mush in the game. Started with a light fruity note, hints of hops, piney almost with a nice earthy tone to it and a rich caramel note. Lots of nutty tones in the fnish with lots of fresh flower like flavors mixed in.

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunrise ruby topped by a finger of light sandstone foam. The nose comprises oak, caramel, light toffee, light vanilla, and a touch of liquor. The taste doesn't seem to want to deviate from this winning formula, though the oak is a bit more pronounced, and hints of chocolate and mild dark greens come through near the finish, tying things up quite nicely. The body is a sleek medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, one of the better barrel-aged editions put out through the BGW series. I would definitely enjoy this one again.","TMoney2591","Apr 05, 2011"

3.65,-9.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to seeswo for the opportunity to try this one. Pours a deep amber with a loose, quarter inch head that dissipates into a frothy band and a thin skim. Slashes and spots of lacing are exposed on the tilt side of the glass. Nose is buttery, sugary and expresses a light boozy character. Taste reveals rich butterscotch flavors initially, but quickly becomes somewhat thin and watery with a slightly grainy quality to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a mild, even carbonation and a buttery/oily/creamy texture. Decent, but not what I would consider style consistent. Nonetheless an interesting brew.","Jwale73","Mar 14, 2011"

4.49,11.1,4,5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a mahogany color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing (which is alright of a bourbon barrel aged beer). The aroma reminds me of a chocolate shop that makes its own chocolates and caramels. There is caramel, vanilla, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, nougat, bourbon, and wood. I could smell this beer all day long. It is, perhaps, the only beer that I have ever wanted to grant a 5.5 score for aroma here on BeerAdvocate. The taste is a bit milder than the aroma. There is less caramel, vanilla and chocolate, with the bourbon and wood staying at about the same intensity. It is still really good, but it isn't great in the way the aroma is. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. I have a feeling this beer would be better with a slightly full body, and very low carbonation. Overall, this is a really good beer though, and I would highly recommend it to others.","KarlHungus","Mar 06, 2011"

3.87,-4.2,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The appearance is a nice amber color, but that is lighter than I'm used to seeing many other scotch ales. The aroma is quite pleasant there is the distinct butterscotch and caramel notes that are commonly associated with the style, but this adds a light amount of the pleasant vanilla aroma perhaps from oak barrels, or perhaps from vanilla addition. The taste pretty much follows that same profile as was found in the aroma. There is a stronger maltiness on the palate though as compared to the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and astringent, then I let it warm up probably to around 60 degrees and the mouthfeel became buttery and sweet. The fact is though that it took a lot of waiting for the bottle to get up to that temperature, almost as if I should have drank it straight from the cellar rather than waste time chilling it in the fridge. Still a very nice beer and I enjoyed the end product.","Vdubb86","Feb 21, 2011"

3.25,-19.6,4,4,2.5,2.5,4,"A vigorous pour generates a reasonable tan head atop a translucent reddish brown body. Smells of vanilla, the faintest touch of smoke and sugary malts. Smells pretty good. The taste is somewhat disappointing, there's a bit of dryness and a hint of an unidentifiable off-flavor in the finish with limited flavor of vanilla and otherwise very little in the way of bourbon. As a scotch ale, it is somewhat bland and uninteresting. The blended barrel aging offers only slight improvement. The beer is also slightly under carbonated and doesn't take on the expected creaminess from the barrel aging. It does leave a sugary feeling on the tongue, In spite of these things, this beer is relatively drinkable. I've had much better from this series.","seeswo","Feb 11, 2011"

The creamy mouthfeel is great and fulfilling. I could swirl this one around in my mouth all day!

If you like the Sheepshagger, you'll really like this one. This beer looked so light while pouring, and is very clear in the glass. It's really surprising how it thickens up a little, to drink a very nice and smooth medium in body.
