"good Scottish ale"
""

"Feel: Smooth, a little on the thin side"
"very, very, thin to be consider a scotch ale, still not so bad for magic hat"
"Really poor excuse for a scotch ale, tastes more like a bock than scotch to me."

"Overall: My first scotch ale and I am impressed. Smooth, creamy mouth with a chocolate caramel taste. Very good."
""
""
"Overall, this is a well made brew, but not a great example of the style."

"The taste has a lightly toasted and sweet malt note with a mild bitterness taking up the rear.   Not as malty sweet as what I like in Scotch Ales but it is likable in it way."
"This is an interesting beer, smells kind of nutty and malty... taste is  like blue/gorgonzola cheese mix in hops, very interesting taste... that I kind of like.  Not a beer you'd want all the time but definitely one worth speaking out once and awhile. If you like different tasting beers you should definetly give this beer a pour."

"O: Aside from a weak nose, this is a nice scotch ale with a pleasant amount of smoke. Never overwhelming or cloying, just enough to make it different. Glad they brought it back for this fall"

"The smoke seems to open up more and more as time goes by which is not a problem for me. I actually think the use of peat here is quite smart considering how it blends with the other malt flavors. Not for those who don't like smoke but I actually think it's one of Magic Hat's better brews in recent times."
"Aroma is a bit fruity, malt. Pour is deep amber orange with thick white head. Head dissipates quickly, leaves a very spotty lacing. Taste is warm and mellow. Fig and datenut bread. Nice for a chilly evening."
"I like this. Its good for a cold fall night. Lots of malty sweetness without being cloying. Pretty good for magic hat. Might make a better winter ale."

"The body just does run into full territory, but it just skirts the edge there.  It's crisp and creamy, carbonation staying even and the feel keeping to the sweeter end."

"12 oz bottle.  Pours dark red with long lasting, white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of caramel, cherries, hints of grassy hops and smoke.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Caramel, piney hops, smoked wood and ripe fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long and semi-dry.  Not bad for Magic Hat."

"Jinx brewed by Magic Hat brewing company with an ABV of 6.9%. This brew pours out a nice dark amber color with a nice white head. The smell is rich with sweetness and some grains. There is nothing bad about this brew so far. Now for the taste it is bold with caramel taste and some grains at the end. This brew has a nice balance to it. There is a lot going on in this brew. the taste is great and the color is nice.  I have to say that Magic Hat Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. the mouth feel is nice for being 6.9% ABV. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. This brew was great choice."
""

" Overall a nicely done 3.75 for Jinx - Magic Hat Brewing Company. If the bite were just slightly less ""wee heavy"" then I would drink this regularly. Came as part of the Night of the Living Dead sampler pack, so I doubt this brew will have a recurrence in my fridge."

"A very unique scotch ale to say the least.  Smokey and sweet malty and bold. Smells sweet like gummy bears, tastes like Scotch.  Not to overpowering as with many scotch ales, right on the money.  Pours a dark red amber with a thin head and minimal lacing.  May be my new favorite Magic hat beer."

"This was one of the worst beers I have ever had. It has a chemical after taste. I love all styles of beers. I can not understand the high ratings it's gotten on here.. I had to pour 8 oz out. I just couldn't drink it. I like all the other beers magic hats has. But Wow!!!!!!"
"Overall: a good solid brew, but I was expecting something closer to a scotch wee heavy."

"Had a bottle of this back on 4-8-08. This beer was kind of a new style for me when I had just started trying beers. Not really know what a Scotch Ale was I proceeded to did out. The beer was rather nice shade of red with a really nice head that lasted for a little bit. The smell was a little roasted and sweet, I found it to be fairly inviting. The taste was sweet at first which faded into a nice bitter aftertaste. Overall I wish this beer hadn't been retired, I would like to try it again one day."
"D - Not a bad session ale at all. The flavors were strong enough to keep you intrested while never overwhelming or become too sweet to drink. Would not have been hard to throw down more then a fw of these in a sitting."
"Poured into a snifter. The color is a moderately-dark brown color with a light head. The nose brings some dark fruits, roasted malt, light toffee, and some caramel. The taste has some dark fruits and also includes a bit of light candied toffee. Feel is nice and a bit heavy. Drinks well enough, but nothing to really pull me back for seconds."
"A bit of old school craft beer here, packed with flavor yet not overkill. Without a doubt a choice pick for the fall season though we would not be against Magic Hat brewing it year round."
"Just had the 2008 jinx. Had about half of the flavors at about half the intensity. Worthy of about half the rating, went downhill fast."
"D - Mild and smooth. Decent overall ale, but towards the weaker end of the scotch ale category."
"D- Could drink this all night while siting by a campfire."
"This is more of a sipper or a 2-at-the-most type beer for me due to the predominance of sweetness. Overall a very tasty beer, would definitely try again."
"Poured into a tulip glass dark golden, small frothy head diminishing to light lacing. Absolutely no detectable nose...I could smell a thing. Mouthfeel is light. Seems like a well rounded beer, starts with a hoppy taste, then turning to a malty sweetness. I can't make my mind up about this brew...I usually enjoy most Magic Hat offerings, but this one may need another taste later..."
"Probably not something i would seek out again although its not bad."
"Final Thoughts - Perfect autumn beer. I always look foward to picking up a twelve of this. A unique brew from Magic Hat that deserves at least one purchase. The flavor of smoke and whiskey work well together and provide a synergistic relationship. Give it a try in the Fall!"
"Not a very drinkable beer for me, I certainly won't have another."
"Final Thought: A great offering to those beer connoisseurs looking some something original and not overpowering. Very pleased."
"Longneck poured into a tulip style glass. January 09 expiration notched on the rear label. An aggressive pour produced a big, billowing head that arched over the top of the glass and held for a bit. The cream colored head died down to a minimal covering after a few minutes. Clear red color with a swirling of sediment from the bottom of the bottle mixed through. Smell is malt dominated with notes of caramel, dark toast, dried fruits, and a hint of smoke. Smoked almond flavor to start off, followed by prune, cherry, dark toasted bread and sweet caramel. The finish includes smoke and toasted malt. A high level of carbonation mingles with a medium-full body. The flavors of this beer, while good, would prove to be a bit overbearing after a while for me, along with the nearly 7%."
"Drinkability: Tastes fine, good mouthfeel..so this works."
"Poured a dark copper color with a two finger brown head that enjoys hanging around for a while complimented by suspended yeast sediment. Aroma is that of caramel and alcohol for the most part. Taste definitely consists of caramel malt and interestingly enough a bit of smoke as well and maybe even moss. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy like a scotch ale should be. Drinkability is very easy due to creaminess but this beer is just not quite my cup of tea due to the earth flavor the malts impart on it. Would drink this beer again without having to twist my arm though."
"Jinx is a pretty good beer. It has its flaws. The nose could use some work, carbonation's a little high, and it could really use somthing to add depth and character. Something spicy, maybe? All in all, it's better than I expected and is well worth a try. Thanks, Chris."
"Mouthfeel has a velvety texture with a tight carbonation. Nice example of the style"
" Dark brown color beer with a thin tan head. Aroma dark fruit,bread and faint earthy herbal hops . Flavor is brown bread,faint smoke,caramel,and maybe cherries. Nice mouthfeel. An odd but solid offering,fun to try but not really my thing."
"A deep amber color, with a quater inch thick head forming on top. The head is beige in color, showing tremendous retention, staying there longer than one would expect. A malty scent at the front, with a touch nof smokiness with woody green fragrance at the end. The malt is straight out strong in the taste, sweet, but not over bearing. Then the smoke comes foward and gives you what you expect from a scotch ale. Then a grassy green flavor comes in right the end, is a bit of a put off from the smokiness. A medium bodied feel with a chewy finish, with a slight dryness at the end. A solid to good scotch ale, the smoky flavor does make it a good choice to go with any smoked food."
"D..I found this moderately drinkable. Not difficult to drink, but I doubt I'd have more than 2-3 in a session. I did like the smoked scent and flavor, but it didn't last long enough in my experience."
"My first review on BA. Thin head, great dark amber color. Tastes of smoky coffee/toffee. Occasional scent of spiced rubbing alcohol but not on every sip. Smooth with a nice silky mouthfeel. Bitter but not overwhelming aftertaste with a nice warming hit from the alcohol content. Glad I picked one up."
"Drinkability is pretty high for me. I like the wee bit of smoke, the smoothness, the lighter body, the well hidden ABV, pretty much everything about this beer save for the nose, which isn't bad, but has that metal I don't care for."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"Pours a dark brown/copper with a decent size head and intermittent lacing down the glass. Bready, malty scent. Taste matches it -- biscuit, bready, super malty. I can't detect any actual smoke in this beer, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. Thumbs up."
"Matched with the malty taste of the beer there is also a sweet and caramel element at play that comes through nicely. This is where it seems as though Jinx stands apart from the rest because the sweet complexity within the taste does not seem to be syrupy or fake. There is also a hint of both dark berries and nuts at work within the taste."
"D - This most striking thing about this pint, was the mellowness and smoothness... While the individual parts (appearance, smell, taste) were all solid, the sum of the parts worked together to create a great experience... I could enjoy this one after another..."
"[EDIT] Holy crap! As this brew warms, and I scan some of the other reviews, it hits me, this DOES taste like a Tootsie Pop! Crazy. I'm not changing the flavor rating, but just thought I'd mention."
"D- one or two is nice; mybe a bit too strong on the alcohol taste for me"
"D - This is underpowered and pretty boring honestly. Its more like a mild brown ale than a wee heavy. The nutty aftertaste isn't bad, and its a damn good looking beer, but it somehow fails to deliver. Mediocre, really."
"Taste is well balanced between maltiness and hoppiness. Earthy after taste. Little thickness in the mouth."
"It's eminently drinkable, and, when I'm in VT, it's an enjoyable wither beer. If this isn't readily accessible, though, it's probably not worth seeking out/paying $12-a-six for."
"Nothing special here...IMO, not worth the money or the calories. But at the same time, it is hard for me to say anything to negative about it."
"This beer poured a dark brown with copper highlights and a two-finger tan head. The smell is sweet malt with some smokiness. The taste starts off with some nice sweetness and smokiness that is cut in the middle by some hops that leads into a pretty clean finish. The mouthfeel is nice and thick with a little bit of creaminess and some fine carbonation. This beer sits a little heavy, so I probably won't go immediately for another. However, it is remarkably tasty and complex."
"D - Very drinkable. I'll have to find more of this. Yet another beer I could find here in CO."
"Drinkability: One of the better Scotch Ales I've had, but no comparison to Skullsplitter (so far, the King of Scotch Ales, at least in my opinion.)"
"(..and Talisker is Where Its At)"
"Drinkability: Surprisingly good, and it has most everything you could be looking for - a good dose of malts, fruity yeasty notes, smoke, hop bitterness. Alcohol is spot on for the style, even a little low, perhaps, and well-hidden. Just a nice, drinkable, sessionable seasonal from Magic Hat, and one of their more enjoyable beers, IMO."
"At 6.9% this beer catches you completely off-guard. You think it's a typical Magic Hat session beer, but it turns out it's a bigger beer. Honestly, it's just a perfect American old/scotch. Not at all smokey, not at all overly malty and muted, just very drinkable. A fabulous beer from Magic Hat."
"D - A session beer for sure...I was very pleased with this one from Magic Hat"
"Smooth drinker, and a damn fine beer."
"This is the second brew I have had from Magic Hat that has made me just want to keep drinking it to try to figure out how they heck they did that! Easily drinkable with the flavors beautifully masking the near 7% ABV. Check this one out!!"
"D: Lots of complexity here, with layers of unique flavors. This is a really interesting and enjoyable brew. It's also not difficult to drink, despite a relatively robust ABV and strong flavors. I'll be looking for this one again."
"This poured a clear auburn with nice tan head. It smelled like sweet honey and caramel malts with lemon yeast and salty cashews, and a bit of roasted cinnamon. It tasted like nutty malt with caramel and copper hops, and some sweet yeast and spices. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a tasty malty beer with nice flavor and good body. There was nothing too unique about it, but it was clean and easy to drink. This was definitely more enjoyable than other Magic Hats I've tried."
"Easy drinker. A pretty good beer, but it is a little too sweet for my taste."
"Not my favorite Scotch Ale. You could drink this as a session beer. Not impressed."
"Small head with minimal lacings on a light brown body. A sweet, sugary malt smell with some smoked/roasted malts tucked in there and a decent amount of hops in the background. A heavy, roasted malt like taste that is also creamy and smooth. Full-bodied w/ a drying backbite with minor hopiness as this beer tucks in a dark fruit-like taste to mix things up. Comes across as really balanced. An interesting beer that I could have anytime."
"It's complex, but I didn't really enjoy it. Glad there were only three bottles of this in the Participation 12er. Below average."
"D - Very nice. Drinkable and approachable without losing the malty focus."
"This is an intriguing beer. Complex and challenging yet satisfying and very drinkable."
"Feel is really nice, smooth and creamy, full bodied, with carbonation that keeps the malt from sticking to the tongue. I could drink many of these - constantly."
"the color was a nice dark amber color. the aroma was of a great roast on the malt. the flavor had that delicious cereally malty flavor. Loved the roasted aspect. A little sweet but not too bad. A little spice with little hop flavor. A nice medium bodied fall beer. I recommend it to anyone who likes fall beers."
"D: Magic Hat has crafted a beer in it's own class. I've never had anything similar to this, very strong to say the least, but definetley drinkable. Again, look out for the slight ""alcohol"" taste you'll get on the backdrop of this beer, I don't know if I hate it or love it but it definetley makes this brew stand out from other Autumn selections."
"D - I had two of these and could easily have had more. ABV a bit high for this to be a session beer, but it goes down nice and easy."
" ~ I'm very impressed with the overall goodness of this brew. I will look forward in the future to bringing home a sixer. My only hope is that I'm able to find it locally."
"This brew poured a dark brownish copper with barely any head. It smells of very sweet malt. It's sweet and medium-bodied in the mouth and finishes sweet and almost smoky. I find it strange the flavors seem both strong but subtle. It's a pretty interesting concoction that I can't say I like a ton, but it was still worth a try."
"Dark amber colored ale with a slowly fading head.Aroma is burnt oak.Taste is oak,citrus and atouch of caramel or toffee.For a 6.90 ABV this goes down very smooth.I have nothing but good things to say about this one.Highly recommended and would purchase again!!"
"Lagniappe: the explanation on the bottle mighnt not mean much, but I wouldn't really know how to describe this beer anyway. Aparrently Magic Hat didn't either. And that's ok."
"D: There is a lot of complexity here that makes it fun to drink and the considerable alcohol does not deter. This is a different Magic Hat offering from what Im used to but good. Albeit not my favorite of styles, but I like the smokiness."
"D - Good beer."
"Jinx has made me re-evaluate my opinion of Magic Hat. Before this I had tried a few of their other beers (#9 and Circus Boy) and had been underwhelmed, but this was great. I'm looking forward to trying some of Magic Hat's other seasonals as well as their higher gravity line."
"D = Notwithstanding my complaint on the mouthfeel, this is a nice beer to just sit back and drink. Further, while at 6.9% ABV it cannot be pounded, it is a beer that one could have a couple of without being in danger and it goes well on a cool evening."
"I liked this. Now I'm regretting it's a fall seasonal -- I'd like to have some of this around through the winter. Cheaper than Dirty Bastard, Broughton and Belhaven and conveniently available at Trader Joe's. Certainly one of the better offerings from Magic Hat."
"D- an excellent treat but the bold smokiness can become tiring after awhile."
"D- A tasty pick. I was pleasantly surprised by this scotch ale."
"A pretty good Scotch Ale to come out of the Northeast once again. Robust with a good bit of complexity. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but not really in the Wee Heavy territory, is it now?"
"Along with Magic Hat's Hi.P.A., Jinx is amongst this breweries best beers."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice ale, falling somewhere between a strong Belgian pale ale and a normal English one. Unusual and delicious."
"d. This is a good session beer, and a decent stab at the style. A good seasonal offering."
"This was a great beer. So far one of the best Ive had from Magic Hat. The smell and taste of smoked malts and hops is just so delicious and refreshing. It smells great, looks great, tastes great, its got a very unnoticeable high ABV.. solid beer."
"Overall this wasn't bad but it wasn't that good. There's a chance that because I got this from a grocery store it'd been exposed to the sun for a while, but I just wasn't very impressed. By no means is this an ""avoid"" beer, but I will probably not be buying this again."
"Drinkability: It's so-so, it's okay, but geez, that label is a bit on the creepy side."
"One awesome and complex brew..."
"A fairly standard amber ale with some nice smokiness, but some issues as well. Amber color with a minimal head. The flavor is solid, some caramel and smoke, but the aftertaste has a very soapy, cleaning fluid, vaguely perfumey quality. A bit of an alcohol burn, which is neither a negative nor, in this case, much of a positive. What's good is not original, and what's original is not good."
"D: Good stuff. Even with the slightly higher ABV and the slightly sweet taste, it doesn't feel like too much. Perfect for this time of year."
"Nice stuff..."
"I purchased a few of these and the first one was served into a pint glass,not such a good taste there.Then I poured into a thistle glass and that seemed to do the trick."
"D - A very good and drinkable Scotch ale"
"Pours a clear copper with a beige head and some lacing. Aroma is medium sweet, earthy, dark fruits and light spices. Flavor is medium sweet cherry, earthy, nutty and some alcohol burning. Light to medium body. A very pleasant beer, can't call it Scotch Ale however."
"You know it's leaf-peeping time (Fall) here in VT when this one hits the shelves. Out of the bottle this one pours a clear, deep amber color with a thin beige head. Good retention and decent lacing. The nose was roasted malt, toffee and a smoky-ness like wood chips. The flavors were distinctly smoky, caramel malt, hazelnut hints. The malts are rich and deep and balanced at the end by some bitter hops that coat the tongue. Medium body and a good mouthfeel. The higher ALC% is also well hidden. I think this is a fine example of Scotch Heavy and very apropos to the season."
"Amber looks and little head to show. Some chocolate smell with initial tart to sweeten things up. Lacks carbonation to make for a more pleasant mouthfeel, it feels more like a dark fruit syrup with some sourness. A good beer overall with a interesting balance of fruit and roast."
"mouthfeel is roasty, lingering, a decent weight, lots of flavor - probably the best offering i've had from magic hat"
"D-One was enough."
"9/10/2004. Just sampled this on tap at our local pub. Pours a dark brown color, with a hint of red. Actually, let it be noted that my buddy ordered a Newcastle and this beer looked exactly like a Newcastle. Color, head, lace... all the same. The flavor is very malty, smokey, burned and sweet. There's a good amount of flavor here. Turns a little bitter in the finish. Pretty good beer for the fall, but nothing too exceptional."
"D: It hides its AVB very well. If you didn't see the bottle you wouldn't know this was just shy of 7%. It drinks very smooth and goes down easy. You could easily drink several during a poker game."
"A fairly good effort from Magic Hat, not the Strong Ale on the six pack that I hoped to enjoy, but a decent Scotch Ale. I'd prefer a broader malt base, but this is worth the effort."
"Drinkability: Medium drinkability. I could have two or three of these without hesitation but would not want more than that in one sitting as it is fairly filling."
"The taste is quite pleasing with a decent smokiness but nothing crazy. Light carbonation allows for a medium body to stay very drinkable and tasty. This isn't as big as 6.9% could be in flavor and body, but still a decent brew nonetheless. Not really the best representation of the style, but I don't think Magic Hat really likes conforming to standards anyways."
"d: an ok but slightly underwhelming beer that could use a flavor upgrade. however, for the abv it is quite smooth and i could imagine a lot of people getting pretty housed off of these."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This style doesn't show up much in VT but I feel that Jinx is a good introduction to it. It's not too filling or overwhelmingly smoky. I've enjoyed it from tap before but never had the bottled version. I like this beer, though I have friends that hate it. Oh well."
"D: pretty decent, a nice unique flavor."
"D - Not my favorite style but I really liked this take on it. I still couldn't have a bunch of these because the over powering presence of malts."
"Overall a tasty and full bodied scotch ale."
"Don't drink and review."
"Thanks to hurleymanvw for sharing this one with me at his home."
"D: This beer is quite easy to drink. It reminds me of some homebrews I've had the pleasure of drinking in the past."
"Taste rushes into a smokey caramel twist and finishes dry, low carbonation, could use a bit more hop profile, alcohol is also slightly noticeable which is surprising."
"this is my first offering from magic hat since 1996. the beer poured a brownish red with a small tan head. the smill is sweet and buttery and citrusy. the taste is consistant with the smell, but i also pick up pitted fruits perhaps. the taste is a bit peppery as well. the mouthfeel is medium and consistant with what i expect from this style. overall, this is a good beer that i could drink a few of."
"D: OK. Admittedly this is not my favorite style, but I didn't find this objectionable at all for what it is -- a solid version of a Scotch Ale."
"OK, smoke was well done in that it accented rather than overpowered. Not terribly impressive, though."
"Weakest wee heavy I have tasted, must be spoiled by Alesmith, first Magic Hat brew, pretty disappointed with this beer, cannot recommend it to anybody"
"Drinkability - nah, glad I only bought the single. Way too smoky and not near sweet enough. Edit - previous comments designed for a scotch ale. As a smoke beer, this is passable as an option for a cookout or something. I'd probably still spring for something else, but am bumping this a half point."
"Pours a nice clean brownish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, bitter, and some caramel. The taste is malty, some bitterness, and a good tone of caramel. This is a mild Wee Heavy at best. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew from Magic Hat, drinkable. Thanks Alan."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. High malt character fills you up a little bit, like a bock. Definitely an excellent beer."
"D- deliciouse very impressed, well balanced and a good change of pace. Highly recomended."
"Pours a hazy orange/brown, big thick off white head forms, leaves behind tons of lace, great retention, looks nice! Smell is caramel, some bread, light citrus, dark fruits, yeast, very earthy, kind of basic but enjoyable. Taste is similar, nice caramelization, bread, light yeast, earthy, touch of chocolate, some fruits, nice burnt sugary finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, pretty smooth, easy to drink. Not a bad beer!"
"On a side note, 'Jinx' has one of the more effeminate labels out there: a smiling/winking pink thing (a flower? an amoeba? what is it?). My wife actually calls the label ""the smiling vagina", as the face's contours do bear an abstract resemblance to a pair of panties... :)"
"Drinkability: OK stuff, though there are better Scotch Ales. Taste just seems to be missing something."
"d: easy"
"I pour, I look forward to their new concoctions year after year."
"This beer brewed November 2008, consumed tonight. I continue to be less impressed than my first bottle. This one smells like dirty socks, tastes like dirty socks with some nice bready malts hidden in there, dominated by what seems like a brandied-apricot. Far less impressive than my first experience of 2007."
"Overall- Good cold weather beer and a solid representation of the style."
"This beer is tasty, but I probably would not have more than a few in a sitting."
"I am not too impressed by this brew, even though I haven't tried too many beers in the ""scotch ale"" category. The amber is a reddish-brown, and there is a frothy head. The smell is definitely something you'll take notice to, but it just doesn't speak to me. It has a sweet malt, spicey, and smokey smell to it. The taste parallels the smell well, but adds an additional hop and spice profile. I can't quite put my figure on it, but there is this flavor that lingers in the background, and the best I can do to describe it is calling it this ""smokey"" earthy taste. Overall, just not my cup-of-tea. I'll pass on this brew, but I can respect what Magic Hat was going for, to some extent."
"Although the peat floavor was original, and did go nicely in the realm of scotch ales, I think the peat would have tasted better as a smooth (4.5-6.0%) porter or stout. It was difficult to handle as a scotch ale, usualy the mmalts used to make the scotch ale present morethen the sufficient challenge for the beer, smoking the malts was just too much.... Although this is a testament to magic hat's willingess to experiment and try new things, which as many brewery such as this do, envelop the ethos of American craft brewing."
"Drinkability is try it you might like it, but one is enough for me."
"O: The flavor really hurts the overal impression"
"Drinkability: A good tasty beer with a few flaws, but well worth a taste. (4.0)"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into frozen glass. Trying this because it is part of Fall Sampler.... Color is deep brownish ruby, very little head and no lacing. Smells of caramel, chocolate and toasted malt... Smells wonderful. Mouth feel is lighter than I thought it would be... A little bitter with a smokey flavor, notes of caramel and chocolate but not over powering, a very complex brew. A very drinkable brew... To bad it is a fall only seasonal beer.. I like this one very much."
"Pours a dark amber color with a small tan head that fades quickly. Aroma is malty with some notes of molasses and a hint of smoke. Taste is malty and fruity with some toasty notes mixing well with the smokiness. Hop flavors were there, but just barely noticeable. Not a bad example of a Scottish style ale and very drinkable. I could easily finish off 3 or 4 in a session."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for the style and season. Carbonation is light, but present. An easy drinker, but a far cry from a session ale. I would prefer one paired with a hearty meal. One of the better beers by Magic Hat, which is quickly turning into a lackluster brewery in my opinion. They do offer a few good beers and I'd say this is one of them, but I believe they're heading in the wrong direction."
"Poured amber with a decent head that stuck around for a while. The smell is beefy with touches of smoke and earthy hops. Surprisingly, not much maltiness is evident given the style. The taste starts a little malty, mostly dry, but this drops off and the beer becomes even dryer and a bit smokey. Nowhere near the level in a rauchbier, but it is there. Some more of that same earthy hoppiness that was in the nose is on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and mild and dry for the style. Quite drinkable, and not a badbeer from Magic Hat."
"another one from the guys at Magic Hat; pours a dark copper w/ a slight tan head which dissapated quickly some lacing; alcoholic nose w/ a faint caramel aroma; a light nutty/malty taste w/ a hint of hops, a ""macro"" malt liquor type flavor lingers on the palate for awhile; a med body, surprisingly light mouthfeel for a scotty ( i'm a big wee heavy fan) maybe some dextrins; not a bad drinking beer, def. don't drink like 6.9 ABV beer, i'm on my second in fact..."
"Great beer from a brewery that for some reason doesn't appeal to me very much...but I highly recommend this one and I look forward to trying more of their selection."
"There's a specific smoky character. Malty all the way through, a little spice, and some salty, gorgonzola buttery quality. Yeah, I said it. Gorgonzola. Very sweet, but medium bodied and not thick. Overall, pretty good, but not my favorite wee heavy."
"D: Great brew, especially now that things are really cooling off. Hopefully I can find this out of the variety pack, especially since I didn't like their #9 or circus boy."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Medium-heavy on the palate, with a medium-low level of carbonation that is a perfect pair with the body. Not to much and not to little it fits in very nicely, compliments the spices very nicely. This brew also finishes pretty dry, I'm thinking that this is due to the spices. This is definitely a brew I'd drink again, though I don't think that I'd personally label it as a Scotch Ale, I think that, in my own opinion, something more like oktoberfest spiced ale would be a more accurate description. I really don't think that Magic Hat was brewing a style here, I think that they were going more for a seasonal fall ale, which is prolly the best descriptor for this beer that there is. This is a great beer, and provided I can find more of it I think that I'll be buying more of it before season ends."
"This is a lightly carbonated ale with a medium mouth feel, just right for a cool crisp night with its near perfect balance of sweet and smoky."
"I didn't realize this was a Scotch Ale until I read the header on the web page; in short, this is a decent beer, but a very weak, watery scotch ale that doesn't have nearly the warming alcohol notes, not nearly the syrupy thickness, or the maltiness of an ale representative of the style. What you will get is a hazy brown beer with some head that doesn't hang around too long. The smell is molasses, coffee, chocolate, toasted malts. The taste is quite subdued and you don't get near enough of that smoky peat flavor characteristic of the style. This is a light to medium bodied beer, that needs to be chewier. The mouthfeel is watery, little aftertaste, and the drinkability is fine, just not if you are in the mood for a real Scotch Ale."
"An interesting beer, although a bit out of whack. The smoky character was nice, but other than that, it was kind of bland. It's still one of the better beers I've had from Magic Hat (not that that's saying much), and certainly worth a try at least once. I doubt I'll get it again, but I was glad to have tried it."
"The mouthfeel is average, as is the drinkability."
"Overall impression: Different, but still drinkable and interesting. Not a bad fall offering."
"Pours a very dark cloudy red color a has only a thin lace of head. Has a sweet roasted caramel malt aroma with a hint a smoke. The taste is slightly bitter, but goes down smooth. You can definitely taste the presence of the roasted caramel malts, but it does leave a slight taste of a cigarette in your mouth. I'm not a smoker, but it didn't really bother me. It leaves an interesting tingling sensation on the tongue and the carbonation is moderate. This beer can't get much better for the style. One of the best Scotch Ales I've ever had."
"This is a very complex tasting beer. It's a little fizzy feeling but not enough that it would turn you away from it."
"This is my favorite beer...I just wish they released it all year."
"This beer is best decribed as earthy. I don't know if it's the power of suggeestion from the label or not but, I'm a trail runner and this beer tastes like an autumn run through the hills. That's a good thing. This beer is a ruddy brownish red with kind of a soda like carbonation. Not particularly good looking. Smell is fruity apples, carmel and earth. Taste is complex and what holds this beer up. Peat, fruity apples and maybe a sour tang later on. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me. This won't be a regular, I like some other wee heavys better, but I will buy it again."
"Medium bodied,slightly cloying with a tangy grainyness. Easy drinking just not something i would want to drink a lot of."
"Poured out a very nice deep copper color, reminding me of a dark apple cider (real cider, not hard). The first smell was nearly overpowering, but all of the next nose tests were great. It has an deep earthy smell with a storng scent of apples in it. Fairly smooth in the mouth, just a bit rough. Great taste! It has a nice dark, earthy feel to this aspect, as well, including a wonderful, strong taste of peat. Don't confuse it with a scotch ale, but if you like scotch or scotch ale, you should like this just as much. (I feel it lacks the nice smokiness of a true scotch ale from scotland.)"
"On a side note I've found that its flavour makes it quite nice as a base when steaming clams, all it needs is a little butter, salt and pepper added, and its good to go."
"This was probably my favorite beer when i made the switch to the good stuff, pours a rich amber, with a small head and some nice lacing. The smell is sweet and nutty, with a hint of smoke thrown in their. Taste of some dark and sweet malts ending with some lingering smoke flavor and a hint of warming alcohol. The mouth feel is good even with the big malty character, and this one drinks easy for about 7%"
"D-This is one of the better brews from this brewery. There is enough subtleness to keep you interested. Would have again."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and creamy. To be honest this is a decent dark amber beer with a slightly extra kick. I didn't really get the Wee Heavy vibe from this one, so if you're looking based on style, this may not be what you had in mind. Still, it's a decent beer in it's own right."
"DA: 6.9% abv is felt and enjoyed."
"D- Not a session beer by any means, although I'm sure when I go camping over Columbus Day it will be treated as such. If you can get by the thick(er) malt flavor, this is an easy swiller."
"Advertised as a seasonal, but only if your season is eight or so months long -- I guess a mid summer through mid winter brew? Noticed some definitive maltiness, borrowing something from Oktoberfest / Marzens and Dopplebocks, but leaving a decernable estery / spicy quality found in Winter Warmers. All with a heavy dose of earthy, amber-malt, and mild peat-ey quality. You'd think that the textue would be heavy, but instead lands on medium firmness and much less sweet / cloying than anticipated. Easy to drink under about 7% of mild alcohols. Quite complex, flavorful, and rememberable."
"Highly drinkable. It's lighter than a lot of other wee heavys that I have had and tastes more like a Belgian than anything, but I didn't take any points off for not to style because it is a very good beer. Maybe someone will pick this box up and discover something new. Kudos to Magic Hat for bringing less prominent styles to grocery stores and gas stations everywhere."
"* Because of its bite, may be hard to repeat. It's a smoky, rich, dark roasted brew. Typical of most Magic Hat offerings; competent, just nothing mind-blowing."
"A very enjoyable beer as long as you don't think of it as a Wee Heavy. I like my Wee Heavies heavier and with more malt in the flavor profile and mouthfeel. Still warming and an interesting drink."
"Overall- This improves as it warms up and gets closer to the bottom of the glass. Another decent offering from Magic Hat."
"Pours a very dark red/mahogany with a decent head which recedes quickly leaving some nice lacing. Pleasant sweet malty aroma with a touch of smoke. Rich malty taste. Sweet caramel and toasted malt flavors. Nutty notes. A touch of smoke in the finish. Medium to full bodied. Wouldn't want to drink a ton of this but it does go down fairly easy. Good beer overall"
"D - A good beer to give you a warm up on a cool evening. I will definitely be getting more of this as the temperature goes down."
"Overall, I do enjoy Jinx. I'm not a huge fan of everything Magic Hat does, but this is a nice addition to the family. I'd choose a Belhaven Wee Heavy over this one in terms of style, but it's probably better than some things you'll find this fall."
"A dark coffee color with a solid tan head and good lacing. The aroma is very solid stuff with smokey, earthy malt and a touch of brown sugar. Porter-like I think. The taste is fortunately quite true to the aroma with the addition of a little apple on the edges. There is a sweet malt and maple sugar presence that blends nicely with the smokiness. A very smooth mix of flavor. Hearty autumnal goodness in a relatively drinkable brew. I like it and am happy to have a few left to this six pack. Recommended!"
"Final Note: This is a good, tasty beer for the fall, and I will be enjoying more of these as the weather cools and also as a break to the 'Oktoberfest' beers I will be consuming."
"interesting, but that's it for me."
"12oz bottle pours a dark, slightly reddish amber. Small creamy head. This beer smells great. Nose of fresh malts that are sweet(milk chocolate + molasses), nutty and slightly smokey. Flavor seems a cross between a scotch ale and a brown ale. Low hop bitterness with a sweet maltiness. It's very easy to drink while being very flavorful. Alcohol dryness shows more as beer warms. This is a great campfire beer when the nights turn chilly and luckily convenience stores in the White Mountains carry Jinx in six-packs. Try caramelizing some onions in it for a great baked bean topping(another campfire favorite)."
"Surprisingly big flavor burst, here. Tons of malt and spice (tricky to pinpoint the precise notes). Some apple cider-esque flavors as well as a noticable earthy peat body. Mouthfeel is crisp, with a good carbonation level despite the lack of such in the appearence. There's a nice bittersweet finish, too. Overall, Jinx isn't much to look at, but it's tasty and quite complex. I definately will enjoy the other 2 remaining in my Fall '07 twelve pack."
"I can't decide if I really like this or not, it is a weird beer. Good smoke taste and not too strong but what gives this the sensation of heat on the tongue? Really raw smoke extract or a few peppers thrown in the mix? I will have to revisit this beer sometime but for now I will give this just an average drinkability score."
"This beer poured a fruitwood color with reddish/orange highlights, crystal clear and well carbonated. An off-white tannish head sat on top, very thick and dense, a sticky creamy feel was to the touch and seemed to last for some time. She produced a sheet like lace that slowly broke apart as it slid down the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were soft in smell, detections of some fruit, and sweet malts came to nose. I did notice small waves of smoke but these were few and far between. Not an overly impressive aroma - soft. The tastes that came from the glass were not ""in your face - especially compared to other smoke beers"". Tastes of soft fruits (apples, apricots) were noticable, sweet malts, a tad lemony hop arose a few times and again a low lying smoke seemed to be present, ut severly understated, the swollow ended with more apples and malts. Not really an aftertaste, again I noticed some smoke that seemed to be there, but not as I would have liked. She started off realitively chewy and thick in the first sip, but seemed to thin alittle as I drank. A simple beer good to drink, but not sure if it should be classified as a ""smoke"" considering there was little smoke involved. I can honestly say I have not had a beer like this before."
"Clear, reddish brown with a solid cap of creamy foam. Fair retention with some lacing. Malty aroma, some brown sugar, nuts, and light smokiness. Light bitterness with a fair bit of malt sweetness. There's a bit of cocoa, along with some toffee. Smoke is very restrained. Smooth carbonation, medium bodied, dry finish. A decent drink, just a little non-descript in the malt department."
"M/D-moderate carbonation, medium bodied... definitively not bad, but not enough smoke."
"D - Not bad; you can taste the smokiness, although that sort of roasted flavor could be mistaken for something else (which I guess might defeat the purpose)"
"Overall: Excellent. Even if you don't like smoked beers give this one a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised. I know I was."
" I'm not the biggest fan of Magic Hat's offerings, as I think the brand and beers are a bit overrated (ya do have to love the names and bottle designs!). This one is no exception, even though I've never reviewed a beer of this style before. It's decent, suitable for fall or winter enjoyment, has just enough of an aroma, as not to overpower the senses. I still feel that somethings missing here, and think that this could benefit from a more peat or charcoal base, and some spicy notes. Certainly, worth a try to sample this style out..."
"I am surprised by the nice tan head that comes out of this beer. As it poured I thought that it looked a little flat, but the creamy head was nice. Huge smokey aromas hit you first, but as you taste it, it is balanced by some sweetness that is really complementary. It mellows nicely as it warms and does not become heavy- it's an easy beer to drink and one that is quite different."
"Pours a cloudy orangish brown under a one finger light tan head that fades fairly quickly to film, which then lasts forever, leaving some nice lace. The nose is light sweet caramel, much simpler than expected. The mouth is slightly sticky and fairly well carbonated. There's lots of sweet caramel malt taste, but not much else. No spice, no bitterness, and definitely no smoke. It's smooth and enjoyable, but very siple. Just a touch of dryness in the aftertaste hints at the presence of hops. Globetrotterette thought it was awful - ""genuine kvas"" - but I'll stick to simply disappointed."
"But hey! Thanks mucho to SkinnyElvis for the chance to partake of this."
"Very interesting beer. Not sure how many I would have, but I would definately recommend to anyone out there to try at least once. I think I would like to review this one again another time."
"Overall, a decent beer. Not one I'd rush out to get again, but I'd try it, especially if I could get it on tap to see if there was any difference in the character."
"I missed the initial release of this beer, which sort of sucked, but luckily there was a twelve pack left at Atlas up the street. It poured a dark brown coloration, with little heading at all. Smell had some sweet sugars, tree bark, caramel...all somewhat weak but nice overall. Taste was to be honest a bit on the sour side. I could taste some of the smokyness to this beer, but it didn't really add to it very much. Mouthfeel was also quite a bit lighter then I remember it being in recent years. One or two of these was more then enough for me. It's sort of unfortunate considering I really used to enjoy this beer. Maybe I got an old bottle or something. I'll probably give it another chance next year. Cheers"
"Another 12oz offerring out of the 12-pack my family brought to TX after touring the brewery. Pours a medium brown, big tan head that lasts. Slight smokey aroma, and malty, ummm. Malty, carmel-like flavors balance well with the peat smoked flavors. Just enough hops to keep it from being too sweet. Not too heavy. I could drink a lot of these!"
"A little thinner than I'd have liked, but still very drinkable. Odd in a good way."
"12 oz., best before J for January was notched. Mahogany in color, with some nice ruby highlights. Thick tan foamy head disappears rather quick. Smoky, citrusy and floral in the nose. Maybe a bit of chocolate, and nutty aroma as well. This beer has a nice roasty character, with a hint of smoke. Very bready, and ends with a hint of chocolate. Pretty good balance. Perhaps a bit thin in the mouth, but I liked this one. Thanks to mcallister for this one."
"D - Nothing too special here...I actually enjoyed Saranac's Rauchbier more than this offering (not trying to be sarcastic, just drank them in succession). I might venture another taste if I find this again."
"Overall a pretty complex beer. Best i've had yet from Magic hat, though i've only had 4."
"smoked malt taste, not very bitter. some vanilla notes. almost tastes like a porter to me. all in all pretty solid. damn tasty. magic hat will always have a place with me, living in burlington i gained a sense of local pride, but their beers often dissapoint. this one does not. awesome."
"D: Tasty, not filling, goes down easily, I could drink a lot of this beer, but it wouldn’t necessarily be my first choice."
"Deep hazy mohagany color with auburn on the sides. Moderate fizzy cream head emerges but settles to near nothing. Kind of a roasted woody flavor in the aroma. Some lighter caramelized fruits as well. A touch of vanilla too. Taste is sweeter upfront with a chocolate and almost doughy flavor. Roasted flavors and earthy tones come next but the sweetness holds up. Some of that vanilla from the aroma makes way. Darker fruits toward the back and some floral hoppy characteristics. The end is herbal and piney with a touch of roasted malt. Creamy mouthfeel makes all the flavors work in harmony. I did not know this was a smoked beer and thought it had a nice roast characteristic but not too smoky. A very drinkable smoked offering."
"Pours a very dark ruby color, clear, almost opaque. Some tannish creamy head and minimal lacing. Smells smoky, fruity, dark fruity, with a bit of a tea thing going on, maybe black tea. Taste is also fruity and smoky, lightly chocolatey, and bready. Mouthfeel is sudsy and creamy, quite nice feeling. This is quite drinkable, a bit on the heavy side, but nice. One of the most enjoyable Magic Hats I've had."
"Pours a hazy reddish brown. Small particles in suspension. Medium head of tan bubbles. Aroma is of burnt wood. Nutty. Taste is moderately smokey up front with a solid foundation of sweet malt in the background. Has a black tea flavor to it. Finishes smokey and somewhat dry. Interesting and different from what I normally drink. Not my favorite, but a good change of pace. Worth a try."
"Quite easy to drink especially considering the alcohol content. One of the better put together Magic Hat brews and a nice one to have for the fall/winter season."
"Cheers!"
"A toasty roasty little sipping beer here. This is the Magic Hat beer for people who don't typically like Magic Hat. Good stuff."
"Looks are poor, but she's got it where it counts. Taste and scent above average. I would love this with venison stew. A decent beer that comes in just above average. Nice beer for a crisp fall night."
"This is a pretty nice beer. The main flavors are of smoke and chocolate malt. They're followed by a bit of spice, ginger and grassy hops. Overall a nice session beer with little zing to it from the smoke. I wouldn't keep my fridge stocked with this, but I'd order a pint now and again."
"Another solid offering from Magic Hat."
"Cheer!"
"D: Very good, until I drank the third of three in the sampler... a good beer, and my favorite of the magic hat sampler"
"Good full mouth & flavor. Again a solid smoked toffee malt, with roasted caramel sidenotes. Burnt oven baked biscuits round things out on the medium finish."
"D: Good for more than one, but not recommended for quaffing."
"-Oelergud"
"D- Great with pizza or steak. Seasonal, so get it while it's here."
"The drinkability is good, nothing offensive, yet the beer does call you to taste more. Prost MK"
"This beer was quite complex, as it changed greatly from start to finish. However, it seemed to falter in many areas."
"At the start, the sweet and smoky flavors run over the tongue making way for a stong malt backbone. The mouthfeel is slightly thick, and sticks to the mouth, leaving behind a smoky hop taste."
"The mouthfeel gets a bit sticky afterwhile."
"This is a very tasty beer."
"Bottle poured into a pint glass, 1.31.07 freshness date on case."
"D - I could drink this all evening. Complex and a pleasant change from other seasonal offerings, without being overpowering. I can't reccomend this highly enough. Worth a try for anyone interested in beer enough to visit this website."
"Overall, I am very pleased with this MAgic Hat offering, much more than I had thought I would. I'd like to try some more of these ""smoked beers""."
"Drinkability: It's good, but I'd have to be in the right mood to session it, and I'd have to pay close attention to how I was pacing myself, due to alcohol content."
"Appears quite well with a deep reddish brown color and a solid over one inch head that dissipates slowly. Smokiness seems subtle to me as it is in the taste. Taste is quite nice, nothing overwhelming or complex. Very balnced and drinkable. The only beer of this style I've tried and must admit to being pleasantly surprised. I could definitely do with some more of this."
"M&D - rather smooth and deep in texture, more complex than i thought it would've been. i have not had much experience with smoked beers, but if the others are half as good as this, i shall love to try them all. Hats off to Magic Hat."
"Poured a decent two-finger head, which was noticeably thin from the start, and faded quickly. No lace to mention. Smoked orange aroma with some woody undertones. A very thin mouthfeel. Malty up front with hints of citrus and brown sugar. No real hop presence. Finishes with a slightly smokey residue in the back of the mouth. I'm not very impressed with the Jinx. I tried this years ago and seem to recall liking it more, but this time around it didn't do much for me. I'll try it again in a couple of years and re-evaluate. Otherwise, I'll just find something else to drink."
"Pours a deep amber brown. Thin tan head, not much retention, with a a bit of lacing. Smell is of smokey malt. Body is light with some carbonation. Taste is malt up front with a smokey finish. Hints of carmel are also there.Smooth,and light. Worth a try."
"On tap at Cole's,poured a nice rich deep amber with a thinner reddish tinted head atop,mild smoke aromas uderneat some brown sugar and lightly roast malt really quite appetizing.Again the smoke is subdued but is more of a companion to the sweeter malt profile maybe a little bitter chocolate in there but its light.A real quaffing smoked ale normally Iam not a huge fan of the style but I think comes together real well."
"Pours a deep, dark amber with a white head that quickly disapptes. Smells mildy of smoke and malts. Tastes of malts and peat smoke. It makes itself known as a smoked beer but is not overpowering. Mothfeel is smooth and creamy with a nice finish. Good drinkability for a smoked beer. I don't know that I could have more than 2 or 3 because of the smoky flavor but overall another good, solid offering from Magic Hat."
"It pours a nice deep brown with an amber tone and serves up a thin head of foam that quickly dissipates, though the carbonation does not (lots of tiny little bubbles in this pup). The nose is a bit difficult to catch, though when you do there are subtle notes, of sweet malt, chocolate, earth, and smoky moss. On first sip it tastes great. Big chocolate notes along with sweet malt and an almost ""scotchy"" taste. Unfortunately it finishes a bit weak ... almost watery. This was a bit odd to me as my first experience with this beer was a great one. Initially I had had it served on tap and the draft version seemed much meatier than the bottled version did. I remember the mouthfeel from the draft to be much fuller with an almost creamy finish to it. The bottle had the same taste up front, but as I said it just seemed watery at its finish. When this beer is served correctly it's heavenly ... I must say though that even when I pour it incorrectly/have a mediocre bottled batch this stuff is still pretty darn tasty."
"Acquired from the fall variety 12-pack... Brown translucent body with initially thick offwhite head that becomes about a quarter inch thick. Smells grainy and malty, with hints of yeast and alcohol. Tastes smokey, with some malt and some alcohol. Overall not bad though. Flavorful beer with a lot going on and warming feel. Good stuff."
"Sometimes Magic Hat produces good beers. This was part of the Night of the Living Dead 12 pack (Batch 375 was pretty good, also). The beer was a brown color with a medium head. It had a faint smoky aroma, as well as some sweet chocolate. It had a smoky taste, maybe some dark fruit, with a little hops bite at the end. I thought it was a trifle thin in the mouthfeel, but still a pretty good beer, particularly if all you associate Magic Hat with is #9."
"Pours a deep, dark brown, with a thin ephemeral head that leaves lace nonetheless. On the nose, slight smoke combines with butter and some chocolate notes. Minimal fruit. Tastes are smoke first and foremost, but it's slight smoke (not like a German rauchbier). That is followed up by sour fruits and a touch of diacetyl, then a vinyl-like finish. Mouthfeel is overly dextrine-smooth, with only minimal carbonation. Very good drinkability, with minimal and accessible smoke. This is really more of a scotch ale than a smoke beer. It's a decent example of the former, but does not measure up to the best of the genre."
"Maybe my favorite brew from Magic Hat. Great on a cold rainy night like this."
"Jinx pours a deep red, almost brown with a slightly off white head. I smell a bready maltiness with faint hints of ringwood yeast aromas, as well as a slight herbal spiciness. The taste is rich and malty. It's not quite sweet, with nice toasty flavor shining through, complementing the slight smokiness. Although slight, the smoke flavor appears nicely in the after taste. I drank this beer quite a bit when it was near out of date last year, and while the aged beers are still good, its even better fresh. The hop bitterness and flavor shine through just enough to really balance this beer. Seek this one out if you get Magic Hat in your area."
"D: This is my first smoked beer, so I'm not sure what a smoked beer is supposed to taste like. When I read ""bacon"" in one of the other reviews, I was a bit skeptical of this beer. It's not like this is a beer I could drink a ton of in one sitting, but I could definitely enjoy this with food. Actually, this would make a great marinade, too."
"The nose is of roasted malt with a hint of citrus hop."
"Pours a deep amber with a nice tan head that retains well. The aroma is intriguing with some chocolate and caramel upfront, along with some smoke, dark fruits and alcohol. The flavor is initially very rauchbier like with some smoked bacon and beef brisket notes, along with chocolate, caramel, earthy hops, dark fruits (fig, date, plum) and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is good. A nice beer with a solid smoked character, very well done and quite drinkable."
"All-in-all, not bad, but worth trying for its uniqueness more than anything else."
"Thick and creamy on the palate. I would like to try more, because I keep thinking about this unique brew."
"Okay, I realy like this beer. A friend was drinking this frequently--what looked to me like a gimmick beer--at the end of the ""season," and I had no interest until he let me try some. Okay, I need this. I got a 12er for cheap in december and stored is fairly cold and very light safe. I was almost through that 12 pack and on the verge of mourning in late January when I found another left over 12er at a mega store for cheap! With proper storage, I've been sipping one every couple of weeks, and am trying to make it till next september...Wish this one were year round. I'll stockpile it in the meantime."
"Cheers"
"Overall an enjoyable quaff."
"Tasted: 01/13/06"
"The mouth is a tad thin and there's not enough going on here to keep me interested."
"Possibly the definitive smoked beer. The best I've ever had, at least. Poured out to a dark amber brown color with a fluffy white head that maintained a huge level of density. Nice. Aroma is smokey and earthy, with some red wine qualities and dark fruit aromas. Tastes was right on; flavors of sweet and rich malts, smoked wood, unsweetened dark fruits and spices toward the finish. Amazing complexity. Mouthfeel was smooth and lighter than many other smoked beers, but still held on to a rich, creamy character that is missing from so many beers. Good drinkability. WIsh Magic Hat was available in MI. Special thanks to conneticutpoet for the sample."
"I enjoyed this ale very much. Would make for a good pub pint. I would gladly bend my elbow for this again."
"Pours a dark amber with almost no head and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is very mild with just a hint of smoke. The flavor is malty, but not very strong. There is some smoke flavor as well. The mouthfeel is much lighter than I'd like it, but the drinkability is ok."
"Poured a ruby brown with an off-white smallish head that left a bit of lace. Nose was a light hint of smoky malts and perhaps a hint of a sweet fruit. Taste was a hint of smoky malts with a sweep slightly hoppy finish. Mothfeel was good, decently carbonated and medium bodied. Overall drinkability was good as this brew grew on me because of the subtle complexities."
"Pours deep amber color with no head. I expected a touch of head. Nose is very light with smoke. I get some brown sugar, light smoke, not a whole lot more. Flavor is a little more smokey. A touch of smoked meat marinaded in brown sugar rub. Still a touch light in the flavor as well. Just a bit lacking. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Its a tasty, but really subtle in both. I like more agressiveness in a smoked beer."
"Poured from the bottle, the dark amber offering quickly settles with a light creamy head that soon dissipates. Initial flavor is slightly sweet with carmel accents and a slightly smoky overtone. Medium to light body makes this an easy beer to drink and could make for a nice session beer. The second was definitely better than the first. The upfront malt qualities does not stay around long and I found the finish to be less than desired. Still a decent beer by any means."
"12 oz. with drink before the end of Dec. notched on the label. Pours into the nonic a clear ruby brown with an off-white, 1 finger head that leaves some wisps of lace. Smoky/earthy in the nose with caramel malts appearing later, and at one point while swirling I swear I smelled blueberries. It has earthy and smoky malts, mild hops/hop bitterness and some sweetness toward the end with a body that is medium and smooth. Seems like a Scottish because of all the malts, and even though the maltiness does what they intended it to, I'd opt for something more hoppy."
"A nice deep amber with a linger off white head that yeilded a little lacing. It has a hint of smoke in the nose in fact if you aren't careful you might not even notice, especially in a smoky bar. A flavorful if almost bland amber ale with the ringwood yeast with small amounts of smoke seeping through. It is a little thin it could have used some more strength in the legs. The more I had in a row the better this beer was and it could be a session beer, but it is not something to seek out as it barely gets a shrug."
"I first had this beer in a growler from the brewery several years ago. At the time I preferred it to Blind Faith, (Magic Hat's IPA), that's not really true anymore, but still I recommend it."
"Drinkability was good... this went down smooth and easy. I could have a few more... it wouldn't be my first choice, but if it were offered at a party I'd probably preferentially go for this one."
"Just recently offered around here and nobody seems to know what kind it was, and the label is very true to form for Magic Hat and basically tells you jack about the beer. Pours a dark reddish copper with a small, light tan, silky, mostly diminishing head. The smell is moderately malty with aromas of caramel, lemongrass and smoke. The taste is very smoky with earthy toasted malts and some peat. It has a medium body, dry texture and moderate carbonation. Im not a very big fan of smoke beers, but this one was done very well. Too often I find the smoke in beers of this style to be too bug and distracting, but this one doesnt go overboard."
"Pours a dark orange/light brown color with a very light, whispy white head. Aroma of dried apricots, peat smoke, and something oddly - though not unpleasantly - like sweaty feet. Palate is quite interesting - rather fruity, with notes of apricots and light hops, blended with a bit of peaty smoked malt. The alcohol is rather prevalent on the finish. Body is a bit lighter than I would hope for to hold up the assertive flavor. Still, it's the first beer in the ""smoked ale"" category that I've been able to even drink more than one sip of, so that's got to count for something."
"This is not my favorite beer by any means but it is original and has a nice individual character. A good try by Magic Hat but I won't go out of my way for this one again."
"This is my favorite MH beer. It brings to mind memories of fallen leaves crunching underfoot and wood smoke lingering in the air."
"First of all their labels are genius. this is some weird joker dude made out of hearts, but it sorta looks like a 6 balled ballsack. Anways this 12oz bottle pours a unique golden-orange red color with a nice head that doesn't stay. The aroma consists of sweet malts and smoke/roastiness. Nice, not as strong as the taste by far. Mmmm the smokiness hits you at different times throughout the taste. This is so creamy! Fairly smooth. Very drinkable."
"While Magic Hat's ubiquitous #9 is a fairly mediocre brew, the company is clearly capable of churning out exciting offerings. Jinx joins Ravel and Thumbsucker as examples of ambitious, well-executed, very drinkable beers. A great fall offering, the beer combines many of the characteristics of Oktoberfest lagers with the flavor profile of an ale. Highly recommended."
"Clear, dark brown body with amber hues, topped with a 1-finger slightly off-white head, fluffy, with low retention. Little to no lacing, spotty in some areas. Sweet malt nose, maple and fudge, hints of smoke. Good carbonation up front, nice feel -- medium and full but not slick -- tongue awash with caramel sweetness, a hint of apple, some breadiness and a bit of nuttiness, fully emerging on the way down with just a tiny dab of smoke. Extremely sweet, with complex flavors just bubbling under, and smoke unfortunately not forceful enough, makes it interesting but doesn't overly impress."
"This is a fantastically unique beer combining the crispness of a pale ale and the huge heft of a stout or porter or even doppelbock, but in flavor only. Ive liked Number 9"" and thought that that was innovative as well; however, this is a pleasant surprise nonetheless from Magic Hat."
"Nice to drink, can enjoy a few of these among some other Octoberfest favorites. A nice variety to the style."
"A nice frothy thick off-white head forms on top of a deep dark brown colored beer. Light seeps in gently at the edges. The smell is very malty supporting a touch of sweetness. There is a note of smoke in the background, but I wish it was stronger. The taste is very malty, as are most fall seasonals. There is a sweetness in the background that dances around just a hint of smokiness. I think maybe if the sweetness died down a bit, the smoke would be more apparent. At the end, the dreaded diacetyl makes a presence. It isn't really off-putting, but I wonder if this is the sweetness I tasted in the beginning. After the swallow, it leaves a sticky residue in my mouth. I remember liking this beer much more than I do now. It's still a nice beer, but it's lacking some sort of individuality. A stronger smokiness would go a long way towards making it a great beer."
"Pours a clear brown with a bone white head that turns into a thin film very quickly. Smell of caramel and nuts. Taste is sweet malty caramel with just the slightest smokeyness. The smokeyness does become more pronounced as you drink but wasn't as prominent as I would have liked. Some bitterness to the finish. Moderate carbonation level on the tongue. I would recomend this for a try, especially in the variety pack from Magic Hat. Won't make my list of regulars but I would buy the variety pack again for the change of pace."
"Poured out a small head, but that could of been the pour. Tiny amounts of lacing.The color is a light brown and is clear with some bubbling carbonation. I bought this at Tully's while in Maine on vacation. Has a strong aroma and taste.Not much of a head but well carbonated.Mouthfeel could be a bit thicker as it is a little watery for my liking. Leaves a lingering bitterness. Nicely malted with a slight smoke aroma and taste.Tastes of molasses with a hint of raisins.More lacing with every sip so the appearance goes up a bit. This beer is very hard to find in my area and I was lucky to find it in Maine. Overall not a bad beer."
"12 ounce bottle.Best before end D on label."
"This would be a good one to introduce people to smoked beers. It's sweet, the smokiness is just there, and it's very well balanced. And at 6.9%, it'll get the job done, if that's what you're seeking! Recommended."
"A dark amber color with a nice two finger head.However,the carbonation goes away too fast.A nice spicey smokey aroma.This is a nice Octoberfest like smokey beer thats not too heavy and not too light.This has a very nice flavor.I can see having a few of these.A nice offering from Magic Hat."
"This is my first smoked brew and a good one at that."
"Quite enjoyable."
"Overall = Interesting beer. I do think the flavor is good and recommend you try it. Drinkability isn't bad but I don't think I'd want more than a couple of these as the 6.8% is noticable. Still a quality brew from Magic Hat, which has impressed me greatly with the last several beers I've sampled."
"Got this bottle from the fall sampler pack. Pours a nice amber garnet color with a thin white head. Moderate lacing. Smell is rather light, just slightly smokey, more of a malty prune and fig scent. Taste is a sweet toffeish malt with nice woody flavors and just a hint of smoke--much more subtle than any other smoked beer I've had. There is a slight hop finish and as the beer warms some of the dark fruits start to come in on the taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very creamy. I've been starting to get into smoked beers recently, but usually I can't handle more than one at a time. This is probably the first sessionable one I've had--I really like."
"Quite smooth and drinkable."
"This is now certainly one of my favorite fall beers. Certainly at least worth a shot, even if you may be hesitant (and I was because smoked beers, as I said, aren't usually my favorite)."
"A solid brew - interesting and enjoyable. Actually exceeded my expetations...thankfully the smokiness is not overdone. A nice addition to the Fall Magic Hat mixed 12."
"for what it is, and who is buying it, this is a great beer. in the world of smoked beers, this is average. however, MH deserves big testicle points for throwing this into a mix pack (NotLD) that overall tries to educate the beer drinker instead of simply intoxicating him/her. would like ot try this on tap some day."
"A good sized, creamy, tan colored head fades slowly to a ring around the edge of the pint glass. Dark, glowing, chestnut colored beer shows barely a sign of carbonation. Gentle aroma of roasted malt, sharp caramel notes, and Mildly sweet caramel malt and cocoa up front in the flavor. A hint of tea joins in just before the faint smoked peat flavor takes it all into the finish. Mouthfeel is soft, and just a hair undercarbonated. I""m on the fence with this one. The smoked malts add a nice dimension to the beer, and the almost 7% abv is undetectable."
"Drinkability is good. Hides the 6.9% very well. If you're a bourbon fan, and a beer lover, I suggest checking this one out. It's a nice mix that wages an unusual battle on the palate."
"One of my favorite Magic Hat brews."
"Very drinkable if you care for that smoked flavor. Certainly not a beer for all tastes, but one I enjoyed greatly, and one I could easily have many of."
"This is a very drinkable fall seasonal."
"poured a reddish-copper color with average tannish head. smell is toasty, malty, dark fruity, smokey, and very enjoyable. Taste is complex, being a mixture of toasted malt, prunes, figs, and smokiness. Great finish and very smoothnin the mouth. This is one of the best beers I've ever had."
"A fairly interesting beer: it tastes like a robust Scottish-Style ale (maybe even a wee-heavy) that is unusually smokey. The peat flavor imparts that nice appley-smokiness found in scotch whiskey. A unique beer and a decent one too, but not one that I imagine buying again anytime soon (the beer has a buttery sweetness that makes hard to want more than one or two at a time, IMHO). Still, its worth a try. Recommended."
"Big head of bubbles on top of a brassy pour. Smell is roasty malt with some smoke notes that aren't too overwhelming. Taste is roasty, the smoke flavors are in there on the malt. There's also a pretty strong fruit flavor and a syrupy sweetness. Some herbal notes, too. The flavor comes together in a pretty interesting way; it's all just kind of thrown in there together but comes out nice. It's sort of hard to drink due to this quality, but it's definitely a neat beer that's worth trying."
"Medium-full bodied"
"[Jinx: (noun) A person or thing that is believed to bring bad luck]. This is a beer that is wholly in keeping with Magic Hat's stated mission to brew interesting, off-beat beer and to do it with style. I find myself with mixed feelings regarding their beer more often than not and Jinx is a mixed bag of an effort in my mind. It doesn't have enough positive attributes to be more than a curiosity to me, but I do appreciate the opportunity to have given it a go. Thanks far333."
"Overall an enjoyable brew, especially in the colder months. Recommended."
"This is a drinkable beer that I will have to try again in warmer weather."
"Medium bodied brew. Smooth at the start and finish. The smokiness is pleasant and lasts briefly on the tongue after swallowing. For a smoked beer, this was a very enjoyable version and nicely drinkable."
"This is a decent fall weather beer, but not one that'll have you running back for too many more than one."
"Very well done."
"A pretty hefty beer at 6.9% abv for the style. A very interesting and flavorful effort by Magic Hat. This is one that I'll go back to in the future."
"The beer pours out a perfect brown color with a good amount of head. Nice aroma and taste with a lot of complexity. Lots of flavors and aromas going on here, but they were hard for me to pick out. The taste is definitely smoky, but it almost reminds me of a wheat beer in a way as well. Maybe it's the dry aftertaste it leaves in your mouth. Despite that, I found it to be very drinkable and it held up nicely as a session beer for me that night. This beer leaves you wondering exactly what it was you just drank."
"Oh my god. Don't drink a smoked beer without first knowing it's a smoked beer. It almost made me throw up. Pours very dark brown with a hint of amber. A finger of head that was moderately retained. Smell had some hops, malt, and fruit with smokiness around the edges. So, I take a sip. OY! Has a little chewy fruitiness, dominated by smokiness, balance of hops and malt is good but I can't get past this supreme smokiness. If that's what you're looking for, then great. For me, I couldn't get past 1/4 the bottle. Mouthfeel is quality, of course, it's Magic Hat. Tried hard to not rate it from my likes, but it cost the beer points."
"Very strange beer, after being disappointed with my first Magic Hat offering, my interest is rekindled, as is my interest in another bottle."
"Body is just barely medium with a smooth texture and cfreamy mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. One of the better Magic Hats."
"Thin sheet of almost-creamy head to start. Clear, deep mahogany hue that was, frankly, enchanting. Focused malt crank at nose, with a bit of a sweet, raspberry note that raised a nodding eyebrow. Holy burnt ochre on tongue that, without knowing what style this was before ordering it, was an excellent surprise; also, a slight hop bunch seemed to loop around as well. Pleasantly drinkable, and perhaps more so for me as I generally do not go for MH offerings."
"Drinkability: I got a six of this by trade, and while I won't let it go to waste, this will not be my beer of choice from the fridge. A rather average beer. Won't look for this again."
"Clark's Ale House in Syracuse on tap. a scotch style with significant peat. Full of flavour without the smokiness of a true smoked beer. More like a smooth single malt scotch flavour. Had again a year later on tap at the brewery and wasn't as good."
"i sampled this one years ago whilst living in boston and despised it. clearly the worst brew in the mh family, i though at the time, and have avoided it since...until now. it's certainly better than i remember it but still nothing to write home about. i guess maybe i just don't get this one. it pours a very nice ruby colour with a farily thin head that leaves virtually no residue on the glass. the smell is odd: somewhat smokey, some what rubbery, somewhat malty, but totally average. the flavour is equally perplexing as, while it does have smoke notes to it that are pronounced at times (especially at the start of the brew), there are too many other weird flavours thrown into the mix to call it a true smoked brew, i think. like with the smell, there is a rubber flavour at times which is quite out of place. i picked up some cooked vegetable flavouring as well. odd, but it works for the most part, i guess. this one is quite simply hard to pinpoint. its too scattered for me to say that i enjoyed it but there's nothing glaringl wrong with it. try it for a change of pace but i can't imagine myself sampling more than one per season, at best."
"12 oz. bottle best before 12/2004. Pours a clear cola brown color with a beige short-lived head. Some graininess and scorched caramel in the nose, pretty subdued. Is this a smoked beer? Tastes more like a brown ale with some browned apple fruitiness. Smokiness is very minimal, but plays pretty nicely with the rest of the beer. Earthy and woody, with some tea-like tannins that balance out the malt. Rather unique brew; pretty drinkable. I'm a little surprised the ABV is 6.9%, it's well hidden. Overall, it's a pretty nice beer, smoked in the medieval sense that all beer used to be boiled via a wood stoked fire."
"Hardly any smoke in the nose, which came as a surprise. Nose is weak."
"Beer is good. Happy almost smoky beering."
"The beer pours a nice ruby red color with a 1/4"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted barley. It has a dry, yet fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good. It has a roasted malt flavor with a refreshingly fruity yeast finish. It seems to have some peated malts as well. It goes down easy and finishes a bit bitter and toasted. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good seasonal. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"This is a well balanced nicely flavored beer. There's a background taste during each sip that reminds me of lemon tea. It's a spice that I'm having a hard time identifying. I've got to get me some more of this!"
"This brew goes down smooth and would make a good session beer in my mind."
"On tap at the Blind Tiger in NYC. My first time trying this seasonal offering from Magic Hat. Dark brown orange color body with a nice looking white lacy head. Smokey, light malt aroma. Taste was exceptional. Smokey whisky flavor pairs with the light hop finish well. I was impressed with this brew considering im not one of Magic Hat's biggest fans."
"On tap at the BTAH in NYC. Pours a nice rich almond. off white head. nose of malt, smoke, nuts. Deeply malty and flavorful. Rich mouthfeel, medium bodied. This was sold as an octoberfest brew on steroids, so there seems to be some style bending going on here. Smoke notes fairly subtle. Malt caried the freight here, tasty seasional creation from MH"
"I'm always happy to see this beer hit the shelves in early Fall."
"Jinx was served from a 12 oz. bottle with a cute label. In a pint glass, the beer was a rich clear mahogany color, and was adorned with an off-white head that left sticky sheet lacing. The nose was quite enticing with roasty, peat smokey developed malts and a zippy citirc hoppiness. The taste offered delicous smokey/roasty oaky-woody malts that pleased the tastebuds right through to the lightly astringent, zippy citric finish that left residual citrus-smoked roasty malty flavors. The body was appropriately full and the peppy carbonation worked well in such a malty beer. Jinx is a very tasty and well-crafted beer that Id love to have available in my local."
"This brew pours a deep copper color with mahogany and ruby hues.. A light fluffy white head appears about an 1/8 inch high and quickly recedes leaving no lace whatsoever. Aromas are initially malty and smokey with an almost molasses like characteristic. For flavor this brew is initially very malty, with a slight carob flavor. Following a chimney like smokey flavor is quite present and adds a nice flavor to the brew, followed by an almost nutty characteristic which added to an even more complex flavor profile. There is also a bit of sweetness and creaminess to the brew which adds quite a nice mouthfeel. Finally the brew finishes just slightly hoppy, but not bitter. Overall this brew is incredibly complex, with a splendid smoke flavor that isn't like barbeque but more like a burning pile of wood. Truly a great beer."
"Get some. I hope you agree."
"This beer poured a clear, deep chestnut color with off-white foam that settled and left a thin coat on the surface. The smell was floral and fruity hops with some slightly sweet malt and a hint of dried fruit. A pleasant aroma, but no smokiness. The taste was dominated by fruity, floral hops up front, and then caramel maltiness, and then some low hop bitterness in the finish. A bit of alcohol and phenols could be tasted. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and a bit warming. The body was medium with low carbonation feel. This was an enjoyable beer, but the smoke was not really detectable."
"Knowing that this was a smoked beer, I was thinking it was going to be a little darker than it is. But nevertheless, it's a good beer from Magic Hat. Poured out a copper color with some decent enough carbonation. Decent amount of caramel aroma in there. Some fruit pokes in there as well with a light smoke aroma. Very nice. Good fruity tastes in here as well as some caramel undertones. As the beer warms up, a long lasting rye bread aftertaste kicks in. It's like eating a whole loaf of rye bread. Also, that smokiness mixes in with it. Very complex beer, but in a good way. Quite interesting. Give it a try, it's worth it."
"This beer defines the color amber. Thick, delicious yellowy head billows from the top. Smell is crisp and clean. Taste is great. Burnt flavors, spice flavors, malt flavors combine, yet the aftertaste is just hoppy and burnt. Thick and yummy, this beer is an unexpected treat. Never had a smoked beer before until Magic Hat came along and showed me whats up. Thanks M.H.!"
"Quite a nice little smoked beer. This probably would be an introduction to a smoky beer. Gotta love Magic Hat and I may well have this one again."
"Hazy copper tinted dark amber beer topped by a minimal amount of off white head. Peat and some type of disinctive hop aroma. Slightly earthy, seems much like some brown ales I've had aroma-wise. Northern Brewer? Perle? I don't know. (At this point, worries about similartes to Bell's Amber and/or Cottonwood Low Down brown are surfacing.) Ahh, true to form. Taste is dominated by a woody, earthy bitterness that reminds me of eating dirt. A bit of smoky peat and malt sweetness saves it a bit. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh and grainy. Drinkability is OK. I just can't get past the dominant earthiness. Every once in a while, I find a beer with this flavor profile. The previous two similarities were mentioned above. Time to start investigating this beer in relation to the otehr two to make sure I don't make something like this. It's a solid beer; I just don't care for it. Some people like blondes, others brunettes. Well, I like the latter, and this is more like a redhead. Or maybe a punk chick with pink hair. Just not my type..."
"Much nicer from the cask. The subtle flavors seem to have matured somewhat, and come through much better, with a better profile to the hops. The malt works much better with the low carbonation. I'm a fan."
"This is a dark red/brown brew with a small head of tan foam. The aromas are interesting and consist of a weird fruitiness (figs) as well as some dark roasted malts, and just a hint of hops and smoke. The taste picks up where the aroma left off. A bit of a smoky taste, combined with weird tasting whisky or rye (?) malts. Their are some hops in the finish as well as a long and smoky after-taste. The mouthfeel is creamy, and smooth which makes this beer an easy drinker. Kind of like a malty, smoked, octoberfest brew, and one of the best fall seasonals to pass my lips this year!"
"The taste is rather pleasant and highly malty. Lots of dark fig, cherry, and plum, with a slight astringency. Doesn't taste as smoky as the smell would lead you to believe. Not a bad brew. Kind of like a soft porter that took a weird detour and mated with a scotch ale."
"All around...a very good beer...nice dark caramel color with a decent lace after the head disappears. Smell is malty with some alcohol presence. Taste was sweet with a dryness on the finish with some hop presence...nice touch. Mouthfeel was substantial with a bit of a syrupy consistency...a good touch for a winter brew. For the 6.9 abv, very drinkable. I couldn't drink a lot of these but a few on a winter's evening sounds just right."
"Tastes like a wee heavy to me...or maybe a wee medium as the body is not quite thick enough to score in the wee heavy range...anyhow....very good beer....very enjoyable...I would drink this again..."
"Cheers to the 36LbLoveChild for the bottle!"
"Hmm, what a shocker to sit down to review this one and find it it's supposed to be a smoke beer...I think they forgot to put some in the keg that was on at Redbones (or maybe I didn't notice it because I was at Redbones, all that smoked meat and everything). Anyway... The pour was a medium dark copper color. This is what I think is so funny, my notes say: clean aroma! Uhh, I tasted a malty base (no smoke detected, alas), with a flowery hop aroma. Some slight astringency in the finish. I remember I was out with a few fellow BAs, and we were all like: what is it. I can't believe this was a smoked beer. I found this an average beer, not bad, not outstanding. pat"
"The Jinx was on cask last night at Eli Cannon's for the Magic Hat tasting, a nice variation. Poured into the pint glass, it appears at first to be nitrogenated because it has a beatiful cascade effect and a nice thick and creamy off white head. Color is a smoky quartz and garnet, good clarity. Aroma is a little malty and sweet, a little buttery, with just a little bit of chutney. Medium to light bodied and incredibly smooth on cask. Taste is a mix of lightly smoked malt and a raisiny sweetness, with a little hop tang coming in the end to blend with finishing notes of alcohol. The pronounced yeast flavor of some MH beers is not evidenced in this cask beauty. Pour me another..."
"Pours a deep amber brown hue topped by a nice sized cream colored head lacing is present in thin sporadically patterned rings. Smells of deep roasted malts with a nut characteristic and smokey peated malts nice and robust even a presence of hops here slightly piney nose. Flavor mildly smoked deep woody, malts a slightly chocolate flavored with an herbal quality about it tasty and quite different. Medium bodied smooth light carbonation here, simple. Drinkability is quite effortless I could drink a few before the smoked effect would ware down my palate."
"Nice deep burgandy color. Slight off white head. Lacing is sporadic, but nice. Aroma has a nice faint sweetness to it. Seems like bubblegum esters and hard candy. The taste follows suit with more of the same sweet character. But unlike the nose, there is a dose of smoke flavor added to the flavor. Ever so delicate, it makes it's presence knows and integrates into the flavor profile nicely. There's a bit of a dryness on the finish that has me going back for more. Nice beer here."
"Again, I have had teh pleasure of enjoying a new MH brew. Pours a deep smoky chocolate color with a thin lace on the glass. An mellow aroma wafts a moderate peet smokiness with a caramel background. A smooth body supports a mellow caramel and chocolate malt with a building, eclipsing smoke that brows right through the finish. All the flavors meld well to present a great, not overly smoky concoction."
"Big thanks to Xgrigorix for the sample!"
"This beer poured out with a deep amber/brown color and was topped off with a thin white head. This is weak for a smoked beer, but holds its own. In the nose theres roasted chestnuts, fermented fruit and alcohol. The flavor holds some orange liqueur and sweet caramel. Finishes clean and dry and is light to medium bodied. A flavorful ale but not in the same category as some other German Rauchbiers that I have tried. Not bad."
"Highly drinkable: I would never have expected to like this beer this much...glad I tried it... think I'll pick up a sixer!"
"Pours a deep reddish-brown, small tan head that quickly becomes just a ring, leaves small amounts of lacing. Aroma is butter cookies & earth. Flavor is a little sweet, little buttery, a little chocolate, and a but of hops in the finish. Medium-thin bodied, very toungue-tingling carbonation. If there was smoke there, it was VERY much in the background."
"I've called Magic Hat a ""fruity"" brewery in the past, but this one is quite an achievement."
"An excellent autumn beer to enjoy the end of baseball season, & the start of hockey season."
"According to the brewery's website, this beer uses a peat-smoked whisky malt. The smoke was so delicate that I really didn't perceive it as such, rather, it registered as a malty, slightly chocolately essence woven among the malt. This beer is sort of a classification buster - at first it struck me as a Vienna, then the malt kicked in, sort of Oktoberfest. The malt softened and seemed more Scottish and finally, when the beer was fairly warm, it had hints of English brown ale. A beer chameleon. Also according to the website, abv of 7%, which I never would have believed. A very mellow beer, on purpose, and quite well made."
"Deep dark red in color with an off white to light tan head, nice lacing. I'm quaffing cherries, pepper, and leafy hops. Taste is of bitter cherries and an earthy fall leaves complexity in the hops. Unrecognizable spices are also in here, pepper etc. and there is cherry candy sweetness present as well. I'm not detecting much smoke here though at all [?] I'll have to try another... My favorite Magic Hat offering thus far, and a good beer to celebrate the beginning of Fall!"
"Pours a brown color with a tan head that had medium retention. The aroma was kind of woodsy, oak maybe, also with dark fruits and a bit of hop bitterness. The taste had no indication of the high ABV. It was slightly smokey, not much though, along with a balanced hop crispness that gave a relatively dry finish. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth with medium carbonation. This is a great beer to get settled into the Fall season with."
"Complex ale. Very good for those cool fall nights, warms you a bit."
"brown with a s light reddish tinge. thin, not quite white head. a smokey smell dominates here. faint hops. on closer inspection, some nuttiness and maybe sort of sweet spice. pleasant smoke and malt up front, then some well balanced hops, mellowing into some chocolate malt flavors with that spicey (like cooking spices) flavor vaguely apparent once again. hops and smokey aftertaste. mouthfeel is medium if not a little watery for the style. overall a good fall seasonal. this almost got much lesser scores, but this beer really got better once it sat out a little. let sit 5 min or so before drinkning. it enhances the smell and taste greatly."
"Poured with a superfine off white collar...akin to whipped cream almost! The head settled over clear red/amber & brown hightlighted liquid. The interesting nose gave hints of caramel, roasted maltiness and very slight but noticeable smokiness. The taste started sweet and smooth with a complex blend of delicate smoke, malt and background hop bitterness with lingering peppery spiciness and small amounts of phenols. Finishes long, silky-smooth and superbly balanced with no hint of the 7 percent alcohol noticed. A very distinctive ale, recommended if found."
"On tap at the brewery. 1st bottling run of the '03 Jinx. It's been way too long since the '02 Jinx was around. Pours a dark brown with a small creamy head. Big malt flavor with a spicy smoked touch. Very well balanced and complex. Very smooth. This is my favorite of Magic Hat's regular seasonal brews. I wish it were available all the time. I can't wait until the bottles start showing up in the stores in a few weeks!"
"Finish is medium long with a sour note. Very pleasant. Unique."
"Jinx, yeah….hugh…I don't know. This beer hold true to its name, it is truly confusing. I can't identify its style other beyond the broad Ale category. Nor does Magic Hat describe it as belonging to a particular genera. It has a dark caramel color and a small white head. Smells a bit sweet, the taste is smoky like a stout but gives way to dryness similar to a an English bitter. Kinda strange also good. Uniqueness is always cool."
"Another excellent ale from Magic Hat. Slightly smokey due to the peat smoked malt. There's also some wheat malt and chocolate in the recipe which all make for a unique flavor. It's not out for long, so buy it when you can. My wife figured out the logo. I thought it was a funky falling leaf, but she informed me that if you look close, it's actually three overlapping hearts around the smiling face."
"Hazy-amber in color with a tan head that leaves some wipsy lacing. Floral hop aroma with some herbal hints and sweetness and hints of smoke in the backround. Medium to full in body with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Sweet malt flavors with a butter cookie characteristic. Hops balance with some bitterness and herbal notes. Smoke lies in the backround and does not overtake the brew, but adds nice complexity. Highly drinkable and almost begs to be finished, but you want this to last."
"Drinkability & Notes: This is one of those sip and savour brews as the complex flavours do not deter the palate from being overwhelmed yet the after taste is never-ending. Pot roast with sweet potatoes and roasted root veggies is a perfect match for this brew."
"Great amber color with white head that clings to the glass. An aroma that is very inviting and the taste that leaves you asking for more."
"Reddish copper color with a fluffy white head. I thought the brew had a very hoppy smell, and the initial taste was of strong hops, followed by a mild smoky spiciness. Quite an interesting ale. Another delicious Magic Hat beer."
"A good-looking, malty beer. Tastes mildly spiced and smoky, almost like a beef sate from a good Chinese restaurant. An interesting, complex beer, though not necessarily one that I'll drink a lot of."
"tried this one on tap in their brewery in Vt. Loved it so much i left with a half gallon jug of it filled straight from the tap at the bar."
"Notes: One of the most interesting ales brewed in New England if not in the US."
