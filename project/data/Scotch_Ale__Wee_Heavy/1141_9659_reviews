"O: best drunk at cellar temp, or warmer... yes, it has the requisite foundation of a North American take on the style, however, it comes across extremely dull, whether due to it being old or from a hitch in the bottle-conditioning... I'd be curious to try this again on draft, but I'm not going out of my way to find a bottle"

"Perhaps the most disappointing DDC I've had. Nice reddish dark brown body with decent thick foam which disappears rather quickly.  Smell is thin, lacks wee heavy character and maple aromas (gets slightly better as it warms). Taste: at first, balanced roasted caramel with nice residual sugar then, it gets dubious: maple taste emerges as off-tasting, almost wrong/artificial."
""

"Has a really off nose, almost like a plastic smell.  Maple doesnt come through.  One of the first misses I have had from DDC"
""
""
"O- Eh, not one of DDC's best beers. The concept is solid, but the amount of sweetness really ruins it for me."

"Very dark brown color with small tan head. Rich aroma of dark bread, molasses and maple. Medium bodied, but lighter flavor than the aroma suggests.  Smooth up front with the same flavors as the aroma mixing into a sweet, smokey taste, with hop bitterness and alcohol combining for a little bite on the back end.  The maple's prominent, but not at all overpowering; a nice addition."

"Would definitely buy this one again."

"It's definitely not a session beer, and you'd have to be the type to like brews that hit the tastebuds hard for this one."

"Pours a hazy, dark brown color.  1/3 inch head of an off-tan color.  Good retention and slight lacing.  Smells of chocolate, roasted malt, sweet malt, slight cherry, hint of syrup, and alcohol.  Fits the style of a Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy.  Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, cherry, slight syrup, and a hint of chocolate.  Overall, decent aroma and feel, but too much cherry and syrup in the body."

"Picking up a bunch of the maple syrup. A solid sweetness. Light on the Scotch ale flavor though."
""

"Overall, a really nice scotch ale and the male syrup fits like a glove.  Not quite better half but very well could be if aged on bourbon."
"Serving type: bottle."

"Beautiful copper color with 1-2 fingers of a light tan head with decent retention and some lacing.  Nice nose, caramel, toffee, brown sugar.  It is very similar on the palate, toasted grain, toffee, caramel with some subtle bitterness in the finish.  Nice and round with enough carbonation to keep it drinkable."

"Being a fan of a wee heavy this one took me by surprise. A very nice variation on a wee heavy. The addition of maple really works and the hint of sweet it creates in the finish sets the beer apart. I would definitely like to have a few of these on hand."
"Pours a turbid red tinted brown with zero head, and a few small dots on the glass. Smell: sweet, backed apple, maple syrup (I'm primed by the description; not terribly strong), mild earthiness. Taste: soft cooked red apple, tons of caramel, date bread, mild earthiness, syrup sugariness towards the finish. Medium bodied, mild carbonation with a diluted syrupy feel. Sticky finish. Sweet. Enjoyable, but that's about all."
""
""
"Overall an interesting beer, I do not really pick up any of the maple flavor. A little to bitter in the finish, either from roast or hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoy a wee heavy. I find them nice sippers and pleasant cold weather beers. I was surprised by this beer and how light it felt compared to others of the style. A nice change. I also like the use of maple in this beer."

"O: A really solid Scotch ale. I was a bit surprised that the maple syrup merged so well with the sweet, nutty malt flavors the brewers presented so well. I also appreciate the fact that the hops were noticeable, but not overpowering. Unfortunately, many North American brewers seem to be under the impression that Scottish ales should be made hoppier. Though this is not exactly a traditional wee heavy, it is a very good example of a North American take on the style that manages to be quirky and individualistic, but does not break entirely with tradition."

"Pours a murky dark reddish brown with very small yellowish brown head. Aroma of maple, dark fruits, figs, raisins, candy sugar, alcohol. Flavor is maple, brown sugar, fig, and pears. Surprisingly high and prickly carbonation. Medium sticky body. A bit dry. Not my favorite, but not a bad beer. I really like a bit more body to my wee heavy brews, and I find everything thus far from Dieu Du Ciel to be extremely light on the palate for the styles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Scotch ales rarely wow me but this one is quite good. I like the added complementary sweetness of the maple syrup. I'd certainly drink it again without hesitation."
""
""
"O: Pleasant surprise. My second Dieu Du Ciel experience and both have been stellar. The complexity is awesome. The maple syrup lingers, which is unique to beers brewed w/ maple. I'll buy another to see how it ages."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No hiding the alcohol in this one. Don't taste much in the way of maple. Very grainy bitterness, not a hoppy beer. Certainly not as smooth or sweet as other Scotch ales. Overall a very dry beer, not a thirst quencher. Something to have on occasion when you want to explore unique flavors."

"The most noticeable attribute about this beer is its incredibly low carbonation. When I poured it, not even a slight head formed. The body is very befitting of a beer with such a low carbonation; very smooth and slightly syrupy. Speaking of Syrup, the maple syrup, the sweet maple flavor blends very well with the natural flavors befitting of scotch ales and especially with this one; sweet, caramely, malty, peaty, slightly smokey etc. But overall this beer is sweet. Not overly sweet, but sweet nonetheless. Good beer to try once, but this is something I definitely will not be buying again. Slightly dissapointed, since not only have I heard such amazing things about Dieu du Ciel!, but I also love wee heavies. I've had brown ales flavored with maple syrup before but never any scottish ales. It seems like a great idea and I definitely wouldn't mind trying another one like this in the future."

"O: A solid scotch ale with a nice mellow sweetness from the maple syrup. Nothing in your face, but it's decently complex and interesting. The 9.5% is nowhere to be found, and sneaks up on you. Not around for very long as it's only brewed once a year, so get some if you find it"
""
""
"Light to medium body, slightly syrupy."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"O: a nice Scotch ale - I wasn't overly fond of the maple - maybe it made it too maple syrupy for me. I would have like some drier flavors in there (this would probably blossom if aged in whiskey barrels). A solid beer from a great Canadian brewery."

"O- Decent but not that great. Has a weird sweetness to it, not a huge fan. Probably won't drink again, although I haven't had many I can say there are definitely much better scotch ales out there."
"O- nice take on this Scotch ale... especially with maple syrup .... crazy for the price through ... but still something nice to grab for a change up"
"Nice complex beer. Worth trying."
""
""
"No head to speak of on a murky amber body. Aroma is pretty boozy with raisins, caramel and candy sugar. This one is pretty hard to drink at first. Some of the most prevalent toffee notes of any beer I have had. Also fig, raisin, caramel, lots of maple syrup. The malts are strong too. Medium body and light carbonation. This one was too hard to drink for me. Lots of flavor but a little too much of a boozy and sweet combination."
"OVERALL: This was really good, with very complex flavors and a nice, well measured touch of maple syrup. A touch boozy perhaps, and head could be a little more impressive, but this is solid beer for sure. Recommended."
""
""
"Certainly an acceptable Scotch ale. Warrants a try if you're into the style, otherwise you can get Traquair House for a similar price (at least in the US)."
"Pours a dark brown with a slight orange hue. Head rises upon pour, but goes quickly. Smell has a fig note and there's a trace of maple. The taste goes similarly. Alcohol is present, keeping sips small. The maple isn't as strong as I was expecting and definitely not as strong as I would have liked. Aftertaste is a little odd. I can't pin it, but I really wish it didn't linger like it does. Overall, I would say it's a interesting beer that I don't regret trying, but for the price tag, it isn't exactly the best choice at the store. I do applaud the brewery for their continued creativity, though."
""
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a cloudy red/orange amber. Slight head with slight lacing. Sweet malt, dark fruit and maple sugar aroma. Delicious. Sweet malty Scotch ale with distinct maple flavor. Heavy bodied and almost viscous. A bit sweet, but flavors carry it through. A later tasting with a year old, properly cellared bottle had almost identical characteristics."
""
"Overall, a little disappointing. The charred flavor and tangy note don't feel like they belong."
"Though truly masculine in taste, the beer is not without refinement. The combination creates a gentlemanly approach that challenges the palate with each sip but also comforts the taste buds charm and strength."
"Overall: I think it's great, and I hope this review and score helps bring up the average on it. Great flavors, and would make for a solid dessert on its own. Definitely a sipper, but hey, with everything going for it, I'll sip it all night."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and carbonated; I would have liked a slightly fuller body. Decent creaminess, fairly dry in the finish. Not bad but didn’t delver the maple I was looking for."
"O: A solid scotch ale with a nice twist. I enjoyed this effort from Dieu Du Ciel, but the QPR isn't really there in the end."
""
"This beer is medium to heavy bodied. Carbonation just barely nips at the tongue, and the beer feels a little thicker. This is a sipper, and I would say is best enjoyed on a slightly chillier spring day over the warmer day I am experiencing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. As somebody who is neither a big of Scotch ales nor maple syrup, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this one."
"The body if full and chewy with soft carbonation. Overall this one is tasty. Enjoyable and balanced offering from these guys."
""
""
""
""
"Overall very impressed, this is really good if served at the right temperature, maybe about 14 degrees Celcsius - this is amazing and delicious. it would definitelly be worth putting away to cellar. YUM"
"Drank just fine out of me Guinness goblet."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Although I purchased this bottle from a new store, I wonder about the age here as ""0" and ""9" are notched into the label and I haven't seen this elsewhere; I'll try it another time in case I have an off bottle but this doesn't much taste like any Wee Heavy I have encountered before, other than the peat element (which I enjoyed for a brief moment)"
""
"T: Big maltiness upfront with some raisin, plum and something that definitely tastes like scotch. Booziness fades on the finish and a big maple syrup note takes over. Definitely a sipper but really good stuff."
""
"O: A very strong beer and that is something you can tell from the hints of alcohol and the sweetness. Definitely more of a sipping beer but not one that you want a large serving - a little moderation with this is a good thing. I like the flavors in the beer that complement the sweetness."
"Overall - An enjoyable scotch ale. The maple brings a nice twist to a classic flavour; very unique, but was hoping to get more of the aroma. The flavours are quite potent, perhaps due to this bottle being aged from February 2011. Definitely worth a try for those interested in the style."
""
"Overall: reminiscent of a good Belgian ale with a perfect malty flavour; very drinkable. Only fault is that the promised maple is just a bit too subtle"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice enough beer, though advertising the maple makes me wonder where it is, and dock it a bit in my book. Good beer for a cold Winnipeg night."
""
""
"This beer poured out with a nice brown color with a creamy light tan color head on top. The smell of the beer was malty and sweet. The taste of the beer is pretty powerful, there is a good amount of maple in there too. The mouthfeel of this beer is medium to heavy with a bit of an oily feel to it. Overall it's a pretty good Scotch Ale, I would try it again if I came across it."

"Cheers!"
"11.5 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled in 2010(I think). Pours hazy reddish brown color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Some nice bits of lacing cling to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, dark fruits, whiskey, spices, molasses, maple syrup, and alcohol. Some nice aromas that are improving a bit as it warms. Taste of big caramel, maple syrup, molasses, whiskey, spices, and a bit of wood. No bitterness noticed on the finish; and lingering notes of maple syrup, caramel, molasses, and some whiskey on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming on the finish noticed. Nice smooth drinkability for the level of alcohol, but is still a sipper. Nice balance of flavors. Overall a really nice scotch ale. The maple syrup definitely has a strong presence in this."
"O - This one is well worth a shot and offers something a little different.Has Quad like qualities."
"Overall, this is a very solid Wee Heavy, and a cool example of maple in a beer. After most of a year, the maple is still very evident in this, and it's drinking quite smoothly. I'll probably hold onto my other bottle for another few months or so and see how it is."
"D - Pretty drinkable, especially considering the richness and the 9.5% abv. I really like the mix of maple syrup into the scotch ale. It is a bit unbalanced and richly sweet, but I kind of like that."
"Full-bodied with a creamy texture. It took me a while to decide if I was a fan of the mouthfeel. I couldn't decide if I'd rather have a more syrupy texture, but near the end of the glass I was glad it wasn't. The alcohol is only occasionally noticeable in the taste and instead provides a nice lip/tongue numbing effect. This beer became significantly better with warmth. A fairly easy drinker for the style + ABV."
"Had on tap at the Blue Monk last night.Came to the table in a goblet a burnt orange infused chesnut brown with a thin head atop.Brown sugar,dark fruit,maple,and lightly roasted nut in a rich nose.Thick and chewey the mouthfeel is everything you would want in the style.Dark fruit and brown sugar malt flavors with atinge of mable,as it warmed sweet alcohol cameinto play.I really enjoyed this warming wee heavy."
"Been looking forwards to this one for a while since i have found a new found love for SA/WH's and it pours the deepest mahogany hue which leaves a two finger creamy head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is scotch,maple syrup,honey,xmas cake and a touch of brandy,the mouthfeel is silky smooth,medium bodied and warming with tastes of jarrah honey,maple syrup,fruit cake,raisins,caramel and finished with a touch of herbal hops mixed with sweet candy and overall i really like this brew as the high ABV is very well hidden behind the sweetness and i find it hits most of the notes for this style and is definately one of the better examples going around and i would buy again cheers."
"A beer that really grew on me as I waded through it, with touches both subtle & overt, a lovely mix. Very good beer, best I've had from this brewery."
"Overall, while the taste of alcohol does prove detrimental, Equinoxe is a great beer. I only wish I didn't have to drive to Montreal every time I wanted one."
"D - If you have patience (and appropriate cellar conditions) this eventually develops into a very good Scotch ale. It's still a one and done type of beer, but I find myself constantly reaching for another sip. I'm quite curious what the barrel-aged version tastes like. Still - drinks a little bigger than the listed ABV."
"Overall: I enjoyed the combination of flavors in this one and would have it again."
"Mouthfeel is nice and velvety. Nice alcoholic warmth, but not overpowering. I like this one a lot. I should have bought more than one bottle."
"Fairly light in mouthfeel for a sweeter than normal scotch ale. Very pleasant."
"Overall a really nice Scotch ale. Probably one of my personal favorites to date. Really hoping to visit their brewpub someday and sample their offerings on tap."
"Overall, this is a tasty scotch ale from Dieu Du Ciel and another great offering in their strong line up of brews. Nothing really stands out, but the maple syrup is a nice touch and plays well with the rest of the flavor profile. If you are a fan of the style, then I'm sure you'll like this beer."
"O/D - No complaints here. Just a solid beer from DDC. Couldn't say I would have a few of these in a night but it's tasty and the maple adds a nice element. I find that maple is a common 'different' ingredient in Canadian beers that doesn't often work, but DDC got it right here."
"D: A fairly nice showing for Dieu Du Ciel. Nothing mind blowing, but it was above average. I don't know how much my girlfriend paid for this, but I would buy this again if it were in the $6-7 range (I'm guessing it was closer to $9)."
"The pour was by far the best part as a rich caramel colored mixture came forward right out of the gate. Rich looking and almost opaque except for the lightest bit of color poking through on the sides and the bottom of the glass. A huge head of light tan color then came up and over the top, settling down only lightly into a nice pillow that seemed to stay on top throughout the rest of the session. Lots of lacing here as well, really starting to show off with how good this one really is. Rich caramel malts here, hints of herbal notes, and a touch of grass round it out very nicely, and as I take the first sip I am amazed at how big this one is. Really very full feel here with lots of carbonation and really a very well put together profile. Smooth, silky as it rolls across the tongue with loads of sweetness and an wonderful sense of grainy malts and nice touches of an almost brown sugar like taste. Very drinkable, I could have done this one all day long."
"Not the best scotch ale out there, but definitely fantastic."
"If I got this as an extra in a trade, or was offered one by a friend, I'd have it, nurse it, and enjoy it. Would not buy again."
"D: People are greatly mistaken if they say they can drink this all day long. It's a good session beer. This was pared with a grilled pork chop with Dijon mustard and spice rub, sweet potatoes fries, and steamed broccoli. It blended well. However, the alcohol content (9.5% ABV) would prevent me from going more than one per session. For the flavor, I feel that it needed to be bigger to match the alcohol content. This high, the beer needs a BIG flavor otherwise it gets buried."
"Overall. A winner, and a unique take on a scotch ale. Highlights all the classic features you'd expect but the maple syrup compliments it without undermining the integrity of the style. Wonderful, another gold star for Dieu Du Ciel."
"I really like this beer and bought it after loving the Kaiser Curmudgeon on tap at Founders. This is a decent substitute for KC, which I can't get anymore."
"D: Relatively new to the scotch ale variety but this is probably my favourite one to date. Alcohol level up there, but I'll be looking forward to sipping this again."
"O. Overall a pretty good beer. Like the maple flavors. Not my favorite style of beer, but I like this one."
"Overall – The alcohol was well hidden and the beer was very drinkable. It’s not the best I’ve had from DDC but it is surely worth seeking out."
"As the Scots are fond of saying: Failing means yer playin! In other words, this may not have hit the mark as a scotch ale, but it's a unique concept, an intriguing recipe and, all considered, an absorbing beer to drink. Besides, far be it for me to tell Dieu Du Ciel how to do their job; if any Canadians know their way around the brew-kettle it's those guys."
"On the whole, this one is interesting. The intense malt borders on boozy barrel-aged qualities that I'm not crazy about, but the vibrancy that the maple lends is interesting enough to counteract it. I'm definitely digging this one."
"Wee heavy is one beer style I am not too fond of but this Dieu Du Ciel offering is quite pleasant with the expected big taste and array of flavours complimented by subtle under-and-overtones created by addition of maple syrup. Again, I'm not a big fan of this style but one of these every so often would be more than welcome."
"The texture is amazing, smooth and fairly viscous despite the light golden color. This drinks really smooth and hides the alcohol well. For it's ABV it's quite drinkable, but this is definitely a brew to be sipped and savored."
"Good with cheese after dinner. Sampled at a beer tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"Great for a taster. Not something I'm going to seek out. Happy to have tried it."
"A bit boozy but flavors are so good I could still have a few of these. Really superb malt flavor here."
"jd"
" If you enjoy a good scotch ale, here's one to taste. Not terrible on the price (around $6) and very warming. Just what a scotch ale should be."
"I wouldn't hesitate to say this is one of the best beers Diel du Ciel puts out, and they have a nice portfolio of high abv beers. Easy drinkability and very smooth."
"Pours an apple cider like brown with a slight reddish hue and a skim head that is slightly off white and goes away quickly. Little to no lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is of raisins sweet brown sugar, alcohol, and maple syrup. It is an inviting sweet smell. The taste is of dark fruits raisins and figs along with brwon sugar a hint of vanilla and a nice smooth maple syrup taste. The taste like the nose has an inviting sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is low carbonation and slightly thin, a little watery. The drinkability it good, it is a very smooth drink with well blended flavors and a well hidden alcohol character. A great beer to sip and savor."
"Overall- very tasty, but was expecting more maple. Very drinkable. Hides the abv very well."
"Very interesting beer. This is one of those pricey beers that I would actually buy again and pull out for a special occasion."
"This comes in as my second favorite for the style behind Backwoods Bastard. A really tasty beer with discernible maple syrup. No problem finishing this in a moderate time frame. Too bad this puppy is so spendy. It is worth the money at least once though."
"I don't shy away from the sweet, and this takes it beyond in a very good way. Mmmm, genius."
"Taste is nutty, sweet and maple-syrupy. Interesting enough, but a little disappointing...very one-dimensionally sweet. A yeasty presence gives this one a praline pie overall taste and feel. Doesnt quite come together for me, not very Scotch Ale-esque and has too much residual sweetness."
"Delicious and surprisingly complex. Another Dieu Du Ciel winner."
"D: i typically dont care for scotch ales but this one is good and there is a nice balance of flavors with out taking away form the style"
"drinks very well. a tad boozy, but could be worse for the style and strength. the maple is well integrated and makes this probably my favorite of the style that I have tried so far."
"i wouldn't say this with any of their beer but this one. I believe this was meant to be had fresh and after some time in the bottle. Every one of there beers seem to gain quite a character and some definition between the expected and something quite unique. This is no different with their scotch ale. I just believe once settled in the bottle it gets a tad syrupy. There is definitely maple. Added and the predominate quality. Nose and palate with notes of warmth, honey, and toasted malt. Some cinnamon and subtle coriander. I can feel the sugar from on the glass even. Rich esters that are taken over by maple sweet. Although there are walnut notes."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/3/3.5"
"Poured a dark brown with brwon highlights that had a thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. The aromas had dark fruits, caramel, slight maple, brown sugar, and a significant amount of booze. The flavor was pretty much the same as the nose consisting of caramel, toffee, and brown sugar dominating the palate with maple and dark fruit accents. The brew was medium to full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, sticky, and slightly boozy. It drank pretty good and was a solid interpretation of a wee heavy. This brewery is definitely growing on me."
"D- A commendable Scoth Ale from DDC, perfect for this time of year."
"Pours a somewhat murky medium brown that is mostly opaque. Thin head. Nose brings dark fruits, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and hints of maple. Taste is fairly sweet with a touch if booze and some fruit. Moderate feel with a nice smoothness to it. Drinks quite well. Another hit from the folks up North."
"Getting back to the aroma, it really is quite spicy, earthy and woody too with notes of pepper, ginger, even some cardamom, some clove, a rich prune character, concentrated dark figs and rum soaked raisins. This is definitely note your typically cleanly fermented Scotch ale; instead it is a Belgian-take via Canuck-interpretation that has graced my glass. The balance is really the key for this beer; it is sweet, but the earthy, spicy, woody (is this last where the maple comes in) really helps to balance this in the end. This is a fantastic desert beer to finish my night"
"Yeah, a usable ale - less sweet than worse scotch ales I've had but retaining that heat, so while it's good it's not THAT drinkable."
"D - I could drink this all day! The flavors are incredible, the alcohol taste is minimal, and the semi-sweetness is a welcomed one. Of course, I know the alcohol is in there somewhere, and I'm sure I'd be down for the count after my second or third bottle. Sip slowly and enjoy this beer for as long as you can!"
"I like this stuff. It just doesnt look too appealing."
"D- Perfect as a Wee Heavy Scotch Ale, the maple syrup is present enough to add some depth and light sweetness, but in the background so as not to overwhelm the classic Scotch malt notes. Full bodied, nice sipping warming alcohol presence, perfect for a cool evening. (two notes: surprised they are using twist off caps, just an observation, secondly I really like the label art work)"
"D - A very good and very unique beer. I really enjoyed this. The ABV was very well hidden."
"Velvety mouthfeel. Ample caramel candy sweetness with a fruity finish, presumably from the maple. I've read on previous reviews that this was a hot mess but by the time this bottle got to me all the alcohol had faded out. Good."
"I'm pretty sure this is a 2009 bottle, though it could be a 2008. I really don't recall, but it has been in my cellar for over a year. Got it in a trade from someone? Thanks, whoever you are!"
"A little too boozy but overall quite nice."
"Scotch Ale brewed with Maple syrup- sounds like the kind of thing for a rainy day. Pours a slightly murky brown with little head. Smells very nice and quite complex. Pleasant notes of banana, raisin bread, nuts, and maple syrup. Breakfast anyone? The taste is sharper and a bit woodier than the aroma, with clear oak notes and some more firmness, otherwise similar notes as in the nose. A bit lean in the mouth, but better than it being overly sweet. Nice."
"Picked up by my wife on a whim the other day at Argonaut Liqours. We shared the bottle. Poured a medium amber color, with a smallish off-white head. Very boozy on the nose, with brown sugar, apple cider and caramel. On the palate,this one is kinda thin and full of alcoholic heat. A little maple, a little scotch and a lot of heat."
"While it lacks some of the roasted malt, toffee and smokiness notes you can get with other Scotch Ales, the addition of maple syrup adds a unique touch to the style. It's a smooth beer but the drinkability is not high. Makes a great dessert beer that pairs well with dark chocolate."
"Dark, sweet and tasty. This is a really rich ale which celebrates the creativity and skill of Quebec brewing. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and medium-bodied. Coats the mouth moderately well, which creates a nice lingering sweetness. Its drinkability is decent; not a quick drink, more of a moderate sipper. Very good for a night cap. Reminiscent of a nice liquor."
"An interesting and flavorful brew to say the least. Drinkability is only slightly impaired by the weighty ABV. Given the right situation, I definitely could have knocked down another one. Not bad for my first wee heavy. Will have to try others of the same style to compare!"
"D: The alcohol isn't particularly hidden in that it is quite warming, though the flavour is quite masked. I don't know if I make a point of seeking it out actively, but it's an interesting experience, nonetheless."
"D: This beer just isn't very cohesive. It's not something I'd want to drink much of. There are too many other beers in this segment that I would choose before this one."
"Pours a one finger off-white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Cloudy brown/amber color, with some yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Malty maple nose. Flavor is roasty malt with maple, hints of the higher ABV and is warming. Nice variation of a scotch ale. $5.29 for a 11.5oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"A nice take on the style, and I dig the addition of maple to it, however I think I've sampled this too young, I have a feeling that it'll round out more in time and smooth out the rougher edges in the process."
"A very good beer, I plan on getting a couple more bottles, maybe drink one in the late fall and maybe let the other age a year or so. I really would have rated it higher, but not that fitting to the style."
"Pours an orangish-brown colour with a thin strip of white head that doesn't go away. Lots of maple in the smell, with some nuttiness I think. Flavour is great with maple (though, I'm partial to maple), caramel, and dried fruits. Very smooth beer and it hides the alcohol well."
"D - the flavours work well, but there is a definite bite, no hiding of the 9.1% here, don't think i'd want to attempt more than one or two in a sitting"
"Still, a very interesting brew from Dieu du Ciel, who have a habit of coming up with interesting and well-made beers. Not my favourite of theirs, but I'm glad I got to sample it."
"D: With the booze, the heavy feel and all the sugar, it somewhat loses here. But, it's well balanced and still go down quite easily."
"The beer has a darkened reddish brown body and a small off-white head. The aroma has lots of caramelized malt, maple syrup and a fair bit of booze. It even smells sweet. The malt smells worty, perhaps a bit under-attenuated, at least for my taste. The beer has a sweet taste, very sweet. It's like a slightly fermented maple syrup mixed with some malt. Actually, I almost really like it, but the booziness hurts things significantly. The maple syrup is interesting, but it's just out of control, in my opinion. Mouthfeel is sticky and cloying. I'm having trouble getting through the 11.5 oz bottle. I could see this beer aging well, but I'm not a fan of this one fresh."
"All in all, this brew definitely surprised me. It's better than I expected. Very sweet, boozy, and malty... my type of brew. I'd say if you like a good malty big beer once in a while, then give this one a try. If you're looking for the hops, then avoid this one. Worth hunting down."
"D: ehhh....more then one is more then enough"
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for something with such a high ABV. Could easily toss back a few of these at a time. The flavours are intense, but still very refreshing. Highly recommended to anyone looking for something bold and sweet."
"D: The ABV rears its head and it's a sipper, but it goes down deceptively easily."
"I'd recommend trying it, I really enjoyed it"
"I was careful in pouring this one as the label read ""Bottle Conditioned", plus I could see a fair amount of lees in the bottom of the bottle. As such, I produced only wisps on the pour. Color was a deep reddish-amber with NE-quality clarity, another reason not to muddy it up carelessly. Nose was really sugary sweet, definitely a maple syrup base! Mouthfeel was fairly full, not viscous, but close. Man, was I getting a LOT of malty sweetness on the tongue. The finish was awash in maple syrup. I felt like sitting down to a stack of pancakes to perhaps soak up some of the alcohol. This would be the far end of the spectrum from what I would normally drink, but it was bought and paid for, so it made a nice interlude on the afternoon."
"Suffice it to say the emphasis is on the 'heavy' in this wee heavy, Fat Bastard himself would be proud! One smooth-drinking, filling, and cockles-warming elixir, this one is. An appropriate offering for we north of the 49th parallel, as the onset of springtime predicated by the equinox normally still means snow on the ground and sub-zero temps that have overstayed their welcome."
"drinkability - this is a smooth beverage at 9.5%, but you likely wouldnt drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting"
"D: Amazing beer. I was expecting this to be overly sweet, but it wasn't. The flavours were mellow and complimented each other well. If it aged longer it would be an easier drink. Hats off to DDC yet again for an amazing brew."
" Really happy Dieu Du Ciel bottle this and make it available every year.Hopefully they will bottle the Mea Culpa cream ipa they brew and have on tap from time to time.That beer is god!!!"
"D: This is a beer that can only really be sipped. I would definitely try this again, particularly if it is available again next spring."
"D - Quite possibly the best maple beer I've had. Don't know if I could drink more than or two in a session though."
"The alcohol in this one pushes the flavour around just a bit too frequently to make this a very drinkable beer. That said, there are some great flavours to it, and it is worth trying out to see if it is your thing."
"It is good stuff, but I wouldn't call it a sessionable beer. One feels good for a cold evening, but probably a good idea to switch to something else after that one glass."
"Can't say I'm a huge fan of this one. One is nice enough, glad I tried it, etc. The flavors are a bit muddled overall, even in their ""restrained"" state, & the alcohol doesn't justify itself. After this & the Rosee de Hibiscus, I'm starting to realize that some of BDdC!'s descriptions are more appetizing than the product."
"I don't find this to be too drinkable. I'd only buy this again in order to see how it ages. If some more age smoothed out the alcohol, I could see myself enjoying this. As is I'm having a hard time getting through this 341ml bottle. This is not one of the better DDC beers I've had."
"Good quality beer."
"Definite alcohol presence when tasting... quite sweet with some molasses notes... bit of heat and cinnamon... nice."
"Equinoxe Du Printemps (Spring Equinox) tastes and feels and drinks more like liqueur than beer. I'm usually on-board with that concept, but this brew doesn't have a broad enough or deep enough flavor profile. Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel might impress me one of these days. It hasn't happened yet. Not to mention... $5.49 per single is ridiculous. Bourbon County Stout is cheaper than that."
"Maple does work well with this, similar to the Sappy Slappy Bastard from Founders."
"d: a bit strong for heavy drinking, but a pleasant sipping beer"
"being almost April I`m over a week late for the Equinoxe de Printemp but here in Calgary spring is quite often late anyways so I may be just on time"
"Notes: Very rich brew, probably a good candidate for some aging although it is great in this form. Pity that it is fairly uncommon to find these around."
"Overall, this beer is fine, as are most other beers I have sampled from this brewery. It's up there in alcohol, which is masked relatively well in the flavor profile. It is a sweet ale, with some bitter notes on the edges of the tongue, allowing the flavors to stand out and really pack a punch."
"Pours a cloudy amber/orange.. very cloudy. Smells of maple, bananas, honey and loads of alcohol. The taste is more that of maple and alcohol.. don't pick up on bananas or honey, but unfortunately lots of alcohol. Despite this, its a great session brew, but doubt i could have two. Enjoy the maple sweetness and bet this would be excellent with dessert."
"Looking forward to tasting some of this breweries selections on tap in May, when I head to Montreal for a music festival."
"Poured into a tulip style glass. Pours a cloudy brown with orange highlights. Creamy beige head quickly goes into a thin film with very good lacing. Heavy malt and alcohol aromas with a slight maple syrup aroma as it warms. No mistaking this style its a Scotch ale all the way. Heavy malted sweetness and strong alcohol prescences. A bit of a maple after taste. Alcohol burn on the tongue and lips a bit sticky. A beer to sink your teeth in but not having too many in a sitting."
"My first from this brewery, a very good beer but could be a little too sweet to have more than one."
"I was quite taken by everything but the price. At five and a half bucks per little bottle, it would have to be as good as its big sister, Péché Mortel, to be taken seriously; and it is not quite there."
"Sweet crystal malt and maple syrup flavor. Enough hop to provide interest and keep the Scotch Ale true to form. There's a touch of smokiness and molasses. Rich body as expected. I wouldn't describe this as a quaffing beer, but like others from Dieu du Ciel, it is complex and interesting."
"D: An immensely drinkable beer. Good for this time of year."
"Pours dark brown with NO head whatsoever except for a very weak ring forms and stays. When held up to the light sediment is seen floating about. Smell is good, cola, caramel, definitely getting the maple. Taste..yeah, now I'm definitely getting the maple. The tastes match the smell for sure, but this thing is way too sweet, it tastes like a thick maple soda. Extremely malty, alcohol definitely makes itself known. Reminds me alot of a doppelbock (not a complaint). I became more used to the taste a little ways down, but sweetness is way too overpowering here. A Scotch ale brewed with maple syrup sounded like a great idea, but this thing is kind of a mess."
"The mouthfeel is medium to full with good carbonation, overall pretty spot on for the style. Drinkability is a bit low due to the lack of balance, I'd rather have a richer and heavier wee heavy than one that is this sweet."
"D - Very drinkable, very pleasant. Somehow rather characteristically and paradoxically like and unlike scotch ale, but the maple in here really compliments the scotch's dense sweetness. I actually really like this quite a bit, and would enjoy having it around, especially on cold days for sitting by the fire, after dinner, or holed up in the snow reading a good book."
"Pours a deep rusty copper with a scarce off white head that leaves substantial lace as it recedes. The smell is sweet malt up front, similar to a dopplebock, some licorice, then the maple comes through with notes of chocolate and orange peel as it warms. The taste is similar to the smell with some nut and sweet orange but is nothing too bold. It's a pretty full-bodied beer, with carbonation that gives a good bite and leads to a dry, sweet finish. It's a very tasty beer, pretty right on with the maple syrup without being too cloying or leaving a bad taste in your mouth after you've drank it. This beer has great timing on the palate with nice flavors being delivered, but leaving crisply without overstaying their welcome and only leaving behind some lingering sweetness and some stick in the mouth. Subtle flavors and high alcohol make for a nice sipping beer."
"This beer is very thick and is a sipping beer at best. It has a throaty burn from the ABV, which I never appreciate, it has some warming alcohol notes, and a maple sugary consistency and taste. The beer is loaded with sweet malts, some pineapple like flavors, maybe some florals, but it is the ABV which just overwhelms the better qualities of this beer. It lacks the nice smokiness of a Scotch ale. I've had about enough of this beer and away it will go."
"Very good to throw into the mix, as an occasion beer or just something to break up the same old routine. A little too much for everyday drinking though, which is not a bad thing."
"Drinkability was somewhat poor. The booziness became nearly unbearable by the drink's end. Furthermore, the dry and woody flavors in this beer were rather overbearling. This could definitely benefit from more time in the cellar."
"Drinkability isn't too high. It's a pretty hot beer that's not terribly interesting to drink. While I got it in trade (thx Northyorksammy!), their beers are generally on the pricey side, which certainly doesn't help."
"Taste starts off with a flash of toasted malts before big sweet maltiness takes over. Caramel and overripe fruits swell, with lots of sweetness. Slight earthy edge, and hints of bubble gum (ester?). Light herbal notes come in near the finish, but the big story is how the maple syrup pours on big-time. It almost tastes like maple syrup was added after bottling! Lingering maple syrup sweetness. Full-bodied, with a syrupy feel. A little sweet for these taste buds, but very interesting. If you like maple syrup, this beer is for you."
"pretty full bodied, moderate carbonation doesn't detract from the beer.worth a shot."
"Drinkability: this beer was just a bit too sweet for my liking. One glass is enough in a session."
"11.5 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Aroma is of sweet malts and syrup/honey! Really cool smell, really cool. Taste is warming and malty with some bourbon type taste in the background. The sweetness does a good job of masking the high wee heavy ABV. My first Dieu Du Ciel beer and by no chance will it be my last. Unique, mysterious and intriguing, I couldn't be more excited!"
"Poured into a chalice a nice cloudy amberish color, some carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice spice notes, slight dark fruits, and caramel. The taste is malty, sweet (maple syrup), some dark fruits, spices, caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, really liken this one tonight, very tasty. So far every brew I've have from this brewery is pretty awesome."
"Pours a cloudy caramel color with a finger full of loose light tan foam that fades to stringy patterns of lacing. Really enjoying the aggressive malty sweet complex vanilla toffee aroma. Full flavored, a sweet maple syrup leads a vanilla bourbon character that lingers nicely. The lightly carbonated mouth feel reveals the tangy nature of a light-medium bodied barleywine. A really fine drinker, the 9.5% ABV is integrated well. Highly recommended."
"D - This is an unusual scotch ale that breaks the normal boundaries of the style, but does so successfully. There is a lot of complexity, mostly from the sugar and malt notes, and it is well balanced. A nice sipping beer."
"Drinkability for me is not quite that good. The alcohol is a bit much here but this is a great drink for the winter months coming up."
"Overall, a decent beer. I am not for sure, but I am guessing all the sugar in the maple syrup had something to do with all the alcohol in this beer. I think it would be a lot better if the abv was able to be toned down a bit. I do like it that I can taste the maple syrup, however. An interesting brew, maybe not worth the price tag."
"Not sure how I feel about this: not bad, though not perhaps at par for what I would expect from DDC. Nonethless, enjoyed drinking it though, probably, with all the selection from DDC, wouldn't choose it again."
"I am finding that this brewery is especially given over to intense flavor bombs..."
"Drinkability- Very nice but strong, and I am only half way through."
"A very tasty and smooth Scotch ale. Malty and sweet, but big alcohol and interesting woody, earthy quality brings balance."
"drinkability - for me not so good - too sweet high abv along with a heavy body makes me not want to buy another - thats not to say its not a good beer because it is"
"Easy to drink for a beer this big, The maple is a nice touch giving this beer a unique flavor."
"mouthfeel is syrupy, disgustingly thick and full of sediment. great. drinkability takes a small hit for the beer being so sweet all the way around, but otherwise, it keeps you sipping."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a thin offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has an alcohol filled scent that boasts of burnt toffee and maple notes. The taste is good. It has a smooth burnt toffee flavor that goes down slow and warm with a touch of sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very nice Scotch ale. It has a killer warmth to it with loads of caramel malt and maple character."
"Unique flavor profile makes this worth trying at least once. For the money though I can't imagine reaching for this if Peche Mortel is on the shelf next to it."
"Looks like murky iced tea with only a shading of head atop. Some sediment from the bottom of the bottle came with the aggressive pour. Smells fruity, malty and nutty with some banana, green apple, maple, and a little alcohol. Tastes unlike any other scotch ale I've had. It's malty and the maple that follows the fruity esters is not cloying or overpowering at all, but rather subtle. This is a hefty beer and the alcohol demands to much attention in the flavor, detracting from drinkability. Glad I killed my curiosity, but won't purchase this again."
"Would love to cellar a couple of these and see how they fare 1-2 years down the line."
"11.5 ounce bottle, 9.5% ABV. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy reddish/brown color with a very small off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Lacing is OK. The aroma is sweet, it smells like maple syrup, toffee, bananas, wood and booze. It tastes like maple, apple brandy, bananas and toffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit rich and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. It would be much easier to drink if the booze taste wasn't so noticable. I probably should have aged this a bit longer as it's still hot. Overall, I think it's a decent brew that I would try again. However, it's not one of the better Dieu Du Ciel beers I've tried."
"Final Thought: A great concept that falls a tad short of greatness, a pricey beer that is fairly two-dimensional."
"D- Like mentioned above, the sweetness and booziness limit the drinkability of this brew for me."
"D- A sipper for sure at 9.5%. Easy to drink with just a different spin to keep things interesting."
"Bottle. Pours a dirty brown with a small tan head. Aroma of alcohol, banana laffy taffy, medicinal nastiness. Flavor is sweet, definitely syrupy, with more laffy taffy notes as well as sweet caramel. Boozy. Flavor is better than the aroma, but when the aroma is that bad...it's hardly meaningful. Ick."
"Overall, a nice and sweet caramel maple syrup beer."
"This is a great beer. I am continually impressed with this brewery. Very unique and highly recommended."
"EDIT: tried a second bottle at the DDC! Meet & Greet at Chancey Smith's and it was tasting much better. The head lasted longer, I got some nice floral, resinous aromas on the nose, and the maple came through a lot more in the flavour. It was also far less boozy than my first sample. I've upped the score accordingly."
"The nose is pretty sweet, sort of citrus combined with maple and brown sugar and a little bit of alcohol behind it all. The taste is even sweeter. There is a strong maple flavor, very sugary. There is a dark fruit medley involved within the flavor as well. I guess I'd pick out figs, apricots, orange zest and caramel to be the forerunners in the flavor department. The booze hits you with a nice warmth and all-in-all this beer is sweet, thick and warming. A fabulous combination. All of this gets balanced out with a sharp bitterness at the end of each sip. I liked this stuff a lot."
"A very nice example of the style. Perhaps a bit too boozy but it will definitely mellow out. Still quite drinkable at this stage."
"EDIT: After reading other reviews, I agree there's definitely a bananas foster thing going on here. Nice catch."
"The mouthfeel is big and thick with a good amount of carbonation. Adds up to a nice drinkable product, good beer...expensive, but good."
"Drinkability- Overall on the the top wee heavy's I've had. A style that I really haven't grasped yet, nor even like that much...but this one was quite tasty."
"Not a bad beer, however this is not my to go beer. After all this is a sipping beer. Good to have one or two per year :)"
"D: I was pretty underwhelmed by this. My least favorite DDC beer so far, by a wide margin."
"12 ounce bottle via Glouglouburp- pours a murky chestnut with a lively beige head. Nose- Sweetness from the syrup and malt is predominant. Taste- nutty, cookie dough malt, with extra kick of maple sweetness and brown sugar. Finish dries out and is quite boozy. HInt of smoke and oak on the finish as well."
"Oh yeah, got this from notdan through CanBIF. Thanks Dan! :)"
"This is a drinkable scotch ale, but watch the ABV. I was a little dissappointed in the fact that the maple flavor was a bit week."
"D - I am a huge fan of BDDC (except the pepper beer), and this was no exception, huge flavor and easy drinking make this dangerous"
"Pours an iced tea brown color with a small tan head that leaves a light ring, almost looks flat. The aroma is sweet, a bit vinous, brown sugar, a brown bread malt, and rubbing alcohol. The taste is of rum soaked raisins, vinous, brown sugar, cinnamon raisin bread. The malt is outplayed by the sweetness of the brew, no roasted qualities or smokiness. Way too sweet and boozy. The feel is chewy, a bit sticky, suprisingly not slick, prickly carbonation. Finishes sweet and hot from the ABV. A very disappointing Wee Heavy, not about the malt just about the booze. A very hot brew, sweet flavors; should showcase the malt. Boo. The label indicated that this was 9.5ABV. Great brewery just not digg'n this brew at all."
"An interesting beer. It's a very unique take on a scotch ale, and again I don't think I'd dare call this a true scotch, it's very much a Belgian beer. I like it, not my favorite from the brewery, but good none the less."
"This one pours an opaque dark amber color. The smell is of oak and maple. Taste is impressive. Maple, oak, and caramel. The alcohol is completely unnoticeable. Extremely smooth and considerably thick--very reminiscent of maple syrup. I'm very impressed and enjoyed this one thoroughly. A very unique beer."
"Poured a deeper and cloudy amber color (almost brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of maple syrup, woody, vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Tastes of maple, toffee, caramel, the same woodiness, and some dark fruits. Light to medium alcohol in the finish."
"Drinkability takes a hit from the richness. This is a really nice beer, but it's a slow sipper despite only being 7% abv, and drinking more than one or two isn't in the cards. Of course, I'm sipping it in the throes of what I would call the first real summer day, so that may have an effect."
"D- Absolutely delicious, although, the sweetness might deter me from multiple samplings in a row. I will note, I crave this beer only one week later...."
"As a side note, I'm curious about the profiles here on the site. This beer has a distinct oak flavor and I'm left wondering if there's really an oak aged version of this beer that's different. I've got a hunch that this is the same beer. My bottle even indicates the abv is even higher on this one. Just throwing that out there. Carry on."
"Good complex brew."
"Pours a clouded brown with a thin eggshell toned head. Nose is definitely influenced by the maple syrup. Flavor is intense. A bit too much so I would have to say. Too tangy and sweet and a bit too vibrant. As it warms I can appreciate it a bit more. Still a bit too bright though. Feel has a fairly full carbonation to it and the liquid is thicker as well. A nice drinker, but probably not worth the coin."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beers body is medium and the carbonation is medium. The finish of the beer is dry. Alcohol is present in a boozey fashion. Ba says the beer is 7%; however, the label on the bottle states 9.5% Alc/vol. A nice beer to try everyonce in a while."
"I really like their Peche Mortel and heard this was released, so I thought I'd give it a shot. As the dark chesnut brown beer was poured into my imperial pint it formed a decent head but it disappeared quickly to traces. Not very much going on in the nose with this one, sweet maple and a malt aroma are about it. I found this to be under carbonated when I tasted it, but a smooth flavor is there. Honey or maple syrup up front, with caramel and fruits later. I did not find it to be overly sweet and syrupy as it could've been. Overall, it's not my favorite wee heavy/ scotch ale but I would have it again."
"M - Full bodied, viscous, light carbonation. Really substantial."
"Pours a cloudy reddish orange, thick white head forms, settles to a pretty solid layer, drops some nice lace spots, and it looks pretty good. Smell is quite sweet, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, some floral and fruit, honey, very fragrant, apples, almost a weizenbock type of aroma, some spice, quite nice. Taste is similar, very sweet and caramelized, apples, maple, brown sugar, very fruity, wheat, very bready, dry in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some warming, but pretty good stuff."
"drinkability is good. mostly balanced. a decent scotch ale, just nothing to wow me."
"Overall: A bit of an odd duck, this brew is fairly good. It would be something i would get once in a while and since it's a seasonal, then that's perfect."
"This was poured into a big Red wine glass and I must say the beer looked nice with a deep dark orange with a low broken head floating on top. The nose was Belgian and yeasty in form with a biscuity note that smelled like maple syrup pancakes. The taste was kinda like a refined Mcchouffe in that it was a Scotch/Belgium mix. The maple came out on the finish with a bit of residual sweetness which really smoothed the beer out. A very complex beer and wholly original in style."
"Enjoyed on-tap at Mondiale 2008. One of several maple offerings. Creamy orange colour with a bit of head. Aroma is malty and fruity. Taste is malt and alcohol, with tart fruit finish. White lacing. ABove average mouthfeel.Aged in wood, complex, a sipper that reminds me of an oaked barleywine."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy brown color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of light maple notes with some caramel malt. Taste is a mix between some medium sweetness with light maples notes and good caramel malt notes. Nice creamy body with good carbonation. I think this beer could have been improved with a more pronounce maple taste but still very good nonetheless."
"Quite a solid maple brew, but I feel it isn't in the top echelon of DDC beers."
"D- Above average sipping beer for a cold spring evening, which matches the weather as I write this. Good but a little unbalanced."
"Good appearance with an above Dieu Du Ciel's standards head. The aroma was not so pronounced, but still interesting, like entering a maple field in the spring. (Dieu du Ciel is really gifted at giving fitting names to their brews) I had a weird impression of Root beer as well. Malty taste, you can't get much sweeter, maple is dominant, hardcore even. Pure candy sugar with notes of vanilla. I'll have to try a fresh version. That one seemed a little unbalanced to me (1,75 yrs), aiming it all toward the maple taste. I actually prefered the impression left on me by the 2.75 yrs old one, but getting it on tap and fresh would certainly be interesting. Overall.. That's a scotch ale? An original one to say the least."
