The taste is sweet, salty and, at the same time, terribly bitter and sour and full of boiled peas.

It Looks a little thin for a Wee Heavy. I smell sweet sweet malts. I did not detect anymore than a faint hint of booze smell. I detect no hops which is to style. The first taste is thicker than expected. I taste sweet malts at first followed by roasted flavored malts and some booziness. I did detect some spicy after taste that could have been some hops for balancing but they have been washed out by the booze and malts. I thought Ol Red CAD would be sweet and this beer is just that. I liked it.. I do have to say this is another solid beer by Erie but I think this Wee heavy is a little to one sided to be a home run.
