Very smokey flavor, actually overwhelming. First impression was smoke and as strange as this may sound, pine tar. It has a taste reminiscent of what pine tar smells like. As I drank the beer I could discern the smell and it was identical to the flavor. This beer will not cross my lips in the future. I actually dumped the first bottle thinking it may have had something wrong with it. Next question, what do I do with the two remaining bottles from the 4 pack. Cheers!

Much of the richness and depth that I expect in the style are present, but blend together in such a way that sum of the part doesn't equal the whole...

Pours lightly hazy dark red amber color with a nice 1 finger fairly dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, toast, molasses, toffee, dark bread, peat, wood, light smoke, light chocolate, scotch, floral, and earthy spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, peat, wood, bread, light smoke, floral, scotch, and earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, molasses, bread, peat, floral, scotch, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors with some great complexity; with zero cloying sweetness present on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent scotch ale! Nice balance and great flavor complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one, very well done.","superspak","Dec 24, 2012"

Bubbly off-white head holds some retention and eventually fades to a thin layer of foam atop the ale. Not much for lacing on the glass. Aromas are earthy peat, faint roasted malt, with a musty yeast presence - kind of odd. Tastes are more interesting and actually quite complex - peat, mossy, earthy, smoky, and musty with vanilla and white pepper on the finish. This beer reminds me of something that would have come from my grandfather's basement - I remember it being dark and dank, but he did have a kick-ass bar/homebrew set-up down there! Anyway, back to the ale - mouth-feel is thin-to-medium bodied, with low carbonation. It's a bit boozy, but not overly. Overall, this is different than most Scotch Ales I've had, and I do like it. When I first smelled it, I wasn't expecting much but it is quite good actually.","barnzy78","Jan 24, 2012"
3.5,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The color of this Scotch ale is a deep, brownish copper with a thin but full near oatmeal colored head and modest lacing follows. The nose picks up thick caramel and alcohol vanilla, with the emphasis on booze (considerably more than I expected for 8.27% ABV). Fairly intense and not a lot more complex than I've described. The flavor jumps out with tart roasted malt and a scotch whiskey theme. The booziness remains pretty clear but maybe a little less dominant than the aroma brought. It's medium bodied but the feel is a bit on the thin side with pretty tingly carbonation throughout. It's very warming when it reaches its destination yet drinkability is fair. There's a subtle grassy edge in there with a little of the peat base that others have described, but the sweetness stays with the caramel ideas. Though this is not the most inviting Scotch ale I've had, it isn't too bad. I tend to think of this style as being at its best with a somewhat thicker body and feel and more malt dominated than this one offers. Still, worth a try though I would not revisit right away.","Durge","Jan 02, 2012"

4.01,13.9,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Little over a finger’s worth of tan to camel hair colored foam, poor retention with it swiftly fizzing down to not even a full surface covering, in turn the lacing is close to nonexistent. Dark reddish copper color with more brown than orange, no filminess but slight translucency, a few random bubble beads to be seen. The nose has a very smoky nature with peat moss, tar, metallic earth and mineral water notes, behind this wall you get caramel, vanilla, banana and butterscotch, some apple and pear fruit, the rambunctiousness of the smoke keeps it in the forefront. Full-bodied, the carbonation is average and there’s not a strong sense of movement, however, it never feels really “heavy.” This may be attributed in part to that smokiness, has a sweeter complexion with honey, mesquite, caramel notes. The peat qualities more part of the whole here, not as acrid. Still has a metallic rust ring to it, enough so to challenge the banana, peach, apricot, fig fruit flavors. Smattering of mixed citrus zest. Mouth feel gets drier as it finishes. This is a very interesting beer with some unique qualities, would show best with a cigar or a hearty meal like beef brisket.","farrago","0"

The mouthfeel lowers the score, because it is a bit thick, flat and grainy on the tongue. The carbonation is there, but it gets lost in the thickness. Drinkability is not high since it has such a high ABV and I'm not enjoying the flattish rinse down my gullet. I've had many Scotch ales, and I'd say this is average for the style. It lacks the syrupy quality of some, which for me is a plus. The alcohol is well hidden. The flavor is strong and well put together, but it lacks spark and well defined character.

Very delicious. I've said it before and I'll certainly say it again here--Sprecher does not get its due for making very good beer. Pipers is very good beer. Creamy and smooth if a tad thin, the mouthfeel could use more hops. Highly drinkable, this is one of the best offerings from Sprecher, which makes many good ones.

Toasted malts flow through to join unsweetened cocoa and just a hint of smoke in a lightly bitter finish. Herbal, tea-like, hops help smooth and balance the flavors. The body leans toward the light end of medium, yet retains enough carbonation to stay quite refreshing and drinkable. This is a nicely done version of the style.

While I would not categorize this as a heavy handed use of peat, I think this would be a much better for me if it had a bit less. Half this amount would still be quite noticeable, and even an 1/8 the amount that was used would add to the complexity of the base beer. While I don't quite think that this beer works, it is quite engaging, and quite contemplative; if the malt character were kicked up a notch (meaning bumping up the final & original gravities a corresponding amount through more malt used and a higher mash temperature) this beer would be quite a bit more enjoyable and even down right great.

No hop presence is noted yet which is great for a true wee heavy. Although nice smelling, there was room for so much more malt punch. The peat didn't come through in the nose yet for me....then there is the taste. The smokey, earthy, bacon-like malt definately shows up for the party. The crude, raw punch of true peat smoked malt is an acquired taste. For me, being vegetarian, it doesn't hit home and make me want some ribs, but I can appreciate the uniqueness of it. The malt seems a bit overshadowed by the smokiness. I would have loved it to be the other way around. A thick, sweet body is enjoyable to drink, but 16oz is enough for one sitting.
