"One finger tan leather head fades relatively quickly leaving little lacing. Dark mahogany, not cloudy. Roasted malty aromas with not much complexity. Has an almost peaty flavor pleasant some cocoa aftertaste. Highly carbonated and chewy. First sip seemed to fill mouth quickly. Feeling acidity linger on tip of tongue. Moderately syrupy. Seems to attack fast and linger mildly. A good beer with a medium body, and a good buy, once in a while."

"Cold Smoke is the perfect beer for every activity. Smooth yet refined."

"This is a tame Scotch Ale, in a very nice way. I've sampled it on tap and in cans - both are pleasant experiences. The smell is malted toffee, the taste includes a bit of coffee and the faintest peat sensations. The heavy alcohol content is completely masked in the desirable combination of flavours. This is a fantastic ski beer!"

"Overall, a good scotch ale with some of the peatiness I look for in this style."

"Overall: I'm not too impressed.  This tastes bland.  Maybe I was given an old can.  Hopefully I can revisit this beer in the future."

"Overall â€“ A very delicious scotch ale that has a more moderate abv. (at least for a scotch) but yet tons of great flavor.  A very nice on to try if you get the chance."

"This is a very drinkable Scotch ale that I've imbibed numerous times watching football on a chill autumn weekend at one of the local establishments. My only knock is that it's a little bland and could use some complexity. Maybe ramping up the smokiness just a smidge (not too much!), and a wee bit more bittering hops. In my area this beer sells for about $8.50 for a 4-pack of pint cans, which is very reasonable."

"A fine malt-forward beer loaded with light chocolate and caramel flavors."
"Smoke seems to come out with time but I would say it is balanced nicely by toasted malts and fairly strong yeast fruit notes. Drinks like a slightly smoked English Brown."

"loved cold smoke! this was a very generous gift from a man who frankly was far too busy with his wedding to remember this beer for me, but he did, a testament to his awesomeness and thoughtfulness, and it certainly did not disappoint. my first beer from these guys has me keen for more. a deep maple amber colored brew, not real heady, but some bubbles and a thin tan film are visible. radiant glow to it, real low, wintery looking, sturdy, and emitting amazing and enticing aromatics of birch syrup, soft smoke, oak, chocolate and specialty red malts, and just a hint of molasses sweetness. it tastes as good as it smells, maybe better, a very long flavor trip. it starts hearty and malty, but not sweet or as heavy as many. its also quite subtle with the smoke, very northern, alaskan or maine or something, rustic and woodsy, hair on the chesty stuff here, but the smoke is only one component of many. beautiful body, smooth and rich, but again only just sweet enough. ale yeast but with some lager properties, suggesting cold and slow fermentation and a patience for the process. truly one of the better and more sessionable american scotch ales I've encountered, and i am extremely thankful to the groom for remembering to share this with me on his big day. memorable."

"Dark mahogany pour with a quickly fading one finger beige head with minimal lacing. Really nice sweet, malty nose with hints of caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits, brown bread, molasses, and just a touch of cocoa. The taste follows suit with sweet roasty caramel malt up front along with hints of tobacco, brown bread, figs, subtle peaty smoke, toffee, vanilla, and cocoa. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly thick with perfect carbonation and great balance. Overall, one of the better interpretations of a Scotch Ale I've had. Very drinkable and flavorful."

"Chalky palate, sweet overall, but that mustiness is a little off putting. Pretty good overall I'd say."

"D: Easily drinkable, quite refreshing, and more on the sweet side for style. A solid offering. Thanks to Brad for bringing this one back!"
""
"A decently tasty scotch ale, kind of on the easy-drinking side of the style spectrum. I can see why this is a popular beer in its area, but I think a lot of what makes it more palatable makes it less exciting to me."

"o: a very nice scotch ale, nice complexity with the different aromas and flavors. the carbonation is too damn high!"
"poured into a pint glass, perfect pour with a nice amount of light tan head that went straight to the brim of the glass. beer color is more like a porter - deep amber/brown. smells of vanilla, oak, slight hint of fruit (overtone of grapes). tastes very smokey, malty, sweet chocolate, slight bitterness from hops (very faint but in the aftertaste). real smooth on the palate, a little creamy on the roof of the mouth.. goes down like a nice stout. this is very well balanced beer.. never thought i liked scotch ales until i had this (and the three floyds one). very nice."
"Overall, we were surprised that this one finished one or two for all of us. We've all had it a million times and we couldn't pick this one out of the two we thought it might be. This is a decent example of the style, worth drinking for sure."

"Got this beer from a friend who went to Montana. Pours with a nice white head that leaves nice bit of lacing. Not much retention. Aroma a bit of nice caramel and mild toffee. Flavor is mild. Does not have much of the caramel or toffee that is in the aroma. Very mild caramel and a bit of maybe roast? There is also a bit of herbal hops. Theres really not much going on. Mouthfeel is too light for the style and carbonation is too high. Overall this beer is nice, but definitely not a great scotch ale. I think another point or two of ABV and maybe a bit more body would have been helpful."

"D/O- Very impressed with my first Kettlehouse offering. May not in the top tier scotch ale conversation but very solid nonetheless. Thanks fdkayti!"
"The epitome of creamy. Like milkshakes and pudding all at once. Velvety smooth. Sticky flavor linger here and there but the finish isn't long lasting enough to really be a full level stickiness. Its a here...a....there...not everywhere. Really really like this beer. It makes me want to get more of their stuff. No jokes on that."

"Time waster. Drain + pour. Not remotely a Scotch Ale. I cannot believe the other reviewers were drinking the same product as I."

"Cold smoke is a damn good beer and an excellent example of a somewhat rare brew. In fact, I hadn't even heard of a Scotch ale (only Scottish Ales) until I did field work out in Yellowstone this summer (and brought this back). To me, this seems to be more balanced than the majority of brown ales (more hops), while still retaining an alluring sweetness. A better beer than Double Haul, and worth the $2.50 I paid for it within the park. I wonder what it can be had for on tap or at a more reasonable venue?"
"Overall its a good beer."
"This is a pretty strongly average scotch ale with some slightly above average features. The mouthfeel is certainly the weakspot on this one, thin and a tad flat with no appealing carbonation. There's a bizarre over-sweetness in the aftertaste on this and the heat comes through a little thick in the beginning. Balance is a big issue in this beer but overall it comes through with a sweet alcohol that is reminiscent of a classic scotch ale. Not bad to drink but also not that easy to give a flattering tick."
"Overall a smackable beer, not to sweet but brewed to the style. I would think most beer drinkers would enjoy a cold one of these!"
"O - A really good malt-forward beer that I would love to drink again the next time I'm in Montana."
"Cold Smoke hold a place in my heart as one of the best beers to have graced my tastebuds. Like the name, a pint dripping with sweat and crisp white head, leaves me dreaming of the a days turns in the seemingly never ending cold smoke of a fresh powder day-- and its August."
"Overall - would drink again but wouldn't seek out."
"O - This brew reminds me of being in Glacier National Park.... Awesome! Can't wait to go back and enjoy more of this fine brew. Definitely worth a try. I wouldn't hunt, but definitely seek. Great job Kettlehouse!"
"overall: nice - enjoyed this canned beer quite a bit"
"I guess I prefer, especially for this category, for the flavors to be a little more bold. Not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, just nothing that would make me go out of my way to get it again."
"Poured from 16 oz can a darker brown color with a tan head that stayed around a bit. Not exactly sure what the nose picked up but the taste was sweet malt, a touch of caramel, and an ever so slight bit of hop bitterness/bite at the end. Decent brew but I definitely prefer the Eddy Out over this one."
"Another one shared by schmittymack on Saturday evening; This one poured from the tall boy can a nice reddish brown color with a small lingering tan head. Aromas of toffee, dark fruit and a hint of smoke. On the palate this one was medium bodied, with flavors of caramel, toffee, sweet malt and a little smoke."
"Thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some malts present. Taste is good, lots of malts, some sweetness, hints of coffee, just a touch of hops. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"This Scotch Ale has a great look. It's a deep rich brown liquid with a creamy ecru head. The aroma is sweet with caramel and brown sugar. There's a touch of peat in there along with some dark fruits. The taste is a touch sweeter than I'd prefer, but it's still quite good. A little more smokiness would do wonders for this beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. It's a pleasant, enjoyable beer and I could imagine having it in regular rotation, especially for fans of the style. Good stuff."
"Nice flavor profile: somewhat mild, but clean and without any off-flavors. The dark malts suggest baker's chocolate, coffee, and a toasted nuttiness, and are well-balanced by an earthy, herbal hop presence. Mouthfeel is crisp and silky at the same time. The small bubbles of carbonation pepper the front & sides of the tongue, while still allowing the beer to finish with a velvety gulp. Quite a well-crafted Scotch Ale, this. Not the most flavorful or eye-opening of the bunch, but it drinks incredibly well for the style."
"Would I buy more of it? - hells yes. Great stuff in a great, big, awesome-looking can. Loads of malty goodness and just about perfect on a cold night in front of the fireplace."
"With the right price point I could see knocking back a few of these during a winter evening. Hopefully one day I'll end up in Montana to go skiing and make it happen."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to those seeking a solid scotch ale with a strong malt backbone with lingering coffee and roast malt profiles."
"drinkable - oh yeah. very."
"One easy-drinking scotch ale, no heat from the fortifying booze at all, which means that the name is at least half-right, the titular smoke being pretty ethereal."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Not overly heavy or high on ABV. This is the first Wee Heavy I've tried but it sets a pretty decent standard."
"Overall this was a nicely done scotch ale - very smooth and generous with different varities of malt flavors. Well worth a shot."
"Long time since I've had the pleasure of a Cold Smoke. Compared with a few other top-grade examples within the style, it could have a little more bulk. Nevertheless, a very nice, easy-drinking Scotch ale that is worth a trip to the Kettlehouse taproom if you are lucky enough to find yourself in Missoula."
"The body was typical and drinkability was slightly above average. Overall, a decent example, worth trying if you see it."
"My pour created two fingers' worth of bubbly, thick, light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep cola-brown with NE-quality clarity and ruby highlights. Nose was sweet, milk chocolaty, cocoa and coffee. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a more muted sweetness on the tongue than the nose had led me to expect. Finish had a coffee/cocoa flavor that lingered. This was nowhere near as sweet as I had girded myself to expect. I really enjoyed it, but its absence of noticeable hops made it less compelling than many American-IPAs would be for me."
"Spent a week in Missoula last September. Stopped in to the Kettlehouse Brewery and Tried this beer after being disappointed in their Bongwater porter (the name fits). I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Found this beer on tap most everywhere we ate on tap. The only other Wee Heavy I'd had was an Import from Scotland. This beer comes damn close!"
"A strong offering from the folks up in Montana. Not as good as Old Chub, but still very tasty. Love seeing craft beer in cans."
"the drinkability and mouthfeel are both good the ale is really smooth and a little thick"
"Appearance is rather ordinary, nothing to make you go wow, but a typical looking scotch ale. This beer however delivers in superior taste and drinkability. At 6.5 abv this drinks like a 4.5. A great Scotch Ale, and very good entry beer for those wanting to sample different styles without taking a big risk."
"D-Tasty stuff, this alone could let me down multiples! I like the smoked elements plus the sweetness is not overwhelming....a fault I see in many scotch ales. This is a well crafted and tasty brew, from a can no less! Give it just a bit more body and round out the smoothness and this could become a world beater!"
"Drinkability- Not bad at all. Not as sweet as expected as most scotch ales I have had have been. Smooth mouthfeel makes is very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Not a bad lil' scotch ale, though I could stand and would appreciate a ramped up peaty smokiness."
"Drinkability: Great. I have found a new favorite Scotch ale, one that should be the keystone to which the style is interpreted. Peaty, malty, and creamy, not to mention that it comes in a can. Very nice."
"This is a really approachable, broad pleasing kind of beer. I think it would be tasty with lots of different kinds of foods. If you can find it, give it a try."
"The pint went down easier then most anything I've ever drank. I've had glasses of warm milk at bedtime give me a rougher time. Too bad I only had one can. Time to hit the trading forums. :)"
"I have 1 more in the cellar.. I will probably keep it for a rainy day.. but you never know.. Cold Smoke is one of those beers that I really like to share with friends."
"Drinkability- This is a very easy drinking, pretty tasty brew. IÂ’d drink this regularly if it was available to me. It sort of reminds me of SurlyÂ’s Bender without all the big flavor. Like itÂ’s little brother. Thanks again to JohnGalt1!"
"Drinkability - I want to buy a plane ticket to Missoula so I can access this beer continually. I fear it'll be far too long until this rare treasure passes my lips again."
"I could drink one or two of these, but I need my hops and this is a good one to have between a couple of hoppy beers to cleanse the palate as you will."
"Draught @ Big Sky: This one pours a ruby tinged brown color. It has a fairly decent frothy off white head on it, but it doesnÂ’t last too long. A bit of a roasted, sweet malt to the nose, as well as some smokiness. I didnÂ’t really get any peat out of it, as I might expect in a scotch ale. A good medium body and flavor. Mainly the sweet roasted malts that were in the aroma, as well as some of the smokiness. Some lurking hops for balance, but fairly hidden. Decent!"
"D: Very flavorfull, would have tasted better on a nice cold winter day. Very good beer nonetheless."
"This dark scotch ale was not as impressive as the others at the brewery. The roasted malt was paired with a fruity hop character.  The brew was light and refreshingâ€¦a little too light and refreshing for a style of ale that was probably created to impart the need in man to throw objects in many different ways for sport or war."
