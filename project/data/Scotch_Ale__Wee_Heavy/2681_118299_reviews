"What a gem this is so smooth its hard to stop drinking great scottish ale almost a stout so creamy when you pour and drink"
"Flavor is very caramelly, slightly sweet, dark fruity, woody, and smoky, with a dry finish. Lacks depth of malt presence, and that might be due to the nitro. Seems hollow."
"By far one of my favorite stouts, Old Chub Nitro is a refreshing and smooth ale. The aroma is soft and nutty, with a delicate yet rich initial blast. The feel is extremely smooth with a lower carbonation than many of my preferred beers, but it compliments the softness of the flavor. As for the overall taste, it's nutty and not too dry. Many describe it as caramelly and chocolatey, but I'd personally describe it as a soft oaky flavor. The nitrogen widget makes it taste just like it's off tap, which enhances the refreshing nature of the beer. Overall, a great beer to experience."

"o: I don't usually have nitro beers aside from the occasional Guinness. This was a treat if even to just look at. I am assuming the nitro is what made it less Scotch aleish though?"
"Overall: Satisfying Scotch ale; smooth nitro body if relatively light."
"Very smooth scotch ale. Flavor just a bit lacking though good."
"Really enjoyed the nitro touch over regular chub"

"Great tasting Scotch Ale, I love regular old chub, on Nitro makes it 10x better!!"
""
"Overall, this is a fine beer. It goes down easy, and satisfies. One of the best Scotch Ales I've tried. Once again, Oskar Blues puts a premium product in a handy aluminum can."
""
""
""
"Overall: whatevs ... might never get it again.  Bought 8 total.  The first one was great but I grew sick of it."
""
"Luxurious mouthfeel, this a a rich and hearty beer. The taste however, leaves something to be desired; it is to soft, to unassuming. Scotch Ales may not be the most agrressive style, but even with the considered this beer seems a bit apologetic."
""
""
""
""
"Nitro version seemed to scrub taste from original OC"
""
""
"F: Light body for a dark nitro like this, but medium body overall."
""
"Overall:  easy:  good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: Everyone should try this beer. It is a Scotch Ale which isn't even close to a stout  but I compare it to Guinness which is of course the world standard for a stout. That is quite the compliment for this relatively new brewery in Colorado so I would surely recommend this one."
""
"O: An interesting spin on the regular version that doesn't really add or detract in any major ways (aside from the mouthfeel, obviously). Solid drinkability and great flavors going on within the waves of malt and layers. You'll want to try this if you're a fan of the regular and scotch ales in general, just for the distinct nitro treatment"
""
""
"Nice smooth even taste, the nitro is better than the regular old chub."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed this greatly but I was disappointed that it wasn't scottish enough."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tawny brown color with that micro bubbled tan head that is typical of a nitrogenated beer. Sweet caramel and dark fruity aromas with a touch of smoke in both the aroma and flavor. Nice brew."
""
""
""
"When you pour this beer (I opted for the straight into the glass nitro pour) you get the cascading Nitro effect with a deep Tan/Brown Colour. Once the thick head rises up, it's a dark Brown Beer with deep Ruby around the edges with a Tan coloured head. On the nose, lots of Caramel, some Woody tones and a little smoke. Great smelling for such a malt forward brew, you can really pick up on the caramalisation. When tasting this beer, there's an initial wave of Caramel, followed by hard Toffee and Fudge. Wood and a light Smokiness carry through the Palate. On the finish there's a little Tea aftertone, which is quite nice. As this beer is Nitro, it's insanely smooth and almost coats your throat. Light carbonation and a Sweet finish."
"Overall - The lack of carbonation allows the smokiness to shine though, something I ha not noticed before with the regular old chub.  Old Chub is one of my favorite Wee Heavies, and the Nitro version is quite tasty, but I can't say it enhances the beer at all.  4 paws."
""
""
""
"The nitro seems to lessen the flavors a notch, a little disappointing imo.  Good but nothing superb as I'd hoped."
""
"At $2.99 a can makes a decent treat or ""crown jewel"" on that leisure game of disc golf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer to have on nitro. Solid flavors and a creamy smooth mouthfeel."
""
"O:  Think I'll stick to the regular Old Chub from now on.  A great taste either way, but nitro takes all the punch out."
""
""
"I was disappointed by this beer... Looked nice out of the can, from there it was underwhelming."
""
"Old Chub is already a fun beer, but on Nitrogen, it just raises the bar. Although I feel there is a little loss on the palate as far as the peaty character, I think the velvety body more than makes up for it. Top notch craft beer in my humble opinion."
""
"A lot of things going on here that are very average"
""
""
""
"not a fan of this"
""
""
"Overall this is a nice representation of the style."
""
""
""
"T: A light smoky and nuttiness to it. Very grounded with limited sweetness. Roast chocolate, mildly bitter. Caramel macchiato and peanuts sans any sweetness. This just seems bland too me."
""
"O: Very drinkable for 8%, but missing some bite that I've come to expect from Scotch ales. Still a solid brew though."
""
""
""
"Overall impression:  A pleasant and unique slant on this classic beer.  I think the nitro mutes the wonderful character of the normal version of this beer but hard to tell without a side-by-side.  Still, this is well done and immensely enjoyable."
""
"Beautiful burgundy body with wet sand cascading down as the head settles to a one inch layer of dense khaki cap. Sweet, fruity caramel malt, light spice. Brown bread and malty sweetness with a hint of dark fruits. Nice wee heavy character. Silky smooth body, as is customary with the nitro serving medium. Solid."
""
"Everything I like from Old Chub with a really nice nitro smoothness.  Absolute quality."
""
""
""
""
"The perfect winter ale. Scotch ales like this are warming, sweet and delicious. This one drinks like a session ale. Hits like a velvet boxing glove."
"Overall, I am a big fan of Old Chub, but the nitro carbing gives it a supremely smooth mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a dense, creamy light tan head. Tons of lacing. Smells of caramel, earth, smoke and roast malt. Smoky malt taste. Creamy sweetness. Peat and smoky malt. Incredible creamy mouth feel. Semi-thick. Regular Old Chub is good, but the Nitro takes this to another level."
"O: Highly enjoyable, if you're into nitro beers. I will seek out the normal version."
"A little too sweet for me"
"A curious choice to apply the ol' nitrogen gas treatment to, I guess it's still keeping it in the Celtic tribe, and all that.  Anyways, some the edginess of the base beer is basically shorn off, rendering this actually more drinkable.  Huh - new-fangled technology, and how we got to here, eh?"
""
"It's a good thing I had my Guinness pint glass in hand, because the second I popped the top on the chilled can it exploded with gushing foam. Several ounces were laid to waste as they spilled over the sides before I could even attempt to pour it. Wow. What was left in the wake of the explosion was a pint glass full of stubborn off-white foam. It just lingered forever, with amazing retention. The foam served as a barrier to the deep, dark brown liquid beneath it. By the time the whole can was poured and ready to drink, the temperature had warmed significantly. Not that I minded, but it was a little annoying to sop up spilled beer and wait 15 minutes to take the first sip. The can says the nitro widget could cause unchilled cans to overflow. Well, this one came straight from the fridge so I don't know what went wrong here. However, once I tried the beer, everything was right! Although tamer than the standard version, it still produced a nice malty, sweet ale with negligible bitterness. There were hints of smoked peat and caramel, but much more subdued than its predecessor. Unsurprisingly, where it really shined was in the mouthfeel. Exceptionally smooth and creamy. The combination of subtler flavors and enhanced body made this extremely refreshing. Gulpable in fact. In the land of nitro-widget cans this is king. Compared to its non-nitro brother, this one is the smooth, mellow fellow. However, it packs more than enough punch (in both the ABV and flavor department) to be its own man. That said, it's more of a textural experience. If velvety smooth, creamy mouthfeel and subdued scotch ale flavors are your bag, you will fall all over yourself for this beer. If you want the strong scotch ale experience, then you might want to stick with Chub's older, bolder brother. This one could definitely get me in to trouble. I could crush can after can of these things."

"V - Four pack of tall-boy cans. Good value."
""
""
"By far one of my current (all time) favorite brews. Damn it is good."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer, also called New Chub on tap, is excellent.  It takes the slap-you-around quality of Old Chub and really mellows and smooths it out, thanks to the addition of the nitro.  Definitely grab this one if you see it; you will be very pleased."
""
"One of my favorites, smooth, wonderful taste."
"Mouthfeel is very creamy (nitro helps here), rich and with a little alcohol ""burn"".  Overall a good winter beer.  Tasty."
""
""
""
""
"o: Good enough as a Scotch ale, but virtually unsurpassable in appearance and mouthfeel in Nitro!  Looks perfect, tastes as smooth as you could ever imagine a beer could be.  I'll be buying this as long as it is around!"
"The Crack! also caused a Hiss! as the widget energized itself and due to it being a tall boy as well as an N2 CAN, I could not undertake an inverted Glug. Instead, I fired some into the glass and sat back in amusement as the cascade took place. I would up with a finger of dense, light-tan head with excellent retention. Color was Brown to Dark Brown (SRM = > 22, "
""
""
""
""
"Not as malty as i had hoped. Alittle watered down. Looked a nice brown with a luxurious head. Very smooth with the Nitro but i think i prefer CO2 carbonation more as it's livelier on the tongue. It seemed flat being so smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked this one; because of the mouthfeel it basically reminded me of a better Guinness. Worth checking out for sure."
""
""
"I enjoy the Belhaven Draught can and This does the style justice."
"Overall - Love what's there in the flavor profile, but as others have noted, it seems a bit watered down, especially in the finish. Too bad, because this one could be a monster. Odd considering it comes in at 8%."
""
"Same thoughts on this as the original Old Chub, yet the taste is smoothed out and the mouth feel is just pure silky luxury with the biggest creamiest head I have ever seen from a nitro can with astounding suspended lacing.  Very enjoyable for the style and the BEST nitro infused ale I have EVER had bar none.  Most excellent.  Try Old Chub, THEN try the nitro....it is EXCELLENT!"

"I want to like this beer, because I really respect Oskar Blues and love everything else they brew, but I cannot get behind this one.  The mouthfeel is very watery and the taste sweet and cloying.  It's similar to how I remember the non-nitro version.  I thought I needed to try the nitro version, but it was a bad idea.  If you want a great example of this style, have a Skull Splitter from Orkney, Founders Backwoods Bastard, or McEwan's Scotch Ale.  I honestly have no idea how Old Chub is rated higher than McEwan's."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: nice sweetness followed by toasted malt flavors.  Not much hoppy flavors.  Everything is balanced and easy to drink"
""
"Old Chub is one of my favorite beers, so perhaps my rating is driven by expectations.  I also don't know much about nitro beers (yet), but I think this one is less flavorful, has a worse mouthfeel, seems watered down, and, on the whole, is a poor imitation of the original."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black color.  3/4 inch head of an off-tan color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of hop, hint of yeast, and dry malt.  Fits the style of a Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy.  Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of hop, hint of yeast, and dry malt.  Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, great feel, and average complexity."

"Very dark brown in color with very little light passing through. It retains some head throughout.  I had some trouble identifying a particular smell other than the alcohol, which I felt slightly masked other aromas.  It was very smooth in the mouth and had little carbonation (somewhat flat).  An overall enjoyable beer that I would certainly drink again, but not one I would be hunting around after."

"11/9/2014. 16 oz nitro version can purchased at Chuck’s Greenwood, poured into an ale glass. Pours with a thick, dense, creamy head. Mahogany colored and somewhat cloudy. Aroma is of roasted malt, biscuits, a bit of raisin and fig. Sweet flavor, with a slight amount of bitterness and sourness. Creamy and full bodied, light carbonation and a fairly quick finish. This beer most certainly IS still being brewed, and I hope they continue to do so."

"Overall, a classic beer, where all the components are excellently harmonized... I'd like to get some of the regular Old Chub to do a comparison sometime.  In the meantime, I should definitely like to get my hands on more of this before it goes out of production again. Between this and the Ten FIDY Russian Imperial Stout (review coming in the future) Oskar Blues is definitely carving out a place as one of my favorite breweries."

"Overall: This is simply delicious, and the nitro can has everything to do with it."
"Pours a very dark brown with a huge, frothy foam head. Excellent retention. No visible lacing at this point. Nose is nutty, with some lightly roasted chocolate and coffee. Tastes of creamy goodness. The nuttiness is still there, but now there is the presence of very sweet caramel malts and dark fruits. Very sweet, has a smoky taste as well. The creamy sweetness is definitely my favorite thing about this beer. Despite the higher ABV, the sweetness and creaminess makes this one rather easy to drink, although it does leave the mouth a bit dry. Honestly, I'm not super well versed in nitros or Wee Heavy, but this is an okay beer. Not the greatest for either style."

"The pour and cascade were wonderful, and the mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy, but the malt flavors don't pop like I would have hoped.  Maybe it will be better on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's hard to say if I prefer this to regular Old Chub -- time and place for both, I suppose, and it depends on what I'm in the mood for. Standard Old Chub is cheaper per ounce, but this is still a nice beer well worth a purchase if you can find it."
"O - I prefer this to the original. Very smooth and easy drinking."

"Very creamy taste and wonderful thick moutfeel, but the overall taste had flattened out from what I expect to find in an Old Chub.  If I had never had the regular Chub, I'd probably be more or less satisfied with the Nitro version.  Certainly, Old Chub Nitro is superior to Guinness with nitro cans, but I don't find it superior to non-nitro Old Chub."

"A virtual planetoid with rare girth."
""
""
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a dark brwon color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, dark fruits. Taste is good, dark fruits, malts, bready, easy drinking for the abv. Feels smooth and creamy in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
""
""
"Drank it from the can and like the original it tasted of roasted to just about burnt malt, cocoa, toffee, caramel, toasted grains, light vanilla, coffee grinds, syrup, light rum, dark fruit, peat moss and alcohol like this was aged in a wine barrel. The alcohol was very mild and as it warmed up it got more complex and tasty; the smoky notes tamed the general sweetness and the nitro made it flow down like a chocolate milk that was very enjoyable. High drinkability, this went down a lot easier than it should have for an 8% ABV brew and I really enjoyed this nitro version."

"Already a fan of Old Chub, nitro made it better. So smooth, awesome poor and mouth feel, no weird flavor sticking out. Highly drinkable."
""
""
"I like regular Old Chub much more than Old Chub Nitro. The craftsmanship on this beer is very nice, but the nitro just brings it down overall, in my opinion. It's ultimately solid, but it doesn't match up to the original."
""
"As the beer warms up, the caramel comes out more to dull down that upfront bitterness. Highly recommend bringing this up from fridge temperature. Even then, that upfront bitterness is the major detractor of this beer."

"This beer pours from the can into a marshmallow fluff thickness, brown sugared colored head. The head separates into a day old coffee colored beer that sinks below a sandy beach colored head. First sniff smells of burnt molasses and sourdough pretzel. Later sniffs smell nutty as well. The initial taste of this beer is apple vinegar. As the taste lingers the molasses joins in. Tobacco is another flavor evident in the developing flavors. These flavors fade into a lingering aspirin bitterness. All of this is accompanied by a slippery, unset gelatin mouth feel. This is a cold night, cigar smoking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoy regular Old Chub so I picked up a 4 pack of the nitro cans. The nitro does add some extra dimensions to the taste and feel but is somewhat short-lived. Very easy drinking for a pretty strong beer."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but still pleasant. Overall the beer is an absolute winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a nitro can into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark, ruby-brown coloring, with a dense, creamy, light tan head that doesn't move while you drink. This pours with a great cascade, too. Pretty to watch. Aromas of rich caramel, toffee, nut, and cream highlights. Very rich and creamy sweet nose. Flavors are richly sweet forward, with a heavily roasted and sugary caramel base, rich toffee, and cream highlights. Velvety smooth and light in mouth, with a roasted and sweet aftertaste, with hints of underlying bitterness. Smooth, creamy linger in the light, clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a deep ruby brown and almost no light gets through. There is a nice thick and creamy tan head that lasts throughout and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is on the mild side, with some nice dark fruits and a little earthy angle to it. The taste is big roast malt, with light hints of burnt sugar and again a little earthy hops feeling. There is a great silky quality to the body with a little tingle on the tongue from the alcohol. A great use of nitro to make a really good beer even better."
"The tangy dryness is gone. You still get the brown sugars, but this a more like a weak brown ale left too long in the can. It mashes all the high notes and rye like qualities the regular pour has and makes them overly sweet and smooth. I think the Nitro cans have robbed the flavors the regular can has. Too bad, had high hopes for a favored beer of this style."
""
""
""
"The 8% is dangerously absent in the taste, which could lead to errors in judgement. Be forewarned."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm generally not a fan of nitro beers. It makes for a good mouthfeel, but I feel that it dumbs a beer down in the flavor department. In this case, it smooths Old Chub over in all the right areas. Sweetness is played up a bit, but the smokey edge is rounded off. I actually prefer this to the carbonated version. It's just that much more drinkable."
""
"I would be hard pressed to identify this as a wee heavy in a blindfold test. I'd probably guess milk stout. Doesn't have the flavor profile of a traditional scotch ale at all. No fruity notes, smoke or peat, zero booze. Nonetheless I really liked this. I have always had a soft spot for nitro cans and this one is amongst the best I've ever had. Fun to drink, more flavorful than anticipated, and just all-around pleasing to the senses. I'll be back for more. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The taste goes more toward the malts with sweetness and a lingering bitterness at the end. Very nicely done."

"I love a Nitro. Most Nitro's, for me, will bring out a bit more of the flavor and complexity. The Old Chub is a great Scotch Ale, but the Nitro version seemed a bit more dulled down. Poured great. Great head retention. Dark Amber, almost Brown color. But all the caramel and maltiness and big flavor that kicks you in the throat with the Old Chub, is still present, but a lot more subdued in the Nitro; disappointing, if that's what you were looking forward to, but could be a good thing if you were looking for the ABV and flavor, but wanted a smoother drinking experience. Overall, just as with the Old Chub, your fondness for this beer will grow exponentially as you near the end."

"O: I *LOVE* regular Old Chub, and this one - while still very tasty - doesn't quite hit the same peaks as the base beer does. On the other hand, it's more drinkable. An interesting idea at the end of the day (and, in fairness, the nitro makes this one more approachable), I just think the regular version is superior."
""
"Overall: I think this is on the money, its not a favorite style for me, but I really did enjoy this beer, maybe I should try more. When the weather cools down. Right now we are in lager and IPA season."
"A nice offering but not as good as the regular in my opinion. A tad too sweet and overly rich. It gets better as it warms, but still a long slow sipper, due in part to the high abv. A bit sticky in the feel but nicely full bodied anyway. I'd have again but I prefer the regular a bit more."

"Poured from pint can into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted July 2014."
""
"Overall: Stick with the standard carbonation version."
"Overall: A pretty good take on a Scotch ale. The nitro adds a lot of cream without burying the malt notes too much."

"Yeah, I'd definitely have this again, and I'd definitely say it's an upgrade from the regular Old Chub."
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable but not sure that the nitro really adds a lot of difference to the brew... Possibly a slightly lighter and creamier mouthfeel and a few more hints of sweetness come through but this is a hard beer to improve upon as it is quite good in the original form/packaging. Alcohol is fairly well hidden."
""
""
""
""
"Old Chub is probably my go to beer. Okay, it is definitely my go to. Cheap, super tasty and a style I love. So I had to try the nitro version when I saw it. Appearance is perfect. Smell is also excellent. The taste is also dead on, very smooth. Although I love the appearance of the nitro, I am not sure if it has any distinct advantage over the regular old chub which can be found at a great price."
""

"O: A really tasty beer, overall. The nitro makes a marked improvement over an already solid Scotch ale."

""
""
""
""

""

"Overall, the nitro gimmick dumbs down the old chub. The widget helped the nitro head, but not much of a cascade and made it more subdued and watery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Personally, I think the nitro boost distracted from this beer. It made it a bit too smooth and creamy. I remember this one from the variety pack before it was Nitrod and the overall appeal of this Scottish ale was better."
"Overall this was an upgrade of regular chub! Ima seek this one out whenever it hit - this beer is a homerun right over the short porch -"

"For me, the nitro does wonders for this beer. I normally don't appreciate Scotch ales, but this one on nitro is worth my time."

"This is a fantastic beer, and I feel the nitro format vastly improves upon the regular Old Chub."

"16oz. can served in a tulip nonic. Pour is beautiful and cascading - cola-colored in hue and opaque in clarity with a tight, creamy, one-inch, cafe-au-lait colored head. Head eventually settles into a consistent, quarter-inch cap. A few residual spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose very much subdued but there's a hint of something vinous mixed in with a trace of cocoa and an earthy/roasty malt profile. Taste consistent with nose with perhaps a suggestion of lactose and a trace of something metallic. Mouthfeel of this beer is wonderful; light-medium in body with a creamy/silky texture. Overall, the mouthfeel on this beer is outstanding, but I have to say that I prefer the standard over the nitro - the nose and flavors all come off a bit dull and underwhelming."
