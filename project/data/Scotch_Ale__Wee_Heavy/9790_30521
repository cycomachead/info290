The greater surface area means that the head does not rise as high, but I still got a finger of dense, light-tan head for my efforts. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = > 22, < 27), allowing for little light penetration. Nose had a toffee-like candy sweetness underlain with alcohol heat. Ah, an 8%er to begin the day ... Mouthfeel was thick and full and I felt like I had placed a dollop of cream on my tongue. The taste was quite sweet, very much like toffee, but with dried dark fruits, also, plus the heat was not lost on me. Phew! This is no playing around. As I watched the lacing begin to form a ring around the inside of the goblet, I was given pause to consider the prevalence of AIPAs and my propensity for drinking them. I really enjoy their bitter, citrusy flavors, but it is also nice to partake of a malt-driven beer on occasion. The finish was malty-sweet, certainly, but the fusel alcoholic heat on the extreme finish gave it a breathtaking dryness. My my my.","woodychandler","Jun 29, 2014"

3.58,-8.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Duck Rabbit Wee Heavy pours a clear maroon with plentiful cherry highlights. Maybe two fingers of khaki colored foam forms on top of the beer. Head retention is just OK, but lacing is left stuck to the glass in good sized chunks. The nose is fairly one dimensional, but what's there is a nice blend of caramel and brown sugar. Similarly, I wish the flavor profile was a bit more varied. Some nutty or light chocolaty malty notes or a touch of fruity esters from the yeast would really liven things up, but it's all caramel and brown sugar, all the time. The mouthfeel is nice for the style, with a full body and subtle carbonation. Duck Rabbit's Wee Heavy is an alright beer, but it's one of the least impressive from a brewery who puts out a lot of beers that I enjoy.","axeman9182","Mar 23, 2012"

The nose comprises caramel, lightly toasted toffee, light Belgian candi sugar, and an underlying suggestion of dark, earthy, spinach-y greens. The taste follows suit, though now everything comes off a touch sweeter, save the greens, which now come off fruiter, figgier. Some mild maple syrup seems to bubble up in some spots in the back. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth, generally creamy feel. Overall, a pretty nice wee heavy, though one that just pleasantly satisfies: it doesn't really impress. I'd take another, but not excitedly.","TMoney2591","Feb 27, 2012"

The flavor says bright, tart lemon rhubarb with a juniper malt that rolls over the tongue with a medium body and slightly viscous feel. The tart dominates but mellows nicely offering more of the peaty malt as it warms. It’s got medium drinkability, medium body, and plenty of tingly carbonation.

4.12,5.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Finger plus head of creamy foam, full tan color with a light orange tint, dissolves until it reaches a steady thick coating across the surface, no lack of sticky grip to the sheets of lacing. Deep amber color, about equally red and orange, utmost clarity to the liquid, good scattering of bubbles throughout, brighter zinc orange at the glass bottom. Fairly boozy nose, leans on caramel, honey, brown sugar and candied orange peels for effect, mild dried fruit concentration to the peach, apricot, apple fruit scents, almond with a hint of cashew, over time a herbaceousness grows to the fore with supporting earthiness. Medium-bodied, the high activity of the carbonation increases its mouth presence, muscular. The sweetness of the caramel, molasses, cocoa and butterscotch packed into the mouth entry, dries out into semi-sour orange and white grapefruit citrus as well as a pinch of pepper. The apricot, peach, nectarine, apple fruit comes with notes of golden raisin and fig too. Peat, hay and charcoal dry it out a touch more. It wears its complexity with ease and comes close to convincing you it's not even that complex. For its burly demeanor, good drinkability. Needs a heaping of beef brisket and potatoes.","farrago","Feb 19, 2011"

Aroma picks up dried fruit notes of apricot, pear, prune, and apple skins with touches of caramel, brandy, and sourdough malts. Flavor is silky, slightly sweet notes of toffee and smoked malts coming through in front of fruity notes of apple, raisin, and fig with a dry, slightly warming brandy essence on the swallow.

Again sweet dry tartness is reminiscient of dry apple cider big malty layers leave a layer of dirty dryness like apple skins compared to other flavors.

There is a large variety of cooked sugar characteristics that create warmth and complexity.

There is a sweet malt with aforementioned dark fruits and liquor flavors. The alcohol seems to be higher than it really is in this. This may or may not be a bad thing.

I tried their barleywine last week, for instance, and it was loaded to the brim with light fruity esters and tons of darker overtones. I suppose it could also be a quality control issue, but I'm gonna give 'em the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, this one's a good one - despite the spicy alcohol notes and intense sweetness - and give it a try if you can find it.

The taste ends with an almost lactic twang in the background. Its not real pronounced, but its there. This bottle has been aged a bit so there's no telling when it got there.

The taste was quite sweet, as is the norm for the style, with the sugary and chewy body reminding me of cake. The dense beer caressed and coddled my tongue and throat, as it went down.

Flavor is sweet upfront, ample berry fruitiness in the middle, and gets a bit harsh with the booze in the close. Mouthfeel is a bit rocky, and drinkability suffers the same fate.

Tasty, goes down easily, not as filling as most in the style, good representation of style, it’s a good beer to drink a few of, but I don’t think it’s one where I could great deal of for two reasons: it’s on the heavy side (even within the style) and it’s kick seems pretty significant (despite being listed at 8.00%). However, overall, it’s still a very good beer.","TheManiacalOne","Sep 26, 2007"

Huge malt body hits with a mild hop profile. Alcohol present through to the finish but warming and pleasing. A very slow roll in the mouth thickens it up. This also releases ome piney flavors. Alcohol still present but this is still complex with: malt, fruit, hops, butterscotch. I think i am getting some wood or peat smoked flavors somewhere, yes, definitely. A bit earthy.

There is a hint of a warming alcohol in the finish. The balance in this beer is outstanding. There is a hop presence that is both slightly drying in the finish and also slightly peppery on the tongue midway thru a taste that balances the rich maltiness.

The aroma is very malty, with big caramel notes, and a light phenolic note, but not really smokey as I would have expected. Taking a sip, I find caramel and a lighter chocolate malt flavor, with the phenolic character coming through more like a smokeyness, but still not exactly what I was expecting. It is a slight bit astringent on the finish as well. This one is okay. The feel is thick with a moderate carbonation hanging on there. Overall, I think this one is just not quite there for a scotch ale. The flavors are not well melded, and the aftertaste that hangs on is a little off-putting for me.

It pours a brilliant, crystal-clear crimson/blood red with medium carbonation and a thin, fleeting tan head that leaves light lacing, but aggressive swirling manages to work up a finger of head that recedes more slowly. In the nose it starts with caramel and molasses malts, but becomes earthy and almost sugary sweet with some esters and light hops. It is big and earthy on the palate, with peat, toasted, and caramel/molasses malts, a touch of smoke, light green hops, faint alcohol, and raisins that show up halfway through. It has a big chewy body that is almost syrupy, lightly numbing, and has a medium finish that reveals notes of currant and blackberry.

The flavor again starts off with caramel and molasses sweetness, followed by complex dark fruits (dates, figs, plum and grape), peat smoked malt, some slight floral hops, oak, vanilla and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with light carbonation; drinkability is good. A very nice offering from Duck-Rabbit, certainly a welcome addition to their lineup of fine beers.","silver0rlead","May 14, 2006"
