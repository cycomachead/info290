The taste is more of the same, as fully toasted malts finish with dark caramels balanced by just enough hops to eliminate any cloying but also not make it bitter.  It also softens up a bit as it warms in the glass, adding touches of toffee and lighter caramels.  This is one fine beer.","BuckeyeSlim","Oct 08, 2014"

Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, cherry, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown bread, nuttiness, chocolate, cocoa, light smoke, leather, tobacco, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, cherry, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown bread, chocolate, cocoa, smoke, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, cherry, caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown bread, chocolate, cocoa, smoke, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/roast/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and moderately slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Scotch ale! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and moderate fruity yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An extremely amazing offering.","superspak","Jul 19, 2014"

4.01,-3.6,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"nice take on a scotch ale, less peaty and smoky than many out there, this is driven by malt sweetness rather than earthiness, but retains some of the quintessential characteristics of the style. dark brown amber color, dense looking, without a short lived tan head. a nose of sweet musty grain, caramel malt, brown sugar, and smoke. the taste isn't that sweet though, only a little in the finish when it warms up and the booze comes out to play a little bit. its not as full bodied as i like mine to be, but it helps this drink pretty easy. a beer that almost demands food. smoked meats, cured meats and cheeses, even bread pudding all leap out at me as foods that this beer was made for. well hidden abv for the most part too. well made bottle, a must share though at this strength and density.","StonedTrippin","Feb 01, 2014"

3.67,-11.8,4.5,3.75,3.5,4.5,3.25,"O - AleSmith has created one of the most interesting and personally conflicting beers in Wee Heavy; on one hand their ability to completely downplay the amount of alcohol this beer contains is quite incredible; it's barely even HINTED at! On the other hand, the subtle nature of the malt profile shows serious promise but, with each sip, I wonder where the flavor's run off to. Deep complexity is one thing but to have next to no stand-out flavor at all is another. I would expect some forward sweetness...at least something; all the characteristics seem to hide in the shadows unfortunately. It leaves me feeling that the only reason I might reach for this beer again would be to down something high in alcohol with little temperament; not a sugar bomb, not super bitter, just...there.","BeerFMAndy","Dec 29, 2013"

It almost tastes oxidized in a way but this is super fresh (just came into the store last week). Fairly smoky and peaty too which I generally don't like too much. I was kind of torn on the scoring as I didn't like some of the flavors but it also has a lot of good flavors as well as the complexity and balance. The smoke and peat seems in-line with the style so it's hard to take away points for that either. Tough one to score. I did not enjoy this one at all, however.","Dope","Oct 12, 2012"

I love the creamy mouthfeel the beer presents, I find myself 'mmmm'-ing to myself more and more as it warms despite the lack of smokiness I love so much in a wee heavy. The alcohol is sooo smooth and gentle! The best way I can describe this would be a blend of Old Chub and Belhaven Wee Heavy with more alcohol and complexity.

It also has a strange and faint red wine like aftertaste. I would rate this so much higher if not for the sweetness. God damn it's sweet. This one drinks far too light for what it should. It is creamy, like the Speedway, but in an overly thin manner. What the deuce! Overall I'd describe this as a sweet and flavorful malt bomb.

This beer pours out as a very deep reddish brown color. Much darker than I thought it'd be. The head on it was a very light tan color with a pretty decent lacing. The smell of the beer had some really nice earthy aromas mixed with some dark sugary fruit aromas too. The taste was good, it's had a really nice malt backbone to it, it's on the sweeter side but it's subtle not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is very smooth and had a pretty good thickness to it.

4.17,0.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"for something with such a high abv a scotch ale that doesn't have a syrupy malt quality and still has a broad latitude that is not compromised. The feel is spot on for the style. Nice mild lace that indicates the sugar. There is quite a bit that carry a multitude of other delicate esters. Color is a mild color mahogany. The head regenerates with each sip. Nose of bourbon, maple syrup, brown sugar, toastiness, and honey. The palate is every aspect of that with a pollen mild fluff. A neutral sweet of fig. And a warm throat. The booze is a tad noticeable but only mildly. A wonderful feel.","rtepiak","Oct 26, 2010"
4.37,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Seriously good beer. Poured with a large foamy, frothy, fine, tan head that lasts and good lacing. Color is a hazy mahoganey. Aroma is heavy, volatile mix of malt, peat, dark ripe fruit and toffee. Flavor is like aroma with a sweetness/bitterness balance that is spot on along with the earthiness that works great. Body and carbonation work perfectly together and are full and lush. Finish is like flavor with a fleeting sense of the smoke. The rest of the characteristics actually taper off rather quickly and smoothly, ending with a fairly mild alcohol note considering the strength. Not a session unless you're a glutton.","drpimento","Oct 24, 2010"

Taste is sweet- brown sugar, toffee, caramel, dark fruits - a little roasted coffee, peat and a liberal dose of scotch/brandy and accompanying warming. There is a nice bitterness in the end to ameliorate all that sweetness up front. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy with a decent amount of carbonation. Watch out 'cause you certainly aren't aware of the ABV.

Not much bittering, but some booze and warmth going down. Really liked the mouthfeel, nice carbonation and almost creamy.

It pours a rich, deep burgundy without a mote of haze. The off-white head leaves plenty of lacing. It's a pretty beer. The aroma is thick with fruity malt flavors and warming alcohol. It smells like dried apricots and plums mashed up with fine rum. The aroma is like a caramelized Belgian quad, phenols and rich malt blend with melting sugar. I'm really not a big fan of the Scotch Ale generally speaking, but this beer hits the malt flavors just right. The malt is chewy and thick with a wonderful warming alcohol presence.

The taste is of brown sugar and raisins, tobacco and roasted malt, hints of sherry and mocha. There is a lot going on in the flavor profile. The feel is way full bodied, nicely carbonated yet smooth; finishes with a roasted malt bitterness. WOW, wasn't expecting this. This is a wee wee heavy, almost stout like.

It tasted like charred oak and roasted cocoa and barley, with some honey wheat and molasses. It was thick with silky carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a great malty flavor and fantastic body. However, the alcohol flavor became quite apparent as the beer warmed, which made it a bit less easy to drink. This wasn't as succulent as the other AleSmith beers I've tried, but it still seemed fitting for the style. I just personally prefer the sweeter malts, rather than the heavier ones like this.

The taste is sweet, starting off with biscuit and moving into pear and prosciutto, finishing with an edge that's salty, bitter, and highly alcoholic.

Poured the color of cola with a half inch tan-colored cap composed of copious ringlets; zero light penetration. Head quickly dissipated leaving swirls of foam bubbles and a band around the glass. Very little lacing present during the tasting. Nose was malty sweet. Caramel, molasses, dak fruit, roasty, boozy with a suggestion of hops detectable in the background. Taste consistent with nose; complexity of scents translates into the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a consistent effervescence throughout the quaff and a light alcohol burn and hops bittering detectable towards the finish. Definitely a big beer that lets you know it. Enjoyed sipping this over the course of an hour.","Jwale73","Jan 11, 2009"

Getting some ethanol now, both in the throat and lips, slightly noticeable, but I think as its warming up its really starting to come out. Some really mild bittering hops in the aftertaste.

A big malty sweetness hits the tongue and swallows the taste buds. A slight alcohol taste is apparent, but not overwhelming and warms the throat as it descends. A roasted flavor complements the caramel taste first noticed in the smell. The aftertaste is full of smoky bitterness that I find rather pleasant.

I think they are just overshadowed by the abv. As it warms they come out more, but so do the malts. Kind of chocolatey almost malt flavor. maybe roasted. Sugary finish with a little nice hop bite. This is a heavy-ass wee heavy. Mouthfeel is very good. On the thin side, which I like in this particular style, however you can defenitely feel this beer in your mouth.

Good carb fountain in center but no lacing. The aroma was heavy on the alcohol and dark fruits (raisin or plum). Slight malt in the back. The taste was also heavy on the alcohol. Kinda reminded me of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. It was missing the smoky, peaty aroma and taste that I love in most wee heavy/scoth ales. Really disappointed in this one.

It has never been a style that I have been all that fond of, but for the sake of expanding the range of the palate, decided I had to give them more of a chance. This one pours a mahogany color, with a very small white head that lasts till the end. Smell is big on chocolate, caramel, honey and alcohol. A slightly smoky aroma is in there too beneath the other smells. Taste is very much on par with the smells, however the aftertaste leaves a very pleasant coating in the mouth that is very close to butterscotch. Mouthfeel is big and busty, with lots of alcohol coming through, making it a sipper for sure. I have a feeling finishing the bottle with one buddy of mine will not be a problem. It reminds me a little bit of the Speedway Stout in that there is a fair amount of rich alcohol, but not quite to the extent of the stout.

Full bodied mouthfeel with slightly alcoholic finish - less alcoholic than you might expect for a 10% beer. Syruppy, heavy, dense, and smooth. This is a very tasty beer.

Despite the fairly low level of carbonation, there is something fairly spritzy on the nose, as well as plentiful dark fruits and a touch of molasses. The taste is very smooth and geentle at the start with no noticeable alcohol but lots of restrained sweet malt, followed by a growing malt explosion that culminates in bursts of chocolate, bitters, spice, rum soaked fruitcake, and a late cocoa finish. Very smootth and creamy, this is eeven a little undercarbonated for me by this point. Quite interesting and delicious and worth drinking.

First sip shows a rich and fairly full body with flavors of caramel and buttery toffee, rich sugary malts have their way for a good long time on the tongue before a slightly acidic, slightly dry finish that leaves a pleasing smoky aftertaste. There is a hint of a peppery spiciness that helps to balance the richness.

Dark fruit esters and cocoa layer underneath the heavy hand of the crystal sugary tones. You could say it smells earthy and of peat if you want to toss cliche about like a ball. I choose such description. The taste is outshined at first by the rich and thick mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is nearly outrageous. Thick and creamy with bubbly palate play to boot. Now for the taste. Very pleasant. Cocoa and bitterness. Fruity darkness and sweetness. Lightly smoky. Wild fermented characters. Good. The drinkability is easy. No problems here. The price is a bit suspect to me. I am not saying that this is not a good brew. I just find fault with the fact that it is twice as expensive as other comparable (within 100 ml) bomber sized offerings that are at least in the same league with this. I will buy another brand as opposed to spending $12.99 on this. It is good, but it ain't made of gold. I mean seriously, is the cost of living that much greater in the west?

Mouthfeel is thick and full, with subdued carbonation. A bit fusel with alcohol as it warms. Taste is more chocolate than any other malty taste. Some scorched coffee notes mix with the bitter chocolate as a wave of dark fruits enters the picture. Becomes vinous and fusel as it warms to room temperature. Lots of rum soaked dark fruits toward the finish. The roasty chocolate and coffee seem out of place here. A bit of a struggle to finish as the big alcohol is anything but subtle.

Great aroma with a nice balance, a combination of rich malt and chocolate, dried fruit, and a bit of smoke. Nothing was overpowering. Plenty of caramel and toffee in the flavour made up a rich malt backbone. Notes of figs, yeast and spice throughout. There's a strong, yet balanced, bitterness. Some alcohol warmth was apparent in the finish. Medium-full bodied with low carbonation. Two of us split the 750mL bottle and I could easily have had more. Excellent interplay of flavours and aromas. Another winner from Alesmith that I'll be picking up again.","DrJay","Jan 14, 2006"

The taste however, reaches like a broken limb and is unaccountably dilute. My Wee Heavy achieved perfect cellaring and serving at 50°F (exactly as it recommends on the bottle). But this beer doesnt taste like a full-bodied ale that has mellowed. It tastes like a stick figure trying to be a body builder. Its not that the essential flavors dont exist, theyre just never delivered until whatever flavors might have once achieved identity, are arrested by a blunt alcohol finish.","RedDiamond","Dec 04, 2005"

Didn't dissapoint either, very good beer. Appears a real dark russet brown color with some red when put up to the lights, and an average head of foamy bubbles. Smells sweet and complex. Lots of roasty malt characteristics, chocolaty, yet with some real pungent qualities to it that suggest something a bit rougher than your average ale. Taste gets even a bit more complex. Not a hoppy beer by any means, but there's a nice bitterness to balance the assertive sweet maltiness and chocolate tastes, as well as some complex spicing and fruitiness. Also, I think part of the bitterness comes from that traditional smokey flavor which is sort of the signature quality of a good scotch ale, and it's definately quite apparent in this beer. A nice alcohol kick also accents this beer. Medium bodied mouthfeel. This beer would be hard to drink a lot of because of the alcohol primarily, but the complexity keeps things interesting. Definately a unique beer, and I look forward to trying their others.","twelvsies","Oct 02, 2005"

Very deep rich brown, low to non existent head on it. The aroma was my number one rated aspect: rich, peaty style malts. Definite hot alcohol. Actually...the aroma also reminded me of a good German Doppelbock, so again I have to go back and complement the rich maltiness there. Tastewise, this is a sipping brew. It is very hot, not immediately off-putting for me, but there is no denying that one is drinking a high abv brew. The alcohol was not able to be ignored. Balancing that out, there were some tasty notes of chocolate, some toasty malt notes, and low acridity. I did enjoy this one. The bottle recommends storing some away, and I wouldn't mind trying this after the alcohol has mellowed a bit.","PatandDavid","Sep 17, 2005"

A second pour with a different glass got me a minimal head. It had a nice ruby dark color to it but lacked carbonation completely. Looked like a red wine. Aroma was really, really sweet. Toffee, figs, plums, molasses, and alcohol were all that I got. Is this a scotch ale or a dubbel? Taste had much less sweetness but still had notes reminiscent of wine. Figs were most dominant. A chewy body held up a drier malty flavor. Finish was alcohol and a little stinging. It was actually quite enjoyable and had a lot of potential. But where's the smoky flavor, the hops were minimal, and the lack of carbonation was quite upsetting (esp. for the price!). Good beer but a bit of a letdown.","granger10","Jun 09, 2005"

The flavor was divine as well, complimenting what I smelled fairly accurately. Good roasted notes with sweet dark fruit making a very very good flavor. The feel on this beer could not be improved.

Head fades rather quickly to a layer of bubbles, but there wasn't much to begin with, and for the style, that's not particularly shocking, and lacing was good. Aroma is sweet dark malts, with bits of dark fruits and alcohol popping up here and there. Taste is exquisite dark grain sweetness, with a tinge of fruit, and a long warming down the gullet.

The new bottle I recenlty picked up is listed at 9.5%. It hasn't lost any of its taste or other outstanding characteristics. Out of a 750 ml bottle, it an eye-pleasing brown with an off-white head that dimishes quickly leaving no lace. The smell is a real knockout: smoky, malty, and very earthy, with a surprisinly subtle alcohol smell. With the first smell, it was obvious that this was the ideal beer for this cold, rainy night. Although the smell is close to perfection, the taste is not a letdown. Malty but not sweet, the hops are just barely detectable but, happily, they are. This is a dangerously drinkable beer at 9.5%. Seek it out for a cold evening at home.","mickeymac","Dec 05, 2004"

A fluffy beige head sits atop the dark body that leaves minimal lace as this was consumed. Fruits scents will the aroma along with slight caramel malt sweetness. There is also a slight smoky note I am picking up from time to time. The flavor has a strong molasses taste with malty sweetness and the alcohol is definitely present. There were notes of chocolate and caramel and it ended with a slight alcohol after taste. Body was almost full with a sticky coating mouthfeel. I had no trouble finishing this big bottle and I would have had more if it were available. A very good example of the style that is worth a shot for sure.","meathookjones","Sep 24, 2004"

The flavor is of malt, molasses and a bit of carmel with some dark fruit aspect. The body is slightly silky and the finish is slightly sweet with a hint of astigency.

Nose is sweet malt, caramel and molasses, fresh and crisp, a pleasant sniff to be sure, start is demonstrative in its sweetness, thick malt presence, and the top is moderate to full in its feel to the palate. Finish has a fairish acidity, the hops relatively benign in their spiciness, the aftertaste droughty and a definite alcohol bitterness forms as the beer warms to the glass and room and it sticks to the palate till the very end.

Just a light alcohol hint in mid-mouth. In mouth, simply put, the beer tastes good. It has everything you wish your scotch ale to have while never being too sweet thanks to a generous (but restrained) hop profile, somehow grassy. Hints of candy, cream, coffee, chocolate.

3.33,-20,3.5,3,3.5,4,3,"I dearly love Alesmith beers, but I have to be honest here and say that this was somewhat of a disappointment overall, especially for $10. I hate to mention cost, but like it or not, in the real world, everything has a price. The Abbeye des Rocs Grand Cru that I can purchase locally for $6.99 for the same volume is now my Bench-Mark premium drink straight away or cellar beer. If youre going to compete in the higher priced echelons of the beer market, you better get your shit right and know your competition. That said, this is not a bad beer, far from it, but it is rather more that I expected greater and better things from it. Its good, but I think this one needs a lot more time to be great to be honest. If I splashed $10 and drank this fresh, then maybe I would be a tad let down. Give it another 24 months, or more, maybe only then will I be happy with my investment. But that's a long time for a return on a high priced beer. Thankfully, I have a few more bottles that are stashed away. But this will have to do much better to even have me consider splashing out another $10/bottle to even contemplate cellaring any more than the few I already have; the Grand Cru and Speedway Stout are much better for the same coin IMVHO.","TheLongBeachBum","Mar 21, 2004"
