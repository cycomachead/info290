2.53,-33.8,2.5,3.25,2.5,2,2,"Overall I didn't like this beer and I thought it was a poor example of the style, the taste didn't remind me much of a Wee Heavy and I thought it tasted more like a poorly brewed Old Ale. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, it was cloying, a little sticky, flat, not too filling and the taste didn't do a good job of holding my attention, half the bottle is enough for me, anymore than that and I think it would really start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad and it was fairly unique, but it just wasn't true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was how off of the style it was, the only aspect I think that could be identified to be Scotch Ale like would be the appearance, other than that it would be a tough sell to convince me this is what a Wee Heavy is suppose to taste like, I also didn't like how it had pretty much no carbonation. I wouldn't buy this beer again and there's a good chance I would turn it down if I was offered one. I wouldn't recommend this as a beer or a Wee Heavy, it's not a great example of either. All in all I didn't enjoy this beer, it just had too many things wrong with it and it didn't do justice for the style. This is now my least favorite Dragonmead beer and it's now one of my least favorite Wee Heavys. Better luck next time guys, this one needs a lot of work.","StoutHunter","Jul 13, 2014"

Aromas of huge raisin, grape, plum, molasses, caramel, toasted malt, bread, and light earthiness. Pretty nice aromas, that are much fruitier than I was expecting. Taste of big raisin, plum, tart cherry, caramel, molasses, toast, light chocolate, bread, earth, and a bit of a metallic twang. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, caramel, bread, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Flavors are quite balanced; but there are a bit of off flavors noticeable. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed well after the finish. Overall this is a good wee heavy. It was certainly fruitier than I was anticipating; but it was still quite enjoyable.","superspak","Mar 29, 2012"

Stronger, spicy caramel shows through in the after-taste. Feel is think and creamy, although the aftertaste is hort and doesn't really coat your mouth.

It poured a dark amber to brown, clear with a thick tan head that settled to a sheet of lace on the side of the glass. The aroma had an overwhelming toffee character backed by mild citrus and a distinct fig character. The taste has the toffee (like biting into a toffee apple), more of the citrus, and loads and loads of caramel. Alcohol heat kicks in on the finish, and alters a nice smooth mouth feel, making it just a little rough. This is a great beer, right up there with the Stone products of this type.","carln26","Jun 10, 2005"
3.31,-13.4,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours clear brown with ruby tints around the edges and a thick creamy tan head that forms lacing to the bottom of the glass.

Flavor is fairly malty with a bit of a husky/grainy note, just a hint of smoke and fruitiness, and enough noble hops to balance the malt. Overall, a very good scottish ale, but I don't really think it's ""big"" enough (in both aroma and flavor) for a wee heavy and it falls a bit short of my expectations.

This brew also was quite smooth, and went down with a good amout of ease. Finished slightly sweet, with notes of grain and wheat on the palate. A touch sour as well.

Taste is of caramel, hops, butterrscotch, and toffee. A slight cardboard taste. Overall a good example of the scotch-style ale. Somewhat higher alcohol content is hidden pretty well. The roasted flavor probably would keep from downing a lot or using as a session beer. More of a single bottle to be sipped and enjoyed.","mjohn27603","May 04, 2005"

On the tongue, the vanilla is present, backed by a strong alcoholic burn. Subsequent sips bring back thoughts of my trips to Bardstown, KY. Slightly medicinal finish.
