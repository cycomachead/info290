"Overall : Hell yes, I'd buy this again. A great scottish ale."

"Sweet malty, copper entry. Fruitiness is upfront and pronounced- prune, raisin, dark fruits. Cooked caramel adds some warmth to the glass. Soft, earthy hop bitterness comes in about 3/4 palate and on. Hops are slightly floral and pungent and the bitterness finishes soft and clean. Dull smoky notes are present from time to time, more apparent as the beer warms. Alcohol present from beginning to end, would like it to be covered a little better. Drinkability is average, hard to finish as the beer reaches room temp. Metallic taste in the aftertaste as the beer warms. Medium thin body. Carbonation is low, just enough to add to the beer versus take away from it."

"Lots of breadiness and some butterscotch/caramel flavor that creeps through. Wasn't my favorite at first sip but as I continue to sip on it the butterscotch seems to come through a little more for me. Then again, most Wee Heavy ales aren't my favorite at first sip."

"O: A favorite beer that I've had many times. One of the best scotch ales around and not overpriced like many are. A defining beer for Moylans Brewery"

"Medium+ bodied and sweet. On the verge of cloying. Medium length to the finish."

"Kilt LIfter pours a a clearish light brown color with a nice lacing head. There is a creamy put pettish aroma. The taste is a nice creamy but sharp malty taste, with hints of alcohol coming through. The taste is a little too watery, and weak body. Overall a pretty average Scotch Ale, but still enjoyable."

"A decent, if one dimensional (and by that, I mean multidimensional, but in the wrong way) wee heavy ale, the complexity of the style forgone by the demands of the West Coast, I presume. If you're gonna make an ale not of that ilk, as I imagine the design meeting proceeding, let's make it so true to its origins (i.e. no real discernible hops), that you couldn't mistake it for anything else. So there you have it - good, but a bit unbalanced, with a well-sublimated ABV overall."
""
""
"The Kilt Lifter is great...the second time around. I brought this from Sick-n-Twisted in SD to Utah to share with my good friend the Chicken Man. The beer pours a pretty rich clear amber with thin white head that is not lacing. The scent has a purty caramelly malt base. The taste is a nice evenly balanced beer with smooth carbonation. Overall...this is one heck of a solid scotch ale and I would recommend it to anyone Scotch Ale fan."

"Overall, I was quite underwhelmed. Flavor was lacking all-around and it is just a boring beer. Maybe the nitro hurt it but I doubt I will be picking up a bottle anytime soon."
"Pours a clear reddish/copper, with an almost non-existent head. Aromas of plums and a hint of copper(metallic). Taste begins with dried fruit, then some dark caramel, then a husky grain, and an earthy, sugary finish. Mouthfeel is a touch light. Overall a nice ale, though a bit too sweet for me, even for the style. I also wish there was a bit more smokiness to it."
"Overall – A sweet and tasty brew with a great drinkability at 8 % abv.. A nice drinker and one to try."
""
"Overall this may not compete side-by-side against some of the Scotch Ale heavy hitters, but this holds it's own. The flavor is there without being too boozy and it definitely pairs well with food. Now it must be my trek to get this brew into more Scottish Games festivals."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense cream colored head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Slight spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, caramel, brown bread, brown sugar, tobacco, leather, peat, light smoke, light chocolate, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and big complexity of malt and light fruity notes. Taste of raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, caramel, brown bread, leather, tobacco, peat, light smoke, light chocolate, and earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toast, caramel, toffee, brown bread, leather, light tobacco, peat, light chocolate, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt and light fruity notes; but the overall flavor robustness feels weak for the style. No cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and creamy mouthfeel that is ok. Mouthfeel feels much thinner than I expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice scotch ale style. Other than it being a bit thin in robustness of flavor and mouthfeel; there is a lot of nice flavor complexity and balance; and it is very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: An interesting take on the style that create a terrific easy drinking beer. Some of the flavors test the taste buds. All in all a successful beer that I would like to drink on St. Patty's day. Cheers!"
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is a decent American example of the style but nothing all that exciting."
""
""

"Nose is somewhat metalic. Sort of a murky brown color. Initial taste somewhat tart. Fairly thin for an 8% beer. No rich malt character as promised. Hops seem to be right for the style. I'm detecting a lactobacillus infection. Kind of a tart raisiny finish. Not very enjoyable. I'm guessing I got a bad bottle"
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers I have ever had, I am very glad I came across it! Hope this review helps you and thanks for taking the time to read my ramble a bit ;-)"

"O: A full meal deal. Glad I tried it."
"O- Solid all-around beer. Few weaknesses."
"Definitely a very interesting beer, and by the end part of my palate was questioning whether it was drinking either a strong malt-based beer or a watered down scotch. This is pretty recommended for non-hop heads and huge fans of whiskey or scotch who want to try something new. Not my personal favorite, but I personally wouldn't be able to make a better take on this style myself. I'm most definitely intrigued to trying more beers like this in the future."
""
""
""
"A good sipper. Lots of breadiness and I like the fruit aspect as well. The malt was there but seemed shallow. The fruit and bread was the showcase. Very clean but the tannins helped out with that. I wouldn't call it bold but a good drinker for the price."
""
""
"Believe this to be a well brewed example, but not a style of beer I personally enjoy often."
"I like this style of beer and enjoyed it but I would probably not get it again unless I visited California."

"Overall - A decent beer. The aromas a bit off-putting but can be overlooked. Unfortunately once overlooked, there's not much to look forward to. Probably wouldn't buy again, but I'd drink it if offered."

"Note: side of bottle said ""live ale, keep refrigerated"". It was at room temp in the store. I hope my other bottle isn't bad as well."

"I don't like this beer and it doesn't tick the boxes for style either. Pretty poor really."
""
"This is a nice scotch ale. Easy drinking and a big kick to boot."
"O: I dug this beer, worth an occasional purchase and makes a good nightcap."
"O - a decent enough scotch ale, better than average but not outstanding, all the flashiness on the bottle just doesn't live up to the hype but still a worth a try"
""
""
"D/O: This Scotch ale is successful as a wee heavy that is drinkable yet slightly decadent at the same time. Its sensory qualities are simple but adhered to well, with sugary malt and booze joining together in an appealing fashion. This beer has a lot of range--it could pass as a strong, malt-focused amber ale to be enjoyed alongside a meal, or it could be slowly sipped to satisfactory effect."
""
"O - A tasty scotch ale but there's certain aspects that were a bit disappointing. The mouthfeel was a tad thin and the flavours could use a bit of a boost. Higher ABV is well hidden though and it is rather drinkable. Definitely still worthy."
""
""
""
"O - Can't believe I have never bought this before. Its excellent for the price point. A great sipper."
""
"Boozy burn in the finish is not overbearing. Nice balance. True to style. A great example of the style. Great, tasty, sipper."

"Overall, I like this Scotch Ale, but I don't love it. You'll need to allow it to warm to at least 60F to see it's full potential. Laughing Lab has it beat, hands down. It is very easy on the wallet which is important during a shit-rittled economy. Worth a try at least."
""
"Watery body is unfortunate, should be thicker."
""
""
"Ive had this before about 2 years ago on tap down in So Cal, and i was really impressed. As with most beers in general, they usually taste better from tap. This beer had a good combination of smoothness and flavor....i would recomend if you happen to find this one"
"Overall Impression- This brew was good but needed more depth and more strength... Coming in at 8% ABV, I thought this would happen but not sure I ever caught what I wanted to classify as a Scotch Ale. Wouldn't diss this brew but many more offerings from Moylan Brewery that are much better."
""
"Overall: I'm lovin tryin all these new interesting beers so not a knock, but only slightly above average IMO."

"22 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" S.Salem. $5.45..seems like they dropped the ""Kiltlifter"" and its just ""Moylans Scotch Ale"" Smokey hazelnut broon with a small light tan heid. Aroma ..very malty as expected and with hints of cream,toast and a tiny smidgen of peat-smoke Taste is smooth malty goodness, some plum and again a hint of peaty smoke..creamy underfeel. Ok on the palate..on the thin side but in this case it is helpful. An OK beer again..but not a great Scotch Ale"

"The feel of this beer is smooth and goes down easy with a nice crisp, drinkable body that makes this beer just right. There is a nice aftertaste that hangs in the back of the throat and then is gone not long after."
"Certainly not a bad beer, but somewhat forgettable."
"Overall, a decent scotch ale. I would have liked more carbonation and a little more caramel malt sweetness. The flavor is actually fairly good and true to the style, I just like a little more sweetness and carbonation."
"Pours a murky cherry copper hue which leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and no lacing,the smell is a touch of scotch,sweet caramel malts and fruit cake,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of sweet sticky caramel and toffee,fruit cake,raisins soaked in brandy,a light touch of scotch,candied plums and finished with a light mix of herbal Tea and bittersweet toffee and overall its a SAWH and although very sessionable i would not buy again cheers."
"Overall a sweet enticing brew, with a strong alcohol flavor that will most definitely rock your world if you drank too much."
"O-Another good beer from Moylan's."
"This beer, despite being 8% had a much lighter mouthfeel that I would have thought. Much easier drinking that I would have thought."
"A rich, rewarding beer. One to savor on a cold winter night."
"Good stab at a Scotch style ale. I was impressed by the head retention for a beer with an 8% AVB. Aroma a taste were a little roastier than I would like in this style. The beer is really tasty however and drinkable. I recommend giving it a shot anytime."
"Very pleasant example of a scotch ale. When most are fairly heavy, this one's very drinkable. recommended."
"Overall, this beer was nothing short of disappointing. Thin, overly carbonated and very one dimensional. If your curious about this one, don't be"
"Overall - pretty interesting brew in general, with a fairly unique tasting range."
"Not what I expected. It's strange, and not in a terrible way, so I'd recommend trying it just for that, but it's not something on the top of my list to have again and again."
"Kilt Lifter is a perfectly serviceable scotch ale, but one that is more likely to impress those new to the style than more familiar palates. It was probably among the first wee heavy beers I tried, some five plus years ago, and comparing the scores, my impression of it then was certainly much higher than it is now. But, as then, I certainly did enjoy it."
"Y-a-w-n... ""thin"" and ""light"" are the two adjectives that best describe this beer. In my book, a good scotch ale will waft forth with malt, teak, a little sting and, frankly, a nice fistful of peas. This has... nothing. Very little aroma beyond yeast; very little taste beyond more yeast. Gets slightly richer as it warms, but also gets w-a-a-a-y too boozy. Pass. For a good American scotch ale, visit Founders."
"This a pretty good brew. It's not as in-your-face as many in the Wee Heavy category. The wood and sweet caramel cover up a lot of the alcohol, so you've got to keep in mind the ABV. Goes well with grilled mushrooms or ham."
"MY CONCLUSION: I think this was only my second sampling from Moylan's. I'll need to try more before making any conclusions about them, but I will say that despite their Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale tasting more like a standard Scottish ale (which I'm not a fan of) that had been intensely amped up than a wee heavy, I still enjoyed it. The other criticism of this beer that I have is that it is MUCH better when warm than cold. The label recommends letting it warm before drinking, which can sound like beer snobbery to some, but in this case it should be taken as a warning that the beer won't taste very good otherwise. While I agree that most beer tastes better at around 50+ I consider it a major weakness if one tastes this bad when cold."
"O: A well done scotch ale and it shouldn't be a problem to finish the bomber myself."
"Deep orange, almost brown pour with a sturdy frothy head. Deep sweet aromas with slight hints of hop presence. The hint of hops on the nose rushes to the front of the flavor profile. A mouth watering first gulp that finished sweet with only a slight hop finish. THe hops really concentrate on the sides of the tongue and back of the pallet leaving a pretty clean finish. There is a noticable alcohol presence as the drinking conintues, with a warming of the throat and chest. The body of the brew is on the thin side, not leaving a lot of texture. Still cannot detect the actual hop presence in the flavor through the nose. The flavor does not really resonate with me and ends up being relatively bland once the initial hop bittnerness goes away. I am not a fan of the mouthfeel, a bit thinish."
"This brew poured out as a nice clear dark amber color. With a slight tan head on it that stuck around for a while. The smell was earthy, not a lot of hops in this brew or anything, not that there should be for this style. The taste was smooth and with some good malt in the body of the beer. The mouthfe was on the heavier side but not thick. Overall its pretty good and totally worth another round."
"Overall, I thought this was really an excellent beer, and one of the better I have had in the style."
"From the bomber to the pint glass. Pours a cloudy dark copper with a creamish head. Smell is slight with toffee notes and malts. Taste is mild with malts (munich?) and toffee/caramel. Hops are understated and sweet. A nice solid Scottish Ale with the elevated ABV buried well."
"Drink this expecting the aftertaste of a nice scotch, but I really couldn't imagine drinking more than a couple in a session as it gets to be a bit much over time. All the same, a very impressive beer if peat is what you want to taste."
"Overall, pretty tasty scotch ale that sits right and is very drinkable."
"Overall this is probably my favorite beer on tap at this bar, so I'd definitely have more of it... I'd like to try it again in the bottle as well."
"Drinkability...you could drink these all night. But since it is 8%, most would pass out about an hour into the night."
"I expected more spunk from this brew. Everything about it was good but not memorable. Makes for a good drinker though. The ABV is hidden quite well for such modest flavor. There's no bagpipe serenade as kilts go a'flyin, but I'm fairly content."
"For a scotch ale coming in at 8% abv, this beer tastes a bit light. Nothing about it would ever make me come back for more."
"Not a bad beer, just a little surprisingly given the style guidelines. If you like the style, check this one out. Not as bold as the label would have you believe."
"Pours dark brown with small, creamy, off-white head. Smells of honey, roasted malts, toasty, dark fruit (fig), slight earthy hops. Perhaps a bit of smoked malt as well. I get the same from the taste in addition to some bread character and some caramel. Definitely malt forward but I can detect a small amount of hoppiness. Medium body, medium carbonation, and a slightly dry finish. This was a tasty scotch ale. Winter is about to set in here in Michigan and this warms the soul at 8%."
"Would love to pick a newer bottle of this up and see the difference."
"Overall, a very tasty Scotch Ale worthy of the 50,000 award seals they splattered all over their label."
"Excellent for a scotch ale. I'm not a big fan of the style, but would definitely have another one of these in the future."
"This is a good brew, it hides the alcohol extremely well."
"The label calls this ""robust and strapping," and I would totally agree. While it didn't totally blow me away, it's enjoyable enough and well-balanced enough that I can't award it anything less than a ""4" for drinkability. A unique take on the Scotch Ale, one that will have style-fascists running for the hills...and I like that."
"d - good beer and i enjoyed but i've had better wee heavies."
"Overall: Well, I am glad that I got to try this one, but I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed. Aside from a few minor flavor variations, it's not much different then drinking a cheap 40 oz. of malt liquor. The buzz is there, but that's about the best thing going for this one."
"Not a successfully barrel aged beer, in my opinion."
"D - if you can enjoy a rich brew, you can drink this one. "
"I really like how big this beer is and how easy it is to drink. I will defiantly be buying this beer again and getting my Kilt Lifted."
"This is the second of Moylan's brew I have had and the first scotch ale I have tasted. Not really sure how to rate this one as it is the first ""scotch ale"" I have had. Sadly I didn't care for it much at all. It has a bland taste which I was not at all impressed with. The smell was very nice, If Moylan's could bottle the smell and make a candle out of it the candle lovers of the world would be astonished. Which for me the taste fell very short. I'm gonna try some other ""scotch ales"" so i can give a better review, but who knows maybe I'm just not a ""scotch ale"" fan."
"As far as Scotch ales go, I have definitely had better, though I wouldn't kick Moylan's out fo bed. While an entire night or tipping back this alcoholic sugar water at 8% ABV might not be advised, the 22oz. bomber was just enough to get my fill."
"As a ""Scottish Style Ale"" made in America, it's fine. I could drink a few in a night. But if you're expecting a Scotch Ale, move on. Grab the Duck Rabbit, which kills this one and nails the style."
"Drinkability: There is no two ways about it - this is just a great value. I ordered this out to try something new without knowing anything about it, and I was quite satisfied with how that decision worked out. Full bodied, smooth, and quite drinakble, I may have to pursue some Scottish Ales and Scotch Ale/ Wee Heavy's to really explore this style."
" D- This beer has a thin and soft flavor that is missing the nice rich malt backbone but the odd flavors get in the way of what little malt was there. It wasn't worth finishing the bomber."
"Drinkability: Great brew, just interesting enough to keep me drinking but just shy of ""greatness"". More herbs and a different hop profile might elevate this brew."
"Overall drinkability is average. The flavors are good by themselves, but its the integration that hurts this beer for me. Very different from previous Wee Heavys because it is much sweeter with almost no scotch taste. I would only recommend the beer to those who prefer sweeter beers, but overall it is only average."
"D- its a mediocre beer...probably would not refuse a bottle, but definitely wouldnt go out of my way to get one."
"Poured into a snifter. The color is an amber-brown without any real head, lacing, or legs. Not much going on here. The nose is some caramel, dark fruits, and a bit of booze. The flavor doesn't really bring much other than a bit of malt and some alcohol. Booze on the palate and in the finish. Not my cup of tea."
"drinkability - just wasn't my cup of tea, will not be revisiting"
" Not exactly the real McKay (pronounced MacKie) but much more than a young pretender."
"It truly is outstanding. I wish I had another!"
"D: Not the worst thing I've ever tried, but hardly great, either. Average."
"Mouthfeel is about right for the style - not much carbonation, almost syrupy but not quite. Makes me want to go to sleep. This is probably a fine thing to drink in Winter."
"A medium amber colored brew with little head. carbonation is medium. Sweet, earthy aromas. Flavor is heavy and sweet and very muddy-earthy. Let this one warm a bit and it'll taste a bit better. I have brewed with peat smoked malts before and wish pro brewers would put more ""smoke"" into this style to balance the intense sweetness. Finish on this one is a bit herbal. The ABV comes through on the backside. Thanks to Glid02 for this one."
"D - Considering the ABV this is a pretty easy ale to drink, although I have had better."
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a beautiful glowing reddish/orange amber with little head. Smells sweet and malty and firm with a nice Horlick's aroma and a touch of a maple syrup. Tastes firm and dry, but with that typical Scotch ale syrupy malt flavor, a little spicy, and with some underlying fruit. Firm, and smooth in the mouth. Pretty nice."
"All in all, this is not a great brew by any means. Not worth hunting down and not worth your time and money. Started decent, but ended up not good."
"	Kilt lifter makes for a decent cold weather sipper. It manages to sort of bridge a gap between a proper Scotch wee heavy and a Scottish ale. The alcohol is quite well hidden, lending an above average drinkability. While Kilt Lifter lacks the chewiness of a proper Scotch ale, its still a respectable brew. Props to Moylan's for another tasty quaff."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and provides the thirsty Braveheart with a semo-sweet finish that slowly fades away into a phantom bitterness. What stood out is that the aforementioned potency increases as the beer attains room temperature. In other words, don't drink this cold as you will miss out on the taste of it. A real nice beer that represents a very dependable style that can be rewarding if done right. That'll do pig. Whoops, got my movies confused. Damn that Kilt Lifter!"
"Pours super hazy with a honey/amber hue. I have never seen something this hazy before. Smells strongly of sugary malt and a little bit of alcohol. Dare I say a little honey? Kinda reminds me of smoky apple cider as well. The hops cut through the first few sips. Grain and malt flavors are present, this combo also kinda tastes smoky, like a scotch or whiskey. Everything thing is there, just not popping out at my pallet. Scotch/smoke flavors cut through after several sips making me think twice about the hop comment. The carbonation is a little distracting, but not by much. I find it acceptable. The body is thin medium, which is nice. If it were any thicker I probably wouldn't enjoy this once it warms up. Not a bad batch of scotch ale. I've had several others which I like a little more( Iron springs scotch ale might be my favorite), but this is certainly enjoyable for the time being."
"D - This beer has the elements I look for in a strong Scottish ale, but it doesn't quite come together for me. The malt that I enjoy gets overpowered by the strong, unpleasant smoky flavor and aroma. I don't need another one."
"D - At around 6-8 bucks a bomber it's not the worst you can buy but don't expect a hearty wee heavy that will warm your heart and fill your taste-buds with flavor. Just expect a great ale with very nice caramel a molasses with a high ABV and very little if any Scotch."
"3.5/4.0/4.0/3.0/4.0"
"Taste-Sweet malt, caramel, toffee notes, leading to a sweet finish. 8.0ABV. pretty well-hidden, easy-drinking, if a bit on the sweet side. A decent Scotch ale though not as pronounced as a Wee Heavy would be."
"Believe it or not, when it reached that golden temp, though, it became one of the most ridiculously drinkable scotch-type ales I've had. Far from stellar all-around but, despite the surprisingly bittersweet malty film it leaves behind, goes down ridiculously smooth. Not rich nor weighty but alright."
"Atmosphere is great. Really pure and imperial appearance, and a nose just loaded with twists and turns. Flavor is really full and hearty, but almost cloying in nature. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"D. While it was good, this will not be one I reach for again any time soon. It seems like a ""white bread"" interpretation of a Scotch Ale and I prefer them to be a little more traditional."
"D - This is a tasty scotch ale that goes down smooth, maybe a little too smooth, enjoy!"
"D - For such a huge, malty brew, I find myself drinking this faster then I normally would. Balance is decent and this is tasty and goes down easy."
"D: A good effort, this beer is well priced and is easily available, but it is definitely the Americanized version of Wee Heavy. You're not getting Belhaven here."
"Pours a dark, slightly cloudy, amber with a big tan head. Head is a bout two and a half fingers but recedes quickly and leaves little lacing. Big malty, brown sugary, flavor up front with some spiciness and alcohol bite in the finish. Some hop bitterness lingering but not much. Nice, clean, medium bodied mouthfeel. Was kind of surprised at how quickly I finished the bottle, which speaks to the drinkability of this one."
"Pours cherry red and clear with a very short lived head and lots of carbonation. Odd, cherry cough syrup characteristic present in the sweet aroma which also comes out in the front and middle. Malty with same strange cough syrup characteristic. Sugary middle. Faint, faint bitterness that pops out after the finish. Medium heavy mouthfeel. This is an unfamiliar style for me."
"As smooth and creamy as Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, which has always been a favorite of mine. Beautiful deep mahogany scarlet in color. A lasting thin head of off-tan cream. Sweet malts and brown sugar and some dark fruitiness. Medium bodied, This is so smooth and velvety it is almost as if you are not even drinking it. Perfect amount of carbonation. Instantly leaves you wanting to take another drink. My first beer from Moylan's and I'm looking forward to try Hopsickle!"
"D: Very drinkable for a beer of this strength and style. The lighter mouthfeel from the carbonation makes this easier to drink, and the balance makes it deceptively smooth."
"D - Easy enough to drink, but the boring flavor profile and conspicuous alcohol presence make it hard to justify having more than one."
"D - There should be no doubt that Moylan's Kilt Lifter is a truly world class Scotch Ale offering... Just a notch the rest of my favorites for the style... To strong to be a session beer, but not quite a sipper... Just a solid alll around offering and a wonderful introduction to Moylans..."
"jd"
" Palate is well-balanced between sweet caramel malt and mild, fruity hops. A very mild hint of peat smoke lingers throughout. Finish is somewhat boozy, nice and warm. Body is smooth and creamy, with just a touch of stickiness. This is a highly drinkable beer - a little thin for a Scotch ale, but still very nice. It's a shame it's not available in Oregon due to a turf dispute with Pike Brewing."
"o - solid scotch ale. great representation of the style. could easily enjoy a bomber to myself. will definitely buy this again."
"Drinkability> great!"
"Mouthfeel was thin & a bit overcarbonated. I was underwhelned by this beer & doubt I'll buy it again."
"This multiple award winner from Moylan's is decent in certain departments but not an out and out winner in my book. Poured into a pint glass from a bomber size bottle with average head that died quickly - there was an ever present lace on the surface which also sticks to the walls of the glass - which I like. As far as the aroma is concerned - Score!! If you like beer, it would be painfully hard to not take a sip right away since it smells so inviting. Taste is decent, I guess I just am not a Scotch Ale kind of person. The Scotch taste is unmistakable but you can also taste the malt and caramel. The Scotch in the beer made it not particularly drinkable for me. After half a pint, I was about ready call quits on it. At 8% abv, it is a stronger beer but the Scotch fumes make it very suitable for occasions when you are relying on just one beer or two to get you in a happy mood."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would reccommend it to everyone."
"I am enjoying this stab at a wee heavy but would be fooling if I said I'd buy it frequently, or even again. There are better examples and I may soon have one of the best, or at least my favorites, in my market."
"A nice beer. Nothing special, but a bit one-dimensional in the flavor."
"Overall this was a very good beer that was just a few flaws away from being great. Very good flavors and aromas however I would like it to be just a bit more robust in mouthfeel. Still, one of the best I've had from the style and well worth a shot."
"Kilt Lifter is not a bad beer, but it's not a great one either. For all the ingredients in here I expected more flavor. Still, it's easy to drink and the 8.0% abv is not all that noticeable. It's not the best Moylan's has to offer, but it's still a decent brew."
"pours a deep red/brown with decent amount of head. smells of caramel, toasted nuts, scotch and hops. Tastes of caramel, cherry and bitter hops. Drinkability is suprisingly good. This is a good scotch style ale that would pair well with a root vegetable soup or crusty bread."
"Pours a clear dark brown red color body. Average foamy off-white head. Strong scotchy aroma, dark caramel, very sweet dark cherry aroma. Strong cherry aroma. Sweet taste, caramel, light body. Fruity, light taste. Pretty tasty, clean. Almost like caramelized raisins."
"Drinkability: I poured it out. Thats a rarity."
"D: Too fruity and too sweet and slick. Not hearty enough in the malt department for my tastes for this style. An OK beer but not one I'd buy again."
"Moylan's has again produced a fine beer, albeit one that requires a little time, patience, and the leveling factor of room temperature to elicit its best characteristics. Very good stuff, and another example of why, after some time, Scotch Ale has ascended the ranks of my personal favorite styles."
"D- very good- the slight scotch with the sweet and slight bitter is well balanced- very enjoyable a little on the sweet side"
"D- Pretty easy drinker, I was looking for another bomber before I knew it. Definitely will pick this one up again."
"Drinkability: decent beer but it is a bit too sweet for me to have more than one bomber bottle."
"Nose is of dark caramel malts with maybe a hint of brown sugar. Taste has those dark caramel malts at the forefront - there's also a bit of a burning character not unlike scotch itself (although maybe it was just power of suggestion). Sweet overall with a bit of a bitterness like that found in unsweet tea. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is fair - I found the taste a bit intense, so I ended up sipping."
"D - Another winner for me from the boys at Moylan's, this is a great style of beer that is a welcome addition"
"good representation with in the style but a hop lovers left wanting more."
"Taste, again, very sweet, not a malt bomb or overly heavy Scotch ale, even though it clocks in at 8%. Lots cf toffee/caramel may be the cover for the alcohol. True to style, not much in hops or bitterness. Mouthfeel you get a little used to it, but at the same time, it isn't going to leave you clammoring for more."
"Notes: Very pleasant and surprisingly delicious to pair with just about any food."
"This brew just went down smooth for me and I found myself wanting another!! This is a big bottle of beer and at 8%, it's easy to get carried away by it. Nice brew! Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and recommend this to those who want a light bodied brew withe earthy and malty undertones and a hint of chocolate malts."
"The Kilt Lifter is very aggressive, like most good Scotch Ales, but it all combines to create an amazing whackadoo ale."
"Overall not a huge fan of the style. I've had this beer on tap before and I liked it much more then."
"D - For a beer with 8% its a good drinker but it ends up being much too sweet for me in the long run. A shared 22 is already plenty. No more after that please."
"Pours a slightly hazy, amber/brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of dark citrus, sweet malt, slight metallic, and slight tart malt. Fits the style of a Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, dark citrus, hint of spice, hint of alcohol, and some bitterness. Overall, a smooth, easy-drinking, good blend, but not too strong of body."
"Aroma is fairly strong, malty and yeasty with a firm undertone of caramel, rather sweet. It pours a clear mahogany brown with a fairly thick but not persistent off-white head. Flavor is malty with a strong burnt caramel overtone and nutty and yeasty hints. Texture is quite smooth and has a bit of a nip to it, almost like a barleywine."
"Pours a chocolate brown color with an average tan head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of a light roasted malt, a bit buttery, wet wood, and a touch of pepper. The taste is a mix of caramel malt and lightly roasted malt, a bit of milk chocolate and nuts. The feel is moderate with initially a fizzy carbonation but which smooths out leading to a nice silky feel. Nice balance between sweet and roasted and the abv well hidden. The aroma and taste is a tad below what I expect for a wee heavy. Needs to be a bit bolder and more earthy. However, the brew has a very nice feel and drinks very easy. Better Scotch ales out there but this ain't too bad."
"D- Very nice, but I expected more flavor for an 8% ABV Scottish Ale. Very drinkable nonetheless. Goes down easy, and none of the flavors become overpowering..."
"D: Drinkable, but I think I've been spoiled on Wee Heavies after drinking the Divine Reserve #9. Won't be seeking out again."
"If the alcohol mellows out a bit this would be really good. I might put some away for a year or so and see what happens. Though this is not a good beer to drink fresh IMO."
"D: I remember being pretty impressed with this one early in my craft beer days. It's not as great as I remember, but it's still a pretty good scotch ale. With some improvements I think it would be a really great one."
"Picked up a bomber at O'Shea Brewing in Laguna Niguel at the end of May for $4.28. Beer poured a clear copper brown with a decent head initially that dissapated quickly. Nose is sweet caramel malts and a hint of floral hops. Taste is malty sweet, but not in a bad way with a little hint of hops leading to a clean finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied and fairly lively on the palate. Drinkability is good. I was craving a different style and this filled the bill, a nice malt bomb that represents the style pretty well."
"Got this bottle a few months ago at Sam's in Chicago. Poured with a medium head and no lace. Color is a very hazy amber with brown highlights. Aroma is scotch ale and a little peat. Flavor's about the same but with strong coconut! Therefore, not one of my fav. scotch ales. No apparent alcohol. Body's ok."
"D- Although my tongue has adjusted to hoppy beers after moving out West and sampling the amazing hop crazy beers out here, this beer is a breath of fresh air for my palate. I could drink this for quite awhile. Bravo to Moylan's for making a great beer that I'll be sure to pick up again."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - Would definitely get this one again - makes for a great bomber to share with a friend!"
"Nicely crafted big beer."
"22oz. bomber served in a shaker pint glass. Poured a light amber with a finger of tight bubbled off white head. Big malty aroma with caramel. Flavor is more of the same. Toffee and caramel maltiness. On the fuller side of medium bodied. Flavors came out a lot better as it warmed. I didn't really write down a whole lot about this one, but if you enjoy a malty beer, give this one a try. Good take on the style."
"Opinion: I am a pretty big fan of this style of beer, but this particular one doesn't really ""do it for me"". The malts are off balance somehow. It should be a bit sweeter with no real hops or one particular malt component being this noticeable. The Peat malt is not one of my favorites, but even if that is what I am picking up, I would say that it is a peated Crystal Malt (If there is such a thing) or they went for a long boil and just burned the wort in the kettle. I don't know but the aftertaste is somewhat harsh to me. The beer is not so bad that I won't finish it, but I won't be buying this particular beer from Moylan's again in the near future. Hopefully it was just kettle-burn and won't be here in the next release."
"D - Very good Scotch ale with a ton of malt character and enough of a hop presence to keep the malt from getting heavy-handed."
"D - Might be ok with some chocolate, but otherwise I would skip this bottle of liquid sugar the next time around. One plus, however is that due to the chocolate-cake soaked in butterscotch-cloying sweetness, the alcohol is almost completely hidden and at 8% that scares the hell out of me!"
"The drinkability is just alright... it's a very alcohol-present beer, and should last you a WHILE sipping slowly. Fortunately the alcohol doesn't dominate the taste, though."
"Notes: Overall, I'm impressed with the Kilt Lifter. It's definitely more on the subtle side rather than big and bold, which means you kind of have to dig for the flavors. But, once it warms up to room temperature, it's a little more forthcoming. Ends up a little on the sweet side, but never overwhelms the palate because the balance is never too far out of whack. Enough interesting flavors and complexity to keep me interested through the bottle, but I don't know about a bomber of this stuff. As is, it was quite enjoyable."
"Picked up a single at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove, MN. Appeared a clear amber with a short off-white head. This was a pleasant beer for an unusually cool summer evening. The flavor and aroma are a mix of sweet apple juice with caramel and toffee candy. Drinkable for the style and slightly warming. All in all, a very good Wee Heavy. Not too dry, not too thick, and not too sweet - all my typical complaints with this style. Give ti a try."
"D - Easily drinkable for a strong ABV. Very nice scotch ale."
"Very good beer, but not as cloyingly sweet as many in the style."
"Taste even started off slow. But thankfully, I started to realize that this is perhaps a more traditional take on the style, more subtle than bold. The flavors took a while to unfold, but once they do, quite nice. Caramel malts and overripe apple take the lead, the peak showing up toward the end. The mouth is medium, doesn't feel light though, decent carbonation. In all, based on the other Molyan's I've had, I was expecting more. Instead, I got either a beer reveling in its subtleties, or an off beer, or its just stock. Decent enough to drink, regardless."
"D - High ABv and overwhelming sweetness prevent me from enjoying more than one."
"Picked up a single of this brew at Hop City in Atlanta, GA. Poured into my Stone Barleywine glass. Pours a amber color with nearly no head. Sweet brown sugar and candy in the nose. Taste is malty, bready, and sugary sweet. Slightly watered down mouthfeel. Overall, a decent scotch ale, but I've had better."
"Overall, I thought this beer would be a little better. The combination of malts and hops just didn't click for me. I won't be having this again."
"D - The 8% makes this a tough call but I can see this going down a bit easier in cool weather, afteer a meal w/a decent stogie. The lable says it's food friendly and I agree."
"This poured a translucent mahogany with light tan head. It smelled like nutty malt with creamy and bready yeast, and some light lemon hops. It tasted like light nutty malt with some honey and caramel and bready yeast, and a bit of lemon hops. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mild malty aftertaste. Overall this was definitely just a ""wee"" heavy, with a lighter malt flavor than some other richer Scotch Ales. But this had a very clean and refreshing flavor that hid the alcohol quite well, so it was very easy to drink. It had decent body too. So definitely not a bad beer, but not as rich a maltiness as I prefer for this style."
"Moylan's Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale pours a finger of tan foam over an opaque, cloudy, dark amber brew. Carbonation is slow and steady, the head collapses to a cream ring pretty quickly. The nose is yeasty, fruity funk- something like overripe apple. The flavor is sweetish malts trending toward tart cidery notes and a bit of herbal hop off the back (though there is little perceived bitterness). Mouthfeel is round, finishing a bit dry, and there's a bit of an herbal tea flavor in the aftertaste. Alcohol by volume is a decent 8%, though at no time is the alcohol noticeable. Usually, I like my Scotch Ales a little maltier and smokier than this one- something that echos the Scotch it could be if it was distilled. This one, though confounding my expectations a bit, was yet pretty tasty- a nice sipper to be sure."
"D- I absolutely love this beer but I find it hard to finish more than one. I suppose it might not deserve a deduction due to this but no beer is perfect so...4.0. Such a great beer as it warms and its subtlties shine through. Great American rendition of this style. A must try beer from a great brewery!"
"Drinkability: Politely put, it's a fine, serviceable scotch ale that's more wee than heavy, leaving me wanting for a more hearty malt backbone. For the time being, I'll be reaching for a 90 Shelling instead."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable and easy drinking (even for an 8% ABV) Scotch Ale. I would definitely drink it again."
"This is what I envisioned a good Scotch ale would be. Big and robust, sweet, toasty and smooth. The 8% alcohol might keep this from being an everyday beer, but I could certainly make it a regular in my fridge. This may not be the beer for you if you don't like toasted caramel flavors. I loved it!"
"D- a decent american scotch ale that i probably would buy again because its so cheap. 4.39 for this bottle on sale. the bottle wasnt hard to finish, but i wont crave this one any time soon."
"D: This drinks easily - a little too easily in fact, if that's possible. It tastes really nice, but with a beer of this style, you want it to be a huge, chewy, sticky brew, not some mild-bodied imitation."
"Pours a mid-copper color, a bit light for a Scotch Ale, with very little head and no lacing. Nice deep scent, very dark and rich, good malt tones with excellent peat aromas. Deep peat flavor with good tangy malt flavors, fairly sweet with just a tiny hop hint at the very end mingling with the other flavors. Goes down a bit rough, the alcohol is not well hidden. Not my favorite Scotch style ale, but still good."
"M/D: quite strong in the alcohol sense but light in texture. Quite drinkable but not really my style."
"D: I wasn't really in the mood for an boozy and sweet combination. A syrup-like flavor really takes over as the beer warms. I'm dying for a bit more balance in this beer!"
"D = Drinks easily at first but gets cloying relatively quickly."
"Scotch style ales aren't the first thing you think of with California crafts, but this is a good take."
"Beer poured into a Douglas Scotch ale glass. No head whatsoever. Gorgeous burgundy color and a steady, methodical flow of carbonation. Nose is heavy malt with some toffee notes, simple but very appealing. Taste is malt heavy with an alcohol burn in the finish. The brew has a thin appearance and mellow carbonation so the mouthfeel was a little thin as I suspected but the carbonation surprised me and provided a champange effervescence. I enjoyed this Scotch ale but have had some better ones."
"22oz bottle into a half liter Victory mug pours a crisp dark copper with a thin diminishing off-white head. Aroma is a nice amount of caramel malts. Taste is loads of malts, both caramel and brown, almost no hop presence, but you can tell they're there doing their job. The beer is medium bodied, but the smooth carbonation hides the alcohol well. This is a very enjoyable Scotch ale."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, it's flavorful and since this beer isn't as thick as most in the style, it's a good one to drink for a long time."
"The light body makes this pretty drinkable, as well as the fact that for a malty brew this isnt an overt malt bomb. An interesting take on the style with a more pronounced fruitiness than i am used to, but is spot on with the phenolics and hint of mineral. This is going to be much easier to drink than i had though upon opening the bottle, and that is a good thing. Certainly worth a try for fans of the style, this is a very drinkable example."
"Very drinkable, overall. This could be an everyday scotch ale. Maybe even a beginner version. Super smooth and easy to drink. Enjoyable."
"D: Very drinkable beer and has a great malt character. Don't be thrown-off by its appearance."
"This Scotch Ale has great taste, perhaps amazing taste is a better description. The malts are incredible. The color is as good as it get's beautiful. The head as poured from the bottle is somewhat small and the beer is not thick, but ample. I could drink this every night. One of my better all time beers."
"I had no idea what to expect. Poured up a slightly cloudy dark red colour, with a khaki coloured blanket of foam on top. Looks terrific. Smell is huge sweet malts with a bit of dark fruits. Almost sort of reminds me of J.W. Lee's Vintage Harvest, actually. Taste, of course, is huge malt, as well with extremely modest hops that you kind of have to search for after the finish. Mouthfeel is quite heavy, even with the 8% abv well concealed. Not exactly syrupy, but close. A very well crafted Scotch Ale. As good or better than some Scottish produced wee-heavies I've tried."
"Mouthfeel is Medium. Drinkability is decent."
"This was one of my frist craft beers I had ever tried and my second keg in my kegorator. I haven't had this in a while and I can't figure out why."
"pretty good beer."
"Poured a seethru murky copper with a one-finger tan head that left some lacings. A caramel and bready malt smell with some herbal hops, but all is very lowkey and basic. A thin, smooth and slightly sticky beer with a good caramel and bread malt base that has some residual sweetness and chewiness. Some minor floral hops balance the beer and give it a slight herbal, dry finish. Also some dry fruitiness in the beer such as apples and pears (maybe grape). A good beer but a little thin/weak for a wee heavy."
"The aroma is malty with caramel, nuts, yeast, butter, and grain husks. The appearance is dark amber with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma with a little bit of a card board taste but not much. The palate is smooth. Overall a fairly good beer."
"Like a scotch ale lite."
"D - A bit rich and lacking complexity which would help increase the drinkability. Despite a couple areas for improvement, the beer is certainly a nice example of this style and I'll easily finish the entire bomber with no assistance. Tonight I'm pairing it with a Manchego cheese and this seems to be working well. The slight nutty, tart character of this sheep's milk cheese compliments the rich, malty ale and helps make for a more interesting session."
"D: Easy, but it doesn't settle the desire for BEER."
"For an Scotch Ale of this strength, the body seems too thin and flaccid. It's needs more brawn to prevent the coup that the alcohol wreaks. Texturally, it's not where it needs to be, and while most of the other tangible elements are in place, it proves a significant detriment to this beer."
"Drinkability: While this beer has some nice aspects, it lacks the peat and full bodied mouthfeel of the top flight wee heavies and, in failing to disguise the alcohol, these flaws are accentuated"
"Not bad, but not the best."
"One to two finger head of thick, super-tiny bubbles, not a great deal of lacing. Clear, unblemished amber red with more brown than orange, transparent in spite of hue depth. Sweet caramel, molasses inspired nose, cinnamon and clove spice, thick milk chocolate, candied oranges and then the hops kick in big time, punctures your nostrils with grass and dried black tea leaves. Full-bodied, features sweet plum, black grape, cherry fruit to frame the mouth entry. The carbonation makes itself known very quickly, chops up the sugariness even as post-fruit toffee and caramel notes appear. Leaves a lot of mouth weight through the mid-palate when its hoppy bite careens in with pink grapefruit, pea leaves and pine. Keeps churning through the finish, extra energy to spare. Nice smoky finish."
"Kilt Lifter pours a dark amber with a thick head that dissolves very quickly into nothing. Carbonation is there but no lacing occurs. The aroma is all malt, with hints of toffee and caramel. Upon tasting, I got pure malt at first, with doughyness and a sweet character that remnded me of fresh maple sap. There was a nutty profile on the finish, with a light mellowing hop finish. This beer is full-bodied, and does not take no for an answer. I was hoping for better, but this was a fun experience. Moylan's has yet to dissappoint me."
"Well-balanced and soft, this is a good beer to drink through on a early spring evening."
"An OK brew for what its worth, but I'll stick to Moylan's hoppy brews instead of reaching for any more of this weakened attempt to lift my palate kilt."
"D. Deceptively smooth despite the abv. Good brew to have on hand."
"Copper/amber pour, a bit light, with a whitish head. Strong malt aroma, some sweet and light alcohol. Sweet malt, caramel/toffee, a little oak barrelly smokiness. Just a tinge of the alcohol in the finish. Very little bitterness, which there shouldn't be much in a scotch ale. Could have been a little heavier bodied, but not too light. For a four dollar 22 ounce heavier ale, I thought this was great."
"Overall impression: Interesting beer, dangerously drinkable considering the ABV."
"M/D: this is a very drinkable beer and was very good. its a bit on the malty side for this style but still really good"
"I'd be interested in trying this on tap rather than bottled. I have a feeling it would be quite a bit better."
"Pours a hazy copper with a smallish tan head. Aroma is moderately sweet caramel, brown sugar and spicy hops. Flavor is brown sugar, caramel and light spicy hoppiness. Smooth medium-full body, sticky texture. Finishes long and sweet with some alcohol warming."
"This beer pours a light brown color with reddish hues. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly minimal lacing. The aroma is of burnt caramel, and hints of figs. The taste is of caramel, and cough syrup. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, with a watery texture...way to light for the style. Overall, there are so many better Scotch Ales out there for me to revisit this one."
"Oh yeah, that nutty character really comes to the front on the palate. It's quite sweet and sticky, with overtones of walnuts, hazelnuts, a bit of a smokey character and a stab on the back of some dark, zesty fruit. It's just a little spike at the end of the middle palate. Finish is quite full-bodied and syrupy. I quite like this, but I also can't really place it. A very well-defined palate, and full marks for uniqueness, but the flavours are a bit too gritty for me to slam this down and rub my stomach with glee. Mouthfeel is a bit thick but pleasant. Not all that drinkable just for sheer thick full-bodiedness."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and bready, slightly clingy. All of it combined makes for a good beer, but I'd have a hard time drinking them end to end."
"D: Very easy to drink if you strong beers. Complexity is there, but not overbearing. At 8.0% ABV, not a session beer. Well, it could be for me, but that's a different story. :)"
"The label does not lie, this beer is a meal. Clear brown pour with minimal tan head. Aroma of caramel, malt, and some nuts. Lots of earthy, peat-like flavor, as if the beer was finished in a scotch barrel. The caramel and nuttiness there throughout compliment it nicely. A really good beer, especially if you don't plan on doing anything afterward."
"Overall- A delicious Wee Heavy and 1 that would be enjoyed by anyone who doesn't care for this style."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, appearance is a deep amber color with a tan frothy head. The smell is malty, sweet with a touch of alcohol. Taste is pretty smooth and sweet, then you get a slight kick of alcohol. This beer is medium bodied and very easy to drink for the alcohol content. I would definitely recommend."
"Not a bad beer, just not what I expected from Moylan's. A bit corny on the nose, very drinkable, goes down easy nothing offensive. Dark ruby colour, a bit of expected peat. Not harsh, but lacking in overall flavor for a ""wee heavy"". Add a bit of malt and this beer may become special."
"Copper amber with medium head that fades somewhat quickly to a ring. Spots of lacing down the glass. Smell is of faint sweetness. Candied caramel, light fruit and biscuity bread. Taste is nice. Good sweetness that isn't overdone. Caramel, some brown sugar, light grain. A grape like flavor and possibly some apple as well. A little bready in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with lower carbonation. Overall a pretty drinkable brew. I could surely have a couple with no problem. Thanks goes to Scoobydank for the extra in a recent trade."
"This is one beer that will...ahem...lift your kilt. Plenty of malty goodness with an array of flavors to taste. I continue to be impressed by Moylan's brews."
"D: A decent take on the style. Little hefty, as it will be, but a decent tasting beer and something worth going back for another."
"Fairly clear medium amber colour with a light beige cap composed of fine and coarse bubbles. Some lacing. Malty and fruity aroma, a bit vinous with a hint of alcohol. Some caramel and toffee too. Mild bitterness with more malt in the flavour, lots of caramel sweetness. Fruit was more muted than in the aroma, but was still quite noticeable with some pear and grape character. Mild alcohol flavour and warmth in the finish. Maybe a bit more than medium bodied, sort of light for a scotch ale. Smooth though, with fine carbonation. An easy drinker for sure, though it seems to miss the mark for the style somewhat."
"Drinkability is fairly good. For me, it's a bit on the sweet side."
"Poured into a tulip, dark bronze/brown color with decent head that fell quickly but left some ok lacing. Sweet malty aroma, some chocolate notes, a bit of dark fruit, and some caramel. Taste of burnt caramel, some baker's chocolate, Tootsie Rolls, slightly roasty and a light bitterness. Starts out sweet and finished bone dry. Powdery, yeasty mouthfeel, with some average carbonation. Alcohol is pretty well-hidden at 8%. A nice Scotch Ale, but have had much better from this side of the Atlantic. It's no Founders."
"D: Decent drinkability, boozy, dry though should be experienced in a slow and respectable fashion. Progressively gets more easier and enjoyable as the drink progress."
"Nice. Very pleasant and sweet, but very thick, chewy and heavy. Too much for more than one, but hearty in small doses."
"About two weeks before I started writing reviews, I had a Kilt Lifter for the second time. Couldn't stop talking about it for at least a week. Just blew me away. When I decided to start writing reviews - this was one of the first I got. After every sip, I couldn't wait for the next. Try to take your time, as you should with beers like this - but it's tough. I wouldn't say the flavors are complex, but very distinct. Think of a caramel apple - and you'll taste one in this beer. But I wouldn't say this was a sweet beer at all. Light on the hops, and definitely not bitter. Oddly enough, by the end - as the last few drops had warmed up - it maintained that original flavor. I love this beer - maybe you will too..."
"This scotch ale pours a slightly hazy, orange-amber color with a whipped cream-like head of pale tan that is persistent. Sheets of lacing stick to the inner rim of the glassware as the head of foam slowly subsides. The nose betrays what makes this beer interesting - there is a subtle earthiness that leaves a slight twang in the nose, not unlike a single-malt scotch whiskey. Dancing around the base of roasted caramel malt and delicate fruitiness from the yeast, the distinct aroma of peat is revealed. The palate is likewise interesting, yet somewhat lighter and thinner than I'd hoped for. A decent backbone of roasted malts intermingle with the earthy peat notes you'd expect from a scotch ale/wee heavy. There is a faint astringency present here as well, lending to the dry character of this beer. Dryer than what I've come to expect for the style as well. Only light bitterness and virtually no detectable alcohol despite the 8% ABV. In flavor, this beer has more in common with a Scottish ale than it does with a Scotch ale, to my taste. My biggest knock on this beer is it's relatively thin mouth feel and slight over-carbonation. These don't combine to make a bad beer, by any means, but they do make this particular beer deviate from the style parameters somewhat. I'd suggest letting this one warm to cellar/ambient temperature before drinking, as this seems to help round the beer out just a bit. Over all, an enjoyable ""scotch light"" ale. If you're not accustomed to tasting peat in a beer, this is a good place to start since the peat character is kept subdued. Worth a try, for sure."
"D- Not bad, just not something I would purchase again."
"D - This is a very nice scotch ale. I want to try mre beers from Moylan's."
"Don't know that it really reaches ""wee heavy"" status, despite the alcohol level, but comes close enough. A nice malt-accented brew though!"
"Yeah."
"I don't know if this was a bad bottle or what, but what a disappointment. The smell of cabbage and celery just dominated the aroma from the moment I opened it, had to end up dumping the remainder down the drain."
"Decent carbonation, but a bomber at 8% makes this a decent night cap."
"On tap at Fatheads in Pittsburgh. Dark brown with a creamy head. Smells and tastes of scotch whiskey, smoked wood, and some sort of licorice taste. This is a style that I've always found kind of strange, but it is a solid beer with a lot of different dark flavors. A lot of alcohol, and not really sessionable."
"This is the second review of a Scottish Style Ale tonight. I had a smaller 12 oz. bottle last week and enjoyed it so much that I decided to go back and spring for the larger 22 oz. bottle. I poured it into my crystal tasting snifter and prepared to enjoy. The heard was rich, creamy and opaque. It quickly dissolved, but a fine ring of bubbles remained around the rim of the glass. The aroma was heavenly, a sweet mix of roasted malts and caramel, with a hint of alcohol. The color of the beer was a deep amber/ruby. There was also a good bit of lacing on the inside of the glass. The taste was very smooth, rich and complex. You can definitely taste the roasted malts, with a moderate amount of hopes in the background. This beer is a bit on the dry side, but not overly boozy with a good body. It is definitely the best Scottish Ale I've tasted as of yet...I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try a top notch Scottish Ale."
"A good effort and a nice beer on a cool night. Warming and hearty ale."
"nicely flavorful beer, warms up nicely, Just a solid drinking beer that pairs well with my whisky of choice"
"I'd get this again. Good effort."
"Appearance is hazy copper brown with red hues and a creamy tan head. Good lacing. Full malty nose that's earthy, musty, grassy, and a hint of peated smoke. Flavor has tons of fruity and grassy malts with notes of chocolate and toffee. Kind of like a Heath Bar. Medium mouthfeel way too thin for a wee heavy. This is a very tasty beer but I would characterize this as a Scotch Ale rather than wee heavy."
"Drinkability is decent at 8%, but probably wouldn't drink more than one of these."
"Scarlet red hue. Slight haze. Thin beige head. Moderate amounts of lace. Nice malty nose. Has that ""peaty"" aroma with earthy and dank malt tones. Flavor is actually kind of weak for the style. Light bready malt tones. Some yeast sludge flavors. Slight hints of the 8% octane level. Not much else. Mouthfeel is a little lifeless. Not much CO2 or body to it. This is a disappointment from this brewery."
"Compared to the other Scotch Ales out there, this one feels bigger, but not necessarily better."
"The body is closer to full than moderate. A light carbonation helps the malt out. This one is a little rough more me to rate. There are a lot of good things but some things are missing. Mainly the kettle/maltiness. But still enjoyable to drink."
"D - I know what I'll be picking up next time I'm looking for a wee heavy. This is really nice and highly recommended. Hope the beer I have in fermenter is half as good!"
"Lighter color than most scotch ales unless I am confusing scotch with scottish. This was not brown but dark orange. It smelled like a strong ale and almost reminded me of a barleywine. Taste was ok but I am not sure I would revisit this again. There was just something thin about it."
"Nicely drinkable, despite the abv, this one is a smooth drinking and pleasant Scotch Ale. I'm enjoying the lingering bready aftertaste well after I've finished it."
"D: Not a bad beer, but nothing exceptional, lots of better examples out there, one is enough and not one I'll seek out again"
"Not a bad scotch ale from Moylan's, also cool to see a beer like this available in six packs now, name is pretty funny as well, might drink again if I am in the mood for this type of thing, worth trying"
"Way to go, again, Moylans! Damn glad this is now available in IL (next to STL)."
"A good beer, but nothing I would drink regularly or by itself."
"I am not sure how to get more of this because I don't rememeber where I got it (Colorado?). If I could find more I would love to cellar a few away."
"The drinkability is ok not a brew to seek out, but worth a try if this is your style. Prosit, MK"
"I am a fan of Scotch Ales and this does not let you down."
"Tough to finish this bomber. I do admit though, this beer is probably far different fresh and I look forward to the opportunity to try it again."
"Would not recomend to anyone who loves scotch ale"
"D: Easy to drink, a higher ABV at 8% keeps me from drinking more than one."
"Poured a hazy reddish copper, then became clear with hardly any foam. The smell was of a sweet fruity nature, with a hint of malts. The taste was sweet creamy malt with fruit and had a sort of a nutty flavor. Its an average Scottish Ale. Pikes Kiltlifter is GREAT."
"D- For 8% this bomber went down quickly, almost too quickly. A decent Scotch Ale style beer."
"The first sip is decent, sweetly malty, woody, and a bit musky, but definitely one-dimensionally sweet and thick. It also dramatically worsens after the first sip and a definite, faintly vinegary alcohol note soon takes over, along with meat and gravy. The alcoholic harshness soon dominates, especially with any food. It's one-dimensional, overly alcoholic, and very rough, being mostly sweet, alcoholic, thick, and vinegary."
"First scotch ale should be interesting. Poured a nice ruby copper tea color. white head dissipates quickly to almost nothing. Smell Carmel malts, butterscotch, black lickerish interesting? Taste; like most beers for is similar to the smell. Malts are more pronounced overall not bad. I was expecting something a little more on the thick side but this brew was very drinkable. For me the downside to the brew was the texture a little to watery in my opinion but not enough to ruined the enjoyment of the taste and smell."
"Drinkability: Ayyye, noh' bad for a California interpretation of ab auld sod style. I've had a few better Scotch-style ales from America, as well as the source, but this one is pretty tasty. I'd drink it again, preferably with some neeps and tatties."
"Pours a dark copper color and small head. Carbonation is low. I don't get much hop or malt aroma. Taste is sweet, malty, and rich. Hop profile is low, really get them in the finish. Mouth feel is a little on the wee heavy side-rich and thick. Drinkability is high for a 8%."
"found this beer at my local beer store that was offering it at a tasting. After a small sample I was hooked. Bought every bottle they had. it is smooth, buttery, not too hoppy and just enough ABV to make the evening that much nicer. the 22 oz bottle makes its a definite double thought before drinking, but once you pop the top, it is so simple to finish."
"D- I wouldn't have it again if it were offered, and I surely wouldn't reccommend it."
"A deep, thick or slightly viscous amber cognac color. Makes me think of the crust of Jewel brnd white bread. Looks toasty. No bubbles really and no head. The first sniff is a little creamy. Warm toast with hints ofmaple toasty malts. The front of the tongue is a roasted but mostly toasted malt. The smoked, bready malts become more apparent in the middle. Along with the slighly oily palate. The finish tastes a little burnt, with biscuits, cream, and caramel. The palate is a sweet, intense mla bomb with a very well integrated alcoholic warmth."
""
"D_Not so sure about this. I am enjoying this, but once again it kind of is a mystery. The label says specifically to store in the fridge, I bought it room temo and kept it in the closet room temp. Maybe I let it go bad, but I did the same with their other beers recieved through a BIF. Who knows, I probably won't be going back again but wouldn't be upset to be served it."
"reddish brown with an off white, almost tan, head that didn't hold too well or leave very much lace. nose was georgeous. hazelnut, chocolate, cream, sasparilla, sassafrass. tasted like nutty root beer with a faint boozy finish. very interesting, and good interpretation of the style. mouthfeel could have been a little creamier, and finish could have been a little longer."
"Dark, slightly murky brown/ reddish color with a thin and creamy off-white head. The aroma is what rocked my world. It was constantly changing from filberts to Brazil nuts, to chocolate milk, and then finally settling on toffee and chocolate. Flavor is big up on the nutty malt character with a hint of roast and a small dash of alcohol barely poking through. medium-to-full body with a nutty and mildly hoppy finish. Very mildly hoppy finish."
"Eric"
"My first Scotch Ale...and this one's a winner. Nothing to dislike about this brew. I could imagine this one going down quite well with a nicely grilled and seared steak dinner! (Perhaps next time...and there will definitely be a next time!)"
"An OK beer, but not anything to revisit."
"I wouldn't mind another, just not real soon."
"I found that this beer single handedly reaffirmed my love affair with scotch ales. The color is nice, a deep brown with some orange hues to it. The hops really come through in the smell layered on top of the roasted/caramelized barely. I found this to be a very hoppy bitter beer, which I absolutely love. The caramel and biscuit notes really help to balance the flavors with the high ABV and hoppiness. Fantastic!"
"CHEERS!"
"Drinks very easy, a bit dry; otherwise a nice Wee Heavy"
"Pours a slightly fogged deep amber/brown. Nose is strong malts with a sweeter earthy edge to it. A lot of it smells like grape soda. Flavor is sweet yes. Has a nice earthy edge to it, but it lacks a real complexity that would make it interesting. Feel has a low carbonation to it and a slick liquid. Overall this is a good wee heavy, but not great by any means. It doesn't totally suck, but it won't blow you away either."
"This is one of those beers that needs to have its recipe reformulated. There's a flaw in every facet of this beer, and it seems only tolerable when ice cold. Compare this with Alesmith's Wee Heavy and you can tell it's very obviously deficient. Not one of Moylan's better beers."
"Drinkability - this is a decent ale, but not a great one because I think it is a bit subdued flavorwise for a wee heavy. Also high abv limits sessionability."
"D - Not my cup of beer. Maybe the style, but I think it just comes up short."
"Drinkability: This is pretty easy to drink, but the noticable alcohol would stop me after the second glass. Otherwise, due to the taste and the body, I would be able to fly through a bomber of this and start working on another."
"D - This style is extremely hit or miss with me (and in Scotland I think I have a low batting average). If anything is too pronounced - the brew is offensive. This one pulled it off. Moylan's pleases me again. It is an easy wee heavy to drink and it is pleasant. The brewery is close, I will definitely have to check it out sometime."
"An enjoyable easy drinking brew. Very smooth and sweet. A little light on the mouthfeel and the smokey flavor I expect in a scotch ale. Strong fruit character. Be sure to let this one warm a bit as that is when the flavor really comes out."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Rich and decadent, the frothy texture in the mouth accentuates all of the flavors well. It goes down just a bit harshly in the throat, otherwise it's easy. Overall, it's on par for the style though it lacks the lingering, sweet malty finish I've come to love about a Scotch Ale."
"D- awesome scotch, great on cask, warms well"
"Cheers!"
"Usually have this during the colder months but couldn't resist buying this today as a change of pace from the Summer ales/lagers I have been consuming lately. Truly a treat."
"This is a one and out experience for me. I think it's well made but not something I want a lot of."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Good carbonation. Dry, raisin flavored aftertaste with a hint of bitterness. This malty brew is good, but I don't think I would ever grab one myself since there are better examples of the style out there."
"Overall, I'm more interested in trying some other variations on this style. I'm not totally sure I like it, but it is still a quality beer."
"D- Well balanced Scotch Ale, nice caramel malt feel with subtle roastiness and short finish. Easy to drink, alcohol feel quite subtle despite 8% ABV. This is a solid entry in the Scotch Ale genre, but not quite top-tier."
"D: I am not a huge fan of this style and after drinking Kilt Lifter I am still not. The biggest absence was the subtle caramel malt flavor. Kilt Lifter was just really sweet. I didn't find it to be drinkable."
"Not bad, but not my favorite among an otherwise spectacular lineup. Moylan's and Marin Brewing are great for remembering that malt is an important component of beer - love that house style that leads with malt, even in the super-hopped examples. But this Scotch Ale doesn't rise above the pack."
"Very good beer. Nice head and retention. Great malty smell with some alcohol. Flavor is good, very malty. Caramel and chocolate malts. Alcohol is kept in balance. Malts cling fairly well, a little dry aftertaste.. However, this beer is very easy to drink. Nice and sessionable."
"Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is malty and a bit fruity. Malt dominates the flavor and is well balanced with hops. Perhaps a bit too well balanced for the style, this seems like a very American (read hoppy) version of a Scotch ale. That being said, it is a pretty tasty beer. Definitely worth a try."
"This reddish-amber ale pours a think tan head that thins to bit of a crown. The smell is a bit nut like with too heavy a vegetable scent. The taste didn't catch me much, just maltiness and a little bitterness. The mouthfeel was pleasant, but a bit thin. Not very drinkable for my tastes."
"this didn't lift my kilt.. nor did it fit the bill. not terrible but terribly average in the most important departments"
"Goes fantastic with bacon wrapped scallops....Enjoy"
"Notes - A decent scotch ale, certainly not the best around, but solid."
"I have enjoyed the Moylans bews I have had and this was no different but not earth shattering,poured a chill hazed amber/brown with a thinner off white head leaving spotty lace.Deep fruit aromas with some molasses and brown sugar almost like a Xmas fruit cake,not as full bodied as most Wee Heavy styles I have come across but it adds to its drinkability.Flavors are on the sweeter side with brown sugar and alcohol dipped dark fruit up front as it warms a little a light leafy hop presence is noticed but it is there only in token form and honestly for the style thats all it should be.A quaffing big Scottish style ale not bad not bad at all."
"Acquired from goodbyeohio in ""These go to eleven...a BiF"""
"D- It is good. Interesting new flavors and quite a bit different from the other one I tried (Alesmith Wee Heavy). I'm sure that this isn't as of good of an example of the style but I prefer it."
"All in all, this is a tasty and drinkable Scotch ale. Could use a little more carbonation, but certainly was not an issue as I consumed the bomber easily."
"This beer drinks very well... but the 8% will knock you out for sure. Respect this beer and enjot it slowly!"
"A fun offering, maybe a secondary intro to someone recntly intoduced to the craft beer world."
"This beer reminds me of how a beer would taste with a small dollop of malt syrup or honey in it. Not a bad beer, but doesn't really work for me. Maybe this would have been a better beer if the brewers didn't have their hearts set on 8%, or were willing to use more fermentable materials to get there."
"Tasty beverage!"
"A very nice Scotch ale that is worth a try if you get a chance to try it. Worth the purchase."
"Pours a brilliantly clear red-mahogany. Two finger off-white head; dense, and shows good retention. Produces a few specs of lasting lacing. Toasted crystal malt nose, with some faint smoked notes. Biscuity malt and dextrin sweetness upfront, followed by deeply toasted crystal and a very mellow oak aged flavor. Drying aftertaste, very light on hop bitterness, but the mild oak taste helps bring a very good balance to the overall flavor. Alcohol is very well concealed, especially considering it's thin body and low carbonation. Finishes semi-dry with lots of residual caramel and woody flavor, but no detectable booze. The lighter mouthfeel allows an excellent drinkability, on the other hand, the flavor is fairly weak for a Wee-Heavy."
"Decent Scotch Ale with a well balanced, smooth flavor. Palate was disappointing: I'll have to review another bottle to see if mine was simply flat."
"Extremely smooth mouthfeel starts off a nicely balanced ale. Mildly sweet upfront with muted undertones of peat, blossoming into a rich malt finish highlighted by ripe dark fruits. Finish is slightly bitter and dry."
"Last swigs: A Scotch has to do some tricks to stand out and this was is a basic brew. I'd seek other Scotch styles. Overall not bad but doesn't leave me wanting more."
"Some strong , tasty Scotch Ale from beautiful Marin county...Cheers!"
"Pours a deep, orange to amber color. Decent carbonation level. Low aroma-malty and a tad sweet. Sort of ""wet carboard"" like. Malty flavors dominate. Some caramel flavor. Trace of alcohol flavors. Moderate mouthfeel-not as full as some wee heavies I have tried. Above average drinkability. Just doesnt hit the mark as well as I expected. Worth you trying to decide for yourself."
"The beer pours a hazy amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of roasted and bisquit malts. It's is sweet and toastey with a breadlike aroma. The taste is decent. It has a wonderful toasted malt flavor that is breadlike and warm in the finish. It's not as malty as expected, but quite complex and full of flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I prefer Scotch ales with a peated edge, but this has a mellow bisquity flavor that's easy to drink."
"My cousin brought this bottle back to PA from CA and we shared it at a wedding over the weekend. The beer poured a brown color with some redish tones and a slight off-white head and good lacing. The aroma was malty, sweet, a bit toasted. The taste is equally malty and sweet but enjoyable. The body is a bit heavy but very drinkable."
"Bomber bottle, without freshness indication, pours typical almond amber, slightly cloudy, with a slight tan head and not leaving much if any lacing. Minor malty nose. Smooth, malty brew, decent sessioner if this style is your thing. For me this style is dull and this version lives up to my preconcieved notions...fairly dull, well crafted and malty smooth, but dull. The best thing I can say for scotch ale is that it works well as a cooking or marinating liquid."
"This scotch ale drinks quite nicely, and matchs the style well. A beer that I will return to again."
"Moylans Kilt Lifter is very drinkable, but I imagine that the 8.00% ABV would catch up with you after a while. This might be one of my favorite beers. I've got to try some more Wee Heavys to see how they are... Off to Scottland."
"The odd thing about this beer is that it tasted like wet wood. And I liked it. Lots of sticky candy flavors too--toffee and brown sugar cookies. Medium body that was slightly cloying."
"Drinkability? 8% ABV....I don't think so..plus very sweet. Nice beer to finish the night off with. It may be difficult finishing the bomber, but not because I don't like it...just because I've reached that point of total satisfaction and contentment. Amazingly at 8% I don't notice the alcohol at all...at least not in the taste or mouthfeel."
"Dark mahogany color topped by a thick light tan head. Very pretty beer. The nose has lots of rich malt. Pralines, toffee, dark roasted caramel, a little caramel-apple. The taste has more caramel, its like youre biting into a Brachs caramel treat, light citrus bitterness midway through the drink. Finish has a little fig and sweet apple. Smooth mouth feel, almost slick. Very drinkable. This may be the best American version of a wee-heavy Ive had so far."
"Da: Good stuff if you can't get ahold of any Belhaven."
"All in all, this Moylan's offering was quite drinkable. A pleasant brew that's worth a try."
"Overall a very good brew. I'm happy I was able to enjoyed this staple of the West Coast and I would buy it again."
"drinkablity: this is a sipper. that said I've brown bagged this one in the park, it works for that too. Just one of those beers, you say ""ah kilt lifter"" and throw it in the basket and just kick back and enjoy it, no worries. A beer that will be bought time and time again. That, and it's the scotch ale i can find with any regularity."
"Drinkability/notes: A wonderfully pleasant example, quite excellent, and worthy of the effort to obtain it."
"Overall Impression: Massively drinkable, even for a style I dont particularly care for. This is a solid brew; Ive nothing but respect for the brew masters. They earned those metals."
"This is a big bold american style scotch ale."
"How does one score a wee heavy that's tasty, but falls outside the lower bounds of the style? Oh the hell with it, this is good beer and I'll treat it as such. Kilt Lifter doesn't lift my kilt, but it is improving as I get deeper into the bomber. Perhaps I'll change into clean underwear just in case."
"I really enjoyed this ale from Moylan's. It pours a pretty thick, dark copper colour with a thin head. Thick and syrupy appearance. Lots of caramel and sugar in the nose. Also fruity and toasty. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Taste was a medley of sweet caramel malts, with some fruity flavours and an earthy touch. Aftertaste is sweet and alcoholic. Would've liked some smokiness to it. Overall, pretty good."
"Quite a nice beer. So far I am impressed with moylans offerings!"
"This is a malty beer that has a stout chocolate/coffee type finish...very sweet malt taste. Appearance for an ale of this type left something to be desired. I gave it an average ranking but it was leaning towards below average. hardly any lacing of the glass and the head was almost non existent. Drinkability was Good. One of those beers where I could sit down and have a few and the last one is as smooth and easy to drink as the first....very smooth beer with slick mouthfeel."
"Deep reddish mahogany. Thin, barely there head. Smell: pine needles, caramel, hint of butterscotch. Taste: rich spread of simple sugary malts upfront that deepen throughout the middle, taking on some buttery hints and a noticeable but hushed zip of hops in the background. Have they changed the recipe to include more hops? This is better than I remember. Middling carbonation, heavy mouthfeel that feels good to me."
"Drinkability- May need to try this one again in the future. Still can't get a hold of describing the flavor, even though it's still in my damn mouth from last night!"
"This one pours a brown color with a tall head that has good retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is mild, but there is some peat and caramel malt in there. The flavor is not as strong as expected, but it has some peat and some sweet malt flavors in there. The body seems a bit thin, but it's still enjoyable and very drinkable."
"The name implies going wee-wee a lot from drinking so much of it, right?"
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing. It pours a dark murkey brown color with a big bubbly head that falls to a finger over the beer. The nose is caramel. I don;t get much more than that. The flavor is actually slightly smokey caramel with a hint of fruity sweetness in there as well. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, this is not a bad brew at all. I'd like a little more body and even a little more smokeyness."
"This brew came in a 10 oz. goblet which i didn't expect and hence pissed me off. I think the barman should have told me. Similar strength brews like Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye come in a full pint at their pub. Anyway's it was a deep copper with good cask clarity. Head retention was not good and lacing was sparse. Nice malty aroma that had a smokey note. Vey malty taste profile with same subtly smokey notes, some roasted tones and dark fruit. Smooth as silk. A bit chewy on the mouthfeel. This beer was a bit too potent to have another, at least on an empty stomach."
"Bottle. Yipes, super sweet and sticky. Kahlua, peat, with a hit of soy. Malty and very sweet. The flavour was one dimentionally sweet. Perhaps scotch ales aren't my favourite style, but i didn't like this one in particular. Moylans made some other styles which i preffered much more."
"Pours a brownish-red with copious streaming bubbles and a tiny, fleeting light tan head. Sweet malt and a mild smokiness noticable on the nose. Slight, but noticable hop spice. Palate has a grainy flavor with some sweet malt making an appearance. Slightly fruity character. No smoke or hops noticable in the palate. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but with good sweetness and flavor. A decent beer, but not up to what I expected. My least favorite beer from this brewery. Give it a try if you want, but grab their IIPA first."
"From the 22 oz. bottle. Clear, deep amber to mohogany color. Thin tan head disappeared very quickly. Caramel and fruity smells. Rich caramel and toffee flavors immediately, giving way to some slight piney hop flavor. Not much bitterness at all. Very malt heavy. A bit thin, low carbonation. I found this to be pleasant. Not the best scotch ale, but a respectable one."
"22oz bomber. Pours a hazy glowing ruby with a thin wisp of dark lace clinging to the edges. Aroma is robust and malty, hinting at dark fruits and pineapple. The alcohol is slightly noticeable in the nose, less in the flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, while leaving a ""spritz"" on the tongue. Not as complex in the flavor as I had anticipated, but tasty nonetheless. Despite the alcohol being not as present on the palate, it warms the body up nicely. Flavor borders on the sweet, though is contrasted with spicy notes, both clove-like and hoppy. Not one that lifts meh kilt, but worth a stop, definitely. A good session Scotch, if you will. Thanks to kingslender14 for the bottle."
"Drinkability is very solid, east flowing and smooth. Not greatly memorable but solidly crafted beer."
"A light brown/mahogany color, hazy, with a tan/yellow head (that dies quickly). Light sticky lacing. Aroma is of malt and caramel, fresh and grassy. Flavor is sweet and malty with a light tart/dry hoppiness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and effervescent with a dominant sweetness and a well-balanced, light hop finish. A different representation of a Scotch Ale, and not over-hopped. Worth a try."
"The beer dispenses from the 22-ounce brown bottle a clear mahogany color with the head portly in size and a semi-creamy light tan, the residual lace a thin curtain to drape the glass. Nose has a hint of hops, sweet malt dominates with some fresh clean caramel tones also noticed, the start is rich in malt and sweet with the top moderate to almost full in its feel to the palate. Finish is benign in carbonation and the hops superbly spicy with the aftertaste dry and long lasting, a fine beer from a great brewery."
"Well, just not a great Scotch Ale...just doesn't seem to have the right maltiness and balance for the style. Still, I'm glad I tried it, but I just wouldn't have this one again."
"From a bomber this poured a slightly hazed amber/ruby color. Huge and everlasting frothy head topped the beer off. The head looks like Swiss cheese. Highly carbonated. The aroma gives off a slightly sweet maltiness, with soft caramelized malts and a slight smokiness. The taste has lightly caramelized malts in the forefront with a pleasant peat-like smokiness and some fermented fruits following just behind. Nice malt tang in this one. Medium to full bodied and full of soft and sweet flavors. Surely enjoyable. 4s across the board."
"I'm not sure this beer is a great example of the style, but it is good on its own, no matter what the label says."
"A drinkable brew. This is mild in flavor for a Scotch ale but worth while."
" A pretty good Scottish style ale, though not the best around. Definitely worth a try by fans of the style."
"Pours a dark copper color with a very thick beige head that eventually dissipates to nothingness. Decent lacing. The aroma has a smokey character, along with malt and caramel. Rich bodied and on the carbonated side (at first), with a strong malt presence. There are also sweet caramel and chocolate flavors, along with a hint of nuts that shine through as it warms. The finish is clean and malty throughout. This is a fairly good Scotch Ale that seems unbalanced at first, but only if it is still too cold."
"22 ounce bottle."
"This was a decent scotch ale from the folks at Moylans. This brew was a real gusher, practically exploding all over the place after I popped the crown off. After I got the head under control, this brew was a dark garnet colour with a huge white head. After the head died a bit, I started to drink this concoction. The aromas were very sweet, malty, and alcoholic. The taste is very similar to the aromas. The mouthfeel is creamy, but a bit watery and the drinkability is decent. Nice..."
"Drinkability  This went down well and was a pleasure to drink."
"Coppered amber color. Creamy off-white head with nice retention. Aroma features an upfront fruity maltiness that exhibits notes of candied apples, caramel, and toffee. Toasted malt, more candied apples, the previously noted characters of caramel and toffee, along with just a hint of chocolate appear on the palate. Nice, sweet Wee-Heavy with a clear emphasis on the sweet, candied apple-like malt. Only the faintest hint of hops hit the palate on the finish. Very smooth and clean in the mouth and on the tongue. Full-bodied and sweet, masking its strong alcohol content very well. A nice, warming strong Scotch ale that drinks quite nicely. Recommended."
"This beer finally made it to Ohio. It poured a dark amber color and formed a small off white head that left trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and toast/biscut. A flavor of malt and caramel with a slight presence of alcohol. The finish was medium in texture and had a burnt astrigent feel to it. Not the best that this brewer offers but not a bad ale."
"Ah, sometimes you find surprises in the most unexpected places! I hadnt heard of this brewery before, but saw this beer on a recent trip to California and picked up. Typical Scottish ales dont impress me much, but this was a *strong* one, and it pulled off its strength very well. Deep amber in color, with a huge, billowing light tan head. Aroma is dominated by sweet malt, combined with (surprisingly) an almost banana-like fruitiness. Flavor starts of with big toasty malt. An apple-like fruitiness becomes apparent mid-palate (with still more traces of that surprising banana), though only after ones mouth has had time to become accustomed to the peaty malt. Alcohol lends a robust spiciness to the finish  a bit too present at first, though once its worked its magic on you, funny, you dont seem to care much anymore. Significant hop flavor and bitterness to the finish, with a long lasting, nutty aftertaste. Yummmm."
"Glowing red beer. Modest head but it flies away back to the homeland, I guess. Smells sweet. Can detect the alcohol in the aroma, but it's still pleasant. Tastes malty. Intriguing effect on the tongue. The sweetness lingers as a nice aftertaste. Definitely helps the drinkability as well."
"I think this is a very well crafted and complex Scottish ale. I just find them a little on the sweet side for me. For those of you who enjoy this type of ale more than I do. Cheers! Give this one a try."
"This deep dark complex heavy brew pours with a creamy tan head and wafts a heavy peat smoke and light chocolate roast aroma. The flavor is quite complex with an initial peat smoke and thin alcohol bite. The body is smooth supporting a smoky roasted toffee malt that becomes thinner toward the malty finish. An oak barrel twang jumps up just as the brew clears the palate. Not heavily flavored, but not too thin."
"This beer poured a rusty brown color that was slightly to fairly cloudy appearance in the glass. The head was thin to none, but what was there was tan in color. The aromas were of fresh to slight tart granny smith apples and pears, sweet malt, caramel, yeast and bread. The tastes were of sweet and sour apples, malt, ash, yeast, and alcohol. There was a slight hop finish but was more sourish in nature. Not sure if it was spoiled, there was some carbonation to it. It was drinkable, better as it warmed, which seemed to calm all the flavors down and bring them together. Not a good example of the style IMO, but then again she might have been on her last leg."
"*Well* worth the money, only $3.70 for the Bomber!"
"It poured a hazy reddish copper, then became clear with hardly any foam. The smell was of a sweet fruity nature, with a hint of malts. The taste was sweet creamy malt with fruit and had a sort of a nutty flavor. This is the best scotch ale that I have tasted so far. I will buy this ale again, soon."
"Lives up to it's name. I had my kilt on, and boy did it lift! But seriously, it's a good strong scotch ale. Red in color with a brown/light red head which was about 1/4 inch thick. Clean, refreshing taste of nuts/fruit. No after taste of alcohol at all and goes down smooth. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed."
"better than average, but immediately off the tongue i noticed something not what i expected. this is full of alcohol, taste. the appearance is great, a nice deep ruby, mohagany color, clear and bright, slightly smaller head, but probably the pour, color was a hint off white but stayed after a thinning the entire time. aroma is of sweet malt hint of smoked, little floral and big in alcohol. first sip was WOW, way off what i thought i was getting into, not bad, but not great to style. this beer was nothing but alcohol on the first sip. after letting warm a little bit the malt showed it's head. almost no hop flavor was to be found. it did have a nice sweet, sweet malt though. the body was rather weak, but the mouthfeel was alright. if the body was stronger and a little bit of hop flavor added, not bitter or aroma, but flavor, this would be great. it would balance the alcohol down a bit. way to much alcohol flavor for this style."
"Deep garnet hue w/ excellent clarity. The light beige head settles readily into a thin ring that manages spotty lace. Assertive dark caramel and molasses sweetness hit the nose upfront and are ensued by signature Moylans jackfruit like fruity esters, hints of raisin and peated malt. A mellow floral Goldings hop nose rounds out the aroma. Butterscotch diacetyl emerges as the beer breathes. A combination of date - like and dark caramel sweetness is perceived initially, then fades into a melange of roasted unmalted barley, mild hop bitterness and mild butterscotch. Jackfruit - like esters emerge mid palate, and although odd for a Scotch Ale, provide an enjoyable contrast to the initial sweetness. Unfortunately, the body is a bit thin, and doesn't adequately support the rich malt profile. Hop bitterness is appropriately low, leaving overall balance skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes with light toffee notes slowly fading. Kilt Lifter is quite an enjoyable and unique brew. It's much fruitier than a Scottish Ale or Wee heavy, yet still has a rich malt profile. My only qualm is the relatively weak body. It's definitely worth a try."
"Hazy amber with an orangish-brown tint, topped by a thin but creamy, very light golden-tan head that drops but leaves a good collar and some nice lace. I give them great credit for nailing the fruit and malt character of a true Scottish ale - very nice big fruit (some nice strawberry) with a caramelized maltiness. Medium body with a gentle carbonation lending to a supple, silky mouthfeel. The flavor is well balanced with a bitterness that is omni-present but never really emerges, clearly playing a supporting role to the malt. The maltiness is light and has a lightly burnt or caramelized sugar quality to it. My guess is that they're using mainly pale malt with a small dose of roasted barley that is caramelized in the kettle - rather than using British crystal - although there may be a small percentage. The peat smokiness is most apparent in the finish, but quite restrained amongst a somewhat sticky malt. It becomes much more apparent, however, as you move through the glass eventually leaving you with a light mouthfull of smoke. Very authentic. Not exactly what I would call a ""Scotch Ale", but I won't quibble over the designation other than stating that I'd personally term it a 90 -/- ale. Quite nice. Extremely well balanced and very drinkable. I'd love to try this cask-conditioned."
"It pours a nice brown with a hint of red. The head fades quickly. It smells a bit like a big mashtun full of barley. It also has a nice malty flavor with just enough hops to keep things interesting. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than expected but it is quite drinkable for a 8% abv. I'm going to head back for some more of this when the temperature cools down."
"Draft at the brewpub...First in it's style I have had. Pours a deep dark amber, almost brown with a thin bubbly light tan head. Smelled alot of roasted malt, earthy undertones, very deep rich nose. A slipperly thin taste dominated by the malt, alcohol, and some faint hops to remind you it's Moylans. Also detected some faint fruitlike, plums, berries in the finish. Very complex. This brew intriqued me enought to carry a bottle home. Reminded me of their barley wine, but not as thin and slippery. A very good beer, looking forward to the bottle."
