"O- One of the best scotch ales I've had. Nice smokey flavours and a beautiful warming effect that feels nice on a stormy day. Let it warm up before drinking and you will have yourself an excellent drink. Highly recommended."

"I seem to remember this beer being maltier with less alcohol flavor before they discontinued it and began rebrewing. Maybe thats just nostalgia though. Dark brown, lots of smokey malt. Alcohol comes through in flavor and smell. Oak and whiskey notes. One of my favorite examples of the style with lots of good memories. Glad they brought it back even though I have to drive 5 hours to buy it. Prefer it just under room temp, fridge temp takes away a lot of the flavor."

"Overall:  This is the granddaddy of Scotch ales, and it’s absolutely delicious!  I’ll always have some of this on hand…as long as I can find it.  Highly recommended!"

"Great example of the style, easy drinking, let it warm of course."
"A very deep dark brown with a huge, foamy white head and great lacing. Metallic, lemon, malt scent. Bready. With a dark fruit grape undertone. Lemon a bit of metallic, like the scent. Full bodied and smooth. Nutmeg."

"Excellent Wee Heavy, plenty of malt and smoke in both the aroma and the taste.  Very smooth and easy to drink at 8% with only a slight bitter on the end."
""
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Has a caramel and peat aftertaste. Well worth drinking over and over again. I'm glad to see this beer is back in the states."

"Had this at some random bar in Dunoon in Scotland.  It was a decent Scottish ale - nothing to write home about but ok.  People were unattractive and soccer was on, so that didn't help"

"Overall: This was one of my favorite beers from many years ago and I am thrilled to try it again. It actually tastes somewhat similar to what I remembered but, at the time, I did not recognize that there were Belgian elements to this Scotch Ale. Overall, it is sweet and decadent but not quite cloying. Good stuff."

"Pours dark black with no head and decent lacing. The smell is solid. Sweet and malty with chocolaty notes to the nose. I found the taste a bit underwhelming. It starts a bit bland and watery but finishes sweet. It tastes very sugary, almost like chocolate milk. The aftertaste is unique-- it's sweet. The booze is almost undetectable which is impressive for an 8.0% ABV. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed. It's a solid beer with a sweet finish but the flavor doesn't blow me away. It's worth a try though."

"BBD 9/23/14. Very dark amber pour with a dark ruby cast. Nice head that laces well but diminishes in 3 minutes. Light nose of malt with hints of fig and other dark fruit. Outstanding medium body with a texture that approaches slick. Normal carbonation level. The well balanced and complex flavor profile is a blend of dark fruit that completely masks the 8.0% alcohol, set against a subtle caramel sweetness that is blessed with a touch of smoke. The finish is smooth with a short lived burst of smoke. Glad this outstanding ale is back."

"O - 4.75 - Alright, the real ""overall"" would be 4.625 (math geek) but let me say, even though the world waited for so long, it was worth the wait! If you truly enjoyed McEwan's before, the same joy can be had again. No, now you are older, balder and heavier. You have aged terribly. But McEwan's hasn't. I hope it will be with us for many years to come."

"O: A very smooth Wee Heavy, not as strong as I thought. But this was a cask ale, not from a bottle, so a bit of difference. Would like to try from a bottle."

"This was my second favorite beer (ale) of all time. Traquir house ale was #1, but for the price of 1 Traquir house ale I could buy a 6 pack of this exceptional ale. Extremely heavy taste, wonderful flavo(u)r, not ove-hopped like most microbrews - remember, gotta serve it at 60-65 degrees - slightly chilled - not cold. One word - AWESOME. And it's a meal too! I don't drink anymore but if I did - this is all I'd drink. Beers are boring. A ale takes a lot more work to get it to be fantastic at near room temperature. Nothing gets better than this. I'ts not chewable but comes pretty close ;~)"

"If you prefer malty beers, scotch ales are a great place to start. Those who are not fond of hops will really enjoy them. A good nightcap beer. McEwan's is a good, quality example of the style."

"D - I had been putting this one off for a while, because I really didn't expect to enjoy this one at all; but thankfully I've been pleasantly surprised, to and extent. The dark and rich complexities here are something pretty foreign to me, but I enjoyed them much more than I had intended to. Overall, this was a much better experience than previous tastings led me to believe."
"This beer poured out as a deep brownish amber color with a light tan colored head. The head left a decent lacing behind. The smell of the beer was of burnt wood and some smoke, some whiskey on the nose too. The taste was rather burnt as well, seemed to be very bitey and left a charred dry taste in the back of your mouth. The mouthfeel was on the heavier side which was a nice change of pace. Overall I would drink this one again, if I ever see it around that is."
"Poured from bottle (no date) into thistle glass. Pours clear brown with a ruby tint. It had a nice creamy pinkish head. Very strong aromas of smoke, wood, scotch, and call me crazy but I detected a tropical pineapple/coconut whiff as well. It has a very malty alcoholic taste with a heavy chewey mouthfeel. Good carbonation and drinkable beer."
"Taste has a nice rich creamy mouthfeel to it due to its soft carbonation, the caramel malt has an odd taste to it, like it's been steeped in tea, while unique I'm not sure I'm a big fan of it, no heat on the tongue but I can feel the strength."
"I don't feel like I'm drinking beer when having this. As I've thought to myself many times before:'' Never buying this again'' but I know a year from now, I'll probably buy it again, hoping for the best. I do think I enjoyed it a bit more than last time though."
"Excellent when the weather's cold, also a personal favourite ingredient in a rich beef stew... one bottle for the pot and one for the cook of course ;)"
"I'm still hoarding these so feel free to send me some in trade."
"Drink - Once again, points for originality - but not a beer that is for me. It kind of reminds me of Drambuie liqueur mixed with beer and molasses and red wine. Worth a try if you are looking to mix it up."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of caramel and malts. Taste is of caramel, alcohol, a bit nutty, finishing slightly sour. A lot going on, but somehow not gelling together. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent brew."
"As a house Scotch Ale the McEwan's does treat me quite well. The finish is appetizing, and it pairs very well with rich meats and BBQ. Smoked cheeses can be nice, but this beer is very potent and may overwhelm cheese. Enjoy it on its own for best results."
"355ml bottle from a six pack purchased at the Oxford & Adelaide LCBO. Dark ruby brown in colour, creamy beige head, a few dots of lacing on the snifter. Smell is leathery, tannic, toffee-like, a tad fruity, lots of toasty roastiness, with English pudding and Amaretto coming through as well. Taste is thick toffee, caramel, chocolate, bittersweet maltiness, brown sugar, nuts, faint metallic note, earthy hops, some warmth going down. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, almost syrupy, soft carbonation, slight tang on the tongue, dryly parched finish, very mild astringency. A balanced and enjoyable malt-forward ale. Not nearly as good as Oskar Blues Old Chub, but still one of the better imports available at the 'BO."
"Not exactly my cup of tea, but it seems to be a decent example of the style given my (very) limited experience. Rather sweet but shows some interesting complexity, would be quite enjoyable sipping inside on a blistery, cold winter evening."
"Almost the staple of what a typical scotch ale should be. Lots of sweetness, perhaps too much, roasty and dark malts, a little boozy quality, little smoked malts (probably could have used more), and a smooth rich texture. I can see why so many people are looking for this beer. Tasty, and I could drink this more often in winter."
"Simply a classic amongst the style. It is though a bit sweet for my taste now if compared to other Scotch ales and wee heavys, but always a pleasure nontheless!!!"
"A nice beer though it grew less pleasing as it warmed."
"My first wee heavy, but hopefully not my last."
"D- This one's a sipper for me, no more than one or two in a sitting."
"D: An amazing beer. This is the first I've had of this style and won't be the last. The sweet malts are not overpowering at all and the alcohol content is hidden very well."
"The taste is fairly simple but rich, full-bodied, smooth and mellow. It has strong fruit, especially cherries, toast, hints of chocolate and red wine, and spices. The feel is zesty and rather lively despite light oiliness. Alcohol adds a nice, full warmth without being too evident. The result is a beer that may lack complexity of some wee heavies, but still has plenty of firm character, some complexity, and is also extremely smooth and easy to drink."
"Overall: Sweet, malty, rich beer which goes down easy but can quickly overwhelm you with its strong taste and high alcohol content. Enjoyable, but I don't think I can handle it on a regular basis."
"A pleasant surprise. I like the chocolate-ey highlights, and it has a decent body without being a full-on stout. It has a strong taste without too strong an alcohol flavor (albeit the fact that it is 8% by volume). Will definitely be buying again (and am somewhat disappointed that as I write this I have finished my last bottle)."
"D I don't see myself drinking a 6er back too back but it's not a problem putting down one or two. I plan on drinking this in the future"
"Overall, a great brew especially if drunk as a dessert beer. Very sweet but not cloying, which is what I find to be a huge turn off with other darker coloured beers. I'm super glad I bought this and would love to have another."
"Drinkability- the alcohol is big and yet hidden, but this is a massive goliath of a beer and a definite sipper, it feels bigger and bigger to you as you go but its a very enjoyable beer, the flavor has a beautiful complexity and a great length, I really have to say i liked this beer very much so its a tad depressing knowing that I have just about the last one shipped to the US, but i guess i will have to hunt out similar examples of the style, if you can get this near you surely worth a try"
"Drinks very smooth, the thick/chewy body still goes down great."
"D: Not hard to drink, but not necessarily a standout here."
"O: Friggin Scot's and their ""Wee heavy", ""wee"" heavy my ass... this thing packs a punch that you won't feel till its too late if you're not careful (which I wasn't). My father is not one to mooch and for the most part, is indifferent to most of the beers that I get, but, as of the completion of this review (about 30 Min.), has sucked down half of my sixer! I too believe that the last beer won't make it the night- and I just bought the damn stuff tonight! This will never be out of stock in my fridge."
"Glad I tried it. Will be back for more."
"This is a stronger beer; doesn't really go with too many foods, didn't try hagas though. This is not a beer you just drink fast and order another one. It's a good starting point fore people interested in Scotch ales and darker beers in general being as for the most part it's not hard to get, and is a pretty good beer."
"The feel of this beer is a nice and even. The beer is a strong but not too overwhelming is really drinkable."
"Poured out into a mug a jet black. Even holding it toward a light maintains this inky darkness. Decent amount of head - with lacing - also present. Smells of toffee. Taste is a syrupy brown sugar-molasses-scotch flavor. Very sweet, somewhat heavy. Not something I particularly care for drinking over a prolonged period of time."
"The beer. . . it pours a deep, dark brown in color with a light head. The nose is mildly malty. The attack is thick and creamy. There are hints of nut in the flavor, but it is mostly a malt dominated beer. The mouthfeel is decidedly creamy. Towards the finish there is just the slightest bite, but then it closes with a sweet and creamy finish that closes out the experience. The weight of this beer seems to be heavy and tipping towards the barley wine side of scotch ales. I am mostly impressed that the beer seems uncompromised by its popularity as an import. Good on them."
"Drinkability- I guess I'm a little biased here, as this is one of my favorite beers, but as far as I'm concerned, this one can be drunk on any occasion. Excellent with a good grilled steak."
"Overall, I've had much better Scotch Ales that were brewed right here in Michigan in Founders Dirty Bastard and Dark Horse's Scotty Karate. I don't think I will buy this again. The fruitiness was unique but other than that there isn't much to make me come back to it."
"Very nice drink and is now on my recommended/re-purchase list."
"Pours a very dark reddish colored body, with a brownish color head, some okay lacing that is somewhat lasting. Has a pretty fruity aroma, with some malts. Has a malty, nutty taste, with a a little alcohol. Dusty palate. Somewhat hotter as it warms up."
"not bad, but I've had better scotch ales. a bit thick, a bit earthy and muted, without the complexity that I look forward to in many scotch ales and wee heavies. definitely not a bad example, but just not an outstanding one."
"D- Impressive, a perfect winter warmer. The alcohol content is well disguised, which improves drinkability. Might not be the beer for everyone, but those who like it usually like it a lot."
"Mouthfeel is full, viscous and syrupy sweet."
"D- Ok, but not great. I'll finish the 6 pack. I'll try other wee-heavies. I might not try this one again, though."
"As just noted, quite welcome on this night of well-below freezing temperatures, and various toasts to the Bard of Ayrshire. A pleasant example of the style, malty as all get out, and heavy enough to bear the onus of its denomination. And I'm going to require the fortification herein, if I'm to properly 'enjoy' the main dish later tonight."
"Up front the sweetness makes its presence felt. This is followed by an abundance of malt. Flavors are of raisins, roasted malt, and freshly baked bread. It finishes with a slight tinge of alcohol that warms the body. The sweet and roasted malt flavors work well together to form a very creamy and easy to drink selection."
"Future outlook: This was a very good, simple beer for when I want something malty. For some reason, I'd like to get this again and pair it up with some sausage or vanilla ice cream."
"Drinkability: Overall, it's enjoyable, yes I've had better Scotch Ales, but this one has a good kick and is bold enough to keep my attention. Can't see having more then 3 in a sitting but still a nice brew that is a sure warmer for the cold months."
"The beer was had much thinner feel to it than I expected, but that didn't bother me. I agree with those who've said this would make a nice dessert or after-dinner beer. I found myself sipping on this one."
"Overall - This was a surprisingly good, full bodied, and tasty brew. Will go well with a hearty dinner. Will buy again."
"A bit too sweet and fruity for me. Has some astringent qualities in the flavor. Seems a bit thin and does not have enough roastiness, leaves me wanting a bit more body and creaminess for a scotch ale. Hides the ABV well, never would have guessed this is above 6 or 6.5. Could not see myself buying a whole six pack of this."
"Really enjoyable, though I'd suggest only enjoying a few at a time."
"Taste is sweet medium bodied toffee, slight raosted coffee and fig. Very delicious and drinkable for a Wee Heavy."
"Overall good brew. Fairly strong alcohol taste, but not overwhelmingly so. Good taste, decent atmosphere."
"Poured into a nonic. Clear mahogany with a thin ecru head that shrivels into a nebulous cap. Aroma is standard maltiness with a touch of smoke/peat. Not especially robust for an 8% beer. Flavor is molasses, toffee, pepper, and smoke. Alcohol is apparent but not in a bad way. Body is about medium thickness, that is to say, too thin for the style. Aroma and flavor are also too thin for the style. Wee unheavy?"
"Wow, Solid Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy...Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Dark, chestnut brown color with a thin head and very little lacing. Not much aroma to speak of, a little stale, but I think I may have recieved a bottle past its prime. Flavor - Sweet malty deliciousness...MMM. As for drinkablility, I might be hard pressed to drink more than 1 or 2 of these 'turkey dinner in a bottle'"
"I love McEwan's Scotch Ale, I love its dark hue, its smooth, carmelly rich goodness, and although I never do, I could easily have more than one. The problem is that I can't find it anywhere anymore. Contact me if you know how I can find some. Thanks."
"Holy cow did this beer surprise me. I wasn't expecting much, but it really blew me away. Solid ale taste, sweetly malty, a bit toasty. Would have been better if it were a tad bit creamier on the palate, but I was very pleased. Having this after a Grolsch at a beer tasting event was a treat since the Grolsch didn't please me at all. I'll have to try this again by itself some time soon (if I can find it around here) and re-review."
"D- As I've developed more of a palate for darker beers I'd say this is a decent schotch ale. High on the alcohol side for a sessionable winter beer, though it does go well with a nice meal."
"D- This one is a sipper for me. Definitely check it out, though."
"I like this beer just fine, and it's nice as a finish to a cold winter's day. It's just slightly too strong on the alcohol, unfortunately."
"Enough said. Maybe too much but just didn't like this one. Moving onto the next one."
"Taste: Chocolatey and dessert-like. Very smooth and easily drinkable."
"This was a pretty good beer I must say. Pours a very dark red, almost black.. akin to a porter. Smell is of sugars and caramel malts, I almost get a sort of 'rum' smell in my whiff. The taste is very unique; a hint of warming alcohol first, followed by some flavorful caramel malts, all with a background of smokiness taste in the background. Interesting to say the least.. but hell it's a good beer, I'd definitely try it again."
"D - Good drinkability, however the 8% can creep up on you quickly if you are knocking a couple back. This is a great beer and I definitely one of the top examples of this style."
"Drinkable - sure. Like most high-alcohol brews, you kinda have to be in the mood for one, but it sure is easy to enjoy when you are."
"Definitely something I would drink again and something I would enjoy with a cigar or a pipe. Not recommend for all of your buddies to try unless they like a good strong beer."
"D- Smooth drinker. Higher ABV stops you from drinking too many in a session, but the solid flavor makes me want to come back for more."
"D. I liked this one really well, but it is pretty strong( I finished it just before writing this and can already feel a little buzz.) so if you drink it you will be staying where you are. However I love it as a nightcap so no problem."
"Drinkability is moderate. Fairly easy to consume, and flavors are pleasant. Nothing outstanding, but not at all bad either."
"Smooth, rich, medium full body, medium effervescence, slightly warming in the mouth and throat. Good stuff, Maynard."
"D - For an 8% brew, this drinks amazingly well."
"5/28/2004. Poured a dark brown body, with minimal head and a little bit of lace. A malty sweet type of taste with a bite to it and a skunky, pretty foul aftertaste which lingers. I've got to wait a few minutes before I can take another sip. Awful. On top of that, I paid $4.50 for this beer at my local pub. I really could barely finish it but can't waste beer. The only positive thing about this beer was that it had an 8% alcohol content. I doubt I will ever get this beer again."
"I don't think I'd drink more than a couple of these at a time. Good, and certainly something I'd drink again (I have, afterall) but not something I'd seek out."
"This beer may be too sweet for its own good. One feels like much too much. The flavor is there, it is just saturated in unnecessary sweetness."
"D = A pleasant, relaxing beer. Nice example of the style."
"Pours a dark brown with an offwhite head that reached one-finger and died slowly, leaving lacings. A good malty smell, roasted malts with some chocolate and caramel malts (sweet and sugary) as well. While smooth and some creaminess, this fuller-bodied beer was sticky and like eating a Caramello bar. Syrupy but still went down tastey with some sweetness and had a slick backbite, as the roasted malts are not pronounced. I just couldn't sit around and session this, not just because of high ABV, but because like a candy bar too much and you start to not feel good."
"I love the earthiness of this beer, it tastes like I'm drinking the soil of Scotland. Fantastic aftertaste. Right up there with Belhaven and Traquair, try them all and find your favourite."
"Not my favorite of the style, but not bad at all. This is one of the beers that first interested me in Scottish brewers. Though it does not stand up to my favorites of the style."
"I like this beer, why I don't quite know except that it makes you want to leave it alone yet you keep coming back for more. Pours a wonderful dark brown with ruby red tones. Good head and lacing that stick around for the duration. The overall aroma is a comlex mix of sweet and roasted malts and maybe some coffee and/or chocolate thrown in. Very creamy and smooth to drink with a bit of a bite that encourages you to come back for more. The overall taste is even more complex than the aroma. You taste sweet and bitter all at once. This is an overall joy to drink, but definately not a beer that I could have alot of. Very good complexity that leads to me wanting more, even though I know that I shouldn't."
"Love this beer! A dark scotch ale, high in aroma and flavor. Scents of caramel/toffee/coffee. High ABV @ 8.0%. Very rich flavor with hints of what the smells suggest, caramel/coffee. However this doesn't take away to much from the fact it is still a beer. Basically if you like Scotch Ales and have not tried this one, do so. If you haven't ever tried Scotch Ales and want to, this is a great one to start with! Regardless of anything, give one a try!"
"May make a decent gateway beer, but not hugely impressed."
"Heavy taste has lots of booze. Classic taste copied significantly."
"this beer is a scotch ale, but it feels alot heavier than that. Beer poured very dark, with a nice red tint. Alcohol is sneeky but you feel the 8% soon enough. The taste is a great combination of an amber ale and a porter, with a great amount of malt while having enough hops that if you keep it in your mouth long enough you feel the hop flavor go through your nose. Has a thickness that rivals an average porter, and thus is anything but a session beer. I had this beer once before at a beer tasting, and it was great. I bought a 6 pack and though it was expensive ($11) this is a beer of the calibur that makes it worth it."
"Poured it fairly rigorously into a pint glass has a cola color with a fluffy, receding, sticky light brown head. Can see carbonation sticking to the sides of the glass. Smells sweet with dark fruits, toffee and caramel. Yeah this is interesting. Creamy texture with a silky raisiny, caramel flavor. Slight alcohol presence, but fairly hidden. Fairly sweet but has a bitterness to match (slighty woody, spicy with just the tiniest hint of smoke)... still on the malt end of the spectrum. I really like the creamy yet not overbearing mouthfeel of this brew, and it goes down fairly easy. My first scotch ale and very tasty and drinkable ale."
"GH"
"D- i haven't had the world's finest scotch ales, a style that i find to be very intriguing, but i am thoroughly impressed by a beer from such a large european brewing company. i am also thoroughly buzzed from 12oz of this stuff. easy to drink one but a few more and i could get myself into some trouble. heh."
"I am fairly new to the style of scotch ales, but, surprisingly, I very much liked this beer"
"This one is a nice sipper for after dinner."
"Pours a light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is smooth, not too sweet, hops mellow, higher ABV is hidden. Really the standard for scotch ales. One of the better ones I've had."
"Great nightcap. Spilled a bit and it took the ink off a magazine. Good sign."
"Ach, it's a wee heavy! My first Scotch ale, joy. Served wee chilled in a pint glass. Poured a nice reddish brown color with a wee head. Smell was of dried fruits and some wee alcohol notes. It had that wee sherry taste that I am not too fond of, I know a lot of people like it but I just can't get into it. Had wee creamy mouthfeel which was good for downing this beer quick."
"Poured a dark ruddy color with a tangy, alcohol aroma that hits you up front. Very assertive, tangy caramel and prune with a bittersweet finish. You would have to really like Scotch ales to be completely taken with this one. Among the worse Wees I have ever had and its from UK...go figure."
"All in all, a signature brew of the scotch ale style; wonderfully sweet & malty with enough alcohol to keep you warm on a cool night."
"I tried this beer on January 11, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a dark brown colour with a creamy tan coloured head. The aroma was rather weak with some fruity hints. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with mild carbonation. The flavour had some malt taste up front with some grass and maple flavourings added to the mix."
"D: A very drinkable scotch ale."
"Glad I got to try a Scotch Ale. Thanks Hyland24."
"MF&D- Creamy feel leaving behind a sticky sweet flavor. More like a barlywine than an ale. Not a big fan of this one but its not a bad beer, just not my preference."
"D-Alcohol is not immediately apparent. Flavors and body are excellent. All in all, a great drink."
"MF&D - Clings to the mouth well. A very full bodied ale. I wish this Ale was a little more smokey and a little less sweet. High alcohol content makes this one a sipper. Worth a try, but nothing to special."
"Smooth and rich, yet moderatly drinkable for the ABV. A good offering of a pretty obscure style for the states."
"D - This is a pretty good Scotch Ale. Smooth with rich maltiness."
"Nice Scotch ale."
"D: Best for me at night right before bed or with a hearty dinner. Strength makes me not want more than two in a sitting."
"Definite sipper. A decent brew, a little above average for the style but definitely not one of the best around. Worth a try, but not something that will see many repeat visits."
"Served from a bottle into tumbler."
"This was a good beer, but seemed a bit too boozy for me to drink several of them in a row. Still a good beer though and worth trying."
"No too bad, just not interesting enough to visit again."
"D: As I said, a hefty brew. Not to be chugged or sessioned- unless you are Fat Bastard. A nice beginning to a session, but definitely not the focus."
"Poured a deep brown color with little head that dissipated pretty quickly. Aroma is of sweet maltiness with chocolate and caramel notes. Flavor is also of chocolate and caramel maltiness. Mouthfeel is good a bit on the thick side. Drinkability is ok. This is to be savored not sessioned."
"D: Drinks nicely for an 8.0abv. has distinct alcohol (scotch) tang in the end."
"Pours a dark roasted caramel with no head what so ever, looks like a flat coke. Smells of dark roasted malts, toffee, and maybe some butterscotch. The taste leans more towards the butterscotch (like a Sam Smith) with a titch of hops at the tail end. Hides the 8% very well. Gives the impression of a session. Nice mouthfeel to it. I feel bad about my score because it is growing on me as I work my way down the glass, but alas I must stick to my guns. I am not too familiar with the style but this seems pretty close to what I have read about."
"Deep ruby brown, medium light tan head that didn't last. Smell at first was like a ball of foil, and after a minute or two, turned to a rich malt, grassy, lightly metallic smell, with stick soy and peaty notes. Taste was similar, with a slight sourness. Maybe it wasn't so fresh, but I drank it within a couple days of buying it. Didn't taste the alcohol really, but it was still pretty poor I thought, and not what I was hoping or thinking it'd be."
"Without a doubt, this ale stands out among all Scotch Ales made. The warm sweet taste is unique and not matched by anyother Scotch. Complex but pleasant with no bitterness. A little tang to it but nothing gets in the way, it's breakfast in a bottle and one of my all time favorites."
"I enjoy this beer every time, but I only drink one at a time. I don't think I would enjoy a second quite as much."
"I don't feel i could drink a lot of this beer in one seating but it is great as a one time drink. Please don't think one way or another about thid beer from what I said."
"Smell is of caramel and malt but no hops evident. Pours to a very dark brown with not much head but tan for what there is. Taste is carbonated with a molasses start followed by a toasted malty butterscotch middle and a very subdued bitter hop finish, something like palisades. Very flavorful, sweet but definitely not overly sweet. The high AC is undetectable except a little right at the beginning. I think this one can really sneak up on you. A good beer but not something I would look for."
"Drinkability: Good Scotch Ale. Not my favorite, but good."
"I know that my personal preference for very flavorful and sweet beers will effect my ratings, but I really dig this one."
"d: This is my benchmark Scotch Ale."
"This in my opinion is the budweiser of wee heavys. Not to say that it is bad, but it is the most generic in taste for its style. The appearance is dark with a deep dark cherry red ruby glow. good thick head reduces to a cloudy film with decent lace. The nose is of a typical scotch ail malty and creamy, with dark fermented fruit and alcohol. The first taste is real malty and creamy. some spice and raisiny date flavor reside in this along with some dark sugar taste. Hop flavors are non existent in this beer. The finish is smooth, and the 8% abv is well hidden. The mouthfeel is this beers strongsuit. very creamy and chewy with sugary molassesy feeling. Sugar residue lingers on the lips and alcohol warms the mouth and stomach, but not abrasively so. The drinkability is strong, but that is b/c it is lacking in flavor. All around its quite good, but there are much better wee heavys out there. I would trade a sixer of this for one traquair house and a jacobite. Unless i was pissed and wanted to get more drunk. Good beer. a good intro to the style for beginners."
"belle couleur brune avec reflet rouge, malheureusement la mousse avait disparue avant que je la voie, nez de pomme verte, de malt, un peu sucré, la bouche est ronde, goût de malt, elle a du corps, belle finale sucrée. bonne bière."
"Fun beer, very easy to drink. First had this beer with some Scottish fellows on a ferry from Belgium to Scotland. Made the crossing a little easier so this has some sentimental value."
"Basically, I am very surprised to be the lowest rating for this beer as of yet. I don't understand how it could be rated anywhere above a 75 or so. One person gave it a 5, and another says it is his favorite beer in the world. I must have gotten a really terrible bottle of the stuff or something--there is just no way to explain the disparity. Even still, there are a bunch of people on here that must also have gotten bad bottles of the stuff, and poor quality control does reflect on the brewery. I really enjoyed dirty bastard, but this was just awful."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It pours a clear, deep ruby, with high carbonation and an inch of khaki head that leaves some nice lacing. Dark fruits and some earthiness in the nose, along with scotch, roasted malts, and notes of red apple and chocolate. Quite sweet on the palate, almost cloyingly so, and there is a big dose of acetylhyde, contributing an apple or currant flavor. There are also notes of raisins and figs, coffee, and some spicy hops that impart a mild bitterness. It has a crisp, almost tingly, medium body that leaves a light to medium finish. Not too bad, but a bit too sweet for my liking."
"Feels a bit thick, though I'd like it to be a bit thicker. It's mildly carbonated. I'd say it's a drinkable beer, but nothing special. I'm not overly impressed by it other than the way it looks."
"D= can't take more than one of these, any longer. For a far better adventure, try the Dragonhead Stout, or maybe a more-common Guinness Stout."
"Decent brew with enough of a bite to get your money's worth. A fine scotch ale, though for a malt mouth like myself it could have been more malty. Still full of complex savory fruit flavor to be inviting to many beer advocates."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, but its high abv limits sessionability."
"I wasn't sure what to expect given this was my first Scotch Ale. Apart from a so-so smell in a beginning, it was good all-around."
"my fav. scotty ; pours a deep copper color w/ a fluffy off-white head which dissapates quickly and leaves a good lacing ; a nice malty aroma, w/ some fruity date/raisin undertones, slightly alcoholic as well ; a sweet malty flavor, a caramel/nutty delight w/ some fruity esters balanced w/ a faint hop bitterness ; not to thick, med. bodied, yet robust w/ alot of dextrins & just enough co2 to keep it around ; what can i say, it's McEwan's, it's 8.00% ABV, it's drinkable until you can't stand, anyway, i could drink a gallon of this ( and have ), the top style example too, i believe...."
"Pours a clear dark red/brown, big thick beige head forms, nice chunky lace on the glass, good retention, thick layer. Smell is sweet, caramel, winey, molasses, alcohol, all malt, touch of chocolate. Taste is similar, very sweet and malty, toffee, light chocolate, bread, alcohol is pretty well hidden, sweet caramel finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Pretty solid, one dimensional but goes down pretty easy for such a big brew."
"Drinkability: Very tasty and enjoyable. Strong, but drinkable. It could be dangerous. It makes me feel like pillaging a village."
"D: Great drink over pizza and with your pipe/cigar. Mirrors tobacco well with a touch more sweetness. Great beer. Stays on my list!"
"I tried this beer in a chalice. It had nice lacing but lacked a good head. Nice dark color. Smell was musty. Taste was strong with a similar aftertaste. Slight bitterness but mostly sweet. While this beer wasn't unpleasant, my taste tends to go more for flavors along the lighter flavors."
"[Music: Bolt Thrower - Realm Of Chaos]"
"Decent Scotch Ale, though not as flavor-full as I was anticipating."
"So right about then, my beer buddy happened to drop in and I asked him to see if this bottle was somehow off. He said it was just about right for the style. Then he says he's surprized because I've had Wee Heavy a few times in the past and claimed to enjoy it. I don't remember that very well ... but maybe's that's characteristic of the beer? I'll have make a point of trying that one again to find out, but in the meatnime I was disappointed with this style tonight, with due respect to all those who like the stuff."
"After trying Sam Adam's Scotch Ale, I thought I might really be onto something. I searched around and this was the first import Scotch Ale I could find... and wow! Nectar of the gods for me. Smoky finish, great aroma, beautiful copper color. I couldn't ask for anything more. My next step will be to try the pop top cans."
"Poured a reddish color with a cream, 2 finger head. Had the slight hint of toffee smell to it, Was kind of scared when I saw this bottle at 8% abv. I had never had a beer to this point with an abv that high. So I though this would mess me up drinking it, but from the first sip it was very smooth and easy to drink. The mouthfell of this beer is very light. The overall drinkability is great, I will buy this beer agian and agian to drink from time to time."
"Drinkability: Purchased at a store where beers go to be forgotten (Jax in Sandy Springs), particularly the singles, so I'm left to wonder how old this is as it just has a great aged quality to it. I'd say it's got some of the qualities of a J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale, but being less alcoholic and less syrupy, while being way more cost-effective."
"Drinkability: A great dessert beer that goes down easy enough and it's very enjoyable. I like it"
"12 oz. bottle- color of black with a red tint, with a small off white head - nose is nutty, malty, red fruit, and chocolate taste of dark cherries, malt, and brown sugar- body is medium, and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of brown sugar, and dark cherries"
"The taste was sweet and malty at first with a candy aftertaste. The whole beer was extra sweet with not enough of the dark malty or hoppy taste that you would expect from scotch ale. The feel is smooth and clean but at the same time heavy and thick. You can feel the syrupy beer going down with very little carbonation. There is an alcohol warming as you drink it with a little bit of a lingering warmth as you finish. This is an ok beer but I was not very impressed. It is very sweet and not really to my taste. It has an ok flavor and a smooth quality but it was way too far on the sweet side for me."
"The finish was cleaner and lighter in the mouth then expected, and had me finishing the glass too quickly. Uncomplicated and satisfying, if not overly interesting."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not as filling most Wee Heavies, good kick, good representation of style. It might not be the absolute best-tasting Scotch Ale but it’s up there and isn’t quite the gut-buster that others are. It’s one of the few with the style that you could drink several of."
"Overall, a decent beer. Not what I expected -- I expected it to taste more like a Belhaven, not realizing at the time that this was a wee heavy. Anyway, it's a pretty good example of the style, though personally the over-the-top sweetness was a bit much for me -- one of the most cloyingly sweet beers I've had."
"A ""decent"" wee-heavy though I can think of livelier, more complex/tastier versions of the style. This is a slow-sipper to end the day with."
"The pour reveals a mahogany colored beer with a tight tan head that sticks around as a thin film and laces nicely. The smell of this one is dominated by caramelized dark malts, sugar and a touch of alcohol it is slightly herbal as well. The taste is sweet caramelized malts, make that really sweet caramelized malt. There is maybe a bit of dark fruit in there as well, plums or currants, a bit of alcoholic warmth comes through especially as the beer warms there is very little hop flavor a bit of bitterness would be nice to contrast with the sweet maltiness. The mouthfeel is very thick and again syrupy sweet and smooth with low levels of carbonation. Drinkability depends on the situation a good pairing would make this more fun to drink but on its own the syrupy sweetness and slick mouthfeel tend to become slightly cloying"
"Pours a dark brown, near black color with some amber hints. Nose is fairly mild, mostly caramel malt, not much else. Taste is crazy strong on toffee. Some slight alcohol hints, a little hops at the end, but overall this is like liquid form McIntosh's Toffee bar. Tasty. Feel is medium bodied, solid carbonation. This one is seriously crazy, as in a liquid candy bar of some kind. It's not particularly complicated, but it is entirely delicious, if you like a super sweet beer."
"This is thus far my favourite scotch ale. Even compared to the amazing Traquair House, this one still stands out."
"D: All night long. For 8% ABV, this could easily pass for a session beer. Great around a fire pit."
"Decent creaminess in the mouthfeel, but it doesn't translate to a great finish. There's just not a lot bringing me back to McEwan's. No flavors are amiss, but the somewhat nebulous Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy style doesn't give me good enough guidemarks to rate it highly for stylistic fidelity. A little too much alcohol for the compensating flavors."
""
"A nice solid effort. This is a great pair to a plate of smoked cheeses as a appetizer. A nice choice to venture into the style if you are new to it. Good job to the folks at McEwan's."
"Thick and tart, sweet with deeply roasted flavors. Pretty good."
"D the sweetness prevents me from having too many."
" ~ I look forward to finnishing off this sixer. I'll most likely enjoy a few of these Scottish treasures after some serious mountain biking."
"This looked really nice and poured a bit darker than I thought it would. A dark red bronze colour, this beer showed wonderful head retention. The smell was nice musty, earthy hops with a touch of caramel and malt. Taste was just the opposite with some nice English earthy hops, but sweet malty notes and caramel in particular dominating. The was very smooth and very easy to drink, but very solid and full bodied. I was nearly done with the thing when I discovered this was 8%. I would have never guessed. This was a great beer and really nice representation of the style."
"It's a tasty Scotch ale. It's somewhat alcoholic though, which diminishes the ability to have more than a couple though. This is typical I suppose of the Scotch ale style though."
"Drinkability: At 8% its a bit much on its own. Would only have one or two of these, and it certainly needs to sipped as its pretty sweet too. Overall, good beer, certainly worth trying."
"This beer pured very dark with amber highlights. First impression of the aroma was similar to that of an oatmeal stout . The taste finishes similar to an oatmeal stout (very toasty) but begins as more of an amber ale or Belgian-style ale. The mouth-feel is very mild, again similar to that of an oatmeal stout. Drinkability is high because of the clean finish. Keep this one cold though, because if it gets warm it begins to smell and taste very strong."
"Drinkability- Not sessionable, but very nice indeed. Good for a cold night in front of the fireplace."
"slight boozy scotch kind of a finish. A nice, tasty winter warmer."
"Pours a dark red-brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma was slightly peaty, with some dark fruits (mainly raisins). Taste was raisiny caramely malt, with some spice. Mouthfeel was very smooth and the high ABV was well hidden. This is pretty drinkable, especially in the fall when I tend to grow weary of hoppy beers."
"Poured into a pint glass, from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a light brown, settling to a very dark brown. 1/2 inch mocha head, and light rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is very faint, mainly of light roasted malt and alcohol. The taste is very much the same. Roasted malt bitterness, and a more pronounced alcohol presence. Thick mouthfeel, and smooth finish. Not quite a sessionable ale, but nonetheless one I wouldnt mind having in the middle of a session. Overall, this is better than most scotch ales that I've had the opportunity of trying."
"Being a scotch drinker, I felt this beer and I would agree from the start...and I was correct. A quarter-inch head leaves garter-esque lace in a La Fin du Monde tulip glass (no thistles in my cabinet--yet). Smoky hints of alcohol are apparent but not overwhelming; cola black coloring looks better here than on Coke. Chasing elements of sweetness merge with a bitter uppermouth feel to produce a carbonic bubbly palate. The alcohol payoff doesnt assert itself until the second bottle. By the third, Im feeling quite pleased--not unlike when Ive had a single malt."
"I had this one at Dunderbacks in the Lehigh Valley Mall. Very basic bottle design. Beer poured mahogany in color with a tan head. Very malty taste just like it is supposed to. I thought it could be a bit thicker in mouth feel. Enjoyed this with a bratwurst with some spicy deli mustard. Seemed to pair pretty well. If you have never experienced a scotch ale this is a good one to start with to get to 'know' the style. I think there are some better american micro examples though. I will review some them later. Seems like american microbrewers are always improving on traditional european brews....well that's my opinion. Malt lovers will not be disappointed with this one. I would order one again."
"Pours a five finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is smooth, not too sweet, hops mellow, higher ABV is hidden. Really the standard for scotch ales. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Tull's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"exceptionally drinkable for it's 8%."
"330ml bottle, pours with an average level of head, chalky white with bubbles resting throughout. A dark body, lovely highlights certainly not quite yet opaque. Various shades of brown. Aroma presents only very faint suggestions of molasses, wood, tar, figs, and nutty malty notes. No roast and obnoxiously minerally. Mouthfeel nowhere near as sticky or strong as I recall, and is actually rather flat and unarousing. The flavours are simple and meak. Some scotch I suppose, but alcohol absent. Light suggestion of raison, dark toffee. Underwhelming. Certainly not what I thought before I knew any better..."
"I don't know about this one, maybe it was a bad bottle. It looked ok to start with. The smell, however, was way off. It might have been skunked but it smelled kind of like an old sneaker with beer spilled in it. Yeah, the flavor was mellow and alright with caramel grains, nothing too nutty. I don't think I'd try this again."
"I like this style of beer in general, but this one didn't impress me. The alcohol is too prominent and it seems to be lacking many subtleties. I'll pass in the future."
"Overall, very good beer and an impressive introduction to strong Scottish beers."
"Never had a Wee Heavy before, didn't know what to expect. Was anticipating a malty stout on 8% abv steroids. This beer poured a clear mahogany color with beautiful red highlights when held up to the light. Good sized off-white head and fairly thick lacing. A very impressive appearance. Smell was dark fruit (plum maybe) and a hint of chocolate. Taste was surprising, no malty flavor. Slightly astringent and fruity/chocolate taste. Reminded me very much of a very mild Mad Elf. At first taste, I thought the mouthfeel was a bit weak. Subsequent sips cleared that up. The mouthfeel is fairly rich and creamy. At 8%, this don't qualify as a session beer, but it is quite drinkable and a second one would be welcome along with good conversation on a cool evening. A nice experience."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a medium brown color with a lighter color hue coming through when the glass is held to the light. There is a prominent, silky looking head that leaves sticky webs of lacing as the beer level decreases. Smell is of caramel, toasted malt, bready yeast and slightly of chocolate. Taste is very upfront and is balanced nicely. An initial caramel/light chocolate sweetness is quickly subdued by a slight bitterness of hops and alcohol. Beer is medium in body with a light, silky carbonation. A drinkable beer, enjoyable on all levels."
"Final Statement: Wonderful scotch ale!! Only wish I tried this earlier. I will definately revisit this one again."
"Into a pint glass, pours a dark brown with ruby hues, a large tan head of froth leaves delicate lacing as it recedes, and a few rings as I down the drink. The aroma is pretty good. Not the best, but a lighter reflection of the taste.... which is a smidgin better, rich and chewy, chocolate, caramel and butterscotch melt into one, a little earthiness like moss, toffee is faint, a nice, light alcohol warming in the mouth and a medium body with medium carbonation, and this is just a lovely ale (and a long sentence). The thing about this beer is that even given its 9% abv, its really easy to drink, and you'd really want to drink more of it after you're done. As of right now though, it goes damn well with a big ass sandwich."
"Others have said this, but it's true for me too ... this is a ""staple"" beer for me. One of my all-time standbys, so forgive me if I'm a tad biased. Pours a fairly dark reddish brown color with a mountainous tan head with staying power. Spotty lacing in the pint. The nose evokes caramel malts, molasses, roasted barley and oats, and a slight floral notes. Palate is quite sweet in the beginning, but quickly becomes a more balanced play of sweet malt and dry hops. Lovely. The mouthfeel is solidly medium, warming alcohol in the mouth, and a terrific warm, yet semi-dry, finish. Hops become more noticeable in the aftertaste. I really enjoy McEwans Scotch Ale. The taste brings back pleasant memories for me. A very solid Scotch Ale and a standard for the style if you ask me. Great stuff."
"It's a sipping beer, for sure, but man - this sets the standard for me in terms of style. I could make this a regular accompaniment to a good book after a long day, even if I couldn't make it through more than one at a time."
"D- drinkable, enjoyable, i like scotch ales, but i feel like something is just missing for me, worth a try though, i'll be giving it another"
"The taste is more of the same, with raisins, plums and caramel hitting the palate, and a slightly astringent dark fruit flavor. There is a warming alcoholic finish to the brew as well. I am a fan of Scotch Ales, and this is a fine example of the style."
"I'll have to try it from the mug in the near future. it may turn out differently due to more carbonization released, making it less bitter, dare I venture to say. but, straight from the bottle, it is easier to imbibe if you're used to dark, bitter ales."
"355 ml brown bottle, (same as in above picture), best before date on back label. Pours deep and dark ruby red, almost black, with a tan head. Nice thick head to start that shrinks down, leaving a decent ring around the glass and some lacing. Great aroma, along with the dark, sweet malt and fruity prune and dates, there is a warming scotch whiskey smell. I let it sit just long enough to bring out the aroma and flavor. Dark fruit flavor balanced by a roasted malt. The 8% alcohol is there, but not overpowering. Thin streams of caronation bubbles keep the mouthfeel creamy yet dry. A nice dark beer, sip it slow and enjoy the layers of flavors."
"In terms of overall drinkability, just too sweet for my taste. Would like to see a tweak toward balance."
"All is all, an excellent example of a scotch ale."
"Drinkability:...maybe 1 after a Robby Burns Night..."
"This Scotch ale pours a very dark brown with a good head that trailed off to a decent crown. The smell is strong with a nice array of sweet maltiness, earthy honey and fruit notes and a rich grainy bread scents. The taste is rich in bready malts and caramel notes. The alcohol is hard to miss and blends exceptionally with the whole. It finishes dry with good carbonation and a full-bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable, though the ABV will creep up on you."
"Medium-firm pour (cold from fridge) into a bulb. Pale tan head dissipates rather quickly but uniformly, leaving a tenacious ring around the glass and some stubborn but moderate lacing. There's an immediately striking presence to the nose: rum and booze . . . much more prominent than I remember. Smells treacly-sweet, malty, tangy / semi-sour, with a touch of iodine-minerality. Nose is also vinuous and rather fruity with notes of grapes, prune, date and fig - one hell of a nose, I'd say! Clear, dark ruby/amber in color, with fine champagne-like bubbles and carbonation. I gave it a few minutes to warm before tasting, as I recall from past experience that this brew really opens up after it warms. It comes on strong initially, with a sharp bittersweet character, and the bitterness really surprises me a little at first. Plum / ripe pear sweetness is balanced by a stout-like roasted malt character (think Guinness Estra Stout) as well as an underlying bitterness which is part malt and part hop. Aromatic qualities are all fruit and no hop. Alcohol is certainly present but very well mitigated by a landslide of malt complexities (note: alcohol becomes more pronounced as this warms!) Mouthfeel is a lot thinner than I recall from my days as a Meister Brau drinker / homebrewer (gotta put those returnables to good use y'know?), but not thin by any stetch, more like ""medium"". Notes of juicy plum and roasted malt simply last and last, and there is a further scintilla of berries (think blackberry mashed-up with boysenberry) in the aromatics. Mouthfeel is also fairly complex: begins creamy/sweet and winds its way through vinuous and oily to become semi-sweet and a lot drier than I remember. As far as the mouthfeel, well, it isn't altogether ""easy"" to put one of these down, but it's a lot easier than it should be - very drinkable for a big brew. About three ounces into this and I'm catching the warmth of the alcohol alongside the iodine/mineral/medicinal qualities (even a touch Peaty!) that had made the Wee Heavy my favorite style for many, many years. Scotch whiskey-like, insofar as a ""beer"" can be, and definitely a sipper. This is amongst the heavier of the more widely-available offerings in the Wee Heavy style. In fact, I have before me my trusty xeroxed copy of ""Beer Analysis: Alcohol and calorie content for a cross-section of imported and domestic beers."" from the December, 1991 issue of Modern Brewery Age magazine. The old, 9.5% ABV export version was rated at 295 calories per 11.2 oz bottle . . . just imagine the carbs in that!!! But apart from a weight-tweak to the recipe to bring it down to a reasonable 8.0% ABV, there's nary a difference in taste or overall characteristics (or at least not enough to cry ""foul"" over). This remains a beer that drinks like a meal, and among my all-time Top 10. I've heard rumours that Scottish and Newcastle are dropping this from their North American import scheme, and this is quite a shame: a value at twice the price, it will be sorely missed - I guess it's time I got back into homebrewing, eh? I have a couple of empty returnable cases in the cellar . . ."
"Goes very well with these chocolates."
"This was the first time I have tried this style, and it was definately a pleasent experience. I would love to try more in the future."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable and not overly filling, despite the thick mouthfeel and high ABV (8.0%). Good for a nightcap, and would also pair well with smoked meat, or maybe a mild cigar. Perhaps not the best example of the style, but a good beer nonetheless. Recommended."
"Taste is malty sweet, too sweet for my preference. The vinegary overtone is present in the flavor too, not overpowering but distracting. Overall, it's the sweetness that puts me off and makes me give it a low drinkability rating."
"Poured a dark brown almost black with a tight and formidable head that laced around the glass as it was being consumed. Nutty and carmel flavors came through with a light sweetness, also tasted some burnt roasted flavors. Finish was a little dry for a this style of beer."
"Attractive mahogany color with only a thin cap of head but respectable lacing. Nose is malty with alcohol and coffee tones but somewhat nondescript. Taste is somewhat bitter in the finish although it hides the alcohol well. There is some initial fruityness followed by a chemical tasting sweetness that finishes similar to sawdust. Also, the mouthfeel is flat and has something of a cola texture to it, although overcarbonation isn't really a problem. Too bad, as I was really looking forward to this but it's not on the upper side of the wee heavies I've sampled so far."
"D- Easy to drink not to heavy, an approachable Scotch Ale."
"Pours a deep chestnut-ruby with good clarity. Creamy biege colored one and a half finger head, holds a thin cap to the end and produces sticky specs of lacing. Strong roasted and high-kilned crystal aromas; hint of alcohol and a malt vinegar scent. Caramel and dextrin flavors are big upfront, followed by a mineral-water taste. Gentle fuggle hop flavor comes out in the aftertaste; tea-like and herbal, balanced enough for the style and dries just enough to eliminate cloying. Medium-full bodied, plenty of dextrinous texture, and the light carbonation accentuates the thick, malty mouthfeel. Finishes residual and rich with biscuity dextrins and lingering caramel flavor. Alcohol is well-hidden and allows a good drinkability. Good introduction to the style."
"D- Considering style and ABV, this is a very easy beer to take. Not quite full enough and too mild to be a great sipping beer though. Almost too easy to drink, with it's high alcohol content it would be easy to get drunk with a few of these kicking around."
"This is an enjoyable brew, medium in body, light in carbonation and full of taste."
"This is by and large the best commercial brew I have yet to try."
"When it first pours, their is a beautiful foam head. It quickly settles, leaving behind something that looks like Coca Cola. Smells of damp earth, malts, dark fruits and... I don't know. Something odd. Reminds me of being a child. Very sweet start. Bready, caramel and figs. Finishes sweet as well, with a bit of a roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit thick and chewy. Not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"Impression: Nice...like a dark Bock but with more ale yeast fruit tastes and a pleasant musty/woodsy decernment..even though it is obvious the ABV had been brought up with sugars and not malts, and the body is a tad thin for this type of beer, the whole thing is carried off well enough forMcEwans to retain their older clientele who remember when this beer was malty and full bodied before the use of adjunct sugars."
"I really enjoyed this one. If you like sweeter beers, this one is probably for you. The alcohol is hidden well, so be careful not to let it sneak up on you. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Overall a very enjoyable, affordable, and common Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy. I was quite surprised that this beer was this good. For some reason I wasn't expecting this much from this beer. I could definitely buy and drink this again in the future."
"Outstanding drinkability. This beer went down amazingly well. Makes for a terrific after dinner drink."
"Its good. I enjoy Scotch Ales very much, and would certainly drink this again as well as recommend it."
"a smooth mouthfeel complements the rich flavors: brown sugar, caramel, there might be some chocolate in there (but just a hint). this stuff is so good"
"Pours a deep ruby cherrywood with a tan creamy head. Leaves some sheeted lacing. Smells of malt, sweet, some dark dried fruits, and a not so pleasant yeastiness. Flavor is just up front malt sweetness, some light roasted character, slight smoke, raisins, and a slightly astringent finish. Again, not too crazy about the yeast here. Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, and slightly slick. Little carbonation. This is a decent enough beer, but it just doesn't do it for me enough to compel me to keep on drinking."
"Drinkability: This would make a great dessert beer. I would recommend it to others."
"D: Dessert-y. Could stand to have a few, but would probably opt not to."
"Pewter mug, McEwan's of course, at Highlander in Antwerpen on 9/12/06. 7.2% ABV."
"Easily available here (can't say that very often here in Canada) and there are very few others of this kind to compare, still I'm happy I can sip on McEwans Scotch ale."
"This pours dark, looks more like a coke than a beer, not much head to it if any. It smells sweet, but I can't make out any particular odors. Tastes sweet, more like a cream stout or something, probably be better as a dessert than a beer. I can't really explain the mouthfeel, kinda carbonated and light w/ some chocolate like aftertaste. It's not like a beer at all to me, but it's not terrible, just decent."
"Drinkablility: Quite drinkable , but more so as a dessert pairing or sipper , on the sweet side."
"Pours to a dark brown color with ornage tint, medium off-white head and okay lacing. Good aroma of chocalatey malt, with an over-riding smell of honey or molasses. Taste was a very good, honey-sweet flavor, but not syrupy like many thick bodied beers. As the beer warmed, the 8% alcohol made its presence known more, but not overwhelmingly. Finish was long and smooth. I really liked this beer."
"Drinkability: Not a hard beer to finish at all. It tastes fine, but the sweetness would have me looking for a new beer after a couple. I don't think I'd ever drink more than one or two of these at a time."
"Pours a darker reddish brown with a creamy tan head which recedes into a thin film. Aroma is all malt, almost smells like an old ale or a barleywine. I'm picking up aroma reminiscent of raisins. Taste is malty, some carmel elements there. Medium bodied with a little bit of a bite from carbonation and some alcohol burn. This stuff is great."
"I will definately look for this one again. Great to sip at the end of an evening."
"When I think of Scotch Ale, this is what I think of. A good offering, but not spectacular. Solid and pleasing, but the drinkability suffers from the high sweetness and obvious alcohol as it warms. Taste is good, but straight forward and uncomplicated."
"D: A good, strong brew. Nice flavors and potent strength. A sipper, but a pretty tasty one at that. Recommend a try for fans of Scotch Ales."
"Overall impression: I must say that I've neglected this style but no longer! This is a fantastically balanced beer and I will continue to explore others like it. Strongly recommended."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability --- good mouthfeel, but drinkability is hurt by the fact that this has too much of an alcohol bite and a few of these will put you to sleep real fast. Still, overall, a good, but not great, example of a wee heavy."
"Split a 12 oz. bottle with my brother. Tasted them from wine glasses. No freshness date on the bottle that we could see. Poured a clear, reddish-brown (dark ruby, I believe he said) with a small, white head. Aromas of sweet malt, caramel, burnt sugar, and a fruity smell. The more I stuck my nose in it, the more I got some aromas of fruity white wine - peach or apricot mostly. Tastes of dark roasted malt, toasted coffee. Sharp notes of alcohol, too. Very tiny fizz in the mouthfeel. A touch watery - not as thick and smooth as other Scotch Ales I've tried. Very good drinkabililty - it's light enough that it doesn't overpower. A fine example of this style."
"I split this with my brother, using two regular wine glasses. It poured about a dark ruby color, with a little slightly off-white head. Quite nice looking, actually. The aroma was very sweet and malty (a little toasted), with a meaty note in it that made me think of bologna (baloney). The taste was well-balanced. Even though a little up there in alcohol, you couldn't tell very much. It was again very malty with a slighty bitter finish. Hints of a dark fruit, like raspberry. In the mouth it was very pleasant, with a good thickness. Overall, I enjoyed this scotch ale a lot, and could have consumed more. In a small scotch ale competition, I preferred this one to Founders' Dirty Bastard."
"In conclusion McEwan's > Dirty Bastard, but McEwan's < Sam Adam's Scotch Ale."
" This is an ok scotch ale, nothing to bad about it, i'd reccomend it to any dirty bastard fan. Cheers"
"D: Definitely not a session brew, but quite enjoyable, especially for the price. Recommended."
"This beer poured a brown that is almost the exact same color of the bottle it comes in. The smell is just simply heavy malt. The taste is kind of like a malt ambush  deep flavors. This fat boy is chewy! I doubt most people would find this a steadily drinkable beer (but I might on occasion). I think it would go great over a scoop of vanilla."
"This one has a big nose on it, dark, roasted malt, slight sweetness and smokyness to it also. The body is heavy, with a syrupy mouthfeel to it. It's like someone reduced a stout in half. A challange to drink more than one or two, but it is one of the standards for this style and as such is worth checking out."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass. Has a dark, ruby color with little head and some lacing. Strong malty sweetish smell with a coffish overtone. Can definitely smell the alcohol in this one. I'm really getting into this style but this one had a little too much alcohol taste to it and the sweetness gets to be a bit much after a while. I'll have to try again as the palate matures toward the darker side but just an occasional brew for now. (2.5, RB, Tie, O)"
"Pours a mostly opaque ruby colored brew with a gorgeous off white head, that trickles to just a shimmer; fairly good tracing. Wow, this is a malt bomb; lots of dark fruits come across, candy sweetness, and a slight chocolate backbone. Flavors are overly sweet and malty with nearly no hops to balance it. Medium body and moderate carbonation, perhaps too high for a big beer like this. Alcohol is quite present and provides a nice belly warm. Though I can't say malt bombs like scotch ales are my cup of tea, I have to agree this is a well made beer and would be an excellent accompaniment to a variety of roasted meats or desserts."
"Heavy-bodied, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Fairly smooth and creamy however. The alcohol aftertaste and the 8% ABV however make this one a poor session beer, plus it's just too sweet for my taste. I could see drinking a couple in one sitting, but not pouring these things down all night."
"D- a bit bold to be an consistant drinker, but a good choice for a scotch ale"
"This is a great ale, and definitely worth having again."
"Definitely a good to have around beer."
"Overall: Though I dont particularly like most ales, in fairness this one is very good. I would recommend this solid Scotch Ale."
"Taste and Mouthfeel- Sweet, full-bodied, slightly sticky, but smooth: Exactly what's to be expected for a Scotch Ale. Caramelized malts, alcohol and a hint of fruit predominate. Not the most complex Scotch Ale I've had and it's not all that drinkable, but it's not that bad. Still I've had better."
"Mouthfeel is quite full and smooth with low carbonation. A little thick, a little velvety. This is a really nice rich beer to spend some time with. Not incredibly complex, but very satisfying."
"Anyway, a perfect dessert drink. Worth a try - in small volumes."
"Not a bad brew, not very sessionable but great for a nightcap after a hearty meal."
"Perhaps I'm not a fan of this style."
"As for the drinkability, it is a nice session beer. Very smooth. The 8.0 ABV is pretty sneaky, as in it doesn't taste bitter or strong like some beers with high ABV's. Will be getting more of this in the future."
"This beer poured a dark reddish/garnet color with a half inch light tan head. Carbonation was moderate and left a nice layer of lace on the glass. Aroma was malty, caramelly and slightly winey. Taste was very malty sweet with notes of smoke, caramel, ripe fruit, prunes and alcohol. The beer finishes with a sour/winey note and a good burst of alcoholic warmth. The beer was medium bodied and pretty easy to drink. Hops take a backseat here, as they should. I've heard rumors that Scottish Courage is going to stop exporting their beers to the U.S. I hope to hell not cause this is one brew that I'm gonna miss."
"Drinkability: Looking forward to having this again. A style that I'm hoping to have more of soon enough."
"The first time I tasted this I was a beer novice and tasted soy sauce for some reason. Now that my palate has matured I have seen what a tasty brew this is. As one wise reviewer did before me, I may cellar this for a while. I can't imagine what several months might do to it!"
"Not a bad beer. I think this could make a very nice introductory scotch ale."
"Recently, I have cellared one of these for 15 months. Can you cellar this brew? I wasn't sure but considering the style, texture and alcohol content I figured it coudn't hurt to try. I rather impatiently waited 15 months to sample the last from a case. It was certainly worth the wait! The results were wonderful. Cellaring created much milder and subdued flavors without the loss of body. One word to desribe the change would be a mellowing effect on every strong point of the beer without losing the stand-out qualities."
"Very dark reddish brown body with an inch of tan foam. Some streaky lacing left around the glass. Mild sweet dark fruits and a nice smokiness come through in the aroma. Flavor starts with more ripe dark fruits with some sweet caramel. Smokiness and some earthy notes cut through the sweetness as it finishes. Pretty thick and smooth body. Easy drinking stuff with a enough going on that I could have a few."
"D - easy, very easy to throw back, smooth and sweet, this is real nice"
"I've had this a number of times prior to actually sitting down to review it, mostly before I started attempting to pick out favor profiles. This wasn't as spectacular as I remember it once being, but it's still pretty damned good. I couldn't drink it all night (mostly because of the 8% ABV), but a good representation of the style I feel."
"Deep brown ruby color. Creamy tan head that sticks around for the life of the beer. The aroma is sweet. Caramel and roasted malts. Very sweet on the palate. A little overwhelming at times. Chocolate, plums, roasted malts and alcohol. No real balance. The body is medium-full and slick on the tongue. A can see myself enjoying this brew one at a time. The sweetness kind of kills the drink ability."
"Mouthfeel- Medium to thick body on the palate mixed with a bunch of creamy malty goodness."
"Drinkability/Notes  Doesnt leave me craving another but drinkable enough. Not too special. Did not pair well with a soft Havarti."
"Drinkable enough if you can get past the sweetness. Had this in Belgium and it was better,,,"
"D - I like this a lot. It's quite strong but the alcohol isn't very obvious."
"Wow, powerful and bold without trying too hard. Big caramel and toffee aromas and flavors become almost chewy in texture. Nearly molassas and dehydrated fruit flavored. Grapes, figs, dates, and nut flavors are highly pronounces. Lighly buttery and hoppy. Very malty and sweet. Bold toast flavors offer a subtle bitterness without any charred characters. Finish very sweet and lightly alcoholic. A bit tacky and cloying. Still a very good beer."
"D: A ""once a session"" beer. Definitely enjoyable as long as you take it easy."
"Overall a solid beer. not the best in the style, but still good."
"This is a drinkable beer. Certainly not an everyday kind of beer, and its probably best described as a desert beer. It is a very smooth and sweet tasting ale. I would certainly have it again."
"I hate to criticize a Scottish Scotch ale but this one wasn't quite right. The appearence was great, slightly opaque black with a decent sized head. The taste was a bit cheap, a bland nose with a sharp bitter bite. The smell was more inviting but couldn't make up for the flavor, which was very good but not good enough for someone like me who is very picky about this type of brew. Recommended maybe for someone just getting into Scotch ales."
"Drinkability: Not as smoky or as peaty as I would have expected, and I have tasted better Wee Heavies, but nonetheless a nice example of the style"
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a creamy tan head that stays well. Smell is a little faint, malty sweetness and some alcohol as well. Tastes of caramels and honey, with a faint metallic undertone and bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and warming, very pleasant on a cold night, and drinkability is good. A pleasant ale, but not exceptional."
"At 8%, this is a big friendly ale which if consumed, in any quantity, will certainly take the chill of a Scottish winters eve."
"What a wounderful beer. The color of deep rich dark brown with a slight amber head. the aroma is full of sweet malt and a little plum, ever so slight hopsack. the flavor is very malty, little rock fruit like plum, but over all dark roasted barly sweetness. a very good example of a scotch ale."
"---"
"Poured with little to no head and there was no lacing. A very nice mahogany brown color, deep and rich looking. Heavy toffee flavors with a little bit of smoke, coffee, and toasted malt. Hops are not present in the aroma. It smells husky (like grain husks). Fairly sweet. Slightly bittered. Mouthfeel is rather thin for a Scotch ale. I am not so much a fan of this, nor McEwans IPA. There are a lot of better beers out there for your money."
"Drinkability: This is a sipping beer in my opinion and I would only have one of these in a sitting."
"Smell is of dark, heavily roasted malts, with a slight hoppy, caramel sweetness, very pleasant. Taste is sweet, slightly alcoholic, and a nice roasted bitterness on the way down. I don't find the alcohol very well hidden in the taste, but the balance between the natural beer flavours and the alcohol is good. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, as befits the style. This is a wonderful sipping beer, and good for a cold winter's eve. Quaffable, even with the high ABV. Just the thing to warm my Winnipeg bones..."
"McEwan's Scotch Ale is all around one of the best beers I have ever had. Nothing is too amazing about its appearance or its mouthfeel, but its taste and drinkability are amazing. Scotch Ale is my favorite style of beer and this one is on the very top of that list. It has a hint of carmel to its taste, but without the coffee hints that some Scotch Ale beers have. Also absoultely no bitterness. I highly recommend this beer to everybody and especially those who enjoy darker beers!"
"This is a great Wee Heavy, more complexity than I remember. Then again the last time I drank this I was in University and ignorant to craft beer. This is a must try, one of Mcewen;s best."
"THE beer which introduced me to the marvellous world of drinking GOOD beer. First, I was rather reticent towards the products of beer, my experiment being rather limited to the Boomerangs, Tornades and other malt-hybrid drinks. What struck me the most at the beginning, it's this incredible aroma of coffee and brandy. The taste is extraordinary! Sugar, sugar and even sugar! The caramel and the molasses are very present in mouth. Still talking about the taste, i can't forget the presence of roast bread. An ideal beer for the long winter nights."
"One and done for me. Having just had a double IPA, then switching to this after dinner, I can see why I appreciate the Pale, Porter and Stout over all else. Nice to challenge with different flavors."
"Pours a clear dark brown with crimson and copper highlights. Two fingered thick and creamy off-white head. Vinous nose. Raisins, plum, toffee. The mouthfeel is full and smooth. Rich, roasted malt flavor. Middle unleashes a flavor of mollasses drenched raisins. Alcohol is present yet not overpowering. Leads to a rather nice warming sensation as it goes down. The finish is dry. I'd recommend letting this beer warm a bit before consumption. Nice scotch ale."
"I think I had this beer at just the right time  after a big meal. Its dessertish in its sweetness, and I really enjoyed it. The color is dark brown with a 1 finger head the settles to a ring of foam. The smell is, in and of itself, sweetness. There smell to be a fruity and sugary architecture to this beer. The taste is caramelly sugary and molasses oriented. Theres not much going on hop-wise here. The feel is smooth and outrageously creamy. I should drink this on its own and see if I like it as much, but for now I can strongly recommend it for an after dinner beverage."
"I like the color of this beer. Its dark brown and barely transparent. Smells boring though. Theres subtle malt in it, but it has an odd popcorn overtone. Not too good. Flavors all right and has a good quality malt, but I suspect some of the sweetness isnt grain related. The finish is also disappointing. Its sour and yeasty with a bit of metal. Cant complain about the mouth feel. Nostalgically, this was one of my first real beers. Although it no longer knocks me off my feet, maybe it would be a good introductory beer for someone just getting into stronger beers."
"Ah, the venerable McEwan's Scotch Ale, an old favorite Scotch Ale. This particular bottle of McEwan's Scotch pours a medium brown with a good amount of carbonation, foaming up quite a bit in my snifter. The white head settles to a collar of foam. I sample the aroma of burnt grains and molasses. The aroma quite as complex as I remember it being. I like the molasses-like flavor of this brew, balanced by the subtle bitterness of roasted grains. Hops aren't really present in this brew, but I know they are there. I seem to recall this beer being a bit more complex, fuller-bodied and not so sugary tasting. It makes me wonder if they've cut a bit of the grain bill with sugar. Scottish and English malt is some of the best in the world -- where has it gone in this beer? Perhaps my tastes have changed (or I'm too spoiled by own homebrew) in the 15 years that I first tried this beer, but this used to be a hearty brew to sip, and it seems almost quaffable to me now. One thing is for certain; that 8 percent alcohol is still there!"
"Very smooth but no complexity at all. Some hints of currants and coffee. Burnt molases in the flavor."
"D - The mouthfeel makes this otherwise straight-up Scotch Ale an incredibly drinkable beverage. But be careful! At 8%, this beer is like getting a two-for-one special in each pint!"
"D: No overpowering flavours, so it should be approachable to the amateur. Enough flavours to keep the geek drinking!"
"Overall, I am surprisingly impressed by this genuine Scotch Ale. It lives up to what I figured would be undeserved hype. Very smooth and easy to drink. Makes the classic saying, 'If it's not Scottish it's craaap' seem accurate--at least in comparison to this one."
"Decent beer, this being the only actual Scottish import where I live, I can see myself buying again."
"I first tried this beer svereal years ago and was not impressed. I still had a bottle in the fridge so I thought I would give it another try. Poured a deep copper color with attriactive head. Smell is of dark caramel and very enjoyable. Taste is excellent with sweet caramel notes. Good malty finish. Much too easy drinking. I'm glad I gave it another try."
"$1.79 for a 12 oz bottle at Once Upon a Vine."
"Pours a dark brown color with a nicely sized white head. The aroma is nutty and creamy. The taste is creamy and smooth. Very nutty with some roasted malt tones. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall, this is a very easy drinking beer. Very enjoyable!"
"First Scotch Ale for me. Pours a dark brown with basically no head, nice lacing though. Has a sweet malty scent. For an 8% brew it has a little aclohol kick which disappears quickly, I like that. I would say this has a medium body with a very nice after taste. Watch yourself on this one, you could drink a few to many. LOL"
"Opaque and dark brown in color, this ale pours with a thick, creamy, light brown head. The aroma consists of a sweet maltiness followed by a light smokiness and a hint of sherry and fruity esters. This heavy-bodied beer is thick, creamy and very malty with a smokiness in the finish along with some notes of sherry in the complex flavor profile. This is no session beer, but the type of beer that you can sip by the fire on a cold winter day... brings a warmth to your cheeks as well as your heart. This is one of my all-time favorite beers and the beer that I judge all strong scotch ales against."
"Overall, one of my favourite brews from abroad. I'd choose this over much of the usual suspects from the overseas imports section, especially those from the UK. It's just a good idea to not make it a session brew..."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. At 8% ABV it's not a session beer by any means, but it's certainly not undrinkable. However, that 8% will definitely sneak up on you. I'm drinking it in July, but I'd rather it be January. A good winter warmer."
"I'd hope for a tad more complexity, but it is nevertheless solid overall and a pleasure to drink."
"Kick ass aromma combining dark bruits, toffee. Almost a burbon taste (not cask aged?) along with the fruits and toffee caramelized malt flavers. Slick medium mouthfeel and very nice drinkability. Want to have an excellent Wee Heavy -Scotch Ale - here it is."
"one-finger dark, creamy head. head recedes quickly to a fine layer that then will not give up. a little lace left from receding head. very dark. smell alcohol with a faint roasty, smoky, and malty. tastes strongly of smoke and sweet malt. finishes slightly dry for such a malty monster. pretty tasty, big beer."
"Dark, dark brown, short-lived head that settles to a film, reasonably good lace. Flat, sweet and sour, and boozy. Burned molasses aftertaste. Ick."
"The beer reminds me of Porto to an extend, maybe because my bottle was cellared for a year and a half. The beer left a nice touch of carbonisation that came to trick the palate. Some fruity touches are there, especially cherry. Hide very well its alcohol content and very smooth for its style."
"Slàinte mhath!"
"Drinkability: A great winter beer, this was also enjoyable on a cooler spring night. Not very sessionable, but very drinkable."
"This beer is a deep ruby color in a well lit room. It poured up heavy with almost no foam even with an aggressive pour. The aroma is subtle. Slightly fruity, cherry maybe, with a bit of alcohol. The taste is mildly fruity with an alcohol finish that warms the belly. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel lets it go down easy. As it warms the roasted malt flavor starts to come out. Overall, a nice beer. Better than I was expecting. The packaging is nothing exciting. Comes across as a beer that has been around for ever. I would recomend it."
"A very unique brew. Unlike any other I think I have ever had. Poured out to a dark brown color with a head that left traces around the class, but dissipated rather quickly. Very strong odors of caramel were noted on the nose, with hints of herbs and earth. Flavor is very thick, like over cooked caramel and sugar, with a touch of alcohol, smoke, and a very minimal amount of chemical on the palate. Again, this is not an everyday brew, but worth a try, and not bad for certain occasions. Worth a try."
"Taste: Malty! It doesn't get much more caramel malt than this, the body is robust enough and the alcohol and hop finish are not too overwhelming."
"My only previous experience with McEwan's Scotch Ale was over a decade ago when a co-worker raved about it and brought me one from her personal stash. I thought it was okay, but my impression (that I've carried with me all these years) was that it was 'too sweet and too thick'. Well, it's neither. It is a pretty good version though and is one that I enjoyed while it lasted."
"Not bad. Dark brown with a decent head that stayed for a few minutes. Aromas of hazlenut, roasted chicory, and caramel. Taste is a bit oily with overtones of chocolate and baking dark bread, coffee, and a definite caramel sweetness. I enjoyed this one. Could have had a bit more carbonation, and I enjoy some spiciness in my palate. I wasn't sorry I tried it, though. Very drinkable, even at 8% ABV."
"Drinkability: It was my first scotch ale and I loved it. I was not so sure about dark beers, but this one helps me to appreciate them. Recommended."
"It pours a dark brown color, nearly black, with a creamy, sticky, dense head. The smell is sweet, but not exactly malty-sweet. Rather, its a syrupy, sugary sweet smell. Some hops and yeast are present in the aroma as well. Plum and ripe berry? The taste is syrupy sweet and notably bitter. The two play off each other, but are quite distinct. Its not so much a balance, but rather a face-off. Its thick, dense, and very satisfying. The brew also has a minimal sourness that shows up in the mid-taste. Also, theres a little metallic tang in the finish. Its drinkable, accessible, and very good. I like my Scotch Ales to have a little more of a pronounced malt smell and complexity today. Still, this is a solid brew."
"I've seen this beer almost every time I go beer shopping, but today was the first time I saw any singles. I think that, having finally tried it, I won't hesitate to pick up the odd six-pack in the future."
"A very good beer, one of the first ""imports"" that I had and loved. A bit pricey, but worth it as a treat. Pours a deep deep amber color. Smells of peat smoke, slightly reminds me of wiskey/scotch. Taste is lush full of carmelly goodness, slight vinous notes (perhaps due to aging), and again that smokeyness comes back into play. Mouthfeel is clean and quick, the alcohol is well hidden in this one. I like the color on this and the smokey taste, it's a great beer, but something I wouldn't want more than 1 of in an evening."
"Pours an opaque brown with ruby highlights and a cream coloured head, OK retention. Attractive lacing. Aroma of caramel, roasted malt and some dark fruits. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, full bodied. Sweet, fruity, roasty and a weird tartness. Some coffee like flavour. It's packed with alcoholic punch. Good for after dinner."
" Tastes as good today as when I first tried it in ' 81 when pisswater ruled the US beer market. Still one of the best brews from the UK."
"This is a fairly average offering in liquor stores round the Calgary area, but it is one I can never pass up: this is a very flavourful beer by any means, though it is the most mass-produced of the Scotch ales. Ruby darkness in the appearance, with enough head at first, but then dropping to less than a cm. Light brown head, leaving patchy lacing. I love the hue of amber/red glow to this beer. The colour itself is almost appetising. The aroma is my favourite part of the beer. Sweet candy, or blueberry gum, rich sweet malt that evokes red licorice, candy cane, sweet bread, sourdough, and other sweet confectionaries. The taste is not as full as the aroma. This is a sweet offering from the time it hits your tongue to the time it leaves your breath: up front there are cherries and Irish-red tastes. In the middle are more smoky, toasted grain notes. The aftertaste is smoky and extremely grainy, like many of this nation's finer whiskies. The hops are there, adding a touch of balance and grass to the finish. The mouthfeel is well carbonated, full, and heavy. You can taste this beer on the tongue long after you have finished. Drinkability is limited by the sweetness and heaviness. Personal verdict: this is a beer I can drink quite regularly, even though I am of the McGregor clan."
"Hmm, darker than I had expected and wow.. sweet smelling.. before i can even see the head I'm hit with smell. Anyways.. in order.. a dark amberbrown with slight red tinting around the edges with a cream colored head that stays pretty steady across the top in very very small tight circles. The smell reminds me of my wifes bread maker, with alcohol sitting in the bottom, smells like a doppelbock/stout mix. The flavor is slightly nutty and faint.. but the mouthfeel is nice.. the flavor creeps all the way across the mouth without lingering to much in one area, and it keeps that slightly sweet flavor through out.. very hard to describe flavor.. it leans towards a stout with the breadiness of a doppel yet lighter. hmm.. wonder if that made any sense"
"This is my first scotch ale and I have a feeling there must be better ones out there. This one poured a decent dark brown color with a nice brownish head that was nice a thick. The smell was inviting with great sweet fruit scents and a nice sweet malt smell as well. The taste was a bit of a let down though with a kind of one dimentional oak flavor and lots of vanilla sweetness. Those flavors were good, but they needed to be balanced out a little by something else."
"I could easily drink three or four of these, but the powerful woody/malty taste might kill my taste buds after awhile."
"12 oz. bottle, no freshness date, just some funny code on the neck label. Pours a deep dark brown, with no highlights. Very bright white creamy head. Head retention was fair. A great amount of sticky lace left on the sides of the glass. Deep malty smell, slighlty smoky with butterscotch. Sweet taste up front, carmel flavors. Slightly smoky flavor, along with some vanilla. Big malt flavor here, very little bitterness. Very little hop flavor or bitterness. Lingering sewwt almost chocolate-like finish. Almost cloying. Medium body, low carbonation. I really liked this beer more as it warmed. Slight warming from the alcohol. Overall, a pretty decent brew. I don't think that more than one in a session is for me, but a good nightcap."
"355 mL brown bottle with best before date clearly marked on rear label."
"Interesting stuff to be sure. Dark brown color, with a slight, light tan head. Smell is sweet and malty, with the slightest hint of hops. Taste is very sweet, heavy with malt, hints of camel and oak also. Mouth feel is quite thick, slighly syrupy. Definitely heavy. I had a feeling it was going to be strong, but 8% caught me off gaurd. I didnt notice it printed on the bottle till I was about half way though. Over all not bad, if maybe a little sloppy on its blend of flavors. I might try this again, but not until I try some better wee heavys."
"This beer poured a nice dark tea color with a thin cover of head overtop of the beer. The nose was caramelized sweetness...very nice, but not as much or a roasted note as I had expected. The taste had a bit of a roasted character, but most of the flavor was sweet caramel/brown sugar malty goodness. A nice flavor overall. The moutfeel was moderate to thick. Drinkability on this one was okay. The malts seemed too sweet and not really balanced. It was a good beer, but just not my favorite."
"Pours a clear copper color with a billowy light beige head. Some lacy stickage on the side of the glass. Obviously malty-based, some yeastiness, caramelly, faintly fruity, and slightly woody; all components of its simple, yet intricate nose. Vegetal and woody in its malt, very earthy and vinous. Slight suggestions of caramel, honey and toffee. Light astringency in the finish from multiple malts and subtle hops of the low-alpha variety. Not as earthy and peaty as I would have expected from a Scotch ale. Fairly well-carbonated for its style. A bit balanced too much toward the sweet side without providing an earthy, drying content for its 8% ABV. Alcohol is noticable, but layered under sticky sweetness, which doesn't remind me much of its root style."
"Light to medium body. Not as flavorful as other scotch ales I've had. This one was nice to drink at a very slow pace."
"Overall: Not one of the Worlds greatest Scotch Ales, ironic as it is a native. But perhaps this has faded a tad, and is a shadow of its former self from its younger days thanks to corporate greed. Nonetheless, a decent enough brew, but could well be a let down for those expecting the definitive Scotch, because it isnt."
"This beer poured very brown, almost chewy in appearance. A definite meal in a bottle :) It had a pleasant, malty,sweet smell that seems to be the norm for ales brewed in Great Britain. It's taste was a bit odd , but this is the first Scotch Ale that I have ever tried. It was almost like burnt raisins soaked in alcohol...The peaty, earthy taste was a interesting change from the normal everyday beer. All in all it was an ok experience and I would rank the drinkability much higher, but after half a beer I already have a warm fuzzy feeling going on... Not a session brew, unless you want to wake up in a strange place."
"The mouthfeel is solid with a slickness that I'll attribute to the higher ABV. Overall this is a good Scotch Ale and a solid choice. It's one of the better beers that's widely available."
"this beer has a very warming feeling on the stomach. good for a cold day. eat something along with it. i let mine set out of the frideg for a bit before consuming. id have to say i enjoy this scotch ale immensly. its hard to say that since i have only had one , so Hopefully i will be back to review another soon."
"Umm, that's tasty. Slides across the tongue with a plum/prune flavor that finishes with a sweet yet slightly bitter taste to it. This is a fine example of a Scotch ale."
"Drinkability: This is where I think this beer shines. You'd never know this was a Wee-Heavy with 8% ABV just by tasting it. It goes down so smooth that I think I could drink these all night long. I think this is my favorite Scotch Ale, and certainly the easiest to sip. A very good beer."
"Drinkability: If I were stuck on a lonely island in the outer Hebrides, and St. Andrew appeared with offerings of just one beer for the rest of my days to enjoy on a cold, deserted hard rock, I'd have little hesitation on my request."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a heavenly malty aroma that boasts of pale and lots of crystal malts. It seems a bit sweet, but with a warm alcohol scent. The taste is good. It has a rich malty flavor that goes down slow and warms on the finish. It has a refreshing fruity yeast finish and excellent mouthfeel. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine wee heavy Scotch ale. It has great aroma and flavor. This is a brew for those cold fall or winter days."
"Picked this up in the 12oz bottle, poured a very dark cherry color with a fat cream head. Smell is of Kahlua with roasted malts and sugar tones. The taste is very maple syrupy, very sweet and full bodied. Malts are subtle and fruitness blends well with the alcohol. A very drinkable beer, have had a few since for an after dinner affair with a nice Cohiba cigar. Great for dessert, must say to thick and creamy to drink alot of. Serve this after dinner with guests, a great cooking beer as well."
"If its not Scottish, its CRAP! Recommended"
"The color is a dark brown with reddish tints. Not much head that dissapeared quickly. The only aroma I could get was a light sweet malt aroma. This could be due to the fact it was served kinda cold. I let it sit and breathe for a while but thanks to the unseasonly cold weather it was not very warm in the bar. The flavor started with a nice sweet carmel note at the tip of the tongue followed by a quick short surge of alcohol over the sides of the tongue. The finish was a good smooth maltyness that made it self to home at the back of my throat. I could definitly sit and enjoy a couple of these. These is my favorite from the McEwans Line."
"It's not wee, and it's not heavy, and it's not even my brother, but it is tasty. My socks aren't knocked off, but I don't mind keeping them on sometimes. The ABV is a touch high, but you feel it more than taste it or smell it, and it does nothing to stop you from having another. The earthiness is a nice touch, making it different enough to be interesting. Something tells me I'll be back this way again, should the spirit move me."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness dating. Pours dark molassas in color. Peat, earthyness and malt in the nose. White, tiny bubble head and leaves a fair bit of lace. Sticky, smooth malt, carries the day. Notes of earth, must, peat, caramel,toffee, cinnimon etc come foward here. Rich and syrupy, tasty stuff. Nice rich flavors balanced by a dry finish. Worth trying, nice brew for a cold damp night."

"This is my first Wee Heavy, and it's a good one. I hear there are better, I want to try them because this is pretty good."
"Pours a beep ruby-brown color with little to no head.Malty aroma-hints of toffee,butter.Malty upfront flavor-some residual sweetness.Very slight bitterness.Full enough mouthfeel I like them to be a bit ""bigger"" feeling.A decent enough beer-quite drinkable.not as big as I remember it.One of my favorite styles of beer-try this as your first ""scotch ale"" and go up from there."
"Very sweet and syrupy, it becomes fatiguing on the tastebuds, but is a quality brew and a good representative of the style. Heavy and rich, I wouldn't drink more than one of these at a time. This is very much a brew to enjoy over 1/2 hour or so."
"The body is thick and creamy, which does not prepare us for the short (but perky) after taste."
"A decent Scotch Ale, could be a little bolder in the taste and not so sweet."
"A fantasic beer. Tastes great and goes down easy. Excellent!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, small beige head formed and quickly disappeared. Brew is a beautiful dark brown, with reddish highlights. Slightly above average lacing, what little that does stay behind doesn't move an inch. Malty aroma, with slight tinges of light fruits and ethanol. Quite malty in the mouth, but smooth like silk on the tongue. The fruity and alcohol flavors comes together at the end in a great duo. An excellent representation of the style."
"Pretty good stuff. Not as raw or rugged as I'd like, but I'll take it."
"Pours out a clear dark brown-mahogony color with a smallish white head. Aroma is full of caramel malt, along with a meaty Bovril type aroma. Very nice taste, which at first is subtle, then explodes into a malt monster. Sweet & bready malts dominate the platate. Caramale flavors zing across the tongue, along with the burnt food/meaty character. There is a good tinge of alcohol here too, but nothing offensive.The mouthfeel is full and thick, yet slick and not syrupy. Drinkability is high, especially for something so rich. This is my benchmark for scotch ales."
"Drinkability is a little bit limited due to overall sweetness but still pretty good."
"Lots of alcohol. Beats your run-of-the-mill beer and Ok in a session. Some syrup sweetness or medicinal and carbonation like your no-name micro on-tap. A subtle nutty plumness. Pleasant tan color and head. Best with food or to complement some single malt scotches."
"The Scotch ale poured black with hints of red and a quickly dissolving head. The nose is a little fruit and a little toffee. Finished with a mild sourness, but is made up for by the lingering roastiness and grassiness. Overall, a passable example of the style."
"the drinkability took a hit when i found it to be gross toward the bottom, it's sick when it warms up a bit. i had trouble finishing it nd would be reluctant to drink it again. a shame too because i remember likeing these as a kid. damn."
"The appearance is ""merely"" good. It's a dark brown with a nice creamy head. Drinkability is also ""merely"" good because I wouldn't want an entire sixer of this stuff, but 2 or 3 would be an excellent night cap! This remains one of my favorite malty beers."
"Pours a clear dark mahogany with a small beige head. The head quickly dissipates and left only some minimal lacing. Plenty of malt on the nose, toffee and butterscotch abound. Exquisite mouthfeel, thick and chewy with minimal carbonation. Taste is smoky sweet, with plenty of butterscotch and toffee. A lot of dark fruit around, as well. Hops aren't really apparent other than to lend a decent balance to the sweetness.Nothing here that conceals the alcohol burn, but not a bad thing on a snowy night that's way below freezing outside. Somewhat smoky and syrupy aftertaste that ends up rather clean. This very tasty Scotch Ale is an excellent addition to a winter cellar."
"From the forcefullness of the initial sweetness and the alcohol kick, this is not a beer that you would drink a 12-pack of and call it a night. This is a true sipping beer. I can imagine drinking this while eating some walnuts, chestnuts, or pistachios while sitting by the fireplace. The near-cloying sweetness does deduct some points from the drinkability, but this is a good all-round brew to warm up with during the winter."
"Kinda made my teeth scream."
"This is quite a tasty brew! Only difference I notice in the older brew isless alcohol presence and lower carbonation. Good flavors!"
"Too sweet for a session ale, this one is best left for dessert, or a cold winter's night in front of a fire."
"Bottle - This one pourred a dark brew with a very small head. Very low carbonation with a nice roastiness/caramel taste. Medium body and well hidden alcohol taste. The only disapointment is the ending with a strange watery aftertaste that I did not enjoyed."
"Another excellent scotch ale that pours a muddy reddish colour with almost no tan head. The aromas are all scotch and various malts. The taste is a malty treat, with some big-time booze in the mixture. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy on the palate and the drinkability is not the best either...but...overall this is a very excellent scotch ale!"
"Notes: Big, full-flavored beer with cloying, Robutussin-like qualities; nevertheless, found this rather enjoyable... but then I also found my friend's home-made ""Flaming Homer"" rather tasty as well."
"Nice dark choclate appearance. Smell seemed a bit off..some malt tones, but with a somewhat ""off"" aroma. Taste was good and mouthfeel was heavy,,,which is understandable, considering high abv. Some smoky malty tastes, but definitely a sipping brew. Drinkability was very good for a fine sipping brew. Good choice for mid winter in front of the fireplace."
"Nice dark, rich, amber body, but capped with a small off-white head. Big malt aromas, slight smokiness; reminds me of fresh cut hardwood. Those big malts dominate the taste, giving it a strong, yet sweet cookie flavor, and lots of caramel. Very smooth transition to a slightly bitter, peat-soaked, yet still malty sweet finish. Pretty good, although, I've always been a fan of Scotch ales."
"Pours a headless ""beer-bottle-brown"" and smells like ""beer"". Taste is a smoky, malty sweet butterscotch....thick and full. Can't miss the alcohol...I sense the threat of a hangover with any more than two bottles, but I suppose it depends on your expertise. Doesn't taste bad, but is eccentric due to the sweet malt and few hops in the brew. It's a unique beer that will be sampled at least annually at my house. Funny, but I can't imgine any meals going with this; as strong as it is, it would be best as an aperitif, after-dinner drink, or general all-around aphrodisiac...depending on who your eating and drinking with, I guess."
"Updated 12-26-04: My original review was fairly brief and indescriptive. I do like it as much as I did then, with it's strong alcohol flavors, raisin and roasted malt tones, and full mouthfeel."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown body with sort of a thin tan bubbly head lacing patterns nice thin sheets of foam. Aroma: Chocolate, slightly smoked peated malt aromatics here a sweet alcoholic nectar mixture of the smoked darker roasts take the forefront but what an aroma very nice brew here. Taste: Malty strong flavor a searing ripple of scotch malts the smokiness and chocolate tones are completely evident wow this is an extraoridnary beer that is the epitome of the style we're dealing with here. Mouthfeel: Not as full as the flavor but still a medium to wee heavy body, wow it's just good. Drinkability: After having beers like McEwan's IPA how can one transition so well to their Scotch Ale because it's so fucking good one of the best blends of heavy flavors to mix and complement eachother out of any beer, and at 8% abv this beer will definitely stir something up within your beer loving soul."
"Dark clear amber with light tan lace. Sweet fruity nose with a touch of coffee maybe? Velvet malt coats the palatte only to clear slowly to a sweet toffeelike finish that lingers for quite a while. The alcohol is very evident right before the finish. Almost no hop presence when cold, and it fades altogether as this brew warms. The malt is vivid throughout, but as it warms, the sweet aclohol flavor takes over. Excellent brew for an excellent style."
"Taste is surprisingly creamy and smooth. Rich, sweet and malty . Nutty undertones. Smoky and spicy. A bit salty? A lightly dry and bitter finish in contrast to the overall malty sweetness. Very malty and sweet aftertaste. Body is a bit lighter than I'm used to with a Scottish Ale but it's very well balanced and remarkably drinkable for a beer of 8% ABV. Very solid brew to add to your selections."
"Smooth, velvet malty taste in my opinion. The alchohol taste lingers, but it is not dominant. Dark ruby pour color. Meduim lace with a nice but of head. As my only other comparision in this style is bellhaven, I must say this is differnt, but in a good way. dry finish complements the roasted part of the taste. A nicely balanced beer, not bad at all"
"Pours a deep red with a tan head and a sticky lace. The head died early. The aroma is rich and malty--thick with caramel. Taste is sweet and of roasted malt with a good representation of a mid section and a dry finish. Many wine qualities. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with low carbonation and a biting end. This is not a complex beer, but it has a pretty good balance and is quite drinkable for a strong ale."
"I could get use to this Scottish ale. A beautiful mahogany colour with a nice looking head. It is very heavy and it seemed that every smell and taste was represented in every mouthful. I think I'll try this again with a meal - something like Scotch pie with cream caramel. It really struck me as a meal brew. Maybe, its the high alcohol; hard to imagine sitting around drinking this on a Sunday afternoon."
"Overall, not my favorite, but I've had worse, way worse. Would drink again, but I won't go looking for it. Not that I have to, around here it seems to be the only scotch ale you can find."
"Mouthfeel is so creamy and lush...truly awesome. No bitterness to be found. Slightly sweet aftertaste, which is fine by me. I guess I am different, but I love this beer! Recommended!"
"I really enjoy drinking and rating Scottish Ales and this one was another one that I enjoyed.It poured a large sized creamy tan head that contained fine-medium sized bubbles that was mostly diminishing.The body was dark brown with some carbonation observed.The hue of this beer was dark brown and the nose was lightly malty and sweet.The mouthfeel was a little thick, smooth and medium bodied.This beer did leave very little lacing on the sides of my glass."
"Dark brown color, medium head. A medium bodied scotch ale. Malts are roasted and slightly smoky. Mild hops but they are noticeable. The smoky malts predominate. Mouthfeel is full and round. Aftertaste is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Small, no tiny head on a dark, red body. Alcohol is readily apparent on the nose. Aroma of that dark-hard crusted bread with the tan-gray soft and chewy inside that I had with lunch yesterday. Alcohol is the most readily apparent feature on the palate, followed by the malt, with the hops being rather shy. Brown sugar and wet earth. There is some over-ripe fruit flavors, I cannot put my finger on. The alcohol and sweetness character of this beer dominate to a degree I do not appreciate. But a good enough beer not to turn down."
"Not McAuslan's - not nearly - but perfect after a day in the cold ocean wind on the coastal outcrops of 'the island'."
"I like it."
"Pours a light brown, almost red color with a good size head (just how a scotch ale should look). Has a strong alcohol aroma. Tatste is very sweet. Lots of caramel here. Alcohol is not near as strong in taste as it was in aroma. Little in the hops dept. Goes down smooth. This one tastes how a scotch ale should taste."
"Dark brown color with a bit of redness. Aroma is a bit sweet with chocolate and carmel. The taste is full of a dark sweet maltiness with a lightly balanced pine hop character and an alcoholic finish. The body is heavy and gives a creamy texture that makes the flavors linger in your mouth. High alcohol content makes this a good beer to drink once in a while."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with slight red hues. It has a small head and not much lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and malty with small hints of the alcohol. The taste is fairly sweet also. There is also some fruit in the taste, but I cannot pinpoint what it is exactly. Very smooth - the alcohol is only partially masked in the taste, but blends very well. The aftertaste is somewhat dry, but still pleasant. Good Beer - but you have to get used to the taste before it can be appreciated well."
"Poured fairly dark but did not retain it's head. The smell of the wonderful toasted malts made this ale very alluring before the first taste. The taste was very good but with a little bit too much of an alcohol finish. The mouthfeel was smooth. The drinkability of this is very good-this is one beer I will definitely have another sample of."
"Drinkability: High points are given to the complexity. Can't drink tooo much of this beer. It's just too heavy. That's not a bad thing though. The alcohol is a little overdone. Dare I say, the character of the malt needs to be more pronounced?"
"Drinkability/notes: A very, very good beer. Be warned, though, it is very sweet and potent; correct for the style, but possibly would disappoint hop enthusiasts. This is an excellent winter beer or aperitif. I suspect it would appeal to the ladies as well."
"Had a very odd off aroma that was best categorized as vegetal. After this faded, it became clear the bottle was slightly oxidized. Aroma of fruit and a slight bite came through. Creamy persistent head. Brown in color with a small red highlight. Initially got a raisiny sweetness. Rume like flavors. Alcohol not very pleasant. Pretty simple in it's approach to the style. Light bodied and fairly creamy mouthfeel. Very easy drinking, but not something I would seek out."
"Had a moderate length finish that was dry but with burps and other hints of that first quick malt taste. Good thick malt body though still toward the watery end of the mouthfeel spectrum. Definitely a good session beer for the winter; could be better in the pattern of how its elements are blended. An easy pick to have around for those interminable winters..."
"The flavor starts out sweet with a bit of alcohol, and then the malts continue to stand strong. This is a pretty big beer. It is full of body and flavor, rich and smooth till the last drop. I really enjoyed the boldness of this beer. It does not want to stand back at all, but it prefers to be right up in your face with a big blast of sweet malt. Not what I would call a drinker, but it is a good one."
"What a great dessert!.....I mean BEER! Talk about SWEET caramel maltiness! The aroma and flavor are strongly malty like this. Alcohol comes through in the finish. It's kinda chewy in the mouthfeel and also very smooth with a low carbonation feel. This beer kicks ass, and it will kick your ass as well. Plan for an awesome lacing effect from the head, a very dark amber color with clarity, and some serious malty and alcohol bite! It's yummy for dessert or in my case any occassion."
"Woah. Sweet, sweet, cheesy (?) smell. The front is sweet candy and some caramel. The middle is thick, malty with butterscotch leading to a bready finish. The aftereffect is slightly cloying and warming. This is pretty good, with well-hidden alcohol. But it's a little too sweet for my tastes. Some hops would help."
"Pours nicely with lots of little bubbles streaming to the top of the glass to create a decent orange-hued head. Clear dark amber in color. The smell is of chocolate malt, fruit, and strong bolts of hop. Some alcohol fumes also join the mix. Creamy and big, this beer has a unique taste - starts with more of the fruit and then goes straight into rich malt and something else I can't figure. Maybe yeast. Almost tastes somewhat peaty. The high alcohol content adds a nice warming element without interfering with the flavor. I like this beer, but the unique flavors make me think that I won't be a regular drinker- maybe four or five times per year."
"This is one of my favorite beers for a long time. It is a great beer to sit by the camp fire with and let it help you warm up from the inside. I have only had it from the bottle and anxiously await to find someplace with it on tap. The sweet malty flavor and hint of scotch not only wake up the senses but also let you know this is not a weak beer. With the higher alcohol content, you must be careful with it, and the flavor does not make it a beer you can drink a lot of in one sitting. It pours nice and dark with a nice measured head. Me likey."
"All things considered it is a good beer but I was expecting something much more malty being a scotch ale. The smell is very plain with almost no hops but the color is a nice deep red-brown with a nice tan head. Drinkability rates rather high, you can hardly notice the 8 percent alcohol. I would get it again but not a favorite."
"McEwan’s pours a reddish brown with a nice tan head with a moderate life. The nose was sweet and fruity malt with hop highlights. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with a nice fruity malt flavor with slight hop tones. This is not as good as their IPA but it is still a very good beer."
"This beer poured into the glass root beer colored with red highlights. The head was thick, creamy and full, tan/cream in color that went from darker to lighter as it stretched to the rim of the glass. The lace was present and sticky as it was pulled down the glass. The aromas that came out of the glass were of sweet dark malt, some roasted malt tones, caramel, sweet dark berries, some yeast and alcohol were present but faint. At first sip I said to the wife that I like this beer, nice and smooth with some sweetness in both the nose and the taste. Flavors of sweetness filled my mouth, sweet malts, sweet dark berries, some sugars, roasted malts, the warmth of alcohol all danced across my tongue in harmony and without a single hop to be found which surprised me. This beer left a creamy sensation in my mouth and was a very pleasant experience. This bottle was # 8 in a list of six (for that 40% discount on six-packs) that I handed the bartender. Lucky for me they were out the other 2 so that I could experience this sweet dark elixir of goodness."
"Liked the mahogany rich color,reasonable head very appetizing looking.Smell was a little punget on mine,I liked the malty sweet taste very alcholic tasting but that is fine with me.Had this on tap the first time I drank this at Molly McQ's in Lakeland ,Florida"
"potent winter warmer that helps take those edges off the soul. Cheers."
"I first had McEwan's back before I had tried as many strong beers as I have in the last year or so, and at the time thought it was too sweet and too strong. Drinking it now, it is neither. The beer this reminds me most of (despite the obvious differences) is Moretti LaRosa. Both are sweet and malty, warming and tasty. McEwans pours quite dark (mahogany), with a medium size head. Carbonation is evident, and is the first thing you notice. It is followed by a tasty, biscuity malt taste which is quite appealing. The overall feel is good, but I couldn't drink more than one or two at a time. A nice, unique beer. For those who like malty, stronger beers, don't miss this one."
"All in all a great beer for sitting by the fire with the wife..nice."
"McEwan's poured a brown color with amber tones when help up to a light. There was a small head but it dissipated quickly leaving just a ring around the glass. The smell was malty and sweet. I thought the taste was surprisingly sweet with a lot of malt flavoring. There was also a little bit of spice in the taste, probably from the alcohol. This brew went down smooth but had a little bit of kick to it. This is a good sipping beer."
"Dark deep clear brown color, off white foamy, creamy head. Malty caremel smokey aroma, sweet, a little too sweet and smokey medium to full body with a nice rounded roasty bitter mouthfeel, some sour sweetness in the lasting sticky finish, I like this one."
"This was not a bad beer at all. While it probably will not make it into my regular rotation, I will possibly pick some up from time to time."
"Mohogany body with a good-sized oatmeal-colored head that sticks around for a bit. Very light lacing. Caramel/Toffee aroma with brown sugar a little alcohol. Some winey notes in the taste, the malt body reminds me a lot of the sam adams double bock body that I had the night before. The mouthfeel is thick and a little syrupy, but not too much. It is very drinkable and very pleasing. Overall something that I would definitely pick up again, a great winter treat."
"This would be excellent with rich, hearty, spicy food. Classic!"
"Deep dark brown, ruby tints at spots, off-white head, smallish, not enough staying power or lace. Big rummy-raisin nose, some malt. Big malty-chocolate taste, raisin, a whisper of charred wood, alcohol is very noticeable on the palate warms the tummy too. Thick like syrup, sweet like syrup too. Somewhat versatile, but it seems to be lacking something though (hops), too straightforward. Must be sipped. Bottom line: I didnt care all that much for McEwans Scotch Ale, I wont drink it again (at least for awhile) but you can."
"Pours a very dark brownish ruby color with a creamy white head that dissipates into a nice sticky lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts with notes of dark candied fruits and a bit of alcohol. Taste is a malty sweetness with notes of fresh coffee and buttery caramel. Smooth and creamy in the mouth and quite enjoyable overall. A very nice Scotch ale."
"This was my first scotch ale. I must say that it totally got me hooked on them. It had a nice strong taste of a mild coffee roast, mixed with some chocolate undertones. There was some taste of alcohol in it, but it didn't overpower the coffee taste. It had a nice thick head to it, but it seceded after a little while. After taste was kind of like Newcastle, but richer in the ""nuttiness""."
"Poured so dark brown that it was on the verge of being black, with a light brown foam that disapated quickly. The aroma was of a sweet malty nature with a slight smell of alcohol. The taste was a sweet malty, fruity flavor with a hint of prunes. Not really bitter, but just enough of sweetness to off set the bitterness."
"With a nice full and syrupy mouthfeel and potent alcohol content, this is definitely not a session beer, but it does have its moments and should join your beer rotation as a regular visitor."
"Pours dark with a good creamy head. Taste is very malty and sweet. Very faint hoppiness. The malt is where the taste is. Heavy alcohol going down. Almost an iodine type aftertaste. This is a good starter beer for Scotch Ale drinkers. It's quite expensive $7.99 and up for a six pack but worth a try."
""
"Pours a dark amber with a big white head.  Big malty flavor with caramel tones and a little bread like flavor.  Alcohol comes through in the flavor but not overpowering.  Smooth for a high abv beer."
"Clear dark ruby appearance.  Creamy, somewhat bubbly, beige head sits on top.  Good staying power.  Laces adequately.  A sweet malty aroma, but not overwhelming.   Taste is rather inhibited for a Scotch ale.  There's some matly tones, but not nearly deep or complex enough to rate this highly.  Some traces of alcohol land of the palate throughout.  A caramel matliness is the domineering characteristic.  Medium to full in body.  Not a bad beer by any means, but compared to my ""Standard"" for all Scotch Ales, McRogue, this one is nowhere near the quality."
"Pours a clear dark amber/brown with a massive cream colored head that lasts fairly well.  The smell is that of a semi-sweet cough syrup and light bread smell.  The ultra creamy mouthfeel is quite nice and contains a very light caramel and licorace taste with fresh baked bread taste in the background.  Pretty nice tasting brew overall and is nicely balanced with light hops.  I personally like a little more hop, but that's just me.  An interesting experience.  Slainte!"
"Pours to a deep ruby color with a creamy off-white head.  It has a caramel-like smell, and a sweet-malty smell.  There is a definative malty-sweetness to the taste, along with a bit of spiciness.  It has a sutble bitterness and a soothing alcohoic warmth in the finish.  Overall, it is a rich, full-bodied beer the would pair well with a good book, and a cold winter's night."
"This is a ""Staple"" beer, one I keep on hand at all times, as I do Optimator, and a few others. Pours a nice deep brown, generous beige head, and fair lace. The nose is malt laden and slightly sweet, hints of lightly toasted grain, front is sweet and has a fair malt profile, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is hop spicy with a fair to average acidity, the hops relatively spicy and the aftertaste quite dry, good drinkable scotch ale."
"It looks fine with a mocha cream head that lasts. The aromas are shy at first but, as it warms, there is a deep, integrated complex of black walnut, Russian black bread, and perfect cappucino. The flavors are perched atop a rich velour of beaver fur and feature notes of sweet broiled caramel, rarebit, maple timbers and Alpine spring water. Better than it was three years ago, but not exactly bliss either (a little watery in the mid-palate.)"
"Well I really like this beer, dark full bodied scotch ale with a small off-white creamy head.  The carmel malt is very very good, and not to to strong.  A light hop taste that does not bitter and and has no after taste.  The taste of the strong alcohol content is not that strong which is what I was afraid of, but it did not happen.  Do not drink to many someone will have to cary you out."
"P.S. Four or five of these, and you won't remember what youre drinking."
"The brew pours a dark amber/ruby color with a great dark tan/light brown head that rings the glass excellently.  The aroma has an excellent caramel malt aroma to it that has some nice breadiness to it along with the nice alcohol aroma that accompanies it with some weak peatish characteristics.  Great sweet maltiness with some nice caramel qualities to it and a nice peatish flavor with some very nice bready qualities to it that give the brew an excellently smooth mouthfeel and there is also a great slightly warming alcohol quality to this brew.  This is an excellently drinkable brew that I will be looking forward to trying again."
"Deep dark brown with a fizzy white head....nose is of alcohol and sweet fruit sugars...very little carbonation in the mouth...smoooth....you can't taste the alcohol at first but the alcohol bites a little on the finish...I love the flavor....very sweet..almost like molasses....as you drink this it becomes a little overwhelming but it's right up my alley....a big sweet beer that would go perfect with desert. I may make this my after Thanksgiving dinner pie eating beer....might pair better with caramel rolls or chocolate cake....I haven't eaten either in about a year(all extra calories go for beer right??) but I think it would be a nice combo...this isn't for everyone but I sure enjoy it....my first Scotch Ale...I must try more...."
"Deep, dark -brown color with a creamy head that that leaves nice lace. Roasted and slight coffee aroma. Very full-bodied with a rich flavor and hints of scotch. Real nice mouthfeel.  Tasty but more of a sipping brew. Nice as a nightcap but I doubt I could swallow down more than a bottle of this."
"Dark with a very light tan head with decent retention. The color and head alone make you want a taste of this beer. As it reaches your nose, there's no doubt that this is a scotch ale. Strong scotch/alcohol smell with hints of creamy coffee. Smoky, chewy, and malty flavor with definite alcohol presence. Makes me want to eat spicy chicken. When served at the proper temperature, this is one of my favorite beers. To me, very drinkable, but it can be too strong for some."
"Deep dark rich copper color, with a tight tan head. Slight malty earthy smell, very rich and inviting. Taste was noticably malty, alcohol, wood, earthy undertones. Roasted barley malt, hints of scotch. Very complex, rich beer. Much better tasting than I thought. Balanced flavors, no one dominates. This is a definite belly warmer, only one at a sitting for me. This would the perfect treat, after a windy, rainy, cold winter round at St. Andrews."
"Pours with a uniform darkness with dark copper tones.  Head is compact but surprisingly persistent.  Aromas are muted but taste is straightforward: a sweet start bowing to alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel is excellent--as smooth as the taste.  This beer has always been among my favorite nightcaps."
"Delicious!"
"Notes: Undoubted as good dessert beer or as a night cap with a cigar, to drink on its own is too much for some. Big time sipping brew that should be consumed at cellar temperature. As far as Scotch Ales go, I have had better and locally brewed at that."
"214"
"Reddish-brown, thin head. Smells like maple syrup. Maly and maple, sweet and thick. Heavy but smooth. I really like this on its own, no food close to it."
"Like malt? Like Scotch? Try McEwans Scotch Ale. This Scotch Ale packs quite a punch and actually made me sweat while quaffing."
"Deep, clear chestnut brown appearance.  Head settles at a thin 1/4 of an inch around 30 seconds after the pour.  Sweet and powerful semi-molasses aroma.  Malty, maple sugar taste, nice and coating in a full-bodied way.  Notes of alcohol and raisins.  A little orange rind flavor, maybe from the malts or maybe from the subtle English hops.  Nice and flavorful, represents the style well but close to a Doppelbock in stickiness.  A little heavy for high drinkability."
"McEwan’s Scotch Ale:  nice looking, deep garnet color, with little head.  Nice understated aroma, black cherry?  First taste, whoa, who put the booze in my beer?  Shockingly sweet, with overwhelming malt and alcohol.  Highly carbonated. If this what Scotch Ale is supposed to taste like, I’ll have to pass."
"The tan head is persistant enough to leave a lace.  Dark garnet in hue w/ a bit of chill haze.  Lots of sweet toffee and sugary prune notes in the aroma.  Slight roasted grain sharpness is there as well.  The hop nose is secondary, but a hint of floral Kent Goldings can be perceived.  Medium bodied, and the low carbonation provides a very smooth mouthfeel.  Roasted barley bitterness hits the palette initially, and a strong sugary sweetness follows.  Hop bitterness is far too low to offset the residual sweetness.  Finishes w/ no surprises-- roasty, sweet and almost syrupy.  It's a pretty good Scotch Ale, but the sweetness borderlines on being cloying, and malt complexity was a bit lacking.  A good brew if you're in the mood for something sweet. This would make a great (albeit expensive) vanilla ice cream float!"
"Thin, not even that malty, sweet, ever so slightly peaty and smokey, but hardly even. Really average, scotch ale has never been a favourite of mine, and this is among the worst examples i've had, distgustingly industrial and sweet, what other raters see in this beer, is beyond me, very nasty stuff. Scottish ghetto swill."
"First off I love Scottish ales and was really excited to taste McEwans. Unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed with the over all tasting. First off the color is incredible, a deep mahogony color with a decent head. Taste wise, the high alcohol 8% certainly is predominent and not some of the other flavors. This brew is definitely a sipping beer not one to pound down with your friends."
"The only other scotch ale I have had was Sam Adam's, and they are quite different.  Sam's was definitely less sweet and had a smoky peat character that McEwan's did not"
