"O: An easy to drink Wee Heavy."
""
""
"At 9.75% avb this beer is all bang for the buck. Not a strong taste for the amount of alcohol which I really enjoy. Thirst quenching, impeccable!"
""
"Overall: A very good take on a Scotch Ale. Good toasty and smokey malt flavors with some nice subtle fruit tones."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, almost opaque, ruby-brown coloring with a halo of off-white head. Aromas of caramel sweetness, molasses, chocolate, earthy notes, a subtle booze character, sweet cream, and some vanilla. Smells big and rich! Flavors are sugary sweet and heavily roasted forward, with tangy caramel and sweet cream blending together over a boozy undertone. Highlights of chocolate and molasses dart in and out. There are also some notes of earth and floral highlights there to layer this beer a bit more. Roasted notes throughout, and the increased ABV is hidden very well in this beer. Full and robust in mouth, it remains smooth through to the finish. The aftertaste is rich and sweet, with all of the caramel, nut, and cream notes lingering on subtly. Very tasty beer."
""
""
""
"Great beer, strong without a very bitter taste"
""
""
""
"Bronze in color with about a finger of head. Aroma is dominated by malty sweetness.  Am picking up a bit of red wine and earthy notes.  Taste is malt, fruit, and peat with very subtle alcohol.  Finish is residual sweetness. Mouthful is medium with a nice amount of carbonation and cream. Overall an excellent scotch ale which was very enjoyable and deserving of procuring more."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this a supremely flavorful and aggressive scotch ale.  Its fruitiness reminds me of Skullsplitter, but more balanced and bolder.  Scotty Karate is a testament to what a nuanced and complex style this can be when properly executed."
"A nice malty scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin, evanescent head. Deep ruby hue. Aroma of dark dried fruit. Taste is an exemplar of the style, with a sweet fruitiness almost matched by darker malty elements. Creamy feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into nonic. Brown liquid with a two-finger tan head that settles to a collar. Aroma is bread, oak, malt, peat, and earth. Taste is sweet malts then leafy hop bitterness. Medium body, chewy texture, light side of medium carbonation, woody leafy drying finish."
""
""
""
""
"Quite possibly the best beer I've had from Dark Horse. An exquisite wee heavy. Really like the peaty notes complementing strong caramel."
""
""
"O - certainly a good beer, a good go-to for a higher alcohol scotch ale that's available pretty much everywhere year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My first beer from this brewery, which seems well regarded...seems well made, but it's a lot more sweet than I tend to like.  Maybe I'll give it a try from a bottle another time, to see how it compares."
"O - This is a good scotch ale. Can't say I will rush out and buy more I'll jump on it if I see it on tap. My first beer from Dark Horse and I'm looking for more!"
""
""
""
"Overall, a good, solid Scotch Ale."
""
""
""
"Best beer these guys make, and its not even close"
""
"It was a very good beer, for the style, but the smokey flavor was way too strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this one is up there in my favorites for this style."
""
"Enjoyable for sure, but lacks the wow factor.  I enjoyed it with a boar burger on a COLD January day."
""
"O: Great beer - took the whole four pack to appreciate it's depth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The scotch flavoring is not one of my favors"
""
"One of the first scotch ales I ever had. Will be purchasing this again soon!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very enjoyable offering for the style. The fruitiness really sticks out the most and adds an undeniable sweetness to the beer. Has a wonderful classic smoky malt base, with nice toasted bread notes and caramel sweetness. Alcohol fairly well hidden, not very pungnant. Nice enjoyable sipper."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation, a thin watery feel across the tongue, and a slightly bitter grainy finish that is sweet but not cloyingly sweet. Overall this was a very goof Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy that hid the 9.75% ABV masterfully. I would definitely have this again and recommend trying it."
"Simply complex... Dried fruits, breads, malts, completely hidden ABV, caramel sweetness. Such a clean finish. This is what I imagine a great wee heavy tastes in Scotland when fresh from a brewery... Hopefully because the ones I've had on this side of the pond aren't this good."
""
"Basic scotch ale decent flavor for the price point a solid pick up but no where near backwoods or wulver"
""
""
""
"Not going to get into detail, but this is by far the smoothest scotch ale I've ever had, and one of the best apart from Backwoods Bastard, but that's a completely different animal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  I don't really get anything out of this beer.  That being said, I did let it warm up for an hour after I opened it.  But I did it in the bottle with a wine stopper, however, I did have to pour the beer back into the bottle."
""
"A big scotch ale that's a bit linear, i guess almost boring for some, but it was tasty enough for me. Still, not a direct contender with the traditional heavies."
""
""
""
"O- Props to Dark Horse.  I don't normally like this style when it's done traditionally but this one is made as such and I really like it."
""
"hides the EtOH quite well, but no dominant flavor profile,  that is, nothing sticks out as far as an amazing flavor.  Perhaps a bit sweet but certainly not syrupy.  overall, good, but not great."
""
"Pours a clouded deep ruddy brown. There is a thin tan head that dissipates almost immediately. A slight hint of lacing. The aroma is lighter, with some deep roasted malt tones and caramel. The taste really takes the malt and runs with it. There is a great big malt hit, followed by some smoked notes and a little bit of fruit. The body has a nice thickness and a little carbonation."

"Scotty Karate!!! Jugs!!!"
""
""
""
"O - Very nice scotch ale and another strong beer from Dark Horse. Very smooth and drinkable especially at 9.75% ABV."
""
"A boozy malt-bomb."
""
"O - I'm not a huge fan of scotch ales in general. Others have said this is a relatively low flavor scotch ale. So it appeals to me. Glad to have tried."
"O- Note really impressed for a scotch ale, sorry DH"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an odd one, I homebrew so I'm used to tasting wort before fermentation, and this is very reminiscent. Almost as though they blended this beer with raw wort, odd."

"O great scotch ale can't believe this is almost 10%. Dirty bastard is still my fave but this is up there"
""

"the profile.  Nice to sip, but not overly heavy for the ABV.  Goes down smoothly.  Would drink again..."
""
""
""
"I let this beer age for 6 months and after the long wait I finally had it. Worth the wait. So much better aged. It's really smooth and just tastes fantastic. Beautiful color and just fantastic finish. Buy a pack and let it age for 6-8 months."

"O: I am a little disappointed. I wanted so much from this guy. But the nose was lacking and the taste hits with a lot of booze. It just feels unbalanced. I searched for a born on date - in hopes of bailing them out (like I got an old one) but I can't find it. As it warms there is additional sweetness which yanks some of the scores up out of the basement."
""
""
"This wonderful scotch ale pours a deep mahogany color with a small off white head that leaves generous lacing and thick legs. The nose is a rich bouquet of caramel malts, woodsy notes, smoke, and a hint of booze. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy; in the best opulently rich way. The flavor follows the nose with lots of sweet toffee malt, earthy peat, and gently warming alcohol. I'm a big fan of both Dark Horse and Scotch ales and this is one of my favorites. If they made a bba version, I'd be in heaven."

"D: This was a nice beer with decent scent and fitting taste. The body was great, and the alcohol was well hidden. It had a smooth finish too, so it was easy to drink. Probably not for aging, and nothing unique or memorable fresh. But not bad either."
"O: hides the ABV well, and is (perhaps dangerously) drinkable. Perhaps also that's why I rated it lower, it doesn't seem to be indicative of what I think of the style (that I know less about than some)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable for sure. Not as flavorful or full bodied as I like in a scotch ale but it did the job on this cold, rainy, dreary Ohio day."

"Full flavor scotch ale, with smooth waves of caramel, maple and again toffee. Simply delicious malty goodness. Full of flavor, but not overly sweet. Nicely done. Glad to get to try this one on draft"
"Poured from a bottle with a brown color and a very light white head. Has a scotch aroma. Taste is also strongly scotch and sweet. Has a nice full body flavor and goes down smooth. I enjoy scotch ales and this is a very enjoyable one. I also have to give kudos for such a cool and catchy name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied, and sticky, with good levels of carbonation. This beer is very well made, and wonderfully deep. Very enjoyable to drink, and keeps you coming back for more. Even at nearly 10%, the alcohol is hidden, and it's very drinkable."

"O-very flavorful scotch ale, nice sipping"
"Decent scotch ale from Dark Horse. A fuller body would bump the score up significantly."

"O: Just OK. This is an example of the unevenness of this style of beer. This one is OK but I would not purchase again. Give me a Backwoods Bastard and I'll knock you on your ass to beat you to the bar!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I like the fact that the alcohol doesn't try to rape you when you sip this. As I am drinking this with a cold, I would like to re-evaluate this once my cold is gone. But I am super-impressed with it even with my shnozz on the fritz :)"
""
""

""
""
"O - 4.0 - It's a good beer. Not the best scotch ale or wee heavy out there, but it's good. A good Michigan beer."
""
"this is a fireside beer, one to curl up with on a cold night in front of a blazing hot fire and sip on. the nose here is great, smoky even for a scotch ale, with some caramel malt and brown sugar sweetness, as well as a pronounced earthy richness. its alcohol strength is only hinted at in the smell. candied malt and bonfire smoke greet my palate warmly. woody malt flavor to this beer is central, the smoke and sweet are secondary. layers of grain come and go, with caramel and toffee sweetness being the residuals and an almost lactose milk stout type of sugar sticking around too, but these sweets are tempered by earthy smoke, a robustly flavored and pretty well balanced brew. fuller bodied and only boozy when it warms up, a good beer for sharing and a fun winter seasonal from dark horse."
""
"The body is full, moderately carbonated, lightly crisp, and delightfully creamy all with just a hint of dryness cutting the sweetness on the palate to make an exceptionally well-rounded mouthfeel. It's also one of the cleanest out there, no astringency or grainy character to speak of."

"O-Maybe this was bottled in the beginning of the year. But the beer lacked the strong malty notes I expect from the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is almost absent of carbonation with a smooth, clean touch. It has an almost water like smoothness and at nearly 10 pct ABV, there's not a hint of alcohol."
"NOTE: Live review @ The Ram's Head in West Chester, Penna. on February 20th, 2012 readjusted after October 18th, 2013 when draft at Hawthorne's Beer Cafe in Phila., Penna. was ordered, and re-reviewed on November 12th, 2013 with a 2013 bottle."
""
""
"O - Definitely one of my favorite scotch ales. Big smooth drink. Will definitely be partaking a few of these over the next couple of cold winter months."
""
""
"Overall: Yes, please. Provided I remember to let it warm up a little more next time!"
"O - not my first Dark Horse brew, but a very good one regardless. Well deserving of the first review from this Brewery. I'm actually more stoked I can get Dark Horse stuff in Ohio. One of those good moments discovering Dark Horse. Scotty Karate is a very good Scotch style ale. It has all the right juice to become someone's go to big beer. Very enjoyable and very well crafted. Scotty Karate is a must try and one to go back to every Autumn."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very delicious, wonderful smelling brew. Mouthfeel seems off to me, would expect more lingering sweetness, but the strength could be working against the brew in this regard."

"Now that's a Scotch Ale! The 9.75% abv is hardly noticeable. Good stuff!"
""
"On a positive note...I like where Dark Horse Brewing is going, a big version of a hearty beer style. I don't think they quite have it with this batch but it won't deter me from trying any of there other offerings. I this case it seems the yeast they are using wasn't able to tolerate the amount of malt that was used."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very solid example of a scotch ale, but ultimately a bit rough right now. I feel like this would benefit from some age."
"O: Decent scotch ale. Toffee heavy, if that is your thing. I'm not a huge fan so I couldn't give it big points. Still one of the better ones out there if I'm honest. On the sweet, caramelly side as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is medium bodied, likely due to the heavy carbonation keeping it moving. It seems like it wants to leave a residue but doesn't quite get it in one go. It takes several sips to build this up on the back of the tongue."
""
""
"O: Glad I grabbed it. Need to keep trying Dark Horse. May grab another to age."
""
""
"Poured a brownish body with one finger head and some lace patches on top of an aroma of mostly bready and sweet dark malts, little bit of java, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel possibly, some woodiness. Taste/mouthfeel is more of the same as fuller bodied and smooth thanks to some bready oakiness and there is a good of sweetness thanks to caramel, chocolate, toffee, and a little bit of dryness from bready malts and booze added into the finish as well as some crisp hoppiness. A very enjoyable and hearty sipper."

"Overall: This beer is another great entry from Dark Horse. The bourbon barrel-aged flavor was a bit of a surprise, but since I like that style variant, it was a good surprise. I'll look forward to having Scotty again and will definitely want to have one when I drive over to the brewery in Marshall, Michigan."

"Overall: Very good brew but still not at the level of my favorite scotch ale. It definitely is stronger but stronger doesn't always mean better. Flavor is everything and a little tweaking couldn't hurt. Salud!"

"I had the privilege of tasting this next to innis & Gunn as well as founders dirty bastard. My friend prefered this one over the 3. Mainly for the reasons I liked it over the founders one which was more mouth to it and a little more bite. To me the founders was a little sweeter which i liked. I prefer innis and gunn over all of them but thats me... this is probably the 5th or 6th wee heavy I tried and it's easily number 2... I wouldn't skip over this one if you like the style..."
"I have no idea how the label relates to the idea of a Scotch Ale, but I totally dig the wigged-out one-man band that it depicts. Perhaps that is how they anticipate one will feel after a bottle of this beer. We shall see. Holy hot, Batman! I got a good whiff of booze in pouring this one into my glass. I got a brief appearance of (maybe) a finger of deep-tan head that quickly fell to swirling wisps. Color was a slightly hazy cola-brown. Nose smelled of dried, dark fruit(s), leather, lemon zest and al-kee-haul. Whee! Mouthfeel was medium with an initial alcohol heat followed by notes of toffee, leather, dried fruit, and brown sugar. Finish was semi-dry with the alcohol heat accounting for this in the face of all of the sugary flavors involved. This really packed a wallop, even for me. I would recommend that you at least try it once and if you are a fan of the style (which I am not), you will be head over heels for it."
"O: a rugged take on the wee heavy, not as syrupy as some, with more bite than others."

"Overall: A great smelling beer that is very much let down by the taste and mouthfeel. The taste is not actually bad, it's just that there isn't too much there. If the alcohol % was lower, maybe that would be okay, but combined with the alcohol warming, not to mention alcohol taste, there just isn't enough flavor there for me. Overall, a decent beer that isn't terrible by any means, but I won't be purchasing it again."
""
"Pours dark ruby with a small cream colored head. Aroma of malt and some spice, caramel, and dark fruits. Low carbonation and slick mouthfeel, on the heavy side. Burnt toffee flavor, some scotch, oats, hint of spice. Bitterness and some chocolate. Overall a bit bland on my tastebuds but not bad."
""
"O - A unique brew that is quite different from what I have experienced in the style. Almost tastes as if they mixed a thick caramel syrup with a low ABV scotch ale... That said, it is certainly a tasty experience."
"O: The complex flavors in this beer make it a nice one to sip but it is rather easy to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
""
""
""
"O- very nice scotch ale. Like how the toffee and smoke meld."
""
""
""

"Fantastic beer. This is an underrated beer for its style. Big flavor in a relatively small price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great example of the style."
""
"O: It's pretty good, yeah, but it's missing something - such as the vague stout-like qualities of Old Chub or the drinkable complexity of Dirty Bastard. As such, it's hard to recommend over those two."
"O - Not my favorite take on the style. I will admit that it probably loses points because I don't particularly like Scoth Ales. Strong earthy peat notes along with caramel and molasses give this beer a rich flavor. It comes a bit unglued on the finish, but some may enjoy that sweet and smoky combination. Not bad, but not one I will seek out."
""
"Overall, very nice scotch ale. Definitely drinkable and to be fair scotch ales aren't high on my list of favorites so this may rate even higher for those that truly enjoy this class of beer."
"Overall: A good scotch ale. You can't even notice the booze that much."
""

"A strong pour gets you enough agitation to cover the surface, deep brown, fades swiftly to a gathering around the rims, close to zero lacing. The liquid is a murky orange rust to reddish brown mud, lots of particulate floating around, barely lightens to yellow at the outer reaches. The nose evokes a bakery full of German chocolate cake, caramel covered pastries and butterscotch, nice for the amplitude of the scents without heavy clinging in the nostrils, spreads further into hazelnut coffee, cola and some poached apricot fruit, not that alcoholic, minimal hops presence. Medium to full-bodied, slight fizz during the mouth entry but the carbonation overall is lacking. Smokier here with tar, sauna stone and scorched camp fire earth notes, delays the entrance of the chocolate, toffee, butterscotch and honey, more yeast and bread dough. Past the mid-palate dries out, this before the apricot, peach, golden raisin and orange citrus really take hold. As in the nose hides its ABV well. Could use something to stiffen it and create more energy in lieu of carbonation. Otherwise, it comes across as a traditional rendition of the style."

""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bready, some molasses.Taste is malts, bready, some alcohol, a bit sweet, some dark fruits. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a different and solid beer, worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Tasty scotch ale. Dangerously drinkable. It's different enough from othe scotch ales that I will definitely seek it out again!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid beer overall and for the price not a bad example of a scotch ale. I wouldn't put it above the dirty bastard as far as MI scotch ales are considered."
""
""
""
"I'm not typically a scotch ale guy but I can dig this one. I'd love to see it spend some time in a barrel of some kind. Thanks Joel!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is medium to slightly full. Moderate carbonation. Good alcohol warmth. At almsot 10% this is very well balanced and well made brew."
"This is a decent, very malty beer. I thought the malts were complex and had layers of flavor. Unfortunately, the crispness of the carbonation messed with my palate making the flavors seem fleeting. If you enjoy this style this is probably a beer that is worth checking out."
"Oh boy, an outstanding scotch ale; save it for a closer"
"This is a good brew. Tasted more smokey flavor this time around. This was solid once again - easy to drink for the ABV."
""
"Overall, this is good Scotch Ale, featuring a wide variety of nicely nuanced flavors. The sugars and breads are very nice in here, though the woody notes do take over a bit too much in the end and somewhat spoil the aftertaste. Still, it’s a decent addition to the style, and worth trying."
""
""
"O-I really like this beer and HIGHLY recommend this beer (especially to malty beer lovers) SO glad I got to try this, thanks to my friend in Minnasota! You are awesome Sarah-Jane!"
"Very low carbonation. Needs lots more."
"O - Overall, Probably the best Scotch Ale I have had to date. The flavors open up and meld together perfectly. Forget Loch Down, Forget Dirty Bastard, Forget Skull Splitter, this is as fucking wonderful Scotch ale, far beyond the others I have mentioned."
""
""
"An intimidating reddish brown with a nice head that leaves almost no lacing. Smells like loads of sweet caramel, dry fruit, booze. Taste is similar - bittersweet, very rich caramel, dry and dark fruit, bready malts, spices, very candy esque - mmm! Medium & rich mouthfeel, boozy butter. I love it, this beer is a sleeper pick of mine. Dark Horse doesn't disappoint. They should age this stuff in wine or bourbon barrels."

"A well-done and highly bitter strong Scotch Ale with good alcohol content and warmth and a great balance and sweet dry finish. I really enjoy this beer and would call it one of my favorite Scotch Ales on the planet. Also in contention are Old Chub and Dirty Bastard. Scotty has a bit more balls than the others."
""
""
""
"For a 9.75 percent beer, it is pretty creamy and smooth will still packing a punch. The alcohol is evident from the smell and finish of the tasting, but it is a delicious Scotch ale and has become a regular purchase for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- To me this drinks a lot like a nut brown with some smoke and an alcohol finish. Not bad, just not a super Scotch Ale in my opinion."
"Pours a rich, deep brown topped by a fluffy, two finger light beige head. Little to no lacing. Huge caramel malt, fresh moist bran muffins, some grain, and just a whiff of clean alcohol on the nose. An absolute malt bomb. Bread crust, freshly baked lightly sweet dark bread, hints of caramel and toffee. Moderate carbonation fights through the creamy, full body and shows up here and there; a bit of syrupy accents on the edges. Heavy, but creamy and ridiculously smooth. This is just a fantastic brew and one of my favorite Scotch Ales. You'd be hard-pressed to find one that tops it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: For the Scotch Ale enthusiasts it's a must try, the highly carbonated mouthfeel brings out the the rich malt and molasses, it's a meaty Ale that doesn't hide the alcohol but embraces it, so be ready for a head-thumper."
"Pours a burnt copper hue with a creamy two finger head and sporadic lacing here and there,the smell is burnt caramel,toffee,nutcake,booze,dried fruit and molasses,the mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of toffee,fruitcake,burnt caramel,candi sugar,butterscotch and finished with a boozy dryness and overall its a nice scotch ale and would buy again cheers."
"Big, full-bodied, and complex, yet without any harshness whatsoever. One would not expect this beer to be as strong as it is. Incredibly smooth, and quite easy to drink. Definitely a solid beer for cold winter nights. I'm really digging it!"
""
""
"Pours medium brown with a hint of amber color. Slight off white head - healthy at pour with minimal lacing. Finer carbonation that excites easily with a swirl. Smell is caramel scented and sweet. Flavor is also sweet but detect caramel, chocolate, and maybe some plum or other similar fruit. It masks its high ABV well - not noticeable. Could be compared to a barley wine but without the alcohol presence. Really enjoyable brew."

"A dark black brown, mahogany color with a full tan frothy head and good lacing. The aroma offers a somewhat sherry prune malt. Solid and barley wine-like. The flavor follows suit with a mellow prune malt and vague chocolate caramel. There's a tart herbal-grass hop that blends smoothly with the dark fruit. This is near full bodied with a satiny feel and very quiet carbonation. Very tasty stuff and fairly drinkable, though not a session brew needless to say."

"Solid dark fruit and chocolate flavors with some complimenting sherry and rum highlights. A good example of a scotch ale."
"I've seen this beer on the shelves before, but don't know why i never though to buy one. It's too bad, cuz it really is a decent beer I would definitely buy. I'm curious how this beer would age in the cellar for a year or so. I'm thinking rather well and will try."
"Overall, disappointing. Especially for the price. I like many of their other beers, but this one doesn't make the cut."
""
""
""
"O- This beer drinks really easy for a beer of almost 10% abv. However it does lack in the mouth, and the taste does not impress like an excellent scotch ale should. It reminds me of an old ale by the smell and taste so it does not follow the style in my eyes. A disappointment for sure in my opinion. Better luck next time, cheers!"

"My first and maybe last of the style. This one pours a dark, rust brown. Smells sweetish and of caramel and alcohol and malt. Tastes sweet and malt and malt and malt. It 'punches' weirdly I think, and is not bitter in the least. I should have known better. Mouthfeel is finely carbonated and not too much on the syrup side. Not my style, I guess."
""

"O: A great example of a Scotch ale. Lots of depth and good flavors. This is the perfect ale to drink as Fall starts to roll in. It's hard to find anything to fault in this ale. It's a beer that stays true to the style, which is nice to see in this age where a lot of beers try to constantly push the envelope."
""
""
"I don't really care for this one too much."
"O - Like I said, this is the best Scotch Ale I have ever tried. If you are a fan of malty and complex sippers, you won't be disappointed by this."
""

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark brown that was slightly hazy. Very thin trace of an off white head clung to the sides. Aroma was slightly sweet, kinda of like a caramel candy. A small hint of alcohol was hidden underneath the sweet. Kind of a sugary roasted date taste as well. Felt good in the mouth. Coated very well with just a touch of carbonation. Overall a very pleasant well balanced beer. The ABV hit a little fast, but wasn't noticeable in the beer."
"Dirty, almost muddy, brown, with a beige head. Light film and a collar of retention. Nose holds dark fruits, sweet caramels, toffee and some marshmallow. Taste has dark bready notes, a bit earthy, sweet malt with a bit of chocolate and some fruitiness again. Quite big in terms of body/viscosity, bit there's no alcohol to be found (at all) which is magnificent for a beer of this size. Low carbonation. A really good scotch ale/wee heavy."

"This Beer is one of the best scotch ales I have had hands down. It has a ton of flavor, lots of caramel flavors, tons of roasted malts and a subtle but nice dark fruit quality. It has a full feel and body but drinks surprisingly easy. It goes down smooth and leaves you with a nice dark fruit and roasty dry mouth feel. A fantastic scotch ale that I wish I could get more readily."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 8/6/2011. Pours very cloudy dark reddish brown color with a good 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, apple, toasted biscuit, peat, leather, raisin, toffee, light chocolate, and spices. Very nice and complex aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, smoke, toasted biscuit, toffee, apple, raisin, wood, light chocolate, earth, and spices. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, smoke, molasses, and wood on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance with a good amount of robustness; and absolutely no cloying sweetness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, lush, and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is insanely well hidden for being almost 10%, with only a small warming well after the finish. Extremely smooth to sip on for such a big beer; drinks much smoother than some lower gravity beers. Overall this is a fantastic scotch ale! Great balance of flavors with good complexity; and extremely smooth."
"O- I really like this. I'm not too familiar with Scotch Ales, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another one of these and alse delve into some other offerings in this style."

"This is my favorite scotch ales. Considering Too Cream Stout is one of my favorite stouts, it looks like I need to try more Dark Horse beers."
"A tasty night cap. I served it at cellar temperature, but found that it good more complex and interesting as it approached room temperature."
""
"Taste is spicy and sweet at front, with traces of peat, dates, figs, and candied berries entering later. Quite complex and palate-pleasing, and the alcohol is subdued. Additionally, the warmer this one gets, the smoother it is. Enjoyable."

"Nose is rich malty caramel sweetness, dark fruit, bread. Hints of smoke in the flavor, light but balancing. Rich without being syrupy, sweet in the middle with a nice dry finish. On top of malty, bready goodness - Cherry, dark fruits, slight leather and tobacco notes. Scary drinkable for ABV. Real nice."

"Overall: A big tasty scotch ale. Good character, hides the strength well enough, and I can dig it."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours a deep coppery brown body with a small, short-lived white head. Aroma is deep malty tones with burnt caramel, molasses and hints of booze. Taste is more caramel, dark toffee, roasty malt tones and hints of walnut. Smooth mouthfeel, well hidden alcohol. Pretty nice. Maybe lacking a bit in complexity but overall a decent scotch ale from Dark Horse."
""
"D/O: This American-brewed wee heavy has the feel of a beer that wants very badly to be taken seriously. It tries hard, and occasionally delivers, but is simultaneously constrained by some typical strong-ale problems. The smell is excellent and enticing, providing a bookend that is complemented by the far finish of pungent and dry umami. Along the way acidity plays too large a role and flavors take too long of a break in the third quarter. In the final tally it is worth drinking for the volatile dried mushroom aftertaste alone."

"Great example of the style."

"I like it. It's cloudy and interesting looking. There is a malty aroma, overpowering the hops (appropriately for the style). The aftertaste is very boozy. It is going very nicely with an excessively spicy gumbo - they are going toe to toe. I would buy this again when I wanted a strong scotch ale."

"First off I have to say that Backwoods Bastard is my favorite beer of this style that I have been able to try. That being said, I have been waiting to try this for a while. Poured into a Boulevard tulip. Color is a reddish brown with a 1/4 inch head that stayed throughout. Smell was boozy, with the typical bourbon nose of this type. Taste was not overly hot with great hints of caramel, and oak. The finish lingered although not as long as BB. Mouthfeel was on the thinker side, which is what I want from Scotch Ale. Overall this is very nice, balanced beer and a great example of the style. Its very clean and does not have the twinge that you get from BB at the end. A pretty good substitute for Backwoods Bastard, which is not easy to achieve but is lacking in the overall mix of flavors that Founders provides. I will definitely be looking for this again!!!! Great Beer Dark Horse!!!"
"Wonder a wonderful beer. I gotta be careful or the wife is going to drink it all."
"O-Flavor notes not robust enough and I am seeking the Barrel Version of this brew as it could make it perfect. As with my other 2011 brews, will cellar and check back at 5 and 10 years."

"Overall - I really enjoy this scotch ale. Nice flavors, and great balance, even a little complexity. No punches here at all, just a smooth, creamy, flavorful scotch ale. A great way to end a cool evening. I recommend this one."

"This is a great sweet-ish sipper with a nice roasty balance!"
""
""

"O: Excellent. This could easily be the base for DFH's WWS before all of the supplemental sugar feedings."

" The flavor has a good amount of malt depth with slight toasted grain up front and subtle caramel w/ mild woody hop accents and light toasted toffee essence that carries a hint of earthy elements with thte mild grass/pine and slight alcohol in the taste and dried fruit from the yeast. This ale is overall pretty high in drinkability with fairly easy to drink for the heft of alcohol it packs, the scottish ale is not mild in flavor, yet still is able to hide some of the brawn. I went back for several tastes from this growler."
"O: this is a great value from Dark Horse, great flavor and nice balance. Great representation of the style."
""
""
"O- Wonderful. If not for the lack of body. The way this tastes coupled with the aroma leads me to anticipate a thick, whiskey-like body. All that aside, this is still a great beer."

"Overall, not bad but there are better out there."

" deep malty backbone was starting to push through. Lots of sweet notes taking over on this one, with hints of caramel, vanilla and nice earthy grains starting to come to the front. Definitely, some wood somewhere in its history as the aroma of oak was huge on this one. Lots of caramel and vanilla starting to take shape here, really lightning it up and make it that much sweeter. Next up in the lineup was a full on assault of the oak and wood flavors that were coming through earlier. Strong hints of oak and bourbon dominating it here, really giving it a deep flavor and pronounced presence. ever so slightly dry hop finish. Really quite complex and very nice indeed."

"I was pleasently surprised with this one. A very good beer."
"Pours a murky brown, toffee color that is hazy to the point of opaque. About two centimeters of fluffy, bubbly, cream-colored head develops and lingers briefly. Minimal lacing is left on the glass as scattered patches of bubbles. The nose is a bit subdued, but scotch, a bit of grain, some lighter (English?) malt, and earthen notes are present. The aroma is pleasant, just hard to detect. It tastes of earthen grass, faint malt, peaty scotch, some odd, citrusy fruits, and a rush of smoky grain at the end. Alcohol is completely hidden. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected, but not in a bad way. It is crisp on the tongue and finishes clean, adding to the drinkability greatly. Overall, a highly drinkable scotch ale that I could happily return to."
"Just like any good scotch ale this beer starts and finishes with an exceptional carmerlized carmelly taste with slight smoke and roast. At 9.75% it hides it's alcohol very very well. Always looking forward to this one come fall in hopes of drinking these at dark horse while watching scotty perform too."
"The flavors come across so smooth, rich, and creamy and integrated. I swear the last 2 bottles of this i drank were not this integrated or smooth, this one is prime. Once again Smoked malts, caramel malts, peaty earthy notes, reminds me of moss covered rocks, the dark fruits are lesser here then the earthy notes but show s glimpse, and the smokey notes really add a deep complexity here compared to other in the genre."
"Overall, one of the best non barrel-aged scotch ales I have had. Very nice flavors and texture."
"Overall this is probably my favorite of the style so far. Great offering from Dark Horse that I will definitely purchase again. I will, however, be wary of the 9.75."
"One of my favorite beers."
"Overall: The flavor has a richness to it that is refreshing a satisfying. Not as complex or resonant as most quads and this is not a quad, but it has many aspects that remind of that style which is a favorite of mine."
"overall - a great week heavy. admittedly, i'm a huge wee heavy fan, but this one is right up there."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, sticky and chewy on the tongue. A pretty solid wee heavy, but not quite one of my favorites."
"O- Next to Backwoods Bastard and Shaggin' in the Wood (which is almost doesn't count as a scotch ale due to the inclusion of stout characteristics), this is one of my new top 3 scotch ales. Not as sweet and powerful as something like Skull Splitter, Scotty Karate errs on the side of session ale (though at 9.75%, it ought to be a short session) in it's ability to hide it's alcohol and leave the palate unburdened by thickness or sugar."
"O - Pretty good stuff; not something I'm going to seek out a ton of, but I would buy again."
"This seems more complex as you sip. A very good example that shows restraint with sugar and smoke, but then goes wild with the alcohol. A great sipping beer."
"O - A very good scotch ale. I'm kind of dissapointed that the flavors of the beer are not more noticable, but stil overall this is a great beer."
"Overall: Nice and complex. I liked the dark fruit and vanilla notes. Would have again."
"Poured into a pint grass from the bottle, I was immediately impressed by the aroma. The sweet maltiness coupled with a degree of fruitiness in the aroma brought to mind children's breakfast cereals. The color was a murky brown with a touch of reddish hue. The taste was a robust maltiness with a sweet banana candy flavor. This is not a scotch ale that one forgets a few minutes after it fits your tongue. Very smooth going down and easy to drink, Scotty Karate ends with a mildly sweet yet tart aftertaste. As a fan of the style, this may be the best Scotch Ale I have had."
"Received in trade from GPHarris thanks for the opportunity. Pours a chunky cloudy dark brown color with a thinnish khaki head that quickly dissipates to a ring on top. Smell is sweet, malty, fruity, ethanol-y. Wow that's not what I expected on the nose, quite complex and different. Caramel, toffee, juicy dark fruit, toffee, hints of smoke and chocolate. Taste is sweet up front with a hint of chocolate, juicy fruits mixed with caramel midway through, long lingering sweet fruit and alcohol heat in a fairly dry finish. Body is a bit lighter than medium, light level of carbonation with a sweet sugary watery mouthfeel. This smells fantastic, looks horrible and tastes pretty good. I bit more body and clarity would send this one out the stratosphere for me."
"Pours a murky brown, swampy (<- A new word for murky) and hazy brown appearance with a light head...nice reddish hue to it...aroma is of dark fruits, spice, heavy sugars, creamy, and caramel. Flavor was sweet, dark fruit, raisin, and alcohol on the finish. Average palate; another gem from this brewery. I love Dark Horse."
"Taste is ok but i miss the carbonation. Reasonable beer."
"Ordered this beer on tap a while ago at the Tap & Table when it was still open. This beer has a very nice looking deep brown color to it with a creamy tan head on top. The lacing wasn't too sticky but left a few lines on the glass. The smell of the beer was sweet and malty, like it should smell for this style. The taste of the beer has a really nice sweetness throughout, it's a very malty brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy feeling with some light carbonation. Overall I would enjoy having this one again one day."
"Very interesting and enjoyable brew but doesn't bother at all to hide its strength. Can feel a bit oppressive as a result, but in spite of that I like it a lot and would have it again."
"Very enjoyable scotch ale. A big peat/earthy profile which I liked alot. Definitely digging Dark Horse so far."
"O- This a good beer, and one I'm glad to have gotten the opportunity to try. That being said, there are others of the style that I prefer."
"This brew is smooth and very nice on the palate, but I just wish it had a bit more kick. I'm pretty sure that I'm drinking the 3/4 year old version right now, so I'll hopefully catch it this fall and try it fresh. Regardless, another solid beer from Dark Horse."
"D/O- A good scotch ale but not outstanding. In the upper tier as far as ABV for the style. A nice sipper during an evening of any season. Thanks for the bottle MammothBrew!"
"Good stuff. I've only been able to find Dark Horse's IPAs and Sapient on tap, but would love to park next a keg of this one."
"O: Overall, a decent beer. Nothing really makes it stand out from the pack, but it's not bad by any means."
"Overall: An extremely tasty scotch ale. Definitely has the exact flavor that one would expect from a scotch ale: carmelly sweetness, balanced by hop bitterness. This is a very rich, full-bodied style, and I don't think I could drink several of even the best examples of the style in one sitting. That said, it's a delicious, satisfying style to be sure, and I look forward to enjoying the Scotty Karate rendition many times in the future!"
"Wonderful beer. Hidden booze, flavor complexity, easy to drink. Loved this. Another winner from what is becoming a real favorite brewery."
"SkÅL!"
"Deep amber body with a thin creamy head. Loads of sweet caramel in the nose, some vanilla, and a bit of chocolate as well. The flavor is not as cloying as most Scotch ales, so that’s a good thing. Caramel and chocolate initially with some cinnamon, a bit of oak, and a short and rather sweet finish."
"In a word, this Scotch Ale is delicious. One of the better versions of the style that I've had to date. Absolutely one that will be making a return to my fridge."
"Overall this was enjoyable enough for a style that I’m often indifferent about. Full of flavor. Mouthefeel is just ok, but that’s often the case for me with this style. Still recommended, and I would drink it again."
"Big thanks goes out to a74gent for this as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a chocolatey brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and slight peat. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. It had a definite peat presence going on here, but was not overly invasive to the palate. I'm not a big peat fan so this was a nice compromise for me. The flavor and aroma were very nicely balanced. If both would have been a little more complex this could have been a great brew. Definitely worth trying or ticking either way."
"o - Overall a very thick scotch ale, but nicely balanced and pleasant tasting."
"Really smooth, but so much so that it didn't really resemble a Scotch ale at all. Still good though. Brown body with a tan head, and slightly carbonated. Malty aroma and taste, and a bit of dark fruits, and not much alcohol bite. Medium mouthfeel, and moderate drinkability."
"Pours a three-finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Cloudy mahogany color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is bourbon and caramel, flavor is same with light sweet bourbon and caramel, expecting but no dark fruit. $2.95 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Overall - another great beer from Dark Horse."
"Thanks to Randalld for the opportunity."
"O: Drinkability isn't the greatest, one is enough. It is pretty high in abv, but it doesn't seem quite that high, though it still a big bruiser of a scotch ale with in your face flavors. An imperial scotch ale..."
" Purchased at Stoney's, 4 pack $8.99"
"Overall I like it. Nice complexities and smoothness."
"Overall (Drinkability): Not a bad drinking Scotch Ale, pretty much what I expected. Though not a style I'm a huge fan of, it's a tasty brew and I wouldn't turn it down if offered one."
"O: Wow. What a special brew. I really think I am developing an affinity for Scotch Ales. This is delicious (borderline refreshing even!) and doesn't have an overbearing warming effect as one might expect. Perfect balance from start to finish. Really enjoyed this one."
"M/D: Slightly bigger than medium bodied with very nice carbonation. Has a nice smooth mouthfeel. A flavorful beer that is a nice treat. Solid for the style for sure."
"The mouthfeel is a little more thin than you might expect from a beer this big. But, again, not detracting. This one is easy to drink. One of the better scotch ales I've had."
"D: Great malty brew without being syrupy or overly sweet. Thanks again Jay!"
"Well done dark horse. Slightly sweet just like I remember Plead the 5th RIS. good carbonation and a healthy thick body for a 9.7%"
"Pours a near black, deep brown with amber hues. Great lacing as I swirl it around the glass. Aroma is of caramel, bready malts, and some diacetyl. Alcohol is very barely present. Flavor follows the nose with a big toffee, caramel malt sweetness. Diacetyl again, but not overbearing. Little to no hop presence in the finish. Leaves a sticky, sweet coating on the palate. Creamy, velvety body with moderate bubbly carbonation. Overall, not bad for the style. Bit disappointed with the diacetyl characteristics, but still above average."
"This is a must try and another winner from Dark Horse Brewing Company."
"D. Off the charts drinkability. My wife had a sip and then wanted to switch beers with me. She usually stays away from stronger ales but not this. I could have easily had 2 or 3 pints of this had I not been driving. Well done."
"It is complex, but perhaps not the flavors that I really look for in a beer."
"Overall I thought this was a good unique scotch ale. I like the fact that this beer incorporated some smokey peat flavors. You would think more scotch ales would have smoked peat flavors like this one but I find this one in the minority. I am glad Dark Horse took a typical scotch ale and transformed it into a one of a kind brew, good job guys, this is not a brew to pass up."
"Its pretty damn good, I'd go for this one again."
"Quite drinkable. Not sure I could have too many as it is heavy and pretty high alcohol but definitely tasty."
"The taste is crazy. I find this to be one of the more complex beers I have had. I have a little trouble describing the taste, it's definitely got a sweetness and malt to it. It tastes similar to other scotch ales, but I somehow like it better. For the ABV, the absence of the alcohol taste is surprising. This one is highly drinkable, which means trouble at this alcohol content. One of my favorite scotch ales and another winner from Dark Horse."
"Pours a very dark brown with a bit of a crimson hue. Off-white head starts out fairly high and falls somewhat quickly into a nice cap and collar. Some spotty lacing on the edges of the glass. The nose is pretty sweet with quite a bit of caramel and some dark fruits. A bit of a smoked character there as well. The peated malt really comes through quite a bit more in the taste, overwhelming some of the other characteristics. Some dryness in the finish; almost woody. Slight bitterness. Drinkability is pretty good, though this is a bit too far toward the peaty end of the spectrum for me."
"Get this."
"This is another outstanding beer by Dark Horse Brewing Company!"
"Good stuff. Best aged until the bottles appear somewhat bright. The freshly bottled stuff holds its haze for a while and it can be a bit hot."
"D: The light body, especially considering the high ABV, makes this easy to drink, but it could have been a little less watery/thin. Also, I'm not sure why there isn't more of a peat flavor: I certainly would have enjoyed this much more with more pronounced smokiness. I guess I'd say this leans more towards a Wee Heavy than a Scotch Ale by its flavor profile."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it had some very nice flavors going on. I really liked the addition of the smoke flavors in the finish, it really made it a little more complex and delicious for me. Very nice beer overall and a cool and different take on the style compared to others I've had."
"Served to me in an absinthe-style, stemmed glass - dug it - wanted, but didn't expect a lil' head (I am versed in the style). Lightly purple-ish reddish brown - thin haze. Whoa! - 9.75%??! It drank a little weighty - malt-wise - on the tongue - counter-balanced/smothered that alc, I guess. Well-made all-around. Doesn't remind me of Scotland, per se, but it doesn't identify itself really as anything other than a Wee Heavy. I'll go with that. I'd choose it again."
"d 3 found myself really wanting this to be thicker and richer. the uncloaked sensation of alcohol, a related feature, was too much IMO."
"Drinkability here is good as well, a sipper for sure, but what do you expect from a big beer like this. Nice and warming on a cold winter's night."
"Mouthfeel was a little ""thicker"" than I would like to see out of any beer, and paired with the high ABV made it hard to drink more than one."
"One of my favorite rhyming beer names. It pours a murky black-sienna topped by around a finger or so of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, mandarin oranges, a touch of peat-smoked malt, and red apples. The taste holds notes of cinnamon, cherrywood-smoked honey-baked ham, cocoa, caramel, and a hint of oak. The body is a hefty medium, with a somewhat light moderate carbonation, a slightly chewy feel, and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice scotch ale, all the nicer thanks to the understated smokiness."
"Drinkability- Definitely easy to take down (but hits you a bit later). Not too overwhelming but overall very complex and pleasing to the tongue (and stomach)"
"Dark mahogany color with a thin beige head forming on top, then slowly dissolving away to a ring on top. The malt is very malty giving off a strong malty fragrance with a malty aroma lingering on the nose. There are touches of smoke and dried, did I mention there was some malt. The malty dominates the taste (surprise!) from front to back, with a dried fruit and caramel sweetness blending in at the end. A hearty feel, with a chewy texture and clings to the palate. It finishes with a mild warmth from alcohol. This is a beer for a bitter cold night, the malt makes this a comfy beer ."
"I know, I know... don't judge a beer by its label. Yet as I reached for this on the shelf at the store I thought, ""This thing is definitely going to be over-hopped. Look at the label."" Sure enough, for a Scotch ale this thing is over-hopped. The hops aren't very apparent in the aroma, and the slightly smoky malt is the dominant force. But the taste tilts toward citrus and even seaweed. I like nori as much as the next sushi lover, but not in my beer. If you're looking for a good American Scotch ale, you'll do far better with those from Geary or Founders. Leave this one on the shelf."
"D- Nothing really wows me about this beer. The flavors are a little subdued and it is kind of harsh going down. Probably a good thing considering the very well hidden ABV."
"Bottle from Hopscotch. Pours a ruddy brown with a red hue and a small beige head. Nose of rich, gooey chocolate and caramel fudge. Amazing likeness there. A touch smoky. Mouth is creamy, rich, full of that slightly smoky, somewhat bitter chocolate fudge and caramel. Much like eating a cake. Some hop bitterness brings up the back end. A tad watery. This is nice, and I'm pleasantly surprised. Thanks man!"
"I got this one as an extra in a trade with ljkeats a while back! Thanks again! Poured into a tulip. Pours somewhat dark toffee brown color with zero head on this. Pretty color but overall this looks kind of dull. I don't know if I really smell this or I think I smell this because this is a Scotch Ale but there seems to be a big scotch aroma that I'm really into with this one. The aroma is coated with scotch, boozy toffee, thick malts and a slight fruity presence. Solid flavors on this one to. Again, scotch with a big malt backbone and a slight spiciness to it a toffee sweetness. This is kickin'! Kind of a light body and low carbonation, this is solid but I think I'd like it more if it were a bit heavier. This drinks real nice for a near ten percent beer. Definitely want more of these for the winter."
"Pours a deep amber too brownish color with a small light tan head. In the aroma, caramel, and hints of dark fruits and smokiness. In the taste, caramel and small roastiness, small smokiness, and ends with a small alcohol dryness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and hints of fruit in the aftertaste. Hides the alcohol and quite nice."
"I got to say I was really impressed with this one. Pours a dark amber, sort of hazy but not as dark as a porter just slightly dark. Had a half inch of head. Smells of slight bourbon, caramel malts, and faint hops. Taste was amazing for almost 10 percent, you get faint alcohol then a bite of hops to mellow, then the sweet caramel finish. Mouthfeel didn't seem that heavy at all with a medium kind of body. I was assuming the entire time it was around 8 percent! Drink ability is kind of good if I were to find it again but this one was on tap at a place in south side so I may find a bottle of this stuff floating around somewhere. The best part was the tap handle was a shotgun shaped and they said everyone always asked ""whats on the shotgun?"" Smooth beer."
"D: Could drink a few of these for sure..."
"D: The alcohol is hidden nicely in this beer. Despite the high ABV, I could enjoy several in a sitting, especially on a cold winter night."
"The folks over at Dark Horse have a world class beer on their hands."
"Nice offering from Dark Horse, of the scotch ales i've had this one is near the top. good stuff. Excellent deep dark body, nice head. taste is smoke and molasses. but what else would you want from this style. I'll continue to buy this one. nice beer."
"This strong beer does not keep you guessing. It is straight forward, and the Scottish style yeast resembles a Belgian that is balanced and creamy, this beer is great from start to finish. Preferred warm (about 50-52F) vs. cooler(refrigerator; <42F) based on the 12 oz. bottles and great for an evening dinner pair, besides for spicy dish. 9/10 or A- overall."
"D: I don't have access to this so I don't see myself drinking a lot of these. It's a good beer, but nothing amazing. I would definitely drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. This one I think gets better with food, versus by itself."
"Overall: Some of the main reasons I don't enjoy some Scotch ales is the accumulating sweetness and cloying nature of their bodies. However, this one packs a balance flavor, full body, but manages to avoid my personal pitfalls of the style."
"The feel of this beer is a pretty easy, drinkable beer. It goes down smooth and is refreshing with a small aftertaste that gives back a caramel flavor."
"DB- A scotch ale that shows its size. The malt profile is huge and not as sweet as most other examples of the style, sort of has a Brown Ale feeling. Alcohol gives this one a rough edge but there are certainly times when I look for that. Definitely worth a shot, especially if you enjoy the style."
"I like it and I'd drink it again. And it has the markings of a Scotch Ale. But think of it like a bitter brown that someone added a dash of ""Scotch Ale Flavor Syrup"" to."
"Drinkability: Very dangerous Scotch Ale, as it does not seem to be close to 10% at all. Complex and, blessedly, not too sweet. Just a great Scotch Ale overall."
"Scotty Karate is a bit different than many Scotch Ales but that is not a bad thing. Very easy to drink, the alcohol is held in check very well. Could drink a couple of these in a sitting. Great beer for a cool fall night."
"D - This is a sipper for sure. i don't want to run to the fridge for another but It taste great and every sip is enjoyable. I would recommend this."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation. wouldn't object to a revisit, but i'm set with a bottle per sitting."
"A nice beer overall w/about average drinkability for the style."
"Recommend drinking at a higher temp than I did (fridge temp approx. 35 F) because as it warmed the flavors became more decipherable and more palatable."
"A decent take on the style, but just not doing a whole lot for me. The taste is a bit confusing and the alcohol is up there which brings the drinkability down."
"Considering it's 9.75% I didn't think it was overpowering in terms of the alcohol content but I wouldn't have more than one at a time. Surprised (and happy)! that it was served in a pint glass."
"This bottle was about a year or so old"
"D - Good, but sweet and slick. Kinda thick but finishes pretty clean. One glass was great, but I probably won't have two in a row."
"D: I could session this brew, being that it is high in ABV and price, I don't feel that, this would be the case, but overall a very drinkable brew in regards to overall tastes."
"Drinkability is what I'd expect for a Wee Heavy. I'll be following this with something lighter-bodied and more bitter."
"Mouthfeel is regrettably thin. This beer deserves better."
"note....in my original notes I missed the ABV...I didn't notice the heat/weight of a +9% in there."
"Thanks Megan, for bringing this one over the other night. Poured a nice medium mahogany color, with a smallish light brown head. Aromas of whisky, caramel, dark brown sugar. Smooth and warming on the palate, with dark fruit, caramel and brown sugar. A very delicious and drinkable scotch ale."
"not too strong to affect drinkability. I would definitley drink again"
"D: A very good scotch ale. very similar to Old Chub by Oscar Blues."
"Nice beer."
"Nice, I like it. Rather sweet and strong to be an easy drinker. Try it."
"O: Not something I would buy again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dissuade others. Maybe the taste will grow on me some day."
"D: Although I'm not too high on the look of this beer, everything else about it is very appropriate. Nice and malty and rich with a great boozy kick. Complex. Appropriate feel that makes it go down easy. Drinks much easier than an almost 10% brew. If this one is found near you, definitely give it a shot. Great beer typical of its style."
"coming from someone who loves malt heavy beer, this goes down pretty easily. could i drink this all the time? given the abv, probably not, but that doesn't stop it from being delicious."
"D - One of the few beers I like from Dark Horse, this is a very well rounded scotch ale and recommended to all you like the style."
"o - I've been looking forward to this one for a long time, and it did not disappoint. one of my favorite scotch ales."
"This is a very tasty beer but the drinkability suffers a little due to the boozy finish/aftertaste. Will buy again..."
"Overall, a very good beer that's worth seeking out."
"D: No booziness, that's a big plus. Indulgent malts, that's a plus. Plenty of peat smoke, that's a plus. I'm not seeing any downside. An excellent wee heavy."
"Overall a nice beer. Closer to a heavy Rauchbier than scotch ale, but has its heavy sweetness. Perhaps this is more what a scotch ale should be. I really enjoyed it."
"D: A great sipper. I enjoyed this one while relaxing on my porch."
"D- its a good beer, but due to the sweetness I wouldn't be able to drink to many of these."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium thick and the finish is medium full. This is one of my favorite Dark Horse brews. It has a lot of character, low hop flavor, and rich malt present. The malt isn't over powering, but rather balanced. I love this beer."
"Overall I thought this was a very well done wee heavy. Worth a shot."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy dark brown/copper color with about an inch beige head that went away quickly. There's also a small amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is nice and malty, the beer smells like caramel malt, peat/smoke, toffee and nuts. It tastes like smoke/peat, toffee, nuts, raisins, molasses and also a bit of an earthy flavor. The smoke flavor lingers around in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and rich with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. The almost 10% ABV isn't very noticable at all. I think this is a good brew, I'd definitely buy this again."
"This seems to be drinking really well, maybe I'm just thirsty, but making in through this glass is no problem."
"D- Nice scotch style ale that I would love to drink again and again. Dark Horse makes a fine scotch ale and I hate to share it."
"Absolutely superb flavor. There's a great blend of darker malts without any burnt notes. More hoppy than most Scotch ales, but I think this adds to the flavor. At nearly 10% abv, it is stunning how little alcohol shows up on the tongue (some comes through on the swallow). This is a deceptively strong beer."
"Dark Horse continues to impress. Scotty Karate is a nice Scotch Ale. I'm really tempted to award the next highest flavor score, but just can't get there. It seems to lack just a little something extra to get it there. Nonetheless, it's very good. The nose could use some work, but it's a solid performer otherwise. Easily recommended."
"I will have a couple of these while I read a book. Solid evening."
"The taste of Scotty Karate struck me as bacon soaked in hop-flavored coffee. Unique, sure...creative, perhaps...but tasty? Not a chance. Charred, beefy malts fight with medicinal phenolics in the finish, flooding an otherwise pleasant chocolatey scotch malt profile. Pine sap bitterness on the end tastes out of place and overly-complex. At least the near 10% ABV is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is muddled and over-carbonated, giving it a thinner body than it should have. Juicy at times, crisp and dry at others. I'm normally a big fan of Dark Horse, but this beer is a hot mess. Avoid."
"Bottle poured into a large snifter. Dark purple/brown color.. fizzy with medium head. Smell is floral and perfume-like: a mix of potpourris and spices. This a really odd-smelling beer, unlike any I've tried. Taste is smoky and creamy. Reminds me of a mellowed-whiskey or cigar smoke. Alcohol presence is very tame, and this is surprisingly drinkable."
"M/D- medium bodied, low carb. good drinkability. overall interesting beer and worth a shot."
"Drinkablity is high despite the high ABV. I could put a few of these back easily."
"Drinkability: Wow what a great beer from Dark Horse. A nice and complex, semi-fruity, rich, and malty masterpiece. This hits all the high points of Scotch ales. I wish I picked up a four pack of this."
"Brown bottle with no freshness indication to be found but with nearly 10% abv we wont have any issues here. Pours a clear dark amber/brown with a finger of khaki colored head. Head receeds fairly fast with an audible crackling of the bubbles. It disperses to just a thin film on top of the beer supported by pretty much constant bubbles of carbonation. Aroma is...wow. This is the first time I can truely thank myself for being a homebrewer and being able to identify the unmistakeable aroma of pete smoked barley. The nose also includes other malt and an vibrant alcohol presence. Taste is inline with the smell of the beer. Pete smoked barley creastes the minor illusion of sipping scotch. Flavors of heavy malt, smoke, oak and alcohol prevail. Medium to heavy feel would seem more full bodied if it didnt have such a modest amount of carbonation. Very drinkable to the point of being dangerous considering it flirts with double digits worth of alcohol. Lingering taste of the pete'd barley is left in the mouth. Very nicely done overall with the only gripe that the amount of the pete smoked character pretty much overwhelms the other flavors this beer could have shown. As it warms, a little note of sweet caramel comes through the smokiness and the alcohol remains notably warming."
"Purchased a 4 pack at PHP in Brookline. Noticed a layer of sediment at bottom of bottle, was careful not to pour into glass. Served in stemmed glasses. Murky brown color. Nice sized head. Good amount of lacing. Smell was malty and smoky. In the taste, there was definitely a peaty flavor, but it was much more subdued that other scotch ales I have had recently. I think it prefer it this way actually. The scent and flavor of smoke and peat is there, but it doesn't overpower the beer. Very much just a nice background aspect. Smooth body, could be a bit thicker, but that might reduce its drinkability. High abv is certainly noticeable about halfway through the glass. A great beer, surely worth a try from a brewery that is just gaining some presence in the Mass market."
"Pretty drinkable. Good beer overall, looking forward to the other 3 bottles of this SCOTCH ALE (!!!) dug was kind enough to send me."
"The body was medium full and was on the lower side of carbonation. The huge amount of smokiness at the end hampered drinkability and the 10oz. snifter was a perfect size as I think it would start to be a bit much if I it was served as a full pint."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Forgot to mention that the label artwork is priceless. Kind of like a troll on acid."
"I just didn't enjoy this beer at all. If I ever cross paths again with this beer I'll re-review it. Seems like it will be easier now that Dark Horse is available in MA."
"drinkability is good. I don't like smoke flavors in my beer and havent really like scotch ales in the past, though I have actually enjoyed the two bottles of this I picked up. alcohol is apparent in the nose, but not in the flavor as there is a lot going on when you sip. Would drink this again, but not on a regular basis."
"This is a very nice beer from Riverhorse."
"Would I buy more of it? - oh hell yes. I'll be on the lookout for more of this before its off the shelves."
"D- A nice rich, malty brew. Very warming and a great beer to drink on a chilly night. These guys always come through for me!"
" Drink with caution as the high ABV is very well hidden. This is a definite sipper."
"All in all, this is a decent brew to try once. If you like scotch ales / wee heavy's, then you will enjoy this brew. Otherwise, this is not for you if you don't enjoy the boozy flavor."
"A pretty easy drinker for nearly 10% but the quality of beer would keep me from wanting more."
"Not my favorite Scottish or Scotch ale, that would be Robert the Bruce, but this was very good and certainly worth having again."
"D - A very good looking brew with excellent aroma... We lose a little bit when it comes to flavor and mouthfeel we lose a little bit... However, this is a solid brew all the way around... I won't have any trouble working my way through the rest of the 4-pack... Alcohol is well hidden in terms of taste and heat, but catches up with you pretty quickly..."
"D: I like this beer. It's not as smoky as i thought it was going to be. Very drinkable for 9.75%. Besides the initial warmth the alcohol is pretty well hidden. I would definitely drink this again."
"This one has balls and certainly not for the faint of heart. Drinkability depends on one's tolerance for the heavy character and smoky attributes. For me, it's right up there with Founder's as the best of the Scots, right here in the States."
"In the end I just did not like how this came together, it seemed a bit clouded and disjointed and I think the alcohol could be toned down. I tried this on tap to and it was not that much better."
"Pours a very, very dark color, almost pitch black with a nice tight head that clings to the glass perfectly. Head is creamy and frothy, body full. Aromas is musty, like a wet fall day almost. Taste has a lot going on, dried cherries, twigs, leafs, earthy. Brewer notes said hints of asparagus - failed to pick that up, not sure I'd enjoy it in my beer if I did. Goes down smooth with a lingering taste like black licorice/coffee cross. A wonderfully enjoyable beer on a cold winter night."
"pours a dark brown color almost like a stout it has a 1 finger head that stays with the pour with a beige clinging ring..the smell is dark with roasted coffee , toast, nuts, currant fruits and toffee/malts with a nice balance of hops with some roasted malts ..the taste is outstanding its roasted coffee some chocolate, nuts, and toffee i taste some fruit in this one some fig some nutmeg and some hops.. WOW a lot going on in this wee-heavy its creamy smooth with the almost 10% abv its not detectable.. delicious... its one of the best scotch ales ive had..it beats dirty bastard it beats robert the bruce..this is the one.. try/buy this one and enjoy it with a robust dinner or around the fireplace"
"D: Super smooth and full bodied, exceptionally drinkable beer."
"Not too sweet, almost perfect for the style."
"This beer has a good collection of flavors, an appealing malty sweetness, and a prominent smoky character. The high alcohol level in this beer is really well hidden, revealed only by a light note in the nose and a subtle warmth on the palate. A fine example of the strong wee heavy style. And if you like smoky beers, don't miss this one."
"D - It's a bit murky but quite drinkable regardless. I'm glad more Dark Horse brews are making it down this way."
"I was taken by surprise by this one. I tend to hate Scotch Ales, but this beer might have caused me to rethink my overall opinion of the style. Its that good. Might be the best Dark Horse beer I have had yet."
"D: one of the best Dark Horse brews I have had yet. This is a great number and deserves a try...solid marks all around"
"D: No thank you."
"D- I was almost shocked when I read this one is 9%. A very solid beer and will be back for more."
"D-Very Drinkable! I'm generally a little cautious with Darkhorse's stouts, but this was exceptionally easy to drink but still had enough complexity to make it interesting. The Scotty Karate was a quite pleasant surprise that I will be sure to drink again :)"
"D-its very smooth and hides the alcohol very well. the smokiness makes it less drinkable for me but all the malts seem to follow the style."
"Usually Dark Horse flies beneath the radar for me, but when one of there beers is included as an extra, bring it on. Color is dark brown, and slightly lighter toward the bottom of the glass. I may have left this one in the freezer for a bit too long, as not much head formed after a hard pour. The nose has peat, smoke, chocolate, caramel, and again, some smoke. Taste has all the aspects of a good strong Scotch Ale that I like, such as the smells listed above. What I am amazed by is how well balanced this beer is. Sometimes Scotch Ales can come off a bit one sided or dirty, but everything works really well here. One can also really get the Scotch aspect from a beer like this. The 9% provides a very nice warming sensation to accompany all of the complexities going on. It definitely feels like a full bodied beer, while at the same time coming off very elegant and drinkable. One of the best Scotch Ales I have ever encountered without a doubt. It would be nice to have Dark Horse around here. Cheers to Mike for throwing in this great extra."
"D - I'd stop after one. The flavor could be a little cloying or even downright undrinkable to some I'm sure. I'm enjoying it for what it is though. Very Scottish."
"mouthfeel is a bit thin, somewhat overcarbonated. very marginal difference. great sipper, easy drinking for a huge beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Definitely would recommend it to anyone who enjoys scotch ales. Probably wouldn't drink more than a couple though, it is a bit heavy. All in all a great beer."
"D- Slightly warming. This beer is a pretty rich and malty brew which is a good thing, its 17 degrees here tonight."
"Bottle serving."
"D: A fine example of a Scotch ale. Worth checking out for anyone that agrees that it is a style that deserves more attention."
"I really like this. It is pretty much spot on for the style. A little more smoky than most, but that is not a bad thing at all. Highly recommended."
"A very good representation of a scottish ale but with the high ABV, makes it difficult to have too many."
"Mouthfeel is light but filmy, very carbonated and effervescent. Fairly drinkable, but the sweetness would get to me after a while."
"D: Very high and I wish I had another sitting here to crack open. Great offering from Dark Horse."
"D - Scotty Karate is one of the better scotch ales I have tried. However, I didn't get much of the peat or smokiness that I am used to in scotch ales. That aside, the flavor profile was very good and enjoyable throughout. I am glad I picked up a 4 pack of this."
"Drinkability: This is a very interesting and complex beer and a nice interpretation of a Scotch Ale. If it were not for the ABV I could drink several of these in an evening. I really would like another and would be happy to do so. Very drinkable"
"I love the artwork it's from a guest artist out of Austin, TX, what's better to represent that then a viking hat adorned fu manchu wearing one man band musician rocking out on the drums, guitar, and banjo with foot pedals intact for effects. Pours a murky dark cola amber brown with ruby highlights when held toward the light. Head was quickly dwindling highly carbonated fizzy sounding as it settled, kind of a turn off at first with minimal head left behind. Aroma has a caramel plum fruit and raisin infused booziness at first sniff. With my first sip in addition to caramel, plum, raisin and booze I get an oak barrel or tree bark bitterness with evident smoked malts gathering on the palate together a touch of whiskey and vanilla this is complex like some herbal tea with a whiskey chaser blended with birch syrup root beer if that makes sense at all. With my next few sips the smoke meat characteristic even jumps into the party I'm sure this may be peated malt at this point but it's really riding a wave with carbonation that is sharp but not too lively. Mouthfeel overall is a bit cloying for me, at this point the carbonation is sharp but not lively it kind of lands flat as soon as the initial harshness passes the palate, but a smoked meat syrup layer is left behind with some charred oak and minimal vanilla that bring the heat with it. Drinkability overall depends on what your into, me I'm having carbonation issues, but does that effect my experience as a whole. Final answer it has to because it effects the way that the other flavors are sensed on the palate. In this case I feel that smoked peated malt sensation overstays it's welcome yet makes the beer memorable in an extreme sort of way. Booze ridden for sure but this beer is going for all of that, I applaud the effort it was a fun experience but damn how many of these can or do I want to drink?"
"Drinkability is average. Nothing really calling me to have another, but still a good one-and-done beer."
"Ok, no please excuse me while I finish up this 4-pack."
"D: Maybe my taste buds are becoming insensitive, but this beer isn't overwhelming to my palate at all. The price is right and it certainly has my stomach a little warmed up. One of the better Dark Horse brews I reckon."
"Having tried other scotch beers, this gets my mark as one of the better ones in the genre. Try it sometime, you'll like it."
"This beer pours an opaque brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, alcohol, toffee, and hints of astringency. It is a very strong aroma with decent complexity. The taste is full of caramel, more so than the aroma, some toffee, minor astringency. Nice tasting. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a good Scotch Ale. Good, but not great. I would drink it again though without hesitation."
"D - I haven't counted myself as a fan of Scotch Ales, but at this point it's been so long since I've actually had one that my tastes have shifted. I'm not sure that I can determine whether Scotty Karate is a good representative of the style, but I did find it tasty."
"D-One of these at a time is probably enough but it is very drinkable. Dark Horse rarely disappoints. This brew is no exception. Nicely done."
"This beer poured a very dark murky amber color and formed a small light tan bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, caramel, peat and coffee. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and coffee with hint of anise. The body was medium consistency and the finish leanings towards bittersweet. The alcohol also peaks through here. I just wish I could be at the brewpub whenever it is on tap, I always seem to miss it."
"I am curious how this would mellow after some aging time. . . ."
"Pretty drinkable, and overall a decent beer, but it wasn't what I expected."
"This is the best Scotch Ale that I have ever had."
"D: Good, I might order another, though I wouldn't buy a four pack."
"The beer was hazy brown with a creamy head. The aroma was roasty with a style-appropriate aroma of alcohol. The flavor is of roasted grain and it finished with a surprising sweetness. There was no hop bitterness, all the bitter was created by the great roasted malt profile. For drinkability, this was a 10% abv, and it was very drinkable, you didn't get a taste of that alcohol that you know and can smell is there."
"Overall- I LOVE DARK HORSE!!! if this was founders or dogfish or any other company 4 pack it would be $10+ but it's dark horse AND THEY HOLD IT DOWN!! they truely think of the people. this beer to me is one unique scottish ale. i've had so far arcadia's (who i think that's their best beer), founder's dirty bastard, and dragonmead from warren's scottish ale. if you're a fan of the scottish ale this one is definitely worth a try!"
"The alcohol is more apparent in the end then the start - a good, not great beer, worth having. Hard for me to have more than one in a sitting."
"Great beer that I would recommend to anyone, unless they hate amazing beer."
"M/D - Rich, thick, great drinker that doesn't seem like half the alcohol it does. Wow!"
"Old DLD trade I found in the back of the fridge. Pours a very dark brown with almost no head at all. Huge sweet malty smell with a burnt caramel quality. The taste is just wonderful. This was a fantastic beer. A huge cramael taste that sits briefly on the tongue and then is gone with almost no aftertaste. Just slightly boozey, but a fantstic taste."
"A good one really, on tap at The Hunt Club. This is about a year aged as an old seasonal. Above average mouthfeel from a creaminess, with really chocolate coming through. A tad of roast, but I was not finding the smoke. Not what I would expect from a scotch, nevertheless pleasant."
"A dark brown-purple beer with little head, Scotty Karate is murky and deep. The aroma is fruity with good malt caramelization. There's warm spicing and a lot of malt. The flavor is strong and sweet, nice for the style. The mouthfeel is smooth. There's a nice alcoholic estery character that aids drinkability, but it's still a strong Scotch Ale and I can't consume too much of any Scotch Ale. Good beer, sweet, spicy sipper."
"12oz. Poured a deep reddish-brown and a rigorous pour revealed a decent light tannish colored head with good retention and left a limited but sticky, spotty lacing on the side of the glass. Aromas are a huge malty sweetness containing dark brown sugar, caramel, and toffee. Tastes are very similar to the aroma, but more complex than expected. Sweet like candy with notes of dark brown sugar, caramel, toffee. As the ale warms, notes of cherry and plum come through with a somewhat masked hint of citrus. At 9.75% ABV, the alcohol is very well concealed. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and rather syrupy, yet very creamy and smooth. Finishes very sweet as a Wee Heavy should. Overall, very good example of the style and definitely recommendable."
"For almost 10% alcohol, this drinks amazingly well. Perhaps I was just craving a wee heavy today, I don't know, but damn I am nearly chugging this and I can't stop myself. Great beer overall."
"On-tap at 3 Squares in Maple Grove, MN. Served in a pint glass it was dark brown with a couple fingers of tan head. I don't like my scotch ales to dry or heavy, but this beer didn't disappoint. It was smooth a just sweet enough to make for a good after-dinner beer. The flavor was a mix of sweet cherries, strawberries, and date mixed with chocolate candy (not very milky, but sweet). In the background there was just a hint of earthy peat flavor. Overall very nice and drinkable. Seek this out if you dig the style."
"This is damn well one easy drinking brew. At 9.75%ABV though, it is not to be trifled with. It will mess you up, bad."
"On tap at 3 Squares. Dark brown color with no head, although I do not judge the head on tap beers. A nice caramel malt aroma and flavor come through for the smell and the taste. The flavor is somewhat sweet, but not overly sweet. Nicely balanced. Some toffee comes through as well. Medium to heavy bodied with low to medium carbonation. This is very drinkable, but watch the alcohol, it sneaks up on you. While I drank this on tap I had no idea the ABV was as high as it is. Overall a nice beer."
"Drinkability: IMHO this was a lame Scotch ale. Scotty Karate proved to be decent in every category, but never anything more."
"D: Too high for the near 10%. I say throw caution to to the wind and drink a 6er at a time if your lucky enough to get your hands on 'em."
"D= great! I love scotch ales and this one was pretty nice but nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability??? Shit you don't know who your F'in with here. The booze is so well hidden, you could get in MUCH trouble with this beer. Be careful, it's so damn tastey you want to drink it fast, but it WILL bite you in the ass."
"A rather nicely sippable Wee Heavy I would gladly drink it again Thanks again Tyson"
"Drinkability: Pretty high, actually, even considering the higher ABV. Definitely worth drinking a couple in a sitting just to enjoy the great balance presented by the sweet malts and the nice hop presence."
" Dark Horse rocks, Scotty Karate rocks !"
"Poured into pint glass, nice dark color, though light tan/off-white head disappears rather quickly. Sweet smell dominated by caramel and malt. Taste is very good, with sweet malt and dark chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired, as it is a little bit on the syrupy side. This is, however, a dangerously drinkable beer that I could consume all night long; the second I finished I wished I had another."
"Fairly mainstream for a Wee Heavy, and not really outstanding other than it's a bit boozy."
"D - I prefer Robert the Bruce as it's not as sweet."
"D: Although there is a bit of alcohol warmth, I wouldn't call it boozy at all. It goes down smooth and easy."
"Tasted like a solid beer, a little sweet malt but not overly sweet. Nice and smooth, for almost 10% it went down fast. Alcohol may prevent it but this beer improved dramatically every sip. At first I was satisfied but alittle dissapointed, by the end I wanted more."
"An enjoyable scotch ale from Dark Horse. Time for another."
"Notes: this beer is so good its unfair to the majority of scotch ales out there, even the well known ones, like Dirty Bastard. age it for a year or more and it seems to get better. just awesome. one of my favorite beers"
"Very sweet with carmelly notes--smooth, with a refreshing mouthfeel. Just the right amount of smokiness."
"Forget the first two scores. I don't drink beer because of the way it looks or smells. I drink beer because of the way it tastes. Scotty Karate Scottish Ale is the real deal and should be sought out by anyone who loves a good wee heavy. Thanks to bakerslp for the bottle."
"Just not as complex or not as deep flavor as Oscar Blues or Lake Louie versions. Surprising given the high abv, good not great, especially for the 4 pack price."
"Comment: A lot of press on this ""wee heavy."" Still, it goes quite well with a smoked salmon sandwich and a cone of fries with southwest mayo."
"D: A perfect beer for a camping trip, sitting around the campfire. Very nice, not an everyday beer, but good."
"I'm a bit embarrassed that I couldn't ID this as a Scotch Ale, but the Strut is more a coffee place than a bar; they've got about four beers on tap. I never figured they'd go for anything with any kind of complexity or serious ABV; my opinion of the place has gone way up based on realizing what this beer really is."
"Pours a dark cola brown with ruby red highlights. There is a 1/4"" head that quickly diminishes to a slight ring. There is a good bit of white sediment on the bottom of the glass. Smell is mostly fresh bread and a lot of malt. The taste is all malt with sour cherries and sweeter dark fruits. There is a slight earthy peat flavor as well. Almost like a forest floor. The mouthfeel is creamy but there is a bite to this beer. Its tangy but not too sour. The alcohol is well hidden which makes this one easier to drink but its still a sipper. Great big Scotch Ale. I'm very impressed."
"An extremely deep red, nearly black beer. About two fingers of brown sugar colored head, disappears relatively quick, not much lacing. Smells of sweet caramel malts, with a bit of an alcohol edge. Taste is much the same, a lot of flavor to this. Sweet malts, a bit of brown sugar, and an alcoholic warmth round out the taste. Light-medium bodied, and a definite drinkability. I wish that I had another one of these right now. Any fan of scotch ales should enjoy this beer."
"Taste: Quite a bit of smokiness to it. Earthy is a good word to describe this beer. More complex than most Scotch ales I've had."
"D - This is a great tasting scotch ale and one that I will definitely seek out again, but being so high in alc.% you really can only have so many of these."
"Drinkability: Definitely high. Really smooth and pleasingly complex representation of the style."
"Wow! Dark Horse strikes again. This is my new fav. Dark and malty w/ a bread/fruit nose. Tastes like bread without the bite of the 9.75% alc. Not to be underestamated. I've only got 2 left on the shelf and one is going to my basement for aging. Peace!"
"D - drink it slow and enjoy."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a small, tight tan head that hangs around until it eventually settles to a thin cap. Malt really comes through in the aroma. Has a smell of dark bread, toffee, and hazlenut. Thick malty taste. Just a hint of dark fruit and nuts. Sweet flavor overall. No hint of the 9.75% ABV. Thick and creamy mouthfeel combined with the maltiness makes this a big beer. One of the best Scotch Ale I have had and one of the better Dark Horse beers."
"D: Really tasty sipper that goes down twice as smooth as one would think after reading this brews credentials. This beer has opened my eyes to the scotch ale wee heavy style. Looking forward to trying some others."
"Good overall, but not great and not as good as the other dark offerings from Dark Horse."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is dark red with a creamy tan head. The smell is all malt and ethanol, very sweet and caramel-like, very good for the style. The taste is likewise good, malty and sweet with an alcohol burn. A thick and rich meal in a glass. Can Dark Horse do anything poorly? They are an excellent brewery, I'm pretty confident in each purchase from their fine arsenal."
"Pours a very dark amber brown color with no head from a hard pour and no lacing. Aroma is nutty, with loads of caramel and dark sugar. Flavor is loaded with caramel. It's sweet, but not cloyingly so. Hints of nuts, a little bit of maple syrup, and the lightest herbal, grassy hop tinge in the background. It's definitely not balanced. This is sweet and malt centric. I like it. I like it a lot. Mouthfeel is thich and creamy, medium to full bodied. If the alcohol truly is 9.75%, I'm impressed because I can't taste or feel it at all. Very nice brew. I think I'll have another."
"D: I'll try again perhaps--only qualm is the higher alcohol makes this more of a sipper, but its flavors don't necessarily warrant that."
"Splendid mouthfeel, with the smooth malty texture carrying the day but not without more carbonation than I expected. Very delicious but also strong, the 9.75% ABV catches up before this is through. Yet this us a tremendous Scotch Ale, ranking right there with Founders Dirty Bastard, the perpetually underrated brewery Sprecher Pipers, and Traquair Jacobite atop my personal list of favorite Scotch Ales. Very delicious and not to be passed by."
"Tastes robust. Rich wet sweet with dark grains and dark fruits. Malt is toffee, dry chocolate, and a gentle sour astringency. Fruits are fig, dark raisin, and berry. Finish dries from alcohol and a bit too strong carbonation, which is good as the beer would be way too sticky sweet otherwise. Smoked grain is very low and comes across mostly in the end. Blends well into the chocolate. Thick sticky mouthfeel and medium, yet aggressive carbonation. Drinkability is meh."
"A: Dark latte color, medium layer of foam, somewhat murky, no lingering signs of carbonation - 3.50, S: Slightly vinegary, some alcohol aromas, overly ripe to rotting plums that remind me of a plum brandy, heavy on the malts - 3.25, T: Strong bitterly sweet malts, mildly sour, dates and black raisins - 3.50, M: Heavy - 4.00, D: Scottish Ales are outside of my area of expertise but this one is very pleasant and drinkable - 3.50"
"Pours a dark, cloudy brown color. Great head of an off-white color (2/3 inch) , good retention, and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malts, slight fruit aroma, and a few other ingredients that are beyond me at this time of rating. By far, the most complex beer I've rated up to this point - wow. Fits the style quite nicely. Tastes of roasted malts, some sweetness possibly from malts, low carbonation, sharp bitterness in the background (some herb or spice). There's a tart aftertaste and a dryness after a sip or two. Overall, a strong beer with lots of flavor and body. Complex from beginning to end - worth a try."
"*Trader's Note: Thanks to aqsprint for the opportunity!"
"Loads of caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, cherry, and raisins. Nutty and cola flavors in mid-palate. Toasted finish. Fruity alcohol finish."
"D-After a long week at work, it was a nice change of pace beer. I liked it so much that I had a second one and convinced another at the table to give it a try."
"D-Wow. Although not my typical beer choice, this Scotch ale is pretty darn good. Deep flavor, though perhaps a bit more one-dimensional than expected."
"D - This was nice to try, but I won't seek it out. I generally like Dark Horse, but this wasn't one of their best brews. Alltogether this was decent enough."
"Notes: Scotty Karate may not be the best Scotch Ale ever made, but it's nothing to scoff at. For the price, and the taste, there's no better option in Michigan."
"I poured a bit of the Scotty Karate into a wine glass. The beer is a transparent reddish brown. Smells of caramel and raisin, little bit of smoke, less smoke thanThree Floyds Robert the Bruce. I was overall fairly impressed, for the style it is one of the better ones I've had. I like Robert The Bruce a little more, but just a little more."
"The 9.75% alcohol is barely perceptible, which can be dangerous in a beer that is this creamy and delicious. This is incredibly drinkable for such a potent brew."
"Gotta love it."
"Poured a medium dark cloudy color. Taste was smoky, full, earthy and... did I mention smokey? I've had a few beers that are over-smoked (no real way to put it) and this beer could almost fall in that category. I'm not a fan of smoked beers as, like hops, if overdone it can drown out all the other flavors, but it is kept in check well with this beer."
"Drinkability - a few pleasant spots, but the bitter lemony sour part ruins the beer for me. I had to discard probably eight to nine ounces of the 12."
"D- Very drinkable and I would probably seek this one out again.(Which is a big deal considering how many good beers there are left to try for the first time.)"
"Pours a murky/dirty looking brown with grayish colorings at the edges. Almost no head is created on a pretty heavy pour,maybe the smallest head I have yet to encounter. The nose smells of roasted malts,heavy wheat bread notes,raisins and smoked beef jerky. This is a nice Scottish Ale with some unique flavors. Reminds me of heavily toasted raisin nut bread with some dry almost dusty flavors. The mouthfeel is soft for such a big beer and helps offset the warming alcohol that bites at the throat a little on the finish. This is a solid Wee Heavy with lots of personality to spare."
"D- It's a nice slow sipper and a great cold weather beer."
"Damn good stuff right there."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, strong kick, decent representation of style, not quite the best Scotch Ale that I've had but it's still a decent beer."
"This beer pours a dark amber ale. Smells of scotch and is a bit spicy. The taste is similar to the smell and is very sweet. The big problem I had with this beer was the mouthfeel. I know I am not the only person who feels this way so I do not think I got a bad bottle. This beer just tastes really flat to me. Still, this beer is a nice sipper. Drinkability was decent considering the high abv. I could see myself drinking two of these."
"Note: I really think this needs to be available year round"
"Whole lotta caramel flavor in the first sip with something like a dark roast coffee with a chocolate covered cherry soaking in it chaser right on directly behind it. There's a lot of fat end body in this brew so it coats as it goes down leaving a coffee/chocolate/cherry taste on the back of your mouth and a very warming sensation down the throat and through the body. Woo! Watch out though cuz a bit of a peppery alcohol bite snaps at you in it's finish. The sweet and bitter balances are full of all kinds of flavorful complexities."
"D: Damn good I would say, the mixture of sweetness and smokiness is something I have not encoutered very much in any beer, so any chance I get to experience this makes me happy. ABV on this is hidden quite well and the feel and body of this beer make it go down almost too fast. But I wish it just looked a bit nicer to round out the whole drinking experience."
"D - So smooth and extremely well balanced. Easy drinker..I'd have a couple"
"Pours a nice dark copper color with almost no head (very little for a few seconds) and no lacing. Wonderfully deep scent, very malty, very peaty, and very smoky; an excellent scotch ale aroma. Good taste, nice and malty at first, good smoke and peat tones, but with an odd bitter/hop finish, very strange for a scotch ale. It goes down fine, but a little thick compared to the taste with a hint of alcohol in it."
"Pretty good but it's just not all that interesting. I think I'm going to age the other two bottle I have left from the four pack."
"Good beer in general, but could use more body and less heat. I will keep my remaining bottles in the cellar for one extra year."
"D: 9.75% is really gonna slow things down. A tasty sipper nonetheless, especially if you can get past the mouthfeel. Maybe the carbo was from a bad bottle?"
"D: amazingly drinkable. so smooth for 9.75%. Top notch in my book."
"D- dark horse is great at hiding any taste of alcohol. this one doesnt seem to be a great example of the style, but the smoothness would make it easy to finish. watch out though, this one packs a punch. the bottle i got was from last year, the only way id give this one another chance was if it was very fresh. it just didnt do it for me"
"Pours a very dark brown with some ruby highlights Little to no head on the pour. Smell is caramelized malts and a bit boozy. Taste is more of the malts, a good amount of mustiness and a bit of alcohol/band aid showing up as well. Medium and nice mouthfeel. Another good offering from Dark Horse."
"d: Thanks to joepais for the tasty extra. This wason my wants list just because of the name. This worked out well as this was extremely good."
"Drinks alright, hides the abv well, but a touch too dry"
"Pours a muddy brownish red color with the thinnest of tan head, ok lacing. Smells of toffee, caramel, brown sugar, grapes, milk chocolate, alcohol, and oranges. Tastes of raisins and other dark fruits up front followed by a touch of chocolate, then lots of caramel, brown sugar, and toffee. Finishes with a burst of citrus like oranges and pineapple as well as some booze. Medium full in body and low in carbonation. Chewy with a good variety of maltiness and some fruits to balance it out. Packing some good flavors, but also not skimping on the alcohol, not something I would want to drink if I don't have a lot of time to relax."
"D - I love the dessert like chocolate and cream notes, and the mouth feel is outstanding. A really well done brew, but I don't think that I could take more than one...it's a hair to sweet IMO."
"12 oz bottle: Nice roasted malt notes, creamy, a slight hint of bourbon, gingerbread, light fruit and spiced consist the aroma. Pours a Coca-cola like carbonated clear dark amber with minimal tan head. Taste is the malt comes through on this one with some of the fruit intermingled. palate is quite carbonated on the tongue with it finishing almost dry. Overall, Quite and interesting brew I like it. I had the pleasure of meeting Scotty Karate during a television shoot. An interesting beer for an interesting guy. Cheers!"
"Thanks again to iceicebaby for the opportunity to try this one. Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured an opaque currant. What little froth was evident from the pour quickly dispersed into an oily skim. Some watery lacing, but no adhesion. Nose is almost sickly sweet, with lots of toffee and malt, as well a hint of alcohol. Taste consistent with nose, as well as some dark fruit, a little chocolate and a mild peat-like quality. Mouthfeel is between medium-bodied and syrupy, with only the slightest bit of carbonation. Drinkability is somewhat limited. While the alcohol is well-hidden, the consistency and cloyingly sweet quality limits drinkability."
"This is a highly regarded beer from one of my favorite styles. I hope to revisit this one later and will update my review then."
"All in all another good, drinkable beer by dark horse. As far as a scottish ale goes, the high alcohol is pretty well hidden but still could be considered a scotch ale."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dark brown color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and some minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some toffee and caramel notes. Taste is a mix between some toffee and caramel malt with some quite sweet malt notes with some light dry hops. Body is quite full with some limited filtration and some good carbonation. Well done overall but I would have enjoyed it even more with some peat smoke malt notes."
"Dark Horse is becoming one of my favorite brewers here in Michigan, and there is a lot of strong competition."
"This is a very drinkable Wee Heavy. One of the better ones I've had of which I could drink a significant amount."
"Drinkability: Certainly at the top of the Wee Heavy list in my book; adds some nice American elements to the style that make it eminently enjoyable"
"Drinkability: Plenty tasty! I certainly wouldn't hesitate to have another."
"As far as drinkability goes, the 9.75%abv keept under control, but is not hidden, which is fitting if you've ever met Scotty. That said, this probably isn't your 9am beer. But today, it is mine, suckas."
"D- Damn. I had high hopes for this, but the alcohol is a beast. I don't foresee myself getting this harsh mistress again."
"Very impressive, the cleanest Scotch Ale I have ever run into and dangerously drinkable."
"Tasted on 2/25/08."
"Drinkability- Good drinkability, not warming, smooth and unique. Another all day pounding delicious animal of a beer."
"As fine a Scottish Ale as I've ever tried. Strong and steady on all fronts. Sweet and peaty with herbal hop character and a complex malt meaty character. The texture is a bit less syrupy than big malty Scottish Ales, but sweetened more and makes it more drinkable. A little cleaner in the flavor than most, and less dirty or smoky. The 9%+ alcohol is hardly noticed, hidden well. A stern copper / ruby hue with fair coabonation / head retention. Spicy and sweet throughout. Deserving of better scores than most BA's have given."
"overall a pretty damn good pow beer. Except for the initial quick flash of a weird flavor itsa superb scotch ale. Nice small head with good lace. Hazy dark brown almost opaque color. Peatish characteristics. Hints of booze. No hop. Estery malty finish. Rich body."
"I was not too impressed with this one after my first bottle. I am kind of hoping it went bad somewhere down the line."
"Overall, the most intense Scotch ale I've had. Good, but only if you're in the mood."
"D-I wish this had a bit more carbonation...I don't mind it on the lower side but this is pretty flat...tasty but not memorable....good but not great....I'm glad I tried it and I enjoyed it but I am not making plans to seek out more of this..."
"The bottom line: Dark Horse has some hits and some misses with me, and this is one of the misses. The beer is passable, but there are a number of other local options that I favour that are in the same price range (i.e.: Dirty Bastard, Arcadia Scotch Ale) and have more of what I'm looking for."
"Poured into a snifter glass a ruddy brown with an orange haze to it a thinner off white head atop.Earth and smoke show thru most in the nose along with some buttery caramel,a good mix of earthiness and peat and sweet caramel and fruit pretty nicely rounded.A good stab at a wee heavy decent complexities but it wont blow you mind."
"D - Don't know when this was retired, but it did lack a little in appearance. I guess I expected a little more overall, too."
"and girls"
"D - Pretty good. Lacks some depth of flavor, but a good beer."
"D - Thumbs down. Don't buy this. It may have been good at one point, but it's hard to tell now."
"It is served in a snifter and pours a deep chocolate hue with slight ruby highlights and a minimal off-white head. The nose is a combination of sweet malt, caramel, dark fruits, and more than a touch of alcohol with no hops to speak of. The flavor profile is very sweet, almost cloying, combining flavors of caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and toasted malt. The sweetness is really overdone for my liking here. It is medium bodied and almost a little chewy on the palate. The alcohol warmth on this is not well hidden and is what I would consider ""boozy," but the alcohol is quite high on this beer"
"Drinkably smooth, delicately rich in flavor and body, and subtle with a nice warming ascent. Pretty solid."
"D- A decent beer, not something that I would prefer over other dark horse offerings, but maybe I'll change my mind after some more wee heavy examples."
"A very flavorful and interesting brew. One of the best scottish ales I've had. Get this one. Very smooth, great caramel smokiness. High ABV is dangerously well hidden."
"Very drinkable for a 9.75ABV beer, Love it, The only thing I didn't like was the shockingly bad label, but I just won't look at it and put all of them in my fridge backwords."
"What a pleasant surprise. This was a great treat. Thank again to hoppymeal for this gem. Full bodied with perfect carbonation. I could drink this all night. A great beer."
"Dark, muddled scarlet red. Thin light brown head. Lacing is spotty and sporadic. Decent aroma. Pretty roasty and nutty for a Wee Heavy. But there's also notes of dampness and bread pudding on the nose. Body is light-medium and very lightly carbonated. This beer has a good flavor and with this mouthfeel, it flows across the palate pretty damn easy. (Almost feels like a cask ale out of a bottle.) A little bit of a dry, chalky aftertaste, but to me, it's appealing. The flavor doesn't carry over the roast and nuttiness from the nose....which is o.k. It's more of a peaty, smoky malt base with some juicy undertones of plum and raisin. Slightly lingering roasty bitterness. For 9.75% a/v, the alcohol is hidden quite nicely. It lingers a litte on the aftertaste as well, but is really not that noticeable during the drinking. Which is a bit of an accomplishment I think. Dark Horse is definitely a brewery to reckon with."
"Good scotch ale from a little brewery new to the Twin Cities - a little secret craft brewer among those in my crowd. Good malty brew, fruity with berries, cinnamon, chocolate, fig, prune, whisky, etc. Very nice fruity smell, delicious, dark burgundy color, nice a drinkable still."
"Medium bodied, long finish, toasted dark fruit, dry, and altogether...not bad. MAybe even good. A bit too boozy, though...I think. but a fine beverage nonetheless."
"Note: Am wondering why this ale appears in the retired category. Scotty Karate still appears on Dark Horses web site and is found in Michigan stores. Scotty K. also just won a Silver Metal at the GABF this past weekend  A BIG CONGRATS! to the Dark Horse crew. Scotty Karate would be missed if put to pasture."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy mahongy color, nice carbonation, little fizzy head which went away pretty quick, some tiny oil slicks left behind. The nose is malty, hoppy, spicy, oaky, and some caramel. The taste is very nice, malty/hoppy, slightly spicy/oaky tone, lots of caramel. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Full body, well-rounded brew. Very drinkable, a very tasty Scotch Ale. Always nice to have a Dark Horse brew in the house."
"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a subtle carbonation. Big maltiness that goes down smooth at the same time. Pretty easy to drink for a bigger beer. Overall, this just doesn't really wow me like I thought it might, but it's a solid brew overall."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a very thin offwhite head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful crystal and smoked malt scent along with a mild alcohol aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth and sweet crystal malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a light smokiness/alcohol feel. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This is a good beer. It just needs some more CO2. The appearance and mouthfeel suffer because of it."
"Pours a deep cherry brown with about a half finger of off-white head that dissolves quickly to a little film of bubbles. No lacing at all. Nose of strong toffee, light saltiness. Taste is similar; lots of strong, sweet, spicy molasses. Crazy toffee. The salty background shows up later, along with some light prunes followed by some light hoppiness in a solid aftertaste. Medium body with very light carbonation. Tastey beer, especially for dessert. Great sweetness. Almost cider-like. Not my favorite scotch, but not bad at all."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange/brown, thin off white head, settles to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots, some legs as well. Smell is very sweet and malty, toffee, raisiny, dark fruits, light alcohol, cherries, brown sugar, nice. Taste is spicy, raisins and toffee, lots of fruits, alcohol, nice and caramelized, smells better than it tastes, but still enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. I like my scotch ales a bit thicker than this. Thanks Lexx!"
"This beer pours a translucent orange color with a thick and fluffy white head that dissipates slowly. Spotty lacing. The aroma is grassy and yeasty, and a friend mentioned that it also smelled like an opened packet of ketchup which is 100% true. Light-bodied with flavors of apple and citrus, plus yeast and spices. The finish is tart and fruity with a lingering spice character. Refreshing and good all around."
"Hazy dark brown color with no head or lacing, but there was a ton of visible carbonation for a short while after the pour.. The smell is an unobtrusive sweet malt with a light, sort of barrel aged fragrance. The mouth feel is rather light bodied and lightly carbonated. There is a small footprint from alcohol, but the 9.75 ABV is a real sleeper. The flavor is sweeter and at first chocolate then dark fruit and caramel. I'm not getting much roasted malt until the finishing breath. A reasonable drinker; not at all what i was expecting."
"Cheers!"
"D- Just a great beer. I hope I can get my hands on some more of this before it is not to be found any more. It would also be interesting to see how this would be with more age on it. Not sure if it would just start to go down hill or if it could get even more rounded and complex (which would be hard to do)."
"A very vigorous pour gets only a skim of a quick fading tan head. Body is a ultra dark brown and when held to light it shows a little murky hue. Super sweet malty nose includes a tidal of dark ripe fruit notes, it comes almost cordial like. Silky sweet richness coats the entire mouth on the first sip. Drinkability is smooth and enjorable. This one may be slightly flat due to lack of carbonation. Mouthfeel shines with roasty malt. A very solid scotch ale overall."
"Drinkability is ok too one sided for me, and probably pricey too, but glad I got too try it. Want to thank merlin48 for this bottle."
"Originally reviewed April 5, 2007. 12 Oz Bottle. A very barleywine-esque aroma with intense, deep malt character in apple wine, special B, light pipe tobacco, raisins, cream, walnuts and some port-like fusels. Bright, alive and rich. Pours a ruddied pale brown, with a rim of creamy off-white. Flavor finds warmer ground in a field of sweet alcohols, figs, middle malts, including a bit of roast in a smoky wisp of coffee dredge and cocoa powder, adding some unique depth to the beer. Not thin bodied, nor heavy. A pretty nice body, actually, well balanced by the soothing roast edges and a lemon-pepper hop smack. Great caramelization and nice construction. A bit of yeast climbs in the backseat as we fade down a dusty road. Thanks Shaun! A quite fun Scotch Ale!"
"Overall, pretty good and true to style. A bit sweet for my tastes, but a nice change up. Sipper for sure. Alcohol incredibly well hidden."
"Slightly sticky and dry in the aftertaste, just ok. Carbonation is a touch high at first, but smoothes out as it sits in the glass for a bit. I've never had more than one at a time, but a hearty drinker sure could."
"drinkability is great. i wouldn't guess this was over 5% abv. well balanced and very enjoyable. thanks dave!"
"D - Alcohol seems more present than it should be in a beer of 9.75abv, making this at times seem like a weak whisky. Still, its an interesting beer that is tasty and enjoyable if the flavors hit your sweet spot."
"Pours a murky, dark caramel color. The head bubbles up relatively slowly to form a thin layer and then abruptly breaks up into nothingness. The nose is strong--unabashedly malty and sweet with alcohol clearly there as well. Dark, ripe fruit comes through too. The taste follows suit, with sweet malts quickly yielding some space to dark fruit and alcohol. The malts invoke a dark, whole grain roll. This one clings to the mouth and tongue but finishes with a surprising bit of crispness. Goes down dangerously easily."
"Aftertaste is slightly smokey and strong alcohol."
"Must have gotten a bad bottle. Picked this up at the brewery in March. No head and flat. Ruby red highlights that glows orange around the rim. Smells of dark chocolate with caramel. Very malty with a nice bitter finish that stings the tongue. I will try again and hopefully change my review."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a fat malty body. The beer is full bodied and very smooth. The beers carbonation is on the low side but not problematic. This is a very easy to drink beer. If you love a big malty beer treat you will love this beer. Unfortunately I found this beer at Kahns in Indianappolis. I will search in my neck of the woods for this beer."

"D: A very nice Scotch Ale. Just the right amount of sweet, spicy, and smoky. Very real and natural flavors. Sometimes the ""smoke"" in Scotch Ales, to me, tastes like a phony flavoring. This seems very real and subtle and is very enjoyable. Unfortunately, with this much alcohol, this is not sessionable. Although, the brewers at Dark Horse did a commendable job of burying the alcohol flavors and aromas."
"A light to medium brown Scotch Ale that pours with enough foam to create a quarter-inch beige head that falls to a collar of foam. This beer smells of a single malt with raisins, dates and alcohol. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a luxurious caramel malt flavor laced with a light bitterness that builds toward a surprisingly dry finish. Bitter roasted coffee with cream flavor. This beer picks a punch, so be careful!"
"Quite drinkable, although more than one of these rich malty treats would be a challenge. Definitely too big and rich to be session fare, but it makes a great sipper on a cold night in April. Will gladly drink more of this sweet malty treat."
"i don't care what a scotch ale is supposed to be. this is enjoyable beer. swampy thick brown liquid that looks like it should taste like a fudgesicle. strong boozey aromas laced with fruitiness and wood. red fruit, strawberries, wet soil, heavy malts, fermenting fruit salad (as opposed to canned cocktail). warming alcohol burn is present in the throat, much more so than i would guess from the flavors. drank two of these on an early spring night with Gruyère cheese, strawberries, and garlic-stuffed olives. no complaints here!"
"The drinkability is a bit off as this beer has a hard time going anyplace it is rather mondaine, does not stand out and make a stand. It kind of stands tall in the back and watches the action. MK"
"Mouthfeel is really hurt by the lack of a mid palate. If not for that and the alcohol burn this could hit the average mark in drinkability."
"What a beer! I have not liked offerings from Dark Horse overall, but this is quite the exception. It is like a cross between a Scotch heavy and an RIS - both styles I happen to like. But, it is different enough to say: wow! This is fun and different! So, if you like those rich heavy styles, definitely give this a try. If you are looking for another pale ale, well - look elsewhere."
"A beautiful hazy quite dark brown/red, with a small but dense beige head. Smells of sweet roasty malts, coffee, maple syrup, and bourbon. Taste is warm malts, brown sugar, toffee and alcohol. Maltiness lingers for awhile. Mouthfeel is good but slightly undercarbonated. Drinkability is good except for ABV."
"Appearance is a hazy red-brown with abundant white head. Aroma is a sour oakiness. Flavor to me is like a smoked butterscotch with a bit of sourness at the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky...the flavor of the beer lingers on the tongue quite awhile. Rather drinkable for this style."
"The body is very thick from the caramel malts. The carbonation is so soft on the palate it almost seems flat. It is also very warming, as one could imagine. It would be tough to drink more than one in a sitting, but it would make a nice pairing with a fine scotch."
"Interesting label art on the bottle, as pictured. Pours a hazed, dark caramel body with absolutely no head and just a wisp of lacing. Aroma is malty sweet with notes of brown sugar, toffee, and dark fruits. Hints of smoke and floral hops. Medium body with low carbonation. Taste is sweetish malts balanced by a slight floral hops bitterness. Some dark fruits add more sweetness. The alcohol is slightly warming. Has some characteristics of a Belgian dark ale but still an interesting and enjoyable take on the style."
"D- This beer has a smoke that is very well done and great malt depth. So often American Wee Heavys are tons of peat flavor that is nasty but this beer really has the perfect peat hint in the background to support the great malt flavors. This beer is still very drinkable."
"Overall a pretty good beer, as are most from Dark Horse. This one makes a nice nightcap."
"Into a pint glass, pours a dark unappealing brown, no head, then some, then none, with a sickly looking film on top, and bubbly ring. Looks like sludge, unfortunately. Aroma is highly sweet malts, dark fruits, plums and over-ripe apricots, some boubon maybe or some other liquer I can't distinguish. Taste is powerful, boubon, fruits, similar to aroma, but the mouth is kind of thinnish to medium, which doesn't mingle well with the noticably higher alcohol content. Its decently drinkable, but a bit quirky, as most Scotch Ales are for me I guess."
"Pours a murky orangish brown with basically no head, even a fierce swirling produces only a few loose bubbles. Aroma is burnt paper, peaty and smoky, a little rubbery with some fruity malts behind it. Sweet and slightly syrupy on the tongue, the sweet berry and sugary maltiness is at first dominant in the taste but then is taken over in the finish by a bit of the smokiness and a nice small prickly tingle on the tongue. A medium dry finish. Overall a nice easy drinker, rich but not too rich, I enjoy the lack of carbonation and the nice bit of smokiness."
"D: I don't know why I had in my head I was going to be head over heals in love with this beer. It was good but nothing like some of the top notch wee heavy's out there."
"Huge, chewy body, high alcohol and really big, but very drinkable."
"Pours a dark, rusty, caramelized plum skin. No real head to speak of. Has some coppery highlights with no bubbles. The aroma is awesomely malty and full of dark, toasted, fruits. The taste is a little more complex, bringing some caramel and moe specific fruits like , plums, prunes, and black cherries to round out the fruity malt. The alcohol mixes well with this malty obslaught. Could be better of a plain malt was detected than a just fruity malts. The palate is smooth and a little hot from the alcohol."
"D - I have had this one several times on tap and haven't been a big fan. It was very tasty from the bottle."
"Pours exceedingly thick, just short of black, with dark mahogany edges and a deep, deep brown center. Huge head of yellow cream that fades to a collar and a dusting across the top of the body. The nose is very solid for a scotch ale, with raisin fruits, nice spiciness, lots of sweet smells (sweet cream, brown sugar, caramel), some Maris Otter and just a touch of raw alcohol. In the mouth, though, this beer is heaven. Rich and thick and silky, the malts slide over the tongue while just enough carbonation backs it up and wakes up the palate. Sweet cream, caramel, pears flambee and fruitcake, with a long, sweet, nutty finish at the end. There's a slight burn of alcohol here, but for a beer this big and this good, who cares? This beer grabs you and holds on, tickling your tongue for a good 60 seconds between sips (I counted). This beer could take the chill off a Scottish winter. Hell, it could take the chill off a Antarctic winter."
"Drinkability/Overall: Drinkability is quite high for nearly 10% abv. A solid all-around wee heavy, no Lake Louie, but impressively tight."
"This was a very enjoyable. The alcohol is barely detectable and makes for a smooth, flavorful drinking Scotch Ale."
"Pours a very hazy murky brown color with some carbonation leading to a good, creamy tan head. Muted aromas of Caramel and sweet malts with hints of yeast. Disappointed at the subtlty of the aroma. Sweet caramel flavor with dark fruits and an extremely well balanced citrus hoppiness and roasted malts in the finish. Not an overly sweet Scottish with the hops balancing very well. This beer is so smooth to drink. The unexpected hoppiness leaves you wanting more."
"A worthy food pairer from Dark Horse. Recommended."
"another beer tried at the Great Lakes Brewfest. I was excited to try a dark horse beer that i hadn't had before. poured cloudy hazlenut brown color. smells peaty and smokey. taste is a big old smack of alcohol, wet peat, and scottish smokiness. Reminds me a lot of some good old single malt scotch. top notch...and they said to expect this year's line of bottles soon."
"Dark, slightly hazy amber brown body with a thick, long-lasting, khaki head. Rich, malty brown sugar mingles with rummy fruit, charred campfire logs, and spicy hops. Sweetish, toffee-heavy malt flavor is yummy. Roasted, toasted alcohol rolls into a bitter, biscuity, syrupy finish. Full-bodied with a warming glow. Very good."
"12 oz. bottle shipped to me from dirtylou in WI and cellared for a few months"
"Drinkability  This is a mouth-watering Scottish explosion that will surprise even those familiar with the style."
"A big beer as is tradition for Dark Horse. This is closer to a ""Double Scotch"" as it's so over the top for the style. The alcohol is a touch too aggressive and limits it's drinkability. Despite this, this is a very good brew but I'm not compelled to buy it again."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for this sample. This beer poured dark rich and thick and smelled and tasted like it looked. Big malt flavors with hints of chocolate covered fruit and a great alcohol burn. It took me an hour + to drink this and as it warmed it tasted like an old ale. I wouldnt call this a scotch ale but a nice hybrid of wee heavy, old ale and a bit of Belgian dark ale."
"Wish I'd have gotten more than one of these in trade."
"Body is a very dark brown color with a nice size light tan head. Nice rings of lace clumped around the glass as it was consumed. Plenty of ripe dark fruit sweetness with some alcohol hinting at the strength of it in the aroma. Light earthiness peaks through as well. More ripe fruits upfront in the flavor with a nice backing of earthy smoke. Light alcohol and caramel. Sweet fruit and smokiness on end. Pretty hefty body thats quite smooth. Goes down quite easy for a big brew. Very nice overall beer."
"Tasty malt. Plenty sweet / big caramel flavours. Light fruitiness (touch of plums). Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Off dry finish."
"drinkability: hindered by the over the top abv"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the murky red brew. Head quickly fades down to uneven swirly sections of small bubbles, with small amounts of bubbly lace here and there. Aroma is rich hearty sweet dark malt sweetness, heavy on the dark fruit, and prominent alcohol, yet not blow-torch booze levels. Taste is starts with light medium dark grain, hits with the dark fruits, cruises on to the plentiful warming alcohol, and then the aftertaste is the grain coming back and really opening up. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth over the tongue, and drinkability is nice in how this brew handles its abv in a responsible manner. Have to admit the appearance had me wondering, but this one is the winner I had hoped for."
"The taste certainly lives up to the aroma, it is thick and concentrated with sweet, though complex, malt notes all throughout. The beer finishes with a touch of alcohol that is only slightly hot, with a touch of astringency. This has a rich, pleasant, almost meaty malt quality to it that is typical of thick malty brews. It makes this almost a meal in a glass. This is a pretty nice beer, the only thing that mars it in the end is that it is a bit too hot and astringent in the finish."
"Mouthfeel is sugary with a light alcohol bite and oak running along the tongue. Very well balanced brew. No sign of that 9.75% abv."
"from the bottle. poured a nice garnet with a small off white head. aroma, fruity alcohol, brown sugar, caramel, if the bottle didnt say scotch ale I would of sworen it was a barleywine. flavor raisins, brown sugar, dark fruits, a nice kick of alcohol, malts at the finish with a hint of boitter sweet chocolate. good beer."
"Clear, deep ruby, almost purple colour. Short cap of tan foam that fell quickly, leaving behind a bit of lace. Light alcohol in the nose, along with a bit of apple and pear fruit, mild malt and toffee. Caramel apple up front, mild bitterness, with alcohol apparent in the finish. Plenty of toffee too. Full body, medium/low well-integrated carbonation, creamy texture. Quaffable, given the abv. Tasty and an interesting take on the style."
"Pours a very dark brown with red edges and substantial although shortlived head. Minimal lacing. Smell is very peaty, meaty, deep and raisiny. Taste is the smell and more, very very sweet, cloying even, though the warming tones that down substantially. A mountain of caramelized deep malts overload from the start as the peat and alcoholic spice battle to bring it in check the rest of the way through. Slightly piny hops, though very slight. I'd prefer a bit more, and less sweetness. Some white pepper through the peaty finish. Not bad. Mouthfeel is medium full with soft carbonation, but a definite sipper."
"I'd like to add that while I'm not an expert on this style by any means, This is one of the best of this style I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"This is a big beer in the malt department and sweet nectar from the gods for malt heads like myself. This is just about as balanced as an over the top IPA is for hops (Dark Horse crooked tree being a nice example). That being said there is a nice harmony within the malt flavors with the mild bitterness providing a counterpoint, whose absence would spell disaster for this brew. An amenable mix with my Scottish blood, but others may be a bit put off by the high (read heavenly) malty sweetness."
"A very good offering from Dark Horse. This one pours out to a copperish-red with a slight head. The aroma of fruit and light molasses hits the nose. The taste is rock solid and reminds me of an old ale. There is hints of bourbon, coupled with a light plum taste that gives way to a warming, yet hidden ABV. A great version of a Scottish Ale and one that is a bit different from others I have tried in this style."
"A really good Scotch Ale. Pours out to a frosted orange red color with a short head of foam that maintains a thin layer of bubbles over the beer. Some notes of lacing, and a medium level of carbonation. Sweet aromas of raspberry, hops, corn laced malts, caramel. Some herbal earth elements as well. Nice. Taste is medium to medium full bodied; buttery malts and sharp hops develop into a fruity, estery, butterscotch mix, with some herbs dancing about the tongue. Mouthfeels is medium bodied, kind of slick and buttery, with the alcohol making it's presence noted with a slight warming on the palate. Fair drinkability, as this is a sipper, and one will do just fine. Nevertheless, this a darn good beer, and one i'd like to have again. Worth seeking out and trying."
"Overall, this is a very nice beer. Full-bodied, sweet and complex. Would think it has to be a sipper at nearly 10 percent abv. But the smoothness and tasty balance make it pretty easy to drink. Another good effort by D.H."
"Gingerbread, rootbeer and dark rum aromas join maraschino cherry and bitter almond. The liquid is brown with minimal accumulation of foam on top. A big mouthful of chewy oatmeal cookie flavor and Malmsey spiked with grappa. Raisins, sweet brown spices. Hard, sooty bitter tannins close the fruit exhibition and allow alcohol flavors to dominate. I might consider serving this with campfire roasted nuts and Maytag blue cheese for a rustic, drunken soiree."
"D: Too boozy. The sample was enough."
"Drinkability is insanely good. hard to believe this is the adverstised 9+% ABV. I could drink this all day and enjoy every last drop."
"I was impressed at first, but after thinking about it, it could be much better. This is my first scotch ale - I'd like to try others for comparison's sake."
"Big full mouth with a wee bit of residual oil. This is a sipper. I could have two before moving on to something not so intense."
