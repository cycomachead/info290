"Big  bourbon flavors but it is an amazing complement to the taste. I picked up alot dark fruits, vanilla and cinnamon on the back end."

"Lots of whisky [Heaven Hill? )."

"Tons of Dark fruit, very little barrel.  I prefer the regular version to the BA variant."
"Straight caramel, vanilla, toasted oak and toffee. Getting a hint of cinnamon. Thick. A little bit one noted, but it was a delicious one note."

"Pours a dark brown color with lightly tan colored head. Bourbon, caramel, vanilla, oak, and some dark fruits on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with sweetness, and a bourbon warmth.  Very complex."

""
"Not a fan of this beer ."

"Really rich and smooth. Still though, I think I prefer Backwoods."

"O: Try to find this, its worth it. Or find it next year. A gentlemen's upgrade to the original Big Sound."
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this one; I thought it was great and one of the better scotch ales I've ever had. I like the base beer and this is an improvement. I love how much flavor there is and how good the bourbon is yet this is still drinkable and not hot at all...very impressive. Worth seeking out."

"Very tasting, second best vintage of Big Sound I have had."

"O – Yep it’s a hit in my book. Love the bourbon flavor and the mix of sweet. Do yourself a favor and let this one warm up. It’s worth the wait."

"bottle from a trade - you can tell from the first hit of the nose, immediately after taking the cap off, that it's outstanding. Thick toffee and dark fruit and caramel, and bourbon, vanilla, chocolate from the barrel. Strongly sweet on the back end. One of the better barrel aged beers out there. Another Cigar City success."
""
"O: this was a no-brainer - the Scotch ale's sugar character and fruit impressions are a natural setting for bourbon barrel aging - the vanilla and booze of the bourbon, plus the drying of the barrel vapors creates a decadent fruity array of aroma, flavor and feel."

"Bottle from Total Wine right near the brewery in Tampa. Pours dark brown color with a big khaki head on top. Big whiskey aromas, vanilla, caramel, molasses, oak. The bourbon is strong with this one. Big rich vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, molasses, bourbon is so smooth here. Lots of wood as well. Big and rich mouthfeel as usual from these guys, low plus carbonation, oh yeah. Another beautiful barrel aged beer from CCB. Yum."
""
""
""

"O- a very solid release from Cigar City."

"Bourbon Barrel Big Sound is bourbony, oaky, velvety smooth goodness. This is one of the first times I've had a BBA beer that actually tempers the sweetness of the base beer. Big Sound off the shelf is tasty, but runs a touch too sweet for me. Somehow this is better. The mouthfeel is outstanding here, it's got a medium-bodied, ridiculously velvety feel. Basically, BBA Big Sound is amazing."

"Bottle (2009 vintage drank in 2013): Poured a cloudy dark burgundy color ale with a small dark brown foamy head with light retention and some light lacing. Aroma of bourbon notes with light vanilla with a heavy malt base with quite a bit of residual sugars. Taste is also dominated by heavy caramel malt with quite bit of residual sugar with some medium bourbon notes with light vanilla notes. Body is full with medium carbonation and light warming alcohol notes. Drank very well for a four year old beer but ultimately this beer is a sipper and can’t be enjoyed in large quantities."
""
""
""
"Very good beer, and probably the only time I've called an 8.5% ABV beer a ""slow sipper", but it's eminently true here. I actually think it would benefit with some age, giving the bourbon a chance to mingle and settle in with the rest of the flavors and hopefully form a bond for the greater good. As it stands - still a great beer, just a bit hot at the moment."

"Cigar City has done a very good job with their barrel program. Nearly every beer they have chosen to age in barrels has emerged better than when it went in."
""
""
""
"Complex as hell, but palate fatigue falls on the mouth as I meander through a mere glass of the ale. It begs for a side accompaniment of tangy sharp cheddar, cheesecake, or a fragrant Churchill cigar for both reprieve and for completeness."

"I should've sat on this one for a while, a long while, booze popping up here and there is my only real complaint. I could smell this all day but I drank well before midnight, great stuff that will be even better down the road"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - There is a lot happening in this beer. The aroma is pretty incredible but the flavor, despite it's huge sweetness is a bit lacking. Perhaps that is due to the 6 month age it has on it. I haven't found a barrel aged CCB that hasn't impressed me yet though."

"O: A beer with loads of big flavors, the bourbon is in full force but still integrated with the base. Overall, this is a superb beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is cloudy brown with thin head. Smell is syrupy with notes of vanilla, maple, oak, and a touch of smokey malt. Taste is smooth and mellow with nice vanilla malts paired with sweet malts. A touch of smoke. Mouthfeel is heavy with light carbonation. Overall, nice integration of the barrel."
""
"Really an excellent beer. Very good."
""
""
"On-tap at Redlight Redlight. I am a huge fan of the regular Big Sound but the bourbon barrel aging puts it over the top. Fantastic brew! Big and malty with huge bourbon notes from the barrel aging. Overall, fantastic brew from CCB! I hope to see this beer again!"
"Overall. Probably the best I've had of the style."
""
""
"Thanks, donttazemebro, for the opportunity"
""
""
"Pours a clear super dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, roasted nuts, and slight bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a slight alcohol kick with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a solid barrel aged presence."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Fantastic beer. Will definately trade for more. I would consider this an entry level Scotch ale in that it is easy to drink, no booze and tons of flavor. Something special any new craft fan would love as would the vets."

"Overall: In the world of bourbon barrel-aged scotch ales, this is probably the best I've had- compared to Backwoods Bastard which is probably the most popular example of the style, this is quite a bit more complex and smooth. I really love the maple syrup-like sweetness combined with the barrel character, although I'm more of a BA stout fan. I felt reluctant to trade away my last bottle, but once I did, I felt it was time to write this review. Wonderful BA scotch ale that I hope to have the chance to drink again in the future. (4)"

"Overall: probably the best bourbon barrel Scotch ale that I have ever drank. cant think of anything that even comes close. Really nice job CCB!"

"Close to a booze bomb, just sweet and alcohol filled. I liked it but it was just about one dimensional. You da man egrace84."

"Burr, winter nights call for winter beers. Big Sound scotch ale fits the bill. Indeed this does look like coca cola as another reviewer pointed out. Nice looking tan head but it fades away real fast. Tawny brown with reddish highlights. Not the prettiest beer. Yup, toasty oak, vanilla, bourbon, bready and toffee. At first there is an off putting aroma but it fades. My first impression of flavor is a cross between vanilla and chocolateyness. Lovely toffee flavors and caramalized figgy goodness. Raisins, slight bit of cinnamon and more of that nice bourbon barrel goodness. Is this beer slightly thin? I feel like it might be. And there is a bit of an aftertaste that lingers with a bit of a tin like quality. This and the otherwise underwhelming apperance are the only real drawbacks of this otherwise very tasty, tasty cold weather sipper."
"Overall- Very easy drinking for a barrel aged beer, but still keeps all the flavors. My only gripe is that the base beer is somewhat lost in the barrel aging. Still very impressed!"
""
""
"m: thick, creamy, and smooth with a big booziness. good carbonation, hefty on the palate. definitely a sipper but a pleasant one."
""
""
"Poured a dark brownish amber, opaque, with a small creamy tan head that retained as a thick ringlet and left soapy lacing on the glass. Nice aroma, sweet with dark sugars, vanilla, bourbon-soaked wood. Though it's a different style, this conjured memories of Mother of All Storms and King Henry. The taste reflected the aroma, all the toffee, brown sugar and caramel goodness, vanilla, smooth bourbon, subtle oak, notes of raisin, fig, papaya, and a dash of cocoa. Great. Heavy-medium body, meh, might as well call it full-bodied, smooth and creamy, chewy with not too much of a boozy bite to it. A good sipper. So glad this was in bottles when I was down there."
"Overall: This is a good strong ale definitely not for the weak of heart... or palette. Sip this one."
""
"o - overall, a very nice barrel aged scotch ale. on the boozy side, but it works. the barrels impart nice chocolate notes along with the bourbon and the wood. there is no mistaking this as a barrel aged brew. VERY enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely lots of bourbon, booze, and sweetness, but the flavors go very well together. And it just oozes typical CCB flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good. The barrel is nice, but the beer could use more... something. It's a boatload of caramel and some Bourbon."
"T - Great stuff, makes Founders Backwoods Bastard seem like a bastardized version. Would unquestionably revisit."
"OVERALL: A bit of an improvement on the original, as the barrel adds complexity to the base beer instead of dominating it, but at the same time, it's not quite as bold as I'd hoped and the palate could be a little creamier. I never had this beer fresh, but if I had to wager a guess, I would say that this has held up alright. However, I can imagine it was better fresh, and it is a 8.5% beer, so if you're holding onto one of these, you might think about doing something with it while it's still decently enjoyable. Cheers again for the trade boatshoes!"

"O: Truly an excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"O: Great fucking beer. I want more. Thanks Dave! 4.5/5"
""
"This is aging nicely, but I think it has another 6 months to a year left...I have one bottle left so I'll report back next time I visit this one. Right now, drinking great, lots of sweetness and the booze is slightly hot. Recommend."
"Drinkability - Very good, the best beer I had on this particular day at Brick store, next to the barrel aged Ten fiddy."
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. The aroma has some cedar notes, but what really comes through is the roasted malt and bourbon. I also get a hint of menthol in the aroma. The flavor is similar. The cedar is once again present, but it takes a back seat to the heavy oak, vanilla and maple notes. There is also a big whiskey character to the flavor, as well as some roasted malt and quite a bit of chocolate. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
"Medium bodied with a strong barrel character that adds another layer of flavor to the base beer.  Some dry oak along with silky vanilla, toasted coconut and a delicious spicy bourbon character.  Although the barrel flavors are strong, they are perfectly integrated into the flavor without overpowering the base beer.   Lots of excellent bourbon flavor but barely any heat making it deceptively drinkable.  Underneath the barrel, there is a nice combination of sweet and roasted malt notes.  Slightly smokey with hints of dark chocolate, toffee, caramel and oatmeal lingering into a somewhat dry finish.  Highly recommended!"

"A massive thanks goes out to bross242 for bringing this one out during cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Served from bottle into a Cigar City snifter. Poured dark brown with a minimal tan head that subsided to basically none quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really put back by the aroma on this one as it was really well balanced and intense. I wish this would have carried over to the flavor, but the flavor was still quite good though. Definitely glad I got the chance to try this one and I suggest you do the same."
""
"Overall: An awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- This was a good beer. Layered, sweet, sticky and lots of bourbon and vanilla come out as well."
""
""
""
"The booziness dragged this down a bit for me but pretty awesome nonetheless, lots of good flavors here."
"Awesome scotch ale with a nice mellow and flavorful whiskey oak feel, drinks very well smooth, awesome balance of style flavors."
"Big bourbon and oak backed up by a malty sweetness. Buttery. Tobacco leaves and a little bit of a smokey pork flavor. This is a pretty decadent beer."
""
""
"Overall-- quite damn sold. Easily my top scotch ale."
"This beer pours a full bodied syrupy stained wood brown in color with an off white lacing. The nose is beautiful. It features a good amount of sweet bourbon barrel, vanilla, oak, and a ton of coconut. The flavors follow the same lines. It features a lot of coconut, vanilla, bourbon, molasses, and rich smooth malts. The flavor is superb. It drinks full in body and is really smooth. I really, really like this one. It's a nice example how barrel aging can add a lot or complexity to an already great beer. Imagine a bourbon barrel aged Mounds candy bar."
"Pours black with brown edges and a thin khaki head that settles to a very slight haze and bubbly ring. HUGE bourbon aromas pour from the glass, followed by sweet malt, caramel, and a touch of chocolate. One of the most Bourbon-forward brews I've seen in a while. Taste is similarly Bourbon-heavy, lots of caramel, oak, and vanilla mingle with dark dried fruits, malt, and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium-full body and low carbonation. Overall an excellent Barrel-Aged offering from CCB, I needed something positive after the travesty that was the Rum Barrel-Aged Big Sound. Blegh."
"O: Very nice beer. I'm not a huge fan of Scotch Ales, but it's hard to turn down the chance to try something in a barrel. I'm glad I got the chance. This beer is solid, and a good runner up for best BA Scotch Ale, after Founder's Backwoods Bastard."
""
""
""
"D - This is quite good - I tend not to like Scotch Ales due to overwhelming sweetness, but this one has a nice balance of bourbon barrel and malt flavors. Very glad I managed to get this one over the rum version (which is what I initially wanted). Highly recommended if you're into this style."
""
""
"Overall, this was a great beer. Very well done. Very easy to drink. I could have a lot of this one."
"Clear winner of our horizontal tasting, thanks Tom. Big brown coloured beer. The bourbon is there in the aroma and the taste and dominant, but it was well done. Fuller mouthfeel, caramel, . Woody, characteristics of Coconut and vanilla, a sipper in drinkability.Some smoke, good for the style."
""
"The beer pours a dark, tarry color with a thin tan head that settles quickly without lacing, but leaves spots of dark sediment at the bottom. The nose is dominating bourbony/malty sweetness, a slightly metallic ethanol, and subtle vanilla. The taste is slightly fruity with caramel sweetness that's quickly followed by a generous helping of woody barrel and ethanol. The mouthfeel is viscous, but not chewy sweet, lightly carbonated, has hinting alcohol, and a great barrel presence that unfortunately overtakes much of the scotch ale. This is really a great beer, only criticism is that the base beer is overpowered."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm really glad I was able to try this beer. The bourbon went really well with the other flavors from the beer. I would definitely have another if given the chance."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brownish-amber color with a finger of off-white head. A nice bourbon and vanilla note to it on top of the rich caramel and toffee malt smells. The flavor is quite similar. Heavy bourbon, vanilla, and wood with a strong caramel malt flavor and some brown sugar. Medium bodied with medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice beer and very unique."

"A wonderful treat, and I'm so glad at the opportunity to try this one."
"Drinkability: Goes down fairly easy for the style."
"BA Hunahpu release day!!! Just a great beer, Big Sound is one of my favorites from CCB and adding bourbon just makes it better. The nose is full of bourbon. The taste of caramel sweetness mixed with bourbon flows so beautifully in my mouth. This beer and a redheaded girl would be a great time!!!"
"I am becoming a bigger fan of CCB every time I try a new beer. They have an excellent IPA but where they shine is malty beers. IMO they are a top 5 brewery for malt leaning beers and I'm ecstatic to live to close by. I'm also discovering more and more I appreciate the nuances in delicious malt beers than hop charged beers thanks to them. These are some of the most complex beers on earth without being sweet, cloying hop bombs."
"O: another quality offering from CCB, this is a smooth and drinkable strong beer that presents several qualities that stand out.l"
"ich dark brown color coming forward right away. Nearly opaque with a small head of tan creeping up the sides throughout the session but eventually falling back down to earth. The aroma was wonderful with rich caramel and toffee notes that just exploded in the air. Hints of apricot and other light fruits bouncing around as well. Really the best flavor I could have imagined coming out of this one. Rich caramel and toffee flavors, hints of vanilla, pears and light tart flavors bouncing aorund. No alcohol at all, , it does not drink anywhere near this kind of strentght. Smooth, perfect carbonation with a drinkability that was off the charts. I just dont know what else I can say about this beer"
"Overall: While I wish this one was a bit more complex, it's very smooth. The main flavors meld together seamlessly. Mild, manageable alcoholic burn. Classy."
"Relatively thick bodied, this was a serious bruiser of a beer start to finish. Excellent."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, medium bodied, boozy, with sticky, syrupy sweetness."
"My first taste of a barrel-aged Cigar City brew, & it's excellent. In all honesty, I prefer the non-BA version - but that was so good, it's like I'm complaining about the use of lighting in the Mona Lisa. Wonderful brew. If readily available, this & the non-BA version would be go-to beers in my fridge every night."
"This is a step up from the regular Big Sound for me as the bourbon brings an extra complexity to the taste without being the dominant component. Very nice."
"D: Pretty good actually. Not the best barrel aged CCB brew, but the barrel did improve an already solid base brew!"
