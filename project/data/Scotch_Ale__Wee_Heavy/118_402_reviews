"My first Scotch Ale. Like a tripel with less alcohol heat. Well balanced and surprisingly light mouth feel."
"Very enjoyable wee heavy, maybe my favorite now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep copper color. Thin creamy lace that persists. Mild fruit smell. Up front taste is a moderate fruit/date flavor followed by a tinge of caramel. Complex indeed. I like scotch ales and this is perhaps my favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance - pours amber/ copper with small head, slight carbonation was foggy when poured however became increasingly clear once it warmed up. Aroma - Earthy aroma. Taste - all I can taste is the fig. Feel - has a warmth to it that I do appreciate, quite smooth, has astringent elements to it. Overall - appearance and taste do put me off, not a beer that I would drink again, however I think it is more a case of me not appreciating the beer style than the actual beer. Brewer appears interesting and I would try other products."
""
"Overall - Excellent beer and one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in a while.  Definitely recommended.  4.5 paws."

"Reddish-brown pour with minimal head. Looks almost syrapy. Appearance is it’s only low-point. The smell is from heaven - malty and fruity. Flavors are strong malt sweetness with some slight wine notes. Incredibly smooth, and way too drinkable. This one could get me in trouble."
"It is sweet with a flavor that is a mix of molasses and raisins and figs."
""
"O - Very tasty beer. Lots of sweet malty flavors make this a rich and pleasant drinker."
""

"This one absolutely lives up to it's reputation for me.  Almost missed it at the store, just happened to notice a couple 4 packs collecting dust on a bottom shelf.  Skull Splitter pours a hazy amber with a smooth head, the lacing is quite appealing with tiny distinct bubbles and falls away quickly.  The nose is unmistakably dark, sugared fruits - plum and fig and perhaps the best part if this beer, although the taste is delectable.  Smooth, sweet malts and a warm boozy finish.  It begs to be drank and I concede.  I find this beer quite enjoyable cold.  My first Wee Heavy and I'm officially in love.  Happy Valentine's Day!"
"Overall - Very enjoyable. Drinks like a session ale. The flavor had complexity but overall it didn't have that mouthwatering appeal. Very good beer though, would recommend."
""
"O: Great drink, just give it some time to warm up."
""
"Draft pour into 12oz tulip; dark Amber with off white head; medium mouthfeel; sugary scotch flavors coats the tongue; minimal alcohol on exhale(nice); sugar beet and ""whiskey"" finish; very good for style."
""
""
"O: This is a MUST-TRY for any lover of deep, complex, malty ales. I'll be buying this one again and having that 500 ml bottle all to myself."

"Pours a clear mahogany with a thin tan head. Bright caramel malt aroma with a small raisin background. No hop nose. Beautifully malty brew. Clean upfront caramel malt with some raisin. low hop bitterness. a slight tinge of alcohol warmth. Medium body and smooth. Finishes semi-sweet. Love this beer. Fine example of a scotch ale."

"Decent but not as good as it's rated on here."

"Overall impeccable, really. All of the qualities work very well together, especially the well-structured and judicious flavors and the carefully attenuated carbonation and carbonic crispness. The flavor and aroma are consistently complex and expressive without being overwhelming."

"     I'll give Skull Splitter - Orkney Brewery a 4.75 overall. This will split your skull with a Nordic buzz that is comfortable and still sociable. SKALL !!!!!!!!"

"O: A glorious wee heavy, and one I return to frequently. For a devout malthead, this beer is a dance of triumph along the tongue."

"This beer is quite mellow and delicious overall, despite the fact that it's probably past its prime (the seller shall remain anonymous, except to me of course).  Despite the rather horrid appearance, this is probably the best Scotch ale I've tried so far.  Maybe the extra aging helped it.  Awesome label art, by the way, with a cool (if historically inaccurate) Norse chieftain/king on the label."

"A perfect example of the style. Rich, malty, and complex, with darker fruit notes, and hints of peat. Slick, slightly oily mouthfeel, and a creamy, lingering head. Dangerously drinkable, and insanely well done. (I'm on vacation, so this is a half-assed review.) Cheers!!!"

"Had this while eating muscles in garlic sauce.  First mouthful gives the impression of cough mixture, but this soon dissipates to a smooth drink.  Pours lovely from the bottle with a nice colour to it.  Enjoyed the experience but don't think I'll be adding it to my regular list"

"I first had this in a restaurant in Kirkwall, before I knew what a wee heavy was. Then I didn’t particularly care for it. Now, however, I find it to be a delightful drink with the alcohol well hidden. This meets the criteria for a Scotch ale very well."

"BBE April 16. Pours a clear amber with a deep dark ruby hue. Good head with limited lacing and retention. Nose of dark fruit (figs, dates), and caramel over a scotch like alcohol background. Full bodied with a rich and creamy texture. Low carbonation level. Tremendous flavor profile that is complex and balanced. It begins with a scotch like note that flows into the dark fruits. In the middle caramel is predominate as the scotch fades. The finish hints of the previous dark fruits and caramel which fade into a nice alcohol tingle that lingers. An Outstanding Wee Heavy that is alcohol focused."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I think this is a nice example for the style, as it has zero off flavors and a nice punch in the way of flavor and alc. Worth the buy if you can find. 4.0 across the board."

"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/8/2012. Pours fairly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, fig, plum, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, raisin, fig, plum, toast, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice scotch ale. All around good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Just tried this beer last night at really cool bar that had a ""twin peeks"" look (velvet wallpaper, red curtains, animal heads on the wall and very dark) With a name like Skull Splitter I just had to try it. Amazing taste and almost instant buzz. So good I ordered 3 more. If you like dark beer but don't like how it sets heavy in the gut. This beer will impress you, because it has the rich dark flavor but without the bloat. I am giving this beer a perfect 5 because so far it is the best dark beer I have ever had."
"Certainly the name and history sell this beer but it stands on its own as a colorful and interesting character."

"Has a very good taste. You can taste the molasses and dried fruits in it. With a smooth aftertaste of spices. It Smells rich in figs and spices but blends together nicely with the hops and maltiness. Looks dark brown, clean, and has a nice head to it."
"Overall nothing is overdone or outshines the other. A staple to what the wee heavy style is. This ones a keeper and one ill recommend to people interested in the style"

"O: Easier to drink than a lot of other beers in this style because of the lighter mouthfeel and not so cloying sweetness. This is a very nice example of the style and one I really enjoy with exceptionally well hidden alcohol."
"O- The benchmark of the style, and I can see why."
"This beer is definitely a sipper – a few of these and one would likely understand where this beer gets its name."

"Highly recommend ---- J"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Skull Splitter poured a clear, dark red-hued copper colour, with distinct ruby highlights and some orange around the edges when backlit. Pouring produced a thin, off-white head that quickly faded to an even thinner ring of foam around the glass, leaving almost no spotting or lacing behind it. Its aroma was primarily of dark fruits and alcohol, with the taste dominated by sweet malts, dark cherries and alcohol. The alcohol gives off some slight heat in the taste, but not enough to overpower the other flavours. Skull Splitter had a moderate bitterness in the finish that countered the initial sweetness of the malts and dark cherries well. I would describe the beer as surprisingly light bodied given its alcohol content, with a distinctly low level of carbonation. Overall, Skull Splitter is flavourful, quite well balanced, and well suited to consumption on a -10C night. At $3.30 per 330 ml bottle, Skull Splitter is perhaps a bit on the pricey side, but not outrageously so. I would certainly drink this beer again."

"This was worthy of this spectacular Spring day, enjoyed canal side and followed by a long walk in the crisp air while the sun warmed our faces."

"o; Can easily imgine myself sitting in a Scottish pub along the north coast and sipping this with a meat pie while the sun refuses to set at 10 P.M. Not so skull splitting so far, but 17 ounces at 8.5 ABV will kick in soon enough I'm sure. In the meantime I'm soberly enjoying this sweet treat. It would surely be one of my favorite regulars if it was not $6 a bottle."
""
""
""
"Overall- I can see how this could be enjoyable to some but it just doesn't work for me, especially compared to the many good Scotch ales out there. Just above average. Worth a try if you understand that it has a lot of candy notes to it. But if you are expecting a more traditional Scotch ale, I would pass."
""
""
"I could drink this all day, sitting and enjoying a Scottish style view"
""
"Overall this was a pleasant beer. The high alcohol content should be noted. Don't plan on drinking more than one!"
""
""
"O: This is not a fast drinking beer, and definitely not one you drink more than one of in a session. It is warming; good for a cold winter night. I rated it on the basis of the characteristics, but this is probably never going to be a favorite."
"Overall a disappointment. Looking forward to when my own scotch ale matures up in about 2-5 weeks. Hopefully that will scratch my scotch ale itch"

"O- Haven't had many commercial examples of Scotch Ale (maybe 4?) but this is definitely my favorite. A nice change of pace to visit this in the american landscape of hoppy beers all over."

"You could sit and sip this beer all day. Smooth, engaging with a fullish mouthfeel that finishes dry and with a lingering malty sweetness."

"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a beer that is lightly foamy (2/5) and otherwise smooth (3/5) on the palate. Ethanol is extremely well-hidden, with only a hint of heat in the nostrils and burn on the tongue and throat. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
"Pours a pretty brown amber in color with a small 1/2+ finger creamy off white head. Lacing formed rings around the glass when sipped actually. The aroma is of sweet caramel, dark fruits with a hint of chocolate and oak. The taste is even better! Wow! Very pleasant and goes down easy. Lots of great flavors coming through. Perfect carbonation. NO harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Quite surprised on this one! Overall, I would drink this one over and over again. Very tasty and first time I had this type!"
""
""
"I like this for my first foray into a Scotch Ale / Wee heavies. I found it to be flavorful and boozy, but the head doesn't last as long as I'd have liked and it's by no means creamy as some reviewers stated, but perhaps it's because it's from a bottle? A nice cold-weather sipping ale, would be wonderful with a bowl of chili and cornbread or a Sunday roast beef dinner. I could see this at table replacing a bottle of Merlot, as it has a depth and character that would carry quite well with a hearty and seasoned meal. By itself it's also fine, but I think it'd be better with food. The label graphics and where it's brewed drew me to try it. I would definitely buy it again as I enjoy a rich, low-hops, flavorful ale."

"Let me paint you a picture. Silence all around you. You sit down after a long day of work, you pop one of these open, and before you finish that first swallow, all you hear in your head are the opening chords to Led Zeppelin's ""Rock n Roll."" And I am pretty sure that's what the Viking on the bottle intended. Its not too dark, its not too bitter, and yet it doesn't totally abandon those characteristics either. Its a solid choice for any beer drinking purpose whether that be food accompaniment, thirst, social outing, or relaxation. Skull Splitter is a take you away from every day monotony kind of beer. This beer lets you know its quitting time, so if you have one on your lunch break…ummm…you should probably take a half day and not go back to work. Imagine the Vikings celebrating after a conquest with this beer. You have your own celebrations to commemorate, and this will pair nicely with them."

"A decent tasting wee heavy yet comes across rather weak overall. Sure, there's the malts flavors and a fair enough presence of alcohol warmth, yet the beer seems rather watered down and lacking in character and depth for a Scotch ale. Certainly not bad overall, but I can't imagine why a beer with such a great name doesn't quite live up to its bold, brutish name."
""
""
"A great tasting, easy drinking wee heavy. I've got to get this beer more often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A perfect scotch ale that doesn't exaggerate with the malts and instead really focuses on the balance between alcohol and rich fruitiness. Really great."
""
"I really looked forward to trying Skull Splitter as I really enjoy Scotch Ales. It had a wonderful appearance in my crystal beer mug with a beautiful tan head over a beautiful brownish nutty appearance. It tasted very good with fruity undertones, it could have used a little more bitter for my tastes as something seemed missing. It was a very good beer that I would buy again though."
""

""
""
""

"Doing a full review of one of my favorite beers and a regular in my rotation. Excellent looking beer that smells great. I tend to like a murkier beer but still tasty looking. Wonderful taste, one of the best scottish ales out there. Wonderful, easy to drink for the alcohol content. This is a must try."

"On the whole, Skull Splitter is a chimaera, a complex and fascinating brew that makes me reconsider what I thought I knew about Scotch ales. It's sweet, fruity, warm, light, and spicy to varying degrees at varying moments, but always engaging. In spite of it's initially confounding originality, renewed acquaintance reveals it to be an enjoyable adventure for your taste buds that ceases much sooner than one might expect for a beer of its gravity."

"This beer smells a lot like wine. It gives off a strong fruity aroma. The taste reminds me of apples or grapes. It's a little boozy, the alcohol taste could be covered up a little better. The aftertaste is OK. It finishes a lot like wine, with a light bubbly burn on the tongue. It's not bad but I don't think I'm going to buy it again."
""
"overall a very good beer - loved having with my dinner on a chilly fall evening, would definitely have again. would suggest for anyone who likes dark, complex, flavorful beers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer is one to sip on around a fire with your sweetie, I feel. It is warming and toasted, which bring on memories of mild fall days raking leaves. The caramel and toffee notes actually stuck around on the pallet for a really smooth after taste, which I much appreciated. The beer itself was much lighter than i expected it to be."

""

"Overall: definitely worth the while, but surely only one every now and then, or a 4-pack at most (at the price of AU$140+ per case of 24 x 330mL). A great Scottish Ale led by some flavoursome malt and toffee instead of being overly hopped. Works well."

"Much better than the one I had a decade ago. Still a sipper, but it comes in a small European bottle so it won't do too much damage. Tastes nothing like other Scotch ales I've had, presents more like a Belgian, and that's a good thing."

"A big, malty beer, with lots of caramel and sweetness. Very different from the other Scotch Ales I've had--a bit more in your faces. And why not considering the name? But still, while others are a bit more subtle, this provides a bold taste keeps you enticed and wanting more. Very tasty and glad I tried this."
"Found this overly sweet with tons of caramel brown sugar dextrose but still some nice hop character coming through. It holds the alcohol strength really well but I was expecting a bit more from this, tasty and full bodied though, I have a bottle so will have to do a reappraisal soon. On the second time I still find the caramel and slight boozey sweetness to be a bit overbearing, it does have a lot of complexity and is a very good beer but Im left wanting more bitterness and crispness on the end feel."
""

"in many ways the quintessential scotch ale, although not my favorite one out there. it pours a syrupy dark bock color, dense, with a small off white head showing very little carbonation. the nose is peaty but not smoky like some tend to be. its alcohol is obvious, and its sweet grain is saturated with a toasted aroma and a very earthy vibe. no hops to speak of. the taste is like birch syrup or something lighter and a little less sweet than maple. the texture is like that too. earthy, right from the soil sort of autumn compost heaviness really challenges me in warmer weather, but I am imagining a cold snowy night in front of a fire, a much more enjoyable setting for this brew. I love the grain features, complex and rich. the feels is odd, but I like it. its thick, almost sticky in my mouth, lacking carbonation. American scotch ales have bastardized this intentional weight with high carbonation gimmicks and lighter grain bills, but this feels more authentic, although very heavy and hard to drink a whole bottle. it improves as it warms, and just takes me to the dead of winter. its a nice beer, but not the first scotch ale I would reach for, even though its authenticity is appreciated."
"O: A nice and complex Wee Heavy. The high ABV adds to the complexity."

"Great full bodied Scotch Ale, travels well from Scotland because of the high alcohol. Deep rich color with some red hues. Malty, sweet and strong. Very satisfying. Pairs well with a good steak. No hop aroma or flavor but there really shouldnt be ny in this beer. If you are looking for a smokey scotch ale well then this isn't it. It is clean and refreshing."
""
"Overall: There's a reason I hold Skull Splitter above the many other scotch ales I've had, and that's because I'm biased. But why, you scream and point accusingly? Because it's simply everything you'd want in a beer of its kind (strong caramelised taste, decent strength, consistent body) plus more. Open a bottle, take a sip and split your skull. Split it beyond the point of repair. You won't regret it."

"O- The initial notes and flavors of this one are good. The only thing that didn't sit well was the aftertaste it left. Kind of a bitter alcohol woody taste that just didn't work. The rest of it was delicious."

"Pours a cloudy, medium brown with a small, but creamy, tan colored head that shrinks quickly and leaves a moderate amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is faint, but sweet and fruity with floral hops. First sip is surprisingly hoppy right from the start with an even more bitter aftertaste with a distinct sour note; much like the sour of some Belgian Dubbels. Purposely cupping the glass in my hands to warm it some, the malt flavors are coming through. Raisins and tart cherry flavors with a hint of molasses. Still a long-lasting bitter aftertaste and the sour note is still present, but less pronounced. Definitely getting better as it warms up. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a little more carbonation than I like, but not bad. A bit dry. Not the best I’ve had of this style, but a good Scotch ale I’ve had before and will buy again."

"Overall, I would have to agree with many reviews in saying that this is world class. I'm no expert but I would think this almost a 5 out of 5. The only issue that I have with it is that the alcohol is pretty noticeable in the aroma and taste, but it is not detracting from the beer at all as the dark fruits are carried along with it like a chocolate cordial."
""
"doesn't push the envelope of flavor, but what it does, it does it well. wasn't not expecting it, but tends to finish with a subtle cherry flourish, could be a nice one to bring to a group without shocking the non-beer enthusiasts."
"A worthy beer, but not what I was expecting at all."

"Deep ruby red colour, ring of white head, no real lace to speak of really. Smell is sweet and malty, fruity with lots of cherry notes and even a bit of strawberry/berry as well, caramel, a little alcohol smells a bit like a barley wine meets strong ale. Taste is sweet and quite fruity, apple, cherry and berries, malty with some caramel flavours, some darker fruits mid palate, sweet in the finish with a slight alcohol burn, fruity aftertaste. Medium carbonation, chewy and medium-full body, felt at times the carbonation here was a touch high. A solid beer, quite flavourful though not all that complex, drinkable but probably something I'm not going to seek out again, glad to have had it once though."
""
""
""
"It's a good dark brown amber with a etched surface and some loose rim foam. Smells like butter, apple skin, a little bit of malt, some skunk (this died off as the beer warmed); really sad nose. Flavor is malt, rye, tomato, sweet hawaiian bread rolls, some astringency and on the breath after the swallow: booze and butter. Medium bodied and tight moderate alcohol. Profoundly unimpressed with this brew."
""
""
""
"This is what I remember Skull Splitter tasting like. I wish it wasn't so expensive, because this is a beer I could see myself enjoying all night long. They also don't make bombers of this, but if they did, it would be a bomber that you could spend an entire night with! The bottle says, ""500 years in the making."" Job well done, Orkeny!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very nice beer, and the 8.5% ABV perfectly meshes with the fruits and sugars to create a sweet, alcoholic goodness. The beer as a whole is very sweet, but there’s just enough of grains and hops in here to keep it from becoming cloying."
"A very nice bottle of beer."

"O: No complaints. A good time. A great bottle. Fantastic name. What more could you want?"
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of deep caramelized malt with lightly sweet undertones and light toffee notes. Taste is also a mix between some caramelized malt notes with some toffee notes and a dry aftertaste. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed and quite enjoyable though overall dryer then I had expected."
""
""
""
"Deep copper. Small and short-lived beige head, decent lace. Sharp, boozy aroma with light raisin and toffee notes. Tastes mildly sweet with notes of caramel, raisin, and dried cherry. Mild bitterness in the finish. It's boozy, and I find that unpleasant without some strong flavours to balance things out. Light-bodied with low carbonation. It feels thin, and I think it contributes to the alcohol coming across harshly. I didn't enjoy this beer."
"It pours a clear crimson with a tan head. Head retention is good, and the lacing is very nice. Aromas of malt and grape, along with alcohol, are all present. The taste is very much like red wine.IT gives some good malt flavor up front. After that It's fruity and acidic, but there is a slight bitterness throughout. It leaves a dry feeling in the mouth. The mouthfeel is moderate, and the carbonation is low. I really can't get past the acidity in this one. Not my style of beer at all."
"O – Crazy brew. A lot going on, maybe too complex and trying too hard."

"Bottom Line: Never had it? buy it! it's worth the jingle."
""
""
""
"Overall: in the end, smooth, spiced toffee and rich dark fruit with a mild sense of heat prevails (almost like spiced rum), making for a great winter beer that isn't heavy; love the interplay and transition of flavours from first sip to last (don't give up on it)"
""
"Burgundy with a tan head. Film of retention with light lace. Nose has grapes, caramel, candy and a very nice beautiful malt character all around. Taste has some complex malt notes, sweeter caramels and toasty grains. Moderate bitterness. Alcohol is prevalent, and almost takes away from this a bit. Lower carbonation, this one warms the bones."
""
""
""
"Did not enjoy. Another reviewer put it well -- ""wears its ABV on its sleeve"". Probably would have split my skull but I didn't finish it -- thin mouthfeel, bitterness unbalanced by body -- not nearly as rich or warm as I was expecting from a strong beer. Have never had a Scotch Ale before so maybe I just don't care for the style."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I guess with a name like Skull Splitter, I should have expected a beer that drinks like an axe to the head. I guess this beer is for more adventurous tastes as unlike Belgians who tend to hide their high alcohol content, this beer seems to want to be blatantly upfront about it."
""
"Overall, pretty good."
"O - Overall, this was an odd Scotch Ale. More of a Belgian Strong than a Scotch Ale in my opinion. Regardless, I'd have another."
""
"It smells better than almost any other beer I have ever tried for starters. For a beer that is 8.5% it goes down very well and although it’s not a beer you could drink more than two of I can see myself picking this up every now and again when I can."
"A masterly demonstration of Scottish brewing. Smooth, with a full-bodied character that warms you right through. Plenty of sweet fruit in the aroma and flavour, along with a hefty slug of booze. The only minor let-downs are the absence of live yeast and a slightly sub-par body. I think bottle conditioning would allow for an interesting flavour evolution. Nonetheless, this is a top-notch wee heavy that is well worth sampling. Grab one and stash it away for a rainy day."
""
"Pours a deep amber color with brown tints, slightly hazy. About a one-finger eggshell white head that dissipates quickly and leaves on a smattering of lacing.Very earthy and malt forward aroma. The malt presents both a sweet caramel and bread-like characteristic. Only the slightest note of hops.The flavor is very rich and malty, as expected. The dense malt flavors are accompanied by an almost sour taste that is close to orange peel, but comes through only in small doses. A minor bit of chocolate in the background.The mouthfeel is of medium thickness and does present a bit of alcohol but not to the boozy level. A solid wee heavy and I would definitely recommend it."

Sweet full body with decent carbonation and a warming feeling. Pleasantly surprised with this beer. i was expecting something over the top with the name, but this is well balanced and very tastes brew!"

"Pours a clear copper amber brown with a huge pillowy light tan head. Head lasts all beer leaving beautiful lace down sides of glass. Head has a very soft silky feel to it. Aromas of dough, bread and fruit. Fruit noticed first on the palate, prune juice and apple like. Boozy alcohol notes are prevelant as well. Spicy notes at the end. Really like the mouthfeel on this one. Has a viscous slick and silky feel enhanced by the great head. Great offering for this style."

"O: Really, really great beer. Lots of flavor (and alcohol too, if you're into that kind of thing), incredibly balanced. Unlike any scotch ale that I've had before."
"Skull Splitter is indeed a beer that gives one much to fry their brain over. It has a potent, profuse flavour profile that is a respectable mix of abstraction and concreteness; definite maltiness and suggestive fruitiness. Its reputation as one of the UK's heaviest hitters has been rightfully earned."

"I've been meaning to try this beer for years, simply because of the name of the beer. It sounds like a Cannibal Corpse song. As it turns out, Skull Splitter is a solid Scotch Ale. This may be my benchmark for future beers of this style. It's tasty and somehow drinks like a lighter beer."

"O - Interesting. This one is certainly easy to quaff and I can easily see myself having a few in a sitting but the ABV sure would sneak up on me."

"Worth a try, better as it warms up."
"Final Grade: 4.15, an A-. Orkney's Skull Splitter is a fine scotch ale that is perfectly suited to sipping on a cold Canadian winter's night. I honestly wasn't expecting much when I picked this one up, but it has probably been over a year since my last wee heavy and this one absolutely hit the spot. Not to mention the fact that - at its LCBO price point, at least - it's a virtual steal, especially given the difficulty of finding quality scotch ales in most of the province. Great value, and well worth a tipple this winter."

"Clear brown with ruby red highlights, light quick-dissipating off-white head. Smells like rich cherry, some toffee, and red berries (raspberry). Tastes strong dark red cherry, malt sweetness, hoppy spiciness, and a light bitter finish. Very thick and chewy with a medium to low carbonation. It's got a little Dr. Pepper vibe going on with the cherry and overall it's nice, albeit slightly sweet, sipping beer."

Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark, transluscent amber with a thick eggshell colored head. The head recedes slowly and there appears to be moderate carbonation in the beer. The taste has that roasted malt and toffee flavor that I detected in the nose. It's pretty bready with some of those dark fruit flavors. Those grassy hops come through and I get that nice back end hop bitterness that really helps to balance this beer. I get some of the alcohol as well. The body is full with moderate carbonation. The beer coats the mouth well and there are warming qualities from the 8.5% ABV. This is an excellent beer to have as the weather turns cool."

"A well made beer but not the best Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy I have had"
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. Dark brown body with blood red highlights when viewed closely. Wonderful looking head of white foam sits on top. Plenty of carbonation. Smell has aromas of cherry and dark rum. The flavor was delicious. Plenty of notes of fresh plums and fig, with a gentle sweetness coming from the malt. Mouthfeel was on the thin side for a scotch ale. Never would have guessed the abv at 8.5%. A wonderful beer that I wish I had more of in order to cellar for a while longer."
"O - This hits all the aspects of the style, loads of flavor, and easy drinking with a dangerous level of abv. Highly recommended and stoked that I had the opportunity to try it."
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruits, burnt caramel/toffee, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, burnt caramel, dark fruit, and some earthy, herbal hop flavors. There is an alcohol kick and a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but fairly strong."

"Review from 3/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red brown with a small tan head and lacing. Aroma of dark and dried fruit, caramel malt, alcohol. Sweet and roasted malts and caramel up front. Light peat middle and light malty finish. A nice Scotch ale. Alcohol well hidden and leaves a nice warm feeling."

"Been a very long time since I had one of these, it hasn't been available locally since I started actually reviewing beer, so I can't really reference if or how it may have changed over a decade. Still rather enjoyable, especially for this style that can easily become cloying. Great malt character with just enough hops to keep it somewhat reigned in. Glad to see it available locally again, it's a classic."
""
""
"Overall - I would definitely buy this again. It borrows mild characteristics from that of Trappist Rochefort, yet still remains less heavy (certainly less bready) and a little more scotch flavored. Very well balanced with lots of interesting dark fruits to enjoy. This straddles the line between Belgian strong ale and scotch ale, while still representing elements of a Barley Wine. I would not classify this as a ""Scotch Ale"" as it has been above. I feel like that's a tad bit inaccurate, but that's just me. Enjoy!"
""
""
""
"Overall I thought that was an ok beer and I thought that it was a pretty average example of a Wee Heavy, it had a great look and aroma, but the taste seemed lackluster, it was like a very watered down version of aroma and that really held this beer back. This beer isn't that drinkable, with some warming alcohol and a high amount of sweetness, one bottle is just a little more then I would want. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both great. What I liked least about this beer was the taste, it was a let down and compared to the aroma it seemed watered down and rough around the edges. I wouldn't buy this beer again, they are plenty Wee Heavy's that I like more and are much cheaper, if you are really into the style it might be worth a try, but other then that I can't say I would recommend it. This was my first time trying a beer from Orkney, and I have to say I wasn't that impressed with and I wish the taste lived up to the aroma, so it didn't make for the best first impression, I would still try more of their beers, but I'm not too eager, better luck next time guys."

"O - A striking Scotch Ale, not to be missed by fans of this style. High ABV evident in feel, aroma and taste - a bit more pronounced than ideal - but this is a beautifully crafted beer in which the higher alcohol effects are an integral part of the experience. Flavor dynamics changed with some additional warming, becoming tamer and more refined."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very well put together. Boozy, but delicious. Malts, sugars, spices, and fruits are nicely balanced together as well as against the hops, which clearly exist to create a clean finish, but are not in the nose. A great alternative to a shot of single malt at the end of the day. More of a sipping beer, although two or three across a relaxing evening wouldn't be out of the question. Definitely worth having a four-pak in the fridge for appreciative guests. A sophisticated, amped version of the style."
"This is by far my most favorite of Strong Scotch Ales. It has a creamy maltiness that is very appealing. A slight peat flavor comes through and the alcohol content of 8.5% ABV complements the malt sweetness nicely. I had this at the Hair of The Dog pub in Chattanooga, TN and really wish I could get this in Oklahoma."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass. Dark tea-colored, with an off-white two finger head that dissipated into a medium thick cap and heavy lacing. The nose is heavy with malts and molasses. On the bready side taste-wise with a hint of pepper and dried figs. Mouthfeel is more than medium-bodied with an oily texture. Even though I prefer ales, a Scotch Ale is not one of my top choices. This, however, is one of the best I've had of that genre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Other Info: I picked up a second bottle of this about a month after I first tried it, and it was nowhere near as good. The sweetness wasn't there, the bitterness was harsh, and the aroma was almost non-existant. I assume this must have been treated very roughly when being shipped, as it was nothing like the first."

"Review from notes. Enjoyed many times over the years, making it official here. Along with Young's Old Nick one of the very 1st Scotch Ales I ever tried that made me seek out this wonderfully warming style. Poured into Duvel tulip a rich dark amber with a half an inch of dense head that has great retention. Smells of yeast, malt and dark fruits like plum, raisin and fig. Mouthfeel is good and spicy on the front end, retaining it's wonderful maltiness that almost has a peat like quality that mixes with the sweetness of the aforementioned fruits, a bit of yeast and good carbonation. Finishes spicy and velvety on the palate with the 8.5% abv being evident to be sure making it a wonderful winter warmer. I've always wondered about the listed abv of 8.5% as it seems higher and definitely lives up to it's name, Skullsplitter."
""

"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a tulip. A moderately aggressive pour yields a nice, dense one inch ivory head that follows the beer down the glass. The beer is dark amber, with lots of small bubbles. The aroma is butterscotch and toffee. Lots of that in the flavor, and some fruitiness, with a surprising dryness at the finish. A hint of smoke. Some diacetyl? The carbonation is a nice counterpoint to the sweetness. Somewhat coating, medium bodied. This is an excellent wee heavy, very well balanced."
""
"The mouthfeel is of medium thickness and does present a bit of alcohol but not to the boozy level. A solid wee heavy and I would definitely recommend it."

"The last wee heavy I had was Founders Dirty Bastard and I recall it having a stronger, more aggressive flavor. SkullSplitter is more balanced. It’s got a lot of the same parts but doesn’t come off as bold. If you want to have a few at a time I figure that’s good since I remember thinking I probably would not have wanted more than one Dirty Bastard at a sitting unless it was going to be with a good hearty meal. I liked SkullSplitter a lot and would definitely look to have it again."

"O-Absolutely fantastic scotch ale. great balance and lots of dark fruit complexity that meshes with just the right amount of hops. Best scotch ale ive had by far."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not to familiar with scotch ales or wee heavys, but this is a good start into the style. Nice and tastey and boozy too. My cup of tea."
""
"In short, a malty, caramelly and fruity brew lacking smoke, earth or peat character one might expect from a Scotch Ale. (330 ml, Best before end July 2011, into tulip.)"
"Overall I've got a feeling that this is one that will benefit from a year in the cellar. Smooth out the alcohol and the hops some and it would be very nice. With them still raw, though, it doesn't do much for me."

"Poured dark, with a nice deep blood red hue to it and a thick off-white head nicely settled over time. Smells of dark fruits, malty, a bit of hops and alcohol. Taste malty, dark molasses, fruits, spices with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is sweet, rich, full body w/ good carbonation; warming. I really enjoyed this beer.

"The aroma is sublime. The appearance is less so - a bit cloudy, but pretty colored. This is easily my all time favorite scotch ale and it might even prompt me to give others a try, hoping to find more great ones like this."
"Poured a 2"" light beige head. Body is brown in masstone but held up to the light it's a deep beautiful auburn amber. It smells like a complex array of malts, maybe a little dried fruit. Taste repeats the malt smells and also has a sweet and salty emphasis to them. Body is medium rich. This is kind of like a concentrated version of the Scoth ale style. And I'll add the price among imports wasn't too bad at all, and though I feared the SkullSplitter name was merely marketing it actually turned out to be deserving of it, both historically and due to the higher alcohol level."

"This beer is very palatable and quite enjoyable. A definite recommendation."
"Notes: Good stuff, a heavy beer suitable for hand to hand combat or getting warm on a chilly evening."
"A great beer!"
"D - Vinous and sweet. Very solid. I enjoyed it."
"Best beverage coming out of Scotland that isn't Scotch."
"Smooth on tongue with a drying finish. A really quite nice wee heavy that was a rather nice surprise."
"Mouthfeel has rich and creamy full bodied feel. Overall, Skull Splitter is quite an enjoyable Scotch Ale. Not as cloyingly sweet as some tend to be but still a full bodied malty brew for a nice cool evening."
"O - Wow. For $3/bottle, this is a steal. I've found a new go-to Wee Heavy."
"It's crisp, and it can handle earthy and sweet heavy pizzas like a charm. Take full advantage of this beer. It will turn a so-so earthy dinner into a damn good meal."
"The color is dark ruby and murky, with suspended particles. The head is tan, with little retention and no lace. The aroma is mostly sweet, with caramel or molasses character. Tastes initially sweet, but the finish is on the dry side. Raisins taste could be noted, and there is an obvious malt character. Alcohol taste is very obvious. Little hops bitterness is present. Medium bodied mouthfeel, with tingly carbonation. Overall good and pleasant."
"O: There isn't much to say about this beer other than it is complex and tasty."
"Pretty hard to say anything bad about this offering, lest Odin's dogs of war be set free. Still, the standard, enjoyable big malt component isn't done any favours by the kind of off-putting hop character. Booze, I can deal with, this, less so."
"O - A sweet, malty brew with a good measure of provocative complexity. A touch thin in the body for my liking however."
"Pours a deep mahogany color, crystal clear, with about a quarter inch of cream colored head. Smells sweet with light fruit scent, like cantaloupes and figs. A bit of funk. This one might a bit past it's prime. Flat flavor on the front end. The middle has a strong fruity flavor with a light sweetness. The sweetness then turns into a back end, which is a bit bitter. The bitterness then magnifies and really shines at the far end and lingers in the mouth for a few seconds. The mouthfeel is great. The body is dense and smooth, but not too thick. There is little or no sting on the tongue from the alcohol or the carbonation. Overall a very nice beer. Very enjoyable, but I'm not very impressed. A very good beer for it's style, but not amazing."
"O- Had to try this partly due to label and name...but more to ""The Bros"" rating of an A+(without details??!!) Decent enough. Will try again. No way, no how...can I possibly give this an ""A+"" though. Not even an ""A"."
"I wonder if they call this skull splitter because it splits the senses. Rich malty aroma and hoppy taste. Confusing but interesting."
"O - One of the better scotch ales I've had. Not too keen on the sweet ones, so I usually avoid this style, but I quite like this one."
"O) I would try it again and again, if not for the price. Orkney has a real winner ... and perhaps a classic .. in this Scotch Ale."
"Overall, beautiful beer. Well executed and highly drinkable, this is one of the better Scotch ales on the market in my opinion. Not overly dense and viscous like most American takes on the style, but still a really warming beer if your in cold weather."
"My first A+ review and a perfect choice for the first night that required the furnace. Very dark amber with a beige head that gradually dissipated and stuck somewhat to my thistle glass. Smell is all the wonderful things you get from a fruit cake (even that little bit of alcohol you get from a brandy infused one). Taste is a pleasant sweetness that slowly fades to a clean semi sweet finish, thanks to the hops that only slightly bitter. Candied cherry is the headliner, followed by some almond nuttiness and a definite Sherry earthiness and warmth. The unmasked alcohol helps to highlight all the complexities in this warmer. Don't let the Viking theme and name lead you to believe this beer is just a novelty. This is indeed one world class brew."
"(O) A surprisingly lighter feeling brew than expected. Very good flavor and pretty well balanced. This is a great scotch ale."
"My nephew picked this up in Edinburgh for me. Clear mahogany red pour with two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is totally malt dominated. Tons of caramel with hints of dark fruit, butterscotch, vanilla and bread with just a touch of booze. The taste is complex and loaded with sweet toasted malt as well, with hints of spicy hops, caramel, dark fruits, vanilla, molasses and a healthy dose of booze. Not much of an attempt to disguise the alcohol, but it doesn't hurt the drinkability. Very smooth and warming. Thanks to Kevin for hooking me up with this great example of the style!"
"Nice ruby colour, small amount of head. Very strong smell of molasses and alcohol. It is quite smooth with a strong finish, I got a abit of hops and a sweetness as well. I was happy with this beer considering I bought it on it's name alone.It's a very powerful beer with strong flavour, definitely not for the weak of heart."
"O: A manly brew, not for the wife and kids. Seems a bit harsh and in need of mellowing. Will cellar it for a while and re-taste it later. Nonetheless, I did enjoy it and will have my skull split again by Orkney."
"D- A good beer but lacking in any real complexity or thrill. Something I would certainly enjoy again but not that I would go back to often."
"o-maybe i got a bad one since the review are in tital contrast to what im experiencing but this doesnt do it for me. i will try again to see if my palate develops more but right now, this isnt for me."
"Taste is heavy on the malts, with hints of the aforementioned fruits and some spice. The alcohol presence is masked well. This is a tasty and enjoyable ale. Well-done!"
"Future outlook: Another beer that I have inexplicably passed over hundreds of times..."
"I've had better examples of the style, but its pretty good."
"wonderful example. one that i can't understand why I haven't had before. won't be my last. not my favorite style, but a great beer."
"Earth malts dominate the mouth as well, some oak or maple notes, the alcohol is present but masked up front to finish with a nice warm sensation."
"O - I Enjoyed this one, and think that in the colder months this would be even better."
"Final Thoughts: This screams ""enjoy on a cold, snowy day by a fire"". This could be my favorite scotch. Even if it is summer, I can see the good in this brew. The warming full ale is amazing. Great brew."
"this is a good beer. it makes being a viking(or even scottish) very attractive if this is what i get to drink all day every day."
"Overall: Nice brew"
"Overall this is a deep beer, more well-rounded and complex than versions I recall having in the past. This aged version has developed a wonderful dark fruit character that has helped to smooth out the rough peat edges of the fresh version. I have another bottle of this in the fridge so I may try it a second time to do a comparison. Either way Skullsplitter remains one of my favorite versions of the Wee Heavy style, and a beer that continually surprises me every time that I have it."
"A pretty big tasting Scotch ale that is suprisingly light feeling. It has a nice dark ruby red color and carries a decent head. The smell immediately presents itself and easily provides scents of figs and dates. The taste is interesting and a little complex, but not overpowering. The fruit notes are easily picked up amidst the darker malt. But, it was the lightness of the beer in the mouth that suprised me the most. It smelled heavy and looked heavy, but no this beer drank easy. An impressive, though not skullsplitting scoth ale."
"Interesting beer, worthy of sampling, but don't get too excited about it. However, the label is beautiful!"
"Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth. It is pretty much perfect. The body almost feels like something I'd have on cask. This is way out of the norm of my go to styles but I enjoyed it a lot."
"Overall, I was happy I picked this up, but I think I'd rather opt for a more pungent flavor than one as smooth as this. It's almost smooth enough that you forget about it."
"AMAZING, MUST HAVE!"
"overall an all right brew, but nothing mind blowing. a little less fruit and a little more real malt complexity would be nice. I know this is a good beer, but slightly underwhelming in overall character for a wee-heavy."
"M- Very light and delicate. mild carbonation."
"O: Overall, quite good. I would definitely buy this again, a solid beer, a little easier to drink than other Scotch Ales/Wee Heavys that I've had previously."
"Overall good beer, and unique taste to it."
"Overall: A very enjoyable fuck-you-up beer that may just have made it onto my short list. After all, I would be a fool to want to tangle with Thorfinn Hauskaluif. That's a really big axe. And any culture that erects standing stones is okay with me."
"O/D- Just enough boozey taste to slow ya down but still want to keep drinking it. Diggin' it! Good beer for a good weekend."
"O: If I wanted a heavy, fruity brew that goes well with a comfort food meal on a cold winter night, this would be the choice. Good job overall for a style I don’t gravitate toward."
"This beer pours out as a beautiful redish brown color with a good head to start then it card off just to leave a little white film over top of the beer. The smell is semi sweet with some malts dominating the aroma with a bit or caramel. The taste is sweet too with some caramel flavors through out. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and not overly carbonated. It's a stronger beer too coming in at 8.5%. Overall I enjoy this beer quite a bit, probably one of my favorite Scottish beers I've ever had. I look forward to having this every time I get the chance. Really worth checking out!"
"D/O- Such a great beer...gets better as it warms, too. Highly recommended for Scotch Ale fans or those who don't need a ton of hops to be happy."
"One of the best Scotch ales I've had. And it's from Scotland, go figure. Poured into a stem glass, a deep mahogany with ruby highlights, and a small layer of bubbles for a head. Strong scents of toasted malts, dark sugars, sweet dried fruits, and peat. Big, complex flavor: toasted bread, sweet caramel, brown sugar, dried black cherries, raisins, figs, spiced rum, and smoked peat emerging in the background. Some alcohol bite pervades throughout. Heavy-medium mouthfeel, a bit syrupy, and quite drinkable."
"Clear Amber with a persistent puffy head. Creamy and honey toasted biscuity sweet aroma. Flavor is creamy and lightly sour, complex layers of sweet malts and a light smoke flavor that comes across as a touch phenolic at first blush. Hops are spicy and present late and alcohol brings up the rear. Warming, but not hot. Very enjoyable and smooth. Complexity of such a simple brew is staggering, proving that less can often be more."
"O: Interesting scotch ale. Not my favorite because I'm not into the dried fruity smells and tastes that associate with this beer."
"Narrative: You could feel the idle particles of dust drape upon you bit by bit, your unused glass with a wanting pallor for the warm touch of active paper. They knew what you were when they took you home from Staples: An All In One. Sure you're not not exceptional at scanning, what with your plastic internal parts, but YOU CAN DO IT. Sure you may not print the best photos with your blotchy low quality ink, but IT CAN BE DONE. Faxing? You've got that covered, in a halfhearted, paper jam, off-contrast sorta way. But it is still faxing. The perfect package for a man who needs to a variety of things, very little of the time. Oh, here comes a formidible 5th grade sciene projec- oh I see, they just opted to take a picture with their camera phone and email it to themselves instead of your very capable scanning parts. Perhaps variety is the spice of life, but boring needless diversity, that's more like UC Davis."
"O- A very delicate warming beer. Plus, you don't find many thirst-quenching strong ales around. Great drinkability in an 8.5%ABV beer"
"Sweet smelle and dito taste . Very drinkable dark ale. Thanks Craig for letting me try this one!!"
"O: Easily the best Scotch Ale I've had. And although I'm not a huge fan of the style, it was a nice departure from the usual hoppy imports I tend to drink. A big classic brew tae warm ye oan a braw day."
"Overall this is a very drinkable wee heavy. I don't think this is a favorite style yet, but this was quite pleasant. I only wish it was colder outside and I'd just eaten mutton or pillaged a town. I mean I don't wish that, but it'd be appropriate for this brew."
"Light and easy drinking yet full of flavor. This has a great combination of feel and flavor. It’s always interesting and super easy to drink with no alcohol trace. It didn’t quite split my skull but the movie I was watching it with, “Catfish”, blew my mind."
"Overall this is a very drinkable and rich ale, quite smooth for it's strength. I enjoyed this quite a bit. and judging by my ratings the whole is better than the sum of it's parts."
"O: great ale; had to update all this after having had one on the heels of the Sam Adams Wee Heavy - this has a class and character that befits the tradition of the Wee Heavy"
"Served in a thistle glass (finally got to use it for a Scotch ale!). Dark brown with a thick white head. Malty, raisin-like aroma. Taste is a great malt flavor, sweet with a fig/raisin like character, almost no bitterness or hop sensation. Drinks nice and warm, with a pleasant aftertaste that would be a great drink on a cold winter night."
"Overall- The ABV's are hid well throughout the drink, but it does sneak up on you quickly. Not bad, though a bit too sweet for me. Definitely worth trying though. For what it's worth I liked the old label better."
"Love it going to drink two then put the others in the cellar. Will be buying more. Drink this beer"
"The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than other wee heavies, but what one would expect from a fairly sweet, high alcohol beer."
"O: The beer is quite flavorful and very easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked from the taste. It is a good representation of the style."
"Drinkability (ahem, Overall): For such a strong Scotch Ale, this is very easy to drink, while also having a great deal of complexity. American brewers take note: this is how to brew a great Scotch Ale without going overboard."
"Drinks ok. Not quite what I expected, but still a good brew."
" Addendum- Although I hesitate to recommend blending beers in the glass,we have ,of course the Black & Tan. I now suggest you try a Guinness stout Skullsplitter blend when you find that the Scottish ale can either be a bit too intense for first beer of the day or you feel that the flavor of the ale sometimes fails to bloom without the help of the Guinness lace left on the glass. So, I recommend you try a Red & Black with a base of Guinness draft, which can be a mixture to suit your mood and taste; from barely there to a 50/50 mix. You be the judge. Enjoy."
"Really glad to have had this beer. It's well balanced, low enough in flavor to drink, but has enough going on to keep it interesting. Not nearly one of the great beers it lacks the extreme complexity that many finer English brews have. Still at about 12 bucks for a 4 pack, it certainly is cheaper and easier to justify."
"The drinkability on this thing is off the charts. I am detecting almost no alcohol, even as it continues to warm. Perhaps the ""satiny smooth"" character refers to drinkability and if that is the case I totally agree. This is a wonderful beer that drinks like it is much smaller. It has great flavors and is well integrated. My friend D.C. extolled the virtues of this brew after another friend's wedding, and I am now kicking myself that I did not try it sooner."
"Pours an almost-clear, reddish brown color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very malty with some dark fruit and caramel malt. This beer smells very sweet. Taste is not as sweet as the nose implies. Very strong malt flavors with barley and grain. I also get a lot of caramel and maybe a bit of toffee. There is also some strong alcohol flavors. Mouthfeel is very full bodied and a bit syrupy. Drinkability is fair...as scotch ales are not typically my favorite beer. All in all, this is a great representation of this particular style."
"Drinkabilty - This doesnt feel like a 8.5% beer. Pretty mild and smooth. This is too mild for me, i much prefer founders dirty bastard or even the spiced up wallop that the traquair ales bring. Scary smooth beer to drink at such high alcohol. Also, this bottle i have features a different cover label then the classic one ive always known with the real person in viking attire. This one has a cartoon viking and a new logo."
"D - turn down the lights, turn on some Bathory, let this warm up to just barely above room temp and enjoy"
"Overall, a very nice brew. Certainly worth your time when you see it."
"Drinkability: Not as intimidating as it's name would imply, a real outstanding beer."
"Another old favorite from back in the day finally getting revisited. It pours a clear sunset amber topped by about a finger or so of off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, buttery biscuits, light toffee, and orange peel. The taste doesn't deviate one bit from the sell. Period. Fair enough. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat drying finish. Overall, a solid Scotch ale, but somehow not as good as I remember it being back in the day."
"pours a muddy brown color reminiscent of the water in the Great Dismal Swamp in my home state, with minimal head. No freshness date. Aroma is of strong malt,dark fruit, plums and figs. Plums and raisins hit the tongue first, with muted alcoholic notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied, sharply carbonated, probably the highlight of this beer. Definitely an interesting beer and not too pricey either."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a dark amber color. Not a lot of head, but it settled into a quarter inch layer that lasted through the glass. The smell was quite complex. Malty, sweet, some spice and some faint smokiness. Taste consisted of fruity character, figs, and dates. Malt then nutty, then some bitterness to balance the sweetness, hints of smoke. As the beer warmed, more alcohol came through. The beer left the mouth slightly dry. Very light carbonation. A deceptive fruit beer that I wasn't a big fan of after trying this years later..."
"Perhaps it was this particular bottle, I would have to try it again to fully decide. But at $3.99/bottle (from my local store) it may be some time before that happens."
"D - Despite the 8.5% ABV this has okay drinkability, not quite sessionable, but I could enjoy a couple of these. With a name like skullsplitter I was expecting this to be harsh but it was actually smooth and delicious."
"D: nice strong taste, very good, smooth dark beer....this was the last of several i tried and looks like i ""saved the best for last"""
"D: After smelling this is thought it would come out like syrup, alcohol smelled stronger than 8.5, warth does help this go down. Not sure how many I would have in a row, but went well life my home made burgers."
"D - Well its ABV says no but be hell yes its drinkable! You wont have more then a couple before a bed or floor comes calling but hangover be damned go for it! This gets better as it gets warmer."
"This beer is one of my favorites. It has strong alcohol content (8.5%). The ale has a dark brown color which is great. I wish it had a more hoppy note. It is like a lion stout but far cleaner and better. It has a satisfying molasses finish which is why it is my 2nd favorite beer in the world!"
"D: This is a very good representation of the style, the sweetness is a bit much for my liking, but with time at room temp, this sweet character has more battling to do with other flavors that come forward. Good hidden ABV. Seek Out and enjoy."
"D: this is a nice well balanced Scotch ale that leans a touch to the sweet side. Very interesting nonetheless, worth trying."
"D: It would have been better with more peat but Orkney, like most breweries that brew wee heavies, shies away from it."
"Overall I'm not a huge fan of the style but this was a solid representation of the style and it went down smoothly. Not worth seeking out but worth a shot if you see it around."
"despite being quite boozy (which I happen to enjoy), this is a really good beer. I could drink one of these for several nights in a row and not tire of it. great representation of a wee heavy."
"Pours a deep ruby body with a big fluffy caramel tan head, nice fine lacing forms evenly down the sides of my glass. The aromatics bring out caramel malt body with a fruit ridden malt body. This one has a new label, with a prety badass cartoon dark comic book viking versus the old red foiled kind of shitty viking pic. Flavor a touch of underlying smoke, roasted caramel malts, ripened plums. A bit of hidden booze in the finish, body is medium bodied. Carbonation is pretty easy going, finishes dry but has a nice rich malt flavor. Seems different from yrs ago when I initially had it but still an enjoyable experience overall, not a must have but a solid wee heavy for sure."
"p.s. Shame the bottles are smaller than average...that's what she said....?"
"D: At this ABV I and considering the finish, it'd be difficult to call this a session beer."
"drinkability - is good but this beer is overpriced - doubt i ever buy this again - give me a bsd or a good doppelbock"
"D - Really enjoyed having one. It's not my favorite style but I think it is very well done."
"pours a nice reddish color with a frothy off white head that recedes to mounds of patchy lace. the aroma produces a nice bit of sweet malt character with with hints of fruit and caramel. the taste follows with a a touch of spice followed by the lovely malt arangement. the medium body, smooth mouth feel and light carbonation make this a very drinkable wee heavy"
"D: this is a sipper for sure, and is a very nice interpretation of a wee-heavy."
"It is my first real scotch (made in scotland) and i really like it, looking forward to get it again"
"Drinkability: despite this beer's huge ABV, I could drink it all night long."
"Drinkability: Despite the relatively brazen alcohol, the ale really pulls through as a top-notch scotch ale. Very creamy and malty with a good dose of alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is good, but much lighter than many Scotch Ales. A slight buttery and creamy feel with a slight bitter finish towards the end that is nice overall. Since it's slightly lighter, the drinkability is very good. A classic that will have longevity in the world of craft beer."
"Drinkability oh yes VERY good I want another one... This might very well be my benchmark for a Scotch Ale until I find one that surpasses it! Drink up!"
"This is a tear-jerker. I wish it were a wee bit heavier, darker and more complex. BUT so far - this would be my McEwan's surrogate until I meet a better contender."
"Undoubtedly one of the very finest examples of the style to be found anywhere. Effortlessly slaughters all imitators."
"Overall: a great example of the style. Scotch Ale is not a style I often drink, but this is an outstanding example."
"SkullSplitter is the color of my blood. The head pours small due to it being pulled down by the brawny weight of the brew. I don't trust a Scotch Ale that has a fluffy head. The aroma is rich, dry, malty, cherry-fruity, delicately smoky and swampy - it vaguely resembles an altbier as well. For the style, the flavor is big and bold - absolutely perfect. Alcohol barely intrudes, if at all. No over-hopping nor over-smokiness. At its core, whiskey, cherry, and burnt wood lead the flavors, nougat and butter-cookie at times, with a lightly sweet, mostly dry, tobacco-lined aftertaste. Man flavors. The feel is nearly flawless - moderate density, motor-oil smooth. This is the best goddamn Scotch Ale in existence, and that statement is only marginally influenced by the bad-ass label and tale about the namesake. The ale is eternal, invigorating, inebriating, and revelatory. Hail SkullSplitter!"
"This beer is on the sweet side, but there are lots of nice balancing flavors going on here and the smell is really exceptional."
"Drinking this beer is like going to a dark metal techno bar with a vampire thing happening. It's odd but really cool and sexy while being hard edged."
"Drinkability - for 8.5%, you would barely notice, this is a very good beverage that I wouldn't mind revisiting"
"D - well I pretty much got this because of the cool cover art (viking? Hells yeah) but I got it again since I have been dabbling in wee heavy's and this one is just a mild step below founders dirty bastard. I may have it again but really it's a one per sitting type of beer. Pretty nice flavor though/"
"D: This beer could easily be downed in 5 minutes, but the drinker would hate themselves for it, because they would miss out on SOOO many unique flavors! I gave it a 4 on drinkability purely on the fact that one should enjoy this beer over 15 or so minutes and appreciate all of the characteristics which present themselves as this been warms, and trust me they are vast!. I highly recommend this beer!"
"extremely drinkable brew -"
"The teetertotter I've been on with this beer is a little frustrating. If I were to guess, I would say the two times I had horrid experiences with it, the bottles were old or improperly stored and that this latest bottle is really fresh and young. I would drink a GOOD one again, but I'm batting 500 right now and may not want to tempt fate."
"Overall, a really interesting, complex and smooth strong ale. Definitely ranks among my favorite English ales."
"A very appealing beer with a nice taste and smooth character. I could easily see myself ordering this beer when going out, or picking up a 6 pack when staying in."
"D = Perfect with (or after!) a good, hearty chunk of roast beast. For it's simple yet assertive flavors, this brew really delivers as an impressive beverage to compliment and showcase a session."
"It makes me have to think that the bottle got heated pretty badly on the trip across the pond and completely killed the balance of the beer. That's the only explanation I have because I have read some great reviews of this beer. Of course, I finished the 4-pack."
"Drinkability-It starts off sweet but the complexities afforded mid-palette prevent it from becoming cloying and keep me coming back for more; this is a top notch brew and my favorite Wee-Heavy/Scotch Ale that I've had."
"Pours a rich mostly clear brown with an impressive head, though it falls quite quickly. The aroma is rich and roasted malt, with a woody, peaty edge. The flavor is intense and dark and roasty, with a cherrywood smoke feel. There is plum and peat and a raisin sweetness The mouthfeel is thick and a bit prickly. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Pours a clear, rich mohagony, with a very nice and sticky tan head. Smell is sweet and of caramel. Taste is dark as well, and of roasted malts and roasted sugars. Very molasses-like. Super smooth and super easy to drink. Finishes just a tad bitter and very slightly hot. Feel is ever-so viscous, like a wine. Just a fine example of how to blend rich flavors comfortably, and also mask a higher alcohol %. If I were a viking, I'd be glad to loot a case of this.."
"Drinkability: honestly it drinks wonderfully but I'm more than good after one, its a decently high abv plus its thick and fills you up with 11.2 ounces quite nicely. All in all one of these is all you need in my humble opinion. Definitely one of my all time favorites."
"I really enjoy this beer but I would still classify it as a sipper. Interesting flavor to be worth getting four at a time, but not consumed all at once."
"Great flavor, very much the standard wee heavy, but without the over the top fullness in the mouth - just a slight bit too light. Chocolately, very malty, a tiny bit of sweetness to it. I didn't feel the alcohol, it was nice and smooth, and remarkably easy to drink for the style."
"D - A very dangerous beer, you wouldn't even notice the alcohol level until it hits you. The quintessential Wee Heavy? Perhaps it is, you could make that argument."
"If I could drink several scotch ales every day, and could do so without falling over drunk, this is what I would drink. An exceptional aroma of oranges, bread toasty malt erupts from the thin but dense head, with a good burn of alcohol to carry it to the brain. There's a dense, opaque body the color of cloudy iced tea, and then there's taste-- flavors of oak, vanilla, fruit, malt, bread and even some carrots (?) just burst from the glass as if the beer were being sprung from a corset five sizes too small. Not as smoky as other scotch ales, but there's a hint of peat pulsating in the background which keeps the hops in check. Looks strikingly handsome in a thistle, too. The low carbonation and overall density make this something to sip after dinner with a good movie. It's the kind of beer that makes me glad I drink beer."
"An excellent example of the style - and a good value to boot."
"This Ale is not for the faint of heart. Not my favorite but I tried to seperate myself from my personal tastes because I've heard so much good about this. This beer taste like meat, and some people really like that. It was seriously a meal in a bottle complete with the alchohal. I can't imagine drinking more than one of these, I certainly couldn't stomach it. Somtimes I wish I could be the kind of man who could enjoy this kind of drink.More like that viking on the bottle."
"D- a real pleasant drinker that I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
"D: This isn't my favorite style, but overall an enjoyable beer. Would definitely drink it again."
"D- Very nice to drink, 8.5% ABV so not a all night session beer but still pretty wonderful."
"A full body all around, but somehow still agile. The beer builds it sweet maltiness throughout and finishes with with a dryness which is the only evidence for hops here. The rich malt in this brew manages to not be overwhelming, but rather enjoyable. It's not boozy and rather drinkable. I emptied the 33 cl with utmost speed, considering it was a Scottish Ale."
"Pours out dark amber with a perfect head that slowly dissolves, but leaves its mark on the glass. First whiff of this one and I notice aromas of sugar, molasses, cinnamon and a faint presence of alcohol. Taste is quite sweet, definitely the sweetest scotch ale I've tasted yet. Huge malty flavor up front that goes down smooth with random flavors of alcohol and a hint of cherry with some spice notes. Mouthfeel is carbonation with a nice lighter body. Overall, an exceptional scotch ale, easy drinkability with an abundance of flavorful notes. A nicely balanced brew."
"D- Again, considering the Alcohol content, I could, and have thrown back quite a few with ease."
"(D)- A great example or the style. I enjoy the light smoky bit in the smell and taste. A little too sweet and rich to have a few of, but I am definitely enjoying this bottle."
"I read other people's reviews about a silver foiled bottle, and I noticed my bottle had red foil which might indicate different batches."
"As the name implies, this is a beer that will knock your socks off! A very robust, heavey 8.5% ABV beer, packaged in my all time favorite beer bottle: a silver foil neck with a picture of a viking ready for battle. This is a beer ofr beer lovers! Not cheap, but worth every penny and I guarantee you will drink every drop. Comes in 4 packs. Not sure if there are 6 or larger packs."
"A good example of a Scottish Ale."
"overall - good beer. I enjoy having it, but would I want a 2nd one right now? probably not."
"D: Never had a scotch ale, so for my first one I was pleasantly surprised. Good beer to have to end the day and wind down."
"This was pretty damn drinkable. Good flavors, great mouthfeel, and it hits the spot."
"Eric"
"Overall: Odd notes, actually--among the first beers I selected from a 500+ menu at Clancy's in Bloom (fond memories); among the first I revisited at the Laughing Lion; one of the few ales I shipped Shan's cousin Mark, always trying to get him to break away from his lager/pilsner dependency... a beer worth its price."
"Drinkability/Overall - Could have only one of these at a time"
"I have had this beer several times, and it was a chance encounter with this said beer that really got me back into good beers, something that I got away from for a while. It is not a subtle beer, but a delicious kick in the face. This beer is better then the score it receives."
"For its obvious strength, the alcohol is not burning and is quite well-hidden. Yeah, a very decent Wee Heavy ale. Pleasant, warm dessert beer."
"Yeah - overall, surprisingly pleasant. I find it a tiny bit cloying after a while - and I'd prefer sipping it to drinking an entire bottle on my own, but it's very tasty."
"I have had this awhile ago, but found a bottle at the store so i picked it up since i had not had it for some time. It was in a bottle and poured a dark brown with a tan/ amber head. smelled sweet with strong alcohol notes. strong taste infused with notes of sweet notes. being as it is summer, it is great, but much harder to drink with the heat. is a fantastic winter beer, although is available year round. all and all fantastic"
"Drinkability -- Not a bad brew. Wouldn't turn one down, but wouldn't seek it out again. Your mileage may vary."
"Drinkability: Due to the higher ABV, this is a once an evening beer for me, but it is very enjoyable for sipping and savoring, and it really grew on me more and more as I drank it down. It has an unique taste for something so malty and sweet, and is well worth having from time to time."
"Taste is rich and sweet. Nice strong but smooth mats, the high alcohol is barely evident in the taste. Very rich in the mouth, goes down like silk. Despite the corny labeling this is a beautiful and sophisticated brew. Pleasant surprise."
"This is one of my favorite beers."
"Delicious, very easy to like. Goes down easy. The alcohol is pronounced but in a good way. I would love to have more of this."
"A good version of the style, about how I remember it as the first Scotch ale I had a chance to try way back when."
"D- Exceptional. Really refreshing, and one of my favorite imports. You don't see a lot of Wee Heavys around here. And other than the Wine Center in Springfield and a couple bars you can't get it anywhere else. Tad on the expensive side, but every once in awhile it's a real treat to drink."
"D- This is one huge beer but I could have another one. The alcohol makes no attempt to hide but this beer goes down easy for what it is."
"Really one of those beers you have to be in the mood for."
"Pours a fairly clear amber color with 2 fingers of creamy tan head. Very good retension and lots of lacing about the glassware. Aroma is very malty sweet with scents of dark fruit and citrus hops on the backend. Little bit of mineral qualities come through the nose as well with a touch of caramel and molasses. Taste is malty sweet and well rounded with a pleasant smooth medium/heavy mouthfeel and low level of carbonation. Alcohol is noticeable only in the finish along with some citrusy hops. Lingering taste of the malty sweetness is left in the mouth. Overall very enjoyable."
"Pours a craggy white head, tons of lacing on the glass. Scents of peat, caramel, nuts, and bready esthers shine through. Very appealing. Tastes the same. Very caramelly, not much bitterness, at all. Dangerously drinkable, very smooth not much aftertaste, either. Incredible beer, one of the best on this planet!"
"Very drinkable for the thick body, but the ABV should slow you down."
"The last time I had this I was naive to the international world of craft beer outside of a few Belgian favorites...I didn't even know what I was drinking, but I remember liking whatever it was. Now that I have more familiarity with Scotch Ales/Wee Heavys, I kick myself for not visiting this sooner, as it's one of the best in its class, and a completely unique, memorable experience, period."
"Thick, creamy mouthfeel."
"D: im slightly impartial to the style, it just the malty sweet thick goodness that makes is easy to put away."
"Drinkability - A good beer for entertaining eight to ten beer drinkers (per case) of descriminating taste."
"Notes: A good amount of sweetness and caramel/malt flavors. Has a fair amount of whisky flavors (peat and some fruitiness) as well."
"D - After the first few gulps, you're well acclimated to have as many as you can handle really. It's really warming in the belly, so it's great for a fall or winter evening."
"Malty with a chewy texture and whiskey-like flavors. Not overly alcoholic as the nose may have suggested. Some mild sweetness in the form of a brambley jam. The creamy texture reminds me of an irish coffee. The alcohol also produces a warm vintage port quality. Finishes clean and grainy with quite a bit of dryness. I feel like Skull Splitter can fool people into thinking it's a session beer."
"D- Hell yeah its drinkable and it a Wee bit heavier than any sessionable beers... but hey session drinking can be done with this one be careful."
"Aroma is rich and fruity with a firm malty undertone and just a whisper of fruity sweetness. It pours an appealing dark coppery brown with a decent, if not persistent, pale-bronze head. Fresh, crisp flavor is malty with a fruity undertone, a hint of caramel, and a bit of a bite to it. Texture is tingly, fizzy and edgy, leaving a satisfying finish."
"D: Hard to drink a lot of this."
"I could use a bit more smokey and peaty maltiness, but I am enjoying the sweet, chewy and earthy malt presence. Pretty tasty and has a nice wood (almost like cedar) aspect that adds to the complexity. Very rich, dessert-esque beer. Hides the ABV very well and this is one of the better scotch ales I have had recently. A refined and beautiful brew with a decent price tag of 3.50 per bottle. I think I will hold on to a couple of them to see what a few years does to it."
"D: This and Traquair House have to be my favourite Wee Heavies at the moments. The malt is brilliant; a beer I'd love to sip on all night long and reflect on my Celtic heritage."
"the name of this beer is deceptive as it was fairly easy-going on my skull."
"Pours a clean dark brown color body, huge tan colored head, very lasting. Very sweet malty aroma, syrupy. Some aroma I can't place my finger on, sweet and fruity. Maybe some woody roastiness or something, intriguing. Some mustiness and Englishness. Malty, dark fruit flavor. Very clean aftertaste. Malty, musty taste. Too much dark fruit for me. A little hot as it warms."
"Not for everyone, especially beginners. This is an excellent long drink for dark winter nights. Come taste the heritage!"
"D: This is a good sipper, but not a brew you'd drink more than 2 of, because of the relatively high ABV. I can feel it with each sip."
"Found this 11.2 ounce bottle of Scottish brew nearly two years ago and it's been sitting unrefrigerated in my rather warm garage ever since. Hoping that the 8.5% ABV will have preserved it, this one pours a rosy mahogany color, clear except for the ton of large floaties that blanket throughout. The head is decent sized but settles to a very firm oatmeal colored cover and outstanding lacing. I give it a sniff and find big malt with a cabernet raisin overtone, almost a pineapple ham sweetness, quite interesting and likable. Then the first taste reveals that the garage did not ruin this beauty. A smooth malt with more of the tart red wine idea as noted in the aroma. The pineapple idea again suggests sweet ham and damn if this isn't awfully drinkable for the buzz level. This is beautifully smooth as a medium to full bodied concoction, not quite resinous but close. If there is any knock here it's that it's so sweet and therefore might be a little less drinkable than first thought. Cheese proves a great complement here. But the flavor is complex with some nuttiness and chocolate hints, with toffee/malt all over it. Finely but adequately carbonated. Too sweet to be a perfect brew to me but perhaps it is somewhat due to my poor storage habits here. Still, this is a fine taste experience. Please add some cheese! Good stuff."
"D - A sturdy Scotch Ale... A little more than sipper... Has a lot of good things going for it, but it seems to be lacking in complexity in all facets..."
"After a few Skullsplitters I feel I can know offer some review. This is a delightful brew to enjoy, it pours a deep reddish brown and offers a light head, also has a rather pleasing after taste, good robust full mouth feel. This brew is on the top shelf for me and one of the best scotch ales I have had. I can easily pour these down, you have to be careful with this one! I will continue to enjoy this brew!"
"M/D-rather heavy mouthfeel with a nice slight alcoholic kick with a good level of carbonation, maybe its the we heavy kick i'm on but this is pretty drinkable too, the abv could land someone in trouble, but overall is a very delicious beer but one that is very heavy and is an acquired taste (but that's rather respresentative of the style)"
"Not for the faint hearted. This is a big beer. A rusty amber in colour with a tigh off white head. Aromas of raisin, fig, caramel are there but not quite as pronounced as you'd hope. On the palate the flavour kicks in big time. Big and chewy with firm bitterness, whisky-like alcohol heat (but not at all unpleasant). A strong, long finish. A great beer, but probably only in small doses."
"Goes down easy and is highly enjoyable. Awesome beer!"
"Drinkability: Overall a decent tasting and easy beer to drink. I've had better Scotch ales for less, but this one has something different to offer. Worth a try for sure, but I doubt I'll go back for more."
"D: I'd been mulling over grabbing this for what seemed like a good year and a half. Perhaps I was waiting to acquire the right glass. No matter. The important thing is that I finally got around to buying a bottle. A consummate example of the style."
"D - It's a difficult beer to drink. Overall, not quite to my liking, but certainly interesting."
"Smooth alcohol stuffed dried fruit. Sticky malty body with a touch of marzipan and amaretto. Some lasting crisp biscuit malt on the finish and a breath of alcohol."
"I quite like it. A nice sipper and with enough interesting flavor to be worth getting four at a time. Not to drink four at a time, mind you... unless you're quadruplets..."
"Overall, the SkullSplitter is a manly brew. The flavors are very rich. alot more dark fruit than i expected"
"Overall, a decent beer, that's about it."
"I found this beer to be quite close to the definition of average. There was nothing remarkable about it, but nothing to complain about either. Brown in color with really no head, but some very faint prickle. Malt nose with perhaps a hint of grain or some hops but it reads very subtly. Robust and malty attack. As robust as an average beer can be, I say. Sweet malty flavor, perhaps this sweetness takes away from that robustness. Its a little thick in the mouth like a syrup. Some of kind of dark fruit in the background of the flavor and some nut flavors swirling around as well. A little boozy, but not really. . . drink it and you'll see what I mean. It doesn't hide from its sweet maltiness for sure. Definitely not something you would knock back 3 or 4 of. Perhaps that is why it came in a 4 pack. I won't seek this out again."
"Poured a nice dark brown with deep red hue. Smells malty with some brown sugar and earthy smells in the back. Taste was suprisingly good malt and darkfruit up front with some tannin and black tea in back. The after taste is just on the edge of being unpleasantly bitter but it isn't. Mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, and it is extremely drinkable which is scary considering the fact it I just saw it was 8.5. I will probably buy this again."
"Dark fruit in the flavor and a bitter finish plus a higher ABV hinder the drinkability. Wish I had six but I'd be going to bed early if I did. A better, bigger beer than I expected. Carbonation will be a little much for some, and you miss out by a lot by having this at fridge temp, I bet."
"Overall, it's a solid Scottish brew with a fair amount of complexity. I would certainly drink this again."
"I'll be reaching for this often. Going to have to get a four pack next time I go to Cost Plus World Market. Delicious beer that went down remarkably easy."
"Pours a nice dark copper color with a two finger head that gives way to some decent lacing. The aroma is typical deep roasted malts, caramel, and dark fruits, raisins and plums with a hint of sweetness. The taste is similar in nature roasted malt backbone with dark fruits and caramel, however, the alcohol isn't that well hidden and 8.5 for this style isn't exceptionally high. There is also a slight sour taste. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall it is solid but i feel there are other beers in this class which mask the alcohol better and give a better rounding out of flavor."
"that I enjoy more."
"Final thoughts: Fruity malt bomb that hides the alcohol well, buy is a little too fruity. All the fruits are dark and heavy that come from the malts and yeast only. Interesting taste but a little too fruity for me. It's definitely worth a try for everyone."
"D - Oh, it's very good. Looking for a nice cigar to pair with this beer as it may be overly sweet for the style. This beer would go well with low-salt cheeses, a hearty cigar, and/or a rich pepper steak."
"This beer pours a cherry,brandy colour with decent carbonation that leaves a nice one finger head with lacing everywhere,the aroma is very sweet with hints of apricot,caramel toffee,dark plums,raisins and a sweet alcohol smell lingering in the background aswell,it has a syrupy sticky sort of mouthfeel with big tastes of dried fruits,caramel and a little bit of coffee and suprisingly enough for a Wee Heavy the alcohol is well hidden,this is definately an interesting beer with alot of nice different qualities the main one being for me so far is its the best of the style that ive tried."
"Drinkability: A great brew. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: A new favorite- this beer is very good all around and is well worth a drink. If it was more available to me, I would definitely buy it frequently."
"Dark red/brown in color and sporting a tan head that is kept alive by good carbonation. The smell is mostly of caramel. Very rich and heavy aroma. Quite a bit of dark fruits in the taste. Raisins, figs, and caramel are all present. Only a little bit of bitterness at the end, just enough to help balance the sweetness."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer and I already would like another. No doubt this one will be finding its way into my glass again sometime soon. I'll also revisit this review as my feeling is there's compexity here that I've missed."
"Enjoy!"
"D - Rightfully a classic Scotch Ale, in fact a classic overall in Britain. The flavour is complexly sweet and moreish; one is never enough."
"The feel has a nice medium body and is nicely carbonated. A real nice finish."
"5 M&4 D: creamy and smoothly sugary, without divine intervention of too much alcohol as its 8.5%abv. implies. Full-bodied and richly-flavoured, on palate it somehow feels so light, approachable and relaxing... My first Wee Heavy, and it triggers my interest to try many more of this style! Fantastic beer."
"D - I love rich malty beers and this one covers all the bases well for me. The alcohol is evident but rounds out the sweet malts well. I could have a few!"
"MF&D - a very warming beer; the alcohol is quite spicy going down and it really gets one cozy--perhaps a bad idea on such a hot day. the consistency is smooth and unassuming, not heavy at all, which makes it very easy to drink. moderate carbonation. I think I'll go watch braveheart now."
"Skullsplitter is a solid brown ale with a thin, dense khaki head that leaves nice lacing. It has a grassy aroma with hints of sweet malt and paper. It's pretty full bodied and reasonably smooth. It's a little sticky at the finish. It tastes a little sweet and a little bitter, with notes of grass and wood resin. It's pretty bold and warming and well balanced. It's quite enjoyable."
"Long finish, no surprise with the big alcohol, low carbonation, and overall maltiness. A little lacking on complexity but more than making up for it in being badass."
"Pours a deep copper with a reddish tint. Very small head but lingers throughout with a little lacing. Smells sweet and syrupy with a hint of raisins. Tastes super malty and very fruit concentrated, completely masking the high alcohol content. It has a medium body, kinda hangs in the throat when i swallow. The skullsplitter is pretty easy to drink, a little heavy but very delicious."
"Recommended"
"Drinkability- very drinkable, one of the better scottish ales, I have had a few and this one was definitely very nice."
"One of the better Scotch Ale's out there and recommended."
"Mouthfeel is lush and satiny smooth as the beer effortlessly flows down. Mellow carbonation adds to the ease of drinkability here. I can see how this would be dangerous as the alcohol is totally hidden. Overall, this is just a damn fine drink right here. Will be revisiting this and maybe getting some to age as well."
"This is one of my favorite styles; but this was the first authentic (being that it's brewed in Scotland) one I've had. This is a great Wee Heavy... maybe my favorite one now."
"D - I would do a few."
"Delicious Scotch ale that exceeded my expectations.Certainly one of the standards for this style."
"D - A very tasty Wee Heavy that is almost a definition of the style. However at 8.5% is not exactly a sesssioner. But I shall be drinking again from time to time"
"A nice beer to sip. No reason to chug a beer as beautiful as this."
"I was disappointed with this ale considering how well it was rated on this website and how expensive it was (I bought a 4-pack for almost the same price as a quality yank microbrewed 6-pack.) I overwhelmingly prefer Belhaven's."
"maybe the pricing is affecting me, but it is not quite the quickest drink. the alcohol is hidden well. the flavor is bombastic. but there is just something holding it back from being really really good. we will just settle on very good."
"Drinkability: I have described several beers as hop bombs, and this is just the opposite--a true bombing of malts. Even though you can taste the alcohol, it hides it well--considering the abv. I will have this again and could see myself having another in a sitting. To the style, which I marked on this is excellent. In my own views, this is more of a B to B+ beer."
"D: This is one of best Scotch ales I've had. Very drinkable and bold."
"D = I find this to be almost too drinkable for it's size."
"This beers drinkability is hindered by some of its strength. It has very good flavor and a nice mouthfeel but it makes it difficult to have more than one or two, as does the ABV cause it is easy to drink. Overall, this is my second and I will always keep my eyes open for me."
"D: Not bad at all. I wouldn't make this an all day every day beer, but it's quite good as a nightcap. Preferably while watching Conan the Barbarian or listening to a Manowar album."
"This was not exactly what I was expecting from a Scottish Ale. It was a bit sweeter than I expected, however I was surprised that the 8.5% ABV wasn't as noticeable as one would think. As it warmed towards room temperature, the flavor opened up more, and the body seemed to gain a thickness to it. Towards the end it was almost like I was drinking beer flavored melted butter. The butter analogy comes from the buttery taste to it. I'm not sure that I would want to drink a lot of this beer in one sitting, but a bottle every now and then definitely would be nice. Thankfully the name had nothing to do with how your head feels after drinking it."
"Very good brew, a bit boozy for the style, but very tasty and worth the price."
"Alcohol is too dominant!"
"Drinkability: Not great. I wasn't a fan of this. I had this after Ayinger Celebrator, and this really didn't taste too good compared to that, not that they were supposed to taste similar. Maybe I would have liked this more if I hadn't drunk it right after a beer as good as Celebrator."
"Overall: Goes down pretty easy for a beer high in ABV. Very plesent, this beer exemplifies the style and deservers no less than a world class rating."
"D-Overall well done, but not really reaching for another right away. I guess this is the poster child for the wee heavy style, and a great warmer it is...very good to sip by the fire, but not one to toss back lightly."
"-Dotson"
"Great label & always a crowd-pleaser. However, it is not the overarching crazy beer that many express it to be. A good scotch ale that overtly lays on the alcohol presence; something that detracts from an otherwise decent ale. A smooth dark brown with crimson edges pours with a full tan head that wanders away shortly without lace. The aroma has a strong alcohol component, almost rum, with sweet caramel malts & a smokiness. These flavors come through, but the sweetness & alcohol predominate, leaving the raisin hints behind. A very nice strong ale, but the flavors definitely are overwhelmed a bit. I'd still go for another though!"
"This beer is an absolute treasure. A perfect representation of the scotch style. This beer is a truely powerfull and delicious drink, and was well worth the search. I highly recomend this beer, if my raiting is not enough."
"A great scottish beer, lots of great flavor. I guess my only knock would be that there is very little carbonation, even for the style. Other than that, great malty beer."
"Delicious, and while it may knock you on your feet, unlike those brews concocted by the inhabitants of the Orkney Isles in ancient times, it won't make you feel like you're flying. There's plenty of alcoholic goodness, but thankfully no henbane or hemlock."
""
"note: great sipping beer, perfect to relax with..."
"Feels very good in the mouth -- not too heavy, not too thick, but substantial. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A nice, satisfying, sweet-tasting brew. It had been some years since I last had one and shame on me for letting it go so long, really."
"Not bad would probably drink one or two of these."
"Drinkability is high. The flavor profile is nice, and right on target. The alcohol though moderately high, is undetectable. I think it's a great beer, and a great example of the style."
"The fruit and malt flavors seem to complement each other well. Very complex and goes down easy for 8.5%."
"Got this one in a mixed six pack me and the lady made. I dig it alot wish I just had more. First one to review, 6 to drink as further studing would be necessary I think."
"A cloudy copper brown with one-finger tan head that slowly died and left some lacing. Caramel, maple syrup, hints of toffee, other sweet malts and a very minor hop aroma. This is a thick and creamy beer that lets the sweet malts be abundant in taste. At times the sweet taste can be a little overpowering and the thickness can in fact resemble maple syrup once in awhile but this beer still finishes very smooth. The ABV is well-hidden and even though this is meant to be a sipper I could not put my glass down. This beer will go down easy and quick and then mess you up - hence the name. I can't wait to have another."
"I bought this at Isaac Newton's in Newtown PA.Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a cloudy amber reddish color with a thick off white heading a good looking site. A nice smell of smokiness and hops is immediate. Very smooth with a nice velvety texture after that a kind of sweet aftertaste with no bite afterwards. Beautiful heading all throughout the session. Again a very smooth beverage that is a very drinkable."
"D- alcohol is hidden well, and the laid back flavor and consistency make it even more dangerous. time to split some skulls!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied but slightly thin."
"Not very sessionable , but a damn tasty scotch ale."
"This poured a slightly hazy brown with some tan head. It smelled like tons of molasses and brown sugar with honey wheat and raisin and oak. It tasted like sweet brown sugar and syrupy molasses, with some caramel and honey wheat and creamy yeast. It was watery with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting malty aftertaste. Overall this was very flavorful and tasty! It was clean and hid the alcohol well, so it was very easy to drink. It had good body, but could have been a bit heavier to match the big flavor. This was reminiscent of the Eggenberg Doppelbocks, which is definitely a good thing! I didn't see a date on the bottle, so I'm not sure if this was aged? The huge malt character definitely makes me think it could have been. If it's already this sweet fresh, I can't imagine what another couple years would do to it. Either way, I thought this was a very enjoyable beer."
"This is good, but I don't like it as much as Orkney's other, eminently sessionable offerings."
"Very colorful label art. Overall in interesting experience."
"I hate to say it, but the best hting about this beer in my opinion is the label on the bottle. As you can see in the description, it's a Viking Like fellow that could probably really down some grog. The beer isn't bad, it's just not that unique in my mind. It has a very light looking color compared with some other wee heavys I've drank. It smells and tastes very sweet. I can't quite place the flavor although it seems give me the feeling of a warm fire; a sort of woodlike smoothness, not like the flavor associated with a bourbon barrel, but smooth. Probably couldn't really drink more than one or two of these in a sitting. Although, you don't get the feeling that you are drinking a strong beer; they do a great job of masking the alcohol. I will drink this again."
"Overall: The mouth feel is a bit creamy and a tad dry. The finish is slightly bitter. The beer is well made and has a great overall taste. I can't get over how simple the beer seems, but it has such a complex malt character to it. The beer can tease your taste buds and make it crave more. The beer is mouth feel is really pleasant. There minor flaws in the beer. The caramel was a bit too much."
"I poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear caramel color with a moderate white head, leaves no lacing. The aroma is of sweet alcohol and caramel. The taste follows the nose. The beer is medium bodied but feels a bit thinner than that. It goes down very easily, perhaps too easily considering its 8.5% abv. A solid beer, but I was expecting a bit more."
"Plush, two-finger plus head of brownish white color, no lack of lacing left behind. Red-brown brick color, neither especially clear nor cloudy. Big, soft nose of brown sugar, toffee, coffee ice cream, plum and blackberry fruit, croissant flakes, cinnamon spice, long time before it dissolves, nothing close to hoppiness here. Medium-bodied, given the sweetness of the flavors was expecting more body and heft but moves gracefully. Chocolate coated malt balls, creamed coffee, brown sugar and honey with candied orange slices. The fruit flavors plum, black grape, cherry, however, they recede through the mid-palate and allow the carbonation to provide a drier, smoother mouth texture. Earthier, leafier finish with a light saline quality."
"Drinkability is ok, not a bad example of the style, above average but slightly generic. I bet it would be a lot better beer if they dropped it to 7%, especially in drinkability. Maybe even simply some extra kettle channelization would give it the depth it needs. I much prefer the nuance of Orkney's The Red MacGregor..."
"Overall - Excellent"
"Overall, I really liked this beer and would glady have it again."
"Pretty interesting. If you're looking for something malty but not too roasty this is a good bet."
"I had this at Stockton's Pub and Grill at the Lake of the Ozarks. They say they have the best selection in the area I don't know about that but maybe the widest variety. Enough about them on to the beer. This beer has a red-brown color a small tan head and average lace. It has a malt semi whiskey like aroma. It has a roasted malt flavor with virtually no bitterness what so ever. There is some mild alcohol flavor in the aftertaste. It has a very smooth mouthfeel and is a nice sipping ale."
"D: This goes down really smooth and easy. No troubles at all drinking this beer, and the alcohol is nicely hidden, minus the burn. I could put a few of these away in a night. Great beer."
"The 8.5% is well hidden behind the spices of this brew, leaving a slight warming effect on the way down but in no way dominating the overall feel or flavor. Very smooth and extremely easy to drink."
"From what I've experienced here this beer seems to be a bit underrated, though to be fair I tend to fall in love with beers the more I drink them so I may be at the slightest bit of fault here. I'd say this beer is pretty complex, flavor and aroma are exceptional, but the feel and the ABV bring this down slightly in overall drinkability. A great beer no doubt about it."
"Overall - Well rounded and smooth ale."
"I need a little hops with my beer, this one is all malt it seems. Pours a hazy brown with orange highlights... Not much in the head department. Aroma of band aids and malt. The flavor fits that profile as well. Very phenolic, and the alcohol only comes through at the end. I think this could have done with a little more roasted malt, a touch of hops, and less forced alcohol."
"Pours deep reddish-brown with no head. Aroma of smoke, fruit and sweet malts. Taste is roasted malt and caramel with some yeast/bread flavors. No real peat or smokey goodness, but this does well without. Hides the alcohol very well. Smooth, without being earthy."
"This is a good one. Highly recommended. Drinks kinda' like a barleywine. Just as flavorful, but lighter and more refreshing. You know how with a barleywine, it's great to sip slowly and enjoy; this you want to power through and get to the next one."
"D - More flavor would have been nice (whether hops or malt.) This reminded me off my last excursion with a bottle of Glenfiddich (which didn't end pleasantly). If you like strong alcohol tastes in your beers, then this is for you, but I didn't really enjoy the taste."
"D - Great beer, will be enjoyed many times over. FREEDOM! Sorry, couldn't resist"
" I found this one to be rather un-even and strangelt balanced. bold flavor's with just too much residual sugar and heat. Interesting but limited."
"D-Highly drinkable. A smooth and enjoyable Scotch ale, extensively flavorful. I sincerely look forward to enjoying another one in the future."
"Mouthfilling and warming, this isn't a session brew, but funny enough, it is something you'd like to drink alot of. Terrific example of the style. Not cheap -- small bottle was $4.00 -- but grab some if you can find it."
"D: the only real downside to this one is the packaging. I got a little piece of red foil in the glass during the pour! (no biggie) Otherwise, top notch-give it a try. Take your time and enjoy, it makes the knees weak rather quickly"
"Skullsplitter is silky and fullish in body with a little syrupiness cut by fine carbonation. A fine and excellent drink for would-be Viking overlords and non-violent beer-lovers alike. Nicely drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark amber with a sticky head. It has a very nice look for a beer of this style. The smell is sweet fruit and caramel. The taste is brown sugar and bitter malt flavors. The beer has a nice, smooth feel and good drinkability for its style and abv. On a side note, this beer really doesn't do a lot of skullsplitting despite its name. It's a smooth malty beer. I get that it's a ""strong"" style and it's stronger than common beers, but it's a fairly mellow beer that masks its alcohol content well. Actually, it's not even the taste that makes me think the name is silly but the bottle. It just looks tiny. It's narrow and tall and only 11.2 oz for some reason (maybe, that's standard in other parts of the world but it's odd to me). I think Mike's Hard Lemonade is 11.2, also, and that's just a poor association. I'm sure that there are tons of great beers in 11.2 oz bottles, but this one just feels silly with its little viking (or Scot warrior, whatever(oh, just read the back and it is a viking)) picture and red foil fanciness. I know this is completely off-topic. I like the beer, but I think that I'll pour it and toss the bottle in the future. Right now, that tiny little viking is staring at me and all I can think about is him coming alive and having a tiny squeaky voice. It's sort of unfortunate that I just tried Budweiser's American Ale because it's a very similar bottle but normal-sized, which is probably contributing to my obsession with this bottle's size. Come to think of it, there are definitely other strong beers in little bottles. I really don't get it. So, you make a strong beer, give it an overly aggressive name, throw on some manly artwork, and put it in a tiny bottle? Ok, enough ranting. It's good beer, regardless."
"Poured a clean deep amber with a white head that does not hang around. In the nose, a sweet malt and somewhat earthy. In the taste, a sweet malty beer, with hints of caramel/ butterscotch, and a alcohol presence. It has a dry sticky mouthfeel. It is a bigger beer, with big alcohol and big flavors, the sweetness to this is nice though."
"Loved this Ale or should I classify as a Scotch Ale. As I was at a college basement bar I drank this offering out of a bottle so I can't comment on the color. However, the taste and aroma of this ale was enough to make me very, very happy. This ale smelled fantastic and lured me in for a healthy first sip. WOW! Can I say smooth. This ale had a soft pleasing feel to the palate and a wonderful aftertaste. I couldn't get enough of this offering. Of course, at 8.5% ABV I had to keep thing in perspective. If you get a chance to try this wonderful brew I can't urge you enough to not pass it by."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable - I think I found another favorite"
"D: A nice beer, more of a sipper, but quite tasty and enjoyable."
"O: Rich, sweet, Malty. A very good beer."
"The aroma was mostly malty of the caramel variety. The taste continued on with the main component of the smell. It really tasted like the epitome of a Scotch ale which should make it the standard. In the mouth it was creamy and smooth. It had a unique finish with a soft bitterness that lingered. Overall a pretty solid wee heavy."
"One of my favorite Scotch Ales."
"Interesting, rich, and satisfying, this is nevertheless a beer to sip and enjoy slowly, not one to drink in quantity; even a full 12 oz is pushing it."
"who lived in those parts about 1000AD. Tasty."
"Pours a slightly fogged amber. Nose is leafy and nutty. Kind of a berry edge to it as well. Flavor is nice and malty sweet. Great balance here. Smooth and even. Feel has a slick feel and a low carbonation. Very easy to drink and well worth drinking. An oustandibg beer."
"Drinkability - Not a hint of the 8.5% alcohol here, and very smooth. I'm impressed, I hope the government across the pond doesn't axe this one due to the stupid ""connotation"" of the name. Its a worthy addition to any fridge."
"D: Another brew aptly named if I don't say so myself. This one makes no bones about it's intention and let's you know right quick. An excellent tasting anytime and I shall return!."
"Worthy of another purchase."
"Overall, this was a good choice tonight. Perhaps a great choice. Very flavorful with a creamy body. Alcohol comes through slightly, but is not overpowering."
"Pairing notes: Goes very well with some Newman's Salt and Pepper pretzels. I would imagine this would work very well with any dish heavy with pepper and mildly salted. The sweet and savoury characteristics of the beer comingle and contrast nicely with the salty and spicy taste of the snack."
"Nice, but just nice."
"Great beer every time."
"Pours a clear chestnut brown color with a nice dense tan colored head that dissipated into a solid cap. The aroma is of an old ale; brown sugar, raisins, and alcohol. The taste is of that of a rich malty old ale. A very smooth caramel malt, raisins, honey, and a bit of a roasted nut quality. The feel is moderate with semi-active carbonation; chewy and slightly slick, quite smooth. A slightly different wee heavy, more on the old ale side, not as woody or smokey. Great brew to bring on autumn."
"M/D - Full bodied with no carbonation. Great beer with a meal. Very decent."
"4/3.5/4.5/4/3.5"
"Drinkablity: Very enjoyable brew. Bold, but it maintained a good balance that increased its drinkability. It would be easy to pound a few of these down, the alcohol content may lead to burning down the village though."
"Wonderful, wonderful beer. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor and pick up a couple bottles of 'em."
"Mouthfeel is ok; thick, but in a syrupy way. Overall this isn't a bad beer, but a bit to sweet for my tastes. Probably won't be buying it again."
"Oh ya, this shows of what Wee Heavies have to offer. Tons of malty stuff going on that I love. The flavors and aromas really come out as this beer warms up. Not as smokey as some examples can be, more fruity. Which is a nice change of pace. Highly recommended."
"this lives up to it's reviews pretty nicely. It pours a nice dark amber with light head. Smell is a bit restrained but nice. Aroma is a bit sweet, malty, a little like brown liquor but isn't overpowering. Taste has, again, a really nice amount of sweetness without being too syrupy or artificial. It's a soft, complex sweetness with caramel, malt, maybe a bit of vanilla too. Mouth is moderate on the lighter side for a malty, sweet beer. This is one of it's highlights. Medium carbonation as well. It finished with a slight boozey warmth and delicious, dry, sweet aftertaste. Is VERY drinkable. All around great."
"Surprising light on the palate for a beer this potent. I will definitely seek this out again."
"Awesome wee heavy. Love it."
"This beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick frothy off white head that quickly disappears and leaves some decent lacing on the glass. Smell is fruits, raisins and slight alcohol. The mouthfeel is of medium body with moderate carbination. Taste is of fruit, malt and alcohol that is a little upfront. Drinkability is dangerously high. A little pricey but damn good."
"After reading all the reviews for this one I had really high hopes for it. That was a mistake; this beer was a monumental disappointment. I like to give every beer out there a fair chance. Sometimes I will even give a beer a few dozen chances before I make my decision. As far as this beer is concerned I just don't like it. I could go on and on about certain things I dislike, but I'd rather just leave it there."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and somewhat velvety."
"D- this was probably the best example of this style i have ever tried. something id love to have several of. if you like this style this is a must try."
"Definitely a skull-splitter! A decent sipping beer that would go well with a cold night. Probably the best example I've had of this style."
"Dangerously drinkable."
"Lots of malt and alcohol in the nose. Molasses, smoked peat and spicy almost rye aroma. Sweet start. Hops build by the middle and the finish is semi-sweet. A strong ale that borders on a barleywine. Very warming and tasty. Comes in a pricey 4-pack but well worth it. A special brew."
"Drinkability is great. It seems like you should be drinking a huge bottle of this. It's a big beer no matter what size the bottle."
"watch out for the ABV"
"What can I say, this stuff is great. You would never think it's 8.5% alcohol if you didn't know. It's a nice changeup to go from hop bombs to malt bombs every once in a while."
"Very, very drinkable. Alcohol is well masked. Ranks near the top in the style for me."
"D= An outstanding brew, one of the best of the style that I have ever had. I enjoyed this one as dessert after a meal and I will certainly do so again..."
"P.S. I'm giving this a straight five, but only because it's the best ale of this style I can possibly imagine. I've never had anything close to this in this style. However, I've had other excellent beers in other styles that have approached and sometimes merited a five. When it comes to the Scottish beer world, this is the leader of the pack."
"Appearance is mahogany with a hint of red. I poured a one finger white head. Smell is molasses and roasted malts. It tastes strongly of malt with caramel and molasses. Alcohol is very prevalent, so there is a bit of a whiskey flavor. Feel is smooth and just slightly acidic due to the higher alcohol content. This is a fairly drinkable beer but strong and somewhat heavy, so don't plant to drink more than a couple in a session."
"A good representation of this style. A bit heavy for my liking and the alcohol could have been masked better. A one and done on this one."
"A good sipping beer on a chilly, rainy day. One a session would certainly be enough."
"I love the name of this beer, one of my favorite beer names ever. Smells strong, earthy, smoky, and medicinal. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Taste is intolerable. Drinkability is impossible due to thick mouthfeel and nasty lingering medicinal syrupy aftertaste. I could not finish it. This beer made me want to quit drinking altogether. Should be named Throatsplitter. I shutter and cringe when I see it in a store."
"Drinkability--too rich to drink over and over. Went down easy, but this is a one-at-a-time brew."
"Pours a beef brothy amber brown. Aroma is beefy too! Warms to a molasses, brown sugar, caramel, beef and barley soup. Taste is a bit dry and salty then sweet and warming. Slight bitterness is detectable but understated. This one's a heavy meal akin to shepherds pie. Great to sip."
"Overall, nice scotch ale. I'm not too familiar with the style but I definately enjoyed this one. Would not session this beer bc of how sweet it is, but would be great with some dessert or after a meal. Not sure if I could drink more than one of these in one sitting. Cheers!!"
"Poured from an 11.2oz. bottle, a rich mahogany color, with a healthy head which dissapated quickly. Smell of smokey malts, molasses, and caramel. Very malty in flavor, with a wine-like sweetness, very warming, with a dry lasting finish of horehound candy, caramel, and malt. Nice sipping brew. This would be excellent after a good steak dinner!"
"D: SkullSplitter can tend to get a bit heavy, and when you combine that with 8.5 ABV, you get a beer that's definitely a sipper. I probably couldn't have more than 1 of these at a time, but it's still a solid beer."
"D - A glass of this is wonderful, maybe two. Wouldn't quite call this a session beer but considering the high ABV this is extremely mild and drinkable."
"11.2oz. bottle served in a Duvel glass. Poured a dark copper/brown with a little more than a finger of off white head. Rich malty aroma with caramelized sugar, toffee, and fruit. Full bodied with lots of malt. Molasses sweetness. There are some hops in the middle to balance the sweetness. Nice scotch ale."
"*Edit- 2nd time around, smell is alot more in your face - much stronger yeasty aromas"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and coating. Drinkability is quite high for the style. The alcohol is a welcome part of the overall profile of this beer rather than a harsh overlord. I'm glad to have waited for this one and I wasn't disappointed. If you're a fan of the style I highly suggest it."
"Drank this after work with a couple of my friends and we all quite enjoyed it! Appearance was a dark copper brown with a nice head that dissappated fairly quickly but still had carbonation bubles rising to the top of my glass. Smell was wonderful fruity with the alcohol and hops also in their. Taste was very good with a hop after taste that didn't linger as some beers do! Mouthfeel kinda chewy with some fruit undertones. Drinkability is most excellent very refreshing after one beer I could already feel a little buzz coming my way so I drank two more:)"
"D- The sweetness of the flavor and the chewy mouthfeel makes this a sipper, but the 8.5% ABV is fairly well-hidden."
"rich dark amber, faintly orange, fleeting head. Smells malty sweet, alcholic. Taste was big on the caramel/toffee, though no diacetyl at all like in some other scotch ales. sweet malts a little reminiscent of a dopplebock, but more of a slick, oaky, date flavor. Thick oily chewy mouthfeel, though a bit too much carbonation for my taste. Very rich, yet balanced. The hops do their job. I'm left with a bitter hop and tingly alcohol sensation. ad a powerful dryness seems to wipe it all away and then vanishes itself for a clean finish. Let it warm up for full effect. I paired this with dates and m&ms when i had a serious case of the munchies and it was awesome."
"I've seen this beer multiple times on the shelf and always thought it was a gimmick beer. Decided to pick up a 4-pack on a whim at Green's last night. Sure am glad I did. Pours a light brown with a almost no head. Some lacing on the glass. Smell is very sweet. Don't think it's the alcohol - almost like brown sugar. Tastes absolutely delicious. Very malty and sweet, like brown sugar and maple syrup, but not over the top. Coats the palate and the tongue very nicely, as it's almost chewy. A delicious brew. Very glad I picked this up!"
"An amazing ale that has a complex flavor profile. One is enough to get a contact buzz. Great fest or session brew. Tends to overshadow others."
"Thank heavens for beer with flavor. Pours a hazy brownish color with a mighty head that stuck for a while. Smells of dried fruit and earthy goodness. Tastes of raisons and dried apricots. Nice malt and hop balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant. It got my taste buds peaked."
"D - ok brew for one or two."
"very, very enjoyable."
"D - Rich and heavy bodied. A good example of the style. The alcohol in the finish is a bit hot, and the flavor could be a bit more complex, but the smoky caramel flavors are very nice."
"d - This is a great ale with a ton of sweet caramel flavor, maybe even a bit too much. This is spot on for the style (based on the description for wee heavy), but I was hoping for more smoky or peat types of flavors. This isn't what I thought it was, but turned out to be pretty good anyway. This won't become a regular for me, but it was definitely worth a try."
"I would call this one a damn good wee heavy. It doesn't quite touch the upper echelon's of the style, but it is way better than your average brew."
"Drinkability is good. I'd drink a few of these in a row but it'd really have to be with the right food, as the taste is too unique otherwise. Got another of these that I'll be pairing with some trout."
"This beer also does a great job of hiding the booze. Very tasty, well balanced, and pretty drinkable. Watch out, this could put you on the floor if you're not careful."
"Feels fairly light, but smooth and there is that saltiness that seems to stick around and coat the mouth. Nice sipper, probably much better with food."
"This is a good example of a wee heavy. Tried side-by-side with Belhaven Wee Heavy, and although I enjoyed the Belhaven slightly better this was up there."
"D - A few of these and you'll be buzzing. This is no doubt a big beer. I love the stuff but my pocket can't afford to drink it every day."
"Impressive. I expected this to be overhyped, but I was wrong. Appearance and mouthfeel are what I expected, but the nose is really impressive--strong and complex, I don't think I can do it justice. The taste is bold and interesting (malt, of course), with plenty of development. Drinkability--downed very fast, and I usually drink slowly."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. It is extremely smooth and drinkable. At 8.5%, it's a little strong, but not enough to hinder drinkability. I'd happily drink a few of these. Overall, this is an excellent beer."
"Big and hearty, definitely a good drinkable wee heavy. I'd go back to this one for sure."
"Pours a very clear amber with a touch of brown. Topped by a coarse half inch head that settles to a fine layer, minimal lacing down the glass. Smells of slightly sweet malts, toffee, and caramel. Taste is very similar to the nose but also balanced out with a slight yet noticable amount of spicey hops. A little viscous in the mouth. Aftertaste leans toward the toffee. Very well balanced and hides the 8.5% quite well. I could nurse this beauty for some time and be quite content. Seems like a good example of the style. Worth checking out."
"More drinkable than other strong beers."
"SkullSplitter is a delight of a beer. A strong Scottish ""Wee Heavy"" that is sweet and flavorful and full on many different levels. Scottish Ales are generally all the same; dark malt-bomb beers which are rich and full of caramel, raisin, and dark fruit flavors. The varieties of Scottish ales are typically listed by price. Not dollars and cents, but in the old-school unused currency the shilling. Now Scottish beers are typically listed as 60 shilling, or 70 shilling, the price goes up as the alcohol and malt increases. That brings us to SkullSplitter. At the top of the shilling pile are ""wee heavy's"" the kingpin big daddy of the Scottish ales. These have the most malt character and the most alcohol, and tend to be the most complex and satisfying of all if the Scottish beers. SkullSplitter delivers on all counts. The smell alone is worth a few shillings easy, and for the taste I'd chip in another couple of bucks. To think, I've looked past this beer for years without giving it a thought. Just what else might I be missing, if anybody has a suggestion, after investigating SkullSplitter, I'm all ears."
"D: Only when the mood strikes me!"
"Very drinkable full bodied and smooth. Sweet tasting beer, but far from cloying well done and enjoyable."
"D - This was a really good beer. It is strong and complex yet goes down with ease. Once it warms the smoothness starts to shine."
"D - Excellent for how potent this brew is. I highly recommend this one. This makes two for two from Orkney, both beers I have had have impressed me greatly. Do what must be done, drink this."
"D- its a fine beer to have once and awhile with friends. I would not buy a six pack to sit around and drink though."
"D: Decent brew that I'll probably come back to. Makes a nice night cap."
"Mouthfeel has solid medium body. Mild carbonation is a bit prickly. This is very enjoyable, and I should pick this up more often."
"Drinkability: Sure, I'll have another! Good Wee Heavy! Recommended."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I havent tried to many Scotch Ales, but this is definately worth trying."
"i really enjoy drinking a skullsplitter. i'm fairly new to scotch ales and i find this one highly drinkable."
"D: If I wasn't going to the bar I got this at to sample various beers, I'd definately have had another. This might be worthy of getting a case from my local distributor."
"Saw this beer in various ""Great Beers of the World"" books, so my interest was piqued, and I was able to cop a single 11.2 oz bottle from Total Wine and More in West Orange... This was an excellent all-around beer, great flavor, style, and full of body and essence... pours a copper/amber color with minimal head but a nice reddish hue that is appealing... strong aroma full of caramel, slight malts, butter, honey, and sugars... Great flavor, sweet but not overbearing, caramel, malty essence with a sweet aftertaste... Honey flavor with a good mouthfeel and great drinkability for a hefty 8.5% ABV... hard to detect the alcohol behind a great combination of sweet, malty flavors... awesome brew... Recommended..."
"D- Extremely drinkable despite the high alcohol by volume, though the quality of the brew demands that this is a beer to be sipped on and enjoyed rather than gulped."
"Drinkability: It is very rich and very smooth and definitely not for chug-a-lugging. I had half before dinner and half after dinner - as close to a dessert beer as I have ever sampled. It leaves you with the warmth of alcohol and the sense of completeness of the meal."
"Gets a bit heavy and a bit too sweet after a while though, otherwise nice brew."
"-GAPit"
"This is an excellent Ale,and considering the alcohol content,it goes down real easy.I have had few Scotch Ales/Wee Heavies to compare it with so,as far as I know it is a great example.My only gripe is the cost and availability in my area,but that is hardly the Ales fault...right?This is one I will keep getting,when I can spare 15 bucks for a four pack,that is."
"[Edit, 2-7-2008: Tried this again, and no oxidization. But a pronounced roast turkey smell and flavor! Not as good this time, but interesting anyway. I haven't edited the scores, they're based on the original tasting.]"
"Just a super explosion of taste on the first sip... Flavors of Malt and scotch whiskey and some toasted caramels, all mixed together with a long alcohol laden finish that really stops the flavor abruptly. This makes you want to take another sip. All the great flavors emerge and separate as the glass warms. There is no shortage of a reminder that this has a high alcohol content, but it really does provide Warmth during snow shoveling season. I cant see having many more than two of these, but thats kind of obvious."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is very malty, it smells like toasted malt, raisins, toffee, and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, although there's a nice bittersweet kick in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit heavy and creamy, this beer definitely has some substance! Drinkability is good, the 8.5% ABV isn't very noticable even though it hits you later. The smoothness of this brew makes it easy to drink. I think this is more of a sipping beer, I don't think I could drink more than 2-3 of these at a time. Overall, I think this is a pretty good beer. If you like Scotch Ales, then you should like this one. A pretty good choice, I think!"
"That was one of the easiest 8.5% ABV beers I ever consumed. A good, smooth tasting beer with hidden alcohol will do that. I think the Orkney Brewery would do well to look at the English breweries who bottle their beers in Victorian pints : ) That's alright though, around $2 a pop, you can buy two bottles of this stuff and be merry."
"The beer poured a copper color with very little head. The smell is a little of sweet bread. The taste is of caramel and raisins with a fairly heavy presence of alcohol. It kind of reminds me of fruitcake or something, it's very tasty. The mouthfeel is nice and the alcohol content makes for a very satisfying drinking experience, it's a little heavy to drink more than one of at a time, but I would recommend it as a dessert beer after a big meal. A very nice beer and I'll definitely be picking it up again sometime."
"D= very drinkable for less than your first bottle, then cautions and warnings afterwards, although you'd probably want something different by then."
"Lost a review? Poured from the bottle this beer is a nice garnet color with a light tan head and good lacing. Smell is sweet malts and a touch of spice. Taste is the same, typical of the style, smooth, sweet with a bit of earthy spice and bitterness in the finish to balance things out. A great 'comfort' brew to have while reading a book."
"D = Not the best Scotch Ale I've had, but perhaps the second best (though there are still several on my list to try). Much better than most of the more commonly found brands. Taste is perhaps a little strong to want more than one or two at a sitting, but what a sitting it would be. Definitely something that brings me back again and again."
"Poured out of the 11.02 oz bottle into a pint mug. This has a nice caramel color to it with a nice head and some decent lacing. The smell is very much like a confectioners bread and the taste is big with caramel and raisins. Overall a very good beer and very enjoyable"
"poured out of a 11.2 ounce glass. This is my first wee heavy, just saw Beowulf,so seemed like a good time to drink it. Nice dark brown color, creamy head, moderate retention. Smells like raisins, caramel bread...Raisin Bran! Fruit, candy, raisins again, slightly bitter finish of dark bread. Drinking this seriously is like tucking into a bowl of raisin bran, and I love it!(cereal fanatic) mouthfeel is not really heavy as expected, palate filling, but not heavy. This makes drinkablity easier."
"Taste: Candied fruit flavors up front that quickly fade into dry malty flavor with a warming alcohol note at the end. Not the best Scotch Ale ever but damn drinkable."
"This is a superb wee heavy. Perhaps not as complex as some scotch ales, but it is very well balanced. It again is composed of sweet malts and the quiet leafy hops. A fairly full body gives this brew a wonderful mouthfeel. Overall I found it a very drinkable beer to enjoy on a dark humid night."
"Beautiful beer. It's the best Scottish Ale I've ever had, but I didn't want to rate it perfectly because I haven't had them all. It was really tempting, but I barely managed to find a flaw or two."
"D - Not one to quaff, More or less a one and done for me, but well worth the price of admission if you wish to 'split your skull'"
"This was superb, a really well crafted beer that I waited far too long to try. Finally got around to buying a single of this one tonight while I was on my trip up to knoxville and I was not dissapointed. Poured a very nice deeep dark brown with an ample two inch head of off white foamy lace on top. This had some very nice retention and left behind about a half inch of frothy white foam on the top when it was done. Very nice side glass lace as well. The smell was nice, although I have to say a little on thel ight side. A nice sweet caramel like aroma mixed in with ample earthy grains made for a full aroma, just a little light. The taste was really smooth. for 9%abv this was remarkable in that you could pick up none of the alcohol. It had a medium to full body that had a great creamy feel to it. Great flavors of caramel with a touch of grassy hops and a decent bread like back. It had a noticable nuttiness to it as well. Overall this was a very very nice beer and something I know I will go back to. It was just so rediculously smooth, I really could have had four or five of them, thugh I am sure it would have caught up to me before then. Really a great treat and something I would have to highly recommend."
"Many thanks to Bill for generously sharing this fine and uncommon Scotch Ale, which I had missed the opportunity to try some years ago, and had regretted ever since."
"D - If it wasn't for the price and abv this would be a great session beer"
"****This is a keeper."
"Comment: Rich and smooth without being overly sweet or dominated by alcohol. Great complexity and balance."
"This is another beer for a malt lover. Full bodied and complex. The noticeable alcohol may be an issue for some, but I think it adds character to the beer. Also, it lets you know it's there. Recommended."
"This is pretty good beer. You definatly taste the alcohol in this one. I'd have to say that this is a good example of a scotch ale."
"Overall this is a very solid Scotch ale, one that I would recommend to fans of the style."
"I have been looking forward to trying this beer out for about a year or two when I first heard of it. Man, was I disappointed. I may try it again and re-review it because to me, something was off. Carbonation bubbles stay suspended, tons of off white head and carbonation. Very smoky, lots of phenols, and peat. Will try one more time."
"Great drinkability. An excellent beer, and one of the best Wee Heavies I have had."
"While I still feel this has quite an alcohol flavor kick at the end, I've grown to like it quite a bit. The oak and malt are wonderful, with the heat of the alcohol tuning them up. It has a huge thick flavor and a huge thick scent, that really fills the nose with it's great Scotch aroma. This would be perfect on a cold winter night (or in the Orkneys), and was even good a couple of days ago during the summer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, good representation of style, good kick, this beer is a bit more poundable than most that Ive had in the style. Its flavorful but isnt quite as heavy as other Scotch Ales. I could drink a few of them but the 8.50% ABV might catch up with me by the time I finish the 4-pack."
"Interesting beer."
"Poured into a snifter a deep amber with minimal head retention. Fairly significant lacing as my glass emptied. Had a very sharp smell, not anything like a floral hops. More like a household cleaner. Perhaps this is from the alcohol content. Tasted of toffe sweetness on the frontside but as it finished the high alcohol content surrounded my taste buds. Overall is a very drinkable beer, perhaps if I'm ever in Scotland I'll try another"
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Pours a deep, vaguely translucent copper brow, head that goes down pretty quick with some minimal lacing. S: Spice, toffee, some lighter malts, distant citrus hops; alcohol is present. T: Sweet up front, very spicy, some lingering bitterness in the finish. M: I would expect by the aroma and flavor that it would be very thick, but it's actually got a nicely light body. D: Very nice, like a milder version of Samichlaus. Very delicious. I've heard about this beer for a while and I was definitely not disappointed."
"Thanks to Bill and Kim for the sample!"
"Taste: Ridiculously smooth, I was blown away by the flavor of this beer. Starts out with a nice chocolate note that continues throughout the midpalate, getting sweeter as the flavor progresses. Some caramel notes come through right before a smoky, yet pleasant finish. Wonderful."
"D - This is a pretty good beer, but it would be hard to have a couple in one sitting. I've just been having one at a time."
"Mouthfeel is rich and fulfilling. Drinkability is decent."
"This is a wonderful example of a Scottish Ale. Repsect it, though, it is strong - and highly drinkable."
"D: Overall, a pretty solid ale for the style. Being a fan of Scotch/Wee Heavy, I liked this one, but would prefer others given the choice. Still, the availability of SkullSplitter in the region is fairly plentiful, considering the niche market, so you can't really go wrong with it."
"I wake up this morning smiling with a hangover. I really went all out last night. I go to the bathroom for my morning ritual. I look in the mirror...my skull is split in half...but Im not dead. No wonder I had a headache. How can this be? No NORMAL man could survive such a mortal wound...suddenly, my head begins to mend itself...slowly and gracefully...every fiber melding perfectly. Once Im whole again, the room goes dark...BOOOM!!!! WHITE LIGHT!!--ANGELS!!--SOULS!!--SYMPHONY!!...""I KNOW EVERYTHING!!. I AMMMM EVERYTHING!!"". The World stops turning. Its silent. I am...The American Grandmaster of Beer Tasting."
"D- Simply too sweet. Even for someone that loves Eisbocks. Not very drinkable, especially for a wee heavy."
"Brownish-amber color with fluffy head. Hides the alcohol content very well. Aroma of malts and fruit. Head lasted fairly long. I thought the taste was a bit metallic. Based on others review of this beer, I am definitely going to have to try this one again."
"D: Very, very drinkable. If I could drink like a true Scotsman, I would make this my bread and butter. As it stands at 8.5 ABV, this is a dangerous drink."
"Pours a clean deep amber with a white head that does not hang around. In the nose, a sweet malt and somewhat earthy. In the taste, a sweet malty beer, with hints of caramel/ butterscotch, and a alcohol presence. It has a dry sticky mouthfeel. It is a bigger beer, with big alcohol and big flavors, the sweetness to this is nice though."
"Smelled of golden raisins, candy sugar, molasses; all sorts of yummies. A slight herbal hop present, no detectable yeast; this is a real malty ale. Tasted delectable -- mostly malts, a bit of an earthy spice going on as well. Full bodied, but the alcohol was well masked. Went down as easy as you could ever ask an 8.5% ale to go down. I was considering giving it extra points for drinakbility, but I did get a headache shortly after finishing it. Not that I wasn't warned from the name of the beer... Killer Viking on the label. Super solid all around."
"I love the label and wondered if I would ever try this beer, thanks to Todd (Buckspin) yes I can!! Pours a pretty deep brown color, smells a bit sickly sweet, tastes about the same, like some dried fruit, thick malt, slightly burned, and a hint of alcohol in the background despite it being over 8 percent. Overall I do like the beer, but it is a little way too sweet for me, but just a little. I still think it's worth seeking out for anyone who is curious about this beer. And ya gotta love the label!!"
"D - This just screams ""dessert beer."" I love scotch, and I detect a lot of those same peaty Islay malt characteristics in this fantasic beer. I love this stuff, but I can't say that I would drink more than one. I would, however, drink one every night. So it's not undrinkable...it's just unsessionable."
"Although with the interesting name, this is one fantastic beer. I have not poured it yet into a glass (unfortunately), so I cannot fairly grade color. Taste is extraordinary, very refreshing and not too heavy. Good mouthfeel, just enough to let you know its there, but not too heavy to make you chew. Very drinkable, and I'm looking forward to getting it into a glass to give it a better try."
"What a nice beer to enjoy at your nearby Scottish restaurant."
"Man, what a nice Scottish Ale. This is really enjoyable and much too easy to drink. I can see where Robert the Bruce from 3F's got it's inspiration. I would buy this again."
"Overall, a fantastic brew with character. Strong and deceiving."
"Probably not quite as powerful as a large axe to the face at the hands of a large Viking earl...but it sure does warm my head up a bit. Very dark overall, I like it."
"This beer poured a clear amber color with a thick cream colored head. The aroma is malty with some caramel. The taste is big of malt and caramel with some hints of smokiness. The mouthfeel is heavy and somewhat chewy. The bold flavors and mouthfeel in this beer are very balanced and make this a delight to drink."
"Thank you to Todd the beer guy at McKean and Charles in Waldoboro for getting me to try this. Other than the cool name, I'm not sure I would have bought this without his suggestion. A 330ml bottle poured into a pint glass, it was brown with red highlights, and had a small head. It had a peaty aroma, as well as a little bit of malt. Loved the taste. Bread, peat, alternatingly sweet and smoky. A really nice mouthful. Try this beer."
"D - This is a great brew, prolly the most underrated on the site."
"Now this is the real deal when it comes to the style. Quite yummy."
"D: Fairly thick, but very tasty. I would definitely try this beer again given the chance."
"Next time I go to Kentucky, Im bringing back more than just one of these..."
"Poured this beer from the bottle to a 50 degree tumbler. This beer was caramel colored with a khaki colored head that was really fine bubbles. Sweet smelling beer with a slightly nutty finish to it. Slightly sweet taste but not overpowering. This was an interesting beer and I think I would try this one again."
"D: Its a heavier tasting beer, high in alcohol too. Not something i would drink all the time, but i love scottish ale especially as a change of pace, and while i like traquir more, at less than half the price this is a better value. Very good"
"D: Totally unexpected. This is quite an amazing treat, and I would recommend this to anyone. Rauchbier fans will probably enjoy this one more than others, but the subtlety of the smoked flavors should be appreciated even by novices."
"Pours clear but dark -- kind of a mahogany with reddish caramel highlights -- and a big, light tan head that kicks up big initially but fades pretty quickly. Aroma is pure maltiness, with toffee, caramel, very light figgy fruits, molasses and a touch of wortiness. On the palate, brisk carbonation kicks things off, followed by some nutty malts and just a touch of caramel-tinged fruits. Things are quite sweet and malty. Doughy, thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. This is a beer that is not too complex, but makes up for that in big flavors wrapped up in a smooth package. It's excellent for the style, which IMO should be pretty straightforward and malty, without too many frills. Very good beer."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style, scotch ales are generally too sweet for me, but this one wasn't too bad."
"Picked up a four pack of 11.2 once bottles at whole foods. Poured aggressively into a nonic, thick creamy off white head developed and then faded into little more than a centimeter of film on the surface. The retention is minimal as is lacing. The body is a caramelized brown color with reddish orange tones and tarnished gold highlights. Smell is mildly sweet and very malty. I get lots of caramel, bread, vanilla, biscuit, roasted barley, faint hints of rum, hops are very minimal in the aroma with a slight peppery note. Taste is very malt forward with tons of caramelization and hints of earth. Well balanced roasted barley with sweet malts, hints of rum and a slight oaked or wood flavor. The bitterness is minimal and gives just enough support to balance the sweet caramel flavor. The mouth feel is crisp, yet hearty enough to hold my interest. The alcohol is in the right place for the style, which limits this to only a couple beers in a session, but I enjoy it just the same. Overall this is a pleasant beer and I would likely buy it again."
"Overall it's a nice Scottish ale, but it's nothing outstanding. The buttery feel is missing, as is some of the smoothness for this type of beer. Taste-wise this was a bit of a disappointment as well. I still consider it worth trying, but Traquair reigns supreme..."
"Pours a dark brown color which can be seen through and has reddish tint. Head is pretty much nil on this one. Smells like a doublebock and has that slight caramel wiff. First taste is wow! Very sharp flavor and when you swallow, that high abv comes out too. It does have that slight grapefruit taste mixed with the caramel that I tasted which could be the hops I taste. the lacing on the glass continues on as well as you drink this. There are some more tastiness I can't seem to think of that comes to mind when I taste it. I DEFINITELY would recommend this beer for someone who wants something tasty to drink. A great ale. My first Scotch Ale at that!"
"Pours a clean ruby-esque color with a rather thin tan-colored head and spotty lacing in the pint glass. The nose is of caramel malts, stewed fruits, and perhaps oats? The palate is some what sweet upfront, but quickly yielding to the aggressive hop presence in this wee heavy / Scotch beer. Slight citrus overtones toward the finish, along with the sweet fruitiness that creates a very nice compliment indeed. This beer is quite heavily carbonated and has a medium mouthfeel. Despite the ABV, the alcohol isn't predominant. Finish is dry. Over all, a very good ale. Quite drinkable, as the alcohol is well hidden. I dig the combination of sweet fruitiness and dry hoppiness in this one. Well crafted."
"Drinkability: This beer is 8.5% and very sweet, but I find it more drinkable than many. I kinda leaves your mouth after you have tasted it, and also doesn't have hops saturating the palate. Tasty."
"Pours a clear, burnt caramel colour with a white bubbly head. Aroma is caramel, dark bread, and boozy bitter chocolate. A smoky, oily mouthfeel introduces a dense, pumpernickel bread or wheat cracker flavour with some caramel and a little bit of sweet alcohol."
"D: A big, unique and brilliant wee heavy. Alcaholic presense is there, but it's subtle and sneaky. The finish is pretty long and earthy. Sip this on a fridgid night. One of my favorites."
"Overall not a session, but one to sip and savor. Terribly drinkable for 8.5%, though too many and you'd likely receive a visit from the Skullsplitter himself the next morning. A quintessential wee heavy, excellent example of the style."
"The beer poured a clear med brown with an off white head. The aroma was of malt with hints of alcohol. It tasted of malt and alcohol with dark fruits in the finish also some hints of vanilla. The feel was heavy and slightly oily. While initially the look was a little off it was a good beer, It improved as it warmed, although being pulled it only started out cool."
"Pours a reddish-gold color. Best description I can think of would be semi-translucent caramel. Very little head, but that was probably from the pour. Little to no carbonation is readily evident. Smell is malty, just the barest hints of hops underlying. Hints of vanilla, caramel, and possibly cocoa/coffee. Smell isn't as strong as I expected, but that's not necessarily bad. Taste is caramel, coffee, and vanilla. Some underlying fruit, apple or pear, subtle tones of banana. Hints of whiskey. Mouthfeel is rich without being too thick. Almost like a crisp syrup, if that makes sense. I can already feel the alcohol content creeping up, but it's hard to notice from the taste alone. Goes down very smooth, not too rich, I could down this all night."
"The first sip of this kicked my ass. I was not expecting such a strong flavor. It felt like it must be above 10% ABV, so I was surprised when it was a respectable 8.5. The aroma is of alcohol with some creamy white chocolate -- a touch of citrus. It has a full mouthfeel with strong, almost creamy malts up front. It balances out in the finish with a light hop bitterness."
"Poured a nice ruby red, has a nice thick head. Way to much sediment to point where I had to stop pouring 2 inches from the bottom. My homebrew beer doesn't eve have that much sediment. A nice sweet floral aroma, the bubbles dance on your tongue with a tangy kick. Malty and bubbly best describe this with a hint of sweetness and alcohol warming. Nice beer for a cold night in Wisconsin it is currenty 2 with a windchill of -14."
"Poured from the bottle into a belgian-style goblet. I wasn't sure what the proper glassware was for a scotch ale such as this, but this seems to work just fine. The color ranges from deep mahagony in the body to ruby red at the edges. It's a pretty looking ale, but it would be even prettier if the head hadn't been so thin and quick to dissipate. The nose is sweet and malty. Some prune and apple notes with hints of banana and maple syrup. Maybe some vanilla as well. Distant hints of black cherry. This is quite a tasty beer. The cherry makes a profound appearance here, hitting up front on the tongue. Subtler fruit flavors take over as the ale settles iin the mouth. I can definitely feel the heat here too. At 8.5% ABV, it's hard to hide, even with all the fruitiness. Malty banana floats around with prune, and a hoppy finish helps clear the palate in the finish. The complexity continues to expand as the beer warms up. An interesting ale, to be sure. The mouthfeel is a tad thinner than I would have imagined, but not weak. Overall, this is a tasty brew, though not one to be taken lightly. The high alcohol is present and noticeable, but not overpowering, and this badboy could really sneak up on a person. Split some skulls even, if they weren't careful."
"Drinkability: This is a brew with a deceivingly strong aroma and flavor, for it is surprisingly drinkable. However, the appearance of my bottle was borderline gross, and the smokiness borders too much on a Rauchbier for my taste. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Rauchbier every once in a while, but it seems unbalanced for this style."
"not much of a head to it, and it dies rather quickly has a fruity taste to it with no real distinction of a hoppy or maltness to it. alocohol stings the tongue but not in a bad way, very unique taste to it, the more i drink, the more fruits i can smell/taste, banana and apple especially"
"Opinion: This is a really tasty beer. I like that it is different from the typical Scottish Peaty Monsters. This beer scratches an itch on my palate that can only be satisfied by a Bock or Doppelbock. It has a defined maltyness and reserved hops and other fruitiness that makes it go down really refreshing and full flavored. This beer doesn't lack anything, and I would certainly drink it again."
"Very drinkable. Perfect for a warming session on a rainy winter's night. Should also appeal to any whiskey drinker, especially those who enjoy scotch. Very glad to have found this tasty treat, may have to take it head to head with some of the other wee heavy's available to me."
"Great addition to the style- dark amber pour, nice and cloudy. Sweet candied malt aromas with a little spice. Taste was all over the place- burnt sugary caramel, slight dried fruits and a hint of bitter hops; roasted biscuity deliciousness. Great drinkability- refreshing without sacrificing flavor or ABV!"
"Maybe it's sacrilege for me to say I enjoy scotch ales made in the U.S. more than scotch ales made in Scotland, but so far, that seems to be the trend. This beer definitely blows out McEwan's, upstages Moylan's Kiltlifter, and has a bit more bite to it than Alesmith's Wee Heavy, but for me, Founders Dirty Bastard really raised the bar (I wish I could find it out here) and this one, which definitely tasty, has some noticeable flaws. I see enough potential, however, where I may have to pick up one or two more and let them age for some time and see if I have better luck."
"D - I really enjoy this beer, but I couldn't drink more than two in a sitting. But a very good beer."
"Pours a sappy looking cognac amber. VSOP!!! Par head with very ambitious retention. Leaves a film on the glass. very thin and small. The aromas were that of an alcoholic biscuit elixir that would help a Skullsplitter before he goes into battle. The taste is a little syrupy with light bubbles tickling the front of my tongue. Some alcohol and hearty sweet malt bread hits in an almost gruel like fashion. The palate is a little resiny. Like tree sap sometimes."
"D- not high drinkability of course for the abv, but each small sip makes me want more and more. This is my ideal winter warming firesider! well done Orkney Brewery, a true world champion!"
"A well-balanced, smooth drinking wee heavy. The clarity of the ale is quite remarkable-- filtered? No matter, the malt complexity is a lot to wrap you mind aroundperhaps the origin of the skull splitter moniker."
"Overall, this was a very nice brew. It's hard to classify - a little smoky, and some belgian qualities. It's definitely not a typical Scotch Ale."
"Overall, a good beer that could be far better if the alcohol was not so overwhelming."
"So I was at dinner one night, and ordered a skullsplitter. Wow. It poured a beautiful dark brown, creamy head (just enough). First sip? It was so good I literally shed a tear. Rich, deep, flavor, malty sweetness followed by just enough hops to not be overbearing. Left a delicious, sweet aftertaste in my mouth. When I start brewing, this is what I want my beer to taste like. My favorite of all time."
"""Dangerously drinkable"" is definitely appropriate."
"Drinkability: A very nice beer. At 8% ABV, not a session beer, but it hides the alcohol well."
"The beer pours a nice brown body with a soft tan head sitting a top it. If held up to the light one can see carbonation. The aroma is full of sweeet malts and raisins slight hints of alcohol present also. The taste follows the aroma closely but with a more pronounced alcohol notes to it. Medium to thick body with no carbonation present and a warming alcohol to it. The beer leaves a lot of residual sweetness behind coating the tounge which isn't bad for this style. It's a good rendition of the style."
"Final thoughts: Well worth a try if youre adventuresome, or if youve a Viking fetish."
"Decent beer. High abv wouldn't be good for sessioning. I admit I need to figure out what makes these UK-based big beers taste similar. I want to be able to understand what it is I like about them so I can explain them better."
"It is on the high end of medium in body. Every sip of this beer explains why there are so many Belgian Scotch ales. What great brewer wouldn't want to adopt such a beer and let it become part of the family?"
"An exceptionally pleasant ale with the provision you had better like the taste of smoky Scotch. To me this is a VERY pleasant beer but I like smoky scotch. Probably the same reason that I love DFH Immort ale."
"Great stuff. Big and sweet. Caramel. Toasted malt. Twinge of tea? Very comforting. My skull feels massaged rather than split. I wish I bought more than one bottle. I can always go back..."
"Poured a deep, darker brown/auburn , with a frothy off-white head. Sweet and roasty malt aromas , light smoke , very slight dark fruit , burnt caramel. The taste is exellent. Rich, malty and complex , some slight burnt flavor ,caramel, sweet maltiness , bit of earthy hop bitterness , slight scotch, raisin, and a nice smokey finish. The mouthfeel is slick , creamy, and full. An exellent brew."
"A smooth drinking scotch ale, smooth medium plus mouthfeel. Muted smoke and fruit flavour. Appropriately average carbonation. Sweet malty finish. More drinkable than the style, more muted flavour. Good lacing. Alcohol spice aroma. Alcohol sledgehammer afterwards."
"D - Drinkable. This is a nice brew from Orkney, glad I had a chance to check one out."
"Skullsplitter was brown in color with a tan head. The aroma was of sweet malt and alcohol. The taste was on the sweet side, rich and malty, with noticable alcohol and a dry, warming finish. It is a full bodied beer with fairly low carbonation. This is a great beer. I will be sure to seek it out again."
"Overall impression: The smoke presence is appropriate given the style but I just don't dig it. Certainly won't knock off any points for personal tastes but if you don't like smokiness in your beer, you may not enjoy this. Still, a rock solid example of the style. Well crafted and perfect for a cloudy fall day. Probably would score better for me with some age. Recommended."
"I have seen this brew many times in the past years but never picked it up, so I included it in my mix-a-six pack this evening. Pours semi-dark, ruddy, brown color with not much of a head that vanishes quickly, but leaving behind decent lacing. Smells of oak, caramel, some sweet maltiness. Taste is of oakiness, much like the aroma...maybe even go as far as saying tobacco flavors. Caramel tones, sweet malts, some cherries hidden in the mix as well. Ends very dry and a major alcohol punch. This beer doesn't do a very good job masking the ABV. Alcohol warming lingers with you for a bit. Mouthfeel is mildy heavy bodied, slippery until the finish comes in and slaps you with dryness. Carbonation feels pretty low, small bubbles that tingle the tongue a tad...has that pilsner carbonation quality to it. I dont know if I could have more than one of these per session as it not really my style."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a nice sticky white head. A rum like alcohol smell is the first thing that comes to mind when it is first held up to your nose. Looking past that, there is also a lot of malt with some caramel. Mouthfeel is smooth and chewy. Taste is sweet and malty with a bit of caramel and a long warming sensation from the alcohol. Overall, this was really a pleasure to drink. I will purchase this again and would recommend anybody to try it."
"Taste is sweet and warming due to the alcohol. Smokiness is prominent, but hints of toasted bread, nuts, toffee, and caramel make up a good portion of the body. All around delicious."
"Notes: Stone chipotle smoked porter comes to mind. I'm not trying to say they are identical in the slightest bit. It does draw some similarities in the spices and mouthfeel but the skullsplitter is not as rich. A nice brew."
"A quick one. Basically you'll enjoy this beer if you enjoy warming, thick, malty brewa with a solid structure (not too sweet) that is balanced by a firm presence of alcohol. Just the right amount of carbonation and minimal aftertaste results makes this an outlandishly drinkable brew. I like this style quite a bit, so it's hard for me to rate these poorly, but I am sure this was one of the better Wee Heavies I've had so far."
"Overall, this is an outstanding beer. Ive only tried one other Scotch ale or wee heavy (McEwans), and this one is much better. Highly recommended."
"This is the best Scotch Ale that I've laid my hands on, so far. Really, really good and frighteningly easy to drink. I will definitely be drinking more of this, I'm only upset that I put off buying it for so long."
"Poured a nice brown with rich creamy head. However, the head quickly left and lacing was minimal. Smell was absolutely great. Caramel, alcohol, and a rich grape dominated the nose. Taste consisted mainly of caramel, amazing malt flavors, and some spices. Very little in the way of hops, but this seemed to work well with the complexity of the malts. Moutfeel was somewhat full-bodied, but almost syrupy. Definitely enjoyable."
"Pours dark red with a slight creamy head, decent carbonation. Smells are dominated by alcohol, slight sweet malts, and almost feet. Taste follows with strong malts, but the alcohol is way too prominent, almost reminiscent of vomit actually. Was expecting a much more balanced brew. Ah well, it did its job."
"Edit: Perhaps foolish of me to review this beer considering this was really the first time I tried the style, since then I've tried the style more In depth and have come to appreciate it more and this brew is examplary"
"Ordered this from a bottle at pub in Georgia. Didn't catch the freshness date on the bottle. 8.5% ABV. Poured a beautiful, dark reddish-brown color. Initial aromas and flavors of sweet grain, rounded out nicely with a touch of hops. Fairly strong flavors (as expected) from the alcohol. Light carbonation leads to a medium thickness. I prefer my Scotch Ales a little stronger, but this one won't disappoint. Excellent cold at the end of a long work day."
"D - A fine brew which is dangerously drinkable."
"Clear, dark ruby colour with almost a purple hue. Thin, beige head of small bubbles that left a smattering of fine, streaky lacing behind at each sip. Mild malty aroma (some caramel and toffee) with a dominant peaty, smokey character and some fruit. Low bitterness with a big, malty flavour - again with the caramel and toffee combination. Raisin and prune fruitiness comes through at the midpoint. Delicate peat and smoke linger in the finish. Medium/full bodied, low carbonation, smooth. This is a satisfying beer with decent complexity. A friend spoke highly of this beer after his trip to Scotland and now I know why."
"A very tasty Wee heavy. A little bigger and more aggressive than other beers I have had in this style."
"Very tasty and drinkable."
"Overall a good beer to enjoy now and then. Not one i would stock up on, but a nice change of pace. Has a very good malt character."
"looks heavy. red with a small head. heavy lacing contributes to its heavy alcohol appearance. Smells sweet and smoky and a little unwelcoming. Wow, very smoky flavor with alcohol on the finish. hickory and other wood tastes are the most dominant flavors.. some fruity flavors but i can't place them exactly. I want to say figs, but that seems strange for a beer and isn't quite right. Taste isn't too bad, although everyone else i was drinking with thought the whole thing was terrible. must be my scots blood. syrupy mouthfeel. ok drinkability but too alcoholic."
"This beer is golden brown in color with a good head and sweet aroma. The taste is at first toffee/caramel with a sublte hint of charcoal. Relaxes into a tasty beer throughout, with the alcohol copming on stronger at the end. A very good, long finish that I was able to savor for quite a while."
"Dgood, but not great. Another sipper for sure."
"Pours a beautiful amber-brown with a good looking tannish head. The head quickly dissipates, but leaves plenty of sticky lace. The smell is wonderful: Lots of sweet malt, some ripe fruit, a little yeast, and a hint of smokiness. Tastes very much as it smells: Lots of sweet malt, buttery-sweet caramel, some ripe fruit, and a smoky-peaty finish with a hint of hops that does a wonderful job of hiding all but a hint of alcohol in this. It is extremely smooth, creamy, and surprisingly very drinkable for the amount of alcohol. Along with Founder's Dirty Bastard this is one of the best Scotch Ales I've had!"
"Very very pleasant and drinkable."
"Good Scottish. I could go for another."
"Skullsplitter poured a brownish amber color with a small head that faded rather quickly. Aroma was malty with some hints of smoke in the nose. Taste was mainly sweet malt with some flavors of caramel, smoke, dark fruit and an earthy-peaty note in the finish. I could also detect some whiskeyish flavors and a little bit of alcoholic warmth. Mouthfeel was medium to light, which surprised me for a wee heavy of this strength. Overall a pretty good example of the style, but there are better examples available and at better prices."
"Not sure if I could drink another one of these...ever."
"Overall a drinkable Scoth Ale. ABV does not gey in the way."
"This was more of a joke as I tried it at a local pub. After recieving it I poured it out into a glass to reveal a dark blonde color with an aggressive thick head. The beer is strong. High % alcohol and you can taste it. The overall flavor of the beer is hoppy with a very mild and odd sweet tone. Its drinkable but in moderation."
"Ruby red to dark orange in color with a creamy head leaving some lacing. Strong toffee and caramel smell and even a bit of ripe fruit. Taste pretty much mimics the smell but I like the taste better than the smell. Medium to full body, with an average carbonation, creamy and smooth. Pretty drinkable, I'd probably have another."
"I like it!"
"Unfortunately, this stuff lives up to its name. There is *so* much sugar in this brew, one or two is all it takes to get a headache. Don't forget that water!"
"Overall - A excellent example of a wee heavy....Recommended..."
"good drinkability with lots of rich, but completely not harsh flavors. this is a straight shooting, no frills wee heavy that i'm really liking. fans of the wee heavy style put this at the top of your ""to drink"" list."
" now up and into the mouth. scent is mildly smoky, roasty,hints of alcohol and malt underneath. goes in smooth. tastes of a hop bitterness, although not overpoweringly so, certain dark maltyness, with a very dry finish that leaves a little smokiness in there to wisp about. It is a very nice version of this style. earthy and malty with a little tannin-like dryness in the end. A very nice ale, and certainly one of my favorite offerings of the Orkney."
"Taste; the peat comes out more strongly in the flavor than it does in the nose, very earthy. A little chocolate and caramel, as well as raisins and plums make a nice appearance, and there's almost no hop bitterness. Even though I could smell the alcohol, I was unable to detect any in the flavor at all. Mouthfell is medium bodied and very smooth, wih fairly low carbonation. If this had just a little less alcohol content, I could probably drink a four pack of these in one sitting."
"All in all highly recommended, but be warned it is a serious beer."
"CRUX: WELL MADE BOOZEY VIKING SIPPER GOES GREAT WITH STEAK."
"Overall, glad i grabbed a bottle to try. But prolly won't reach for it again anytime soon unless i see it marked down."
"D: Im a fan of it, but not a session beer. I could happily finish the first glass, but think there would be quite a bit of slowing down on the second."
"Quite a drinkable brew, definately recommended."
"This brew pours a dark brown color. The head is billowing and light tan in color. The aroma is of sweet caramel, butter and milk chocolate. The taste is of caramel, then chocolate, then caramel again. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with quite a bit of carbonation, perhaps too much. Overall, this is one of the best Scotch Ales I have ever tasted."
"The drinkability is fine, if I could find more I would have more."
"D: I don't know...I've never had the style before, but this beer doesn't exactly make me want to try others (though I bought a Robert the Bruce today too). I won't be reaching for it next time, but it is different and certainly worth a try."
" The taste is at first malted and hinted with mint or pine but quickly reveals a smoky character that controls the bulk of the flavor. I'm not as crazy about the smokiness and the stong alcohol note but this is still pretty fancy stuff. Mouthfeel is excellent and overall this is a distinctive beer worth an occassional pint."
"too sweet to drink very oftenm but a good complimentary beer. but tasty. needs some more balnce form the bitter end."
"Compacted blood with a head of stomped earth. Aromas of earth, roasted malts, a bit of smoke and some sweetness that is dark fruit like. Taste is similar. This one used to rock my palate into 2002, it was too intense for me than, but now it is smooth and delicous. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite nice, drinkability = good. This one is a worthy adversary."
"Nice malty smell wafting from this, improving as it sat. Tasted very nice, a chocolate and roast malt brew with a licourice tang. Nice mouthfeel, nice to swirl this beer about the palate. Very enjoyable."
"Poured this into my Chimay goblet. Nice caramel color that gave brilliant garnet and ruby colors when held to the light. A very thin head of lace that dissipates quickly. Coffee aroma from the cap and when the ale was in the bottle. Once poured in the glass the aroma was alcohol with a small hint of dried prunes maybe? Only a smidge of sweetness there. I kept trying to get a richer more peat-malt mouthfeel but I was only getting alcohol. Not sure if whiskey malt is an actual ingredient but I was tasting it. I had high hopes and I guess I was expecting SA's Scotch Ale with a kick. This ale finishes with a taste of sweet toffee when frothed before swallowing. The last few sips had an awesome buttery taste and Skullsplitter gets better when sipped slow and is allowed to sit and mellow. Strong out of the gate but mellows nicely as more subtle flavors begin to reveal themselves. Cheers"
"More caramel than I expected but wonderful nonetheless. Not my favorite in the style but I don't mind having this one a couple of times a year."
"Ruddy amber, small, reddish-tan head. Peat, whiskey malt, little oak, brown sugar, a little smoke, some yeast. Slightly fruity, rum and whiskey, sweetish, rich. Toasted edge amplifies towards finish. Smoke and peat increase as well. Finish is surprisingly bitter and toasty. Medium bodied, rich chewy feel. A very good Scotch ale."
"Awesome beer. But drink in moderation. This monster could easily cause some skull-splitting. This was a good one to share with a friend"
"Has a nince dark copper color, but had little to no head at all. This beer has been in my fridge for like 3 years. Clear with no hazing or sediment. Very complex aroma wow ! Strong abv noted in aroma. Aroma also has a complex blend of raisin and molasses. Slight cofee and smoke flavors also. I rarely give our 5's but there is so much going on with the taste and aroma I can't belive it. The mouthfeel gets more carbonated with each sip. The aroma smells like it has a high ABV but you cant hardly taste the alcohol. Very smooth finish. If only the appearance was better this beer might get all 5's.This is a great beer but at 8.5 I dont know how drinkable it is. Its unbelivable how they got 8.5 abv into a smooth light to medium body brew. The body seems very light for this type of beer. Sweet malts are noted on the finish with a touch of bitterness . No real hop aroma or taste. Awesome!"
"Pours a medium-dark reddish copper with a small, light tan, creamy head that slowly diminishes to a tenacious film. Some stringy lacing. The smell mostly of sweet malts. Alcohol esters, molasses, dark fruit. A little like a tawny port in a way. Taste-wise, there is some strong peat moss right off the bat that caught me off guard. Almost a little overpowering and distracting at first, but on the second taste when you know what to expect, its actually a rather pleasant smoky peat flavor, kind of like the flavor in a bottle of Laphroig scotch I have. Well balanced and a bit woodsy too. It has a medium body, syrupy and smooth, lightly warming, and low carbonation. This is not an every-day beer, but a very enjoyable one. An excellent choice when you feel like youre in a rut beer-wise. Worth trying for sure."
"Much more powerful than expected, this one will open your eyes  before shutting them for the night. The thin body will fool you into having more than <a couple>."
"Poured with a slight head, maybe 3-4 millimeters. Dissipated quickly, leaving very minimal lacing. Color is a fairly dark amber/brown with very little carbonation. Smell is fairly nutty, darkly fruity, and a little sweet (due to the fruitiness I imagine). Taste is very malty, with some sweetness, caramelly, very little alcohol sweetness. I expected more due to the 8.5%, but all in all its a good mixture of flavors. Sweet aftertaste with very little alcoholey warmth, but very smooth. Little carbonation adds to the overall smoothness. A good beer."
"Pours with no head to speak of, only very tiny carbonation occuring. Color is deep reddish-brown, lots of floating sediment/yeast throughout. Smells of sweet, carmelly and nutty malt, with a mild chocolate scent also. Tastes very sweet, with caramel malt flavors dominating. Finish is rather burnt/smoky but not overly alcoholic for 8.5%. Thickness is medium, carbonation is a bit low, but it works. Good smoothness. Not overly stimulating but well-rounded enough to increase its drinkability. A decent strong scotch ale."
"Pours a deep amber with thick, full-bodied head. The smell is amazing...raisens, dates caramel dominate but it has a smokey flavor as well. The taste is also very solid...bold and full of flavor. The caramel notes are most present but I can taste molasses and sweet fruits as well. Mouthfeel is only hampered by strong carbonation. Overall, I could drink this all night long"
"Pours dark chestnut with some amber highlights when held the light, head was moderate in a tulip and didn't last long for me. Nose was faint with raisins and pepper. Taste was unexpectedly smooth and easy drinking for the abv, no real indication of the alcohol other than a slight peppery feel long after the swallow. Tastes range from raisins to sweet molasses with malt being the dominant factor by far. Overall a very nice and well done brew, easy to drink and quite warming....I'd have this again."
"A nice beer to finish off a day of conquering a village."
"Body is medium to big with fuzzy, micro-bubbled carbonation and a very smooth and chewy mouthfeel. Intensely malty and noticably strong abv make one bottle enough at a time."
"great brew, but i can't imagine drinking more than one. richer than an alfredo sauce; perfect to finish a cold winter's evening."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It is slightly hard to find, and costs a little bit more than your average beer, but it is worth the search and the extra buck. Take it slow; the alcohol can sneak up on you. Skullsplitter is good, definitely check it out."
"Pours a slightly murky deep amber with a nice tan head that retains well for a beer of 8.5%. The aroma kicks it up a notch with a nice caramel and molasses sweetness, peat smoked malt, toasted bread, ripe dark fruits (fig plum and grape), floral hops and some alcohol. The taste again starts off with molasses and caramel sweetness, followed by some smoked peat, light floral hops, dark fruits (grapes, plums and dates), esters, and some mild ethanol. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and the drinkability is incredible. I was quite impressed by this brew, it was complex and seemed quite authentic, and yet was incredibly smooth and drinkable. Highly recommended."
"D: Good night. Doesn't so much split the skull as lull you into a warm slumber with its easily drinkable warmth."
"1-26-2013 UPDATE: Cracked one open that's been in my cellar for about 1 1/2 years. The flavor has really taken off. Nice sweet malt, chewy. Its sweetness is constant and continual. The hops are gone or at least turned to more of an earthy quality. Smoke is gone, too. What's left is a robust, sweet, and darn fine brew. Some leather and hazelnut come and go. Very nice"
"Pours a dark and clear mahogany color with a white foamy one finger head that fell to light lacing. Smells rich of smoked wood, nearly a mesquite aroma along with sweet burnt sugars and alcohol present as well. Heavy line of malt also notable in the scent, smell has slight notes of caramel and toffee, chalking up to the sweet nose. Tastes smoky and malty, finishing sweeter and slightly oily slick on the tongue. Bites hard initially and finishes sweet and smooth. Overall a complex strong ale, enjoyable, drinks lighter than 8.5% abv, would purchase again."
"this beer is very good and drinkable but i think best enjoyed on a cool night."
"Rich and smooth, this beer is absolutely quaffable despite it's inherent sweetness."
"Drinkability: A complex and enjoyable Wee Heavy"
"Cheers!"
"I only wish I had bought more. This one will be on the shopping list for next time."
"Very full mouth with some oils but the carbonation keeps that in check."
"All in all, this is a good brew. It didn't have any particularly standout qualities - it doesn't have a really loud personality - but it's tasty. A worthwhile treat."
"D: Very drinkable for an 8.5% beer. Where is it hiding that alcohol?"
"Drinkablity: The overall effect is just too overstated. I remember a much better cask version years ago (92ish)"
"At first sip you get deep dark ripe fruit accompinied by grilled malt glazing the buds. Finishes soft malty bittter on the mouthfeel with almost a waxy feel. Breaks down a little on the end and reveals a harder liquer, maybe cheap port. Kind of sharp but enjoyable overall."
"pours a dark ruby/garnet brown with a thin head that leaves plenty of lace on the glass. The aromas are a little chalky, almost cardboard with a slight peat smell. The beer has a gripping mouthfeel that hangs in and aroud the tongue and gums. Flavors of slightly peaty malt, smokey, nutty and with a fair amount of dry hop aftertaste. I can taste some alcohol notes after the finish with more smokey flavors lasting long after swallowing. Interesting beer."
"Taste: almost just as it smells. starts you off with a nice sweet; quickly after you notice the roasted flavors comming through. finishes off with a very pleasing after taste."
"Pours a dark brown with garnet highlights. Scattered light tan head across the surface. Pungent malty aroma has an unappealing sourness to it. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, smooth and soft. Skullsplitter is an odd tasting Scotch Ale. Rich malty flavor with a prune-like fruitiness. But the taste has a funky sour, bitterness to it. The alcohol leaves a dry finish on the tongue. With all the high marks, this was disappointing."
"A solid Wee Heavy directly from the country it originates."
"With a name like skullsplitter, I didn't know what to expect. Hopefully the name isn't an indication of what to expect in the morning. Poured out to a deep cherry color with a nice dense head and lower carbonation. Aroma of alcohol and sweet bread dough go well together. The taste is good for a wee heavy; all the elements are here. Carmel, roasted malt, alcohol, some grain. Very well made. Mouthfeel was a touch syrupy and thick, but remained smooth and easy flowing. Drinkability is decent, as I don't think this beer would be great all the time. When looking for a good example of the wee heavy style, this should be your starting point."
"This is an exceptionally tasteful Scotch ale. Pours a deep ruby brown with a generous long lived tan head that left sheets of lacing on the thistle glass I used to drink this puppy. Aroma of malt and humus/peat. Taste was earthy and buttery with sweet malt and peaty /smoky notes short bitter finish. Mouth feel was slick and and persistently oily. Very drinkable."
"Pours a dark, almost opaque porterish brown, with a finger of dark tan bubbly head. Nose is pungent and earthy - peat moss, smoked wood and dark fruits. Flavor profile is as formidable as its name - again the smokey, earthy, woody character, along with caramel malts, and a hearty helping of dark, dripping prune and fig. There's definitely some RIS or Baltic Porter in this one. I've never had a Wee Heavy with those dark fruit notes like this. Mouthfeel is substantial, the alcohol makes its presence known but doesn't ovewhelm. This is a very unique and potent Scotch Ale unlike any I've had before. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, this is a good beer, one that I am very happy I've tried. Four dollars a bottle is a bit steep, though, so it may be awhile before I start buying these regularly."
"A pretty decent Scottish ale, but overall forgettable."
"D-At 8.5%, the beer does have a kick to it. So, I wouldn't expect people to drink many of these in one sitting. It is very nice sipping beer, much like any Scotch Ale should be. Very good in my opinion; I would definitely buy this one again."
"M&D. Beer comes across as being a little flat. At 8.5 ABV, it goes down pretty easily."
"Another strong and malty beer. Has a lot of Dopplebock characteristics with it. Aromas of molassas and malt. Flavors of the same with deep figs, dates, and raison flavors. Perhapse some chocolate and smoke flavor added. Light bittering from roasted grains. Though good flavors, it has a burned flavor to me that is a bit harsh and unpleasant. The alcohols remain sweet and tame for an 8.5%er. Alcohols become a bit sherry-like and didn't completely agree with style. Stays creamy and heavy. A good winter warmer."
"poured a crystal clear deep ruby color with modearte tannish head. Smell is magnificient with caramel, molasses, dark ripe fruit present. Almost a wine-like smell. Taste is big time malt with mich sweetness. Caramel, molasses, dark cherries abound. Finishes with a bit of dryness to balance out the sweetness. It also will ot let you forget that there is alcohol present. This is a rich lush brew that is very drinkable for 8.5% alcohol. Also has a nifty label."
"Pours a solod dark tea color with ruby highlites. A very small head falls a patchy coat over top. Nose is pretty sweet raisiny with a nice smoky background. Nice ballance, but with a definate fruity sweetness in there. Flavor is definately smokey. The sweetness from the nose is definately subdued. I like the flavor a lot. Feel is thick with a moderate carbonation. Very drinkable brew. No real hint of the 8.5%. I enjoy it a lot."
"Very much a slow sipping winter beer. The smoky peat may be a little bit of an acquired taste."
"Not very drinkable as it is a bit too sweet."
"This beer sits a ruby, deep amber color in my glass. It is topped by a frothy, thinnish pale brown head. The aroma is nice and malty with notes of toffee, caramel, a rich concentrated malt note and a bit of cherry. The beer is sweet throughout, though in no way sticky, and it has a medium body to it that is light enough to not be too chewy. This has nice notes of chewy toffee, some notes of molasses, a bit of chocolate and dark malt in the finish. This beer has a nice richness to it, but is still somewhat easily drinkable. This is pretty tasty, purely a complex malty beer, that is nice to slowly sip on."
"This reminds me more of a strong pumpkin beer or an English Brown Ale than a Wee Heavy. That said, this is actually FROM Scotland, so maybe this is what a Scotch Ale is supposed to be like. All I know is, there isn't a whole lot in common between American Scotch Ales like Robert the Bruce, Dirty Bastard, or Warped Speed and Skullsplitter. It isn't chocolatey or hoppy in the least, and I consequently don't like it as much as the previously mentioned American interpretations."
"Pours out a dark brownish red color with a tall light tan head that leaves a light coating of lace on the glass. Rich smoky and fruity flavor with a good amount of chocolate malt. The sweetness seems well balanced by the smoke and earthiness. More smoky earthy flavors start this off before sweet fruit notes come through. Light chocolate and caramel malt mix in. The alcohol seems pretty much hidden under all the malty layers. Sweet smoky finish with a touch of fruit. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A bit thinner than it should be for such a full flavor though. Extremely drinkable stuff that I could drink plenty of in a sitting. A great all around brew."
"4 pack or however these are sold (I got mine at a bar - $4)."
"Kind of like an amped up MacEwans"
"Blech!"
"very enjoyable on a cool fall evening."
"Very nice, firey reddish/brown hue to it. Decent enough carbonation level but no head. Average aroma-faint coppery or metallic smell. Big malt flavor. Smoky with a somewhat perfumey sweetness. No bitterness is perceived. Almost a passing astringency in the finish. Good body. Very nice wee heavy that can be dangerously drinkable. Well worth enjoying."
"Got in a bottle and just popped it open. Very amber in color with hardly any head whatsoever. I tried to pour a head but nothing. It dissipated after the first couple sips. The aroma doesn't really do the taste justice. Smells good but the taste is out of this world. Very smokey and well balanced with slight hops. It's almost like drinking a campfire. There is lots of body to chew on. Carbonation is good. Overall a very fine beer."
"Pours deep auburn with an inch head that quickly dissipates. Smell is fantastic, smells like a nice oaked chardonnay blended with caramel malt. There's a slight hint of alcohol. Tremendous malt malt flavor assaults the palate from the start. Deep roasted, caramel, slightly smoky. Some nice wine notes. Hops are there to balance but little more, it dries out a bit and finishes quite bitter(otherwise it'd be terribly cloying), grainy, and lingering. Very very tasty. Body is medium full and palate coating with medium carbonation. Alcohol is perceived mainly in warmness. I'm drinking this too quickly."
"Overall a very drinkable brew. I was really impressed. It echoes autumn to me and I really enjoyed it. I am considering buying an entire case just to cellar it."
"Pours a deep reddish purple brown with a thin finger of fizzy white head that quickly subsisides to the thinnest of rings. Nose is a big rich roasted caramel with a slight note of alcohol and maybe the slightest hops note. Taste is a wonderful smokey oak-like flavor with dashes of caramel and roasted malt. Spicey hop finish and just the slightest note of alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick, smooth, and creamy. This is an excellently flavorful strong ale, great for sipping."
"Sadly, it arrived with a Tennents Lager glass, which looked like it had spent most of its life in a dishwasher. Also, the label indicated it was right on its use by date. This aside, poured deep garnet with a fairly good light brown tightly packed head. Aroma was butterscotch, caramel and just the faintest whiff of hops. These aromas also came out in the flavour with a slightly bitter finish preventing them from being cloying. The 8.5% ABV was only very subtly noticable. Mouth was reasonably soft and creamy, carbonation was about right. This is a definitely a beer for a cold winters night, not to cool down after a long overheated march. Note to self, taste it again in the right circumstances."
"I don't know what to make of this here beer. It's worth a try, I guess, but I'm really underwhelmed."
"Slàinte!"
"D-This beer lives up to its name. It has a great malt base but no notes of alcohol. It is complex but not overpowering with the malt and a nice hop finish that is faint but helps to support the malt."
"Drinkability - After a big glass of water I could definitely drink another, its taste is interesting and has a lot of character that makes it a brew worth examining. It is very rare that I say this about a strong and sweet beer, but 11.2 oz just isn't enough to assess it fully. Since It is so powerfully drying, I am docking it. All and all a great beer I will want to have another time."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a rich and creamy malt scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It's sweet and toastey and slightly warming. The taste is great also. It has a very smooth, malty flavor that boasts of crystal, roasted, and peated malts. It has a nice smokey character that mellows the elevated abv. . The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an awesome beer. I love everything about it. One of the top wee heavy beers out there."
"another couple of these and someone's skull would have been split (exactly who no one will know)"
"Notes: Easily available from several locations in Columbus. I recommend it to scotch ale drinkers."
"Well, it's beer, you know? A nice dark color, little head, huge malty nose and mouth, no hops to speak of, not much of an aftertaste. Still... I dunno, I get a big raisin flavor out of it and it seems that someone may have done at least part of the mash at a temp that was a wee bit high - in the middle of the mouth there's an interesting dry rasp across the tongue. It's a bit overpowering in general - I mean, it'd be hard for me, with this much flavor going on, to drink more than one..."
"This beer is growing on me with each sip. My initial reaction was, whoa, way too much residual sugar. But I like how the hop catches up with the beer. Perhaps it's the 8.5% alcohol content (which is quite muted by the flavors), but more likely, it's the nice balance in the aftertaste."
"For those who like an all-malt type of beer, you can't go wrong here. A terrific exaple of the Scottish ale-wee heavy style. As good as the Belhaven or the Alesmith (two beers I love). This is SO malty! Warming and smooth, good for what ails you! I had this before, but must have forgot to review it. Just arrived in a terrific local specialty store (thanks, Micro man!)."
"Pours dark caramel plus brown with off- white head Smells of sweet raiseny smoky things. Tastes a little sweet with roast and smoked malts, but nicely restrained. Nicely restrained hops as well. Complex malt flavors. Really nicely well done. Feels smooth and slick in the mouth with slight alcohol burn. I have to be careful how man of these I drink, because damn... it would be easy to have more than a few...."
"Drinkability - Very Smooth. The alcohol is well hidden. Great taste, can be downed quickly if not careful. That said, this should be sipped and enjoyed. Very good, will drink again"
"D - The well disguised alcohol coupled with the very wide taste profile on this one makes it disturbingly easy to quaff (and ponder) despite the big ABV. Delicious!"
"Has well hidden 8.5% ABV Wee Heavy. Most drinkable."
"The taste is fruity and malty with breaks of alcohohic flavor. I think the aftertaste was somewhat hoppy, and, mildly salty (a new one). It finishes with more alcohol in the bottom of the glass. I like the scotch ale. It's good."
"Cask conditioned at the 32nd Cambridge Beer Festival, gravity dispense. Dark reddish brown colour. Complex aroma of dark fruits, spices and oak, various woodwork, some chocolate. Flavour is spicy, oaky, malty, chocolate, theres vinous qualities (old sherry, marsala). Nutty / dusty hops finish. A great beer!"
"Overall, one i had tried a few years back due to the bottle being cool looking, but one I have tried again due to remembering that I rather enjoyed it!"
"This is a clear, brown beer with a slight redness. The head is a very light tan, about 1/2"" tall. It smells very good. There is a sweet malty aroma with a little vanilla. The taste is good but nothing special. I expected more flavor, it seems a little watered down. There is an odd flavor, this might be an old bottle. The mouthfel is a bit too thin."
"Drinkability - A very rich beer that like its namesake is not to be reckoned with lightly. It's as high in flavor and character as it is in alcohol. Loved it and will be purchasing more."
"A good beer, but at $13 a 4 pack, not an everyday drinker. A great special occasion beer."
"Goes well with some aged Irish cheddar and rye crackers."
"Try this as an after dinner drink during the holidays."
"The aroma put me off a little but I love a good BBQ and this beer is like a good BBQ."
"It poured with a surprisingly big head and had that nice mid dark dense body. The nose was pure malt and peat and was a thing of beauty. This beer is a big bad Scottish ale with an inherent smoothness that makes you want to slow down and think about each sip. Excellent and very original."
"The taste is yet again reminiscent of an ESB. Me brethren and I were feeling ESB impressions. The two styles may be yet too undifferentiated for my fledgling palate. Guesswork during the tasting told me: old ale/ ESB / wee heavy. Wee heavy seems to be the official, so I can advocate that nomination. As far as imported brew, this one has the best taste I have encountered thus far in my travels. Massive caramel malts punch in at the first shift. Their sweet tones lend heavily to the overall components. This crystal coated sugar flavor is the most dominant of all. Very clandestine hop flavors creep in to add accents, but never proclaim any authority. The finish remains smooth and sweet, non-bitter. I must say this old boy is quite tasty. Delightful toasty accents. No alcoholic overtones, just a sweet sipper with capabilities to split ones skull the f*ck open. Very robust and overpowering sweetness makes this a good drinker, but less than superb. A very good rep of the wee heavy style. No import off flavors which is the ultimate wink and nod for this old boy. A nice Celtic love juice to get loose. Cheese infested label and all. Arrrr!!! I'll slop up to this mofo again."
"This is a dark red brownish colored brew that is leaving a nice lacing down my glass. Nose is of caramel malts and somewhat peaty. Taste is very smooth and complex. A heavy dose of malts greets you with some hints of dark fruits in the background with a nicely slight dry hopped finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and wonderfully smooth. High ABV is well masked. This is a finely crafted brew!"
"Mouthfeel, appearance and taste all outdo the smell. Therefore, we have to take points off of the balance,hence not a very good one. This cripples the promise of the Orkney's, being a Iron Age Europe stronghold and all, known for its Celtic associations, nevertheless those pertaining to beer. Still, the taste has orange peel notes, as well as maple, coffee and caramel undertones and a slight hint of cinnamon. Cloves? No. That bitterness is coming from the coffee blending with the caramel, methinks."
"I've seen the 4 packs of SkullSplitter for over $11 dollars. I wouldn't pay that much for it--(a friend gave me one)--but it's pretty damned good."
"I'm happy to get my skull split any old time."
"SkullSplitter is aptly named. It isn't a 'float like a butterfly, sting like a bee' kind of beer, but more of a 'rush the bastard and plant an axe between his eyes' kind of beer. That isn't entirely fair, it's more refined than that, but it is on the straightforward end of the Scotch ale spectrum. This is a beer that I'll be sure to look for again."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Body is a deep, rich reddish brown, topped by a half-inch coffee-colored head that subsides pretty quickly. Initially I thought it smelled pretty nasty, like spilt lager, but after those esthers wore off, a nice pleasant aroma emerges. Sweet notes of dark fruit (dates? prunes?), brown sugar, roasted malt, and alcohol. Palate is rich and complex. A rich malty base is accented by a molasses-like sweetness, with a significant alcohol presence on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, velvety, and a tad foamy, depending on how big your sip is. An interesting brew, originating from one of the most remote and mysterious locations on Earth."
"This beer is way to strong for me. I prefer the Belgian strong ales."
"I'm glad I finally decided to give this brew a try."
"Drinkability- A very interesting beer. Many little nuances all in this little beer. At 8.5 it's pretty drinkable. To bad the lack of smell and appearance brings down the beer a bit. Pretty tasty."
"Medium sized, dense, light brown colored head doesn't last long, but leaves some specs of lace. Deep mahogany colored beer with a caramel hue. Mildly sweet caramel aroma with a bit of malt and pinch of wine. Some chocolatte, dark fruit, and some roasted malt in the flavor. Finish is kind of cocoa bitter. Body doesn't seem very thick. There's a burst of carbonation up front, but the beer becomes watery towards the end. The carbonation seems a bit off and there's a strange vinuous aroma hiding in there, but otherwise the beer is pretty nice."
"Wow, that is tasty. Its been years since i've had a skull-splitter and its much better than I even remember. Major malt complexities and ample but refined hop presense make this immensely drinkable with no hint at the almost 9% ABV. I'd really like to see what this does with age."
"Pours a deep, rich brown with a hint of red. Good head, tight & firm with some scattered lace. Smell is malty sweet, smoke, peat, nutty with a hint of oak barrel to it. Taste is oakey, malty, smoky, roasty, with a peaty presence and a kind of whisky flavor to it. Alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms but not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel is smooth, rich, creamy, full-bodied and warming the back of the mouth and throat. Drinkability is very high. The 8.5% ABV limits you but the great flavor, balance and complexity command you to drink this hearty brew like a good Viking should."
"popped the cap with pretty decent fizz. poured with a good amount of co2 escaping into a head that doesn't quit until the last drop and brillantly clear amber color. for the life of me i can't detect a damn thing in the aroma, not sure if it's an off day or what. I do get a faint hint of caramel with a bit of alcohol. gotta admit that the body and taste of this beer was a bit of a let down, I was hoping for a little more thicker malt character and a decent ""scottish"" taste/aroma. seems pretty balanced and maybe a bit on the old side. still if it isn't a very nicely balanced beer and nothing really extraordinary about it."
"Yes, I will be putting this into my rotation."
"Superb!"
"Literally, one of the first craft brews I ever had and haven't had it in years. While initially disappointed, the Skullsplitter did not forsake me and still can deliver the goods."
"11.2 ouncer, nice red foil and Viking photo on label. This fine brew pours dark caramel/almond, with a white head and leaves a bit of loose lacing. Nose is peat, must, and wiskey. Full bodied, sticky,tasty, warming and rich. This brew has alot of character, flavor and complexity. Alcohol notes. Caramel,vanilla, wiskey, leather, anise all noted. Alot of brew personality in a small package. Enjoyable strong ale from Scotland."
"drinkability: very good! maybe not a session beer, but this beer had a complex fruity, malty, taste, that was fairly balanced, I thought it was delicious, and would DEFINITELY warm you on a cold night, good stuff!"
"Smooth mouth-feel with fairly strong carbonation. Very drinkable for a beer with 8.5% ABV, though I wouldn't want to drink too many or too quickly."
"(11.2 oz / 330ml)"
"I was somewhat surprised at this beer, only because of it's wacky label. I was expecting something like Bezelbuth (shudder) and instead got something like St Bernardus. This beer poured into a wine glass had a rich reddish brown color and a soft head of yellow tan that had average retention. Smell was of carmelized sugar, plum, and raisin, faint breath of alcohol. The taste is immeadiately smooth and satisfying with a massive dose of malt. Not as spicy as some Scotch ales, this had exceptional depth in its fruit flavors, the esters tasting mostly of raisin, fig, plum with a heavy sweetness of carmel. Alcohol is noticeable, but nicely suited to the beer. This is a great after dinner sipper, and a surprisingly tasty beer despite the cheesy Viking."
"I can't imagine drinking more than one or two of these in a sitting, because 1. it's so strong and heavy and 2. it's freakin' expensive. I paid $8.99 for four 11.2 oz. bottles. What's up with that, anyway? You don't think we deserve the extra .8 ounces? I shalt dispatch thee to Valhalla! Er, wait, isn't Valhalla like heaven for Vikings? Whatever... good beer, drink sparingly, etc."
"This is a very good beer, with a price that matches. Seek it out. I'd love to visit this brewery, too. They look like they're in a fabulous location."
"Pours a deep rust color, no lacing. Tastes malty, with a nice raisin undertone, with a bit of dried fruit as well. Warming alcohol present. It really tastes almost like a thin barleywine. Not a bad beer, one I'd return to every once in a while, if it was't $2.50 for such a small bottle."
"Pours deep, deep brown, near black, not much head, 1/4"" at most. Smells very woody, mostly piney, like sawdust almost. Taste is very strong and complex. A strong raisin/berry flavor combines with piney hops, slightly sweet malt, that finishes with an alcohol burn. Definitely a different kind of beer. Worth $2.99 for an 11.2 oz bottle? n Not quite, but still good."
"i like this beer, and i get it a couple times a year to remind me how unique and tasty of a brew it is."
"Skullspitter was served from a 330ml bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a gorgeous deep ruby color, and was topped by a thin off-white head. The nose presented a rich set of aromas, including late-harvest grape, rye bread, Worcestershire sauce, raisin, sharp molasses, and a nice musty woodiness that held it together. Tasting the beer revealed a figgy-raisin roasted malt profile that pleased the tastebuds with accents of nutty-scotch and a subtle peat smokiness. The finish was lightly bittered with woody dry flavor. The flavors were well balanced and satisfying, and the alcohol remained completely hidden throughout. This rich ale was exceptionally smooth, with an appropriately full body. Skullspitter is a solid, well-crafted beer that was a delight to drink. I think Thorfinn Hausakluif would approve of his namesake brew."
"Overall, an excellent beer."
"Thick feel, chewy and leaves a lacing behind in the gullet that only requests more."
"Deep copper brown color and a good two finger sized head underlain by medium carbonation made this an attractive looking beer. The aroma was roasty and sweet chocolate malts and faintly grassy hops. The sweet fruity taste had notes of apples, melons, toffee, and pears, the hops were floral and spicy, and the yeast provided earthy accents, however the emphasis was primarily on malt here. The overall taste was very similar to a Belgian Dubbel, except the hops are a bit stronger here, and the beer lacked the dusty powdery yeast that marks the Dubbles. The mouthfeel was medium thick, and had a mouth coating stickiness. The beer was quite drinkable despite being on the big side. A very good treat for all the maltmouths out there."
"The beer contained within the bottle, however, is not at all simple... Skullsplitter is perhaps the preminant example of a Scotch ale. Thick, dark amber, with a low, lacing head. Big caramel malt with peaty, smokey, scotchey undertones. Slight bitterness only to balance the malt. A beer to be savored."
"Amazing that they have bottled all things savory that I love into one bottle. The deep, rich color is the first hint of the complexity and pleasure to come. The caramel maltiness is intoxicating even without the impressive 8.50% alcohol. It's everything I love in a beer...and a handsome viking on the label only adds to its attraction! I'm glad I took my Beer Guy's advice and tried it."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep red, almost opaque color with three fingers of light tan head. There is a bit of lacing. The smell is malt, malt, and more malt. Has one of the most powerful malt aromas I've ever encountered. Sweet caramel and alcohol linger with lightly toasted barley. The taste is also very malty, but not overpowering at all. Toffee and caramel flow smoothly across the tongue, some nuttiness in there as well. Tiny touches of alcohol and hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is decently strong for a scotch ale. The drinkability is very good, it's hard to believe that this is 8.5%, even with the intimidating name! The Scots got it good."
"Poured a deep reddish-brown brew with a white head that subsided quickly. Aroma was of smoke and alcohol with very little else. flavor was creamy begining with rich carmelized malt flavors which segues into a slight smoky flavor to finish with a definite alcohol presence. This beer is stron and it is ment to be savored while enjoying the slower things in life as it is too strong to drink and still be able to function at too many tasks."
"How's that for splitting your skull?"
"This is a rich, delicious brew. A bit like a barleywine, but it definitely reflects the unique character of the island. Enjoy it, but don't piss it off."
"For the sake of my skull, though, I plan to visit this brew at well-spaced intervals."
"Not as full in the mouth as I would have liked. Alcohol is hidden very well. Just a very good beer."
"The head is big, densish, tan, fine, doughy. Implosions cause an uneven collapse. Very appealing. The beer is a gorgeous, clear, deep red. There are waves of nice, fine carbonation. Fine, spotty, sheety lacing. I feel like this is almost too beautiful to drink. But now I'm over it. Fresh bread! in the nose. Sweet, bready toffee. Yum. Wow: smoke in the front, with toffee and alcohol. Butter and smoke in the middle, with sweet malt underneath. Sweet, ripe fruit in the finish, with obvious alcohol. Smoky aftertaste. This is a very interesting beer: smoky, but sweet malt and acres of butter. Very fine, smooth feel. Intense. Good."
"This is a unique beer and very satisfying to drink despite the stupid label that features a guy with a sword who looks like my evil twin."
"-Oelergud"
"An eggshell-white colored head fades quickly after the pour to a short collar around the glass which does not cling well. A good many streamers are present, but hard to see through the burnished chestnut murk, a dark ""woodsy"" color that, when held to light, glows bronze-approaching-garnet. Wow does this smell malty! and woodsy/smoky, like burning toffee or charred raisin skins... the smells become less bitter and more sweet with time and warmth, approaching frosted cereal grains and grape (?)--almost smells more like a doppelbock than a scottish ale... nosefeel expands in the alcoholic finish. Flavor starts out intensely smoky before being balanced out by a strong malt backbone... overall suggestions of maple syrup, charred oak, barley hulls, a touch of earth, and alcohol. Mouthfeel gets mealy with warmth (or swishing around inside of mouth) but remains a bit fizzy. Finishes dry enough to make you say ""whew"" after each sip. The more of this I drink, the more I enjoy it (serve warm) and the booziness it brings on. Highly recommended for fans of scotch whisky; others might want to stay clear."
"--Joey"
"My second visit with this beer doesn't change my rating but it did add a very strong smoky flavor that was muted on my first taste, probably due to the barbecue that I was eating. It is a very nice malty smokiness that I should have been aware of."
"Poured a nice brown with a decent sized off white head. This beer just smells malty. Huge notes of malt with a small hint of alcohol. There isn't really much alcohol evident in the taste. This was a lot sweeter than I expected but the sweetness was balanced well buy hints of nut. This isn't the thinnest of beers and I enjoy having it on occasion, It's just not something that I need every week."
"Overall- Much better 2nd time around. 1st time my palatte was still too young. Although this is a tad thick and sweet for me. Its worthy."
"A stern pour resulted in a huge chunky almost white head over a slightly ruddy brown body. The aroma was strong and featured toffee, caramel, and a bit buttery at times. Powerfull malts, butterscotch and toffee with a touch of hops to mellow out the sweetness. Very drinkable despite the high ABV and almost syrupy mouthfeel."
"SkullSplitter really grows on me as it opens up. Mouthfeel is pretty light, which works for this one. I like this beer alot and I could imagine it going great with some game bird and flat bread to complete my viking delusion."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, hearty inch+ tall tan colored head formed on top of a clear copper hued brew. Excellent lacing, after swirling it justs hangs on the sides of the glass. Malty, malty aroma, with slight tinge of alcohol. A surprise of smokiness jumps out at my taste buds from the get-go. A bit maltier in the taste than the color and clarity and aroma were indicating. Can taste the higher alcohol in there, but it's not like it hits you over the head. Rather, it just slips on by, the only real indication being the warming trend after swallowing. What I expected from a Scottish brew, and more."
"The taste is quite exquisite with beautiful strong caramel and malt flavors. The alcohol taste is robust and hearty. If this is what the vikings drank, well then I wana be a viking! AAAARRRGGGHHH"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"11.2oz/330ml bottle here. Label says Skullsplitter was the 7th Laird of Orkney. Pours a clear cherrywood brown with an ample tan head that eventually fades to some patchy and sheet lace. Aroma is big caramel malt in the foreground, with fireplace ash and a hint of alcohol behind. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy and has minimal carbonation. Taste is caramel and smoke, with a moderate hop bitterness. Alcohol is well concealed in the taste until it sneaks in near room temperature. The smokiness lasts all the way through and is quite pleasant. There are also notes of pipe tobacco. Finishes mildly sweet with a smoky aftertaste. An excellent Scottish style Strong Old Ale that is a pleasure to sip."
"Poured ruby color with a small head and rather thick lacing on the sides. the smell was of a lot of sweetness with hints of peet. And that was what the initial taste was also. Lots of fruit flavor and some roasted malts, But as it wormed up it upened like a flower and got fuller on the tongue. It turned more hoppy and alittle woody and ultimately a strong alcohol flavor came through. I like it....a lot. go thor"
"Pours a nice bit of head. Not alot, but a nice bit. It has some head. Not much, but some. Pours a very dark copper colr, with a bit of head, not much, but it is def. there. The lacing goes through and through to the end, and it is a ncie bit a astetic compltement. It really has no reall hop profile, but the alchohol/ malt balance makes this a nice little brew, it has a good representation of the wee heavy variety, ad, should be drank ona regular basis for a good rep of the stley."
"Edit to add: After seeing the other beers in this category, esp AVBC's Winter Solstice and Double Bastard, I had to lower my score somewhat. Sorry."
"Bloddy chestnut hue, thin head. A beauty of a nose! Raisins, cotton candy, sweet fruit, grapes, plums all found here. Up front, this is big and bold, not to be messed with. Intimidating. Smokey, charcoal notes, aggressive caramel flavoring, with massive belly warming. Meaty, near 'beef-stick' flavoring, definite full bodied beer, with a hint of alcohol noticed throughout. Big, hearty and in yer face. Take note, don't mess with this beast!"
"Have to love the romance novel esque label on this one in any case. :-)"
"The taste is a little bitter with a roasted taste leaving a warm feeling behind. It's a nice beer and if you have to many you will feel the skull splitter..."
"the appearance doesn't impress too much. seems to have a lazy head. smell is very interesting. mild sweet and a tart apple smell almost like cider. very fruity smell. o.k. time to take a drink. hmm...very complex. like nothing i've ever had. carbonation is the first thing that i feel going on. this swells into tart fruity flavors that soon vanish and a nice alcohol warmness soon follows all the down. very complex but doesn't suit my tastes. very glad that i tried it though. i'll highly recommend this but, one was enough for me."
"A simply amazing old ale...probably one of the best in the world. A very rich and delicious malt and hop mix, and I can see why this is a favorite of Sapphire's owner. This beer is certainly one I'll have in the future."
"Drinkability is tough. Because it is such a rich flavorful beer, it would be hard for me to consume more than one, or two, at a time. I really enjoyed this beer and would recommend it to others."
"t's a beer that crosses in flavor between Scotch and Brandy if you can imagine. Sweet, but not overly so, with a touch of roasted nut flavor under the fruitiness that isn't dominated by the alcohol, which is very present with a content of 8.5% per volume. It has a nice dark amber color with a thick white head that dissolves quickly. The aroma is full of malty goodness, rich and sweet with the absence of the sharp hoppy bouquet that tends to reside in stronger beers. Mouth feel is thick and a bit warm, leaving only a hint of sweetness on your lips and a quickly fading malty after taste. The overall effect made me think of green apples with a kick. Very drinkable."
"Deep copper colored with a thick beige head. Big malty, earthy aromas with some smells of fresh dark bread, like pumpernickel mixed with a slight vegetal afterthought. Tastes sweet and malty with some earthy notes with a small dry finish. Rather complex. Very good strong scotch ale. A bit chewy and a slight bit syrupy, but that might be expected out this style of beer. Recommended."
"Other than the hints of alcohol in the nose, and the warming after consumption, the alcohol does not show up in the flavor."
"The nose on this beauty is huge and gives off the most aromatic whiffs of caramel malt. This is one of the best smelling brews I've had in some time. The malts follow in the great taste along with significant hints of the alcohol that is a big part of this big beer. There is a peppery mouthfeel from the brew, but overall the feel is very smooth and creamy. Limited drinkability, but not from the lack of great taste and feel, but rather from the alcohol content."
"I'd probably buy this one again."
"Poured a transparent ruby color with a small head and rather thick lacing on the sides. The head could've (should've) been bigger, led me to believe this was an older bottle or something like that. Anyways, the smell was of a lot of sweetness. And that was what the initial taste was also. Lots of fruit flavor and some roasted malts, main noticeable flavor being caramel. But it seemed a little odd because the flavor changed very rapidly while on the tongue. It turned more hoppy and acidic in taste and ultimately a strong alcohol flavor came through. At first it threw me off but once I got used to it I like it....a lot. Quite nice!"
"Skullsplitter. Gotta like the name. Pours with huge, dense head and a dark amber color into my tulip-shaped tasting glass. I sense this a malty beer and the aroma this ale produces confirms my suspicions. Malt is present in the aroma, but in some peculier forms, I can detect the aroma of sweet malt but also that of leather. Very interesting. Very smooth mouthfeel. Like velvet. Tastes meaty, with a bit roasted grains and bitter towards the finish. There's a bit a wine-like finish, not so much tannin as fruit and alcohol. Very delicate tasting for strong beer, and not as thick as one would think, but still quite good. The bitter finish is a nice touch and surprising in a Scottish beer."
"SkullSplitter pours dark amber in hue with minimal head. It has a sweet malty aroma with a hint of smokiness. The tastes are of carmel and fruit, but strangely dominated by a smoked meat flavor. Mildly carbonated and a little chewy with noticable alchohol content. It's an interesting ale, but I probably wouldn't have it again."
"Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid."
"This is a very interesting brew. Nice amber color..some sweetness in the taste....a hint of peat undertone? smooth, but firm and accented with alcoholic tinges. I get a sense that this is what a strong/old ale should taste like. A definite sipping brew...probably great in the winter time. Of course this is form Northern Scotland, so I'm sure they appreciate this kind of brew in the North Sea. I'll bet this beer would be great with a nice roast beef. A definite try for all."
"Thats all there is to it, and its tastily complex. A truly excellent handling of malt, and thus a very good scottish ale. Easy to drink despite what may seem to be too much for the palette."
"Very good example of its style."
"Quite a unique brew that makes for a very interesting and drinkable Old Ale. Its a little strong, so I dont know that I could drink too many of these. One things for sure... one isnt enough!"
"Update  I drink this on a regular basis but thought I should re-review it with an 04 bottle. My opinion hasnt changed one iota from my initial rating in September of 2003."
"Poured a reddish brown, with a nice tan head that stuck around for a while. Not too much lacing, but the ring of foam around the edge never disappeared. Had a dark cherry, raisin and molasses scent. Very malty tasting, with notes of dark, bittersweet cherry, molasses, raisins and a bit of caramel, along with a taste of warming alcohol hovering over the whole scene. There are hops here, but very restrained. This is a very ""chewy"" beer, very substantial. I think it would make a great nightcap, and I certainly enjoyed drinking it tonight, but I can't see it as a session beer."
"Deep brown color. Medium head. Aroma is very smoky. Very smoky tasting Scottish Ale. Very peaty. It also very malty and there are some hop buried under all those malts. It kind of one-dimensional towards the smoky malts, but it tastes OK. Very smooth tasting. Nice beer if you like smoky flavors. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is peaty and smoky."
"s.d."
"Pours a brownish reddish color with a thin tan head. A very nice very malty flavor. A real nice caramel, toffee aftertaste. This is an excellent beer. I would recommend this one to beer lovers in general. In a day and age when hops run the show, this is a nice break."
"Everything from the label to the color, the smell, and the taste warns you that this is not Bud Light. A deep garnet, it puts off a nice head that fades but leaves a bit of lace on the glass. The smell is raisins, some molasses, and just a hint of peat. A nice chunky mouthfeel carries flavors of ripe fruit-raisin and a bit of cherry-along with sweet candy-like flavors and just a bit of hop bite. This would be the beer with which to brace yourself before heading off to battle on a Scottish plain."
"Comments: Delicious, albeit a tad subdued. Would drink this regularly if not for the price."
"For some reason, I had a bad impression of this beer from some time back. Maybe it's the label. Or the name. Just seemed to be trying too hard, ya know? But anyway, on revisiting, the beer actually turns out to be fairly decent. Nice malty aroma -- a bit nutty in character, as is the flavor, which develops a very satisfying, full, roasty character to complement the beer's sweetness. Hops kick in at the end and make for a really pleasant finish. Satisfying, indeed, but still not extraordinary, and one gets the impression of a barley wine that's just going through the motions. And that viking looked so tough..."
"Overall Impression: Though the label on the bottle is pretty cheesy/kitchy, this beer is quite a pleaser. A full-flavored, complex ale. Great example of a Scottish Old Ale. Definitely worth a try and great for stocking a few bottles to taste at a later date."
"This beer pours a dark (but clear) red color. It has a nice white head that dies off quickly and leaves almost no lacing on the glass. The aroma was different: Some sweet maltiness and caramel with some hops bringing up the back. Odd and strong flavor. Enjoyable after a few drinks, but takes a second to become used to. The flavor was pretty malty with some cherries in there somewhere. After a drink or two it was pretty smooth with an enjoyable mouthfeel. Very interesting beer."
"A tan colored head that died very quickly, but maintained good lace. The color is a dark brown with reddish tones, hazy and low effervescence. The smell was of malt and caramel -- real earthy. It has a sweet toffee like flavor that was almost overwhelming (syrupy). The mouth feel was a little flat. My overall impression is that it lacks character and is somewhat one-dimensional. Cool name."
"While at the Sharp Edge in Pittsburgh, I asked if they have a Scottish Wee Heavy. I made a Wee Heavy at home and wanted to try a commercial version to see how I did. This beer was precicely what my home brew tastes like. I must have done it right! Loads of flavor, somewhat complex, but definitely a Scottish product! Slightly bitter after taste, yet creamy in the mouth, and bursting with flavor. One to settle down and enjoy. Love the bottle, took it home for my small collection."
"A good beer. Much more delicate and drinkable compared to other barley wines. I wasn't really impressed with it at first, but the more I drank, the more I appreciated it."
"A very nice slow drinking ale. Don't gulp this one."
"This beer poured a tan head with small sized bubbles. The hue of this beer was dark brown and the nose was malty. Somewhat of a bitter aftertaste was observed with this beer. It was an okay beer, but not at the top of my favorites and not a beer that I will be drinking on a regular basis."
"But, I was more than pleasantly surprised. I've had ales that are sweet and fruity but end up being WAY too sweet and fruity, but this one doesn't make you question your manhood like the others. Definitely a great beer, and something I'd buy again if I didn't have 10 bazillion other beers to try on a college budget. Skoal!"
"Overall: I like this beer a lot. I'd drink it a lot more if my paychecks were a little bigger. Kind of pricey in my neck of the woods. I recomend keeping one or two in the back of your refrigerator for a rainy, skullsplitting, type of day. What a treat."
"This brew has a very nice malty aroma. It poured a nice light brown head with small light brown bubbles. Its dark brown somewhat transparent body looked very tempting. It had a slightly carbonated taste with a slight after bite and a hoppy flavor. It is a nice beer but falls a little short of my favorite range."
"Opaque mahogany/dark copper colored. The head is low and frothy, but really sticks around and leaves nice foamy specs on the inside of the glass. Aroma is unique - some malt and also some fruit, like apple or pear. Flavor is rich and round, warming alcohol mixes with a caramelized flavor, and I detect some smoke. Some sweet malt comes through. Teeny bit of hop in the finish, or is that the alcohol stinging my throat? Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Surprisingly drinkable for a beer with such a punch. First one I've had, but I would like more."
"Skullsplitter, a beer with a story behind it, and how intimidating it sounds. Pours a deep crimson brown with a minimal white head. Smells sweet and the alcohol is noticeable. Sweet, with a mild hoppiness and citrusy undertones--I'd say grapefruit. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and helps hide the alcohol content nicely. Note: I recommend this beer to be in the neighborhood of 55-65 degrees for optimum consumption (I raised several of my scores after the beer warmed up a bit). This one was a nice treat--very warming with every sip. My favorite scottish ale to date (probably because it reminds me of a Belgian...)"
"Quite dark copper in color with a ruby tint. When poured, an average sized cream-tan head emerges. The smell is dominated by malt, particularly by a smoked malt aroma. The taste is initially quite sweet with a smoke-like, earthy tone. Hop bitterness is apparent, but not the focus of this beer. There is a definite alcohol burn as the beer runs down the throat, but not overbearing. A wonderful, creamy and thick mouthfeel. A pleasure to drink."
"Bottom line: if you want a good sipping beer with a full flavor and a large kick, this is your beer."
"Fruity sweet aroma come out of the glass. Red, almost cherry wood, in color. A cheesy aroma and flavor were also present as the beer warmed up a little. Alchohol was quite noticable in both mouth and nose, but did not detract. Beer became pleasantly more creamy as it warmed up. Quite nice and enjoyable."
"Pour a dark, very dark amber with about 1/4 inch dark tan head that doesn't last to long. Noses of chocolate, malt, and grains. Smells like Whoppers candies. The taste of this ale is very robust and forward. Tastes of malt, leather, and slightly bitter chocolate dominate this beer. There is also a fair amout of hops that give it a very pleasing bitterness. Very low carbonation, but either the alcohol or the acidity gives a slight tingle on the tounge with the finish. SkullSplitter finishes long and very smooth with an enjoyable bitterness. Great beer. Maybe my new favorite scottish ale."
"The label of reminds me of a guy dressing up as a viking for a viking party, and as he arrives, he realizes he's the only one dressed up...I don't know, it's just the look on his face. The color of this beer in a dark clear amber with a 1/4 inch head. You can smell the sweetness of the malts with a hint of fruit. The beer comes across smokey immediately which fades into the sweet taste of the malts. The beer remains slightly smokey in flavor, but it slowly gives way to the malt and hops. At 8.5% ABV, the beer does not taste all that strong. A drinkable beer and I'll definitely get it again."
"I picked this up mainly because of the picture on the label. It had a classic looking Viking on it, with the horned helmet and all! It poured a nice dark ruby color with a sticky tan head, which slowly faded down leaving a web-like lace. Aromas were of sweet malts and alcohol. Taste was equally sweet with hints of hops and malts. There was a bit of a syrupy texture left of my tongue. This is a very well balanced and enjoyable beer."
"Warning: Mere mortals cannot take this suicidal journey."
"A nice find...thanks to Stubbob for directing me to the only liqour store in Minnesota that has it probably.."
"Wonderful thick Scottish brew. Pours dark, short-lived but dense tan head. Aroma is plummy, raisiny, sweet, and the taste is about ten miles beyond that. Thick, juicy and sweet. Dense. The kind of beer that makes you want to sit in front of the fire."
"Very appetizing amber colored beer with rich creamy head.Raisin-like aroma to it,kinda porty in taste to me with some dried fruit in there,alchol was prevalent ecspecially when it began to warm.Something to drink before bedtime.Really nice liked it alot."
"Got this at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA (although it turns out it is available in Ohio). Pours a rich orangish-brown with a medium and lasting head. Nice lacing throughout. Aroma is malty with some fruit and alcohol tones. Flavor packs a punch, mostly malt, caramel and alcohol with a rather fruity finish. Interesting brew."
"All in all a nice beer. But, not a ""great"" representation of the style. It seems that all Scottish beers taste alike. Scottish beers must all use the same type of malts; at least that is what detracts from what could be a great beer. This tasted like Mc Ewans. Nice brown color, bready malty nose. Malty taste, too malty. It would be better served if the alcohol were allowed to have a more dominant presence, however the alcohol is noticeable. Overall drinkable, but only once in a while. More of an apéritif than a round or session beer."
"Someday I'll give this one another shot, hopefully on tap."
"All in all another nice beer from the Orkney Isles"
"Poured a brown color with thin tan foam. The smell was strong and malty. A sweet aroma with some lactic acid. The taste was sweet and malty, with some caramel and a bit of lacitc acid. The mouthfeel was strong and smooth. The carbonation was strong. The drinkability was good. A bit astringent but creamy and good."
"on with the review. pours with a decent head. This beer is transparent yet looks very thick. It's almost burgundy in color. Smell is sweet malts & alcohol. The taste is full of sweet matliness, not hoppy at all like some other barleywines. Great taste but a bit syrupy in the mouth. Has that sweet ""dough"" taste found in some german doublebocks. A good brew overall, but a bit sweet for my tastes. Worth tyring for sure, but I think this beer could use i bit more balance"
"[ STATS:>> SERVING: 330ml bottle / ABV: 8.5% / PRICE: $2.65 USD ]"
"When poured it was a deep reddish-golden in color with very little foam and no lace. The smell of hops and malts were nearly non exsistant, very weak. The taste had a full, a velvet-like body that was medium dry and powerful. It had a hint of an earthy character. To be drank in a brandy snifter!"
"Cheers"
"There are many flavors to this brew. Chocolate and hops initially, with a bit of earthiness as well. It finishes smooth with a pleasant hop bitterness and a mild coffee flavor, with some astringent alcohol as well. For some reason, it also reminds me of gasoline as well, but dont get me wrong, its very good and very complex. Quite enjoyable!"
"Deep auburn in color with a thin caramel head that leaves no lace. Rich aromas of chocolate, malts and mollasses. Smells like a porter, hints of coffee as well. Malts and coffee come through on the taste as well. Highly carbonated and fairly creamy mouthfeel. Coffee bitter on the finish with a lingering aftertaste. Pretty good brew."
"Pours to a clear, ruby-brown color with a tan head. The aromas are of figs, dates, and alcohol. The flavor is smoky, toasty, and alcoholic. The flavor ends with a slight touch of chocolate. The hop bitterness is way in the back. It is a very warming, full-bodied beer. It is an easy drinking beer with a level of alcohol that will definitely sneak up on you. A very tasty brew, I would certainly drink this one again."
"The beer, though, was also extremely oily, and at times a bit rancid. I don't know how old my sample was, and the fleeting rancid flaw could have been from age oxidation. Still, it's a terrific brew....if I see it again, I'm sure to have more!"
"Pours a medium amber/copper color with a nice thick tan head that slowly sinks toa solid 1/8 inch level and leaves moderate lace. Big chewy maltiness in the nose with some nice chocolate type sweetness mixed with some fruity figs, prunes, and slight grape skin aromas. Somewhat in between a doppel bock and a barley wine, this brew is definitely a tasty one, and very appropriate for the winter weather. Nice big maltiness with softly sweet tones like a doppel. Nice chocolatey characteristics are there before the complex fruityness comes in. Big prunes, figs, some slight orange zest, and more slightly tart grape flavors. The brew ends with big maltiness but nicely avoids becoming cloying and syrupy. Very clean and very light for the amount of maltiness and big fruit flavors. Not that it is light or clean, there is just a ton of flavor in this brew and it isn't over the top in delivering it. Very tasty, very consumable (perhaps dangerously so), and definitely very recommended."
"Would recommend, but only have one!"
"This beer is a very nice Scotch Ale. It has a nice strong taste to it of plums and raisins, and a nice thick dark color to add. The head wasn't too thick and creamy, but what do you expect out of a bottle. It goes down smooth and leaves a heavy after taste. Had a nice warming effect on me, and is now one of my favs. If you are a fan of thick beers, with heavy after tastes, then you would most certainly dig it."
"This beer poured a dark amber and formed a nice foamy light tan head that left circular lace. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, caramel and prunes/plums. A flavor of malt, caramel and fruit. A very strong flavored beer with a slight hint of the alcohol that is present. A very warming finish."
"The beer pours a clear ruby red color, the head spectacular in size, the consistency that of thick cream, the lace glutinous, and both a pleasing light tan color. Strong hints of caramel, sweet fruit,  toasted malt. Quite sweet at the start, the top middling, the Finnish is vigorously carbonated, ruggedly hopped, droughty aftertaste."
"Rub colored clear liquid topped with a thin edge beige head. Decent raisen, roasted plum smells. Maybe a hint of earthy oak. Taste was a strong mix of syrupy carmel, rich vine ripe plums and toasted fruit. Very smooth finisher, melts into you mouth, then slides into a belly warming finish. Medium to light bodied, despite the complex flavors. Very smooth finishing flavors. Sneaky strong at 8.5 %  A beer not be missed. I made it a nite capper. I don't think you want any more than one of these at a time."
"This was not my favorite beer, but I will try it again a little warmer. I made the mistake of drinking this beer too cold. IMO, it should be consumed at cellar temperature as the absolute coolest out of a nice tulip glass. Next time I will show te beer the respect it deserves."
"This pours with a long lasting tan head over clear deep dark amber liquid, laid back carbonation. Lots of sweet maltiness in the nose, the tasting reveals more malt with some slight phenols, roasted grains, then a nice round of hoppiness to dry things out. A long and enjoyable finish rounds things out nicely."
"I'll have to score another bottle, because I have the feeling this could be a classic."
"Amber-brown color with a frothy light tan head that settles quickly. Wonderfully intense and rich malty aroma of smoky caramel along with lots of green apple rind and spicy hops. The aroma jumps right at you, it's hard to miss all of the nuances of character in it, even under the big, bold maltiness. Rich, full flavor. Chewy, sweet caramel and peat-like malt with a little smokiness and spicy hop bite. A tiny hint of dried fruit is detectable. Roasted undertones throughout. Dangerously smooth. Very and robust. Overall, caramel is in charge. This was one of my first introductions to heavily malty brews, and one of the reasons I love them! Highly recommended."
"With a name like SkullSpiter and a Viking on the label, I figured this was going to be a great beer. This deep rich carmel colored beer poured to a nice thick head which settled to a small one which wouldn't go away. Nice strong ale (malty) taste, yet not over too powering. For being a non-American ale, this is a great beer. none of that weird Euro/English taste. Although, I did expect a more of a kockout punch in taste with what was on the label."
"While quaffing the last of my pint, the publican offered up some smoked herring. It went perfectly with this brew."
"Clear garnet in hue.  Tan head quickly recedes into a tight rim around the glass.  Dark caramel malt and lightly sweet fruity esters upfront in aroma, while underlying  roasted barley adds a slight edge.  Mild diacetyl butterscotch emerges as the beer breathes.  Fairly tame aromawise. In flavor, assertive sweet caramel leaps out of the gate, then tames and  blends with ensuing light roasted barley and hop bitterness and butterscotch.  Lightly nutty, biscuity malt emerges mid palate concomitantly with a subdued earthy Goldings hop flavor.  Moderate in body, with a smooth mouthfeel facilitated by the relatively low carbonation.  Finishes w/ a fading toffeeish sweetness and mellow alcohol warmth.  Skullsplitter is a tasty, straight forward strong ale.  Not complex, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"     For increased viking effect,drink at room temp after battle."
"Great looking beer -- deep ruby/brown, with a creamy off-white head (rocky at first, dissipating to a fine lace). Aroma of fresh baked brown bread, with rich, dark fruits thrown in for good measure. The taste is a combination of brown bread, raisins, spice cake, currants. Wow! Sweet and peaty, this is one to sip and enjoy."
"Pours a color half ruby, half brown. Big bubbled head is fizzy and quickly dissipates to nothing. Taste starts off with raisins/apple peel with bitter hops joining in later on. The middle is caramel-like malt. Leaves bitter and slightly sour aftertaste but not for too long."
"A nice dark brown color and rich looking, this beer is packed with a punch.  Smells of malt, scotch and some kind of dark ripened fruit, like figs or prunes.  Has a strong, defining caramel sweetness that hit you hard and never lets up.  Robust and filling, this beer needs to be respected.  The sweetness hits you in the back of the throat- so you really can't drink too much of it.  But you wouldn't want to.  This is a beer to savor and admire."
"Clearish, deep brown -- whitish-tan head of 1/2 an inch of semi-rocky foam. Sharp, cheesy aroma. Sweet and toffee-like, Scotch Ale malt characteristic are evident, hops mostly as a balancing agent. Medium full-bodied coating impression, a little greasy. Some buttery characteristics. Thick in the swallow with a bit of papery tang. A bit cloying and unidimensional to me, except at the back of the mouth where the strength starts coming in to play. Ultimately gets a little woody (and you might want to think about the inside of a leather shoe) and shows some real plastic band-aid phenolics in the throat."
"WOW! This is one strong ale.  Reddish in color, with a smell of sweetness, almost like candy.  Taste is very strong with sweetness of buttery carmel or butterscotch.  Drink slowly and enjoy!!"
"Oh yeah. I can surely appreciate a good strong ale...and this is a good one. Clear ruby color, enormous rocky head that cascades from the bottom to top when poured. Lace decorates the glass. Toasty caramel, sweet wortish aroma. Big peat, smokey flavor. Spicey alcohol pokes at the mouth. Deep, rich, malty, good. The 8.5% abv is barely detected underneath the full, complex body. Serious brew. 11.2oz. bottle."
"Then...O baby this stuff is great! Nice caramel and raisin flavor and plenty of alcohol dark fruit, plums, slight spiciness. So balanced though! It's not overly sweet. In the finish a bit of warming action. From reading the other reviews, I'll be sure to save the other three for another time, I don't want my skull splitting in the morning...I'm already twinkly eyed...I still have to bowl tonight damn it! Overall an excellent brew!"
"This brew is very nice.  Reddish brown in color with a creamy lacy head.  Sweet, raisiny nose, caramel raisin in flavor with barley-wine-like similarities.  Hoppy dry end tastes.  Fairly smooth mouth, creamy.  Gotta try this one!!!"
"78"
"""SkullSplitter"" is probably a good description of the hangover more than a couple of bottles would induce.  I did not think the malt and hops were well balanced, it started fairly sweet but quickly gave way to a overly bitter hops finish."
"Impressively strong not only in alcohol but flavour to. The only thing wrong with this beer is that the bottle is too small."
"Notes: The unique malt profile truly lends itself to the brew. This is an awesome strong ale to be enjoyed slowly, and in relaxation, after a large meal or a cold night."
