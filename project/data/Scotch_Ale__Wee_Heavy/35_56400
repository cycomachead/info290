4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and it was a good example of a Wee Heavy, it took the non traditional smoked malt aspect and I didn't mind that, in that aspect it seemed to be pretty similar to Dark Horse's Scotty Karate.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, a little creamy, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, but I wouldn't rule out drinking two, but that would be my limit.  What I like the most about this beer was the complexity, it was fairly complex for the style and I liked that.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the body just wasn't a little thicker, but in the end that wasn't a big deal.  I would buy this beer again and I would't mind seeing how it ages.  I would recommend giving this a try if your a fan of the style, especially if you like the Wee Heavys with smoked malts.  All in all I was happy with this beer and i think it might be one of the best beers from this series that I've had.  It's not my favorite Sam Adams beer or my favorite Wee Heavy, but I would say it's just a notch under Scotty Karate.  Nice job guys this, was a good beer, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Nov 28, 2014"

4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/25/2012. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, light smoke, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light smoke, herbal, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, chocolate, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Scotch ale style! All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 02, 2014"

4.75,29.4,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Samuel Adams' Imperial Series, scotch ale inspired, Wee Heavy is one intriguing brew. I was lucky to stumble across a 4 pack recently and sampled a couple and put the others away to age them to try again later. The beer poured a very dark/amber brown with a modest creamy head with retention and some lacing as well. I found the taste from the dark roasted malts to be smokey and smooth with a very adequate mouthfeel and enjoyed the peat smoked malts as well. I found the high ABV to be hidden very well within this sweet tasting beer. Overall I found the brew to be very intense and complex; one I would recommend and purchase again. Well done Samuel Adams!","dpgoblejr","Feb 22, 2014"

This is a beer that stays with you, as the taste (and smell) lingers for some time, and I'm not too sure that that is a good thing. For me, it is a bit too syrupy and chewy, and the intense sugars and alcohol tend to overpower at times. There's a faint pine and peat taste, and a hint of basil, but these get lost amongst the front-loaded barrage of sugary booze.","kaufmaal","Jan 22, 2013"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"O: After aging for about a year, this beer becomes a top tier Wee Heavy. The first bottle of the four-pack from about a year ago was an absolute fireball: The overwhelming alcohol heat blunted everything else. After a year this beer is still very boozy. However, the booziness now blends with and compliments a pleasing yeast combination of breadiness and a little clove; and, the grain provides a very nice richness to the flavor. There is also a very pleasant balance of malt sweetness and earthy hops. This beer is in the top tier of Wee Heavies, but, it is somewhere is middle of that top tier.","Beer_Runner","Dec 02, 2012"

3.53,-3.8,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"O - I'm very surprised this clocks in at 10% ABV - there's no pop or heat at all that pushes through. Interesting take on the style, as the chocolate notes suggest more of a rich cocoa porter and the fruits suggest more of a Belgium strong ale than the wee-heavy Scotch ale that it is. In the end, the deep, rich caramels and dried, smokey fruits define the glass. This would make a good alternative for an after-dinner drink. It also reminds me of a deep, rich, dark chutney. It made a tasty nitecap, but it's definitely a small-quantity, sipping libation. Recommended to experience, especially if one thinks the best Samuel Adams can do is the Boston Lager the corner tavern recently added beside the Bud taps because everyone's asking for a craft beer these days.","BuckeyeSlim","Oct 10, 2012"

4.06,10.6,3,4.5,4,4,4,"So far the two Imperial Series beers I've had (Imperial White and Double Bock) have missed the mark due to an excessive amount of sweetness. Let's see if a style that's a bit smokier and maliter can fair a bit better. This beer pours out a murky brown color with a tiny head. The aroma is actually quite nice, it's sweet, but nicely tempered by a strong amount of smoked malts, coffee, and a touch of dark fruits. The taste is very good, although it's a bit strange for the style. It almost tastes more like an imperial stout, with strong coffee, roast, and dark fruit flavors. The bit of peaty smoked malt does send it a little more to the scotch ale side, but really, this just tastes like a solid imperial stout with a twist. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and creamy. This beer's a sipper for sure, you won't fly right though this one. All said, it's a solid beer though. I enjoyed it, although it's not necessarily what I wanted from it.","shand","Jun 01, 2012"

Another BIG beer sipper that I liked more than the Dopplebock in the series as I thought it was a little heavy in the mouthfeel for that style it seemed closer to this Wee Heavy, which is a thick, sweet sipper.

3.67,0,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A dark, somewhat cloudy mahogany colored brew with a fair light tan head that dissipates to a ring pretty quickly. Lacing is decent. The smell offers blackberry currant malt and alcohol with a subtle smoked peat that I find to be pretty pleasing overall. The flavor is a tad elusive upon first sip, malty licorice settles in after a moment and gives way to a warming prune brandy idea at the finish. Second sip brings a little bit of chocolate and perhaps more of a dark cherry hint to the fruits that come through here. The smoke and peat I detected in the aroma seems to disappear in the flavor of this heavy bodied, thick but drinkable wee heavy. There's a fizzy contribution of carbonation that almost seems in contrast the velvety feel of this 10% ABV brew. Borders on a resinous feel. Looking at the history of this brew here on BA I was expecting something more of a train wreck here, but I can say I liked it for a try. Probably could have done without the entire 4-pack for my money though. I can see where the potential here just doesn't balance out. While you can detect a few nice ideas, it just doesn't blend and I seem to come out with a mere sharp malty thing that just doesn't quite hit the spot other than a little alcohol burn. Would have profited from a goodly hunk of cheddar.","Durge","Sep 23, 2011"

The mouthfeel is sticky on the lips, tongue and palate and finishes dry.

I usually take a ""scotch"" ale to actually mean a ""Scottish"" ale, but in this case ""scotch"" is the more applicable term. My only complaint is the occasional banana presence. I don't get it on every sip, but when I do, it is somewhat off-putting... it's like a little bit of Belgian yeast slipped into the beer during fermentation. It adds a little too much sweetness to the beer. If Sam Adams could dial back the sweetness a bit and escape the banana notes, this beer could achieve the nirvana of the peaty scotch goodness in the drinkable form of beer. In it's current form, however, while it is an interesting, flavorful, enjoyable and powerful beer, its flaws prevent it from achieving true greatness.","Knecht","Jul 14, 2011"

Loads of Scottish malts up front with a but of smokiness tickling the nostrils on second whiff.The body is heavier in texture than some but also pretty smooth.

It pours a solid ruby-highlighted brown topped by a lovely finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises toffee, light smoke, candi sugar, light roasted malts, honey, and light cocoa. The taste is a bolder expression of these elements, with the smoke really coming forward, edging the toffee with a nice toasted character. Some mild notes of plum, figs, brown sugar, molasses, and black grapes add some variety to the proceedings. It all works nicely, if borderline cacophonous.

The taste is similarly robust, with the whiskey being the main characteristic blending in caramel and maybe some pine and melon. The body is overly thick for the style. There's an alcohol sting that lingers mid-tongue that I find distracting. In summation, this brew is over-engineered, having more ingredients and complexity than necessary.

The alcohol is very upfront in this beer and maybe a bit too much so. I'm not getting as much of the caramel that I would expect from a Wee Heavy as this beer tends towards the dry end of the spectrum. This beer is pretty lively in the mouth the finish is a bit prickly as a combination of higher carbonation than I'm used to for this style and the alcoholic hotness leave a lasting tingle. This is a good beer but maybe not great. I guess I'm just partial to the wee heavy that I make which tends to be a bit less alcoholic and a touch sweeter with a higher caramel focus and as I'm missing those characteristics I can't rate this example very highly.","fank2788","Apr 30, 2011"

Pours slightly darker than cola with a creamy, half inch, khaki-colored head that dissipates in the center and disperses towards the shoulders. Head eventually settles into a thin band and some strands of lacing are evident during the tasting, but no legs. Nose suggests dark fruit and a slightly earthy character, as well as some malty sweetness. Taste is much bolder and robust than suggested by the nose - a smokey/earthy/peaty character intersperses itself in throughout the malty backbone and the dark fruit peaks through towards the front and middle. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with a lively, almost prickly carbonation that lightly burns the sides of the cheeks and the back of the throat.

Pretty thick white head, and a great amount of lacing. Smell had a mild campfire aroma to it. I liked the flavor a lot actually. It had a thick peaty smoky flavor, along with a smooth dark chocolate flavor also. Reminded me more of a smoked beer than a wee heavy. Maybe SA went a bit overboard with that element. Mouthfeel was on the cloying side due to the sweetness, but it had an overall enjoyable body. For a 10% beer, it went down fairly smoothly. I liked it because it was a smoked scotch ale; a unique take.

And what's strange is that, if you close your eyes, taste blind, you could almost mistake it for a Russian Imperial Stout. Of course, the nature of the peat-smoked malt versus more of a roasted malt in an RIS gives it away - its malt characteristics are quintessentially of a caramelly Scotch Ale.

The aroma of alcohol is also present, the way it would be in a single malt scotch. 1st sip brings everything promised on the nose...caramel, toffee, smoky peat, and alcohol. There is a silky smoothness on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel. Light hints of the smoke & alcohol linger on an otherwise clean finish. Drinkability is quite good for a beer with such a big abv wallop, but these are obviously sippers, not chuggers.

Bitterness from the modest hopping can't even break through, yet there's some oily herbal flavor in the middle. Sweetness sticks even when the warming spicy alcohol hits the palate.

Pours nicely into an Allagash chalice, deep ruby brown almost black if your sitting in the shade, you really have to hold this one toward the light. Flavor, first off the booze really coats the sides of my cheeks and the backend of the palate, when I'm able to cope with the booze level I come up with dark roasted malts almost coffee astringency, dark roasted peat smoked malts with hints of dark chocolate.

Smells of some strong sweet malts and booze and generally tastes similar. Reminiscent of my dad's scotch collection in fact. It's boozy and sweet, like a much less strong peaty highlands scotch. I bet it would age well also. Very complex with some sweet malts that complement the alcohol and scotch-like mouthfeel. Booziness threatens to overwhelm the taste buds (and does so when I taste scotch) but this manages to fit fairly well in beer form. I think this is the strongest scotch ale I've tried and I like the idea of the higher ABV mimicking the scotch mouthfeel rather than only the taste. Good beer, glad I tried it.","chodinheaven","Mar 20, 2011"
4.03,9.8,4.5,4,4,4,4," As I first poured the SA Wee Heavy it had a very rich deep dark reddish brown hue. It poured with a thin cream colored head that quickly dissipated. My initial nosing struck me that it did not smell very far off from several scotch whiskies I have nosed. The maltiness comes through with a subtle smokiness that became more evident as the brew warmed slightly. The initial taste is the sweetness of malt, but not overly sweet. Wee Heavy is surpisingly easy to knock back given it's higher ABV, and I could be in for some trouble. It was very nice and almost chewy on the palate and the higher alcohol content did not translate into that ""boozyiness"" that can sometimes get in the way of the other flavors.

Starts off sweet hits with the peat and smoke, then leaves a long lingering alcohol burn at the end. Seems typical of the Sam Adams imperial series to be a bit hot with alcohol. Very little hop presence to be found. I fear that if one were to wait for the alcohol to die down you would be left with a sweet cloying mess of a beer. Sweet syrupy mouthfeel, full body, light level of carbonation. This one is only ok, I could take it or leave it.","johnnnniee","Feb 18, 2011"
4.54,23.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a beautiful ruby red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is epic! This is what a Scotch ale should smell like. It has a wonderful burnt toffee scent along with a HUGE peated malt aroma. The smokey character is really nice. The taste is also quite good. It has a solid malt flavor of burnt toffee and crystal malts as well as a big smoked malt taste. I'm really diggin' the bold smokey character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one of best beers Sam Adams has ever put out. Why go mainstream? Hit me with the smoke and keep it coming. What a delicious beer!","WesWes","Feb 24, 2010"
