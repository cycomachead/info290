"It was what I expected. A sweet and salty wee heavy. Not my first choice when I want the style, but definitely will come back to this when I want something decadent."
"Poured a semi-clear reddish brown with one finger of off-white head. A very good appearance, quite true to style. Scents of caramel, chocolate. sweet berries, a light saltiness and hints of molasses. Overall impression of aroma is of an odd scotch ale, fruitier than many, but with caramel present as is usual. The saltiness is an interesting addition. Not as richly malty as it should be however, which is a demerit. Flavor begins malty with notes of caramel, molasses, and a noticeable berry presence and plum and dried fruit esters with an extremely light saltiness. Middle continues these flavors but adds a light bittersweet chocolate flavor. Finish is lightly dry with notes of lightly roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate coming to the fore, yet with the aforementioned flavors also still present in lower levels, and a slight touch of alcohol apparent. Aftertaste is light roasted malt, caramel, bready malt and light coffee. Overall impression of flavor is of a scotch ale, at a light level, with a bit of the advertised salt and a lot less malt than is typical for the style. Still quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with light carbonation and a slightly thick feel with a smooth alcohol present. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a good light end scotch ale, true to form. Overall this is an okay scotch ale. The flavor could use more work, and the aroma is good, but not as good as some. Still pretty good."

"Taste is caramel upfront, tart cherries in the middle and through the close. Smooth mouthfeel, and drinkability isn't as easy as I hoped.  Lacks for me the melding of flavors.  Maybe it'll grow on me as I finish the bottle."
"O: I would pass on this it tastes artificial."

"Great beer."
"Very nice variation on the style. Caramel up front but with the sea salt lingering and countering the sweetness. Nicely done."
"Overall: This is so tasty. Could be a good dessert beer, but a bomber anytime is perfect. I love the salt and caramel, perfect amount of each."

"Was hoping for more of a ""dessert in a glass"" type of beer since the salted caramel is more of a complementary addition to the malt.  Still, solid for what it is."
"Rock Solid! Sweet nose, minimal head, lots of carbonation. The sweet caramel/malt flavours of this beer are greatly appreciated, because they are precisely what the label advertises. This is a fine beer, sessionable in spite of the high alcohol content. This tasting is part of my own personal supplement to the Beer Advent Calendar. Looking forward to further outstanding offerings!"

"Sampled on tap at BierCraft on Crambie street, Vancouver. Light brown to red brick color, with a salty, malty, seaside smell (without the fish). Taste of caramel and toffee, maybe slightly over carbonated, with a thick body. Hops are subtle and floral, in keeping with the style. Expected more of a kick considering the alcohol percentage, but goes down overall very (too?) smoothly. Would definitely have another one."

"Delicious caramel, salt. Thick, full mouth-feel. Warming."

"On tap up on the Roof at Whole Foods Gowanus Brooklyn. I enjoyed this beer very much. Rich flavor, is that malt or caramel? A nice combination of both to me. Salt? I did not get the salt but perhaps it was an essential part of the overall  deep rich flavor profile. A not cloying sweetness too, that meant the flavor stayed away from rich deep stout or porter territory although the body did approach that of a stout."

"D: This was a really nice scotch ale, with scent and taste just as advertised. The body was ok, and the finish was smooth with well hidden alcohol, so it was easy to drink. Not quite top tier, but still a solid brew."

"This is a malt bomb without much to balance it out. The malt however is damn tasty. This is a delicious scotch ale, perhaps the only the problem is there is little to balance it out, but the salt is a nice interplay."

"D - As a lover of the style, I can't help be be a bit disappointed in this offering... This is a pedestrian at best Scotch Ale... Other than the aroma, this one is sub par in every category... I can't recommend and wouldn't partake again in the future if I saw this one sitting on the shelf..."

"O: This beer doesn't seem to be as full in body compared to ther beers in the style, but this makes it comparatively easy to drink."

"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel syrup, caramel candy, and toffee aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, caramel, and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid caramel and toffee presence that works quite well with the base beer."

"Poured from the bomber into an English pub glass. A deep reddish bronze or brown brew with a shocking lack of head. Upon pouring, I get a fleeting inch or so of whitish bubbles that disappear almost instantly. Scottish ales are not known for good head retention but this was nevertheless interesting. Aroma is rich and sweet, tons of toffee and dark fruit (raisin, date) and maybe a hint of citrus/piney hops (foreshadowing things to come). Palate was where this brew lost me a little. Immediate effect is burnt caramel and boozy apple/pear cider, with some vanilla and a vague salty presence coming through. The hops are leafy and resinous, making this brew rather medicinal and bitter for the style. Usually I dig Parallel 49's hoppy excesses but not so much here. Citric and fruity is the main sensory impression for me, although a pleasant malty smoke does build over time. Thin-bodied for a ""wee heavy"" and comes across as quite fizzy despite the absence of head. I guess all the gas lurks in the brew. Finishes wet, with a mixture of toffee, smoke, sour fruit, and pine. Final assessment is that there is some merit but I'd pass on another opportunity. I am looking for a thicker mouthfeel and a richer sweetness with this style. This beer indeed malty but there are too many fruit and hop effects going on here that detract from the caramel flavors."

"Overall, interesting take on a Scottish ale, not my favorite, a little too sweet but still a good brew."

"Poured a brown body with good head and lace with an aroma that is a little salty and dry but caramel, toffee and roasted malts come out. Taste is more sweet than aroma as sweet caramel seems to coat my tongue (the salt aspect is there I guess, but one could also describe it as a hint of toffee or bitter chocolate) and there's a smoothness to this beer as it's not light-bodied but goes down light-bodied all right. Not a complex beer but one that interests me as I've not had too many sweet beers like this. Not for everyone but I enjoyed my bottle."

"Missing a lot of malt and toffee richness and thickness here. Says added with sea salt and caramel. Even that really didn't seem to help in the flavor department. It is however a much lighter scotch ale and is easy drinking, but nothing really exciting in the realm of this style which is normally rich and large."
"My first stab at a Parallel 49 beer from BC.Pours a rich clear deep bronze with a thinner but well sustained slight off white head atop.There is alot of malty things going on in the nose,first off I pick up some caramel toffee and brown sugar, with a hint of butterscotch and whiskey,yeah you can tell it's gonna be sweet but it's inviting.It is sweet,vanilla and caramel are predominant,like a sweet caramel chew,the saltiness is starting to come into play after I swallow in the back of the mouth.This very well could be the best dessert pairing beer I have come across,even better than any chocolate stout.Different in a good way."

"O: I enjoyed this beer. the second glass was better than the first. An excellent replacement for dessert."

"Whatever about adherence to style or gimmicky flavors, this is just darn tasty!"
""

"O - the scotch ale aspect is a little overwhelmed here but the salted caramel aspect is so tasty that all is forgiven, this is a must try"

"An interesting take on the style, wasn't sure what to expect, but am impressed with the results, this totally works and holds its own on its own merits. I'm normally not a huge fan of this style due to excessive sweetness, however this has easily become a quick favourite, and one worth revisiting."

"I was expecting a whole lot more on the salty side of things, given the name and label info, but as it turns out, this is more of warning shot across our collective bows, for the inherent and insidious pleasant/unhealthy duality is just as imperceptible here as it is in our daily grocery-drone lives. Anyway, this is still a pretty tasty, albeit sweet Scottish-style ale, moderated by the aforementioned social conventions. Nix that - I suggest drinking this for its taste, and nothing else."
"Overall: This is quite good. Very glad to have tried this."
"O: I hadn't had the chance yet to try any Parallel 49 beers until the Black Christmas and this is only the second I was able to find in store. That said, it came recommended and it was suggested it would be a good post dinner (dessert) beer which I found intriguing... As a Wee Heavy, I would say they've done a nice job with the style, and I would say they've taken a part of the Scottish Ale (slightly alcoholic/warming/sweet) and taken those characteristics and played on them by adding the sea salt which is noticeable, and turned this into a delicious dessert style beer not typical of this style. Everything is well balanced, making it not only easy drinking but making sure all the flavours stand out. I can see why people are giving cudos to this young brewery as they are already on the right track with a decent offering of beers out there. Worth trying, especially if you like Scotch Ales, and goes really well at this time of year...."
"Overall - A unique twist on a scotch ale by adding sea salt. A very tasty beer and an impressive offering by Parallel 49. Worth a try if you see it on the store shelf."
"These guys have done very well for beginners, I've had very good luck from their brews and can't wait for them to tackle some of my favorite styles. Keep em coming"
"Overall. Well, as advertised it's definitely a salted caramel beer. Very nice and will look forward to drinking this again."
"O - The caramel and sea salt are both present without being overbearing which is really nice coming from something that easily could've been a mediocre novelty beer. Very impressed with this brew from Parallel 49 as I have been with everything I've tasted from the boys on Triumph Street. I'll definitely pick up a couple bottles of this before they're gone."

"Wow, this beer smells like a Salted Caramel Latte from Starbucks! This is one of those beers that is all about the added flavour, not about the beer. What I mean is, there is pretty much zero beer flavour here. The taste is entirely dominated by an out-of-this-world extremely delicious caramel flavour, with a slightly salted aftertaste. The caramel is rich and thick, with hints of maple, brown sugar, and plum. The finish is mostly where I taste the salt, and it pairs perfectly with the caramel. I suppose what is making me rave about this beer is the intensity of the flavour. I was expecting a scotch ale with hints of salty caramel, but really this is salty caramel with a hint of scotch ale: beer and dessert all wrapped up in one great bottle!"
""
"O: Really well put-together novelty ale... it's not something I'd drink a lot of, but I'd be really happy to see this every season."
""
"O: Enjoyable and very drinkable, the caramel could have been overdone, however it manages to enhance and highlight the brew. The salty flavours are represented by the mineral notes, like adding a small amount of salt to water."
"With 3 seasonal releases this winter ( all good as well) Parallel 49 is my choice for new brewery of the year. This is a classic wee heavy that has salted caramel added. The colour is on the lighter side for the style and the mouthfeel is lively and smooth. I noticed more hops than usual for this beer which helps balance out the caramel notes on the finish. The salted caramel is not too intrusive but rather works with the malty midbody. Great cold weather beer that goes so well with bread pudding."
