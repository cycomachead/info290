"Growler from brewery poured into snifter. Pours a finger of tan head that fades rather quickly into a thin film, with moderate lacing. Clear, and reddish-brown. Sweet, rich and roasted malty nose, with notes of toffee and dark fruits. Earthy malty flavor, notes of raisins and prunes, rather straightforward. Slightly metallic undertones. Mouthfeel is syrupy, with medium-heavy body, and moderate carbonation lingering on tip of tongue. Decently balanced. Overall, I like the feel and the nose, but I find the flavor lacking much complexity. Enjoyable, and sessionable. I have had better in this style, but I would still buy again."

"Overall – A quite tasty scotch ale that isn’t too overwhelming.  The flavors and smell are fantastic but a little thicker of a body may have slightly more fitting. Overall though it was a rather good drinker."

"The body is medium to a little above and the carbonation is a hair below medium."

"Overall, a very good, well balanced scotch ale."
""
"The feel is this beer's strong suit. it's not phenomenal, but it hits the balance in the strength of body, provides ample crispness and smoothness, and remains consistent to the end."

"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 11/21/2013. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, fig, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, raisin, fig, apple, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, brown sugar, light roast, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent scotch ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"Pours a very dark brown than has a small tan head that leaves good lacing when sipped. Good carbonation. The aroma of caramel is right up front around with some dark fruit like plum or berries. Very nice. the taste is also very pleasant with hints of caramel, butterscotch, toffee and malts. Great balance of flavors. Not a summer brew as this is a little on the heavy side. Great brew for cooler months for sure."
"I like the dark look of this beer; when held to the light, ruby hues can be seen. Hops stand out in the smell, not too much different than an amber ale but a little sweeter. The taste is very smooth, the malt comes through with a slight caramel flavor; pleasant after taste, a well blended ale. Mouth feel - medium body and carbonation. Overall: An excellent take on the style. I'll have to try more of Big Sky's offerings, they have yet to disappoint."

"The Heavy Horse is a good Scotch Ale....not to heavy and not to sweet. The beer pours a clear brownish amber with thin off-white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent has sweet malt and touches of peat and scotch. The taste is a nice even beer with heavy malt backbone with a touch of honey sweetiness. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall the beer is good...and definitely sessionable."

"too drinkable. *mmmmhhhhugggghhn*"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a beer that's worth a try. It's maybe just a bit too sweet for my taste, with quite a kick at nearly 7 percent ABV, but a pretty good sipping beer."
""
"Overall- The aromatics are this brew's strong points, the taste could have been given a bit more bold characteristics but was still plenty flavorful. Kettlehouse's Coldsmoke still holds the title for me in this category."
"Drinkable."
""
"O- aptly named brew...Heavy. Too heavy on most counts and not something I'd buy/drink again."
""
""
""
""
"O- Mediocre, but not bad."
""
""
""
"overall as normal big sky has created another great beer. its not super big but its def a great session ale thats a bit on the heavy side."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is excellent. Great head, and some thick lacing. Nose is complex combination of malt, fruit, and tea. Candied malt flavor accentuated with plum, some light bitter licorice and some sweet maple syrup. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"O- The flavor is very soft and a bit thin with some stale characterizes. I didn’t taste any of the rich malt flavor or any pot caramel or any of the other wonderful characteristics of a scotch ale."
""
""
"O: Not a bad scotch ale. It's on the sweet side which I tend to prefer. Relatively simple but tasty and goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was better than expected. Not extremely complex but super tasty. It's like a comfort beer, lots of flavor packed into this 6.7%ABV. This will be great to have handy this winter."
""
""
"O - if you haven't liked scotch ales before because of the booze, try this one, it is much more subtle on the booze. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just another delicious brew from Big Sky. At 6.7% ABV, this is actually a pretty nice brew for a late September afternoon. Makes for a great Autumn beer."
""
"4.5 D: Damn good beer. Big, bold flavors that you can't help but love."

"Overall- Another great beer from Big Sky. Hits all the right notes for the style and leaves me wanting another. The only thing I can see wrong with it is that it's a limited release."
""
""
"I should stock up on this stuff before it goes away. This is how I think beer should taste. Yuuummmy."
"Overall - Very rich. Anyone trying to session this might find themselves regretting their decision after the first beer or two. Consider this a one off dessert beer."
""
"Cheers!"
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I though that it was a little below average for the style. The look and the aroma were going in the right direction but when it got to the taste it really fizzled out and left me wanting much more. This beer had OK drinkability, it went down smooth, but the flavor was pretty bland and it couldn't hold my attention, one is enough for me and I'm ready to move onto something with more flavor. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both were they should be for the style. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor, it seems like all the nice things I picked up in the aroma never made it's way to the taste and that really hurt this beer. This beer was priced well but the lackluster taste really holds this beer back and I would much rather have a Dirty Bastard, I can't say that I would recommend this beer. I find Big Sky to be a pretty solid brewery, but I was a little let down with beer as it really didn't deliver when it came to the flavor, you guys make some good and solid beers, it's too bad this is not one of them, better luck next time, looks like I'm back to the Dirty Bastard's."
"a decent scotch ale. smells and tastes very very malty, with very little of the earthy depth many of these style beers showcase. palate is a little on the sweet side, with a touch of the alcohol coming through. almost tastes and feels like a barleywine in that respect, very grainy, in a good way. mouthfeel is good, i like the fuller body on this one, and the fairly heavy carbonation i think serves it quite well. this isnt my favorite scotch ale, or even my favorite big sky beer, but its sessionable for a its style and its one that works with all kinds of food, so i will probably grab this one again if i see it."
"Deep mahogany, an inch of loose tan head manages to hang on for the entire pint. Obvious caramel, toffee, and fruitcake with a fairly balanced, dry finish. Mild bitterness and hopping. Clean and drinkable. This one lacks the really full malt depth to be great, but the flavors and balance make it worth going back for another bottle or two."
""
""
""
"Certainly a drinkable beer that I could recommend to friends looking for an easy drinking malt forward brew, but not one of the top Scotch Ales for sure."
""
""
"O: I like Scotch Ale's and this one was pretty good. Recommended."
"O- It's ok but on the spectrum of scotch ales, there are many that are above this."
"O- Tasty and refreshing Scotch ale, But there's a few I can think of that I'll go to before this one. Worth trying either way."
"Review from 4/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark red amber. Slight head, but some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, caramel and slight dark fruit. Flavor starts as with sweet and caramel malt some dark fruit, somewhat nutty. Finish is a bit dry and sour with a little bit of hop kick. Initial flavors are nice, but the finish is not great. There are better Scotch ales out there"
""
"Overall, this was the middle of the pack for all three of us. I was happy to try this blind first before I sit down with a bottle."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass at a restaurant, the ale produced a slight head. As scotch ales go, this one appeared a dark reddish brown with a certain degree of cloudines. The aroma was not incredibly potent, but did produce a mild wheat flavor. One may have to really search for an aroma here. The initial taste was a moderate level of scotch sweetness with a wheat backbone. This flowed into the aftertaste which was mildly warming and yet somewhat sour. Overall, this is a mild scotch ale. It would not stand-out in crowd of elite scotches, but it is an easy drinker."
"Overall I would absolutely go back for seconds, thirds, and fourths for this ale."

"Overall, I'd happily buy this again and again. With a little more richness it would be in my top-tier as the flavors and aroma that are there are top notch."
"caramel in color with a light tan head on top that reached a height of around an inch before fading and leaving the top of the glass mostly bare. Light lacing on the sides as well. Aroma was spectacular. Rich notes of caramel and toffee, oozing with butterscotch and sweet herbal notes. Light hint of a boozy alcohol touch to it at well, but it played out quite nicely. The first sip made me fall back in my chair. Simply brilliant. Rich butterscotch and toffee flavors roll across the tongue. Enormously sweet like a wonderful piece of hard candy, each sip seemed more compelling then the one before it. Sublime. Nice herbal hop notes playing it up quite well and the smooth, delicate caramel finish with a light touch of booziness is just what the doctor ordered"
"The aftertaste of this medium bodied ale is a light dry with hints of alcohol, I was pretty pleased with this beer, you should check it out if given the opportunity."
"Another entry into the AW BHoF! Big Sky nailed it with this brew; simply nailed it! It pours up a deep mahogany body with a nice 1-finger head that hangs around for quite a while. Scents of rich malts and dark fruits like cherries and plums precede the flavors of sweet malts, caramel and dark fruits. Put the sense of smell and taste into overdrive by breathing in through your nose just as you are drinking some of this fine brew!! Oh yeah! There’s just enough hit of hops to make this one amazingly fine brew! This is a easy brew to drink so keep track of how many you enjoy!"
"O - Nice brew from BSB! Definitely worth purchasing if you're able to locate it. Cheers to this unique brew."
"Feels full in body, though a little lower in ABV than most wee heavies. Makes this beer a little more enjoyable. Very complex for the weaker ABV. Daddy like."
"O - A decent beer- would be nice if a layer of flavor cut through some of the sweetness after the initial taste"
"O: nice smooth, not quite sweet yet. This might be much tastier with another year or two. 4.0"
"Pours a slightly see-through brown with a tannish head. The nose is light caramel and breadiness. None of the smokiness/particular roasted malt character I always hope for and sometimes fail to get off of a scotch ale. A little concerned already that this is going to be a Scottish Ale. Taste is pretty light - caramel malt and bready sweetness in a package with a thin flavor and a thin body. No depth in the flavor. Seems to be short of the style. Someone mentioned that it was more like a odd brown ale than a Scotch Ale, and I would say it represents something more like a Scottish Style Ale or a Brown Ale than a Scotch Ale. Overall, this is not nearly my favorite representation of the style."
"Overall, it seems more like a woody brown ale than a scotch ale, so I marked it down there a bit."
"Body is just about medium to light medium with a smooth clean profile to the palate. Malts mostly prevail, but comes up a bit short for a being a solid Scotch ale. The body and drinkability are probably the best aspect of the entire experience of this Heavy Horse other then its solid appearance. About what you'd expect form Big Sky if its not their bigger beers."
"Overall, a decent rendition of this style. Would have it again but wouldn't really go out of my way to find it. At 6.7% ABV, it's not quite a session beer. I might buy some if I find it when the temps go up & BBQ parties come around."
"Overall it was an alright beer. Had a very bitter hoppy finish for a scotch ale I think reviewing it style in mind was what brought my grade down had I not known this was a scotch ale I probably would not have been able to tell you it was."
"Definitely would enjoy this again."
"Overall - a good brew, with very good and noticeable stages in the tasting."
"Drinkability is fairly good. This covers all the things you expect in a Wee Heavy. Only problem is it isn't outstanding. This is an excellent gateway beer or example of the style without being extreme in anyway. I probably will purchase this again."
"The mouthfeel is solid, sits pretty heavy because it's not carbed at all but still goes down pretty smooth."
"Overall: Pretty good Scotch Ale. A little sweet and the finish and aroma is a little odd, but for some reason I simply like the taste. Isn't that good enough?"
"D: It is a very drinkable beer. I haven't tried many scotch ales, but this seems like a good example of the style and was very enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: I wish this beer had a bit more body to it. Pretty light bodied, but not overcarbonated which helps out a bit. Overall, a decent Wee Heavy. At first I thought it was a regular Scottish Ale and was borderline wowed, but when I saw that it was in the Wee Heavy class changed my assessment to solid and still above average, but unspectacular."
"D: Very drinkable. Good all around."
"A good dark copper color. Light uniform carbonation. Nice solid head with long legs. At first sniff, there are light biscuity notes, a second sniff brings more of the same. Flavor is a robust malt, with a prominent alcoholic aftertaste. Mouth feel is nice and creamy with a light pleasant tingle of carbonation. Overall, not bad, but not remarkable."
"All in all, a pretty good take on the style. Not a big powerhouse of flavors like others in the style. But this is nicely balanced, and tasty enough to be well worth a try."
"This is a decent beer, but nothing that gets me excited. It's run of the mill, and the cola cherry carob combination makes my stomach a little queezy."
"D - A slow starting but powerful horse this beer is, Heavy Horse certainly pulls it's weight. Tasty and absolutely gorgeous, it's not a perfect brew, but it's a treat of a scotch ale nonetheless."
"Big Sky deserves more love than they typically get. Their IPA is still one of my favorites, and they knock a few other offerings out of the park as well. Heavy Horse Scotch Ale, despite not being the bee's knees, is still good beer that is enjoyable to drink. Nothing else really matters in the end."
"D - This is a nice wee heavy. I've had better, but it was worth a try."
"As aforementioned, this one is a delight to drink, and is going down far too quickly. I wish I had more."
"Drinkability- Overall I thought it was a pretty good scotch ale."
"This beer pours a brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, nuts, cream, and hints of vanilla. The taste is similar to the aroma. What I think really makes this beer wonderful is that no one aspect of the flavor or aroma dominates. Instead everything seems to work well together in perfect balance. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a good Scotch Ale that I will certainly drink again."
"This Scotch Ale pours a dark brown with a had that last for a fair while as a good scent of malts tickles your nose. It has a bold flavor that is not too strong but also not too weak either. Has a slight nutty taste that finishes rather nicely with little after taste. A very nice find."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I wouldn't say that it classifies as a strong scotch or anything, but it comes across as more like a 80 schilling or something with mild Peat. Regardless, this is a nice beer and I am glad that I tried it...and would drink it again as it has a well-blended balance."
"D: Very good drinkability, especially since it isn't really heavy. I really like this style of beer and this offering too, luckily it is available to me. Will seek this out time after time, YUM."
"Notes - It can be difficult to make a beer that tastes strongly of both sweet and alcohol without reminding me of cough syrup. This one doesn't cut it, unfortunately. Though the maple and brown sugar help, I still can't recommend buying this beer. Better luck next time, Big Sky."
"Not even remotely impressed with this beer. Afterwards, when talking with the owner of Enoteca, I mentioned this beer and he told me he believed it was replacing either Powder Hound or Slow Elk. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of either of those beers, but I sure don't remember them being anywhere near this bad. Avoid."
"Drinkability isn't too high, didn't like this beer, some off-flavors, leaving me not impressed."
"Overall, a solid Scotch ale - not my favorite style."
"Pours a chestnut brown, perhaps rich/dark shade of amber in there. Light tan head. Nose has dark fruits and caramel candy. Similar results on the palate with caramel, dark fruits, and an almost cough-syrup candy like component. Finishes sweet with cough syrup aftertaste. Easy drinking and light for a Scottish Ale."
"The sip has a juicey palate that moves to something more syrupy in the middle. The taste starts with carbonated toasted bread crust. The middle is just an explosion of caramelized fruit. The finish adds some alcoholic heat that gives this beer a sort of liquer like finish."
"Heavy Horse Scotch Ale was a dark red-brown color with good clarity. It had a tan head with decent retention and a little spotty lace lest behind. The smell was sweet and fruity malt. The taste was lightly sweet upfront with dark malt and fruit flavors. It finished dry with a touch of bitterness and throat warming alcohol. It was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. Heavy Horse was a decent Scotch ale and worth a try."
"This beer pours a nice mahogany color with ruby twinges. The smell is of some drunken apples and a bit of earthy notes that come along with it. There is a good citrus note from the hops to mix in with the aroma, would have liked it to be more potent. The flavor is a nice mixture of ginger and molasses. Some cinnamon comes to play in the party and I think perhaps there is a bit of a chocolate note. It is a good quality flavor for a Scotch ale. The mouthfeel is nice sticky and malty with a twinge of bitterness that is paired well with the carbonation. This is a very good beer, one of the better examples of the style I've had from an American brewery."
"Clear crimson color with one finger of head that had decent retention before settling to a thin cap. Quite a bit of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of caramel with notes of peat with some grassy hops. Flavor is caramel with a hint of peat and smoke. Just a little grassy near the finish. Seems very dry for a Scotch Ale. Nothing terrible about the flavor but there is very little to make one excited. Body seems a little thin for the style as well but has nice carbonation. Easy drinking beer which is a little dangerous considering the ABV. Nothing really to savor to slow consumption. I expected something better from Big Sky."
"D - This is pretty easy to drink, but it's nothing special."
"drinkability - now i am not one for this style but this is a beer i would want the next time i grill up a fat ribeye"
"The color was pleasing like a brown ale with a hint of amber when held to the light. The taste was complex with malts and subtle hops finishing with a little nutty flavor. We get plenty of Big Sky beers in the store here (5 flavors), but not the scotch ale- and I am going to have to find out where to get me some because it is easily my favorite to date."
"The beer coats my tongue with a sticky maltiness. I probably wouldn't drink more than a couple of these in a row."
"Not a bad beer, but there are other better choices within this style."
"Overall, a great example of the style, and a very well made beer. Big malty flavors and still sessionable."
"This makes the Feel a bit light, too. Otherwise it's darn good. Glad I have 5 more..."
"Poured from a bottle into the snifter a nice reddish brown with a tan head that crowned well after dissipating. Also left some good lacing. Smelled very much like a scotch ale should with good malts and a little of the peatiness expected. Taste was much the same with good maltiness and peaty taste. Feel is smooth and lightly carbonated. Overall a good scotch ale that i will pick up again."
"Watching the Bears rock the Panthers (so far) and listening to the only song that's appropriate (that's right, kiddies, it's Jethro Tull's ""Heavy Horses""!). The beer pours a clear ruby brown topped by a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, figs, rye bread, wheat, raisins, and red grapes. The taste is very similar, with a hint of buttered biscuits and light flowers thrown into the mix. The body is a nice medium, with a sharp light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice scotch ale, a tasty treat from this Montana brewery."

"D: This is pretty drinkable despite the smokey quality and I wouldn't hesitate to drink more."
"The beer pours a clear, deep red color with a tan head. A great looking beer. The aroma is very malty with a lot of toffee and caramel malt. I also get some dark fruit and a little bit of peet smoke. The flavor is also extremely malty. I get toffee, caramel, chocolate, dark fruit, cream, a little smoke and a little alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pretty easy drinker, but there's just not enough here to get too excited about. I expected more from Big Sky"
"The foam stopped exactly at the top of my perfect pour glass, nice trick. It's a pretty ruby red color with moderate carbonation. The aroma is somewhat malty. The taste is nicely malted with some spices like cinnamon mixed in. The body is just very slightly under the mid point and it is rather smooth. This definitely a repeat buy."
"Its good, but i won't buy it again when I have other Big Sky options available"
"Overall very good Scottish ale. This would be a good Scottish ale for someone to try that is not a fan of a lot of Scottish ales."
"Goes down way to easy for the type and style. This one could get you into trouble. Easy does it. I had to kept reminding myself this beer is called ""Heavy Horse"" for a reason!"
"4/4/4/4/4"
"The taste and aroma has a lot of bready malt and dried fruit characteristics with a slightly bitter finish. Simple, great, food beer. It has a medium body with soft carbonation."
