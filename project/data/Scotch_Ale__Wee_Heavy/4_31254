4.37,8.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"750ml bottle: 2006 vintage. This one pours a fairly clear, ruby tinged amber color. There was a bit of a tan head on it, but it didn't linger long, nor leave any lacing. The aroma is nice. There is a fair amount of the oak in the initial nose. Lots of other aromas in there: fruits, bread, caramel, faint spice, maybe some peat. The taste is quite good. It is quite complex and starts a touch sweet, but there is a bit of caramel, fruits and smokiness on top. There is a bit of oakiness there also, as well as a slight bitterness to the finish. Almost a bit of a port wine characteristic to it also. Very Nice!","Boto","Jul 24, 2010"

Smell is sweet, toasted grains, some fresh fruit (sliced pears, maybe / perhaps some figs), some earthy hops, and alcohol. A nice mix of aromas in this one. Taste is well balanced with pleasantly sweet malts up front giving way to delightfully bitter hops on the finish. All the while, the mouthfeel is pleasantly thick and ""coating"".

Not bad, but not the best example of the style either.","Rzzzzz","Sep 03, 2008"
4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A copper, light brown color with a two-finger head in my glass that was tan-colored and stuck aroudn for a while due to good carbonation. I know there is some caramel or sweet malt in here because the last few ounces of pour where a syrupy discharge. Also picked up some dark fruits or something tart along with a little floral hops. My nose seems to be everywhere on this one. Medium-bodied and overall smooth, passes over the tongue and leaves a sweet and at the same time tart, almost sour fruit taste on the front. There is definitely some spices there as there is a peppery bite in the mouth and it has a dry, but not too dry or crisp, backbite. Still maintains a smoothness from the oak. This is a great beer that my pourous review doesn't really do justice. I just couldn't categorize the taste properly. Too bad it hurt my wallet a little.","clayrock81","Aug 28, 2008"

4.15,3.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"d: This is oak aging done right. The oaking takes a definite back seat to a very nice Scotch Ale. I think I liked this more than the score would indicate, that metallic flavor lowered the score a bit.","DIM","Aug 12, 2008"

I'd gladly buy this over a $15 wine ANY day. No, this doesn't fit the style perfectly. The yeast (belgian and scottish ale I'd venture) makes this way better and more complex than most in this style.

The taste was of raisins and peat, but the oak aspect really stopped at the palate. I have had beers that really tasted oak aged, but this one was faint.

Low bitterness with a fruity flavour, fairly spicy with a bit of alcohol throughout. Bready malt and vinous character balanced tobacco leaf and peppery spice, and there was some vanilla and oak in the background. Though there was plenty of warmth it definitely wasn't hot.

The aroma and initial flavor is heavy on the oak, but then some notes of bitter cherry, orange peel, and plum enter the mix. Not overly complex, but it does have a faint ale funk throughout, and a nice, crisp, vaguely hoppy finish. This struck me as great for wine-type occasions.","Flyer","Aug 25, 2007"

The beer has a thick off white head that lingers and never really settles away, even pouring the second half of the bottle the high carbonation builds a strong, lasting head. Not much nose--had to swirl it to get some vanilla and light spice over a sweet malt. The taste is Belgian in character, oily and yeasty, but with a solid malty base underneath and oak with a bit of charcoal. The 10% alcohol warms nicely and evaporates up through the nose. Drink the beer at 55 like the bottle says because the balance is better; lower temp made the alcohol dominate over the other lighter flavor.

The Belgian yeast strains and added Belgian sugars bring the beer into the Allagash world. Very spicy, malty, yeasty, tawny, earthy, nutty, and oaky evident right from the initial aromas. The flavors bring up all of these, but emphasize the malts, Belgian yeasts, tartness, and oak. All of which combine for a rich caramel, peach, nutty flavor that remains firm throughout. The body reaches medium viscousness, and holds firm from start to finish. This is a very nice beer. There is an off-keel bite and an unrefined maturity that keeps it from rating higher.

Taste is sweet malts, plenty of smokiness running through, a shot of light fruitiness quick like a bunny, and then closes with the wood notes and alcohol warmth. Alcohol flavor and warmth apparent upon swallow. Mouthfeel is interesting, it seems contradictory that a beer this rich in flavor can feel so light and smooth over the tongue.

The beer gave off pleasant scents of dark dried fruit with a touche of alcohol. Like any good barrel aged beverage would. The taste is pleasantly complex. LOTS of good carmelized malt with hints of dark dried fruit that ends in a nice warming subtle bourbon-esque after taste. Oh soooo good. Very drinkable in small amounts, but has a bit of stickiness to it that would prevent you from drinking more than say two of these. All in all, I love this beer.

4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I am of the opinion that Allagash can do no wrong, and this beer does nothing to dissuade me. I had a 750ml bottle, purchased at Tully's, that stated it was bottled May of 2006. It was a medium brown color, with a thin white, sticky head. It had a sweet, oaken aroma, with some maltiness. It tasted fruity, some vanilla, and fairly big malt that lingered a long time. Good mouthfeel, and very drinkable, as long as you remember to sip and not guzzle.","lordofthewiens","Jul 27, 2006"
3.68,-8.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This pours a clear deep ruby red with a giant tan foamy head. This is a impressive looking beer. The smell is a strong ""bisquity"" aroma with toasted almond,vanilla, bourban, and malt. The taste is crisp with malt,smoked oak,vanilla, and bourban, although the bourban flavor isn't too strong. The many flavors don't quite mix right making this beer alittle off flavored. The m/f is light and not balanced well. This is a damn good beer,but it's not as good as I hoped. Stick to the Alagash Curieux for the burban oak flavored beer.","jmz62565","Jul 24, 2006"
4.25,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Curiously flavorful. I don't hate it, but then again, I don't hate much. Sip after sip after sip, I found myself enjoying this more and more and more. It grows on you.","Skidz","Jul 23, 2006"
3.68,-8.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,2.5,"Pours a very murky brown with a nice tan head that retains impressively for a beer this strong. The aroma has big caramel and molasses character upfront, along with some dark fruits (fig, date, plum, cherry), belgian yeast, and some slight oak and vanilla notes. The flavor is initially sweet with caramel and molasses notes, as well as dark fruits (cherry, fig, plum), belgian yeast, oak, toasted bread and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is descent at best. An intersting beer, by no means a traditional scotch ale...a bit cloying for my taste and quite expensive but solid.","silver0rlead","Jul 23, 2006"
3.38,-15.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is all sorts of caramel and toffee candies. Very sweet but lack any sort of bitterness to provide any balance. The heat from the alcohol provides some balance as it is a bit biting. Some slight tannins from the wood give the beer a nice smoothness. Picking up some slight hints of dark cherries too. Medum body with a bit of alcohol burn. Interesting enough. It was wood aged, but I wonder how this would be if served from a cask engine? I really like that thought.","MuddyFeet","Jul 20, 2006"
4.85,20.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"A lovely beer by Allagash. Thick, rich, lasting, inviting, and overtaking. Really at this point I'm left speechless as it supercedes words for the most part. Heavenly.","tavernjef","Jul 07, 2006"

4.11,2.2,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Quite an enjoyable beer. I don't see how this is anything like a scotch ale, but whatever. It's smooth, tasty, all the flavors mesh well, and the oak has been used judiciously to create a pleasing toasted vanilla flavor instead of an overwhelming one.","geexploitation","Jun 22, 2006"
3.12,-22.4,4,2,3.5,3,3.5,"If I spend $15 on a bottle of beer in the near future, this will not be on my list. I think it's one to try, but I won't be buying it again...","phisig137","May 22, 2006"
