"O - The more barrel aged Scotch ales I have the more I like them. I don't think I have had a bad one yet. This beer is fantastic. I wish I had about 23 more of them instead of a single bottle. I love it and would highly recommend."

"Pour is clear burnt brown with red hues and a light yellowish head. Nose is strong charred wood and fairly deep malt aromas. Chocolate, bourbon, burnt caramel and brown sugar. Taste is the same, chocolate, woody, cooked caramel and brown sugar, notes of peat and bourbon through the finish. Body is soft and airy, not too thick with good carbonation but thins out in finish and a little watery. Not a bad beer."

"O: very delicious glad I got to try this one. Would definitely seek out again."
"O: Really good, just as nice as Central Waters version, though definitely different with the smoky component. Right up there with the best BA Scotch ales I would think."

"Well done, one to seek out."

"The flavor carries this beer, as everything else about it is good but not outstanding. I'm delighted by the varied sweet flavors, from the malts, the bourbon, and a little extra from the combination. Good stuff."

"Cost: $9.99 for a four pack."

"O - Decent. Next time I'd rather try a fresh bottle, perhaps it mellowed too much over the past year?"

"O-A nice barrel aged scotch ale. Not as good as Backwoods Bastard but good none the less."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"M: Full bodied. Big mouthfeel."

""
"O - Lip smackin' good. First beer from this brewery. Impressive."
""
""

"O - If you like bourbon-barrel-aged beers, you will LOVE this beer. The Scotch Ale style is the perfect style to age in bourbon barrels. The bourbon flavors mesh very well with the sweet roasted malts of the scotch ale style. Everyone should try this beer. I am looking forward to trying more of Tyranena's Brewers Gone Wild series."

"Great beer, I cannot compare it to other Wee Heavy beers, but I did enjoy it!"
""
""
"O- I dig this Scotch Ale. A nice use of Bourbon barrels for the style, me thinks."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty decent overall, but a few flaws in the aroma and mouthfeel put this one behind the better scotch ales around."
"Final Thoughts: I'm starting to really dig Scotch Ales. I actually only tried Shaggin' In The Wood because an employee at the beer store recommended it to me. So glad I bought the bottle and will be going back for more if it's not sold out! This seems to be one of those great beers that no one knows about which is a rare find. Would I drink it again? Yes."
"12oz bottle served in a snifter. The body is a deep murky brown with a small vanilla colored head. It smells of sweet caramel malts, vanilla, bourbon, and oak. The taste follows nicely with added flavor of toffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. It's got a relatively light mouthfeel but it's carbonated nicely. There is a slight warming effect that helps balance out the sweetness of the finish."
"Overall: Tasty scotch ale that is complemented well by the barrel, but I feel like it could be an even better brew if it wasn't blended. Despite this, its a very easy drinking scotch ale that would probably go well with a meal. (4)"

"Tyranena Shaggin' In The Wood Bourbon Barrel-Aged Scotch Ale ---4/5."
""
"O- A very nice drinking Scotch ale. My only gripe is that there isn't enough bourbon. No idea why this is only 70% barrel aged. 100% would be perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a blended 70% BA scotch ale, but an all around solid BA scotch ale from Tyranena. I would really like to taste it 100% BA since I enjoy the bourbon and vanilla flavors. I'm sure there are many that will like that the bourbon doesn't overwhelm the other flavor or aroma."

"I cellared this one for ... at least a year and a half. I think it was longer, but it got a little lost in the back of the cellar. Obviously, the basement trolls that are supposed to keep track of my beers are not doing their job. With this failure noted, the beer was poured into a snifter with a dark brown appearance. A generous head of close to an inch crowned the glass, leaving a generous lacing as it receded. It looked like a the empty sides of an cup after a chocolate milk shake had been finished. A big bourbon aroma was present with hints of grape and vanilla in the background. The bourbon establishes itself early in the initial taste. The sweetness of the scotch ale stays in the background leaving a nice backbone. Notes of tobacco, grape skin, sweet malts are present and make an impression. I am a little surprised by the intensity of the carbonation on this one. The taste did not last as long as I would have liked, but the intensity of the taste compensated for the endurance. In the aftertaste, the bourbon mellows leaving a mild warming sensation. This is not surprising since the Brewers Gone Wild line of Tyranena typically is not high in ABV. Darker fruits emerge with a greater intensity as the sweet malts fade to the back of the throat. This beer aged quite well, though I recall it was also very good in a more fresh state."

"O: This is one of those beers that started great, but ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Good rendition of a Scotch ale, though, especially in the nose."
""
""
"O- not a style i like that much but this was good"
""
""
""
""
""

"Fairly sweet with a good amount of oaky vanilla as well. I get some caramel and toffee notes, a rich malty beer that melds well with the bourbon and barrell notes. Medium bodied and creamy on the tongue. I really enjoyed this beer, it reminded me of a smaller version of Backwoods Bastard. I would love to see it be just a little bolder. But all in all it is very tasty"
"Overall-- pretty unimpressed. Not a drainpour, but not worth drinking."

"O: this isn't a scotch ale, i could very well be wrong but i just feel that there is so much going on here that it cant be classified at all, a nice brew, tastes great, pours...well pour, but i enjoy it as a brew and would gladly have it again"
"O: Most of the time I enjoy Tyranena's barrel aged beers for the fact that their barrel aging is typically quite reserved. This beer is no different and for the most part it is a good beer, except for the total lack of carbonation."
"HV"
"Super tasty and super drinkable barrel aged Scotch Ale. This and Dirty Old Man were my first Tyranena brews and both were mighty impressive! Not quite as bold as Backwoods Bastard nor quite as much of a bourbon bomb as this is more vanilla-forward, but still one of the best Scotch Ales Iâ€™ve had."
"Comparison to Founders Backwood Bastard is inevitable. Unfortunately this is not anywhere in the same league. Tyranena seldom disappoints with their barrel aged beers. This is definately a disappointment."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. I'm not sure what kind of expectations I came into this beer with, but the only other bourbon-aged Scotch ale I had was Founder's Backwoods Bastard and this is certainly more 'mild' than that. I would've loved to see more bourbon notes here, as the vanilla and barrel certainly played their part."
"O: I was very impressed with this beer. It has a nice, complex flavor profile and is quite drinkable."
"There was certainly promise for this beer, but that wonderful buttered toffee character didn't show up enough in the flavor. Overall there ends up being not that much more to offer compared to your average Scotch Ale. I suppose not every Brewer's Gone Wild beer can be stellar. Worth a try..."
"Why did I wait so long to try this? Why do the Israelis & Palestinians...anyways, this is an excellent brew. Subtle, deep, complex, & yet comes across as the girl next door. Another winner from the Brewers Gone Wild! series. Keep it up!"
"The CPJ"
"Overall a very nice beer. Good balance, nothing too extreme. Just enough bourbon flavor to let you know it's there, but not being hot."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It doesn't get a higher rating because I would have liked a little more bourbon, but still quite nice. I'd definitely like to have another."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. Overall it was a very flavorful and easy drinking beer. The bourbon barrel character was a little lighter than I hoped, but it was still very flavorful and easy drinking beer for the style. Very nice overall."
"Was hoping for better things from this beer. Taste is relatively straight forward for a scotch ale. You can't really detect much of the bourbon barrel aging on this beer which was disappointing to me. Relatively small head and decent nose. Have a few more that I will try over time but wont seek out again despite the pretty good price on these. Overall, tasty scotch ale but no barrel aging presence so a little thin in that regard."
"overall: good"
"O - The more I drink it, the more I like it. Very unique, love the smoky oak presence. I'm surprised its as carbonated as it is. I could definitely see this one growing on me!"
"And the beer is...Tyranena's Shaggin in the Woods, a bourbon barrel aged scotch ale. Awesome, thanks Kyle! Always love trying new Tyranena beers. Now knowing the style the caramel/toffee definitely makes sense, and the barrels definitely came through as I got a lot of wood in the taste. Surprisingly I didn't get any bourbon in the nose at all and just a tiny bit in the taste. I'm thinking that sweetness in now vanilla after seeing the label's description. Overall I really enjoyed it."
"I do like complex beers when they're done well, and this is one of them."
"Very nice. Carbonation in the mouth is much higher than what the pour indicated. Dark bready semi sweet malts, vanilla, toasty oak, bourbon, dark fruits of plum, raisin, prune. Some light peat smokiness. Butterscotch on the finish with a light buttery flavor but not diacetyl. If the carbonation in the mouth was just slightly lighter I think it would have made the palate rounder and creamier and helped out a lot. But nonetheless this is a very nice easy drinking beer. Loved these BA offerings from Tyranena."
"O - Tyranena makes a good beer, and sometimes a great one. This one is just good overall."
"Dulled and murky scarlet red body. Thing beige head leaves sparse malt. Aroma is sweet and malty with a little peatiness as well. Flavor is smootha and richly sweet with accents of vanilla as well. Bourbon notes are subdued, but this is very drinkable for a Wee Heavy. Medium-full body with no impression of alcohol on the buds. Lightly carbonated and quite drinkable for the style."
"I really think Tyranena does a kick-ass job with their barrel aged beers and this is another one. I like a strong barrel impression and this has it. A lot of vanilla, nougat and oak...blended with a nice sticky sweet scotch ale....not much of a peated malt smokiness...if it has some it is muted by the barrel aged impressions...Body feels full....like I said a little sticky sweet....excellent aroma and excellent taste. Great beer."
"Not exciting, but certainly not bad. I really thought this was going to be a superb beer, however. In that respect, this is a bit of a let down."
"Poured a rich hazy hazelnut brown with a minimal tan head that faded fast but had a nice overall full look to it. Rich aroma of clove and heather almost, with a solid base of caramel and nuts. The flavor was a bit sharp, not as polished, but very mush in the game. Started with a light fruity note, hints of hops, piney almost with a nice earthy tone to it and a rich caramel note. Lots of nutty tones in the fnish with lots of fresh flower like flavors mixed in. Nice creamy bosy with a smooth easy drinking feel"
"4.5 D: I liked this quite a bit. Not overly complex, but good strong flavors. Solid nutty and grainy contributions with a subtle, yet meaningful barrel contribution. Would love to drink again."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. It wasn't as roasty as a normal scotch ale and it was more sweet, but I liked it. It was really drinkable and enjoyable. I swear I was picking up a coconut flavor while drinking this beer and it tasted like a mounds bar. Mmmm!"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. No detection of higher ABV, great subtle barrel aging (too subtle for some); far too drinkable and delicious. My first beer from this brewery but I have heard all their Brewer's Gone Wild beer are great so I look forward to sampling many more to come."
"Received this one in a recent trade with FrankenBrew. I have been for the most part quite impressed with the others in this series; not so much here. Poured a nice copper color, beige head. Aromas of malt, chocolate, vanilla and light bourbon. On the palate, fairly full bodied, with flavors of milk chocolate, vanilla and caramel."
"This is another solid Brewers Gone Wild brew from Tyranena, who can seemingly do no wrong in that series. Not in the top tier of BA scotch ales (step forward Alesmith BA Wee Heavy), but better than most."
"D- The dry malt has some good depth and a slight sweetness to the oak and vanilla notes make this very easy to drink with some nice character."
"Overall a pretty good beer. Definitely worth a try, especially if you're into this style."
"Pours a dark hued brown with really no head to speak of and light carbonation. Nose of roasted nuts, caramel popcorn, butter toffee and the faintest hint of buttery chardonnayesque oak. Taste has an impressive array of coffe, milk chocolate, toffee and caramel apple with a very smooth creamy finish, no wood noticed at all on the palate. Another tasty beer that i received as an extra from i brewery that i am glad to have discovered."
"Pours an russet amber with a thin white head that laces down the glass. Smell is muted, some sweet, almost maple aroma and a little bit o' bourbon. Taste is muted as well, with cereal, chocolate and carmel along-side the mellowed bourbon taste. a little thin in the mouth, I would drink this again, but would seek out a fresh bottle, if only to see how it differs."
"Light carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Overall good, not quite great. I wouldn't say no to another though."
"O- Overall this is by no means a bad beer, but didn't really take much from the barrels. I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but probably would actively pursue."
"D-OVerall this is an amazing beer. If this is what this style has to offer im super excited to try more. This beer has soo many flavors going on in it but is soo well balanced. I love this beer. Will be picking up 6 ers of this all the time. Try this if you havent yet."
"O - A very good beer, Tyranena shows, once again, that they know how to barrel age with subtlety, as opposed to the punch-in-the-face most other breweries offer. A delicious scotch ale!"
"(D)- A solid scotch ale. Easily enjoyable for what it is. The % of barrel aging was just the right amount; doesnt overpower the other flavors this beer has to offer. Well-done."
"This is pretty mild for a bourbon-barreled beer, but that actually adds to the charm for me. If this was year-round, I'd grab it on the regular."
"D: This is all right. I didn't have strong feelings about it either way. As mentioned above, there are stronger examples of the style."
"Dammit, I miss using my thistle goblet. ..Then again, I'm far too lazy to go into the box in the basement and retrieve it, so... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunrise ruby topped by a finger of light sandstone foam. The nose comprises oak, caramel, light toffee, light vanilla, and a touch of liquor. The taste doesn't seem to want to deviate from this winning formula, though the oak is a bit more pronounced, and hints of chocolate and mild dark greens come through near the finish, tying things up quite nicely. The body is a sleek medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a rather smooth feel. Overall, one of the better barrel-aged editions put out through the BGW series. I would definitely enjoy this one again."
"D - I enjoyed this quite a bit. I may have to buy another 4-pack, as the rest of my bottles are committed to a trade. It's definitely one of the better Brewers Gone Wild beers in recent memory. It's nice to see someone do a barrel-aged Scotch Ale that doesn't taste like harsh wood and alcohol."
"Overall, this struck me as a beefed-up version of their (Barrel-Aged) Rocky's Revenge. It's drinkable, considering, but it doesn't wow. Regardless, it's solid enough, and a bit more agile than most Bourbon Barrel offerings."
"One of the most drinkable barrel aged beers I think I've ever had. I think I could easily finish a few of these in a sitting!"
"So I was a little disappointed based on the description on the bottle. Bourbon notes are virtually undetectable. Mostly comes through as oak, and I would have preferred more malt sweetness as well. It's just a little too mellow for what I would have expected."
"Enjoyable brew that I would gladly drink again."
"O-I would love to try this one again. It is very drinkable and I wish I knew how potent it was but it is not listed. It may be a little high but I don't know. Once again I must say that they did a great job on this barrel aged scotch ale."
"Overall: I had a hard time enjoying this one, just something sub-par about it."
"O: This is one of the best, and most under the radar breweries out there, and the Brewers Gone Wild series have been winners across the board."
"I really liked this. I think they did a fantastic job with the barrel aging, and produced a beer that still resembles the style it came from, while simultaneously showcasing some very nice bourbon notes. Bravo."
"This beer was quite pleasant overall, and one of the most drinkable bourbon-aged beers I've tried."
"Overall: An absolute treat of a beer! It's got a distinct nutty taste with fantastic sweetness from the caramel. The bourbon is faint, but it seems to be exactly right! Highly recommended! Tyranena has outdone themselves. A big thanks goes to Wisrarebeer for this one!"
"Thanks to seeswo for the opportunity to try this one. Pours a deep amber with a loose, quarter inch head that dissipates into a frothy band and a thin skim. Slashes and spots of lacing are exposed on the tilt side of the glass. Nose is buttery, sugary and expresses a light boozy character. Taste reveals rich butterscotch flavors initially, but quickly becomes somewhat thin and watery with a slightly grainy quality to the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a mild, even carbonation and a buttery/oily/creamy texture. Decent, but not what I would consider style consistent. Nonetheless an interesting brew."
"D- like all the brewers gone wild series, this was enjoyable and easy to finish. ill be looking to grab some more of this before its gone for good, and ill also be looking to see what comes out next. i also like the fact that the alcohol by volume isnt crazy high. id guess just under 8% with this one."
"Drinkability - Nice twist on an already fantastic beer. Could have used this one a little earlier in the winter - really takes the edge off a cold winter's night."
"D-I have been pretty impressed with the BGW series thus far, but this was really a disappointment. It is just way to thick with sugars, and I am not really sure that bourbon was a good addition to the beer, maybe if it was blended in a lower ratio."
"I really like this. Though I like the base Scotch Ale much better. If this had a fuller body and a little more carbonation it would be great. Very much worth a try, but Sheep Shagger is the superior product IMO."
"This beer pours a mahogany color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing (which is alright of a bourbon barrel aged beer). The aroma reminds me of a chocolate shop that makes its own chocolates and caramels. There is caramel, vanilla, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, nougat, bourbon, and wood. I could smell this beer all day long. It is, perhaps, the only beer that I have ever wanted to grant a 5.5 score for aroma here on BeerAdvocate. The taste is a bit milder than the aroma. There is less caramel, vanilla and chocolate, with the bourbon and wood staying at about the same intensity. It is still really good, but it isn't great in the way the aroma is. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. I have a feeling this beer would be better with a slightly full body, and very low carbonation. Overall, this is a really good beer though, and I would highly recommend it to others."
"Mmm, mmm, good. Nicely done, Rob & Co."
"D. This is a damn drinkable Wee Heavy that really hides its ABV well. The barrel aging is done about right for my tastes - it is there but not overpowering. Good, solid beer from Tyranena."
"d 4 not sure what the abv is (these brewers gone wild tend to be lower abv than one might expect) but this drinks quite easily. in the final analysis, is it too approachable, not challenging enough, too sweet? wouldn't really want more than one at a time, but this does seem worth returning to now and again. and after all it nearly did disappear faster than i could review it."
"Yum, yum, yummy! One awesome Wee Heavy on display here. Tyranena makes another top notch drinker with great flavor, tone, and body. I can and will drink alot of this stuff! YUM!"
"revisited this beer on 4/17/2013. batch 2 is just as good as the first batch."
"Overall another good beer from Tyranena. Not spectacular but balanced enough to make me save one for a few months down the line. When I took the our I was stacks of barrels aging...hoping I'd be able to get some. Glad I did."
"A solid beer that I'll look forward to enjoying again as it ages a bit."
"Flavor is quite strong on the vanilla and oak, with an alcohol burn at the finish. 70% of this is Scotch ale aged in bourbon barrels, and unlike some other bourbon barrel-aged ales, this one seems to have really soaked up some of that oak and bourbon quality. I get a lot of wood (hah), with bourbon and vanilla tones. Really impressive!"
"The mouthfeel seems a tad thin, almost watery. The flavors are right in line, but very low carbonation and a lacking body knocks this one down a tad. The finish is very sweet, which I guess is to be expected, but it's maybe a touch too much for me. Other than that, I thought Shaggin' In The Wood was pretty decent . I liked that the bourbon and oak notes were tamed and not overpowering."
"D: another awesome value barrel aged beer from Tyranena. This is similar to Backwoods Bastard, but much more mellow on the spirit and the malt character. Worth a try!"
"VERY NICE! Pick this up."
"A very polished, easy drinking wee heavy. I could easily see having 3 or 4 of these in a sitting. If you're expecting much in the way of bourbon however, this probably won't get it done for you."
"D: A nice sipper over a nice hearty meal (I had the Black Forest panini). This can also be consumed fairly quickly if you also choose to. At 9% ABV you will feel it once done!"
"Drinkability-I really enjoy this beer. I typically prefer a thicker, darker scotch ale such as lake louie reserve scotch ale but this is delicious. The vanilla flavor from the bourbon barrel aging is excellent. I would prefer a little more bourbon flavor but this is a very tasty beer."
"The appearance is a nice amber color, but that is lighter than I'm used to seeing many other scotch ales. The aroma is quite pleasant there is the distinct butterscotch and caramel notes that are commonly associated with the style, but this adds a light amount of the pleasant vanilla aroma perhaps from oak barrels, or perhaps from vanilla addition. The taste pretty much follows that same profile as was found in the aroma. There is a stronger maltiness on the palate though as compared to the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and astringent, then I let it warm up probably to around 60 degrees and the mouthfeel became buttery and sweet. The fact is though that it took a lot of waiting for the bottle to get up to that temperature, almost as if I should have drank it straight from the cellar rather than waste time chilling it in the fridge. Still a very nice beer and I enjoyed the end product."
"Drinkability is high, I'm looking forward to the rest of this 4 pack!"
"Drinkability: I can't handle heavy, sweeter beers like this too often, so one of these in an evening will do just fine. This was a great try though, and had it not been for a trade I probably wouldn't have picked it up, but I'm glad I did."
"A poor man's Backwoods Bastard at a lower pricepoint and a much higher drinkability. Not a poor beer by any means however."
"D- This was a good drinkable beer. I liked the sweetness to it but it wasn't overly sweet. The ABV could be tasted at times in the beer but I would easily drink a couple of these in a sitting."
"D: This is just an average Scotch ale. I was expecting something close to Backwoods Bastard and this fell well short of that mark."
"A vigorous pour generates a reasonable tan head atop a translucent reddish brown body. Smells of vanilla, the faintest touch of smoke and sugary malts. Smells pretty good. The taste is somewhat disappointing, there's a bit of dryness and a hint of an unidentifiable off-flavor in the finish with limited flavor of vanilla and otherwise very little in the way of bourbon. As a scotch ale, it is somewhat bland and uninteresting. The blended barrel aging offers only slight improvement. The beer is also slightly under carbonated and doesn't take on the expected creaminess from the barrel aging. It does leave a sugary feeling on the tongue, In spite of these things, this beer is relatively drinkable. I've had much better from this series."
"This fine ale pours a reddish-brown color with very little head and sticky lacing. The nose brings scents of roasted and sweet malt with an rich caramel tone. This beer is absolutely delishous! Sweet caramel with burnt sugars and molasses. Vanilla and bourbon are present as well. Big time malt presence that knocks my socks off with each sip. Awesome. The creamy mouthfeel is great and fulfilling. I could swirl this one around in my mouth all day! There isnt a listed ABV but I am assuming this is a strong one based on the title alone but there is 0 booze burn. Amazing"
"This one poured a very clear burnt amber in color with a light off white head which laced my snifter. The aromas are of toffee, hazelnut, caramel, light bourbon, butterscotch, and vanilla. The flavors consist of vanilla, toffee, light bourbon, and sweet malts. If you like the Sheepshagger, you'll really like this one. This beer looked so light while pouring, and is very clear in the glass. It's really surprising how it thickens up a little, to drink a very nice and smooth medium in body. I'm not sure of the content of this one but it's just as drinkable as the Sheepshagger, perhaps even more due to the increased complexity. This is yet another really good beer from the Brewers Gone Wild series."
"Alcohol is well hidden really only remotely evident towards the bottom of the glass as it reaches room temperature. Nicely done Tyranena."
"Vigorous pour produces a foam glass from top to bottom, with a nice reverse cascading head that turns into a beautiful crisp clear almost red ale. Nice sticky residue left behind. It smells almost chocolate like. I get a little bourbon wood smell in with it, little malt and vanilla as well. Very nice smooth mouth feel. Wow this is very nice. Way to easy to drink. It does not list ABV, but sheep shagger is 7.70. This beer reminds me of a fairy tale, its not too strong and its not too light, its just right. Pick it up if you find it."
"This is a really young beer. This would be great if it had a few years on it."
"D: Overall I would say that the caramelized dark fruits and loads of caramel malt usually at the forefront in a wee heavy were taken over by the barrel characteristics (not that I mind). A very nice beer."
