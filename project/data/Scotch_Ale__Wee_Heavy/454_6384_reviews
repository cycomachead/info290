"A nice Scotch Ale. Nothing spectacular, but it does not disappoint. Essential for cooler weather weekends!"

"O: Well done. Reminds me of Skull Splitter, but a little less rounded or refined. Still, very well done."

"This scotch ale pours a dark mahogany color with a generous off-white head that quickly gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is very malty with hints of vanilla, alcohol, caramel, peat and a little yeast. The mouth is pleasantly thick and sticky. The flavor is malty but not overly sweet. It is a balanced blend of booze and earth. Not the best scotch ale I've had but not bad at all."

"Not sure what the guy under me said its not naturally sour smell or taste. You got an infected batch bro."

"O - Not a good representation of a Scotch Ale."

"Arcadia is a reliable brewery - they've never steered me wrong. Every beer of theirs I've tried has been average at the very least. Loch Down is better than that: it is a solid, perfectly serviceable offering in its own right and moreover makes a great ambassador for the style."
""
"O- An okay beer could help with a little more sweetness. Not up to the standard of Dirty Bastard and Scotty Karate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nicely true to style, particularly the malty aroma, but with the higher ABV a bit more obvious. Best ale I've had from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: Decent flavours and very drinkable, hides the ABV well. Not as chewy as I'd like it to be. A good sipper for a cold night."
""

"Chestnut brown with a little whispy head is my introduction to this little nugget. Nose doesn't jump up and impress a whole lot but it does carry a molasses arena and somehow a little of the upcoming heat. Taste is pretty darn neat. Sweet molasses, a little heat yet not too demanding on the dry yet smooth finish. Pretty enjoyable this one."

"3.5 D: Good enough all around. Give it a try if you haven't already."

"O: I really feel like so much more could have been accomplished by this brew, and that it's onto something. I feel like it fell short of its goals somewhere, however, and just kind of faded into the woodwork. It's disappointing, because it felt like it was getting there with smell, taste, mouthfeel...then it just stopped without peaking. A bottle rocket when you wanted a mortar shell firework."
""
"This is the second Scotch Ale that I've had in a row (the other being Innis & Gun's Oak Aged) that has just been unappealing to me. This is considerably better than the I&G beer I had, but I still feel like it has to be an old bottle. It looks ugly, it smells ""bleh", and it doesn't taste very good. I'd say it could be because I don't like the style, but I find Dirty Bastard and Old Chub to both be tasty brews. Not feeling this one by Arcadia."
""
""
""
""
"3.5/5.0"
""
"Overall: I like this style, and this is one of my ""go to"" everyday favorites. It goes with a variety of foods, as well as standing well by itself."
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, I think this is an exceptional and robust beer. Much better than the current scores would indicate."

"Arcadia Loch Down Scotch Ale ---3/5"
""
""
""

"The bottle was poured into a sampler glass and shared with three other samplers. The ale poured a murky brown with little apparent head. One sampler described the aroma as smelling like old lady hair. If you have beer been to the salon with your grandma and smell the chemicals that go into the hair of the elderly, that is the essence of the aroma. The initial taste was that of a grapey scotch. The maltiness of the scotch is presented in the background and falls rather awkward with the grapiness. Dark fruit such as prune is also present, though the sweeter aspects of these fruits are absent relative to the drier aspects. The grape aspects turned medicine in the aftertaste, leaving a coating on the back of the throat. I really enjoy scotch ales, but I found this one to be quite flawed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Perhaps the best scotch ale I have ever had because it does so many things right with it's flavor and body, along with the rich aroma that comes along with it. I can't wait to try more from Arcadia Brewing!"
""

"O: Nice scotch ale, quite good for the style without being overpowering."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/1/2011. Pours cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, toast, molasses, caramel, earth, cocoa, and light herbal. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of prune, raisin, cocoa, earth, molasses, caramel, toast, slight smoke, tobacco, and herbal. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toast, tobacco, caramel, cocoa, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Pretty good flavor balance and complexity; but has some unpleasantly cloying characteristics after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming after the finish. Overall this is an ok scotch ale. If it didn’t have the cloying flavors on the finish it would have scored higher. Certainly wasn’t too difficult to finish."

"My brother picked up a 6 pack of this at a local Kroger and he handed me one. The appearance is a very dark brown, almost black, With a smell of stale burnt toast. The taste pretty much follows the smell, Except it adds a slight sour, dark coffee flavor. The mouthfeel is fairly warming for a moment, However it then just regains it's sour dark coffee flavoring. Did not like this beer at all. I am definitely not a fan of Scotch Ale in any way shape or form."
""

""

"I enjoyed this beer and would call it better than average. I would certainly drink it again and check out other options from this brewery."
""

"o - decent but nothing memorable. can think of a few other examples of the style i would choose over this."
"Overall – I thought this was a pretty good brew to be honest. I really enjoy wee heavys, I like the scotch taste to them, and I thought this was an overall good beer. I would buy it again, I would drink it again, I would recommend it to people who I know like this kind of beer."
"Dark mahogany pour with a thin tan head. Very sweet and deeply roasted malty aroma with hints of fruit and smoke. Malty sweetness dominates the flavors, a scotch like profile, but leaves me wanting more of something. Mouthfeel a bit thin and finish very much in need of a hoppy finish. Not very well balanced. Decent tasting beer, but missing some key scotch flavors."
""
"O: The toasted malt profile was very one-note for me and the alcohol really took center stage. I would almost say the toastiness made the alcohol more abrasive. An unrefined scotch ale in my opinion."
"Pours a deep auburn with some clarity. Very dark, light hardly passes through. Thin head forms a collar, some retention and quite a bit of lacing. The nose is rich and malty with waves of toffee and caramel along with grainy bread and nuts. No hop presence on the nose. A slight hint of smokiness in the background. The taste starts of bready and becomes very sweet as the flavor develops. The finish features a touch of molasses along with caramel. Nice balance of flavors working here. The body is moderate with higher than average carbonation for style. Overall, this is a well crafted Wee Heavy. Lots of rich malty flavors are present and well balanced, the abv is well hidden as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent scotch ale. Definitely above average, but there are better examples out there."
""
""
"At 8% abv it's definitely not sessionable, but it sure is a great and tasty sipper. I highly recommended trying this one."
"This is better than previous bottles I've had, but still not much to get excited about. Another run of the mill beer from Arcadia"
""
"Best enjoyed while watching Highlander."
""
""
""
""
"A bit plain jane as far as scotch ales. I'd could take it or leave."
"The palate is malty, a little sweet, and somewhat syrupy. You get a little warmth on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nothing really stands out about this scotch ale, but its not bad. A pretty good example of the style that doesn't do anything to crazy. I'd drink it again."
""
"This one has a unique malty flavor. It makes no appologies for its' booziness. The color is a pretty brown and the head is pretty weak. The aroma is pretty interesting, .ike the taste. I would definintely buy this again. It is another step towards my appreciation of scotch ales."
"D: Boozy & peaty. A bit roasty too. About mid-range for style abv, but alcohol is quite forward in aroma and palate. Flavor emphasis for malts is reversed. Roast & peat, that should be hints, are at the fore. Deep, malty richenss – with big caramel – that should be the burly backbone, is but a hint. Also a bit too attenuated / thin bodied. And with rather firm hopping. Not terrible, but odd for a Wee Heavy."
""
""
"Burly malt flavors, some fruity yeast notes, plum and fig, some dry toastiness that lingers. Dry woody finish, lightly sweet and vaguely boozy toward the end as it warms up. Medium bodied, slightly astringent with a bigger sip. Still fairly smooth. Overall it a good Scotch Ale, and worth another try."
""
""
""
"I'll pass on this one. I am a fan of scotch ales but this is just not good."
"Bottle courtesy of adnielsen (thanks AAron) poured a cklear reddish brown with a small lingering tan head. Aromas of toffee,tobacco, grapes and light carmel. Palate was light to medium bodied and crisp. Flavors of toffee, tobacco, grapes and light carmel with a crisp lingering tobacco finish."

"For starters, the new label is awesome, but the beer is dark with some orange highlights and headless. Nose is barley and some sweetness, the taste brings in chestnut and coffee, more roasted barley, anise, fruits, and florals, a lot of nice interplay of flavors, really, but there is this unresolved sweetness that I've found in a lot of their beers. Still, very complex and a nice example of the style, although it could have more peat as well as richness in the mouthfeel, which is on the dry side. Would buy again."
"Overall, definitely liked it. My first Arcadia experience was not a great one, but after talking with a beer store guy who is a big Arcadia suporter I gave them another try. Glad it panned out."
"O: I do like this beer. The metallic taste at the end of the beer throws it off. But the other attributes contribute enough to save this beer from mediocrity."
"Overall, this is a fine beer. I've definitely had better, but I certainly wouldn't turn this down."
"Stole a bottle o' this from my brother, but I figure I helped pay for it (in a way), so this is my cut. ...Right?... Anyway, it pours a dark ruby-burnt sienna topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises figs, raisins, light red grapes, candi sugar, brown sugar, caramel, maple syrup, and cinnamon. The slightly acrid fruitiness up front worries me, but I trudge onward. Nothing to worry about here in the taste: The figs return, but the grapes are left behind; in their stead stand brown sugar, toasted toffee, molasses, and a surprising amount of alcohol. The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly thick, slightly oily feel. Overall, a pretty good scotch ale, a bit boozy for its size, but not bad."
"The body is actually quite thin. The carbonation starts of like synthetic cotton and leaves a slightly sharp bite. My stomach definitely feels warm from the alcohol, which could be more refined."
"Winey, medium bodied amber ale. An intriguing scent, like apple mash at the cider press. A hint of whiskey and alcohol fumes. Dark butterscotch color in the tulip glass, nice lacing after a modest head. Quite fragrant in the nose. A whiff of mince pie and brandy, maybe a touch of smoke but not much. Not very sweet but plenty of dark malt flavors. Long aftertaste with some bitterness and more dark fruit. More subtle than the smoky sweet examples of the style. Very sippable."
"Worth a try I suppose."
"Overall - Average, nothing special, and a little to bland/weak flavor. Theres alot better ones out there. Its decent and the price was nice for the bottle, but not worth another purchase."
"Overall it's just okay for me."
"O: Fantastic beer. Love scotch ales and love this one too. Cheers!"
"O: a good scotch ale/wee heavy, a must try"
"its not a bad beer, its just not great either. too syrupy, though I know that a certain amount is expected in the style.... this just overdoes it."
"(Bought in manhattan,kansas. Enjoyed at home in oklahoma city)"
"Overall: A bit too sweet, a bit too much fusel alcohol and not enough peaty/smoky complexity, unfortunately"
"O: Decent scotch ale."
"Overall, a steady beer. But a one and done for me."
"Overall a good Wee Heavy; would like the chance to try it on tap sometime."
"This was my first Arcadia beer, and I will seek them out to try more."
"Very drinkable for a Scotch Ale although I would have preferred a stronger flavor profile."
"I believe this was my first Wee Heavy and I really enjoyed the flavor profile and mouthfeel that this brew had. I would definitly recommend trying this and I will probably end up trying it again in the future."
"Overall this is actually a pretty decent beer, though it seems a little weak for a scotch ale. It drinks a lot more like a smaller beer, which I guess is a good thing. If you want a more aggressive scotch ale with more peat character, look elsewhere."
"Overall: A very nice Scotch Ale whether you are chatting with your buds in Alaska or just want something different while in The keys!"
"O: I grab this brew only a few times a year for a change of pace. Overall, nothing I really crave within this one. Not as complex as it should be. Needs a little boost in flavor and complexity"
"o:this beer is great but not anything new. its a nice scotch all nothinf more nothing less."
"Perhaps I started it too cold, but this really improved as it warmed. A decent scotch ale that I acquired as part of Arcadia's mixed 12 pack. I'd get this 12 pack again, if for no other reason than to have the nice assortment of quality beer from Arcadia."
"The feel of this beer is medium but leans toward a large beer since this does have a bit of a kick to it. It does drink well and has a smooth, milky feel as it goes down."
"O: I partly drank this for inspiration, as I am brewing a Wee Heavy tomorrow. I'm glad I did, as it sharpened my definition of what I want out of a Scotch Ale. I would want my Wee Heavy to be lighter in color, have better head retention, be a bit sweeter up front, and a bit more aromatic. Can I do it? I will certainly try!"
"Full bodied, this beer risks having a syrupy mouthfeel, but is luckily saved by the excessive carbonation."
"I can't say I've ever been the biggest scotch ale fan, but this is definitely one of the better ones I've come across. Recommended."
"The price is reasonable, and this is a pleasant enough example of a Wee Heavy. Will probably get this again."
"Overall i decent beer, not my fav scotch ale but pretty good. Im a decent fan of arcadia so...."
"This beer isn't made for slamming back, and that's a-ok with me. I'm not a raging fan of the style, but in the right mood or with the right food I'd happily pick up one of these guys. Nice job, Arcadia."
"Feels lightly carbonated, a bit wetting to the palate with a warm finish."
"Poured into a pint glass. No bb date available on the bottle but says it was bottled on 1/23/2010, but i think it was probably bottled on 11/23/2010, i don't know if it would be a year old, i just bought it from the store today and they haven't been selling Arcadia in Kansas for that long. It pours a nice and thick dark brown, almost to a black color but more of a nice mahogany. It gave a nice foamy light tan head that went away very quickly. Opaque to look through and shows descent signs of carbonation. Has a bit of a bite on the tongue and even more on the back of the throat. Ive had a few scotch ales and this one delivers on the full flavor. Compared to O'Dell 90 shilling this is a bit more flavorful but its def. a little hard to drink, its a sipper. Leaves a nice film on the tongue and palate, roasted malt and grains for sure, barely, almost a soft milk chocolate. I think its a little unbalanced as there isn't enough hop flavor to even the brew out a bit but i still enjoy the brew. Cheers."
"Pours out to a dark reddish-brown body with a thin tan head that has some lacing, little retention and good carbonation. The smell is some apples, caramel, some dark fruits and overall a malty aroma. The taste is a mix of apples, caramel followed by chocolate with raisins coming at the end. I also taste a slight hints of hops at the very last drop leaving that along with the apples and caramel in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is soft on the cheeks and back of tongue, but has a little bit of a tingly feel on the lips and tip of the tongue. This is a nice beer to drink and feels lighter than I would have expected. I'm guessing it is a medium to full body instead of just a full bodied beer. Pretty good stuff, but not quite as good as Dark Horse or Founder's, still worth a try."
"Chewy and lightly carbonated. A bit of a alcohol burn. Nothing too complex or out of the box. A good beer all in all. I have been more impressed by scotch ales, but it fits the standard nicely."
"This one is a bit underrated in my opinion and one of the best I've had from this brewery thus far."
"Pours a very, very dark brown color with a single-finger off-white head with really nice spotty lacing and a thin cap as the head falls. Nose brings forward quite a bit of dark fruits, molasses, and caramel. A bit of hops there as well, actually. The taste is fairly sweet with molasses, notes of wood, and some dark fruits. The mouthfeel is fairly full, but the finish is a bit too dry. Doesn't quite match the sweetness. Drinkability is pretty good. Something I'd have again for sure."
"12oz. bottle served in a Celebrator glass. Poured a deep brown with a thin tan head. Malt predominates the aroma with chocolate and caramel. Medium bodied, pretty easy drinking for 8% ABV. More malt in the flavor as you would expect from a Scotch Ale. Caramel and a hint of smoke in the finish. Decent version of a Scotch Ale."
"I don't often drink Scotch Ale but decided to try this one. Does not have a strong scotch flavor or odor, but the presence of oak is very detectable. Nice amber color. Very little head and what little is there does not stay very long. The flavor is nice, but not as much body as you would expect from a scotch ale. It is a nice, drinkable beer, but would not present it to others as a true example of a scotch ale."
"Good drinkability, this was tasty and went down with relative ease. Will seek this out again, as this was a nice slow sipper and not a session beer."
"Not a bad beer, just doesn't bring much to the table, especially in the Scotch Ale category."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good scotch ale and the flavors were on point for the style. I was surprised to find a brew with 8% percent in a mixed 12 pack, but I feel it was a great addition and was my favorite of the four. Good job Arcadia this was one kick ass scotch ale that I am glad i revisited. I would say this is the second best wee heavy i have had, Founders dirty Bastard is number one."
"D: Does not really have me running back for more, even so the rest of the beer was a bit off thinking about the false and empty front on this beer. Element all a bit short on this one."
"Taste-Toasted dark malts and an unexpected smokiness that bumps the flavor up a couple of notches. Subtle hop note plays well with the malt and underlying smokiness. Smooth and silky upon warming. A decent brew overall."
"overall a decent brew. This was my first scotch ale so hard to judge based on style. Didn't mind drinking it. Tried pairing it with some gouda cheese by recommendation but think it might have been a little too overwhelming in the burnt taste. Still, not a bad choice."
"I can't drink this all night as it is a bit too bitter for my taste but I applaud the adherance to the style. Back off the hops a bit (shudder) and we'd be one step closer to the Loch."
"D - This tastes fine but the mouthfeel really holds this ale back."
"Arcadia Scotch Ale falls on the ""smaller"" side of the Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy category. Not my [most] favorite Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy, however, it is tasty and worth a try...another and another..."
"Drinkability: I'm so stoked that I picked this beer up! A solid scotch ale at a very reasonable price ($1.65/bottle); great flavors, solid smell and mouthfeel -- I could really sip on this all day, and even more so when the weather turns chilly."
"Friend from Michigan visiting us which made the beer choice easier at the Wine Cellar. Pours a dark brown / copper / mahogany / maroon color with decently thick head. Sweet / caramel and boozy / whiskey combination of smells. Malty caramel boozy taste -- nice and warming. Bit syrupy feel as others have noted, only down side of this beer. Can taste the alcohol but not overwhelming. Definitely a good brew that I would get again."
"This was a surprisingly mellow version of a Scotch Ale. I found it had less of smokey malt flavor than I'm used to in a Scotch Ale. However, I feel that is one of the strong points of this beer. I found it very well balanced, neither the hops nor malts were overwhelming. Surprisingly, I didn't even notice the alcohol notes. That is impressive for a 7.5% beer. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Final Thought: Liked the experience, except those almost too syrupy moments."
"Poured to a one fingered head that hung around for a little while. Head itself was caramelish in color. Left some lacing. Smelled a little on the boozy side. Also of burnt malt. Tasted of burnt smokey malt, a little caramel, and had that burnt smokey malt aftertaste. Felt a little thicker in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I could drink a few of these. You would have to be carefull while making the Scotch Ale a session beer. Only because of the higher alcohol content. Ill drink again."
"D - This is a pretty good scotch ale/wee heavy. I had my doubts because Arcadia an be hit or miss on some of their ""bigger"" beers."
"Beer is a dark, almost brownish red in color with a little head. It has a very grainy smell to it and the flavor is sweet, malty and mellow. It's only lightly carbonated and leaves a slightly mealy feel behind in the mouth. It's a pleasant enough beer -- I'd be happy to have a few of these -- but ""pleasant"" is about all the enthusiasm I can muster for it."
"Cheers!"
"This offering pours a cloudy brown with a decent following head. Smell is decent, presenting a light smoky quality. Taste is sweet and rich in its maltiness...also presenting that nice smoky quality. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, syrupy...very nice. Overall a very nice sipper."
"Pours a dark brown color. 1/6 inch head of pale tan. Good retentiona and slight lacing. Smells of a hint of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, slight nut, hint of earthy malt, and dry hop. Fits the style of a Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of a hint of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of oatmeal, slight dry hop, and a hint of earthy malt. Overall, lacking in appearance, decent aroma, blend and body."
" A very quality scotch ale to enjoy in the mid-day."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I wouldn't mind knocking back a few of these in an evening."
"A very good dark ale. Would be easy to drink a few of these and I would definitely jump at the chance to have more...if certain more complex options weren't available, that is."
"Conclusion: Good by the fire sipping beer for the colder months...this is a nice representation of the style"
"D: Very thick and sweet."
"This is my first go at a Scotch ale, and I can definitely see the appeal. I'm pretty sure that this was an old bottle, so I'd love to try a fresh one. Sweet, but not overly so. I like it."
"Notes: unfortunately this is only my second scotch ale, following scotty karate. very mild relatively speaking to that, but a decent representative of the style nonetheless"
"Arcadia Scotch Ale poured a dark brown/ruby with a nice tan head. Also showed some nice lacing. The smell of this beer was faint. A bit of hops and malt, but not much to smell. The taste was full however. Hints of roasted nuts, followed by tons of dark fruits. Very fruity ale. A bit of hops in the end as well. Mouthfeel was good. Nice carbon, and good weight. Drinkability was just ok. It seemed a bit filling, and the 7.5 ABV really hit me. Overall this was a nice ale. Good for the style. I would buy this beer again."
"Out of bottle this beer was a very dark copper color that was approaching opaque. The one finger head was tan, retained as a collar and left solid lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, toasted malt, a hint of smoke, some sourness and spice. The flavors were at first of caramel malt but then became more nutty and a little astringent. The bitter hops and smoke notes combined to make something notably acidic on my tongue and not as malty as I would prefer. The finish was of roasted malt, however, and much closer to my approximation of the style. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation excellent."
"Pours out very dark, a bit a a ruby tint to it. About 2 fingers of tan, creamy head, virtually no lacing, head retention not bad. Smells are of both roasted and sweet malts, caramel, with a touch of alcohol. Taste is relatively sweet, has sort of a roasted flavor, coffee-like, a bit of alcohol to round it off. The beer is pretty smooth, and pretty well carbonated. Good drinkability too. Overall a pretty decent brew. Would definitely drink this again."
"unusually dark. sweet malts capture nose and a little spice. not a bad taste, but a little muddled: bready, spiced, molasses. medium bodied, very lively in mouth. but a pretty dull wee heavy."
"A very dark cola/porter color with a thin soapy white head.Aroma is earthy dark caramel malt,a hint at some faint smoke,a touch of butter,and maby a sugary fruit like plumbs. Flavor is complex and malt driven some chocolate,bananas,sweet toasted malt,earthy peat,licorice,full mouthfeel,lively carbonation,slight alcohol finish.Way better than expected,I could drink a shit load of this. Good job Arcadia."
"Drinkability: To me this tastes like the beer equivalent of chardonnay--dry, a bit sour, and a bit sweet..a complex beer that I could have two of in a sitting, but not much more...I think it is good for its style."
"The beer pours a hearty brown with a light tan head. The aroma is of strong sweet malt. The beer tastes of sweet malt with a bit of alcohol burn in the back. The feel is heavy and wet. This is a good drinkable scotch ale. It would do equally well with strong meats or as a session beer if you don't mind the ABV."
"Pours brown, tan head. Aroma is malty, I guess, but utterly without character. If pressed to describe the aroma further, I guess I'd say, ""dark malt, touch of earth," but that's just about it. On the palate this beer is thin with bland malt character. Low carbonation (standard) and too light in body for the style. It doesn't taste bad, per se, but it also doesn't taste like much of anything."
"Pours a chestnut brown color with a nice thick head that settled into a solid cap. Lots of yeast floaters floating about. The aroma is of brown sugar, some woody spice, bready malt and apple/raisin sweetness. The taste is sweet and woody. Sweet raisin and oak like flavors, a deep bready malt, and a touch of spice. The feel is chewy with airy carbonation, a little sweet and sticky. A nice malty beverage, seems to have oxidized or aged a bit. Not the most intense ""scotch"" flavor but still a decent example of the style."
"Extra: Again the backlash of flavor in the finish made this beer something else But with that said I'm not going to give a beer 5 stars because of innovation. The backlash was simply scrumptious and full."
"D very strong malt flavor not recomended for anyone who regularly drinks lighter beers but the sweetness is intriguing"
"Notes from 08/13/06."
"D= I admit I really like Wee Heavies, and I was very impressed with this one. I thought the complexity of flavor was terrific, and made this one drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Overall I feel like my numerical ratings are a bit unfair for this beer. It's not really a bad beer (I'd probably buy it again sometime) but it's not really giving me anything to work with. A decent high-ABV programmer, nothing more."
"D - Nice rich brew. Lots of flavour."
"Pours dark but translucent amber-brown. No head to speak of, except tonsure, and not too much perceptible aroma. Very spunky carbonation and great fizzy mouthfeel, as well as an appropriate weight. Only problem is alcohol much too evident on the front end; perhaps for this reason, the maltiness is a fairly vague taste of toast, slightly brown-sugary but not sweet taste. Perhaps less drinkable than McEwan's, but more drinkable than most fine American microbrew Scotch Ales given this less distracting profile. Again, few can beat the carbonation perks here. Post facto taste is substantial . . . smokiness and peat do linger on far after the beer's done (but before food is consumed). All in all quite pleasurable."
"A so so Scotch Ale. Not bad at all, but does not compare to the upper tier for the style."
"A quaffable ale. I enjoyed two or three tonight, and it didn't get old on my tongue. It might not be recommended to drink more than one because of the high abv, but for me it worked out just fine."
"A solid and very drinkable Scotch ale. Happy to have discovered this nice domestic rendition of an under-represented (and under appreciated)style."
"Prosit, MK"
"D- Fairly easy to drink just not my favorite."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Deep mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is sweetish molasses and some caramel. $1.79 for a 12oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"I enjoyed two back to back. The high ABV may make it a non-cession brew, but the beer is nicely balanced and doesn't wear out the palate. The pepper finish and elevated ABV remind me of a fine whiskey."
"It had a good medium body to it. A slight creaminess helped coat the tongue and mouth. There was a nice level of carbonation that gave a slight bite to the tongue."
"Worth trying. Arcadia does well with English styles, and apparently Scottish styles as well!"
"D- I found that this gets definitely better as it warms so try to start out warm. It was a good scotch ale, but currently, of the 2 others I have had, this is my least favorite."
"The brew is drinkable. If someone offered this to me I would'nt turn it down, but then it would not be my first choice in this style. Over all it is a decent brew"
"D: Good stuff. The alcohol becomes slightly more apparent as it warms but it's not off-putting in the least."
"Not recommended..."
"D-this is a wonderful brew,but to me its a sipper and that's where it starts and stops for me"
"12 oz. bottle with F6 notched on the label - brewed with Pacific NW hops. The beer is deep brown with crimson flashes, low in carbonation, and topped with a two-finger, fluffy tan head that sticks fairly well. Smells of whiskey (bourbon, hint of scotch), a touch of sourness a la oud bruin, and a late earthiness. Earthy and malty on the palate, sweet, with a touch of green hops. There's also slight oxidation and some noticeable alcohol that makes the beer a bit too hot. On the palate, it is medium in body, carbonation and finish. My sample tastes a bit soured, but it could be an old bottle; either way, make sure to let it warm up plenty before serving."
"Pours a very dark brown, giving way to burgundy hues when held up to light. Small, light brown head that retains very well for what's there. Aroma is very earthy, very malty, figs, citrus notes. Taste is characterized by a very off flavor. Slightly sour and tart and just way off. Underneath that, their is earthy malty flavors and finishes with a dry hop, bitter flavor. Subtle Peat Moss on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is kind of light bodied for the style in my opinion. Very carbonated and dry finish. Fair drinkability. Better Scotch Ales out there. I'm not sure what that off flavor that gets in the way of the taste is all about."
"D: I dumped it. Maybe next time I'm up in Michigan, Papa."
"D: Fairly good. Could barely tell this was an above average amount of alcohol. Not something I am going to go searching for, but if the mood strikes me and I feel the need to support Arcadia, and none of their bombers are available (which I enjoy thoroughly) then I may pick this up again. Not foul, but I felt it fell a bit short"
"D - Since I love scotch, bourbon, and even the occasional cognac I have a special place in my heart for big heavy booze bombs, and although 7.5% isn't really outrageous, this beer sure tastes like it's more alcohol laced than that figure suggests. Many will be put off by the motor oil and brandy mixture, and this is surely not a session brew."
"The beer pours a dark brown with a ruby glow and good clarity. There is a thin but steady off-white head. The aroma is moderate-high caramel sweetness as well as a bit earthy/woody. The flavor has a highly bittersweet caramel note and hop bitterness is low. The beer finishes with a slightl alcohol prick and some residual sweetness. The body is medium-full and carbonation is moderate. Overall a decent brew, but nothing out of this world."
"don't like to do this but this beer just does not do it for me. pours a murky brown color with a small head with a hard pour and almost no lacing. smells of roasted malt and alcohol. tastes the same with some sweetness. mouthfeel light and carbontion ok. no complexity to this beer and i tried it at three differant times."
"Too flawed to be enjoyable. Misses the boat on the style. Odd."
"D - Overall, not bad. A bit to much alcohol flavor however."
"This is a smooth Scotch Ale. It is not as sweet as most, but it is full of big flavor."
"This is really an outstanding beer."
"Pours a cola brown with a disappearing white head. Aromas of malt with a little citrus hop in the background. Solid malt body, natch, with some sweet fruit in the background. Fairly heavy overall, as is to be expected from a scotch ale. The body hides the higher alcohol well. Not a session beer, but pretty drinkable for the style it is."
"This actually makes for a good Fall beer. Warms you up a little on those cool nights."
"A near black beer with small amber highlights and a finger of big bubbled head that dissolves too fast. Aromas of grape and wine and lots of sourness. Taste is similar - drying sourness with light toffee, wine like the nose. Body is highly carbonated and medium bodied. An okay beer, the best I've had from Arcadia, although not one of the better scotch ales I've had."
"Note: Whoa! I see on BA its 7.5% - alcohol not noticeable in the least, nice."
"There is a strong roasted malt flavor up front, along with caramel and an herbal tangy hop note. Dark fruits begin to emerge as the beer warms (raisins, plums, cherries) along with a slight hint of oak. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. This is a very good tasting beer and a nice example of the wee heavy style (which apparently people either love or hate... I personally love them). It is a bit heavy and high in alcohol content to be a sessioner though. Still, recommended."
"Medium/full bodied, smooth and filling. A nice treat on a cool fall day."
"Overall, this is a decent enough Scotch ale. However, I usually prefer some oak or wood-like qualities in the style which is absent here."
"A fine cool evening sipper, well done for the style, just not my favorite Scotch Ale."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a sour yeast scent that is paired with pale, crystal, and roasted malts. There may be others present, but I can't tell the difference because of the contamination. The taste is average. It has a bold malt presence. It's rich with crystal, peated, and roasted malts. It goes down and warms on the finish. There is a sour finish. It's not as pronounced due to the high dark malt component. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer is at least drinkable, but not one I'd buy again. The contamination is too distracting."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale, and the abv renders it borderline sessionable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, very good representation of style, it's not really a beer that you can pound down, but that's not what you look for from a Scotch Ale. It's a very good beer that you would want to relax with and sip slowly. This is another good beer from Arcadia."
"Pours a two finger head that disipates into nearly no head. The beer itself is an opaque brown black. Looks as dark as some imperial stouts. The nose is intriguing and smells of dark sugar and nuts. The smell fails to develop and is fairly one dimensional. Tastes of sweet dark licorice, but like the smell it fails to develop and lack complexity. This really needs to develop more of a roasted malt backbone. Alcohol is evident, but in place and not overwhelming. Lacks carbonation and features a thin mouthfeel."
"I only had one. I think it would be a bit much to sit down with a few of them."
"Overall not great, seems to hot and a bit on the bland side."
"Poured a dark brown with good carbonation yet minimal head development. Smell is malty and porterish. Not as sweet smelling as I would expect from this style, however. Taste is very sweet and malty with mild bitterness. Fairly smooth, but strong and warming. Overall drinkability is good; I would definitely buy this again."
"12 ouncer, w/o freshness info being offered, pours dark amber, under a dark tan head, decent retention, minor lacing. The nose is boldly of cola and malt.Malty sweet brew, notes of ripe fruits, vanilla, and honey. Not the most interesting of styles, IMHO, but this one is servicable, drinkable and represents a decent sessioner."
"D: I found this to be a pleasure to drink - good flavors and balance, enticing aroma, alcohol that's present but well-concealed. Enjoyed it alot and would hope to have it again...thanks go out to CRJMellor for sending."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall- tasted like flat coke thats been in the fridge for a month. Bleech."
"Dark stained-oak brown with a russet sheen. Frothy, cobwebby, dirty khaki brown head with decent lacing. Brown sugar, plums, raisins, light peat, shoe leather, and a whiff of smoke. Nice and malty. Scorched sugar, sweet dark fruits, and rum cake make up the malty introduction. This is followed by hints of herbal bitterness around a peaty, whiskeyish, warming middle. Brown sugar, toffee, a hint of licorice, and a slight vegetal twang make up the chewy finish. Medium-full bodied with a creamy feel. The alcohol is perhaps a little too noticeable but otherwise a nice Scotch Ale."
"A tasty example of a scotch ale. Not amazing and the appearance doesn't have much going for it, but still not a bad brew. Rich caramel grain flavor with a touch of alcohol when it gets warm. Very smooth drinking and a medium mouthfeel, about right for the abv."
"I would try again if I found the beer fresh and compare to this experience."
"I'm reading ""Ambitious Brews"" and i imagine early American dark brews being very similar to this. I'm call'n it drinkable; this one falls above the line."
"Pours a deep, dark brown color. Not much head to speak of here and what does exist thins out real fast. Smells sweet and woody. Sugary malt aroma with some heavier, earthen scents, keeping in line with the style but nothing spectacular. Taste is a bit bland as well. Smooth, but flat. There's some kick up front, with a burst of hops and lots of raisins. Some coffee here too, which I would not have expected. I mean, it's nice enough, but it doesn't do much for me. Not a great example of a Scotch or a Wee Heavy. I probably won't return to this one."
"OK drinkability. Worth a try."
"...or maybe it's everyone else that's crazy!"
"This is one of my current favorites since I'm a Michigan boy and it is easily available and not overly expensive."
"Served up in a pint glass, a deep brown with rich red highlights and no head or bubbles at all. Nose is very mild, with just a bit of smoky malts and a hint of hops. Taste is malty with an earthy sweetness, some hops and a lingering caramel sweetness. The alcohol is there but not overpowering. Nice combo of malts and sweetness. Well done. Mouthfeel is a little undercarbonated but still smooth and nice. Drinability is good, it's a quality winter brew."
"The first taste is one of delight as there is a smooth delivery with a slightly fruity finish - how do they get the malt to do that? I expected a stronger ale-like presence, but this is a pleasant surprise. This is a very tasty treat, have had before, will again"
"D - Very drinkable, the alcohol is nearly indistinguishable. Could be dangerous. ;-)"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Very quiet upon entry into the mouth... it rolls silently on the tongue, and with a little coaxing the beer gently, gingerly swells to a miniscule foam. Not bad, but I love my Scotch Ales to be more alive in the mouth... it brings out the smoke, the malts, the flavor. This beer is smooth, without question. Where is falls a ""wee bit"" light in mouthfeel, it drinks extremely well overall and deserves praise."
"arcadia's scotch ale is very good and rich."
"This beer shows signs of respectability but it is too flawed. I love Scotch Ales but this one is a joke. Is my bottle bad? It would seem but not much from Arcadia has impressed me much. Surely not every beer Ive tried (aside from London Porter) was off? What are the odds? Maybe this brewery doesnt do it for me. Nevertheless, thank you RedHaze for the opportunity."
"Drinkabilty is very good. A good starter scotch ale, or easy standby for scotch ale fans."
"Clear mahogany brown. Thin, receding cream head. No lace. Heady caramel aroma, modestly smoky. A touch of fruitiness. Broad caramel flavors, integrated plum fruitiness. Soft smokiness in the finish, a whisp of herbal hops and a moderate alcoholic presence. Soft, gentle carbonation, very smooth on the palate overall. Lingering caramel malt flavor, ending off sweet. Full bodied and quaffable. Solid, though it doesn't stand out for the style in any way."
"Nice deep mahogany color. Low aroma-sort of vanilla and caramel thing going on. Has the metallic notes of their oatmeal stout I just had. Malty flavor-touch of alcohol which is suprising for only 7.5%. Some caramel sweetness though I keep getting the same sort of flavor as the last beer. Decent enough mouthfeel. Average scotch ale. I am put off by the ""odd"" flavors. Make your own opinion-I cant recommend this one."
"M&D - smooth like a good scotch ale should be, a nice mouthcoat, highly drinkable"
"Pours the color of black coffee with no head and little visible carbonation. Not much to look at. Aromas of bananas and rum, some coffee, and present alcohol that detracts from the whole thing. There's also a yeastiness to the aroma that's a touch unpleasant. On the tongue, big-time dextrine sweetness at the front gives way to smoked malts and hints of chocolate, along with a yorkshire-like sourness. Very smooth and still, with some acidity at the mid-palate and a sweet finish. Overall, this goes down easy, but the flavors are a bit dull and don't mesh together well. A bit disappointing."
"Originally reviewed August 10, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Slightly murky ruby brown pour, with a rich creamy, faded tan head. Slightly bourbon, rice and port aroma. Flavor is mostly of slightly alcoholic plain caramel malt and brown sugar, backed with a peculiar but not unpleasant barbecue sauce note, a touch of ketchup, and some dusty malt. Palate is sugary, backed with a light butterscotch and raisin flavor. Alcohol dominates the backend and the aftertaste. Light nutty smack."
"My hope was that ASA would at least as good as Arcadia's superb London Porter and Imperial Stout, but it isn't close. Most of the necessary elements are present, they just need a huge spark in order to create something the least bit electrifying. As currently constructed, Scotch Ale generates nothing more than a minor buzz. Then again, that could be the alcohol talking."
"Dark brown color but enough light gets through to tell that it is crystal clear. Looks almost like a flat Coca Cola. Thin tan head that turns into a halo around the outside of the glass rather quickly. Smell of roasted malt with some caramel sweetness. Taste of mild malt and toffee flavor but lacks any real kick at first. About halfway down flavors of raisin and a touch of smokiness comes through. 7% alcohol shows itself and gives a nice warming feeling to the finish. No bitterness at all and no aftertaste is left by the dry finish. My first impression was not very good but as i drank it improved some."
"This one wasn't bad. I enjoyed it and it was well balanced, but there really wasn't anything that stood out to make it memorable."
"It is quite enjoyable, but I like a like an American Scotch Ale (or any Scotch Ale) to be a bit more peaty and/or complex."
"Dark brown in color, with a few ruby highlights around the edges. Thin off-white head disappears fairly quickly. Fairly robust malty aroma. Good toffee flavor, caramel and slightly roasty. Just enough bitterness to keep this from being cloying, but still pretty sweet. Medium body, with a low amount of carboantion that seems very appropriate. Not a bad version."
"Thick creamy mouthfeel. Big flavors of fig, honey suckle, caramel malt, cassis, toffee. Residual sweetness is a tad high. Not much carbonation. A little too sweet for my liking to drink in abundance. But an overall tastey beer."
"The Arcadia Scotch Ale is a masterful beer by a great brewery. Thanks!"
"Drinkability: very easy drinking and a decent session brew. Well worth giving this a try."
"it's good."
"Bought this at Woodman's in Appleton (which has yet to be accepted as a store on the BA site). This sixer cost me $6.49 but sells at another local establishment for $8.39. Now, if I could only get the Imperial Stout and"
"Better than most of the standard Arcadia brews. Dark amber / brown-ruby. Nice firm head retention, lightly tanned. Smells quite malty, with a nutty, caramel, toffee, and chocolate flavor that melds together wonderfully. Noticable alcohol in the flavor, and mouthfeel, becomes a bit phenolic, but light. Medium to firm body that remains quite drinkable. The sweetness could use a bit more hopping to contribute balance and character. Finishes a bit sweet and a bit rough. Roughness from harsh carbonation and alcoholic strength without the depth to mask."
"Quite a bit of depth and complexity in the flavor. A bit more balanced than some Scotch Ales, in that the malty sweetness isnt as much of a presence. Still, this is a big beer. It has generous amounts of malt that have several interesting and well-blended flavor characteristics."
"Overall a stunningly original and poised example of this style. There have been too many overly cloying and syrupy renditions to where I've almost avoided diving back into this style. I'm certainly glad I gave this one a try. Only wish I would have tried it in November, but better late than never!"
"This brew pours an opaque brown almost black color. The head is three-fingers in height, billowy, and rocky. The aroma is of caramel and cream. The taste is of caramel, toffee, cream. The mouthfeel is amazingly smooth and on the fuller side of medium bodied. Overall, this is a very solid brew. I will certainly have this again."
"Brought a bottle back from my trip to Madison, think it came from Woodman's."
"drinkability: enjoyable and pretty easy drinking"
"I think this is a fairly drinkable beer. It didn't blow me away by any means but it is one that I will buy again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head above the slightly cloudy brown brew, with burgundy highlights. Head diminshes slowly, with heavy lacing. Aroma is malty sweetness with tinges of alcohol. Taste is grain husks, with a green hoppy character, with alcohol apparent on the swallow, with a slight burn and generous warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability are not bad, but the flavor could be a bit more masking of the alcohol."
"Thanks to the young William BigHuge Wallace for this one, the best of the 3 Arcadias to wing my way for sure. Slainte Mhath! Slainte Mhor!"
"Solid, yet unremarkable. Pours a deep ruby amber into my glass. Aroma is syrupy, almost like frozen grape juice. Taste is good, malty, but a tad clingy and cloying. Mouthfeel is thick, carbonation is nice. A good beer, but perhaps a tad too thick and run-of-the-mill."
"Not bad, but not great. Probably my least favorite offering from Arcadia so far."
"Nice black colour, with a bit of head. But did not deliver but a faint taste of licorice and molasses. Malt. Recently bought. Some numbing carbonation. Medium mouthfeel. More of an Inoffensive brown ale, particularly since licorice on the aftertaste."
"Inviting caramel and coffee aromas with earthy wafts from hops and some alcohol. Crisp flavors are toffe and caramel. Initially acidic but not tart. Medium-full body and dextrinous mouthfeel. Roasted malts linger in the finish that could use more IBUs"
"I had this in a bottle at my local watering hole. One could smell the sweet malty aroma typical of Scotch ales. The head was minimal with little lace on the glass. The color was a deep amber burgandy hue. The taste was the aroma magnified. It had a glorious sweet malty toasty taste. The sweetness was not cloying. The body was a little thin, but this made it even more drinkable. A fine effort from a brewery I'm not overly familiar with(I hope to remedy that)."
"Very dark brown, even darker than cola colored body, head fades in the blink of an eye, until nothing is left except a couple of specks on the dark surface. Smell is sweet and malty, and a smell similar to potting soil (not in a bad way, though). Taste is sweet, with carmel, sweet apples, a touch of alcohol, and some slightly nutty flavors. Mouthfeel has a low carbonation level, but this is a very smooth drinking, yet strong and delicious beer. This makes up for the Battle Creek Reserve disaster that I recently had from Arcadia."
"Dark brown appearance with chestnut-colored highlights. Smallish head, last about half a minute at the most. Very little lace to speak of. Impressively malty aroma, accompanied by a little anise and tobacco as well. Mouthfeel is medium along with carbonation, fairly hefty but not at all sticky. Candyish flavors, caramel, candy popcorn with a touch of diacetyl, slightly cashew nutty. Just a slight sense of bitterness, no real chance to put a finger on the hop impression. Pretty good beer at hanging on to its flavor and agreeable mouthfeel, dries a bit to a dusky unsweetened cocoa at the close. An enjoyable brew."
"The beer is very smooth though. Good drinkability with this scotch ale. I would drink another one of these."
"Overall, despite the relatively high alcohol content and really full flavor, this is a surprisingly easy beer to drink. Perhaps better suited for a fall or winter night than one at the end of July, but...."
"Pours a very dark brown color. Not quite black, but close. A nice tan colored head rises from the beer, but leaves quickly. This beer smells sweet and malty, maybe a little nutty as well. The taste is milder than I had expected at first, but that gives way to a sweet, carmelly, syrupy, and warm-as-hell aftertaste that just sticks and sticks and sticks. I also notice chocolate and maybe some fruity notes. This one is definitly heavy-bodied. Any heavier and we'd be slugging out of an Aunt Jemima's bottle. It's really warm going down, seems much higher than the listed 7.5% which is still very nice. The drinkability is good as long as I sip it slowly. I'm sure I'll be trying this one again, along with other beers of the same style to compare. Cheers!"
"This beer is not highly drinkable, and surely wasn't intended to be a session beer. It also rates fairly low on the ""would I like another"" scale. Not nearly as well done as the last Arcadia brew I had (the nut brown ale). I'm glad I was able to try it, though, as Arcadia brews are not available in the area."
"Poured out a dark brown with a smallish tan head. Spotty lacing and a short lived head. Sweet caramel malt and a strong nutty character. There was an odd burnt smell as well that was a bit detracting. Flavor starts off with a kick of caramel malt and a light roastiness. Some earthy qualities but the odd burnt flavor is present in the taste. It tasted like almost an over roasted malt that didnt quite fit in. Seemed more like a brown ale over all to me. Mouthfeel was about medium and quite creamy and smooth. Pretty drinkable stuff despite the off flavor. Decent beer just not what I would want out of a scotch ale."
"A good tasting, easy drinker."
"Uncle Hamish says: ""Whut tha' fuch dew ye Yanks know abou' ale anyway!? ...Mm, tha's gewd."""
"Cloudy reddish-brown, has a small foamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass, has a sweet fruity, bready and nutty aroma. Nice sweet fruity, smokey plum and caramel flavors, nice sweetness in the finish, medium body with a smooth creamy mouthfeel, not bad."
"Smooth and easy going with light carbonation in a medium-full body. Good tasting beer and soothing in the mouth."
"I just really like Arcadia beers. It feels like -my- beer. It's not great or inspiring or delicious. It just makes me smile."
"Smell is a good combination of malty dark and earthy scents with a generally smooth texture. Pure and calm malts on the nose turn to something different flavorwise, as either chocolate malts or roasted barley were used in abundance. Acrid toasty bitterness washes over a decent backbone of pale malts. Had the attenuation and mouthfeel of the style but almost stout-like roast pungency.... But when I come back to this beer a couple more times, each one is much more rounded and smooth, showing more smooth maltiness."
"Bister hue, with flashes of hazy garnet when held to light. Steadfast one fingered, dense, light beige head leaves lace. Dilute light roast coffee, with hints of molasses and earthy hop in aroma. Dark toffee hints arise as the beer warms. Tame, but well rounded aromawise. Incipient in flavor is a snap of acidic roasted grain, which is immediately superceded by stalwart, deeply caramelized malt. Virtually bereft of esters, save a raisiny twang complementary to the static sweet toffee presence. Mild notes of baker's chocolate and grainy biscuit surface as the beer breathes. Nearly full in body, with an agreeably dextrinous mouthfeel that suits the malt backbone well. Finishes with hints of candied nuts and more molasses, but not at all cloying in that regard. A well crafted scotch ale. Not as complex as some, but more balanced than most. Tasty. Thanks to Huge for the delivery."
"Overall a beer I wouldn't turn down and if it was accessable by me I'd buy 12 or so a year...still not a top tier scotch ale by any means...lacks the heftiness and sweetness I desire in a true wee heavy but not a bad brew by any means."
"Marginal as is."
"An interesting beer, but probably not on the list for a re-order."
"Thanks Hugey, this one's more like it!"
"Dark brown pour with light white head. Smells like roasted malts, smoke, and chocolate. Hits you with an unexpected full taste. Malts run wild along with slight chocolate notes and moderate alcohol taste. Very big beer here. Robust all around and some interesting flavors are found within. Full bodied and good carbonation, very drinkable beer. I was impressed."
"Very good beer, but its maltiness forces me to limit myself to 2. Definitely a once in a while treat."
"Mouthfeel is good and medium thick, while the drinkability was also in the good range. Solid beer."
"Drinkability  I was hoping for something a bit more wee heavy out of this one, but it was a tasty Scotch Ale nevertheless."
"After disemboguing from the 12 ounce brown bottle it sets in the glass a beclouded brown, the head modest and light tan, the lace a thin shield to protect the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and crisp to the senses, start carries the sweetness from the nose, nice malt presence, and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a mediocre acidic bite, the hops pleasing to the palate; aftertaste is dry, a nice drinking beer and a nice change of pace from the bad boyz I seem to sample much to often!"
"Pours a tawny brown with a slightly off white head,aroma is rainy and fruity with almost a vanolla note.Taste is of burnt fruit and raisins with a biscuit malt back bone with a pleasant soft fruitiness thru the finish.A real nice night cap beer even better than expected,another good one from Arcadia."
"Wow, Many thanks to CRJMellor for this sample. An overlooked brewery on my part, this Scotch Ale has opened my interest. It pours a very dark ruby that cascades to a soft, small tan head. No lace is left behind. A sweet aroma of butterscotch malt show's the way. This beer is smooth, easy to drink even-though the alcohol level is up. The taste has a soft alcohol hint to it. The taste is more of a candied beer. Lots of malt, mixed well with caramel, toffee and even a hint of vanilla in the sweetness. The mouth is pleased with a butter-like feel. Dispite the ABV, this would make a good anytime beer or at least a good dessert beer."
"Thanks marburg."
"This is a very tastey beer. Goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more! Quenches thirst well."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a dark brown, almost black color with one finger of head that dies off quickly. There is very little lacing. The smell is rich in slightly roasted malts and alcohol. Smells more like a single malt than a scotch ale. The taste is also very very malty, not a bit of hops in sight. Dark chewy malts and bits of caramel and toffee dominate. A good little alcohol punch as well. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability suffers a little due to the 7.5% not being masked very well. Not a bad Scotch Ale."
"Props to CRJMellor for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and alcohol warming very apparent. Absolutely delicious, which I could find it more often."
"Average, no more, no less."
"This isn't a particularly loud or boisterious brew. It seems content to be mellow. But that's not to be mistaken for lacking in depth of character. Arcadia Scotch Ale has a creamy milkshake feel to it, primarily in the nose. Oaky wood chips and buttery smoothness. Deep and robust flavor reminds me of malted milk balls and sweet, sugar-coated mixed-nuts -- almonds perhaps? Down to earth peanut butter smoothness. Surprisingly, this isn't that heavy of a brew. And the alcohol hides itself well behind smoked woodchips and malty sweetness. Balanced to perfection; you simply can't tell where one phase of this beer ends and another begins."
"Pours out to a brownish to amber color in the glass. Nose gives off faint hint of liquor and malt. Taste is good, but not remarkable. There is a slight taste of butterscotch and malt that gives way to a swallow that allows for the presence of the alcohol. A nice interpretation of the style, but not a beer you would choose to drink all night."
"A dark amber ale with a slight head that faded quickly leaving no lace at all. Aroma is sweet malt with and a plumb like aroma. Medium to full bodied and very smooth. Flavor is typical for a Scotch ale with a strong sweet maltiness. Has quite a punch and a bit warming."
"This brew poured a transparent dark brown colored body and a medium head of fine mostly lasting bubbles. It had a strong malt aroma and a fizzy coffee flavor with good lacing. It was smooth initially and finished very strong. We had this at the festival in Frankenmuth, MI."
"This is one alcoholic tasting drink. I taste the alcohol the whole way through and it is strong. That's not always a bad thing but here it almost goes overboard with alcohol taste. Once I get past the alcohol I taste roasted almonds and some woody flavors in this beer. It finishes slightly bitter but not too strong. All in all a good drink."
"This Scotch Ale poured a tan head with medium bubbles. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. It had an amber colored body. The taste of this brew was smooth which is much to my liking. It had no bitter taste to it. This was indeed a good drink."
"Nice slightly off-white head. Creamy in a stout-like way. Decent lacing. Dark purple beer. Really not much of an aroma. If you try real hard, there are hints of cherry and oak. Lovely taste. Slightly sweet. Some woody flavors. Very nice, semi-sweet aftertaste and clean mouthfeel."
"A very, very dark cherry mahogany body with lovely ruby accents. The brew is clear and has a small beige head that departs very quickly. Insignificant lacing from the residual. The nose is light and hints of toasted malt and toffee. The taste starts much like a porter but as the brew warms begins to show its Scottich side as it becomes less roasted in flavor and a bit more malty. Smooth and easy body with just a bit of ending crispness, a very small bit. Light hints of alcohol despite its relatively high ABV, so this must be fairly well balanced beer. Seems as if it crosses styles and is not as true to the Scottish heritage as its name implies."
"Nice looking brew pours out to a clear mahogany color with pretty ruby highlights and forms a thin, but creamy light tan head atop small to medium-sized bubbles. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is potent with caramel, toffee, nutty character, and a fruity ferment. Hops are barely there, with no smoke character noted. Mouthfeel is extremely soft and smooth with a medium body. Lacing is sparse. Taste begins unpleasantly with some strong and nasty off-character fusel and isopropyl alcohols, leading into a metallic note, but halfway through, this beer becomes tolerable. The wet, soft finish is characterized by nutty, toffee amber malts with a subtle light molasses note and some faint rubbery hops. Smoke is not perceptable. It looks nice and has a nice finish, but that's not enough to make me want to recommend this brew to anyone, even Scotch Ale lovers. It seems these Peter Austin systems make all beers taste the same...this is the 3rd brewery I've tasted to use them, and they all brew unimpressive beers. Yawn..."
"This beer poured a reddish/brown color with a small head that left a lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is mostly of malt. Flavor also is mostly malt. This is an ok beer, but I think it would benefit from a bit more hops as it is a little sweet for my tastes."
"This is one very tasty and drinkable beer. So far my favorite from Arcadia."
"Pours a deep amber brown, with almost no head... looks just like it should. Aroma of smoked peat, caramel, and alcohol. Quite pleasant on the tongue: sweet caramel notes to begin with, followed by some light smoke flavor, just a touch of bitterness, and some noticable alcohol. Has a nice warming effect. Full bodied with low carbonation. An excellent representation of a Strong Scottish Ale."
"Part of an Arcadia sampler: I found this to be a really good Scotch Ale. Poured a dark brown color with minimal head and thin lacing. Aroma of malt, cinnamon and alcohol. Flavor is stong malt with caramel and alcohol present, along with a zippy tongue feel. This is one of the better Arcadia brews I have tried so far. This beer is also deceptive in that it feels like you are drinking a higher-alcohol beer than you actually are."
"This beer was black as sin and had a light bubbly head that that left some oily lace.  The aroma was of malt and sweetness with a slight hint of alcohol.  The flavor was of malt and some sweetness I could not place.  The body was lighter than some others of this style, but not a bad start for this company."
