"Pleasantly surprised with this beer, one of the more enjoyable scotch ales, as the alcohol is not too in your face. Usually not a fan of linenkugels beers, but this beer was 4 bucks and was 2 years old so I figured ""What the hell"". Overall, I wouldn't seek it out but it was a pleasant experience and I would recommend picking up a single if you get the chance."

"Well, this beer was certainly an adventure.  As a wee heavy, it’s an utter headscratcher, but as a sour ale it’s a rather creative interpretation, with the prominent dose of anise integrating remarkably well with the tartness.  The alcohol strikes a good balance between character and concealment, allowing it to remain highly drinkable in spite of approaching double-digit ABV.  Leinenkugel’s craft arm has shown promise in some of its other offerings as well, even if they haven’t quite hit the bulls-eye just yet.  This is worth trying if only for the novel experience, and even more so for the sour ale aficionado."

"Found this at a local shop (2012 vintage) and scooped one up. Not too thrilled when I noticed Leinenkugel on the label (which I associate with the annoying TV commercials about shandy), but got over it. Decided to perform a memory charm (to you Harry Potter fans) to wipe the negative associations away before trying it. I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed. Poured a deep, chocolate brown, with ruby edges when held into the light. 2mm of head dissipated quickly to nil. The aromas were v. nice and opened up more as the brew warmed in my snifter. Molasses, tobacco, figs and raisins, a hint of apple. Mellow nose, yet complex. The taste was initially sweet, with strong hints of those dark fruits and the tobacco note, slight breadiness. I'd like to side by side with a fresh one. I have a feeling that this was improved with a couple years on it. Mouthfeel nailed it... smooth with a nice lingering taste. All damn enjoyment here, folks. Try this. I am not going to sleep on Leinenkugel again, though I might hold off on the shandy. Cheers!"

"Pours brown in color with copper edges and a finger of beige head that dissipates rather quickly. The nose is an exceptional blend of maltiness and breadiness. The flavor follows the nose. The mouthfeel is sticky and hearty. Sweet notes come on in the finish along with a mild but clearly out-of-place tartiness."

"Excellent Wee Heavy from Leinenkugel. Pours dark brown to ruby red with light head and light lacing on the glass. Smell of peat, caramel, moderately roasted grains, and a hint of dark plums. Thick mouthfeel with syrupy sweet roasted malts up front, heavy caramel malts, sweet plums, and a light tinged hop bitterness that gives into a nice contrast to the booziness of this Wee Heavy on the back. Complex and earthy. Almost a scotch ale. I hate to say it, but I would think that this beer suffers with the identity of the brewer. It is a solid offering and a great addition to the Leinie's family."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, best before 1/15/2014. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, cherry, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light nuttiness, light smoke, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, cherry, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light nuttiness, light smoke, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, light nuttiness, light smoke, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice scotch ale style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"I don't know if the bottle was bad or improperly stored but, this is something i will NOT buy again. The smell was sweet as others reviewed but, this bottle had know malt it was all sour Tartness, not hoppy bitter but sour! I have tasted a few scotch ales so far and this did not taste anywhere near the others. Too thin in the mouth feel. I poured it out because I could not stand the way the sourness was overpowering , it was almost like a sour of something that has spoiled like a dairy product."
"For a Wee Heavy, it is wonderful. Taste very similar to Scotty Karate from Dark Horse, it is a great sipping beer. It starts off with a bitter bite but ends with almost no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and the nose is sublime. Will definitely be enjoying this wonderful brew again."

"By far the best of the evening was the Big Eddy."
"On the sweet, fruity side of the style-spectrum. Just enough peat to balance it. This is an enjoyable sipper!"
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color. No head, lacing, or retention. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, and slight syrup. Fits the style of a Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of oatmeal, and slight syrup. Overall, very weak appearance, good body, and decent aroma."

"O - A pretty tasty take on the style. I would have liked a bit more fullness in the nose to savor, especially with that big ABV available to deliver it. The level of toast in the malt bill does a great job of balancing the sugars so they don't make this beer too sweet to enjoy. I know I liked it enough after the first couple of bottles to make a point of grabbing a second four-pak. What's interesting about this beer is the way the burnt wood shows up only in the back-end of the finish, giving it a campfire feel."

"O - This is a flavorful beer with the flavors being sweet and malty. This is a decent beer. It is a tad sweet for me though."
""
"Pours an almost opaque dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toffee, and slight smoke aromas. There is also a slight funk smell that I am getting as the beer warms up. Taste is much the same with smoke and band-aid flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a smell that is quite sweet and sugary but it doesn't really show in the taste."

""
"D - not for the faint of palate. But enjoyable."
""
""
""

"O- very enjoyable. havent had many of this style so cant wait to expand."
""
""
"Overall a nice beer, but not as rich and flavorful as some other Scotch Ales. The lemony notes provide a pleasantly dry finish and some balance, but I don't believe it's necessary in this style. It should be all about deep, rich malt flavors, even at the expense of a dry finish. I prefer a Scotch Ale with a sweeter finish."
""
""
""
"overall meh, nothing special, too much smoked malt that doesn't go far, and nothing else really. Hops try to do something but can't even compete, everything else pretty much drowns out. Is this a smoked malt beer or a scotch ale?!"
""
""
""
"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a dark orange-brown amber with a fine one finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of plum, dark stone fruit, sweet caramel malt, peat, lightly sour. Flavor follows with caramel malt, dark stone fruit, light bitterness; malty with a nice hint of peat. Oddly thin in the finish. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. A reasonable domestic take on this style, but not as full flavored or complex as I expected for such a high ABV ale. Fun to drink, but not quite a top scotch ale."
"THANKS EVAN, you rule mate!"
""
"Overall: Heard a lot about this beer and mostly good things. Not a big fan. While I love Scotch ales, this one's after taste is just too rusty and weird. I have always believed that good beers do not linger after a sip for more than 20 seconds. This one lingered too long. If you like Scotch ales, and I do, go for the Oskar Blues Grill & Brew Old Chub or the Belhaven Wee Heavy...even the Dogfish Head Indian Brown ale is sort of a Scotch ale. Cheers!!"

"OVERALL: Color me impressed. Most leinenkugels beers have no character and taste horrible. This is a nice departure from the norm."
""
""

"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Nice clear ruby color. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Dark fruit and caramel nose, flavor is dark fruit and caramel, hints of the higher ABV. Decent scotch ale. $3.29 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
""
"Clear mahogany, thin khaki head. Big dark fruit flavors - plum, grape, and cherry. Thick toffee, biscuit, and a faint roastiness. Alcohol is rather strong in the nose. Mild bitterness that leaves just a ghost of astringency on the finish. A pretty decent shot at the style, worth a try to get your malt fix."
""
""
"this is a nice one by them, one of the few. usually this line is hit or miss, (i do mean the big eddy), so it's nice to have a hit!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really loved Big Eddy RIS so I was really looking forward to the Scotch Ale. Unfortunately, I found the alcohol to be a bit overbearing and the rest of the flavors to not come together as well here as in other Scotch ales. I will finish up more four pack, but will not rush out to get this again."
""
"O: I'm really glad Leine's surprised me with this one. This is a great example of the style IMO because it really has all the elements it should, particularly the peat and smoke. If they had ramped up the malt profile a bit, maybe with bigger caramel, toffee, and sweet notes, this would have been an out of this world beer."
"Enjoyable and good."
""
""
""
""
"O - I really liked this beer. I had an Old Chub earlier and followed up with this to compare. This had a much stronger smell and taste to it. Old Chub is great, but it is more subdued than this beer. The peat and the dark fruit have a distinct presence and make it stand out from the other Scotch Ales I've have. I will definitely drink this again. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very fruit forward here. Big rustic malts as well, there was only a hint of roast and no smokiness but the fruit made up for it. Pretty good for the style. The big eddy series is on a roll. (except for the DIPA)"
""
""
""
"overall: this is one of the most delicious beers I've had in a long time. been getting into scotch ales recently, and this is my favorite thus far. i know it doesn't have the highest BA rating, but it is absolutely one to try."
""
""
"Really good on tap."
"Pours a a very dark brown with just a touch of red when the light hits it just right. It has a medium light head to it with a nice darker almond color when it is there. The lacing can be a wee heavy(pun intended) and linger on the glass. It smells of burnt brown sugar (ala creme bruľe) with the slightest touch of peat. The taste overall is kind of sweet with a bitterness that hits the back of your tongue with a Smokey peat flavour that lingers and completes the experience. The mouthfeel is thin but hints at syrup with a touch of carbonation. Over all this is a delightful beer especially for those who enjoy a a touch of smokiness in their adult beverages."

"Half finger off white head with poor retention on a murky amber brown body. Some lacing. Aroma is very sweet with lots of dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar and burnt caramel. Flavors of sour citrus, dark fruit mostly plum, burnt oak, roasted nuts, molasses and chocolate. Medium chewy body and moderate carbonation. Very complex and full flavored. One of the better I have had of the style."
"O- first commercial wee heavy i've had since Schell's 2012 Wee Heavy. It's nice, i would have liked a little better head retention to seal the deal, but overall it's almost exactly what I was hoping it would be. I drank it in an oversized wine glass, and I'm gonna try a pint glass and a slightly more aggressive pour to see if that helps the head out. I know I should cellar the rest of the 4 pack i have, but to hell with it, this is delicious. Cheers."

"This is a nice brew that really packs a punch. No doubt it is cloying. The nose is full of floral and caramel notes that lend well to the style. Mouthfeel is very sweet. Lots of sugar left behind. Overall a big cloying brew... but not in a bad way. Liked it."

"overall -enjoyable scotch ale, a nice sipper to keep you warm"
"Cheers!"
"Though the dry peat taste is moderate and the malt sweetness is lumbering, this beer is indeed complex and strong, and the peat influence is strong- all of which create a sense of power and complexity."

"He's big, but only a wee bit heavy... ...sorry... Anyway, this stuff pours a deep ruby-brown topped by over a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, clove, brown sugar, light molasses, a pinch of black pepper, and a smidge of fig. The taste brings in more of the same at the start, but as things progress a definite sense of strong banana weaves its way betwixt all the other flavors. It gets pretty damn strong at times, competing directly with the spicy roast for my tastebuds' attentions and detracting from the overall wee heavy experience. Near the finish, this banana bit starts to appear a bit toasted. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a decently solid Scotch ale, but one whose banana character holds it down."
"D - A very nice Wee Heavy here from Leinenkugels... There Big Eddy line of brews has some very nice offerings... This one is a sipper... A nice brew to sit back and unwind with... I would gladly drink again and recommend to fans of the Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy style..."

"I think I might've gotten an infected bottle or a bad batch. Either way, this was pretty nasty, and not a scotch ale I would buy again."
""
""
"Overall not a bad scotch ale / wee heavy. Would definitely drink this again when I'm in the mood. It wasn't amazing by my standards, but it wasn't bad by any means. If you enjoy a big, malty beer I think that this is worth your time, at least once."

"Overall i am pleased with my first taste of the big eddy series and look forward to more of them."
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. It's got a very intriguing palate and complexity to it."
""
""
"O - This is a nice wee heavy. The Big Eddy series is pretty good."
"Overall - Doesn't have everything I want in a Scotch Ale, but it's quite a lot more interesting than Berry Weiss."

"The palate, however, is mildly disappointing. Opening with plenty of malt character, this has some heavily toasted malt, burnt sugar bitterness, toffee, some grainy astringency and is, in general, rather intense. The leather pairs quite well with the dark brown sugar and dark caramel, but ultimately, the lack of balance is to the beer's detriment. Nice flavors of rum and raisins are also present. Rather dry and highly carbonated, this beer finishes with flavors of burnt sugar , brown sugar and some sweetness. Some earthy hop bitterness is noticeable as well. Medium-light in body, this beer is quite nice on the palate but for the high carbonation. As it warms up and the carbonation dies down, it improves significantly, and I'm upping my T score to 3.5."
"This is a mediocre Scotch Ale. The apple notes are intense in both aroma and flavor. It's much better than the usual Leinenkugal offerings, but I probably wouldn't have this again."

"This is pretty run of the mill as wee-heavys go. So far big Eddy has failed to impress me. This is a stye I love, but this one is noting special, but would do in pinch"
""
""
"Pours very dark, but still barely transparent with a small tan-yellow head. The smell is unlike any other wee heavy I've had. The smell is very sweet, and smells mostly of tobacco. The taste is pretty much more of the same. I knew it would be sweet, but was still rather taken aback by the astounding sweetness I was affronted with. I love sweet beers and after a few sips, I was OK with the level of sweetness, but it's definitely the sweetest beer of the style that I've encountered and at first I thought it was too much. It also has a smoky, tobacco-like taste and a roasted malt bitterness. It's VERY sticky. It's definitely within style, but is an extreme example of the characteristics with which the style is generally described. VERY sweet, VERY alcoholic, VERY smoky, particularly tobacco-like flavours, and ALL bitterness is roasted malt-derived. This is an extreme example of the style, so be prepared. It's not bad if you're into that kind of thing, but it's right on the edge of being over-the-top."
""
""
"O - This one started to grow on me as it warmed up in my glass. I don't know if I would buy another one anytime soon, but I'm not against trying it again when they release it."
""
""
""
"A solid scotch ale. Displays the all-important smokiness. I enjoy it much more than the other Big Eddys."

"On tap yesterday at Tyler's in Durham.Poured a deep amber-brown with a nice sticky 1/2 finger off white head,nice color defination and a nice head to the pour.Alot of caramel in the nose it seemed to dominate a bit,lighter dark fruit and even a little faint wood/smoke wich was nice.Caramel toffee/butterscotch flavors abound wich isn't really a bad thing but it was dominant,there is a decent woody/earthy notes in the finish.My first Big Eddy try and I thought it was pretty good,a little sweet but not bad."
"Overall - It's not a bad beer, but it is not one that I will purchase again. There are some nice flavors here, but really no depth or complexity, and the mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery. As this warms, the booze picks up too. I loved the Big Eddy RIS, but this scotch ale seems to falter a bit."
""
""
""
"Beer is malty and heavy with a thin forward with alcohol, very boozy, strong on the palate. It is a big big beer, not for the light hearted, a very big Scotch ale. It is probably not a repeat for me but I did enjoy it."
"Nice as it is, though, I'm not overly impressed. A solid offering, and another nice one from the Big Eddy series. Nothing wrong with it, I could use a little more in there. Also, the high alcohol is not having any effect, until…whoa, here it comes..."
""
""
"Overall – fruit forward with limited dark malt presence"
""
""
"Served on tap in a snifter at Lucky Monk. Appearance is a deep red/brown with minimal head and lacing the nose features sweet molasses and caramel. Zero hop character present, a hint of smokiness present. Taste is very sweet with some candied fruit, caramel, toffee, and a touch of breadiness. The mouthfeel is light and thin, seems off for the style and abv. Overall, this is a lackluster wee heavy. The flavor is minimal and watered down, this certainly does not meet the level of quality that the Big Eddy RIS."
""
"Wee Heavy Scotch Ale poured a darker brown color, with nice sized head that quickly disapated. The smell was a bit lighter, and a little boozy. The taste had a nice sharp bite, and notes of black licorice, but was a bit watery. Flavor could have been fuller, but wasn't too watery. Overall not a bad beer, better then other lenienkugel beers."
"Overall: This is an enjoyable beer, but I feel a little let down by the lack of powerfull smokey notes and how quickly the tastes dissipate and lack of a strong mouthfeel, but I could easily drink this with a nice steak or pork for those reasons and be happy."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking deep brown color with a tan head on top. The lacing was a little sticky and the retention was pretty good too. The smell of the beer had a lot of earthy smokey malts on the nose. The taste of the beer was a little smokier than I expected. I think that the smoke in this one is a little too heavy for this style. The sweetness of the beer is spot on though. The mouthfeel is oily and thick with a gentle carbonation to it. Overall I liked the beer, I can't see buying a lot of them but I didn't love it or hate. It's worth trying in my opinion."
""
"This isn't in the same league as the Big Eddy RIS. The smoke, while not bad, is a surprise, & everything else plays off of it. Pretty good, but seems a bit underdeveloped."
"Overall – This is a really nice tasting brew. A wonderful brew to sit back and relax with; very quite soothing and warming."
"Not a huge Leinenkugel fan but this was delicious."
"O- not a bad beer or wee heavy. If you like the style it's a good beer for your money."
""
"O= Not bad. I like my scotch ales and this is a good smokey scotch. Check this out and enjoy it. I know I did. The Big Eddy series is solid so far."
""
"Overall not a bad Wee Heavy by far. It's sweet and has a great body. Also packs a punch. Much better than the RIS by far!"
"O- A very good beer, however it seems a bit overly sweet for the style. Not enough toasted flavor for my taste. While it definitely is good, here's definitely better choices for the style. With the hefty price tag I highly doubt I'll end up drinking this again. Worth the try if you're a Leinenkugal's fan though."
"VERY NICE, GET IT A GO!"

"Tis beer pours a medium bodied cherry wood in color with a one finger beige colored head. The foamy head only lasted a couple minutes. It smells of plenty of sweet malts, toffee, light butterscotch, and caramelized sugar with an ever so slight bitterness in the finish. The flavors are nice and complex. It features an array of malt flavors such as toffee, caramel, cocoa, cherry, butterscotch, and cream. It's surprisingly well rounded. The cocoa comes around a bit more n the after taste. It's sweet without being overpowering and the lighter mouthfeel probably aids that. It drinks on the lighter side of medium in body but isn't sticky at all. The aftertaste is really nice. It's interesting. Overall I thought this was a fantastic scotch ale. The Big Eddy series mpressed once again!"
""
""
"Overall - This was certainly an interesting beer. It's got a complex but not quite perfect flavor and the overall feel of the beer makes it hard to appreciate the flavors this has to offer. It's nice to see Leinie's is trying to enter the craft beer market but I really was expecting something better out of this"
"The beer pours a medium brown with a tan head. The aroma is very nice and exactly what I want in a wee heavy. I get a lot of dark fruit and some peet malt, as well as some caramel and some alcohol. The flavor is more of the same. The alcohol and dark fruit notes are dominant, with the caramel and toffee malt and a little bit of smoke hiding in the background. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"The body is medium with enough going on to stay interesting. It's a bit smooth but not completely, with a touch of a crisp note just in the front. It goes just a touch thinnish, likely from the alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not exceptional, but a very decent effort from Leinie."
"O-Leinie's Big Eddy series does it again. A wee heavy that ranks up there with the best."
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and I thought that it was a good example of a Wee Heavy, most everything seemed on par with this beer expect for the aroma and the body. This beer was pretty drinkable for a Wee Heavy, just about as drinkable as Dirty Bastard, and it hides it's alcohol really well, I could drink another one if I had it, pretty impressive for the style. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the nice and complex flavors, this beer looked damn good and the added peat smoke flavors made for a nice and complex Wee Heavy. What I like least about this beer was the aroma and the body, the aroma was going in the right direction till I got to the out of place sour and vinegar aromas and the body could have been just a little thicker. I might buy a single of this beer again if I feel like it, but it for sure doesn't come close to knocking off Dirty Bastard as my go to Wee Heavy. If you are a Wee Heavy fan you should give this beer a try, I found everything except the aroma to be on par for the style. I thought that this was a pretty solid Wee Heavy and with a little work on the aroma and body it could be able to hold it's own against some of the big names of the style. I wasn't to impressed with the Big Eddy RIS. but I found this beer to be a nice improvement and I am for sure down to check out more beers from the Big Eddy series, if the trend continues and these beers keep improving then there will be some great things to look forwards in this series. Good job Leinenkugels, thanks for making limited release beers for the connoisseurs, we appreciate it."

"A decent attempt at a scotch ale from this brewery. Very drinkable and you could barely taste the 9.5%. The only problem was that those were the only two qualities that stood out. The rest of the beer was just kind of one dimensional."
""
"Overall, the Scotch Ale style is really growing on me. This one isn't quite great yet, but very good."
""
""
"Overall: Nice flavors that have the potential to blend with a little more time, at a price that's tough to pass up, I feel I can support this endeavor."
"An interesting beer that will allow you to really expand your palate, and is nice with a hefty steak in front of you."
""
"Deep beautiful amber color with a 1 finger brownish head. Nice looking beer. Big boozey nose with burnt caramel and dried dark fruits. Medium in body. Sweet burnt caramel up front rounded out by a lightly kilned malt taste and some alcohol. Low carbonation. Creamy, thins out slightly on the finish. Reminds me of some ancient scotch ale, unrefined and very raw. Big bold one note flavors that have their moment in your mouth then fizzle. Decent but the alcohol is very noticeable."
""
""
""
"O - With relatively low expectations I was overly impressed with this Leinenkugels treat. It's refreshing to see a non-craft brewery stepping in and showing they have a true understanding of the brewing climate as it is today and ultimately being a part of it."
""

"12oz bottle, 2012. Pours mahogany with a very thin head that leaves no lacing on the glass. Aroma literally fills the room - sweet, earthy, caramel, peat, and wood. Tastes are earthy, boozy, woody, peaty, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, smoky, musty, and faintly peppery on the finish. Alcohol is well concealed. Mouth is full bodied; slightly cloying and with the high ABV it's definitely a sipper. Good representation of the style. I enjoyed this one, and perhaps the consistency of this one is off because I did not encounter some of the nastiness that others seem to be getting this this one. Leinie haters perhaps? I thought it was good."
"Overalll: Ignoring style and cost this might get a 2-2.5. Taking those into consideration it gets dinged a bit further."
"The hard part to get over is Leinenkugel's is making craft style ales that are up nearing 10% abv yet they pour like fizzy yellow carbonated beers. The color is nailed a deep ruby nearly mahogany body with a light khaki head forming thick, and dwindling and fading fast, specks of lace are said...this beer misses the boat on appearance. Aroma has tart fruit notes, dark ripened raisins a bit of booze marinating those plump jewels of shriveled grape. Definite caramel notes a hint of smoked malts, and a tart apple cider lingering quality in each sniff. Flavor harsh acidic grape juice with ripened raisins and fake oak chips with a strong booze overriding the whole experience, each sip makes want to gag, this is truly the worst pseudo craft sin I've come across yet I will drink a six pack of the Anheuser Busch Wild Blue before I ever reach for this again. I honestly have a headache from the first sip, drain pour with a capital D, get out of here cloying gag inducing sips of unrefined malt sugars floating around in a watery substance. Prolonged alcohol burn in each sip, burns the back of your throat down to your gut. Overall get out of dodge stay the fuck away from this beer, please do not enter...truly horrible creation and a sorry excuse for any beer let alone something attempting to be a craft beer."

"Overall, this is was a great wee heavy. I am super impressed with Leines on this one. One of the better wee heavys I have had. It is extremely drinkable for how high the abv. Don't go into thinking this is going to be bad because it's from Leines. It is legit."
"Overall, a decent ale. Better than most brews from Leinenkugel."
""
"O - While rich and complex, Leinie's Big Eddy Wee Heavy never gets completely in-your-face or potent, rather, like an introvert, invites you to discover it's depth and balance quietly and patiently. Surprisingly drinkable for it's boastful 9.5%, this Wee Heavy is definitely worth it's weight in shillings."
"O - I like their RIS much better, but this is a decent effort. However, there are many better wee heavies out there (e.g. Backwoods Bastard). Maybe this would be more complex with some age on it."
"Pours a medium brown color with a slight head. Scent is mostly of malts, but some hints of oak and nuts are present. The taste is more than you would expect from the smell. There is a smooth, malty tone in the taste that is reasonably bold. There are also some citrus, earthy hints hidden within. A refreshing beer that has great drinkability to go alone with a decent taste. Would like to see a little better price on it, but what can you do?"
"The taste nails the style wonderfully. Some nice complexity to it also. A worthy brew."
"I'll definitely be picking up some more for salting away : )"

"A translucent mahogany with an inch of tan foam that faded quickly and didn't leave much lacing. Smell was softly malty, some dark fruit, slightly sweet, overall mild and hard to ascertain. Taste was dark cherries, nutty biscuit malt, sweetness, more dark fruit, cola, lightly roasted malt was more apparent on the finish, which was, surprisingly, fairly clean. Mouthfeel was a bit on the light side. No evidence of 9.5% ABV.. Decent enough, but a weaker effort than their RIS."
"O - I'm glad to see Leinenkugel's reach outside of their comfort zone. So far I've been pleasantly surprised with both this and the RIS. I'm anxious to test out the brews to come in the Big Eddy series - IIPA and a Baltic Porter from what I've heard."
