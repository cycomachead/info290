"Not your typical Wee Heavy but sort of a hybrid stout/wee heavy.  Lots of roasty notes and smoke.  Not as much caramel or vanilla.  Still very solid beer and enjoyable."
""
"Good scotch ale for the price. Nice flavors including a good deal of smokiness. Dark horse brewing Scotty karate is definitely the best of this style though."

"Overall, this looks and smells like a winner, but the subdued flavors and thin mouthfeel definitely degraded my overall thought on this. Still good, but it's no Dirty Bastard."
""
"This is a very acceptable scotch ale. Dark mahogany color with a sweetly malty and roasted taste. There's a hint of an alcohol aftertaste but not unpleasant. This is a smooth scotch ale. Not great but good indeed."
"This was not my favorite type of beer."
""
"Overall:  Wow, this is a great scotch ale!  Nice and malty and slightly sweet.  Delicious!  I’m definitely getting this again!"
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good, “wee heavy,” but not quite what would be needed to vault this to the level of Silver City’s Fat, my personal favorite of the style. Still, it’s a quality beer, much as I expect from Great Divide. Thanks, Bro!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a simplistic scotch ale that lacks the beef to assert itself like a scotch ale should.  It’s not light on flavor, but the flavor is unrefined and the body is sorely lacking."
""
""
"Great company, great style super average beer. A good entry level for a scotch ale but falls short overall."
""
""
""
""
"O: Vague sweetness that's hard to pin down when one actually tries to locate it (though a sweet aftertaste that's easily found)."
""

"A good wee heavy. A little overly sweet, but it's got a warm feel to it. I enjoyed the heavy taste of a traditional Wee Heavy, but it does flow good. It's a solid introduction in the style and worth picking up a bottle or two."

"Feel- Rolls around the tongue like a liquid marble.  Carbonation pairs with hops at finish for a bite."
""
""
""
""
"o: A tasty Scotch ale with flavor and punch.  Only drawback is the weak carbonation."
"Pours a very dark brown with a small brown foam head that dissipates rather quickly. Tiny bit of lacing around the edges. Aroma leads with sweet, roasted malts and alcohol. A good amount of nuttiness. A bit of caramel. Taste is wonderfully sweet caramel malts, and a touch of bitterness. Roasted nuts, coffee, and cocoa. Alcohol is very well masked, although it does come through a bit more as it warms. This one is medium bodied, a bit thick, but still very smooth. Goes down with relative ease. As a relative newcomer to Wee Heavies, this is my favorite that I've had so far."

"O. This is a very good substitute for you know what."
""

"Rich flavours. Peat, cocoa, toasty malt, slightly solventy booze and sweet bready malt."

"BOD 6/30/14.  Dark amber pour (looks like a porter) with normal head, lacing and retention.  Weak nose of mostly caramel coupled with hints of roast, dark fruit and coffee/toffee.  Almost full bodied with a nice almost creamy texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is quite nice and well balanced, but lacks the intensity and complexity of the world class Wee Heavies such as Traquair and Thirsty Dog's Wulver.  It begins as the nose, mostly caramel with hints of dark fruit, roast and coffee/toffee.  As the sweetness fades in the middle, hops and associated mild bitterness are noted.  The finish leaves you with a touch of smoke and a very light alcohol burn."
"This beer is a slightly heavier version of a traditional Scotch ale, and it's got some punch.  Very malty, but not smoky at all, and not bitter either.  Good take on the usual Scotches."

"Overall: Solid and hearty. If you like caramel, try it!"
""
""
""
""

""

"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Has a caramel and peat aftertaste. Very nicely made, and well worth trying again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer poured a dark brown with a tan head. The smell is mostly malt with maybe a little dark fruit. The taste is all malt in a wonderful way. Caramel and coffee are present, maybe some dried fruit. Prunes or raisins, perhaps. The mouthfeel is not as thick as you'd expect, with some nice warming from the alcohol. This is a great version of one of my favorite styles."

"O - Got a wild hair on an hot summer day and wanted something new that I knew from reading I'd prefer for the cold months. Evidently, I like Wee Heavy. What can I say? I've never encountered a beer that I thought was ""too malt-forward"". Needs a nose. Why can't I smell this ale?!? Flavour really needs a bit more complexity. Just seems like something with so much crystals should also have a bit more specials. A little more peat (was it?) and a dram of smoke would've been nice. All in all, I'll be looking for more Scotch ales when Autumn is waning and cold extremities need quickness after a morning of waterfowling."

"Notes: Poured into a US-style pint glass. BOD (bottled on date) - 09 April 2014. Served chilled."
""
""
""
"Overall, yep: very solid stuff, and unusual to boot. I like it when a beer manages to be both interesting and tasty—and I think it's fair to say I trust a brewery like Great Divide to pull it off."
"Overall: I think this is an underrated beer. I've had Oskar Blues's Old Chub Scotch Ale--a very popular wee heavy--numerous times, and I found this to be a superior beer. The taste is similar, but a little richer, and not quite as sweet. This beer is darker and has a sort of weightiness about it as well."

"Overall, this is a good example of the scotch ale style. Nothing makes it stand out, good or bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really well balanced beer. I wish the nose offered a bit more - but the melding of flavors makes up for it. There is no bitterness and no off tastes to ruin the palate. This is so smooth that it is almost sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is about full but not heavy, rich enough but not chewy, per se. It balances crispness with smoothness and is semi-dry for the duration."
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer. The balance is what I'll remember most. No flavor stood above the others and all worked together very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice, enjoyable malt bomb. As much as I love American IPAs, I really do like to have a good malty treat every now and then and this beer is certainly a GOOD malty treat. Great as an after-dinner drink too!"
""
"dark red pour, mild head. smell of malts and alcohol...very typical for the style. taste is on point but a tad boring. caramel, sweet, very malty...medium bodied, mild carbonation. just true to style but not that exciting. worth a try..."
"Overall - Certainly not the most complex Scotch out there, but if you're looking for a caramel bomb, this one'll do you no wrong."
""

"I give it a three and a half with the caveat being that I need to revisit and figure out if this is the true representation or an anomaly."
""
""
""
"Picked up as part of a mixed six as I am a fan of the wee heavy. Excellent color that is dark and rich, but not a lot of head. Good scotch smell but not real strong. Taste is very good, very clean and easy to drink for a wee heavy, which isn't all good. Also a little thin. Overall a very tasty scotch ale but not the top of wee heavy. Not sure the cost but it would have to be priced well to get again."
""
"O - 3.5 - The thing that really brings this down is the lack of complexity in the taste."

"Didn't know what I was getting in this i picked up in a mix a six. Its a nice mellow and sweet beer. Was more viscous than I thought it would be but turns out to be pretty good. The alcohol is hidden well and its tasty. Couldn't see having more than two of these in a sitting though, but nice to cap off a long cold weekend on a Sunday night."
""
""
""
"Overall - Another solid brew from Great Divide and a nice full bodied Scottish Ale."
""
"O: at first wasn't warming to it; as it warmed I found it to be a nice example of the style, without any particularly unusual stylings. Malt-forward and lip-smacking good."
""
""
""
"O - A nice, dark brew for a cold day. Not my favorite Great Divide beer, but it definitely stands out as unique. Give it a try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Mild, balanced and drinkable betrays the style and ABV. I like it! Usually find Scotch ales to be too strong with peat malt. Very smooth. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts."
""
""
""
"Lightly warming feel with an alcohol note behind layers of nut brittle, burnt sugars, herbal bitterness, phenols, mocha, caramel, earthiness, leather, and dried fruit. Malt-heavy and whispering with booze. Hops are overcast by the prominent grain flavors, however, they're not thickened with sweetness or bolstered by much meatiness. Disappointing is the lack of a good, sturdy carbonation. Body is flaccid and wet without it. Questionable intensity steers me away from calling this a Wee Heavy, but it makes for a tasty strong Scottish Ale."
""
""
""
"This is my fifth Great Divide beer reviewed. Had this poured out of the bottle into a tulip glass. One of the better offerings of its kind that I've had, if not the best. Strong boozy flavor with a dark fruit aftertaste, and a bit of malty smokiness as one would hope. Not of ton, and a relatively thin mouthfeel, but I didn't mind here. Pick it up on a cold night or when you just want to get pretty loaded."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I enjoyed it. I got 6 pack and feel good about that, but probably wont get more. Its solid, and worth a try for wee heavy fans."
""
""
"Overall- Above average. Worth a try but if you've had a fair amount of Great Divide's beers, it might be the letdown it was for me. A little odd for the style."

"A tasty example of what Scotland has traditionally had to offer the beer world - big malts, peat, smoke, and alcohol. This offering displays all of these in spades, except, gratifyingly, the latter - the north of 15-proof booze nowhere near the radar scope. Maybe not a repeat choice for an evening's goings on, but nice as a steeling force against the increasingly inevitable winter."

"O - Not a bad beer, I actually like the roasted smokiness of this but you know the rest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've come to the realization I enjoy this style. A lot. And this satiates my enjoyment of said style quite well. Really good dessert beer, this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great value for a darker beer that is sold in six packs. Nice, full, dark flavors in a semi-drinkable weight for a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a deep brown color with a touch of red and a small off white head. Smell is roasty, with biscuit like maltiness. There is a touch of caramel. Taste is caramel and roasted barley right up front. Fades to a very sweet finish with a noticeable alcohol note in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, moderately low carbonation. This beer is quite heavy. Overall this is a nice, heavy, malt forward beer. Definitely a good representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"A rich, malty beer with just the right touch of hop bitterness and alcohol presence. Easy enough drinking for a big beer, even with the fairly high ABV. Yes, it's noticeable, yet the malt and hops do an excellent job of keeping things balanced and enjoyable."

"Pours just like a bourbon and cola with a one finger head that quickly dissapates to a wispy swirl and a rim of lacing,the smell is ripe dark plums,sweet caramel,candied figs and sweet malts,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation which suits and has tastes of ripe dark fruits,a touch of smokey peat,a hit of boozy heat,a nice reserved touch of hops and finished with a bittersweet malty finish and overall yeah it's nice and warming for a cold night like tonight but I def prefer Old Chub cheers."

"Overall this was typical of a Wee Heavy, with a lot of malt, caramel and roasted notes. This was earthy, sweet and full of malty caramel flavors – not something I’d go for if I wanted to relax or session, but it’s still a pretty good beer and accomplishment for this style of beer."

"one i'd purchase again, would make for pleasant late night sipping near a cozy fireplace"
""
""

"Overall: A very solid Scotch ale. Good toasty malt taste with some nice undertones of spice and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well balanced malty brew."
""
""
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Cellared for about a year. Had a wee little amount of head and left a wee little bit of lacing. Aroma is sweet and has notes of cocoa and some boozy esters. Taste is similar with some additional notes of coffee and tofee. Mouthfeel is smooth with just a slight oil slickness. A nice Scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle dated 2/17/09. Poured into a snifter. Minimal head and retention, deep mahogany body. Aroma includes coca cola, chocolate, coffee, port and brandy. Taste includes all of the above with a touch of leather and bacon. Very tasty and quite enjoyable. Aged very gracefully."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is very nice Scotch Ale, offering a rounded, nuanced, potent series of flavors, and the smoky peats are excellently integrated into the breads and darker fruits. Worth trying."
"Overall: Really like scotch ales and this is no exception. The only thing that would make this better is if it had smoked peat."
""
"O – Nice for the style, the malt profile is spot on, and not overdone. The added hop character in this particular brew brings about a very nice balance not found in some others."
""
"Overall this is pretty good. Definitely not my favorite of this style, which i generally love, but still worth a single bottle purchase for a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on tap at the taproom. Appearance is a mahogany with nice clarity an a rim of white head. Nose is malty with hints of peat smokiness and caramel malts. Taste is very mild, light caramel malt, a slight smokiness. Mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation. A nice clean scotch ale without too much character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Appearance lacked slightly but still pretty solid beer. Wouldn't mind having it again on occasion"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is the kind of Scotch ale you give a porter fan to make the bridge between the two styles. The roasted malts in this beer, for me, distract from their mission to transport caramel/butterscotch/toffee flavors, and the chocolate notes are simply out-of-place. That being said, it's a pretty interesting take on the style, and really pretty tasty. Forget what it's supposed to be and enjoy it for what it is: a robust porter dressing up as a Scotch ale."
""
""
""
"Overall a good sipper. Slightly more booziness than I prefer."
""
""
""
"O: Nice Scotch Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor, too, had light sweetness. Had a solid malt base, caramel leading the way, with some subtle peatyness present. Hopping was floral and restrained. Improved with warming; decent, overall. Prosit!!"
"1557"
""
""
""
""
"O: A little bit more hoppy than the Scotch ales I've come across to date, but it works. Still well within the style, and a satisfying drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lowish C"
"On tap at Great Divide. Pours a fairly-deep brown. Nice and malty. Slight caramel and toffee. Nice sweetness."
""
"Claymore Scotch ale pours, from the bottle, a deep mahogany color--think antique furniture--with a small tenacious ring of foam around the outside; a nice look brew, really. But it's the aroma where this thing gets interesting. Peat, roasted nuts, a slight hint of smoke, caramel and an unmistakeable sense of wood. The intricate layers of flavor continue onto the palate. Deeply roasted, but not black, caramel malt leads the away, along with the earthy tones of peat and mahogany. Sweetness develops and becomes more prominent as it warms. The beer is solid to the end where it signs off with a slight earthy bitterness. Just enough to balance it out, but not enough to betray the style. Nice brew."
""
""
"This was the first non-Yeti brew I've had from Great Divide, and I was pretty impressed. Not my favorite Scotch Ale, but it's still damn good and I'd be happy to revisit this one anytime. A nice hop character along with subtle smokey hints and lots of malt flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Real malty and nice sweetness. While ABV is relatively high (7.7%) did not really feel it was too hot. This was another of the offerings in the sampler 12 pack I got. All the beers are in the 6-8% alcohol range. 2 for 2 made > 4 ratings in my opinion(Rumble + Claymore Scotch Ale). And I never had Great Divide before I was given this 12 pack for Christmas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, a pleasant venture into another untried brew for me. two scotch ales in a row; i do like the style. partial to the dopplebocks and looking for others and i really like this style. just not as much as the sweet malty dopples.... but i imagine i could do a few of these in a row and they would be awesome with a shot of some good bourbon or really good whiskey. in fact, a good evening would be these two in moderate amounts..."
""
""
""
""
"Claymore pours out a red-tinged brown color with a small head. The aroma is muted, what I can detect is some maltiness. The taste brings through a robust, slightly prickly maltiness, with a bit of smokiness on the finish. It's pretty relaxed for a scotch ale, but it's tasty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. This beer hides the ABV very well. Overall, it's a tasty scotch ale. I like the style with more aggression personally, but this is still a well-composed beer."
""
""
""
""
"I prefer a strong, overbearing presentation of the style such as Bannatyne Scotch ale from Cambridge Brewing."
"It’s malty and smooth, without being overly sweet. Sometimes scotch ales can be a little over-the-top, but this is an extremely drinkable, yet big beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours up a beautiful deep mahogany with a small caramel colored head, a small ring of retention, and no lacing to speak of. The smell was minimal, but I mainly picked up some alcohol and soy sauce. The taste was very salty upfront followed by notes of cola, coffee, toffee, caramel, and a minimal amount of alcohol. Mouthfeel was full but I didn't like the weak aftertaste. Though weak, it was not very pleasant. Overall okay, but not one I would seek out again."
"O: My first beer for the style reminds me of some of the better stouts I have had, not sure where this one ranks for the style but I enjoyed it."
""
"Bottle from Gainesville House of Beer. Pours very dark reddish brown with little head. Smells like chlorine and slight scotch to me, but my nose may be wrecked from gaving an Oak Aged Yeti right before. Nice sweet toffee and a bit of scotch, some light peat. Good mouthfeel, slick but not too heavy--perhaps even on the light side for the style. Solid scotch ale that is pretty mellow in flavor and mouthfeel and could be enjoyed in larger quantities than others in the style. Otherwise, somewhat unexciting."
"O: Besides a weak nose, this provides a nice malty sweety flavor and mouthful per style that is surely worth a taste."
""
""
"O - I didn't like it. It looked great sitting there in my glass, but the flavor seemed confused."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This was a great true to style wee heavy."
"I have to admit, even though this was quite to style, I was hoping for a bit sweeter scotch ale. The color is EXACTLY what I am looking for in a scotch, and the smell is spectacular. I am slightly let down with the taste. For the background of smoked plums and raisins, it begs to be a little sweeter."
"Great smoked character in smell and taste which might not be expected in a wee heavy but was certainly appreciated. The carbonation might have been just a little high for my taste which is the only reason this beer did not receive a 5 for all categories. Will definitely be having this beer again in the future. Thanks again to the guys at Great Divide!"
""

""

""
""
"O: Very good beer! Not my favourite scotch ale, but then again I live in Colorado and this has to compete with the likes of Oskar Blues' Old Chub and Grand Lake Brewery's Plaid Bastard. Does not disappoint given the high standards placed upon it. And the buzz is very soothing."

"O: I am quite impressed with this scotch ale. It is extremely complex without being overly boozie."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a damn good Scotch ale. Its pretty easy drinking for the style and doesn't lose out on feel or taste. I quite enjoyed this one."
""
"Poured dark ruby red with a half inch of tan foam. Caramel and roasted malt dominates the nose. Taste is toasted toffee malt, dark fruits, subtle chocolate, light caramel sweetness. Medium body, mildly carbonated, slightly warming. Overall I found this to be a tasty scotch ale."
""
""
"O-No coffee or chocolate notes, could have used more smoke/peat as well. Another minus was the lack of bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite from these brewers (Disappointing after tasting what immediately became my favorite beer about a year ago, Titan IPA), but not a bad beer. It's well balanced but in general isn't super exciting in my opinion. Unfortunately I did not have any of the food they suggested I pair it with, but I still enjoyed it alongside my cajun fudge brownie."
""
"A must have. Reminds me of an Russian Imperial Stout. Very well built by a respected company."
"o - Overall a very nice scotch ale. Nose was what I was expecting while the taste had some nice sweet dark fruit to it. Very easy to drink; not sure how much 2 years did to this but I liked it. Would have it again."

"O: This had a brewed on label of May 3, 2012. So, it's about three months old. That could have affected carbonation. But, overall I enjoyed it. It's not the first Scotch Ale I'd reach for, but I'd have zero qualms drinking this daily. Would love to try this on tap. I think it would shine."
""
""
""
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, dark red brown. Very little head, no lacing. Malty aroma. Malt, some roasted malt with a faint caramel. Malty middle and finish with little hops and a hint of smoked peat. A somewhat drier finish than I expected. Nicely done, but I lean towards Hibernation for a malt bomb."
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't impressed. The head was nothing much to speak of, there could have been more dark fruit and caramel malt flavor, and the feel could have been a bit more smooth and a bit more warm going down."
"This is a bit different than I would expect from the style. It's darker and has more roasted malt character than I would expect. Missing is the peat and butterscotch notes as well as the dark amber body. Not a bad beer, but it doesn't fit the style."
""
""
"Overall, a bit sweet and lacking in complexity for a wee heavy. It's got a good malt profile, but the dark fruit flavors and peaty, smoke flavors are too subtle."
""
"	This poured a thick dark roast caramel color with thin lacing. I thought it looked ok.	It had a tart, sour aroma. Strongly off-putting. It’s not what I expected, I thought at first, as it lacked any sort of malty sweetness or an expected toasted caramel which I look forward to in my scotch ales. Flavor was more of the same—bad, off, and just wrong. As it warmed it developed what I can only describe as a “vomitty” flavor. Its hard to tell if its just old beer or a quality control issue. Unfortunately, drainpour."
""
""
""
"Notes: Even though it's a Wee Heavy it's rather drinkable and very tasty. Cheers."
""
""
"O - I was disappointed with the other 3 brews in my Great Divide Brewers pack, but this one made up for it, I feel I have found a diamond in the rough. A fine Scotch ale and one I will return to."

"Typically the only scotch ales that I really enjoy are peated but this is a definite exception. Pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a nice scotch ale, not a personal favorite style of mine, but the aroma is great. Very drinkable for a scotch ale."
""
"Nicely drinkable, but not quite as good as I'd hoped. I'll revisit another bottle in the future and see how it goes."

"Really enjoyed this one. Starting to really get into this style."
"O- Not fantastic, but definitely good qualities to this beer. Warm, caramel malts are tasty. It might be my glassware, but the appearance was very disappointing."
""
""
"O - while this beer may be entering stout catagory it is bold yet balanced with a brilliant nose and good flavors."
"It's malty and hoppy and very roasty. It is a very robust but not nearly as bitter taste (as others of the style). It is unique and very drinkable. This goes high on my wee-heavy list and is one I want to repeat."
""
"O - Decent, was hoping for a little more, it was a little underwhelming for me in comparison to other Wee Heavy's I;ve enjoyed. Not bad, though, very drinkable for sure."
""
"Not a bad beer for my first-ever scotch. Overall it was decent. I may come back to this after a few others to compare."
""

"D - I like this beer, though I think it may disappoint fans of the wee heavy style. Another solid beer from Great Divide, though it's really not remarkable or special."

"Very dark ruby red, practically black in appearance. Short tan head with really nice lacing. Oatmeal, rye bread, watery scotch, dark chocolate and hints of coffee beans and caramel malt. Smooth, rich milk chocolate and roasted oats on the initial sip. Flattened oak and roasted coffee beans with a nutty, rich mouthfeel. Dry, lightly scotched aftertaste."

"Pours a deep opaque reddish brown with a nice tan head, but it goes away pretty soon. Bit of caramelly malt on the nose and not a whole lot else, definitely looking for more here. Must say that the beer is totally tasty and drinkable, but wanted a whole lot more complexity out of something like this. No alcohol burn, no roast, no toast, no smoke, just a big malty beer, a bit of hoppiness for balance but only noticible as keeping the malt from becoming cloying. It doesn't taste bad, it just isn't as flavorful as it might be. Good through the mouth, can kick it back easier than you might want to. All in all, a slightly above average beer. Nothing is bad or wrong about it so much as it just fails to stand out, especially for a style with some room to play with."

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Overall, another tasty beer from GD. Nothing too crazy for a wee heavy but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Overall: I am a big fan of scotch ales and wee heavys but this wasn't my favorite by any means. I might have had high expectations but this wasn't what I expected, just not my favorite brew from Great Divide."

"I think this is a very good beer for the style. Has nice depth of flavor and is easy to drink at the same time. I would have this one again for sure."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with some roasty notes and caramel aromas. Taste is of roasty/toasty malt up front with a mild burnt caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good Scotch ale with a tasty malt presence in both smell and taste."
"Poured a 2"" beige head with an unusual extra hue I'd liken to malted chocolate milk. The body is a dark raw umber brown, almost coffee. It smells very rich and complex in the malt department, as well as reminiscence of breakfast cereal. The taste mirrors the smell and there's kind of a chalky cocoa texture which personally I loved. Average length finish but with chocolate malt satisfaction. Both I and the lady of the house thoroughly enjoyed it."

"Overall, it's cool that they did something new in the Scotch ale style, but I'm just not feeling it. It didn't really bring the richness of flavor that I was expecting even though it wasn't lacking flavor by any means."

"Review from notes. My 1st Great Divide and I'm always up for scotch ale so I took a flyer on this six. Pours dark almost black in color with zero head into dimpled mug. Smells of alcohol, malt and a smokiness with a bit of peat as well as dull sweet bread. Full malt flavor in the front with the aforementioned peat like smokiness and mellows rather quickly without any real mix of sweet bread or dark fruit. I found this overall to be a bit underwhelming for the style, not very complex, rather average though I'm willing to give it a second try in the future."
""
""
"Overall-not a bad scotch ale in the least, very drinkable, complex and not too much of a bite, not the best scotch ale I have ever had, but damn good, I have yet to be let down by Great Divide."
"Poured into a footed stange (or whatever those glasses are called), a dark, muddy, rusty brown, somewhat translucent when held up to the light. A small off-white head that dissipated within a minute or two. Aroma of sweet malts, roasty, dark fruits and caramel; not too pronounced. Taste of rich caramel malts, roasted grains and nuts, brown sugar, hints of earth and figs. Very smooth and highly drinkable, and I don't just say that because it was my third drink of the night. I really loved the mouthfeel on this one. Very nice overall, and I could honestly probably sip on this all night."

"I always start Scotch Ales with a bit of apprehension that they're going to be too hopped. Thankfully, Great Divide has used restraint in the right way here. Smoked peat, toasted malt with just a hint of sweetness, but it's far from cloying. Chocolate, raisins, and some wood in the finish. Hops do add some bitterness but they are kept in check, just like they should be in this style."

"A decent beer, but feels kinda bland, not really a good representation of a scotch ale either."
""
"SOLID, NOT MUST TRY!"
""
"Clearly an American take on the style, but respectful enough of tradition. For a 7.7% darker ale, yeah, this is a very easy drinker..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a great brew, but not what I would typically expect in a wee heavy (i.e. no dark fruits or peat)"
""
"O: The beer is well balanced and goes down smoothly."
"O: Little heavy in flavors/richness for drinking multiples but I will certainly be enjoying the rest of the 6-pack over the next couple of weeks. This would pair very nicely with game meats."
""
""
"O: This was my first wee heavy to ever try. It wont be my last because I'm curious to see what other recipes deliver in this style. I was somewhat bored with this particular brew however it was for sure a good drinkable beer. With the price of $10+ for a six pack I will look else where for a better example."
""
" Not as aggressively flavored as other scotch ales but the flavors are classic yet modern. Another goodie by Great Divide."
""
"No peat and not that malty milk ball-ish. Otherwise a pretty solid scotch ale."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. The sugars and malts were warm and inviting, while the smokiness added a whole other dimension to the aromatic profile. That said, we wish that the flavors came through more strongly, as they do in the nose. Additionally, it would have been nice to have a thicker, less watery brew. In the end the beer represents the style, and is a nice effort comparatively."

"O- Not what I was expecting considering this is only the second Scotch Ale I've liked at all (the other being Oskar Blues Old Chub). I should just learn to never question Great Divide."

"I dig Great Divide. Even when I've sipped on styles I don't like, I recognize that they've done an above average job. I love a malt bomb, but this is the only beer of theirs I don't like."
"At $14/six pack, I feel ripped off."
"This poured out as a much darker color than I expected. the beer is a deep brown color with a tan colored head on top. The lacing is good with a strong retention. The smell of the beer gives off some nice earthy amromas. The taste of the beer has a good caramel base with a light bitterness in the finish with some earthy peat notes in there also. The mouthfeel of the beer was on the thinker side, it was very smooth. Overall this beer was pretty good. I would drink this one again."
"Great Divide Claymore Scotch Ale “Wee Heavy”: I have finished a long cycle of tasting IPA’s, which was great fun. Switching gears, I am now sampling darker fare, porters and stouts. The Great Divide Claymore Scotch Ale is a great find. The body is black, and the tan head fades quickly. No matter, the aroma is wonderful. You cannot miss the roasted malt and wisps of smoke that linger above the glass. The Scotch Ale is very smooth on the palate with an even malt flavor throughout, and the long pleasing aftertaste make for a great sipping experience. Nothing bitter, acidic or unpleasant here. Highly recommended if you are in the mood for an easy going dark ale. Great Divide has a number of off the beaten path offerings that are really good, and the Claymore Scotch Ale is another."

"I really dont have much more to say on this one...At $10/6-pack its a weak offering among alot of fantastic beers in this style."
""

"Overall - While it may look like your average stout/porter, there's an excellent beer waiting underneath that seemingly ordinary appearance. This is my first scotch ale I've ever had and I loved it; I would highly recommend checking this out!"

"I found this beer lacking in many areas. Just sitting in my glass it looks boring and dull. No bubbles ... no life. Some beers lack carbonation in the glass and then liven up after entering the mouth ... not this one. Dead. It also seems watery and lacking any unique flavor punch. The label is cool."

"Morey's Bottom Line: I found this to be rather unique and more flavorful that others within it's style. This one is a year and a half old and tasting really nice."
"Consumed with/for breakfast, a perfect brew for such an occasion. The beer pours a very deep mahogany hue, bordering on coffee-black, and is capped with a smattering of sudsy off-white froth. The flavor and aroma are lightly sweet, and plenty roasty, offering breakfast-y notes including maple, toast, chicory, and even a hint of smokiness to approximate bacon. Refreshing and fuller of body, without a trace of alcohol discernible. I am digging the hell out of this beer. Thanks to Brown for bringing it over before work."
"O: I still prefer the finesse from the Scottish originals. This strikes me more as overkill of a good thing."
"thanks to xraided81 for sending this as an extra! bottled on jul 13 2010. pours out lookin like a cola, real dark with a slight fizzy head that diapppears quickly. smell and taste go hand in hand with this beer. both are heavy on the roasted malt some chocolate and a dark fruit sweetness to it. has a full body mouthfeel with a good balance between bitterness and carbonation to create a very good and mellow beer. this is only my second wee heavy and will definatly seek out more."
"Overall, a nicely done scotch type all that has sold malt and mild fruIt flavors that hide the strength."
"O: Wow! Great wee heavy brew. 1st time with this style and I really enjoyed it. This brewery never dissapoints."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a case study in the virtues of malt, in a world ly dominated by hop monsters this beer reminds us of the importance of the subtleties of malted grain. Delicious, buy it!"
"Overall: very smooth and drinkable."
"Great Divide does it again. I really like this Scotch Ale."
"this is possibly my new favorite scotch ale! big and balanced with all the richness you'd expect. not sweet like some can be, super drinkable. caramel color throws me off a little, because this tastes a lot fuller and richer than it looks. a testament to visual and sensual deception, in a positive light. full bodied with a savory aftertaste of burnt sugars and tobacco possibly. sensational offering from great divide!"
"Its a pretty good beer, much closer to style than some that are in my area for being a famous 'scotch ale'...This is not a dark hearty thick stout, but its not a bitch beer...Drink it, play a round of golf on a Scottish isle, and shut the fuck up."
"Overall: This wee heavy packs a taste as big the size of it's namesake sword. The malts balance well with the peat and grassy hops. It is a good example for anyone looking to try a wee heavy that is worth it."
"O - Although I am not too familiar with the style, this is a tasty brew and would enjoy drinking this any time. For the abv, this is immensely drinkable."
"Dark tan head that fell quickly over a dark brown with ruby highlighted beer. Strong malt with light peat and smoke in the nose. Light and pleasant. Some dark fruit in the nose as well. All of the nose continues cleanly in the taste with the fruit increasing a bit. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the style. Overall, the beer is well done and perfectly adequate. However, it's not a stellar beer that's going to get me to pick up a six pack."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass. Pours dark with a couple finger breadths of foam that sticks to the glass. Smells malty and sweet. Very bold tasting robust malted beer. Very clean mouthfeel. A good change of pace. I have enjoyed all the offerings from GDBC. Would buy again."
"Overall - Nice and tasty and bold. Not as smooth and balanced as other wee's, this one is more booze up front and sweetness later. Good beer, enjoyable for sure."
"O: Pretty drinkable. A tad sweet but overall pretty decent."
"Overall this is a great Scotch Ale and I really enjoy this one. Great balanced drink in taste I must say."
"jd"
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 02-10-11. Pours clear dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 1 finger light tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a lacing ring. Some decent lacing left on the glass. Aromas of dark fruits, molasses, caramel, spices, and a bit of chocolate, coffee, and smoke in the background. Nice complex aromas here with great balance. Taste of big caramel, chocolate, molasses, and roasted flavor in the front; that leads to smokiness, a bit of dark fruits, and a bit of booziness in the back. A small amount of bitterness is noticed in the back on the finish as well. Notes of caramel, molasses, and roasted flavors linger for a short period after the finish. Surprisingly smooth and creamy body that drinks easily for the alcohol level. Medium carbonation and medium-full body. Fairly strong alcohol warming after the finish, with very little noticed in the taste. Overall a great Wee Heavy ale, probably the best one I have had yet."
"O: Very drinkable and very tasty. Great Divide does it again. I enjoyed this wee heavy and would recommend it, even if it's not on the top of my To Have Again Soon list."
"mouthfeel - very smooth, very drinkable, at almost 8 percent its a strong one for a 6 pack, i enjoyed it and could see myself getting some more of these"
"Bought this one in mixed 6pack 1/2 Claymore, 1/2 Colette for $12. Definitely worth a try. Great Divide never fails to put out solid brews!"
"Overall a semi mild scotch ale, with the right flavors, creamy and easy down. Not bad decently priced at 10 bones a sixer"
"A very nice scotch ale."
"One of my top favorite Scotch Ales for interest as well as drinkability."
"This is a pretty good beer, and good for the style!"
"D - Very drinkable. Rich and balanced flavors. Really like the semi-clean finish. The slightly higher than average 7.7% abv is pretty much undetectable. Super smooth beer for how rich the flavors are."
"D - Not a bad brew, is fairly rich in taste."
"O- This being only my second in this style probably fell slightly short to Founders Backwoods Bastard. Good brew though and definitely another solid offering from Great Divide. I don't think they can brew wrong."
"O- Although not my favorite category, I would gladly have another one of these."
"D - a sipper for me but certainly a good one. Gets better when it's warmer."
"Definitely a sipper. And although the ABV is relatively modest (7.7%), this one seems stronger somehow. Solid, and a good choice for the style."
"smells of creamy chocolate- I have to say the look of this beer is fierce. It pours near black with almost no head. It looks like a beast. The taste however is shockingly smooth. The taste is very creamy, smooth and has a rich sweetness. I was very surprised. I have really started to like the beers from great divide."
"O: I like scotch ales, and I like Great Divide. Somehow this one doesn't work out as well as I thought it would. Try Founders or Oskar Blues or Dark Horse for a better scotch ale."
"Feels very full in body, moderately carbonated, a tad creamy, and barely warm in the end. This is about the best Scotch Ale I've had as of yet."
"It reminds me of a less hoppier Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale that isn't dry. Actually that's how I can explain this beer the best. Even though I like Dogfish Head's IBA better because it has more of that earthy hop that tastes real delicious with the scotch ale caramel creaminess this beer still has all those qualities too and its delicious. This is a quiet sleeper of Great Divide. It's a beer that shoudl definitely get some more attention because its great one."
"Overall, this is one of the finer examples of the Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy style that I've come across. If Great Divide could figure out how to keep the alcohol in check then the smell and taste scores for me would go up to 4.5 and the mouthfeel perhaps too, and this would be nearly an A+ beer for the style. There's a lot of potential in this beer. I might have to pick up a six-pack and see if the alcohol is more subdued in the bottle."
"D - I could easily see this as my Friday nighter. Then off to bed!"
"Great example of a wee heavy, bold malts balanced just enough by the hops and smokiness. Recommended."
"O- Well, this wasn't quite what I was expecting. I've enjoyed different smoke beers in the past, and this seems to be the dominant piece of this beer, but it just doesn't quite pull it off. If I'm looking for a scotch ale I'll go elsewhere, as this is just average."
"I know jack about beer brewing. I think I do know something about Scotch ale, however. This one is... well, it's one of the worst I've had. Bad Scotch ales taste like over-boiled peas and beans. This one tastes like that *plus* wet dog fur. Or maybe it's wet cat fur. Or a wet wool coat that hasn't been cleaned in three seasons and could really, really use a good cleaning RIGHT NOW. In any case, this is one Scotch ale to avoid. I had a headache before I even finished the bottle. If you want a good American SA, head to the aisle that holds Founders Dirty Bastard. Better still, head to the aisle with the Orkney Skull Splitter."
"It's a very dark red with just a hint of light at the edges of my perfect pour glass. The aroma is malty with a bit of spice lit cinnamon. The taste is nicely malted, sweet with a touch of spice and caramel. The body seems just a tad thin. The finish is a bit on the dry side. It's a good example of the style and worth a repeat bottle or 6."
" The taste is very good, I like how the malt and yeast are integrated with some dark fruit notes like date and light cocoa with some woody elements as well. The flavor brings a gentle toasted grain which also comes off like roasted beans, but is not really bready, just smooth and chewy. The only drawback to this beer for me is it lacks a little in the complexity factor, a very drinkable beer mind you, and I found it to have a very well hidden 7.7% abv, but there are many better examples out there IMO."
"Drink- Good, as usual from GDBC. Very smooth and easy to sip on."
"M/D: average. Dry, abrasive mouthfeel and smokiness would keep me from having any more than one in a sitting."
"D: This is a damn good beer with such a nice malt profile; one of my favorites of the style"
"D- Altogether a well rounded beer for the style. I think that it would have improved from a little less bitterness in the finish as well as a slightly dryer finish (only slightly). The smoky character may also needed to be turned back just a touch. Certainly would get this one again though."
"Cheers!"
"D-Great brew from great divide, would definitely like to have this one again. First time was at The Porter Bar in Atlanta,GA ON TAP!"
"Great Divide's Claymore Scotch Ale is, to borrow a term from Mary Hirsch, a rubber sword: it makes a point without drawing blood. That point is that American brewers have left no stone unturned and are by now brewing all styles of beer as well (or, in many cases, better) than the brewers of the styles' originating countries themselves."
"Overall I was not looking forward to this after the pour and nose, but it is fantastic. Look forward to another bottle to see if any preconceptions change on those fronts..."
"She's a dandy."
"Drinkability: Usually Wee Heavies are so sweet I can't drink many in a sitting. But this is quite balance and mellow. the sweetness is there but not dominate. I think I could have another just fine."
"drinkability - decent beverage for the style, maybe wouldn't have more than one in a sitting, this is a sipper for sure"
"Drinkability: Excellent ballance of toasty malt flavors and sweet malt makes it go down super smooth and linger delightfully on the tongue."
"Verdict - I enjoyed the dark fruits and buttery taste, but it isn't uncommon to find that in a lot of beers. While the taste was complex, it didn't respectfully agree with my taste buds."
"Drinkability is where this thing shines. It begins to taste better with every sip simply because my ability to discern overall flavor profile tends to diminish after even just a beer. And since the flavors of chocolate chip cookies and brandy are pretty delicious, I can see myself wanting another at the end of the night. This after all has a unique flavor, one that I may enjoy at other times. Its just that I always scrutinize my first beer of the night and challenge it to make me enjoy it. Beer always tastes different depending on the situation and I think this beer is just not a sipper that is meant to be distilled of its flavors. Its meant to be in a pint glass and gulped with friends."
"Overall I really like this beer a lot. The appearance is inviting, although a bit too dark for being so low on the alcohol side of a ""wee heavy"". It is a 120 schilling looking 80 schilling beer. regardless, it is definitely great tasting."
"D: the brew was pretty drinkable but was just an average wee heavy."
"D - particularly drinkable despite the heaviness and ABV."
"O - Despite blunted edges, this Claymore is definitely forged from a complex composite that creates an intimidating impression, and is definitely worth wielding again."
"d- Undecided. I was somewhat full when I drank this beer, but although it tasted delicious, I can't tell how many I would be able to drink. It is thick and sweet and bitter, I dont know how long I would be able to drink it."
"Not as sweet as expected, certainly more on the bready side."
"Somewhat dissapointing, I always have high expectations from Great Divide, so I won't hold it against them. Still a beer I'm sure someone can really enjoy. It's not bad, I just wasn't crazy about it."
"Claymore is a good ale, don't get me wrong. I wouldn't turn this down. But, like many micros Great Divide dumbs down a classic style."
"D- Very nice balanced beer. A little on the thick side and boozy aftertaste. Nice for a sipper."
"Served in a Tulip Glass. Claymore pours a near black color with slight brown hues when held up to the light. As it is poured into the glass it generates a nice amount of creamy light brown head that dissipates rather quickly. The brew leaves a scattered amount of lacing around the glass which I have found to be typical of the style. Claymore Scotch Ale has an overall scent of deep malts (possibly coffee malts) and dark roasted nutty scents. The taste of this brew is not exactly what Ive come to expect of the style but, that being said, it is not in anyway unpleasant. The initial taste is that of deep malts with a slight molasses note backed by roasted nut hues. As the brew finishes, more of the woody flavors and a very slight scotch note work their way onto the pallet. There is very little alcohol burn which really helps it drink easily. The brew is very smooth on the pallet and has a nice complexity of flavors. Overall, I would have liked to have seen more scotch notes in the scent and even more of the same in the taste but I did find the brew to be quite pleasant."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a very small off-white head that disappears almost instantaneously. Scent is definitely malty with some caramel aromas and dark fruits. I also pick up a bit of toffee and roasted scents. Taste is initially roasted malt followed by toffee and caramel. Then I definitely get the biscuit flavor with a bit of roasted/bitter chocolate and dark fruits. A bit of alcohol at the end. I haven't had too many wee-heavy's but one that sticks out in my mind would be Founders Dirty Bastard...and that was SOOO much better...Other than that and Belhaven, I can't think of much to compare it to. Mouthfeel is sorta rich and somewhat creamy. Drinkability is fair, as it is a tasty beer, but maybe just not my favorite particular style as of right now."
"Medium bodied but on the lighter end with slight bitter hop presence up font along with subtle roasted malt. Hints of caramel and toffee as well as some alcohol sweetness and biscuit. Slight astringency with alcohol heat. Dry finish."
"D- i wouldn't mind pickin a 6 of this some day or some singles. i've had wayyy better scotch's in my day (dark horse's scotty karate)."
"Don't know if it came from the brewery this way, or if the lines at the Ale House were dirty. Either way, I need to have it again somewhere else to really know."
"D: A timid, middle-road scotch ale that is more along the lines of a Scottish export than a wee-heavy. Certain qualities of this beer are briefly off-putting, but in the end it satisfies, especially in the company of savory food."
"A very good scotch ale, borders on being too sweet but it holds the line. Nice showcase of woodsy flavors. I am disappointed that they don't distribute this beer to NY"
"Verdict: Not worth tracking down and a somewhat pedestrian effort."
"It is a scotch ale worthy of a try, but I've had better."
"D: If you're looking for a cold weather beer that isn't a stout or porter this is a great option. Very impressive. I haven't had the opportunity to experience any Wee Heavy beers and am enjoying this one. Will definitely seek out more in this style."
"A decent Scotch Ale, but doesn't quite compare to Dirty Bastard, #1 on BA for Scotch Ale at the moment, and my go-to Scotch Ale. (Although I would love to try their Sappy Slappy Bastard, which sounds even better!)"
"Overall: Very solid Wee Heavy. Another solid offering from Great Divide. I would recommend trying it."
"Just a delicious beer!"
"Has a rich, thick aroma that is strongly yeasty and a little fruity and malty. It pours a barely translucent light chocolate brown with a pale tan head. Flavor is malty, yeasty and fruity - like thick, unpasteurized apple juice - with just a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Smooth, rather thick texture had a nice fizz."
"I am glad I tried this beer, but for the price I will probably not purchase this again."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of Jun 17 2010. Pours a deep dark brown with very little head. Some lacing. Beer smells somewhat earthy with roasted malts. Tastes alot like it smells. Earthy, boozey and roasted malts. Not too much going on here. It's an alright beer but nothing really stands out one way or the other. I'm a big fan of Great Divide and I can think of a bunch of their beers I'd grab before I picked up this one again."
"Overall, this was a good beer, especially for its price. I'd buy this again, if given the option."
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours brown with a small, short-lived, tanned head. Aroma is of toasted, bready malt, some dark fruit and sherry. Full body, medium carbonation, sweet but not cloying. Taste is toasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate and some molasses. Long finish of fruit and chocolate. Tasty brew."
"D: Overall, very drinkable. I would drink this again."
"Some would say adequate, I will say mediocre. It's rougher than I'd like. Forget the claymore to fix things here, a steamroller would be more appropriate."
"Very enjoyable beer, would drink again. Probably wouldn't pay what I paid for this again, however (17.00$ sixer in montgomery cty maryland, expensive due mainly to locale and beer store)"
"Drinkability - This one went really fast, especially for a dark, heavy beer. 4.5/5"
"Finger's worth of rich brown color, full range of bubble sizes with poor retention, lacing fares just slightly better, The liquid is a very deep brown but does avoid blackness, fully opaque, you get some amber red to orange tint around the rims. The nose is not especially heavy but it sure is sweet, loaded with molasses, butterscotch, maple syrup, caramel, cola bean and milk chocolate, as well as plum, black cherry fruit, brings a hoppy greenness and peppery kick too, scone and oatmeal accents, firms up appreciably before evaporating in your nostrils. Full-bodied, more broad than deep, skips nimbly across the tongue, the carbonation has a fine tightness to it. Still packed with molasses, maple syrup, chocolate and toffee but not as dulcet as in the nose, the cherry, blackberry, apricot fruit ripe with a fresh feel. Oats, multi-grain bread flavors dry it out a touch, minimal greenness or real bitter bite, however, the hop presence is clear. Grill smoke, perhaps even meaty at times. Good contrast of elements, drinkability is very good for the beer category."
"D: Nice enough beer, not paying $12 for a sixer that's for sure, nowhere close to Traquair."
"Hides the ABV well, but there is nothing remarkable about this beer."
"Drinkability is really very good, with a complex, yet pleasing taste and an exceptional mouthfeel. Definitely the best wee heavy I've tried thus far and yet another excellent brew from the guys at Great Divide."
"D: Easy to drink, however has a decently high ABV, sweetness can be a bit much at times, yet overall definitely recommended for people into scotch ales"
"Overall a solid, if forgettable, Scotch Ale."
"Poured into a nonic a deep mahogany brown with a tinge of amber,a toasted almond colored 1/2 finger head atop.Aromas have a slight smokiness along with some earth,juicy dark fruits come alive more as the beer warms.A big shot of dark fruit and caramel malt hits the palate from the onset,a sweet alcohol warming note comes in as the beer warms as well.A pretty solid Scottish ale with the peat-like smokiness and hefty fruitiness,pretty good."
"D: This is a great Scotch Ale, despite a higher ABV it is easy to drink. Not overly sweet. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: A rather odd beer, but tastes quite good - the flavors here produce a rather dry wee heavy, if that makes any sense at all"
"Pours an opague dark brown with tinges of red around the edges. The head is a rocky light brown which subsides with time. Aroma is caramel and malt with no hint of hops. A very slight fruitiness is also present. Carbonation is fairly low and appropirate for such a big beer. Taste is fairly dry, with lots of caramel and a hint of dark fruit. For a fairly big beer, the alcohol is very well hidden. A very worthy beer, but not the most impressive wee heavy that I've tasted."
"Bigger bodied, with a smooth thick feel. A nice warmer-upper."
"This is a really tasty beer, but it borders on porter more than scotch ale. Lots of dark malts, especially chocolate, such a dark demeanor to the beer. I think I should get a bottle and age it to see how it goes."
"D- Sweet malts are VERY inviting and makes this easy to keep drinking"
"Pours a very dark, almost burnt brown color that produces a small yet creamy off white head. Almost looks like a stout at this point. The aroma is very malty and has that sweet caramel and toffee like quality. Very rich and enticing. The flavor profile is very nice and has a good Scottish style maltiness to it. There is a distinct spicy texture and flavor to it. Very viscous and perfectly carbonated for my liking this time of year. Overall this is a home run and really a great buy."
"Pours a super dark brown with ruby red highlights. Almost black in color. Small tan head that fades fast. Smell is primarily of molasses, and fresh soil. Taste is rich toffee up front, with a bit of rye bread in the middle, and a buttery, leafy finish. Quite sweet. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, low carbonation. Very good drinkability. Very little detectable alcohol, this is a smooth sipper that I would certainly get again."
"D: Definate drinkability. Not heavy alchohol taste."
"I'm a sucker for a sweet beer and this one has it in spades. I do normally like my scotch ales a bit more peaty but this is good, too. An absolutely fantastic mouthfeel. It has a creaminess just short of a glass of milk and very enjoyable for this type of beer"
"D - I would almost never say high for a 7+% brew, but this one is pretty damn drinkable. Malty but not overly sweet or tiring on the palate. Another fine offering from Great Divide."
"D: Really enjoyed this beer and if it was offered to me I wouldn't turn it down. However, I don't see myself searching for this one again. Nothing too amazing."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easy, slightly filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice sipper beer to drink for a long time."
"D: Delicious beer, seems to be smokier than the few ""wee heavies"" I have had before and also more of a milky character. Not too filling for such a rich tasting beer"
"D: w00t, but not spectacular (note the taking for grantedness)"
"A top for the style."
"Drinkability: this is a middlin' Scotch ale. Far from my favorite, it's still a drinkable malty treat when you're in the mood for such."
"D - Nice scotch ale. Great Divide does another great job with yet another style."
"D - I don't know if I got a lighter batch in one, heavier in another or if this beer gets boozier with age but I defiantly like it fresh since it has more of a coffee tone that covers the ABV. Will try it and find it again with hopefully less than 2 months age."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer with all the flavors blended beautifully. You might spend a little more for the 6-pack than you would any other 6-pack of craft brews, but it's a 6-pack you can't back away from."
"Id love to include this in a tasting among others of the style. I do enjoy this brew. I do feel the finish lacks a bit of linger, but it wouldnt keep me from exploring it more."
"I got this as a part of a mixed sixpack and was disappointed with many of the beers that came in it. The Scotch Ale, however, was somewhat of an exception. It was pretty much everything you would expect or want from a scotch ale. Good malty/spicy aroma, great flavor, nice light head to contrast the dark caramel colored beer. A must try for Scotch Ale lovers."
"Very flavorful brew, stands up with the best strong dark ales. Slightly sweet, nice and malty and definitely has some subtle scotch and chocolate. Overall very full bodied and smooth, with no noticeable alcohol. Just a great overall drink, lots of subtle flavors that pairs great with some great food."
"Taste is similar of dark chocolate and roasted coffee, but finishes with a more complex semi dry hint of toasted nuts. The mouthfeel is full with a greater level of carbonation than I had originally anticipated and could be dialed back in my opinion. Fairly drinkable given its alcohol content and an all around good beer. Comes short of the exceptional characteristics found in some of Great Divide's other brews."
"I definitely expected the roasted malt properties of this beer to better balance out the malt sweetness, but it was not the case."
"This was just good beer, nothing crazy or over the top in either a poor or great way, but overall I'm glad I sampled it."
"Overall - Those looking for a ""true"" wee-heavy might be a bit thrown off by the porter-like characteristics that are present in this beer, but those simply looking for a good beer will not be disappointed. Give this one a try!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep almost opaque black with a quickly diminishing head. Aroma is dark malts with a slight bit of roast. The taste is a nice dark malts, caramel, dark chocolate and espresso. The beer is medium bodied with mild carbonation. This is an enjoyable beer, even on a hot summer afternoon."
"D- Solidly average. I'm sure there are better examples of a Wee Heavy. This ismy first foray into the style, I can see the attraction, but this particular beer didn't quite take for me."
"Claymore Scotch Ale calls itself a Wee Heavy, and that's probably a good description. It could benefit from a tad heavier malt profile, though it's in no way a bad beer. Overall it's a very enjoyable beer, one of the better examples of the style that I've found."
"D - An enjoyable beer but it could be better. It tasted like it was so close to being great but just fell a little bit short."
"A bit heavy on the malt side to be extremely drinkable for me."
"The medium body had a good thick stickiness to it, and the finish was dry. Given the 7.7% ABV, this one is incredibly drinkable."
"Man, do I really really REALLY miss McEwens now. Searching for a new Scotch Ale to fall in love with I've been trying them all. Old Chub from Dale's has been my go to so far. So this time I thought I'd try Claymore since it finally showed up here. Poured a nice caramel tawny golden brown, some head but not much. Tasted sweet and roasty, some bite but more of a malty mouthful. But after 10 min -- no head and flat. What a huge disappointment."
"Drinkability: Very solid Scotch Ale all around, even if not too complex and a trifle thin. Recommended."
"One of the finest looking and tasting American versions of a Scotch Ale I've had the pleasure of tasting. Had a pour from the GD tap room and was very impressed. A deep dark chocolate brown with dense mocha head. Lots of roasted malt character on the nose with a hint of roasted coffee notes. Flavor profile focuses primarily on the malt here with dense malt flavors and a hint of cocoa in the background. Finishes clean with a hint of hop presence. Wish the feel was a bitter rounder and denser, but this one really great and stands up to the best of 'em."
"A gently softer, smoother, more rounded quality is possibly the only thing preventing the feel from being spot on. It's not big and lip-smacking and it's not slick and thin. It has some pull to it - tight, compact, touch of viscosity. Very nice. I'll be back."
"This is a very good Wee Heavy. Something I really enjoyed, and would recommend."
"D- fantastic overall and a pleasure to drink, a best buy in my book. I love scotch/scottish ales and this one is really good"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a really malty scent that boasts of crystal, peated, and roasted malts. It's sweet with a light smokey aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a rich, malty flavor that borders on sweet, but finishes with a slightly dry, peated edge. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking beer. It has excellent malt character and a smooth finish."
"This was a new style for me, though I am very much looking forward to trying more representations of it in the future."
"This is one tasty, heavily roasted ale. Maybe a tad acidic, but very smooth, quite drinkable, and a nice, toasty flavor."
"Dark cola-colored brew, very small tan head. Nose is mostly dominated by dark malts, a bit of roast. Nice big chocolate malt front, some roast, a bit of smoke. Light hop backbone. Medium bodie, wet mouth. Alcohol is somewhat noticeable but not very much. Not a bad brew at all."
"Pours a clean dark copper color with minimal head, yet small rings of lacing. Scent is of dark carmel, roasted grains and nuts, a touch of flower and some lingering metallic overtones. Taste is a little more aggressive then scent dictates with a big carmel presence backed by tastes of fresh roasted grain and nuts, a touch of chocolate and dark dried fruit and a floral like taste in the finnish. Medium bodied, smooth, prefectly lowly carbonated. One of the most drinkable beers in its style."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 2/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, dark citrus, slight alcohol, hops, slight chocolate, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of a Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight chocolate, hops, and a hint of dark citrus. Overall, good body, blend, aroma, and mouth feel."
"Overall a nice example of the Scottish ale it has nice balance and good flavors. However it is just about average it is not amazing. The high carbonation also is unappealing to me. Worth trying though."
"Drinkability - would definitely have another, although the alcohol could sneak up and grab you by the shorties if you're not careful."
"Good beer, and one I will certainly look for again as the weather turns this fall."
"DB- Good drinkable Wee Heavy. The malt is the most impressive thing here. Not too sweet and the ABV is well hidden, good job."
"Excellent beer. Great Divide is fast becoming a preferred brewer in my fridge."
"Decent, but definitely not my style of beer. I guess it is good compared to it's description of style with the exception of the body. It ends fairly thin, almost watery."
"Had this at the Great Divide promo at Blind Tiger in NYC. Poured a cloudy reddish-brown into a pint glass, with two fingers of beige head, and excellent lacing. Smelled very bready, toasty, and yeasty, with only a tiny hint of molasses. The flavor didn't reveal much else either, with an overwhelming bready/biscuity essence, and a dry finish. This beer could certainly benefit from a little more flavor balance. From the smell and appearance, I expected the body to be thicker, but I was surprised to find it medium, smooth, and mildly carbonated. I wouldn't attempt to session this unless the flavor balance is tweaked a little, but the body feel does help this beer's drinkability."
"Easy enough to drink, but very filling."
"Very drinkable scotch ale. i could see enjoying this beer alongside a nice steak and potatos dish for sure."
"D-very full bodied but still very drinkable. The aftertaste throws me a bit since I can't really pinpoint what it is, but overall is a pretty good beer for the style"
"D: Good brew - not sure I""d have more than a few though as it would catch up to me quick."
"D: The higher abv is undetectable, and this beer drinks very smoothly for the style."
"Overall a good scotch ale."
"Overall I really like this beer, for some reason I have had a negative association with Scotch Ales, [im pretty sure its the word ""Scotch"" that just turned me off - because of the drink by the same name - and not that I dislike scotch - but because of the thought of having hot alcohol flavor in my beer - totally stupid - i know]so I have always steered away from them - glad I didn't totally give up on them!"
"This is the 2nd or 3rd wee heavy Scotch Ale I've tried and really liked it. Right up there with Orkney's Skullsplitter!"
"A black mahogany color with a decent oatmeal colored head and fair lacing. The aroma brings alcohol malt and bayberry hop. Not bad but not impressing me much yet. The flavor is a tangy maple syrup and juniper malt. Alcohol is pretty intrusive here and not entirely to my liking as it seems like the astringent qualities are knocking out the malt sweetness. It's grassy and medicinal to me, chemical hilights. Medium bodied and very lazily carbonated, it has a somewhat silky but limp feel. Soapy sweet, just not my cup of tea and a disappointment from Great Divide, especially for a normally exotic style like this. Vaguely drinkable."
"Pours a dark brown (bordering on black) color with a thin beige head that doesn't retain particularly well but that seems typical for a scotch ale. The aroma has a lot of smokiness initially, along with salty bacon, burnt bread, toffee and molasses, some dark fruits (fig and date), and some alcohol. The flavor similarly has an intense smoky character upfront with notes of bacon and peat, along with some blackstrap molasses, burnt bread, plum and fig, treacle, tobacco and alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side, and drinkability is pretty good for the style. Very solid scotch ale, a little on the smoky side but I'm sure that floats some people's boat."
"A medium to full bodied heavy hitter. Yum."
"THis brew is perhaps a bit heavy and rich to session, but I could easily knock back several. solid!"
"Carbonation is a bit prickly so I wait to finish the glass. Body is only medium, and I'd actually like more alcohol feel/flavor here to balance all the sweet malt, but there is little to quibble with here. For a sipping style, this is remarkably drinkable."
"D-one more please!"
"Very creamy mouthfeel, smooth."
"D- I think this is an easy Wee Heavy. Its much more approachable and palatable than many others of this style. That doesnt mean its among the best..."
"Overall, another great one from Great Divide, probably not my favorite, but still a beer worth seeking out and I would do so again."
"D: Drinkable, though I don't know how much after the first one. Rich and malty a bit of abv...but it tastes so good."
"Beer poured a dark brown with a small tan head that dissapated quickly. Nose has hints of smoked peat and carmalized malts. Taste is big on carmalized smoked malts, slightly sweet but not cloying, finish is slightly dry with light hop action. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderately carbonated and fairly smooth. Overall the abv is well hidden and it drinks easy. I wanted to try this brew when it came out in '09 but could not find until i visited my old beer guy JonPol's store. Glad i had the opportunity and i would try again!"
"Less sweet than most Scotch Ales. In fact, I'd describe this as a unhopped porter. Neutral body and carbonation. Easy-to-drink, but overall uninteresting."
"Mouthfeel is lighter than expected for the style, but pretty easy to drink. I like this beer, but I wish they would have called it something else. By giving it the Scotch Ale label they are setting up expectations they can't meet. Heck, I'd rate this beer higher if they called it something nondescript like a Dark Ale. However, expectations are a big part of the taste experience."
"Very dark in color-almost porter looking. Might be a tad dark for the style but stll a good lookin' brew. Extremely malty aroma-hints of caramel and a very mild roasted quality to it. Whisper of smoke. Very malty flavor upfront. Has a great caramel/toffee like quality. Slight hop bite. Body is right there with the flavor and the style. Dangerously drinkable-a great wee heavy. Certainly not balls to the wall on the alcohol scale like some. Well balanced and very, very enjoyable."
"Overall this is a pretty decent beer."
"Quaffable, for sure, but these are sippin beers. Will have another next week!"
"Great Divide has never failed me in any of their beers I've tried, and I'm happy to say that they didn't disappoint me this time, either. This stands proudly alongside such delicious brews as Hercules Double IPA and Yeti Imperial Stout."
"Feel/Drink: Nice thick mouthfeel. Really nice. Drinkablity is right on, I enjoyed 4 out of the 6 already."
"D - very tasty, easy to drink, wish I had a few more"
"The malt is smooth and heavy with a sugary flavor that soon gives way to the smoky malt flavor. The sweet flavor in the beer is really well balanced with smokiness and a slightly bitter hop edge in the after taste. In the end the overall taste is good, but I doubt it's the best. But since I'm new to this style mostly I have to say I want more. And that this is good. Mouth feel is heavy rich and smooth."
"An excellent interpretation of the style and it doesn't taste like a fireplace, as do many poorly interpreted American versions. Also the appropriate lower level of carbonation really gives it a soft, inviting mouthfeel. Nothing drives me nuts more than American breweries that brew a non-American style and then fail to nail the carbonation level. Cheers to Great Divide for emulating a classic style perfectly."
"Pours black, topped with a good two fingers of airy brown foam. Aromas of dark malt, molasses and burnt sugar, with a just a hint of peat smoke and cream. On the palate, the peat smoke is immediately noticeable from the first sip, dominating all else up front. As the beer warms a bit, I get some coffee, roasted malt and dark chocolate. A very nicely balanced beer, and a fine example of the style."
"Drinkability is fine for the style; alcohol content is, understandably, hindering in that area. A nice interpretation of the style, though a bit more nose would bump its allure a bit. A gorgeous dark beauty that's meant to be savored but which begs to be quaffed. Quite nice."
"D: a great example of one of my favorite styles. I normally don't like much butter or banana in my wee heavies, but this brew keeps it in the background. being one of the handful of good scotch ales in America, I highly recommend grabbing one."
"D: Very drinkable, the flavors were excellent and blended really well together for a very very good beer."
"Appears a deep cola brown in the body with a light khaki tan head forming thick, carbonation seems a bit lively, but it does last a good while dwindling down nice and slow. Scattered speckled lacing left behind on the sides of my chalice. Aromatics come with sweet caramel and plum and raisin notes, earthy and herbal hops with a touch of peated smoked malt. Even a bit of dark powdered cocoa edges come off with some toasted nuttiness, maybe it's the yeast and malt playing together. Flavors build upon each other nicely, deep with malt character plums, dark fruits with caramel and a bit of booze. Mild smoked malt and with dark chocolate, herbal earthy hops in the finish just enough to balance it out. Booze is there but doesn't overburden the experience. Mouthfeel is easy going medium bodied sturdy but not overdone in carbonation, not off flavors left behind. Drinkability is decent a good beer to go with some rustic wild game, a nice bison steak and this beer could befriend one another. Drink on it's on but I'd only be good for a max of 2-3 12 ounce portions."
"Claymore is a good but by no means great Scotch ale. The roasted malt flavor is spot on and the heat is nice, but the feel is only so-so, and the weak aroma doesn't help anything. Really only good if you're in the mood for the style and can't find a superior instantiation of it in the store or on the menu."
"Drinkable. An excellent accompaniment to watching curling on the TV."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel."
"I'm surprised by how unique and quaffable this is. My only experience with Scotch ales has been that they are syrupy and cloying. This is not the case, though it's still on the heftier end of beers. I questioned this being a year-round beer and the porter being discontinued, but I think this substitute is bold enough and unique enough to make it worthy. Really impressed with this beer by Great Divide."
"Claymore is an interesting beer, I like it very much. The porter like character was unexpected but very appreciated. I will definitely be buying this beer on a regular basis. Great Divide seldom dissapoints!"
"Let this ale warm so as to maximize the flavour."
"Could use a touch more carbonation, malts roasted just a tad too much. I put this somewhere between Old Chub (pretty good) and Dirty Bastard (excellent). I do prefer Claymore to the St. Bridgets it replaces."
"Dark brown, almost black, not much head. Rich malty smell and a smoky malty taste. Easily fits the style and the alcohol is well hidden for being darn near 8%. good stuff but I really don't need more than one in a sitting. I'm not sure why this is going year-round but it must sell well."
"For 7.7%, this beer is more than drinkable enough."
"d- this has a nice drinkability to it, my first scotch/wee heavy. i think this beer is a nice place to start out, i've got a backwoods bastard in the fridge that i think is going to kick things up a notch!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep mahogany color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with a nice touch of toffee. Taste is very well balanced by caramel and toffee malt with just the right amount of sweetness. Body has a creamy texture with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done though I prefer my scotch ale with more peat malt."
"Claymore Scotch Ale may not be one of the sexier Great Divide brews, but it's as solid as a block of granite. If you have any interest in the style, this would be a great place to start. And if the strongly rumored changes to the Iowa alcohol laws come to pass, I might even be able to buy it around here."
"D: Wee heavy Scotch Ales make cold winter nights more bearable. This is a great one. I can always do with more malt, but very satisfied and will have this again, usually look for 10+ abv. Recommend!"
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is malty caramel and dark fruit. Nice scotch ale. Brewed Mar 3, 2009. $1.83 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT"
"One of the best Scotch Ales I've had; excellently malty and complex with a multitude of flavors to be enjoyed. I'm looking forward to trying more offerings from this brewery."
"Drinkability is high because of the clean finish and sweet flavor. This beer is certainly quaffable but I would prefer to enjoy it after dinner by the window on a stormy night with some soft music playing. Great beer!"
"drinkability is great. good balance. great depth and complexity. this is one tasty scotch ale!"
"A: Looks more like a stout than a scotch ale, the color of prune skin with a tightly packed head, signs of spotty lace along the edges of the glass - 4.25, S: Solid wallop of sweet malts and dark fruits, some toasty caramel, I am unable to perceive any hops - 3.75, T: Caramelized brown sugars, dates and figs, roasted malts and a slight hop bite, ends a little dry, less sweet on the palate than it was on the nose - 4.00, M: Heavy body and a little on the side of being syrupy - 4.00, D: A solid outing by Great Divide in the style, very drinkable and one I would be happy to drink again - 4.00"
"Pours a relatively clear garnet, really dark ruby red, almost approaching brown, thick tan head forms, settles to a medium ring around the glass, good retention, some lace chunks stick to the glass. Smell is nice, very malty and caramelized, bready, biscuity malt, lots of dark fruit, raisins, dates and figs, light chocolate and roast, nutty, very nice and malty, lightly smokey. Taste is nice, caramelized and smokey, raisins, figs, brown sugar, chocolate, biscuit, quite fruity, some roast, a touch of alcohol, real nice finish on it, sweet but not overly so, really nice smokey character. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and drinkable but could had a bigger mouthfeel."
"Leaves a nice malty aftertaste that is not too sweet. Nicely done - an enjoyable Wee Heavy!"
"D - While this beer is fairly thick and sweet, it is balanced and the finish is dry enough to keep it drinkable. A decent example of the style, though there isn't that much going on and the roast character may be a bit stronger than expected."
"Thanks to AltBock for pulling one from his sixpack and giving it to me at the Canadian Breakfast Stout event at Capone's."
"6 oz sampling. Poured dark brown with a thin beige head. Aromas were slightly fruity, some butterscotch, but had a strange rancid aroma that was difficult to describe. Tastes were malty with butterscotch notes and hints of brown sugar - very sweet. Finishes sweet with no bitterness and a mild taste of caramel with some off-flavors resembling the aroma mentioned earlier. Mouth-feel was thin-to-medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall, I was not a fan of this one. As far as resembling the style, I feel they did a pretty good job, but the flavors just weren't right for me."
"I am honestly impressed with this one. Granted, it's not a fresh bottle and I would like to try one, but I think this tastes better than a fresh bottle would. I like that the bitterness has dropped off and the smokey malts shine through. A good offering from a great brewery."
"Pours near black in color with a finger of head. Smell is bread right out of the toaster with some caramel drizzled on top. Taste is slightly ashy, which is unfortunate. A bit sweet with lots of bread and caramel malt qualities. Medium bodied. This one isn't too bad, but the ashiness detracts from the drinkability."
"This has too much black patent malt tilting it towards a smokey tipple. A bit high on the carbination as well. Doubtfull I'll buy again, too many others that deliver the malty silkiness I associate and appreciate in this style."
"A strong pour releases a two and a half finger rocky tan head that has nice retention. Body is the deepest of browns showing ruby tones on the edges when held to light. Nose is slightly smokey at first then comes through with sweet malts and dark fruit notes including ripe wine grapes. First sip shows a hint of smoke quickly yielding to a very sweet palate full of silky fruit. This fruit feel is a mix of sweet grape juice, raisins, plum and some backround spice. Overall this is quite sweet with a smokey balance but it is almost to sweet. It is a bit scattered on the mouthfeel. Drinkability is solid."
"D: Solid choice in the US-made 'Scotch/Wee Heavy' category. Plenty of flavor, long-lasting...some happy accidents develop along the way to make things interesting. One I'd be happy to have again; thanks for the bottle, John."
"The brew is tasty but not what I was expecting or hoping for. It is almost a bit like a winter warmer - which is what I wasnt looking for. Decent brew. More of a sipper then an all nighter."
"A very underrated style and one of my favorite styles of beer. Pours a beautiful dark red color, huge off white foamy head to it. Get a bit of caramel in the nose and a hint of booziness. Taste is just magically smooth.. great body and mouthfeel to this beer. Nice roastiness flavor to it, a bit hot on alcohol on the swallow (which I don't really mind) although some people may find it a negative thing. Incredibly well balanced and fairly drinkable for a higher ABV beer... I've liked everything I've tried from this brewery especially this one.. give it a try."
"Poured from a bottle I received in trade from dwennis into a standard pint glass. It has a very dark ruby color with a thick, creamy off-white head. There is a bit of lacing, but it is in clumps, not uniform around the glass. I can smell sweet malts and alcohol that is reminiscent of a mild bourbon. There is some hop in the taste, but ot is not bitter. There is also some mellow caramel sweetness that is quite tasty. You can also taste some alcohol at the end, which provides some warmth. Very nice, like a good port or bourbon. This is a rich, creamy beer. It has a full-bodied mouthfeel and provides some warmth as it goes down. I'm drinking it a bit above cellar temperature, and it is near perfect. I don't think I could drink it all night because it is so strong and rich, but I could certainly drink a few of these beers. My overall opinion is that it is an excellent beer and worth seeking out."
"Poured a deep mahogany, opaque, with a short ring of off-white bubbles. Some lacing at first, but dissipates halfway down the glass. Rich caramel and smoke aroma. Some chocolate and toffee, but always with a nice lingering smoke. Smooth, slick mouthfeel with a long finish. Hearty malt profile. More smoke, kind of peaty, but matched with the caramel malt. Bit of a hop bitterness towards the back. Again, toffee and cocoa flavors come out as the beer warms. A very good example of the style."
"D- I had no problems drinking this one."
"The body is moderate and really lacking for style. Some sugary notes leaves an almost dry finish. Overall a bit disappointing. Would like to see more depth and maltiness out of this one. But very easy to drink."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. This really quite a nice Scotch Ale. Pours very dark brown with some reddish/brown highlights. Little head. Smells complex- nutty, slightly smokey, and treacly, but still fairly dry. Tastes a little like kombuchi- toasted brown rice, treacle, nutty, and with an interesting Scotch whisky note that floats in and out. Very interesting. Smooth and round in the mouth, this is overall a tiny bit challenging to drink easily with its smoky overtones, but still delicious."
"Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy upfront, but finishes tingly. Tasty and drinkable, good drinkability."
"Overall I thought this was a decent Scotch Ale. It wasn't real impressive, but I might try it again."
"D= great. A very nice scotch ale. Ill be looking for it again. Super easy to drink and enjoy."
"D- Claymore Scotch Ale is a pretty tasty brew that is definitely worth a shot. Another solid beer from Great Divide. Recommended."
"This beer is certainly not bad by any means, but still a bit disappointing.. The super dark appearance was fairly impressive, but the flavor and aroma have little more to offer than roasty malt (and not even in a really good way, as you can find with some doppelbocks, etc).. Mouthfeel is full-bodied but not chewy.. I suggest drinking it cold, as I had one that was approaching room temp and it became quite unpleasant. Not too much complexity in the flavor, but, again, its not bad. I dont know if I'd go out of my way to buy it again, but it certainly is decent and if you're nuts about scotch ales its worth trying."
"poured from bottle to stout glass. deep dark brown in color. very light tan head about one finger which didnt last very long. very little lacing. sweet roasted malty scent & little hop character. mouth feel was pleasant & a little sweet with some bitterness in the end. I enjoyed this beer & could drink a few more."
"D: This was more first endevour into the wee heavy catagory, so perhaps I need to get used to it. It was a good beer, but I expected more malty sweetness rather than the bitterness I was left with."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop, with lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slight hop, spice/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, another nice brew from GD."
"This beer has a really nice richness to it; malty and thick without being overly sweet. The rich concentrated fruit really adds to this beer and the touch of hops adds just enough balance to the over all profile."
"Bottle Ours a deep brown with a tan head. The head is creamy and lasting. The head is producing nice lacing. Aroma is of caramel, malts, and nuts. Has a light carbonation. The flavor is on the lines of a light stout. Has good blending. Hints of a slight metalic taste. Has a medium body. A solid finish with a good aftertaste. This is a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability: Pretty high actually - this would be a great fall beer. The smokey/toasty presence reminds me a bit of a campfire. While the body isn't what I would have preferred, still a solid beer overall and I'd gladly drink some more."
"D- This was a good one to go to for a try at something new, but it did not quite hit the mark for me. I guess scotch ales taste the same to me and leave me wanting more variety. Perhaps some short term aging in the cellar can mute that alcohol sting that was present and meld the flavors better."
"Overall, not bad, but certainly some room for a little more body"
"4.0 D: Good brew all around. Not so drinkable if you don't like a strong breadiness."
"Once you get past the smoke, this guy drinks OK. This is not my favorite of the style and probably one I will not revisit in the near future."
"Nicely drinkable, but not quite as good as I'd hoped. I'll revisit another bottle in the future and see how it goes. I do believe that it will age well for up to three to five years."
"Taste is very malty but not too sweet. Nice toasted malt flavors, a touch of caramel, and some smokieness in the background. A bit of a grassy hop is noticeable in the finish. Medium-full mouthfeel with a nice smooth carbonation level. The 7.7% ABV is not noticeable at all."
"Poured into an imperial pint. Two to three fingers of nice tan head, stayed for about 5 mins. Nice dark brown opaque color. Sweet smell, somewhat caramel-esque. Brilliant lacing. Taste was very sweet and malty, slight alcohol and coffee aftertaste. Pretty thick mouthfeel but very soothing. Reminds me somewhat of a glass of sweet wine. Enjoyed this one quite a bit. Nice contrast to the usual hoppy beers I frequent."
"Medium bodied and dangerously drinkable for the alcohol. Exceptional beer."
"Very smooth drinker. Body is on the heavier side of medium. Very creamy. Really good stuff, which is the norm from Great Divide."
"The flavor is very balanced, with lots of malt characters: milk chocolate with a hint of bitterness, dark fruits, note of caramel. The finish is also balanced, dry, and doesn't linger much. The body is medium, with good smoothness. Not quite up to creamy, but not bad at all. Very drinkable."
"D: Not bad. Nice shot at the style."
"The Scotch ale/wee heavy style is one that's easily overdone, tipping either towards too much malt or too much alcohol. And even just within the maltiness, it can lean too much towards caramel or too much towards roastiness - but there's none of that here. It's very focused. And that's what the style is really about. It's a big beer, and it's rich, but it's also very focused which keeps it drinkable. Great Divide is kind of known for that in all of their beers, but it's particularly welcome here. Very nicely done, and I'd have to say, quite possibly the most authentic American-brewed version of the style (although a little more yeast character wouldn't hurt). Superb!"
"Feel and Drinkability: Medium-heavy body with just enough carbonation to give it life. I've had other Great Divide beers that were poor, but in this one I can find no fault. Its a nice beer. This is one that I'll not be opposed to drinking again, though I'd like to explore the style further before I come back. Nothing outstanding or mind shattering about his brew, it is as it should be."
"D) A unique, yet true to form Scottish / Wee Heavy."
"D- These are very drinkable. There is a very good toffee or coffee taste that makes you come back and wish for more. It gets better throughout the pint which makes for a good beer."
"Taste/Mouthfeel: A sweet caramel that comes across without being overly sweet. The taste is spiced up with the alcohol content. There is a muted sour aftertaste. I'm usually impartial to that flavor, but it melds very well with the caramel. It has a very well rounded taste overall. No taste crowds out another--it is all complementary."
"Drinkability is good. It went down well, and I was sad when it was done."
"Enjoyable full throttle sessioner. Would work nicely in a marinade. Solid offering from GD"
"Drinks alright, off style too dry for my liking, had much higher hopes for this great brewery. Hopefully the espresso yeti will make up for it"
"Pours a great dark copper color, the darkest Scotch ale I've ever had; good initial head and some nice lacing. Nice deep scent, mostly malty sweet with a hint of peat. Good deep flavor, thick and malty, a nice hit of peat (although not as much as I would've liked), and just enough hops to round it out. Goes down great for a 7.7% beer."
"Great Divide did a really nice job with Claymore. It's a nice Scotch Ale. It's well rounded and doesn't have any material flaws. The smoke and peat flavors really make this beer. They refine and sharpen this beer a lot. Come to think of it, they're just what Bell's Christmas Ale needed. The comparison naturally comes to mind. Sorry, but there it is. This one's better. Definitely worth seeking out."
"This is a really nice Wee Heavy. Just a tad of the sweet malt that lingers and plenty of peaty smokeyness, and very robust. Great balance."
"Drinkability isn't too bad. I'd don't like my Scotch ale's so fruity, but it's well made."
"It is always cool to see Great Divide coming out with new products. Bottle says this beer is a ruby color, though it looks a lot darker to me, almost black as far as I can tell. Not much heading, pretty much a simple white lacing, maybe it was too cold. From the nose I can smell coffee, smoke, some musty earth, and a slight hint of vanilla. Taste is of toffee, shortbread, caramel, vanilla, cream, lingering hints of smoke. Body is nice and creamy, which is just how I like this style. Alcohol is not readily apparent. Although this is a great example of the style, one or two is enough for me. Great Divide came through with this beer. I always imagine this style with hearty holiday meals. I might have to get another bottle for Easter Sunday. Cheers"
"A solid brew - maybe not the best Scotch Ale, but certainly very strong."
"Drinkability: Moderate. It is a nice tasting representation of the Scotch ale, and it goes down well thanks to the carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
"Drinkability: For me... my reference Wee Heavy is Dirty Bastard by Founders. This is not quite as drinkable as that. I like it... but I'd have to do a side by side to pick out the nuances."
"D: This is a decent, easy to drink beer, though I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites. Still, not a bad effort."
"Wee scotch ale."
"Slightly weak in the mouth, just a bit thin. A really nice sipper."
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear dark reddish brown with about a finger of tan head. Malty aroma with some caramel and cocoa. Also some hop aroma comes through as it warms. Nice rich body and mouthfeel. More malt in the flavor. More cocoa and a good amount of smokiness. The smoke lingers in the finish along with some hops. Much more hop bitterness than a true Scottish version. An Americanized version for sure, but very solid."
"Drinkability- A well balanced scotch-ale, just what I'm looking for in a beer to buy (and drink) in bulk."
"Bottles on March 3rd 2009, 7.7% ABV. Pours a surprisingly dark brown color with mahogany highlights around the edges, small light tan head that faded after a minute or two and left some average lacing in the glass. Dark fruits and caramel make up the bulk of the nose, with a little bit of roastiness and cola coming through on the tail end. Flavor is full of caramel and light chocolate, some roasted malts, sweet, but not cloyingly so, light bitterness on the finish, tastes more like a porter to me. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy medium-full, light carbonation. A nice brew, but not really what I look for in a Wee Heavy. I could have done for a little more sweetness and a little less roasted malt. Nice sipper though."
"Drinkability - Keep these coming please."
"7.7% ABV? Could have fooled me. This one is so tasty, and the alcohol is very well hidden. I want more. Another one that would be perfect in front of a campfire."
"D - An excellent example of the style and not over the top. A great beer to enjoy on a cool fall or spring day."
"Big malt flavor tempered by a smokey peatyness. The smokiness and tobaccoey flavor imparts a bitterness that helps offset the sweetness from the malt. Very porter-ish, in that it has a bit of a toffeeness with the sweetness as well. As it warms, the bitterness receeds a bit, and the late sweetness kicks up a notch. Mouthfeel is decent, slick but not creamy, medium-heavy body. Drinkability moves up as it warms, at first, the bitterness overwhelms it, but by the end it is right where it should be. Definitely an interesting beer, worthy of another look."
"D: Not too bad at all. Not the first bottle I would grab, but i wouldn't be upset if I had to drink some!"
"Drinkability: A very competent and enjoyable scotch ale, IMHO. Recommended. I can fully envision myself snatching up a six-pack of the stuff."
"Overall, a very good wee heavy. I find many to be too sweet. I like the balance of the sweet malts, smoke and bitterness in this one."
"D= This one grew on me as I progressed through the glass. Its appearance is way too dark (almost to an off-putting level) but the aroma and flavor make up for that. I would drink this again for sure."
"M - Creamy, lots of carbonation."
"Pours a really dark brown with garnet highlights when held to light, smallish creamy tan head dissipates quickly to a cap. Smells of molasses and burnt sugars, caramel, smoke. Very malty, very nice aroma. Taste is molasses burnt sugars and toffee up front with a touch of alcohol mid way followed by some raisins and a bit of spice in the finish. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, syrupy full body, medium carbonation. Nice Wee heavy, a little dark, a bit sweet, but very nice nonetheless."
"What a rich, creamy brew this was. Pours a blackish color, not deep amber, like a true wee heavy. Full bodied with a smokey taste. However, looked and smelled and tasted more like a smoked porter than a ""wee heavy"".. Wasn't ""peaty"" enough in my mind, to be a wee heavy. Very tasty, somewhat sweet, but elegant!! Roasty malts with a touch of hops and a smoked porter flavor. This is one hell of an interesting beer."
"Drinkability - I love the way this one blends together, and Great Divide just has a way of making their beers ultimately drinkable. Only negative points here are the noticeable alcohol on the tongue and the nose. Overall, this is another great one from Great Divide."
"Overall, a relatively good beer. Not my favorite interpretation of the style."
"D: A bit atypical for the style, yet tasty. Worth a try, but not one that I'd actively seek out again."
"Overall impression: This one is surprisingly drinkable given the ABV, another good offering from Great Divide."
"D: My favorite of the three beers I had at the Tap Room. It's a nice departure from Great Divide's heavier offerings."
"The smell was just not good on this one, but it redeemed itself by tasting good. I won't rush out for more, but it's one of the only Scotch ales around here."
"d- There isn't an ABV on this bottle, but reading other reviews I would say its 7.5-8%abv. You really dont notice until after its going down. It warms you from the inside and with each drink you want more. I can imagine drinking more, but I am afraid that after 2-3 I would be gone."
"Picked up a single from Abe's for $2 at Abe's. This is a bit different for the usual, heavy sweet caramel and smoke wee heavy I get. This is a dry, extremely bready, like dark multigrain loaf crust. There are notes of cocoa and toast with an underlying caramel malt profile. Despite the 7.7%, this beer was fairly drinkable and I'd go back it. Check this beer out if you're looking for something a little different with the style."
"Drinkability? The label on the (bottled on Feb 17 2009) bottle says it's 7.7%abv and I think they've done one heck of a job of hiding it but...I would not turn around and open another bottle. This style seems to be a real hit or miss with me and the Claymore falls somewhere in between. I say, try it and judge for yourself."
"Pours a beautiful clear root beer color with a small quickly dissipating head and not much carbonation. Smells of sweet roasted malts, caramel, and just a tad of dark fruits. First sip is creamy, clean and refreshing with the sweet roasted malts and caramel giving way to a welcomed rather bitter finish. Great malty goodness here with almost no hop presence. Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer as it's not one of my favorite styles, though with Great Divide on the label I should have been expecting it. Definitely worth a shot."
"Formed a 1"" dense tan head over the clear ruby brown brew. Head falls gradually, with ample lasting lace. Aroma is malty, with wisps of peat smoke. Taste starts with sweet roasty grain, goes a touch leathery in the middle, and closes malty as well, with a touch of warmth. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is great. I'm liking this one."
"I'm impressed. really impressed. One of the better scotch ales I've had in a good while, and definitely an interesting interpretation. Nice to see an American brewery take on a style with so much power and make something so ultimately drinkable. Definitely wish I had a few more on me at the moment... a problem I will have to rectify in the morning. Hands down, a must try - no question."
"I always looked to Old Chub for a good Scottish Ale but this beer has just changed my preference."
"D: nice flavorful beer and has a good even flavor. A good take on this style of beer"
"One of the better American brewed Scotch ales. Highly recommended."
"Sweet smell. Candied caramel and apple. Malt slight roasted. Followed through in the taste as well. Sweet, but not overly. Good balance. A nice crisp finish, but not dry. I haven't had many wee's but this one is darn good, even though it's not my style."
"D - Extremely impressive... Looks good, smells good, tastes good, feels good, and an enjoyable experience... Probably the most well balanced, yet complex, Scotch Ales that I've ever had the pleasure of trying... Two thumbs up to Great Divide on what may become a staple in my beer fridge..."
"Notes from and tasted on: 3/4/09"
"This is a nice enough beer, though I can't say I was wowed by it. It's definitely a beer I would have to be in the mood for. Not sure I am today."
"EDIT #2: The 2010 version of this apparently has a different yeast and tastes even stronger. Smoke carries through more."
"D - Extremely drinkable. It drinks like a very well done doppelbock, but hits you like an english style stout. I'm extremely impressed."
