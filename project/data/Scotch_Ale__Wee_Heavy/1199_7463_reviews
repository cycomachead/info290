"Naaaaa.  Reminds me of a red ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Not my preferred style, but certainly drinkable and enjoyable.  I'd opt for one of my favorite quads if given the choice, but wouldn't mind drinking one of these again."
""
""
"A pretty heavy beer with a full flavor and some bfoen sugar sweetness. Got a bit boozy as it warmed up."

"This is probably the best Scottish Ale I've ever tasted. @ over 8 f% abv you cannot go wrong"

"First, I have to say that I love the color of this beer! It is one of the most unique I've seen: a  light chocolate color and the texture of this beer is phenomenal! I absolutely love the Scotch flavor in this rich, dark beer. If you like your dark beers with a liquor taste, then give this one a try, you won't be disappointed."

""

"It's really hard to describe why I like this beer, but I really like it a lot."
"Good beer. Best one I tried today! Strong couldn't drink more then one! Its getting warmer and I seem to be preferring lighter beers of late."

"Lighter than expected some what bitter but nice"

"Overall: I wouldn't say that I'm a big fan of Scotch Ales in general but this one might well have me converted. It's definitely a beer to savour, unless you want to get completely trashed in short order, and savouring it will undoubtedly yield good results. Top brew from Founders - love it."
"This is awsome poured out of a bottle in a sniffer let warm for 15min s: chocolate banana bread slight light roast coffe T: same as smell With slight im mean slight alcohol finish F Creamy goodness O: this to me seems more like a stout well done why isn't this rated higher this will be a go to for me"
"Pours with a large, cream colored head. Dark red in color. Has a lot of particles floating throughout the beer and some even settled on the bottom of the glass. Pedominantly fruity aromas from hops with a slight aroma of roasted malts are present. Initial taste is fruity and hoppy. A pleasant bitterness combined with roasted malts follows and overtakes the initial taste with a caramel flavor coming in last. A wonderful scotch ale."
""
""
"Very good beer. I felt like I could feel the spirits in every gulp."
""
"Yum"
""
""
"Overall: What an awesome malt bomb this is. I get a whole range of aromas from the malts. The taste is a little less satisfying, but still very good. Iv had my fair share of scotch ales, and this is easily the best one to date. Founders is my personal favorite brewery, and this beer is another reason why. Cheers!"

"First experience with this one. Enjoyable"
""
""
""
"Looks and feels like a brown ale. Nothing too crazy in this one. Will enjoy a couple more times i'm sure."
""
""
""
"Very dark, ruby red. Poured into a sam adams glass it produces a small head that doesn't last.Smell and taste are similarly thick and sweet. Taste is complex with bitterness prevailing over a sweet dark sherry. Mouth is heavy, almost syrupy. I won't try this again as it is too thick for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been drinking this for over a decade.  It's my go-to Scotch ale.  It's rich in smell, complicated in flavor and a wee heavy.  My only fault with it is the mouthfeel, which is a bit sticky.  It's sufficiently boozy that this doesn't matter much."
"Poured into a 10oz snifter. Pours a dark mahogany with minimal head and lacing. Smell is lightly hopped, heavy malt, and yeast. Taste is heavy at first from the malt. Finish is relatively smooth and refreshing."
"Deep mahogany pour with thin, clingy white head. Aromas of fruit, yeast, and bread with some wine-like quality. Flavors are many - prune, toast, cooked sugar. So smooth and malty. This is just great."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Good twang of hops, mild grains except in the mouthfeel. Better complexity in the mouthfeel than in the taste. A nice scotch ale, leaning toward the barley wine neighborhood."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark. You can taste the scotch. Good on its own or perfect for boilermakers."
""

"Let me sum it up for you. Fantastic!  very enjoyable beer it is 8.5 so watch out have this by itself or at the end of rounds."
"Overall,  a pretty decent wee heavy and one that I recommend getting. The beer is pretty good for a year round beer and worth getting."
""
""
""
""
"The taste reminds me of eating all the flavors out of a typical bag of jelly beans at once."
""
"Having read a few previous reviews, I think that people might be misrepresenting the taste of this beer. Simply put, the flavor was completely off-putting. Had almost no beer flavor, just a very alcohol-flavored kick."
""
"Usually not a fan of scotch ales but this one hits the spot on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes and feels a helluva lot better than it smells."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice deep brown color. Rich flavor. Tough one to beat."
"Beautiful looking beer with a tremendous alcoholic bite to my taste. That bite seems to cover up some of the flavors for me. Also it is much more than a wee heavy. Maybe a little too heavy for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Style def not my sweet spot but I enjoyed this more than I expected. Kinda sweet and slightly complex taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't make the mistake of drinking this too cold.  I liked it best when it was closest to room temp.  All the flavors really came out.  Almost has the appearance of a top notch scotch, which I love.  Drink more than one, and you'll feel like you've been sipping on scotch as well.  If you don't like this beer, you just can't appreciate it."
""
""
""
""
"High quality beer with an identity crises. Dark but thin. Full of flavor, but no distinction. One and done for me."
""
""
"Exceptional beer, wonderful flavor for a scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
"This beer filled the glass with a beautiful dark brown liquid that display ruby highlights under a tan frothy head. Rich caramelization in the nose and in the taste. A healthy dose of hops ad a different flair to this beer compared to other Wee Heavy beers. Medium body and a finish that is balanced not deeply malty. Overall a delicious beer and a great offering from Founders!"
""
""
"Drinkability – This is an easy drinking beer.  Nothing spectacular, but nice."
""
""
"No head or lacing to be seen. Maybe poured to cold. Color is a beautiful rich copper. Aroma full of sweet caramel, raisiny maybe. Initial taste was sweet full lots of alcohol cause it was too cold. Let it warm a bit and I taste orange and caramel and a cookie like sweetness. Alcohol still there but much less astringent. Taste lingering on palate is earthy sweetness. Raisins and plums come to mind. This is a nice package. Pretty spot on for what I expect from the style, plenty of alcohol bite married to malty sweetness with a syrupy mouthfeel and a medium body. I think I'll have another."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Leaves a nasty aftertaste that I'll never care for.  Founders Centennial has the same problem."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very malty but followed by a sweet chocolatey toffee flavor. Smooth but very pungent."
""
"The beer poured a dark copper amber with a slight dark khaki head.  The nose was sweet and fruity with subtle roast undertones but mostly dark fruits.  The first taste was an intense maltiness with sweetness and a roastiness at the same time that ended with a slight bitter hop profile.  There was a sweet dark fruit and an almost chocolate and coffee aftertaste that lingered on my palate and was a tantalizing reminder of what was to come with each sip.  This was a very rich and deeply layered scotch ale that was like sipping a nice after dinner aperitif.  This creamy brew was a very satisfying and robust drinking experience and a very well done scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a fantastic Scotch-style ale.  Malty, sweet, a little fruity, earthy.  As a 2012 vintage, this beer aged very well."
""
""
""
""
"This was good, certainly not among my favorite offerings from Founders, though. Just too malty and way too sweet for my taste."
"O: Reminds me of the Ommegang Abbey Ale I had before. Nice flavor."
""
""
""
""
"The darkest shade of red with a remarkable feel and texture. The taste was still the best."
""
"Full body and medium carbonation - Great, tasty beer!"
"A very malty beer. My second favorite wee heavy scotch ale after Belhaven. It has a beautiful chocolately aroma. The flavor is more in line with roasted chocolate and peated malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very interesting; complex flavors;"
""
""
""
""
""
"T: This beer takes all the woodsy grain and squeezes all the fraoch herbalist to create a sharply bitter contrast to the sweet, caramel, malted rye. Really pleasing ethyl flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"A few of these could knock you flat. Seems spot on for a wee heavy."
"V - Medium."
"Great smooth taste. Best example of this style I've had."
""
"Pours a deep brown/caramel color with a small head. This is peat, malt and smoke. A beer that would go down a treat with a whiskey chaser. All the typical characteristics of a Scotch ale but ramped up to a bold finish."
""
""
"Not bad, but I wasn't blown away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep amber in color, light lacing. toasted flavor"
""
"Great flavor, great mouth feel."
"not a big fan of scotch aged beer"
""
"I've had this a few times and have had differing levels of enjoyment.  Sometimes the hops feel too strong, other times they seem like a nice accent.  I feel the rating is an average of these tastings.  This beer needs some warmth, regardless."
""
"It's okay, not the best Ale, nor the best Founders beer I've had."
""
""
"Too hoppy for my pallet"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent big-ish beer. Teeters on the edge of cloying but stays on the right side of the line."
""
"It's just kind of meh."
""
"Overall- This is my first review of a Scothc Ale, and noticed this style is very close to a porter. The flavor is good, and although thick in body, this is a great sipping ale. Well suited for Winter since it has a warming quality to it. Very good."
""
""
""
""
"Not the biggest fan of this style, but I would say it is one of the best of this genre. I couldn't tell it was 8.5 % abv."
"The taste matches the aroma. Well bodied and quite big in flavor, yet drinkable. Hops are more prevalent in the taste than the aroma."
""
""
""
"Agrh! The curse of the 'Scotch Ale': too sweet, too cloying, too alcoholic. instant headache."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very pleasing, served from growler, and will seek on draft again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. Just wow. Powerful up front, incredibly complex and appealing flavors and long delicious finish."
""
""
""
"This beer has everything I want in a Scotch ale, but it's just a bit on the dark side and a little too bitter for this style. I know hoppy beers are all the rage with the kids these days, but there's a such thing as overdoing it. I couldn't taste any smoke in it, but I'm not sure I was supposed to either. In spite of my gripes, Dirty Bastard is very drinkable and the high ABV is masked well. Overall I like this one a lot, and I buy it frequently. This is so close to being an amazing beer, but the bitter:sweet ratio is just a little off for this style."
""
""
"Dark red brownish appearance with creamy head poured from bottle.  Malty bready boozy aroma.  Head dissipated quickly and no lacing.  Rich malty and toasty flavors with a slight boozy finish. Slight smoky hint but not too much to overshadow the rich malts."
""
""
""
"Nice brownish red color and clear. Smells faintly of caramel... A bit sweet. Taste is slightly sweet and has a nice finish. Recently had the backwoods bastard which this seems similar too minus the bourbon. Overall very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brilliant ruby color with a one finger yellow head that disappates quickly.  Aroma is plum, dark fruit and molasses.  Taste is plum, molasses, a bit of roast bite and a little alcoholic burn.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side but it works with the flavors to allow them to linger in the finish.  Overall a very well done scotch ale that manages to hit the high points without the harshness of some in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Very drinkable, smooth, delicious and reliable. One of Founders' best ""everyday"" beers. Scotch ales aren't my favorite, but such good ones as this never disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I guess these scotch ales all have that rough alcohol taste in the middle, which I'm not too fond of, but the other flavors seem to remedy that better than most of the style. Overall, really interesting beer. Not one I'd drink regularly, but definitely a great late-night/dessert beer, if there is such a thing.  Wait, what am I saying, of course that's a thing."
"O: a really well made scotch ale. Not as rich or smooth as backwoods, & harsher, but still a quality Wee Heavy."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter, this excellent example of a scotch ale pours a hazy copper with a firm tan head of dissipating foam and fantastic lacing.  Nose of brown sugars, toasted malts, figs, peat, and strong alcohol.  Flavors are sweet up front, tons of malt backbone with brown sugar and caramel.  A lightly fry peat flavor is present with come dark fruits, light herbal hops, and alcohol warmth on the back.  A barley wine drinkers Scotch ale.  Coating yet lightly dry finish....very easy drinking.  Excellent!  A go to for those who like the brew BIG AND ROBUST!"

"It's a nice looking beer.  A deep mahogany with beautiful ruby highlights.  Low head, minimal retention, spotty lace.  The smell is closest to what I typically associate with BSD's, but not quite as potent.  Flavor is long and lasting, evolving over time.  I can sense the alcohol throughout, but it but only really feel it slightly on the back end.  Otherwise it's primarily a dark fruit.  Maybe some nutty character?  No smokiness.  Nice medium-bodied with a hint of carbonation in there, although nothing is visible.  This is a treat."

"Pours a reddish brown with an off white head. Smells of wood with some fruits hidden underneath giving a complex smell that is quite intriguing. The taste was great with heavy malt flavors in the beginning as well as heavy dark fruits. The overall feeling of the beer is very heavy, but with wonderful flavor layers this beer is a definite winner for me."

"Pours like a root beer, same kind of coloring.  Head up and quickly down, little bitter on the back taste, but not unpleasant.  Nice malty feel. Nice Scotch Ale.  I would put oneof these in with some Arrogant in my pick six.."

"O – The maltiness of this beer is very high, evidenced by the low perceived bitterness despite 50 IBUs (per Founders).  Lots of juicy, fruity malt flavors, very tasty."

"Bottled 07/17/2014:  Aroma and taste definitely open up as the ale rises to room temperature.  A dark and mildly vinegary aroma.  Taste has notes of prune and brown sugar or light molasses, plus a very mild spiciness.  Very subtle hops are complemented by a sweetish, roasted malt whose character is a bit elusive at first but which comes more to the fore in the early finish, with a note of walnuts in the end (which I recognized after reading another review).  Finish is moderately drying, but the alcohol is not overly dominating; there are slight nasal alcohol fumes with exhalation.   Overall, this brew is a nice change from my usual fare and from one of my favourite breweries, but I find it a bit too dominated by dark fruit for my taste, and this year's batch doesn't seem as tasty as last year's.  The label depicts what appears to be Freddy Krueger with a nose-ring and tartan cap.  —Reviewed on 30 October 2014"

"Rich, smoky, malty, and boozy.  I really enjoyed this beer and was surprised by its level of drinkability.  It's full bodied but not overly thick or syrupy.  Great consistency and flavor.  Overall, a well-done example of this style."

"Probably the most flavorful beer I've had! Can't say enough about the strong malt complexities in combo with the caramel profile. Also, the Scotsman on the bottle is the ultimate personification of this beer. No question."
""

"O - Very good ale.  Great with or without food.  Typical Founders complexity.  4/5"
""
"O: The most impressive Scotch Ale I have ever had."
""
""
"A great, rock solid beer. Predominantly malty as should be expected. Aromatic, tasty as can be. I tend to be a hop-head but this is a solid go-to when I need a malty break. Compares really well to other American Scotch Ales. It is the signature beer of one of America's greatest craft breweries. Be warned though, the alcohol effect is definitely wee heavy, but does nothing to detract from the overall taste and mouth-feel. And lastly, if you should be lucky enough to land a sample of Backwoods Bastard, bow down and pay homage to the beer gods, for you will be blown away."

"I like scotch ales, hops and founders beers. But all combined I'm not a huge fan of this one. Too many hops perhaps. Still a good beer though  Dec '14 bottling drank in mar '15. I feel like I preferred the '13 I had on draft much more"

"Dunkel mørk brun farve med lyd beige skum. Lukt av røstet malt, karamell, sjokolade og vanilje. Smak av malt, karamell, sjokolade og frukt. Meget vinøse toner med søt bitterhet i avslutningen. Meget godt øl som ble konsumert fra flaske på Melkebaren."

"Final Grade: 4.31, an outstanding A grade. Founders' Dirty Bastard is one of the finest wee heavies I've had the pleasure of drinking in my 8 years on this site, with a beautifully bold malt backbone that works perfectly with the smooth mouthfeel and earthy hop finish. This is not one of my favourite styles, but like all of Founders' offerings (at least - the ones I've tried so far), I'd be more than willing to pick up a sixer at some point in the future, as this is a quality malt bomb that is sure to be a crowd pleaser. A fabulous brew to ring in my 700th BA review."

"This was a really underwhelming beer for me. I have enjoyed most of Founders' offerings so far, but this one just misses the mark for me. Not an undrinkable beer by any means, just something I won't be revisiting anytime soon."

"The first time I drank this it hurt my taste buds and I was leery of trying it again. Over the course of the six pack and a weeks time, it really grew on me. A good beer to keep on hand and a regular in my fridge. Tastes as good ice cold as it does at room temp."

"Out of the bottle it pours a very nice, dark amber color. Although it pours out a nice head, it has no staying power and little to no lacing. Smell-wise it was rich and aromatic with hints of almonds, distinct roasted malt, and even slighter hints of caramel. It felt thick and bold sloshing around, not watery at all - very bold, but it did leave a strong aftertaste I didn't quite like. As far as the taste, I think it was bogged down with the overpowering flavor of burnt malt, rather than a lighter roasted flavor - it just took away something from what was otherwise a pleasant experience. Overall, it was outstanding and I was saddened to only have had two of these."

"Pours out a ruddy brown with a thin ring of head. Smells of toasty malts, cane sugar, dried fruits, and grape juice. Flavor is chewy, malty, toasty. Way too much estery fruitiness for me (more of an American yeast profile than anything British). Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected/hoped. Carbonation is great: scrubs the tongue, but not too active. Overall, I like elements of this beer, but the fruity esters are overbearing."

"O- Scotch ales and in particular Wee Heavys are one of my favorite styles and this is a nice American take on it. I would say the I prefer Dark Horses Scotty Karate over this one slightly though. It think the hops are a bit too much and I really like how much they tone down in Backwoods Bastard (my favorite Founders beer). Still it's hard to beat being able to get sixers of this stuff all year long."

"Pours a dark cherry red from the bottle with a bubbly head that dissipates quickly. Nice aroma of caramel, malt and dark fruit. Tastes of toffee, chocolate malt and a nice balance of cherry and plum. A good bit of booze to boot. Medium mouth with good carbonation. This is one of the better wee heavies that I've had. So much flavor, and everything blends together so, so well."

"Poured a rich, clear, deep, dark brown with deep ruby red highlights and a thin, half finger off-white head that receded to a nice ring of lacing. An excellent looking beer and completely true to the style. Excellent. Scent begins with rich dark fruit, raisins, plum and figs, with an equally rich malty character, alongside aromas of caramel and hints of banana bread. A moderate aroma of alcohol is also present. An excellent aroma profile, rich, sweet, malty, and strong. Flavor begins strong and assertive, with a strong hit of sweet malt, with rich flavors of caramel, dark fruit, especially raisin and prune. This moves into some roasted malt flavors, balanced by the same excellent caramel sweetness and some smokey flavors and faint alcohol. On the finish the caramel sweetness continues, but is joined by a stronger alcohol presence and a stronger roasted malt bitterness and a faint touch of hops, very low, that is quite nice. Aftertaste is roasted malt and some slight nutty flavors. Faint cinnamon-like flavors are present in the background at low levels throughout. An excellent, deep, rich, malty, sweet, true to style scotch ale flavor profile. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick, rich and chewy with a slight hint of alcohol warmth and a low level of carbonation. A good, true to style, rich, warming feel. Very nice for sipping. Overall this is an excellent scotch ale. It has a fantastic aroma, an amazing flavor profile and an excellent mouthfeel that aids the drinking. An excellent beer from Founder's."

"Pours a nice ruby brown color. Has a small beige head. Aroma is a mixture of things - coffee, malt, caramel, bread, and some hops. Taste is pretty much the same flavors along with a hint of fruit, maybe plum or blackberries? This beer has a bitter after taste but is overall not a bad beer."

"Pours a dark golden-brown in color with a good 1-finger off-white head that settles down to the top and sides of the glass. Some sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle. Spotty lacing is seen with each sip. Lots going on with the aroma with a hint of caramel, dark fruits, malt and 'boozy'. The taste has a lot going on as well with dark fruit (plum and maybe fig), caramel and roasted malts with a light hint of licorice. Perfect carbonation. The finish is a bit hoppy and dry. Wasn't bad but different."

"This scotch ale pours a deep brownish mahogany hue with a very slight off white head that leaves a thin film and substantial lacing. The aroma is deep, rich, and sweet. Lots of burnt sugar caramel and toffee notes plus a little vanilla and alcohol. It is definitely a thicker side of medium bodied beer with lots of coating sweetness. The flavor is amazing. Lots of rich malts following the profile set up by the nose. There is a little bitterness on the tail that just makes one want to dive back in for another sip of the awesome caramely malts on the front end. This is a great example of this style and always a favorite from one of my favorite breweries."

"Pours a nice dark amber with a nice thick head. The first sip is magical. Nice sweetness and lots of flavor. I get hints of raisin, plumbs and prunes. You can taste and feel the alcohol at the end. A fantastic beer and one that I could drink a few bottles at a time."
""
""
""
""

"This is a strong dark red. The color is attractive. The smell is a little spicy and sweet. The taste is awesome. Somehow the alcohol content is hidden in a sip, even though a full glass will knock me over. I have never had a red like this before and I beg everyone to try this one. I someday hope to find this one on tap."
""
""
"O - One of the most quintessential stateside Scotch Ales, Founders' Dirty Bastard is full-flavored and nearly full-bodied but isn't 'intense' as most of the style reflect. Instead, the sweet caramelized wort opens up nuanced complexity of sweets and bread, carefully balanced by hops and alcohol dryness for a smooth beer that can quickly sneak up on you!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Well crafted Wee Heavy that really could pass as a barleywine, highlights the complex malt packed into it. The flavor is bold and complex with whiskey, sweetness and fruit features and is easily the best part of this beer. Founder's is always solid this one is no exception."

"Overall: Pretty solid scotch ale on the wee heavy side. Enjoyed a lot over the years."

"Overall - Very enjoyable Scottish Ale with a different slightly richer porter like take on the style. Would like to see this aged in an whisky cask to really make it perfect. A great beer to enjoy on a cold winter evening (which seems to be never ending in 2013-2014). Would buy again."
""
"Nicely balanced Scotch ale, one of my favourites, along with Skull Splitter, BrewDog Dogma and Traquair Jacobite. Similar to doppelbocks like Ayinger Celebrator and Weltenburger Asam-Bock, but with more bitterness when fresh. (I've tried one from the old bottle and bitterness was very low. The beer reminded me of English strong/old ales and classic Scotch ales from Scotland.) Nice winter warmer, especially if you want to take a break from imperial stouts."
"A great beer. strong taste, probably too strong for most. Tasted like a porter to me, the high ABV really gives it a kick, I was buzzing hard before I even knew it.. The smell was almost of chocolate which I like because it didn't taste like chocolate... Some of the best whiskeys also smell like chocolate. Im assuming its because its a ""scotch style ale"". If you like strong beers of good quality try this.. but as their saying goes. Its not for the wee lads.. so be prepared!"

"O/D - Very drinkable. Good scotch ale. Powerful and flavourful, while not exactly blowing you away. A bit too sweet and a little rough around the edges."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep dark ruby colour with relatively thin off white head. Strong fruity malt aroma, hints of raisin and apple. Quite a varied palate, very sweet with strong flavours of molasses, apple and toffee. A very Christmasy beer. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel but still rather syrupy in the finish. Balance is a little too sweet - while the hop presence is there, it comes up only around the finish while the syrupy, fruity malts dominate at the start. Still, a very drinkable yet flavourful beer. Great as an aperatif."

"Pretty good - a big, malty brew. Looks alright, with an aroma and flavour dominated by sweet, fruity malt and yeast. Nice body. It does seem a shade too bitter for the style, but perhaps that's just the US take on things. A solid effort that bludgeons the senses with alcohol. Worth a punt if you stumble across it."

"It's rare that anyone drink any beer from Founders and be left anything but pleased - Dirty Bastard is unlikely to disappoint. It is a rich and deliciously malty ale with layers of flavour that amidst all the requisite nutty, smoky and fruity notes also includes a great deal of hoppiness (which is rare for the style, hops not being native to Scotland). A nice interpretation."

"I would recomend this beer."
""
""
"I poured this beer, it has a ruby color body with no head. The smell has a malty, dark fruit aroma to it. The taste is dark fruit, malty with a little bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and over all a good version of the style, just not one of my favorites styles."
""
""
"This is a ruby crimson-amber in color. It has a mellow, malty aroma. I get a caramelly flavor coming through from the malt bill. It’s sweet, not sharp and not harsh. Not syrupy although it could easily be if there wasn’t just the right balance to this. Nice, without being a big destroyer, but strong enough to sip and enjoy on a cold night."
"O - No date, but at least a year or two old, and way past its prime."
""
"O - very enjoyable, began to feel the 8% alcohold during the last 1/3. Excited Founders will soon be available in Kansas"

"O: Good drinkability. Another Founders masterpiece. It sounds like they can't make a mistake..."
""

"Overall: Another good one from Founders. This is probably a bit under appreciated considering it's available year round, but this is absolutely a beer that's worth a repeat purchase"
""
""
"Overall a good beer but probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. Better when it is warmer."
""
"O - 4.25 - Great wee heavy. I'd love to compare it to Old Chub and see how they stand up next to each other."
""
"Pours a clear mahogany in color with a short tan bubbly head falling quickly with some ephemeral lacing. The nose is big and sweet and opens up as the beer warms. It highlights rich caramel, sticky toffee, some butterscotch and hints of spice (hops and maybe some cinnamon). The taste is very similar featuring heavy sweet malt, caramel, toffee/butterscotch that ends with bit of spice, but also a touch metallic and with a bit of alcohol. This has a nice rich body and medium carbonation. Overall, a very tasty Scotch Ale, rich and sweet."
""
"a great example of this style here, and it drinks dangerously easy for how strong it is. caramel in color, clear copper shine, with an inch of airy head without much to it, fades out rather quickly. the nose is a complex mix of sweet grains, with toffee and butterscotch notes, molasses too, with its earthy spice. the flavor is just as sweet and malt driven as the nose, only the layers of grain sort of come in waves. i get some wheat malt in here, a ton of pale and and caramel malts, maybe some chocolate malt too. finish is sweet, i couldnt drink too much of this, but its a smooth feeling beer with quite a lot of body and it hides its strength well. its a good winter drinker but for the sweeter beer drinker. i also should mention that this burps real well, i was tasting it for a long time after drinking it, and it was pleasant the entire time. another solid offering from founders."
"A very well balanced example of the Scotch style ale. This is the one that got me trying them again."
""
""
"An outstanding beer that went to far with the bitter.  Awesome for the hop head, just outstanding for me, which of course is a good thing."

""

"OVERALL: Great Scotch Ale. The thinner body makes it go down easy and the 8.5% could be dangerous. Excellent winter beer."

"they put alot of thought into replicating a Scottish Ale and will purchase this again. I find it considerably better than Oskar Blues artifically carbonated Scottish ale which we had last eve."

"I've had six of these now, very good fresh not so great with six to eight months of age."
""
""
""
""
""
"At first glance this pours with a nice head that diminishes fast. Deep scarlet with good clarity. No lacing and average level of carbonation, certainly a harder task with a beer of this size and malt complexity. The aroma has smokey notes with a shadow of caramel and plums. Reminds me of some flavors from Marris Otter. On the front end the alcohol warms the mouth with toffee, plum like flavors following. Finished with a light puckering bitterness that holds a noble, East Kent Goldening spiciness. Again, Founders created a winner for this style and would be my benchmark."
""
"Overall: A good try. I would be curious to find out what the recipe was because it seems like there is too much roasted malt present. It's kind of like a cross between a Schwarzbier and a Strong Scotch Ale. At least the SSA is part of the combo! I wouldn't recommend it to a friend over other examples of this style, and I wouldn't buy again. But I can enjoy the six pack I have."

"Definitely something I'll be drinking again. A great beer that's worthy of it's name. It's thick and muddy colored, but tastes almost ""cheeky."""
""
""

"Overall: Great Scotch ale. Probably the best I've had so far. Well balanced, plenty of scotch notes but without the strong alcohol flavor that can be present with this style. Complex and great on a cold day."

"It's a big beer, missing a little complexity (or maybe suffering a little from transportation), but with plenty to offer nonetheless."
""

"Wow! This is one, if not the best American Wee Heavy's I've had to date. Probably the most bitter Scotch ale, but it works. Excellent layering of toffee/caramel with a touch of chocolate and coffee. Fruity and bready with a stellar rounded out bitter finish. What more could you want in a Scotch Ale?"

""
"Overall, it's not a beer I would drink all the time, but if it was paired with the right meal it would be a good sipper for dinner, I will get it again though, it's worth a try, buy it with a six mix."
""
""
""

"Bottom Line: Do yourself a favor and try this, you will probably be satisfied."

"Fantastic dark reddish brown in color. Not a lot of light gets through this one. A half inch layer of foam rests on top. I get some caramel malt and honestly not a whole lot of aroma. The flavor is caramelized malt and it hits hard and quick on the front of the palate. Mouthfeel is bit thick and substantial. You get a nice malt fade at the back of the palate with a warming from the alcohol in your throat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am having fun with this site and although I do not know how to review like most of you that I have read, I know what I like. I really like this beer! The taste is crisp, clean and offers a mouth full of taste that makes drinking this beer pleasurable!"
"This is an exemplary display of how to do a malty-sweet style without being cloying or one-dimensional. Dirty Bastard is complex, well balanced, and more than the sum of its parts. Another ace effort by one of my favorite breweries."
""
"The nose is of spice, smoke and malt. Moderately hopped, this brew lets the malts shine with their complexity of sweetness, smoke and roast flavor. For an 8.5% alcoholic brew, the balance is a brew master's masterpiece. No alcoholic faults are present, medium bodied with a slightly creamy texture coupled with an outstanding flavor profile from start to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes earthy and rich, immediately I note the slick oily feel, smooth. Slight molasses, non-descript dark fruit, rye, and just when i think the flavor apex is going to lend itself to the satisfying profile akin to a quaddrupel, a woody burn and a dry aspect creeps in at the end. Different to me, then again my first try of the style. Not my favorite style for sure I can say, but I can also tell this is well-crafted for what it is, due especially to the superb mouthfeel."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"An OK beer with way too much hops for this style. The hops left a heavy bitterness on the mouth that was not balanced by other elements in the brew. Too many craft brewers are of the ""more is more"" persuasion when it comes to hops and I hope this trend ends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-this beer was great. It had plenty going on."
""
"Overall: This was good, not great. I usually expect scotch ales to be really heavy with a lot of flavor, and the taste and smell of this one were good but not amazing. I recall other scotch ales where I took a sip and immediately said ""wow."" Not the case for this one, although it is a bit more drinkable than others I've had."
"This is a delicious glass of Scotch Ale from one of the nation’s finest breweries and I like it more and more with each passing sip. The alcohol level is higher than the average beer, but it isn’t as noticeable as I expected it to be. The interplay between the hops and malts and the great deal of complexity are this beer’s strong points and they just keep on giving, all the way to the end of the glass. It’s certainly a beer worth seeking out."
""
"It's an excellent beer."
""
"(side note- I poured this into a glass mug for the first tasting. Then I used a basic REIDEL wine glass. Finally I tried it in a tulip. In all three the flavor profile did not change enough to matter. Even straight out of the bottle this beer opened well onto the palate.)"
""
"O: Soothing, delicious. A terrific Scotch Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a good beer. It doesn't knock your socks off, but I would drink it again and I would enjoy it."
""
""
"I could drink this all day. I preferred it on tap over the bottle, but bottle is still great. I enjoyed the warmth and depth of scotch flavors, a little sweet and hit the spot. I wanted to pair it with another one and maybe some charceuterie. It would be great with smoked meats or a steak."

"I like this one a lot. It is not your average scotch ale. It has that dark fruit you think of being a mainly belgian charachter. It works well. And the fact it is a regular release for 7.99/6 at 8.5 abv.... Well you sure can not beet that. If I were looking to get shitty some night I could see my self grabbing a 6 or 2 of this and goin at it!"

"Tasty enjoyable stuff"

"That left the finish not the way this one started out. I think that was my major reason why, I couldnt give this one higher grades"
""
"Pours a  clear  ruby  color with thin off white head,  couple dots of lace.  Smell:  earthy,  heavily caramelized sugars, dark fruit - fig, black cherry.  Taste: dirty I  suppose.  Earthy,  toasted dark bread,  caramel,  fig,  fruit candy.  Good,  not  terribly interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very well rounded and balanced brew, quite smooth and yet complex."
"Totally worth the $12 I paid for a 6 pack. This will be my go-to scotch ale for a nice, smooth sipper on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
""
"The fascination of this brew isn't in it's complexity or nuance, but how you can keep such a sweet malt-bomb contained and drinkable. There are just enough drying aspects around the edges to keep this going down smoothly."

" I think if she was oaked it would be like a perfect scotch ale... Everything you need is right there. Sweet, high abv., woodsy maltiness.... The only downer is that you can taste the boozyness a little too much. But hey!!! Don't be troubled! This is a b*tchin beer to have any time. Brothers graduation/ Alien invasion/ Wednesday brunch."
"This is an excellent brew, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"O: A very nice Scotch ale, it hits the mark. Too easy to sip away at this one."
"I rated this a 4 previously. Probably due to the malt complexity and low alcohol bite. Good scotch ale for the rare occasion I'm in the mood for one."

"I usually like Scotch ales, but this one was far too hoppy and bitter. Founders is a terrific brewery, but I wish they would scale back on the hops in their beers that are stylistically defined as being more malt-centric."

"Ok, I know I rated this as perfection but I really have not met a Founders beer I don't love! They do their beers proper and Dirty Bastard is one of my favorites. I have had it both on tap and in the bottle and loved it equally. I am planning a trip to Founders soon, looking forward to having it fresh!"
""
""
""
""
"This ""Bastard"" pours a dark amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is a pungent mix of yeast and hops. The taste starts very sweet and malty and finishes slightly bitter. Not really what I was expecting in a Scotch Ale but still very good!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice beer, one of the best I've had in the last few weeks and one that I wouldn't mind picking up again considering it wasn't the most expensive. A very nice and wonderfully complex aroma that fades slightly in the taste but in nonetheless still an excellent beer."

" overall a primo example of the style esp. for being a year round offering. very hard to beat for the price"

"Pours a muddy brown with copper and golden edges. The finger of buttery brown head dissipated quickly. The nose has some malt notes, but it is not very strong. The flavor is hearty and malty, but it is not super heavy considering the style and the ABV. There is a slight malty sweetness on the finish."

"Very interesting for me and I like that. I can see where the alcohol can be distracting but that's part of the schtick of a scotch ale. Decent offering from Founders."
"Very drinkable though bigger bodied. Nice beer."
""
""
""
"Another good showing from Founders."
"O: A strong representative of the style. Very intriguing as well- dark yet refreshing, smells of toffee yet has barely any sweetness, strong flavors yet muted aromas. A good brew, not quite up my alley but I'll still enjoy it if I find one in my hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am pleasantly surprised with this beer. I found Backwoods Bastard to be memorably mediocre. And after drinking this, my dislike may be even more. This isn't a burly monster that would benefit from barrel-aging. This is actually pretty balanced with a nicely complex malt profile."
""
""
""

""
""

"Overall- Very drinkable, alcohol is hid pretty well. Fairly sweet with just enough roasty bitterness to help balance it."

"I love the fact I get to review this thank you founders great name too and pours a very deep tawny red hue with a creamy one finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is creamy vanilla,ripe fruit and toffee,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated maybe a little too much and has tastes of vanilla,caramel,toffee malts,candied plums and finishes with a nutty,biscuity bittersweetness and overall it's very drinkable for the style but not sensational cheers."

"I found this to be pretty mediocre. It was thick enough to have sort of an oily feel on the roof of my mouth, but still managed to seem a little boring in flavour. It was drier than any scotch style ale, I've had, which was interesting, but I also didn't taste nearly as much smoke flavour as I'm used to, so that was a pretty big bummer."
""
"Overall: This is a great Scotch Ale. It has a fairly complex taste and it's pretty sweet and malty, but well balanced. I would definitely order this again if I am in the mood; although, this beer is not necessarily my favorite style."

"Poured into thistle glass. Dark brown and clear, showing deep garnet/ruby in light with a minimal fizzy off-white head that dissipates into a thin rim of fizz. Smells like...Grape Nuts cereal. And that's a good thing, in this case. Nutty, crackery, slightly caramelized malt with a tiny hint of hops at the end. Can't wait to taste this, with a nose like that...and I am not disappointed. Sweet, crackery caramel malts are all over the place, with warming alcohol hiding in the background between a pinch of bittering herbal hop at the end. Mouthfeel is full but smooth, a bit sticky. Delicious."
""
"O: A great take on the style. Earthy, dirty rich with a surprising spiciness. There is a lot more hops than I expected. I definitely recommend trying this."
"O: a solid Scotch ale overall that really only falls short on a subdued aroma. It's tasty and drinkable without being overly sweet."

"Mahogany pour with a two finger creamy off white head that fades pretty quickly with nice lacing. A somewhat subdued earthy, malty nose with hints of caramel, maple, wood, toffee, and a touch of herbal perfume as it warms. The complex taste is rich and malty with lots of caramel and brown sugar along with hints of maple, dark fruits, wood, molasses, butterscotch, vanilla, and a distinct herbal, piney note that I've tasted with Heather beers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated, slightly syrupy, with a subtle warming burn on the finish. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Overall, this is not a style I'm really familiar with, but as always, Founders leaves me wanting more."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown, rich, no foam to speak of. Woodsy nose. Caramel malt too. Taste is a peat/earthy with a whiskey back. Clingy finish. Smooth mouthfeel, low carbonation. Overall decent, good take on the style, but quite earthy. To be fair, I am not the biggest fan of this style."

"UPDATE 12/27/13: Had two more from a sixpack I purchased, bottled 10/08/13, probably much fresher than the one reviewed last May, and the head on initial pour was three inches, requiring a second pour. Same great taste as the first."
""
""
"O: Full Disclosure--this is one of my favorite styles. That said, this beer is for me one of the best executions of this unique style in Dirty Bastard. Not too alcoholic and not too sweet. The 8.5% is perfect and the beer is just heavy enough without being pretentious. Very highly recommended. Up there with the Imperial Stout among the best offerrings out of Grand Rapids. If you can find its more sophisticated brother, Backwards Bastard, you'll be in for a rare treat."

"O- This is a nice scotch ale that is not available to me here in Louisiana. I am glad I got to try it once. Wish I could get more Founders brews here. I enjoyed it and would have another if I had a second bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager sensory glass."
"Overall/Comments: DB was my first offering from Founders and I was not disappointed. DB is a great Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy that is a bit more sweet and a bit less smokey than others that I have sampled. Packed with flavor this goes down very easy! Consumed 3/26/13. Classified as a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy at 8.5% ABV."
""

"Overall- Very nice beer. Even nicer is its availability, at least here in Cleveland. Basic flavors surround this beer and seems to fit well to its style. Overall a good drink for the seasoned beer drinker, may ward off those who aren't."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Light scents of honey, molasses, and cloves. The color is a beautiful, deep reddish-brown or mahogany. Tastes of burnt-sugar, sourdough, toasted marshmallows, and currants on the fore. Lemongrass, oranges, and piney on the finish, with a nice, light hoppiness and a slight taste of alcohol. A wonderful beer through and through. Very well-balanced. If I had to say that it left anything to be desired, perhaps I'd enjoy a tad more hops on the finish, but that would really be nit-picking."

"I'm happy to finally have Founder's in Texas. I actually confused this brew with backwoods bastard and was a little disappointed at first when I realized my mistake. However, this beer does not disappoint. It was fairly harsh at first but I think that was just because it was my first beer of the day. This beer is just wonderful. Beautiful pour and aroma. The taste is similar to the aroma but even more complex. I can't really compare this to other Scotch ales as I haven't had many but Dirty Bastard is good no matter the category. Buy it and don't look back."

"Pours a rich, murky, copper color akin to an old suitcase. Head is slight, maybe a finger or slightly less, but the lacing stays throughout. Nose is strong of molasses, raisins, prunes, and a bit of Scotch smokiness. Taste is well-balanced, with molasses and figs coming through most prominently. Overall a great beer, as Founders is want to make, and a great example of Scotch ale."

"Gorgeous old dark leather wallet color, deep brown with transparency and hints of red. The mouthfeel was very smooth easy feeling, with a nice crisp taste. All and all very satisfied I'd give this sucker a solid 93."

"Pours a dark, cloudy red/brown with a thin, white head. Smell is sweet with a big alcohol presence. It's not very strong, and not exactly pleasant. Let's just say the smell alone would probably turn me off. Taste is sweet and malty with a slight sting and bitterness. The alcohol aftertaste lingers. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. A lot of carbonation that dissipates over time. Overall, this is an alright brew. I don't think I'd go out of my way to get it again though. I guess I'm just not much of a Scotch Ale fan."

The Dirty Bastard makes an exquisite quaff for any lad and lassie willing to experience a complex concoction of a style that is truly hard to get right. Founders really got this Dirty Bastard right and gave us an example of a wonderful Scottish beer that will bring out the Braveheart in all of us. Freedom!"

""
"Overall, this is good beer, though the smoky peats could have been stronger, and the sugars somewhat lighter to achieve a better sense of balance. The hops were also rather strong in the aftertaste, for while the malts could largely overcome the heavy 50 IBUs in the main mouthful, they lose to them in the aftertaste. Still, the beer is highly drinkable, and quite delicious."

"The mouthfeel is like a porter. It's surpsingly easy to drink despite the ABV."
"Just got back from my friend Kat's wedding. This brew pours up mahogany with light off white lacing. Aroma is malty, caramel, molasses, red apple peel, subtle kiss of hops. The taste is subtle smoky, caramel, vagina, little bittering hop background. Full bodied, nice crispy carbo bite. I'm Scottish and I gotta say, this is a damn fine wee heavy"
"Even though there was an extensive selection of beers, I was enjoying the Dirty Bastard so much I just stuck with a couple of them before coffee and dessert. I like the high ABV darker malt beers and this was a good one."

"A thick feel compliments the robust malt flavor. Touches of raisin, prune, cracker, bread and sorghum waft smoothly along the palate. With a smooth, easy taste and feel this a solid entry for a sipping winter warmer."

"The color is dark cola and it delivers a nice 1-inch beige head that lingers quite long. Smell is very pleasing, caramel-driven. Good body and carbonation, the high ABV can barely be felt. Crispy aftertaste courtesy of the well balanced hoppiness. The dominant flavor I found was that of prunes, intermixed with caramel malt and some light roasted notes. Very enjoyable. I wish I had more bottles in my fridge!"

"I picked this up at the Piggly Wiggly on a whim, not knowing anything about it. Glad I did. It's one of my favorite beers of all times. It's dark, but not syrupy and cloying. It's tasty, but the taste doesn't get in the way of drinkability. I usually like my dark beers to taste like a meal, but this one doesn't and I don't mind. With a 8.5 ABV, it's a lot of bang for your buck. Great stuff."

"Overall, I guess not worth aging"

"O - I really loved this beer, I wish I could have grabbed some more, I'm really starting to fall in love with this style. A great sweet dessert beer, or just a nice sweet winter beer. I would drink this anytime however."
""
"O - A very tasty and well made scotch ale. It's almost night and day when compared to Backwoods though. Backwoods really loses quite a bit of the dark fruits. As a year round, sub-$10 six pack this is pretty damn awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25/5): Founders Dirty Bastard is quite the Scotch Ale. It is rich and packed with all sorts of caramel, dark fruit, light hops, and peaty flavors. Quite complex and just the right amount of decadence to be an excellent after-dinner beer. Would go great with a traditional Bavarian meal...It's too early to be having these thoughts...Go out and buy a sixer. Great value."

"O- I would say the best scotch style ale I've had, but only really had the Sam Adams variant though so I guess I can't really judge the style as much. For a beer overall though this is some good stuff, very complex taste, the fruity character is reminiscent of a Belgian ale, but the slight smokey peat taste sets it apart. Not bad for the price per six pack, will definitely purchase again. Thanks Founders, you have yet to let me down."

"Overall this brew is good on the nose but the taste does not follow the nose as well as it should. Not a bad Scotch Ale but it would be better if all of the smells were present in the taste."
"Pours a clear dark copper with minimal head. Aroma is mostly caramel and some citrus hops. Also, a good bit of dark fermented fruit, oak and some boozieness. Taste is light bitter and light sweet. Lots of caramel and citrus hops with dark fruit and oak. Full bodied with a creamy texture. Lively carbonation and a long finish. Overall, a very enjoyable beer."
""

"What more can you say? This could be considered ""A freaking good beer""! A beautiful deep amber color. Small 1/4"" head that dissipates rather quickly. Pretty much a perfect balance between malt/hops. Just the right amount of carbonation. One of my top 5 all time favorites! The only downside to this beer is that I don't live closer to the brewery and its Utopian taps."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There's a reason this is one of Founders' mainstays. Such a great example of the style. If I close my eyes and pretend, I can taste Backwoods."
"i do like the beer on occasion, but i just can't get over the ending flavor. this beer smells and looks great as it is unfiltered (which i love). the ABV content is awesome if you drink only a couple per sitting as i do....maybe there is something wrong with my pallet as it is not my favorite, however i will give it a break and definetly try it again down the road as it is still on my list of top fives. i will pay the extra for the Skull Splitter for now...still looking"
""
""
"Overall, I found this beer to be a little bit one dimensional. The caramel maltiness is excellent but I would've liked a little more complexity. The sweetness is a little much for me as well. Backwoods Bastard is ten times better than the Dirty."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent Scotch Ale, great even who does not dig the style. Got balance, character and lots of flavors."
""
""

"O: Enjoyable choice. Seemed to get better the more I drank, and the warmer it became. The last few sips near room temperature were the best. Easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Caramel, fruits, and a peaty character I guess. Fairly carbonated and medium bodied."
"Excellent scotch ale, full body and smooth finish. Maybe a small hint of alcohol on the finish, not bad considering the abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Incredible beer. This style has always been hit or miss for me. Sometimes too sweet but other times balanced and properly malty. This is definite hit. A direct hit. If other Scotch Ales were like this, I'd drink them more often. Now, on to Backwoods Bastard!"
""
""
""
"The progression in taste is certain one that rises in its intensity, which is always welcome. The first thing that hits the palate is a very sweet, brown-sugary scotch taste. Don't mistake this as an indication that the 8.5% ABV isn't masked well, for this is quite the contrary. Near the middle there is an odd hop presence that falls somewhere between the ""earthy"" and ""grassy"" area of the spectrum (excuse my ambiguous terminology; I'm not well-versed in specific hop varieties enough to accurately diagnose it beyond that). Each sip taste a bit different, for I just tasted an almost milkshake chocolately note that I've never found before, which itself is a testament to the devious sweetness of this heavy brew. Not much carbonation here gives rise to a ""syrupy"" texture with a creamy mouthfeel and oddly wet finish. Everything here is really well balanced, and in order."

"O: great beer worth buying all the time."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, murky brown like a very dark honey with a fleeting, yellowish head rising up a half-finger on a good day and rather quickly dissipating to a thin lace then fragmenting into mere wisps, but beneath this there's noteworthy substance: notes of caramel rise up with chocolate and coffee that inhabit the taste, too, along with a hit of butter to boot and a touch of toffee--yum; the mouthfeel being medium and impressively smooth from start to finish. A satisfying and highly recommended Scotch ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice beer. A bit heavy on the abv but tasty! The color and head are average. It has a nice carbonation throughout even after the head settles. The taste is malty at first but the hops lingers for quite a while after you put the glass down. A six pack was about 14 bucks which I think is this beers only downfall. It is good but not good enough for me to lay down this much money for it again. There are many beers as good or better for a few bucks less. I find Yards ESA is comparable in style and flavor for about 10 bucks a six pack. Over all it is worth a try."

"O - A solid Scotch Ale. Hits the basic criteria of a Scotch (high ABV, smoky, strong taste). However, it's not as good as Arcadia's Loch Down. The Dirty Bastard is a bit thicker without a corresponding stronger taste. The taste could be clearer and bigger for the body around it."
""
""
"The typical tea like bitterness was not present, instead, the taste buds are overwhelmed with mroe bitterness than what is typical of the style. Very American interpretation. Lots of caramel, sugar, and biscuit in the malt backbone. Slight spicyness from the alcohol."

"Overall - Nice, drinkable scotch. Great all-around balance. Does well to hide the 8.5%; my guess would've been around 6%. I could stand to drink several more of these. I've only tried a handful, but this is probably the best Scotch ale I've had to date."
""
""
""
""
"Don't stay thirsty my friends. Get some Founders and quench that thirst, dammit!"
""
"12 oz bottle (with no bottle date) enjoyed in a snifter on 12/1/12. Pours a deep brown and ruby highlighted color under a well represented head. A complex aroma sings the notes of deep roasted sweet bready malt, dark fruit, mint, and caramel. Rich toasted malt and a fair load of hop character delivers a wee boozy and well spiced flavor. Mild smokey note echoes in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer from Founders"
""
""
""
""
"O- One of the better scotch ales I have tried. Good malt flavors, good hop presence, great feel."
""
""
""
""
"Pours exactly what I expect from a scotch ale. A deep color that is somewhere between a copper and a dark brown/ruby. Rather flat on the pour which was a bit disappointing. Aromas of coffee and candied fruits. Very, very pleasing aromas that do remind me of mccallan 12yr. Toasty, but sweet at the same time with a hint of that peat. My biggest disappointment on the beer came on taste. It is just sort of ""meh"". Not much intensity or the sweet fruits on the pallet, rather, a bit of maltiness followed by a bitter finish. May have to add a few tasting notes as this one continues to reach room temperature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Old Chub, Alesmith, Mackroken Flower, to name a few, outrank this beer in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours deep brownish red. Head a light tan. Sweet chocolate/caramel aroma and taste. Twists in a little bitterness, possibly from the hops, on the finish that's a bit rough. Clean, full mouth feel and not over carbonated. Hides the alcohol well, making it a touch dangerous. Good beer."

"This is a very nice wee heavy that I've been fortunate enough to have available year-round in most stores. Definitely a slow-drinker with a strong 8.5% ABV profile, but very inviting and flavorful all the way down."
"www.brewreviewboston.blogspot.com"
""
""
"O: It's different, unique, its strong, so drink it slow, the hard bourbon after taste is interesting, Put it on your list."
""
"Wow, this turned out to be a beer that I liked much more than I expected. Great golden, brown color. Nose with lots of grape, fig flavors. an extremely smooth and malty taste, with alcohol nicely in a supporting role. A superb creamy mouth. I just hope I don't like it less the next time. Even though I like Founders a lot, this was a nice pleasant surprise."

"This is a rich, heavy, sweet, tasty beer. Nice looking, great smelling, with a bourbon influenced feel. Not sure if this was aged in oak but it sure tastes like it."
""
""
"O - Simple but very good. Usually I am looking for more depth from a beer, but the flavor profile on this one works extremely well with such few elements. You can feel the alcohol after a few sips as it numbs the back of your throat, but I never tasted it. Really well done. Certainly worth trying if you like the dark stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could be better."
"Deep mahogany brown with a slight haze in the glass, a quick pour gives a thin head of tiny bubbles that dissipate fairly quickly. The smell is of all malt and just what a scotch ale should be. Caramels dominate with a bit of chocolate and bready notes in there as well. A sugary sweetness and touch of alcohol are also present. The taste is similar to the smell with the strong caramel maltiness as the base. Surprisingly this beer is not as sweet as I would have expected given the smell and the style as there is a significant amount of bitterness, with little in the way of hop flavor to balance the malt. Beyond the caramel there is a bit of dark fruit and earthy yeast character that add to the complexity of this beer, alcohol is also present but it is restrained and seems just right for this style. This is a big, rich and creamy beer that floats along the tongue leaving a tingle and slight alcohol numbing character. Overall this is a very solid example of the style, I personally would have liked tit to be a bit sweeter throughout but that is a small complaint as this is still a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark red almost brown color with a creamy off white head, excellent retention and lacing. Smell is nice, some roasted malt and caramel notes. Slight earthy notes. Taste is good, slightly alcoholic flavor, roasted bitterness, and slight earthy characteristic notes. Wonderful, creamy smooth mouthfeel, low carbonation and medium body. Overall, a very good beer, good example of the style. I would recommend giving it a try if you can find it."
""
"Very, very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good example of a scotch ale. My hats off to this beer by Founders."
"My first Scottish Ale has a dark caramel appearance. A strong scent of malts and toffee. Dirty Bastard is both thick and creamy with Toffee and caramel tastes. Overall a great beer that is full bodied and warming. It stays with you and you should try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice overall, a touch sweeter than I like."
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep red-brown colour, fairly murky looking, just a whisp of white head, little to no lace present. Smell is big and malty, sweet caramel, toffee, some dark bread, dark fruit, raisin and plums, light booze comes off as well. Taste is rich and malty, dark druits come across initially, caramel and toffee, lightly sweet throughout, long fruity finish and aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, full body, chewey and very thick. A delicious and complex offering from Founders, really nice stuff that I would be happy to have in my glass anytime."
""
""
"Overall: Incredible beer. This is so easy to drink. I will definitely have this again. Founders is definitely on my radar for dark beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Limed this beer a lot. I have a slight cold atm so my smell and taste might be a tad off. Really enjoyed the earthy taste it leaves on back of rouge/mouth"
""
""
""
"Mouth- A light body with a close to med/high carb level. A nice body to it. but could have been a little to carbed."
"Aside from the exceptional name, this beer is just above average. The malt profile is anemic for the strong hop front flavor. The balance swings heavily towards IBU's, which just ruin a Scotch Ale (in my opinion). If this beer was bitter more on the front or middle I would be able to enjoy it more... but as a finishing flavor, it just doesn't have enough Malty Caramel to balance out."
"A very unconventional scotch ale to say the least. At 50 IBUs with a much less pronounced malt profile than expected, this beer surprised me. It was fantastic beer but did not seem at all true to style. The hops are great for someone like myself but may not be what others are looking for when they choose to purchase this beer."
"Founders Dirty Bastard is a cloudy, red-brown ale topped with a thin, bubbly, yellowish film. It has a sweet, whiskey like aroma; malty and resiny. It's pretty full bodied and smooth with a dusty finish. It's sweet and syrupy. It tastes malty and resiny, just like the aroma. There may be a hint of peat and lots of toffee. This is a solid and well done Scotch ale."
""
""
"Mouth-feel is very silky and full, a tasty beer with lots of flavor."
"Drink- I guess I just like my Scotch Ales, BB. This was a good beer from Founders but like the amped up version better. I still have one of these to sit on for a year, so we will see what happens to it."
""
"O: This was a very good scotch ale; but, the scotch ale style may not appeal to every beer drinker. Also, this one has just has just a little bit of harshness from its boozy flavor (But hey, it’s called “Dirty Bastard,” so you should expect a little extra harshness.) The maraschino cherry and the toffee sweetness were balanced by the booziness and the peaty and earthy hops bitterness. It all worked together well to create a scotch ale just complex enough to be interesting and just simple enough to be bold."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a big beer with significant alcohol - otherwise I'd have 3 or 4! You generally can't go wrong at Founder's, but this was just a great pint and a nice finish on a lovely evening."
""
"Pours an attractive ruby color with a small, short-lived creamy head. A brief whiff of booze gives way to dark fruit, brown bread, tobacco, prune, and toffee. Smooth, malty flavors...chocolate, berries, nuts, earthiness, and a wee bit of smoke. Not terribly sweet, which is good, finishing with a moderate bitterness. A hint of oxidation is present in the nose, but I can't make out the date on the bottle to tell how old this is. Body is a little better than medium and fairly creamy. I haven't had this in years and though quite tasty, I don't like it as much as I remember."
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, the color was a deep reddish brown and exhibited no head and no lacing. Smell was roasted malt and some alcohol. Taste is sweet upfront with notes of toffee and caramel. The finish is grapefruity and sort of warm due to a higher than usual ABV. I enjoyed this one. We finally got it in Alabama a month or so ago. Previously it had been banned due to the name. Go figger."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth, hint of choc. and robust! I loved it. I have had other scottish ales and this was as good as any I have had. The most recent 'dirty bastard' that I have had was at Mellow Mushroom in Myrtle Beach...a draft from Highland Brewery in Asheville, NC. The Founders was much better in taste and was definitely smoother(which I enjoy...I am not a major hops fan, I prefer smoother taste AND aftertaste)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a perfect example of the style. I'm not a huge fan of this style but I know when Founders does a beer, they usually hit the mark and this is no exception!"
""
""
"I like it. I'll come back to review again if I ever get on a Scotch/Wee Heavy kick. I love founders."
"A true sipper."
""
""
""
"O: Interesting note: After not having this beer in some time, the first bottle of the six pack comes across fairly heavy on the dark fruits. However, my taste buds seem to adapt for subsequent bottles in the following days, masking most of the raison flavor and allowing the sweeter malts to shine and making the beer more enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good scotch ale. The nose was really sweet, and it tasted like a scotch ale."
""
"O - This beer was my first review ever back in early June. At the time, I actually thought this stuff was strong and harsh. Now I see it as weak and slightly bland since I know what I'm talking about beer-wise. It is very drinkable though."
""
""
"This is a very tasty beer, the dark fruit tastes and smell are great. Would have like the body to be a bit heavier."
"I'm going to come straight out and admit this first. I am comparing this to Oskar Blues Old Chub... When I think of Scotch Ale, I think of Old Chub.... When I hear Scotch Ale, I think of SCOTCH. THE LIQUOR! This Dirty Bastard tastes like a soured malt with a little hops to attempt to weakly offset it. It isn't terrible but it certainly isn't great. I don't recommend it unless it's all you can get because it's at least a high alcohol content... so if it's cheap for you to get, grab it and get wasted... if not, pass it up for some flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very sweet and malty, hides the booze pretty well. This one will sneak up on you!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: This is my first scotch ale, and I really quite like it. I thought it would be extremely big, bold, and heavy, but it really isn't. You get some sweet malty flavor at first sip, but a warming on the swallow, as well as a nice, bready aftertaste. You can taste the alcohol a decent bit as well, which I expect would be typical from a beer of this style. Yet again, another solid Founders beer."
""
"There's sufficient complexity in the nut and bitter flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a really solid Scotch ale. Not my favorite American (Alesmith) or European (Traquir) but really solid none-the-less. A bit too sweet overall for my tastes but not to the cloying level of say Cigar City Big Sound which is just way too sweet. Recommended for sure especially because it's available to numerous markets in 6-pack form."
""
""
"Bottle. Mahogany brown pour with neat tan head. Slightly alcohol aroma. Predominantly like prune juice with butterscotch notes. Rich peaty flavor of dark fruits with bitter chocolate (was not expecting that) and anise notes. Snappy mouthfeel. Lively on the tongue, but heavy on the lips. Warms the belly like a good Scotch ale should. This is a very smooth ale. I was a little surprised by the chocolate in the taste, but it really blended the other flavors beautifully. The finish was much more traditional and good. A very nice beer. My first from Founders. Must have more."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This brew poured with a half a finger of thick, tan head. It dissipated at a moderate pace and left a hint of a crown on top of the body, yet no lacing. The body was a dark mahogany color with moderate carbonation visible and a huge amount of ""floaties."" The nose presented with smoke, roasted nuts, rich caramel and even a hint of dark fruit. A very robust nose to say the least. The taste had a lot going on. I got nuttiness, caramel malt, brown sugar and then smoke. There was also a bit of fruit in the background as well. The booze made a quick appearance at the end of the sip. The body was bigger than I'm used to seeing for the style with lower than expected carbonation. The finish was long with nuttiness and smoke. This could be one of the best beers of this style that I've had. All of the flavors worked with each other and it was a great sipping beer. I would definitely have this beer again. This is the beer I'm using as a benchmark for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A good benchmark for those looking for characteristics of a Scotch ale. Bigger than expected however, so maybe not the best intro to an uninformed palate."
""
""
""
"Overall- A very good Scotch Ale, probably my 2nd favorite after old chub. Well balanced smoke and sweet with a fruity hop that all balances well together."
""
""
"Bittering finish, fairly smoothe throughout. Decent, but not up to the standards of other Founder's stuff I've had, or other Scotch Ales I've had. Check it, but don't rush out to get it."
""
""
"A pretty solid scotch ale, but it's definatly not one of my favorite styles. But it's an amazing beer barrel aged, crazy how much better it makes it."

"The taste was a delicious bready, malty sweetness with a fairly substantial alcohol kick on the back end. To be honest, I am going to have to taste this one again and compare it to some of my other favorite Scotch Ales but my initial impressions are that this is a great offering by Founders."

""
"Overall. Interesting and quite big. I haven't had many of this style, but certainly haven't had one like this. Interesting beer for sure."
""
"Final Thoughts: This beer accomplishes the main goal of being a Scotch Ale and also delivers a robust palate with a lot to like about it. Although I can't see myself opting for a six pack of this, it is a nice treat in small doses."

"O: A very delicious brew that represents the style nicely. Founder's Brewery does very well to represent the style, and this is another example of how well they can achieve that a goal. A definite must try."
""
"Thin tan head did not last too long, dispersed into pretty much nothing; looks flat. Color is super dark red and brown, almost rusty. smell is just ok, nothing spectacular. Hints of vanilla, some caramel, even smoke, maybe some dark fruit aromas, and minimal hops. taste is similar, but very smooth and light. Not a ton of bite in this. Overall this is just ok. I prefer other of Founders offerings to this. Not bad, but just does not compare to others I've had."
""
""
""
"O – This beer is terrific. There is so much malty goodness in the aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel. Perfect example of a Scotch ale/wee heavy. I wish Founders’ brewery was in my backyard so I could just drink all of their beer all the time. They kill it every single time."
""
""
""
"Dark brown/maroon with a tan head. Light retention and lace. Nose has lots of caramel, toffee and candy sweetness. Even a bit of maple syrup maybe. Nice, complex malt character all 'round. Taste is again all malt, caramel, dark breads, candy and syrupy sweetness, perhaps even a shred of peat. Dark dried fruits and some caramelized banana. Neutral finish, as the sweetness doesn't carry on for too long which was a definite plus. Alcohol is evident, but is well incorporated into the flavour. Full bodied and coats the mouth. An excellent scotch ale for sure."

"O: The Dirty Bastard isn't much of a bastard. It's actually quite nice and smooth with rich malty flavors. Very enjoyable."
""
"O: One of the most ""sessionable"" scotch ales I've had, even though at 8.5% it'll get you into trouble quickly. It's delicious, goes down easy, and is all-around a pleasure to drink. I think I'll have another..."

"I'll give this beer 4's all around. For a Scott Ale/Wee Heavy, this beer is great. I drank this right after having an IPA brew, so the first thing I noticed was the strong malt presence and caramel. Great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. If you like a beer that's sweet, malty, and heavy, Dirty Bastard is a must try."

"12oz bottle, pours a deep brown with reddish tinges, thinner foamy tan head holds decent retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are earthy peat, malty, brown sugar, caramel, raisin, toffee, booze. Tastes are earth, peat, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, faint chocolate as it warms, a little bit of spice from the hops. Mouth-feel is smooth and creamy while being medium bodied. Overall, always a favorite of mine for the style. Well balanced with good complexity."

"Taste starts out with the caramel roasted malt front, a nice sweetness of dark fruit, very sticky with a slightly syrup like texture, somehow it avoids being overly sweet or cloying, soft yet ample amount of carbonation, strength is very well hidden."
""
"Nice."
"Overall, a nice beer, and in the end a good example of the style."
""
"D: This is the best way to explain what I think its shortcoming is: it has all the darkness that I expect from beers of its style, but none of the depth. It's an above-50th-percentile Scotch Ale, but still meh."
"Pours a deep amber brown color, with a small cream colored head. Aroma is some big sweet caramel, peat, butterscotch. Strong up front butterscotch and booze flavor, but finishes nicely with just enough bitterness to balance and a bit of lingering peat. These are generally sippers for me, though this one goes down pretty easily for the ABV. A winner from Founders and very popular for a reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I love Scotch ales. This is a pretty decent American offering of this style. Not exactly as smokey and big as a true Scotch ale, but this one is smooth, and at 8.5, surely to please. Slainte!!"

""

"Dark brown pour, small tan head, little lacing. Light vanilla and scotch smell, though nothing too distinct. Taste is incredibly smooth, bourbon, vanilla, malt, a hint of chocolate, and other flavors that blend very well I can't quite put my finger on yet. Lightly carbonated. Very likeable beer, would get again."
"This beer was a great surprise. Not a usual fan of the style, but this one delivered. The malt profile was so much more complex than a usual Scotch Ale. Wonderful sweetness was met with a touch of smoke and a sensational mouthfeel. A real treat to drink all the way. I'll definitely get another."
""
"Beautiful deep maple, exceptionally clear, with radiant copper hues in the light. A very nicely lacing beige head keeps its integrity the entire time. Incredibly clean nose with notes of caramel, toffee, carob, brandy, and dates. Flavor is unsurpassed in balance, intensity, complexity, and the long lasting finish. All the flavors of malts, dark fruits, treacle, and a hint of spice from the alcohol melds perfectly on my palate. Touch of roast in the finish too, an unexpected surprise. Prickly carbonation with this heavy bodied hitter. I would prefer slightly less carbonation. Overall, this is quite the dirty bastard with whom to drink. Cheers!"

"O: Very nice malty brew with complex sweetness and minimal bitterness. Very enjoyable."

"I will now go on record by saying if “Bastard’s” in the name, I am going to enjoy whatever is in the bottle! Founder’s Dirty Bastard is an outstanding ale that has earned a place in my inventory for the foreseeable future! Enjoyed straight from the bottle, chilled to approximately 42 degrees, the taste is extremely satisfying, not as harsh as the 8.5% ABV would imply! The smell is sweet with a definite twinge to it, reminiscent of Barley wine style ale! Being that this is the first Scotch style ale I’ve sampled, if this represents the genre, I do not have anything to compare it too, but if it does, it now ranks among my favorites!"
""

"O- Looks better than it tastes. Flavors and smells not nearly as lively and rich as I was hoping for. Certainly not bad, but there are much better scotch ales out there."
"O: I. Love. This. Beer! Perfect for one of the last chilly rainy days before Summer."
""
"This beer will warm you up, but so far it has been of my least favorite scotch ales. Founders does a great job with every beer, and this beer wasn't bad, but I felt it was a bit below average for the style. I would probably still drink it again and maybe even buy it again. It's a sipper, certainly not going to drink more than 2 of these in a given night. I gave it lower scores due to the fact that I have found several other scotch ales I enjoyed as much or more for a lower price."

"O: This beer has all the great elements of a scotch style ale, with the perfect amount of smoke and maltiness without being too sweet. A nice sipper at 8.5%, too"
"Overall another staple in the Founders lineup. Happy I can finally get it in NY. Fairly versatile for a strong dark beer."

"Pours into the glass a slightly cloudy dark reddish brown color without much of a head. The smell is one for the maltheads. Caramel and brown sugar coated cherries and raisins mixed with a hint of smoke and a touch of ethanol. The flavor is rich and malty with just enough smoke and burnt to keep it from being cloying. Lots of caramel and dark fruits abound. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I've had this before and I'm surprised I hadn't rated it yet. Great brew, now distribute to NH already!"

"355ml bottle. Oversized glass. Enjoyed on feb´12. Pours dark amber in color, ruby to the light. Thin, quickly dissipated head, tan color. Toasted malts, caramel malts & sugar to the nose. Sparkling chocolate, dry bitterness, dark fruits & intense maltiness compound the flavor profile. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Dry astringent finish. Plum touch on the aftertaste. Easy drinkability."

"A hazy brownish amber on the pour with a very thin tan head. Aroma is fruity, yeast, caramel malt, some dark fruit notes and sweet alcohol esters fill the senses. Taste is dark fruit, caramel malt some yeast with some bitterness. The Palate is a full body with slightly smooth dry mouthfeel with good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, yeast, fruity followed by a some alcohol and slightly dry bitterness ending with a bit of lingering sweet nutty flavor. Aroma and flavor really come through as it warms up. Overall a good representation of the style"

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 2/15/2012. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, molasses, plum, biscuit, toast, toffee, and light herbal. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, prune, biscuit, raisin, peat, molasses, light chocolate, toffee, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, raisin, prune, peat, toasted biscuit, light chocolate, and herbal spiciness for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors with good complexity; and no cloying sweetness. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very nice creamy, lush, and slick mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a great scotch ale. Nice flavor balance, with a good amount of robustness and complexity; and very smooth to sip on."

"O- A great wee heavy. Founders can almost do no wrong in my book. The subtle nuances of this beer, the straightforward nose, and the mouthfeel just prove how well craft beer can be done."
""
""

"O. This brew is everything I expected from Founders, which is already one of my favorite breweries whose product is sadly hard to come by in this part of the country. I will be seeking this one out in the future, and wishing it were more readily available."
""
"O: it was definitely a solid scottish ale and was glad to try another great brew from founders."
"D ~ Not a chugger, but so Vibrant for a Wee Heavy. If you like HEAVY Scotch Ales check this one out. A lot of character here that sets it apart from others."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a Mad Elf tulip glass. This beer gave off an instant carmel-sweet vibe in aroma. I'm not in love with wee heavy's of the world but I respect this one. First sip is the like the first bite of a rich dessert- you love it at first realize only the heavyweights can really go for multiple rounds. I began to feel a sweetness driven nausea at the end this brew which through me for a loop because I enjoyed the taste."
""
"Note: Weizen glass was the only glassware available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, rich copper color with almost no head at all. No visible carbonation to speak of. Dirty Bastard smells of bread, toffee, spice, floral hops, and alcohol. The taste is quite smooth, I wish I had snifter and perhaps a fine cigar. It is malty and finishes a bit sweet with a hint of smoke. This Dirty Bastard packs a wallop. This is my first foray with a Scotch Ale and I find it quite enjoyable."
""
"I'd love to try a fresh tap of this one and I still get to try an aged bottle thanks to papat444 sending me a mini vertical, I've yet to be disappointed by a Founders brew and this one pleases too"

"I advise avoiding this one. Too weird to be enjoyable."

"O: A beer so rich and complex you might mistake it for stew with an old boot thrown in. I think I had a hangover halfway through."
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a dark chestnut with good lacing. The nose is interesting on this one, with some alcohol, wood, nutty caramel, vanilla, etc. Obviously malty. The taste evens out the sweetness with a comforting bitterness, and a smooth feel due to low carbonation (which I tend to love). As it warms, some dried, dark fruit flavors open up. Very easy to drink. Good offering from Founders."
""
"O: Great looks and tastes, but not so much on the smell and feel. I somewhat enjoyed the bottle, but won't be looking for more in the future."
""
""
""
"Great coffee notes on this extremely flaverfull full bodied ale. Lots of layers of malt balanced with just the right amount of hops. It seems as if there is another flavor picked up with your first five to ten sips. Is that chocolate? A little caramel? Some coffee? Delicious, Go Beer!"

""
""

"Nice job Founders, love it and am coming to buy more of you soon."

"O: This is a fairly average beer. The taste lacks luster, however the other components of the beer are give it some redeemable traits."

"O, a excellent world class beer, love it.. haven't had too many scotch ales, but I will be trying some more because Founders did such a good job"
"Pours a deep burnt orange/amber with a finger of short-lived off-white/tannish head, sporadic beading. The nose offers waves of toffee, toasted bread, consistent and somewhat pungent - the beer has already taken a distinct direction. The taste highlights much of the aroma plus some peat and smoky wood. Drinkability is pretty low but it doesn’t detract from the beer. I’m not an avid scotch ale drinker, but from what little I know, this is a good example of the style."

"This is a great beer to give somebody who is curious about what a benchmark Wee Heavy tastes like. It may not be the *very* top best in the style, but it is close enough...and in enough available supply locally to become my new ""90% gold standard"" of measurement for Wee Heavies."
"O: A nice dirty amber that's a little on the strong side."
""

"Revisited in Sept. 2012 -- aroma is rather delicate, and flavor has only a light and pleasant earthy/peat aspect, although still too much of a hint of liqueur. Different batch? Improvement by aging, ... not sure why, but I enjoyed this more than my original rating indicated, and tweaked my overall rating up (and again in Sept, 2014)."
""
""

"Overall an amazing beer. And the thing that really stood out to me is that as the beer warmed the flavors retained their synergy which left me astounded. Another great beer from founders."

"O - dirty bastard is a great offering from Fouders and had me from the first bottle. Just a solid scotch ale with the world class style of Founders. I couldn't find any real faults with this dirty bastard of an ale and I'll buy again in the very near future. A real treat"
""
""
""

""

"O: Pretty easy to drink for the style and the alcohol is not as upfront in the taste and smell as you sometimes get. Also, this beer is not as cloyingly sweet as other examples of the style. Definitely more of a sipping beer."
""
""
"Overall, much more complex than I expected. Good."
""
"O- I would have to say this is a very good looking beer. Great colors. The smells and flavors are pretty close to each other but nothing really explodes. The feel of it is a bit of a let down. I mean who wants to drink syrup? But overall not a bad beer. Definitely a slow sipper for me."

"overall, this scotch ale is missing the peat smoked maltiness and overall depth of character an ale of this style using 7 different types of malt. the nose is severely lacking and the flavour profile is average at best. that doesn't make this a bad beer...it's definitley sturdy and well built. probably will not revisit."

"Reviewed from notes. Originally had on tap, reviewed here from bottle notes. Pours a rich dark amber into dimpled mug with little head presence what so ever. Smells of malt, alcohol and dark fruits like plum and raisin. A rich, hearty mouthfeel of maltiness and alcohol but with the slight sweetness of dark fruits. A very good and balanced Scotch Ale without being too sweet or rich with the 8.5% abv very much in the mix, but not overly so, providing a nice warming effect. I enjoyed this more from the bottle than the 1st time, which was on tap."

"The aroma has a nice scotch and malt smell while, the taste is much the same. There is a lot of malt taste without it being overwhelming, it has a creamy texture, there is a distinct taste of hops in the background and it finishes with a hint of bitterness. Very pleased with this."
""
"There is a musty earthiness to this beer that I find quite intriguing. It adds a dimension that transcends a malt-heavy, bitter scotch ale. It's like eating a thick slice of rye bread with raisins in a cave. I'm not sure if that sounds appetizing but it was truly delicious."
""

"O: one of my favorites and one of the best examples of the style i have tried to date, also a fan of the backwoods bastard when i can find it"
"Overall: I love these beers. It was great to have both at once. The base beer is one of the better scotch ales I’ve had. The barrel aged big brother is sweet, smokey greatness that any fan of big beers, scotch, bourbon, LIFE ITSELF ... will love. Seek these out. Enjoy them."
"Pours a deep dark amber color that is clear but difficult to see through. Has a nice one finger of a smooth creamy light brown head. There isnt much on the nose but it very malty, similar to a red ale, also has a lot of caramelized dark fruit flavors. Taste is smooth and not as heavy as it looks. A complex malt profile consists of dark fruits and caramel and various spices. This beer drinks rather well for 8.5%. This is a good Scottish ale that I have had before and will likely have again, it wont disappoint."
"O: Surely, I'm no expert on what a wee heavy should taste like - but for what it's worth, this is one of the most drinkable high(er) alcohol beers I've ever had. It's amazing how the complexity doesn't hinder its drinkability, either. Big thumbs up."

"Pours an alluring deep brown color, with a bit of a redness to it. Bone white head recedes to a thin sliver atop the beer but it does adhere to the glass nicely. Barely translucent, some sediment is visible towards the bottom of the glass. Yeast? The aroma is very decadent with a maltiness dominating amongst raisins, pineapple, and maple candy. Taste - wow - very full bodied, yet the alcohol content is undetectable. It begins with a splash of sweetness, then hops rush in with a very nice bitter shot to the palate immediately following. I really like the way it coats the mouth fully and gives me that great warming sensation on the way down. Truly a great beer - I have to start seeking out more Scotch Ales like this!"

"Overall - I would highly recommend this beer to any true beer lover. I gave it to my wife (not a beer lover) and she thought it was horrific, but she also thinks Bud Light Lime is good. This brew is certainly worth your time. Nice big 8.5% ABV, 50 IBU's, good malts, a hit by any measure. Founders brewery strikes again."

"O - Awesome Scotch Ale! Just as they all should be. An awesome extra, please keep the good brews rolling in!!! I would love to try this one again in the future! Founders continues to impress me more and more with each brew I drink."
"Overall (4.0): This is a very nice Scotch Ale—this is not my style usually, but I could see getting into it a bit more with brews like this. It’s like a nice, richer and fuller American Amber with very well-balanced hops. Glad to have tried this beer, and I’d love to try some Backwoods Bastard to see what the barrel aging brings to the malty core of this beer."
""

"O: This is a good beer that provides a simple, pleasant base for the much stronger Backwoods Bastard."
"Overall: I love it. This is a heavenly wee heavy that is practically perfect in every way. I'll take it over any Founder's beer that I have had to date. (Especially over the Backwoods Bastard. I feel saddened that some of this ambrosia should have been sullied in such a way.)"

"O: Very easy drinking and a solid scotch ale. The variety of malts used really give this beer different layers of flavor."
""
""
""
""
"single finger head on a brown and light amber cloudy body. Lots of lacing.Not much head retention. Aroma is a mix of caramel, cocoa, dark fruit and booze. Flavor is more of the same, with caramel and cocoa initially and a nice musty dark fruit finish. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation. Very flavorful scotch ale. One of my least favorite genres but this one is actually pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Why drink this when you could drink Backwoods Bastard? In fact, why bother brewing this unless you are going to barrel age it?"
"Served to me in a 16 oz glass- very dark brown in color with a head of about an inch; retains a small amount of foam with a little lacing. Smells strongly of dark malt with hints of coffee and chocolate. Tastes very much like dark malt with chocolate and maybe a little nip of hops but its very subtle. I'm unfamiliar with this style so it's hard to say what it should taste like but this is a very enjoyable and drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is great- good carbonation and full bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
"Chestnut brown with a off white head. Smells of sweet caramel, peat and a little hoppiness. Tastes of caramel, toffee, and finishes with a nice dry hoppy/grassy/woodsy flavor. A nice dose of smoky peatiness is very prevalent as well along with a nice boozey kick. Slightly viscous with a dry finish. A very nice, rich beer. Founders never dissapoints."
""
"Not one of my favorite beer styles, but this is a good take on it. I'd love to try Backwoods Bastard."
""
"The bottle had a faded stamp but it looked a bit like no. AU++LFE-05/03/11-15:45. Sampled on January 2, 2012. It pours a handsome looking dark amber with a short-lived head that settles to a ring and then nothing. The aroma is like a mild Barleywine with its sweet malty character, some yeast, and bitter hops. The body is of a heavy quality but easily drinkable. Nice strong barley grain malty sweetness with a moderately bitter hoppy ending."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good beer. Strangely lacking in the smell department, but in all other facets it is solid. Goes down fast for an 8.5er."
""

"O - Tasty, drinkable, really only two dimensional with smokey malts and scotch flavors, a very good 2 dimensions but i would have like for this brew to be a bit heavier on the palet. Very good regardless"

"This is one of the more complex wee heavies I've had in a while. Generally, I don't drink a lot of this style but I believe it fits well with my current look and feel of things."
"Poured a cloudy dark brown/brick red with a sudsy, tan half-inch head that quickly breaks up leaving scattered bubbles. The smell is rich, dark fruits and boozy. This is really good. A rich, but clean, malty blend. There is caramel and toffee up front with nutty and smokey flavors following. The dark fruit and yeast play their part as well. A clean aftertaste follows. This brew balances out nicely masking the alcohol well. Moderately carbonated and a creamy, full feel to this Wee Heavy. I'm not picking up on alcohol taste like I did on the aroma. A great wintertime brew and quality all around from Founders."

"Overall a nice beer on a winter night, and a great introduction to the style. As usual, Founders delivers. I don't enjoy it as much as some of their other offerings, but it certainly holds its own and would be perfect after a long day of skiing."
"this is another fine brew from Founders, perfect for this Christmas Eve. Cheers Ya all"
""
"Overall: Truly a great beer. My new baseline for this style"
"Pours a beautiful deep red brown with a nice tan head. The smell is reminds me of a bit of burnt brown sugar and caramel. The taste is very close to the smell with a very nice roasted malt flavor. This beer is viscous and coats the tongue nicely. Scottish type ales are not generally my cup of tea but this one is just fine on this overcast, cool Christmas Eve."
""

""
""
"Pours an chocolate brown. Thick body, not much head, residual bubbles around the sides. Bit of a roasted smell with dark fruit, and faint hops. Taste is very well balanced, black cherry, other dried fruits, sweet cream, and hops to even it out. Creamy, drinkable, smooth. Slides down easily and alcohol content unnoticed."

"Overall a very nice beer."
""

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied with low carbonation; pretty smooth drinking. No alcohol heat, with a malty finish. Overall, very nicely done by Founders, as expected."
"Founders has another winner here. Not as interesting of a brew as it's Mr. Hyde, Backwoods Bastard, but still solid and readily available. I imagine this one is nice on a cool, crisp fall night."
"Poured 12 oz bottle in a snifter. Very cloudy dark iced tea color with very light head. This beer really needs to be served warm! Poured it cold and it had no aroma and very harsh flavor. As I let it warm up the flavors and body began to show up along with some aroma. As expected a malty aroma, very sugary caramel and some bread notes. Heavy sweet taste with slight bitterness. Medium body with a bit thin creamy texture; flat carbonation and long finish. I’m not sure I really like this style of beer based on this selection."

"Sitting at the Whole Foods in Sauganash. Served in a pint glass with an inch and a half of creamy, cafe latte colored head. Smells of butter and malt, pleasant. Not much hops. Tastes of butter again, then the hops. Bitterness, not a lot of citrus. Feels silky on the tongue, big in the mouth. Overall, I like this beer."
"For me, it misses the mark as an enjoyable drinker, but as far as style goes, it's probably an A brew. I'll go with the latter and say that it is pretty spot on as far as style 	description goes."

"Overall, quite good. Definitely a solid scotch ale."

"Overall - Not a bad beer, but not what it is lived up for or costs. Would not buy on any regularity and would choose other Founders beers over this."
""
""
""
""
"An interesting and decent beer, though I'm not sure that it is even remotely with the style. This is certainly a very interesting take on it and it isn't bad by any means."
"Overall: This beer more closely resembles an amber/west coast red if I were left to guess. Too much bitterness for a beer brewed in the notoriously hop-stingy Scottish style. My serving was too cold, which may make for an unfair assessment. I understand the relationship between coldness and the maintenance of many tap handles. Bitterness may be accentuated under these circumstances however. Good beer nonetheless. I'd like to try this from a bottle, and will next chance I get."

"Taste is similar to smell...malty, sweet, raison; with a bit of slight hops. The hops actually separate this from most scotch ales i've had, and for the better. Im usually not a fan of scotch ales, but this is pretty good. High abv, and you can taste it."
""
"Great example of Scotch Ale. Red, sweet, great mouthfeel, nice thick head. Head and shoulders above the vast majority of beers in this style! Strong and sweet so tread lightly or your head will feel like someone whacked you with a bagpipe in the morning!"
"EDIT: this give this style a good name, but unfortunately have had few others that stood out in any way. This is where it's at."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Nothing bad about this beer but, like every other Founders I've had, it's far from the best of the style and pretty one dimensional so I can't find it to be worth going back to."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's a beer that smells better than it tastes. I was expecting more flavor out of this, but there's nothing really offensively wrong with it. I love my Scotch Ales, but I was really expecting more out of this."

"This brew poured out as a nice looking brownish red color. The head is thin and it creamy looking. It leaves a touch of lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has a really nice sweet caramel aromas along with some earthy aromas too. The taste is very nice on this one. The sweetness was really nice and finished with a light bitterness. The mouthfeel of this beer was very smooth with a really nice carbonation to it. Overall it's a damn good beer, Founder's strikes again with yet another really tasty beverage."
""
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Full bodied and has a lasting impression on the tongue, so not one to chug. The alcohol is hidden well by the various flavors in the beer, but there is a lot to try and concentrate on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a solid Scotch Ale, pours semi-thick with a quick fading head, nice dark brown color. Rich caramel flavor with a sweet malt overtone. Definitely above average. A little thin on the body but the ABV isn't noticeable. Finishes smooth and just a hint of dryness. Overall it's a very good scotch ale and worth the price."
""
""
""
"O: Good example of the strong scotch ale style. Like previously mentioned, this beer has a multidimensional malt profile that once you think you figured out, on the next sip you recieve a whole different cascade of tastes, too numerous to mention, and too good to pass up."
""
""
""
""
"I found this beer nice and thick. Full bodied, with carbonation that was just enough to ease it over your tongue. Although I caught a bit of alcohol in the nose, it was not apparent anywhere else in the beer."

"This Scotch Ale is served in a 12 oz bottle and poured into a pint glass. Pours a thick amber brown color, produces a small tan head, average retention and leaves only a small amount of lacing behind. The aroma is full of sweet malt and molasses. Medium bodied beer it starts off with a sweet bread flavor, moves to toasted malt, then finally to spicy bitter rye and then a dry finish. It warms as it goes down...excellent brew to enjoy around a bonfire on cold night. There is an extended aftertaste that is left behind partly warm and partly sour on the back of the tongue. Excellent example of a Scotch Ale- There are not a lot of brewers that try to brew this style so hats off to Founders for another awesome beer."

"O - Displays the maltiness of the style well without being overpowering on either sweetness or alcohol. Hints of a bitter hop balance balance well. The malt flavors are complex in this one - interesting style that I have not experienced much of."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Aside from the aspirin taste, this is great. One of the better scottish ales I've had."

"Taste is malty sweetness up front, followed by earthiness. Not quite the smoky peat found in the Sam Adams Wee Heavy, but some green earthiness."

"I was expecting a bit more viscosity from the body, but it does have a pretty respectable syrupy consistency. The carbonation is thin, yet has sharpness. A finish this dry is going to lead to some swift consumption as well. This is a fantastic beer, and considering 6 packs of these go for less than $10, it will be a common sight in my fridge."

"This was an unexpected addition from a trade gone awesome from tburk and I'm super thrilled to try it. There isn't much wrong with the beer, not that I'm an expert on scotch ales, but I'd definitely get this beer again."
"O- A good wee heavy, but the yeasty esters in the taste are a bit out of balance for me. I prefer the Backwoods Bastard to this."
"Pours very dark umber in color with a thin white head into a ordinary pint glass. Smell is light but of caramel malts, raisins, and alcohol. Tastes of caramel malts, raisins, a little smokey, and some evident barley. Alcohol taste is there in the end and exists through the after taste, along with some raisins and barley. A bit drying and an overall decent beer."
"Complex and powerful; a deep beer. Might rate it even higher if I were a bigger fan of the style but this is clearly an extremely well made and highly nuanced brew. A potent blend of malt goodness, hot booziness, and lasting bitterness."
"o- first time having a scotch ale, pretty satisfied and feel it is a great example, personally too malt forward, though I'm sure that is indicative of the style"
"O - Very good malty brew that I would highly recommend."
"Overall - a very nice Scotch ale. This was my first Founders beer and it's a solid one for sure. I'd like to try more from them, especially their stouts, because they've proven that they can do a good job balancing malt, sweetness, and other flavors."
"O- The 20 months this beer has been aging has definitely improved it. This is substantially better than when it was on tap a few weeks ago at a local bar. A fine example of a wee heavy, and completely worthy of the above average rating im giving it."
"Far from my favorite from Founders, but a solid brew."
"D: Although this one is definitely on the heavy side in terms of body and flavor, the alcohol doesn't come through whatsoever. This is a great brew for the colder seasons."
"One of my first scotch ales, and the first I have reviewed. Cant wait to try its oak ages counterpart..."
"O - Founders' Dirty Bastard has one thing completely right: taste. While the appearance and smell are somewhat lacking, the flavor and mouthfeel of this beer are far and above others that may strive harder just to have a better appearance and smell. If you are lucky enough to have Dirty Bastard on tap at a pub/bar near you, I highly recommend giving it a try. 4.0"
"overall - decent example of the style that I am glad I tried, my only problem was that the finish could be a bit more refined/balanced and less boozy"
"Appearance is DARK and clear. Smell is hoppy and very nice. The mouthfeel is creamy, thick and heavy. The taste is better up front and in the back of the mouth. Bitter start with a slight sweet finish. Overall this is a strong beer in flavor and in ABV. This beer will go well with anything HOT.."
"O: A great tasting beer overall. If I want some great malt character, I'd come back to this one in a heartbeat. Founders did an excellent job on this one."
"O: This is the beer I want on cold wet fall day in Michigan. Gets my malt fix for me every time."
"O: Solid brew."
"Pours a really nice amber with minimal head that recedes quickly. Smell is heavily malty, really caramel with significant sweetness and a touch of booze. Some sweet dark fruits hide on the nose behind the malt and booze with just a touch of citrus hops. Taste is very malt forward, with a touch of roastiness balanced with just enough bitterness. Plenty of sweet dark fruits as the flavor sticks around in your mouth. Carbonation is pretty low which works for this style. It drinks smooth with getting prickly or cloying. Overall a really nice brew, definitely worth checking it out but it won't blow your mind in any particular way."
"O/D-Not one of my favorite Founders brews, but their company is so good that this one still is above average. One of the better Wee Heavys I have had. Good, not great. Alcohol masked well and while it is sweet, its not too sweet (like many others in the style)."
"Overall, a nice wee heavy although I prefer the Innis Gunn to this brew for the style."
"D/O- Perhaps the easiest to attain wee heavy around, at least in the Midwest, this is many craft newbies first of the style. Thankfully it is a solid representation from Founders"
"Overall: Incredibly finished beer I loved it beginning to end. You will get almost everything with this beer, lacking maybe appearance which isn't much since it's going to end up in your stomach. Best of all you can get it year round, this beer is definitely top of my A list and should be on top of yours. Salud!"
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a brownish red, with a half inch of off white head, a little lacing. Smell is of brown sugar, dark fruits, peat, and some hops. Taste is that, very easy drinking, and the balance is wonderful. Really impressed, this is not a style that I seek out, but Founders never let's me down. Nice carbonation and a perfect mouthfeel. Really like this beer, didn't want it to end."
"Overall - Some nice aspects, but I'm not terribly impressed. There are much better examples of this style that have more complexity to the malt character."
"Overall- Scotch ale is not one of my favorite styles, but this one is quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability – The bitterness might scare away a novice drinker but any fans of the style, and especially any lovers of fine scotch, will thoroughly enjoy this effort from Founders."
"Overall: This is a really good beer, and possibly one of my favorites from Founders. Definitely recommend."
"Very much a heavy bodied ale full of characters I might have expected more from stouts, but very nice. Another Founders success."
"O: A decent beer, I remember it tasting a little better than this, but it's not a bad beer just not as complex and interesting as I remember."
"O- great Scottish Ale. Strong taste, great taste for the style, and can knock you on your ass if you haven't had anything to eat, lol."
"Overall, this has all of the characteristics you look for in a scotch ale, the peat smoke flavor, the rich malt and fairly high alcohol. I would have liked a little less herbal hop bitterness or maybe just a little more malt sweetness to balance it but I think this is very true to the style."
"Quite nice and a good choice for sipping on a fall evening."
"The finish is a little weird, but not a bad scotch ale. Glad I had it, but there are better options."
"Overall, a very easy drinking ale, good to sip on throughout the fall like evenings."
"O- Overall this is a solid beer, I ‘m glad I only bought one bottle though, this beer was good to have once but not good enough to revisit IMO, still enjoyed it."
"The beer looks murky rust colored reddish brown. Quite brackish and cloudy. Almost no head. Looks dull and lifeless."
"Pours a deep mahogany and brown color with some garnet hues; develops about a quarter inch of foamy, off-white head that lingers for some time. Patches of wet lacing remain. Smells of caramel, toffee, faint bourbon, some molasses, and a touch of oak (though I don’t think this one is barrel aged). Taste is very similar, with caramel, scotch, vanilla, and some molasses coming through. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is smooth, and finishes only a touch dry. Overall, a very good, highly drinkable scotch ale. I'm very happy I have another to enjoy down the road."
"Overall: Definitely glad I finally bought a bottle of this one to try. I'm a big fan of this style, and Founders' rendition of it is an excellent one!"
"O - Decent beer for the style, would be good with food or standalone."
"Overall: Founders never disappoints. It's like drinking a big fresh loaf of booze soaked yeasty raisin bread-- toasted slightly dark. Don't get the hate this one has received lately. It's spot on for its style, and it requires it not be mocked, ya wee lad! ;-)"
"O- This is a decent Scottish Ale, and I like the strength of malt, but the sugar level on it is just a bit too high. Dial it back, maybe add a bit more hops or peat quality and this could be a true winner."
"while this is a bigger beer it holds it very well. On the fuller and richer side, but well balanced with some power behind it"
"Overall: A very tasty beer but the Scotch Ale style is not my thing so I probably wouldn't seek it out again. With that said, it was a very easy drinking beer. I still want to try the Backwoods Bastard so I will revisit the style again."
"While this is a solid well made beer it really isn't my thing. I can appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into a beer of this quality but the style just isn't one I feel strongly about."
"Cheers!"
"A dark mahogany colored brew with a decent off-white head and similar lacing. The aroma is a beautiful charcoal malt with a hint of buttery licorice. The taste buds detect more charcoal and butterscotch but licorice remains a key ingredient. This stuff is carbonated with fine tingly bubbles that keep this very lively in feel with a solid medium body and some resinous qualities for sure. There is also some booziness present but overall this is a very satisfying scotch ale sort of brew and in true keeping with Founders’ reputation."
"O: Very enjoyable beer that is packed full of flavor. Will definitely drink again."
"Color is a orange-brown, much like iced tea. The tan head is pretty wimpy and fades pretty quickly, with no lacing left on the glass. Dark fruit and alcohol scents are noted in the smell. The malts are prominent in the taste - caramel with a slight smoky flavor. A piney hop bitterness comes through in the finish. Full-bodied and chewy mouthfeel. Nice balance and complexity. Good representative for the style, but not a fit to my preferred tastes."
"O - what a solid beer and makes me want more of the style, aroma was a bit lacking but still there. the only rival that ive enjoyed as much was a year old, Old Chub from Oskar Blues. founders just continues to push to be my number one brewery. well done"
"O: a great representation of the style, really needs to be allowed to warm up before all of the great flavors come out and it really hits the palate right"
"Overall Drinkability - First Founders beer I didn't really care for. I guess there's a first for everything."
"O: One of the few Founders beers I've had that didn't do much for me."
" ~ This is a good scotch ale. While I'm not a huge fan of the style I really think Founders has done yet another fine job of nailing a style and bringing to folks that may otherwise neglect its existence."
"Overall an extremely tasty brew with the alcohol flavor kept to a minimum, yet still allowing for a nice warming sensation after the swallow."
"Rich, full-bodied with a light effervescence. Creamy, warming, smooth. Seriously good beer."
"Purchased a six pack of bottle at the local grocery store for 9.99. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a medium dark brown with a half inch of thick sticky head. Stick your nose in the glass and you are greeted with a wonderfully complex medley of smells. Biscuity malt and earthy peat are balanced with vanilla. The flavor is equally complex, and frankly, wonderful. It starts with the maltiness, but finishes with the smoky peat and alcohol of good scotch. The smokiness lingers. Overall, an exceptional complex standout. Definately worth picking up!"
"Fresh 8/11 from the cooler. Pours out a nice dark ruby color with a sticky looking head. The smell is rich and malty, slightly smokey, and mildly sweet, with some vanilla almost reminiscent of a fine Bourbon. Really a complex smelling beer. The taste is equally rich and malty, but has a nice citric, resinous hop base to balance it all out. Nice warming alcohol as you sip this one and it works well on a cool night like tonight. More flavors are coming forth, a bit of molasses from all that alcohol, but also some nicely roasted malts. Sure, there is a bit of earthy peat to it, but not nearly as much as some scotch ales I've had and I like it. Anyway, this is a big beer, one to be sipped and slowly warmed and the mouthfeel is pretty smooth too. Overall this is a nice Scotch ale that is making a great alternative right now to the shelves full of tired, but true Oktoberfest offerings."
"Overall a fantastic offering from Founders. Interesting style I dont find myself drinking enough of. This is my second time purchasing Dirty Bastard and I will definitely be looking for it during the cold Chicago winter."
"O - definitely one of the best scotch ales out there. get this beer if you haven't already."
"O - Absolutely the best scotch ale I've had. I've never been disappointed by Founders. I ate some M&Ms while drinking the dirty bastard; it was a great pairing!"
"It pours a light brown color, almost like the darkest iced tea you've ever had. The flavor is very complex with a ton of different malt flavors going on. There is roastedness, piney, hoppy, a little bit of not very sweet maple, even a hint of scotch. It's very bold and has a long bitter, but not acrid, finish."
"O - Delicious! At times the taste resembled a Rochefort 6 (less smooth). First beer I've had from Founders, not disappointed!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep, dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and caramel ,a touch of alcohol. Taste is malty, nutty, some caramel, alcohol is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"I remember back when this was Founders flagship. Haven't had it in years, but it's quite the dram for the end of the night."
"O: drinkable for a few beers, I'd need to switch it up if I had more than 2. This is another one of those awesome founders beers that is $10 or less for a 6 pack, and that's a steal for this one."
"12oz bottle: This one pours a cloudy, coppery amber color. There was a very small light brown had on it that didn’t linger or leave much lacing at all. Big nose of roasted caramel. Definitely raisins and a hint of smoke in there also. Very nice taste. It is smokey and a little bitter. Then you get some of that roasted caramel with a bit of sweetness popping thru. Faint dark fruits to the taste also. Nice."
"O: A unique, fantastic beer that I could enjoy in sparing amounts. I truly felt one 12 oz bottle was perfect, any more and it would have been too much."
"Overall: This is a very fine ale that is packed with toasty malt and scotch flavor while still remaining very smooth."
"O - Overall... I like this, gotta get more. This has some very nice characteristics going on that I really like. I could drink this like eating candy, can never get enough! THUMBS UP! Thanks Dave!"
"O - I think the whole is greater than the sum of its parts with this one. Or maybe the alcohol content has caught up to me at the end of this review and I am an easy grader. It is an enjoyable brew, not something I would drink a bunch of at once, but overall glad I tried this."
"O: This is a great beer overall. Complex, intriguing and not quite like any other scotch I've had."
"Not my favorite beer style, but this is clearly a good example of it. Malty, but balanced. ABV is almost entirely masked. Avoids the smoked malt that too many American brewers of Scottish ales insist on using. Well done, fans of Old Chub and Claymore are sure to love Dirty Bastard."
"O--This is a great scotch ale. It may actually be my favorite. I'm not normally a scotch ale kind of guy, but Dirty Bastard helped me appreciate it."
"Prosit!"
"1359"
"I'm no expert in scotch ales but this beer is delicious! Rich mouthfeel, but not tacky sweet. I can't analogies the taste to any single other flavor, but it's a balanced toasty caramalized deliciousness. It's not too thick or strong that it can't be enjoyed in hot weather. I usually avoid ports and stouts in the hot summer months of Virginia, but I have no problem enjoying this brew on an August night. The abv is high, but its not too noticeable on the palate."
"Not my favorite style in the world, but I really enjoyed this beer. Yet another example of why Founders beers continues to find themselves in my fridge."
"Tried the Dirty Bastard from Founders. The appearance was rich reddish amber color slightly cloudy with decent tan head with some lacing. Smell was sweet from probably molasses and some roast. Taste was dominated by alcohol. There is an attempt to balance the beer with sweet malt and roast. The mouthfeel was downgraded due to teh alcohol bite. this is not a session beer for the timid. This beer has fortitude and gusto. Worth a try if you like the Wee Heavies."
"I would be willing to purchase again just to get out of the usual trend of beers that I try."
"Not too sweet, not too syrupy, not too thin, not too hopped up - this wee heavy is juuust right! Wow, from the first whiff, this offering has proven to be a study in restrained plaid-clad fury - and tasty as fish and chips in seaside Aberdeenshire..."
"O- A good beer overall, but being from CT, I'd gladly take Wet Willy over this, but would buy it again if I see it out of state."
"O: A bit sweeter than I prefer, but not offensive. I would also prefer more complexity, possibly more smokiness and bitterness to balance the sweetness. I'd put this at a solid B. The best aspect of this brew is its ability to hide the alcohol. The 8.5%ABV is totally masked by the sweetness."
"This is one of many times I've had this beer, tonight in a bottle, but many times on tap. It is the best wee heavy I have had to date, I love as it warms up, the booziness creeps out ever so slightly, but just as smooth as can be at the same time. If you think Dirty Bastard is good, you have to try its big brother Backwoods Bastard."
"This is totally delicious ale, bursting with flavor. As it warms the malt, hop, and 8.5% ABV become very distinctive, but also harmonious and balanced. As always with their dark offerings Founders has another winner here. One to buy by the case."
"Overall a very nice brew."
"Great subtle flavor, and a nice nose. Glad I got to try it at this point in it's maturity. I've had it fresh before too and can tell you that aging it certainly does meld together some of the sweeter flavors and kicks out some of the alcohol in the flavor. Another good one from Founders, and year round to boot."
"Not too much carbonation present, but the bitterness and booziness encourages slow drinking. I'm glad I got to try this but it doesn't seem like one I would order two of in a given night."
"This is a solid, well-done example of the style. Founders makes some quality brews and they do not disappoint me with this one. Definitely wouldn't mind having access to Dirty Bastards all the time."
"The is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. This is quite a bold brew but fittingly so for the style. If the mineral flavors were worked out of this I would have enjoyed it much more. Overall not bad with that 8.5% hitting fairly hard. Worth a try for sure."
"Admittedly, this is not one of my favorite styles, but it is a good rendition of it."
"O: Really fun beer. It seems like a great representation of this style. A great beer that I would go back to and be very happy. Be careful if you have more than one though because it may sneak up on you."
"O - This hopped-up version of a scotch ale may have a hard time striking a balance between sweet and bitter, but it's still amazingly flavorful and a pleasure to drink!"
"Pours a cloudy brick-red. Nice, unique caramel/toffee-colored head/ring. Smell is all sweet caramel. Taste is a ton of toffee with a bit of mineral. Clean & lightly nutty. Sort of like peanut brittle as beer. Enough bitters to satisfy. Dry finish. Very clean brew. Good!"
"O: Good beer, slightly better than I remember it perhaps. I quite like Founders, and this beer is no exception. Not exceptional perhaps, and not one for regular drinking, but a full-bodied well-spiced winter sort of beer. I would recommend it, even if it's a while before I have another."
"I found a case of this at Kunda Beverage in King of Prussia. Another strong beer. This poured a beautiful reddish brown, with a nice thick two-finger head at the top which hung around for a pretty substantial period of time. Real smooth beer, yet it still had a fairly pronounced alcohol profile that gave it a tad of bite. I would have to imagine this is much better suited as a fall or winter beer, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless."
"O-a nice Scotch style ale"
"My first Founders beer. Dark coffee color with a decent smell with some hops and sweetness like molasses. Good carbination and a dark malt taste and just a hint of hops. I wasn't that crazy about the beer, but the alcohol was hidden fairly well for 8.5% abv. For the style it was good."
"I've had this beer before and never had the soapy experience I had this night. I will try this beer again, probably from a bottle, as Founder's rarely disappoints."
"Ridiculously casual overall for the usual north of 8%er. I'd order this on tap somewhere if I could - then have someone else drive home."
"O: A very complex and robust Americanized Wee Heavy indeed, Founders Dirty Bastard is a deep, decadent brew to sit down with on a cold autumn night. Although, I enjoyed it just fine on a balmy summer night, too. The 8.5% ABV is heady indeed, but there is a fine balance amidst the chaos."
"Medium-bodied mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Drank pretty well.. personally, I liked it. Haven't had many Wee Heavy/Scotch Ales, besides DdC Equinoxe du Printemps, so it's a delightful, new style for me. I hope to experience more in the near future."
"O- Not a huge scotch ale guy, but this is a good one. The blend of sweet, roast, spice, and hops make this a very well balanced beer. You would never know this is 8.5%."
"This is an extremely flavorful brew, with nice balance and real assertiveness in all sensory respects. It surprised me with its creamy sweetness, and then it surprised me with its smokey bitterness. What's great is that it moves so effortlessly between its flavors. Definitely a well-crafted ale that's worth a purchase."
"overall a great beer to share with your friends and enjoy over and over again"
"O: Pretty tasty, and probably a shoe in over oskar blues' old chub, the only other scotch ale I've ever had. Might warm up to this style."
"O - I am not gonna be drinking many of these in one night. Nonetheless, a very nice beer."
"Overall, not a bad brew. I think it just didn't quite live up to it's potential. I think it could be better by lowering the attenuation (i.e. lowering the alcohol, but increasing the sugars left in the beer)."
"D: Good interpretation of the style."
"Overall not a bad beer. Wish it was a little sweeter for the style. once again just not my favority style."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew were the malts and the smokiness they impart in both the aroma and taste. The aroma is muted at first, but blossoms into a rich mixture exemplary for the style. It does, however, suggest that the flavors will bring a bit more sweetness. This is not to say that we were let down, but rather that it gives a little bit of a surprise when you take that first sip."
"O - I've loved Founders for so long and have always skipped on this offering because I was not a ""malt"" guy. Today I have been sold on this beer. I will be picking this up as often as Red Rye PA from now on."
"Overall-I may have to go back and do a side by side with a few scotch ales. This beer was very complex, alot going on. This review is subject to change for the positive here in the next few weeks."
"Overall- Another amazing beer from a truly amazing brewery, I have not to this day tried a Founders brew that I did not like. On the scale of amazing founders brew I would probably place this one somewhere in the middle but compared to a lot of others it is right at the top. This would definitely be a go to for me when searching for beers in Michigan, and I would actually love to have this one again, good thing it is a regular offering from Founders."
"O: not a bad beer. Wish it was a little sweeter for the style. I can see why so many love this beer. Just not my cup."
"D - Not too bad, there is a lot of complex sugar character and the aroma is really very nice. Some of the dark sugar in the flavor profile is accompanied by a musty note that may be diacetyl or possibly even cardboard. In addition to that slightly unpleasant note it has a touch of alcoholic warmth that is, perhaps, understandable considering the strength but kind of messes with the smoothness that I would really like to see in this sort of beer. Overall it is a pretty good beer, but falls a bit below the average for Founders and I have a hard time seeing myself drinking it again."
"O: Very drinkable for 8.5% and would definitely go for again. If anything it comes through slightly sweeter than I would like however it is brewed to style and delicious."
"O: Great ScotchAle, was very surprised by this one even though Founder's is fantastic all around!"
"Pours a very dark amber/maroon with about a finger of very light orangish head. Retention is OK, with decent lacing. Smell is rich caramel and malts; a little dark fruit (raisin) as it warms. The aroma is kind of muted, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Taste is more caramel, brown sugar, and malt, but the finish is mostly a not-so-pleasant hop bitterness. Carbonation is on the light end (not bad for the style, I guess), maybe a little lighter than I'd prefer. Medium bodied and a little hot on the finish. Overall, this is not bad, but I was expecting more after enjoying Backwoods Bastard."
"12oz bottle thanks to Auroracrisis. This was probably my least favorite Founder's beer to date. The color was a turbid and murky brown, scant head. Smell was slightly malty but faint. The taste was spot on for the style but just didn't wow me. Sure it's malty but I'd rather have anOld Chub any day of the week."
"Notes: This offering from Founders is dam tasty nicely sweet with bit's of bitterness. Cheers."
"O: overall a good beer, one of Fonders best brews I have tried thus far. Fair price (but not an everyday beer). I will probably buy it again when I’m looking for a higher priced relaxing beer."
"Poured a murky, dark crimson-brown, with a small off-white head that disappeared very quickly. Smell is of rich malts and pine. Taste is similar, with a rich malt base overlaid with pine and peat, moderately smokey, with hints of indistinct fruit and spice. Relatively low alcohol, but still had quite a sharp boozy kick, with a dry and bitter finish. On the heavy end of being medium-bodied, smooth and creamy, complex, and very drinkable."
"O-My favorite scotch ale out there so far. Founders really needs to to distribute to Upstate NY."
"D- Sits a bit heavy. 3 max."
"keep around."
"Definitely the tastiest Scotch Ale I've ever had."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 05/10/11. Pours a dark brownish ruby color with a half inch of head. Zero lacing. Smells sweet with some malt, booze, raisin and berry aromas. Taste is a sllightly boozey, malty sweetness. A hint of smoke. Somewhat medicinal at the end but its not too bad. Its a decent Wee Heavy but the medicine taste is now starting to get to me more. Still a good beer. Overall, I'd buy it again but a 6 pack would take me a while to finish."
"Overall: This is a beer I do not care for. I find it hard to drink, unappetizing, too sweet and heavy. The Scotch Ale department is one that seems to have a hard time producing outstanding ales and, while Dirty Bastard is better than, say, Oskar Blues Old Chubb, it still is far from a superb brew."
"O: Rich and tasty, quite easy to drink"
"o: not bad...don't know that I'd grab it again though as there are other beers I'd rather sit back and relax with. Glad I tried it, though. Nice sweetness to it but really lacks that 'pop' of a flavor. the malt is there at the front, but I would have like a bit more pop from it all. Given what it is...not too bad, but there are other Founders brews I'd rather go with and other similar beers I like better given the flavor profile."
"Overall, a very nice beer. I am not a fan of the style at all in general, but this one made me appreciate how good scotch ales can be when done well."
"I haven't had too many Scotch ales that I've enjoyed - I tend to find the style too malty for my taste, but this one strikes a very good balance."
"Pours a murky dark brownish red with a small 1/2 inch beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. A little bit of ring lacing forms on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits like raisins, malts, and alcohol. Maybe some light caramel aromas. Taste is of some malt flavors up front with some caramel and raisin like flavors on the finish. A bit of roasted malt bitterness after each sip. Mild carbonation makes for a smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this a a good beer all around. I think this is the first beer of this style I have tried. Not one of my favorite styles but I would try others in the category in the future."
"O: Damn good scotch ale. Its sweet but somehow keeps it in check with enough bready flavors. Worth a try."
"Overall - This has been one of my go-to beers recently (especially in the colder months), while I typically gravitate to IPA's and bolder Hefeweizens in the warmer ones. I really enjoy this beer alot, very satisfying for those who like the flavor of dark fruits, molasses and malts, and still some hop gratification at the end of the sip - really a great, complex beer with a wonderful progression of flavors and nuances in every sip. I definitely recommend this beer. At 8.5% ABV it may not be very sessionable, but 2 of these is a really nice way to end an evening."
"Overall a really great beer."
"O: There is certainly a good and bad way to sample this beer. In the bottle, you'll find a funny-tasting dark ale; on-tap, you will get a brew that yells at you in a crazy Scottish accent, picks a fight with your senses, then pummels you to the ground. In other words, it's just what you expect from Founders: bold flavor."
"O: My first wee heavy, but I enjoy this beer quite a bit. Matches the style notes quite well, and would be a great beer during the winter months."
"O - An excellent Scotch Ale, probably the best when availability and price are factored in. Another great Founders offering!"
"A very creamy red beer. Gorgeous ruby in color with superb head and lacing. Very malty smell. Sugary, raisin and malty flavor that mix very smooth. Nice creamy texture with a bitter bite. A nice complex and balanced brew. Will try it on a crisp cool autumn day."
"I don't have a lot of experience with Scotch Ales, but I enjoyed this beer and would buy it again."
"Pours a beUtiful copper color with a small head. The smell is heavy caramel, and other sweet fruits. The taste hits strong with the caramel up front, then gives way to some hoppy bitterness. The beer is medium bodied and it's a joy in your mouth. Was my first wee heavy but love the style now, this still may be my favorite."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is chewy, carbonated, warming, and coating. The body of the beer is thick and the finish is medium full. This is a really good scotch ale has a lot of character well made. I would however like to see the beer have some more peat to to and a bit chewier."
"overall - great example of style - 2nd only to NEBCO wet willy."
"O: a decent brew that I'm sure many others will swoon over. I'm always willing to sample a Founders brew -- even of styles I don't particularly love -- and Dirty Bastard is a great example why."
"D - Very nice ,lots going on as you taste through the brew."
"The beer is very easy to drink, balance of carbination and smooth creaminess. The alocohol is there but its more mellow than anything. Overall another fantastic beer from Founders. I'm glad that this one is easy to find becuase I would definatly like to pick this one up from time to time."
"Medium to light mouthfeel that does remiind one of a scotch. Quite an interesting brew and another solid offering from Founders."
"O: Quite drinkable overall. I've just recently started drinking more Scotch Ales and this one definitely comes to the top of the list in terms of ""buy again""s."
"I had heard a lot of hype for this beer and the rumors were true. It was amazing."
"There's no mistaking the high alcohol, but it's a relatively smooth drink for 8.5% ABV. It does lack some flavor, but it's still a good beer."
"M – Medium / full body coats your mouth without being overly syrupy. Sweet, brown-sugar finish."
"Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured dark brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, and very slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The flavor on this one was slightly complex and very well balanced. Very nice aroma going on here as well that keeps you coming back for more. A great brew for the style and a definite must try for anyone out there."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with one finger of off white head. Gentle smoky aroma mixed with alcohol and some dark fruits. Taste is a little spicy from the alcohol with the malts and smokiness being present as well. Mouthfeel is appropriate, smooth, medium bodied, and lightly carbonated. Overall a very good beer that I enjoy whenever I have the chance."
"Overall: If not for the heat, I'd say it was sessionable. Tasty, good smell, light on the palate. Good to drink, but I suspect the 8.5 heat will keep me from drinking more than 1-2."
"Overall: An excellent beer; a beautiful colour, very balanced flavour, and just a pleasure to drink. One of the more interesting scotch ales I've had."
"I'm very partial since I just made a batch of wee heavy, so I'm not really impressed. The malty flavor is not as strong as I feel it should be, although it does have a nice finish. While it's a decent wee heavy, I would hope next years batch would so more flavor."
"This pours like a really dark piece of bloodwood with a light khaki head that's two fingers tall and leaves big, chunky lace on the way down. On the nose there are caramel and toasted malts set against a definite background of alcohol. There are sooty and earthy notes here, almost like spent oil poured on a pile of leaves. In the mouth there is a large base of the caramel and toasted notes from the nose, but also some dark fruits come out. Buckeyenation said bourbon soaked figs and I think that accounts for both the dark fruit and the alcohol, which seems like it's there by design rather than by mistake. The body is full and the finish is long but conspicuously absent from the back part of the tongue, I guess due to the absence of notable bitterness. I like this beer a good deal, perhaps not a staple but something that is very good and easily enough had on tap when I'm at home in Michigan."
"O: Love Founders. Enjoy this style after not liking it much initially."
"Overall: This is a beer I will buy again and thoroughly enjoy drinking. I'm more of a porter or stout drinker, not a fan of Scotch ale, but this is a good one. A great beer to sip while grilling a nice Porterhouse steak."
"Overall- I think this might be one of the best beers I have ever had. I'm not really even particularly fond of the style. Something about the understated balance and underlying craftsmanship of this brew has struck a chord with me. I actually think I feel this way about almost all of the beers I have tasted from Founders."
"D-OVerall this is a Great beer. This style is quickly becoming one of my favorites. This beer has tons of flavor but nothing is overpowering. Just a solid complex but well balanced beer. can't wait to try more from this style!"
" Grade A- Purchased at Stoney's -- $10.99 per 6-pack"
"Overall, this is very nicely done. Not too big or boozy, yet rich enough to let you know you're enjoying something special. Fruity, but not sickeningly sweet. The bitterness balances this well. I might not be able to drink a lot of them, but I'd not turn 'em down, either."
"D. A rather nice interpretation of a Scotch style ale but lacks something that McEwan's No1 ale has."
"Full bodied with slight carbonation, this beer is thick and slightly sticky. It coats your mouth just enough to allow the booze warmth to last properly."
"D - Overall much too bitter and full of roast and coffee notes that are not part of the traditional style. I appreciate the smoke, but the rest is too much of a culture clash from what I'm expecting."
"O-A seriously good example of the style and yet another notch on Founder's belt."
"From the bottle to a pint glass. Pours a cloudy caramel brown with a moderate whitish head. Decent lacing. Smells of caramel/toffee, malts and a hint of alcohol. Taste is full and robust - notes of malt, slightly burnt, toffee, with a mild somewhat sweet hop bite. Slightly chewy mouth. I love the style and this is a great version of a wee-heavy."
"This one is complex, strong, and beautiful. A powerhouse ale, both unique and delicious."
"Overall, not my favorite beer from Founders, but it is a very complex beer that I could see myself drinking every now and then. Definitely at least worth a taste!"
"O- Just too boozy to be very drinkable. This is the first beer I've had from Founders that disappointed me. This drinks more like a hard liquor than a beer with the booziness and burning effect. The alcohol is too prominent in this beer to the detriment of everything else going on with it. This is much boozier than Russian Imperial Stout's and Barleywines I have had. More flavor characteristics came out as the beer warmed quite a bit, but by then I was over this beer."
"Carbonation is perfect. Mouthfeel is very smooth, almost creamy. Perfect carbonation. The failry high ABV% isn't noticeable at all, a definite plus. A solid beer and glad I got to try it via trade but not something I would purchase if Founders were available around here."
"O- Great scotch ale thats deliciously sweet and candylike."
"12 oz. pry off bottle from the fridge storage at Penguin Pizza, Boston MA. Pours cloudy ultra viscous brown color, w/ off white head. Low head retention most likely due to the high ABV. Intense caramel and yeast aroma, w/ barleywine-esk boozy beer smell. Tastes similar to the aroma: caramel maltiness, slight roastiness, very full mouthfeel along with high alcohol content. Interesting sip, it's growing on me. Not my favorite from the company. But well described as dirty bastard. Its a dirty brown looking beer with high inebriation potential."
"O-This is my first time trying this style, It's certainly not my new favorite, but after this bottle I'm willing to try it again some day."
"Overall/notes: I've had this review written for a long time, but drinking it again reminded me that I was member here. Watched Blade Runner, ate an apple-crisp granola bar, and thoroughly enjoyed all three. You should do the same!"
"o-when trying a new ale theres not a risk with founders brewing...you like the style or not.i enjoy scotch ale, this is perfect while grilling ribbs...easy drinking, great taste!"
"O: One of the best American brewed Scotch ales out there"
"O- Like I said, a great beer for it's price."
"Really solid beer, very malty and sweet. Another solid Founder's brew."
"D - I've had a couple Scotch ales and have to say I'm not into this style, the sweetness combined with somewhat ""sharp"" hops isn't for me. That said, this is a quality brew for sure, and for fans of the style I'd say it's on point."
"O: Surprisingly good. I'm not sure why I was surprised, but absolutely loved this beer. Might be because I don't have a ton of scotch ale tastings to compare to. I could drink this fast and often."
"This one is an interesting take on the style. It's a very good beer regardless, but be careful: the ABV doesn't seem as high as it is."
"I'm not always sure what comprises a Scottish ale, but I enjoyed this one. It has the rich malts of a dopple, nuttiness of a nut brown, and a pretty big kick."
"O: Really nice beer, lots of great flavor. No hint of the alcohol whatsoever and very drinkable."
"O- Truly enjoyed this beer. Very nice and well balanced given the abv and malt complex. The hop profile is a plus."
"O: This is very mild for its strength and it needs to be drank between 50-60 degrees to get anything out of it. On the plus side, it is only about $10 bucks per sixer and goes down easily for being 8.5% ABV."
"D: A nice interpretation of the style; a very drinkable beer that does get a bit cloyingly sweet toward the end of the glass but is enjoyable nonetheless"
"O: Overall a very good beer. I think it would be even better and closer to style if they reduced the bitterness a wee bit."
"O - another job well done by founders. Not a bad choice for a wee-heavy session because it doesn't wear you out but it can definitely sneak up on you if you reach for another."
"Bravo Founder's!!"
"This beer is a deep mahogany and pours with about a quarter inch of head which dissipates to a film quickly. There is very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is nice, with a lot of caramel sweetness and maybe a bit of toffee. There is also a bit of alcohol in the aroma. The flavor is the same as the aroma, but curiously the alcohol is a bit more masked and there is a bit of a chocolate flavor as well with a mild clean bitterness to back up the extremely malty character. Good medium mouthfeel and pretty good drinkability. Good enjoyable beer."
"Waited quite awhile to try this brew, glad I finally did. It would be perfect in my opinion if it had some peat malt smokiness, I really like this style to do that."
"The presence of high ABV would prevent me from drinking more then say two at any one sitting."
"Overall; something you should drink during a special occasion, great brew. loved it. good for a cool day rainy and such its nice"
"Good stuff."
"D - Overall I was very pleased with my first beer from Founders. I would have this one again if offered."
"D: Drinkability improved as I moved down the glass. Started out feeling a bit discordant, but as it warmed up a bit, the flavors smoothed out, the peaks and valleys evened, and it went down quite nicely. Recommend letting it warm to ~50-55 degrees before drinking."
"D - Great Scotch style beer. It is not my personal favorite style but they have done a great job with it. No surprises."
"D: Drinkability suffers due to the sweetness, especially in the throat after swallowing- almost to the point where it feels like I've just swallowed some seriously sweetened medicine. But, aside from the throat sugar burn, it's pretty easy to drink, and the alcohol is well hidden."
"The CPJ"
"This one pours a very dark ruby that is almost completely opaque. There is a fingers worth of a cream colored head with foamy lacing. The nose offers burnt caramel malts with some roasted malt as well. a bit boozey after a long whiff. The taste is of butterscotch up with some roasty malts. A well blended biscuit flavor is noticed right before the 8.5% is noticed. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation, creating a smooth feel. Because this brew is very smooth and tasty, with a well hidden ABV, downing many of this will not be an issue. Drink UP!"
"This beer and Old Chub are my 2 favorite Scotch Ale beers."
"Overall pretty good. Nice beer to open the night."
"Overall- This is a beer that I can never seem to walk away from. Whenever I go to Binnys I always find myself staring at it. I always want to walk out of binnys with beers I have never had but this one always seems to land in my basket."
"With a name like Dirty Bastard, I was expecting a more aggressive flavor. The flavor was great. It did have subtle complex flavors, but I wanted something more nitty gritty."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a dimpled glass mug. Pours a cloudy dark red with a nice tan head leaving thin lacing throughout. Aromas of alcohol, toffee, and bread. Taste is very malty...complex with alcohol noted up front, brown sugar, bread, sugar, caramel, maybe cocoa and toffee coming in later on. A dense palate with a heavy and thick mouthfeel. Decent carbonation throughout the session. Very nice long finish that keeps changing. This is a very nice, complex brew. One of the better Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy styles I've had."
"Overall: I enjoy it, and will be looking for more Scotch ales. I'm glad there is something in this style easily available."
"Beer is thin to medium in body and a little sweet with a mild bitterness at the finish. Easy drinking and smooth throughout. I was expecting a higher volume on the flavor but I guess that's what I get for having only had the barrel-aged version of the beer previously. I enjoyed it and would have it again."
"This is a very solid scotch ale with maturity and complexity. I'm looking forward to aging this beer!"
"The beer appears dark brown, with crimson hues evident when held to the light. The beer arrives with a half inch of head that generates some decent lacing as it recedes. The beer is slightly smoky, with a sweet malt character evident in both the aroma and flavor. A subtle roast aspect contributes to the flavor profile, and a surprising hop bitterness in the back adds the finishing touch. The feel is medium bodied, with a healthy level of carbonation. A good, but not great, example of the style. I'd drink it again."
"D: Wow! I think this is my first Scotch Ale and it is great. Easy to drink and great mouthfeel. Great show of different malt profiles blending well. Can't hardly detect the higher abv."
"Looks great a very deep amber color with a finger and a half head. As I drink it it laces the glass very well. There is a good full body malt to the smell then some hops come through not very citrusy. Taste is good fairly malty with a subtle hint of hops the bitterness leaves the palette very quickly. It has a good mouth feel with good carbonation and a medium body. I could drink a good amount of this the 8.5% is very well hidden."
"Good beer over all I have had this on draft a few times and have enjoyed it more. I will get this beer again."
"D: A nice sipping beer, nice complex Scotch Ale. Would cerrtainly seek this out again."
"This beer in my opion is awesome, even better as it warms up! I highly recommend this malt bomb."
"D- Looks the part and has a nice aroma. Malt flavour is one dimensional and the hop presence is too strong for the style (this makes it very apparent its an American take on the style - albeit thats not a bad thing) Ill mark it down on flavour due to the hop presence although it was well balanced which is unusual for this style. Overall an interesting beer with alcohol well hidden albeit not true to style. A scottish ale with an American twist aka hops!"
"Nice thick head of tan froth. Dark and coppery, clear. Really nice, butterscotch aroma. Coffee flavor is pronounced. Some smoke. A little sharp bite, might be the alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little oily. Overall good drinkability for a higher abv, and good flavor."
"Drinkability was just fine for the style."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark red with a thick, long lasting, frothy reddish head and good amount of lacing. Aroma is of bready malt and cherry. Medium, creamy, smooth body. Bready, caramel malt is balanced on the palate by some earthy hops and dark chocolate. Long, dry finish. Delicious brew."
"Overall, a good drinker, but not nearly as complex as most of Founders other offerings, in fact I would go as far to say this is my least favorite of their beers, which only adds to the fact that Founders doesn't make a bad beer in my humble opinion (considering I still enjoyed it) least none that I have had."
"A reddish beer, which is plus. Smell of Cherries and whiskey. Taste is strong, but unique. Mouthful speaks for itself . I good crisp feeling of Cherries, whiskey and a tad of caramel. Drinkability is only average because of the higher alcohol content. This beer is definitely worth trying."
"Overall: A great beer overall. Not quite A+."
"D - This drink is just a little too boozy for me to say it is a beer I'd like to have several of in a night. Not necessarily my cup of beer... but still another exceptional example of the style from Founders."
"This is so-so, get if you're a scotch ale fan, but I'd pass in the future."
"D- Very good beer, but I find myself thinking what kind of beer do I want next rather than I'm having another one of those."
"D - Fairly drinkable. Very rich beer and a lot of flavors going on. Thankfully, the flavors are well balanced are work very well together. Not a beer to gulp down, and with the high abv (8.5 %) it is a very enjoyable beer at a bit of a slower pace."
"Very easy to drink despite the 8.5% alcohol. You really only feel it in the swallow and it's not overpowering, so I'll have no reservations about opening a second one."
"D- Drinkability is medium to low. This is a sipper, however it is good."
"After pouring into a pint glass, there was about a fingers' width of a head, which slowly dissipated. There was a nice malty aroma. The texture was smooth. Caramel highlights the taste. For me, this is an ale that needs to be slowly drank for maximum enjoyment."
"D: This is one amazing wee heavy. A bit too rich for more than one, but you'd certainly like another."
"Poured a 2"" tan head which took a while to dissipate to 1/8"". Dark clear burnt umber brown color. Smell is caramel. Rich taste has hints of coffee, malt, and a medium body. Really very easy drinking with nothing to offend. My only complaint is I'm not sure what makes this a ""dirty bastard", it is not strong or harsh or unusual enough to match the name. But good beer."
"This beer is a deep copper color with a slight tan-head. It's quite clear, with a low carbonation. The aroma is intensely malty and caramel-like, with a sweet quality. It's an enticing beer, although it's also got a little more hop aroma than a traditional Scottish ale. The taste is similar in that it has a firm bitterness and hop presence. The malt, though, is the centerpiece. Caramel, toast, earthy, sweet...nice. Medium in body, with a solidly bitter finish. Yum."
"Overall, one of the first Scotch ales I've really liked and the first wee heavy I've had to date. It was good and I would recommend giving this beer a try if it was available to you. Cheers!"
"Overall I would recommend this without any reservations. My second favorite Scotch Ale."
"Overall impression: Great stuff, highly recommended."
"Taste has a good deal of smokiness and malt, very nutty overall. More of a porter than a scotch ale in my opinion, lacking the sweetness and the caramel nature I've come to expect. Overall there is an overbalance of hops to malt for a scotch ale, but that doesnt make this a bad beer by any means at all. Light medium body, and a decent drinkability."
"D; Would drink another"
"Overall - Delicious. The balance of sweet and bitter is very nice. The taste was just very full and robust, I really appreciated it. Bravo, Founders"
"Medium/Heavy body smooth but lingering bite from the alcohol."
"Chad"
"D - Couldn't drink too many considering the bitterness. However I realize that is customary for this style of beer. Reminds me of a good IPA with a nice complex taste."
"Another nice drinkable beer from Founders."
"The low IBUs make this beer very smooth and not too heavy. The scotch style ale is not always and favorite but this one has a mild enough flavor to feel just right and be very drinkable. The color is a deep dark brown almost black. Suprisingly the smell is plain. The Dirty Bastard tastes pretty darn good. Overall this is a solid and good beer if you like a smooth and mild (for scotch ale standards), yet strong scotch ale."
"Impression: So glad Founders is here in NY State. This beer is crafted beautifully, is delicously drinkable and refreshing for a big beer. Get this if you see it."
"D: One bottle is good."
"D: Could definitely drink a couple of the these in a sitting but not much more"
"D -- A solid offering, even though I expected quite a bit more peat smoke on the tongue. A good purchase for fans of the style, well rounded."
"Drinkability: I could do it again and probably will, but not all night long."
"D: Great sipping brew on a cold winter night. Good example of the style."
"D: Very drinkable, but I wouldn't put this one down too quickly. Definitely quite enjoyable"
"Not bad, but the malt complexity wavers, faced with strong, one-dimensional roastiness."
"I didn't think I'd like this beer all too much, but damn do I like this beer a lot!"
"I am actually re reviewing this because I've had this with a cleaner palate without tasting another beer (Backwoods) before hand. My grade is definitely too low on this for this one, and I found other things on it after trying it again without tasting it's Backwoods cousin first. I could drink this no problem anytime."
"D: Admittedly, this is not my favorite style in the world, but I do truly love the bourbonized version of this one, ""Backwoods Bastard."""
"This beer is quite enjoyable. I don't believe I have rated one out of the bottle yet, but I have had several six packs. It was great to have it on tap."
"D. While there is nothing offensive about this beer, there is nothing memorable either. On a positive note, the 8.5% ABV is well hidden."
"This brew feels full, but a bit on the flat side. Complex, but a good warmer on a winter day. Not sure I'd have more than a few."
"Smells ok and for the first couple of seconds after sipping it actually tastes pretty darn good - smooth and creamy - chocolaty! But immediately after that, it left a real nasty-paint-thinner-like-vinegary after taste. Couldn't finish bottle - I was VERY disappointed and decided to stick with mojitos the rest of the evening (Christmas Eve). Just for kicks, I decided to give it another shot today - no change - starts out super delicious to the palate, but finishes with a super vinegary bitter bite which literally makes you shake your head and wonder ""WTF? What happened here you dirty bastard?"" To each his/her own."
"This one is a good beer, I had it previously and didn't review it, and I liked it then. I like it now. This is one of the better beers I've had from Founders, and one I'll buy again. Good beer to buy for a guest over for dinner, and a lot cheaper than scotch :)"
" Body is rich and very creamy, which is surprising, but in a good way. Maybe not entirely appropriate for the style, but good nonetheless. Nicely drinkable, but not exactly a session beer. At this strength, that's a good thing, too. Like all other Founder's beers I've tried, this is definitely a solid offering."
"I revisited this beer again -- leaving it at room temperature and serving it accordingly, makes a huge difference. It is much more aromatic and the flavor really comes to light. I wouldn't recommend serving this chilled or directly out of the fridge."
"D. mmmm, very sip-able. I hope i have more of this. I think the couple months of age really mellowed the huge alcohol that others mentioned. I will definitely seek this out in future. My only question is whether this is appropriate as a scotch ale. this has distinct porter characteristics, which differ greatly from the other other scotch ales that i've had. And yes, i know the difference between the scottish ales and scotch ale."
"Beautiful auburn brown with an off-white head. Smells of smoke and malts. Alcohol is very present. Lots of malt presence with a bit of hops as well. Smokiness is there, but could be more prominent. Thinner than expected, but plenty of carbonation to compromise. Bit heavy body in the long run. Drinks a bit heavier than it's ABV."
"I'll compare it to 'other' scotch ales, it looks good, smells decent, mouthfeel is subpar, it's too carbonated for the style, alchohol is noticable, taste is initally sweet with a dry finish and a bite of somethng I can't identify. Guess my preference in a scotch ale is silky mouthfeel, malty raisen-y toffee and low alchohol. I love alot of founders ales but this one wasn't one of them."
"Pours a thin looking deep brown - maroon with almost pinkish hues on the edges. No head or lacing until I kept swirling (which also brought out more aroma and flavor than on its own; would have given lower ratings otherwise). Sweet caramel smell with hints of cherry. Tastes of apple, raisin, brown sugar, malt, Surprisingly dry finish. Was expecting more warm boozy taste and feel which didn't really come through. Went back and forth with this beer but in the end an okay but not great beer especially for founders."
"It's not just the style as I rated Bellhaven wee heavy quite highly. Something about this beer stands out as ""I hate it."" I'm sure it's not a bad bottle, but hey, I'm rating both to style and to my tastes, and this just plain tastes terrible. Sorry founders, I like some of your stuff but not this one."
"Notes: discovered this one in the back of the DBF tonight. I cannot get Founders in NY, and I cannot remember when I got this one. I suspect it was in MA (Julio's) a couple years ago, possibly as early as May of 2008 or 2009. Can't remember when I put it in the fridge though - it's been in there awhile I'm guessing."
"Drinkability - This is a great brew, however I probably wouldn't be able to have more than 2 of these at a time due to the high ABV. It was very nice on a cold December night. This is also a nice after dinner brew in my opinion. The alcohol comes in nicely and exits easily."
"Founders makes good beers and great beers. This one falls somewhere in between."
"D:Very scary beer. At 8.5, could be a sipping brew, but downing this brew rather quickly. I could see me polishing off a 6 pack in front of the fire with ease."
"D. A nice drinkable beer that goes down easily, could sip on this or drink it in one swallow with no problem. I will be getting more of this beer in the future."
"Poured into a Portsmouth tulip. Deep copper amber pour with a thick tan head. Aroma is of caramel, fruity esters, and licorice. Flavor follows the nose, heavy on the caramel. Slick velvety body with a warming alcoholic finish. Overall, an enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours a deep amber color with an off white head. The aroma of this beer is strong in caramel malt, and a hint of booze. The taste is very smooth with the flavor of caramel malts and again a hint of booze. The mouthfeel is medium heavy, and overall is a drinkable beer."
"D: Easy on the palate and could have several of these in one sitting, but don't need to."
"D: This is a larger tasting beer and the sweetness in the flavor along with the alcohol, felt by the warmth, make this a sipper. I honestly expected it to be a higher abv. This is my first crack at this style and I have yet to fall in love. I am not sure if it is the beer or the style. We shall see."
"The appearance was great, especially for a crisp December afternoon. A really dark, almost Guiness look, dark brown tone. It had a thin cap of caramel-colored foam, that really stuck around for the whole pint."
"It will not be my last Dirty Bastard, that's for sure. What I remember of the only other Scotch ale I've had, a Sam Adams, Dirty Bastard was a little different with the hoppy bitter finish."
"Drinkability: A delightful ale. The hoppy bitterness is a bit unruly, but then again, so are the crazy Scots who originated this style. Two or three of these bad boys and I'd be ready to throw on a kilt, paint half my face blue, and charge those bloody English arseholes with everything I've got. CALEDONIAAA!!!"
"Nice beer. Everything works together to deliver a really good Scotch Ale."
"Very light and drinkable, especially considering the style and the abv; a couple of these could definitely knock you on your ass if you aren't careful. Overall I enjoyed it quite a bit, although it was almost both too sweet and too bitter at times. I only bought a single, so it might grow on me even more after a few."
"D: Not as good as Old Chub, but really good. I wish I lived inside of founders distribution ... :: sigh ::"
"Well balanced but with boldness. Nice."
"Appearance has a dark bronze full bodied look. Cant see through the glass. No head and nice laceing. Smells chocolaty and rich, hints of bread and malt. Tastes just as good as it smells, rich, chocolaty and bready also has a good nice finish. Tastes very good. This is a great beer. I really like this one will definitely drink it again."
"Overall: A good example of the style and a very flavourful beer. Great for cold weather because it warms you up the way a good whiskey of bourbon would."
"Basically this is a class act and your entry into the realm of scotch ales if you're interested."
"You can really pick up on what the brewer was going for with this one. It is a quintessential scotch ale with a full flavor and a handsome feel. Very well done."
"D- Sipping beer that goes down entirely too easy. The hop bite is nice and the crisp finish makes it very refreshing. It can sneak up on you, so be careful. Well balanced and hoppy."
"I've had it on tap several times before I was a ""taster."" Always enjoyed this one."
"Taste wise it's pretty much caramel upfront... Some cocoa and a semisweet chocolate bluntness... Oily slickness in the feel, with a very warm alcohol finish."
"High drinkability for a beer of this weight; very enjoyable, I would definitely have this again."
"This beer pours a nice deep raspberry/redwood color with a beige half finger of foam on the surface. The smell is simple there is malted grains and there is brown sugar. Both aromas are light. The taste has a general sweetness to it. The malt character is rather nice with an almost marshmallow like flavor on the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel washes down really smooth, but has a bitterness perhaps from the alcohol. This is a good beer to drink, I have nothing bad to really say about it. It was a pleasant experience, especially for free!"
"D: One of my first Founders beers, this still doesn't disappoint. No hint of alcohol considering its abv. It is possible that this is hidden too well, but it definitely can be finished quickly and this will sneak up on you."
"the sweetness brings down the drinkability if you're drinking by itself. but I had a bottle the other night with a dinner of pork chops and potatoes and it paired excellently."
"While staying in a log cabin in the Berkshires I found this critter on the shelf in a nearby liquor store. The color was a warm brown and was a great companion to the cold mountains, as it carries a high ABV with a scotchy-malty flavor. The scent was similar, but toned down with a dull barley scent. The heavy malt factor also keeps this brew velvety smooth when sipped. The overall boozy style of it makes me imagine a St. Bernard carrying this around the mountains to revitalize folks!"
"Medium to full body, sticky, dry and chewy. More drinkable than it should be, very tasty but not really shocking. Perhaps my standards for Founders are too high, but I usually expect a little more excitement from one of my favorite breweries."
"D - The bittering and the abv over-power the malts. Lacks the caramel characteristics of a good Scotch ale. Needs to be way too warm to get any of the nuances going, and by then, the beer is flat. At that point, a good single malt would be much more satisfying."
"Seems medium-bodied and fairly smooth to drink for a scotch ale. Decent drinkability for its 8.5 ABV. One of Founders' impressive brews."
"D: Easily a beer the D-train can sip and enjoy on a cool day. If you like scotch style ales, you'll enjoy Dirty Bastard."
"Nice deep ruby brown color, with a finger of tan head and light lacing. Dried dark fruits and sweet, roasted malts in the nose. Very malty tasting, with lots of toffee and caramel coming though. Also some of those dark fruits that were evident in the smell. Smooth and creamy, with just a hint of the 8.5% ABV present in the mouth - A nice Scotch Ale."
"D - As a high abv beer which does good at hinting at you, this is not a beer you'll be downing in numbers."
"Overall I find this beer to be pretty good, I have had this beer many times and enjoy the fact that this beer is widely available in my area. This beer always has a place in my fridge. A great scotch ale from a great brewery."
"Total-3.53, B"
"Drinkability: Good."
"D - A sipper, and I'm kind of glad I am only drinking half a bottle of this. A solid beer but not my favorite style. Certainly enjoyable however and I could see it being the perfect beer if I was in the mood for it."
"Was excited for this one, and it delivered."
"Drinkabilty - Its just a little to strong to drink more then 1 or 2. But for sure i could see drinking this weekly. I really enjoyed the scotch flavor, really nice job again by founders"
"It's a good beer, but it does taste like scotch at all. There was no smoke or peat. It's just a nice dark and malty beer that's slightly bitter."
"Taste is really malt forward with strong toffee, caramel, molasses flavors that are abundant. That leaves your palate with a faint hop bitterness and slight alcohol hottness. Could be a little more lively in the mouth, but has good body none-the-less. After a while I'm sure this would get cloying but for one bottle its great."
"The taste is that good."
"D- A good intricate beer. Reminded me of OA Arrogant Bastard to be honest. It's one that you want to savor in that regard. One thing I didn't like was that I had to really swish it around, before the flavor would take hold. Aside from that, it's an impressive brew."
"The taste improves on the nose just a little bit. The sweet crystal malt is coupled with just a little bitterness. The finish is on the sweet side which fits with this style. I'm thinking this bottle is just touch oxidized as well. The body is also on the fuller side which I feel masks a lot of the alcohol that is present in the nose. Even though the nose and taste are just about average for me, it is very drinkable for a 8.5% beer."
"Appearance is cloudy, with an array of hues that make the beer look delicious and inviting. A fluffy nougat head on top. A dark brown to mahogany glow to the bottom of the glass. The smell is unbelievable. Sweet fruits to a chocolatey, malty backbone. Taste's earthy. Not quite what I was expecting. A lot of hoppy bitterness. Hot alcohol. Malt and grains somewhere in the mix. Definitely a sipper. As it warms up it tastes more and more like bourbon or a brown liquor. Have a good night..."
"d- nice, this is a top notch scotch ale, i would drink this one again. yet again i maintain that founders doesn't make bad beer."
"Overall it's not bad but not something I'll expect to seek out again."
"Mouthful is very good as well, some scotch ales over play the alcohol, or they compeletly forget to put it in. This brew is pretty good by Founders. Its a heavy/strong brew that is easy to drink. I picked this up in a Founders Variety pack...would definitly pick it up again."
"D- I have a problem at times with scotch ales but this one was good. It is a little sweet for me and that makes it a hard drinker for a sixer. That's just me though. The ABV is a little high to makes this a session beer without getting drunk. Overall, a good beer and nice way to rep the style."
"Overall: Very solid Wee Heavy. Founders puts out a good product and this is another fine example."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. Drinkability is good, it's a very flavorful beer and has a lot of depth to it. The flavors all came together very nicely overall. A very good choice to sip on after dinner tonight."
"Aromas of alcohol, toffee, and bread. Color is a cloudy dark red with a nice tan head. A really nice looking beer. Taste is very malty and complex with alcohol noted up front, with cocoa and toffee coming in the finish. A dense palate with a heavy body. Very nice long finish that keeps changing. This is a very nice, complex brew. Outstanding."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with one finger of dark tan head.  Smells are plums, sweet caramel and dark fruits.  Tastes are malts, hops, dark fruits.  There's a lot of flavor here, very good. Mouthfeel is medium and goes down pretty smooth, and drinkability is pretty high given the Abv."
"Highly drinkable for such a strong beer."
"D - When I drink a wee heavy, I like it to be on the sweet side. With the bitter hoppy after taste, I think this category suffers a little. But wee heavies, this one included always pleasantly surprise me with their drinkability, considering with the ABV."
"D- Drinkable, but not much of a session beer. Good one to drink but not one to have more than one of"
"Moderate drinkability. It's good and the alcohol burn doesn't bother me, but it's not one I would have more than 2 or so at a sitting."
"D- I would only drink one or two of these, sipping slowly."
"D - Probably not sessionable, but certainly highly drinkable! I was very pleasantly surprised by this brew and am glad one of my BA friends hooked me up with this offering...now to remember who gave it to me so I can pay them back!"
"I though this had really good flavor, lots to experience. It went down smoothly but it's difficult to drink more than a couple of these."
"The beer is brown with a reddish tint and a short tan head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The robust smell is of vanilla, dark chocolate, caramelized malts and a hint of dark fruits. There's an initial burst of sweetness when you first taste it. Then you get the taste of the malt, dark chocolate, vanilla & fruit, which quickly followed by a short warmth of alcohol. Very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish leaves just a bit of stickiness."
"really poor drinkability, i was planning on having a few brews while bottling my homebrew saison, got through my first from the six pack and cursed myself for not getting FBS instead. maybe it's super fresh and could use some age, gonna go check on that..."
"Pics at: http://t.co/gTrqCuz"
"D: Very easy to drink, goes down smoothly."
"D - Pretty good."
"Poured into a 22oz. bomber glass. Pours into a amber color and has a nice creamy head that leaves a lace around the glass that shows the strength of the beer. Has a nice complex smell that has aromas of dark fruit, cherries and undertones of chocolate. Has a nice smooth taste with little carbonation. Has a really nice taste and has a good drinkability."
"Wow! An awesome example of a scotch ale! Haven't tried too many from the style but I can tell that this one is a gem. Each sip leaves me wanting more and at 8.5%, I know it will catch up to me quickly. Savor it and drink with caution."
"Very sippable, this is the last of my six pack. Time to buy more!"
"This turned out to be a really good brew, just not one I'm likely to crave anytime soon. Easily drinkable."
"For this style and ABV, very drinkable. let it warm a bit and it tastes even better."
"M-D: Smooth on the tongue. However, kind of rough on the way down... hint hint, the alcohol (8.5%). Would I drink again??? Sure, but this would be a sipping beer."
"This beer has a lovely brown/red colour, but and a decent head that fades to lacing around the edge of the glass. The smell is lovely and malty but there is also some fresh hoppiness there too. This beer has a very complex taste. For me, this beer tasted fresh and citrussy up front but the malt quickly took over and it became sweet and syruppy. The finish is roasty and smooth. This is possibly my favourite beer. Taste this with your eyes closed and enjoy the ride."
"It's not the most drinkable beer in the world but it's very nice"
"D- the 8.5% abv. is noticeable but it's still easy to drink; a fairly complex beer that one in an evening should be sufficient; I think it would be a great outdoor evening beer during the Fall months"
"Thoughts* Great scottish style ale. Very traditional take on the style and good balance. Good feel and it drinks nice. I like to have a nice scotch ale every now and then, but they are not my favorite style of beer."
"D: I like this beer alot and have had it before. I have bought it again, so it must be good."
"Pours a dark, cloudy brown with a tan head. Not too large of a head and little retention. Smell is a little phenolic with some caramel and toffee. It goes down very smooth and malty. No real hop bitterness. Taste is caramel and a slight hint of coffee. Very drinkable and you don't taste any hint of the 8.5% ABV. Very nice."
"pours a rich chestnut tone with just shy of a finger's head; moderate retention, limited lacing. nose is predominantly malty - roasted and sweet - with dark fruits intertwined. first sip packs a caramel malt jolt with the dark fruits behind it; subdued hoppy notes; alcohol in the finish. tasty. nice, creamy mouthfeel... in summation, a very enjoyable (though not quite incredible) beer; going 4's across the board on this bastard."
"Chestnutty-walnutty-mahogany color, exactly the color of my piano, that glistened in a thistle under a narrow tan head. The aroma was strictly fruit and malt, dominated by nectarines and apricots and a line of caramel that was powerful but in a polite way. Plenty of the same fruit in the taste plus raisins and graham crackers, and just a little too much bitterness from the hops at the end. Still, an exceptional wee heavy that rises near the top of the pile. The 8.5% ABV has plenty of burn; keep away from lawn mowers and roto-tillers. A perfect autumn beer."
"Mouthfeel is rather light but a bit creamy and carbonation seems just right. This is my first beer from Founders, and while its not one of their hyped up stouts, I can still see why they get so much respect. A very solid ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium, definitely coats the mouth. Drinkability is good for something of this ABV"
"D - I could see myself having possibly 3 of these in a night at max. It's a fairly easy drink at 8.5%, so I wouldn't suggest downing a whole sixer, you may regret it."
"The mouthfeel was very chewy and full. Lots of carbonation here as well. This does drink smooth and easy but one of these as a nightcap is plenty for me. This is a very enjoyable Scotch Ale from Founders."
"Drinkability is amazing. I could drink the night away with this beer no problem... only if it was a little more affordable."
"Drinkability: The higher ABV of this brew is certainly present, but this is more than made up for by the overall mouthfeel and drinkability of this concoction. Founders has done a remarkable job capturing the Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy style, and I will most assuredly be drinking more of this from time to time."
"D - A great Scottish ale. Plenty of complexity and great flavor."
"in the mouth and it's just a rich orgy of sweetness, deep roasted, candied malts...amazing...hard to describe this nectar...would be so much more warming at this massive ABV in the fall and winter, but this is helping me look forward to my favorite time of the year. tho little carbonation at the surface, this is perfectly thick without any cloying sense. reminds me of various barleywine experiences...intense, balanced and drinkable as a session brew for anyone in a kilt!"
"Im glad I tried this one but when Im at my Local Liquor store Ill probably pass it up. Ill Admit some bias due to weather but this one just wasnt happening today. Ill think of giving it another go in the late fall."
"D- Just a great beer that is unique and leaves you wanting more. The 8.5% ABV is well hidden, so make sure you don't drink too much."
"Deep maple syrup color. Very little head and no retention. Sweet malty, maple aroma with strong presence of ripe apple and drak fruits. Thick feel that doesn't allow any carbonation to figh t through. Sweet maple and dark fruit flavor with a slight hop bitterness at the end that leaves a bit of a medicinal finish. Nice flavor. The thickness, aftertaste and higher ABV make this a sipper."
"very good beer and surprisingly easy to drink and is a smooth beer and nice nightcap"
"Taste followed suit, but the dark fruit and coffee flavors were even stronger. Definitely a tasty scotch ale, would love to try the Backwoods Bastard"
"Definitely worth a visit if one wants a malt bomb with some bitter edges."
"update: a few months has seemed to help bring out the malts a bit more, very welcome."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (bottled 4/21/10) into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark brown with a sticky tan head. In the nose I get a strong aroma of some burnt caramel, dark fruits, and chocolate with a touch of peat smoke. Taste's much of the same as smell; heavy caramel malts and dark fruit sweetness with a touch of fusel alcohol and smokiness. Very creamy and chewy mouthfeel that hugs the palate. Very yummy brew but only one per sitting."
"The mouthfeel is far and away the best aspect of this brew. Outstanding. Low carbonation combined with no shortage of residual sugars renders an unbelievably thick and creamy body. Feels like the finest imperial stout on the way down. Overall, it is not really to my liking, although it's easy to appreciate the fact that this is a well-made beer. I prefer less hop bitterness and more darker malts in a Scotch ale. Backwoods Bastard...now that's another story."
"Drinkability - Well I don't know who would knock more than one of these back in a session. It is a pretty big beer and heavy on the boom boom. I really like it but I tend to favor small beers rather than the high gravity."
"D - Though I do enjoy this beer, it really only makes me think... DAMN!! What a difference barrel aging makes. When Founders turns this brew into Backwoods Bastard, the transformation is astounding."
"Poured a transparent reddish-bronze with little carbonation, one finger of tan, and modest lacing. Smelled of caramel apple, toffee, raisins, and overall sweetness. The taste was more robust...raisins, molasses, syrup, and toffee in copious amounts, with a sweet'ish finish and molasses/rum-raisin afterwards. The flavor profile would make you think that this is a thick beer, but it was actually a nicely smooth medium feel. Great session Scotch-style ale."
"This is so far my favorite Founders offering. Recommended."
"I relish any opportunity to employ my thistle goblet. *sigh* Anyway, this guy pours a slightly hazy garnet brown topped by a finger of light tan foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, earth, and a small garland of flowers. The taste follows, focusing on the maple syrup and brown sugar, adding some molasses, vanilla extract, and a touch of cocoa powder. A distinctly sharp sweet bitterness (yeah, you read that right) comes in at the end. (Okay, maybe bitterness was the wrong word...just a bittery sharp twang o' sweet.) The body is a firm medium, with a light carbonation and a dryish, grainy feel. A nice, solid wee heav', as expected from the people up at Founders."
"Drinkability is alright. Not overly inviting, and i would not want more than one at a time."
"The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with below average carbonation. This is not overly easy to drink, partially because of the high levels of carbonation, but also because of how complex it is. Something about it makes it difficult to go down at times, but it is definitely a great beer, and enjoyable."
"It's outstanding. Right now this is my go to Scotch Ale. I'd like to say it's by go to beer, but let's not forget it's 8.5% ABV."
"I'm not sure what the deal was previously. I f'n love me a wee heavy but the one I had last week was cloying on the burn. So, I guess be warned - it could happen to you. Let it adjust to the room a good spell and it's a treat."
"D-excellent beer, I could drink this again and again"
"i love scottish ale but this is just too high in alcohol . the taste lingers in thoart too long , even after you stop drinking it if want to wake up in the morning , not remembering the night before drink this beer, but it not a plasant time , if you love a good beer and great taste , then skip this beer ,"
"First review so maybe I have nothing to bring to the table. I just wanted documentation that I LOVE this beer."
"D - While it says 8.5 now, I don't where it is. Certainly not sessionable, but could easily enjoy a couple of these."
"D - This is a decent American interpretation of the style, but just doesn't match up to the authentic versions in my opinion. The alcohol flavors aren't as smooth and the hops are more prominent on the finish/aftertaste. That said, it's a good beer and I would drink it again (and also, this is not my first tasting of this beer)."
"D- The beauty and taste of this beer make it highly drinkable-- which means you just have to be careful because it's high in alcohol"
"D: The lightness of the body of this beer, coupled with the great taste, make this very drinkable."
"Being a craft beer fan, I had to try this one."
"Taste was all malt, caramel, toffee but nothing too burnt or coffee like. Not quite as good as FFF Robert the Bruce, but darn close. Really enjoyed this, even sitting outside on hot night."
"RESPECT"
"Overall a another awesome beer from Founders. This growler shouldn't last long"
"Pours a amber-brown colour with a small white head. Smells very sweet of cherry, caramel and raisons. Tastes incredibly sweet, with some mild bitterness to it. Lots of fruit in the flavour, which works very well for this. Very nice carbonation, very smooth. I had no idea how strong this was when I ordered it, but didn't realize it was over 8% abv. I could drink a lot of this."
"D - 1 or 2 is good but you can't drink all 6 in 1 sitting. Nice for a Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy."
"O - A good tasting wee heavy. I prefer their stouts but certainly enjoy this as a nice change of pace."
"D-One of those brews that is definately a ""must try"" and a ""must have"" There will always be a place for this in my cellar. I could drink this all night, and can't imagine anyone not enjoying it."
"One of the better Scotch Ales I have had, as I haven't had many and am not a huge fan of the ones that I have had. I'd buy it again if I wanted something a bit sweet. I like it better than Weizenbocks."
"Poured into a pint glass and was greeted with a 1 finger thick white head that quickly disappeared. Light amber color. Smells pretty sweet right upfront with a pretty evident caramel smell. Tastes moderately sweet with definite notes of caramel malts, also lightly fruity tasting with some vanilla in there to. Hops are there to but not to evident. Very nice creamy smooth mouthfeel. A very pleasant beer and the alcohol is hidden nicely behind layers of flavors."
"This is a very, very drinkable scotch ale. And at 8.5% it could sneek up on you. A very tasty scotch ale. The only drawback was the head retention, but maybe its because I used a nonic glass."
"One of the first I had of the style, had no idea those years back that this would be one of the best for the style."
"Poured a dark amber, almost ruby, into my pint glass with about a finger of white head. Not much carbonation. Decent lacing left behind. Smelled of sweet toated malt. Definite aroma of caramel and slight chocolate coming through. Taste was on par with the aroma...sweet maltiness with notes of caramel and chocolate. I picked up a hint of dark fruit also. Very full mouthfeel with a long lingering after taste. This beer was extremely easy to drink and I throughly enjoyed every sip. I'll definitely be keeping a six pack of this in the fridge from here on out."
"Pours a dark brownish-red color with a small white head. Looks kinda creamy. When putting nose to beer, I pick up hints of banana, sweet malts, booze, and candy sugars. This smells like it's gonna be a very sweet beer. After tasting it, it is not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be. More hoppiness than I expected as well. Not nearly as boozy as it smelt either. Very tasty brew tho. I get a lot of dark fruits and a slight scotch taste. Delicious! Very nice, creamy mouthfeel. I could probably have two or three of these in one sitting. Good beer overall."
"Hides its alcohol well. I've had Scotch Ales I've liked more than this one, but it is good and worth trying. Just wish it was a little fuller in the mouth."
"DB- Great malt profile. The price is good and the ABV is well-hidden. It's not a great session beer because of the huge malt flavors but I could throw back a few of these. Enjoyable to the end of the glass. Reminiscent of a Brown Ale but unique in it's own right. Solid Scotch Ale."
"D - An excellent beer and one of the best (if not the best) that I have tried of this style."
"D_Great session beer although ABV is a bit high. Good go to beer."
"D. Founders really knows how to construct sweet, malty high octane brews."
"So good that you need to wear a condom when you drink it. Seriously. This is proof that perfection is just out of reach."
"Cheers!"
"F: A little alcohol spicy feel hits at first with a touch of warming booze, then more sweet syrupy flavors with some molasses and maple, a little brown sugar now, lots of dark malts. More smoke as well. THen some earthy bitterness comes out more than before on the finish but still not too heavy. Bitterness also comes from the roasted malt flavors. A slight sticky sweetness but not as much as I expected from how heavy and sweet the beer is. Another nice tasty concoction from Founders as usual."
"D: ABV a little sharp to be too drinkable. Flovorful and pretty well balanced."
"overall - pretty good scotch ale. gets better as you drink it and get over the 8.3ABV."
"Drinkability - Alcohol is not distracting, though the beer is not one I would session."
"Drinkability: An average to just above Scotch Ale. Not one i would turn down, but nothing to rush and get. It meets all the style guidelines, but there just appears to be something missing."
"Taste is very balanced with lots of malt. Very roasted and dark tasting. Some bitterness with a hint of hops. The flavor is quite intense and stays around for some time. There is good carbonation and not too heavy not too light mouth feel. Very drinkable beer and alcohol is not well hidden. I think this is a fine representative of the style."
"I love Founders, I suppose this isn't my favorite offering from them although I totally respect this brew and what they're going for w/ it."
"Notes- Overall, a decent brew, not my favorite Wee Heavy by any means but I wouldn't turn it down if offered one."
"I guess Sappy Slappy Bastard got my hopes up too high for Dirty Bastard. All told I think this beer is pretty unremarkable. Maybe it's better from the bottle."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with hints of reddish notes and an off white head. The aroma is of toffee and caramel, smells like whiskey, very warm and inviting aroma. Some nuttiness is also detectable. The taste is solid, there is a roasted nut malt backbone and a caramel backbone with hints of toffee. The taste is similar to whiskey, a slight taste of alcohol is present. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly slick. The drinkability is good, there is a decent amount going on flavor wise to keep you interested, the alcohol is well hidden with a slight alcohol burn to it."
"But then I got a bottle at D4, and it was flat and kind of dulled of flavor. I don't know if it was just an old bottle they had lying around, or what. I'm assuming as much, because I really liked the bottle I had bought from the store, and plan on getting some more."
"pours a very solid dark brown color with almost no head and very light lacing. light carbonation that is barely noticable. it has very carmel-nutty like flavor, maybe even a little bit of a coffee and chocolate taste but not much. very bitter and extremely flavorful. all around a fantastic beer."
"D - Pretty sure this is the first scotch ale that I've ever had. Really enjoyed it but would probably put my limit at two of these."
"Served in a pint size glass. With dark brownish color and an abundant tan head. Strong scents of sweet caramel, brown sugar and sweet apples. The taste is somewhat overwhelming strong malts, sweet fruit dark fruits, chocolates, and roasted nuts. Very little hop profile, hops take a back seat. Mouthfeel is very heavy and the alcohol steps forward in this beer. This beer has a lot of taste but limited drinkable nature."
"Being a scotch whisky fan, I really enjoyed this. Reminded me of a Highland single malt."
"drinkability: not a fan of the style but this was nice"
"Pours a chocolate brown color with a disappointing head, settles into a light ring. The aroma is a bit woodsy and has hints of brown sugar. Nice aroma just wish it was stronger. The taste is of chocolate milk, wet bark, light roasted malt and smoke and some brown sugar sweetness. Very nice flavors. Solid malt body, a bit chewy, decent carbonation, smooth, finishes with a light bitterness. A good scotch ale, not the heaviest nor flavorful but pretty darn good. Founders knows how to brew a dang drinkable brew, no matter the style."
"Pours extremely dark reddish-brown, nice off-white head. Many carbonation bubbles floating up and sticking to the sides of the glass. Tons of sediment. Leaves some lacing. Smell is very malty, caramel, slight coffee-ish/roasty smell. Wow this is much better than I remember it being. The malts are excellent, a great chocolate/caramel taste with a bit of spiciness, a bit of dark fruit. That ""cola"" taste I always seem to get from scotch ales (maybe just the caramel?). The malts are definitely king here. You can sense a hint of the hops and the 50 IBUs but it just gets trampled by sweet malts. Mouthfeel gets an easy 5 from me, one of the most smoothest, velvety beers I have ever drank. I remember there being quite a bit of alcohol taste the first time I had it but this time I am getting none whatsoever. Drinkability, usually a beer of this style is kind of a sipper for me, but here before I knew it it's nearly gone. This is my 3rd time having it (twice in the bottle, once on-tap) and I enjoyed it the most this time around by far. Usual excellence from Founders, I'd love to try Backwoods sometime."
"D- Some what boozy. This isnt really a session style so this isnt really a session beer."
"D: It's rather drinkable and the alcohol was well hidden."
"Great ruby red color and light aroma. This beer has a stronger Irish Red flavor, but my favorite aspect is how it finishes like a Stout, almost a coffee aftertaste without being bitter. I enjoyed this beer, and Irish Reds are not my preferred beer type."
"I'm not a big scotch ale fan but Founders is among the best I've had. The color is dark brown, like a brown ale, good aroma and great mouthfeel. If you like Scotch Ale this is one of my favorites."
"This is a good beer but is just seems a bit off from a balance standpoint. The high ABV mixed with the lack of balance makes it a little more difficult to have multiples."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"D: For the abv it is fairly drinkable. I find myself searching for something else along with the malts. Enjoyable, just not my favorite Founders beer."
"Notes: Hmmm. a bit of a disappointment as a Scotch ale. It´s a fair brew but it is well short of what might be expected of the style, or a rich free interpretation, let alone what the narrative on the six-pack promises: Complex finish with hints of smoke and peat. There is nothing of it. But the six-pack albeit a bit boring is drinkable if not particularly worth seeking forth. Maybe time will mellow the alcohol profile a bit and have a nice and maybe richer malty profile?"
"D - not a favorite style of mine, but this is quite yummy and a fair representation of the style. incredible mouthfeel makes this very comforting on a chilly spring evening. interested to see how a couple of these do with some time on them as there's 5 left in my fridge."
"pours a cloudy copper with highlights of amber and a one finger off white head and impressive lace. smells sweet and bready with strong aromas of caramel malt and biscuit tones, really appealing. tastes dominated by toffee and roasted sweetness. a little bready with a robust backround. nice and flavorful. i will be getting this beer again."
"D - Goes down easy and more bitter than I thought, I can see why this gets solid reviews most of the time."
"Notes: Charlie from Five Points Bottle Shop told me that Founders was one of the top 3 breweries in the country right now. After experiencing this Scotch Ale, I am inclined to agree. I have been searching for a brew that I could enjoy on a regular basis. And if only they had a version of this that was about half the ABV, I would have found my brew. This is a great beer, one of my favorites. I am stoked that I have 5 more in this pack to enjoy. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The short little beer was a nice mahogany color. The beer poured a tan head that was unimpressive. The smell of the beer was caramel and sweet. It tasted sweet also and was high in alcohol. I will try this beer again though as I was not sure if Liked it or not. I only had a half of one so I will come back to this one."
"d- Very nice drinkability, nice n smooth"
"drinkability is good - i would limit my self to only 1 or 2 in a session"
"Picked up a single last week and had it last night during a session with a buddy. Poured a rich reddish dark brown with a thin head. Light lacing in the glass. Smelled sweet with malts and candy. Taste was smooth and darkly sweet with slight whiskey finish. Hints of raisin and chocolate. Mouthfeel was thick and a bit creamy. Drinkability was only ok for me as this is not my style. 1, maybe 2 of these on a good night."
"Got this as a gift from beertunes, Poured into a SA perfect pint glass, it was dark brown with a light brown head and decent lacing. Smell was sweet malt with some fruit in the background. Taste was nice, im not a huge fan of the style but this was quite good. Had what i would call a cough syrupy mouthfeel but with a tangy hop finish. Recommended if you can find it. Thanks T!"
"The body and drinkability was typical for the style, a lot will depend on your tolerance for the strength of these beers. Worth a try if you see it."
"D: A nice example of the style."
"Picked up a growler at the brewery over the KBS weekend. Pours a very dark red with a good amount of foam on each pour. The taste is of very dark malt with a hint of scotch to it. Its pretty smooth and easy to drink for 8.3%. I'd be lying though if I didn't say I was expecting a bit more from this. I'm sure I won't be able to walk straight after finishing this growler though."
"I haven't had a beer in a week after my wisdom teeth taken out. Has a dark color to it, up to the light it looks a bit more amber, has a small head but not much. Smell is very malty with some chocolate aroma too, I smells pretty good. Taste is good, it's quite strong from an alcohol stand point, has a pretty strong coffee taste to it, I wish I wasn't in pain I'd probably enjoy this more"
"Great example of the style! This is very drinkable and complex. Another Founders winner!!"
"Light aroma of earthy grains and peat. palette picking up a touch of caramel and vanilla from the malt bill with that earthy touch. well done mouthfeel and decent drinkablity but not a session beer."
"Pours deep brow with big dense head. Not much on aroma, but flavor is huge, sweet, malty, yet light. It has a pleasant smokiness and bitterness on the finish - dark bread, roasted nuts, very dark cherry fruit. Mouthfeel light and pleasant. As it warms, the beer takes on a sharp, winelike tannic bitterness that highlights the malt complexity"
"This is the 2nd best beer I've ever had, behind Hopslam. This is a bold, in-your-face beer that is easy to drink and packs a punch. Excellent!"
"D: Really tasty! At first I felt this was better than its bourbon-dominated cousin, but I came to realize that the bourbon works VERY well for this beer. Not to knock D.B. in any way; Founders did a great job with both."
"Medium bodied, minimal hoppiness with modest maltiness. Caramel is the predominant taste, but unfortunately, this feels like a weak scottish style than a good scotch style brew. Disappointintg, for whatever reason, it feels as if Founders skimped on ingredients, which is hard to believe."
"D. Very drinkable. Would never know that it is 8/5%. Nice balance of sweet malt with hop bitterness. I like this quite a bit."
"D: A very smooth easy drinking beer, lots going on, lots to think about. An excellent intro to the style. A great beer, highly recommended."
"D: Pretty good scotch ale that is probably one of the better ones I've had. Not as good as Skullsplitter, (which I really enjoyed) but a real good example of the style. A hybrid brew that is both enjoyable and moderately drinkable. The abv can catch up, though."
"Overall I am starting to enjoy Scotch ales more and more and Founders delivers yet again. Recommend."
"d - i consider this a nice treat when i want something different. too strong and rich to drink more than 1 or 2 at any given time, but still an excellent beer."
"Had a Dirty Bastard at work. Very nice head with light lacing . The aroma was nice and malty, with a few hints of chocolate and caramel that gave way to a light alcohol essence. Tasted great, had a plesent mouthfeel and finished much lighter than I anticipated from the smell. Overall, a quality brew."
"8.3% alcohol is well hidden in this dangerously sessionable brew."
"Big malt with some fruitcake flavors - nuts and dark fruits. ETOH is a little prominent in the flavor profile throughout, but this is not unexpected in this style. Sweetness fades toward the end, with bittering picking up and lingering at the finish. Seems a bit heavy-handed."
"D: Flavors are big, but definitely not bruising. The Dirty Bastard is quite complex, yet it remains subtle and highly drinkable. None of the flavors are overdone, and everything meshes quite well together. Alcohol is noticeable, providing a bit of a burn, but it doesn't overwhelm any of the other flavors. Rather, it just blends in."
"Taste: Begins with a floral sweetness that then is taken over by the roasted bitterness similar to maybe a coffee. Well balanced so that there is not one thing that is super strong."
"Pours a deep opaque chocolate-coffee brown with a fine-bubbled beige head. Aroma is malty with a chocolaty undertone and a hint of caramel. Flavor is lively, malty and spicy with an undertone of cinnamon candy and just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is edgy, tingly and sassy - it seems to dance on your tongue."
"Drinkability- This beer is a wonderful compliment to a meal. I could easily drink two and be absolutely satisfied. Overall, great beer."
"D- Very. Not so heavy as it weighs you down, but still dark enough to keep you warm and smooth enough to allow you to have another, which is not such a bad idea."
"Mouthfeel is medium-heavy. Overall, this is a great ale. I wouldn't ""pound"" these - it is a little too heavy and complex for me. However, this offers a great drinking experience."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It's a deep dark cider color which is very nice. Not much head here and barely any lacing. It has a sweet melt smell with alcohol underneath. It's an intimidating first hit. The sweet malt taste matches the smell. There's a little bit of fruit and hops that follow. The style is a bit bland for me, but it's still nice. This beer could wreck you because you can sip this pretty easy."
"Medium bodied despite all the sweetness. I bet I could drink 2 of these in a row."
"This guy reminds me of DFH Indian Brown....deceptively drinkable, and subtle complexity. Very nice."
"I love this beer and think of it as a go-to beer that I could come back to at any time. If it were a bit cheaper, I'd have some in my fridge at all times."
"The flavor is big malt with a lean and complimentary hop bite that only improves the beer. The smokiness in the malt shows up more but is well blended with the sweeter flavor and that makes this a pretty complex and totally drinkable beer. The mouth feel is good and full and delivers the flavors well. Cheers!"
"I've given a good drinkability rating because Scotch Ales have become one of my favorites and while the abv is high, it isn't too high. The Dirty Bastard displays lots of hop characer, mainly herbal and resinous, that is a little high for the style. I think that this and Ol Chub are my two favorites because they are quite similar."
"Dark brown with slight crimson hues at the very edges. A thick foamy head dissipates slowly and leaves a few random chunks behind. Smells of malts and caramel with spicy and sugary undertones. Very complex to the nose, and some sweet cherry notes rise after a bit. Goes down airy and open with more caramel notes, toasted grain, a very distant cherry tartness, slight hops and some subtle earthy notes. Very well-carbonated and medium to full-bodied. Alcohol is well integrated, with no heat to speak of. I have to be in a certain mood for this style, but when I get ahold of a good one, it's hard to beat. Loving this one."
"The only heaviness in this beer is the 8.30% ABV but it's not that noticeable in terms of the taste. This is one solid brew that has made me appreciate this style more. Scotch Ales will never be my forte, but after having this offering from Founders, I'm actually inclined to seek these out a bit more now, and isn't that what a good beer should make one do?"
"*Note: Tasting notes from 10/20/09. Have had this on bottle and draft and definitely prefer the draft."
"D - A solid drinker. While I'll likely seldom return to it, it's not at all bad. Worth a shot."
"A great, bitter scotch style ale! Pours a dark amber with little head. Smells slightly tropical, not much else. Taste is bitter and heavy.. fantastic! Reminds me of Old Chub, not as smooth, but more bitter. Excellent brew and Im thrilled I can now buy in Georgia."
"The label on this one was in red plaid with a menacing looking Scots Man wearing a newsboy cap and sneering. The label stated it had 50 IBU's and 8.5% alcohol and was bottled on 12-9-2009. After an agressive pour I only managed the single finger of pale beige head that faded to minimal lacing. The beer itself was a deep mohagany color and very inviting looking. The aroma was quite muted but did impart some slight pineapple smell. The flavors on this one truely set it off. There was the afore mentioned pineapple from the nose, some dark cherry, banana, and the scotch/peet smoke that is typical of this style. There also was just enough hops to balance out the malt back bone and lend a little bitterness. The alcohol was very well hidden but started to warm after 2-3 gulps. Mouthfeel was virtually perfect. Not to thick or thin which made for excellent drinkability. Overall this is a very nice example of scotch ale, but the high alcohol content catches up after only 2 beers."
"Overall I only had the dirty and cerise cherry ale and both are excellent for 2.50 beers. Toast!"
"Thoughts _ A nice rich kick in the mouth Scottish ale, this is another gem from a great brewery."
"Drinkability: Very tough to swallow down at first, but once you get to the bastards center, you can actually respect and get along with in the long run. If your a pro to this, you might say it's just another brew, but I did enjoy the sometimes harsh spices this beer brought to the table. Will enjoy again. Cheers!"
"D= Pretty good drinkability, especially for the ABV. I will keep drinking this as it is very available locally!"
"My first night ever with Founders, Breakfast Stout equaled expectations, Dirty Bastard exceeded expectations."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory pint. Poured deep, hazy copper with a half inch, loose, off-white head. Head dissipates into a broken skim and some random strands of lacing. Malty, roasty, smoky and dark fruit emanate from glass; maybe also a hint of peat, as I get an earthy quality in the mix as well. Taste is consistent with nose, sweetness is there, but complements rather than overwhelms. Also a slightly medicinal aftertaste, but not unpleasant. There is also a light hops bittering the makes its presence know as well. Mouthfeel is medium, lightly effervescent and nicely coats the tongue. A nice example of the style - not as malty and sweet as I'm accustomed too, but pretty tasty I have to say."
"D: My first beer from Founders Brewing Co., and it's absolutely delicious. Could definitely go for more in the future."
"A solid offering from Founders."
"One of the best beers I've had to date. This is a style I'm pretty unfamiliar with in my young beer drinking days, but this shit is TASTY!"
"All in all, this is a pretty good brew. If you like the hoppiness of an IPA with the nice smooth flavors of a breakfast stout, then this is for you. Very good."
"Another excellent beer from Founder's."
"D: All in all, an above average brew. Any low scores are a reflection of a Founders beer being rated to the high expectation I have come to have from such a wonderful brewery."
"Pours dark reddish-brown with a minimal off-white head. Aroma is lots of caramel, dark fruit and some alcohol. Not much peet smoke in the aroma. The flavor is very fruity and sweet. Not too much smoke. You get a little roasted malt and the alcohol is present and warming. Medium mouthfeel and pretty drinkable for a beer of this strength."
"I find that the more Dirty Bastard i drink, the more I like it, which is a good thing. Also, I would never guess that the ABV on this one was above 8%."
"Tastes slightly sweet but is balanced by the malts. It has an almost peety taste, that you can almost chew in your mouth, a really full bodied and exceptional beer. Overall it is also really drinkable, probably more so than other Scotch ale's I have tried."
"Not as sweet as some wee heavys and the bourbon can be trying but is nicely done."
"Drinkability: Excellent. Could drink this beer anytime. In addition to a pint glass, I also tried it in a wine glass (as I didn't have a snifter or tulip available) and the aromas and flavors became even more apparent. Good anytime, anywhere, any which way."
"Fantastic beer and is enjoyed every time. A bit too big to have a session on, kicking back a couple would not be out of the question. A pleasure to drink."
"A well constructed Scotch ale. Sufficient complexity and highly drinkable for the style."
"Pours a pretty dark copper with a small head. Nice persistent lacing on the surface. Aroma is caramel malt. Spices. Taste is rich carmel malt. Bourbon. Muted bitterness in the finish. Dull sweetness with some light spiciness. Smooth. Very nice medium bodied velvety mouthfeel. Easily drinkable- I find this goes down easier than most Scotch Ales. Really nice beer overall."
"Founders delivers yet another great beer. A pour of dirty bastard is thick and dark, I was encouraged by the unpolished look of the beer and how quickly the head died down to a thin skim of bubbles. The aroma was malt, with a hint of malt. The taste is of course malty... but a complex malty that eludes to a complex grain bill and a careful fermentation. The mouth feel is a little syrupy but this is a strong scotch ale. I will be buying it again but only one bottle at a time due to potency."
"Drinkability:Pretty drinkable brew. Definitely a unique one which gained a bit of needed complexity as it warmed. Had plenty of heavy noticeable malt, spice, and amber ale qualitys. I'd have no problem enjoying this again some night."
"Well made and easy drinking."
"Drinkability is quite high, a nice smooth malty scotch ale, although I could use less phenols and a more quality malt taste. Quibbling though, it's well done."
"Really unique, though I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. A nice cold weather sipper that I should have poured into a snifter rather than a pint glass."
"NOTE: I have several of these over three nights at varying temperatures to try and find one that balances out the bitter, sweet, and booze better...but to no avail. hmmm"
"Very complex, another Founder's winner."
"Excellent. Although I have enjoyed all the Founders beers I have tried, this beer was quite a pleasant surprise. A very well-rounded beer across the categories. Will definitely keep an eye out for more of this and am looking forward to trying the Backwoods Bastard."
"drinkability is great, very tasty, solid well balance - a no-messing-around scotch ale that remains easy to drink"
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is easy going down. It is high an ABV but still pleasant and not overpowering."
"Drinkability: A nicely drinkable Scotch Ale that is quite sippable. I'd be happy to have a second. And I expect I'll be having a few more of these."
"Medium to full bodied with low carbonation levels that help this marinate on the tongue. This is definitely one of the best wee heavies I have had, and the only one I can say for sure that I like better is Scotty Karate. Great beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but I think the strong sweetness of the malts was too much here. It needed some bitterness or something at the end to round it out. The ABV though is nicely warming in the winter, but not too strong. I almost think the beer is mis-named as it's not a Dirty Bastard at all, but more like a Polite Scotsman. That being said, I don't see how anyone could have more than one of these in a sitting - too much sweet and too high ABV to have more than one in an evening."
"D- this one is to dry for me to have more than one or maybe two so I wouldn't call it easy to drink but not hard as well. In the founders lineup which is an amazing one this us my least favorite so far"
"D - Good drinkability, alcohol not real noticeable. A nice dryness in the end from the alcohol, but that's about it. Not exactly my cup of tea, but good for the style."
"Overall, another nice offering from Founder's."
"D - As I said, this style of beer is becoming one of my favorite styles out there, and this one was delicious. Hopefully one day Founders will distribute down here"
"D: One of the most balanced American takes on this style that I have come across. Despite it's higher ABV, its almost dangerously sessionable."
"CHEERS!!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Light carbonation and a medium body leads to good drinkability. Overall, I'm happy that I picked this beer up. I haven't had too many Wee Heavies, but this one has been an enjoyable experience."
"I could enjoy me a few more of these..."
"D- I'm not a huge fan of this style, but this isn't a bad representation of what a scotch ale should be."
"This beer drinks really smooth and I will definitely buy this again."
"Very drinkable for a 8+ abv, and one I always return to."
"D- Drinks like a complex session beer. Obviously, the scotch characteristics (namely the peat) and slight amount of booze make it apparent that this is not in the 5-6% range, but it sure goes down like it could be. I think I just may go grab another"
"Overall a superior scotch ale."
"D: Not a bad sipper (at all) for a big 8.5% Scotch. Toasty warmth with plenty of spice and roasted nuts. The flavor is better than 'good', the drinkability is also better than 'good'...consume with caution, but seek it out."
"Overall, I liked this beer, and recognize that it isn't my style, but my judgement still stands that this beer could use use some re-engineering to make it a little more palatable and a little less confused."
"perhaps could tone down the hoppiness a bit (i know, it's american, but still...), and find a way to hide the alcohol better. but a decent drink nonetheless."
"Alcohol plays a strong role in this, as does the tart malt. Very heavy, but really smooth."
"O: Good beer, but not great. Really needs time to mellow, and then it might become great. So much potential."
"D - Not bad not a big fan of the style but would drink again."
"Deep copper/amber color. Not much of a head. Sweet caramel malts along with a bit of fruitiness. I also began to notice some vanilla about half way through the glass. The sweet malts dominate the taste much as the smell. However, there was an additional butter note along with a hint of vanilla. Loved the creamy feel of this one. I've only had one other brew of this style and found it truly atrocious. I found this to be pretty good."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of tan head. It is ruddy brown in color. It is rich in caramel malts. The taste is much the same with some burnt, smokey flavors on the finish. I am very impressed with this beer. I have not had a lot of this style. It is very drinkable and should go quite nicely with the shepherd's pie that I have prepared."
"drinkability--good. not too heavy, and not hot at all. Would definitely have this one again."
"D Fair to me since it is such a ""big"" beer. 3.0"
"D: Despite the abv, this is a very good scotch ale. A nice brew for this time of year. I could easily sit back with a few of these..."
"D: Good, but not great. I would not order another or buy a sixer."
"Taste is huge. big upfront malt sweetness but bitters in the end with a scotch finish. Sweet then bitter. Really nice and not complicated. This is a straightforward, solid brew from founders. They haven't let me down yet."
"Taste is strong alcohol upfront with roasted burnt caramel and sharp high alpha hops. Not as blended as i would like a scotch ale to be. This is more in your face characteristics. Very strong not for the light hearted beer drinker."
"Is this one of those beers that I should pretend to like? Afterall, it has a high ABV, it's a dark burnt amber in color, and the label/name is cool. The name is actually quite accurate in my opinion...tastes dirty. The smell is truly horrendous. If you let it sit for a few minutes and let the fumes build up in the glass before you take a wiff, wow, it is not pleasant. I think that's what did it for me: the smell. It's a hard to drink beer, but you plunge through it because you paid $10 for a sixer. It would be a challenge to choke down more than one of these tonight. As I work my way to the bottom, the smell is seeming to dissipate somewhat, which helps a tad on drinkability. Sorry, this will never be in my fridge again. I think I'll go have the Samichlaus I've been saving for 2 years."
" Drinkability is good, not great. I don't think i would choose this over old chub. The best feature of this beer is the way the creamy mouthfeel complements the unoffensive smooth malt taste."
"Very much a sipper, as it's a bit hoppier than I usually prefer. This is the first beer of this style I have tried, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. Definitely a serious beer, like the label indicates, not for the faint of heart."
"Medium bodied, fairly smooth, drinkable but more suited to after dinner on a cold winter day. Almost a winter warmer."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a nice beige head and plenty of lacing as it goes down. The smell is quite enticing with overpowering roasted malts, toffee, caramel, a little bit of wood and vanilla, and a bit of brown sugar sweetness. The taste is all the same with the malts dominating. Medium-bodied and smooth, this one was very, very drinkable."
"Overall I liked it, but not above some others of the style. Wouldn't refuse but won't seek again."
"Nice to drink, very tasty. I like it."
"Drinkability is good. Wicked good. It would be easy to put a few of these down in short order."
"smooth mouthfeel, drinkability is a bit lower for me.not as complex as i'd like,but still a good fall/winter beer.it'll warm you up for sure."
"D: Personally, one of these does the job for me."
"Overall Founder's has impressed again. Solid brew."
"Not my favorite Founders beer, but worth a try, especially if you are into malty beers."
"I haven't had a lot of experience with the Scotch Ale style. I don't know if this beer is truly representative of the style or not. Ultimately, I appreciate it more than I enjoy it. It seems like a solid beer that doesn't happen suit my preferences."
"Dark brown with copper highlights. A decent amount of lace considering the higher abv. Smells of sweet malt aromas with a little bit of the alcohol coming through. Not a whole lot on the nose here but what's there is pleasant. Rich flavor dominated by malty flavors of chocolate, molasses, caramel, and a dry bitter licorice flavor on the finish. Feels thick and mouth-coating in a pleasant way. It's definitely a heavy beer in many ways. It's full of hearty roasted flavors backed by a high abv punch, but none of it is overwhelming. A nice beer for sure. Good on a cold, blustery evening."
"D: A balanced and tasty beer. Despite the sweet and malty character, it's very easy to drink. I like the subtle complementary hop notes and how they add a little something to the overall character."
"Thick mouthfeel and very drinkable, the alcohol is barely noticeable. My first Founder's brew, I was expecting a bit more, but I'm not a fan of the style in the first place."
"D: A truly fantastic brew, by far the best Wee Heavy I've had yet. Founders is on quite a streak here, other than Old Curmudgeon, I absolutely LOVED every beer I've had from them. This is just a very well done Ale, if there were more Scotch Ales like this, they would be more popular. A must try for all brew lovers."
"Overall - A very good beer... my first Founders brew and every bit as good as i had hoped... Highly recommended."
"Pours mahogany with little head or retention (at least in this bottle). Off-white head. Smell was strong of caramel, alcohol, and dark fruits. Taste was very similar. Very sweet caramel, some dark fruit, toasted grain and a decent hop presence. Carbonation was very low and mouthfeel was full and velvety. Overall a good beer with a hell of a kick to it. Probably the best I've had of this style."
"D. The drinkability is right on par for a Scotch Ale with an abv. of 8.5. Easy to drink with a strong flavored profile. This beer will stick with you a while.Not intended for the meek."
"Reddish brown color. An aggressive pour gives a 1 finger tan head with little retention and a thin lace on the glass. Smells of sweet malt, caramel, and dark fruit. The taste matches the smell as expected. Has a sweet flavor and slight bitter aftertaste. Rich and full bodied and well carbonated, this is a very drinkable beer, and the 8.3% alcohol is well hidden."
"single picked up at Whole Foods, Reston, VA"
"(D)- A superb Scotch Ale, in fact, perhaps the best one I have tasted thus far in my life. Great variations in the mouthfeel and flavors that keep you guessing. A respectable 8.3% abv that makes this a great fall and winter brew to enjoy when u want a departure from browns/stouts/and porters!"
"Nice beer. Finishes clean and would be easy to drink a couple of these at once. Alcohol is well hidden also. One of the best scotch ales I've had."
"Drinkability: Really good. This is not a style I drink much, (or that many breweries delve into) but this is tasty and interesting. I'll get this again."
"Very tasty beer here and worth the purchase. On par with the other great Scotch Ales out there."
"This is one of the better scotch ales I've tried. Very good."
"Pours a deep, dark red with good carbonation present if you find enough light. Aroma suggest to me, right off the bat, belgian. The delivery was no surprise and tasted pretty dog gone good. Felt good in the mouth and would be a great introduction to belgians to any hoppy ale fan IMO."
"This is one you have to be in the mood for, but if you are looking for something well made and sweet, this will do it for you."
"This is a good example of the style. Holds up well with a variety of foods, and is especially enjoyable on a cool evening. Purchased at Whole Foods in Dublin, Ohio."
"This was a great beer to swirl in the glass and just watch it foam up another inch.Good stuff."
"Overall, this is a very fruity and potent scotch ale. The plum flavors dominate the brew. 1 or 2 of these should be all you need."
"Drinkability: Seems lower than 8.5% abv. Very nice Wee Heavy overall. Just make sure to let this Bastard warm up some as I almost gave a couple lower scores because I was impatient to drink it right out of the fridge."
"Drinkability- This beer is all right not offensive in anyway but just nothing stellar to me, in general I do like the Founders beers but to me this ones just kinda off the mark and not really hitting what I would have expected, 3.0"
"Overall, this was my craft ""gateway beer."" My buddy and I used to grill brats on his deck and drink Dirty Bastard. To be completely honest, we didn't even really know how good of a beer we were drinking. It just tasted good, it was brewed in Michigan, and above all...the name is cool as hell. I also drank this exclusively during the Tigers' 06 World Series run. A classic beer that will always be one of my favorites. Thank you Founders for the memories."
"Not sure if this is courtesy photomike or bulletrain76. Pours a ruddy rusty brown with a pinkish ecru head. Smokey aroma with some acidity, dark bready malts, light prunes, scotch. Flavor is light on peat but still with a nice smoked character. Dark breads make up the heft of the beer with accents of prunes and alcohol. Some mild hop bitterness in the finish. Nice medium full body."
"D: big, rich, delicious, and it's from Founders...go figure. Way to easy to drink."
"MF/D: Amazingly viscous mouthfeel. Smooth, velvety, creamy, and simply perfect in my book. Carbonation is spot on as well. Highly drinkable, just don't chug a sixer"
"M/D: Resiny, syrupy feel with very little carbonation. The alcohol makes its presence a bit to well known, but overall, the experience was pretty good. Not my favorite, but I would come back."
"D: Very easy to drink. Would never think it was over 8% alcohol."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a blood red/brown color (like when you donate and it is in the bag), gross, but accurate description... The head is thin and off white with little lacing and soda type carbonation on the bottom of the glass. This brew has a very sweet aroma from the malt, syrup comes to mind, with figs and nutmeg. The taste is more to chocolate and roasted malts. There is a thickness to this as well. Not exactly what I think of when I am reminded of my time in Scotland, but all in all a tasty brew."
"Poured a deep reddish brown with a two finger head that lasted a bit then dissipated into great lacing. Smell is heavy on the malt, but with distinct fruity quality, somewhat like cherries and plums. Initial sweetness lasted through mid-palate and the drifted into a light slightly dry and bitter finish that lasted and left a pleasant mouthfeel. For the high abv, quite drinkable, although a couple would mellow one out quite nicely. Also, definitely let this one warm up...it improved greatly as it warmed."
"D- not bad for a wee heavy but i have had better. I would have this for dinner at a restaurant but wouldnt spend money on a sixer for it."
"D. I really like this ale, The balance is amazing. I could drink a few of these at the brewery but not an all night session as it is a little strong."
"Appears a slightly hazy chestnut with little head, just a ring around the edge of the glass that eventually disappears to nothing. Smells fruity and malty with some smoke, chocolate, and alcohol. Tastes malty and boozy with notes of cherry, black tea, and bittersweet chocolate. At a warming 8.5%, it's no wonder that the body is on the heavy side and would be best enjoyed during the colder months. Probably wouldn't have too many in one sitting. It's a decent scotch style worth buying from time to time, but probably not nearly as often as that other scotch ale in the can:)"
"Mouthfeel was a little over medium, and the overall drinkability felt more to me like a dark beer (which I guess it is, anyways). It's definitely an American take on the Scottish Ale style, but as with Old Chub, it's a good success. Another in a lineup of excellent brews from Founders; I plan to enjoy this one again when it's cold."
"D: A good beer from a reputable brewery. A little on the pungent side for my personal taste, though I think I'd like to give this one another shot in the winter months."
"crispy mouthfeel, medium-bodied, but with a drinkable feel. light and refreshing yet full of flavor and texture."
"Pretty good, the flavors are not overwhelming. Usually I don't like tasting alcohol directly on the beer, but I guess this one was well combined with the woodsy feeling, so it feels intended more than a flaw."
"Bottom line: highly recommended, *if* you like scotch"
"I went into this one expecting good things from a brewery that to me is very consistant in putting out good brews in a variety of styles. I'll definitely be throwing this one into the regular rotation."
"D- My first beer from Founders. A very good beer but not something I'd have more than one of in a sitting."
"This is one heck of a beer! Perhaps my favorite Wee Heavy. Tons of character to offer, big aroma and flavor, extremely easy to drink, and all around amazing."
"D- Usually I am more of a fan of hoppy brews but this malt bomb is definitely worth trying."
"D = This is a pretty good beer, it has perhaps a bit too much of a bite to be truly drinkable, but I think even a slight amount of age probably takes that off."
"Wow, I find I am liking almost everything Founders; and Dirty Bastard is no exception. Pours out a deep red with a small, cream colored head. Candy sweet aroma, toffee?, maybe. A malty sweetness covers a little alcohol aftertaste just right. Man, this hit the spot with its earthy flavor, hard to describe. Nice feel, a bit heavy, but not syrupy. This is a man's drink because of the alcohol taste, but I say bring me another."
"Drinkability - Pretty good, can't taste the alcohol much at all, could drink a few of these. Good for abv."
"Review# 500! Man, I need to get a life. Oh well, this is a very tasty beer. Needs a little more smoky flavors for me though. I still enjoy this very much. Something I would recommend."
"It's a terrific balance in my opinion, but then again, I like hops."
"D- I would have no problem drinking four of these, I have to restrain myself from taking huge gulps"
"Pours a cloudy dark red/brown with minimal head. Almost looks like a iced sun tea but just a tad darker. Swirling it creates a thin off-white creamy head that doesn't stick around. Nose is sweet with a nice fruitiness and a fleeting hint of vanilla? Initial sweet flavor that becomes slightly bitter and tea-like in the finish.. Good medium-thick mouth feel. Malty and fruity. Complex, with slightly different flavors with every sip, especially as it warms a bit. Overall very good. The first Scottish Ale I really enjoyed."
"This beer sets the bar for all other Scottish Ales in my mind."
"Pours a surprisingly transparent brown. Very modest tan head recedes quite quickly. My previous experience with the style caused me to expect a more opaque and rather smoky brew. This one didn't meet either one of those qualities. Pronounced sweet malt flavor fades as alcohol heat shows its bite. Finishes with tanin like flavors. Much lighter than I anticipated but still quite drinkable. Could used have used a bit more smokey bite."
"Like I said, one of my favorites. This one never dissapoints."
"brown with reddish highlights. nice creamy tan head. caramel, dark dried stone fruits, and smoky peat in the nose. taste is big sweet dark fruitcakey-like malts with more bitterness for the style than you'd expect, yet the malt predominates nonetheless. round, full mouthfeel. not at all cloying, the bitterness, peaty smokiness, and dark roasted malts combine to balance this out. very complex and interesting; a sipper. would make a fine pairing with real bbq and many cigars."
"D - Very good and drinkable for a Scotch Ale, but I almost want my Scotch Ale to scare me into only having one."
"d - Might be fine for the style but too lightly masked for me to buy again."
"Poured from the bottle to a pint glass, it pours a very dark red with a brown mixed in with it. Has virtually no head. Leaves little to no lacing down the sides. Smells very sweet, some caramel in there as well as many other sweet smelling things I can't quite put my finger on. Very sweet though. Taste is pretty typical of a Scotch Ale or at least compared to the ones I've had. Taste is good, kind of malty I guess. Has some caramel that comes through in the taste as well as something else that is a little sweet. On my first taste of this one I got some alcohol but it was faint and I didn't get it after that. I think the alcohol is pretty well hidden which is pretty good for how high it is. Really drinkable beer and really enjoyable. I think it's one of the better Scotch Ales I've tried."
"Dirty Bastard is a big, thick, sweet beer, but it manages to avoid being cloying."
"D - Solid Scotch style Wee Heavy, but not one of my favorites from Founders in the grand scheme of things. However, it does drink quite well for a beer in the 8% region. I'd definitely like to try this on tap or cask in the future."
"With as much going on in this brew, it's great how it all comes together with a smooth somewhat creamy mouthfeel. the whole package is incredibly enjoyable and easy to drink. Fantastic brew!!"
"Dark almost cola colored brown with lots of suspended particles visable. Slight creamy tan head that leaves some nice looking lace on rhe glass. The nose is mild, dark fruit and cocoa. The flavor is vanilla, dark fruit and oaky bourbon with warm alcohol and tea leaf bitterness in the finish. Medium full bodied and mildly carbonated. A nice sipper."
"D: Really good. Makes a great nightcap or a party session beer. Strong enough to hold up to food, but great on its own as well."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. The taste is very rich and full while still being pretty light and smooth."
"I picked up a six pack of this today and realized I had neglected to review it. This beer pours a cloudy mahogany with a small offwhite head that quickly disappears. Smells of malt, sweet caramel and honey. Tastes follows the smell with huge malt and biscuit flavors. This one is not as sweet as other scotch ales I have tried which I like. The mouthfeel has mediium body, is nicely carbinated and creamy. Drinkability is good and is limited only by this beers high abv. Hands down my favorite scotch ale to date."
"I'm now half-way done with this bottle, and I'm liking the beer a bit more. The mouthfeel doesn't seem as robust as before; perhaps it is mellowing out as the beer warms? I like more this way, and have increased the mouthfeel rating from 3.5 to 4.0."
"This poured a hazy mahogany with tan head. It smelled like rich roasted barley and cocoa beans, with some orange and oak and molasses. It tasted like caramel and molasses and roasted cocoa beans, with some orange and oak and vanilla. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a wonderful malty flavor with great silky body. It was nicely clean and hid the alcohol pretty well, so it was very easy to drink. Not quite my favorite for this style, but certainly in the top half. Nice brew!"
"Overall, not to bad of a scotch. I really enjoyed it for the most part. I am looking forward to my next bottle, but probably not tonight."
"Drink ability is good. Flavorful beer, very malty, just the way i like em. Would buy, if available in my part of country"
"D= nice. Pretty good beer. Ill buy it again next time I got a scottish craving. Not too fantastical though."
"D - Despite the high ABV, one scarecly notices it until the ale is half way finished."
"Pours a deep red copper color with nice amounts of carbonation and a little bit of sediment. A nice 3/4 inch head sits on top and leaves good lacing. Smells of sweet malts, boozey, candied figs, glorious. Light to medium bodied. Hops perfectly balanced with the sweet malt. Finish is great alternating from sweet to hoppy. A touch of smoked and/or roasted malts is noted as it warms. Such a complex simple beer. Keep up the good work!"
"if you gravitate towards this style you will drink the stuff out of this, if your trying something new it might take a minute, but if you like. it will grow on you fast and it will go down smooth."
"A very nice and drinkable bottle, here. The ABV may keep it out of session range, but it's still delicious and goes down easy."
"the hoppiness keeps this beer crisp yet light. not as syrupy sweet as other scotch ales. a very good beer but different than the norm for the style."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden in this one. I would have never guessed it was as high as it is. Its sweet but not overly sweet so it goes down pretty fast."
"Mmm, yum. Founders makes some good beers. I am impressed."
"I'm not very familiar with the style, or the brewery. But as I get more accustomed to both, I will come back and give this one another look. But as it stands, this is a solid brew."
"Textbook example of the style with very bold flavors here. Really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability- this is a big boy's sipper."
"D - This is a treat of a beer, and while very tasty, only one at a time is plenty. The alcohol is subdued, but not completely hidden."
"As usual, another great Founder's brew. Salute!"
"Edit: I feel I'm being generous with the ""points"" here. Compared to Alesmith its got nothing, but in comparison to others it is as rated, but is definitely second class to the Alesmith."
"Very good brew. I mean, I'd expect no less from Founder's - welcome to Minnesota by the way! - but this is a solid brew that sets the bar nicely for the Scotch Ales that will follow it."
"Flavor upfront was of a sweet dark fruit flavor of malt that balances with the background of spices, caramel, and toffee. Carbonation was not allot but brew did not need the help to push the flavors out. Drinkability for me on this brew is high has the brew has low carbonation and mellow flavor that does not destroy my taste buds. Will become a staple in my fridge."
"Mouthfeel is is medium heavy bodied and smooth with light carbonation."
"D- This was a delicious beer. I was crazy for sitting on it this long but it was great."
"Oddly enough nothing like the style, it's certainly an interesting take on the style, but not particularly one I enjoy."
"Very smooth."
"The taste is surprisingly more of hops than anything. Way more than I'm used to in a wee heavy. If it weren't labled as a scotch ale I'd never put in this category. Divorcing it from this category it's a very pleasantly hoppy beer with a fairly heavy abv at pretty good price."
"A very nice beer, good as an evening ender, I do not want a bunch, but one or two are great"
"-Oelergud"
"Served in an faceted mug."
"Overall I would say this is a very good Scotch Ale, little different from many I have had but in a good way. I like this beer."
"Closer to a Brown IPA than a Wee Heavy, but a good tasting interesting brew."
"The hop bitternes obviously chase this beer beyond what is expected of the style. But it's not all bad, it begins to take on an Arrogant Bastard demeanor, but with less aggression and balance. The beer does edge on cola-like flavors at times, but ultimately stay with the malty, bready, toasty, melanoidin-rich character albeit very bitter."
"D: Easy to drink due to the creamy feel, but the alcohol is a bit hefty. I personally like Oskar Blues Old Chub a lot more, but this is a good beer."
"D: Not quite sure what to make of this one. It was way too harsh for me initially, but it eventually kind of grew on me. I don't think I'd seek this one out, though."
"Very interesting beer. Looking forward to trying more Founders now that they are available in Virginia."
"Nice scotch style ale, nothing fancy but very, very solid for an American offering. Nice complexity of flavors will have me enjoying more of these."
"A solid Scotch Ale, but a little drier than I've had in the past. Worth a try."
"Poured a nice thick head and gradually declined. Smells quite strong as far as alchohol content. Bit of a robust barley in it. Tastes like butterscotch flavors. But wow is this beer a kick. It's a nice strong scotch ale thats light on the stomach but a smack in the face. Yeah thats right you're drunk. Very nice scotch I find it to be right up there with warped speed scotch ale."
" If you're hungry, drink Founders Dirty Bastard."
"This is a nice creamy beer as it sits in your mouth. Drinks really smoothly."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture is quiet and reserved, yet slick and foamy enough to be enjoyable. Due to a less-than-stellar showing in the taste department, I'd choose something else when the craving for a Wee Heavy presents itself. My least favorite so far from Founders' impressive lineup."
"D - Very high - I could sit with several of these. Once again, Founders does not dissapoint with this one."
"Overall it's a decent beer, but I'd call it Scottish-style over Scotch-style ale. It doesn't have the body, or the sweetness (perhaps because of a little bit too much bitterness) for the style, and the hops are overdone by a bit. The alcohol level is right, but there's just not enough malt to back it. Dirty Bastard? Well, a bastard of the style is right at least."
"D- A solid brew that is well within the style, but... Not my favorite scotch ale but definitely worth a try."
"I've never really thought much either way about scotch ales, but this was quite nice. Founders is really impressing me."
"I've had many pints of this brew in my day. It's not necessarily one of my favorite Founders beers, but that's only because they have so many amazing beers in their line-up. Dirty B would easily defeat almost any beer from another brewery in my mind. In other words, I think it's an amazing beer, period... but not in my top 5 Founders beers."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and would drink it again. I would highly recommend any beer from Founders."
"D: For me this brew is more of a beer to sit and sip on for a while. Goes down a lot smoother than I thought it would considering its ABV."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a hazy brown with a moderate white head. The aroma is sweet with heavy alcohol notes. The taste has a whiskey like kick up front that mellows out sweet in the finish, there is even a little ""alcohol burn"" in the middle. The brew is medium bodied and very smooth. I liked this one."
"Gorgeous display of a Scot interpretation. A thick as hell head floats above a dark, ruby blood amber bod. Sweet dark fruit rise above the beige crown. Spicy figs, sweet dark malt, molasses, and hints of rum gently rub the nose. A soft, creamy body gives way to grape, chocolate covered cherries, dates, burnt sugar, caramel and wood. Warming at the end with booze peaking then retreating. A long, wet finish ties together one of the best renditions of the island. Bravo."
"Overall, I really liked this beer."
"Future outlook: Rock solid across the board. Another winner from Founders that will be perfect for when I want something malty and slightly sweet, and perhaps for pairing with some deserts."
"D- Goes down great, but you have to watch out for the ABV."
"D: It's a heavy beer, and for all that I don't like its sweetness I haven't had to pour one out, and I've never had to struggle to finish one. That said, this is definitely a beer to drink as a single nightcap, or to follow up with something lighter and more balanced."
"Dark amber, almost brown body with giant ice cream head. Aroma of slight spice, alcohol, footprints of cinnamon, some grass. Thick mouthfeel like a oil. Tastes of toffee, malt, echoes of alcohol, medicinal undertones, and hops from center to finish. A slick oily aftertaste with some spice qualities. Highly drinkable, especially as a warmer."
"Drinkability: Moderately high -- this is a great Scotch Ale, probably the second best that I've had (next to FFF Robert The Bruce). It's a fun beer to drink that is well balanced in the three primary flavors that I picked up on, but the ABV is a little higher than I thought and it packs a bit of a punch. While Scotch Ales aren't necessarily my favorite style, it's growing on me and this is a great beer that does the style justice."
"not bad, probably not my style. very strong alcohol flavor, not hid very well."
"Notes- this isn't a bad beer, by any stretch, and much more in keeping with the style than I was afraid it might be. But it also didn't knock my socks off, and I think it has some significant weaknesses."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black body with a one-finger tan head that sticks around for awhile. A rich malt smell, roasted, some toated or burnt malt/woody notes, caramel, bitter chocolate are all in there. This is one the smoothest and creamiest wee heavys I've had, but it is not overly slick. Even has a smooth, semi-sweet finish. Taste is comprised of a balance of roasted, caramel, possibly coffee, and some bready flavors (which lead to a mild chewiness). Also a slightly drying/warming sensation on the tongue as beer goes down thanks to the high ABC. Even a little sticky and some minor fruit flavors from hops."
"As the brew warms up it's hop profile brings out a whole 'nother level of complexities."
"Drinks better as it warms - becomes a little bit more complex. Yet another great beer from Founders."
"D- Fantastic beer. I could definitely put a few of these down before they put me down."
"Over all, outstanding. Was even better fresh on tap at the Sidecar during Philly Beer Week."
"D: Goes down very easy for a wee heavy. If it wasn't for the price I'd be looking for it a lot more often."
"I couldn't drink too many of these, but one is hard to pass up."
"Overall a very good scotch ale. I enjoyed the flavors although I wish the sweetness of the grain came through a little more as this was quite a dry beer."
"D - Over the top. Would not drink more that one at a time if there were other options. Good beer, though!"
"D- Not a session beer at all but two and threw for me. This would go great with some steak and potatoes. Would like to try on tap to see any differences. Founder's can do no wrong in my eyes, they really have the dark beer styles down pact. Scotch ales are not really my thing but this is an exception."
"Very smooth and creamy brew. It coats my palate ever so softly. Drinks very well. Taste is of roasted caramel, hints of smokiness, slight fruitiness, and finishes just slightly bitter. No lingering bite, just enough bitterness to know it's there. It's a heavy brew in my mind. I wouldn't see myself drinking more than 1 or 2 at a time. Well done. Recommend."
"pours a dark red/brown color with almost no head and good lacing... the smell is ok its kind of mettalic, sour, and bitter not inviting... the taste makes up for the latter.. it is strong bitter hops with an earthy murky oily hop taste that i like ... it gets more complex and taste better as it warms... the mouthfeel is full and robust it coates the tongue and stomach with a malt hoppines and a smooth alcohol burn.... this is another great offering from founders one i will imbibe once a week or so.. its a great scotch ale and a little different not for the faint.. but for those who want to try a different brew.."
"The name says it all....Dirty Bastard. Excellent!"
"A little bitter for a scotch ale, but very good indeed."
"Disappointing effort by a great brewery. Esters are over the top, and the diacetyl that pokes through just adds to the distraction."
"D: definitely noticeable alcohol and some heft to the body but a nice sipper."
"The alcohol has a bigger presence than I like in Scotch Ales but it's still a really good sipping beer."
"""That's right, this baby was made in Grand Rapids, Michigan!"""
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but not too shabby. Kind of tea-like as well, actually, with suds. Overall not the mooost drinkable brew unless you have a sweet tooth, but as I said before- for the style? It works. And come on, what a name for a beer."
"Notes: One of the better Wee Heavies out there. Founders never disappoints."
"The smoke and peat give way to gentle dark fruits as the beer sidles down my throat and into the aftertaste. Plenty of malt here, and a healthy alcohol tinge considering it's only 8.3 on the booze-o-meter. Still, it slides down easy and definitely tends toward the drinkable side of the aisle. A likable beer with an amusing name. Check and mate."
"Deep reddish brown body, hazy with sediment. Short puffy cap of foam, sort of imploded on itself. Decent retention. Malty, nutty, almost smoky aroma. Very smooth, caramel and peat smoke dominate. Lingering bitterness with bready rye and shortbread notes. Ultimately very drinkable. Worth a repeat buy for sure, try to find it fresh!"
"I've got to say, I was ready to rip this beer apart after having wee heavies in Glasgow. However, this was just not the case. Well balanced, flavourful, smooth. Chalk it up as another great offering from Founders."
"I am normally not a Scotch ale drinker but this beer might have turned me on to the style. Very flavorful and easy-drinking."
"D: If it wasn't as sweet I could drink a bunch of these. I could see revisiting this beer after a bit to see if it changes or my senses change a bit."
"Some filminess deepens the chocolate brown colored base, dusky yellow rims with a touch of zinc orange. The head is on the thinnish side, evaporates quick enough, lacing more persistent. Restrained nose of orange/lemon citrus, apricot pits, round malts alongside non-intrusive hops, pine resin, bread and a slight infusion of dried flowers. Medium-bodied, smooth with enough carbonation to keep a steady forward pacing. Semi-sweet with baking spices, orange peel, honey glazed bread, pine, none of these have the depth nor tenacity to overshadow the hops component. Never bitter, maltiness persists. Pleasing tightening through the finish. Unassuming complexity, no sense in not enjoying the natural fluidity."
"D- It's easy to put back even with the higher ABV%."
"First impression: rich, full-bodied and earthy. Starts out sweet, malts dominate with a very coating, wet mouthfeel. Transitions into dark fruit and coffee/roasted,with some dark chocolate, finishes up with a big earthy hop presence. Huge beer, big bready/biscuity presence, very complex with a myriad of flavors, I really am not doing a good job at picking them out. Lively mouthfeel makes for a comfortable, easy drink. Hoppiness is at first disconcerting, but overall helps out the experience by adding balance. A solid wee heavy, not my favorite beer but a very interesting change of pace."
"A really good brew from a great brewery, and lovers of this style should seek it out."
"Drinkability is excellent. Abv is well hidden and this stuff just flows into your mouth, down your throat, and into your heart"
"D: I am not the biggest fan of scotch ales but damn this is good. Zero hint of the ABV. I drank a bit of this over vacation with no idea about the ABV. Another good beer from Founders."
"D: Very good. The 8.3% ABV will catch up to you sooner or later but until then I will keep drinking this brew! I would make this my go to readily available Scotch Ale!"
"D: Very enjoyable, I'm saving my last bottle from this case for another year or so"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Sweet toffee and bitter resin. Medium-light in body, sweet yet crisp on the palate. Firmly hoppy with a very pleasant lingering bittersweet finish."
"Dark mahogany color, with a thin light tan head. Sweet woody,earthy aroma.Taste changes as it warmes,Caramel,smoke,sweet fruit ""like peeches"" and a hint of grain. Smooth mouthfeel,nice lacing, sometimes I get a little boozy hint on the finish,but in a good way. Very Solid."
"Deep rich mahogany. This beer looks very serious. The thick tannish head and thick lacing are very impressive. Fantastic looking. Smells of roasted caramel malt, strongly. It is malt from start to finish. A long malty finish. Sweet dried fruit and caramel. The body is full and oh so creamy. I wouldn't drink this all day, I don't even think I'd drink two 12 0z bottles on the same night, but it is heavenly while your sipping on the one wee heavy of the night."
"Really an awesome brew here, which completely reverses the typical malt to hop drink. I'm a huge fan!"
"Notes: When I first had this a couple years ago, I wasn't much of a fan. It's fun to revisit beers only to discover how much you like them."
"D- Very drinkable, solid beer."
"Very nice brew! Not cloying like many scotch ales. It does the style proud."
"Wow. wish I had a few more... this is a beautiful and rich scotch ale, robust and full of flavor. warming alcohol and a beautiful flavor profile makes this one really drinkable, without seeming overly boozy. Definitely seek it out should you get the chance."
"An experience to savor. Yea I thirst for more, but one of these and its kaputz. Break one of these out when you're ready for a cerveza especial."
"Drinkability is high, with a lot of character and ABV."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with a thin, foamy beige head. Hints of malt, alcohol, and hops in the aroma. Has a very earthy taste in which the hops nicley balance out the roasted chocolate maltiness. Nice beer!"
"Drinkability is rather tolerable for an 8.3% ABV brew. I need to find another Scottish Style Ale very soon!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and drinkability is fairly high. The intimidating title of this beer is a little misleading because it is very smooth and enjoyable."
"D - I'm in love with Founder's...they hit the nail on the head with this one...a good session beer"
"This is a great beer, another homerun from Founders"
"The taste is maximally complex, strong, and full palated. There is plenty of ABV in the beer, but it isn't so strong that it totally detracts from what else is going on in the beer. There is a roasted malt, brown sugar base to the beer. There is a very clear smoky, slightly peaty quality to the beer. And then add some liqueur soaked cherry flavors, some charred bits in the finish, and then some hop in the finish. There is a bit of carbonation in the beer, it isn't flat, the mouthfeel is a bit oily, and the aftertaste has a tad bit of throaty burn from the ABV, but not over the top. This is a substantial Scotch Ale. The style isn't my favorite but for those who like the style and want a beer also making a significant statement, then seek no further because this beer is your destination. L'Chaim."
"Overall - Wow! This is one good brew. It makes you want to slow down and savor the experience : )"
"Pours a dark murky brown with lots of reddish highlights when held to a direct light. The head is a couple fingers of thick creamy tan foam that leaves some chunky lace as it falls to a thin covering that holds firm for the duration. Smells of dark fruits,old leather and toffee. The flavors are very nice. Mostly medium roasted malt upfront,with some whiskey notes and subtle hints of peanut brittle. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of a medium rare steak that melts in your mouth...thick and meaty,yet soft and effortless. This 12oz bottle went down so fast I will have to revisit this one,Founders is quickly gaining my trust."
"interesting higher gravity twist on the style."
"Mouthfeel is very carbonated. Drinkability is okay. I doubt I'd have more than one or two."
"The name Dirty Bastard doesn't make any sense to me. This beer isn't harsh or brutish or even all that strong, it's refined, delicate, and exceedingly well-crafted. It's rare to find a beer with such a tight balance - nothing in this beer seems out of place. The many wonderful flavors cycle through the limelight. I'd love to get it on tap someday. Very nice."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is just right, nice mouthfeel. Decent drinkability. This one I served pretty warm, maybe a bit cooler can mask some of the booze. Overall a decent brew."
"D - crisp, clean and easy to drink."
"D - Not a huge fan of this beer, and the bit alcohol flavor is a major deterrant. The bitterness is also on the crazy high side for the malt bomb that this should be. I doubt I'll bother getting this again in the near future. Plenty of better examples."
"Pours a hazy brown with a ruby hue.. some head but not much.. it sort of resembles a cola, the mouthfeel is similar to cola as well, with a refreshing crispness. Smell is mostly sweet with malt and a bit roasty. Smells a bit of alcohol, this also is evident in the flavor and aftertaste, which maintains a boozey warmth and a bit of a sour whiskey-ish..well.. sourness (but not much, just enough to keep the sweetness from being that of, say, a doppelbock or such). A good amount of hop bitterness in the flavor, as well. There is a roasted quality to the flavor, a malty sweetness, some caramel-like sweetness and, again, a liquor-like feeling. Mouth is well carbonated and on the lighter side of medium. Its very easy to drink and quite refreshing. If you don't like whiskey or scotch or other brown liquors at all then that characteristic of it may turn you off a bit, but its very nice to sip from a snifter."
"Since Scotch Ale is probably my fav beer of all time, when I see one, I try it. This one didn't disappoint. I thought it had just a tad too much hops than most Scotch Ales I've had. Other than that though, it was a decent brew. I would have liked to have seen more use of strong malt taste. Then again, everyone seems to like it the way it is, so I guess Founder's knows what it's doing."
"Mouthfeel is medium, but somewhat lighter than expected. Moderate level of carbonation. Everything comes together wonderfully and I could see this being great with various cold weather foods. Recommended brew."
"Mouthfeel is rich and biting at the same time. Its quite a full bodied beer, but so simply delicious its hard to put down. I really am enjoying this style beer, and this one holds its own with the best of them (Orkney Skull Splitter). If I could just get my hands on some Kentucky Burbon Breakfast stout!"
"Overall: Pretty dry and hoppy for the style, but hey its american. Very enjoyable beer, pour at a cooler temperature and allow to warm to discover all the different nuances."
"D - A wee bit heavy? Haha. Seriously though, big flavours but feels a bit coarse."
"Overall: decent stuff"
"D - Great beer. It is a lot better than I was expecting."
"D - I could have more than one.. it's pretty smooth. I'd rather have some others in this category though."
"A highly detectable alcohol presence keeps the beer from becoming too drinkable, and the dry, cardboardy flavor that emerged hurt what would have otherwise been a nice beer."
"Um how many characters do I have now? I think I need at least twohundredandfifty."
"Drinkability: A pleasure to drink... I'm debating whether choosing this one over Old Chub in the future but this one is definitely a winner."
"Pretty nice wee heavy. Beautifull murky brown with a silky tan head and nice lacing. Nose has some smokey malts and perhaps a little chocolate. Taste is siilar, nothing outstanding, but a well balanced brew. Thick creamy body matches teh style nicely."
"Fullish in body with light carbonation, Dirty Bastard is extremely sippable and satisfying."
"D: Overall, this a drinkable beer. The taste is complex and the other elements are well constructed."
"Second tasting: I obviously revisited this beer, and my impression of it did go up from an already high grade. I am looking forward to another tasting."
"Drinkability: The abv% is a little up there, but not really for the style, so that's fine. A step up over the bottled version, in my opinion, as the hops really add a lot to this one. The great maltyness of the bottled version is still there though - definitely a winner from Founders. Recommended."
"pretty drinkable. i wouldnt have more than two in a night but still would have another."
"D- this one is unlike the other beers of this style ive enjoyed. much more over the top and aggressive. some might like that, but im glad i only got this one as a single instead of a sixer. its just not for me."
"Pours a dark brown with a 1 finger thick tannish, brown head that leaves nice lacing. Smells like dark caramel and roasted malts. Hints of vanilla and toffee, slight alcohol aroma. Malt flavor is very complex. Roasted malts take the forefront followed by the nice caramel malt sweetness. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Alcohol hits as I swallow and it goes down warm. Good hop spiceyness as well, plays nicely with the malt. This is my first experience with a scotch ale but an enjoyable one at that. The high alcohol is a nice plus, but it drinks lighter than its 8.3%. I'd try this again. Cheers!!"
"Pours a very hazy dark brown color with orange highlights on the edges of the glass. Not much in the way of foam and lacing is light. Nice boozy, fruity aroma, lots of dark malt notes in the nose. Malty, malty, and more malty. Roasted malts galore on the tongue, hints of chocolate, burnt caramel and toffee, a slight hop bitterness towards the end. Some background notes of coffee. Semi-sweet up front and dry on the finish. Very well-balanced. Thick and smooth feeling, just dances across the tastebuds. Carbonation is low which is perfect for the style. This brew is just ridiculously tasty. If you're a malt lover, this one is worth seeking out."
"Color is medium brown, like a Coke, with slight head. Smells lightly of malt and caramel. Tastes of malt, caramel, toffee, just a bit too much sweetness for me (but that's how I feel about the style in general). A fine scotch ale, which for me means it's not as sweet as some of them. Not one I'd like to drink more than one of, due to the sweetness, but fans of the style will like this one."
"This is another fantastic beer from Founders. Keep up the great work."
"Overall, a pretty good beer that definitely tastes of whiskey. I would try this again...pick it up if you have the chance."
"Pours a reddish brown in color. Theres a nice half inch of beige head sitting atop after the pour. It quickly recedes to a ring of froth. Smell is wonderful. Very incredible malts and a nice scotch like, peaty scent. Taste is more velvety smooth malt. Some toffee and some liquor like qualities. Very smooth with just a hint of hop bite at the end. Incredible beer. No hint of the ABV while drinking. I could drink this all the time."
"Glassware - Large red wine glass"
"As I sip this and put my thoughts to paper and glass, I can't wait to rturn to my trusty Cab glass for more. A very enjoyable sipping brew that drinks quite lightly."
"Nicely done, and nice to see the style so out front from a high profile brewery."
"Pours a deep brown hue, that appears black at first but when put to the light reveals a reddish brown color not far short of black. Nose is oaky with hints of cherry and sweet maltiness. Roasted coffee and chocolate can be detected as well. A very complex and robust scent profile. Taste is quite rounded with a malty sweetness. Coffee, cherry, nut and flavors come through. Reall has scotch tastes to it: a smoky and woody profile fit for the harsh terroir of scotland. A medium-to-full bodied ale that has a long malty finish. Drinkable but a bit heavy and not something that can be consumed readily despite the great smell and taste."
"The taste is also above par for the style, with some caramel & toffee added to the chocolatey goodness. Some malty peat notes pair with a semi-bitter, floral hoppiness on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and nicely carbonated, with a velvety-smooth finish and a delicate sourness. All in all, a good brew -recommended- that I'm likely to try again."
"Drinkability is great. There are a lot of flavors working and there's something different every sip. Try this out if you can get it."
"D: Can definitely catch the alcohol from the sweetness in the malts but I find the smokines to be the strongest and most appealing quality. Not a favorite but probably has its place and represents the style quite well."
"Founders has finally landed in North Carolina! On-tap at Raleigh's Flying Saucer. Served a dark brown with ruby highlights and a thin diminishing head. Aoma rich toasted malts, burnt caramel, molasses, and dried fruit. The taste is dominated by dried fruits and burnt toast. The beer is on the heavy side of medium and is a bit on the sour side. This one is certainly worth trying and appreciable for the style, but it's not really my cup of tea."
"A sipper beer for sure, but real easy to drink for the style."
"12 ouncer, no freshness/brewing date/best before etc. info to be had. Typical founders stubby bottle and twist off cap. Pours a rich shade of dark rummy amber, clear, under a dark tan, tightly knit head and scattered light lacing. Nose is richly of malts, nuts and a hint of smoked up bourbon. This one is tasty, bold and loaded with darker malts, smoke, nuts, some wood and then a long smooth, malty sweet and also drying finish. Big time beer from a consistently top notch brewery."
"Very nice take on a scotch ale, one of the best I've had. I wasn't aware of the ABV when I ordered it; next time will likely take it slower."
"Pours a hazy, deep copper color with a tan head. In the aroma, a sweet malt and nice peet/ scotch notes. In the taste, a bold sweet malt, a peet like flavor in the end. A smooth a medium mouthfeel, with a sweet to dry peet and alcohol aftertaste. Nice scotch notes, alcohol is nice and not overbarring. Big, but not so much."
"Real nice drinker. Feels much under the 8.3. Solid beer I would love to see on tap, but more than likely not one I would trade for."
"Drinkability: This beer doesn't finish particularly well, though it's tasty while drinking, and quite easy to drink. That's a little dangerous, at 8.5%, and this beer takes no pains to hide the alcohol. A decent beer that I wouldn't go out of my way to get again."
"An excellent beer that is one of my founders favorites. COuld of had a few more, although the socohol would have gotten to me, and would definately revisit."
"Killer Scotch Ale, plenty of bite coupled with a great smoothness. Heavy malt aroma, bitter-sweet. Solid pour, good head and lacing but too many floaties detract from the overall visuals. Smooth on the palate with a calm alcohol burn, just how I like it. Impressive flavor with lots of sweet malts, molasses & brown sugar mixed with a slight bitterness. Powerful and inviting, oh my this is a nice cool weather brew."
"yum!"
"D- A great example of this style of beer. I would definitely drink this again."
"A very drinkable and delicious beer; I'm looking forward to having this one again."
"D: very nice scotch ale. perfect flavors for my palate. really enjoyable."
"this is so tasty and it's nicely done. I haven't had many scotch ales but this is just a fucking awesome beer with a new introduction to flavors to me that makes me really really love this beer in of it's self. AWESOME!"
"M + D: A lighter body than what might be expected from the flavour. Perhaps a little bit watery, but no love lost on that. Still a sipper, though, and while the mouthfeel might not feel all that huge, the alcohol content is getting there. Nonetheless, good for another!"
"D - Aggressive, but enjoyable... To be savored and not rushed... Not a beer for the week of heart... Will catch you by surprise of you're not expecting it..."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, maybe too easy. This one could come back to bite you if you aren't carefull."
"D: Decent drinkability, a little tough at times makes this a slow warm sipper."
"Wow wow wow. A very tasty scotch ale, so props go to Founder's for this one. Rich taste, low carbonation, appealing aroma, very easy to drink. Watch yourself however as the ABV is 8.3% (but what do you expect from a Scotch Ale??) A very dark beer and as the name states, hey it's a dark and Dirty Bastard! We just like to say the name here in Grand Rapids! Give it a try, even the bottle is worth reading! Ooonly if ye dar becom da dirty bastard eh!"
"D - Easy to drink."
"Poured a deep amber to brown with a small white head but it didnt stick around very long. Smells like a roasted malt and scothcy, like your typical wee. Lightly hopped with some light roasted malt. Overall, this is a very good scottish/scotch ale. Pretty drinkable, and easy to enjoy."
"Decent heavyness, good slick mouthfeel, but I think the higher abv takes away the drinkability of this. Good but not great for the style overall."
"Worth trying & I'm glad I did. Wouldn't want a second one in the same sitting. I don't think I'd seek it out again but if offered I wouldn't turn it down."
"D- Very wonderful brew. I've had it in the bottle, went to their Pub had it on tap and loved it so I brought a growler home with me. Easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"D - At 8.3%, this beer is ridiculously drinkable, largely in part due to the really great hop profile that keeps the alcohol from burning; replacing it with a crispness and dry bitterness. Although this isn't at the top of my Scotch Ale list, it's two thumbs up for me. If only it had a touch of smoke or peat in the malt, it would really add a masterful dimension."
"Drinkability: One of so many, delicious American craft brews that will sneak up on you and put you on your ass."
"Poured to a brown color and brownish head. Looked rather thick when pouring. Not a lot of head retention. Smelled sweet like caramel also of coffee and malt. Smell was good. Tasted very sweet almost to sweet. Like strong caramel and coffee. I could still taste it in my mouth several minutes after finishing the last one. It had a flavor that lasts. Felt heavy in the mouth, and carbonation was right. After a couple you could really tell that the alcohol content was high. Got a good buzz after two. You would have to be real carefull when drinking several of these."
"Dark, ruddy brown with a small, creamy, off-white, quickly diminishing head. Smell is malty and sweet with a little bit of smoke. Taste follows suit by being malty and sweet... VERY sweet. In fact, I think they take it too far. This is so sweet and syrupy that it tastes more like a desert. I love a good scotch ale and know their malt sweetness can be a bit over-the-top compared to other styles, but this is over-the-top even for the style. The mouthfeel was heavy, and not in a good way. I just have to say I was not impressed by this one at all, and think it's a bad example of the style."
"My only complaint is that I wanted more smoke, but this is an excellent beer."
"Carbonation is on the low side. This is a nice full-bodied brew that I enjoyed slowly sipping. This would be nice on a cold winter night, but it was just as enjoyable in the air conditioning on this 90 degree evening. The sweetness did become a bit much toward the bottom of the glass, so I probably wouldn't want more than one of these in a row. But overall a very enjoyable brew, highly recommended."
"In my opinion this is an often over looked style. With examples like this, I don't understand why."
"12 oz bottle, twist off. The Dirty Bastard pours a brilliant ruby redish brown color, it sports a small quickly dissipating tan head, some sticking and no visible carbonation. The nose is that of sweet earthy malts, hay and wood notes, cherry, ripe red apples and other fruits. It tastes of creamy roasted malts with some wet woody nuances. Cherry and a bit of citrus fruits and some hop bitterness on the finish. The brew has a medium body which is semi coating, not grainy, not sugary sweet, very very smooth. at 8.2% this beer goes down easy! Dont like Scotch Ales? Try this one or its back to the loch with you!!"
"Wonderful wee heavy! Founders are now on my ""got to get more of"" list."
"D: Due to the higher ABV and the lingering alcohol on the tongue, this is better suited to a winter day as a warm up drink."
"This was quite good, though maybe not exactly what I expected from a Wee Heavy. In any case, it is a very drinkable brew and it was a good deal. $8.73 for a six pack is a bargain these days."
"Pours almost garnet color, deep, rich. No substancial head, some lacing. Wonderful aroma, very sweet slightly alcoholic. Taste is a balance of malty sweet and caramel with just a slight undertone of chocolate. Very hearty brew to drink. This works well with lamb or with a tangy sheeps milk cheese. By far my favorite scotch ale."
"This is a real nice beer. Lot of different flavors going on that blend together nicely."
"I'll definately be buying this one again."
"Pours a dark brown with a creamy tan head. Decent retention. Aroma is rum soaked fruit, a touch of brown sugar, and toasted and roasted malt. Taste is very malty. The malt is pretty roasted with some hints of bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, and alcohol. Finish is bitter. Mouthfeel is medium-full, pretty smooth. Pretty decent beer."
"This is Founder's flagship beer and there's really no question as to why. This is pure genius."
"The key element is the big caramel malt. There's a hint of smoke around the flavor and in the aroma, and a decent sized bitter, peppery hops bite to round this one out. I also get dry cocoa powder, biscuits, dates, and cherries in the flavor. This is a complex sucker. A must try for the style, though it's one of the hoppiest I've tried. Watch out if you like 'em sweet."
"purchased at casanova's in hudson"
"Final Thought: Another great brew from Founders in Grand Rapids, MI... circle them on the map!"
"D_This is a nice Scotch Ale. Not the best I have ever had but one well worth trying."
"Mouthfeel was good, but nothing above and beyond, and the drinkability really took a hit due to the cloying, extremely noticeable alcohol taste present that lingered on after the first sip..."
"Too boozy for me. This would be a much better beer if they knocked a couple of percentage off the ABV."
"The body is big and rich but not as creamy as I would like for style. A bit difficult to drink with the alcohol punch but really a very good beer overall. Great complexity and some nice textures. A nice sensory challenging beer."
"D: I actually prefer the bottled version to the draft. A little high in the alcohol to be very drinkable, also I'm not a big fan of Scotch ales, but this one of the best that I've had."
"M/D - Full flavored and very creamy. Incredibly easy drinking."
"D: At 8.3%, this Bastard sneaks up on you! Suprisingly easy-drinking. Pairs well with hagus."
"Went down smooth, a very drinkable brew that I'm glad I tried."
"Cheers"
"D- This one is an easy drinker. Did not taste the abv at all, alcohol presence not there at all. I liked this one but was not blown away."
"Pours a brown tea colored brew with no head, some lacing. Smell is very meaty/savory. Taste is on the earthy side with some sweet notes. Finish is somewhat hoppy, Carbonation is nice and low. Not a bad brew, but nothing that makes me want more."
"I picked this beer up mostly because I found the name hilarious. It pours out a dark amber color with no head and very little lacing. The smell was nice with a roasted smell dominating, some faint hops. The taste was about the same, full bodied, roasted malts, a small amount of bitterness. It was lightly carbonated and very smooth. It's just a tad heavier than my usual selection of beers, so one was plenty for me. I would definitely recommend this to somebody though."
"D: meh....not one I would seek out, but I am in the minority on this one."
"T- Smooth maltiness creamy body, pretty damn delicious"
"I picked this up at the jungle in Fairfield, OH. This is a super malty brew. It seemed to me the alcohol was far more prominent. This was way to strong in my opinion and I will not be purchasing this angain. The Founder's Red Rye is a far superior offering and much more balanced and enjoyable."
"Drinks easy for the style & ABV, a solid wee heavy"
"Amazing beer from Founders. Deep chestnut brown color shows lots of red when held to direct light. Lots of ""floaties"" in the beer....small tan head and not a whole lot of lacing. Smell is wonderful....sweet malty aroma, definite caramel notes. Creamy and complex taste...some spiciness on the tongue...flat-out delicious beer."
"D: Great, I will definately try and trade for a few more. Well worth trying."
"This is a malt lover's dream. Really well balanced and never becomes too sweet even as it warmed. I'm going to have to investigate more of the Scotch Wee Heavy's. I've only had this and the Moylan's Kilt Lifter. Both have been really tasty!"
"Overall I thought this was very good. I have been lucky that I have a lot of the Founder's brews that I still have to try, or have tried recently, and I have to admit, this one is easily one of the best. A very well done representation of the style that really focused on keeping it raw and earthy, and unrefined. I would love to pick up a case of this one and have one all the time. Really a great representation and a classic beer. Have to recommend this one."
"D: This is a great example of a Wee Heavy. It is easy to drink and not too sweet and the alcohol is well hidden."
"this poured a dark ruby, with a small head that dissipated quickly. It smelled sweet: caramel; butterscocth; chocolote tones; and malts to top it off. It tasted very good, with many of the tastes I smelled coming through...it also warmed as it went down. It went down pretty smoothly, not too carbonated. This was a good scotch ale and lived up to its wee heavy name. Its not my favorite, but definitely not my least..."
"D-Quite good and worth a try, but not my cup of tea."
"Poured an attractive dark ruby color that was very inviting. Had a good head that lasted a while. Aroma was very malty and sweet. Flavor was of malt, caramel, peat and brown sugar. Nicely balanced with a bit of a bitter hop finish. Lacing was really good and the mouthfeel was pleasant. Hid the 8.3% abv very well. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is perfectly matched with the style of brew. Just right. Creamy, with just enough crispness."
"Quite frankly, this style beer is not one of my favorites, but I can definitely say this is the best Scottish-style ale that I have ever had!!"
"drinkability is great. well balanced, hiding the alcohol very well. bitterness is a touch higher than i'd expect for the style, but not overwhelming. love the nice big malts in this one."
"Velvety smooth. By taste and feel, this one is very drinkable, though the alcohol does catch up with it and it is quite sweet. A wonderful malty brew."
"Careful about the sediment."
"I only remember having this brew one time before and feel lucky that I've been able to try it again... very very good Scotch Ale ... I normally don't appreciate them, but for some reason I always really enjoy one that is well made. Another big cheers to jdoncbus. John's a great trader.. recommended."
"Pours a very dark amber color with a good sized tan, creamy head. Great retention and sticks to the glass with each sip. Aroma is sweet, citrusy, hops, tropical punch. Taste is full of depth and character. Very sweet malts, very earthy flavors, burnt caramel, ripe fruits, raisins, grassy, strong hop bitter finish. Alcohol is also apparent in the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and fairly heavy bodied. Decent carbonation, smooth in the mouth. Dry finish. Extremely tasty and enjoyable brew as always from Founders."
"Founders hits the mark again. Definitely worth a try."
"This is a damn good beer. Hard to believe that this has a high ABV. I would recommend this to anyone."
"D- looks, tastes, and smells so good that it's easy to drink faster than you may have planned but be warned laddy-- too many of these and you'll wind up like that song about the scotsman who fell asleep in the grass..."
"Another good beer from Founders to add to their list of many, wanted to try this one before I popped open its barrel aged version, Backwoods, in a few weeks or so, highly recommended and a damn good beer for its price, think it is available year round to boot, would definitely drink again in the future if I got the opportunity"
"pours a cloudy dark brown with a very small beige head that quickly fades to the beer with very little lace. smell is much better fruity with roasted malts, coffee, figs, raisins, hint of alcohol. taste is very sweet and complex with all of the above and with some caramel and a bitter tea that lingers after the finish. mouthfeel is light to medium but carbonation is weak. alcohol is a little prohibitive otherwise nice tasting beer."
"Strongly Recommended!"
"Very easy to sip on a really damn cold winter night."
"First off- not my fav style, but I have to try it since it is from Founder's. Rich mahogany color with thin head that disappears quickly. Malty, alcohol hits the nose right away. First sip is very smooth, major league malts. You can taste the 8% alcohol in this one. I drink it slow, but there is not much carbonation. Good beer overall, not in a ruch to drink again, though."
"Pours with a minor league head that dissipates rather quickly to a sparse lacing. Big malt nose with hints of fig. Taste is bold and malty with just the right amount of sweetness. A bit of fig like flavor follows through in the taste as well. Lovely mouthfeel and dangerously drinkable. This is a nice brew, I would definitely buy it again."
"D - While I feel it's a very good example of the style it's not a favorite of mine. I would buy it again as a single for variety in my collection."
"This made a believer out of me, and there's not much like being refracted in one's opinion because of the willingness to try a beer or style. Such is the case with Dirty Bastard, as it was thankfully due to my friend Captain Pat's intervention with the Southern Tier IPA. Good show, Founders!"
"A dark amber color, with a beige head that dissolves away quickly to a film on top. The scent of sweet malt hits the nose immediately, there is a twinge in alchol in the middle of the aroma. That does not last long, and soon the sweet fragrance of dried fruit comes out, mostly of currants. The malt dominates the flavor at the front, then the fruity flavors of currants and cherries blends on to the palate. A slight bit of bitterness at the end, nothing to strong, mostly mild citrus flavor to balance out the malt. A heavy feel and the weight stays consistant all the way through. Feels very slick and a tad oily, but is very smooth. This is a cold weather beer, it warms you all the way down. You should sipp this slowly, with its strong flavor and aroma, plus a hearty feel. It should keep you warm on those cold winter nights, or make you want to put on a kilt and play some bagpipes."
"Heck Yes. Bottle 2007, Draught too actually. An awesome Scotch style ale. Dark amber, moderate carbonation, rich flavs. I prefer sipping this beer slower than most, as the 8%+ is evident (but not obnoxious). The caramelness and molassesness is in yo face on this one, so if you dig that you'll love this one."
"Had on tap at the Map Room. Poured black with ruby highlights and a thin head that settles to a ring and leaves some okay lacing. Smells roasty, slightly fruity, and with some juicyfruit gum aromas. Some spicy malt as well. Tastes slightly sweet and with a fruity cherry/citrus/prune topnote and a base of pecan pie. Slightly piney finish. Unusual and delicious, and not as sweet as it sounds. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly sweet, and the beer overall is quite rich. Nice, now if I could just find some Backwoods Bastard."
"Overall, this beer is pretty damn good, a nice example of Scotch Ale. A very easy drinker, which is both a good and bad thing  Im tempted to drink a sixer of it, but I know that Id be a very dirty bastard by the end of it. Great for one or two, not good for a session."
"D: This is a damn fine Scotch Ale. Props to Founders for another great brew!"
"Pours dark brown with a tan head that is massive from way too firm a pour. Nose is a mass of complexity. Definite malts here. Caramel, wood tones, and just a good amount of things to take in. Flavor is pretty meaty with a consistent wood character going on. Thick caramel sweetness is there as well. Nice and robust. It seems like I am getting a small amount of alcohol on the flavor though. Feel has a decent carbonation and a smooth liquid feel. Overall pretty good. Nice and hearty and pretty rustic. I can't say it is really lacking, but I can't say it is the smoothest of the style I have ever had."
"D: While I like the taste, the alcohol fumes are a bit much for a number of these in one sitting. On a cold night/day this will really get the fire going on the inside."
"This beer is good, but it is a little bit too boozy to be very drinkable."
"This is definitely a great beer to drink during the winter (I know its not a seasonal!) while sitting next to a fire. I just might take my own advice very soon!"
"Definitely one of the best of this style that I've tried, and for certain the best American version I've had."
"I think this is a very drinkable beer with a good overall taste and feel. The biggest drawbacks for me are the slight dryness and astringency. I think this beer really benefits from a good balance of toasted flavors along with very smooth caramel on the nose and in taste. It is sweet without being too much so, and dark without being overly earthy."
"Mouthfeel is coating but not syrupy. Supple with a biting bitterness to sever any lingering thickness. Outstanding in this area. Still, this is a big, flavorful beer with big alcohol to boot. Very drinkable for the style but only suitable for the shortest of sessions."
"Full body, a little spicy from the carbonation, biter and dry in a warming, pleasant way. Very thick and full, just like a scotch ale is supposed to be. Very strong alcohol presence. The aftertaste is satisfying, despite the esters. Smooth and drinkable if strong ales are your thing."
"D- I've only sampled a few from this style and this seems to be a solid example. ABV is normal for the style and alcohol presence plays a big role in this brew. Sweet caramel and roasted bitter chocolate mix well and leave behind a nice warmth. Decent overall-but I am confident I can find other examples of this style I enjoy more."
"Other Comments: WOULD GO GREAT WITH A SIDE OF HAGGIS!"
"From Merchants in Dearborn, MI. Though mahogany in the glass, this was a very rusty-orange as it poured. Tan head settled quickly leaving a ring, some lacing, fleeting carbonation. There was a strong odour of whiskey, oak, vanilla, caramel malts, taffy, alcohol. I did not smell fruit as many others here did. Though I'm not fond of this style of beer, I found the taste surprizingly milder than the smell suggested and quite enjoyable with a bit of molasses presence. I thought the whisky punch remained front and centre. Warm mouthfeel, some lingering heat but not bad at all, the hops and malt are nicely balanced. I'd say this was the first Wee Heavy I really liked, wouldn't mind trying it again."
"Drinkability is good, the alcohol is extremely well hidden."
"a touch hoppier than I prefer in a SA but tasty! I'd drink another one of these."
"d: Certainly a sessionable beer given the well masked alcohol. I'll certainly buy this again."
"Pours a clean, muddy molasses in color beneath a creamy, off-white head with nice, delicate retention. Thin layers of ringed lacing. Aromas of light toffee, molasses, semi-sweet brown sugar, and mild alcohol whaffs. Notes of dark, aged fruit: plum, date, raisin. A warm, semi-sweet malt sweetness with notes of toffee and hazlenut. Almost full in body; velvety smooth and creamy. Not overpowering on the palate. A pleasant tasting Scotch Ale. The flavors and textures are balanced; light enough in abv and intensity to have a few glasses."
""
"D: Went great with the cheese in my meal, a sharper cheddar next time. Good beer to have with a meal, but not the paramount scotch ale. One per sitting."
"Drinkability: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. One of my favorite beers. Definately in the top ten.... Go get some of this. With 8.3% abv.... proceed with caution. It could sneak up on you."
"One of the best beers I have yet to drink."
"12 oz stubby bottle from Abes poured into a tulip (no thistle glass). Deep caramel brown with a little dark tan head that leaves only a ring around the glass and some bigger bubbles on the surface. Smell is roasted malts, taste is big and malty, sweet but but balanced by the burnt/roastedness that comes through. The alcohol makes itself known as the beer warms, which is very nice and warming and overall the taste is really good. Mouthfeel is full but the carbonation keeps it from feeling dead. Drinkability is good even if the finish isnt what you would call dry. Very good overall."
"Overall a nice beer that I enjoyed for somthing different, but I probably wouldn't go back to it since the scotch ale is not really my bag. If it is your bag, I bet you enjoy this beer."
"drinkability - Nice balance, not too malty, enjoyed this one"
"Rich mahogany color with a thin off-white head. Smells of oak, caramel, and musty basement. It has a deep rich taste of brown malt with a tiny bit of roast. This hides its ABV pretty well. I'd like a little peat note, but oh well - I've got Lagavulin for that urge. The finish is is creamy, earthy, a bit fruity with a little brandy-like warmth. Cold weather and your favorite sweater."
"Thin tan head with minimal lacing. Has a sweet aroma with smells of dark roasted malt coming through. Sweet taste typical for Scotch style ales with a little bit of hops. Very pleasant medium mouthfeel with a somewhat creamy texture. The high alcohol content doesn't come through as much as you would think and the sweetness is what limits its drinkability rather than the alcohol content in my opinion. Not a huge fan of the style, but as good as any Scotch ale I've had."
"Overall, this is flavorful beer with a bitter sweet flavor."
"Golden colored beer with average smell.Taste seems to have a hint of fruit with a big alcohol aftertaste.This is my first scotch ale and it isn't too bad but It doesn't seem that you can drink many of these at one sitting.Overall I would recommend this beer and I would purchase again!!!"
"Overall- The strongest Wee Heavy I can recall having. A few of these will knock you off the bar stool!"
"If it's no Scottish, it's crrrrap!"
"drinkability is moderate. this is a rich brew that commands attention. however, it is well balanced and rich in flavor profile and complexity. cheers!"
"Picked up a six pack of this while visiting family in Indiana. I was homesick for my McEwans back home. Luckily this did the trick! Poured very nice with an excellent dark, rust/copper tone. It has one of the best aromas I've experienced, a very deep, malty and almost peaty scent. Very nice flavor, a nice amount of malt. The only negative was that, even keeping in mind its relatively high ABV, the taste and feel of alcohol was higher than usual compared to other beers, which affected its mouthfeel considerably and its taste a bit, as well. Still, if you're going to have a domestic scotch ale instead of the real thing, this is definitely worth trying."
"D: This is quite an interesting and complex beer and quite heavy on top of that, but something seemed a bit lacking overall, I guess my expectations were a little high on this one. Not sure I'd try this again before I tried some other's in this style."
"This scotch style ale may be a bit wee too heavy (pardon the pun) for some folks, but it's just right for this lad. It's big, and it doesn't try to hide it, but that's part of the Bastard's charm. Mind the ABV and know what you're getting yourself into and enjoy the ride."
"D - A big Scottish style brew, I couldn't drink this all the time, but every now and then a big malty brew is enjoyable. I found it to be a ting harsh the first time I drank this, but on repeated tastes found it to be well made and better than average."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"This is an interesting American twist on the Scottish style. Lots of malty goodness with a dose of American hops."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's full bodied. Carbonation is excellent. ABV is perfect for this beer. Very drinkable. Overall, this is a very good beer. One I'll certainly drink again."
"D- This beer has a big malt flavor but it is not real sweet and is balanced by the hop bitterness, although there is not much hop flavor. It is a big flavorful beer but it is almost abrasive with the fusel note. I rather like the big abrasive flavors."
"D- Very interesting. Something worth trying, but I would have a lot of trouble enjoying more than one of these."
"Carbonation is on the wild side, mouthfeel is sticky and warming, which suits the style."
"Wouldn't see myself drinking more than one. I might like to try another one to make sure this is what this brew is supposed to be about."
"A mite strong for multiple servings at the price that it's sold for. However, if I ever found this in a pub for $4-6 a pint...you'd have to tear me away from the bar at closing time. Truly an excellent beer and one whose not-so-subtle characteristics are best enjoyed through sips and sniffs. This brew ain't no guzzler."
"D: A bit strong, but I could help my neighbor build his deck better with a six pack of this."
"Scott"
"The beer pours a dark brown/red color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is low, but the lacing is good. It smells like caramel, roasted malt, dark fruit and a bit of a smoky aroma. It's mostly malty, I can't smell any hops at all. However, the aroma is a little weak. Flavor is pretty much the same as it smells. Taste overall is good, nice with good malty flavor. Mouthfeel is medium/full, it's smooth and creamy. It has just the right amount of carbonation to make this easy to drink, too. Overall I think this is a good beer, I'd definitely buy this one again."
"Overall: A very nice Scotch Ale. It's flavorful, but everything seems to work well together, without one aspect overpowering any of the others."
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy purplish-brown color with a medium light-brown head. Nice lacing. Aroma is very malty with a sweet fruitiness to it. Very nice mouthfeel. Flavor is very strong, with malt, alcohol, caramel, and an almost smoke flavor to it. Interesting and tasty beer. Strong Scottish Ale for fans of the style."
"Pours a dark amber hue with a fluffy one finger off white head that quickly dies down to a very thin layer. Stickiness is non-existant, not sure if that is common for this style or not. Smell is, well, scotch. Big on caramel and chocolate malt, not much else. A good amount of dark fruits tingle the nose as well. Taste is sweet full flavored caramel malt with a smokey tobacco as well. Dates, raisins, and fig seem to appear in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very full bodied and creamy. Definite warming sensation after sipping on this for a while. Not a whole lot of alcohol on the tongue but still a bit thick to put down easily. Haven't had many of this style, but I did enjoy this. Pick it up if you can. Cheers."
"I poured a bottle into a pint glass. Dark reddish-brown appearance with a thin tan head. Smelled like roasted malt with a hint of something semi-sweet. Doesn't have an overpowering bitter flavor as some strong ales tend to have. Not too hoppy. Not to strong for an 8.3% alcohol brew. A bit syrupy and thick but not too bad. I like this beer a lot but after drinking a couple I'd move on to a lager to mix it up. I've had this beer on tap at the Founder's brewery in Grand Rapids and for some reason It seemed a little better from the tap... But then again, beers always do."
"Wow! This brew is a must try! Great job, Founders! Poured a very dark brown with a slight reddish tone. Thin, off white head, but very thick and strong. Long lasting, excellent lacing. Not much carbonation. Smelled of strong, roasted, toasted, luscious malt. I loved the smell. Despite the heavy, roasted malt, this is a very smooth, creamy, dreamy brew. Extremely smooth. I can't express that enough. Full bodied, but still light on the tongue and throat. Starts out a little bitter, but finishes smooth and rich with a strong tasting, roasted malt aftertaste that makes you yearn for more and also my pipe (legal tobacco). Warm, rich, relaxing feeling .Would make a great, crisp autumn or winter brew. Extremely drinkable, even with the 8.3% abv. Beers like this are so enjoyable and are what great beer is about. Cheers and enjoy."
"Overall a very nice beer. I have to be in the right mood for scotch ales but I'd definitely go back to this one."
"Drinkability: Very good for this style. Not overly smoky like some (charcoal briquette anyone?) and plenty of sweet malt to keep you coming back. Also, some beers of this style aren't complex enough to keep someone's interest, but I will seek this out again. Surely, this is a sipper and more appropriate for winter but it tastes just as great in the summer. One question, why a twist off? (head shake)."
"A nice take on the style and a fun experience."
"Another good beer from Founders; I picked this up on a beer run across the river to Wiscoland. I don't drink many Scotch Ales since I'm more of a hop-head, but this is a tasty one."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a warm crystal and roasted malt scent along with some peated malt notes. The taste is awesome. It is so smooth with a sweet, yet roasted finish that warms on the way down. It's full of crystal and smoked malts; very nice. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine Scotch ale. It's warm and flavorful; not a session beer, but a nice slow drinker."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable, despite a rather strong note of alcohol. The smell alone makes me willing to drink this any time. Admittedly, not a great beer for a warm summer day."
"Overall-a nice change of pace, but I shared this a BBQ with some newer craft people and that left me with half a growler to get through. It was tough."
"Taste really follows through! Roasted malt with chocolate, a hint of coffee but really more of a dark black tea-bitterness...nutty, and wonderful hoppy bitterness comes in for a long rich finish. Very flavor packed, more going on than I can adequately describe. Great creamy mouthfeel, crisp and dry despite the huge amount of flavor. This was a really impressive surprise, my first wee heavy, and I am really looking forward to trying more!"
"Drinkability: It went down smooth and left no aftertaste. This is a beer to be enjoyed, not simply drunk."
"D - This is a great beer. It was sweet but not overpowering."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This Scotch Ale poured a hazy, dark reddish brown color with visible carbonation when held up to light. Virtually no head or lace to speak of. The aroma of this beer was made up of sweet caramel malts, light yeast notes, and a bit of wood. The flavor is dominated by smokey malt richness. Some sweet caramel notes followed by a big roasted, smokey malt flavor. A touch of hop bitterness is present at the end. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with light carbonation, leaving a lasting smokey taste on your tounge. Towards the bottom of the glass, it reminds me of drinking a Scotch and water. The flavor seems to become a bit muted by the smoke. I enjoyed the aroma and flavors that this beer presented, but the smokey finish seemed to detract from the overall experience. Made my mouth feel like I had sat next to a campfire for a few hours, directly in the line of the smoke eminating from the flame. A decent beer, but maybe just not my cup of tea. It was definately a Dirty Bastard!!!"
"had this on tap at the south philly tap room. Am I wrong to say malted milk in a glasss? So so so malty. Beautiful silky clear mahagony color. Great glass lacing and nice malt aroma. beer has as very long smooth finish. Malts malts and more malts. Absolutely the most complex scotch ale that I have ever had. A cutting edge version of the style. the taste deepens, tantilates and lingers. very, very smooth. My first and I hope not my last from a brewery I have heard lots about. hope to have more of this and others too! YUMMY!"
"Higher ABV, so just have one."
"Maybe a bit too alcoholic and demanding to be an everyday beer, but still, this is a killer Scotch Ale. Founders does it again."
"Poured into a pint glass, twist cap, pours an tan black in color with a creamy head that hangs around and leaves some thick lace on the glass. Smell is smell is very malty and smoky filled. This beer was a bit strong for me to handle, the intense malt flavors just didn't agree with me, I don't know if maybe it was a bad bottle or not, over all it wasn't bad but I was expecting a bit more. It was also hard for me to drink, and didn't go down to smooth at all."
"Thick bodied,cloying,mouthwatering nice mouthfeel. Good drinkabilty for the body and alcohol. Goes down easy not much alcohol presence for 8.3%. Should be getting this beer in the area soon will give this one another try. Very good beer,enjoyable,bit of a sipper,still could drink a few of these. Would definately recommend this beer."
"This beer is one more reason I'm coming around to this style as a genuine joy to behold. When done well, it's richly sweet and savory, and this one fills that bill quite nicely. Yes, the ABV bears watching, at least out of the corner of your eye, but it's the flavor that makes you look away and enjoy another in spite of the spreading warmth. There's nothing here not to like, and plenty to like just fine."
"Founders' delicious Scotch-style ale is among the best American versions out at the present time. Pours a deep brownish-red with a brown-tinged heady foam with light lacing. Smells of sweet caramel and malt and tastes as sweet as it smells. Very tasty, complex maltiness with a strong alcohol finish. Full, satisfying mouthfeel makes this brew highly drinkable. Pairs well with a strong cheese, greasy italian dishes and blueberry kringle."
"Had this one at Monk's in the bottle. Appearance is amber-brown, a nice head, dissolves pretty slowly. Nose is solid; caramel malty sweetness, a little fruit. Taste is great; same type of maltiness, with caramel, chocolate, honey, some spiciness as well. A really tasty beer. Feel is solid, good carbonation and medium to full body. Drinkability is good, just a little bit high on the alcohol knocks it down a bit. A good beer I will look for again."
"This is a wonderful beer, I gave drinkability a 5 because I could seriously drink this all the time, as a standard go to beer. Reasonably priced and it tasted amazing. What more can I say, I'll definitely be drinking it again."
"D - Excellent. I could drink this all night, but you have to sip slowly and enjoy....never gulp down something so outstanding. This is one of my all time favorite beers! I must say that I slightly prefer the bottled version, but that may be just because I can serve it the way I want ....at cellar temp in a nice big chalice."
"tha moral: good beer. not really a scotch"
"Pours a cloudy bronze-mahogany with amber highlights. The creamy tan one-finger head shows good retention and spotty lacing. Dark Crystal malt and slight plum aromatics are the strongest, with a mild herbal hop note and a earthy/yeasty scent in the background. Sweet caramel taste upfront, followed by a deep roasted flavor something like chicory. Aftertaste is long and drawn out, but not in any bothersome way. A lingering caramel sweetness gradually fades to a stiff roasty bite and sharp earthy yeast tones; finally met by a herbal hop flavor and balanced bitterness. Full bodied and lightly carbonated, it has a somewhat viscous mouthfeel that furthers the perception of fullness and allows a hearty residual sweetness without becoming cloying. It finishes very malty with dark fruit notes coming out more as it warms, eventually dryng out with the help of the ample hop prescence. This is strong and complex like a good Scotch ale should be, but it is also balanced well enough to retain an excellent drinkability. Cheers to Founders for giving the beer community a good representation of a style that is difficult to master."
" Drinkability - pretty easy to drink by itself or with a meal but not one I would drink more than a couple of."
"Quite drinkable; ""Slàinte mhòr agad!"" "Great health to you!"" (""Cheers!"")"
"Extremely dark ruby color. Fairly nice malt nose. Really complex hints of peat and smoke on the palate, with additional notes of caramel, toffee and fruit as well. Very nice body. Nice flavor. A very nice beer. I would love to buy this beer in a 6er."
"A delicious beer - one of my favorite Wee Heavies."
"Another over carbonated, yeasty Founders brew. I am seeing a trend here that I am finding to be rather disappoiting. I don't think that I keep getting ""off"" bottles, so I am left to assume that they have some bottling issues."
"D: Love this stuff. This was my first taste since I just bought singles, but want to go out and buy a sixer."
"Poured out a thick molasses color with a tiny reddish head. Taste is of carmel, smoke, roasted malts (hints of coffee), and a touch of dark fruit. Fairly bitter and alcohol unmasked which limits the drinkability."
"D: This stuff is killer. At about 8%, it can creep up on ya, but I could easily drink a couple of these and hit the bed. The more I drink from Founders, the more I love Founders. And let me tell ya I would choose this over their breakfast stout any day."
"Very good beer. Far from sessionable, (for me at least) but I'd be happy to have another single bottle another time."
"I often think Founder's brews are a tad bit overrated. This is the exception. Definately worth a try."
"Drinkability: The floaters, the fruityness and all that make this beer a little on the non-drinkable side for me. I did enjoy it but one or two is where I would draw the line with this offering. I remember liking it a whole lot more at the extreme beerfest maybe my tastes were out of whack or this bottle was not a good representation of the beer."
"I received this in a trade and whoever traded it to me. THANK YOU!!! Wanna trade for a sixer?"
"D- I think this is an amazing beer. I think I will have to buy a 6-pack off line. Everything just seems like it is meant to be there and it all comes together VERY nicely."
"A good scotch ale with a lot of personality."
"D: Quite enjoyable. The 10 different malts are balanced very nicely by the hops."
"D: Very well balanced. So soft and smooth that makes me think it's actually a quad and not a scotch ale. A pleasure to drink--hands down a great beer. High abv goes completely unnoticed--well masked."
"Drinkability: For a stronger Scotch ale/wee heavy this is very drinkable. This brew is perfect on a cold winters day"
"Mouthfeel was thin and flat. Like a previous reviewer, I wonder if that was a result of a bad bottle. Drinkable overall for a relatively high ABV beer."
"Took a bottle out of the fridge and poured it into my glass. Very small head that dissipated immediately. Amber/brown color with a little cloudiness. The first smell that jumped out at me was alcohol, which was a little disappointing. Maybe a little licorice too, but nothing very distinctive in the nose for me. Mouthfeel was a little flat, which when combined with the lack of head makes me wonder if I just got a semi-flat beer. Taste was good with alcohol warmth going down from the 8.3% ABV. Decent balance of malt & hops, and neither seemed to overpower the other although both the maltiness and bitterness were high. A strong but drinkable beer."
"D - As previously mentioned, much more drinkable from the alcohol-taste sense...not the ABV aspect, as 8.3% doesn't allow for too many to be consumed. Very strong Scotch Ale and highly recommended."
"D - A very tasty wee heavy a regular drinker of mine."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Sly Fox pint glass. Appears a deep ruby brown with an inch of tan colored foam. Smells of pineapple, caramel, molasses and has a sharp alcohol aroma. Taste is of sweet prune, raisin, brown sugar and molasses. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side with medium carbonation. I would drink this ale again, but probably not more than two at a time. Cheers."
"Cheers!"
"Not much carbonation nor aftertaste which makes this an average scotch ale"
"D: I don't know know if this beer is for me. I love big beers, but this one is a tad unbalanced."
"sweetness is far more subtle in the flavor, with strong roasted malt bitterness and an alcoholic kick overwhelming the caramel and dark fruit flavors. finish is fairly bitter. medium carbonation balances out a fairly full, heavy feel. ends up being slightly harsh, slightly medicinal, slightly off."
"I've had my first few of this style lately, don't know yet if it'll grow on me, but this is surely a great advocate for the style, full of flavor and body, something you'd like to session (but probably shouldn't)."
"Pours a dark brownish red with a tan head that lingers around as you sip. The smell is inviting, roasted malts, fruit, some sweet notes. The taste is big and bold (as with most founders beers) and starts off with the roasted malt, a hint of smoke, and some hops thrown in the mix. The alcohol flavor dominates this beer especially as it warms, like you actually are drinking scotch. Very potent but brings out a nice flavor for an aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, a very enjoyable and well balanced feel. This one isn't the easiest drink, not for weak, I wouldn't suggest this for starters, but an amazing scotch ale. Definitely worth checking out. Enjoy."
"Another winner from founders, and a great scotch wee heavy. Very tasty all around and well made. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied. Not my favorite Founder's offering but I tend to like hop-heavy beers rather than malt bombs."
"I will drink this beer again as soon as I get the chance."
"Pours with deep red hue, has a minimal head which is good for this style. Carbonation level is perfect just enough to bring out the flavor. A nice and smooth beer this is with a little sweetness and a hint of a roasted character. Not much of any hop smell to this one as it should be, just the great malt character smell with maybe a hint of chocolate malt. HHHHMMMM goood!"
"this certainly isn't a beer to have four or five of. but to enjoy one is a pleasant experience."
"Drinkability: Is it me, or is this the fruitiness non-fruit beer to date?"
"D: A nice smooth, rich, malty wee heavy. Taste really starts coming through as the beer warms."
"The bottom line: a very solid regular offering by Founders, and sure to be a mainstay in my pint from this point on."
"I founderd out that when this flagship sails off in to the horizon that i for one will not miss it."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating on the label. Was a nice brownish mahogany. Had a small head that quickly dissappeared. Aroma was a nice toasted malt with some chocolate in the background and was pretty typical of the better examples of the style. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy and let you know you were drinking a good beer. The 8.3% ABV definitely warms you up as you drink it but was not to overpowering in aroma or taste. Overall, the taste was excellent and what I expect as a top tier example of the sytle. Due to the higher ABV, not a session beer but could see myself drinking this on a regular basis. Highly recommend. (4, HR, T, Y)"
"Drinkability - this is delicious and mouthwatering, I think it's excellent, and only the high abv prevents it from being sessionable. But do, by all means, have the second serving ( i.e. 12 oz. ), and if one excersises due caution, the third."
"Great rich reddish-brown color and beige head. Both the taste and aroma are just fantastic. Plum, fig, brown sugar, molasses, without being overly sweet or cloying. Very well balanced, and dangerously drinkable. If I could get this regularly, it'd probably wouldn't be a good thing..."
"Purchased at local liquor store. Poured into a tumbler a deep chocolate with plush red high lights. Tan head, about half inch thick, some lacing and decent retention. Smells of medium sweet malt, with coffee and toasted notes, slightly nutty, hops are present although more in support formation, with some raison, bread and mild dark fruit. Taste, wonderful toasted sweet malt, immediately followed with balanced bitterness, imparting sort of a nutty dark chocolate flavor, how ever I would not describe this as syrupy or too thick. On the swallow comes another nice round bit of milky sweetness, balanced again by mild bitterns. This is a tasty scotch ale, which I am relatively new too, but from my experience thus far I very much enjoyed. This is well worth a having around especially during the winter months, I know I'll buy it again.""Yehve nary had such a bonnie taste of heavn since pullin yer mouth off yer mammys teet."" Need I say more"
"D: I only bought a single, and I'm glad I did. The flavors are all over the place, and the ones that predominate aren't pleasant. I detected slight hints of chocolate and toffee, but was overwhelmed by the harshness of it. If it weren't for the other (rave) reviews on BeerAdvocate and the fact that this beer is named as an exemplar for the style by the BJCP, I'd content myself to have tried just this one bottle. I'll probably try it again at some point, to assure myself that I didn't just get a bad batch. I suspect this beer, at 8.3% ABV, will mellow well with age."
"a nice example, for me, of how palates evolve. i first had this years ago, before i'd tried many craft beers at all, and hated it. thought it was disgusting. now that i've become more aware of the characteristics of a quality beer, i'm very impressed with this one."
"The drinkability as also very good I will seek this one out. Prosit MK"
"Pours a beautiful deep scarlet with thin white head. Smells of nice medium bready malts. Tasted of bread and slight fruits. I can only compare it to a Two-Hearted without as much of a hop presence. Still an enjoyable drink. Another good Founders brew."
"D: This is too thick and sweet to be a session beer, but it's well-balanced enough that the bottle went quicker than I would have expected. Very enjoyable."
"One of these and I'm OK, though I wouldn't readily drink more. Love the creamy/syrupy mouthfeel, but the label tells no lies: ""Dirty Bastard Ale ain't fer the wee lads."" Drink slowly and with caution. Recommended for a try."
"D - If this is your kind of style, extremely drinkable. I love it."
"D: Very drinkable with a beefier malt body that goes well with these increasingly colder evenings."
"Pours a murky brown with some burgundy hues under a thin tan head. Head quickly settles to a slick film which persists throughout the glass. The initial aroma is of assertive peat smoked malts, followed by faint notes of burnt caramel candy, dark wheat bread, raisins, black cherries and a touch of herbal hops. Carbonation is appropriately subtle resulting in a smooth, slightly oily and slick moutfeel. Just right for this style. Initial flavor leans toward the sweet side presenting burnt caramel, brown sugar, raisins and figs with a hint of chocolate. The hops and alcohol eventually emerge in the late palate and finish with a fairly crisp, dry bitterness and ethanol warmth. Kind of an ""Amercanized"" hoppy version of the style, reminiscent of old Bert Grants Scotch Ale, but a nice winter season beer."
"Appearance was a reddish-black, with a non-persistant tan head. Odor was of bourbon/caramel, which I liked. Flavor was also that of bourbon and caramel. I didn't feel that the bourbon flavor was overpowering and thought the aroma and flavor of the beer was quite pleasant."
"Drinkability is slightly hampered from the syrup thickness and alcohol content, but nothing quad lovers couldn't easily handle."
"Slainte!"
"D - The 50 ibu's in this beer help it by cutting through the weight of the beer which helps with the drinkability a lot. Otherwise one of these would knock you out."
"Very carbonated, full body. A slight aclohol burn lingers for a second or two after swallowing, but no real aftertaste. The bitter end and the abv makes this only an average drinker for me."
"I owe this beer an apology. After a couple more years of brewing and tasting experience I am recanting my previously scathing review. I do find that this beer is a bit too much on the big end of the style as far as drinkability, I find other wee heavy's preferable in that way, but it is a big rich and daring interpretation of the style."
"I was cold one night and I knew this would fix that. A very nice winter sipper. Careful with it though, it can sneak up on you."
"Taste is dominated by sweet malt, with a tiny bit of hops hiding deep down. Then, moments after you swallow the sip, there is a hop bitterness that shows up. It's several seconds after you swallow, though. Quite strange. In fact, I subtracted half a point in the taste on account of this. I had originally placed it at 4.0, but as I sipped this, I felt that while better than average, it didn't quite deserve 4.0. Mouthfeel is very smooth and has a solid feel to it. Overall, I enjoyed this very much, even with its peculiar hop bitterness in such a malt dominated style. Thanks again, Ding."
"D: Definitely not for the wee lads!"
"D - Delightful and complex"
"Ruby brown color. Nice lacing from the thin film that remains after the smallish head dissapears. Very full caramel flavor and taste. Slight burnt flavor in the finishing taste which gives it a slight bitterness at first that builds as you drink more of the beer. Very chewy and full mouthfeel. My first Founders beer and it did not dissapoint. Read the description for a scotch ale/wee heavy and this is it to a tee. Love the description on the bottle too. Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Split a 12 oz. bottle of this with my big brother. Our reading of the bottling date is May 2006. Poured golden brown with a very thin, off-white head. Aromas of fruity white wine that give way to a burnt caramel. I'm really enjoying these notes of crisp fruitiness that I'm finding in these dark Scotch Ales. Taste begins with a bite from the alcohol. Flavors of nicely toasted malt. Good balance from a light hoppiness in the center of the tongue. Clean, dark finish. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy (I mean this as a compliment; I like this style thicker) with light carbonation. Like a very thin caramel. Very good drinkability, although this style will sneak up on you if you're not careful. Contrary to my brother's analysis, I prefer Founder's to McEwan's, although both are excellent beers. Reminds me why this style is one of my favorites."
"Deciphering Founders' cryptic dating system, it seems that this was bottled in May. Poured into a regular wine glass, it came out reddish brown color with a little head. The aroma was sweet, slightly fruity and alcoholic. The taste was, again, malty and sweet, with a notable bitter finish and aftertaste. The alcohol here was apparent in the burn at the end. Overall, it felt smooth. Mostly, it was good, but felt potent, and I couldn't pack in much more than a bottle of this."
"Man this is so dark that if someone told me it was a stout and I didn't scrutinize the beer, I would believe them. Head is about half a finger thick. Nose is mostly sweet caramel, toffee, a bit of smoke. Taste is much the same but i get a strange wheatiness that reminds me of a slice of whole wheat bread in the start and overwhelmingly in the finish. I really like it and find it fascinating. Oh yeah, there's also a bit of milk chocolate as well. Mouth is like velvet smeared with vaseline. Smooth smooth and smooth. I really liked this beer. I would love to buy it over and over. It isn't the best of the style I've had but it really does taste good."
"D: This one’s very tasty and the type of beer that makes you crave the next sip. The only thing keeping me from giving this beer a 5 in this category is that it’s kind of filling; however it’s an excellent representation of the style."
"Medium bodied and very drinkable. Is it fair to judge this against other scotch ales? No. Am I complaining? No."
"Cheers!"
"this is a great beer with a fitting name, great drinker, reminds me of mcewans."
"Purchased in bottle in Menomonee Falls, WI. This was a classic scotch ale, much like McEwans. If there was ever a beer to put hair on ones chest, this is probably it. A deep red color, very malty. This beer tastes like some sort of masculinity that I can only dream of. I had a few beers before this one, but Dirty Bastard is the one I will remember. A fantastic brew, very sweet-tasting and smoky but not overpowering. Dirty Bastard has a very full mouthfeel; one can taste alcohol when you breathe in with a mouthful of this stuff. I would drink this stuff by the gallon if my liver could handle it. Highly recommended."
"Not a lasting aftertaste to note, but the ABV packs a velvet punch with the swallow. A nice beer that I'll have to repeat in the Fall."
"D - Drinkable. This is my first Founders brew, pretty tasty, would recommend."
"D - all this rsults in a high drinkability, a great wee heavy, Founder's got it right, only the above average ABV holds it back"
"Pours a gorgeous dark amber color with a plumous off white head. Amazing tracing. Aromas of roasted grains, sweet licorice, fusels, just overall a really rich impression. A full mouthfeel fills you with flavors of raisins, fruity hops, dark bitter chocolate, a malt lovers dream. I imagine this is a hoppier beast that your average scotch ale, but it delivers a delicious beverage. A wonderful beer at just above room temp served in a snifter. I wish I picked up more than the single, but it will do to make a nice end to my day."
"Pours a deceptive dark brown that reveals ruby highlights under light. Head of yellow cream dissipates to a soft ring. Aroma of chocolate, molasses, and smoked peat. Taste is initially soft, with caramel malts and Belgian sweet malts. The smoke hits briefly, and is then subsumed under a fairly powerful alcohol burn. Very silky mouthfeel, like a thick oatmeal stout. Quite a good scotch ale overall, although the burn does distract a bit."
"My first Scotch Ale. When you pour this Beer you are instantly taken by the dark black with a hint of ruby coloring. Virtually no head to speak of. The Beer clings to the glass as you drink. The aroma is strong toasted grains and malt. With the first drink you get the toasted malt that you expected as well as a bitter dark chocolate flavor. This is quickly followed by the strong ABV coming through in the aftertaste, with a thick mouthfeel. All in all it was not an unenjoyable experience, but I may have realized that I am not a Scotch Ale drinker."
"This Scottish style ale pours with a head like Einstein and the brain of a Speak-N-Spell. I'm mumbling to myself right now with a bowl of salty tortilla chips next to me trying to keep the burn from my throat and the hot tremors from the rest of my body. Three parts propane and one part shark liver this is sure to rip your intestines to shreds like the flag on a paddle boat in a noreaster. I kind of enjoyed the first two or three sips but in a similar way that one of my old childhood friends did when he got an Egyptian eye tattooed on the side of his head, ""It hurts but it's a good kind of pain."" Needless to say he was an idiot and time has caught up and taught me a few lessons about practicality. Get a fire extinguisher and some Rolaids because the whole town is going to burn down inside your body."
"This beer has flavor that is bigger and more aggressive than many other scottish ale's I have had. Another great beer from founders."
"Deep auburn.. small ring of tan foam. Big caramel & toffee malt aroma with some dark fruits on display also. Great finishing hop flavors with a very tasty (and huge) malt profile. Dark chocolate, sweet brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, burnt oak, and a hint of smoke...complex and delicious. The rich flavors are really quite incredible..each one adds to the unique taste. The 8.3% abv is very well masked, which makes the drinkability insane also. A winner from Founders, and one of the best scotch ales I've had."
"Fills the mouth effortlessly and smoothly. Lack of head fools you into expecting next to no carbonation, but it's there in proper (fairly weak) proportion. So glad I have a couple more of these in the cupboard. I'll want more."
"Ruby red color with a cream colored head leaving spotty lacing around the glass. Toffee, brown sugar, malted milk balls in the nose. Malted milk balls up front followed by toffee in the finish, only a bit of hop presence. Average carbonation and medium bodied. Wasn't very drinkable, split the bottle. Perhaps I will try it again to see if I got a bad bottle or if I will like it better."
"Tried this beer in a small amount at a tasting and liked it enough to buy a full bottle to review. Quite brown in color, with not really much of a head. Looks about right for a scotch ale. Nose is earthy and malty...not very strong. Nice flavor, large ABV is obvious but blended in well with the chocolatey malts and caramel consistency. A good example of the style by Founders and i enjoyed it even though its not my favorite type of beer."
"It is overall a good session beer. It is also fairly easy to get drunk off of the well hidden 8.3% abv."
"D: Not bad, I would have actually liked it to have been smokier. But I really enjoyed to strawberry alcohol esters it created."
"This is a nice wee heavy, just too much heavy for me. Tough to drink, has a lofty alcohol kickback. Nice caramel taste to this very heavy bodied wee. Is extremely smooth, til the backlash of alcohol kicks in. I don't know, maybe it's the style I'm no accustomed to, but I couldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"Medium full in the body with just the right amount of carbonation to wash everything clean. One of the best examples of the style."
"Rather like cherry cough syrup. Kind of tingles too. Black licorice. The peat tastes like it has turned. Slightly slick mouthfeel that tries to cling to my teeth. Full body though. Jut not so sure about this beer."
"Overall, the best Scottish Ale I have had since Robert the Bruce, maybe even better. I need a side by side tasting to decide. Try it!"
"This is a great beer and is very easy to drink, but watch out for the 8.3% ABV."
"One of the best non brewpub scotch ales I've had. For such a big beer it's surprisingly watery, but beyond that all the flavors are there and in your face. A fantastic scotch ale."
"This is a beer that I come back to time and time again. I say it is very drinkable."
"Damn nice....go get it."
"Mmm, yummy. I think Founders did a really nice job with this one. While the body is a bit thin for the style, it is very drinkable and enjoyable. It pours a very clear brown with minimal carbonation and a small head. It taste of roasty malt with caramel and toffee undertones. For such a malt monster, the coffee and chocolate flavors are minimal. On the whole, I would say that it is spot on for the style."
"D - No taste of alcohol, but I can feel it after a pint."
"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a small off-white foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of strong malt, caramel and a light touch of smoke. Taste is also dominated by the strong malt presence with sweet caramel with a subtle touch of peat. Body is quite full and carbonation is low. Very interesting take on the style."
"Frighteningly drinkable for me. The ABV would slow me down, but I'd make a good run at it."
"A well-executed high shilling ale. There is just a kiss of smoky peat, which I find to be the perfect amount in a Scotch ale. I find too many American versions of this style tend to go overboard with the peated malt. This one does not. True to style, it lets the malts take center stage with the hops lending just enough support to make sure it isnt cloying."
"It's one of those beers than you can infer has a lot of booze though you can't really taste it. That, to me, just screams drinkable. Good beer, I'd buy it again, and love to have it around the house or at the bar."
"Sweet and juicy malt mouthfeel. Strong hints of liquid candy sugar, caramel and dark fruits with a thick malt backbone. Nice hop presence on the finish. Much hoppier than most Wee Heavy beers that I've had. Extremely drinkable at a surprising 8.3% ABV."
"A nice scotch but not one I would rush to find again....despite my score a slight disappointment to me as I expected this to be one of my favorite wee heavys."
"Brownish barleywine appearance. Aroma whaffing of alcohol, also barleywineish and some spice and roast. Taste well balanced though followed by tongue numbness. Hops at finish with roast. Very well malted, some sweet rather than bitter chocolate, and cinammon, and a touch of smoke. and an easy drink."
"D- Superb drinkability. Incredibly well disguised alcohol content. I had no idea it was an 8% beer until I read it here--could be dangerous. Goes down incredibly smoothly and begs for another to replace it."
"drinkability: yes... all day long..."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for 8.3%. Been featured as the ""beer of the month"" at my bar and I can put away more than a few without complaint. A good everyday colder weather beer."
"Overall, an enjoyable Scotch ale; as usual, it's a shame I can't buy it around here."
"Drinkability: A very good Wee Heavy, though the mouthfeel is a bit thick"
"The appearance is brown like a dark, hazy, undercarbonated root beer. The smell is sweet and like a weak version of the Sam Adams Triple Bock, scaring me immediately! The taste is actually pretty good compared to what the aroma prepares you for. It has a tomoto taste on the front palatte and a chocolate taste on the back. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and the beer is quite drinkable. This is a decent beer and definitely the most drinkable beer with bastard in the name that I have come across... it is also quite drinkable for it's high alcohol content. At the same time, I probably won't buy this beer again."
"A dead-on American interpretation of the style."
"Verdict- Auch, laddie! Okay, the label is pretty cheesy, with the caricature of a Scotsman on it and the ScotchTalk (""It ain't fer the wee lads..."") on the neck, but I like this beer. It's a tasty, hefty brew."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite Scotch ale, but pretty drinkable. I'd rather have a Belhaven."
"Nice, full bodied beer with great complexity and flavor. Alcohol is well subdued as well."
"Probably my favorite scotch ale so far. But not even close to my favorite style of beer..."
"Another wonderful beer from the folks at Founders."
"Music: ""Caukazoid Germ"" by Sixtoo"
"This beer pours a bubbly brown with a thin, sparse head that leaves a good bit of lacing. The nose has lots of biscuit and toast aromas along with some date and raisin notes. It tastes great! There is a nice balance of bread, chocolate and fruit with the first taste. The carbonation is quite crisp, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is very smooth and the alcohol is hardly noticeable. This beer is highly drinkable. I will definitely have another when the opportunity arises. Another great beer from Founders."
"Anyway, I digress. It's an ok beer, nothing to write home about. I, however, look forward to many more Wee Heavies in my future."
"Drinkability/Notes: II was very impressed with this brew. I wasn't expecting much and got the world. Should have known better considering it is a Founders beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Founders Dirty Bastard pours out a dark brown color with an inch of tan head. Very sweet butterscotch aroma. Caramel and fruit flavor with some bubblegum. Overly sweet. A little sour. Some woodchip flavor comes in at the finish and makes the beer a little smoky. Mouthfeel is full. Drinkability suffers a little from the sweetness. This is a decent beer, but I don't really like the bubblegum flavor."
"I was a bit worried, because of the high carbonation, that the beer was infected, but I don't get any of that in the taste. As the beer warms up a bit I get a note reminiscent of rum in the finish (both a bit of alcohol heat and the fermented/ distilled molasses flavor). This is quit a tasty beer and, unlike some of their other high octane offerings, this one has a nice balance to it, despite being a malt bomb."
"Nice smooth full body, but not much carbonation. Overall a nice aroma and flavor with a smooth mouthfeel make this a drinkable brew."
"The mouthfeel is very dry with a nice bite in the finish. Body is fairly full and coats the mouth well. I couldn't (or wouldn't want to) manage to drink more than one of these in a night, or at all. Unfortunately this one's kind of a miss from Founders, uncharacteristicly of their other beers that I've had the pleasure of trying."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is medium to full bodied. Has a very smooth chewy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: This beer is tasty but it seems to have an identity crisis. It is a porter ina scotch ale bottle."
"Thick and creamy mouthfeel, like Rogue Dead Guy. I'd have to be in the mood to drink a bunch of these in a row, but I will make sure there are a few in my beer fridge at all times."
"This is one of the best American Scotch ales I've had. Just fantastic."
"EDIT: I think I reviewed this as a BA neophyte as I've really grown attached to it in recent years. I find myself getting it whenever I can either trade or travel for it. If you like the style, this is on par with Old Chub."
"Best name ever though, it should be said!"
"Pours a murky brown in my glass. Moderate head that vanishes quickly. Not a ton of aroma, some carmel notes there though. Taste is earthy and smoky, a nice blend. Nice body, lightly carbonated enough, but not overpowering. This is a pretty good representation of the style. Not great, but pretty good."
"Overall a very good wee heavy. Tons of flavors and complexity. I have to wonder why I haven't bought more Founders brews in the past when I have had the chance. I won't pass them up in the future after this one."
"Awesome."
"The mouthfeel is heavy-bodied, but not quite as heavy as their Russian Imperial Stout. It goes down smooth and is a little warm at 8.3%, which I gladly welcome. The drinkability is fine for maybe a couple of these, but I probably wouldnt want to drink them all night."
"Overall, this is a very nice Scotch Ale. The high abv is certainly noted, but I think on the whole it gives the beer a very good sipping quality. This is not a brew to drink all night, but a couple suffice nicely."
"Cloudy dishwater murk, alternately a muddy brown and a tawny red...complexity in the appearance...hell yeah. Big foamy head in the snifter and carbonation rivalling a dry Irish stout. Nose is rum soaked butterscotch and caramel--you must let this beer warm to bring out the true nose and flavors. Taste is malty sweet up front, with more of the caramel coating giving it a fuller mouthfeel. There is a bit of a hop bite on the end to tell you that this is American...again, this comes out after it warms a bit. Too drinkable to be 8.3% Another excellent American take on the Scotch Ale."
"This is the first beer I have tried by Founders that I do not particularly care for. Its okay but only a tad above average in most categories. The color is a good brownish amber. No head, no lace. Slightly flat. Smell is malty and there are some woody hop essences. All the smells are present on the tongue too but when you compare this against a Robert the Bruce as an example, there is no comparison. This one is a minor leaguer."
"Overall: This beer is loud and in your face, but I like it. Good for when your looking for something to punch you around a bit."
"overall- pretty nice beer. balanced flavors with smooth feeling and roasted malt taste. nice change from what ive been drinking lately."
"Poured dark brown from growler, thin head with lace, malt, alcohol and a chocolate nose. Taste is a mix of malty chocolate, toffie, and a hint of smoke mixed with alcohol, my guess is wyeast 1728 for the yeast. a bit thin feeling at first with a malty thick finish. This is a great example of a scottishwee heavy in my opinion. one of the better scottish heavys I have sampled here in michigan overall. My hats off to Nate and the staff at Founders, you have a winner here."
"This would be a beer to have again as a sipping beverage, like wine or liquor, after dinner, in 6oz glasses. Nice. Of course, I'd prefer a stout or porter, but man..."
"A good beer to sit down and really enjoy, but not for a session."
"Thank you, good night and always get the cheese course."
"Pours a dark brown color with a big tan head the recedes quickly. The aroma is strong and relaxing. Huge roasted malts, chocolate, and alcohol peaking through. The taste is malty, chocolatey, buttery, and huge all around. The mouthfeel is slightly more than medium bodied, but not as smooth as a scotch ale can be. Overall, the is a damn good brew. Recomended to all."
"drinkability: alcohol fairly well hidden"
"This beer pours a deep ruby red that lets only a little light through. The head is thick, fluffy and light brown. It fades very slowly, leaving very thick laces. This beer had a malty aroma. I can slightly detect an alcohol aroma. It also smells of caramel. This beer has a strong malty flavor. The alcohol makes an appearence in the flavor, slightly warming my throat as it goes down. It has a slight caramel taste. The hops also make an appearence in the taste. The hop flavor is very subtle. The roasted malts are the most noticable flavor. This beer goes down smooth. It is full bodied. The carbonation is just right. This beer might not make the best session beer. It is slightly high in alcohol, so you might not be able to drink many bottles. The flavor, however, is not all that aggressive, so you might be able to enjoy a few bottles. I think this is a great beer. I would probably keep at least one or two of there in my refrigerator if I could get this beer in San Diego. Thank you karst for, as usual, sending me a winner."
"The beer is remarkable smooth and slides down the throat with a sense of heaviness that is not too intense. The high abv is hidden very well. Its only presence is in the warmth of the tummy. This is a great wee heavy that hits the spot."
"Reddish brown colour, mostly clear. Very light brown head that sticks around. Very malty aroma with a moderate hoppiness. Lots of caramel and toffee, nearing the level of a barleywine. There's really not a lot of complexity in the flavour. Malty sweetness with plenty of caramel and toffee. Moderate bitterness with a malty finish. Full bodied, low carbonation. Smooth texture and slightly drying from the grain. This is a really good beer, highly drinkable with plenty of high quality malt and hops. Another winner from Founders."
"Pours a beautiful amber/garnet red with a half inch creamy tan head that dies quickly. Nose is rich: scotchy alcohol, caramel and chocolate malts. Heady stuff. Taste is almost identical to Lake Louie's Warped Speed Scotch Ale which is a good thing. Rich caramel malts and pungent scotch which explodes into the sinuses as you exhale. This stuff packs a punch at 8.3% and you can tell. The alcohol is woody and aged like scotch, so it's not off-putting at all. This is a sipper that's creamy and smooth in the mouth and goes down with a nice bite. A treat for the nose and the mouth equally."
"Pours a hazy red/brown, nice head that goes quick and lots of lace. Smell is very basic, hops and malt! Not complex but very balanced and smells great. The malt smells really deep. Taste is sweet malt up front, burnt bread , some floral hops and a bitter finish. Very smooth, mouthfeel is perfect, excellent beer. Thanks DrJay."
"It came with a very nice short, but steady and well retained head that left lacing as I sipped my way to the bottom of the glass. The beer itself was a deep brown with a reddish tinge. I smelled sweet and roasty malts with this one. Dirty Bastard tasted like strong malts that smoothly transition to a dry hopiness that finishes off the palat with a little bit of the alcohol poking through at the finish, but not merely as much as I expected with this high of an ABV. The mouthfeel was on the heavy side, but this is a great beer to drink and something that I'ld pick up some other time when the weather gets colder."
"I am offically old now, as I have forsaken carnal pleasures with my fiance on my birthday in favor of a series of malty beers."
"Looks like a porter or a stout, very dark with a modicum of carbonation that leads to a small, appropriately dirty head. Smells of burnt/roasted coffee and chocolate. There's a nice dark chocolate smell and taste to this beer. Tastes pretty bitter and alcoholic, but not unpleasantly so. The mouthfeel takes a hit from the burn of the alcohol, which isn't hidden especially well. A good companion to the Breakfast Stout."
"Another outstaninding offering from the Founders folks! Definately need to stop over at the tap-rom and try this draught. But not too many, I'll never be able to make it home!"
"I did a complete reversal on drinkability finding this most enjoyable after some initial shock."
"If you see this, give it a try! It is truly exceptional."
"dark slightly ruby brown. i coudn't coax too much of a head out of this. malty aromas prevail with toffee and buttery ripe dark fruits raisin mostly. at times i pick up a pumpernickel smell. some caramel as it warms. juicy malt and toffee dominate the taste a fruitiness sort of like apple cider. a faint spiced flavor goes a long with it. there is a little bit of a peaty flavor to be found here, but it is covered up a lot by some of the rich malt flavors. some bitterness balances things out some. caramel and chocolate come out in the taste with some warmth. full rich mouthfeel lends itself well to the flavors. good drinkability for relatively high alcohol. a good sipping beer and a solid scotch ale. i'd like to see some more peat in here though."
"Another nice beer from Founders. Poured out to a amber / burnt red color with low carbonation and a short lived head. Minute traces of lace were noted. Scent is slighly roasted malt, with a touch of sweetness. This brew is all in the flavor. First sip, and you are pummled with an array of flavors; malt, sweetness, a touch of caramel and a smoke like finish. Quite impressive. The mouthfeel is slightly overly sticky and syrupy for me, and seeming quite thick. Finished with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Somewhat reminded me of a grand cru. Recommended for fans of the Scotch Ale style."
"Drinkability is very good one of the better Scotch Ales I have had, even if my score doesn't indicate it. Love the guys at Founders most of the stuff from them has been very nice indeed. Wish I could buy this stuff locally man I could spend $500 and 12 hours to road trip just to buy Founders stuff. Want to thank merlin48 yet again for another great sample."
"Finishes warm and sticky. Drinkable as a sippin brew, very similar to a liquor or scotch."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a pretty thin off-white head,big bold aromas of butter and brown sugar with some whiskey notes in there as well the alcohol is very prevelant.Flavors of dark fruit and alcohol are big here with some caramel just adding to the sweetness but this is fine for the style a big malt bomb for sure here.A warmer a sipping beer alcohol makes itself known for sure I have to stop now or I wont see the ending of Revenge of the Sith."
"I picked up a six pask of this American made Scotch Ale at Sam's Wine on Butterfiled in Downers Grove. Right off the bat the smell from the bottle is rich. The first thing that comes to mind when the first taste is computed by my brain is COFFEE, with a quickly depleting toffee aftertaste. One rule of thumb I apply to moutfeel is its chugability. Not implying that I chug every beer I try, but to get an idea if this beer is something that lends itself to be guzzled easily. This beer is not condusive to chugging. The name Beer Advocate gives as an alternate name for Scotch Ale, Wee Heavy. Which fits this beer very well. A strong coffee like taste covers up any hint of alcohol. But since its flavor is so heavy, you can only drink a couple of them before you get full of this great American made Scotch ale."
"Really getting into this brewery. After trying their Black Rye I've been trying to get my hands on their other stuff. This is another solid offering. Pours a deep but clear brown color with ruby highlights and a pretty good head that sticks aroudn for a while. A real strong bourbon smell coming from this one. Nice. It's present in the taste as well, but it isn't overwhelming, as it mixes nicely with all the sweet flavors this beer has to offer. Nice toffee malts and a bit of chocolate, as well as some raisins and a slight (very slight) smoked feel. Very warming, this is great right now (May) but would be even better on a cold winter evening when you're snowed in. Slick and slightly chewy mouthfeel, but still pretty drinkable at %8.3. An interesting brew from a company that tends to produce some pretty unique stuff."
"Mouthfeel was OK, but drinkability is rated lower, because it just didn't meet my image of a scotch ale as much, so I wouldn't go back to it as readily as, say, a Sam Adams scotch ale."
"Nice Brew!"
"A real delight and very much recommended"
"Comes on a bit strong, definitely a sipper. Very tasty though. I wouldn't mind another *wee* glass."
"The taste is just about on par with the scent. You get the caramels and roasted tastes mingled with an apple cider like base. Brown sugar finish with a dryness that could either be alcohol, or hopping, or a mixture of both. Flavours cover the alcohol accents very well, but one can definitely sense the warmth of the alcohol content. This is a good beer. It could stand to have a bit more flavour though. Overall, I would like to have jut a bit more malt sweetness. The hopping seems to be good, but could benefit from a more intense sweetness to make this thing a smoothly balanced beast. It just seems to be missing thickness or something. Still, the ODB is a good MOFO."
"Somewhat muddy brown in color. Hazy. Little to no head. Very low aroma-what I do get has a ""wet towel"" smell to it. Not sour but something wet or stale. Malty flavor-some notes of licorice and caramel. Nice sweetness behind it all. Very nice, full body for the style. An ok beer. Im a tad dissappointed as the other Founders products I have had have all been outstanding. Perhaps this was out of date. This is a definate try again beer to see if my opinion holds."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone. I love Scotch Ales and I don't think there are enough of them out there (although I do get sick of explaining to my friends that it doesn't mean they put whiskey in the beer). I am always excited to find this one on the shelf."
"Slàinte!"
"Drinkability - tasty and eaasily habit-forming."
"Full bodied, ok drinkability the full taste and ABV would have me looking for something else after a couple."
"Thanks to brewedlyhooked13 for this 12 oz bottle. Founders has quickly become one of my favorite breweries and this Wee Heavy doesn't disappoint. Dirty Bastard pours a hazy, deep burnt orange body with a very small beige head that quickly vanishes, leaving only a few spots of patch lace. Aroma is complex and inviting. Big malty notes of toffee, maple syrup, and molasses are complimented by a touch of charred wood and some prominent hop notes of spruce pine and citrusy grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied, almost chewy, with somewhat low carbonation. Taste is plenty malty for the style, with caramel, toffee, and molasses. Lots of burnt and roasty malt flavors as well as a note of smoked almonds. Surprisingly tart, with grapefruit and pine cone hops that suggest some Cascades hops in the mix. Some green apple notes add to the tartness. Alcohol is very well concealed. Malt character reasserts toward the finish, but this one is very well balanced, overall. Very tasty and highly drinkable. An interesting take on a Scotch Wee Heavy that works for me."
"This Scotch Ale poured a cloudy, tea-colored brown with tan foam that settled flat. The smell was caramel malty with a hint of spiciness. The taste was very nice: malty, caramel, light sweetness, and only a slight hint of alcohol. The alcohol was well hidden. The mouthfeel was smooth with full body and modest carbonation. The caramel malt flavor lingered pleasantly. This was a very nice beer. It was somewhat unusual for the style, in my opinion, in that it was less sweet than many Scotch Ales that I have sampled."
"This has a nice overall body for a scotch ale, but lacks something. I think I was looking for a greater malt flavor. Something a little deeper; fuller. Dirty Bastard is a litlte hoppier than I expected too. If I was in the mood, I'd probably seek this out again."
"Murky brown body that reveals violet-ruby highlights in the light. Capped by a creamy, light sandy head. Laces the glass nicely. Aromas of sweetish caramel and chocolate, with a rich, smoky, peaty accent and a whiff of Scotchy alcohol. Rich sugary malt up front, along with dark fruits (plums) and chocolate. Light smoky character throughout. Tannin-like bitterness leads into a bitter, woody finish with residual brown sugar sweetness. Big, thick, full, creamy, exquisite feel. A nice beer, and unlike most Scotch ales I've had."
"I always look forward to a Founders brew I havent tried as they have always impressed me. Appears a deep reddish brown with a small cap of tan foam floating on top. The foamy topping dissipates fairly quickly leaving some scattering of lace to decorate the glass. Malty sweetness fills your nose with notes of dark fruits and a bit of chocolate. The fruits notes really stand out as this warms, pleasant but a bit simple overall. Chocolate covered fruits are tasted first before a hint of alcohol. There are roasty malt notes as well. Finishes with a roasty chocolate sweetness. About a medium body though a little thin but smooth. Easy drinking stuff here. Tasty brew that I could easily drink several off but not quite up there with the best in the style. Thanks for sharing tikkigodxxx."
"Ummm, Hmmm!! Dirty Bastard indeed! Poured a great hazy brown/ruby red with a lite brown head that quickly dissipated (unfortunately). However, the taste was superb, great caramel, malt (was that some scotch whisky?) start with a lite hop finish. Whoo, a medium texture that chewed a little bit. Got a nice alcohol glow. Gonna look for more Founders varieties in the future, and would luv to see some more D.B. Scotch ale in my fridge."
"Thanks for the brewski, MoeSizlak"
"This has a sweet malty nose with some bubblegum in the taste coupled with dark malt flavors with raisin overtones. It has a thick mouthfeel and is on the sweet side. The carbonation in this is abundant and contributes to a nice mouthfeel. The hops impart a bitterness to the beer that cannot offset the sweetness. It is too sweet in my opinion."
"pours a murky copper, with a frothy dirty looking head. Nice head retention on this one. Smells alcoholic and of caramel. Taste is caramel and toffee followed by a blast of grassy hop bitterness, and finishes off with some warming alcohol to it. Mouthfeel is pretty full and good for the style. Drinkability is pretty damn good for being 8+%. Overall a solid scotch, Founders is becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"A solid, all around good brew."
"Not my favorite style and a little too sweet for me, but this is a nice, well made beer."
"Had this one based on the amusing name, I'm sure I'm not the first nor the last. Anyway, It poured with a mostly brown body and a very thin layer of head that produced a surprising amount of lace. My first reaction was how huge, chewy, and full bodied the mouthfeel was. There is a nice candied malt flavor that waltzes nicely with a brandy-like quality. The real beauty is in the finish. It starts with sweet licorice intermingled with faint grape and woody notes. Ultimately there is just enough balancing bitterness deep in the palate. Really an awesome scotch ale in my opinion."
"Idle question: Are Founders and Dragonmead using the same yeasts? Is there a cultural underpinning to the shared sweetness of their styles?"
"A bit raw with its grainy alcohol, and it has its moments (both pro and con) but regardless, this is a solid Scotch ale."
"from the bottle poured a nice dark ruby, with a tan head. aroma, malts, caramels, light smoke hints of raisins, and hops, with just a hint of alcohol, enjoyed the aroma of this one. flavor mlats, raisins caramels, chocolte, toffee, and some cheeries. this was a good beer."
"Many thanks to the Man, cokes himself, for my first sample of Founders. They're off to a good start with me."
"What a great scotch ale! Malty and roasty, very smooth brew. A little peppery with a slight soy flavor. Color was a deep brown with little head (didn't notice much lacing), so there was nothing exceptional about the appearance. Alcohol content is noticable and had a nice warming effect. Not a beer you'd want to sit down and finish a whole six pack of. A nice domestic craft brew, highly recommended."
"Nice, rich flavors with an attractive spicy touch. Good times had by all. Just tasty all the way."
"Came is a short 12 oz. brown bottle, with a nice quote on the neck putting me in the mood for the experience. The beer poured dark red with an inch thick head on top. Lacing was top notch. The aroma was malty and dusty with some floral hops peeking through. The taste was sweet (raisins, cherries, and chocolate), nutty, and smoky. The bitterness was minimal, and the aftertaste was clean. The mouthfeel was chewy with a tongue coating stickiness. A nice soothing beer for a damp and dark winters night."
"Drinkability: suffers some just because the alcohol is not shy about making it's presence known. Good stuff. Definitely something to warm the cockles in the winter."
"Poured a semi-hazy burnt amber in color with an initially monstrous tannish-colored head. After an eternity, it finally settled down to a finger-thick level. Sporadic lacing of the glass. Aromas are dominated by chewy-thick caramel. Notes of dark figs and spices. Flavor is very sweet, but tempered somewhat by a hoppy bitterness. Finish is a complex mix of sweetness, toasted grains, Heath bars, and a hint of smoke. Low-medium carbonation. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. Even with an ABV of 8.3%, this one is quite easy to throw down."
"Pours a light tan, one finger-head that goes slowly leaving a good lace. Deep amber color. Light carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is raisiny. Starts sweet with hops in the background, finishes with some bitterness. Still easy to drink, alcohol is not noticeable. $3.75 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Not bad, but not interesting either. Definitely below average. Not worth another shot."
"Founders has quickly become one of my favorite breweries and Dirty Bastard has done nothing but move them farther up the list. If you like Scotch ales or just like big, rich, interesting, delicious beer, then you have to seek this one out."
"Mouthfeel is quite pleasant, and there is surprising drinkability for a beer of this strength and maltiness. The hop level isn't to style, but it makes it a whole hell of a lot more interesting, and really improves the drinkability. Nice noveau strong Scottish."
"I don't know, but after a six pack its pretty damn tough to finish just one bottle. Its mean to compare but this is a rough mix compared to, say, Orkney Skullsplitter. A nice beer to have everyone once in awhile, but a real mouth-kicker that slows the quaffing down."
"Appearance: Pours a thick murky mahogany brown with a big creamy tan head leaves behind scattered specks of lacing. Aroma: Deep roasty caramel notes touch of smoked malts with chocolate edges and an herbal hop character just peeking in. Taste: Full flavored Scotch ale deep ripened fruit undertones with an nice chocolate and caramel roastiness, subtle hop profile just the way a Scotch ale should be. Mouthfeel: Full bodied gets even better as it warms mild carbonation allowing full enjoyment of all the flavor this brew has to offer. Drinkability: Decent one at a time brew, definitely wouldn't mind more access to some of the Founders lineup."
"A dark brown ale with amber hints. Has a very small dark beige head that leaves a small bit of lace. There is a nice caramel toffee sweetness to the aroma. Maybe even a light hint of smoke in the aroma also. Molasses, licorice, roasted malt bitterness all jump all over your tongue. A nice sweet carmel toffee flavor sits down on the back of your tongue for a smooth warm finish."
"much thanks to TikiGodXXX for sharing this Grand Rapids treasure with me!"
"This is definitely one of the best scotch ales being made in the Midwest. It stands tall next to Three Floyd's Robert the Bruce, which I think is a good point of comparison. Thicker and more achoholic tasting, but less chocolately and complex. It's really too close to call between the Bobby the Bruce and the ODB. Either way, this is a very delicious beer which is able to keep a high level of drinkability despite the booze taste by compensating with a velvety mouthfeel."
"Poured a deep reddish brown with a two finger head that lasted a bit then dissipated into great lacing. Smell is heavy on the malt, but with distinct fruity quality, somewhat like cherries and plums. Initial sweetness lasted through mid-palate and the drifted into a light slightly dry and bitter finish that lasted and left a pleasant mouthfeel. For the high abv, quite drinkable, although a couple would mellow one out quite nicely. Alos, definitely let this one warm up...it improved greatly as it warmed."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the murky reddish brown brew. Head showed reasonable retention, and laces with a layer foam pretty much wherever it has been. Aroma is a sweetly malty, with an alcohol undercurrent, as expected. Taste follows the nose, heavily malty, and the alcohol packs quite a punch on the back of the throat. A bit overboard in that department for me. Mouthfeel is okay, as I said, the alcohol character could be abit more subdued, but it grows on you (or numbs you, perhaps). The drinkability is good enough to convince you drink more than you probably need..."
"Big, bold, & smooth. Intense malt drips all over the tongue. Some fruity accents weave in and out, and hints of chocolate come out as it warms. Just the slightest kiss of hops balance quite nicely. Medium bodied with modest carbonation."
"Anudder U.P. danks to trbeer der don't cha'ya know!"
"Pours a nice deep amber to brown liquid with a white foamy head. The head on this beer stayed for a long time, and there was a great amount of lace on the glass. Smells like a toasted malt, and not a whole lot alse. Nice toasty, to roasted malt, leaving almost a toffe like taste. Very little bitterness, and not much hop presence in this, this one is all about the malt. Medium body with low carbonation. Overall, this is a very good scottish/scotch ale. Pretty drinkable, and easy to enjoy."
"Notes: This seemed like a fine Americanized Scottish style of beer. It seemed a bit too roasty to me, and less heavy on the caramel of the malt. But it's definately a good beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep hazy brownish-red color with one finger of off-white head. There is just a little lacing left on the glass. The smell is extremely malty, a little sweet. There are traces of caramel, honey, and alcohol present. The taste is also very malty, toffee and brown sugar, a sweet alcohol tang. Only a touch of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is a little light for the style. The drinkability isn't too bad for an 8.3% brew. A fair American representation of a Scotch Ale."
"Not a bad Scotch Ale at all, especially for scotch whiskey lovers who would appreciate the very peaty smoked character to it. I personally prefer mine a bit more sweet, but this isn't bad at all, and I would have this one again. Thank you to trbeer for the beer!!"
"There's a bit less smell associated with DB than I would have thought for such a strong, malty brew. But the flavor! This is immediately recognizable as a Scotch ale as you taste the sweet malts and thinly masked alcohol. I was reminded of Southern Comfort as I took more sips. Sweetness, malts, and alcohol. If you don't like those flavors, then step away from the DB."
"Deep brown with amber highlites-a good sticky while minimal head that is accompanied by very ample lace. Strong in the aroma department with black coffee followed by a burst of hop-some sweet malt faintly chimes in. Big and rich in the mouth with a creamy viscous texture. Flavors run deep-caramel, dark chocolate, fruitcake, black licorice, and plenty of twangy hop to keep it interesting. The finish continues long and deep-the only way to stop the delightful lingering flavor would be to get out some grub. I can see this standing up to something rich and meaty-perhaps a dry aged hanger steak accompanied by some fries, and a side of super fresh, crispy vegies of choice. Or maybe a beef stew with plenty of potato, pea and carrot!? A great choice for a Winter Warmer!"
"Drinkable but you wouldn't spend all night with it. A solid beer given to me by JahNoth. Thanks."
"There is a thin and slightly mouthfeel to the brew, but personally that doesn't effect the drinkability too much. This a keeper, one to be enjoyed during it's seasonal run."
"Pours a deep reddish brown hue with a white head, a very nice deep maltiness with a little bit of hops thrown in to provide a nice amount of bitterness, a little bit more than I hav tasted in this style of beer before, but it does not really seem out of place. Nice caramelly maltiness, a very enjoyable beer."
"I saw the name on this one and a I couldn't pass it up. I'm a sucker for offensive marketing I guess. Pours a reddish-brown color with a moderate brown head and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma was very sweet, a bit of caramel, and alcohol. The flavor was very sweet, like the aroma, but not too sweet. The maltiness is present in the flavor as well as the alcohol and a tiny bit of the vanilla. This was an interesting beer, nice mouthfeel and not too hard to drink."
"Pours a dark copper color. No head whatsoever produced, yet carbonation was solid. Aroma of caramel, toffee and malt. Taste is very sweet with some medium bitterness in hte middle. Very nice full mouthfeel with just a hint of alocoholic warmth on the back end."
"Lightly turbid deep ruby in hue. Creamy, massed, tan head leaves respectable lace. Deep, satiating waft of caramel drizzled biscuit along with hints of roasted barley and alcohol heat in aroma. As it warms, agreeable hints of almond and sweet cocoa surface and provide additional depth. Quite luscious and decadent, yet pleasantly clean aromawise. Maple syrup laced cookie sweetness upfront in flavor is complemented by gentle combination of roasted grain derived bitterness and equable, rounded dark caramel sweetness. Hop bitterness is paltry. Once roasted grain character fades residual sweetness surfaces towards the forefront of flavor, but remains judiciously both dextrin like and toasty in character, and thus avoids a cloying, sugary nature. A bit shy in body to support the malt profile, but a passable viscosity allows for ominously easy, fluid drinking. Whiskey macerated plum along with hints of diacetyl emerge late, adding a buttery dessert like richness, which finally signals beefiness to the palate. Finishes with fading notes of dilute carob and roasted nut. Dirty Bastard is a brew that improved tremendously as it breathed and warmed. Its rich, simple malt character is both satiating and appetizing... my belly craves more. With a firmer body this could be top notch. An impressive find."

"On rare occasions I find a beer that has as its major attribute the aroma that it provides. Such is the case with Dirty Bastard, a lovely strong ale that provides volumes of rich malty aroma with a faint whiff of the hops presence. A lovely brew to look at as well, its hazy red hues are quite warming to behold. The flavor is of the malt richness, but it also provides a surprising level of hop bitterness. I was at once surprised and delighted by the beer after having my palate set up by two hoppy offering just before it. The fullness of this malty brew countered their light bodiedness quite well. The feel is rich and smooth and the drinkability is hampered rather more by the fullness of its body than by its high ABV."
"Its great to see Founders in Ohio, one if not my favorite Michigan brewer. A ""wee heavy scotch"" on thisone, but a nice warm you-up brew. It pours a dark burgandy, deep red, with a thick pillowtop off- white head with super lace, thick & sticky. Not a strong aroma, just a hint of a sweet malt. The taste is very hoppy for a scotch. Its floral with a hint of brown sugar & malt. The mouth is left with a floral hop-oil coat while a slight alcohol dryness or bitter settle in. A good drinkable strong ale, though a bit bitter than others of this style. A good find for winter cellar stock."
"The body is rubied leather topped by a fading crown of buttered straw (brown with ruby highlights and faded khaki with an oddly strongly yellow tint). The aroma is nicely malty, but it hints that this is a bit old. Still a beer this old shouldn't have too much of a problem surviving. The flavor is brown sugar and leaf litter and a surprising amount of hop bitterness for a scotch. Unfortunately, there's a bit of a metallic nature about the hops that I find slightly unpleasant."
"This beer does not really resemble most scotch ales. The alcohol taste, which is predominate in most scotch ales I've tried, isn't even there. What I do taste, though, is something good. A pretty thick body to this one that starts out with a malty, brown sugar type sweetness. It's followed up by an onslaught of malts, hops, and spices. I taste a bready, chewy texture in this one. It finishes with more of that brown sugar sweetness. Much sweeter than most scotch ales. But it is also better than most scotch ales. Another great one from Founder's!"
"On draught at Lazy Chameleon in Powell, OH. This beer is a dark brown with a copper hue and a thin light beige head. Very little lacing. Aroma is mostly caramel malt with a little spice thrown in. The flavor was not really reminiscent of other Scotch Ales I have tried. It seemed to be leaning more toward a Brown Ale. Flavors of caramel, malt, molasses and brown sugar are all there, but not in the doses you would expect. Still, it is not a bad beer. The finish is more bitter than most Scotch Ales as well."
"This beer poured a hazy reddish brown color and formed light tan foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation and some sediment is present. A complex aroma of malt, caramel, raisins and other dark fruit. Not as heavy an aroma as others, but more in the mix if you will. The flavor was of malt, caramel, slight bit of chocolate and a hint of raisin. A slightly lighter body than I would expect for this style and slightly sweet finish. The alcohol is well hidden in this one. Also best if had at cellar temp or just slightly cooler to help draw out more of it's character."
"A light brown with some red highlights, thin head. A complex aroma, some bread, malt, alcohol and raisins to be noted, simply awesome. A full bodied beer, hence the ABV, with some complex flavors as well. Oak, raisin, some port and bready taste up front, the alcohol is hidden, yet noted. The flavors get better as this baby warms up. One of the top scotch ales I've ever had, or one of the top beers I've ever had, get some now."
"Crystal clear dark garnet brew forms a thin beige head atop small bubbles with medium carbonation. Aroma is heavy with amber malts, with subtle notes of figs and dates, a fruity fermentation, some incense, and mild, dusty hops. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth with a medium dense body. Taste starts out with a brief up-front subdued hop notes, then immediately cascades into a firm, chewy malty body with hints of peat smoked malt...ending in a mildly astringent malty finish, a spicy yet rubbery hop note, and some brief fusels. Not being a big fan of Scotch ales, I thought this was okay, but probably not something I would buy again."
"Founders Dirty Bastard: let me start this review by pointing out that I do not like Scotch Ale. But I love this Scotch Ale. Deep brownish black, not a whole lot of head, and no lace. Really nice sweetness from the malts, that makes this beer easy to drink and to savor. Buy it if you find it."
"Reddish-brown in color, has a huge foamy clingy off white head that leaves a clingy lacing in my glass, has a sweet fruity, bready and citrusy hoppy aromas. Nice sweet fruity cherry flavors balanced with alot of hops, nice bitter finish, medium body with a smooth creamy mouthfeel, pretty damn good."
"Drinkability: Good for an 8.3%abv brew. Drink a few of these and you will feel it... Very warming and relaxing...an awesome beer to warm yourself with in the winter. This was my first brew from Founders, but it won't be my last."
