"This one is apple way out front smell and taste at first. Then bread and some darker fruits much like a bunch of other winter ales. Almost too sweet and are they sure this is 10% ABV. Not a big fan, probably won't have again."

"Delicious!  It isn't too dark and has a nice smooth texture.  All the good beers are seasonal!"
"I don't know what to make of the feel.  At the same time it seems there are thick malts, only in the mouthfeel and not the flavor, it's also light and a bit too bubbly or spritzy."
"This is a 10% beer that drinks like a lager.  Be afraid, be very afraid. It's awesome."
"Smells of sweet malt. Light but distinct smell/flavor of raspberries and caramel. A boozy bite on the tongue and in the throat. Very dry in the palate with a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Not bad for the high alcohol content."
"Very fruity taste and aroma"
"Medium brown/ruby in the light, clear appearance, very little head. 'Soda carbonation'. Light nose, bit of ssweetness, fruity esters present. Slightly sweet to taste, bit of smokiness coming through. Thin mouthfeel. Overly so. Bit of a cloying aftertaste. Could be richer, heavier (get it ?). Missing piece is the mouthfeel. I feel like my homebrewed Wee Heavy was stronger after the first try..."

"O - Ol' Red Cease & Desist is a decent brew, but many superior Wee Heavy Ales are available."

"A clear, reddish-brown liquid...the head is thin. Overall, the beer is unremarkable in appearance. The aroma is a little malty, with some caramel and toast notes. Full in body...it hides it's ABV. The brew is a little one dimensional and flat. It could be so much more."

"A descent high abv ale with a good malty flavor. The worst I can say about it is it is a little boring. Hides its strength, goes down easy enough. If you can get it for the right price, it's worth trying as a money-to-abv value. Otherwise, there are better beers and it's not really very true to the style."

"Overall, an okay beer, but nothing to write home about."
""
"Overall – More boozy then desirable, even for 10% ABV. Relatively fruity as if a somewhat Belgian version of the style."

"O- not a good wee heavy and i would only try this in a pinch. It gets better as its gets warmer. not a good sign."

"Enjoyed from bottle, may edit review if I try it again when I have my proper glassware. Smell is low-key malts and booze. Taste is smooth and malty at first, finishing hot and boozy but still smooth. Not a bad beer overall, although I assume with all the low reviews it's not a good representation of the style."

"Overall – An all right brew, but a bit more boozy then desirable, as it makes it quite difficult to sit, sip and enjoy."
"Full bodied, rich and smooth. Light coating on the tongue. This is even better after it warms up for 30 minutes. A much better beer than the Brothers think apparently."
""
"Overall: I just couldn't get over the canned corn aroma and flavor. It distracted me and effected this ones drinkability. Maybe mine was infected?"

"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, woody, caramel, and a small alcohol presence.. In the taste, woody, with notes of caramel, it starts with big alcohol but fades quickly. A small alcohol bite but mainly smooth with a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry woody and alcohol like aftertaste. A nice woody presence and nice alcohol that fades out."

""

"One o'my favorites from the brewers in Erie."
""
""
""
"Also, couldnt detect a trace of that 10% abv"
""
"This Wee Heavy is a fine beer, but its no more a Strong Scottish Ale as it is an ambiguous American Strong Ale, Barleywine, Imperial Red... or pick another strong beer. Tasty for a session perhaps but the beer just doesn't know what it is."

"This brew poured out as a really pretty looking red color with a creamy looking orangey head on it. The lacing was nice along the glass. The smell of the beer was sweet and malty, very pleasing aroma on this beer. The smell transferred perfectly to the taste where the peated malts meet with some caramel and brown sugar. The taste I found to be very very nice. The mouthfeel was smooth and kind of creamy, a little bit of carbonation working well on this beer. Overall this brew was worth trying on just about all levels in my opinion. I'm very surprised this doesn't have better reviews on here."
"Very smooth, very malty, quite sweet, and huge notes of autumnal fruits and spices make this a winner. Only drawback is that metallic taste at the beginning but that goes away very quickly."
"Overall: I like this one, but it is a sipper. It has a nice combo of earth and sweet malt. I wish I would have picked up more than just a single."
"o: this beer is a scotch ale??? my white behind!!! this beer is sweet and fruity with a sour aftertaste, if it were up to me this beer would be under flanders but i didnt brew it so ya...."
"Overall meh, decent beer, but missing something, a little boozy too."
"Its still a decent brew, but not the best by any means when it comes to the style. Its kind of lacking something. I feel it was missing more of the dark fruits you get in these brews. This brew has a decently high ABV, so be ready for a big hit as you SIP this brew."
"D - Overall a good beer, but not great. Has an out-of-place graininess and astringency and not enough warm malt sweetness for the style. I might have liked it better if it was labeled an Abbey style. I think it fits that style better."
"D- Overall, this is a decent beer that is worth a try. "
"D: Drinkability was forgiving enough. Still surprised that this was 10.1% which drank more like a 7% at best. Nice malty character, though not to expansive in the taste spectrum. Have to be careful you don't indulge in more then you should here, the alcohol is very well hidden."
"A rotten example of a Scotch ale, and one of the most awful beers I've ever had, this thing is a disgrace to the style. Like a good little Scotch ale enthusiast, I let it warm up for a while before opening it; my reward was a nose full of old vegetables and pink Sweetarts. The taste is sweet, salty and, at the same time, terribly bitter and sour and full of boiled peas. It gained a slightly pleasant malt characteristic after reaching room temperature; otherwise, this is a total and complete failure. If you want a good American Scotch ale, go find yourself a Founders Dirty Bastard."
"Again another score from Erie brewing. I am surprised by the much lower rating's when this taste's almost identical to Railbender just with a kick."
"D - All told a pretty decent offering. I'm a big fan of the style, but this seems a hair too boozy. I'd love to see the same beer at about 7.5 ABV."
"Poured clear red with a tall light tan head. There's a strong bready toast and crust aroma with a hint of toffee that's a little cleaner than most in the style. The flavor falls a little flat for such a strong beer. There's a earthy spice and creamy candy with the aroma's dark bread grain notes. I suppose it is smooth and easy to drink, but the character just seems muted given the strength."
"D- The aftertaste and lack of depth at 10.1% is a bummer and surprising"
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not my favorite style, but EBC achieves what they're going for here. I'm actually surprised by some of the low reviews on this one. Makes me wonder if people are taking the style into consideration. Being that this IS a winter seasonal, I personally like the high ABV."
"Not a good way to start the new year."
"This Wee Heavy pours an almost too clean and clear red. I mean a brilliant 90 minute boil ruby to a light red color. I poured this big beer into my Duvel Tulip glass. It Looks a little thin for a Wee Heavy. I smell sweet sweet malts. I did not detect anymore than a faint hint of booze smell. I detect no hops which is to style. The first taste is thicker than expected. I taste sweet malts at first followed by roasted flavored malts and some booziness. I did detect some spicy after taste that could have been some hops for balancing but they have been washed out by the booze and malts. I thought Ol Red CAD would be sweet and this beer is just that. I liked it.. I do have to say this is another solid beer by Erie but I think this Wee heavy is a little to one sided to be a home run. I will seek it out again though as it is a solid Wee Heavy which can be hard to come by in my area."
"All in all this is a nicely crafted beer. Would get this again."
"D - Well I don't know. I could use more flavor and this beer seems to be more of a ""get drunk"" kind of beer since it has a quickly thinning flavor and hardly detectable ABV. I may have it again."
"All in all, quite a good wee heavy. Best left for dessert....note: not WITH dessert, FOR dessert!"
"Overall Impression: I wasn't expecting this to be good, but wow was I wrong. This is marked as a wee heavy, but it actually reminds me very much of Old Stock Ale and Fuller's Vintage Ale (Old Ales). Less peaty than Traquair House Ale, which was welcome. Dryness is maybe not to style, but was also welcome. This is now my favorite beer that comes in 6-packs."
"I had a small glass of this at George Keeley's on Manhattan's Upper West side. I'd never heard of this beer before and I liked it quite a lot. Very typical for a scotch wee heavy. Good aroma, great color, outstanding flavor. I will have this again."
"Pours a rich brown in color with a small white head and some lace. Aroma of cherries, malt and alcohol. Flavor is good, malt, brown sugar, vanilla, cherry. The staggering alcohol is deceptively well hidden. Some years have done a good job mellowing this one out. Smooth and full bodied, this makes for a good sipper."
"A good wee heavy. Would like a bit more flavor, but this is a solid brew."
"This is a rather ho-hum wee heavy in the flavor department. But it tastes good and is drinkable, dispite the high alcohol. Good stuff."
"Pours a beautiful red, mahogany with little head. Aroma kinda had me in a recoil at first nose. Can't quite place it but it's bad. I'm guessing this is an old oxidized bottle, however, there's something odd beyond that. Diacetyl maybe. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the style. The flavor is actually quite nice though. Loads of malt with caramel, brown sugar, figs, dark fruit dominate that seem to balance well with the bitterness."
"D: A very nice scottish ale. This one is up there with Oscar Blues Old Chub in my book."
"Retained a nice offwhite head over a copperish body with a strong malt smell and some minor hop profiling to go with it. Real smooth and creamy and easy to drink, there is a decent amount of caramel and chocolate sweetness along with hints of bread and roasted malt to balance and give it some dey aftertastes. There are dark fruit and herbal hops in the backbite as well. Not a fave of mine yet for some reason I couldn't put this sucker down and I really liked it."
"a pretty solid beer overall and fits the style. drinkable enough to get you in trouble as the 10% doesn't hit you til the end of the glass. probably would buy this again in the future."
"I like the label and the name, but I have to say I don't like the beer that much. Definitely a little bit of a disappointment. One positive is that I would not have guessed that this sucker is over 10% ABV."
"D Fair due to the high ABV but also the less than impressive taste and feel. 3.5"
"Drinkability: Doesn't really match the style well at all, but I would definitely drink this again, the ABV feels pretty manageable for being 10.10% too."
"I guess all thats left to say is that you shouldn't let the subpar ratings scare you away from this beer, or any of Erie's offerings for that matter, I have found them to be quite enjoyable."
"Had this ale a little bit ago but if my memory serves me it was better than the review average would suggest. It's a nice beast of a beer from Erie, and I distinctly remember intense floral qualities and caramel stickiness with a bit of alcohol warmth. I would definitely get this again."
"Got this in a trade from steelersxl, thanks man! Dark red color, no surprise there, decent head and lacing, looks good. The smell is not like any wee heavy I've had its not peaty or smoky just very malty. The flavor is not bad at all but again it tastes more like a strong ale or red ale than a wee heavy as far as I'm concerned."
"Ol' Red Cease and Desist pours a dark reddish brown with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty, maybe a touch of fruit. The flavor is very malty, hops are nowhere to be found. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't notice any alcohol. I enjoyed this one, your mileage may vary."
"Overall - Kind of confused about this one. It doesn't taste bad really, but it tastes... off. I can't imagine that this beer is supposed to taste like that. It's almost like an artificial sweetener. Weird."
"D- this beer is missing something as a wee heavy. little too much bitterness with not the appropriate amount of malts to go along."
"Flavor is also pretty light, but decent...at first. Flavor hits in a little stronger as it sits on your tongue. Some warm caramel notes, sweet malts, mild carbonation, a slight bitter backside. Can taste the scotch, which is pleasant and warming. Decent beer."
"D – I would not drink more than one, especially given the strange flavor, 10% ABV, and the syrupy quality inherent."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a deep garnet red with little head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are sweet with a hint of peat smoked malt trailing in. Taste is similar with a very sweet initial flavoring of malts but the slight oddity of the peat trailing in at the end. Feel is full bodied with an oiliness that lingers. Drinkable for the style as the ABV limits intake."
"this might not be the greatest wee heavy,but it's a good beer especially considering the cost."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The highlight of this tasting is the beautifully smooth, prickly texture that begins and ends with a gentle ebb tide. Full and round, it lends the essential feature that improves the unique character of the flavors."
"This offering used to be called Red Ryder Big Beer. Apparently, those who hold the rights to the movie 'A Christmas Story' told Erie to cease and desist, since Red Ryder is the brand name of the air rifle that Ralphie wants so badly. Even if it isn't true, it's still an interesting story. I wish the same could be said of Ol' Red."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Samuel Smith Imp. pint glass. After pouring it retained about an inch and a half of frothy head with good carbonation. Deep ruby color. Very smooth sweet fruity esters. Biscuit like notes are pretty dominant in this malt bomb. No real hop notes. Alcohol is very noticed but it is still very pleasant to drink. In my thinking this is one of the better years for this brew."
"Erie Brewing Co. has some great beers, but this is not one of them. As I told my brother as I drank this, ""it's probably one of, if not the, worst beers I've ever tasted."" A disappointment indeed."
"Nothing really distinguished about this brew, but a good beer."
"Brownish amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is fruity.Taste is fruits and sugar cane.Alcohol is very very well hidden.Smooth and goes down like cold filtered water.This is something that could easily sneak up on you if not careful.I would recommned and purchase again."
"d- too much with no refinement. All i taste is alcohol. almost like drinking actual scotch. yuck. would not tell others to try it"
"A wonderful interpretation odf the wee Heavy. At 1st pour the beer does nothing to inspire you, just seems kind of run of the mill, although it does have an interesting almost maghonany like color sitting in the glass. It is with the first taste that you will fall in love with this beer. Very smooth and compelling flavor and an easy on the palate texture makes this an eminently drinkable ""big beer"" Not the type to have 3 or 4 a night, but a nice one to unwind from a stressful day and have in front of a nice fire."
"Overall, this is a good US version of the style but best reserved for those being broken-in to moe developed brews"
"D: Fairly good drinkability considering the abv, though I feel that the fruitiness and bitterness don't quite balance well enough. I would say this is an average Scotch Ale and the high abv is unnecessary IMO. For the ABV, there are many better beers I would rather drink."
"That little explosion of sweetness did it for me. I would definately drink this beer again. Not necessarily too many at once, but I will look for more. If I can find it."
"Pours a reddish copper color. The smell is of caramel and roasted malts with some fruity sweetness at the back end. The taste is of roasted caramel malt and some fruity sweetness with a hint of spice. The taste does give way to a little alcohol taste at the back end that lowers the taste a little. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth and not as thick as I expected. Overall this is a solid beer to drink but the alcohol after taste knocks it down to just average."
"This beer poured a dark copper with red highlights and a thin head. The smell is almost all toasted malt, with a little bit of dark fruitiness mixed in. The taste starts off with some sweet caramel malt followed by some raisin/plum that hides the alcohol remarkably well. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some moderate carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable little beer, and the alcohol is hidden dangerously well. One of my favorite styles and underrepresented by American Micros in my opinion. Definitely worth a try."
"D-Not bad, but has some negative qualities that don't hit the mark. A good beer but not one I would crave time and time again."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint glass. The ale appears a clear but dark amber color with a finger of quickly fading off white foam. Smell and taste is sweet, fruity, ripe cherries, a fair amount of sugary malt, molasses, biscuits, ever so slightly smokey. A bit lacking in body, especially for a 10ish % ale, but the ale is at least amply carbonated. Worth trying I suppose."
"D: Well, it is thin on flavor for a 10% beer IMO. While this would lend itself to be more drinkable, the harsh metallic burnt taste of this beer makes it less so. I've had much better scotch ales."
"It's just too harsh and my sobriety would be better spent on lower abv and tastier brews."
"Drinkability is ok, pretty simple, strong for sure, but not really fusely or anything. I've got one more that I'll sit on for probably 2 years and see what happens..."
"Drinkability- Heavy ABV will rule out drinking a few. A nice scotch ale with a big malt body. Overall quite a nice brew."
"Light reddish bronze colored beer. The head is of a very light tan. Notes of toast and smoke in the nose. Flavor is strongly malty, sweet, with notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar. It's a nicely balanced beer, but could benefit from a beefier body, natural carbonation. Decent Wee Heavy."
"I have chalked my bad tap experience up to a possible problem with the keg or the C02 line, or the poor, or something. But this beer is very drinkable, and is one of the better showings for Erie Brewing Company."
"All in all, not bad, even if a bit askew from the wee heavy norm. goes down fairly smoothly for the abv. a touch hot, although not necessarily in an alcohol way... the fruit and hop notes are unexpected, and somewhat unwelcome. The richness and malt qualities are there, but so is a good bit of other stuff that I'm not really diggin. I'd drink it again... it's a solid brew, but just not quite good enough to stand out in my mind."
"D- This beer has a nice full malt flavor that is well blended and smooth with a supporting bitterness that grows as it warms. The cidery quality added a bit of interest to the finish and was not off putting."
"Pours clear dark amber with a modest off white head and few lacings. Aroma is caramel. Taste is dark caramel, chocolate cherries, and an earthy hop bitter finish. Mouthfeel is alright but drinkability at 10% abv is too much for me. Reminds me a bit of drinking Port wine. Too much alcohol for this kid. At least I can tell the wife I only had one as I snooze in the recliner."
"For the malt lover."
"The aroma is sweet and malty with caramel, chocolate, nuts, and hops. The appearance is deep amber with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma with an alcohol finish. The palate is smooth. Overall this is a well made beer that hides the alcohol pretty well."
"D - I like high abv beers that can hide the alcohol taste...this one lets it through just a little too much for me"
"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a mild burnt toffee scent along with a light roasted character. The alcohol is barely noticeable. The taste is decent as well. It has a tastey caramel malt flavor with a light roasted/smokey feel. The alcohol presence is there, but well hidden. It goes down extremely smooth and finishes sweet with a dry edge. It seems a little thin for a Wee Heavy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking ""big"" beer. It's full flavored with an alcohol kick that's not too noticeable."
"Served last night off the cask at Piper's Pub, talk about excellent cellaring. These guys are pouring proper pints. Hug foaming khaki head completed with a smooth creamy texture, body is deep ruby garnett semi clouded. Smells tart with some underlying fruit and raisins. Very malty no real hop presence maybe just a little bit of earthiness. Flavor was okay a bit hot with alchol excessively sweet with malt flowing from every angle. Tart grape and raisins flood the palate as well. More earthy hops blended well. Mouthfeel is creamy silky smooth low well done carbonation, the mouthfeel is money. Drinkability overall is okay but the twang and loads of malt didn't completely agree with me, this is the same brew that went through some name changes but it's been around for quite sometime."
"a super light bodied ale for being so high in alcohol. good malty notes but not as heavy or malty as some wee heavys. well worth trying and the balance of the malt vs. alcohol is quite impressive"
"D- Very easy to drink a few of these, but at 10% i know i should be careful. For 10% i really could not taste the alcohol as much as i thought i would. it did come more as it warmed however."
"D: I couldn't drink more than one, and it's amazing I got beyond through that one. This beer is way too aggressive for me and just doesn't have enough redeeming flavor to sip."
"Thanks, kbuzz, for the chance to re-visit"
"I bought this for a night cap at the Headkeeper tonight after some R&R. I poured it into my crystal snifter and prepared for the best. The beer poured with a nice head that quickly dissipated. The color was a deep, deep ruby. The aroma was full of roasted malts and sweet, dark fruits. It has tones of dates, sweet citrus notes. The taste wasn't as well received as the aroma. It was a bit bland, but still passes as scotch ale. A few years ago I tried Red Ryder form Erie Brewing and enjoyed it very much. I hope sooner or later they bring it back."
"This is an average brew."
"I honestly don't know what to say about this beer. It wasn't a bad beer, but it wasn't all that good either. If you like affordable high ABV% Ales that are strong on the alcohol and yeast, then you might like this one. One was enough for me."
"Very good job Erie Brewing!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a snifter. This beer poured a dark burgandy/brown hue with a thin head of tannish yellow foam that quickly settled into a mostly lasting layer. The aroma of the beer was made up of brown sugar, sweet caramel, and some dark fruits. The flavor included caramelized sugars, plums, light smoke, and some warming alcohol. The mouthfeel was full-bodied but seemed a bit thin for a big beer. The carbonation was moderately aggressive. A pretty decent Scotch ale, and highly drinkable despite the high ABV."
"Notes: I originally bought this because the beer guy at Holiday Market recommended it. I don't think I'm gonna pay much attention to his further recommendations."
"Not bad at all. This isn't the best of the style but it is certainly far from bad. Good flavor and mouthfeel help this overcome the looks and smell to make this a better than average Wee Heavy. A beer that is certainly worth drinking at the brewery and worth trading for."
"The alcohol is way too present. It was cheap, I'll leave it at that."
"Poured a bright ruby red/orange with no head and a small amount of lacing that stuck around till the very end. Smelled of sweet malts and fruit. Very bready and fruity taste that quickly fades into an alcohol burn that would warm an eskimo in a speedo. Had a very silky mouthfeel that makes it a little smooth. The alcohol burn wasn't extreme but it took away from the flavor. Not bad but one a night is enough."
"Drinkability: Very low I think. This beer is just okay. The alcohol is way too dominating to enjoy it, let alone multiples of it. But I guess someone thought this beer was worth releasing. Try it once, don't buy more than one. I'm already drunk."
"poured into my snifter. no head on this one at all. it goes strictly to business. bright ruby color. smells of sweets. caramel maybe, and fruits. good taste to it, sweet caramel and malt flavor to it, then you feel the burn when it goes down the hatch... definitely warms you up. not sure how many i could drink of these. not really enjoying the burn, but nevertheless a good winter warmer"
"I'm not even sure if age will do this beer any good. Its far from being horrible but it is a chore to sip, it has headache written all over it. A bit too attenuated, hot and fruity for the style."
"A decent wee heavy that has the kick and flavor for the style IMO."
"Erie came through big on this beer. Great for a winter warmer."
"D- A dangerously drinkable beer. At 10.10% this beer will sneak up on you!"
"Overall a decent beer that I will not have again."
"Very, very nice deeply bronzed color. Not much in the aroma department-some malt and caramel but really hard to find. Thick and heavy malt flavor-dried fruits, figs and raisens. Some caramel flavor. Maybe just a bit too bitter.Too much alcohol mars the overall impression. No smoke for a change which is nice in a wee heavy-smoke is way overdone for this style. Decent and full, treacle like mouthfeel. A good beer but the alcohol mars it for me. Might age quite well."
"After being out in the insanely windy and blustery weather of wny today I was looking forward to having a big warming malty brew this let me a little dissaponited.Poured into a standard pint glass a rich deep amber with a touch of tawny hue a nice tight formed one finger slight off white head atop,lighter aromas than expected for such a big beer some molasses and rown sugar with a touch ogf gummy fruitiness.I was really suprised at how basic the flavors were note very much malt complexity,starting out uneventful with a little dryer woodiness finishing with some molasses and brown sugar sweetness just as simple as that.As the beer warmed the alcohol showed itself more but didnt really lend anything to the beer except for maybe bringing the drinkability factor down a little.Eh not terrible just basic in my mind."
"The alcohol is not hidden well in this beer. In fact most of the flavors are drowned out by the ABV%."
"Pours a nice dark copper color, but with just a bit of head and almost no lacing. Sweet, malty scent, but not as strong or deep as most wee heavies. It has slightly sweet flavor, but it's completely overridden by the alcohol. There are other wee heavies out there that are just a little lower in ABV, but much richer in taste. It would be good as a warmer, but so would a nice scotch, and I prefer more flavorful beers, as opposed to those whose taste, and also rough feel, are too overwhelmed."
"To me, the the flavors are more of a strong ale or a winter warmer."
"Overall, a solid brew, and one that I really enjoyed. Will look for this every fall/winter."
"My first Erie beer. I'd like to try their other offerings."
"Pours a redish brown with a thin tan head. Not much retention, byt decent lacing. Aromas is of sweet dark fruit, and butterscotch,with a hint of alchol.Body is medium,with som carnionation. Taste is of scotch wiskey,and sweet dark fruits. Excellent from start to finish!"
"Nice Wee Heavy that is certainly heavy. Pour a nice vibrant red brown with a dark tan head. Nice malt aroma with notes of fig, plum and a bit of an alcohol sting. Hides alcohol well and is drinkable for a wee heavy. Will be a nice beer to cellar and let age and revisit in a year!"
