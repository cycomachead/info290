"A perfectly dialed in wee heavy with only flaw beig a little light in body."
""
""
"Flavors and aromas of toffee, chocolate malt, raisin, toast, sherry and light oak.  The aroma is on the mild side, but it's pleasant and enticing.  The flavor is nicely balanced with a touch of sweetness.  There are many beers within the style that have bigger flavors.  Bigger isn't always better.  This is refined and very pleasant to drink.  I wish I had another..."
""
""
"Stunning beer.  Deep, dark reddish color with a large head.  That's about where the good stuff ended.  I expected a stronger aroma, especially from the oak, but I got very little.  Didn't get much flavor-wise either.  I found it to be more of a very easy drinking ale with not much to it.  Not bad, but nothing noteworthy."
"O: Easy to drink with lighter mouthfeel and well hidden alcohol. Very enjoyable and a nice example of the style. Overall, well balanced."
""
""
"O: Good."
""
""
""
"Smells delicious, but the taste doesn't quite fill the promise. I love scotch ales but prefer them with a little more weight, and sometimes a little smoke. This one is on the light side with a hint of sweetness. Drinkable and goes down smooth, but if I want a scotch ale, I'll reach for a Skull Splitter"

"Overall - This import is both special and underrated."

"Overall it is a very good beer, but not great."
"Nice, just different from past memory."

"Overall: Definitely a keeper - Scottish beer has come a long way from the bad old days of Tennents Extra and Special Brew. I could easily imagine partaking of a few of these whilst enjoying a plate of haggis and neeps. Again, the hop-heads will probably hate this but for me there's a spot-on balance of malt and hops to complement the various  other flavours that are present."
""
""
""
""
"O: it's pretty pleasant it's very smooth with a soft light taste that isn't overwhelming I wouldn't go out of my way for it but I'd grab it if I ever saw it again."
""
""
""
"Overall, just a bit too dark and bitter for my preferences in a Scotch Ale.  If only the taste could feature more of the nose of caramel and toffee."
""
""
""
""
"I am seriously wondering about the age.  As a wee heavy, I would think it might not matter as much, but I can't see this being rated so highly.  The beer is decent, and not being an English bitter beer fan, I am trying to adjust for that.  However, the feel really kills this beer for me from being rated highly, even for me."

"Overall, a very good scotch ale and more fruity than many of the other ones I have had. Great interplay between the wood, smoke, and fruit and well balanced. A great beer."

"BBD June 18.  Dark amber pour with a deep dark ruby cast.  Exceptional head, lacing and retention.  Rich nose of dark fruit and malt  - figs, raisins and plums against a rich malt sweetness.  The body is heavy medium with a nice slick, almost creamy, texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is complex and well balanced.  While not as intense as Jacobite, it follows the nose as well.  The dark fruits flow into a light hop bitterness over a slightly sweet dark malt background.  The smooth finish leaves a bit of lingering oak."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - overall a great example of the style, looks amazing and the complex smooth malt flavor is accentuated well with ample hop bitterness. Very drinkable, but still complex and enjoyable."

"A very good ale, refreshing with grassy and licorice notes. Mouthfeel is probably the best I have had in an ale and with a lack of any real hoppy flavor, it leaves a clean, earthy taste in the mouth. 7.2 abv is well hidden and makes this beer almost worth the price."
""
""
""
"Probably the best wee heavy I have ever tried. No U.S. example (even those from Founders and Stone and the like) can match it, in my opinion. Where I live it is pricey, so I only get it once or twice a year. A great beer for the holidays."

"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 6/2018. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, molasses, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, oak, light vanilla, light clove, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes with moderate oak presence;and good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, toffee, oak, light clove, light vanilla, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering flavors of raisin, plum, pear, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, molasses, toffee, oak, light clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast flavors with light-moderate oak presence; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome scotch ale! All around great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors with light-moderate oak presence; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"Overall- Halfway between good and really good. Very accessible for a Scotch ale so much so that it sometimes does not seem like one. While somewhat lacking in complexity and presence, it's still quite an interesting beer. I wouldn't buy it again but I would put down the 8 bucks to give it a shot. It is subdued enough while maintaining a good amount of character that it might just become one of your favorites."

"46/50"
"o: A tasty brew, although at first surprisingly and lingeringly bitter, moreso than I expected from a top-rated ale of this type."
""
"O - World class beer that should age well or drink great fresh. Like great food it is not overly complex with to many competing flavors but the couple of flavors that are present are just right and that is what makes it the great beer it is."

"fellow BA claystation left this one in my fridge, and darn it all, I need a beer, so here goes. ill make it up to him. lovely pour, rich caramel color, deep dark, almost brown, with a dim red orange glow when held to the light. a quick flashing inch plus of just off white head that settles back to patchy spots, but leaves great lace. it smells dusty, timeless, ancient in some way, preindustrial, gorgeous. heavy earthen grain and a bready yeast strain that gives this a very genuine vibe, warming. there is that classic scotch ale sweetness to the taste, but it gives way to bolder roasty flavors, toffee and buttery richness, and a soil quality. its low key for its robustness, and the ale yeast on top really makes it sing. traditional and delicious, exemplar of the style. not sure ive had a wee heavy I like more. drinkably full bodied, warming booze that can be felt and not tasted. perfect for late fall. I have nothing but good things to say about this, and am now curious to try more of their beers. how cool would it be to visit this place? great beer."
""

""

"O) You read aged in oak barrels, but need to keep in mind you are not drinking a barrel aged beer from an American brewery. The intent is different here, and the execution is nearly flawless. This is a top notch Wee Heavy. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- awesome, definitely of the older Scotch ale variety that's not as up front as the U.S. style and most certainly better because it isn't."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is silky smooth, offers a wide variety of sensations on the tongue, from the spiciness, to a slight bitterness from the hops. It's a fun beer to drink and is really quite good. I'd get more of this in a heartbeat."
""
""
"O - Just the slightest ding in my rating that has nothing to do with the beer itself - the price. At nearly $8, this isn't something I can buy often enough. But as far as the beer, if you enjoy a good Wee Heavy, this is a wonderfully delicious example."
""
""
""
"Very good beer, but I think it's a bit overrated. Traquair Jacobite, with fuller body and more intense flavours and aromas, is slightly better than this one."
""
""
""
""

"That is too bad… I wanted this to be good."

"This is a highly recommended beer for those who want a fantastic sipping beer with loads of flavor, but without the over-powering inebriates."
""
""
""
"3.75 D: Overall it's a pretty damn good brew. I didn't pick up any astringency in the Jacobite, so maybe this is just how this batch turned out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed the beer, it's a good representation of the style, and a style I quite like. I wish the aroma was a bit more powerful, and the carbonation could be a bit lower with some some more thickness in the mouth, but I'd definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark red. Thin tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Strong, sweet aroma of malt and dried fruit. Flavor is raisins, dried cherries, toast and just a hint of vanilla. A little more alcohol burn than usual for the style. Medium body. Slightly slick, oily finish and very mild carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a comfortable beer with enough character to be interesting but not so much as to be distracting from other pursuits while consuming. Warmth is a good friend to this beer, which was aged four years in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just overall an excellent, excellent beer. Would grab this again in a second. Great representation of a nice, drinkable, malty beer that goes down well at almost time."
""
"D - Very drinkable. So mellow yet with a good deal of complexities. Definitely let this beer warm up some before diving in. Somewhat pricey but well worth the try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting beer. Lots of typical scotch ale flavors. Nice transition from being sweet and malty up front, to being dry and and tannic and even a little bitter in the finish. Regardless, surprisingly complex and balanced brew. Having said that, I much preferred Jacobite."
""
"O: Personally, I'm more inclined to prefer a less bone-dry Scotch ale (like Old Chub). I'm also a bit let down in its lack of depth; but on the flipside, the drinkability this presents is impressive. All things considered, a bit too expensive ($8/16.9 oz) given that it seemingly focuses on drinkability over complexity. That doesn't mean it isn't very good, however."
""
""
""
"Dense malt profile, smokey, charred, bittersweet flavors meld with an almost perfect mouthfeel. Good drinker for a February evening."
"C+"
"Pours a clear honey brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down either. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."
""
""
"Overall a rock-solid beer. There's nothing flashy or showy about it, but the more time you spend with it the more you realize that it has an understated elegance. I think the key that holds everything together is the water."
"An enjoyable ale with better than normal complexity and depth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good wee heavy. This one is not nearly as over powering as most."
""
""
""
""
""
"I truly enjoyed every drop of this elixir. I don’t remember having an Ale that was aged in oak barrels, and if you’re wondering if it makes a difference, it does. The trailing oak flavor was a perfect compliment for a cool evening in a warm bar, and I look forward to an opportunity to try it again in the near future. I strongly recommend giving this a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is quite wonderful. Pricey but mostly worth it due to the high drinkability. Traquair continues to be solid in my book."
"T: Opens with a modest dark fruit flavor and a touch of booze. Toasted oak, a faint peatiness, raisin and some faint burnt brown sugar. Finish leaves just a trace of warmth with a touch of oak. Alongside Dieu du Ciel's Equinoxe du Printemps, one of the best scotch ales I've had."
""
""
""
""
"Finally and what I've yet to mention is what makes this beer remarkable. Like I've already hinted at, this beer isn't the best at any particular aspect even within it's own style. This beer does however, carry alot of 'soul'. It might seem like over-romantization, but it's something that i really struggle to put into words. It just feels like it was made with the purpose of capturing a specific frame of existence, and that it somehow perfectly captures it. I personally find it hard not to wonder off to a roadside tavern in the Scottish coastland. It really IS an experience like one of the bros pointed out."
""
""
"O: Excellent, balances the dark and sweet tones in a very grown up manner."
""
"Drink this beer to John Cage's Finnegan's Wake as i write this on what is John's 100 birthday? Wow. Sleep well my dear departed sweet man."
""
"This is an outstanding Scotch Ale. Dark amber, head fades fast. Smells of malt, peat, toffee and scotch. Lightly bitter with a slightly sweet aftertaste. Very smooth. One of the better Scotch Ales out there. I hesitated at spending $7.25 for a bottle of it, but it was worth every penny. I'm buying this one again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a cloudy dark mahogany amber. Thin, meduim tan head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of caramel, dark dried fruit, light vanilla; earthy. Flavor follows with well integrated caramel malt, toffee, dark dried fruit, light vanilla and a hint of smoke and mustiness. An unexpectedly dry finish and somewhat more subdued flavor than I expected, but nicely balanced and pleasant. Medium bodied, but has a light creaminess that gives an excellent mout feel. A very nice scotch ale from a great traditional brewer."
""
""
"Not many good Scotch Ales available here, but this one of them. Pours mahogany with a thin, loose ecru head. Rich caramel and toffee, subtle mustiness like mossy decomposing wood, nice spicy oak note, vanilla and toasted nuts. Balanced bitterness, with an earthy hop flavor, slightly metallic mineral note on the finish. This is a relatively young bottle and is already super mellow. I like the new 500ml format as opposed to the old 330ml bottles."
""
""
"Overall: A very good wee heavy. As above, a bit too much alcohol flavor-- burns like a 9 or 10% beer. Nice complexity of aroma and flavor."
"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed on agt´12. Dark brown in color. Light beige head shows not much retention. Yeast, floral & herbal fragrances, caramel & toasted malt aromas & hints of anise to the nose. Gentle warming alcohol at firs sip rounded by toasted flavor. Medium body. Moderate to high carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Dark fruits in the middle, slightly chocolate touch & subtle anise notes. Dry malty finish. Sweet & alcoholic aftertaste."
""
"Overall an excellent beer; a rich nightcap with a warming alcohol affect."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great drinkability. Complex. Great Scottish Ale"
"poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. beautiful dark ruby, garnet with little lacing, but toffee smell. one of my all time favorites and after the chimay blue and duvel, it brings an awesome balance to my tatsebuds. the website says it's a 'winter ale' but it tastes great in the summer warm. a good scotch on the side almost sounds very complimentary... i'm a happy man tonight!!!"
""
""
"Deeper, smoother, more complex and drier than Jacobite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma of this beer is intriguing, as it suggests a blend of many flavours at work. An interesting, somewhat complex taste. Noticed the hint of raisin that others mentioned in the flavour. A pleasant surprise that goes down quite nicely. A good, smooth scotch ale (and no overt alcohol taste which is appreciated)."
"Overall ok - however must also admit - not my given preferred style. Have tried to review objectively but find difficult."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very clean, robust tasting dark ale. Well-balanced with excellent depth, complexity, and richness to satisfy a wide-range of dark ale aficionados. Highly recommended."
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish in color with a tan like head. In the aroma, roasty, notes of chocolate and a small earth and alcohol. In the taste, a small roast, earthy, and a small alcohol bite. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry earth and alcohol in the aftertaste. This was the beer that changed my life and I cannot believe it took me this long to review it!"
""
"Overall: a tasty enough Scotch ale. It doesn't blow my socks off, especially with its mild aroma, but it is a perfectly serviceable Wee Heavy."
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is smooth and easy drinking for over 7%. I am glad I finally got around to trying this and I would probably reach for it again if given the chance. Overall, not a bad brew it is worth giving a try."
"D - A dark, complex, and flavorful beer. I'm not familiar with scotch ales a great deal, but as far as I'm concerned this is an exceptional beer no matter how you slice it. Definitely one to try again if I can find it, as this was delicious."
"Great, great stuff."
""
""
"I no longer drink but far and away the best I ever had was the Traquair house ale. I've tried just about every thing available until 3 years ago. This was FAR and away the best ale I ever had. Second place was McEwan's Scotch Ale. Most beers are like a entree - this is a dessert. An expensive and well worth is dessert."
"A dark sweet beer, not sure I'd call it an ale. Not a huge head but nicely laced. Great mouthfeel. Not very bitter, not hoppy. At over $5 for a bottle, I 'd say you're paying a premium for uneconomical home brewing (oldest house in Scotland...) and travel across the pond. I think this is a good beer, but a little too sweet for my taste and way overpriced."
""
"The reveal: Traquair House Ale. Nice, good stuff. Also this is a 1001 book beer, thanks!"
"A decent beer, though the taste was a bit subdued and the mouthfeel was a bit thin for my liking."
"Very pleasant to drink, everything is well balanced and not too much."
""
""
""
"I'd had this on my list for years, as I'd always heard & read that it was a really good example of a style I really liked. Don't know if there was something wrong with this particular bottle, but I thought it really fell pretty flat. Nothing bad about it, but not much very memorable, either. I'd be up for trying it again, but I can't really say I'm impressed by this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy. Perhaps it could be a bit sweeter, but I would only enjoy that if there was still a bitterness that balanced it out towards the finish. Regardless, this beer is still good."
""
"A very good scotch ale. The ale is not as malty as other scotch ales and easily drinkable . Personally, I'd like the feeling to be a little more thick and texture."
""
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Everything has its place. Nothing overpowering and a smooth overall feel. Rich and complex without overwhelming the palate."
""
"Overall: A well done brew, which has come from the ancient brewhouse in the oldest inhabited house in Scotland to my glass. Proof that history can be tasty."
""
"The fruity flavor leaves quickly and yields a full flavored beer that has multiple layers of flavor. The hops break up the malty sweetness nicely. At first sip I wasn't a fan. At last sip I'd like another, which I find to be a great quality in beer. It shows it's depth. Great stuff despite the high price tag"
"Overall - A solid scotch ale. No frills. Traditionally made and traditional tasting. Well made on all counts."
"Full flavored with sweet milked cocoa malt flavor. There's a dollop of bittering hop in the swallow, but this is a tale of delicious, near cake-like chocolate malt taste. Rich bodied with a low carbonation level."
""
""
"O-very smooth compared to most Scotch Ales, wishing it had more aroma though. The alcohol did not overpower the beer.if I was searching for a good Scotch Ale I would seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: decent but not exceptional and definitely not worth the price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the best scotch ales available. The complex flavors of the different malts and the herbal hops make this a fun beer to drink. I'd prefer a little more malty thickness in the body and a very small amount more smoke but for the style this is very very good."
"Overall an impressive display of light and bold from taste to feel. Very impressive, and an interesting unique Scotch Ale. I am drinking this by a fire with snow outside and I can't think of a better time to do so."
""
"Big toffee & tobacco like qualities on the palate. Backbone is a ton of sweet malts & backend of a touch of booze heat. I think the body could be a bit more beefy, but that just might be my americanized palate that needs everything to be over the top. Other than the body being a bit thin for my taste, its a solid Wee Heavy. If only the price were a bit lower, (or my income a bit higher) I would go back for more & more & more & more."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/1001beers"
""
"O: My god this is delicious... Everything a Scotch ale should be. Rich and fantastically smooth, this is a perfect winter beer. My only complaints are that the carbonation seemed to disappear a little too quickly, as did some of the flavor. Otherwise, I'd say seek this one out ASAP."
""
""
""
"Sipping on this one after an evening dip in the spa. To start with, it looks like absolute perfection in the glass; tiny bubbles streaming up the vessel, meeting the beautifully compact, beige cream head. Nose is a bouquet of dark fruit and bittersweet caramel. Taste is more of the same, with a little sweet booze. Goes down very smoothly. A great evening sipper."
"O-A classic scotch ale."
"O: Recent American malt-bomb Scotch ales could learn a thing or two or three from this amazing Old World original."
"Pours very dark copper, light stone head which quickly dissipates to a ring which persists for the glass; not much lacing. Aroma is restrained sweetish caramel malt and a touch of dark fruit as the beer warms up. Taste is caramel over roasted malt, very dry, some chocolate and dark fruit characteristics as it warms. Medium carbonation and medium light bodied, this is less rich than others of the style. Overall, a good light scotch ale, pretty drinkable."
"O: The beer goes down rather easy for the style because it is well balanced, relatively light in body and has its alcohol well hidden from the taste."
"A great smelling beer. A bit too sweet for me."
"Overall: very nice, good for after a nice meal. Maybe a bit pricey for the size."
"In total, American palates might feel this beer is lacking punch. I've had beers all over Scotland, and the subtlety of these beers is not to be missed. Really, once you've had a good Caledonian 80- on cask, you can begin to really appreciate what European brewers are trying to do. Very rich, very malty....gorgeous experience."
"Overall, very impressive."
"A very drinkable wee heavy, though quite smooth, it is a more refined, less ""in-your-face"" take on the scotch ale. As it from Scotland, perhaps I should instead look at this as more representative as compared to its more aggressive American cousins. Still, a nice ale that you should make sure to have if given the occasion."
"jd"
"Mouthfeel: Sticks to the palate with that alcohol spiceness."
"It has a nice red/ brown look with a decent white head that doesn't linger too long. The smell is that is raisins,sugars, the usual strong Belgian scents. The taste is excellent. It is very smooth and has a great finish. This one really surprised me and I'm glad I picked it up. The abv is above 7 so it's not something to guzzle but more to enjoy after a nice dinner. If you can get 2."
"Overall: Was excited for this beer because my buddy hyped it up big time. However I was pretty let down by the lack of flavor which killed this beer for me"
"O- Nowhere near as good as Jacobite, but stands tall on it's own. I wish it was a bit stickier on the tongue. I'm not sure at $5.49 a bottle it's worth it, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Overall: This is an exceptional ale. Another great offering from Scotland, which in my opinion, has great beers for such a small country. This is a smooth but complex ale to be sipped and savored any time of year. Cheers!!"
"This beer pours a thick dark chocolate color with a trace of off white head that laces well but doesn't retain. The atoms has notes of raisins and citrus, with a caramel malty sweet sweetness. The taste starts with raisin and plums and the switches to caramel malt. The mouthfeel is nice and velvety an finishes clean. Overall a great beer."
"This beer poured out as a deep looking brown color. Not much light gets through this one. The head was pretty good, left a decent amount of retention. The smell was earthy, had some sweet malts and a touch of smokiness to it. The taste of the beer had a good sweetness also, with a dry malty aftertaste. There might even be a touch of dark fruit in there too. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a good thickness to it as well. Overall, I found this Wee Heavy to be rather enjoyable."
"O - Excellent beer to sit and sip and enjoy on its own or with a meal. Probably not one for a session drink, but certainly top notch."
"O- A very nice beer. The smell was a little off on this bottle but that could be an exception and it actually plays nicely against the flavor. This is the 2nd type of beer I've had from Traquair and I can't wait to find more. $4.89 for a 12oz at Steve's Liquor in Madison"
"Overall, this was pretty good. As close to a sessionable Scotch Ale as I have ever tried. Maybe not quite as complex as, for example, the Jacobite, but still quite good."
"The flavours followed the smells, chocolate and coffee, with the coffee being the dominant one this time. The alcohol content is just below the surface, but can just about he found as the mouth dries after each sip. Not as sweet as I thought it might be, or expected after the first sniff. This ia a well balanced brew for a Wee Heavy."
"Very easy to drink with almost no perceptible alcohol. This is a top notch beer."
"Overall / Drinkability: A slow sipper this one. While I think it would go well with a meal, I almost think this beer is best alone for an after-dinner treat. It needs to warm up a bit for all the flavors to come out, but that adds to the experience of slowly enjoying this beer."
"one of those beers i just sat down with by myself in my living room and just drank it slowly doing nothing else and thoroughly enjoyed the little trip we took. my mouth was wet and loving it."
"O- This is a very solid enjoyable brew. It's delicately complex and balanced, not a single dominant flavor will overpower you."
"I don't even want to write the rest of this review. This beer is thin, slightly sour. I've never heard of this beer being infected, but I hope it is."
"O: Overall pretty nice. A bit simple to me, but I liked what it had to offer."
"Overall pretty good, the herbal hops are always a negative for me, but it was used in moderation here and tolerable, and some nice malts, overall a pretty good beer."
"O- Classic Scotch Ale, always worth picking up if you dont mind the price tag."
"Overall: This doesn't seem very complicated but it does have nice, solid, easy to enjoy flavors. It is a good and interesting beer."
"Overall: This is a very tasty beer, one of the best beers from Scotland I've had. It's a bit on the expensive side for regular drinking, but it is certainly one to be enjoyed occasionally. It's a great warming beer for a chilly night."
"overall - good beverage, for the price not sure if I will revisit, but an overall solid beverage"
"This is a brew for the ages. A masterpiece not to be taken for granted. Bathe in it's glory and craftsmanship and you will know there is greatness in man."
"Poured into snifter a deep amber with only a faint head that made a very brief appearance. Smell reminds me of an Old Ale and Kvass. For me the first taste was almost like biting into an almost ripe apple followed by it's own bite and then a little bitterness and a little bready and then back to the apple again as a lingering finish on my palate. Has an average mouthfeel for me but suprised me a little because there is a little tingle that I would usually attribute to a fair amount of carbonation but this lacked in head enough to trick me. I really enjoy this and as far as it's classified style goes I would grab this over other Scotch Ales and Wee Heavies that I have had."
"Unique and distinctive, and a tasty beverage worthy of purchase, even at it's $5-6 retail per bottle."
"O: Easy to drink but lacks a distinctive compelling character. Don't know that I'll return to this one however."
"Comes in an elegantly designed bottle. Pours an oaky brown color with a one and a half finger head. Decent retention and lacing. Nutty aroma, with a strong essence of caramel malt. Very strong malt in the taste, with some roast and faint coffee. Roasted nuts in the taste as well, very smokey overall. Highly carbonated and full bodied, drinkability is great as well. A very unique beer, and one of the best I have had in a while."
"Drinkability: One to drink slowly and savor with a good book."
"This is an excellent brew Very enjoyable."
"D - A good beer with some appreciable flavours. An excellent taste!!"
"drinkability; very tasty but the alcohol is no joke, quite warm but not overly hidden. The aftertaste is a little rough around the edges. This is a drinkable beer but I would sip it, snuggled by a fire."
"D - Drinkability was great. A little too good considering the price and the fact that I wanted to down it too quickly."
"I will be going back to my store tomorrow and buying them out of this. Amazing."
"This is the second Scotch Ale I've had from Traquair, and for me, this one slightly edges out the other, being their Jacobite Ale. The unique peat character is beautifully rendered and comes out wonderfully in the finish, and makes for a great addition to all of the staple sweet and sticky Wee Heavy characteristics this beer already possesses. The next time I see this, I'll be sure to pick a bottle or two up."
"A very good house ale. Thanks again Graig! Send me more of this house..."
"The palate opens with a blend of a moderate peaty smoky flavor with some fruit. Again, I get figs with some red delicious apple. Quite dry, there's flavors of toffee, burnt sugar and a little caramel. Drying on the finish with a blend of peat and burnt sugar, the flavors that linger are excellent. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer feels good on the palate. I really like the flavors on the finish here, flavors are wonderfully balanced. Alcohol is hardly apparent. An enjoyable beer that I will seek out again."
"I only feel that the body of the beer needs to be amped up a bit, but an exceptional beer otherwise."
"O: I like this a lot. Great balance of caramel. Sometimes can be too sweet, so drink sparingly."
"A good balance, well-done and a really nice sipping brew."
"Pours a coppery brown with a slight off white head. Smells of yeast, bread, and caramel malt. The flavor is mostly of sweet caramel malts, with an earthy, almost funky finish. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh at the end from the alcohol, but this is still a fairly drinkable beer."
"I was blown away by this beer. The body is amazing."
"D: Overall, I think I prefer the Jacobite Ale to the House Ale, though this may be a better-brewed beer. It's a solid effort and definitely tasty. I will probably pick up another couple, if only for sharing. Recommended."
"Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a deep red-brown with a one and a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, sweet malt, cookies, and dark fruit. The flavor was of very slight roasted malt, sour malt, subtle spices, extremely subtle alcohol, and dark fruit. It had a light feel on the palatae with low carbonation. Overall this was quite the awesome brew. The flavor on this one was very nice and well balanced. Also the aroma was very good as well. I'm really glad I got the chance to try this one. I must say, this is a must try for anyone who hasn't gotten the opportunity before."
"Overall, this was a lighter beer than I expected it would be. The flavors blended nicely and made for quite a relaxing brew. As excellent as this beer was, this was a little bit too drinkable, aka I wish it lasted me longer than it did. Excellent beer, would recommend this one."
"i must say that this does not suffer much with the lower abv but it does in turn not have as much to a body. the look and smell is about the same but the nose is but more muted. just as coriander and toffee caramel but subsides... palate is leaner but also seemed more susceptible. this has a tad of a metallic quality and may not age was well as the other. still a substancial amount of flavor for the sake of how nice and lean the body is. not as creamy and refreshing as the jacobite but more so just refreshing."
"A nice, full flavoured but easy to drink ale. Very good."
"D - Easiest Scotch Ale to drink ever. Enough said."
"Conclusion: I expected greatness and was not disappointed. This is a great Scottish beer. I backpacked 95 miles in the highlands of Scotland when I was 16 and drank my first beer on that trip. Become of that experience my love for beer is connected with my love for Scotland, and this ale brings the two together in a lovely way. Drink this if you haven't yet."
"D - This is quite possibly the best Scotch Ale that I've had so far its excellent taste makes this one very easy to drink worth hunting down to give a try sometime"
"Outstanding! A must try ale from a small Scottich brewery."
"Overall a very enjoyable Scotch Ale. Recommended."
"This beer is so so smooth and so silky, this beer is a wonder on the palate. The alcohol is warming and lovely. This one is meant to be sipped, savored and enjoyed thoroughly. One will do and each sip is better then the next. Well worth the expenditure and should be searched out. Top 5 Scottish style ales I have ever had hands down."
"D-Very nice for the wee heavy style. Wish it were more affordable. I like SkullSplitter better since it is much better priced."
"Restrained yet rich, deep brown and earthy with hints of caramel and wood all combine to make a seemless beer worthy of contemplation. Nothing else survives today which so denonstrates Sandy Hunter's capacity, vision and genius."
"D: Very good. At $6 a bottle (small bottle) I won't be buying this regularly, but it was definitely worth trying."
"a unique scotchie brown ale"
"D- so very glad i found this ale and worth way more than the $4.75usd i paid for it. i could have paid double that and still been happy. every aspect of this beer is so magnificent that i feel bad giving the look such a respectively low score over something as meager as retention and lace, but it is what it is. this here is perfection in a thistle glass. i could drink this brew in indefinite quantities and i could get a case from my distributor tomorrow and chug pints and not feel a penny's worth of shame for it. pencils down, test complete, the best scotch ale in the land of the world and the earth and all the universe because i'm certain that extraterrestrials don't wear kilts, let alone comprehend the art of brewing such a fine, fine ale. laddy."
"D: Decent brew, but not that amazing. Can't wait to try out the other one."
"At the Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell, NJ. Poured a reddish-mahogany hue, with a small off-white head, poor retention, and modest lacing. Smell very malty sweet, with some hints of dark fruit/raisin and toast. The taste confirmed a very sweet, malty, dark fruit-oriented flavor, with a modest toastiness and a sweet finish. Non-carbonated, full-bodied feel. The excessive sweetness combined with the syrup-like texture was a little overpowering for me."
"Had at The Publick House, Brookline, MA. Coca-cola hues with a thin head (the beer, not the pub) and surprisingly little aroma. I pulled hard and found some butterscotch, leather, malt and vanilla. Not much smoke in either the smell or the taste; I could have used a bit more, frankly. Ditto the malt: I knew it was in there, but for some reason it just seemed diminished. Letting it warm solved most of these problems; still, I would have liked a bit more smoke and malt. Warming also brought out plenty of molasses. Definitely a sipper, this lands near the top of my Scotch Ale list."
"Top 3 most drinkable beers I've experienced. Curse the fact it's around $6 a 11.2."
"For me this is he pinnacle scotch ale that is readily brewed. I have had some limited brews that I enjoyed more, but this is what you will find in my fridge on a regular visit. I still favor the Belgian ales over Scot, but would never turn this ale down."
"Beer is really creamy, very nice. Good caramel notes in the mid and late palate. Finishes completely cleanly. Beer has a medium body and some early sweet notes but its not a super malty beer. Bitterness is really low but that's expected. A really really good beer. I'm so glad I picked these up finally. I would highly recommend it and I'm trying it side by side with the Jacobite and am quite excited about that now."
"D - A good beer, but not my favorite Wee Heavy. The earthy flavors dominate the experience for me. I'd prefer a cleaner malt taste and maybe a bit of smoke, but this character is totally different."
"A liked this a lot better than I did."
"I found this to be a decent beer, but also a little underwhelming considering its ranked in the top 10 for its style. The flavours were pleasant, but I wouldn't mind a little more intensity to them to push this to the next level. However, I was impressed with the drinkability of this one, which was far higher than any other scotch ale I've come across, and the alcohol is skillfully hidden. Decent stuff, and worth the shot, even if its not mind-blowing."
"Overall this beer is pretty good, rich and fairly complex. The finish leaves something to be desired however, it's a bit thin and doesn't reflect the beer well. It is very drinkable and goes down quite smooth."
"D - I'll get through the bottle easily enough, but I won't be craving another... maybe another Jacobite! That blows this out of the water."
"classic, well-balanced and not over-the-top like many american attempts."
"Low carb, medium mouthfeel - I'd like it a touch higher. I have to hide this beer from myself to keep from drinking it."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a tan head. The aroma is alcohol, dark fruit and caramel malt. The flavor is caramel, peet smoke and dark fruit. The beer tastes a lot like a slightly smokey scotch whisky. Medium mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation."
"Bland mouthfeel. Not good."
"o - good. better than the jacobite, but again over priced."
"I enjoyed this, but I wasn't blown away. For $6, I could buy 4 or 5 Lake Louie Warped Speeds...the economist in me is unsatisfied with this purchase."
"M,D- One the fuller side of medium bodied, with a nice feel, this House Ale has a good level of drinkability."
"Overall: Love this beer, wished I could afford it more often. I sat and drank this, sipped this while sipping on Belvenie Scotch on the rocks, and watching NHL hockey playoffs. Doesn't get better than that."
"D: Scotch Ale is one of my favorite styles for a reason. I really liked this beer and would happily revisit it."
"330 ml bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark brown color with about a half inch off-white head that didn't stick around for too long. However, there's a lot of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is toffee, peat, butterscotch, vanilla and caramel. It tastes like dark fruit (plums), butterscotch, caramel, vanilla, bready malt, and some peat. Good malty aroma and taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and a bit rich and slick, and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's smooth and easy to drink. Overall I think this is a good brew, and it's a very good Scotch Ale. I'd buy this again for sure."
"D: Quite drinkable given the lack of alcohol presence in the taste, and the general smooth drinkability that comes from a thinner mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Smooth and medium in body, though stiff and formidable all the same. Drinks well. Not your every day go-to beer for diving into, but this may well be one of my all-time favorite beers, especially for its representation of one of my fondest styles. Lacking little, overdone in nothing, nearly perfect for style by sweetness, balance, malt, and depth."
"This beer is exceptionally drinkable. It has a light body that is full of flavor. It is a bit on the sweeter side, but not overly fruity. Traquair House Ale seems very well-balanced and is quite delicious."
"Notes (to self): Try more beer in the Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy style and re-evaluate the review."
"""From the oldest inhabited house in Scotland."" Sitting in my tasting glass, it's a beautiful dark brown color contrasted with a foamy cap, resting right on top. This gives off a distinctly doughy, almost cinnamon-bread aroma, subtle yet distinct, like a good bakery. The scotch ale taste is refined. It's very well balanced, with caramel, bready, and raisiny sweetness. Slight hints of roasted coffee as well. This would go well with a cinnamon roll or something sweet and crumbly. Goes down easy, with a slight hop kiss and leaves you wanting more. I was inspired to drink this one from Traquairlover's username. I now understand why he chose that. Can't wait to try the Jacobite sitting in my fridge!"
"D: High marks here. Even at 7.2%, this is one you could have a couple of if you happen to have a few on hand. Easy drinking and very tasty."
"Overall: This is a really good beer great flavor wonderful profile and very easy to drink. I really like this scotch ale."
"Drinkability: This is a quite drinkable beer, both on a sip by sip basis and in the feeling that I want more and have the intent to have more in the future."
"Bottle courtesy of Bobsy. Aroma is molasses, banana, whiskey and spices (cinnamon, cloves). Flavor is bready, brown sugar, a little too sweet for me. Palate is quite full for the style with soft carbonation. Not exceptionnal but I'm glad I tried it as I don't often have the opportunity to tatse this style."
"This was a very smooth and graceful Scotch Ale, maybe the best tasting example I've had. Could drink several more easily. Would recommend."
"Pours with moderate carbonation, producing a tan head that dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Its color is a very dark ruby or reddish-gold, and on the palate it is velvety smooth, very rich. You can taste a hint of the 7.2% ABV on the tongue, as well as the slightest suggestion of peat smoke. The finish is dry, enticing you to take another sip. Absolutely true to the style, one of the classic Strong Scotch ales in the world today."
"I had to pace myself in drinking this one to allow it to warm. I could have dusted this one quickly and reached for another."
"I'm mad at myself because I purchased this bottle about two months ago and judging by the other reviewers, I'm not experiencing the same nuances, no telling how long it sat on the shelf in the store before sitting for an additional two months in my beer cellar. Because it lacks complexity and shows signs of sourness, something tells me this would have been a different experience had it been a fresher bottle or on tap. I'm dissapointed. (Mainly in myself.) This deserves a second review with a fresh batch."
"D: The Stuarts have made a classic, James I would be proud, everything is here in balance. Just wish it wasn't so expensive, I can't believe this it the first time I've had this beer in 4 years."
"Nice beer a little sweet but nothing that takes away from its good characteristics. This beer is worth looking for try it if you ever get a chance"
"D- this beer lives up to the hype. goes down easy and smooth. I could drink a case of this in a week. I would def recommend this for the those who like micros."
"D- This could of been a world class brew if the taste was more pronounced, still an excellent beer that I'll be revisiting very shortly."
"Drinkablity: A classic brew, very satisfying. Rich and flavorful."
"Shockingly found this at a local liqour store 5 min. from my house. wonderful caramel flavor along with deft sweetness. can tell alcohol is present, but balances the before mentioned flavors excellently. On my way back to the store for a few more....delicious!!"
"I'd sip on this, as the full, sweet flavours dont really lend themselves well to drinking quickly at all. Still highly drinkable though."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: low carbonation and totally gulpable."
"D: I could drink this all day - just perfectly balanced, not too strong, yet it has a ton of flavor."
"It's kind of a let down, another user described it as a ""watery porter," that sums it up perfectly. there's nothing really wrong with it, its just very average. there is a very very gentle smokiness, leather, tobacco, all of which i wish were just a bit more pronounced. like there are some great flavors in there, just hidden behind the weak, watery flavor and mouthfeel. Maybe its the exorbitant price that makes me expect a big beer, if this was the regular $7 or $8 for a good craft six pack, i would think it was a better deal."
"Roasted chocolate malt flavor with some caramel sweetness and subtle hop bitterness. Estery dark fruit notes, mostly plum and berries with some chestnut/hazelnut notes and slight alcohol warmth. Kind of a barleywine brown ale hybrid."
"Notes - Hadn't heard of this one before buying it on a whim tonight, and read up on it afterwards. I didn't need to see the good reviews to figure this one out. Top shelf beer here."
"Drinkability is good for the style, a pitfall many other scotch ales have in my opinion is that they tend to be overly sugary/sweet. The roastyness hits at a nice time for balance and leaves me thinking about taking the next sip to bring some sweetness back. This is the best scotch ale I have had, and will be my benchmark for the style in the future."
"D - This has to be the most drinkable Scotch ale IMO, a beer that is smooth for its strength and calls for repeated tastes, would pair well with many desserts like creme brulee for example"
"Overall, this is a solid brew. The taste kind of lets you down after the wonderful scent of the thing, but it's a pretty mellow Scotch ale that's definitely worth a try."
"Nice rich body, good creamy carbonation."
"D - This is a thick, malty, somewhat unusual beer. The malt flavor works pretty well, but the aroma is kind of weak. A nice wee-heavy, but it doesn't quite manage to justify its $5/12oz bottle price tag."
"D: One is enough, this beer just doesn't do it for me at all. I figured on a little bit stronger, more robust beer, but it really dies in the mouth. The nose is good, but this just comes up a bit short in my book. Won't seek out again."
"-i need to try this beer again in case i got an old or bad bottle because it seems to be that way"
"An extremely pleasant ale with good caramelized malt sweetness and a full character. The beer pours a deep magenta-brown with spotty lacing. The aroma is very good. There are dark stone fruits spicy rum and sweet caramel notes. The flavor is similarly good, particularly for a style that I don't always love. It's a fruity, caramel-y beer with enough bitterness to keep things balanced."
"A really nice beer, very smooth and mellow flavors. I was hoping for more to be honest, a little lackluster in the flavor. All in all, a very good wee heavy."
"Best wee heavy I have tried to date."
"D - Superb scotch ale, the flavours work beautifully together, and make this a beer that I will certainly be having again...and again."
"D - A respectable Scotch Ale, but a slight let down given the my lofty expectations..."
"4.5 D: overall, this is an ultra-elegant beer with so much to offer - neither something you'd wish to savour every day, nor even for the second bottle on the same night - because it's so precious and rare, worth great patience until having next sip, and next bottle. Reviewing it ""within style", I give it such high score over here, to reflect the fact that though this is just my second bottle of Wee Heavy, I already love it so much. Highly recommended!"
"Very good. Probably the best Scotch Ale I've had."
"Very nicely drinkable, with the 7.2%ABV very nicely hidden. A very slight warming is the only indication of it's slightly elevated abv."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, I will be drinking it again. Excellent beer!"
"I can't believe I've just now got around to trying this. Now I want to get more for some aging (especially after reading spointon's review!). Highly recommend this beer if you lean towards the maltier side of things."
"D= Though this is a sipper, and it unabashedly shows its alcohol, it never felt like a ""big"" beer and was never hot in any way. I could easily drink quite a few of these on a long Sunday afternoon/evening by a fire or in a comfortable chair reading a book. I am glad I saved this bottle for so long and will now dedicate myself to laying many more bottles down."
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like dark and rich molasses, honey wheat, buttery toffee, and caramel, with a bit of creamy yeast. It tasted like earthy molasses, rich buttery toffee, nutty malts, and bready yeast, with a bit of chocolate covered cherry. It was somewhat thick with some smooth carbonation, and had a sweet aftertaste. Overall this was one of the best smelling beers ever, and it tasted great and had great body too. It hid the alcohol well also, so it was very easy to drink. What a great beer! Maybe my favorite Scotch ale (better than Skull Splitter), and I really like that style. Plus, this seems to have great potential for aging. I can only imagine how sweet and rich the malty flavors would become!"
"looking forward to jacobite."
"Notes: just a great wee heavy. one of my favorites. excellent faithfulnes to the style."
"D - Like it, but not a session."
"this beer is ok, but not as good as i thought it would be."
"D: A very tasty beer with rich aromas. Rather complex and well balanced. Has somewhat of a sophisticated expression."
"It does remind me of my brief travels through Scotland - it tastes like most of the ""dark"" ales you can find in that country, but much, much better. Great beer, no matter the place."
"Yum."
"I wouldn't call this one a chugger, but a damn drinkable beer. Rich, complex, and sippable -- not big sips, but many of them in quick succession. Very worthy."
"D= A little pricey to drink one after the other, but very very pleasant and smooth. I sipped it at first to make it last, and continued sipping it to savor the smells and the flavors."
"Overall (obviously) I rate this highly and I'm happy to have found it...having not paid much attention previously, it appears it won some awards last year and I can see why."
"Overall this is a very tasty beer that's true to the style. Definitely worth a shot."
"A reasonable substitute for Old Chub when I can't get it."
"D- easy to finish and left me wanting to reach for another. a little pricey to be drinking more than one of in a sitting. something ill check out again, but not for a while."
"D: I'm beginning to move away from scotch ales and wee heavies, and this one really isn't going to draw me back. If I were still into the style I'd acknowledge that it is mid-range, but the watery mouthfeel is one heck of a drawback."
"The web site describes this ale as sherry-like, which gets at the very mellow fruitiness and depth of this ale."
"Mouthfeel is malty, yet bitter with some ""scotch"" like delicacies along the tongue, leading to slick ending."
"M: relatively smooth, especially for the higher ABV. medium bodied. solid carbonation level. great palate."
"Medium to full body, little carbonation. Some lingering aftertaste of malt and alcohol."
"Pours a dark, cloudy amber color. 1/3 inch head of a off-white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet chocolate, and strong malts. Fits the style of a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy. Bitter mouth feel, that is still very smooth and slightly chewy. Average carbonation levels are present. Tastes of strong malt up front and then quickly the alcohol flavors dominate. A slight hop kick is noticeable in the finish. Overall, a very smooth beer with lots of strong malt characteristics. I'd feel very confident in recommending this brew."
"For no apparent reason I've overlooked this one for a while. Looks promising though, so here goes. A dark reddish-brown pour is completed with a nice two-finger, light tan head that disappears quickly. A smattering of lace is left behind. Aroma is complex, with plenty of cherries, figs, sweet malts, yeast, caramel and dark chocolates. A slight booziness wafts up in the middle of it all. More dark chocolates, subtle cherries, toasted malts and a faint bit of spice (perhaps nutmeg) all fill the palate. While not quite as bold as the smell, the taste is almost perfectly balanced. The mouth-feel is weighted more toward the medium than the heavy, and it goes down smooth and maybe even a little bit creamy. There's a pretty good pop of bubbles upon a good shake, which evinces good carbonation and keeps things from being too heavy on the way down. The alcohol content, while not huge by any means, helps keep the beer interesting, as its not overwhelming, but definitely noticeable. This is the best beer I've had from the UK. A quick bit of internet research reveals that this brew is an 18th century recipe which was discovered in the 1960's. We could only hope more of these lost gems could be rediscovered, as that would make for some very tasty brews from the Isles."
"Don't serve this too cold, it really limits the beer. A nice cellar temp will do just fine. A great cold winter beer that would be really versatile with food, I'm thinking breakfast."
"MF&D - easy to drink, but not enough carbonation for my taste, hardly any. but, still fitting for the style, I guess."
"A cloudy brown pour. Sweet malt, does smell a bit like malt vinegar. Tastes is not so much, but malt and sweet malt. Some raisin, woodiness. A bit thin throughout. I guess I was expecting a little bit more of an old ale, so I was a little dissappointed. Not bad, but for 6 bucks, I could have found something better."
"Pours a dark brown/slight reddish color. Little head, slight off-white, brown, diminishing. Aroma of dark fruit, plums, citrus, & sugar. Lightish aroma. Strong taste of dark fruit, some coffee, slightly flat tasting. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Watery porter kind of taste."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. Great at 45-55 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Future outlook: Excellent stuff. I'll have this again anytime."
"One deftly rendered wee heavy, to be sure, everything one might need to prepare/fortify you for your particular stramash tomorrow. After that, this will still do you well, at least until spring's first tentative promises of lager-fueled patios."
"D: great beer. I'll have again. It made for a nice Sunday night sipper"
"A surprisingly easy drinker at 7.2%, heat is incredibly well hidden, I mean you really can't tell its there, mouthfeel only makes you want to confirm this more, add this to a rich and complex flavor profile and you have the markings of an excellent brew. Though at 6.50 a pop I won't be making this a regular addition to the fridge."
"I was shocked to see this was advertised as an English Strong Ale, as it has all of the taste and appearance of a Scottish Ale... just like the site says. Brown pour with an off-white head. Nice aroma of caramel, smoke, and earthiness. More caramel and smoke in the taste, with some peat, toffee, and a lot of malt. Smooth taste and mouthfeel. Delicious."
"Drinkability: excellent beer. Will be having again."
"Drinkability: I have seen this particular beer sitting on many store shelves and just recently picked one up to try. Man, what was I thinking. Being a malt-head, this is exactly what I like, a relatively big beer with tremendously complex malt flavors. Very good."
"Notes: This completes the trio of Traquair beers that are available for purchase to me. I would love to try the other more available one (name escapes me) as it is apparently a completely different style but anyway I enjoyed all three of them. This one specifically is the most drinkable and it is appropriately named the House Ale. I recommend this one and any Traquair beer that you find. All of the Traquair beers, imo, demand your attention and are excellently crafted."
"D: This is the best wee heavy I've tried so far. It's a subtle, drinkable brew."
"D: Overall a decent brew, but somehow was expecting more."
"D - I wish I hadn't had this when I was already kind of full; I suspect I might have liked it even better than I already did. Still, I don't see how it can be anything other than a one-and-done."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights. Thick off white head from somewhat aggressive pour, dissipates quickly with splotchy lacing. Sour cherries and hints of malt in the nose. Alcohol taste is next to none, i believe this is due to colder fermentation temps and cold conditioning. The pleasant sour flavor hits the tongue and is washed over by a fig like maltiness. A mild sourness remains begging for another sip. I was not expecting this beer to be as dry and thin in the mouth. The lingering sourness along with the low alcohol perception and dryness make this incredibly drinkable. Top on my list of Scottish Ales."
"D: This is incredibly drinkable."
"Poured into a snifter. Dark brown but clearly not black. Transparent if held to bright light. Thin ecru head fades quickly, little lacing. Aroma is stewed dark fruit with a dark toastiness and sweet grapes. Flavor is raisiny with caramel maltiness and a touch of the smoke and peat that was conspicuously absent from the aroma. Medium body and a sticky finish. Nothing outstanding but a very solid and traditional beer. More of a standard-setter than a boundary-breaker."
"330 ml. bottle. Pours a dark brown with a decent head. The aroma is quite fruity, like grapes perhaps. The taste is a rich fruity flavor, some burnt malt, some smoke perhaps, and a little hop finish. A thin to medium body. A really nice and easygoing drink. No noticeable alcohol."
"D: Great. The alcohol is strong, but this is not a hot beer in any way, shape or form. Delicious!"
"M/D - Medium to full bodied. Excellent carbonation. Very easy drinking despite the high sweetness."
"d - this is an outstanding ale. I couldn't really find a scotch ale I liked, until now. The only problem is that it costs about $6 a bottle around here. Won't be having this one too often because of the price, but it will be a real treat every time I do."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Scotch ale (served 10°C-13°C)."
"D- This is a very nice scotch ale. It isn't as aggressive as many out there but rather, more balanced."
"A wonderful sipping beer, delicious across the entire temperature range, though a bit pricey in my opinion. Still, the price of quality cannot be understated."
"A beutiful deep russett with a nice thick tan head, shows ruby highlights when held to the light and head keeps working throughout. A fantastic nose starting with alcohol, but softening to a great earthy nose. Woody with hints of figs and caramel. The flavor is the same way; soft malty sweetness, rolling into hop bitterness with slight alcohol afterbite. It rolls softly across the tongue leaving one ready for more. This is the Stuff!"
"Poured into a tulip and produced a finger of foam for couple of minutes. Attractive dark brown liquid. Smells very pleasant - sweet, fig, grape, caramel, toffee, wood, and an overall earthy must. Gadzooks! The flavor is pretty complex and I must not be very familiar with this style because it is not what I am used to. It is very earthy, not much sweetness at all really. A very nice bittering hop evens out the biscuity malts. Finishes like licorice and some nice alcohol warmth. About average carbonation for the style. Pretty smooth and a little bit more than a medium body. Overall, it rocked my socks off."
"This was a great beer. Found mine at BevMo. The bottle is simple, and I was sold on it's tag line ""A handmade ale brewed in the ancient brew house, in the oldest inhabited house in Scotland"" (Product of Scotland) Give it a shot. I could easily keep one in the fridge for special occasions. I think this beer does well on it's own, or would make a nice compliment to BBQ, roasted veggies or red meat."
"Overall, a very good beer. It was a little sweeter than I would have liked it, could have gone for some more bite."
"The taste has similar qualities and is wonderful. It's zesty, lively, and complex, very full of flavour but all restrained and nothing overpowers the other qualities or the drinkability. It is on the dryish side despite a light port and fermented plum/raisin character, with toastiness, quitwe a bit of black pepper and licorice, some chocolate and a faint leafy and earthy quality. It has a dryish, toasty, lightly bitter, zesty finish."
"Very smooth and complex taste all the ingredents are blended very well,no standouts and very well balanced taste. Dark fruit,lots of earthyness with subtle maltiness has a nice touch of tartness with gentle hints of smoke.Complex tastes of malt and dark fruit and a slight tangyness with no taste of alcohol at 7.2 make this beer extremely quaffable. Has a nice creamyness making for a light mouthfeel. Could drink this beer all night if i could afford it the steep price tag over a $100 a case knock the drinkability down a half notch for me. Excellent brew, must try beer in my book."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin and watery. Very light carbonation. Highly drinkable, yet delicate and softly complex."
"Mouthfeel is moderate, while not too light, it has some heavier qualities, but nothing like a dark ale or stout. Again, interesting. Very drinkable for the alcohol, and a very enjoyable experience."
"Drinkability: I picked this up never hearing anything about it, and I'm glad I did. A great ale one that is nicely savored and can easily be pared with cheese or red meat, maybe even try smoked cheeses and meats."
"d: As good as I remember. A legendary beer that provides a defining example of what a Scotch Ale can and should be. Very complex, rich but delicate. A must try for beer geeks."
"Drinkability oh so good. Not a chugging beer but one to sip continuously through the night, glass after glass."
"Drinkability: A satisfying, malty brew that delivers both on taste and complexity, but still remains fairly easy to drink. Jacobite's up next!"
"Mahogany color with a tan head. The nose has sweet malts, candy and figs. The taste is simply delicious. A perfect balance of bready malts, fruits, candies and ligt hops. Full body suits beer perfectly. A beautifull beer that I could enjoy most anytime."
"Medium bodied with a slightly dry, bitter aftertaste. Love, love, love the malty, sweet, earthiness of this one. It may be my new favorite Scotch Ale."
"Super drinkable. I've had two beers from Traquair and both have been world class. If you see this do not hesitate to try it!"
"I was wondering if I was ever going to experience the wonder others have had with this brew, and it came towards the last minute. And what a treat it was. Give it some time to warm after pulling it from the fridge and you too will experience the goodness of what others have had."
" Summery in one word: Quality."
"Good complexity throughout the sip with a smoky, malty backbone, some mildly spicy hops, and a velvety smooth texture. Some extant alcohol, but I find it complimentary. Almost no carbonation at all. Very relaxed and mellow overall, a nice sipper."
"Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this one - it's very subdued. I'll take an Old Chub over this any day."
"I would definitely buy another bottle."
"Excellent Beer!"
"D - A nice beer. Not something I'd drink often but every now and then would be fine."
"D: Goes down easy, and is a joy to drink. Not too heavy, so one can knock back a few no problem."
"D - This is a nice ale. Good malt taste."
"Excellent drinkability is another shining feature among many in this, a truly outstanding beer."
"This will be a repeat buy for me."
"This beer makes no bones about it origins. I feel like I am tasting peat smoked malts in every sip. Even though this scotch ale may not be as extreme as some of its stateside cousins, it is very true to the style."
"Pours a very dark red with a short whitish head. laces nicely. Smells sweet and fruity and malty. Notes of truffles, figs, dates, strawberries, cherries and liquor. Very inviting...smells fantastic. Surprizingly unassertive flavor that doesn't live up to the smell. Subdued clean and peaty malt. reserved fruitiness. alcohol noticeable as a warming sensation on the finish. hints of blackcurrant, chocolate. thinner than i expected. Not the experience i though it would be, but reasonably tasty nonetheless."
"Drinkability is high, but this is one to sip an savor. It gets a bit thick though towards the end of the glass, and I'm not sure I'd enjoy a second glass as much."
"I love this beer. A fine example of a great style."
"Pours a deep chestnut brown color with a rather small head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of brown bread, a bit buttery and nutty; some light wine like smells as well. The taste is of bready malt, hints of raisins, slight buttery, finishes with a smooth & mellow nutty malt flavor. The feel is well bodied with fizzy carbonation, finishes silky smooth. A very well constructed brew. The feel and finish of this brew is excellent."
"Drinkability - Great beer!"
"Smooth and sweet, almost juicy save for the balancing bitter kick at the end. It appears a dark amber without head retention. Rich caramel aroma with a hint of peat and earth. The flavor is semi-dry caramel grains with a mild, herbal bit of hops at the end. This is a very subtle beer and it hides it's strength well. However, I'd like a little more flavor out of a 7%+ Scotch Ale. Worth a try for the great drinkability."
"The only weak point of the beer is that, despite good carbonation levels, it is quite thin for something of it's class. Still, the alcohol is completely masked and the flavor is top notch. I'd say Scotch ales don't get much easier to drink."
"Interesting and surprisingly drinkable for 7% ABV."
"Well after reading some of the other reviews of this brew I think I may have gotten a skunked bottle. At least I hope I did."
"D-Better than average as there are interesting flavors here but I wouldn't drink alot of these. Very subtle flavors and aroma. I'll try this again as my palate improves."
"Light-medium body that doesn't seem heavy at all for a Wee Heavy and the alcohol is masked extremely well. Very tasty and very drinkable for an ale drinker that likes a malty brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is good. It's smooth and very drinkable. At 7.2%, it's relatively modest and amplifies drinkability. Overall, this is a very good beer. Definitely recommended."
"All in all, i haven't had but maybe two scotch ales in my life so i cant really compare it with much. plus, im not a big fan of scotch ales. BUT, on the other hand, it is a nice and complex beer. if it were this or McEwans, i'ld take this."
"Had this for a dessert beer and it was wonderful. Pours a mahogany-tinted dark brown with a minimal frothy head that leaves minor lacings. There is a strong malt presence in the aroma. Hard to pick out exactly what malt but I picked up some coffee, chocolate and possibly toasted (I am not sure, there could've been hazelnut in there too). There are also currents of caramel/honey, figs and dark fruit. This had to be one of the smoothest brews I have ever had, yet alone a wee heavy. The malt taste is defining, but there are citric fruit notes (I think there might even be some crisp apple notes in there) on the side and the caramel rounds it out. The hop bite on the back end is perfect. Just enough to make itself distinguishable yet letting the beer remain ultra-smooth (not slick or watery). Perhaps the only thing keeping me from sessioning is the price. I can't afford $7 a beer for a whole night. Well worth the splurge and a must-try."
"The taste is firstly dark fruit with plum and fig followed by some caramel malt and a bit of citrus that adds just a bit of tartness and bitterness for balance. Nice. The dark fruit is really ruling it and pretty much dominates the flavour several sips in and the alcohol is very well hidden with just some warming after the swallow. One fine sipper I have here. The mouthfeel is medium to medium full and it's lightly carbonated. Man, I wish I knew why I haven't bought it the times I made my visits to Colorado because I'm *really* enjoying the hell out of it. Highly recommended!"
"D:Very easy to drink because of how balanced the flavor is. The malty flavor is strong but not too over powering. Also the sweetness is there but not too sweet either. I wouldn't be able to drink too many of these because of the higher alcohol but it would make a great session ale other than that fact."
"D = Very good, as excellent beer, but not quite as interesting as the 1977. (4.5)"
"Worth a try..."
"Rich deep reddish brown, with small light tan head. Smell is a musty, peaty rich malty sweetness, similar in a way to a McEwans, but more complex. Taste is somewhat similar to smell but more muted, and less sweet. Still earthy flavored with a quite mild bitter finish to it and just a hint of alcohol. Not bad at all, but not my preferred style either."
"Pours a dark brownish red with a medium tan head. Smells of yeast and raisins. Taste is buttery, toffee, with a bit of twang to it. There is also a nice earthy flavor from the hops. Bitterness levels are good. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation levels are a little high. I could drink several of these. Drinks like a session ale, yet is over 7% abv. This is the first Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy I've had, and I must say, I enjoy this style a lot!"
"Excellent. If I ever find it on tap or cask somewhere (Scotland perhaps?) I'll be in trouble."
"The smell is sweet and of figs. The taste is smooth and it malt dominated up front but as it lingers on the palate it is bitter. Very cool. It has a earthiness to it like a mushroom from the ground. Overall the best scotch ale or strong Scottish ale I have tasted to date."
"Mouthfeel is dry and crisp with a little sweetness at the end. Drinkability is good for this abv. A couple of these on a cold night would be nice."
"I would highly recommend this one to anyone who can find it and, if you get the chance, save a few bottles for a few years down the road. Cheers!"
"Overall I thought this was very good, surprisingly good actually. It's a little hard to find around here in Raleigh but it's definitely worth a try if you can."
"I had high hopes for this beer, and my review doesn't seem to match the others on here. Maybe a skunked or too old bottle?"
"Pours dark woody brown, with a slight haze, and red notes when held to the light. Aroma is very roasty, but with some fruity/estery notes, and hints of pepper. Flavor is roasty, with licorice character, and some dark fruits (figs and raisins). The dark malts dry it out quite a bit, but not unpleasantly so. Aftertaste is more licorice, and dark malts, expressing as coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. A nice beer, but I remember it being much more floral and complex."
"Hearty and rich with a thick grain flavor on the end. Definitely supremely crafted and well made and even more so definitely worth tryingand trying again. When I roamed the shelves (before the days of BA where I could find a little help here and there on what to keep an eye out for), this is exactly the type of brew Id be searching for. Flavor and style. No need to say any more than that."
"This is a quite unique and enjoyable scotch. I think I prefer Jacobite but this is one that should not be missed."
"pours dark red, slightly cloudy. little head. very, very smooth going down, hardly notice the abv. if someone asked me to define a scotch style ale, this is what i would hand them. fruity aromas, slight hop finish, sails down the throat like Sanka down the pushcart track. but dont drive your pushcart after a few of these, even if you have your lucky egg."
"Notes: This is pretty rich and complex stuff, but it's so good that I'd almost consider it sessionable (if not for rarity and price). Highly recommended."
"Excellent!"
"Had a bottle at the Ginger Man in Houston. A wonderfully complex beer that I wish was more readily available. It is hard for me to describe everything going on, but it is all perfectly balanced. A great beer."
"It is almost exactly like I am drinking what I smell. Fruits (plums, cherries), sweet malt, licorice and a bit of chocolate. My Irish hat is off to all the Scotsman who get to drink this all day."
"D - This is a beer I look forward to turning other onto. It's the sort of subtle ale that I need some times after lots of craft beers with a focus on hops. It's a sipper, but a good one."
"Increadibly easy to drink, a remarkable brew bordering the exceptional. Not a session beer, though."
"The last few have gone down much smoother than the first. Still wish it had a headier scent, but it's a great beer from the oldest inhabited house in Scotland!"
"poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a pint glass, pours a rich reddish brown color with a decent tan head. smells fruity with a bit of toffee aroma. taste is very malty, sweet fruits and alcohol, but balanced very well. mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. this is a very enjoyable beer, this was my first scotch ale and i think im going to have to try some more."
"Overall not bad at all,have one,sit back and relax,enjoy the brew and then move on to something else."
"Walnut brown color with thin foam. Fruity and toffee odors. Sweet malt taste up front, mild roastiness apparent Finish has some alcoholic bitterness. A bit reminiscent of a stout. Creamy mouthfeel, with a bit of slickness. Well balanced, but not so drinkable at 7.2%"
"A really fine beer. It makes one wish that there were more Scottish ales to be had in the US."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown and burgundy color ale with a medium foamy head with some average retention and some light lacing. Aroma of subtle peat with some toffee malt is well balance. Taste is also a well balance mix between some toffee malt with some subtle notes of peat which is quite enjoyable. Body is quite full with a very nice creamy texture. Very well done and something I would love to have more often."
"It clearly has the hallmarks of authenticity, and is one of the most distinctive Scotch Ales i've tried."
"Overall, a wonderful glass of malty goodness. Very drinkable and the alcholol content is dangerously hidden. Quite an impressive brew."
"12 oz bottled poured into snifter. bad pour, producing little head. smelled of caramel and subtle vanilla raisin. tasted a smooth caramel/molasses. very warming in the mouth, aftertaste was sweet but not syrup. great beer to drink slightly warmer than normal, and would be great during a winter snowstorm."
"This beer poured a brown color with a thin tan head. The aroma was initially sherry like, but then developed into a malty/caramel smell. The taste is malty and complex. Caramel and raisons come to mind as some of the stand out flavors. The mouthfeel is full and coats the tongue nicely without being chewy. I think this is a delightful beer  complex but smooth. I think Ill put it on my A list."
"Drinkability: Well, if you can find any of these gems, pick them up and store them. I think it was a worthwhile cellaring. Nice bit of history and certainly an honor to have been included in the sharing of this fine elixir."
"Taste is slightly burned with the roast of chocolatemalt, which gives the beer it's maltbitter. There is a light bitter but nothing to really fight against the roast flavors. The yeast adds a spiciness which is a little liquorice and a little green herbs. Body is quite thin, I always thought Scotch ales are supposed to be more sweet."
"Overall: A good, subtle brew, more akin to a gruit than Scotch ale in my opinion. Very mild and drinkable, perhaps to a fault."
"Drinkability - this is decent ale, but not great, so, for me that holds down sessionability."
"D: Minimal alcohol burn, but still a bit much to drink all night."
"D: All around, a brilliant ale that would seem to suit any frame of mind. Its malt character is delicious, and its balance and composition is so well executed that it ranks very high in the drinkability category."
"11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark brown color with amber hue when held up to the light with an off-white head. The aroma is dark toasted malts with dark fruits, sweet caramel, and molasses. The taste contains dark roasted malts, a touch of coffee and a dry lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall, this is an interesting brew that is certainly worth a try."
"A wonderful beer that I will try again whenever a rare bottle shows up here in the midwest."
"330 mL bottle, served in my Paceña glass. It pours an unfiltered? dark maroon, with light carbonation, and a half-inch khaki head that retains a thin blanket, and leaves light lacing. The smell is sweet and inviting, and consists of raisins/figs, sherry/red wine, straw and blackberries, light vanilla, and some oak overtones - complex; almost divine. It tastes smoky and earthy at the start, but moves into notes of chocolate, leather, tea?, red berries, apples?, flowers?, and mild hops, while the oak and vanilla contribute throughout. The body is medium, with equal carbonation and finish, and is fairly drying. Overall a great, complex example of a Scottish ale, and one I would drink more often were it not for the above average cost."
"Drinkability- Not too much. I would drink it again but there isn't a lot of drinkability factor on this one. It's quite a big beer with that 7.2 ABV."
"Poured into a chalice a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, basically no lacing at all. The nose is malty, figs, prunes, raisins, slight licorice, and some caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose, very slight alcohol warming in the throat, otherwise abv hidden very well. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little wee heavy, quite different than other's I've had, recommended."
"D- This is a very interesting beer. I think it is good. I will buy this again."
"D: This is a real winter beer for me, drinking it in May and i still enjoy it. A fantastic example of the style. Lots of great flavours and lingering character in the taste. Definitely one to note."
"12oz brown bottle from Ron's. Dark brown body with ruby red highlights and a quarter inch of off-white head. Toasty nutty aroma on this one. Tastes like nut, caramel malt, with roasty and burnt malt, with hints of chocolate. Full flavored and complex. Creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to support it. Fairly drinkable for the full-bodiednesss and abv. Fantastic."
"A mellow, tasty brew for sipping much like it's distilled counterparts."
"Great beer."
"D: Quite good, a very nice example of the style. This isn't a beer I'll rave about, but it's one I'd like to have again. Recommended."
"D: Nice cold weather sipping beer, very tasty."
"Nice, very drinkable, although could get you in trouble with ABV. Good balance between sweet and bitter. May be more bitter than your typical scotch style, but I enjoy that."
"This beer's refinement is what sets it apart from others in the style. A more average example may have a grainier or sharper malt profile, but this was extremely smooth and mellow and transitioned smoothly to a slightly bitter hop finish with a touch of mild coffee grounds. The creamy medium body, and low carbonation made this one go down dangerously easily."
"Pours a murky brown with a thin head. No lacing to speak of. Not a pretty beer. The aroma is complex and winey with the alcohol noticeable but not dominant, and with top notes of dry malt and brandied dark fruits with some sherry notes there as well. The flavor has more of that malty winey flavor, more dark fruit, a touch of woodiness and attenuated raisin and sweet sherry flavors. There is a little nutty spiciness on the finish and a rich creaminess in the mouthfeel, although the beer is slightly thinner than you might have guessed it would be. Quite drinkable, but best as an after dinner sipper. This beers was one of my early favorites maybe 20 years ago,and its nice to see that it still impresses after all these years. Great brew."
"After striking out with other scottish ales, I tried this beer. I was suprised by how much I liked it. Its one of the more expensive beers ive tried, but worth every penny. The Taste was complex but well balanced. I felt like it was a lil heavy but very drinkable and had a pleasant after taste. Give it a try, you may be suprised."
"This was just sorta blah for me. I'm starting to think that I just don't care much for this style... I was hoping this might be ""the one"" to show me the way, but no such luck. A little too subtle for me. I will have to try the Jacobite one of these days."
"D  Easy sipper. Worth trying."
"D- This scotch ale is very drinkable, an excellent scotch ale!"
"The 7.2% warms the chest slightly on the way down. This beverage is refreshingly drinkable. Recommended."
"This is a really great beer! Certainly amongst my favorites. A bit difficult to find, but if you do find a bottle, try it! A wonderful beer to savor."
"Drinkability: I've always been hesitant to buy this beer because of the price - but no more. It's absolutely worth it, a real gem. Exceptionally easy to drink, especially for 7% ABV."
"Poured from the 330ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Body is a beautiful deep brown hue, topped by a thin tan head that dissipates to a tiny ring. Aroma is rather sour, much like cider vinegar, coupled with rich, sweet malt and some underlying notes of dark fruit. Palate is much less acidic - complex sweet, roasted malt with some assertive smoky notes. Finish is actually fairly light and airy. Body is smooth and creamy, just superb. A fine sipping beer, well-worth the premium price on occasion."
"Cheers!"
"The beer poured a brown body with a thin tan head just laid on top of the beer leaving little lacing. The nose and taste where very sweet sugary malts and a booze-esque notes. In the taste only, however, there was a slight hops presence that struck me in the after taste. The mouthfeel was rather thick and stickly with high carbonation. This beer was a very lovely example of Scotch Ale. Nicely drinkable but rather expensive."
"12(ish) ounce bottle, poured into a trappist (Chimay) glass. Pours a very dark brown, almost opaque. Has a very thin head that dissapears almost immediately. Smells malty, citrusy, smokey with a hoppy background. Very little hop in the taste, more fruity malt, very much like a brown ale. Palate is kind of disappointing. The carbonation it has is extremely tiny bubbles, feels almost flat. Not a bad beer, but not worth the price tag ($3.99/bottle)"
"Drinks fairly easy for the abv, very nice wee heavy. A bit pricey at $5.50 a 11 oz bottle"
"D - There is no doubt that this beer possesses a superb balance, but for my tastes, I prefer a more robust malt character from my Scotch Ales. Still, this is definitely quite drinkable, well crafted and if you're not careful to read, you might just miss the big ABV."
"I like this beer and wish I could get my hands on lots more. Dang, San Diego is a long way away.(only place I could find it)"
"From an 11.2 oz bottle (thanks to my fellow beer-loving boss for bringing this to dinner ... he makes more than I do!). A deep mahogoney brown that doesnt let the merest hint of light escape. The thin white top invites you in. Although the aroma is light in nature, its nice musty caramel flourish draws you in even more. Finally ... I get to taste it! Nice. Exceptionally well designed, this is a beauty. Deep and tantalizing in its roastiness with a full complement of oakiness, caramel, toffee, dark plum and buttery finish ... but done in such a manner as to not offend anyone. God, I love beer. (#2668, 1/28/07)"
"D: Opened this for Burns night, this is my first Traquair and I love it. I could see buying more of this for the mild (Florida) winter nights."
"Overall this ale holds up to it's famous heritage. I can't remember a better smelling ale from the bottle in a very long time (I'd give it a '6' if I could). The dryness makes this otherwise sweet and sometimes cloying style really stand alone in the originality category. I bet it's going to be very difficult, if not impossible to find a finer wee heavy in my neck of the woods. I'm very grateful and glad I got to try this."
"This is a very enjoyable beer, probably my favorite Scotch Ale so far. Good for a special day or just a cold winter night. Highly recommended."
"A very drinkable brew. I like it."
"Wow this is really dark! Brown and nearly black yet golden on the edges. Not too much head. Nose is kissed with hops, brown sugar, and caramel. Taste is pretty much the same. This is decent but nothing remarkable. Good beer but I doubt I'll buy it again with it's less than 12 oz bottle and nearly $6 price tag."
"This one has thoroughly disappointed me. Buttery mess of a beer."
"D - I'm sure that if it was fresh it would rank a 90. But this is definitely not."
"The Traquair House Ale is a good strong scotch ale. If you like a good porter, you'll probably really like this beer. It pours golden brown with reddish hues and has a thin tan head. The smell is a very nice malty aroma with hints of peat, chocolate and black licorice. This is a medium bodied beer with low carbonation and a slightly oily mouthfeel. The taste is predominantly roasted malt that is well balanced and not sweet, leading to a dry roasted malt finish. The perfect beer for kicking back a few pints on a cold night, sitting in front of a large fireplace, in an old Scottish hunting lodge."
"This is an incredibly balanced, complex brew and an absolute pleasure to sip, slightly chilled."
"This is a very nice ""sipping"" brew. It has a unique, complex taste. I highly recommended this one."
"I cant recall what I paid for the tiny Euro bottle, but I remember it as something of an indulgent splurge. Traquair House is charming in its own rustic way, but overvalued in my view. I prefer Belhaven."
"Overall, a nice beer to finish out the evening."
"Pours out somewhere in the middle of dark cherrywood and saddle leather with a thin, forced head that settles out to a perfect khaki ring. Smells like a mixture of caramel, toffee, grape juice, cherries, bread, dried fruit, plum, and a hint of anise. Reminds me of a malty Belgian sans spicy yeast. Flavor has a lot of grape in it, along with slightly burnt toast, dates, raisins, honey, caramel, and toffee. I get caramel and pears in the aftertaste. Ridiculously complex. While I'm not always crazy about a sticky sweet beer, this one is damn near perfect mouthfeel wise. Full body, practically a still beverage, and it leaves a lingering coating on the tongue. Not the most drinkable beer, but pretty perfect for a cold and windy night."
"Poured from a 330cl bottle into a pint glass. Bottle had a bottling indicator but not clear on dating. Poured a dark brown with reddish tint. Had a good head that quickly dissipated. The smell was very pleasant with a sweet malt front and tones of fig and fruit. Mouthfeel was a little watery but that is typical of the style. The taste was very good from start to finish. A very drinkable and enjoyable beer. The 7.2% ABV kind of sneaks up on you towards the end. It doesn't really taste high alcohol but by the end you get that nice warm feeling. Highly recommend. It's too pricey to be in heavy rotation but definitely worth getting as a treat (4, RR, T,Y)"
"When poured it was a very dark brown with very little dark tan foam. The smell of roasted malts and fruit filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The flavor of roasted malts mixed with caramel was very pleasing. A nice balance of all the components in this ale. But, not worth the price!"
"Find it..buy it....drink it...enjoy it...and fill yourself with wonderful memories of it."
"Pours from the bottle to a dark brown color with ruby tint, dark brown head that lingers well, and slowly dissipates to decent lacing. Sweet malty aroma of chocolate and toffee, with more of the same in the taste. Nice thick body with a hint of alcohol creeping in at the end leaves for a nice long finish."
"Dark brown pour with a cherry hue against the light. Dirty tan head, two fingered dissapating to a slim frothy ring. The generous nose consists of roasted malts, raisons, cedar, and prunes. The first taste strong with toasted wheat and roasted grains. Hop notes are faint offering a sour, floral background. The tartness remains in the finish along with an alcoholic warmth. Medium to thick body with a suprisingly water mouthfeel. Bitter dark chocolate and a raisony sweetness develop towards the end."
"Pleasant, nicely drinkable. An excellent cool-evening sipper. Not something I'd like a huge amount of, but a great change-up from the beers I've been drinking recently."
"This was a pretty good brew... nothing really caught my attention though. It was a bit watery at times and the carbonation was strange and inconsistent... not a bad drinker but not the best either."
"Wow... Nice ale. Kind of snobtastic - I feel like I could sit around trying to make this review way more overblown than it already is. Great finisher, and I'll surely be coming back to this little number come winter. As a warmer, it'll be a great temptation to overindulge."
"D: Meh, this is not my favorite style, but I am still sipping at it. Not hugely drinkable, at least for me, but I plan on finishing the bottle."
"Well, quite unimpressed with this one. After reading the reviews here, I wonder if I'm even drinking the same brew. It's just a decent beer that is highly over-rated. I'd rather drink a Winter Welcome over this, which is what this beer wants to taste like. Skip it."
"Traquair House Ale was red/brown in color with a thick off-white head that settled to a thin layer in a minute or so. There was quite a bit of lacing. The nose was very malty. This beer just had an wonderful complex malt flavor. It was medium bodied and delicious. A must try."
"Pours a clear but thick dark red/brown, small off white head forms, some spots of lace, head settles down to a thin layer but stays there. Smell is malty, toffee, perfume/floral, some vanilla, chocolate, maybe an oakiness, little alcohol, nice. Taste is real malty, floral and toffee, vanilla, chocolate, grains, some oxidization, so this may not be too fresh of a bottle. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Nice smooth scotch ale, although I fear this isn't the freshest example."
"While pouring it is a milky brown, with a strange greenish almost iridescent hint only seen while pouring [weird]. Get a strong whiff of nice Scottish malt. medium dark cream colored head that stays very thin but present through the enjoying glass. A strong lace that only appears while tipping the glass. A woody nutty aftertaste that's very pleasant. Good mouth feel. Nice wee heavy."
"Nice beer overall. I haven't seen this one localy but from what I've heard it is readily available in the states. Maybe I'll make this one my house ale."
"Had a bottle that poured very dark with a 2 inch head that quickly dissipated to one inch. It had a light scotch whiskey smell with a hint of juniper, but I had to practically stir the brew with my nose to get it. I liked the taste: Heavy malty flavor washes over the tongue with a nutty chocolate taste, but leaves a light impression, which makes for easier drinkibility in the long run. I didn't notice any strong alcohol taste despite the slight whisky smell, and at 7 percent, it's almost pushing it. The mouthfeel was rather watery. Interesting how the taste is rather bold, but the texture of the beer is not."
"Overall and interesting beer, not exactly what i was expecting. Quite nice, but i dont think i would put this on my top 100 beers. but who am i?"
"Pop goes the plain black cap, and alcoholic rum-soaked cherries waft up through the neck. Mmm. There is a beauty in a wee heavy unlike any other style, and this is no exception: rich dark chestnut hue, with less ruby than some others of the style I have had. Hints of red but mostly an ebony tea-like colour. I got only a thinnish head from the beer, but what was there was nice and tight, dusty white colouration. Fine tiny bubbles and quick-moving lace. A respectable looking wee heavy. Plenty of sweet candy and red licorice at first on the nose, then some herbal aromas reminiscent of pine(somewhat akin to some of the Heather Ale beers). Alcohol is fairly detectable. Then lots of prunes and rum and brown sugar. There is also a creamy milk note that renders the aroma extremely appetising. A unique malt/hop combination here too: the malts are very grainy, but the hopping makes it seem very floral--like sweet flowers. The malts dominate as they should though, adding a myriad of smells like raisins, sweet chocolate, maple syrup and caramel. Lovely aroma. The taste falls a little short for me from what I was expecting. At first there are all sorts of lovely sugar-laden fruits and plenty of alcohol. I think it is the end where the beer leaves a very dry, dusty charcoal feel, rather than following up on the sweet smoothness before it. Too the body seems to thin out at the end. Not too say that the beer is without taste. Plenty of woody hop character, dry dark malts, and chocolate and coffee up front. Almonds, licorice, oak, and some vanilla. Mouthfeel is medium-carbonated and very smooth. Very easy to drink, this is. However I find it too dry for the style. Still lovely, but not as good as I had hoped. Have another? Why yes, thank you."
"D: Not bad. I could have another pretty easily."
"A very good Scotch ale without whacking you in the face with alcohol."
"Tastes very smooth and malty, with coffee notes and some burnt wood or caramel. Great, creamy mouthfeel, makes it pleasant with simple food. Nice mildly bitter aftertaste with a hint of brown sugar."
"This is a very interesting and tasty beer. Thoroughly enjoyable. Seems like the kind of beer that would be really excellent with a heavy meal. If you want stoutish flavors, but less body, this is your beer. If you want it for less than $5 a bottle, you're probably out of luck."
"This pours a dark mahogny with a large white head. This is a great looking beer. The smell is malty, with alcohol, bananas,and some nuttyness. The taste is sweet malt with bananas and a hoppy aftertaste. Surprisingly, there is no alcohol taste,this is a smooth and creamy beer. The m/f is light and the flavors are very well balanced. This is an ale to behold. I could drink this all day. Mmmm."
"Pretty drinkable for the style, complexity, and agressive tastes."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy this beer. It is not necessarily an everyday quaffer but I could down a few pints in the right mood."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Truly one of the more pleasurable beers out there, such a lively and complex brew. Borrowing the rich texture of a fine scotch and the soft, mellow flavouring as well. These flavours only enhanced as it warmed up as well. I think this is an ultimate dessert beer and as impressive as any liquor, etc. A beer which exibits such refinement and elegance, a truly special Scottish Ale"
"I wanted to try this beer after reading some of the reviews. I was a little disappointed. It was nice to look at and smell, but I didn't particularly like the taste. It was a medium to dark brown color with a sweet caramel odor. It had a sweet taste, with some hops, but a fairly yeasty aftertaste. It was thinner than I expected from its' appearance. A fair beer."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It is probably one of the better Scottish styles that I have had in some time. I enjoy the fact that this beer isn't really Peaty like many from this region as I don't care for that character. This is a pretty good and very drinkable beer and one that I am sure that I will be drinking again in the future."
"This beer is top notch. Traquair House has really reinforced my liking for the Scotch Ale making it among my favorite styles. Truly a great brew."
"Very good balanced wee heavy."
"I could drink this again and again. Easily quaffed brew with nothing to detract from it."
"Definite caramel on the tongue. Little carbonation to speak of. A very nice beer."
"Fantastic. I have nothing negative to say about this one. Certainly a sipper though, I don't see myself having more than one at a time."
"this is a nice beer, but for the money I am let down. I would like to enjoy it again but dont see myself opting for this often when so much else is available, better, and for less."
"Color is dark mahogany with a ruby glow. Creamy head is light brown and medium-sized. Retention is somewhat weak. Aroma is of sweet caramelized earthy malt. A touch of English herbal hop rounds out the aroma. Taste is of sweet, toasty malt with a caramelized sugar sweetness. An earthy/nutty malt is also in the mix, especially the finish. Hopping is moderate and has an herbal flavor. This is very flavorful and has a nicely layered taste. However, the overall flavor seems to pale in comparison to many of the glowing reviews I've read for this beer. I'll definently give this another whirl to see if I've missed something."
"The beer poured brown with mild ruby highlights. It was topped by a creamy off-white head that receded quickly into the glass. The aroma is more complex than I expected. It has dark caramel, toffee, dates. I get a little raisin in this too. Even a yeast character (never found that in a Scottish Ale before). Layers of flavor. A lot of dark caramel, dates, more of the raisin. There is a mild bitterness on the finish. The yeast comes across on the finish too, just a hint of bread dough. This beer is a game changer as far as beers from Scotland are concerned. It really reminds of a Belgian Strong Ale. Smooth, full mouth feel, no heat at all. Very drinkable. By far my favorite Scottish Ale."
"I personally love this beer. It's got a great malt profile but isn't grainy like some ""malt monsters"" out there. Very smooth and enjoyable."
"This brewery's products are in general excellent and worth seeking out, cask or bottle, at any opportunity."
"D - a good dessert, after dinner beer, easily drinkable"
"Dark brown w/ reddish character. Half-inch light foam cap, minor retention. Aroma of sweet/tangy nuttiness, caramel-like and toasty. Nose is quite weak though. The taste is of brown malt (choc/caramel) with a raisin sweetness. Slightly bitter, and toasty, very dry tasting. Medium thick with average carbonation. Alcohol not overpowering. I wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped, maybe this was a bad bottle??? The sweetness was nice but a bit funky, perhaps stale? Maybe I just don't like this style all that much. It's still worth a try, and even I might have to attempt another bottle..."
"The malt sweetness is nearly dead on for my taste preferences which tend to run on the malty side of things. It is a bit on the sweet side, but no where near levels of Belgian candi sugar derivation. The malt flavor itself is quite complex to boot. A beautifully crafted ale."
"The mouthfeel seems very smooth, and almost flat. Still quite good though. Feels just right for what it is. Drinkability is good. I've been shying away from some of the beers available at my work since I'm unsure of their age, but this one is still cracking. I'll probably drink it in the future, and I'll definitely recommend to my mother, who loves a good Scotch Ale."
"Traquair House Ale is a big time winner. It engages, challenges, evolves, and rewards. So what does it sound like? Well by my ear it sounds kind of like the ocean, but that could have just been the snifter... Oh well, four out of five ain't bad."
"This is simply one of the finest ales I have tasted. Pours a murky brown almost black with minimal head and very little lacing. Smells of dry fruits such as fig, raisens and dates. Also strong caramel notes. Has a very pleasently sweet taste but not too sweet as the alcohol taste is just right. Very notable caramel and fruit notes. All around just an excellent brew."
"Mouthfeel is extraordinarily smooth, frighteningly smooth, deceptively drinkable. I'm not even a third of the way through the glass and it's already the best Scottish ale I've ever had. If this weren't so blasted expensive (nearly $6 *per* 12-oz bottle), it would be a fridge staple."
"Pours a clear caramel color under a thin light beige head that barely musters 1/2 finger, then retreats to film and collar, leaving a smattering of lace spots. Caramel and roasted nut dominate the nose, with lots of barley malt in the background. The mouth is very prickly and quite heavy with syrup. Honey and nuts greet the palate, with some alcohol and a bit of mild dry hops. As it warms, plum and grape also emerge. And the bitterness strengthens. Nice and complex, but one is probably enough."
"It's a glass of stalwart tradition, earthen and staid, rich and graceful, fitted like a well-worn favorite sweater. It's a warm, cozy British friend, easy to enjoy. There's no need for quantity, but the one or two you have are mighty fine in themselves. So, sure, one tonight...and then one another night as well, real soon."
"The taste of this beer is lightly tart up front, with a rich malt character that has notes of toasted malt, a dry biscuit-like note with lots of rich toffee on top. The taste is quite light up front, which is what I expected. The taste is fairly dry, which seems to accentuate the tart tamarind notes. I really like the malt notes in this beer, they are rich and satisfying despite the beer being light; something that seems to be missed on this side of the pond."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Relatively quiet in the mouth, even with some gentle swishing the bubbles don't seem to want to emerge. Surprisingly thin as the beer gradually warms, but certainly big in flavor and warmth. A bolder and more full-flavored alternative to some of our more available Scotch Ales."
"I don't know how good this bottle is, it seems to have set there for about a year. Pours a beautiful head that slowly dissapates leaving a little lacing behind. Color is bright and dark amber to brown. Smells very nutty and creamy, very nice. It has a very bready taste and aftertaste. Taste is a little creamy, nutty, and smooth. It has a coffee undertone and a slight hint of smoke. It's also slightly sweet and malty. It has a smooth mouthfeel that's a little watery."
"D- This beer really caught me by surprise. It has nice earthy sweet malts with some notes of cherries that really compliment the other flavors."
"Spiced raisins, dates and a good bit of alcohol and peat in the aroma. Poured rum brown with a sliver of a white head. Molasses-like texture and the flavors of bourbon spiced bread pudding. Very malty and full. The alcohol flavors actually would lead me to believe it was 10% rather than 7.2% but I have noticed many Scottish brews often taste more alcoholic than they actually are. it is kind of the inverse of the Belgian trademark of masking alcohol."
"Poured a deep dark hue of red, very attractive when held to light as the ruby tones emerge. Head was ok and didn't last long, leaving a ring and some patchwork. Nose was malty and full, a slight hint of fruitiness as well which gave me a strong impression of apples? Taste was unexpectedly clean and pure, full of rich robust maltiness with just barely enough bitterness to balance things out. Alcohol was actually less forward than expected...probably because I am trying this after a Rochefort 10, maybe not the best combination but I couldn't help it. Overall a really nice beer which is deserving of all the acclaim, however as others have said, cost is completely prohibitive for me....over 5 bucks for a 12 oz. bottle. Unfortunately I probably won't have this one again very soon due to the cost although I have no doubt that this is an expensive beer to produce."
"excellent beer to sip slowly and enjoy. rich and complex enough to rival any belgian ale."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown. The beige head is modest and too oily to leave much for lace. The aroma is mostly malts, caramel, and alcohol...and is fairly faint. Very sweet earthy malt character & acrid hop bitterness with an alcoholic chaser. I remember this being better last time I tried it, but this was a fairly fresh bottle. Not bad, but certainly not worth the $5 price tag for me."
"Drinkability/notes: A perplexingly complex and superb beer, well worth the effort to find. Thanks to Hardtarget for sharing this."
"I wouldnt drink this all the time but a nice change of pace."
"quite chewy in the mouth. some bready malted characteristics. just a touch of alcohol again and light sweet fruity finish. I would drink this regularly but for the price i'm one and done."
"Drinkability: It's... OK. It's a nice beer, but not the special experience I was expecting. Given the outrageous price and rather (IMO) run-of-the-mill flavor, I'll stick with Skullsplitter."
"Awesome. Best of style."
"Pours a dark brown with a creamy light tan head. Vinous aroma of sweet caramel and malt. Medium-bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Smooth malty flavor. A hop bitterness coincides to balance the malty smoothness. Touches of caramel and oak appear toward the back. Finish exhibits a slight tobacco taste. This is a top-notch scotch ale."
"The stereotypical tourist-friendly marketing on the label made me feel a bit suspicious about this beer. No reason, this is an excellent ale. It poured with a dark amber almost maroon color, and with a brownish head. The foam melted quickly away and settled as half a finger's hat. The smell was of malt and caramel with some bitterness and smoke in the background. Too much carbonation, though. It tasted pretty much as it smelled with the hops kicking in in the aftertaste, and not with as much alcohol as expected. Traquair House Ale is a fully developed ale with a rich mouthfeel."
"This is very drinkable, but also very expensive."
"Drinkability has to take a hit though. It's a bit strong, which isn't too bad... but it is also a bit expensive, and that puts it a little more out of reach."
"The carbonation is mild (like one could expect) and short, the bubbles are very small."
"This brew pours a dark brown, almost black, color with a one-finger white, creamy head. The aroma is buttery and caramelly. The taste is of sweet caramel, and roasted malt withbuttery notes. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry with nice cabonation. Overall, this is a nice, relaxing brew."
"Beer is good. Happy Scotch Wee-Heavy bering."
"Taste; the malts are there in your face, it has a little smokiness to it, and the caramel and vanilla really come through in the finish. There's almost no hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was thick and velvety, really nice."
"This one poured a deep brown with red highlights. Not really any head to speak of, even in well-rinsed glassware. Earthy, heavy malt aroma backed by peat, toffee, and a hint of smoke. The flavour was sweet and malty with a low, herbal bitterness. Toffee was more pronounced than caramel, it finished quite malty yet not overly sweet. Very low carbonation, a bit dead, but the full body was velvety. What a big, complex malt bomb. Definitely an experience!"
"A lot of flavor in here. Similar to a dopplebock, but more robust, caramelized, and heavy. Aromas bring out a serious molassas sweetness with a very slight grainy bitter quality. Some dark fruits like plumb, dates, raisons. Flavors are more intense than the aroma. Throw in brown sugar, caramel, and above all... malt. Subtleties of smoke, chocolate, and coffee accentuate the flavors. With a sypupy thick texture, this beer falls short of silky smooth because of the carbonation, light grain texture, and alcohol sensation (not drying). A bit cloying makes for slow sipping. Still the best Wee Heavy I've had."
"Flavor is smokey, vanilla, molasses, scotch whiskey, some sugar with a healthy alcoholic kick. Seems a bit higher than its listed 7%. Don't think I could drink more than 1 of these in a sitting."
"The taste--good, but just seems disappointing after spending that kind of money!!! I'd take a 750mL of Maudite any day over this! It IS smooth, malty, a nice bit of hop at the end. This would be a GREAT dinner beer."
"Wow. Now thats special. Buy now."
"D: Based on the other reviews, I'm hoping I got a bad bottle. I may try this one again hoping that this is the case, but if it's like this one, it's just not worth spending the money on."
"Pours a soft head that dissipates quickly. Nice and deep amber, mohagony color. Has a deep malt character and a beautiful aroma. The initial taste seems dry with a slight alcohol warming. Later, there is a delicious nutty, biscuit flavor that lingers. Nothing overpowering, but very complex. This beer has a smooth and deep body, but not too thick. The sweetness is perfectly balanced by the alcohol, hops and carbonation. This is an amazing beer on its own, I can only imagine pairing it with a good meal."
"Here is where the beer failed and in my opinion made it less than ""World Class."" The alcohol is almost imperceptable, until the finish, when it burns the esophagus. It is almost as if the beer ""seperated"" somehow. I am not knocking this beer because I don't like strong beer, I would drink Rochefort 10 for breakfast if it didn't have 1100 calories. it is just a strange and bad experience, two times for me. The taste was pretty good and truly smooth though."
"While most beers have dominate tastes that yell, this one is so seemless, truly less is more. There are no sharp corners to this, all the tastes & experiences have rounded edges that flow seemlessly. It was an eye opening to a new type of beer construction. I highly recommend this, especially if you enjoy Scotch Ales or barreled spirits."
"Bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) in summer 2004, cellared for a year, and consumed in June 2005. Freshness notch on the label was 2004. Pours a thin layer of tan foam that quickly settled to a ring around the glass. The beer is cloudy and ruby-brown in color. Smells of alcohol, raisins and chocolate. The taste is thick malty, with some alcohol and a late sweet chocolate rising. The aftertaste is chocolate that then fades leaving a sweet malt left behind. Thick and bready. Caramel toffee is strong-almost to the point of having a twang. Warmed it has a woody quality and the raisiny/toffee flavor is sweeter and hangs around as a nice aftertaste. The alcohol is tamer and places a nice dry on the side tastebuds to temper the malt sweet. All around, a good beer. Thick mouthfeel and mild carbonation. No lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Overall  another amazing beer from these guys. Very drinkable"
"Poured a copper-tan. Aroma was quite assertive, promising harsh alcohol and dense malt in a barleywine sort of way. Flavor was much, much more muted and mellow than the aroma suggested. Broad malt flavors with butterscotch, toffee and brown sugar swapping back and forth. A touch of dark fruit barely peeked through toward the end, with a bit of thinning out in the mouthfeel. Interesting, and unlike other Scottish ales in the complexity of the malt."
"A medium to dark brown with slight yellow tones when put to the light. The head was minimal but held until the bottom, even though it was a bit sparse. Smelled a bit sweet but not too much there. The taste has great malts, solid sweetness, a bit of acid residue, a bit of smoke. Bloody smooth and very drinkable for a 7+. It was good enough to be a desert beer while not reminding you of a sweet tooth."
"I do believe wee heavies are becoming one of my favorite beer styles. Pours much darker brown than I thought with a centimeter deep head that receded to the edges of the glass. Light lacing around the sides too. Aroma is heavy on the malts. Flavor is hoppier than I thought too for an English brew. The malts provide a nice sweet base, but the hops provide a great balance. There are also tones of caramel and lots of dried fruits: figs, prunes and apples. Mouthfeel has a great full body. Only slightly carbonated. Has a nice syrupy feel to it. This is a great beer to sip with dinner or even better as an after dinner drink."
"This brew pours a solid brown color with a slight tinge of ruby. A small head falls to a fine ring over top. The nose is raisiney, peaty/slightly smokey, and some brown sugar sweetness. The flavor is nice and peaty and smokey with raisin dancing in the background. I like it. Very flavorful, but not offensive as others in the style have been to me. The feel is moderate, with a slight carbonation. Maybe a touch more thickness would help it. Overall, I really like the brew. The flavors are intense, but not offensive. The alcohol is not present at all in the nose or the flavor. Very solid."
"This is an excellent savory sipping ale- perhaps best in winter but great on a cool summer night, as well."
"Traquair House Ale is the second best wee heavy (Belhaven) to ever cross my lips. I love this style and I wish more breweries would dedicate themselves to making just such a rich, complex, traditional Scotch ale as the one I just consumed. If you love this style as well, this one should be on your short list of 'must tries'."
"Drinkability- A very good brew, but a costly one. Not sure it warrants $5.50 for 11oz, but maybe for a treat, pick one up. You won't be tricked."
"Pours a murky dark shoe leather brown with a small light tan head. Nose is made up of peaty, caramelly, brown sugar malts, hints of smoke, oak, sherry, and some whiskeyish alcohol. Very nice. Taste starts off with toasted caramely malts. Oak and peat moss come on as I detect a slight whiskey burn. Traces of vanilla, smoke, and grapes before a malty, yet slightly bitter finish. Medium bodied, with a little too much carbonation. A very good beer, but not my favorite Scotch Ale. In fact, I liked the Jacobite more."
"Pours a gorgeous dark brown with a sturdy small beige head. Smell is malty and then a little more malty. Taste is bubbly malts with some slight bitterness. Finish is not as mellow sweet as I was anticipating. Mouthfeel was somewhat less than full, and dissapointing considering the beer's reputation. Of course, even with the slight bitterness this beer is wonderfully smooth. It was delicious. I'll have it again."
"Slàinte maith, h-uile latha, na chi 'snach fhaic! Gun cuireadh do chupa thairis le slàinte agus sonas!"
"Fantastic, pricey (£2.50 a bottle) but well worth the money. Would work great as an after dinner beer, or with a chocolate dessert"
"A wonderful beer."
"33 cl bottle, bought at Selfridges, London. Beautiful brown to ruby colour, good beige head. Complex aroma of oak and sandalwood, some pine too, old sherry, leather, pipe tobacco, sour cherries, prunes, hints of smoke . Flavour is woody with a pronounced roastiness, coffee notes, strong tea, hints of bitter chocolate, excellent hoppy bitterness. A truly delightful beer!"
"Traquair is neither ablution, persecution, or celestial glory. It's not quite memento mori either... not that earth-shattering. What we have is something in between all of these. It's good and worth a shot due to the sheer age of the brewery and presumably the basic recipe. Mad respek to the brewers for keeping this up. There's some strange shit going on in the Hibernia, man.. this is proof."
"I've tried quite a few beers aged in uncoated oak vessels, but Traquair House Ale has by far the strongest oak flavors and smells, which I found unrelenting by the time the beer was done. Amazing things going on, a juggling act of flavors, but not one I'll be back for any time soon."
"Thanks to Todd (my brother-in-law) for this sample."
"I could do some damage to this beer, but not before it did some serious damage to me at 7.20%."
"Overall 9for me), a very good brew, but one to have occasionally only."
"Drinkability: I'm giving this a 4.5 as this is one badass muthaf**** of a 7.2% beer. I love it, but couldn't session the crap out of it like I can with beers like Fat Bastard (the closest comparison I can come up with). The nose on this, along with the complexity of flavors that arise once it warms to room temperature make this one imposing, and difficult to session, scotch ale. But jesus eatin' beans, it's an amazing beer (and the highest rating I've given yet)."
" Finish is long and pleasingly bitter with warming, smokey alcohol notes. Truly outstanding and unique, hand crafted Scotch Wee Heavy."
"Pours a coppery chestnut with giant tan head which subsides quickly, but leaves a creamy film and good lace. Smells of caramel malts on a slightly smoky, hoppy, and spicy alcohol base. Starts with an initial bitter hop kick, develops dark rummy fruits balanced with sweet, toasted and smoky malts, and finishes with a bone dry flowery hop bitterness. Stupendously creamy and well-balanced in the mouth. Easy to drink, but quite heady. A superbly balanced and tasty brew."
"Overall Impression: Great Beer! The chocolate I so strongly tasted really fits into a great Scottish ale. I can see why this one is rated so highly."
"Poured a rich brown with a red tinge and a thick white head that stuck around for awhile. The aroma was of rich sweet malt with a mineral quality to it. The taste has a very complex malt flavor that has hints of smoked malt mixed in with sweet carmelized grains and a touch of hop bitterness linger in the end with the smoke. The surprising effect of this beer is to have a sweet smoky malt flavor which masks the bitterness of the hops until the very end of the taste when the malt goes away to leave only the smoke and the hops. Finishes dry with a mild smooth carbontion that allows the flavor to be expressed very well. Nice to have once in awhile the high alcohol prevents one from having too many of these in a row. An excellent example of a historic brew which has survived the ages."
"Headless pour... just a thin white ring around the collar, and zero carbonation. Still, what lace there is slides down the glass lethargically after a thinnish swirl. Beer is rosewood in color with bright, nearly cherry red highlights. First aromatic impressions suggest cocoa powder with a dry, mealy nosefeel. Date-like sweetness emerges to drag the nose into a bog of malt. Licorice liqueur whispers in the finish, which is clean and airy, if brief. And boy, does it taste good. Flavors of spoiled walnuts are balanced with the leafy bittersweetness of sasparilla; these presently merge with a forceful body of black pepper and moist tobacco. The last warm sips are quite whiskyish, as of peat and smoked cereal chaff. Mouthfeel is light and creamy, with an uncarbonated yet tingly finish; slightly astringent. Hard to stop sipping, what with the light body and full flavor. This might go well with peanut brittle and cigarillos, but is probably best as a nightcap. Very relaxing."
"Sadly, yet another one my liquor board has decided to stop carrying. Hopefully it, and stuff from Belhaven will return next fall."
"A complex and interesting beer."
"Excellent, excellent brew. Great just to sit and sip, wonderful flavors, and leaves you very warm. Definitely worth the four and a half bucks for the bottle."
"from the bottle. poured a muddy amber with no head. aroma, like a port wine, malts, caramels, honey , black licorice with a hint of alcohol some smoke. flavor 1st sip did nothing 2nd sip I let it linger around in the mouth for a little while than the flavors came out. yum. sweet chocolate, honey, malts, port wine, caramel, a little bit of coffee."
"Drinkability: Truly an exceptional Scottish Ale. Deserving of its accolades."
"Pretty freakin' drinkable if it weren't for the 4$ price tag for a single. Really goes down smooth for a 7%+ beer."
"A sharp looking label, that's for sure. Pours with virtually no head save for a little white on the top that quickly retreats to the rings of my glass. The brew itself is a nice brown/deep copper color. Aroma is super strong. Rich malty notes fill the room. A bit of chocolate is noticable as well. The malt is very rich in this beer but it does not dominate. A little bit of spiciness adds a nice balance. There is also a little bit of smokiness present in the finish. Very rich and drinkable. Would be very nice after Thanksgiving dinner. I'll be buying this one again."
"This is the classiest beer in this style by far. The marriage of malt and hops with the smooth finish puts this in that top shelf beer club which lesser brews only aspire to. Belhaven Wee Heavy is a great beer but it lacks the refined complexity of this beer. It uses diplomacy rather than the club to bring its point across which is why it is a special beer to be savoured."
"Notes: Lighter bodied than I expected. Smoothes and mellows as it warms."
"Drinkability: I could live on a steady diet of this. Exceptional!"
"Came in a 330ml brown bottle, black foil around the neck. Best before date on the side of the front label is the end of Dec 2013--this screams to be cellared, that's a hell of a shelf-life. Pours out a deep clear ruddy walnut tone, a bit of beige foam on the head that subsides quickly. Alcohol immediately has a warming effect when inhaling the aroma, rich malts, brown sugar, molasses, dried dates. The combination of the flavour and the mouthfeel is what makes this truly a delight to drink. Alcohol is present immdediately upon the first sip as well, but has a soothing effect, not a bite. Rich caramel malts, chocolate, carob nut, some earthiness, but all so very smooth, along with a velvety smooth mouthfeel. This comes close to what Ambrosia must be like. It takes a while for the hops to make themself apparent, lightly herbal, a bit grassy, more spicy carob on the aftertaste. Incredibly smooth for the alcohol content, a masterful execution of the brewing arts. I would love to experience what this would be like after it's been aged a good 5 years or so. Humble gratitude is extended to stephenlouis for sending out a bottle of this for me to try, you have excellent taste sir!"
"pours out a nearly opaque, dark brown colour...thin fine head leaving a bit of lace. aroma is strongly peatish....in fact it smells like a shot of tequila....very interesting. oh, the flavour of this beer! woody, smoky, burnt caramel, and bittersweet chocolate. delicious. in my haste to sample a few brews before my housemoving..i wish i would have saved this for a cool october afternoon in the country. this is a very earthy, malty and bittersweet ale that is bitter in the finish and longingly dry and smoky on the tongue. a taste treat...would be great with some roasted nuts and pumpkin seeds in the fall. a brew i will revisit."
"Red clear body with a three finger off-white head is quite attractive in my goblet. Despite having pre wetted the glassware there was excellent head retention and lacing. The aroma was sweetly fruity and a bit oxidized. The taste was vinous and peppery with definitely warming, liquor like, alcohol sensation. The mouthfeel was full bodied rich, but a bit rough around the edges. The hops were surprisingly strong for a Scotch Ale and dried the palette nicely. A good hearty offering from across the Atlantic."
"a clean a clear reddish amber when poured. head settles nicely(it could be a bit thicker). Nice aroma, a little milder than expected, probably because i tried the jacobite ale first. it's an excellent scottish ale and perfect as a meal accompaniment. the flavour is strong but does not become overwhelming by the end of the bottle."
"Pours out a dark brown with mahogany highlights. Nice cream colored head that settled into a lacy film atop my beer.Caramel notes in the aroma, along with subtle fruits, butterscotch, alcohol and a slight roastiness. Taste is equally refined & subtle. Fruity malts (fruity malts??? yup, it's in there) sweet toffee type taste, and very impressive sweet alcohol. Everything is subtle and blends together great. Finish is clean, with a slight stickyness on the roof of the mouth. Drinkability is ridiculous. I could chug this but it demands sipping. Excellent!"
"A very regular head fades into a thin collar on a very dark amber-red color body. The smell shows a very round maltiness, some caramel, some dark fruits, sweetness, wood and notes of scotch. The taste is of a rich maltiness, showing dark chocolate and coffee with sweet notes of nuts, giving the brew a moccha like flavor. A warming but not overwhelming alcohol aspect appears at the time when hops usually get noticeable. The dark chocolate aspect persists and the finish is a bit sweeter than the body. The mouthfeel is excellent, very round and full, smooth, creamy, almost buttery. Thick and chewy, with a low to medium carbonation. A very good beer."
"Drinkability takes a small hit from the alcoholic content but remains high."
"Easy drinking dispite the high alcohol."
"Brownish burgundy hue with a fully diminishing off-white head. Aroma is fully half like a great plum pudding and half like a chocolate cake. Slight vinous counterparts accompany this marzipan married cakefruity royal malt and give it all kinds of fruity suggestions among which stand out grapes, dates, cherries.. Full bodied, complex mouthfeel. Gentle oaky acidity supported by medium effervescence carry the caramel and chocolate with success. Subtle alcohol and peat hints accompany the sweet, but vinous malty finish. Traquair owns the malt."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of crystal malts and roated barley. The taste is good. It is an extremely smooth beer for having such a high abv. . It has a crisp malty flavor with a dry slightly warm finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine old ale. It has good aroma and flavor along with a smooth finish; a good drinker."
"Sampled 3/9/04"
"A nice sipping private beverage. Can picture sitting in Scotland and enjoying the scenery now or even a century back. Some complex flavours in a nice scotch malty brew. Rum and Chocolate, toffee, molasses,nuts Alcohol felt, bit of barley. Slightly bitter aftertaste."
"All and all this is a very enjoyable and drinkable beer. I would love to find this beer again. Thanks to Chatter for finding it for me!"
"Pours a deep rosy brown with a medium, tightly bubbled head. Quite lacey, but not sticky. Nutty alcohol notes and a deep brown mollasses malt overtake the aroma. Some darker fruits. Taste is complex, but not rich. A dark malty character, with a sweeter, fruity underbelly, and a hop bite that kicks lightly at the end. A very nice concoction, though I would prefer a bit bolder flavor profile."
"Dark brown appearance, some highlights warm things up. Head is small, lightly tannish, and sturdy at 1/8 of an inch. Laces adequately but incompletely around the glass. Malty aroma, some senses of light molasses, maple sugar, with a buttery tone to it. Good body and carbonation, chewy and smooth. Flaovor is quite good, big emphasis on malt with caramel, some light fruit, cocoa, and a pleasant light diacetyl touch. Hops mostly balance here, the malt dominates the stolid flavor profile. Finishes with a sense of mushroom muskiness, a woodsy sense. A very nice beer, drinkable, slightly potent, and well-brewed."
"Appearance: Ruby brown tone thin tan creamy textured head leaves nice even lacing. Aroma: Strong rich malt backbone , peated malts bring an air of mild smokiness, oak edge to it, plums and raisin glazed with alcohol nice, world class. Taste: Peated malts touch of smoke good stuff here, fruity hightlights caramel note finishes with the oak and strong sweetness great classic ale. Mouthfeel: Coats the palate nicely medium bodied amazing beer to experience. Drinkability: Very nice balanced all around solid beer one of the best old strong scotch ale, excellent beer glad I finally gave it a try."

"Pours a caramel copper colour with an nice tuft of offwhite head.. The smell is of dark wet breads, spicy hops , a bit of smokeyness, and dried fruits soaked in brandy or rum. The taste is malty up front with roasted malts and a bit of smoke and anise. The alcohol marches up and then the rum soaked fruits take over. Finally a bit of hops come in to balance and dry everything out. Complex beer, but very well balanced and tasty. Alcohol is evident but not overly so. Nice subtle carbonation ads to drinkability. The alcohol keeps the drinkability from being higher"
"Traquair House Ale was a dark copper brown color with a small head. The aroma was sweet, malty chocolate and caramelly. The toasted chocolate taste was pretty good. The smooth taste also had a little hop bite and was not too carbonated. The finish was slightly sweet and dry. The alcohol added a nice boost to this beer. Overall very well-balanced and tastey beer."
"Presented in a quaint 11.2 ounce bottle, this was a beer that I had been looking forward to trying. Pours a deep brown-burgundy color with a restrained brown head. The head is short-lives. Oak, smoke, molasses, alcohol, and an earthy, dry maltiness mingle in the aroma. The woody tones follow through to the taste, where a slightly astringent dryness stands out. Earthy and rusticpeat, nuts, dried fruits, and a British hop bitterness. Extraordinarily drinkable, and marvelous in small sips. Yummy."
"11.2 oz classy looking little bottle with foiled cap. Pours into a tumbler a clear, dark, copper amber with a moderate tan head that quickly collapses into sheets of lacing. Minutes later, only some rings remain. Aroma is toffee and molasses upfront, then a melange of everything else. Burnt campfire wood, some rum soaked raisins and figs, some butternut, some vague spices, and some other strange notes that are impossible to describe. To me, there are notes of soapsuds here, as well. Mouthfeel is easygoing, with low carbonation and medium body. Tatse is about as complex as the nose. Toffee, molasses, leather, wood ash, and just enough hops bitterness to keep it all in harmony. Very reminiscent of a fine Scotch ale. Alcohol is well concealed. My only complaint with this one is the small bottle. I could easily enjoy a bomber of this at a sitting in front of the fireplace. An excellent old ale here!"
"Very soft bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Carbonation level is enough to keep it from being cloying, and actually manages to make it almost refreshing. A classic for good reason. Incredibly drinkable for what it is. Great stuff. Glad to have this old favorite for my 200th review."
"A heavy pour reluctantly gives up a small, creamy, dense head. The beer is ever-so-slightly hazy and a dark, red/brown. Spotty lacing. Wow. Hella nutty chocolate nose. Bready with a touch of grapes. Roasty! grains in the front. A smooth, sweet, fruity-chocolate middle with more roasty grains in the finish. Bitter chocolate. Warming alcohol. It is a nice, nutty, roasty, sweet, malty beer. Chocolatey smooth with pleasant warming alcohol, yet little alcohol taste. I would drink this all winter if I could get it here."
"Good smooth feel but with definite edge in the finish. Good, but not great drinkability."
"all in all a great brew for this 15 degree boston evening."
"Thin to medium bodied in the mouth. A highly drinkable beer."
"Not bad but certainly not what I was expecting."
"Pours a deep coppery chestnut color with a pillowy tan head. Dark crystal malt aroma and a peaty earthiness (compost pile) mixed with a healthy yeast smell, too. Caramelly sweet with the same earthiness coming through in the taste. A little bit of vinous hop character, but predominantly malty. Alcohol noticable but masked with malty goodness. Best Scotch ale in the world, hands down. The quality of a Belgian trappist, only from Scotland. Enjoy at 55-60 degrees."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"Drinkability: A great ale. This is my perfect winter warmer or fireplace sipping drink. A classic."
"Poured a small light brown head that left a good amount of lacing. Brownish amber in color, with a little light passing through. The aroma of chocolate and sweet malt. Mildly bitter coco flavor combines with a light maltiness, and hardly any hops. All in all a smooth, well balanced beer."
"Color is a of a chestnut brown, no real head appeared as I poured it slowly into a 10 oz tulip, just a few big bubbles, no real lace either. Aroma is all malts, loads of caramel, sweet, dark, with a earthy undertone of tobacco and wet wood. Taste is super mellow of caramel, dark toffee, some dark fruit notes of plum and banana, the malts are provided all over the place, but not thick, more so of a very clean and softly calming chewyness, thinnish to the point of becoming non-existent really. Not very flavorful. Some notes of hazelnut and molasses poke through as it warms but nothing sticks out really. Kinda boring and plain. Feel is a bit thin, the front of this is like water, nothing there, but luckily it picks up some and renders some light heft over the middle and has a smooth lightly sticky, calm, malty sweet finish that doesn't last all that long. Not something I'd buy again, nearly forgetable."
"Drinkability: Agree with other reviewers...make sure the chill is off before this is served. Slightly cold, it's thin and blah... let it warm and the character explodes. Pricey... but a great way to treat yourself. Best example of the style I've ever had."
"Perfect chestnut brown color-almost murky to the eye with a very minimal but fine veil of foam that lingers throughout, and puffs up quickly with added swirling. Wonderful warm, almost spirit like in the nose with cinnamon, raisin, and vanillla-some chocolate as well. Lovely bitter/fruity hop bite showing dried fruit, bitter chocolate and malt-nicely spicy in a very warming way. Medium bodied and creamy-the finish is long,warm and memorable. A very decent drink!"
"Sat very dark in the glass with little visible activity, wonderful champagne like aroma,lots of nice flavors happening, especially molasses and currant, because of its low carbonation, it had the smoothest of all possible textures, loses a little bit of its sweetness as it goes along, lots of setiment on bottom of glass. Wonderful stuff, a little pricey and the next morning I had some intestinal problems that I couldn't blame on anything but the beer."
"Dark burgundy color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and peaty. A medium bodied Scottish ale. Malts are chocolate. Plums and other dark fruit sort of dominate the flavors. There is also a touch of soy sauce amongst the smoke and peat. Hints of the 7.2 % alcohol sneak through at time. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is a little bit thin and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Quite a tart finish once you have a hold on it. Good but a bit to handle."
"Nice."
"Brown hued with old cherry hints, slightly hazy. Big bubbles construct a short-lived beige head, which fades quickly to a soapy residue, does last for the entire consumption. Didnt lace. Lovely nose, strong & stable with whiffs of chocolate, roasted malt, sweet alcohol, brandy, and dark fruits. Mildly potent. Fruits and alcohol, sweet maltiness, dull hops bitterness, dry chocolate lightly tickles the palate. Great roasted malt aftertaste! Tremendously balanced... an amazing feet in brewing! Slow, smooth carbonation. Medium-full mouthfeel. A great beer to quaff. This is a great Old Ale it is apples and oranges but Traquair Jacobite is a great deal better. So if there is a choice between the two beers I am taking Jacobite. This one is still recommended."
"Pours a very nice brown with a slight reddish hue with a light head,aroma is sweet and malty with some oaky aromas as well.Taste is rich and malty with alcohol notes.Some dried fruit flavors linger with some definent oak hints as well.Incredibly well made a nice beer to savor before bed."
"I opened this one after opening a July 1, 1996 Kulmbacher Reichelbrau Eisbock. My friend commented that that reminded him of Traquair house ale, which I just happened to have in my fridge as well. We opened this to compare. I must note, the bottle is from a case purchased of untold age, as the label (green writing on cream color label), as we were told, has not been been around since the early 90s. It poured a nice chestnut brown color, with the certainty of a fig aroma. There was not really a head to be seen. This is certainly a special beer for it to hold up so well over time. The taste was a rather sweet and current-like. The mouthfeel was pretty smooth and full. I must say, the Reichelbrau was a tad richer tasting, but that may be because this was old and possibly not kept in ideal conditions."
"Update: I sampled this again in 2004. It was as complex as I remember it before. I picked up a lot more chocolate and coffee. Im not changing any of the ratings but once again highly recommend this offering from Traquair House."
"This beer pours a dark brown color much like some of the Belgian abbey ales. It had a small and quickly dissipating head and left little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very fruity - again, like some of the better Belgian abbey ales - the aroma of malt is also present. The flavor is very full and has lots of character. The flavor of some sweet fruit (maybe grapes) is very apparent. My only gripe is that it tastes very tart. After the head died down, there was no carbonation left in the drink, which made it pretty smooth. Pretty decent beer. A little tart, but good none-the-less."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep brown, almost black color with one finger of light caramel foam that fades away to a small collar. There is a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is a rich nutty aroma, with hints of coffee and toffee. The smell really pumped me up for the taste. The taste is a smooth roasted malt and alcohol mix. Not too much hops present, but who needs it with this sweet caramel and roasted nutty flavor. The body is heavy, yet smooth. The drinkability is also pretty nice for 7.2%. A big thanks to brewdlyhooked13 for this fine ale!"
"this house ale is a beautiful rich ruby brown with a very pale thin head. it smells somewhat buttery with a hint of fruit, maybe grapes. the taste is something between a tangy chocolate and toffee. something a little walnutty there too...and again, like the smell, something reminiscent of fruit, but i can't put my finger on it, really, really nice though. good thick mouthfeel, with more carbonation than i expected. overall a real treat, that i'll definitely be trying again (so expensive though)."
"Pours out a medium brown with a small head. Smell is malty and sweet. Taste is well-rounded, with a nuttiness that's quite intriguing, with a little hop tinge in the back. Sweet, but not too sweet. Mouthfeel is warm; my taste buds really liked this one."
"BH"
"Pours a gorgeous rich impenetrable cordovan with ruby hues. The fading beige/tan head with varying sized bubbles leaves a sliding lace. Citrusy hop, sweet malt and toffee aromas last awhile. An alcohol fume fades after a couple of whiffs. The full malty body provides a complex array of flavors of plums, butterscotch, coffee and blended Scotch. Citrus hops, a trace of mint candy sweetness and a slightly resinous camphor taste contribute to an ale just bursting with multi-directional flavors. This is a wonderful ale! What took me so long to try it?"
"All in all a wonderful beer and the true exemplar of the Wee Heavy style."
"Drinkability: a great savoring beer, should almost be enjoyed out of a snifter or wine glass"
"Wherever this is the House Ale, I'm coming over more often! Big thanks to JohnnyDuvel for the trade!"
"While it seems a bit pricey at almost $5 for a small bottle, it's well worth it."
"Only modesty prevents me giving this beer the 5 , 5s..yes it would get excellent drinkablity..but who could afford to drink many?"
"Medium to full bodied. Good going down. I would list it more toward the Dark Strong Ale end of this category."
"After I finished this one I wanted more."
"The color is wonderful dark amber shade with a nose that to me has an almost gingerbread smell (but that is just me). The only compliant that I can find with Traquair is that the bottle is to small. I would love to find it in 750 ml bottles."
"This beer pours a clear dark brownish red color with a thick clingy tan head and a firm mouthfee. The smell is roasted malt with a slight grassiness. The taste is clean, nutty malt, with a slight herbal quality and pleasant warming alcohol. Overall a rich malty ale with a clean, rather dry finish."
"Indian brown/dark amber in color. A small but thick off-white head forms and leaves a nice lace, but no lacing down the glass. Raisins and dark fruits as well as some alcohol are in the strong aroma. It's a smooth, medium-bodied brew with low carbonation. The aroma translates to the flavors, very amazing with just the right balance and touch of alcohol. It's definitely a sipper. As it warms, prepare for a little more alcohol character and a pleasant toasty touch, as well as more pronounced raisin/dark fruit flavors."
"Unfortunately this was my second beer at the sitting, the first was Westy 12. Im going to have to come back to this one."
"A beer brewed in a castle. A nice start is the pour.A deep dark brown beer with a perfect 1 inch tan head. The aroma is a stand-out, a very complex mixture of ripe fruit,tobacco with a hint of smoke,chocolate,molasses,vanilla,brown sugar and various spices. This is a medium bodied beer but not as complex tasting as the aroma. It starts malt sweet with a little orange peel with a nice dry hop bitterness and smoke in the finish. The finish is drier and shorter than I remember from past bottles, this one may be a bit oxidized.I'll have to try another one to see, boo hoo me! A very nice scottish strong ale and another bottle may give it a better score."
"Was expecting a lot more from this beer, but was somewhat dissapointed. Little to no head and a hazy cherry in appearance. Aromas were mostly that of sweet fruit. Very caramelly in flavor with some good fruitiness as well, but overall everything just seemed to blur together. Alcohol was evident, but not over the top... still had to drink pretty slowly."
"Little to no head atop this dark chesnut/copper brew. It was consumed a little below room temp, and a distinct mix of piney earth and alcohol aromas was present. Tasted of dry earth and alcoholic carmel-ish flavors. Malt sweetness. Just the tiniest bit bitter at the end. Well-balanced. Nothing that stands out in my mind as ""one of the greats"" but it's certainly a fine beer."
"(source: Paradise Alley; Jacksonville, FL)"
"Pours a deep chestnut, with a thin but very persistent head that leaves very little lace. Aroma is somewhat chocolatey, with some caramel and fruity alcohol notes. Flavor is very heavy on caramel malt, with some chocolate, alcohol, and just a touch of an herbal finish, could be a little bit more balanced for my tastes. Has a smooth mouthfeel, with a medium body. A solid strong ale, but just misses the mark (balance) required to be great."
"This beer makes me think of ""Old Peculier", in a way. Dark, a lttle dry, with chocolate overtones. Poured with a medium sized head, disappeared soon after. Very little lace. The alcohol strength is not noticed at all in the flavor. Warming, pleasant, and flavorful. Kind of a unique, and maybe old- fashioned type of beer. A pleasant change of pace, definitely one to try!"
"The beer poured to give an amber liquid with a trace of white foam. The aroma was mild malt. The taste was dry, with hops the dominant flavor, though not very strong. The mouthfeel was thin, with low carbonation. The finish was thin (hops). The drinkability was OK. I wasn't very impressed with this beer. Perhaps I should give it another chance."
"Clear deep scarlet red color. No head or collar. No carbonation is evident. Rum, oak notes, alcohol, dark fruits like plum and cherry and some dry notes are perceived on the nose. This is one of the beers that I can tell I'm really going to like just from the nose. The flavors are subdued, mellow and very nice. Rum soaked raisins, cedar, chocolate covered cherries, bread pudding, plum and fruit cake all seem to dance on my palate here and there. From that description, this would make for a fine X-mas brew. I can't wait to try the Jacobite I've got in the fridge. Mouthfeel is slick and uncarbonated. Body is medium. Drinkability exceptional. Spendy brew, but worth it once a year or so."
"Into the glass it goes a beer that is deep garnet in color with an unobjectionable head, sufficing lace to coat the glass. Nose that of a fine brandy, with malts and a touch of caramel. Malt sweet at the front, the top middling in mouth feel. The finish is fundamental in its carbonation, germane in its hops with a droughty aftertaste, quite a drinkable beer, and a pleasure to ""Whiff"" such a nose."
"Reddish brown in color with a 1/8 "" white head.  Very complex and rich flavor.  I detect roasted flavors with caramel and butterscotch.  Sweet with a bit of bitterness.  I taste some oak and sherry flavors too, the alcohol has a warming effect.  Beer for sipping.  You could spend a lot of time thinking of the flavors present.  The bottom of the glass comes too soon to fully appreciate everything going on here."
"Slainte-va!"
"Alright, I'm really going to try to retire this year and move to the Traquair house. It is beer paradise. This is a clinic in balance. I had this fear of Scotch Ales that was based on some experiences with some overly sweet, alcoholic versions. This is like a great Burgundy wine, expressive of the place from which it emerged and where it was aged. Stony with notes of overripe cherries, strawberries, caramel, coffee, baked pear, chocolate-orange sauce, linden leaf, and dune grass. Do not miss this beer."
"Dark, mysterious, and rich looking.  Reddish brown color that's hard to notice without close inspection.  Pours a small head that settles quickly, but leaves enough behind for satisfaction.  Rich, roasted aroma of malty sweetness.  Very earthy.  With a taste, the first of the many flavors that hit me is a roasted coffee-like flavor.  Then butterscotch sweetness rolls around.  Mostly malty, very rich, earthy, and chewy.  Just a slight hop bitterness that makes it perfectly rounded.  Very complex flavors here.  You can definitely see, smell, and taste the work that went into this fine ale.  All of it just says ""handcrafted"".  Absolutely top-notch, and worth every penny of the steep price in my opinion.  Unfortunately, the price also makes it just an occasional treat for me, but it's definitely worth the wait to savor another."
"The only major complaint I have about this beer is that its mouth seems a bit thin for the style.  Beer is extremely drinkable as it is, but a bit more body would have made it truly decadent."
"The deep garnet hued, lightly hazy brew is topped by an off - white head that quickly settles into a thin layer that coats the rim of the glass.  Deeply malty sweet toffee, heavily caramelized sugar, a touch of fruity prune along w/ a hint of roasted barley sharpness in aroma.  As the beer warms, unexpected mild but pleasant heaty fusels eek their way into the aroma.  Although sweet due to the appropriately low hop bitterness, smooth roasted barley bitterness, light chocolate, and dark crystal malt provide a rich & enjoyable malt profile.  Medium bodied w/ a smooth and dextinous mouthfeel.  Finishes clean, pleasantly sweet, lightly roasty, w/ a bit of alcohol warmth. Simply put, Traquair House Ale is a balanced, flavorful and very drinkable brew.  More than 11.2 ounces would've been appreciated."
"157"
"The brew has an oaky earthiness to balance its dark-malt nuttiness. Best served with game in a thistle."
"A dark, malty excellent ale.  Low carbonation.  Why is anything thing this good so expensive - $6.39 for 330ml.  Very smooth, easy to drink but it is a sipper with the high ABV, anyway you want it to last more than a few minutes.  Bought in Wells, ME."
"Nice beer, but no way near the complexity and no way near as interesting as there Jacobite, it still is very classy though and tasty to boot."
"In my opinion, the best Scottish ale out there. Pricey, but worth every penny. Perfect balance; the model for the style. Any time you see this one available, grab it. That might actually be its greatest problem -- lack of availability. It used to be available in Texas, then pulled out, came back, and now it's gone again."
"Truly a pleasing brew ... sip and savour this delicate ale. Rich and complex with a perfect balance to make it that much more drinkable. One of the best ales that we have reviewed to date. This is more than just an ale ... it is an experience."
