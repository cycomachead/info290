Usually not a fan of linenkugels beers, but this beer was 4 bucks and was 2 years old so I figured ""What the hell"". Overall, I wouldn't seek it out but it was a pleasant experience and I would recommend picking up a single if you get the chance.","SackBlabbath","Nov 22, 2014"

3.99,7.8,3.75,4.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Well, this beer was certainly an adventure.  As a wee heavy, it’s an utter headscratcher, but as a sour ale it’s a rather creative interpretation, with the prominent dose of anise integrating remarkably well with the tartness.  The alcohol strikes a good balance between character and concealment, allowing it to remain highly drinkable in spite of approaching double-digit ABV.  Leinenkugel’s craft arm has shown promise in some of its other offerings as well, even if they haven’t quite hit the bulls-eye just yet.  This is worth trying if only for the novel experience, and even more so for the sour ale aficionado.","MaximalC","Oct 03, 2014"

4.37,18.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Found this at a local shop (2012 vintage) and scooped one up. Not too thrilled when I noticed Leinenkugel on the label (which I associate with the annoying TV commercials about shandy), but got over it. Decided to perform a memory charm (to you Harry Potter fans) to wipe the negative associations away before trying it. I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised and impressed. Poured a deep, chocolate brown, with ruby edges when held into the light. 2mm of head dissipated quickly to nil. The aromas were v. nice and opened up more as the brew warmed in my snifter. Molasses, tobacco, figs and raisins, a hint of apple. Mellow nose, yet complex. The taste was initially sweet, with strong hints of those dark fruits and the tobacco note, slight breadiness. I'd like to side by side with a fresh one. I have a feeling that this was improved with a couple years on it. Mouthfeel nailed it... smooth with a nice lingering taste. All damn enjoyment here, folks. Try this. I am not going to sleep on Leinenkugel again, though I might hold off on the shandy. Cheers!","Mikus","Sep 26, 2014"

Smell of peat, caramel, moderately roasted grains, and a hint of dark plums. Thick mouthfeel with syrupy sweet roasted malts up front, heavy caramel malts, sweet plums, and a light tinged hop bitterness that gives into a nice contrast to the booziness of this Wee Heavy on the back. Complex and earthy. Almost a scotch ale. I hate to say it, but I would think that this beer suffers with the identity of the brewer.

Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, cherry, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light nuttiness, light smoke, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, cherry, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light nuttiness, light smoke, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, light nuttiness, light smoke, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice scotch ale style. All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 10, 2014"

The level of toast in the malt bill does a great job of balancing the sugars so they don't make this beer too sweet to enjoy. I know I liked it enough after the first couple of bottles to make a point of grabbing a second four-pak. What's interesting about this beer is the way the burnt wood shows up only in the back-end of the finish, giving it a campfire feel.","BuckeyeSlim","Oct 25, 2013"

Taste is much the same with smoke and band-aid flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of smoke bitterness on the palate with each sip.

The lacing can be a wee heavy(pun intended) and linger on the glass. It smells of burnt brown sugar (ala creme bruľe) with the slightest touch of peat. The taste overall is kind of sweet with a bitterness that hits the back of your tongue with a Smokey peat flavour that lingers and completes the experience. The mouthfeel is thin but hints at syrup with a touch of carbonation. Over all this is a delightful beer especially for those who enjoy a a touch of smokiness in their adult beverages.","walkerfrost","Mar 08, 2013"

The nose comprises light roasted malts, clove, brown sugar, light molasses, a pinch of black pepper, and a smidge of fig. The taste brings in more of the same at the start, but as things progress a definite sense of strong banana weaves its way betwixt all the other flavors. It gets pretty damn strong at times, competing directly with the spicy roast for my tastebuds' attentions and detracting from the overall wee heavy experience. Near the finish, this banana bit starts to appear a bit toasted. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a decently solid Scotch ale, but one whose banana character holds it down.","TMoney2591","Oct 22, 2012"

Opening with plenty of malt character, this has some heavily toasted malt, burnt sugar bitterness, toffee, some grainy astringency and is, in general, rather intense. The leather pairs quite well with the dark brown sugar and dark caramel, but ultimately, the lack of balance is to the beer's detriment. Nice flavors of rum and raisins are also present. Rather dry and highly carbonated, this beer finishes with flavors of burnt sugar , brown sugar and some sweetness. Some earthy hop bitterness is noticeable as well. Medium-light in body, this beer is quite nice on the palate but for the high carbonation. As it warms up and the carbonation dies down, it improves significantly, and I'm upping my T score to 3.5.","DefenCorps","Jul 09, 2012"

I knew it would be sweet, but was still rather taken aback by the astounding sweetness I was affronted with. I love sweet beers and after a few sips, I was OK with the level of sweetness, but it's definitely the sweetest beer of the style that I've encountered and at first I thought it was too much. It also has a smoky, tobacco-like taste and a roasted malt bitterness. It's VERY sticky. It's definitely within style, but is an extreme example of the characteristics with which the style is generally described. VERY sweet, VERY alcoholic, VERY smoky, particularly tobacco-like flavours, and ALL bitterness is roasted malt-derived. This is an extreme example of the style, so be prepared. It's not bad if you're into that kind of thing, but it's right on the edge of being over-the-top.","ElCommodoro","Jun 10, 2012"

It features an array of malt flavors such as toffee, caramel, cocoa, cherry, butterscotch, and cream. It's surprisingly well rounded. The cocoa comes around a bit more n the after taste. It's sweet without being overpowering and the lighter mouthfeel probably aids that. It drinks on the lighter side of medium in body but isn't sticky at all. The aftertaste is really nice. It's interesting. Overall I thought this was a fantastic scotch ale. The Big Eddy series mpressed once again!","aasher","Apr 20, 2012"

I get a lot of dark fruit and some peet malt, as well as some caramel and some alcohol. The flavor is more of the same. The alcohol and dark fruit notes are dominant, with the caramel and toffee malt and a little bit of smoke hiding in the background. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Apr 16, 2012"

3.59,-3,4,2.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and I thought that it was a good example of a Wee Heavy, most everything seemed on par with this beer expect for the aroma and the body. This beer was pretty drinkable for a Wee Heavy, just about as drinkable as Dirty Bastard, and it hides it's alcohol really well, I could drink another one if I had it, pretty impressive for the style. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the nice and complex flavors, this beer looked damn good and the added peat smoke flavors made for a nice and complex Wee Heavy. What I like least about this beer was the aroma and the body, the aroma was going in the right direction till I got to the out of place sour and vinegar aromas and the body could have been just a little thicker. I might buy a single of this beer again if I feel like it, but it for sure doesn't come close to knocking off Dirty Bastard as my go to Wee Heavy. If you are a Wee Heavy fan you should give this beer a try, I found everything except the aroma to be on par for the style. I thought that this was a pretty solid Wee Heavy and with a little work on the aroma and body it could be able to hold it's own against some of the big names of the style. I wasn't to impressed with the Big Eddy RIS. but I found this beer to be a nice improvement and I am for sure down to check out more beers from the Big Eddy series, if the trend continues and these beers keep improving then there will be some great things to look forwards in this series. Good job Leinenkugels, thanks for making limited release beers for the connoisseurs, we appreciate it.","StoutHunter","Apr 02, 2012"

Sweet burnt caramel up front rounded out by a lightly kilned malt taste and some alcohol. Low carbonation. Creamy, thins out slightly on the finish.

4.03,8.9,2.5,4.5,4,4,4,"12oz bottle, 2012. Pours mahogany with a very thin head that leaves no lacing on the glass. Aroma literally fills the room - sweet, earthy, caramel, peat, and wood. Tastes are earthy, boozy, woody, peaty, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, smoky, musty, and faintly peppery on the finish. Alcohol is well concealed. Mouth is full bodied; slightly cloying and with the high ABV it's definitely a sipper. Good representation of the style. I enjoyed this one, and perhaps the consistency of this one is off because I did not encounter some of the nastiness that others seem to be getting this this one. Leinie haters perhaps? I thought it was good.","barnzy78","Mar 14, 2012"

1.94,-47.6,3,4,1,1,1.5,"The hard part to get over is Leinenkugel's is making craft style ales that are up nearing 10% abv yet they pour like fizzy yellow carbonated beers. The color is nailed a deep ruby nearly mahogany body with a light khaki head forming thick, and dwindling and fading fast, specks of lace are said...this beer misses the boat on appearance. Aroma has tart fruit notes, dark ripened raisins a bit of booze marinating those plump jewels of shriveled grape. Definite caramel notes a hint of smoked malts, and a tart apple cider lingering quality in each sniff. Flavor harsh acidic grape juice with ripened raisins and fake oak chips with a strong booze overriding the whole experience, each sip makes want to gag, this is truly the worst pseudo craft sin I've come across yet I will drink a six pack of the Anheuser Busch Wild Blue before I ever reach for this again. I honestly have a headache from the first sip, drain pour with a capital D, get out of here cloying gag inducing sips of unrefined malt sugars floating around in a watery substance. Prolonged alcohol burn in each sip, burns the back of your throat down to your gut. Overall get out of dodge stay the fuck away from this beer, please do not enter...truly horrible creation and a sorry excuse for any beer let alone something attempting to be a craft beer.","WVbeergeek","Mar 14, 2012"
