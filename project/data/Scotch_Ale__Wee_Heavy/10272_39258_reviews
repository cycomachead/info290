"Was pleasant but not outstanding. Not sure the rum element was for me."
"Its presentation is pretty good though and it's only sold in establishments where it's promoted skillfully."
"Cheers!"
"O: flavor wasn't as complex as I expected, but this was quite nice;"
"Very nice beer with an amazing hint of rum. Strong abv but very subtle beautiful taste. Nice balance of flavours"

"Mahogany in color with a fingers worth of head.  Smell is sweet sugar with a mixture of vanilla, oak, and rum.  Taste is initially sweet, dominated by rum with oak more towards the finish.  Mouthful is thin with medium carbonation.  Overall a great beer for rum lovers."
""
""
""
""
"I keep trying all the different beer from Innis & Gunn and just can't find one I like."
""
"Finished in oak rum barrels, this beer imparts the sweet and spicy characters of the barrels. Simply delicious!"
""
""
"I love beer and I love rum, so I thought I'd love this. But I don't. I still love the idea, but this one didn't work for me."
""
""
""
""
"not bad, but ultimately a light taste"
"The most curious beer I've ever had and my favorite"
""
""
""
""
""
"I love these beers.  The flavor profile is balanced, easy to drink & understated.  Very smooth."
""
""
"It is light, with a nice malt base and doesn’t allow the hops to overwhelm the pallet. With a low ABV of 6.8% it is highly drinkable, while the rum from the oak chips adds a sweetness instead of the sting of pure alcohol that too many barrel aged beers hit you with."
"Smells and tastes like rum, without the bite of the alcohol. The pint that I got was solid, it's not totally my thing but it will probably appeal to many. Pretty nice if it is your bag"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love the burbon flavor and feel"
""
""
"Delicious mix of malty sweetness with a smooth finish. Making it available year round as part of their core brands and switching all their bottles from clear to brown was a great idea an should help preserve the taste people are looking for in a rum oak aged beer!"
"Better maltbone and mouthfeel than in Original, but still I'm dissapointed."

"Overall: Disappointing - a couple of friends rate this quite highly but I'm finding it difficult to see where they're coming from. There's a fair bit of depth in the smell but the taste is completely overhauled by the spirit/rum flavours, meaning that ultimately this is a bit one-dimensional. Worth trying, but not really worth the bother of actively seeking it out IMO."
"Didnt enjoy this at all"

"Truly wonderful, a definite beer for a special occasion. The rum finish is outstanding, definitely has the spice of a Demerara rum like OVD."

"Coming out of the bottle it pours a translucent brown which once in the glass settles into an almost opaque brown. As the name suggests, there is a rum aroma and taste. You can also taste the oak. I am not crazy about the finish since rum has never been my favorite liquor. There is too much of a medicine like after taste for me. The feel is refreshing in a soda like way. Perhaps the mouth feel and color makes me feel like I am drinking a Coke. I am not as familiar with this style and perhaps need to get used to it. Will try other examples of this style and perhaps re-evaluate my rating. However, for now I do not see myself buying this one anytime soon."

"Poured a nice one finger head that dissipated quickly leaving a little lacing with a nice rim ring. The smell from the rum cask and red was great, very sweet with honey and caramel. The taste balanced with the rum and oak being on the backside and blended perfectly. A perfectly aged beer with light enough flavors for anyone to enjoy. Not a stand out beer, but one that stands on it's own. I will buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"The aging on this beer appears to have been properly done.  The beer certainly picked up the rum notes without tasting as if they were merely flavor additives.  However, I like Scotch Ales and didn't rate this beer higher because it lacked some of the fullness I look for in a wee heavy,  I've never had an Innis & Gunn without the rum aging and don't know if that is indicative of this beer or if the beer was mellowed too much during the aging process.  Still a good beer and I would certainly drink it again."
"Pours amber-brown clear beer with nice off-white head. Smell of rum, woody smoke, dark fruits and caramel. Taste is semisweet, caramel, nuts, notes of rum. Light body despite its ABV. Not very impressing."
""
""
""
"330ml bottle. Amber brown colour, tall frothy head which quickly disappeared, leaving no lacing. Gentle aroma of rum, dark fruits, caramel and sweet malt. Gentle sweetness and a little bit of spice develops into a hint of bitterness. Light to medium palate and a suggestion of alcoholic warmth. Not overly assertive but pleasant and drinkable, nonetheless."
"2.4/5: Proof that skunk and diacetyl are a poor combination"
""
""

"Overall: It's been quite a while since I've had the Innis & Gunn Original, but I think I like this one just a bit more. Very nice."

"I didn't think this beer would've been this good by the bottle. Clear bottle with green backing. It was a lite red and brown. It has a very nice head. It has a strong but great smell. It tastes very good. Not an overpowering taste of rum or oak. Just perfect imo. I will definitely drink this beer again."

"Final words, if you can acquire this brew it is worth your effort. Even domestic lager drinkers will enjoy this change from the ordinary. Also unlike the canned data on this brew it is actually 7.4% abv."
""
"Overall: another great beer from Innis & Gunn - very different, a bit of a riot in the mouth to be honest. On balance, taking price into consideration, I would probably prefer their Spiced Rum Finish, as it is around 75% the cost."
""
"O: a terrific scotch ale from I & G. Smooth, heavenly. The rum really makes a difference. A step up from their regular scotch ale. Wish I'd bought more. Recommended."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This is the third offering from Innis & Gunn which I have tried: one good, one bad, and this one so-so. It meets the type criteria well, but just doesn’t taste very good to me. Perhaps without the clear bottles sitting in the light for God knows how long…"
""
"330 ml bottle into snifter, best before 4/2014. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, vanilla, rum, oak, plum, brown bread, light clove, herbal, and oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and oak notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, rum, oak, plum, brown bread, light clove, light coconut, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, rum, oak, plum, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of malt and oak flavors; with a great malt/oak flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oaked scotch ale! All around good complexity and balance of malt and oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall: A decent beer but wouldn't rush out to get it agin. May have got a bottle that had too much sun."
""
""
""
""
"O = I really like this beer. I think it would be best as a standalone to enjoy its complex aroma. A possible food pairing would be with a roasted game and root veggie dinner, something rich and hearty."
""
""
""
"Worth another try."

"I was anxious (eager?) to get started so I went with a very heavy-handed pour from the outset. This resulted in a pseudo-cascade which netted me two fingers of dense, light-tan head that slowly fell, leaving brilliant lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) with an enviable button-brightness. Nose smelled strongly of oak, rum, smoke, and sweet malt. Phew! I remember smoking cigars that smelled like this. Mouthfeel was medium and, man, was it sweet. It was a bit much for me, as a self-avowed hophead, but I liked the way that the beer commingled with the oak and rum to create a very evocative taste. Finish remained wildly sweet, so much so that one of these would be plenty for me. I am keeping an open mind as I open some of my other bottles from this brand."
""
"Tasty, I will get it again."
"I got this beer for Christmas and it has slowly become my favorite beer. Very tasty and smooth with a bit of oakiness. It reminds me of a really good whisky. When you smell it, it'll make your mouth water. It's really hard to find in stores but it can be ordered online. Shipping is expensive but it's worth it!"
""
"OVerall - I always bypassed this beer due to the clear bottles. I was pleasantly surprised as it was a very flavorful beer (both in smell and taste). It was very drinkable as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant beer. Enjoyable, but not necessarily something I would search out again."
""
""
"O: the bottle says serve at 4 -6 C - fuck that.... let this warm up like any other fine British ale to ""unlock the flavour"".... once again, this is quite similar to the tasty original though, surprisingly less explosive of a taste"
""
""
""
""
"Little head is formed on the pour, and what is created fizzes away in a short time. The color below is crimson with red hues. Its aroma is sweet, likened to rum. There's a fun toasted banana's foster note too, giving me the impression of a banana's foster. The fun parades into the taste, where an overall mellow flavor is impressive. The notes of oak chips, a clear rum flavor, soft nuttiness, a kiss of toasted malt, all pleasing notes to my palate. Paired with a lighter medium sized body with gentle carbonation, the Run Cask version is just as worth a purchase as the Original Innis and Gunn."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" This is part of a unique cask-aged style three pack that came with a glass in a box for $5.99."
""
""
"Basically a decent beer, not outstanding, not horrible. The rum aging adds some interesting flavor notes, although I would have rated it higher if it had a little more flavor and complexity. Worth a try, just because it is a bit different."
""
""
""
""
"Love a good oak aged beer and this doesn't disappoint. tasty and flavoursome and easy to drink. A great beer to have at the end of a night."
""
""
""
"Cheers!!"
""
"O- Innis and Gunn may not be the best beer you ever have, but they are always tasty, complex, and certainly interesting."
"Price Point - $3/12 oz bottle"
"Overall a tasty yet subtle beer. The use of rum barrels to age the beer works well here."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty nice beer ruined by skunking. The clear bottles look really nice, but they do absolutely nothing for preserving the quality of a beer. I really hope these guys switch to brown bottles someday."
""
""
"Pours a tawny copper brown color with faint garnet at the edges, smallish off white head slowly dissipates before leaving spotty lace on the way down. Aromas of toffee, brown sugar and molasses make up the bulk of the nose. Light spice, earth, and dark fruit round out the nose. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor follows the aroma, sweet sugary malt beverage with light fruit and rum beep in the background. Little to no hop bitterness or flavor. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Like the last one, there is nothing ""wrong"" with this beer, it is just really boring, and a bit too sweet for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Poured draft into a very cold pint mug. A bubbly head dissolves quickly. Appearance is medium gold, a bit lighter than honey-colored. The aroma is subdued, maybe because of the cold mug. I bet they drink this at room temperature on Great Britian. I only detect s mild aroma of hops and malt. Flavor is balanced but also subdued, first the carbonation, then hops, malt, and buttery togfee. Brentk56's description below is better than mine, and I agree with him. Mouthfeel is medium-light after the initial carbonation. Overall this is interesting, but it does not grab my attention or my passion. I'm glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent example of the benefits of pairing a rum barrel with the Wee Heavy style"
"Overall - Not quite as good as I remember it being as the richness I recall wasn't there this time around. Also while the rum finish does put a twist on the standard I&G, I don't think it makes it any better, but rather a bit worse. I'm thinking this one may have seen too much light. Nonetheless this is a fine beer that I will enjoy again at some point in the future."
""
""
""
"Best in an Imperial pint glass( I switched glasses mid- tasting) and colder- 40-42F."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not to be redundant but WTF? It doesn't even taste like a beer. Perhaps an acquired taste?? Sweet, sparkling, cider? WTF? It's just wrong. Sorry Innis. All that Oak Aging gone to waste. Not for me, although I know some must appreciate you."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice dessert beer with a good amount of sweetness balanced by the oak and fruitiness. A solid example of using spirit-soaked oak chips to add a nice depth and complexity to a beer. Can't complain about price, either"
""
"Copper amber body with a light tan head fizzy carbonation dwindles quick with scant amounts of lacing, the aroma is upfront with a sweet sugar cane rum and mild oak notes. Pretty pleasant smelling stuff, I'm engaged let's take the first sip. A bit sweet but very enjoyable limited heat from the rum, which is a good thing. The oak chips soaked in rum added to a nice base Scotch ale is great concept, definitely solid and enjoyable. Flavors are straight forward hints of vanilla oak, caramelized sugars with a soothing hint of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no cloying or over done qualities, carbonation is rather light but appropriate for this beer. Overall I would drink this again, a solid offering that any liquor or beer drinker will enjoy. This could be a perfect cigar beer, next time I will try that pairing."

"My first Innis & Gunn beer.Poured a rich clear amber with a one finger light tannish colored head atop that was gone pretty quickly.Aromas of rum infused butter,brown sugar,and some cake notes.Very buttery on the palate with the rum flavors not hitting me over the head like I thought they would,caramel and vanilla notes imparted from the rum in the finish.Not bad,to be honest better than I thought,I would have liked a fuller feel but the flavors are nice."

"O- I don't like scotch ales... I did review this to the best of my (limited) ability"
""
"This is a nice wee heavy though not as full flavored or full bodied as I would like. The flavors that are present are definitely pleasant, balanced, and enjoyable. I think I would have this beer again."
""
"This is a good beer. Nothing too special to my taste other than the flavors from the barrel. I could stand to drink it again but I doubt I would buy it. Definitely worth a try if you're into liquor though."
"Very sweet aroma, fairly sweet and complex flavor, with enough savory character to reign it in from being overwhelmingly cloying. Very complex, but a little too sweet to have more than one."
""
"O - Really delicious beer, this brewery knows how to use their wood. A treat."
""
""
"Pours a dark red and brown with a nice reddish white hue head. The smell is slightly better than ok. Not overpowering on any level or better said sort of a duller smell for a rum oak beer. The taste is dreamt sweet oak taste. The rum hides in the background, probably the sweet taste impn the oak. The nice part is the oak isn't too crazy like many oak beers can be. The mouthfeel is nice too with a smooth creamy feel. The only knock would be is on the flatter side. Kind of feels like the beer has been sitting around too long. Overall, I'm on an Innis and Gunn kick. This is another very well put together beer. I guess they are perfecting barrel aging process."
""
""
"Medium bodied and slightly watery on the finish. The sweetness in the malt is offset by the bitterness which takes priority."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brownish ruby red with a medium slowly dissipating off white head. Aroma is of sweet rum, caramel malt with a bit of sweet alcohol esters. Taste is sweet rum flavor and alcohol, brown sugar, toffee and caramel. Palate is a medium to full body, smooth and sweet mouth feel, with moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel, rum barrel flavor, brown sugar, toffee and some dry sweet alcohol ending. Overall a bit on the sweet side by a good flavorful and enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"A smooth beer with not a lot else going for it. A friend of mine loves it, so I gave it a shot, not for me. It smells and tastes overly malty, not very bitter at all. Just, not great. It sort of tasted stale, or flat. I had it once more to make sure it was not just a bad bottle or something, it was not. Not recomended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very drinkable but has much more of the wee than the heavy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o; A favorite taste treat. Stiff competition from Founders Backwoods Bastard and one or two other cask aged brews, but still an affordable year-round imbiber's confection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste has the same oakiness, brown sugar, and rum flavors, but doesn't over power the scotch ale base. Complex, with new flavors in every sip. Malt base is bready, minimal hops. Alcohol warms going down, yet still smooth. I have enjoyed most Innis & Gunn, but this may be the favorite so far."
""
""
"Overall, I am pretty impressed with this beer. Once the skunky nose subsided this beer opened up and it was great. It is definitely softer and more mellow than American craft Scotch Ales, and barrel aged ales in general, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and hope to drink it again in the future."
""
""
"Very pleasing taste, smooth, multiple flavors coming through, unique touch of oak from the aging process. Well balanced with a long finish. Now one of my favorite beers."
""
""
"Overall, have this on a winter's night. It'll get you closer to the hearth without burning your bum."
"My favorite beer so I am biased... I'm sorry... I've tried a few other wee heavys but this one takes the cake with no competition in sight.... I'm not saying theres not a better wee heavy/beer out there but rum cask is exceptional... Other wee heavy's I've had, had a bit more umph to it. Rum cask is smooth.. which is amazing being it's aged in casks. To me the cask beers usually are the ones with the umph. I don't have the greatest sense of smell but the smell was good... great carbonation which made a two finger head that stayed very long with sticky lacing. Very complex mouthier but again very smooth and layered perfectly. I really can't taste too much alcohol burn, barely taste that it's there but it is in the nose. It also may be more subtle because I like to drink it a tad colder than the recommended wee heavy temp.... still tatstes great at its temp. Love the Rum beers and this is one of the best..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Surprisingly light, although I've had the original and it's similar in body. Very little carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure why this beer gets so much hate on this site. For the price, it is hard to find a more complex yet well balanced beer that has been barrel aged. Malty, soft notes of vanilla and rum blended together very well make this beer one of my favorites and also a must try."
""
"Overall: Some good things going on, but I'd like to see the flavor profile developed a little more."
""
"Wonderful beer, no nasty aftertaste, just dark enough ale for a stout drinker, lovely aroma, very smooth. Now on my top of the heap ale list. The Seacoast area of New Hampshire is becoming a ""beer destination"". Many new micro breweries and I actually get a great selection at the supermarket. This bottle was from a Market Basket and they were 3 for $12. I am visiting Edinburgh in two weeks and I can't wait to have this on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some woody aromas. There is also a slight metallic aroma that comes out more as the beer warms. Taste is much the same with rum, vanilla, and woody flavors on the finish. There is a caramel sweetness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the rum presence is only coming through in the taste and even then it's pretty subdued."
"the taste has a fullness to it, with the fruit and toffee, and a small bitterness at the end. there is a smokiness which i am not fond of, however."
""
"Some minor dings: clear bottle (though no hint of skunkiness here) and an odd suggestion on the bottle to serve at 4-6 celcius (that's way too cold and hides the complexities of this beer)."
""
""
""
"Nice rocky head that leaves some lace here and there. Very clear light mahogany color. All the right smells with dark molasses, toffee, and rum personality. Taste is smooth and malty with an oaked rum over the whole thing. Vanilla and mild cherry merge with rum and dark sugar and roasted grains. Thickish weight and feel with a delightful, smooth and mild carbonation. An excellent brew that in spite of the elevated abv lends itself to session drinking at a slightly slower pace"
""
""
""
""
"The rum cask Innis & Gunn is definitely my favorite among the regularly available offerings and is a great after-dinner beer."
""
""
"Overall, I am going to consider this beer world class. I think that it would be. I have had only a few, but I could see this as something for a brewer to aspire to or learn from. 4 out of 5 would be on the low side, I may have to give this more."
""
""
""
"Overall – It's highly drinkable and while it doesn't pack a punch, it has enough flavour to keep it interesting. I can see this working well as a gateway beer to get others away from Macro's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Again, a great beer by these guys."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is pretty well refined considering that this beer has the potential to swing to one of at least two unpleasant extremes: cloying and sticky or overly thinned. As such, the body is just a touch light, but the smoothness makes for pleasant drinking and there's a nice bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an interesting and enjoyable brew. I loved the way the booze, toffee, caramel and oak all were evident but tied together well. I was also impressed on how quaffable this was. At 7.4% one might consider it a sipper, but because of the body and impressive taste, two would be justified."
"Overall I do enjoy this beer being partial to both rum and barrel aged beers. I can see how the sweetness could be a little much for some."
""

"Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a deep red, almost maroon, with a small white head that leaves little lacing. The fizzy malty rum aroma dominates, but it is not surprising at all by the description. Tastes of fizzy rum with nice dark malt base. Beer is highly carbonated, light/medium bodied beer goes down smooth. Overall a very good beer."

"This is a very nice scotch ale. Definitely a sipper. Finishing off my Innis & Gunn holiday gift pack, this was definitely the stand out of the bunch."

""
""
""
"I bought a case of this awhile back I really enjoyed it, It had a vanilla note to it and was an enjoyable sipping beer, I liked it on the cooler side 40F, but it was not bad once it warmed it up either. I still have a bottle or 2 tucked away, but so far I havent found a reason to drink them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Its decent, but not worth the money. Id enjoy this more if id never have traquir backwoods bastard. Too mild on the flavors, kind of like a starter wee heavy. Not a fan of any innis beers so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Come on Guys... This stuff is Amazing!!!! Smooth drinkable. Not anything like a typical Scotch Ale. This is sooo... Drinkable it sucks its $12.99 a 4 Pack.Even there regular brew one is awesome!!!! But all Beers are NOT creteated Equal!! One of my all time favorites. Another Must Try!!!"
""
"Overall this ale is a combination of whiskey and ale. Given my Scottish roots maybe this ale hit my drunken funny bone. But, this is a fine and top notch ale!!! Just give it a try"
""
"O- Still certainly lightstruck and a little oxidized but this one (and the other two in the pack) were actually drinkable and didn't result in a drainpour. I'm gonna consolidate the scores from the two bottles (first one got an even 2, second one got an even 3) and give it a 2.5. Obviously these guys have serious quality control issues. They really need to start considering shelling out the extra capital to invest in colored bottles. At least go for green glass if not brown, guys...."
"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Dark bronze colour, hint of red, clear, no head, minimal lacing. Aroma was bourbon and not much else. Tasted oak, rum, bourbon and a hint of vanila. Finish was long and boozy, eventhough the beer didn't taste too boozy. Mouthfull was smooth but texture was slightly thick and sticky, no carbonation. Overall a decent beer but I can't understand Barrel aging a beer and putting it in a clear glass bottle."
""
""
""
"Reviewed from notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body may be just a bit light, but carbonation is adequate. Alcohol is felt slightly, but adds to the sipping character. Very nice beer."
"Such a tasty brew. Unique, tasty and complex and an easy drinker. Up there with the other I & G versions. Try them all."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: For fans of rum and unique beer alike, this is a must try. An unassuming scotch ale with a nice kick of sweet rum barrel flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good scotch ale, less rich than some of the other ones I've had which makes it a bit easier going down. Good flavor, a little different from others I've had in that department as well. Like this, looking forward to trying more from these brewers."

"Taste is caramelised dried fruit and wood, a lot of candied and dried cherry, spicy raisiny warmth. it is a little sweeter, fuller, and more characterful than the Winter Beer 2011."
""
"Smooth and malty brew, more sweet, caramel malts and again cola and just perhaps some wood/rum cask. Decent enough brew, but not really doing much for my senses. Worth a try, but ultimately this seems to be over priced and underwhelming."
""
""
"A dark, mahogany pour with reddish edges and a lightly tan head. The aroma has sugary caramel, oak, and some earthy notes. The medium body has a slightly sticky texture with soft carbonation. It has a sweet taste with rum flavor and slight warmth in the finish."
""
""
"Overall, this is a different type of ""beer"".... Decent, but, in my eyes, not as good as the original oak aged brew from Innus & Gunn even though it is stronger."

"Not a big fan of the Innis and Gunn beers. Seem kind of mellow to me, and a bit bland. All of the beer flavors (malt and hops) were very muted."
"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting. Not an amazing scotch ale, just simply interesting. I'm on the fence about having another one. I think I wouldn't mind a proper full pint of this rather than 11.2oz, but I also don't think I would buy it again. Definitely worth a try though to see how a beer aged in a Rum cask turns out."
""
"All in all a clean drink. Smooth and has a nice kick of abv"
"BUY THIS BEER !!!"
"It tastes too much like rum and not enough like beer. If you like rum this is a beer you should definately try. It's not something I would drink again."

"glassware: Innis and Gunn...occasion: Shark Tank retruns to TV!...aroma: rummy, for certain, with its trademark I&G whisky maltiness... intriguing as with all their brews...appearance:cognac-bodied, thinly headed with an unassuming white rim...palate: thick, soda-like fizzy body that has a syrup drip...taste: definitely vanilla and fruity esters combine wth an aggressive, bold strength...overall: a challenging brew that doesn't quiet have the spive that the bottle proclaims; it is noticeably alcoholic in its exhale"

"O: This beer is far superior to Innis & Gunn's Original. The Rum Cask is a big, drinkable brew."
""

"one of the more interesting beers this year and a very nice change of pace. would get again."

"Overall, not a bad brew for a few bucks and on a whim. I'd definitely try it again."
""
""
"Pours a clean deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, small alcohol notes, rum, and a small oak presence. In the taste, a sweet malt, and a small presence of rum and alcohol. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry note of dark rum in the aftertaste. A bit sweeter in the wood than bourbon/ whiskey, but nice, nonetheless."

"This is a big heavy beer. However, it remains really interesting. The sweetness and syrupiness are a bit too pronounced I find, but the do succeed in bringing some dark fruit and spice character to this beer. One to seek out and experience."
"O - Not bad but not something that I would grab for."
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and it was a pretty good example of a barrel aged ale, it had good balance which made it good pretty smooth, but I wish the flavors were a little bolder, I wouldn't mind sacrificing a little bit of drinkability. This beer had great drinkability, I wasn't expecting it to go down smooth and quickly, the flavor held my attention and I would mind drinking more then a couple of these by the campfire. What I like most about this beer was the great mouthfeel and the great balance this beer had, that's what made this beer above average. What I liked least about this beer was that the rum wasn't as bold as I would like and it was a little too sweet, if those were worked on this would be a very good beer. I would buy this beer again when looking for an affordable and good barrel aged beer, I can see getting this often and I recommend giving this beer a try if barrel aged beers are your thing. This was my first rum barrel aged beer and my first beer from this brewery and I have to say that I was impressed and I'm interesting in checking more of there different beers out, good job guys, you can bet I will be a repeat customer."
"Overall: a good beer but the rum is understated more than I would like."
"This beer is very unusual. It has a rich amber appearance with little head and very light carbonation, making for a smooth and refreshing drink. It has a nice aroma of oak and rum, blended with a spicy and hoppy ale -- the flavor is the same. You can taste the rum, but peppery spice is my favorite part of this beer. This and the alcohol content makes this a perfect sipping beer, best served after a meal or paired with a cigar or pipe. This is not one that I would drink more than a glass or two in a sitting ~ because of the bold and rich flavor, not alcohol content."

"Rich. One bottle is plenty as even though it's not a huge beer, it's quite sweet. This is my favorite of the 3 I've had (The Oak aged, the Irish Whisky cask and this) so far."
""
""
"clear deep red in color with 2 fingers of head which quickly diminished. smells of vanilla, rum, wood, plum, grapes. very sweet vanilla flavor with a wood backbone. definitely taste the rum cask aging. aside from that, there is a fruity taste leaning towards apples. medium bodied with mild carbonation, barely any lacing. overall this is a very tasty dessert beer. very sweet, very rich, however i do wish it was a bit heavier in the mouthfeel (maybe a bit of creaminess)."
"Worth trying if you can't stand the sweetness of the regular version."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a clear 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with ruby highlight and a 1 inch head. Smell is of rum, alcohol. Taste is also rum up front, oak. alcohol, a touch of malts, different and unique. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is not a bad beer, a little unusual for me and I can't really get in to it."
""
""
"O - I was so hopped up to try this beer a Scottish ale in rum cask why wouldn't this be good! When i had it i was slightly disappointed .The beers rum notes are almost not there they tease you in the back round. There oak flavor saves this beer and is steady and is there through out the hole tasting proses . Nice bit of alcohol warmth on the back end . All and all this beer is really good not great but pretty damn good ."
""
""
"I'm leaning toward the Rum Cask version, but after trying two Innis & Gunn specialties, I'm growing a little exhausted of the brewery. Not to cut them short, I mean this is what they do, but I certainly get the schtick. I don't know if I would call this a prime example of a wee heavy, but I'll take it now and have another again sometime down the road. 4.0"
""
" Then second.and so on..."
"O: Pretty amazing for something rather easy to access (at least in my area), fragrant and smooth"
"O- Decent and different. The rum aspect of this is evident but I don't think they got the balance of it right. There are a lot of other good casked beers out there in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Similar to Innis & Gunn Original, this beer is darker in color and has a roasted flavor. Slightly higher in alcohol at 7.4% ABV, this beer hides it really well. Full mouth feel and strong flavors make this a great stand alone beer or enjoy with a cigar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I want to drink this beer after I smoke a cigar. Delicious beer."
"Overall- I really want to love this beer, but I can't. But I can't hate it, either. It seems to me that the balance is off. The rum flavor, sweetness and alcohol begin to dominate soon after the pour. If the ABV was lower I could see this being a very interesting session beer. But unlike most brews I enjoy, this becomes less complex as it warms. Certainly give it a try- I've never had anything like it. 3/5 for me. It's making me crave a 90 Shilling Ale from my favorite brewpub."
"Okay, not bad but the whole thing sounds better than it tastes."
""
""
"D - Not bad, but the rum character is a bit disappointment. The dark sugars of the base beer work nicely with the oak, but there really isn't much in the way of rum specific character. Kind of a let down overall."
"Wonderful drink. The rum cask did an awesome job with the beer."
""
""
""
"O- Not sure how long this is ""cask"" aged. Possibly 1 day?"
""
"If this was a heavier brew, more full bodied it would rate much higher here. No roasted notes, no smokiness. The disconnect between the style and the sweetness and body are a little hard to overlook. A for effort but B- for execution."
"Overall I've been impressed by Innes and Gunn and will be looking to try some of their other offerings."
""
""
""
""
"Medium texture in the mouthfeel and only a slight note of the alcohol. Overall, for my first rum-barrel aged brew, I'm decently impressed with the flavors and would recommend this brew."
""
"Overall- 9.5 out of 10! I'll be looking for this to bring home! A beer very well thought out!"
"Mouthfeel is syrupy but with the proper carbonation to make it highly quaffable. Of course its not a beer you'll tear through but it's not disgustingly thick. Good stuff."
"O - I had previously called this one of the best beers around. Time has changed me a bit. Still, it's a lovely tasting beer for sipping, and I admire a great deal about it. Grab a bottle and hang out on the deck this spring."

"Innis & Gunn presents its nicely colored beers in pretty packaging but doesn't seem to pay much attention to what's inside the bottle-- at least, that's what I've consistently found. This one is right in line with the others I've tried: gorgeous color but weak aroma; rather flat body and bland taste. I detected some buttery oak in the flavor but there wasn't much in the way of scotch ale-- for me, this was just too light and thin. The Kool-Aid aftertaste was, I suppose, the rum part. Pass."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is crystal clear, vibrant, ruby-copper coloring with a thin, foamy, light beige head. Aromas are roasted and woody, with dark fruit spices and floral notes. The nose is dark and subtle. Flavors are sweet, with a candied sugar initial taste, followed by some subtle oak and brown sugar characteristics, I'm assuming from the rum barrels. I mean, I'm sure it's not just a clever name. Roasty and currant fruit undertones keep the sweetness from being overpowering. The body is somewhat light, but smooth overall. The aftertaste is syrupy sweet, and imparted with oaky characteristics, it almost has a maple syrup like profile (only oak, because it's not a maple barrel). The finish has a slight linger that slowly shrinks away, leaving a semisweet touch on the palate. Not bad, but I'm not blown away."
"I had had one oak aged beer from I&G before, and I recall being underwhelmed. Not this time. This is a solid beer. It looks and smells great, tastes and feels good, has excellent balance and good complexity. Totally worth a try. I wish I had more! I am pleasantly surprised."
"Again, a noble attempt to add character to ordinary ales. May I suggest they use brown glass next time?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am quite happy with this beer. The rum is not too overpowering and the sweetness is held in check. An excellent sipper that I would love to have again."
""
""
"It pours out a nice ruby-brown color with a small head. The aroma is very complex. The alcohol comes out and says hello first, but deep wiffs gets oak, dark fruits, sweet malts, vanilla, toffee, and a bit of spices. A bit too strong on the alcohol on the nose, but otherwise very nice. The taste reverses the sensation from the nose, with some sweet malts, dark fruits and vanilla coming first. Then the oak, rum spices, and a touch of bitterness come roaring in, finishing with a bit more of the sweetness. It's a sipper, but one that you'll really enjoy over the course of an hour as it warms up."
""
"Mouthfeel: smooth and drinkable. The oak isn't too over powering and the complexity goes on for days."
""
""
""
"Working my way through the I&G offerings at hand. Good times thus far... This stuff pours a clear rusty brown topped by a minimal amount of off-cream-white foam. The nose is dizzominated by a blast of buttercream and caramel. There might be a bit of marshmallow and oak in there, too, but they're drowned out by the big boys in the room. The taste holds notes of vanilla, cinnamon, buttercream, toffee, rum spice, very light oak, and light ginger. This stuff is very complex, each flavor inhabiting its own layer and its own wave across the tongue. Nice. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine beer, no surprise from the I&G crew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice pairing with a plate of spicy shrimp fried rice, which did not overpower the depth of flavor in this visually deceptive brew."
"This is a solid beverage with good character. Super smooth goodness with a nice ABV that treats your gut like soul food would; comfortable and pleasing. Couldn't drink a ton of it at one sitting but had plenty of space for two before calling it a night."
""
"Ah loch thes swally a lot, slainte!"
""
"O-- It drinks pretty light overall, especially for its ABV, it tastes decent and I did enjoy it. But it is not worth its price, in my opinion. I like the original I&G better."
""
""
"Strong aroma is rather sweet and has a definite overtone of rum-soaked wood, as well as caramel and malty notes. It pours a beautiful clear mahogany with a fairly thick and fluffy pale tan head. Sublime flavor has tones of rum, caramel, malt and wood, and is rather sweet but not cloying. Full-bodied, syrupy texture has just a little fizz, though. A truly satisfying beer to be sipped and savored."
""
""
"From the 25 ouncer. The packaging is beautiful. Sampled on January 13, 2012. The pour is dark amber with a long-lasting, foamy, off-white head. The aroma is sweeter than you might think with a nice supply of malts, brown sugar, and a small note of rum. The body is medium to heavy. After aging in rum barrels you would think the taste might come across as boozy but this is hardly the case. It is very sweet and caramel-like, with toffee and a moderate hop bitterness on the tail end. Well recommended."
""
""
"Sidenote: I have a policy not to buy beer in clear bottles. A friend gave me this after he tried it and said it tasted like shit. I don't agree; I think there's worthwhile beer here, but it's destroyed by the brewery's dumb choice."
"D: Delicious and a product I would certainly drink again. Best characteristic of this is the detectable rum taste."
"O: There's a lot going on here, it's worth a shot if you find a single of it. I wouldn't buy a 4 pack, but it's good enough to buy once."
"Nice use of oak with a solid ale. The rum part is mild- which is fine. This is certainly worth trying if you are a fan of oak-aged beer with a twist of rum!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a clean looking brownish amber color with a thick creamy looking head on top. The smell of the beer was sweet on the nose, lots of earthy grains and vanilla. There was a little bit of the rum spice in there too but not much. The taste of this brew compared to the other Oak Aged Ale by Innis & Gunn to me was much nicer here. The flavors were still pretty intense but in a more balanced manner here. The rum flavors kind of die off midway through the bottle leaving you with a sweet dry flavor in your mouth. The mouthfeel of the beer was medium bodied and smooth. Overall it's a decent brew, I don't see myself drinking a lot of them but either way still pretty good."
""
""
"Just not my style, I suppose."
""
""
""
""
"O – One of my first Scottish Ales, the Rum Cask touch was nice and something I'm not normally used to or have seen. Smooth and not too heavy, I could have a few more of these."
"This is a decent little sipper, but the rum doesn't do enough for me. I prefer the regular oaked version."
""
"(O) Quite tasty. Really enjoyed this one. Great for a cold night around the holidays. Well balanced and really good."
"Overall this beer is a disappointment for me. The barrel aging didn't do much to affect the flavor add little oak and hardly any rum. The ABV is nicely masked but it's just kind of boring. I'm glad I found a smaller bottle so I didn't have to dump the majority of a bomber."
""
""
"Overall, I was a pit disappointed with this one. The complexity lacks in comparison to similar aged beers from the US. It's a drinkable beer...just nothing special."
""
"Overall - One great beer. A great blend of sweetness with the rum flavor. One I would definitely recommend"
""
"O – Damn fine brew here. Has great flavors which all compliment one another. Adding to my list to pick up more. Great on a cold night. Winner all the way."
""
""
"This was a really nice beer, perfect with breads/pastas."
""
"Pours a one-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Opaque brown color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light rum and oak nose and flavor is toffee and vanilla with a sweet rum finish. $10.99 for a 750ml bottle from Pamplemousse Salem, Ma."
""
"Overall, this is a good beer to have every once in a while. If drank too often, this could become rather ordinary."
""
""
"Definitely worth a try!"
"quite nice of a beer."
""
"Overall: a nicely flavored beer that drinks fairly quickly for the style. The rum barrels did not impart that much flavor but it is interesting. Worth trying this one."
""
""
""
""
"O - A different beer, nice and tasteful. A little les sweetness would have helped."
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is decent, but not great. I feel he alcohol overpowers the rest of the beer, but I do enjoy the rum flavor and as usual, the oak tastes and aromas."
"O: Overall spicy and dry with oak barrel notes and a warmth of dry rum alcohol. The alcohol seems a bit forefront at times, but there is enough complexity that comes through to make things interesting. Moderate drinkability."
""
""
""
"O - I honestly do not understand the above-average scores from others for this beer. I've already had a superlative rum barrel-aged scotch ale this month -- CCB BA Big Sound. This beer bears no resemblance to that one. It barely tastes like a wee heavy, and I have no idea why they bother putting the ""rum barrel"" information on the label. Not worth the time, the money, or the calories. Down the drain it goes..."
""
"D= Off the charts. I really enjoyed this and will be seeking it out again for sure!"
""
""
"never had a rum casked beer before. poured a dark amber maple syrup color with a quarter inch cream head that lasted about 30 seconds. smelled like a manly version of a tropical drink, definitely attributable to the rum. i tasted no beer in at all though, like a watered down liquor drink, it was hard to call this a beer for me, with almost none of the requisite ingredients identifiable in the palate. still though, a pretty nice unique flavor, very woody and a little sweet, dried fruits, molasses. not bad. overall the mouthfeel could have made this beer, but it broke it instead. almost entirely flat, and losing much of its most redeeming characteristics as it warmed. i did not dislike this brew, but it missed the mark for me. extra points for doing something original though, and worth a try for the wood beer freak"
""
"salud!"
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty, and a big improvement (imo) over their standard oak aged beer. As a big fan of rum this brew really hits the spot. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the style."
""
"O - A really flavorful beer, but it is unbalanced by it's high sweetness."
""
"Had a bottle of this with my meal at Berta's in Wanaque, NJ. Poured a reddish mahogany, with a beige head, one finger; average retention and lacing. The nose revealed large caramel, apple, pear, cherry, oak, vanilla, and maple syrup notes. I must say, that after reading some reviews, I was bracing myself to be underwhelmed, but I was in fact impressed. Then the taste..very similar to the nose, but a little on the sweet maple side midpalate, dissolving to a sweet cherry/maple syrup finish punctuated by some alcohol hints. Medium bodied, and almost no carbonation; slick, viscous feel. Despite the sweetness and the viscosity, I actually found this beer to be pleasantly drinkable. Paired very nicely with my cream tart dessert!"
""
"Overall a reasonably good beer, but for 60 SEK per liter I am not sure at all whether I would care for this again."
""
""
""
"This one is a unique beer and rather tasty, if a bit sweet and one-dimensional. I wish there was more malt complexity in the flavor. But it's got to be one of the better beers you'll find in a clear bottle."

"Like I said, of the two Gunns offered on the regular here in TN, I'd much rather drink this Rum Aged version. A bit bigger alcohol suggests a more robust maltiness which was a great improvement along side the drier, spicier flavors."
"12 oz into a snifter...even though I don't love this beer, I tried to give it decent marks for uniqueness. Seems a little light in color for a wee heavy, although I guess the brewery is located in Scotland, so maybe I should stfu and all the other wee heavies I've ever had were too dark. Head doesn't stick around too long. There's tons of rum notes in the nose, as well as oak. Ditto on the tongue. It delivers as promised in that respect. Mouthfeel is quite good. Not something I'll drink again for awhile, but I recommend trying it."
"Unique, but I'd love to try a Scottish Ale more deserving that has been put through the cask treatment. Not as rich or robust as I would like to for a Wee Heavy"
"Drinkability/overall- overall this beer is very nice and enjoyable in a similar kind of way as the regular innis and gun beer is, nice mellow some what sweet oaky ale, while i really do like this style of beer they make i cant say I was getting as much of the rum as I thought that I might, good beer for sure but not sure i like it more then the regular beer of theres which is few bucks cheaper"
"It's good that I got this in a mix pack, given that it would be hard to down more than one in a sitting. That's not because this beer turned me off, but because it's more like a cordial or something that should be poured into a snifter or rocks glass. Like the other Innis and Gunn offering that I've had so far, this certainly pushed the boundary of what I think a beer is and even if not everyone enjoys the end results, this is much more likely to stand out for me over time. This was a solid effort at pushing the envelope!"
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear copper/garnet color with one finger of tan head. The retention was nice and the lacing in small bands. The aroma was of caramel, toffee, oak, booze, vanilla and dark fruits. The flavors were similar with the oak being strong but behind that were lots of subtleties of rum, tobacco ,toffee, butterscotch, molasses and nuts. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation average. Complex and nuanced despite being strong. A great example of the of a Wee Heavy."
"cheers"
"I was expecting more rum. Captain Morgan, himself a Scot, would be ashamed."
"-Overall 4.0: Excellent beer. I very rarely give a ""5," but this beer deserved it in the taste category. I would highly recommend it on taste alone. The other categories drag it down a bit, but it is worth the money you'll spend on it. A work of art."
"Overall, a good beer. Very interesting flavors are present here, the combo of a Scotch ale and being aged in a rum cask is delicious."
"Overall a very good beer, although not as interesting as the original Innis & Gunn version."
"It was a nice taster but I couldn't drink a lot of this. A bit too malty, but I like it much better than the regular oaked stuff."
"O-I'm liking this one a lot more than the non rum version. it seems to be better cleaned up with more balance. it still does have a slight bit of roughness towards the end that keeps this from being an all night drinker, but its definitely a good treat every once in awhile."
"Taste is fine with rum in the palate but not too much."
"O/D-I like this one less that Innis & Gunn's Original Oak Ale. The rum doesn't come out as well as the oak does in the Original. Still a cool beer, but too muted. I don't even know if I would enjoy this beer more if it was more intense. Rum cask aged beer just sounds a little off."
"O - recommended for fans of rum and oak aged beers."
"Overall (3) - Less than impressive appearance, but a lovely aroma that compliments the taste. Touches on the Scotch Ale style nicely with the woody and alcoholic undertones."
"American oak and rum-infused oak chips, we presume? Regardless, we’ll take this beer on. Dark ruddy brown color glim- mers with its clarity. Soft but pungent aroma; oaky, musty, hint of spice and alcohol, cigar, brown bread and ripe baked apples. Oakiness has some pull on the palate but lets the beer be a beer. Brown sugar and rum notes are mild, but are certainly complex layers. Maltiness is slightly dry and bready; modest hopping here. Some warmth from the alcohol. A very savory beer, perhaps a bite refined, but that factor does not affect the depth of its complexities. Seek this one out."
"O: A tasty and easy drinking Scotch Ale that is a little rough around the edges in terms of its lack of carbonation."
"O: It's an ok beer. Easy to drink, except for the excessive sweetness, which I didn't particularly like."
"I'm relieved this clear bottle was more or less devoid of skunkiness, unlike other I&G I've had. This had an interesting/complex profile, but the flavours failed to mesh just right for me... had trouble finishing my glass for some reason. Still, interesting for those that enjoy a good rum."
"It's an interesting beer with a good deal of complexity while still remaining very drinkable. It's far from overdone, and in fact it's quite balanced and polished. This could easily be a session ale apart from its strength and the fact that its nuances would be lost after the second glass. Quite nice!"
"Overall: Revisiting the brand I logged my first review for. Awesome wood and tobacco combo. Could have several of these. This tastes different from most other beers I have had, so I am loving it."
"Overall, there are many good flavors in this beer, but I can't quite get past the rum-and-cola resemblance to focus on the fact that this is a beer. A stronger and more flavorful pre-cask-aging beer would have helped in this respect, giving the flavors a bit more strength in their own right. Despite this, the beer is indeed enjoyable, and quite refreshing and clean in its flavor profile. Worth trying."
"This was a good beer. I love how everything goes together nicely."
"O- extremely original, and I think this is a very underrated beer. Just awesome."
"o: this is definitely a great beer, and tonight I was lucky to get the 750ml for $5 so no complaints! I still enjoy the original more, cheers!"
"Overall, I prefer this to the original Innis and Gunn. It is a lot smoother. It's got pretty good drinkability for a beer with such rich flavours. At the same time, it lacks the intensity that could make it a really great beer."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Anemic carbonation, big flavours, and high abv make this a difficult session beer. It'd be nice up against a hearty stew on a cold winter night. I'll review this again in 4 months..."
"O: The beer is rather easy to drink compared to others in the style and although flavors of oak and rum stand out from the barrel aging they are not overly strong."
"O: I must have received a fresh bottle because I rather enjoyed this one versus the regular one. Nice flavor and the ABV is hidden well making it very drinkable for me. Would get it again to see if I still like it or if my bottles were a fluke."
"Overall: pleasantly surprised."
"D: When I first smelled this beer, I almost poured it because of the skunked smell. But it turns out that this is isn't a half bad beer. The flavor is pretty tasty and what you'd expect from rum barrels."
"I think this is my favourite of the three, and frankly I am a little surprised because I'm not typically a big fan of higher ABV beers (and I don't really like rum that much, either). But it all comes together somehow - I found this to be an enjoyable sipper. Something I will probably pick up again, but more likely in the winter. Certainly worth a try if you're a fan of other I&G offerings."
"O- This one was more like cream soda than beer."
"It gets better as it warms and all the flavors mingle and mix."
"A great beer, really great beer."
"Poured a 1.5"" linen colored head. Body is a lovely clear deep ruby color. Smell is mildly skunked but at least less so than their last Oak Aged Beer I tried. (Why not abandon clear glass bottles?). Taste has some toffee and raisin and a sugared richness from the rum barreling. But the weight is still pretty light, less than I'd expect from barrel aging. It's an interesting beer but I still get the impression they've taken a pretty mediocre beer, absorbed just a tad of the barrel qualities, and then marketed it in clear fancy bottles to show off more the look and concept of the beer than to have the best possible product."
"O - I definitely enjoy the experimentation with different spirit casks and the sweet and smokiness of the rum and barrel works well, nothing mind blowing but a solid offering"
"This beer is alright, but not special. I first had this at a beer tasting festival and in 2 oz tasters is kind of stole the show but a whole beer of it is just about too much."
"I know I liked their other Ale that was not in um casks. It was a bit more crisp."
"O - It said on the bottle it is oak barrel aged like no other. It really just tastes a lot like a cheap rum mixer, not real interested in drinking this again."
"Overall. a fine beer but not something I will come back to. It actually makes me want to drink some nice dark rum, rather than continue with the beer."
"Thanks Aaron for sharing this!"
"O - I did somewhat enjoy this beer. It wasn't anything spectacular, but it had some nice flavors and I found it fairly easy drinking despite the big alcohol content. I was excited to see a rum aged beer, but I think I'd pass if I came across some more."
"Overall- A less dynamic and more boozy version of the original Innis and Gunn. Very drinkable nonetheless."
"Overall: Was really surprised by this one and seems to deserve better than a B."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Beautiful clear reddish-brown pour with one and a half finger head with decent retention and nice lacing. Huge toasty nose that's full of oak and caramel with hints of vanilla, tobacco, and just a touch of ginger, dark fruit and rum. Toasty caramel and oak dominate the taste as well with lots of vanilla and just a touch of cinnamon. Spiced rum and whiskey are present as well with just a smidgen of cocoa making this a really complex and flavorful brew. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, mellow and slightly creamy with almost no evidence of the 7.4 ABV. A hugely drinkable beer considering how rich it is. This is my third different offering from Innis & Gunn and it won't be my last. I love barrel-aged beers and these guys know how to do it well. A great choice for my 200th beer review!"
"A tasty and unique brew and I’ll have to check out the regular version sometime in the near future. Boo to the clear bottles, though."
"Mouthfeel is slick, almost oily."
"Final Thoughts: I'm glad to see Innis and Gunn win some redemption in my eyes after that somewhat lackluster blonde. I'd say it was nearly as enjoyable as the Canadian Cask and it really comes out as it warms. It doesn't yet beat the standard Innis and Gunn though, but that's ok. Thumbs Up."
"M: Really balanced, not bitter but not sweet, it is also not simple with a good ending that opens the door for the next sip."
"O - I expected to dislike this style and was surprised at how much I enjoyed it - half way through I caught myself reliving some goodtimes from years past involving a bottle of rum and some sun - definitely not a session ale but I will be back for more"
"Dark amber with a sweat of lace as the head recedes from bushy to the depth of a silver dollar. It mounts itself proudly upon the beverage. Wood, malt, rum, a little spice. It's on the sweet side, but not over the top. Rum is heavy with its influence without creating a boozy trick. A little oak involves itself too. Pretty tasty and fairly easy drinking for a beer as sweet as it is. Not too shabby.."
"O: The attempted rum flavors taste like Texas Pete and make this tough to finish."
"Fairly nice but a little bit subdued. Compared to other Wee Heavies I've had it's got a significantly lighter body and less overall flavor impact. I'm happy to have tried it, but probably won't go out of my way to find it."
"O - I really enjoyed this one. A lot of different flavours come through and compliment each other very nicely. Will be buying more of this one for sure."
"Beautiful, boozy, and thick. This is an above average beer from a great brewery that is making it happen. It's sweet, it's got the vanilla notes, the woodiness of the oak casks, the dryness of the oak casks, the bite of the alcohol in a contained manner, and it's very pleasant to the eyes and tongue overall. Doesn't have a crazy head or lots of lacing, just a good craft beer."
"O - Overall a bit of a disappointment. At $5 a bottle there's better beers out there and I wouldn't go out and grab another bottle. Worth a try? Maybe, but don't expect anything special."
"Smooth and tasty, but a little too simple to be a sipping beer and a little to strong to be a knock-around brew. For the price though, it's definitely a worthwhile experience."
"This Beer is incredible, the taste is out of this world! If you like a heavier beer than normal with a great after taste then i would recommend to try this beer! Its one of a kind. It also has a very nice smell. The glass for the bottle is transparent. It tastes good on its own or even with pretzels or other snacks."
"This is a very well rounded and tasteful beer. Every sip you find a new characteristic about this. Very light tasting, though, for a Scotch Ale; which could make it deadly to drink all night. For it's price and taste, don't pass up a bottle of this."
"Overall, a pretty good beer that I'm glad I got to try after seeing it on the shelves for so long, but I wouldn't really seek it out when I can get Wet Willy here."
"Not bad - like a lot of Innis and Gunn offerings, I find it's an interesting brew to try, but the effect wears off after a while. Too sweet, and not enough other characteristics to hold my interest."
"Pours a deep amber/mahogany colour, minimal white soapy head, no lacing. Smell is sweet caramel like, sugary, rum, light traces of oak and vanilla and slight alc. Taste is really sweet with notes of rum, caramel, slight alcohol, little vanilla, sugary malt. Light mouthfeel and at times syrupy, fairly high carbonation. Not very good really, it reminds me a little of a poor quality barley wine, ABV noticeable, I cant think of a single thing the oak contributes to this."
"I liked this one alot more than my previous 2 bottles, it reminds me kinda of Berkshire Gude Greg. I've always wanted to try a beer with rum barrels involved, this one is does it well I think but the sweetness is a bit cloying."
"Otherwise, this beer is worth a try. It is definitely different, in a good way."
"Innis & Gunn Oak Aged Beer is a clear, sparkling, copper-brown with a thin, dense, khaki head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. It smells like a cave with some resiny wood, a little roast and a hint of sweetness and alcohol. It's medium bodied and syrupy with a sticky finish. It's quite sweet. It starts out a little nutty, with no bitterness. Flavors of oak and rum take over and last past the finish. Sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. It's not for chugging! This delivers exactly what it advertises: rum and oak."
"Notes: I love the flavor and balance of all its very subtle complexity but it just lacks depth in the body."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip this beer appears, well, like a dark rum....with head. The head recedes Smells great, rummy, oak-y, sugar cane, caramel, coconut, spicy, very layered and complex nose. There's a little hop bitterness in the taste but all else is overpowered by the rum and oak taste. It's got medium body with a good pricly carbonation to help with the booziness which is felt in the nasal passages and then warms the belly. Still boozy tasting which makes me not want to drink too many of them."
"Dr: It hides its abv absurdly well. Very fairly priced even in Ireland. Definitely give this one a go, lads. You won't regret it."
"D: Pretty drinkable for a higher abv English Ale with heavy rum overtones. I never thought I would have enjoyed the combo but I was pleasantly surprised!"
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. It's an overall good Ale."
"this beer pours a nice brownish red color with a bit of off white head that recedes to nothing rather quickly. the aroma immediately brings sweet carmalized malts to mind mixed with a bit of vanilla. the taste follows with a nice mixture of sweet malt, oakey vanilla, and a bit of the rum at the end. the light body and adequate carbonation make this a bit too easy of a drink for a wee heavy."
"Drinkability: Definitely will buy again."
"I will not get this beer...much less brand again....too expensive for what your getting"
"Price = $2.99 at Whole Foods"
"D: I'm not a big rum fan, which is why I was a little hesitant with this beer but the rum attributes weren't overly strong. It wasn't bad but one is quite enough and you'll be looking for something different."
"Can't make my mind up on this one. I want to hate it, as the thought of rum takes me back to the nightmare times of my youthful mistakes with rum. But somehow, this brew works."
"What really takes the cake here are the rum flavors infused with peat and vanilla. I think this beer does a great job of expressing individuality of a brewery as well as experimentation of beer styles. In my opinion this beer is in a beerstyle of its own."
"D: I didn't love it, but it's drinkable enough. The ABV wasn't an issue. Still, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're really keen."
"Whoa, where to start... It looked OK, with a deep amber brownish hue, but it was all downhill from there. Musky, woodsy, eye-watering smell. Overly sweet taste combined with the chewy and slick mouthfeel are what you'd expect if motor oil were blended with honey and maple syrup. Couldn't even finish the glass; stay away."
"The burn umber colored body was clear, and topped with a one fingered head, leaving lots of sticky lace. The smell was very peaty and smoky, and clearly evocative of Scotland. The taste was very rich, as the notes of chocolate, toffee, and brown sugar derived from both the malts, and the rum, blended well with smoke, peat, and vanilla. The beer was rich and velvety in the mouth, but could have used a bit more heft in the body. A good representative of the style, with a compatible aging method that does not call too much attention to itself."
"D: Given the relatively high strength of the ABV at 7.4% and the heavy handed oak and booze flavors, this brew will not be for everyone. However, it has a clean, subtle complexity with liquor companion notes that will surely entertain the open-minded palate. Pretty nice, and I'd like to try it in a cask or on draught someplace with a nitro-tap, perhaps."
"Yeah, not bad, but also missing something. My scores are only average, and the beer doesn't grip me with anything more than mediocrity."
"Rich brown pour into a snifter with a half finger head, fizzy on the peremeter with more froth in the center. The head dissipates in under a minute leaving the deep brown brew to stand virutally alone. The aroma is eclectic; the wood of the aging barrels is up front as is the sweetness of the rum. Notes of spice (presumably from the rum barrels) elevate as the beer warms while the more traditional beer aromas of yeast and malt are secondary here. It has a very ""island"" character to it. The first sip is a bit of a let down given the heavy aromas coming from my glass. The body is good not thin or watery while offering no syrupy slick either. The carbonation is low as suspected with the quickly dissipating head. There is a background of woodsiness,not overpowering at all, but I am missing a lot of the spice and sugar on my pallet (I have just gotten over a cold a couple of days ago, but I don't think I'm tasting at a deficit). The smoothness of the brew in both its carbonation and even body combined with its mellow flavors allow for a highly drinkable beer for me, whose alcohol content is right on at 7.4%. I don't get a boozy character in the 7% range which is a pleasant departure from many of the high octane liquor barrel conditioned brews."
"M, D- The palate is enveloped very nicely without being overwhelmed or fatigued. Good balance of all elements. Very drinkable."
"D- Drinkability is actually alright, not what I look for in this style, but that might make it a little easier to get a few more down. Definitely nothing off putting in this."
"Alcohol is hidden in this beer but does come out after a while. Very drinkable and pleasant."
"Pours a clear amber-brown colour with thin white head. Some mild lacing on the glass. Smells strongly of oak, vanilla, rum, and butterscotch. I think the rum flavour makes the Innis & Gunn beer better (since all their beers seem to be the same with an extra flavour). Vanilla isn't as overpowering as it is in some Innis & Gunn beers. High carbonation level. My favourite beer from this brewery."
"All things considered, this is a good beer. It's not the great one I wanted (and thought) it to be, but it's still an interesting brew. Now I am just curious about whether that 107-day-aged stuff was any better."
"D: Surprisingly very drinkable even with a liquor taste to it, probably because you expect that going in. But either way great mix of the flavors and very well balanced."
"D- I enjoyed this as much as the originial oak aged one, but in a different way. This one I found to be more drinkable. That is to say, I could drink a few of this and enjoy the last one as much as the first, whereas the original I could see not enjoying the second one as much. Not my favorite wee heavy, but still a solid beer."
"Couldn't get past the skunk of this. Glad I picked up a single and not a sixer."
"If you like Rum this is beer you should try. Very easy to drink a couple. Thought it was very tasteful.Just released here in Rochester. Deffintly suggest to give this one a try for the Holidays. Im sure your Uncle or Dad would really enjoy this around the x-mas tree. I know I will."
"Pours walnut brown with a thin, creamy, white head. Smells extremely creamy and with quite a bit of vanilla from the oak, plus some spice and light molasses from the rum and tropical fruit flavors. A bit like a cream soda. Tastes similar-lots of oaky vanilla and rum flavors on a sweet malt base- you really have to like rum (and oak) to like this one. I guess I like it well enough, but this is less like a beer than something else. Very creamy in the mouth, but with some oaky tannins that add a bite. It gets a bit tiresome after a full bottle."
"The beer pours a beautiful, deep amber/red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is excellent! It has a complex aroma that boasts of burnt toffee and oak aging. It's sweet smelling with loads of malt character along with a killer oak nose. The rum character is light to mild and really enhances the aroma. The taste is good. It has a damn smooth malt flavor. It's sweet with excellent caramel notes. It goes down easy with a dry oakey finish. There is a hint of rum in the finish as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an outstanding Scotch ale. I'm a huge fan of the oak character and really enjoy the rum addition as well."
"d-pretty bold....I could only do a few of these...they are sippers iMO."
"Pours a crystal clear brown color with a tight creamy head that settles into a light cap. The aroma is filled with rum notes and oak sourness. There is a brown sugar sweetness as well. The rum flavor is quite present in the taste but its not harsh, blends in nicely with the malt. Almost gives it a cola like flavor. There is a pleasant vanilla flavor as well. I don't pick up too much from the malt. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation; starts off and finishes sweet but nothing cloying. The ABV is well hidden. A very drinkable barrel aged brew. The rum flavors worked well with the malt body. The crisp carbonation helps keep the brew from becoming to slick or sticky."
"D - Pretty good. This would be a good winter beer for a cold night as the warming combination of flavours do a good job together. I&G seem to get a bad image for what they do, but they seem to make very accessible and interesting beers."
"Pours dark red with a little bit of off-white head. Smells primarily like oak with a touch of charred fruits. Taste is heavily roasted grains - caramel malt and some darker grains - a strong overtone of charred oak and fruit, much like Caribbean rum. Dark sugars add a strong supplement to the grain. Mouthfeel is smoky and bitter, but very flavorful and delicious. Moderately drinkable for a heavier and stronger ale."
"Drinkability - goes down dramatically easy for the ABV. I probably wouldn't have more than one or two of these as they are pretty expensive and would be a bit of an event to enjoy."
"I often have a hard time appreciating I&G, but this was not the watery sour wood that I often feel."
"Drinkability: I liked it. It's a decent mix of flavors leaning towards being malty sweet. Interesting and pleasant enough for at least one go-around."
"All in all, I was pleased with this beer. While I loved how drinkable it was, I would gladly sacrifice the drinkability in favor of a richer body."
"drinkability: Enjoyable, but I'm disappointed. I was looking forward to this beer. They're onto something here but it needs more cahones imho."
"This got old as the bottled ended. One was enough for a sitting. Very tasty and enjoyable, but a bit indistinctive. Needs some punch, and it lacks it (bitter, booze, something). Worth the try."
"Drinkability is so so, it doesn't have a big abv hit, but the slight sticky feel at the end, along with long lingering butter rum and coconut, as well as the overall dominance of rum flavors, it's not something I can drink too fast."
"D: If the rum didn't dominate so much this would be a great beer."
"Nice creamy carbonation, a bit low perhaps?"
"An interesting brew, but I don't think its as well put together as some of I&G's other offerings. Comes across as a little simplistic in comparison without the same depth of character."
"D: Below average for the style."
"Nice drink but all these I&G brews are a tad too sweet for my palate."
"It gets better as it warms even though brewers suggest 4 to 6 degrees C."
"D: Wouldn't be the first beer I'd run out to buy, but it's one of Innis and Gunn's better beers."
"Initially I was of the mind that this was one of the most pleasant Innis & Gunn brews I'd tried. Unfortunately their old habit of high Diacetyl levels and poor balancing becomes all to prevalent under warmer conditions. A very two faced beer best consumed cold!"
"Certainly worth trying...it's an adventure."
"An interesting beer, not for everyone, but certainly different and worth having the once, if only to say you've tried it."
"Mouthfeel is fine but drinkability is low. Having more than one of these is doable but not something I'm looking forward to."
"Nice, rummy brick red with a fine cap of creamy foam. More brown sugar than anything else in the nose, plus a faint skunk (thank you, clear bottle) and some faint leafy hops. Sweet and sugary flavor with, yes, a slight rum kick and a bit of cola to round things out. Quite nice, actually, with some pleasant lime and vanilla nuances and an agreeable spice integrated nicely with the somewhat high alcohol. Nice work from Innis & Gunn, better than their usual offerings by far."
"D: It's not bad to drink, but I do not find it that enjoyable. The rum aspect is to overpowering and there is not much else left in the beer. It's just not my cup of tea."
"The white-wine notes are about the only clear connection to the oak - I was hoping for a bit more vanilla or bourbon, or at least in this case, some prominent rum notes. None of that really comes through, and while it's not a bad tasting beer, it's just not all that interesting either. Goes down easily enough, but doesn't hold my interest."
"I will most likely drink this again"
"Overall, a very well done beer, and I preferred this offering to their regular one."
"You know what? Forget it. I just find, of the three I have had, I&G beers are too sweet and the oak finishing brings nothing to the party for me."
"Red mahogany with a generous capping of tightly formed beige head. The head lasts right to the end and leaves some lace behind. Aroma of vanilla & plum with hints of toffee & cherry. There's big rum note in the nose, and a little bit of spice. The vanilla flavour is much more pronounced than in the Innis & Gunn Original. It's pretty buttery, perhaps both from diacetyl and oak. Dark fruit, some spice, hint of toffee, and that rum character again. Sweet with a mildly sour finish. Alcohol is extremely well hidden, and integrates extremely well into the overall flavour profile as it comes forward. Light-medium body with fine carbonation. Feels syrupy. I find the sweetness becomes a little much towards the end, but this is otherwise a delicious sipper."
"M&D: overly fizzy and fluffy comes the palate, and the body comes a bit too thin as well. The lengthy ageing process (107 days) for this limited edition seems to be at the expense of flavour and fails to bring out whatever unique elements rum casks are supposed to contribute. Plus, in terms of bottling quality, the much added CO2 is a major put-off for my palate, hence a rather poor rating for this beer overall (in comparison with other Innis&Gunn products)."
"That said, I would definitely buy this beer again. It's my favourite Innis & Gunn brew, so as long as it's available, I'll continue to pick up a bottle from time to time."
"In spite of the fact that my first Innis & Gunn beer didn't knock my socks off, I'm grateful to biegaman for the opportunity to review Rum Cask Oak Aged Beer. Bottom line: it's too bad that the contents of the bottle aren't half as impressive as the bottle itself."
"drinkability is good. i think if i was more of a rum fan, i'd be more into this. it seems fairly balanced and nicely put together, with the alcohol being pretty much completely hidden, even once the beer has reached room temperature. that said, the rum isn't really my thing so it takes away a little."
"The oak is a bit too funky and overpowering for my tastes, but this is an OK beer. The alcohol is well hidden throughout."
"Overall, I enjoyed it quite a bit, and would pick up some more bottles if Innis & Gunn ever brew another batch."
"give it a try, something different to enjoy."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep copper color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and very minimal lacing. Aroma of rum and lightly sweet barley. Taste is also a nice mix between some rum notes with some barley notes. More balanced then previous version and barrel-aging doesn't overtake the whole beer. Not sure this is something I would want to drink often but still enjoyable."
"I like Innis and Gunn and I've really enjoyed all of their limited edition special releases. I'm not sure how this compares to previous years' offerings but I bet it's quite favorably. It certainly has gotten me more eager now for next year's release! I've found consistency in the quality of these hand crafted ales and I'm happy to see the brothers have taken that to new and more experimental heights."
"Drinkability suffers from the sweetness and the alcohol. I was pretty dissapointed."
"Thin mouthfeel, this beer is suprisingly light and drinkable, it only needs more body and some more hops and it's good to go!"
"This one has a little more meat on the bones than the regular version. The rum cask really comes through in the finish and adds to the experience of the beer. The fact that this is not the biggest bodied beer by itself works in some ways to its avantage as the drinker is left more with the way cask rum barrels change the flavour than the beer itself."
"If I could easily buy this beer locally, I'd pick one up from time to time, but I'll have to reserve my indulgence for trips to my sister provinces."
"While I'm generally a fan of barrel aging Wee Heavys, I don't think the original brew stands up very well to the whiskey flavor - it just sort of overwhelms everything instead of complementing it. Perhaps oak chips a la Arrogant Bastard is the solution for this type of brew."
"D - Interesting but not quite my style. Wood and rum come through without being overwhelming."
"LCBO annual tradition. I liked this one too. It had a sharp and boozy cask aroma. It had a reddish tinge, good white head and lots of lace. Medium plus mouthfeel, stomach burns, and good rum dark sugar complex features. Good drinkability, more than a sipper. Nice."
"If I could taste more of the beer this might be alright. As it is, I can't really find any pleasure in it."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Pours brown-ish colour with red tones. Has thin white head which dissapeared quickly. Smell - complex - oak, plums, caramel. Really nice aroma, very pleasant. Taste - pretty sour fruitiness with hints of caramel and toffe. Really nice stuff. Very smooth and very drinkable. Excellent beer, higly recommended."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost a cherrywood colour, decent thick off white head forms, drops some nice lacing on the glass, settles to a thick ring and decent layer. Smell is neat, vanilla, oak, citrus, a bit of spice, caramel, sugarcane, light sourness, quite fruity, almost a pineapple thing going on, neat. Taste is pretty good, kind of light, oaky sourness, vanilla and caramel, rum and bananas, brown sugar, raisin, some fruit, buttery, not bad. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, buttery smooth stuff. Goes down real easy, not bad but not a whole lot going on."
"D- I gave this a high grade because for a beer that's 7.4%, the alcohol is very well hidden! I can't believe that it's this strong to tell you the truth. I will definitely get some more of this while it's available and I'm sure I could get into trouble enjoying this brew during an evening! I actually like this better than I&Gs' standard Oak Aged Beer. Well done!"
"Taste is pretty boozy. For me there is a lack of depth and it leans a bit too far to the sweet side of the palate. Luckily there is a bit of granny smith apple tartness to get things a bit more on track. Dried fruit and vanilla round off the palate with a bit of a woody undertone. Creamy in the mouth with a very mild carbonation, a bit thin feeling. This is a sessionable beer but I still find it a bit on the sweet side."
"A decent offering from Innis and Gunn, more enjoyable than their IPA, but I still prefer their regular oak aged ale."
"A rather underwhelming effort for this brewery - rum maybe not being the best choice for such an otherwise thin base beer. More wood than malt, which is saying a lot for these guys - usually I've had my fill of sugary caramel and toffee halfway through the bottle, but not with this one, as the rum barrel imposes itself in an unforeseen sort of way. So what's next - a port finish?"
"Other comments: These Innis & Gunn beers are a great way to get an idea about how different types of wood casks affect the flavor of a beer. Keep 'em coming!"
