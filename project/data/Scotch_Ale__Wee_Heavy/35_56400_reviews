"The body is full and even thick even as a heavy carbonation tries to cut it.  It leans cloying, but the crispness helps some and it isn't too syrupy."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and it was a good example of a Wee Heavy, it took the non traditional smoked malt aspect and I didn't mind that, in that aspect it seemed to be pretty similar to Dark Horse's Scotty Karate.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, a little creamy, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, but I wouldn't rule out drinking two, but that would be my limit.  What I like the most about this beer was the complexity, it was fairly complex for the style and I liked that.  What I liked the least about this beer was that the body just wasn't a little thicker, but in the end that wasn't a big deal.  I would buy this beer again and I would't mind seeing how it ages.  I would recommend giving this a try if your a fan of the style, especially if you like the Wee Heavys with smoked malts.  All in all I was happy with this beer and i think it might be one of the best beers from this series that I've had.  It's not my favorite Sam Adams beer or my favorite Wee Heavy, but I would say it's just a notch under Scotty Karate.  Nice job guys this, was a good beer, keep up the solid work."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/25/2012. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, light smoke, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light smoke, herbal, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, chocolate, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Scotch ale style! All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"The taste however, wasn't what I was expecting in a wee heavy. It had too much of an alcohol burn in the finish and not enough barley taste. I have had a lot of wee heavy's from other brewers and this, unfortunately, doesn't live up to the rest."
"Samuel Adams' Imperial Series, scotch ale inspired, Wee Heavy is one intriguing brew. I was lucky to stumble across a 4 pack recently and sampled a couple and put the others away to age them to try again later. The beer poured a very dark/amber brown with a modest creamy head with retention and some lacing as well. I found the taste from the dark roasted malts to be smokey and smooth with a very adequate mouthfeel and enjoyed the peat smoked malts as well. I found the high ABV to be hidden very well within this sweet tasting beer. Overall I found the brew to be very intense and complex; one I would recommend and purchase again. Well done Samuel Adams!"

"overall - decent, but the flavor has room for improvement."

"Drank this one straight out of the bottle. Smells of smoked malts with hints of sweetness and alcohol. The taste matches with a very smokey flavor with subtle sweetness through out. This was my first of the Sam Adams imperial line of beers and I definitely enjoined it."

"From my tasting notes: It poured a dark burnt amber, almost opaque with a thin tan head. It had a sweet malty aroma with a hint of burnt chocolate. The flavor was very bold and intense like a barley wine with a sharper smoky burnt malt flavor with the sweet malt hiding underneath. This was a big complex beer that deserves the Imperial moniker. Tasty."

"Taste: Strong but not over powering, complex and almost perfect for me Regardless if you don't like Scotch Ales, which until now never had any that I really like that much. This is my number one beer, not style. American beer has come a long way and this is a shining example but not the only one in the Imperial series that is not only head and shoulders above any American beer but any foreign made beer also. Also a great example of a beer that is well worth the it's price!"

"Overall: While this is not the best Wee Heavy I have come across, it is a very nice example of the style; I would prefer a bit more peat and a bit less sweetness but this is still quite enjoyable"

"Very dark with heavy head and mild carbonation. Chocolatey, caramel, malty aroma with notes of coffee beans. Burnt toasted coffee and caramel taste with heavy alcohol flavor. It's a 10% abv and you can really taste it. Really burnt taste. This is for people who ask for their hot dogs burnt."
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent beer that got better as it warmed. The peat flavor was a welcome strong suit, as it is in any ale of this sort. Not shy with the alcohol content, but works well within the style. An enjoyable drinking experience, big peat smoke in a big beer."
""
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
"Overall a great job by the brew wizards at Samuel Adams. With the high ABV one should not serve this beverage to amateurs, children or any small mammals. Do not attempt to subdue complicated algebraic problems , drive long distances, or preform liver transplants on your drinking buddy while consuming Wee Heavy. Just a suggestion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a ""kick ass"" brew! Be careful, it combines high alcohol with high drinkability! The look, smell, and taste of this concoction is delightful. This has to be my favorite of the Imperial Series."
""
"I was surprisingly impressed with this beer - it's smooth, tasty, complex, and balanced. On the sweet side, would go good with dessert or for dessert. Underrated."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, decent head, but no real lacing. Nose is full and strong components of coffee, tea, sweet and fall spice. Smoky coffee with some bittersweet licorice and dark chocolate. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"M: thick like an oatmeal stout, very silky and viscous. Does not feel hot even though we are approaching 10% abv"

"Fine to get you through on a cold night, but not enough to make up for its deficiencies."

"Aroma and flavor were somewhat disjointed. Aroma was far sweeter and dark fruit forward than the flavor, which was much more savory. There may be a bit too much going on here. The smoke and dark berry flavors collide somewhat strangely."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the first Scottish ale so I have nothing to compare to except the description and according to that it seems to be spot on. I really like this style however. It was a bit sweet but really liked the roasty caramel taste."
""
"O - Overall, this was a solid beer. And a soild Scotch Ale. Better than Skull Splitter and Dirty Bastard, But it doesn't compare to Scotty Karate."
""
""
""

"Overall this is my first Wee Heavy , I enjoyed it , if this is one of the middle of the roads for this beer I'm excited to try the better ones"

"Pours a deep amber color with a 1/4 in head that held its own for a while. Lots of sugars and maltiness on the nose - brown sugar, dark rum, some chocolate notes. This is a beer that stays with you, as the taste (and smell) lingers for some time, and I'm not too sure that that is a good thing. For me, it is a bit too syrupy and chewy, and the intense sugars and alcohol tend to overpower at times. There's a faint pine and peat taste, and a hint of basil, but these get lost amongst the front-loaded barrage of sugary booze."

"Overall â€“ A nice smoky brew that is good to sit back with and sip slowly while being warmed by all the boozy and roasty flavors."
"Overall this is a pretty bold beer by Sam Adams. Takes the style by the horns and really amps up from their usual selection."
""
""
""
""
""
"But, overall a decent flavor. Very thick, chewy, and mouth coating feel. Nicely carbonated! A sipper for sure. Not bad, not great."

""
""
""
""
"This was a very nice scotch ale. If I were to have one complaint it would be that it was slightly too sweet. Beyond that this was a really solid beer. It had great malt character and for the ABV it had great drinkability. I will definitely have this again."
"O: After aging for about a year, this beer becomes a top tier Wee Heavy. The first bottle of the four-pack from about a year ago was an absolute fireball: The overwhelming alcohol heat blunted everything else. After a year this beer is still very boozy. However, the booziness now blends with and compliments a pleasing yeast combination of breadiness and a little clove; and, the grain provides a very nice richness to the flavor. There is also a very pleasant balance of malt sweetness and earthy hops. This beer is in the top tier of Wee Heavies, but, it is somewhere is middle of that top tier."
""
""
""
""
"O: I have to first say that while I might be a beer snob I don't discount Sam Adams carte blanche. Some of the beers I cut my teeth on were Sam Adams and I don't mind their beers. This one though is a one trick pony and gives into an unrefined alcohol taste over some added complexities of a beer worth sipping. I like wee heavies, their my session beer style of choice ;-) This beer is average with quite a few others that represent the style better."

"O- I'm not gonna say this is fantastic... but it's not far off! Subtley smokey, amazing caramel sweetness, nicely cocoa bittered, deep dried fruitiness. So why did it take me this long to try this one? Well done Sam... well done indeed!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm very surprised this clocks in at 10% ABV - there's no pop or heat at all that pushes through. Interesting take on the style, as the chocolate notes suggest more of a rich cocoa porter and the fruits suggest more of a Belgium strong ale than the wee-heavy Scotch ale that it is. In the end, the deep, rich caramels and dried, smokey fruits define the glass. This would make a good alternative for an after-dinner drink. It also reminds me of a deep, rich, dark chutney. It made a tasty nitecap, but it's definitely a small-quantity, sipping libation. Recommended to experience, especially if one thinks the best Samuel Adams can do is the Boston Lager the corner tavern recently added beside the Bud taps because everyone's asking for a craft beer these days."
"Poured from bottle into provided shock top hefe glass at mellow mushroom covington, LA. Pours a deep amber color with some slight off white head and nice lacing. Really strong scotch aromas...malty peat. I mean like the single malt kind. Taste is very boozey but full of peaty scotch malts. It was harsh at first, but the flavor profile really developed, still harsh, but nice flavor. Overall, a good wee but not amazing. I guess its good considring the abv."
""
"4.5, 4, 3.5, 4, 4"
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a touch of syrup thickness."
"O- When I review I judge in the order they appear here and then add in any notes I notice as I finish he beer ... After my first taste I was reluctant to try it again for mouthfeel. That flavor was just way too much much of two things I don't enjoy in a beer. Was a drain pour for me ..."

"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a dark mahogany brown with a fine one finger light brown head with good retentiona and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, vanilla and light toasted malt. Flavor of sweet and caramel malt, dark dried fruit, light peat smoke, hint of chocolate. A hint of diacetyl. Hits all the wee heavy flavor notes, perhaps a bit on the sweet side, but complex and flavorful. The alcohol shows through a bit in the flavor, but defininately warming. Medium to heavy bodied with decent creaminess. A nice take on a wee heavy."
""
"Not bad. Could use a little more balance. Descent scotch ale."

"THis is my favorite scotch ale and it is a heavy hitter! Brown-red color. No Head to speak of. Let it get warm, and the alcohol really comes out. Very sweet and malty with warm alcohol on your tongue. Nice dessert beer. Have 2 and you will be really buzzing. A bit pricey at 10 bucks a 4 pack, but well worth it when you get out of college and start making the big bucks!"
""
"I wish this was just a bit weaker and more full-bodied. If it was sweeter and more sticky to the mouthfeel, this could have been really good. For now, I'll take it for what it's worth, and that's a decent interpretation of this style that won't offend or blow away anyone."
"Very decent representation. Dark chocolate body, with a little attractive lace and head. Toffee, nutty, mildly smokey aroma. Above average mouthfeel, good drinkability for the style and a 10%. Barleywine complexity, brown sugar, and aging of a few seasons helped."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - this is certainly worth a try! I see that the brothersndidnt necessarily like it, but I thought it was a solid beer. Is it the best wee heavy you will ever drink? No. Is it worth buying and trying? Absolutely. I would absolutely drink this again, although I likely wouldn't buy it just because for the money I can get Founders just as easy, which is outstanding. Anyway, a good beer for sure, give it a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Next time I see this...pass."
""
""
"Overall - For a 10% ABV Beer, this is incredibly easy to drink and there is no alcohol taste what-so-ever. I'm not sure on the availability of this beer, but if you see it I would definitely pick it up"
"Overall: A very solid Wee Heavy. Nice malts and the smoked peat elements are very good."

"Overall: a really good beer, nice to drink, but it doesn't really hide its ABV. The booze is there, as is the body - this isn't a bad thing *at all*!"
"So far the two Imperial Series beers I've had (Imperial White and Double Bock) have missed the mark due to an excessive amount of sweetness. Let's see if a style that's a bit smokier and maliter can fair a bit better. This beer pours out a murky brown color with a tiny head. The aroma is actually quite nice, it's sweet, but nicely tempered by a strong amount of smoked malts, coffee, and a touch of dark fruits. The taste is very good, although it's a bit strange for the style. It almost tastes more like an imperial stout, with strong coffee, roast, and dark fruit flavors. The bit of peaty smoked malt does send it a little more to the scotch ale side, but really, this just tastes like a solid imperial stout with a twist. The mouthfeel is full, rich, and creamy. This beer's a sipper for sure, you won't fly right though this one. All said, it's a solid beer though. I enjoyed it, although it's not necessarily what I wanted from it."

"As you'd expect, it warms really well, and by the time I was 2/3 done (about 30 minutes later), I was sure I was drinking a much more elite beer than I was (hey, maybe the abv had something to do with it, too, but who cares?). If the style (scotch ale, old ale, barleywine, strong dark ale) is to your liking, give it a buy."
""
"It is very reminiscent of a quality scotch and so if you're a fan of the highland malts I would certainly highly recommend diving right into this one."
""
"O - Some good things here, but the intense syrupy taste is just too much. Many better examples of the style out there."
""
""
"O: Sip it and be wowed! Would go well with a cigar. Decent with cheddar. A memorable drink."
""
""
"I thought this beer was very enjoyable, the alcohol may have been a little overbearing but it was tasty all the same."

"Poured a 2"" pretty mocha brownish head with decent life. The body is dark raw umber brown, almost coffee. The smell is far milder than I was expecting but it does hint at rich malt to follow. The taste is where this really shines - a complex rich smooth malt. My only complaint is it's a little yeasty."
""
""
""
"O- A good selection. Picked it up to try something new. Was not disappointed. A very nice sipping beer."
""
""

"Loved the peat moss flavoring they added. I highly recommend this whilst eating pork loin or brussel sprouts."

"This wonderful brew not only is delicious but will lay your ass out. Throw caution to the wind and drink a four pack today. and then tomorrow. and then tomorrow. repeat and be in beer heaven."

" I would enjoy this beer with beef or lamb with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes."

"I'll admit this is my first Scotch Ale, but even so, I was expecting much more from this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Holy hell this is a big beer, but for some reason it doesn't feel quite balanced or assembled quite right. It's probably the salty-sweet overload on this one that holds it back and makes me feel like I need to drink loads of water between each sip. But if you are in the mood for an intensely flavorful sipper to savor slowly across an evening, this could be the one for you and your fine smoking jacket / fez combo to enjoy together by the hearth with the bear skin rug."
""
"Full bodied, thick, with good carbonation. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. Great depth of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The one is pretty easy drinking for 10%; it's a solid beer, but I'm on the fence as to whether I'd but it again."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black into dimpled mug with very little head. Smells of raisins, plums, bread and malt. Wow, another BIG flavored, full bodied beer in their Imperial Series, Wee Heavy indeed, velvety thick that coats the tongue with the aforementioned sweet raisin and plums with the alcohol fully evident that warms deep with a smokey peat like finish. Another BIG beer sipper that I liked more than the Dopplebock in the series as I thought it was a little heavy in the mouthfeel for that style it seemed closer to this Wee Heavy, which is a thick, sweet sipper. The Imperial Series is a good 4-pack series for $9.99 that finds its way into more mainstream outlets like grocery stores."
"Overall: OK...Based on reviews and style I thought it would taste different. Not a bad beer. But too one dimensional for me. I would NOT get this one again."
""
"- Can't say this is really that great of a beer, but it is a nice strengthy offering from Samuel Adams. I was hoping it would turn out better than my opinion of their other beers.. but it really hasn't. It seems to be unique for sure, but doesn't touch what I think the style should be. Wouldn't really buy this again I think."
""
""
"O: Very nice; it's like a Scotch Ale-Stout combo."
""
"Appearance is quintessential scotch ale- very dark, not cloudy. Head disappears quickly. The smell is full molasses and suggests a sweetness. Tastes just the same- molasses overload, and a little sweetness that leads to a good roasty malt taste. The balance is awesome and the booze is all-but-invisible. The mouthfeel is awesome- fat and sticky. Nice warmer @ 10%. It's just what I expected. If you're looking for a readily-vailable Scotch ale with an especially big kick, this is a solid one."
""
"Overall a heavy and interesting beer, I've never had a beer like this before. I'd probably buy this again."
""
""
"Beer is a dark amber color with high carbonation. The soapy head dissipated rapidly. Scents were all true except very ""rusty"" scents came through, making it somewhat unappealing. Some nice peat on the nose. Taste is decent but way too syrupy. The sweetness is not balanced by good hop flavor. It is too cloying and not something I will go back to. The Boston Beer company has always defended by me, but in the past 3 years, they a) have gotten rid of most of their more enjoyable styles b) change the recipes of styles that were great 5 to 7 years ago and c) are way off on their new attempts."
""
""
"Drinkability/overall- I have to say this beer feel short a bit from the last time that I had tried it where i felt the peat and scotch characteristics were far more pronounced, it has decent balance and though pretty drinkable you can definitely notice the alcohol, while this beer wasnt bad it fell way short of my last tasting and on this tasting just simply an okay beer"
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. Itâ€™s strong taste doesnâ€™t overwhelm you. Itâ€™s so smooth and I actually feel it going over my body. I liked it."
""
"Poured into a pint glass with very little head. Very dark brown with a constant light stream of bubbles. It seems more mellow than stout at first. Smell is very unique-coffee, vanilla and chocolate mixed. Smooth on your tongue, sweet with a coffee-like aftertaste that become syrupy. After a couple gulps, the sweetness and the increased alcohol content are not pleasing."
""
"reviewed at the saucer in houston on draft. a deep rootbeer brown with a finger of head sitting on top that fell rather quickly to just a ring around the tulip. leaving amazing lace. the nose is of light molasses, woody, earthy tones and some sweet dark fruits in the back. the taste is of cooked sugar, earthy tones are dominant, a scotch influenced mint flavor with toasted malts. absolute malt bomb. not much of an alcohol presence considering the 10%. as it warmed it became almost undrinkable. the mouth feel is very creamy and easy to drink for the abv as long it avoids approaching room temp. not bad, not great and will never drink again."
""
""
"o - pretty enjoyable, though i don't think i'd ever drink more than one in a night. halfway through the glass and i feel the 10% abv kicking in. seems to hit all the style points as well. worth a try for sure."
"All the flavors come across too heavy and don't seem to mesh well. I will cellar the rest of this four pack to see if it improves with age."
""
"Notes: The Imperial series hasn't really done much for me. I enjoyed the Double Bock, but the other entries are just sort of ""good but not great."" There's better out there for the money."
"O: a nice drinker, really helps to wind down at the very end of a very long day"
"Bottle: Poured a dark caramel color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of caramel malt with light toffee notes. Taste is a mix between some caramel malt notes with some toffee notes also noticeable. I canâ€™t say that peat notes were really noticeable or played a big role in the flavour profile. Body is slightly fuller then average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad overall but lacking complexity."
""
""
"Should really be called a ""Smoked Scotch Ale."" Other than the ABV being over-the-top, it's not bad. I enjoyed it."
"Overall I believe this might be one of the best Wee Heavy's I have had to date. Nice beer Boston Brewing!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, although there are other beers in the style that I would chose before this one itâ€™s still a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
"Medium to full bodied, average carbonation, the alcohol is well hidden for 10.00 % abv, and there is a sweet and smoky aftertaste. I like sweet beers, but wish there was some bitterness to balance it out. Otherwise I enjoyed this quite a bit."
""
""
"Poured out as a very dark brown color, the head was a decent size and tan in color. The smell of the beer was loaded with peated malts and some caramel sweetness on the nose. The taste of the beer wan't as good as I was hoping for, It's a little bit on the burnt/smokey side. I feel like the flavor mellows the more I drink it but the taste wasn't my favorite. The mouthfeel was pretty good though. The feel was oily and thick. There was a good level of carbonation in there also. Overall this beer wasn't bad, I had been looking forward to trying it for a really long time and finally had the chance last night. I can't say that it was mind blowing in anyway but I am glad that I finally found a bottle and gave it a shot. I might buy it again if it were on draft or something, but I wouldn't get a case of it."

"Overall Drinkability - Absolutely fantastic. No major flaws. Sum is better than the parts."
"Overall: this is a huge beer with a giant smokiness which is really too much for the style. That said, it's a smooth, smoky, malty monstrosity which, style be damned, I personally really like. Kudos to Boston Beer Co!"
""
"As I mtntioned, I'm not a fan of the style, but this is something I could tolerate. It's sweeter than I can appreciate, but overall, it's a good rendition of what it's supposed to be."
"Appearance is dark, no really dark. Ok this is brown. Smell is smooth with hints of smoke. Mouthfeel, sits well and leaves the mouth very smoothly. Taste is special for a dark brew. The flavors blend well and leave you wanting to have a little more. Overall for an Wee Heavy style of Imperial is good. While this maybe a one and done it is a must have. Say cheese..."
""
"I would definitely recommend this beer, especially if you enjoy a good scotch ale which has a lot of malt complexities."
"This Wee Heavy pours a deep caramel brown color with a slight creamy head. A muted aroma of malt, peat, oak and a tad of alcohol. Creamy on the palate, with some prickly alcohol. That alcohol warms the chest. Mostly malty flavors mix with that alcohol to provide some balance. Sweetness is extensive, but not overpowering."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet. This pours a thick dark brown which doesn't much light through with a short lived tan head. The smells are very malts, some caramel, molasses and other malts. The feel is medium to thick. The taste seems a little off, I'm not sure how to describe it, the other reviews say peat, there is also some alcohol present along with lots of excessive malts caramel and molasses. I definitely like the old chub more than this."

""
"O - A tasty wee heavy and not for the faint of heart. This is a bold beer and should be respected as such. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, at first this seemed like a less balanced version of the style, which I somewhat think is true still, but after seeing that, I found that I really enjoyed the intensity of all the scotch goodness. As much as this style seems heavier to start, this seems like an imperial version of the Scotch Ale."

"i would say slighty full bodied. moderate carbonation. drinks slighty like a wine."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very dark brown, with a two inch light tan head that hangs around awhile, leaving some attractive lacing. Smell is carmel, tobacco, dark fruits, smoke, and some booze. Taste is very smoky threw out, carmel, bread, and hints of chocolate in the middle, and a little warming booze in the finish. Body is really nice, thick but silky smooth. Nice carbonation and very drinkable for it's high ABV. I really enjoyed this beer even with the powerful smokyness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite the treat, this has a burly attitude and is a definite slow sipper, but it never quite veers out of control. Well-made, well-played. Well worth a try."
""
"O: Not bad, but not something I would probably reach for again. An interesting take on the style with the smokiness, for which I give it some props."
"Overall, Samuel Adams Wee Heavy is a balanced and warming sipper with an enticing smokey character. While the palate is a little thin for the style, it also increases the drinkability. I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys Highland whiskies and bold, contemplative scotch ales."
"The bottom line is that this is a good example of the style. In particular I like the very balanced and well integrated smoke component of this ale. Very drinkable, and yes I would like another."
"Taste is unique - at least for me - and quite nice. Some spiciness, some alcohol. Malts, not as roasted as you'd think for being so dark. A hint of smokiness? The most scotch-like beer I've ever had. The other scotch ales I had were watery and tasteless compared to this."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours an opaque, dark brown color. There was a small tan head that didnâ€™t linger or leave much lacing. Lots of malts to the nose. Caramel, dark fruits are the most dominant. Some of a smoky peat aroma also. The taste is quite good. Subdued malt sweetness, with a hint of a peaty-smokey taste. Slight hint of chocolate. Full bodied. A bit dry to the finish."
"Overall: a surprising beer with a smoky punch. Not bad for this brewer."
"D- Quite enjoyable."
"Strong, malty flavor has notes of caramel, molasses and miso. It pours a barely translucent dark brown with a fairly thick light tan head that doesnâ€™t stick around too long but leaves some lacing. Strong flavor has an overtone that mixes molasses with caramel but is only slightly sweet. There is a touch of hoppy bitterness and a hint of toffee. Thick, full-bodied texture has a little fizz and leaves a malty, molasses, slightly woody finish."
"A decent attempt at the style. As others have stated a welcome additon to an otherwise overpriced, underwhelming series of beers. Pours a very dark brown with some amber hues. 1/2"" head with very little hold or lacing. Smells of malt, smoke and dried fruits. Taste reflects the aroma, with a little mineral background as well. Alcohol is not overpowering, but I felt the mouthfeel to be a bit on the weak side. Not a bad beer, but couldn't help but feel with a little tweeking could be an excellent beer."
"A welcome addition to an underachieving series by SA."
"O: Given all the hoopla over RIS's as of late I wanted something dark and strong and though the style is different this hit the spot for that, but it's probably not something I'd have more than once a month."
"O: Nice job Sam Adams."
"O-very good. nothing exceptional. might not get again due to the price but very good and worth this try."
"Overall: I find myself buying a lot of imperials but I actually dont care for them. This is a very nice looking beer, the aroma is on but the alcohol is high, even for an imperial for my tastes. I have had plenty of imperials that are able to mask the alcohol content better than this one."
"Beautiful dark mocha brown color. Minimal head even with an aggressive pour. Head dissipates quickly but nice lacing rims the glass as the brew disappears. The nose is peat-like. Almost like I dropped a single malt depth charge into my glass. Flavor is heavy peat/malt. Since I never had a Scotch Ale I was taken by surprise on this one. I can appreciate the style but would be hard pressed to recommend or try again. Sorry Sam."
"Dr: It's drinkable for the ABV, but the flavours just aren't present with enough temerity to justify another purchase."
"A dark, somewhat cloudy mahogany colored brew with a fair light tan head that dissipates to a ring pretty quickly. Lacing is decent. The smell offers blackberry currant malt and alcohol with a subtle smoked peat that I find to be pretty pleasing overall. The flavor is a tad elusive upon first sip, malty licorice settles in after a moment and gives way to a warming prune brandy idea at the finish. Second sip brings a little bit of chocolate and perhaps more of a dark cherry hint to the fruits that come through here. The smoke and peat I detected in the aroma seems to disappear in the flavor of this heavy bodied, thick but drinkable wee heavy. There's a fizzy contribution of carbonation that almost seems in contrast the velvety feel of this 10% ABV brew. Borders on a resinous feel. Looking at the history of this brew here on BA I was expecting something more of a train wreck here, but I can say I liked it for a try. Probably could have done without the entire 4-pack for my money though. I can see where the potential here just doesn't balance out. While you can detect a few nice ideas, it just doesn't blend and I seem to come out with a mere sharp malty thing that just doesn't quite hit the spot other than a little alcohol burn. Would have profited from a goodly hunk of cheddar."
"very, very good. its reassuring that sam adams can make a solid beer when they want to and arent complete sell outs."
"overall: glad i tried it, but this is probably a one timer for me...this beer is nice enough, but drinking it makes me want to crack a barleywine."
"I had been impressed with their Scotch ale, but this one barely compares. It's slightly too sweet and not very complex."
"Overall: a unique ale that is definitely a sipper. worth its weight and well worth the price."
"Overall I really liked this beer. The first time I had it at IX beerfest in Cleveland, Ohio I was very impressed and I knew I needed to revisit it. Thanks to my wonderful wife for picking this out for me on a whim. The only problem I have is that I want to drink more of it and if I do...10% = FAIL"
"O: Way too sweet and the smoke was just sort of off."
"O: Not an impulse beer at a bar, but certainly an interesting choice at a reasonable price."
"O - I've somewhat enjoyed the other beers in the Imperial Series, but I'd have to say this one has been my least favorite...the high ABV really stands out in this smokey, malt bomb"
"Overall an OK above average beer a little too thick and just a little too sweet and malty. There are better Scotch Ales, not one of Boston Brewery's best."
"O - This is a strong beer with a strong malt character. It borders cloyingly sweet and you might want to share it with someone else as a full pour is probably a bit too much. That said, a lot of the Scottish beer character is here, but a bit out of balance. The alcohol is also not as subtle as perhaps desired also."
"Definitely a strong presence, and in the end, quite tasty."
"I used to follow Sam Adams pretty closely but haven't in the past couple years, so I was surprised to see a new imperial series beer. Eventually I found a single to try of the wee heavy. I like it, it is sweet without going overboard. Not a whole lot of peat to my taste buds, seemed more like an English barleywine to me. As long as it tastes good, it's fine with me."
"The Samuel Adams Wee Heavy is exactly what the name describes...A wee heavy and full bodied. The appearance a very dark opaque amber with thin to no head, which was slightly ecru in color. The scent carried a heavy peat malt. The taste was very complex started very light with good hop character and then turned malty with strong earth/peat tones. The mouthfeel is heavy and downgraded due to the strong peat flavor and full body due to higher ABV. Overall it is a decent beer and worth trying."
"Overall, Pretty good, might just nab the attention of some Boston Beer critics. I will say I have had much better wee heavy however."
"O - not a terrible beer, tastes good and gets the job done at 10%, which isn't as detectable as you might think going in. but it's definitely a bit of a malt bomb, and a little more balance could go a long way with this."
"overall: I really liked it, i will have it again some time."
"O: A disappointment. Not a bad beer, but not very good either. It has some good flavors, but there's just too much: too many malts, too much sweetness and too damn thick."
"O - A very sweet beer. Not like other wee heavies, with a lot more malt syrup and body here."
"Pours a dark mahogany with good clarity but little head. Smells sweet and richly malty with a note of smoke. The taste is even more pronouncedly smokey with lots more sweet, dark malt on the back end. A bit slick in the mouth, and a bit brooding, really, without really delivering the goods. Just decent."
"Overall a decent beer but it didn't do much for me and is an easy pass if I ever comes across it again."
"Overall it's clearly an American take on the style, but that lends even more charm to it. Where the Scottish might downplay the yeasty fruitiness, Samuel Adams has bumped it up, giving it quite a bit of additional character, and more complexity. Charming, to say the least!"
"Overall, and admitting up front that I'm not terribly familiar with the ""wee heavy"" style, I think this is great beer, and a fantastic addition to what has so far been a stellar Imperial Series from Sam Adams: an immensely flavorful, daring, finely crafted brew."
"Alcohol is well blended and peat is strong but not overbearing but rather one dimensional. More and more it becomes very subtly complex. Nicely balanced flavors and easy drinking. I had this with Inglorious Bastards (1970). I should have had a German beer."
"D: I don't have much experience with Wee Heavies, but this is a decent big beer. Really complex flavors make this an interesting brew to sip and enjoy."
"Overall: Very well balanced with lots of big bold yet complex flavors. I like to think of it as an alternative for an imperial stout."
"this beer really is an enigma! the front-end taste is really too much to overcome. too bad, because the aftertaste is pretty darn good but I wouldn't drink again."
"I really liked this brew. I would buy it again and recommend it."
"Pours out a mahogany with a tan head than has decent carbonation along with nice retention and really good lacing on the glass. The smell consists of apple, caramel, smoke, and oak. The taste starts out with some licorice, followed by some caramel and apple and than finishes off with some sweet maltness, smoke and oak. The mouthfeel is sticky on the lips, tongue and palate and finishes dry. Overall a decent beer that is nice when wanting a beer with an unique taste, but with 10% alcohol might want to be careful with how much you drink at one time."
"Tastes better than it smells, and smells better than it looks. Decent brew, though a bit heavy for a wee heavy. This is more like a sweeter old ale, but darker. Still, if you're big into SA, then give it a try, for it is certainly one of the better ones I've had from their brewery."
"This beer wins some major bonus points with me because of my love for peaty scotch. I usually take a ""scotch"" ale to actually mean a ""Scottish"" ale, but in this case ""scotch"" is the more applicable term. My only complaint is the occasional banana presence. I don't get it on every sip, but when I do, it is somewhat off-putting... it's like a little bit of Belgian yeast slipped into the beer during fermentation. It adds a little too much sweetness to the beer. If Sam Adams could dial back the sweetness a bit and escape the banana notes, this beer could achieve the nirvana of the peaty scotch goodness in the drinkable form of beer. In it's current form, however, while it is an interesting, flavorful, enjoyable and powerful beer, its flaws prevent it from achieving true greatness."
"O - Delicious. A well-done Scotch Ale. One of Sam Adams' best."
"Taste: There is a slight roasted bitterness but not much. It is fairly sweet with an almost nutty flavor. I pick up a little on the smokiness but it is not too pronounced."
"To me this is a greatly crafted beer, even so it is a little sweet for my taste, but the beer style almost demands this sweetness."
"Overall - Pretty good, a bit too strong for sweet. Its enjoyable for wee fans, would be way to much for average drinker. Im a fan of wee'sso i would enjoy one and be done. Worth drinking."
"Sampled on July 9, 2011. It shows a semi-opaque mahogany-brown, ruby red hued tone. Loads of Scottish malts up front with a but of smokiness tickling the nostrils on second whiff.The body is heavier in texture than some but also pretty smooth. The 10% ABV is noticeable more in the taste than in the aroma so it makes me think of an English Strong Ale more than anything else."
"O - Color me impressed; it is sort of like a Wee Heavy - done Bamberg style - and it is really a successful concoction on all levels. The only knock I really have is that it is a really big beer and very full-flavored, so its drinkability is diminished."
"D - Blending scotch and smoked wood flavor isn't my bag, but the flavor was unique and enjoyable for the tasting; I'd have one and pass on the next one"
"Overall this beer is very good. One of the best of the style I've had. Great body and full flavor along with ABV."
"Taste is exceptionally malty again, but with a bit of oakiness. Biggest concern is the lack of fruitiness and brown sugar, otherwise an enjoyable beer. Body is full, and thick, definitely a positive for the style."
"O- a decent wee heavy and quite available so that's nice"
"O: A nice scotch ale. The alcohol was a tad hot, but overall it is a quite flavorful full bodied beer. Worthy of a try."
"Pours a two finger khaki head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Clear dark brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Dark fruit nose, flavor is dark fruit and hints of caramel, smooth. Higher ABV is hidden. $3.35 for a 12oz bottle from Bertâ€™s Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"Almost like a barrel aged wee heavy. I like it, but can see how some will not."
"O: Not bad. Not a huge fan of Scotch ales, but it's pretty decent although somewhat expensive."
"Na Zdravje!"
"I love this. Pretty much everything I want in the style, which is my favorite. Plenty of peat, smoke, malt, and not over the top sweet. Which is a big problem with American version. I don't understand the lower scores here. Something I would highly recommend."
"Overall - I was not impressed with this beer. I appreciate what Sam Adams was trying to accomplish and their tribute to the style with a twist, but I simply did not care for the flavor."
"Honestly, this beer just doesn't agree with me. I find it's a little ""hot and spicy"" on my throat as it goes down. This makes it difficult to write too much more about this effort from Sam Adams. I've three left, so I'll come back after I give it another go, as they say."
"The mouthfeel is a little odd. It has almost a light syrupy like effect, I think from the more mild carbonation combined with the sugars. It's not the best SA I've had, but it's very unique. And it's not the priciest beer in the craft brews section, so if this sticks around, it's not as painful getting a decent Scotch ale in my neck of the woods for a fair price!"
"An above-average Wee Heavy, but sweeter than what I would like."
"O-this is a fair representation of the style. it definitely is a little too sweet but the smoked flavor is really good. its fairly easy to drink for the ABV. i'm glad i tried it but i don't need another one."
"O-Nice balance of ingredients-meets the style to a tee, goes good with the venison chop I had along with this one."
"Overall, a nice surprise."
"Pours deep mahogany color with light tan head that is thick at first, then settles to a thin rim layer. Nose is rich with roasty malt, smoky malt, and baked desserts. On the palate the smoked malt is quite a whollop on the palate, dark caramels & toffee, and leads to a roasty dry finish. Aftertaste of toffee & smoky flavors just lingers and lingers. What a savory beer!!"
"The flavor is much improved. Good chocolate notes with a heavy alcohol influence. There's some bitterness that is likely from hop rather than black patent malt as there is no coffee flavors. The alcohol is very present, perhaps on the high side. Rich bodied but not quite syrupy."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter a deep, very dark ruby black color, clear, with ample dark tan head. Some lacing, the head dissipated slowly and remained relatively strong throughout. Initial smell was malty, biscuity, with some smoke noticable. The aroma that stood out to me was a slight floral note after the other aromas faded. Some alcohol smell as well. Taste is malty, with smoke and some alcohol present. Feels good very smooth, almost creamy, and full bodied. Warming sensation from alcohol present. Oiliness present as well. Overall while I enjoyed the beer it was a less aggressive Wee Heavy than I have had in the past."
"Drinkability is outstanding for such a big beer. I have been mostly disappointed by most of the Sam Adams ""Imperial Series"" beers but this one didn't disappoint."
"Took me long enough, but I finally found a single bottle o' this 'round here (I'm always wary of the new stuff, no matter how tempting they may appear). It pours a solid ruby-highlighted brown topped by a lovely finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises toffee, light smoke, candi sugar, light roasted malts, honey, and light cocoa. The taste is a bolder expression of these elements, with the smoke really coming forward, edging the toffee with a nice toasted character. Some mild notes of plum, figs, brown sugar, molasses, and black grapes add some variety to the proceedings. It all works nicely, if borderline cacophonous. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a feel that borders on the lightly chewy. Overall, a very nice brew, possibly the best of SA's Imperial Series."
"D/O: At 10% you probably wont be enjoying to many of these at one time. Smoky roast that is a bit wee-heavy on the alcohol (10%) even per style but thankfully is wee-heavy on flavor making this an enjoyable treat in limited fashion and overall a experience worthy of its imperial standard labeling."
"another great beer in the imperial lineup. i am seriously getting impressed with their releases"
"Finish: Heat pulls up front on the back then lingers to a roosted malt with a little stickiness on the back"
"Taste is creamy sweetness upfront, a peek of chocolate int he middle, and closes with the alcohol power and cherry notes. Almost acrid alcohol aftertaste coupled with numbing lingering sensation. Mouthfeel is smooth, but the close just isn't nice, and drinkability is okay. Too harsh for me overall."
"Food Pairing: Meat, Potatoes, Ham, Sausages, Biscuits, Lamb, Strong Cheeses"
"Overall an ok Scotch ale. I like the style and this brew borders the drinkability with the sweetness while it hides the ten% abv. I'd repeat bye if I need to."
"Other/Overall: I haven't had many Imperial Stouts, but it this was noticeable lighter than they were in everything except color. Despite having an ABV of 10%, it doesn't taste like that much."
"Overall, the smoke and peat overpowered this one. Not so drinkable. I wasnâ€™t a big fan and dumped this one."
"For a beer, this is pretty decent, although perhaps a bit too sweet. But, I believe it is a pretty poor interpretation of the style. If I was given this with no introduction, I'd have to say it was trying to be a rauchbier. Honestly, a bit of a disappointment."
"I am really surprised at this. Probably my favorite Sam Adams offering is the Scotch Ale so I don't know how this sibling could have been so off."
"When I opened the bottle I saw the ultra-dark red I welcome of scotch ales along with the tan cap. The aroma by itself was almost enough to knock me back into my chair, thick with whiskey and caramel. The taste is similarly robust, with the whiskey being the main characteristic blending in caramel and maybe some pine and melon. The body is overly thick for the style. There's an alcohol sting that lingers mid-tongue that I find distracting. In summation, this brew is over-engineered, having more ingredients and complexity than necessary. It was good to try but I don't see myself going out of my way to get another one."
"Smelled/tasted like malts and scotch. On the one hand, I suppose that is what should be expected of this style, on the other, it was a bit over the top and wasn't overly drinkable. If I am going back to this category, for the same money, I'll go for Founders Dirty Bastard each and every time. I was disappointed here because I really like most of Sam Adam's lineup... maybe with some age this would improve."
"Overall, Sam Adams might be the biggest craft brewery but they are still putting some consistant great flavors into their beers (well this one at least). Pretty solild scotch ale. Thanks Benny"
"O-not a very attractive beer nor is it very aromatic. The tsate is fine but a bit on the sweet side. Not bad. This is not a style that I drink often so I have few scotch ales to compare"
"The body is creamy and full bodied, thick, cloying and syrupy. Woody tones in the finish. Heavy indeed. Quite cloying. A tssty overboard sweet malt bomb burning sipper. If you can ride this bull keep your tounge in check for the burn. Probably more enjoyable before drinking too many others. It can easily put you on your ass."
"Deep, dark red-brown beer with caramel-colored head. Almost the color of cola, but even darker. Smells earthy and of caramel and florals. Smoky caramel and peat flavor, sweet sassafras and fruit as well. Very thick and creamy, no harshness from the high alcohol content."
"As a highly flavored barley wine, I think it's great. My second time tasting a bottle. It may not be on the style button but it's exremely drink-- I mean sippable."
"Poured into a squat snifter, this is a very dark, almost black beer, with a substantial, dense head atop it. The nose has features a nice peatiness. However, there's not much malt complexity in the aroma, and it's a tad ""hot"" as well. The flavor is a bit better. Alcohol is present, but not as as warm as I had feared. However, it lacks the malty complexity of a good wee heavy. It's drinkable, but rather one-dimensional."
"O- a solid american example of the style. something im glad is made year round and available in four packs. ill be having this again."
"Overall: I like it, but the sweetness becomes a bit much and the alcohol would definitely limit too much in any one sitting, and I probably wouldn't put one away to age due to the already massive sweetness."
"Rich flavors of dark malt, hints of root beer, smoke and leather, subtle peat smoked malt, mild bitterness. Moderate mouthfeel, a bit watery, slight warming from the ABV, could use more body. Tasty overall, but lacking a bit i complexity and body."
"O: Great for sipping. 4"
"D - A definite sipper of a Wee Heavy... The 10% ABV packs a pretty good punch... Slightly above average with a stellar mouthfeel..."
"I remember the old/original (bottled at least) SA Scotch Ale & I believe it was better, but it's been more than a few years..."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of burnt caramel and toffee, but it is quite weak. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with a harsh alcohol burn in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a beer I will probably not drink again. It is one dimensional, and the alcohol is poorly integrated."
"Very deep mahogany in the glass that goes ruby red when held up to a light. The head is a khaki tan full of fine bubbles that settle relatively quickly and then lace a bit. Smell is of caramelized sugar smoky and deep. Peated malt is there as well as a bit of chocolate and black malts. The taste is of black coffee and dark malts. The alcohol is very upfront in this beer and maybe a bit too much so. I'm not getting as much of the caramel that I would expect from a Wee Heavy as this beer tends towards the dry end of the spectrum. This beer is pretty lively in the mouth the finish is a bit prickly as a combination of higher carbonation than I'm used to for this style and the alcoholic hotness leave a lasting tingle. This is a good beer but maybe not great. I guess I'm just partial to the wee heavy that I make which tends to be a bit less alcoholic and a touch sweeter with a higher caramel focus and as I'm missing those characteristics I can't rate this example very highly."
"(12oz bottle). Pours a dark mahogany-almost burnt caramel. Khaki colored head. Aroma has caramel, peat, and with a hint of chocolate. Taste is sweet with some light hop bitterness and great peaty smoke. Medium bodied with slick texture. Smooth finish. This is a very nice beer."
"Poured dark brown with a light tan head. Overall I thought the beer was tasty and technically on point, but not as deep and complex as the great wee heavys. The aroma was a bit hot, but otherwise the flavor was a tight mix of bready fruit (like jam on dark toast) with caramel and fruit. I appreciated that it wasn't too thick or sweet, but was also surprised that the ABV hit double digits."
"Quality sipper/night capper."
"Pours a dark, almost blood-like color, nice little head to it. Aroma is of figs or dark fruit. Taste is medium to heavy bodied, nice creamy mouthfeel. This beer is 10% ABV and the alcohol can definitely be detected. The dark fruit really comes through, doesn't really strike me as a 'wee heavy' though. There isn't the usual smokiness in it, I would relate it to more of a Belgian or strong ale almost. A little bit of a rough finish, but for the most part a nice beer to sip and savor. Not my favorite Sam Adams by any means and they missed the style a little bit, but glad I gave it a try."
"O: a good beer that I would buy again if the mood for a good wee heavy struck, but not one I'll be getting everyday."
"Pretty good. I like that it has that peat-like quality, but if you are going to do it, it should be all out and this one plays it a little safe."
"Fantastic beer, and I suspect it ages well. I'll check back after a couple of years"
"not bad. not great. I've been kind of disappointed in the Sam Adams Imperial Series, it almost seems like they shouldn't even bother if they are going to play their ""imperial"" beers safely."
"O - I should know better than to expect great beers from Sam Adams, and this one confirmed my expectations. Unfortunately, this beer lacks character, and flavor profile. Maybe cellar-aging this one might do it some good."
"Overall: Skip this and the $10 for this 6-pack. In fact, Samuel Adam's Scotch Ale is WAY better than this, but they no longer offer that in 6 packs. My rule of thumb...pass over Samuel Adams beers because they are average at best. Cheers!!"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is that of peat smoke, dark fruit and some toffee. The flavor is more complex than the aroma. I get a lot of peat smoke, cherries, grapes, plums, toffee and some alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nicely balanced wee heavy where the alcohol is present, but not overpowering. Very drinkable."
"overall this imperial wee heavy lacks in refinement, but makes up for it in depth of character and being approachable, despite it's massive ABV. it's warm, snuggly and feels good."
"I will drink this one again, but it won't be my first choice."
"Pours a solid dark brown with deep ruby highlights when held to light. Small tan head dissipates slowly. Smell is very malty and sweet, I swear I smell Leather, Hints of burnt sugar & Smoke. Taste is sweet with all of the aromas accounted for in the taste. Starts off sweet with the syrupy malt and smoke, then leaves a long lingering mild alcohol burn at the end. Seems typical of the Sam Adams imperial series to be a bit hot with alcohol. Very little hop presence to be found. Pretty good Scotch Ale, there are others better, but Sam usually has ""Good"" not ""Great"" Brews."
"O-A nice Scotch ale from BBC. I'd buy this again."
"Overall pretty good, a decent wee heavy, and I'm glad to see a wee heavy that actually is wee heavy, not a measly 6.5% kinda thing, it does get a bit of boozy phenols, and I'm not a huge fan of the herbal hops but that goes with the style, overall pretty good."
"Full mouthfeel, sticky, almost syrupy. Tiny bubble carbonation creates a nice balance. Alcohol warmth is present."
"Poured a nice thick copper color with a bit of initial decent head and a bit of initial decent lacing. Some nice thick malty scents, with a hint of caramel and a little toffee, but not near as much aroma as one would expect from a thick wee heavy. Decent taste, nice thickness in the malt, some caramel and toffee, just a hint of peat, a bit of nice earthy hops at the end, but overall nothing very upfront; mostly just a thick beer with quite a bit of alcohol heat. It goes down alright, but doesn't hide the 10% ABV at all. I'd drink another if given one, but there are much better Scotch/Scotch-style ales out there that aren't any more expensive."
"Careful pour yielded a small but dense, creamy colored head that dissipated slowly. The color below is certainly dark, but slightly red in tint against light. Smell isn't very significant, just a subdued earthiness that jives well with the flavor. The taste itself is quintessential of a basic wee heavyâ€”earthy peatiness, a bit of spice, and an overall full-bodied flavor. The mouthfeel is quite thick, between the strong flavors and high alcohol it is exactly what is expected."
" Grade A Purchased at Stoney's -- $11.99 per 4-pack"
"at first I could not place the taste, then the scotch ale flavor came through very strong. not as strong as the other SA Imperial Series have been, but a very good, very drinkable beer. got mine (4-pack) for $10.99 at the 'Mo. a complex brew, with lots of malty and barley notes."
"Overall: I love the balance, the integration of peat-smoked malt, and maybe even the overall flavor, but I can't get past that I want this beer to have more (and that what I want it to have is so common among beers of this style). I'll probably even buy this again, but I imagine that I'll still think the beer isn't quite reaching its potential."
"A nice, nice beer here. A few months of age would help mellow the alcohol and improve the overall beer in my opinion. Right now though, this is a beer that is right on for the style and a good all around beer."
"12oz. bottle served in my Maudite tulip. Pours slightly darker than cola with a creamy, half inch, khaki-colored head that dissipates in the center and disperses towards the shoulders. Head eventually settles into a thin band and some strands of lacing are evident during the tasting, but no legs. Nose suggests dark fruit and a slightly earthy character, as well as some malty sweetness. Taste is much bolder and robust than suggested by the nose - a smokey/earthy/peaty character intersperses itself in throughout the malty backbone and the dark fruit peaks through towards the front and middle. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with a lively, almost prickly carbonation that lightly burns the sides of the cheeks and the back of the throat. This is a really nice wee heavy, probably my favorite from the SA Imperial series so far. I'd love to see what a couple years does for this brew."
"Nice and sweet without going overboard and dangerously drinkable."
"overall i think this is an OK brew. (E for effort?) some elements about it are worthwhile while others i could do without, but ultimately it just doesn't rise to challenge some of the better scotch ales/wee heavies out there."
"Thick and rich body, chewy, lots of potent sweetness that finishes dry and has a very boozy taste through the whole thing. It's not bad and definitely worth trying, but honestly I was expecting something more refined and complex. Some of the flavors are so overpowering that it's hard to discern much beyond them."
"Highly enjoyable drinking experience regardless - this is definitely a brew to warm up a bit, pour into a goblet and then sit back and enjoy. The mouthfeel doesn't disappoint and the peat smoke is interesting enough to keep your attention for at least one beer, maybe two."
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a tan head. In the aroma, coffee roast and a small hint of alcohol. In the taste, coffee, alcohol, and a small presence of a dry peet/ earthiness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry malt and small alcohol like aftertaste. A bit hot from alcohol, but a nice roast."
"You may want to stash it away for 3 months or so and try it again. It will only reveal the true character within."
"O: Not a terrible effort, but doesn't have the elegance or balance of something like Traquair or Skullsplitter which are malty beers for sure, but remain immensely drinkable, and the sugar does not go over the tops."
"A decent wee heavy but doesn't blow me away. Very solid malt presence and a touch of peat/smoke. Very malt driven needs a bit more earthy flavors to it."
"To date, I haven't been blown away by and of the Sam Adams Imperial Series. Wee Heavy doesn't change that. Having said that, it's not bad beer. It could easily be improved with a stronger nose and less of a sweet, sugary flavor. Maybe a little less alcohol, too. It holds up pretty well otherwise. Not a bad beer, not a great beer. Fits in well with the rest of the Imperial Series."
"Overall this is great beer. Sweet, but good. I'm going to enjoy the 4 of em."
"Thanks to mike d. for hooking me up with a free bottle. Poured into my Sam Adams Double Bock glass. Dark brown, almost black color. Pretty thick white head, and a great amount of lacing. Smell had a mild campfire aroma to it. I liked the flavor a lot actually. It had a thick peaty smoky flavor, along with a smooth dark chocolate flavor also. Reminded me more of a smoked beer than a wee heavy. Maybe SA went a bit overboard with that element. Mouthfeel was on the cloying side due to the sweetness, but it had an overall enjoyable body. For a 10% beer, it went down fairly smoothly. I liked it because it was a smoked scotch ale; a unique take. The bottle recommends some aging, so that would be an interesting path to take if I were to get more of this beer."
"O: I was a little hesitant to try the Sam Adams specialty beers (as I tend to stick to the micros) but this is actually pretty good. A nice beer good for sipping but can sneak up on you very quickly."
"Overall - Definitely a good beer, I like this alot more than the other Scotch Ales I've had."
"O - I was expecting a lot more from Sam Adams."
"Overall this beer would be perfect for a cold day and is quite tasty. I actually like this one a little better than their other Scotch ale, which though is good, this has a little more ""umfph"" to it which makes it more enjoyable. Only thing I would change would be the overall smoke flavor to make it more prevalent but was happy I seeked out this beer"
"O - Overall a bit different then what I was expecting. I'm not typically a fan of ""smoky"" traits, but I think in this beer it is appropriately leveraged against the malty, sweet nature. I was glad to have tried it, but I'm not likely to revisit. It's not bad, it's just not going to be worth 10.99 a four pack."
"D/O: This would be perfect on a snowy day. A heavy, hearty beer that is a major malt bomb, but there's nothing wrong with that. The only real downfall for this beer is the metallic element that is present in both the smell and taste and the fact that the smoke isn't nearly as present in this beer than in their scotch ale, which was my favorite part of that beer and in the style"
"Overall I think this beer is a decent Wee Heavy, definitely not my favorite but it has potential. After a year or 2 i think this beer might really surprise some people."
"Kind of astonished how good this was, how much I enjoyed it. Authentic? No... But fine all the same. Of the smoky domestic wee heavies I've sampled, this could possibly be the best. And what's strange is that, if you close your eyes, taste blind, you could almost mistake it for a Russian Imperial Stout. Of course, the nature of the peat-smoked malt versus more of a roasted malt in an RIS gives it away - its malt characteristics are quintessentially of a caramelly Scotch Ale. For what it offers, well done."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a cola-like dark brown with an off-white one finger head that leaves lacing as it settles into a modest collar. Hard to gauge the carbonation level of a beer to dark to see through. Aroma is of sweet, smoky malt...hints of caramel, toffee, and the smoked peat described on the label. The aroma of alcohol is also present, the way it would be in a single malt scotch. 1st sip brings everything promised on the nose...caramel, toffee, smoky peat, and alcohol. There is a silky smoothness on the tongue, with a solid mouthfeel. Light hints of the smoke & alcohol linger on an otherwise clean finish. Drinkability is quite good for a beer with such a big abv wallop, but these are obviously sippers, not chuggers. Overall, another very good offering from Boston Beer Company, an increasingly underappreciated brewery IMHO, although I can't understand why!"
"Future outlook: Best Sam Adams product I've had in some time...probably time to try out some of their other imperial line that I've passed on for awhile..."
"Extremely dark mahogany color, small-sized head dissolves to an even thinner lacing. Lots of malt sweetness and a peppery alcohol. Syrup-like mouthfeel; the palate is grazed by some gritty crispness. Massive malt sweetness is almost cloying, and the hint of peat smoke nearly pushes it over the edge. Bitterness from the modest hopping can't even break through, yet there's some oily herbal flavor in the middle. Sweetness sticks even when the warming spicy alcohol hits the palate. A decent stab at the style, but the excessive sweetness throws it off balance a bit--still worth a try."
"The whole imperial series lacks finesse but while this one is the type of bruisin' ale that is going to hit you with the alcohol and peated malts that you should expect in a Wee Heavy, in this case think the heat of a single malt with the peated malt roasted dark caramel notes found in this beer. Pours nicely into an Allagash chalice, deep ruby brown almost black if your sitting in the shade, you really have to hold this one toward the light. Flavor, first off the booze really coats the sides of my cheeks and the backend of the palate, when I'm able to cope with the booze level I come up with dark roasted malts almost coffee astringency, dark roasted peat smoked malts with hints of dark chocolate. Complex for sure even a bit of sherry tartness, full bodied a bit of heat cinges your nose hairs, but overall a complex beer to share with good friends. I'm going to hold on to a couple of these beers and wait for the pearl to form."
"D/O: Very strong but doesn't overpower. I feel like they didn't do enough for the style. I could have used it having more smoke. Still a very good strong beer."
"A deep red almost black color with a head that doesn't show up until the end of the pour, but remains there thinly for a while afterwards. Smells of some strong sweet malts and booze and generally tastes similar. Reminiscent of my dad's scotch collection in fact. It's boozy and sweet, like a much less strong peaty highlands scotch. I bet it would age well also. Very complex with some sweet malts that complement the alcohol and scotch-like mouthfeel. Booziness threatens to overwhelm the taste buds (and does so when I taste scotch) but this manages to fit fairly well in beer form. I think this is the strongest scotch ale I've tried and I like the idea of the higher ABV mimicking the scotch mouthfeel rather than only the taste. Good beer, glad I tried it."
" As I first poured the SA Wee Heavy it had a very rich deep dark reddish brown hue. It poured with a thin cream colored head that quickly dissipated. My initial nosing struck me that it did not smell very far off from several scotch whiskies I have nosed. The maltiness comes through with a subtle smokiness that became more evident as the brew warmed slightly. The initial taste is the sweetness of malt, but not overly sweet. Wee Heavy is surpisingly easy to knock back given it's higher ABV, and I could be in for some trouble. It was very nice and almost chewy on the palate and the higher alcohol content did not translate into that ""boozyiness"" that can sometimes get in the way of the other flavors. Overall this is a very nice brew that will never dissapoint."
"This beer pours a thick brown color with a finger of tan head that leaves a little lacing on it's way down. The aroma is complex, with hints of roasted barley, peat and smokey fruit. The taste starts with some hints of figs and smoked peat, then finishes with a caramelly roasted barley sweetness. The mouthfeel starts a little harsh with overcarbonation, but finishes with a velvety feel. Overall a good scotch ale."
"This beer has great character and deep flavors. The alcohol was screaming through this beer. It had nice low level bitterness. There was no hiding it. It actually develops levels of flavors but was on the verge of taking them over."
"Cheers!"
"A nice brew. I find myself almost utterly lost now when grading American wee heavy. I'm not much for 'grading to style' - if a beer is good its good - but when American breweries say wee heavy and scotch ale I expect Traquair, Bellhaven, Orkney; yet they never come too close to those brews which I love. I think I've given up on finding an American equivalent..."
"Poured the bottle into a glass. A decent amount of foam was formed. The beer has a dark amber look to it. The smell is malty and sweet. This beer has many layers of flavor. The first to hit the tongue is malt, with a rich almost chocolate flavor. The finish leaves with a lasting enjoyable flavor. Would be good as an after dinner drink. Cheers."
"Good stuff, and should be readily obtainable if it remains a regular part of the series."
"M/D: Soft, even creamy, on the palate. Nice mouthfeel. minimal carbonation. Overall a good brew. I would be interested to try this side by side Sam Adams Scotch Ale."
"A bit creamy on the mouth but none to thick at all to keep this from being crazily drinkable for a 10 percent ABV beer."
"D: Easy as hell for a 10%abv. A great addition to the Imperial Series."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic, reddish/amber color with a medium white head, light lacing. The aroma has sweet malts, hints of smoke. The flavor is sweet toffee, hints of smoke, no alchohol. The body is full, decent carbonation. A very nice beer, dangerously drinkable for a 10% brew."
"D-Extremely drinkable, leaves behind a great after taste. Possibly the best beer Sam Adams brews, haven't had the rest of their Imperial Series but this could be there best offering."
"I wouldn't put this beer in any other category, but for a wee heavy I found it too tilted toward the hops. A very nice beer once you know what to expect."
"Drinkability - it's a bit strong for repeated drinking, and not very complex, but not bad tasting either."
"the drink ability is there surprisingly....has much more drink ability than the other imperial beer by sam...."
"Gotta have more."
"Saw this one on the singles shelf today at the Whole Foods, and figured it was cheaper than the four pack so...anyways, it pours a very, very dark brown (nearly black) color, with a big 2 fingers of light brown foam. Aromas of plums, raisins and burnt sugar. On the palate, fairly full bodied and phenolic, with plums, raisins, brown sugar and peat smoke."
"The flavor is a little bit one dimensional, and a bit disappointing after the complex aroma, but this is still a pretty solid beer, and a nice sipper for a cold winter night."
"1312"
"Pours a solid dark brown with deep ruby highlights when held to light. Smallish khaki head dissipates like the bubbles atop a diet soda. Smell is very malty and sweet. Hints of burnt sugar, melanoids, and peat smoke dominate my nostrils. Taste is sweet with all of the aromas accounted for in the taste. Starts off sweet hits with the peat and smoke, then leaves a long lingering alcohol burn at the end. Seems typical of the Sam Adams imperial series to be a bit hot with alcohol. Very little hop presence to be found. I fear that if one were to wait for the alcohol to die down you would be left with a sweet cloying mess of a beer. Sweet syrupy mouthfeel, full body, light level of carbonation. This one is only ok, I could take it or leave it."
"The beer pours a beautiful ruby red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is epic! This is what a Scotch ale should smell like. It has a wonderful burnt toffee scent along with a HUGE peated malt aroma. The smokey character is really nice. The taste is also quite good. It has a solid malt flavor of burnt toffee and crystal malts as well as a big smoked malt taste. I'm really diggin' the bold smokey character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one of best beers Sam Adams has ever put out. Why go mainstream? Hit me with the smoke and keep it coming. What a delicious beer!"
"The feel was not too heavy, it did have a bit of a bit but went down well and had little aftertaste. A good beer for an experimental beer."
