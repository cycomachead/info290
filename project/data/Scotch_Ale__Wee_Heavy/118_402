3.67,-10,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Appearance - pours amber/ copper with small head, slight carbonation was foggy when poured however became increasingly clear once it warmed up. Aroma - Earthy aroma. Taste - all I can taste is the fig. Feel - has a warmth to it that I do appreciate, quite smooth, has astringent elements to it. Overall - appearance and taste do put me off, not a beer that I would drink again, however I think it is more a case of me not appreciating the beer style than the actual beer. Brewer appears interesting and I would try other products.","50wolves","Mar 15, 2015"

Skull Splitter pours a hazy amber with a smooth head, the lacing is quite appealing with tiny distinct bubbles and falls away quickly.  The nose is unmistakably dark, sugared fruits - plum and fig and perhaps the best part if this beer, although the taste is delectable.  Smooth, sweet malts and a warm boozy finish.  It begs to be drank and I concede.  I find this beer quite enjoyable cold.  My first Wee Heavy and I'm officially in love.  Happy Valentine's Day!","Foxybrau","Feb 13, 2015"

Nose of dark fruit (figs, dates), and caramel over a scotch like alcohol background. Full bodied with a rich and creamy texture. Low carbonation level. Tremendous flavor profile that is complex and balanced. It begins with a scotch like note that flows into the dark fruits. In the middle caramel is predominate as the scotch fades. The finish hints of the previous dark fruits and caramel which fade into a nice alcohol tingle that lingers. An Outstanding Wee Heavy that is alcohol focused.","tillmac62","Jul 07, 2014"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/8/2012. Pours fairly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, fig, plum, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, raisin, fig, plum, toast, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice scotch ale. All around good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 18, 2014"

4.01,-1.7,4.5,4,4,3.75,4,"Skull Splitter poured a clear, dark red-hued copper colour, with distinct ruby highlights and some orange around the edges when backlit. Pouring produced a thin, off-white head that quickly faded to an even thinner ring of foam around the glass, leaving almost no spotting or lacing behind it. Its aroma was primarily of dark fruits and alcohol, with the taste dominated by sweet malts, dark cherries and alcohol. The alcohol gives off some slight heat in the taste, but not enough to overpower the other flavours. Skull Splitter had a moderate bitterness in the finish that countered the initial sweetness of the malts and dark cherries well. I would describe the beer as surprisingly light bodied given its alcohol content, with a distinctly low level of carbonation. Overall, Skull Splitter is flavourful, quite well balanced, and well suited to consumption on a -10C night. At $3.30 per 330 ml bottle, Skull Splitter is perhaps a bit on the pricey side, but not outrageously so. I would certainly drink this beer again.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

A nice cold-weather sipping ale, would be wonderful with a bowl of chili and cornbread or a Sunday roast beef dinner. I could see this at table replacing a bottle of Merlot, as it has a depth and character that would carry quite well with a hearty and seasoned meal. By itself it's also fine, but I think it'd be better with food. The label graphics and where it's brewed drew me to try it. I would definitely buy it again as I enjoy a rich, low-hops, flavorful ale.","ThisLadyLovesBeer","Jan 11, 2014"

Its a solid choice for any beer drinking purpose whether that be food accompaniment, thirst, social outing, or relaxation. Skull Splitter is a take you away from every day monotony kind of beer. This beer lets you know its quitting time, so if you have one on your lunch break…ummm…you should probably take a half day and not go back to work.

3.94,-3.4,3.75,4,4,4,3.75,"in many ways the quintessential scotch ale, although not my favorite one out there. it pours a syrupy dark bock color, dense, with a small off white head showing very little carbonation. the nose is peaty but not smoky like some tend to be. its alcohol is obvious, and its sweet grain is saturated with a toasted aroma and a very earthy vibe. no hops to speak of. the taste is like birch syrup or something lighter and a little less sweet than maple. the texture is like that too. earthy, right from the soil sort of autumn compost heaviness really challenges me in warmer weather, but I am imagining a cold snowy night in front of a fire, a much more enjoyable setting for this brew. I love the grain features, complex and rich. the feels is odd, but I like it. its thick, almost sticky in my mouth, lacking carbonation. American scotch ales have bastardized this intentional weight with high carbonation gimmicks and lighter grain bills, but this feels more authentic, although very heavy and hard to drink a whole bottle. it improves as it warms, and just takes me to the dead of winter. its a nice beer, but not the first scotch ale I would reach for, even though its authenticity is appreciated.","StonedTrippin","Jun 15, 2013"

Aroma is faint, but sweet and fruity with floral hops. First sip is surprisingly hoppy right from the start with an even more bitter aftertaste with a distinct sour note; much like the sour of some Belgian Dubbels. Purposely cupping the glass in my hands to warm it some, the malt flavors are coming through. Raisins and tart cherry flavors with a hint of molasses. Still a long-lasting bitter aftertaste and the sour note is still present, but less pronounced. Definitely getting better as it warms up. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a little more carbonation than I like, but not bad. A bit dry.

Plenty of sweet fruit in the aroma and flavour, along with a hefty slug of booze. The only minor let-downs are the absence of live yeast and a slightly sub-par body. I think bottle conditioning would allow for an interesting flavour evolution. Nonetheless, this is a top-notch wee heavy that is well worth sampling.

About a one-finger eggshell white head that dissipates quickly and leaves on a smattering of lacing.Very earthy and malt forward aroma. The malt presents both a sweet caramel and bread-like characteristic. Only the slightest note of hops.The flavor is very rich and malty, as expected. The dense malt flavors are accompanied by an almost sour taste that is close to orange peel, but comes through only in small doses. A minor bit of chocolate in the background.The mouthfeel is of medium thickness and does present a bit of alcohol but not to the boozy level.

Not to mention the fact that - at its LCBO price point, at least - it's a virtual steal, especially given the difficulty of finding quality scotch ales in most of the province.

Plenty of carbonation. Smell has aromas of cherry and dark rum. The flavor was delicious. Plenty of notes of fresh plums and fig, with a gentle sweetness coming from the malt. Mouthfeel was on the thin side for a scotch ale. Never would have guessed the abv at 8.5%.

Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruits, burnt caramel/toffee, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, burnt caramel, dark fruit, and some earthy, herbal hop flavors. There is an alcohol kick and a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

It borrows mild characteristics from that of Trappist Rochefort, yet still remains less heavy (certainly less bready) and a little more scotch flavored. Very well balanced with lots of interesting dark fruits to enjoy. This straddles the line between Belgian strong ale and scotch ale, while still representing elements of a Barley Wine. I would not classify this as a ""Scotch Ale"" as it has been above. I feel like that's a tad bit inaccurate, but that's just me. Enjoy!","Agent1","Apr 28, 2012"

3.5,-14.2,4.5,4.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall I thought that was an ok beer and I thought that it was a pretty average example of a Wee Heavy, it had a great look and aroma, but the taste seemed lackluster, it was like a very watered down version of aroma and that really held this beer back. This beer isn't that drinkable, with some warming alcohol and a high amount of sweetness, one bottle is just a little more then I would want. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both great. What I liked least about this beer was the taste, it was a let down and compared to the aroma it seemed watered down and rough around the edges. I wouldn't buy this beer again, they are plenty Wee Heavy's that I like more and are much cheaper, if you are really into the style it might be worth a try, but other then that I can't say I would recommend it. This was my first time trying a beer from Orkney, and I have to say I wasn't that impressed with and I wish the taste lived up to the aroma, so it didn't make for the best first impression, I would still try more of their beers, but I'm not too eager, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Apr 22, 2012"

A great alternative to a shot of single malt at the end of the day. More of a sipping beer, although two or three across a relaxing evening wouldn't be out of the question. Definitely worth having a four-pak in the fridge for appreciative guests. A sophisticated, amped version of the style.","BuckeyeSlim","Apr 04, 2012"

Along with Young's Old Nick one of the very 1st Scotch Ales I ever tried that made me seek out this wonderfully warming style. Poured into Duvel tulip a rich dark amber with a half an inch of dense head that has great retention. Smells of yeast, malt and dark fruits like plum, raisin and fig. Mouthfeel is good and spicy on the front end, retaining it's wonderful maltiness that almost has a peat like quality that mixes with the sweetness of the aforementioned fruits, a bit of yeast and good carbonation. Finishes spicy and velvety on the palate with the 8.5% abv being evident to be sure making it a wonderful winter warmer. I've always wondered about the listed abv of 8.5% as it seems higher and definitely lives up to it's name, Skullsplitter.","Blueribbon666","Feb 18, 2012"

Taste malty, dark molasses, fruits, spices with a touch of alcohol. Mouthfeel is sweet, rich, full body w/ good carbonation; warming. I really enjoyed this beer. Loved the color on it, aroma and taste were great, especially for being 8.5%. Definitely a beer I will be picking up again.","stalker5","Jan 10, 2012"

It smells like a complex array of malts, maybe a little dried fruit. Taste repeats the malt smells and also has a sweet and salty emphasis to them. Body is medium rich. This is kind of like a concentrated version of the Scoth ale style. And I'll add the price among imports wasn't too bad at all, and though I feared the SkullSplitter name was merely marketing it actually turned out to be deserving of it, both historically and due to the higher alcohol level.","MoreThanWine","Dec 30, 2011"

The bitterness then magnifies and really shines at the far end and lingers in the mouth for a few seconds. The mouthfeel is great. The body is dense and smooth, but not too thick.

5,22.5,5,5,5,5,5,"My first A+ review and a perfect choice for the first night that required the furnace. Very dark amber with a beige head that gradually dissipated and stuck somewhat to my thistle glass. Smell is all the wonderful things you get from a fruit cake (even that little bit of alcohol you get from a brandy infused one). Taste is a pleasant sweetness that slowly fades to a clean semi sweet finish, thanks to the hops that only slightly bitter. Candied cherry is the headliner, followed by some almond nuttiness and a definite Sherry earthiness and warmth. The unmasked alcohol helps to highlight all the complexities in this warmer. Don't let the Viking theme and name lead you to believe this beer is just a novelty. This is indeed one world class brew.","Justin23060","Sep 16, 2011"

Big, complex flavor: toasted bread, sweet caramel, brown sugar, dried black cherries, raisins, figs, spiced rum, and smoked peat emerging in the background. Some alcohol bite pervades throughout.

I now suggest you try a Guinness stout Skullsplitter blend when you find that the Scottish ale can either be a bit too intense for first beer of the day or you feel that the flavor of the ale sometimes fails to bloom without the help of the Guinness lace left on the glass. So, I recommend you try a Red & Black with a base of Guinness draft, which can be a mixture to suit your mood and taste; from barely there to a 50/50 mix. You be the judge.

Malt then nutty, then some bitterness to balance the sweetness, hints of smoke. As the beer warmed, more alcohol came through. The beer left the mouth slightly dry. Very light carbonation.

The aroma is rich, dry, malty, cherry-fruity, delicately smoky and swampy - it vaguely resembles an altbier as well. For the style, the flavor is big and bold - absolutely perfect. Alcohol barely intrudes, if at all. No over-hopping nor over-smokiness. At its core, whiskey, cherry, and burnt wood lead the flavors, nougat and butter-cookie at times, with a lightly sweet, mostly dry, tobacco-lined aftertaste. Man flavors. The feel is nearly flawless - moderate density, motor-oil smooth. This is the best goddamn Scotch Ale in existence, and that statement is only marginally influenced by the bad-ass label and tale about the namesake.

There's a dense, opaque body the color of cloudy iced tea, and then there's taste-- flavors of oak, vanilla, fruit, malt, bread and even some carrots (?) just burst from the glass as if the beer were being sprung from a corset five sizes too small. Not as smoky as other scotch ales, but there's a hint of peat pulsating in the background which keeps the hops in check. Looks strikingly handsome in a thistle, too.

3.98,-2.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Found this 11.2 ounce bottle of Scottish brew nearly two years ago and it's been sitting unrefrigerated in my rather warm garage ever since. Hoping that the 8.5% ABV will have preserved it, this one pours a rosy mahogany color, clear except for the ton of large floaties that blanket throughout. The head is decent sized but settles to a very firm oatmeal colored cover and outstanding lacing. I give it a sniff and find big malt with a cabernet raisin overtone, almost a pineapple ham sweetness, quite interesting and likable. Then the first taste reveals that the garage did not ruin this beauty. A smooth malt with more of the tart red wine idea as noted in the aroma. The pineapple idea again suggests sweet ham and damn if this isn't awfully drinkable for the buzz level. This is beautifully smooth as a medium to full bodied concoction, not quite resinous but close. If there is any knock here it's that it's so sweet and therefore might be a little less drinkable than first thought. Cheese proves a great complement here. But the flavor is complex with some nuttiness and chocolate hints, with toffee/malt all over it. Finely but adequately carbonated. Too sweet to be a perfect brew to me but perhaps it is somewhat due to my poor storage habits here. Still, this is a fine taste experience. Please add some cheese! Good stuff.","Durge","Jan 04, 2010"

Brown in color with really no head, but some very faint prickle. Malt nose with perhaps a hint of grain or some hops but it reads very subtly. Robust and malty attack. As robust as an average beer can be, I say. Sweet malty flavor, perhaps this sweetness takes away from that robustness. Its a little thick in the mouth like a syrup. Some of kind of dark fruit in the background of the flavor and some nut flavors swirling around as well. A little boozy, but not really. . . drink it and you'll see what I mean. It doesn't hide from its sweet maltiness for sure. Definitely not something you would knock back 3 or 4 of. Perhaps that is why it came in a 4 pack.

Overall this was very flavorful and tasty! It was clean and hid the alcohol well, so it was very easy to drink. It had good body, but could have been a bit heavier to match the big flavor. This was reminiscent of the Eggenberg Doppelbocks, which is definitely a good thing! I didn't see a date on the bottle, so I'm not sure if this was aged? The huge malt character definitely makes me think it could have been. If it's already this sweet fresh, I can't imagine what another couple years would do to it.

It has a very light looking color compared with some other wee heavys I've drank. It smells and tastes very sweet. I can't quite place the flavor although it seems give me the feeling of a warm fire; a sort of woodlike smoothness, not like the flavor associated with a bourbon barrel, but smooth.

Medium-bodied, given the sweetness of the flavors was expecting more body and heft but moves gracefully. Chocolate coated malt balls, creamed coffee, brown sugar and honey with candied orange slices. The fruit flavors plum, black grape, cherry, however, they recede through the mid-palate and allow the carbonation to provide a drier, smoother mouth texture.

On a side note, this beer really doesn't do a lot of skullsplitting despite its name. It's a smooth malty beer. I get that it's a ""strong"" style and it's stronger than common beers, but it's a fairly mellow beer that masks its alcohol content well. Actually, it's not even the taste that makes me think the name is silly but the bottle. It just looks tiny. It's narrow and tall and only 11.2 oz for some reason (maybe, that's standard in other parts of the world but it's odd to me). I think Mike's Hard Lemonade is 11.2, also, and that's just a poor association. I'm sure that there are tons of great beers in 11.2 oz bottles, but this one just feels silly with its little viking (or Scot warrior, whatever(oh, just read the back and it is a viking)) picture and red foil fanciness. I know this is completely off-topic. I like the beer, but I think that I'll pour it and toss the bottle in the future. Right now, that tiny little viking is staring at me and all I can think about is him coming alive and having a tiny squeaky voice. It's sort of unfortunate that I just tried Budweiser's American Ale because it's a very similar bottle but normal-sized, which is probably contributing to my obsession with this bottle's size. Come to think of it, there are definitely other strong beers in little bottles. I really don't get it.

It's a soft, complex sweetness with caramel, malt, maybe a bit of vanilla too. Mouth is moderate on the lighter side for a malty, sweet beer. This is one of it's highlights.

Thick oily chewy mouthfeel, though a bit too much carbonation for my taste. Very rich, yet balanced. The hops do their job. I'm left with a bitter hop and tingly alcohol sensation. ad a powerful dryness seems to wipe it all away and then vanishes itself for a clean finish. Let it warm up for full effect.

4.32,5.9,4.5,5,4,4.5,4,"SkullSplitter is a delight of a beer. A strong Scottish ""Wee Heavy"" that is sweet and flavorful and full on many different levels. Scottish Ales are generally all the same; dark malt-bomb beers which are rich and full of caramel, raisin, and dark fruit flavors. The varieties of Scottish ales are typically listed by price. Not dollars and cents, but in the old-school unused currency the shilling. Now Scottish beers are typically listed as 60 shilling, or 70 shilling, the price goes up as the alcohol and malt increases. That brings us to SkullSplitter. At the top of the shilling pile are ""wee heavy's"" the kingpin big daddy of the Scottish ales. These have the most malt character and the most alcohol, and tend to be the most complex and satisfying of all if the Scottish beers. SkullSplitter delivers on all counts. The smell alone is worth a few shillings easy, and for the taste I'd chip in another couple of bucks. To think, I've looked past this beer for years without giving it a thought.

This makes drinkablity easier.","czfreeman","Nov 16, 2007"

Finally got around to buying a single of this one tonight while I was on my trip up to knoxville and I was not dissapointed. Poured a very nice deeep dark brown with an ample two inch head of off white foamy lace on top. This had some very nice retention and left behind about a half inch of frothy white foam on the top when it was done. Very nice side glass lace as well. The smell was nice, although I have to say a little on thel ight side. A nice sweet caramel like aroma mixed in with ample earthy grains made for a full aroma, just a little light. The taste was really smooth. for 9%abv this was remarkable in that you could pick up none of the alcohol. It had a medium to full body that had a great creamy feel to it. Great flavors of caramel with a touch of grassy hops and a decent bread like back. It had a noticable nuttiness to it as well. Overall this was a very very nice beer and something I know I will go back to. It was just so rediculously smooth, I really could have had four or five of them, thugh I am sure it would have caught up to me before then.

On the palate, brisk carbonation kicks things off, followed by some nutty malts and just a touch of caramel-tinged fruits. Things are quite sweet and malty. Doughy, thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. This is a beer that is not too complex, but makes up for that in big flavors wrapped up in a smooth package.

The body is a caramelized brown color with reddish orange tones and tarnished gold highlights. Smell is mildly sweet and very malty. I get lots of caramel, bread, vanilla, biscuit, roasted barley, faint hints of rum, hops are very minimal in the aroma with a slight peppery note. Taste is very malt forward with tons of caramelization and hints of earth. Well balanced roasted barley with sweet malts, hints of rum and a slight oaked or wood flavor. The bitterness is minimal and gives just enough support to balance the sweet caramel flavor. The mouth feel is crisp, yet hearty enough to hold my interest. The alcohol is in the right place for the style, which limits this to only a couple beers in a session, but I enjoy it just the same.

It does have that slight grapefruit taste mixed with the caramel that I tasted which could be the hops I taste. the lacing on the glass continues on as well as you drink this.

The palate is some what sweet upfront, but quickly yielding to the aggressive hop presence in this wee heavy / Scotch beer. Slight citrus overtones toward the finish, along with the sweet fruitiness that creates a very nice compliment indeed. This beer is quite heavily carbonated and has a medium mouthfeel. Despite the ABV, the alcohol isn't predominant. Finish is dry. Over all, a very good ale. Quite drinkable, as the alcohol is well hidden.

Smell isn't as strong as I expected, but that's not necessarily bad. Taste is caramel, coffee, and vanilla. Some underlying fruit, apple or pear, subtle tones of banana. Hints of whiskey. Mouthfeel is rich without being too thick. Almost like a crisp syrup, if that makes sense. I can already feel the alcohol content creeping up, but it's hard to notice from the taste alone.

The color ranges from deep mahagony in the body to ruby red at the edges. It's a pretty looking ale, but it would be even prettier if the head hadn't been so thin and quick to dissipate. The nose is sweet and malty. Some prune and apple notes with hints of banana and maple syrup. Maybe some vanilla as well. Distant hints of black cherry. This is quite a tasty beer. The cherry makes a profound appearance here, hitting up front on the tongue. Subtler fruit flavors take over as the ale settles iin the mouth. I can definitely feel the heat here too. At 8.5% ABV, it's hard to hide, even with all the fruitiness. Malty banana floats around with prune, and a hoppy finish helps clear the palate in the finish. The complexity continues to expand as the beer warms up. An interesting ale, to be sure. The mouthfeel is a tad thinner than I would have imagined, but not weak. Overall, this is a tasty brew, though not one to be taken lightly. The high alcohol is present and noticeable, but not overpowering, and this badboy could really sneak up on a person. Split some skulls even, if they weren't careful.","Atlas1","Jan 22, 2007"

Taste is of oakiness, much like the aroma...maybe even go as far as saying tobacco flavors. Caramel tones, sweet malts, some cherries hidden in the mix as well. Ends very dry and a major alcohol punch. This beer doesn't do a very good job masking the ABV. Alcohol warming lingers with you for a bit. Mouthfeel is mildy heavy bodied, slippery until the finish comes in and slaps you with dryness. Carbonation feels pretty low, small bubbles that tingle the tongue a tad...has that pilsner carbonation quality to it.

I had high hopes and I guess I was expecting SA's Scotch Ale with a kick. This ale finishes with a taste of sweet toffee when frothed before swallowing.

Almost a little overpowering and distracting at first, but on the second taste when you know what to expect, its actually a rather pleasant smoky peat flavor, kind of like the flavor in a bottle of Laphroig scotch I have. Well balanced and a bit woodsy too. It has a medium body, syrupy and smooth, lightly warming, and low carbonation. This is not an every-day beer, but a very enjoyable one.

The taste again starts off with molasses and caramel sweetness, followed by some smoked peat, light floral hops, dark fruits (grapes, plums and dates), esters, and some mild ethanol.

There's definitely some RIS or Baltic Porter in this one. I've never had a Wee Heavy with those dark fruit notes like this.

More smoky earthy flavors start this off before sweet fruit notes come through. Light chocolate and caramel malt mix in. The alcohol seems pretty much hidden under all the malty layers.

These aromas also came out in the flavour with a slightly bitter finish preventing them from being cloying. The 8.5% ABV was only very subtly noticable.

As far as imported brew, this one has the best taste I have encountered thus far in my travels. Massive caramel malts punch in at the first shift. Their sweet tones lend heavily to the overall components. This crystal coated sugar flavor is the most dominant of all. Very clandestine hop flavors creep in to add accents, but never proclaim any authority. The finish remains smooth and sweet, non-bitter. I must say this old boy is quite tasty. Delightful toasty accents. No alcoholic overtones, just a sweet sipper with capabilities to split ones skull the f*ck open. Very robust and overpowering sweetness makes this a good drinker, but less than superb. A very good rep of the wee heavy style. No import off flavors which is the ultimate wink and nod for this old boy. A nice Celtic love juice to get loose. Cheese infested label and all. Arrrr!!!

This is a beer that I'll be sure to look for again.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 26, 2005"
3.67,-10,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from the 330ml bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Body is a deep, rich reddish brown, topped by a half-inch coffee-colored head that subsides pretty quickly. Initially I thought it smelled pretty nasty, like spilt lager, but after those esthers wore off, a nice pleasant aroma emerges. Sweet notes of dark fruit (dates? prunes?), brown sugar, roasted malt, and alcohol. Palate is rich and complex. A rich malty base is accented by a molasses-like sweetness, with a significant alcohol presence on the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, velvety, and a tad foamy, depending on how big your sip is. An interesting brew, originating from one of the most remote and mysterious locations on Earth.","ElGordo","Feb 20, 2005"

I do get a faint hint of caramel with a bit of alcohol. gotta admit that the body and taste of this beer was a bit of a let down, I was hoping for a little more thicker malt character and a decent ""scottish"" taste/aroma. seems pretty balanced and maybe a bit on the old side. still if it isn't a very nicely balanced beer and nothing really extraordinary about it.","shippos","Dec 06, 2004"

The taste is immeadiately smooth and satisfying with a massive dose of malt. Not as spicy as some Scotch ales, this had exceptional depth in its fruit flavors, the esters tasting mostly of raisin, fig, plum with a heavy sweetness of carmel.

The nose presented a rich set of aromas, including late-harvest grape, rye bread, Worcestershire sauce, raisin, sharp molasses, and a nice musty woodiness that held it together. Tasting the beer revealed a figgy-raisin roasted malt profile that pleased the tastebuds with accents of nutty-scotch and a subtle peat smokiness. The finish was lightly bittered with woody dry flavor. The flavors were well balanced and satisfying, and the alcohol remained completely hidden throughout. This rich ale was exceptionally smooth, with an appropriately full body. Skullspitter is a solid, well-crafted beer that was a delight to drink.

The sweet fruity taste had notes of apples, melons, toffee, and pears, the hops were floral and spicy, and the yeast provided earthy accents, however the emphasis was primarily on malt here. The overall taste was very similar to a Belgian Dubbel, except the hops are a bit stronger here, and the beer lacked the dusty powdery yeast that marks the Dubbles.

The taste is also very malty, but not overpowering at all. Toffee and caramel flow smoothly across the tongue, some nuttiness in there as well. Tiny touches of alcohol and hops on the finish.

Wow does this smell malty! and woodsy/smoky, like burning toffee or charred raisin skins... the smells become less bitter and more sweet with time and warmth, approaching frosted cereal grains and grape (?)--almost smells more like a doppelbock than a scottish ale... nosefeel expands in the alcoholic finish. Flavor starts out intensely smoky before being balanced out by a strong malt backbone... overall suggestions of maple syrup, charred oak, barley hulls, a touch of earth, and alcohol. Mouthfeel gets mealy with warmth (or swishing around inside of mouth) but remains a bit fizzy. Finishes dry enough to make you say ""whew"" after each sip.

Nice malty aroma -- a bit nutty in character, as is the flavor, which develops a very satisfying, full, roasty character to complement the beer's sweetness.

Note: I recommend this beer to be in the neighborhood of 55-65 degrees for optimum consumption (I raised several of my scores after the beer warmed up a bit).

The taste of this ale is very robust and forward. Tastes of malt, leather, and slightly bitter chocolate dominate this beer. There is also a fair amout of hops that give it a very pleasing bitterness. Very low carbonation, but either the alcohol or the acidity gives a slight tingle on the tounge with the finish.

The beer comes across smokey immediately which fades into the sweet taste of the malts. The beer remains slightly smokey in flavor, but it slowly gives way to the malt and hops.

Malty taste, too malty. It would be better served if the alcohol were allowed to have a more dominant presence, however the alcohol is noticeable. Overall drinkable, but only once in a while.

Nice chocolatey characteristics are there before the complex fruityness comes in. Big prunes, figs, some slight orange zest, and more slightly tart grape flavors. The brew ends with big maltiness but nicely avoids becoming cloying and syrupy. Very clean and very light for the amount of maltiness and big fruit flavors.

Lightly nutty, biscuity malt emerges mid palate concomitantly with a subdued earthy Goldings hop flavor.  Moderate in body, with a smooth mouthfeel facilitated by the relatively low carbonation.

2.06,-49.5,3,2,2,2,2,"""SkullSplitter"" is probably a good description of the hangover more than a couple of bottles would induce.  I did not think the malt and hops were well balanced, it started fairly sweet but quickly gave way to a overly bitter hops finish.","Brent","Jul 11, 2001"
