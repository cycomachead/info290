4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A super dark opaque brown with a light brown head. spots and streaks on the glass. Nose has so much to offer and delight in. The bourbon is well represented without being too big. It sets a platform that allows the malt of the ale to offer toffee and caramel against the notes of smoked cherry and dark fruit sweetness. A hint of oak. Some toasted coconut and vanilla flows throughout. Taste is superb. Balanced and complex. Lots of Scotch ale in the front with its typical burnished maltiness. Cherries and vanilla follow with the oak dryness leading to a mild hop presence. Lots of subtle complexities, caramel and dark fruits, toffee and roasted grains.  Feel is full and creamy with just a few points off for a bit of thinness that seems to affect the bottle I'm having. Last one seemed a bit better carbonated. Still a good feeling glass this time around with a mild smooth feel and satisfying swallow. A stupendous beer al the way around. The seemingly perfect melding of Scotch ale and bourbon barrels has me wondering about the prominence of stout instead of a good wee heavy. This is just outstanding.","scootny","Mar 29, 2015"

Cloudy appearance with lots of visible sediment throughout the beer, not just in the bottom of the bottle. Aroma features lots of sweet bourbon. A bit of sourness in the background. Nose is decent and reminds me of CW's BB Barleywine. Taste is sweet & bourbon up front that really pops. Some tanginess on the sides. A little roasty in the finish. Mostly the taste is about the sweet & bourbon. Mouthfeel is nice, pretty thick, a little syrupy. Below average carbonation. Overall it's a nice beer. 1.5 years of age haven't altered it much, from my recollection. Lots of sweetness, a little roast. Nice barrel presence.","foobula","0"

4.26,1.2,3.75,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"O: I am surprised by how sweet the beer manages to be while still remaining balanced. The first things I notice are all sugary: vanilla, coconut, caramel, toffee, candied nuts, etc. Even the bourbon is sweet. But then a light roasted flavor, oak tannin and relatively small, sharp carbonation come together to keep it from being cloying. Still sweet, but not quite a dessert beer. Great take on a scotch ale.","WankelEngine","Aug 27, 2013"

3.7,-12.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into Darkness glass. Appearance is a deep dark amber with minimal light passage. Some tan head upon pour with moderate retention. The nose starts with mellow bourbon notes, mainly vanilla. Some malt base is present at the back, a touch of smoke and peat paired with caramel. Taste starts out with smooth vanilla and a bit of oak. The oak seems to add some acidity to the flavor, not sure if this is intent all or what. Light bitterness present next with strong caramel and a metallic twinge on the finish. I can't help but perceive the beginnings of the infected flavors I experienced in Peruvian Morning. Perhaps this is just from some astringency from the oak, As it stands, this is a tasty brew, but I'm not sure how long this one will hold up.","homebrew311","Aug 21, 2013"

More time in the barrel to mellow out the boozey burn found in this beer, a perfect example lies in what central waters did this year with all the barrel aged offerings... 2013 vintages of the CW brewers reserve beers (Bourbon Barrel Stout, Peruvian Morning, Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, & Bourbon Barrel Cherry Stout) in the barrel for a full year instead of the 6 months (which is what they previously practiced). This made such a remarkable difference in the quality of CW's final product is was really impressive to speak honestly. 3.75","4DAloveofSTOUT","Jul 22, 2013"

The bourbon is strong here but it is at the expense of the base beer, which I can barely taste. I can't help but think that Central Waters just threw Slainte into used bourbon barrels as a money grab. Slainte is a fine scotch ale on its own, but it does not get much of a chance to shine here. As a style comparison, this is nowhere close to being in the neighborhood of Backwoods Bastard or BA Big Sound. As a local comparison, I consider Shaggin in the Wood to be significantly better. I can't recommend this beer to most, but if you enjoy a strong bourbon flavour, this is probably your beer.","Stevedore","Jul 22, 2013"
