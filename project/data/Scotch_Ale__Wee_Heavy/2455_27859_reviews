"Aroma is caramelly, with a touch of fruity specialty malt. Fairly nutty. Flavor is fruity, wIth a nutty caramel malt backbone, and a bitter finish."
"Overall- I have not jumped on the ""Scotch Ale"" bandwagon yet.  I have tried several and none of them have blown me away yet.  I will try this beer again once I have sampled more of this style."
"Asheville Brewey (DL likes it)"
"Pours a medium caramel brown with a pillowy off white head and has notes of sweet toasted malts, caramel and a light herbal hop. It has a lightly malty sweet carmel taste with a small dark fruit presence at first, then a decent bitterness slips in to balances it out... https://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReviews"

"O: Easy drinking considering the strength of the beer and it has a nice complexity to the flavor with enough but not too much sweetness. Enjoyable."

"The Crack! revealed a well-filled French Broad who was a Wee Heavy. I picked her up and gave her an inverted Glug to kick off our time together. There was a nice pseudo-cascade which settled into three fingers of dense, light-brown head with good retention.  Color was Light-Copper to Copper (SRM = 14.5) and the preciseness is due to the brewery including it on the CAN. Thanks! The nose had an earthy sweetness, sort of medicinal, like Geritol or along those lines. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full.  Taste was quite vegetal, mostly earthy and not at all pleasant. The BJCP app tells me that this is allowable due to the use of peaty malt, but I was not digging it. We used to be admonished NOT to review based on style due to brewersâ€™ interpretations, but if I rated this just on its merits, it would do very poorly. By taking style into account, it at least gets a fighting chance. Finish was semi-sweet but that vegetal taste was going to linger with me for a while. Ugh."

"Medium body, firm feel, and a malt-forward flavor. Not as rich as some Scotch ales, but still a fair amount of toasty goodness. Some bread and biscuit notes up front are quickly accented by raisins, toffee, and then by just enough of a hop kiss to provide some spice on the finish. Very drinkable and food-friendly beer."

"O- It's important to note that there are very few Scotch ales I've met and liked. That being said, this one isn't bad IMO since it's drinkable and unoffensive, but I would be reaching for something else if it wasn't for the fact I got this for free and have nothing else to drink."

"D: not a bad brew, but not a wee heavy to me at all. too roasty, chocolately, and not enough malt complexity to be to style for the wee heavy. they have a great base going here, just need to add some more unfermentables and build more caramel/body. imo of course."
""
""
""

"There's a higher than moderate carbonation but it's not abrasive, I just think it should have more thickness as a wee-heavy."

"A decent wee heavy. Definitely earthy and peaty. Main complaint is that I just want more flavors, more variety/depth/complexity, out of it."
""
"D - Well done, the balance is excellent and the beer hides its strength quite well."
"Overall: This beer is very attractive, incredibly easy to drink and very flavorful. The ABV is well hidden, a very nice beer and one of my favorite for this style. Its simple but that almost makes this one better."

"O - It's not a bad beer, but nothing great. I would probably drink it again. I guess it's above average."
"M: A resounding malty body, well-carbonated with just a bit of hoppiness to balance. The nose is a winner, followed by the finish of a warmer glass."
"O: Meh, it would be a pretty simple but tasty scotch ale that would probably garner a 4, but the carbonation is way too high, bringing this one down."

"22oz bomber: This one pours a dark, clear caramel brown color. There was just a wisp of an off white head on it. Nice big malty nose to it. Mainly toffee, toasted malts and caramel. Just a hint of some earthy hops. Medium bodied. Toasted toffee malt taste, just a hint of bitterness coming through. Nice."
""
"This is a good example of the style. It has a nice flavor profile and good drinkability. It's worth cehcking out."
"I like this Wee-Heavy-er Scotch Ale. Perhaps not quite in the top tier of the style, but the chocolate gives it a nice twist."
"The beer pours a dark reddish-brown color with an off-white head. As expected, the aroma is full of malt, with heavy amounts of toffee and caramel, as well as a hint of chocolate. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of toffee and caramel, as well as some peat malt notes, a hint of smoke and some light amounts of dark fruit. The alcohol is also present in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O - good scotch ale, worthy a try. Would drink it again."
"overall: Nice and tasty. My first French Broad. Should be Wee-er Heavy."
""

"At first, I get a mild bitterness. Then the sweetness sets in. Smooth feeling. The caramel and corn syrup really take the forefront here. Toffee comes in later."
"o: Just a spot-on medium sized Scotch ale imo. I enjoyed my $4 dollar bomber just as much and I'm kicking myself for not getting more to bring home. I love the subtlety and restraint shown with this beer."

"A little dissapointed, the taste that comes through is good but there was not much of it. This was too weak and thin."

"brown with a huge tan colored head. A great amount of lace was left down the glass, and the settling of the beer was a fantastic site, grat pour, looked perfect. Smell was sweet right away. Lots of sugar and caramel smells, hints of grains and breads and even a light hop presence rounded this put nicely. The taste followed right away, but was alot more hoppy then I had envisioned. Lots of caramel and sugar flavors"
"Overall this is OK at best. I think this bottle may have been well past its prime."
"O - This would have been great when I was in college 30 years ago but it is rather ordinary by today's standards. With all the great brews available, I have no plans for a repeat purchase."
""
"{rating confirmed with 22oz bottle in May 2012)"
"O: I think this brew would fare better as an American Porter, but it is still too simple to make any headway; there simply isn't any depth. That said, as simple as it is, it is tasty. And at $4 a bomber, I really can't be too disappointed."
"Overall. Meh. This beer isn't terrible, but it leaves a lot to be desired."
"O- If I was given this beer blindly and asked what style it was by BA listed styles, it'd take at very least double digits to guess wee heavy. It tastes like an average stout. It just isn't what it claims to be (and isn't very good otherwise) and I judged it accordingly."
"Overall, I could drink this beer with no qualms (maybe as a porter rather than a Scotch ale), but it's not much to write home about. French Broad Brewing Co. has better offerings."
"o - overall, very impressed with this beer. a bit on the brown ale side of the spectrum, but delicious to enjoy."
"I normally find Wee Heavy beers to be rather lackluster, but this one gets the job done."
"$4.25 for 22 oz-- can't beat it. Very drinkable while delivering a lot of interesting flavors."
"Overall: a decent flavored wee heavy that is easy to quaff."
"O- Nothing terrible, but nothing awesome either. I enjoy this style so I guess I was a little disappointed in this one."
"For a wee heavy this is on the light side, very easy drinking, quite sessionable."
"This is one of my favorite ""every-day"" French Broad products. This was poured from a 22 into a pint glass - it pours a moderate brown with a two finger tan head with decent lacing. Smells of toffee and malt. Taste is very well balanced with a malt spike, notes of toffee and/pr caramel, with a sweet hop character. The slightly elevated ABV is well hidden and makes me happy. Finish is clean. Just a nice, well rounded Scotch Ale."
"Overall: Meh. I could take it or leave it. There are definitely better offerings of the style. Glad to say I got to try it though as I've never had anything from this brewery, unfortunately, I likely won't be as excited to see anything from them in the future based upon this one."
"D: The beer is very drinkable considering its strength."
"Well, my second experience with French Broad Brewing Co. wasn't anywhere close to the first. Wee Heavy-er pales in comparison to Rye Hopper. This one needs work. The biggest problems are the weak nose and the weird acidic flavor. Remedy those two things and this one might be headed in the right direction. I'd take a pass on this one for the moment. Nonetheless, thanks for the opportunity, Dan!"
"Warmth finds this beer gelling better & offering more depth of flavor. Seems more like a Scottish ale than a wee heavy to me. Pretty decent overall."
"D- In all I can't bash this beer but I can't praise it."
"Nicely drinkable, I'd like to have another!"
"D: There is nothing extreme about this beer and it is easy to drink."
"D: I like it. It does not jump out with anything overwhelming and is lacking in some complexities but in this case that is what makes it so good and drinkable. It defintely stands out and is unique without being extreme in any direction. I could drink a few of these."
"D: A solid, drinkable, but not overly inspired beer."
"Pours a fairly dark brown color. Off white head with a bit of lacing. The nose is pretty nice with caramel, brown sugar, and some dark fruits. Trace amounts of the latter. The taste is mostly just some bready caramelized malt. Feel is pretty good, slightly heavy with good carbonation. Good drinkability and a nice winter brew."
"22oz. bomber courtesy of Bucketboy. Served in a standard pint. Pours a chestnut brown with a semi-hazy clarity and a loose, quarter inch, off-white head. Head eventually dissipates into a skim and a band. Only two random strands of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses earthy/peaty malt and a slightly vinous quality. Taste follows nose with the addition of a buttery character. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a lively, almost prickly carbonation; the overall consistency is also a bit on the watery side. A decent wee heavy, but nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability is decent, drinking pretty well for 9% abv, but leaves a slight sticky taste, and lingering wild yeast funk and light metallic flavor. However, the light manageable sweet taste to start and dry finish adds a nice touch."
"D: I do not like this beer at all and I will not finish or buy it again."
"The flavor completely threw me for a loop. There is only a hint of the expected caramel flavor and plenty of sour flavor. Not quite puckering but definitely along the lines of many sour Belgian beers I've tried in the past. Nothing at all like a wee heavy and honestly almost undrinkable. The mouthfeel is also off. It's too thin for a big Scottish beer. I think I'll be able to finish this glass but there is no way I'm pouring another. Hopefully this is just a bad batch and all will be well when I try this again in a few months."
"This was a very nice beer and one I could have had again, though it was superior on tap."
"Now things go down hill the brew defiantly had a sour smell to it as well as a taste it did come of as a sour Brune to me. So I will say it was drinkable but, not as a wee heavy. I will revisit this one if fortune allows ."
"I can't quite put my finger on it but there is something in the aroma that really turns me off on this one, the flavor and mouthfeel don't do much to save it. Glad it was only a bomber and I didn't get stuck with a 6-pack."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Overall this is not a bad beer, I would drink it again, especially if there was nothing better available."
"D - Easy to drink, had no problem finishing my single glass. Overall a good, if boring, example of a Scotch Ale."
"D: Both French Broad beers were diacetyl-laden and characterless otherwise. I would try them again, but will probably wait until I can get to their pub to sample again."
"Fairly sweet with a good amount of smoked peat as well. Some nice fruity hints as well. Medium bodied and well carbinated. I really enjoyed this beer, although it seems just a little small for the style. I would love to see it be just a little bolder. But all in all it is very tasty"
"This is a very tasty brew, it doesn't go above and beyond, but it is a very enjoyable beer to sip on or have with a meal."
"d: a decent beer but i feel that i'm partial to wee heavies so for the style it's only ok"
"Not one to sit and ponder its complexities, but still better than Bud."
"D-Good but overall a bit dull and lackluster. A non-offensive and interesting brew that is the type good for introducing non-craft drinkers into the fold."
"Pours a deep brown with a tan head. Smells roasty, stout like. Tastes similar. I don't really get the caramel, burnt-sweetness that I find in these beers typically. It's more of a big brown ale or a stout or something similar. The alcohol is hidden completely though, dangerously. A fair amount of bitterness. I like it, but I dunno if it has all I want in a Scotch ale."
"Drinkability is not bad. It goes down pretty easy for the style and would be sessionable. As I said before, not quite as complex as I like but still a pretty good brew. I'd say its worth a try if you see it."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice brownish color, very nice carbonation, huge three-finger thick/creamy light tan head, with some awesome thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some yeast, dark fruits, caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with some nice yeast notes, dark fruits, slight spice, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, but reminds me more of a BSDA."
"Overall, an enjoyable malt-driven scotch ale that I would drink again."
"Not sure what the deal is with this one. Rather than a smooth malt bomb, this one is a tart and fizzy brown ale."
"D: Well, I have to say that this beer does suprise. Don't know if that is good or bad. The flavors, look, feel and smells all have suprises that kinda toss you a curve. This does taste more like a German style than a Scotch Ale. Has a bit of an identity crisis if you ask me. That carbonation level is just way too high and needs to be tamed. With all that said, it went down easy and was refreshing. I give it that. What a strange experience."
"Best pairing yet: Ben & Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Ice Cream with a Butterfinger bar crumbled over top. Yowza."
"Drain pour. I know these guys make good beer, this was a huge disappointment."
"Poured a leather couch brown that had some visibility and a two-finger white head that died quickly. Aroma is a mix of mild malts, both sweet and roasted, with very little hops. Not a nose-catching aroma but it did attract me. For a heavy ale this is rather a light beer. Medium-bodied, at best, it passes smoothly, slightly creamy, as the malts are rather subdued for a little sweet and chewiness; caramel, hints of cocoa, and some toffee along with roasted are in there but nothing that is really outstanding. A dab of fruit flavorings/dryness from the hops, which provide a minor sour fruit and bitter taste for balance in the backend, but are overpowered to be honest. A decent beer but not what I'm looking forward to with a heavy scotch ale."
"Wee-Heavy-er Scotch Ale might be French Broad's biggest seller, but it isn't their best beer. Of those that I've had, Rye Hopper is clearly numero uno. Maybe Wee-Heavy-est will deliver what my big beer lover's palate craves."
"Drinks pretty easy, this had a lot of nice attributes, but didn't quite pull together..."
"Nice to have this brewery's products available in Atlanta these days. This one was poured from a 22 oz bottle. Pours almost black with a faint head that settles to a thin ring. Smells malty, even a bit treacly, as well as quite yeasty. The aromas are on the lighter side, though. Tastes pretty satisfying. Malty, but fairly dry for the style with some citrusy bitterness as well, and a dash of anise or fennel in the finish. The mouthfeel is light and on the crisp rather than the rich side of the style. Pleasant and easy-drinking."
"On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear, dark, ruddy brown with a tall off-white head that clings to the glass. Smells of slightly sweet caramel malt and toffee. Absolutely no smoke or peat as others have claimed. Not a bad thing, as this isn't really a traditional element of a scotch ale. Tastes of roasted malts and a hint of brown sugar. Little-no hop flavor. A bit of honey at the finish. Nice, full body. A scotch ale true to its origins. Well done."
"Drinkability is good will be buying this one again."
"I'm fairly unimpressed with this one. There just isn't enough flavor or body to make this much more than average...if that."
"About what I expected. Not great, but not bad at all."
"There's peat in there, too. I didn't pick up on it myself, but I read some other reviews, and tasted again, and it's in there."
"Still looking for a great NC scotch ale."
"D - Drinks more like a session beer than a wee-heavier but I enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel kind of ruined this for me. Way too carbonated and pretty thin for the style. Aside from the carbonation, pretty drinkable, but I feel bloated after only 10oz or so :("
"Pours out a nice clear brown color with a big fluffy yellow/off-white head. The head kind of fades back and stays around, leaving minimal lacing. Looks about average. The smell is very nice. Upfront, without a question, is the smell of scotch. I wonder if this ever touched wood, or scotch for that matter. There are lots of caramelized sugars and a bit of smoky, roasted smells. A bit of esters in the nose as well. The taste is very nice too. I expected booziness after the smell, but there isn't any. The smell has a great smoky flavor, but it isn't to the beef jerkey level. There's an odd roastedness, and its a little less sweet than I would've expected though there's plenty in this, it finishes a little dry with the smokiness coming back in. There isn't a whole lot of depth, but I'm fascinated by what's here. Definitely could be improved upon, with a bit more chewiness and roasted flavors (not smoked malts), maybe junt a hint more sweetness or some hops to cut through the smokiness. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, though there's enough body to satisfy, and nothing really off-putting (unless you don't like smoke), with good carbonation levels. It finishes nice and clean, and is easy to drink, since the alcohol isn't apparent and the beer isn't too intense. I think I'm a bit of a fan, and would recommend it at least once. The scotch smell is really what's so fascinating."
"Taste is toasted barley, spices, and slight caramel with little head. Drinks easy for a heavy beer"
"This is the first thing I've tried from this brewery; and it's not good. Overwhelmingly oxidized to the point of being undrinkable."
"This one poured all head, and I really mean all head. Settled into a deeper amber color. Aromas of earthiness, wood, roasted and toasted caramel, and some chocolate. Tastes of caramel, roasty, lighter earhy, and chocolate."
"the body is light to medium since it is not sticky. the mouth feel is prickly from spice and carbonation. 7/3/6/3/14/3.3"
"D = Fair drinkability, I definitely enjoyed this beer, but given some of the great beers available in similar style good is probably about square on."
"Not bad, a bit dry and sweet. Glad I got a chance to try this one. Thanks to my friend Mike down in NC."
"22 oz bottle pours a mostly clear copper body with a small beige head that quickly dissipates. Patchy lacing is left behind. Aroma is not very distinct, just some toffee and pine hops. Medium body and carbonation. Taste is nicely balanced between a toffee malt sweetness and a spicy and pine hop bitterness. There is a suggestion of smoky peated malt underneath which adds a nice aura of authenticity. Very drinkable even if a bit mundane."
"Regardless, a big ""Cheers"" to Metalmonk for this one: a Scottish Ale (""Tapadh leat"") from French Broad (""Merci beaucoup"") brewed in North Carolina (""Thanks y'all"")."
"Very little head forms on this beer. It's very dark brown and has less smoky nose then I thought it would have. It has almost a soury malt nose. Virtually no hops on the taste but it has a slightly sweet, slightly more smokey malt taste. Very little after taste. There's a small bit of tartness. A decent beer but not one my favorite scotch ales. Very easy drinking for the considerable abv as well."
"D- This is a nice offering from French Broad. While it's not my favorite scotch ale I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
"An unfocused scotch ale with very little to recommend it. I'd heard good things about French Broad, and since they're somewhat local, I'd pick their stuff up again in hopes that they usually do better. Jury's out."
"This tawny brew had a bit of haze and reddish highlights. It poured with a fluffy two finger cap that settled extremely slowly with just a few clumps sticking to the sides of the glass. Malty grain aroma, a little bready and yeasty, biscuit and a hint of caramel, and a little sharpness from the carbonation. Mild to moderate bitterness with just a hint of hop flavour in the finish. Other than that, the flavour was mostly malt (as in the nose) with a clean yeast profile, perhaps a bit of butterscotch. The carbonation was sort of coarse and definitely too high, creating a texture that was pretty far from smooth. Body was on the lighter side. Mild dryness too, which I wasn't expecting for the style. Not bad, but fixing the carbonation and mouthfeel would go a long way for this beer."
"Not a bad beer, just nothing spectacular about it."
"Carbonation is just right, and it's medium bodied."
"The flavor hits the spot, with a peppery, bitter chocolate note that transitions to a bit of musky earth and tannin. Mouthfeel is even better, with a spritzy, yet smooth, medium body and a lingering finish of peaty scotch and powdered chocolate. A slight chalkiness is all that keeps the mouthfeel from a ""5.0"" in my book. Overall, Wee-Heavy-Er is a tasty scotch ale that reps the style well and will likely be purchased again."
"Poured a hazy reddish hue with a smallish 1/4 inch head. Aroma was malty with a very slight whiff of hops. Taste was malty as well, along with some peaty and smoky flavors to complement the malt. Body was quite light for the style and thus made it very drinkable and quaffable. Alcohol was not at all evident. Not a bad example of the style, but a liitle bit too tame for my liking."
"M/D: Mouthfeel is a little off. Carbonation is little too much for me, though it tended to ease up after a while, and at times I get a bit of chalky feeling. Drinkability is decent, not a bad beer at all but not a standout for the style."
"D: Fairly complex scotch ale that is a pleasure to sip."
"22oz bomber from Peace St Market, I've always enjoyed these guy's beers on trips to Asheville and am Psyched to see an increased presence 240 miles away here in Raleigh! Pours a crisp dark brown with ruby hightlights when held to light, the beer sports a thin lasting head. Aroma is dominated by caramel malts, not much else there, but still fragrant. The taste is also a nice showcase of caramel malts, as expected for the style. The beer is on the light side of medium with low carbonation and well hidden alcohol. As a hophead, I'll admit I have to be in the mood for a Scotch ale, but this is one that certainly does not disappoint."
"Smooth and sweet; plenty drinkable."
"Beautiful!"
"on-tap at the Bier Garden"
"Drinkability: Fairly mild and thin for supposedly being so much more heavy-er."
"At Tyler's Tap Room in Durham, NC I enjoyed this dark brown ale which presented a fair tan head and good lacing. The aroma was a pleasant brown sugar and molasses. The flavor jumped out as a malty charcoal with a bit of bitterness. It was a little bit thin for this style I thought but it makes for an easier drinking brew. I certainly expected this to be heavier and stronger but it was pleasant and ultimately likeable enough to want to drink it again. Definitely worth a try once you understand that this will not be too beefy despite the impressions from the name."
"Loving this beer- it offers the slimmest of ""earth"" intangibles without going overboard. It's an American Ale at heart but it certainly has garnered inspirations from the peat-heavy Scottish Whiskeys. Silly Scots- they get so drunk that they find a benefit in burnt dirt."
"Flavor was heavy in cinders and sulphur--almost so much that it was biting and bitter. And I liked that flavor. The earths were not so much erathy and peaty I associate with the style but very smokey. Medium body and filling. However, I can see the smokey bitters being too much after a few pints."
"Tte is well balanced with a woody, smoky subtext to the malt and backing hops. Mouthfeel is measured but plenty thick and savory, like fine gravy. Not an earth-shattering wee Heavy and not as coarse or flavorful as most Scottish versions I've tried but still a nice effort."
"($10.99 / Growler)"
"It is a tried and true favorite in and around the Asheville area and has now become one of my own tried and true favorites."
"Pint at French Broad Pubhouse."
"Anyway, enjoyed this Wee Heavy very much. Nice malt character, dark mahogony and very easy to finish. Need to try an entire pint next time, especially with my new glass."
"A beer you can find at alot of restaurants and bars around Asheville,poured a deep burgundy with nice light brown colored head.Heavy on the roasted malt aromas with almost burnt quality along with some French roast coffee and brown sugar,to be expected malt driven brown sugar and dark roast coffee flavors finish with just a touch dry earthiness.A decent wee heavy to be had here not earth shattering but its always good to find a good Scottish ale out there."
"This beer poured with little head. A nice deep brown. It was almost black but not quite. It had a sweet malty smell. The taste was very smooth with a bit of bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth, there was no harshness at all. I could drink these again. Bought a growler at the brewery yesterday. There was some yeast sediment in the growler. No harm though."
"This is a good beer and I look forward to trying the Wee Heavy-est when it is released."
