Nose is very sweet and welcoming with tones of toffee malts and dark over ripe fruits.  Rich and roasty but not smokey maltiness comes through quickly with first sip.  A little woodsy on the back side with some mineral based flat spice tones that lay a dry mouthfeel.  there is a hint of chocolate graham cracker feel on the backside as well.  This would go well with pumpkin pie.  Thick and cloying in the mouth.  Only drawback to this brew is overall drinkability.","SPLITGRIN","Mar 15, 2015"

Flavor - hoo ha, now this is good! Malty, woody, earthy, with hints of cloves and hops, subtle bitter and sweet notes.

Beer pours a lightly syrupy reddish amber with a thick tannish head that dies down to a nice constant layer of tan pooling foam with light lacing. Absolutely beautiful in a glass. Nose is of caramel, minimal herbal hops, and even more caramel malt. Taste is up front brilliant, slick and creamy caramel malt up front and on the back. Light herbal tinged aftertaste, light sweet bread like aftertaste, and even more caramel malt. A serious scotch ale drinkers brew. Always welcome....and at 5 dollars a growler at Jungle Jim's, and 5.99 a bottle average, THIS is a beer that will change many peoples minds on what a good beer IS and SHOULD be.

I've known for awhile Smuttynose is considered a quality brewer but this is the first of their beers I've ever had. The aroma is quite pleasant (reminded me a little of Kahlua) and the appearance is nice; a creamy head with a dark auburn body. This is a very smooth scotch ale. There are strong chocolate, coffee and carmel notes the moment it hits the tongue, followed by a nice complex tangy finish. It seemed to get better the further into the bottle I got. Very impressed Smuttynose...scotch ales are not usually my favorite but this is one I'll definitely scoop up again the next time I see it.","ESkirv","Mar 20, 2014"

Kilned malts, raisins, hidden alcohol, a woodsy accent to the malt. Very pleasant indeed. The body is medium-full, really smooth, and a great ""appetizer"" at the time.","DoubleJ","Dec 06, 2013"

Aromas are blended well, with a fruit cocktail sweetness, earthy notes, and a strong, aged booze character. Flavors are robust and full, but only for an instant. Earthy malt forward, with currant and grape character abound, followed by an earthy, somewhat watery caramel apple flavor. The flavors are surprisingly mild and subtle from the aging process, and the barrel imparts only slight woody characteristics. The aftertaste is no different, with a light, effervescent caramel and roasty quality. The finish is slick and oily, leaving a slightly cloying linger on the palate.

The flavor comes charging back with a bready/earthy malt blended into a smooth, somewhat resinous brew that goes down quite nicely. I like how this captures that ""Scotch"" quality, a touch of burnt peat and alcohol while holding the neutralizing sweetness in grainy overtones to make for a drinkable pint, or two, or three.

The head clings to the sides nicely and has excellent legs for style. The aroma is primarily smoky peat and earthy minerals. The hops are robust for the Scotch ales almost too its detriment. The caramel malts are also absent. Tastes of roast malt and smoky flavor. The mineral flavor as well as a dry assertive tannins dominate the finish. Smooth with an alcoholic warmth. Too thin for style. Interesting and fairly complex. I enjoyed the beer but it really strays from the style too often and in the wrong directions.

Nice aroma, though not very strong. A bigger smoked peat presence in the flavor, along with a bready malt backbone, carob, and a hint of hops. The feel is thick and chewy, fizzy carbonation makes for easier drinking. There is some belly burn from the ABV. I like my scotch ales with some smoke flavor and this delivered nicely.

It smells of caramel, biscuit malts, and light neutral hops. The taste is very light on bitterness. It has a nice bready and malty finish. Medium body allows for an easy consumption.

There is a very steady stream of carbonation stirring in the brew. Clarity on this one is very good. Taking in the aroma I find a strong peated and lightly phenolic smokeyness over top a caramel malt base. I think I am getting some buttery diacetyl in there, but this may be a interplay between other aromas from the brew. The flavor is more robust than the aroma. I get a very nice bready character that mingles with peated smokeyness and light caramel. It just feels deep and dark, not it a roasted sense, but in a smoky sense. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very weak carbonation. It works very well with the flavors. This is a very nice brew. The smokeyness and peatyness blend with the mild sweet caramel malt. I would like to see a little more carbonation in it, but it still is nice as it stands. I would have this one again for sure.","kmpitz2","Aug 03, 2007"

4.23,6,3.5,3,5,5,4,"vibrant, deep red with mahogany hues at bottom of glass. thin head retained well, sexy abstract and intricate lacing left behind by beer as artist (maybe it's my mood). caramel malty sweetness in the nose balanced well with a touch of hops, tho it is a bit too faint - maybe a bit herbal? wonderful upon the sip: big malt sweetness with hazelnut and caramel - even chocolate way back there somewhere, swishing it around; then the Williamettes steps forward, swelling with a sort of sweet bitterness that segues well out of the initial maltiness, smack of coffee in a last death spasm before the swallow. . . nice long finish after this final impression with a gradual sweetness replacing it. smuttynose nails the mouthfeel - excellent carbonation tickles the tongue intensely and then settles into an impressively full and malty body, actually seeming fuller than it is (a neat trick, really), some alchohol-type warmth and a nice soft malty remainder bringing up the tail. A brew that's not hard to quaff, and important to savor. Seems half a year to a year in the cellar for these scotch big beers yields balanced and ripe results.","villainchiwwin","Apr 11, 2006"

I love the full body of this beer, it goes down very smooth and it leaves a glycerin type film in the mouth. It left some legs on the glass like a big wine. The flavor is slightly bitter at first then the smoky peat takes over and I get a strong taste of a brandy chocolate covered cherry.

Taste is dominated by caramel and roasted flavors, with some chocolate as well, but a nice dry finish to balance out the sweetness of the malt.

It's hazy, cherry-stained mahogany body appears almost black as it sits upon the bar; and reveals beautiful, gleaming ruby accents when held to the light. The creamy ivory-colored cap upon its head holds quite well before it drops slowly to a wide collar and lacy surface covering; and it leaves some minor lacing about the glass as well. Dry, caramelish malt with the suggestion of chocolate; a hint of yeasty fruitiness; and a subtle waft of roastiness greets you in the nose. It's smooth and creamy across the palate with a gentle caress of bubbles that awaken the tastebuds, and a full body that smooths them out. As is appropriate for the style, the flavor is malty and rich but reigned in by a sublime touch of roastiness; a concisely handled, firm bitterness; a sprinkling of subdued, mildly floral and grassy hop flavors; and a soft caress of alcohol.

Tastes malty (chocolate, nuts) with a warming alcohol kick, some hop bitterness, and a hint of whiskey. Has a slight Belgian taste and the malts make it almost chewy.

It is extremely complex, and I found myself experiencing different beers with every sip -- sometimes even during the same draw. There were woody flavors, spices like clove and cinnamon, and a world of other tastes. Every time I tried to ""capture"" the flavor to describe it, it would morph into something else. This is a chameleon-like brew that just keep surprising me. Very drinkable and highly recommended.","jtfest","Mar 29, 2004"
4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"A very complex beer. Pours out to a brown color in the glass with a generous, light brown head. There is alot of carbonation present. The smell is of malted milk balls (really) and hay...yes, hay, but I mean it in a good way. The taste is bizarre...there is a the malt heaviness of a brown ale, coupled with the fruit/raisin/plum/fig thing of a barleywine, a funky spicy finish from who knows where, and a nice, light hop presence of an English Mild, which, all in all, makes for a fine, drinkable beer. Thanks to my man, beerboy21 for sending this my way.","proc","Mar 27, 2004"
3.97,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4," Tatse is very malty to start, with toffee and caramel sweetness. There is a nice funky, hops bitterness to keep things in check. Some vinous notes emerge midway through, and the taste develops a number of complexities. A fig/date fruitiness gives way to more dark fruits as the alcohol content becomes noticeable. Vinous notes try to reassert, but get knocked back by the bitter, floral hops and heavyduty malt character. I don't pick up any peat or smoke flavors here, but it's still a very tasty Scottish style ale. With some smokiness, this would earn some superlative scores from this reviewer.","merlin48","Mar 22, 2004"

3.88,-2.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A great comforting beer. It is dark ruby brownn in color with a thin head. There is little to no hop character or bitterness in this bee, yet it seems to be well rounded. It is very malty with tastes of caramel and a slight smokiness. The smokiness is probably from the use of some peated malt. I could drink this one all night.","ark57","Feb 22, 2004"
3.48,-12.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Smooth taste, medium body with a taste of tootsie rolls but lighter. A touch of sour bread on the sides of my mouth as it fades to alcohol. Not overpowering at all, but its there. No hop tastes but it has to be there as the beer is not cloying. Slick finish. This is a very nice beer and Im wondering how the other bottles will keep stored in the cellar.","UncleFrank","Feb 11, 2004"

3.88,-2.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22oz. bomber poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a dark ruby red, almost black, with one finger of head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly malty and sweet, with aromas of caramel and toffee. Not too strong of a smell. The taste starts malty with more caramel, and a little cinnamon. A little bit of sweet fruit in the middle, cherries and raspberry. The finish is fairly hoppy. The mouthfeel is fairly strong, yet smooth on the tongue. The drinkability is really good for a brew that's nearly 8%. A delicious Scotch Ale!","SheepNutz","Feb 03, 2004"

There are some roasty notes, but not a lot of smoky flavor like I enjoy in my scotch ales. It would give this one a little more character. If you are looking for a bold rich-bodied malty scotch ale, then this is your beer. It was very smooth and very drinkable, but it was just a bit dull for me to really love it.","ElGuapo","Jan 28, 2004"

Strong aroma of maltiness, like a loaf of bread in a bottle, but this bread's been soaking in EtOH, and the alcohol is noticeable. Not overdone, but apparent. Taste does not disappoint, the full malt flavor, slight bite of hops, and warming aftertones of the 7.8% play a beautiful harmony. All this for $2.95?!?

4.35,9,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5," I really like this beer. I don't really mind the decision to buck style traits with the use of the smoother beechwood smoked malts as opposed to the peat smoked malt, but I think the sting of peat malt usually helps to balance the sweetness. Here it could benefit from a little more alcohol flavor to make up for that. This brew is most definitely a scottish ale, not a scotch ale. The taste and feel are of a session brew, the alcohol may be present, but it doesn't show it much. Great brew!","waughbrew","Jan 23, 2004"

Pours a deep chocolate liquid with a foamy head dissipating quickly to a thin lace on the rim of the glass. Aromas of bready sweet peat smoke malt. The unique blend of flavors hint at a heather floral character and a mellow peat malt. There is a bit of salty sweetness into the finish that suggests the sea. The body is smooth, and the warmth of the brew is unmistakable. Very interesting and tasty.","beernut7","Dec 30, 2003"

The aroma is largely of smoky malt, with some molasses and a bit of hops in the background. The malt is thick, lightly smoky and sweet, and a little too chalky for my liking. The hops are sort of lost within malt body. A mild tea-like bitterness fails to make a note worthy impact. This brew lacks a peaty and Scotch-like quality normally associated with the style. The presence of alcohol is barely noticeable, though the results of a pint are undeniable.","BeerResearcher","Dec 14, 2003"

Small tan clouds rapidly give way to the night. As you approach the campsite, you smell a whiff of peat smoke, then scotch, smoked malt, currant, and chocolate. It seems that a feast is about to begin! You step into the firelight, your broadsword at your side, and are heartily welcomed to the feast. Fruit, chocolate, scotch, faint hops, lots of malt, and caramel are all at the table, as we toast a fine Scottish day. Huzzah! It all goes down smooth, leaving an oily slick feeling on your wild beard and gullet. You smack your lips, still tasting the malt, the small tangy citrus, and of course, the scotch whiskey.

Bit of a chocolate milkshake aroma, and some barely detectable hops. Taste is smooth & chocolatey. Not too sweet but very flavorful. Malted milk and creamy coffee come to mind. The finish is quite hoppy for the style, and in a way clashes with the creamines of this brew..this is not balancing, the hops just kind of seem ""there"". they do help the overall aftertaste, preventing a very sweet residue from poking it's head out.
