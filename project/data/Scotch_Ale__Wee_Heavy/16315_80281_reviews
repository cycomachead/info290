"Just wasnt good in any aspect"
"Poured into a sniffer aged about a year. Looks, smells and tastes like cola from the addition of kola nut. Never would have thought this to be a scotch ale more like an extra dark and malty brown ale. Nevertheless the scotch style malts added another level of complexity to the beer. Massive tastes of honey give this beer extra depth as well. A combination of malt, dark sugars and alcohol make this a heavy yet delicious beer. Hope to see it on the shelves again and would highly recommend it."

"Bottle. Dark brown with small, white head. Poor lacing. Poor head retention. Aroma is dark malts, honey, caramel, candy. Taste i sem-sweet, honey, light bitterness, some floral notes, dark fuits, booze is quite noticable. Little oily texture, medium to full body, soft carbonation, alcohol warmth is strongly present. Finsih is long and sweet (boozy). Definetely not my style."
"Nice smooth flavored ale from BrewDog."

"Pours a dark brown color with an off white head.  The aroma has a nice deep toasty malt note with peat smoke, dark fruits and alcohol.  The flavor mimics the nose with more of the peat, some of the brown sugar, molasses, and char, and of course just a hint of alcohol.  The beer drinks easy and smoothly.  Overall, this is a solid option and very nice on tap."

"The commercial description is almost as good as the beer and the beer is very good! Poured at a perfect temperature with a modest light tan head, a little yeast and a very dark clear but almost opaque cherry color. Aroma is dark roast malt traditional Scotch ale. Flavor is a little muddled upfront but it really comes out in the finish as an excellent traditional Scotch ale; lots of dark malt and sugar flavors toffee little Cocoa, not quite smoke but in that direction. Body is great for this style soft warm round slightly boozy. Great drinkin' Scotch ale."

"Its fast-fleeting exit lightens considerably and casts aside the bulk of sweetness, favoring a drier and spicy finish that's predicated on peppercorn, spruce, toasted husk with vinous and dried stone fruit. Its arid dryness, subtle warmth and stern effervescence enlivens a tepid ash character that's sure to be to the delight of fine cigar aficionados."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with red highlights, virtually opaque in the glass. Thin tan head that dissipates to a ring around the glass, leaving thin lacing. Interesting aroma of brown bread, molasses, caramel, sweet nuts, hints of cola spicing and light cardboard similar to aged stouts. Flavor is a mellow blend of dark toasty malt, molasses, dates, figs, mixed nuts, cocoa and hints of coffee and cola. Really complex. Very nice creamy mouthfeel and medium to heavy body. A fun, complicated ale that has elements of both Scotch ale and porter, but with other interesting and complimentary flavors. There was so much going on here it seems almost all over the map, but still feels well melded and integrated. I'm impressed. The heavy malt and molasses flavors make it more of a sipping beer despite its moderate ABV. I liked this a lot and will snag another one when it rolls around."

"One of my all time favourites, would highly recommend."

"Very dark brown color with some sparse bubbles around the edge and a thin, web-like covering. Deep malty aromas along with molasses and prune...pretty mild overall though. Flavor is malty and sweet, but not cloying. Sweet bread, berries, some stickiness, bitter chocolate, dark fruit, and cola. Medium bodied, clean, and dry. A nice little Scotch ale."

"Overall a very tasty if not overly sweet ale. The mouthfeel is fantastic though. The sweetness does make it difficult to drink though. It's too sweet for me."

"Even though it is complex, it is very drinkable. Excellent scotch ale."

"O: For about 4 oz, this one truly kicks ass in terms of both drinkability and enjoyment factor. But as soon as the sweetness accumulates, it becomes a little less likable for my tastes. Killing an entire bottle would be difficult, but not unbearable; this is one to share with others. Between this and taking heroin, I'd pick drinking this 11 times out of 10."

"Suspicious of this one, given BrewDog's taste for gimmickry and the ingredients. But it's a well-judged and hearty, with a combo of spice, hops, and black malt acid (but no roast) balancing the prodigious sweetness. Maybe not the most faithful to style, but a good winter sipper."
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Dark mahogany pour with a touch of ruby when held to the light. Two finger beige head with decent retention and lacing. The nose is spicy, malty, and really complex with hints of nutmeg, molasses, figs, toffee, smoke, honey, and just a touch of coffee and mocha. The honey really comes out in the taste as this comes to temperature. Extremely toasty and malty with hints of cocoa, dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, coffee, and just a bit of red berries and licorice. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk with a subtle creaminess and tangy bitter finish. Not at all what I had expected as I'm not a big fan of honey. A very unique and tasty interpretation of the style."
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color. Very rich looking. It's got a cream colored head on top that holds a very good retention. Not much lacing though. The smell of the beer is malty, with some smoked malt, and hints of chocolate. The taste is also loaded with a strong malt dominance, lots of caramel in there with subtle smoke and chocolate toast flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and heavy. It's dense and should be for the style. Overall it's a good brew, I don't pick up on the addition of Heather or Honey too much in it. However it remains a good beer and is worth trying. In my personal opinion it's far better than the original Dogma."

"Overall a well-made scotch ale which I definitely enjoyed."
"O - Full of twists and turns, it's worth a try."
"All in all, much better than what I remember its previous namesake to be. Odd marketing tho..."

"The beer pours a yellowish color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the peat malt, with some nice toffee and caramel notes thrown in. The flavor is once again fairly peaty, with some dark fruit and heather notes. There is also, as expected, a lot of toffee and caramel. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is much better than the Original Dogma."
"This is a really solid beer. A good Scotch Ale and the heather honey adds interesting depth. It is missing a little fruit for my liking but it works well otherwise."
