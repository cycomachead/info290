One sampler described the aroma as smelling like old lady hair. If you have beer been to the salon with your grandma and smell the chemicals that go into the hair of the elderly, that is the essence of the aroma. The initial taste was that of a grapey scotch. The maltiness of the scotch is presented in the background and falls rather awkward with the grapiness. Dark fruit such as prune is also present, though the sweeter aspects of these fruits are absent relative to the drier aspects. The grape aspects turned medicine in the aftertaste, leaving a coating on the back of the throat. I really enjoy scotch ales, but I found this one to be quite flawed.","JohnnyHopps","Nov 14, 2012"

3.28,-9.6,4,3.5,3,4,3,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/1/2011. Pours cloudy very dark reddish brown color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, toast, molasses, caramel, earth, cocoa, and light herbal. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of prune, raisin, cocoa, earth, molasses, caramel, toast, slight smoke, tobacco, and herbal. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toast, tobacco, caramel, cocoa, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Pretty good flavor balance and complexity; but has some unpleasantly cloying characteristics after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a warming after the finish. Overall this is an ok scotch ale. If it didn’t have the cloying flavors on the finish it would have scored higher. Certainly wasn’t too difficult to finish.","superspak","Beers"

The taste starts of bready and becomes very sweet as the flavor develops. The finish features a touch of molasses along with caramel. Nice balance of flavors working here. The body is moderate with higher than average carbonation for style. Overall, this is a well crafted Wee Heavy.

The slightly acrid fruitiness up front worries me, but I trudge onward. Nothing to worry about here in the taste: The figs return, but the grapes are left behind; in their stead stand brown sugar, toasted toffee, molasses, and a surprising amount of alcohol. The body is a strong medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly thick, slightly oily feel.

It pours a nice and thick dark brown, almost to a black color but more of a nice mahogany. It gave a nice foamy light tan head that went away very quickly. Opaque to look through and shows descent signs of carbonation. Has a bit of a bite on the tongue and even more on the back of the throat. Ive had a few scotch ales and this one delivers on the full flavor. Compared to O'Dell 90 shilling this is a bit more flavorful but its def. a little hard to drink, its a sipper. Leaves a nice film on the tongue and palate, roasted malt and grains for sure, barely, almost a soft milk chocolate. I think its a little unbalanced as there isn't enough hop flavor to even the brew out a bit but i still enjoy the brew. Cheers.","HOPPYKC","Feb 26, 2011"

I also taste a slight hints of hops at the very last drop leaving that along with the apples and caramel in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is soft on the cheeks and back of tongue, but has a little bit of a tingly feel on the lips and tip of the tongue. This is a nice beer to drink and feels lighter than I would have expected. I'm guessing it is a medium to full body instead of just a full bodied beer.

Only problem is alcohol much too evident on the front end; perhaps for this reason, the maltiness is a fairly vague taste of toast, slightly brown-sugary but not sweet taste. Perhaps less drinkable than McEwan's, but more drinkable than most fine American microbrew Scotch Ales given this less distracting profile. Again, few can beat the carbonation perks here.

There's also slight oxidation and some noticeable alcohol that makes the beer a bit too hot. On the palate, it is medium in body, carbonation and finish.

I also notice chocolate and maybe some fruity notes. This one is definitly heavy-bodied. Any heavier and we'd be slugging out of an Aunt Jemima's bottle.

Incipient in flavor is a snap of acidic roasted grain, which is immediately superceded by stalwart, deeply caramelized malt. Virtually bereft of esters, save a raisiny twang complementary to the static sweet toffee presence. Mild notes of baker's chocolate and grainy biscuit surface as the beer breathes. Nearly full in body, with an agreeably dextrinous mouthfeel that suits the malt backbone well. Finishes with hints of candied nuts and more molasses, but not at all cloying in that regard.

Mouthfeel is extremely soft and smooth with a medium body. Lacing is sparse. Taste begins unpleasantly with some strong and nasty off-character fusel and isopropyl alcohols, leading into a metallic note, but halfway through, this beer becomes tolerable. The wet, soft finish is characterized by nutty, toffee amber malts with a subtle light molasses note and some faint rubbery hops. Smoke is not perceptable. It looks nice and has a nice finish, but that's not enough to make me want to recommend this brew to anyone, even Scotch Ale lovers. It seems these Peter Austin systems make all beers taste the same...this is the 3rd brewery I've tasted to use them, and they all brew unimpressive beers. Yawn...","Mitchster","Feb 13, 2003"
3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a reddish/brown color with a small head that left a lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is mostly of malt. Flavor also is mostly malt. This is an ok beer, but I think it would benefit from a bit more hops as it is a little sweet for my tastes.","darklager","Jan 06, 2003"

4.47,23.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep amber brown, with almost no head... looks just like it should. Aroma of smoked peat, caramel, and alcohol. Quite pleasant on the tongue: sweet caramel notes to begin with, followed by some light smoke flavor, just a touch of bitterness, and some noticable alcohol. Has a nice warming effect. Full bodied with low carbonation. An excellent representation of a Strong Scottish Ale.","zerk","Oct 02, 2002"
3.68,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Part of an Arcadia sampler: I found this to be a really good Scotch Ale. Poured a dark brown color with minimal head and thin lacing. Aroma of malt, cinnamon and alcohol. Flavor is stong malt with caramel and alcohol present, along with a zippy tongue feel. This is one of the better Arcadia brews I have tried so far. This beer is also deceptive in that it feels like you are drinking a higher-alcohol beer than you actually are.","Dogbrick","Beers"
3.98,9.6,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer was black as sin and had a light bubbly head that that left some oily lace.  The aroma was of malt and sweetness with a slight hint of alcohol.  The flavor was of malt and some sweetness I could not place.  The body was lighter than some others of this style, but not a bad start for this company.","Wildman","0"
