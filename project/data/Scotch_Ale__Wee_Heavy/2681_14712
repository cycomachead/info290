The malts are layered, and come in a hearty breadiness, toffee/caramel as well as a touch of chocolate...nothing too sweet, but very flavorful.  What really makes it go, though, in terms of taste, is the faint peaty smoke, a little grassy hoppiness, and the oaky vanilla.  Again, holds back from becoming too sweet or cloying; really delicious.","Taybeh","Feb 01, 2015"

I am quite a fan of the Scotch ale/Wee heavy style in general having had a particular opportunity to try a good few on a recent trip to Edinburgh and this one was just about everything I want in one. It was malty, creamy, had a little bit of that whisky flavor, and all in all a great dark beer in general and a wonderful Scotch ale. The nitro tap was also hug in bringing out the creamy and almost dessert-like qualities in this beer which were outstanding to begin with. Coupled with the consistency of a nitro pour (almost like a milkshake) this made for an amazing overall experience.","MaddestHatter","Aug 10, 2014"

I'm somewhat new to the craft beer scene, and I found the taste syrupy and bitter and kinda gross. But as I approached the bottom, I started to warm up to it and the beer seemed to settled down. I don't think it was simply the alcohol taking effect and me growing acclimated to the new taste, though I'm sure that played a part. But the beer seem to change consistency midway through.

It's just that most of the discussion I've seen was about either that or Dale's Pale Ale and the latter is sort of panned, so I thought Ten Fidy was maybe a one-hit wonder sort of thing. That was not the case and I will now try any Oskar Blues beers I can find. I can't believe this is year-round and less than $10 a six pack! I'm also glad I got this with regular carbonation because I really don't care for nitro at all. Just tastes flat to me.","krustster","Jul 17, 2014"

3.46,-13.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Final Word: Not as complex as I’d like, but at least the flavor here is good. The beer became more flavorful and enjoyable as I drank it, so I’d recommend letting it warm up some before diving in. The profile was so simple, mostly consisting of sweet malt and chocolate, that there is no danger of this beer becoming overwhelming at a higher temperature. Even after the beer opened up a bit, it was still very straightforward and simple. This a beer for people who like sweet, caramel malts but aren’t a fan of any hop bitterness in their beer. I’d choose this one as a safe bet if there’s nothing great around, but it doesn’t stand out enough to warrant ordering it over beers you already know you love.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

Good on the nose, great feel in the mouth, and very good follow-through on the taste, with a caramel malt finish. So good, I had to order a second one just to make sure the first impression was correct, and it was!","BockMan","Jun 12, 2014"

The taste was great with smooth wood beginning and then you get a little bit of hop and then the sweetness of the malt takes over.

4.1,2.2,4,4,4.25,4,4,"At one point I was a huge Scottish and Scotch ale buff. I'd like to think this is still true but over the last little bit exemplars of this style have fallen a tad flat for me and its not just the naturally low carbonation for these styles (nyuk nyuk). Let me just say that Old Chub has restored my faith. A dark ruddy brown brew with a shapely large khaki colored head, the aroma jumps right out in the rich sweet malt department, all toffee and malted milk powder. Palate is classic sweet malts as well, the same components as on the nose with a little treacle and faint wispy campfire smoke. On top of these to-be-expected elements, I also get some boozy raisins and dry chocolate. Complex malt bill is shining and although one can concoct a solid Scottish ale with nothing but pale malts and a pinch of roasted barley, the multifaceted approach is working well here. Just a bit boozy. The sweetness persists right through until the finish, but there is also some dry cacao powder to provide some balance. Wonderful "wee heavy" and highly recommended.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 30, 2014"

Wanted to give it a go with a clear palate (and mind) as well as few years more experience. Poured from the can (5/22/14 date) into my snifter. This poured a deep, dark hue... like a translucent mahogany with a 1/2 finger of eggshell head which retained pretty well. Lacing galore in my glass. Nice bready aromas with some fig/raisin goodness and a slightly boozy/funky note. Caramel up front, followed by a nice mix of the dark fruits and booze. Nice balance of malt and bitterness. Medium/heavy body to this one, great carbonation throughout and a nice bit of chew to the brew. Really enjoyed this one the second time around. Look forward to trying a few more in the style.

Warming slightly on the tongue, which is quite pleasant. The coffee notes come through the more I taste through this brew. Medium carbonation. I personally miss the carbonation, but it truly is spot on stylistically. High appreciation for this particular brew, well executed and very enjoyable.","ToriBug13","Jan 30, 2014"

It was hard to tell the clarity of this in the dark bar but it seemed darker and a touch thicker than many of the scotch ales I've had. The aroma is malty and sweet. Almost too sweet. Carmel and toffee notes abound. Flavor follows suit with notes of smoke and a pleasant alcohol bite on the tail. Im not sure I like how sweet this one is. Almost a little cloying. As a fan of scotch ales I believe I'll stick with Dirty Bastard or Wulvers next time. But still a nice offering from an excellent brewer.","lochef81","Jan 26, 2014"

Aroma was mildly sweet but the high alcohol is apparent and you definitely enjoy it on the taste. No bitterness. The alcohol leaves a warming flavor as it goes down and almost acts as a topical on the roof of the mouth. Medium viscosity is enjoyable on the palate as it lingers. Great Scotch ale that seems stronger than the 8 it claims. I would buy again and can recommend to anyone wanting a wee heavy.","BVukelich","Dec 09, 2013"

Poured from the can into a mason jar (neither of my big bell goblets are clean; seemed the next most appropriate glassware). I haven't had this since last winter and thought it was black, but this actually pours more of a dark mahogany with a fairly thick tan head. Nose on it is pretty impressive, heavy dark fruit, raisin, malt, jam. Flavor is also raisiny, jammy, SWEET, lightly hopped and a little alcohol lingers on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and syrupy. Leaves some stickiness on the lips. I will say as it warms up it deteriorates into this sort of malty, alcoholic mess, but just put a good chill on it and drink promptly! I'm actually really blown away. I've had this before, quite a few times, actually, and don't remember it being this awesome, but it is that awesome.","BeerWizard","Sep 28, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, smoked meat, wood, raisin, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, nuttiness, wood, light smoke, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent scotch ale. All around great complexity and balance of malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

A bit sweeter than I usually like in a beer but I'd definitely drink it again.

An appealing burnt cardinal red color with creamy 1 finger albeit slow poured yet short lived head in tall German .5 L glass (wonderful lacing). Smell was absolute malty with a small bit of prune cocoa contrast happening. Mouthfeel and drink was naturally a solid malt backbone with smooth lightly smoked toasted tootsie roll poured over just the right amount of select hops to give this scotch ale a medium sweet but pleasjng finish. Impressive if your first go at a scotch ale as not to smoky. Effervescence died very soon so swallowing is quite unimpeded. Higher abv is hidden so you'll quickly feel this great ale.

I was lucky to pick this one up while on vacation in FL and can't wait to visit the brewery on another trip later this month. It's my opinion, based on what I've had from them, that Oskar Blues delivers some seriously good beer. If Old Chub never gave you pause in your local beer store before then let it do so now. A great example of the style and one of the best beers I've had in the past few months. Would I drink it again? Of course.","JamesMN","Jul 02, 2013"

4.04,0.7,3.75,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had some nice traditional Scotch Ale flavors to go with some smokey peat that only a few Scotch Ale's I have tried have had, it combined both those aspects and makes it pretty balanced and smooth. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, the alcohol was hidden very well, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these in a row and be pretty happy with that and I can't say that for a lot of Scotch Ales, it's for sure more drinkable than Scotty Karate and Dirty Bastard. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability and the balance they were both pretty good with the alcohol was hidden better than almost any other Scotch Ale I have tired. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it didn't look bad at all, but a little more head would have been appreciated, it wasn't that big of deal. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good and drinkable Scotch Ale, it was nicely priced and it was pretty good for what it is, i can see this showing up in my fridge fairly often. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Scotch Ales, I think it's a good example of the style and one of the most drinkable. All in all I was happy with this beer and so far it's my favorite beer from Oskar Blues and it gives me hope that there's more beers from this brewery that I will like. Dirty Bastard is still my favorite Scotch Ale with Scotty Karate coming in close second, the flavors are much more intense in those beer but with the intense flavors comes less drinkability so it was nice to have a Scotch Ale that was on the other side of the spectrum and I feel like this one would be my third favorite of the style. Good job Oskar Blues, this is one quality Scotch Ale that I will be revisiting.","StoutHunter","Mar 30, 2013"

4.01,0,3.75,4,4,4.25,4,"12oz can. Deep clear ruby with a foamy mocha head. Rich ringing and a robust looking cascade of spotty lace. Smells of rich sweetness in the nose, with toffee, brown sugar, cocoa, a dash of fruit and some smoky accents. This is nice. The taste pretty much matches that, with a rich smoky sweetness on the palate that includes notes of caramel, cocoa and brown sugar. There is also a light herbal bitterness present that combines with the roast to help offset some of the sweetness here. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bubbly crispness that fills up the mouth. There is some warmth on the tail end of each sip but this is otherwise very smooth for 8%. Scotch Ales are admittedly not one of my favorite styles but this one made a believer out of me in this instance. This is just packed with flavor and very drinkable for the size. I won’t be ignoring this one on the shelf any longer.","Kegatron","Mar 29, 2013"

As far as flavor goes, it is malty, toasty, and full of flavor. Hop bitterness is low and very subtle. Unlike some other scotch ales, this beer is very easy to drink and not overpowering on the smokiness or stong malt flavor of other scotch ales on the market. This is the type of beer I could enjoy any time of the year. Very well done.","jhutch31","Mar 26, 2013"

The body is thick and the taste is malty and sweet, but not overdone like some scotch ales. A very subtle smokiness is barely detectable, but present nonetheless. There is a touch of alcohol on the finish, but it is not harsh at all. One of the best scotch ales out there!","57md","Jan 21, 2013"

The taste is pretty delicious as you take in a complex blend of malts, hops and yeast. The texture is just as smooth as the beer is flavorful. This brew is just as the description says: a great celebration of malts. Definitely give this one a try; I’m sure you won’t be disappointed.","Lemke10","Oct 31, 2012"

What I find odd about this beer is that each can is different. Some cans are "wow!" and others are not quite the same. I almost wonder if it is some sort of temperature issue, but I've tried to keep the cans all at the same temperature before pouring. What I describe is usually always there, but the flavors that pop out are strong in one can and weaker in another. The aroma is consistent though - go figure. So not highly drinkable, but good. Not sure if I'd go out of my way to get it again based upon this can, but maybe the next can will have me crazy about it again. Interesting and worth trying though.","damndirtyape","Jul 21, 2012"

Creamy ecru foam sits on top firmly and never leaves. Thick caramel and toffee on a base of shortbread and toast. A hint of char adds depth along with a fleeting earthy hop flavor. Balanced on the finsih leaving Old Chub more drinkable than the overly sweet examples out there.

Aroma of caramel and sweet malt, almost a cola component; light aroma. Taste starts with dry caramel malt and dark fruit, almost a whiskey like flavor which may be from smoked malts, and molasses component. Flavors are a bit understated and even with all these components seem simple and not too complex. Well integrated. A pleasant scotch ale.","LiquidAmber","Mar 18, 2012"

Small streaks of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasty malt and some caramel/toffee aromas. Taste is of toasty malt, caramel, and some slight smokey flavors. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some pretty nice flavors.

The beer pours a slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger off-white head with some retention and lacing. The aroma is a mix of sweetness from caramal malts and roasted character. The high abv is also prevalent. The flavor is dominated by strong malt character. Roasty flavors but mostly a malt sweetness. The sweetness is very overpowering. Finishes sweet with lingering mild bitterness and a reminder of the alcohol. Not pleasant, really. Full bodied and oily in character. Rather average.

The nose is pretty excellent. Rich and complex with toffee, some chocolate, dark caramel and a faint hop character, this is excellent. Especially as it warms up, the malt character shines. The yeast isn't particularly expressive here, this is all about the malt. And that's what the palate demonstrates too. Opening full in body with a soft, creamy carbonation, this beer has a beautiful blend of light smoke, dark caramel, chocolate and toffee. The milk chocolate in particular works nicely with the caramel and toffee. Mildly sweet on the finish, but with enough of dark caramel bitterness, a firming hop bitterness and a touch of burnt sugar as well, this is a thoroughly enjoyable beer. As such, a better beer than the barrel aged version.","DefenCorps","Dec 09, 2011"

The color is quite dark, almost black with some red tones. It is a bit sweet for my liking, but this probably makes it easier to drink more than one. My first impression of this beer wasn't a good one, however that was on a hot day tailgating. This is not a beach beer. I have come to appreciate more though as the weather has cooled. It is the perfect camping beer. I assume that is why it says pack it in pack it out on the can. Anyway I would give this beer a B overall. I will definitely drink it again.","Beer21","Nov 26, 2011"

It even seems somewhat oily. The lack of sweetness is so striking considering how cloying most examples of the style are. It's hard for me to decide if I like it since it wasn't what I was expecting.

Fluffy white head and plenty of lacing. Smell was peaty and smoky, which is something that I am really into right now. Taste was also a winner. Tons of malt, so it had a sweet side to it. But the smokiness gave it a dark side, and both sides seemed to compliment each other nicely. Mouthfeel was thick but smooth. The abv was present but was appropriate. I liked this beer a lot.

The mouthfeel is of notable substance...bold, thick, but not overpoweringly heavy. The drinkability is almost too good...this goes down dangerously easy for a beer weighing in at 8% abv. Overall? Holy Haggis!! This is one hell of a beautiful brew!! I'm gonna be buying quite a lot of this in the near future!!!","CJfromPhilly","Jun 15, 2010"

Aromas of caramel and sweet corn. Hints of some alcohol. Starts off sweet and the malts really start to take presedence. There is some hints of bubble gum and caramel popcorn. Really surprised by the flavor. I like to say that I do get metalic flavors but that might be mental. I really enjoyed this one.

I don't know what the big deal is about the head-- I poured right into the center of the glass and got a mountain of foam with very little fuss. It didn't last long, but it was medium dense and full of bubbles despite the low carbonation. Raisins, prunes, apricots, caramel and pears erupt in the aroma, followed by the distinct tang of alcohol, then a slightly smoky smell to finish. And that pretty much sums up the taste, too, except the ham-fisted alcohol squashes the malty, fruity flavors. It's not too sweet, not very dry but definitely suffers from the ABV.

It pours a dark amber with transparent reddish orange along the edges. Perhaps it was ruined by the can, but it only had only a light scotch malt and inexpensive alcohol aroma. A thin mouth feel initially, it filled out a bit when it warmed. The alcohol flavor did not match the taste and so reminded me of a steel reserve or other high alcohol cheap beer. However, as it warmed the caramel malts came out a bit more. In the end, after sitting for half an hour, the strengthened mouthfeel and slightly more complex flavor still could not overpower the overbearing alcohol finish.","Bfarr","Mar 05, 2010"

Full-bodied, layers itself like syrup on your tongue, if the carbonation didn't have a prickle to it it would be too cloying for sure. Brown sugar, cola, caramel, butterscotch, ginger, cinnamon, honeyed nuts make it a candidate for a Willy Wonka product. More floral here, glazed bread. Impressive in that it maintains a full throttle appeal throughout, however, nuance and contrast are not strong points.","farrago","Jan 29, 2010"
3.98,-0.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Served from a cellar temperature can into a chalice. The beer is a very dark ruby color; it seems darker than other Scottish style beers I've had. A slight head of tan bubbles disappeared to virtually nothing, just a spiderwork lacing of tiny foam in the center of the surface. It has a biscuit and caramel aroma, but it isn't too potent. This is a tasty Scotch ale! Loads of caramel malt and a hint of alcohol work well together. There may be some toffee in there or some other sort of non-candy sweetness, but I can't be sure. It has a light, smooth finish that leaves the slightest mouthcoating the evaporates as if it were pure alcohol. The body feels pretty heavy at first, but it seems to lighten after the beer first hits my mouth. I'm going to classify it as being on the lighter side of medium. Whatever it is, I like it. This is a very easy drinking beer. I may be a bit biased, as this is my favorite style of beer, but I could drink this entire six pack by myself. On top of that, each sip goes down so easily, I find myself reaching for my glass to take another drink without even thinking about it. I'm glad there are five more cans to drink.","ToasterChef","Jan 29, 2010"

Smells alcoholic, slightly smoky, somewhat toasted. Carbonation is the first thing I notice in my mouth, followed by smoked bicuity malts and dark toffee flavors. A slight metallic taste is detectable in the aftertaste. Light bodied, there is little coating and very little aftertaste, but overmuch carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, especially from a can, and I can see drinking many in a single sitting.","Ladybugger","Jan 29, 2010"

When poured straight into a 16 ounce mug it forms a nice frothy head and a deep amber-rich body. Since it is a Scotch-Style Ale the caramel and similar sweet flavors compliment the high alcohol percentage. I recommend for anyone that enjoys feeling a nice buzz after only 1 or 2 beers, even for the experienced drinker. Highly recommended.","ohFace","Jan 23, 2010"

Not really any bitterness from the hops that I can detect. It's the malts all the way. Very full bodied mouthfeel.

Just an inundation of sweet malts in the taste. You get a little smokiness with maybe some dark dried fruits, but it's tough to discern. There's some boozy alcohol present in the finish as well. It was odd popping open a can with little apparent carbonation. It had a pretty smooth feel and appropriate carbonation, but fell a little flat toward the end of the glass. I will admit that it did take a while to finish though.

Taste is rich in sweet malts and chocolate, a pretty nice caramel presence as well. Brown sugar lingers on the tongue. Taste is quite nice.

Ultimately, it ends up being a bit bland and one-dimensional in character, with a smooth but dominant, sweet rummy quality and no real complexity. It has a little oiliness but reall yht body is rather light and almost watery for the most part, making the oiliness a stick-to-the-back-of-the-tongue margarine character, which is not entirely successful in my book.

The flavor is malt forward without much hop character but a fairly strong bitter note. There are some roasted malt flavors present and a strong caramelized cola flavor. It's just too sweet, though.

This is just a malt monster...chewy, bready, some alcohol soaked fruit flavors, most prominently cherry. Some brandy characteristics. It has a very well developed malt character. No balance here at all. This is for malts what WCDIPAs are for hops. Killer.","allboutbierge","Sep 08, 2009"
4.25,6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Out of the can, this beer appears dark brown with red highlights. The initial head calms to a very light layer on the surface. Wow, the scent reminds me of a barrel aged beer, even though this is not. Lots of sweet malts, vanilla, chocolate, smoke, wood, and even leather in the nose. No hops that I can detect. The flavor is a recap of the aroma with plenty of bourbon vanilla and wood. Some nuttiness. What is the difference between scotch ale and scotch-style ale? All I know is that this one reigns supreme. Superb value to boot!","qchic","Sep 08, 2009"

I put off buying this as I was a bit apprehensive but I think I've found my new go to sweet malty beer. The appearance is darker than most of it's kind and it has a great malty sweet smell. The flavor is of malt and sweet brown sugar. It has a great mouthfeel for it's style with just thre right amount of carbonation. The 8% really creeps up on you but I could see myself drinking 2 or 3 of these in a night.

Initially thought the abv was excessive but it is needed to cut the thick body of the ale. Most drinkable Scotch Ale I've had. Canned on date indicates this is about two months old.

It is full bodied and very smooth. It's pillowy soft with a slick finish that's a little syrupy. This beer is pretty sweet, but balanced with a little resiny bitterness.

An incredible caramelly sweetness arrives first, then comes this bready, toasty smell. There's a little whiff of a chocolate and roasted coffee. Almost no hops to be found, but there is kind of an earthiness to it - like dirt and fallen leaves, smoky kind of. The taste delivers as well. Big malty sweetness, backed with bitter roasted coffee. The alcohol is hard to detect, but leaves a pleasant little burn. The smokiness kind of cling to your mouth, and just builds and builds, without ever reaching the burnt weeny level. The smokiness really balances out the sweetness, but I think the roasty bitterness and smokiness eventually overpower because of how they linger so much longer. Very complex and pleasant. This one is so thick and chewy, and actually well-carbonated, a bit prickly with the alcohol burn, despite not having much of a head. The clinging flavors are nice, but get annoying after a while. This one has a bit more alcohol than I'd expect. It's tough to handle more than one (though I did shotgun one without flinching a week ago). I figure anyone interested in a more malty, smoky beer should get their hands on it.","taylorhamrick","Feb 25, 2009"

Retention is ok, and a thin sheet of lace is left behind as the froth settles into a paper thin covering. Aroma involves a big hit of toasted malts up front. Right behind that exists some caramel notes, some candy (perhaps licorice and bubblegum). Tastes of roasted grains, earthy spice, subtle sweets, and a very slight, but noticeable hop bitterness. The alcohol is evident in the aftertaste, but not overwhelming. Although the mouth-feel is thick and creamy it has just enough viscosity to keep it from approaching chewiness.

The rich chocolate and caramel flavors mix nicely and hop bitterness is virtually non-existent. This is a malt bomb to be sure.

The beer is sweet smelling on the nose, very heavy on the caramel malt. The first flavor is a smokey caramel flavor, followed by malty sweetness. The finish is sweet with no discernable hop profile. This beer is a malt bomb. Even though this beer is medium bodied, to me it felt a bit thin. Perhaps this is a consequence of the light carbonation. The beer hides its 8% ABV quite well.

There isn't much head right from the can, a thin light brown froth that dissipates quickly. Lacing, there isn't any. The nose on the beer is very sweet caramels, some candy like aromas, a good bit of liquour sweetened fruit, and a bit of ABV. There isn't much carbonation to the beer, but most Scottish ales are pretty flat. This is a very sweet, molasses laden beer, with some coffee notes, plenty of ABV in the background. I'm getting some cherry chocolate notes as well. This is a very sweet Scottish ale, but there is enough of the roasted molasses and caramel flavors, some smokiness, a bit of peatiness to still be representative of the style. But it is sweet. Not a bad beer, I can see why people are raving over it, I'm just not a huge fan of the style and this is a bit too syrupy and cloying for me at any rate.","albern","Oct 24, 2008"

This beer somehow seemed to derive its sweetness from the hops and its bitterness from the malt, which was very interesting. Reminded me more of a porter than a Scottish ale.

Lot of chocolate malt, caramel and good amount of smoke. A little more smoke and I would have given a five. The taste is awesome. Very smooth. The choc malt hits the tongue just right and the smokiness adds a bit of character. Great mouthfeel as well. Creamy and solid. It's like eating instead of drinking. I could, and have, drank several in a session even though it's 8% ABV. It goes down smooth and doesn't overpower with the alcohol.

3.7,-7.7,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. The beer pours a dark amber, forming a thick creamy 1 inch tan head. Light lacing is visible as the head recedes. The aroma has a strong malt presence, but also there are hints of caramel and nuts. Taste is not as pronounced as the aroma would have suggested. Strong malt presence up front, followed by a light caramel/toffee flavor, and finishing with a slightly strong alcoholic finish. Light mouthfeel. Good flavor and thin body make for a drinkable beer. Overall, I'm still undecided whether I like this beer or not. The flavor is good, but the alcohol presence seems like it could have been covered up better. The mouthfeel is very smooth but a little on the thin side for a Scottish ale. Not bad, but there are other Scottish ales that fit the bill a bit better than this one. With that said, I still think that I have alot to learn regarding Scottish ales and their characteristics.","beeragent","Jun 13, 2008"

Lots of sweet malt, chocolate, and richness in the smell and taste makes this a sipper. Mostly I found this malty and sweet, with no perceptable contribution from hops.

Nose is deep toffee malt, lots of spicy caramel and chocolate. Smell's delicious. As the beer warms you get more of the roastedness as well. Taste is also solid - some bitter coffee, smokiness, and then that strong hit of sweet caramel malt. Cookies. Body's a little thin, for such a sweet flavor, but the carbonation's solid and works well with the spiciness.

The feel is moderate to well bodied with softer carbonation. Finishes malty sweet then with a roasted bitterness. A very nice Scottish ale, nice subtle smoke flavor to blend with the bold malt.

This had a generic but great ale Scottish Ale taste; thick and creamy with good chocolate and coffee malts kicking in and a smoothness that makes it easy to just keep pouring them back. The fact that this is 8 percent alcohol shows that they were really able to hide it and it is scary how one can session this. It not only has a sweetness but it is deceptive; a great beer all things considered.","clayrock81","Feb 26, 2008"

In the mouth, the toffee and chocolate continue to dominate the flavor. A quite dextrinous body is very creamy, the smoky/toasty flavors along with a vague bitterness are just enough to keep this ale balanced. The hops are just there in the warming finish. This Scottish is very low on carbonation and with a thick body has a nice mouthfeel.

The taste was light and not "overpowering" like some dark beers (Guiness) the appearance was that of a european ale that you would find in a pub.

Roasted almonds, coffee, some sweet caramel, and just a slight touch of chocolate. A pretty damn good nose in my opinion. This beers flavor is as equally good as the smell. The first flavor that jumped out at me was smoke, or charred wood. Tons of roasted malt, toasted nuts, some dark fruit, toffee, and just a little bit of a smooth alcohol kick in the finish. A great tasting beer in my opinion. Had a nice full, smooth, palate coating mouthfeel. Drinkability was decent but it seemed the beer was harder to drink the further down the glass I got.

Aggressively poured dark brown with a mocha color three finger foamy yet creamy head. Great rentention, leaving an excellent amount of sticky lacing around the glass from top to bottom. Upon pouring a blast of roasted coffee hits the nose. In the middle the scent of burnt chocolate chip cookies, caramel and vanilla shines through. I also got a hint of clean barnyard hay and plum. The initial taste is right on with the aroma. Semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and roasted coffee to start. I somehow got a little salty favor in the middle. Plum with a long bitter chocolate favor was left on my tongue, that left me longing for more. At 8% ABV, this smooth middle body, softly carbonated, creamy and oily feeling brew is a hit on my palate. I recommend pairing with a nice juicy burger. Enjoy","GimpyCane","Jun 23, 2007"

The flavor comes across a tad sharp at first, probably due to the use of lots of chocolate malt, but it mellows as it sits. Tasty. It has a full body and is very drinkable for 8%.

The beer does indeed prove that good beer can be followed by smashing its container in your forehead (not recommended, by the way). The beer is promising right from the git-go. A sturdy, deep mohogany color with ruby highlights, supported by a 1" lightly tanned foamstand that lasted the session. Moderate aromas of toffee, cocoa, molassas, caramel, and a light smoke scent turn into very bold, rich flavors of strong, toasted malts, caramell and toffee, a hint of coffee and peat-moss. A complementary hop flavor increases into the finish. Bold alcohols ride just behind the sweetness, providing a nice distraciton. The body is full and rich, but rests just before becomming chewy. Bready and earthy flavors and textures provide a lot of complexity well into the sweet toffee lingering. Folks, this is a good beer!","BEERchitect","Jun 19, 2007"

Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, malty with a bitter edge. Definitely a full bodied treat here. Surprisingly, this is very drinkable even with an 8% tag. I would never know if they didn't tell me and in my mind, that's a good thing. The only thing that prevents this from a great drinkability score is how full the mouthfeel is.

The middle brings more of a chocolate and roasted character. Finish is dried fruits, tobacco, alcohol, and smoked malts, which all linger on into the aftertaste.

It's a proper color for a Scotish ale, even if it is lacking a bit in the head department. The smell is a nice, malty affair with perhaps a hint of chocolate nose. The taste seals the deal, a faint undercurrent of smoky flavor comes through, just enough to qualify for the style but not enough to scare off the masses. Good mouthfeel, and for a 8% beer VERY drinkable. I'll try to keep a six of this around.","sideshowrob","Mar 17, 2007"

Very smooth and silky on the tongue, with subdued carbonation that's only big enough to add a touch of sharpness to an otherwise thick, could-be-sludgy beer. The taste is just right for the style, with robust chocolate malt and vanilla notes balanced by moderate bitterness. Very well done.

I also detect a hint of bitter chocolate and only a wisp of smoky peat flavor before an assertive earthy-mineral finish. Medium-full body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on slick.

A bit of wood and some smoke qualities round out the smell. The taste is full of malt, but not too sweet. Its exceptionally well done. Toasted malt and bread-crust flavors mingle all the way through the experience, and into the finish. The finish is lingering and full of roasted character.

Very malty and sweet, caramel and toffee, with low bitterness. Light smokiness and dried fruit as well, with chocolate growing in the finish. Medium bodied with medium/low carbonation, creamy texture with light alcohol warmth towards the end. A solid beer all around, enjoyable and easy to drink.

Taste isn't as sweet as I'd like my scottish ales. I get a bit of barely sweet caramel, butter, and that's about it. I long for more in the taste dept since I love this style. The lacing all the way down is a nice touch though. It's heavenly carbonated but the bubbles feel almost delicate. Very nice. It glides over the tongue. Drinkability isn't so high.

I tried it both from the can and poured into a pint glass, and the glass is certainly better though the can is serviceable. The nose is caramel and malty as might be expected. The taste of roasted malt combined with a little smokiness upfront makes for a nice flavor profile, but it ends up just a little too sweet.

Sweet honey bread taste and dark fruits compliment the chocolate. An earthy hoppy flavor and peat smoke slip in. Not too strong but they add another element to the flavor profile. Finish is a bit smoky, slightly alcoholic tasting, but still quite sweet and more caramelly. This is dessert in a can.

There's a wonderful mix of flavors here; a pervasive butterscotch base, a highly creamy maltiness, just a hint of decadent dark chocolate notes lingering - a heavenly mix.

4.29,7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Rich and complex, yet decently smooth, this is a winner. I drank this one on a boiling hot day and liked it. I imagine I'd appreciate the complexity (chocolate, coffee, and on, and on) more on a cold day, but I'm not complaining. This is really well made. It's not trying any smoke and mirror tricks by overwhelming drinkers with certain tastes. It's kind of subtle in its way. There are a nice amount of hops for such a rich, malty beer. Awww, just try it. I don't know what else to say.","GnomeKing","Jul 21, 2005"
3.95,-1.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This is an excellent American rendition of a strong Scottish Ale. Tasty, and quite drinkable. I'm impressed with the smoked maltiness and masked abv. More impressed, that this comes out of a can.","merlin48","Jun 25, 2005"

This would raise my kilt once, but I wouldn't dance around kicking up my knees over it. Bit smoky, toasty and warming. Almost too sweet. Old Chub in a can... This would be really nice on a late summer camping trip.","gbontrag","Apr 28, 2005"
4.12,2.7,3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Loved this beer! Drank from the can, so appearance rating is dead center. Hey, they went to alot of trouble to get it into the can, so why not use it? Also their little blurbs on the can lead one to believe they intend for you to enjoy it from the can. Hard to get a read on the nose through the little hole in the can, but I did detect some sweet malt and caramel. The taste is incredible - chocolate, coffee, toffee, sweet malt syrup...not really scotch ale territory in my opinion, but hey. Pleasantly thick in the mouth, almost comforting. I found this to be very drinkable - a dangerous trait in a beer with 8 abv. Go git yo' self some.","mrgrandefromage","Apr 10, 2005"
3.37,-16,3.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,"At first glance, I thought, "what's up with a seemingly upscale scotch ale...in a can?" Well, the people at Oskar Blues pretty much pulled it off. Pours a generous, lacy head that caused me to let it settle in before draining the can. Smells very, very malty, with hints of raisins and plums. Taste is very deep and rich, like the best scotch ales, without the faintest trace of hops. All in all a decent brew that suprised me...","troutmask96","Mar 19, 2005"
4.13,3,3.5,3,4.5,5,4.5,"I had no idea whatsoever what think of this stuff when I first saw it. Scottish ale? From the USA? In a can? Called "Old Chub"? What in bloody hell is this? It looks decent. Very, very dark red in colour with a slightly off-white head that dissipates quickly into a thin haze over the surface of the liquid. The smell is alright, I suppose. A little malty, not really much here. Didn't smell like much of anything. The taste, however, is fantastic! This is almost a smoke beer! Quite malty and very, very smoky in flavour!! Very tasty indeed. Absolutely full of smoke flavour. And the mouthfeel? Very, very smooth!! I do not hand out 5.0's very often at all, but here, one is certainly in order. This is very, very smooth and easy going brew. The package suggests that this is just awful. I mean, look at it. A Scottish ale from the USA in a 6pk can package called "Old Chub"? For Heaven's sake. Who thinks this sounds tasty? I do, however, encourage those who doubt it to try it. It is indeed very surprising. I WILL buy it again.","SilentSabre","Mar 18, 2005"

3.86,-3.7,4,3,4,4,4.5,"The taste is of brown and caramel malt and is somewhat sweet. There is body to it, but the process of drinking from a can makes it difficult to fully appreciate flavors.

Theres a big dose of brown sugar and caramel with the peat smoke in the flavor along with a slight bit of cocoa. A bit sticky but very tasty. The can doesnt make any negative difference.","aracauna","Nov 22, 2004"

3.98,-0.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Tawny-crimson bronze in hue, beautiful color depth, when held to a light a shiny coppery color emerged around the edges. A foamy beige head reached two fingers in height, on a slightly harder pour than normal, the head retention was good as it took a long moment before it collapsed to a soapy cap, then collar. The subsequent lacing was very webby, unorganized, but quite prevalent. The bouquet had good potency, lovely fruity sweet notes upfront but the closer I stuck my nose to the glass the more malty the beer smelled; notes of smoke, chocolate, burnt grains, as a whole it is very nice! Inviting. The palate is plenty tasty, vague smoky and burnt malts, a hint of sweet fruitiness, a fair amount of roastiness too, maybe a kiss of grassy hops at the finish. Long aftertaste than just begs me to eat some grilled meat. I like the taste might fine, it isnt that complex but I can live with that as the flavor construction is well thought-out and nicely balanced. I never would have guessed this had an 8% abv, I couldnt taste a lick of alcohol nor did I feel it. The mouthfeel was very ordinary; it is also a bit under-carbonated, kind of slick too but nothing to really complain about. This is highly drinkable; I cant believe a beer like this is available in a can! Beer drinkers in CO are so lucky. Bastards. Old Chub is labeled as a Scottish-style Ale, maybe a Scotch Ale is more accurate. Anyway. I purchased a single can for $1.49 in Fort Collins. Recommended.","bditty187","May 05, 2004"
4.2,4.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear deep amber color, and is topped by a good light brown head. Sticky, malty, candied notes waft from my glass as I pour. When I go in for a deeper sniff, I get toasted malt notes and a hint of roast malt at the end. Wow, this has a good solid mouthfeel and a nice rich body. There are lots of malt flavors here (caramel, biscuit, quite chewy actually). Perhaps a hint of roasty smoke in the finish. This beer is also subtly fruity with notes of raisins in it. This is a damn good beer in a can, certainly the best I have had up to this point. The hop perception is appropriately quite low, with only a hint of balancing bitterness in the finish. This is damn taste, for any beer, and it really hits the spot right now.","Gueuzedude","Apr 20, 2004"

4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The second canned beer from this great Colorado brewery, and as It sets in the glass a quite deep sanguineous color with ruby high lights, head is portly in size, creamy in texture and the color a toothsome light tan, as the head slowly evaporates a fine sheet of lace develops to seal off the glass, and as its consumed a fine set of Irish Rings is left behind to track your progress. Sweet malt nose, hints of toasted grain, fresh, crisp and quite pleasing to the olfactory and Ocular senses, start is sweet, nicely malted, top rich and pleasant in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops delightful in their spiciness, aftertaste quite dry, a fine representative to the style and one unfortunately we dont see much of here in the west.","Gusler","Dec 27, 2003"
