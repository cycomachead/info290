3.77,1.6,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Sweet malty, copper entry. Fruitiness is upfront and pronounced- prune, raisin, dark fruits. Cooked caramel adds some warmth to the glass. Soft, earthy hop bitterness comes in about 3/4 palate and on. Hops are slightly floral and pungent and the bitterness finishes soft and clean. Dull smoky notes are present from time to time, more apparent as the beer warms. Alcohol present from beginning to end, would like it to be covered a little better. Drinkability is average, hard to finish as the beer reaches room temp. Metallic taste in the aftertaste as the beer warms. Medium thin body. Carbonation is low, just enough to add to the beer versus take away from it.","mac31","Mar 01, 2015"

If you're gonna make an ale not of that ilk, as I imagine the design meeting proceeding, let's make it so true to its origins (i.e. no real discernible hops), that you couldn't mistake it for anything else. So there you have it - good, but a bit unbalanced, with a well-sublimated ABV overall.","biboergosum","Jul 11, 2013"

Pours very hazy deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense cream colored head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Slight spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, caramel, brown bread, brown sugar, tobacco, leather, peat, light smoke, light chocolate, and earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and big complexity of malt and light fruity notes. Taste of raisin, prune, molasses, toast, toffee, caramel, brown bread, leather, tobacco, peat, light smoke, light chocolate, and earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, molasses, toast, caramel, toffee, brown bread, leather, light tobacco, peat, light chocolate, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of malt and light fruity notes; but the overall flavor robustness feels weak for the style. No cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly slick and creamy mouthfeel that is ok. Mouthfeel feels much thinner than I expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice scotch ale style. Other than it being a bit thin in robustness of flavor and mouthfeel; there is a lot of nice flavor complexity and balance; and it is very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 07, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Very little aroma beyond yeast; very little taste beyond more yeast. Gets slightly richer as it warms, but also gets w-a-a-a-y too boozy. Pass.

I'll need to try more before making any conclusions about them, but I will say that despite their Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale tasting more like a standard Scottish ale (which I'm not a fan of) that had been intensely amped up than a wee heavy, I still enjoyed it. The other criticism of this beer that I have is that it is MUCH better when warm than cold. The label recommends letting it warm before drinking, which can sound like beer snobbery to some, but in this case it should be taken as a warning that the beer won't taste very good otherwise. While I agree that most beer tastes better at around 50+ I consider it a major weakness if one tastes this bad when cold.","MadeInOregon","May 14, 2011"

3.98,7.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep orange, almost brown pour with a sturdy frothy head. Deep sweet aromas with slight hints of hop presence. The hint of hops on the nose rushes to the front of the flavor profile. A mouth watering first gulp that finished sweet with only a slight hop finish. THe hops really concentrate on the sides of the tongue and back of the pallet leaving a pretty clean finish. There is a noticable alcohol presence as the drinking conintues, with a warming of the throat and chest. The body of the brew is on the thin side, not leaving a lot of texture. Still cannot detect the actual hop presence in the flavor through the nose. The flavor does not really resonate with me and ends up being relatively bland once the initial hop bittnerness goes away. I am not a fan of the mouthfeel, a bit thinish.","ArrogantDeadGuy","May 02, 2011"

Kinda reminds me of smoky apple cider as well. The hops cut through the first few sips. Grain and malt flavors are present, this combo also kinda tastes smoky, like a scotch or whiskey. Everything thing is there, just not popping out at my pallet. Scotch/smoke flavors cut through after several sips making me think twice about the hop comment. The carbonation is a little distracting, but not by much. I find it acceptable. The body is thin medium, which is nice. If it were any thicker I probably wouldn't enjoy this once it warms up. Not a bad batch of scotch ale.

Taste is decent, I guess I just am not a Scotch Ale kind of person. The Scotch taste is unmistakable but you can also taste the malt and caramel. The Scotch in the beer made it not particularly drinkable for me. After half a pint, I was about ready call quits on it.

The feel is moderate with initially a fizzy carbonation but which smooths out leading to a nice silky feel. Nice balance between sweet and roasted and the abv well hidden.

2.93,-21,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Opinion: I am a pretty big fan of this style of beer, but this particular one doesn't really ""do it for me"". The malts are off balance somehow. It should be a bit sweeter with no real hops or one particular malt component being this noticeable. The Peat malt is not one of my favorites, but even if that is what I am picking up, I would say that it is a peated Crystal Malt (If there is such a thing) or they went for a long boil and just burned the wort in the kettle. I don't know but the aftertaste is somewhat harsh to me. The beer is not so bad that I won't finish it, but I won't be buying this particular beer from Moylan's again in the near future.

But, once it warms up to room temperature, it's a little more forthcoming. Ends up a little on the sweet side, but never overwhelms the palate because the balance is never too far out of whack.

The mouth is medium, doesn't feel light though, decent carbonation. In all, based on the other Molyan's I've had, I was expecting more.

Overall this was definitely just a ""wee"" heavy, with a lighter malt flavor than some other richer Scotch Ales. But this had a very clean and refreshing flavor that hid the alcohol quite well, so it was very easy to drink. It had decent body too.

3.79,2.2,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Moylan's Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale pours a finger of tan foam over an opaque, cloudy, dark amber brew. Carbonation is slow and steady, the head collapses to a cream ring pretty quickly. The nose is yeasty, fruity funk- something like overripe apple. The flavor is sweetish malts trending toward tart cidery notes and a bit of herbal hop off the back (though there is little perceived bitterness). Mouthfeel is round, finishing a bit dry, and there's a bit of an herbal tea flavor in the aftertaste. Alcohol by volume is a decent 8%, though at no time is the alcohol noticeable. Usually, I like my Scotch Ales a little maltier and smokier than this one- something that echos the Scotch it could be if it was distilled.

When I decided to start writing reviews - this was one of the first I got. After every sip, I couldn't wait for the next. Try to take your time, as you should with beers like this - but it's tough. I wouldn't say the flavors are complex, but very distinct. Think of a caramel apple - and you'll taste one in this beer. But I wouldn't say this was a sweet beer at all. Light on the hops, and definitely not bitter. Oddly enough, by the end - as the last few drops had warmed up - it maintained that original flavor.

3.57,-3.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"This scotch ale pours a slightly hazy, orange-amber color with a whipped cream-like head of pale tan that is persistent. Sheets of lacing stick to the inner rim of the glassware as the head of foam slowly subsides. The nose betrays what makes this beer interesting - there is a subtle earthiness that leaves a slight twang in the nose, not unlike a single-malt scotch whiskey. Dancing around the base of roasted caramel malt and delicate fruitiness from the yeast, the distinct aroma of peat is revealed. The palate is likewise interesting, yet somewhat lighter and thinner than I'd hoped for. A decent backbone of roasted malts intermingle with the earthy peat notes you'd expect from a scotch ale/wee heavy. There is a faint astringency present here as well, lending to the dry character of this beer. Dryer than what I've come to expect for the style as well. Only light bitterness and virtually no detectable alcohol despite the 8% ABV. In flavor, this beer has more in common with a Scottish ale than it does with a Scotch ale, to my taste. My biggest knock on this beer is it's relatively thin mouth feel and slight over-carbonation. These don't combine to make a bad beer, by any means, but they do make this particular beer deviate from the style parameters somewhat. I'd suggest letting this one warm to cellar/ambient temperature before drinking, as this seems to help round the beer out just a bit. Over all, an enjoyable ""scotch light"" ale. If you're not accustomed to tasting peat in a beer, this is a good place to start since the peat character is kept subdued. Worth a try, for sure.","beerphilosopher","Sep 24, 2008"

The heard was rich, creamy and opaque. It quickly dissolved, but a fine ring of bubbles remained around the rim of the glass. The aroma was heavenly, a sweet mix of roasted malts and caramel, with a hint of alcohol. The color of the beer was a deep amber/ruby. There was also a good bit of lacing on the inside of the glass. The taste was very smooth, rich and complex. You can definitely taste the roasted malts, with a moderate amount of hopes in the background. This beer is a bit on the dry side, but not overly boozy with a good body.

3.64,-1.9,4,2.5,4,3,4.5,"Pours a brilliantly clear red-mahogany. Two finger off-white head; dense, and shows good retention. Produces a few specs of lasting lacing. Toasted crystal malt nose, with some faint smoked notes. Biscuity malt and dextrin sweetness upfront, followed by deeply toasted crystal and a very mellow oak aged flavor. Drying aftertaste, very light on hop bitterness, but the mild oak taste helps bring a very good balance to the overall flavor. Alcohol is very well concealed, especially considering it's thin body and low carbonation. Finishes semi-dry with lots of residual caramel and woody flavor, but no detectable booze. The lighter mouthfeel allows an excellent drinkability, on the other hand, the flavor is fairly weak for a Wee-Heavy.","PBRstreetgang","Jul 11, 2006"

Aroma is dominated by sweet malt, combined with (surprisingly) an almost banana-like fruitiness. Flavor starts of with big toasty malt. An apple-like fruitiness becomes apparent mid-palate (with still more traces of that surprising banana), though only after ones mouth has had time to become accustomed to the peaty malt. Alcohol lends a robust spiciness to the finish  a bit too present at first, though once its worked its magic on you, funny, you dont seem to care much anymore.

There was a slight hop finish but was more sourish in nature. Not sure if it was spoiled, there was some carbonation to it.

3.97,7,4,4.5,4,2.5,4,"Deep garnet hue w/ excellent clarity. The light beige head settles readily into a thin ring that manages spotty lace. Assertive dark caramel and molasses sweetness hit the nose upfront and are ensued by signature Moylans jackfruit like fruity esters, hints of raisin and peated malt. A mellow floral Goldings hop nose rounds out the aroma. Butterscotch diacetyl emerges as the beer breathes. A combination of date - like and dark caramel sweetness is perceived initially, then fades into a melange of roasted unmalted barley, mild hop bitterness and mild butterscotch. Jackfruit - like esters emerge mid palate, and although odd for a Scotch Ale, provide an enjoyable contrast to the initial sweetness. Unfortunately, the body is a bit thin, and doesn't adequately support the rich malt profile. Hop bitterness is appropriately low, leaving overall balance skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes with light toffee notes slowly fading. Kilt Lifter is quite an enjoyable and unique brew. It's much fruitier than a Scottish Ale or Wee heavy, yet still has a rich malt profile. My only qualm is the relatively weak body. It's definitely worth a try.","marc77","0"
4.1,10.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Hazy amber with an orangish-brown tint, topped by a thin but creamy, very light golden-tan head that drops but leaves a good collar and some nice lace. I give them great credit for nailing the fruit and malt character of a true Scottish ale - very nice big fruit (some nice strawberry) with a caramelized maltiness. Medium body with a gentle carbonation lending to a supple, silky mouthfeel. The flavor is well balanced with a bitterness that is omni-present but never really emerges, clearly playing a supporting role to the malt. The maltiness is light and has a lightly burnt or caramelized sugar quality to it. My guess is that they're using mainly pale malt with a small dose of roasted barley that is caramelized in the kettle - rather than using British crystal - although there may be a small percentage. The peat smokiness is most apparent in the finish, but quite restrained amongst a somewhat sticky malt. It becomes much more apparent, however, as you move through the glass eventually leaving you with a light mouthfull of smoke. Very authentic. Not exactly what I would call a ""Scotch Ale", but I won't quibble over the designation other than stating that I'd personally term it a 90 -/- ale. Quite nice. Extremely well balanced and very drinkable. I'd love to try this cask-conditioned.","NeroFiddled","Jun 07, 2002"
