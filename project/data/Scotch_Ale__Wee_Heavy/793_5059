Maybe it was just an off night for me on this one. I like my strong beers, but this scotch ale seemed a little to much taste up front.

There is something sour in there like cranberries or something along those lines. A little twang of vinegar hits at the end. You can feel something that hints of booze on your lips and tastes somewhat of smoked malt like scotch. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, but it isn't overly filling for something this dark. I couldn't find an ABV for this, but I'm betting it's up there. This stuff could knock you around if you are not carefull. Overall I enjoyed the complex malty boozey flavor of this beer.

4.27,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours out a deep mahogany color. Actually nice and clear, I can see right through it, which is kind of rare for the color. The head pours out very dense, and just over 1 cm. Leaves pretty decent lacing. A good looking scotch ale. The smell has the two main ingredients - a lot of burnt caramel sweetness and a nice touch of smoke. As you search, there's a deep, earthy sweetness, maybe from a bit of hops or some other addition, but a nice earthy leafy kind of smell, like pipe tobacco almost, but much sweeter. Then there gets to be this chocolatey smell, almost with a bit of coffee in it, pushed along by a bit of smoke. The taste has a bit more of the smoke than the smell does, but it doesn't get you upfront, you taste everything else first, and then the smoke fills it up, almost getting to that meaty level, but then falling back into the malty sweetness. The things you taste first are this dense burnt cake kind of taste. It's like you put a slice pound cake into a toaster until it got kind of brown. There's a nice earthy note in the middle, maybe a little leafy, like a tea made of dried up, withered, almost burnt leaves. I guess those two things don't sound too good, but when they're rounded out with a bit of sweetness, they make a brilliant scotch ale - which is what this is. Sometimes, with the right amount of smokiness, the right amount of sweetness, and the right amount of earthiness, a scotch ale can taste, at points, a bit like the harder drink of the same region. This one does that a bit. I'm a fan. The body is good, over medium, but not syrupy, but the carbonation is a little more than I expect. There's a slight sting, which isn't unpleasant, but it's uncharacteristic for the style. This is a very nice drink. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and kept finding new things to keep me interested. Of course, I couldn't sit and session this, I doubt if I could drink more than one, due to the alcohol content and to the intensity of flavor, but if I was in the mood for a scotch ale, and this was nearby, I would not hesitate to buy it.","taylorhamrick","Jul 31, 2009"

3.44,-14.9,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a nice little head with some coaxing and has a seemingly very nice little lacing. The color is dark brown with an amber hue. The first smell was a little weak, but there's a slight sweetness to it that doesn't seem to fit just right. The smell is very light, it has the sweet smell and almost no roasty characteristics at all. The taste is a little watery, it has a little roastiness present with some light sweet tones to it as well. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth and didn't have anything wrong with it besides a small amount of watery feel to it. Overall I might actually try this again.","Erdinger2003","Nov 22, 2006"
3.48,-13.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Originally reviewed on December 30, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Sweet caramel malt and pear aroma. Deep brown murky color, with a creamy tan head. Heavily nutty flavor, with hazelnuts and pecans over cream and butter. Palate is wicking, almost immeadiately evaporating and dissapating, but for a Scottish Ale respectable. Unfortunately, at the end over the dry nutty smack a blast of stryofoam.","CharlesDarwin","Nov 09, 2006"
4.65,15.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3 1/2"" tan head over the cloudy reddish brew. Head fades VERY slowly, with lots of heavy sticking lace. Aroma is rich sweet maltiness. Flavor is chocolate sweet upfront, with light bitterness, and the malts carry through from beginning to end. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and drinkability is excellent. Liked this better from the growler, but the bottled offering is definitely nothing to sneeze at either. Would accept some of this anytime anyone had some available for me.","ppoitras","Nov 01, 2006"

The profile does seem to have changed, and the roasted and toasted malts have moved further towards the forefront, with some peaty notes on the nose.

4.52,11.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Bottle shared by crosling at a BA gathering. What a great time I had. Pours a thin light brown head over a cloudy brown red liquid. Smells caramel butter. A light and dancing flower that I can't quite put my finger on? A little bit of honey and some green apple. A small bit of citrus carried by a pleasing waft of alcohol. Tastes butterscotch with a nice caramel and munich malt aftertaste that just hangs around forever. Dry mixes with the slick butterscotch in a pleasing combination. A hint of sour green apple adds an underlying edge of complexity. Hops I can't identify, but may be the darkish flavor that held like deep baratone ""oohhhmmmm"". Md body and moderately carbonated. What a wonderful beer.","mentor","Beers"

The taste is fantastic. Big malty goodness with an incredible sweetness like a doppelbock but a bit more subtle. The body is just as incredible making for a looong lasting aftertaste even with a small sip. Caramel, hop bitterness and a malty goodness all in perfect balance making this a truly unique and satisfying brew. Thanks to dirtylou for this excellent WI beer.","lou91","0"

A fair amount of hop bittering in the taste balances the sweet caramel and chocolate well. Ridiculously smooth mouthfeel could almost be mistaken for watery, but it's deceivingly big. Warped Speed is a little piece of heaven in a bottle.","battlekow","Aug 22, 2005"

It pours a deep ruby color with a finger of head that falls to a slight coat over the beer. The nose is very nice, with a sweet caramel and slight fruity base. There is a sweet smokeyness in there as well. Its very enticing. The flavor is right on there with the nose, but with a slight pepperyness on the finish. I like that pepperyness. There is also a slight hint of hop bitterness on the finish as well. The feel is moderate to thick with a small carb. Overall, this really is a nice brew.

The first thing that hits you on the first sip is the creamy smooth mouthfeel. Very silky and luxurious. The malt takes the form of wonderful caramel covered dark fruit, which really slides down the throat with ease. Some mild smokiness shows up in the finish, as well as a mild hop bitterness which really makes you want that next sip. I could drink a ton!","PatYoda","Apr 04, 2005"

The malts really stick out here, as they should in a scotch ale, but the depth of this brew is incredible. Caramel, and earthy flavors pop through, maybe some smokey wood flavors. All I can say is if you are in south central Wisconsin go and buy yourself some of this brew. This is only my second growler of this stuff and I am in complete love. If only it were available near me. Second only to its big brother the scotch reserve.","bnuttz","Jan 30, 2005"

Huge malty flavor with chocolate and caramel, but not too sweet. Malt flavor turns to smokiness, like smoked salmon. Very complex, and a great combination of flavors. Perfect medium to full mouthfeel. I'm not sure what the abv of this beers is, but it is dangerously drinkable. I finished a growler in one evening.

The color is nice and dark with a little red-orange backlight. The head wasn't large, but I didn't expect it to be. The sweet malt aroma filled the nostrils and the sweetness on the tongue was an excellent finish. The alcohol was nicely hidden, but I can tell this one is pretty-heavily leaded based on the sommersaults my mind started doing.
