"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, dark/bready malt, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice scotch ale. Good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. Really needed to be a bit bolder on malt flavors, but still a nicely enjoyable offering."

"The carbonation is even, making for a consistent, strong crispness in a medium body. It also manages a good smoothness all the way through."

"O - This is a tasty wee heavy. The alcohol becomes apparent as it warms."

"A tad disappointing with the head retention, but the toasted, chewy malt flavors readily offset this minor fault. A respectable sipper..."

"O: Like drinking caramelized simple syrup. I know this is supposed to be a sweeter style of beer but for my palate the amount of sugar here covers up any other complexities this may have"
"Overall/Comments: Very different from any other scotch ale that I've had. I enjoyed this but thought it was a bit overly sweet. Very well balanced with the alcohol masked very well. Classified as a Wee Heavy/Scotch Ale @ 8.2% ABV. Consumed 5/2/2013."

"Overall good. Worth a try."

"O: Overall it was a good malty beer, but I felt a bit cheated on the rye. I would probably not get it again, because it is overwhelmed by alcohol esters above all else. I would try it again if I could get it from a cask or keg, but it just seems fairly bland."
"Overall- This is more of the actual Wee Heavy foriegn style rather then the Scotch ale american style that I prefer. Void of the carmel and peat flavors that Ive come acustom to."
""
""
"O - Delicious! I like this caramel-butterscotch and toasted malt bomb. One bottle is enough, to be sure, but it's quite enjoyable, like a decadent dessert. An interesting take on the style, it leans decisively toward the sugar end of this style's spectrum, and lacks the peaty smokiness and malt-dominant expressions most try to achieve. Keeping that in mind, I definitely recommend this as a nitecap to be savored."

"Overall: There is a lot of confusion about this beer and, I must admit, that I was confused, too; then I realized that this is not a classic Wee Heavy but a Wee Heavy Scotch style RED ale; so maybe this is a Scottish twist on an Irish Red but, even so, I cannot say that it is something I would return to anytime soon"
"A reddish amber color with a decent off-white head and similar lacing. It’s a bit hazy with particulate. The aroma is full of cinnamon apple and mild cherry malt alcohol. Very odd and not exactly thrilling me. Certainly not what I expected. The flavor brings more of the cherry-apple sweetness along with wheat wine ideas. Some grassy rhubarb bitterness hidden in there. It’s medium bodied but with a fairly aggressive carbonation that tempers a bit of a wine-like feel. This is good enough but not as good as most of my previous Hoppin’ Frog experiences, and certainly nothing approaching the label’s promising descriptions. But still worth a try, especially if your a fan of wheat wines."
"Enough saccharine to be called Pop Love Song in a Bottle. Doesn't really hew to the scotch ale line, but I'll take it. Good beer."

"O - Not bad at all but the boozy qualities kind of dominate the other flavors I was looking forward to in the nose"
"Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, with a sweet aftertaste, and the alcohol is well hidden. A nice tasting beer, but not very complex, and not as good as the best Wee Heavy's, but worth trying, and worth having again."
""
"Overall, not so good for a scotch ale. The color is too light but I could get past that of the other elements were better. The flavor is slightly watered down and winey, the body is too thin. The sweetness is good and the peat flavor but it needs some roasted malt which would add some thickness to the body, complexity to the flavor and a darker color."
"Overall, an enjoyable, complex, rich, delicious sipper, but not the most outstanding example of this style."
""
"Overall this is not your typical scotch style ale. It is a good, but not great, example."

"Trying my first Hoppin Frog....the Wee Heavy Scotch is a big beer that is AMAZING!!! The beer initially pours (22oz bottle) clear amber with very thin white head that is not lacing. The smell includes a dark cherry with slight sweet malt. The taste is very sweet malt with great scotch support. The mouthfeel is full with good carbontation. Overall...NICE!"
"dark ruby brown with a huge tan colored head. A great amount of lace was left down the glass, and the settling of the beer was a fantastic site, grat pour, looked perfect. Smell was sweet right away. Lots of sugar and caramel smells, hints of grains and breads and even a light hop presence rounded this put nicely. The taste followed right away, but was alot more hoppy then I had envisioned. Lots of caramel and sugar flavors, and more then a hint of alcohol made up the bulk of it. Big hoppy finish which suprised me in a good way. The taste and feel were both very full, smooth and creamy."

"I'm a huge fan of sweet dessert-style beers, but this is a bit much even for me."
""
"Overall an ok beer, not as rich as I would like. A little too syrupy as well."
"Overall: hoppin frog is new round these parts and this is a pleasant surprise."
"I really like what Hoppin’ Frog has done here. Big flavors, true to the style, a very high quality beer. I have had four beers from Hoppin’ Frog, and all have been very good to great."
"O: Not half bad but nothing mind blowing. I probably won’t seek this out again but I enjoyed the bottle."
"Overall, glad I tried it but not one I'm likely to get again."
"-Cheers"
"Overall what the heck? This is not what I was expecting so I can not rate it very high for a Scotch Ale. A wild hybrid it seems that’s for sure."
"Taste – The first sip is nice. I do detect the hint of rye that is stated on the bottle. They claim it is “Scotch-like”, but I get little to no smokiness or peatiness. The second sip invokes a pleasant raison-y caramel taste. This is very drinkable for its high alcohol content. As I continue to imbibe, the bite of the rye and the caramel malts dominate."
"Nice nutty malts with a light buttery aspect. Cleaner than it smells and is surprisingly smooth. ABV is well hidden. Little bit of earthiness, but the typical peat and smoke is missing from this one. That said, I am astonished by how much I like this beer. The whole is much greater than the sum of it's parts on this one. It really comes together nicely, just a fun, smooth and easy beer to drink."
"This beer pours a medium bodied, reddish/amberish in color with only a light white lacing around the rim of my snifter. It smells very sweet. The aromas consist of grains, caramel malts, pale malts, caramel, candied fruit, and brown sugar. The flavors are a mix of grains, caramel malts, candied fruit and soda syrup. It's heavy on the grains and it's a little sweet. I'd almost say it has cherry influences as well. It drinks very smoothly, especially for the style. Overall this is a decent brew, just not exceptional. I got this one for 4.99 so it was well worth the price."
"Overall - Its tasty and really represents the wee heavy scotttish ales quite well. Its a real flavor bomb and might be a little over the top for most but this is what i expected from hoppin frog beers."
"Not bad and I hope this bodes well for the Manalishi and their B.O.R.I.S. if I can find it."
"This one is a lumbering bear of a hot, sweet drink. I'm a big malt fan but maybe this needs some crazy oriental flavors to go with it, or some seriously hot spice to cool down."
"Pours a light copper color with a reddish hue. Short white head sits for a moment before fading into a thin collar. The nose provides a touch of caramel malt and some slight breadiness. A bit of alcohol there as well. The taste is quite plain. There's a slight burn from the alcohol and a bit of bread. None of the deep sugary notes I would expect from a scotch ale. Completely off for the style. Medium body with a slightly dry finish. Just okay."
"D- If it were up to the nose, I'd drink a bunch... the high ABV is tough and just above average taste, it's meh..."
"At 8.20%abv, this one is pretty big. It's tasty enough, but you wouldn't be advised to down more than a couple in a session."
"Drinks very easy, a nice take on the style, but over priced IMO"
"Fairly drinkable, if not slightly weak in flavor. Still, I'd gladly have this beer again."
"D - This is a good scotch ale. There are better out there but this one is certainly worth picking up."
"Drinkability: Delicious and smooth, I could drink this beer all night. The style doesn't have tremendous drinkability due to the strength, but this is too good an example not to have a few."
"D: Goes down quite nicely and the bomber was not too difficult to finish."
"Not bad, not especially great, but not bad. Poured with a small to medium ligh tan head that shortly disappeared and no lace. Color is a clear orange copper amber. Aroma is malt, bananas, circus peanuts, caramel. Flavor's pretty much the same, with some malty sweetness coming to the fore. Body's ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of about medium length. Meh."
"D: A well made, drinkable beer."
"Full body, with a sweet aftertaste, caramel, with some hop in the back."
"Poured into a tulip glass a lighter than expected copper/bronze with a thinner but nice creamy-like 1/2 finger off white head.Big juicy fruitiness in the nose,it really stands out nicely with a mix of caramel and sweetish alcohol.The big fruitiness is not quite as big on the palate,its quite sweet, the caramel and that fruitiness being predominanat,not enough balance to keep it real drinkable.Its good but not great,to one sided in its sweetness in my opinion."
"Yay, another occasion for my seldom-used thistle goblet! This guy pours a clear burnt amber with a half-finger of white mini-foam on top, which dissipates rather quickly. The nose comprises caramel, cinnamon, cashews, and that awesomely vague sense of wheat that pervades many a beer. The taste holds notes of molasses, cloves, maple syrup, red apple skin, lemongrass, and that hot cinnamon you'd find in tasty, breath-freshening gums (y'know, the kind with flavor crystals and whatnot). The body is medium, with a semi-active carbonation and a light oral coating. Overall, a decently solid brew, but nothing all that impressive. A good introduction to the brewery for me, though."
"d - I thought this was a really good Scotch ale. Lots of smooth malts, I found it very enjoyable. Would try again."
"This poured a clear, dark copper with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like caramel malt and bready yeast, with nutty malt and biscuit and a bit of orange zest. It tasted like caramel and orange and milk chocolate, with some dark fruit and honey wheat. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a good scent and a great taste and body. It was very sweet and malty from the scotch ale style, but it was also very juicy from the red ale style, which was a great blend. The alcohol was undetectable and the beer had a super smooth finish, so this was dangerously easy to drink. It wasn't the most bold scotch ale ever, but it was unique and very rewarding, and crazy drinkable. Definitely recommended."
"Comes out of the bottle a nice, warm, clear cinnamon brown with a decent off-white head that does not stick around too long. Aroma is mainly malty with a sweet, fruity overtone. Flavor is mainly fruity, apple and banana, rather sweet but not cloying, with a nice malty undertone and just a whisper of hops. Texture is pleasantly smooth and has a little fizz to it."
"Oh well, you can't win 'em all!"
"D Very good, delicious! 4.5"
"D- High, no sign of the ABV, tasty... really impressed! A great beer."
"D: This was a really disappointing effort. I enjoy a good wee heavy once in awhile, but this wasn't it."
"Drinkability - pretty darn drinkable for the style. A touch sweet but I ain't complaining."
"D: Drinkability was decent, fairing much better as it warmed to near room temperature. Boozy, even at 8.2% it came off dry and toasty with an alcohol warming making this a moderate sipper."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer and am glad that I finally tried it; great flavors, dig the smell; it's pretty filling, but to polish off a 22 oz. bottle wasn't too much of a problem."
"D/ nice beer for the cold nights its says keep cool but drink it at room tempreture."
"Not sure that I would have nailed this as a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy. It does, however, have a malty character, albeit on the lighter side, and a touch of minty rye. Out of style - pretty good - nice enough taste. Pretty easy to drink for abv."
"Drinkability: Above average for a wee-heavy. But not as drinkable as my favorite... A bit too sweet for my taste."
"Drinkability: this beer was a bit too sweet for me and I did not find it very enjoyable. Slow sipping beer here."
"D - An interesting and solid take on my favorite style... It's sweet as expected, but in a slightly non traditional way with less caramel and more sweet fruit... A sipper, that I would gladly revisit again time and time again..."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is toasted malt, caramel, and some toffee. Taste is sweet and malty. It's similar to the aroma, it tastes like toasted malt, caramel, tea, and a little bit of spice, likely from the rye in this beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit chewy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. I think this is a decent enough beer, but this isn't one of the better Scotch Ales I've had. With that being said, it's worth a try."
"I love rye malt in beers, but it seems out of place in such a malt driven style as this. Still, a very tasty Scotch ale that is pleasantly drinakble."
"Poured a nice dark red/caramel color with some nice head and almost decent lacing. Deep malty scent with hints of caramel. Deep malty flavor as well, with a little caramel in the taste and a huge warming hit of alcohol in it. Great winter beer, but I would've liked a little less alcohol and a lot more malted peat (of which I got no notice of). Still, a nice deep malty brew."
"D- Overall, this isn't a bad scotch ale. Definitely a sipper. Recommended!"
"Pours a thick/hazy golden red/amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is sweet, malty, slightly toasty, with a good dose of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with some toastyness, nice little touch of rye, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice one, recommended."
"Forget the smell score because it pulls the total score down too far. Outta Kilter is a solid effort if you like them sweet and malty... and even if you're a hophead. This Hoppin' Frog brew is a pleasant surprise that I'll be sure to look for on my next trip to the Buckeye State."
"22 oz. Amber pour, not real dark. Nearly no head to speak of, some whitish bubbles. Smell has some sweetness, malt, raisin, peat. Taste is not nearly as sweet as I was expecting. Some malt, toffee, but some sour/bittersweet fruit like green apple. Gets slightly better as it warms, with some peat and char adding to more malt sweetness. Lack of carbonation hurt the mouthfeel a bit, but it was not non-existent. Alcohol is not noticeable. Overall a bit disappointed, not as good as their darker brews I've had. Nearly makes me wonder if I got a bad bottle."
"This flips my kilt!!"
"Na Zdravje!"
"D- it was OK. not the best american attempt at this style. probably wont be buying this one again. i guess i didnt really lke it overall."
"Pours a coppery amber with no head and almost no bubbling. The aroma is a candy caramel toasted malt with a litte nutty liquer mixed in. The taste is super malty from start to finish. But sweet caramel malts with a more candy like note into the middle of the palate. The finish stays pretty sweet throughout and no noticeable hops or rye as the label states. The abv adds a Frangelica like taste and warm feel as well. Pretty smooth but also syrupy palate. Took me bout an hour two enjoy all 22ozs of this beer. A sipper."
"Split a bomber of this with a couple friends. Poured into a pint glass. Clear copper with a small white head. Good retention. Flavors and aromas are strong and malty. Bready, touch of alcohol, touch of maple syrup. Moderate mouthfeel. A very good example of a scotch ale. Not the best I've tasted, but another solid offering from Hoppin' Frog."
"Eric"
"HV"
"D: Solid all-around, and lacking the pronounced sweetness of many Scotch ales, this one is highly drinkable. Get some."
"D- Easy to drink, didn't pick up any of the alcohol in this one at then saw the bottle and it said 8.2%. Pretty solid not my favorite of the style but a good effort."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"Nice job Hoppin' Frog!"
"Poured a medium to deeper amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, grainy, and some woodiness. Tastes of caramel, toffee, light wood, and toasted nuts. I also wote down I was getting some berries in there (hmm). Light lacing left on the glass."
"Good brew."
"D- Definitely drinkable, I can picture drinking this one around the holidays, it has that spiced atmosphere"
"D- Not sure of the ABV but one was good enough for me. This is not really my style but i'm glad that Hoppin frog is experimenting, they do good work."
"D: Not sure of the ABV but this could be pretty drinkable. Not my first choice but still pretty tasty!"
