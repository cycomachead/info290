The nose comprises caramel, baked toffee, orange peel, and some light cocoa. The taste does not deviate much at all from this plan of attack, save for a slight increase in the orange character. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth-ish feel. Overall, a pretty nice scotch ale, one that does not disappoint, even if it doesn't necessarily impress, either.","TMoney2591","Mar 26, 2011"

4.24,5.7,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours deep cooper with thin tan head. Aroma has nice sweet malts, some peat?, caramel and alcohol. Taste is similar. Medium bodied with a slick texture and smooth finish. The bourbon is not overstated-its provides some nice warmth as it goes down. To me, the star is the caramelley goodness of the beer. Mmmmm. I would love more of this","trappistlover","0"
4.08,1.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"I would personally like to see a further developed caramel flavor, and a hair less roast/toast, but Sheep Shagger is quite good, and drinks pretty easily for a beer of this heft.","plfahey","Mar 14, 2011"

3.85,-4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Soft coppery color. Bready and malty aroma-somewhat toffeeish and caramel like. Malty flavor upfront, maybe a kiss of hops. The toffee/caramel thing continues throughout the flavor. Just a faint smoke tinge though that may be more of the malt coming thru then anything. Silky mouthfeel. Nice Scottish ale for sure. One of the better US versions.","lackenhauser","Dec 19, 2010"

Taste is earthy and slightly sweet up front. Very faint hints of vanilla and cherries. It dries out in the middle with a smokey and slightly sour flavor. Smokey and malty at the finish with a noticable boozey feeling on my lips. It does have some of the smoked malt characteristics of scotch whisky. This is a big beer. Moderately thick body, but the complex flavors and high abv mean this one is for sipping. I came in last night from the -5 degree weather and cracked one of these open. Hit the spot very nicely.","lester619","Dec 06, 2010"

It drinks pretty nutty and has a good rich hazelnut flavor to it. I was very surprised. It drinks medium bodied with light carbonation. You'd never know it was 7.7%. I would've guessed around 6%. This one is very drinkable. I don't like scotch ales in particular but this is a good one. It's definitely worth a try.","aasher","0"
4.53,13,3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a murky pale brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and vanishes within seconds into a mere ring of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is of peat, caramel, nuts, and chocolate. The beer smells like a candy bar smoke with peat. I really like the uniqueness of this aroma. The taste has more caramel than the aroma. There is still a lot of peat, and a solid nuttiness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a very silky texture, and fine carbonation. Overall, this is a really, really good scotch ale. I can see this becoming my go to beer for the style.","KarlHungus","Jul 08, 2010"

The aroma is very complex; sweet caramel, hints of roast and chocolate and there is also a bit of tobacco/earthy aroma. The flavor is initially loads of bittersweet malt with just a bit of carbonic bite. The flavor transitions to a slight roast with a bit of smoke and pleasant slightly dry finish. The carbonation is moderate with medium-full body. Overall a very complex, flavorful, well crafted brew. I bought a 6er and am glad - I will very much enjoy sipping each one.","uwmgdman","Dec 23, 2009"
