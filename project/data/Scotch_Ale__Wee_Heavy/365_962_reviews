"Overall: More towards and amber than Scotch ale, but drinkable and relatively fully flavored; especially good as an option during travel."
"Pours a dark caramel color with minimal head. Mouthfeel is light with a refreshing floral finish. Pine, woodsy feel. Overall not a ton of taste though. Fairly bland until the aftertaste"

"Had this on tap at Pike. Nothing real special, just average. There wasn't anything that stood out positive or neg. Would have liked more ABV. I compare it to Oskar Blues Old Chub without the 8%."

"Pours an orangey-ruby, cloudy with short-lived fizzy off-white head. There's a little bit of lacing. The aroma is fairly simple, with just nondescript malt sweetness. The taste is about the same. There's not a lot to either. It does have a decent weight to the body, though. A surprising miss from Pike."

"Overall, good Scotch Ale I would have again."

"Overall / Drinkability: Not an amazing scotch ale/wee heavy, just ok. Does go well with food though (beef burger sliders and deviled eggs in this case). While not very remarkable, this does not mean it's bland, just that I've had better examples of the style. Of final note, it's actually quite drinkable - a very good beer to drink in quantity and wash down food with as a complement. Just enough flavor to complement and be enjoyable, not too much to overwhelm or clash with a meal. So I'll give it higher marks on drinkability than on being a good scotch ale."

"This one never gets it all together at the same time. Individual elements were okay, but..."

"This beer delivered the goods. Appearance was consistently opaque, almost sultry - this ale would indeed be seductive. Mouth feel is crisp and velvety. Two or three of these and you will be on your way."
""
"overall, a very general kind of brew. easy to drink with a decent abv, but like the others from this brewery, not terribly memorable. probably very nice fresh out of the tap at the brewery..."
""
"Nothing offensive, but also nothing particularly exciting either."

""
""
""
""
"Overall- Above average. I would give it a try if you aren't expecting a very heavy scotch ale. Fairly accessible for the style- could be good for drinkers new to it."

"O: A solid offering that is a must try for fans of malty beers."
""
""
"It's tasty, and it has the scotch ale characters, but they're more like scotch ale light. Mildly peaty and toasty, easy enough to drink. Needs more flavor. It gets a little boost from my nostalgic appreciation."

"This beer was pretty expensive, at nearly $10 a six pack, but I figure it's good to splurge on some good beer on occasion. This was enough of a taste treat to make it worthwhile."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer it has a good malty flavor . The smell is average. I like the taste and mouthfeel this beer is a must try . It is an above average beer not to bitter at all . Try this out when you see it. You will not be dissappointed you may actually even like it its a great session beer with the buds no doubt."

""

"O- Well below average. I enjoy this style, but this beer misses it."
"Overall- I think a decent representation of the style. It improves as it warms in the glass I think I would like to see it a touch clearer in the glass, and maybe a touch less boozy."

"Poured on tap at the tasting room into a shaker (everything it seems comes in a shaker here). Poured a deep ruby orange toffee color with a fair off-white head. Leaves some runny lacing with minimal sustainability through the glass. The nose was roasted malt and toffee with an overwhelming burnt sugar smell. If you've ever gotten sugar on a stove eye before, you know the smell. It was hard to get past. However, the taste was very pleasant overall. Had a nice fruity hop background to a huge malt bill. It was full of caramel and brown bread. Very heavy mouthfeel. Good beer, but not the best ""Scotch Ale"" I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a reddish copper amber with a fine one finger very light tan head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, apple cider, tea and a hint of peat. Smooth flavor of caramel malt, light grassy hops, slight fruit juice and a hint of peat. So well balanced that no flavors really stand out. Medium bodied with great creaminess. A very nicely integrated and easy to drink Scotch ale. I wouldn't mind a bit more aggressive peat, but very nicely made."
""
""
"Had a pint at TK Irish Pub. Brownish amber hazy in color. Small creamy head. Pretty malty and mildly hopped. Ever so slightly syrup feel. Good flavor. Alcohol takes effect in this one quickly which is a little suprising at 6.50%. I like this beer, but I'm unsure about the style it's under. I found it more comparable to something like Fat Tire or even Alaskan Amber. Anyways, enjoyed it and will have again."

"For a beer that's been around forever, this is pretty anemic. But it's not too offensive and maybe that's what keeps it selling at the brewpub. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Total Wine in Huntington Beach, California, where you'll find all sorts of oddities regardless of quality."

"This is easily my favourite of all the offerings that Pike has to offer. Nothing exceptional, but it is a tasty, malty (but not overly so) beer that drinks very smoothly. I definitely would buy again and the price point isn't bad either. This is the first scotch style ruby ale I've tried and it's made me interested to try other offerings in this vein."
""
""
"O: A decent scotch ale, again nothing really special."
""
""

""

"Pours a nice bourbon caramel with a small fleeting white residue. Brilliant clarity. Smells of toast, english tea, some brown sugar and a wee bit of cinnamon. Flavor carries plenty of bread, some yeast and slight oxidation (cardboard), hints of tea. Medium bodied with light carb and a noninvasive finish. A decent, approachable beer. I can see myself grabbing this on a cool fall day."
""
""
""
"Pours dark red with a sub-one-finger head, slightly off white. Smells of heavy, buttery scotch and molasses. Flavor follows with a mix of fruits and butterscotch, with a super smooth finish. Not much peaty or smokey flavor here, but I was Ok with that. A little slick, juicy, with medium carbonation. Was hungover when I had this, but was a pretty easy drinking scotch ale. Pike really impressed me on my Seattle visit."

"Almost an orange appearance in sunlight. Lacing was weak. Sweet aroma and sweet on the palate but not over the top. Terrific mouth feel...I was reluctant to swallow. Pleasant carbonation and exemplary taste. For a Scotch style ale it exceeded my expectations."
"O - A tasty scotch ale, but a little too mild for my liking. I like my scotch ales to possess more on the peat flavours, so don't look to this one if you're looking for a bold scotch ale. This might be a good choice to ease someone into the style."
"Taste is really nice, more sweet than smokey like most but it's more approcable and easy drinking. Carbonation is light and the Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp making this very easy drinking."
"O - a very peppery and pleasant brew, not big on peat or smoke, but unique enough to stand out while being very drinkable"
"O - Quite enjoyable. When in the mood for this style I would certainly try again."
"Sad for Scotch lovers like myself. But a tasty red ale in the Sam Adams, or O'Hara style nonetheless."
"Overall a good beer but 1 would only be able to drink 1."
"overall, it's alright, but nothing special."
"More wood tannin grittiness and sweetness on the palate. Didn't catch the smokiness at this point. Warming effect of alcohol. More drinkable than average for style. A little nuttiness and caramel thrown in for good measure. More like a hybrid or leaning toward an amber ale/winter warmer type situation."
"Nice bronze color. Admirable head going into the glass. Sweet, caramel aroma-sticky, buttery and toffee like. Malt all the way upfront flavor wise. A whisper of hops. Mellow spiciness that is somewhat unexpected though fits well. Lingering caramel sweetness. Hint of real scotch character as it settles in the back of the throat. Very solid body-the stickyness and touch of spice comes thru bodywise. Very well done US wee hevy. Nice low abv, for the US. Stays traditional to it's roots. No smoke in your face which is nice."
"On tap at Pike brewery. Pours dark red hue with a white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of cherry and apple juice. Light to medium, crisp body. Good balance of caramel malt, ripe fruit and earthy hops fill the mouth. I don’t think this ale can lift a kilt."
"An ok brew. Some flaws but tasty."
"Drink- I had this about 4 years ago. I know why I didn't buy again. I'm glad FIL spent $ for bottle, for me to review."
"With not many other choices on the menu that were appealing to me, I ordered up this Scotch ale. Poured a clear amber color with a small white head that didn't stick around too long; not much lacing to speak of. Mostly caramel maltiness in the nose. Nutty caramel in the taste, some sugar and peat, and a mild fruit flavor. Not too strong, but pretty smooth and drinkable."
"I picked up a bottle of this one while on vacation in San Diego. Poured from the bottle a nice golden amber color with a nice khaki head. On the nose, I get some light smoke, sweet malt and caramel. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and nicely balanced between smoke and sweetness, with flavors of light peat smoke, biscuit and caramel."
"O: Kind of flavorful at least, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, while this is quite departed from your typical Scotch ale and not one I would jump at the chance to choose again, I don’t think this beer as horrible as some have made it seem. I’m finding it a bit unique if nothing else, yet if not of for the review, I don’t see myself drinking this beer again."
"D- Low. 1 bottle is all I needed. It doesn't taste bad it's just smokey."
"Pass if you have a better option."
"By my estimation it falls nicely between the boldest shilling ale and a slow-sipping heavy. You wouldn't miss the peat presence if it was removed. Big body. Not bad."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a caramel-red color with a thin, filmy head. The nose has aromas of caramel malt and nut, with very slight hoppy scents. The beer's flavor is a rich malt sweetness, which is well-balanced with subtle green, bitter hops. The body is round and smooth in mouth, with a slightly bitter finish that follows a scotchy-malt aftertaste. Dangerously easy to drink, and goes well with almost any kind of food since the flavors are not overpowering. One of my favorite offerings from Pike's."
"Note: O.G. 1.064 with 27 IBU's 'Scotch Style Ruby Ale' with no date code..."
"Opinion: Well...overall this is an OK beer to drink. It has a pretty nice balance of hops and malt, so it does a decent job as a Pale Ale or something. As far as it being a Scotch Ale, I wouldn't be expecting anything from Scotland except for the faint Peat. There is nothing wrong with the beer as far as fermentation flaws or anything...it just isn't a Scotch Ale."
"Feels a little watery and I wouldn't be really excited to drink another."
"Not an exceptionally interesting beer to be honest. I've had it before on locale in Seattle and remember it far more fondly."
"Orangy copper, some fine sediment, a light tan cap with little retention but decent spotty lacing. The aroma is pretty solid in its power, toated and caramel malts, almonds and slight fruit. Lots of toasted caramel taste, a bit almond, interesting sweetness, slight spicy burn. I enjoyed how this tasted but not enough to get any more. Medium bodied, light fizz in the mouth. Smoothness that seems syrupy but is not. Decent middle but it fades to quickly on the finish. Chewy and mild spice meet the bitterness in a lingering after taste."
"Golden brown color, crisp with a hint of ruby. Nutty, caramel smells, sweet. Taste of burnt caramel malt, fruits, and some bitterness. Appearance and smell were better than the taste, IMHO. Certainly not bad at all, but definitely not a top runner either. A great beer for the sidelines of a world sampling tour."
"It has a moderately thick body with low carbonation, but I still did not find it to be exceptionally drinkable, even at 6.5% abv."
"D: I finished it, it was not horrible, but there are so many better examples of the style. Skip this and try another."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed to 1.064 with pale, crystal, carapils, peated and Munich malt; hopped with magnum and goldings to 27 IBUs and fermented with English ale yeast. It pours almost ruby (more of an auburn), lightly-hazed, with medium carbonation and a thin cap. Rich and sweet in the nose from the Munich and crystal, blended with earthy, tea-like, nearly roasted notes. The flavor starts malty and rich, lightly sweet, followed by hops and an earthy fullness from the peat. Hints of raisiny crystals creep in here and there and are balanced by lightly spicy hops that contribute little bitterness. A flavorful yeast strain rounds it out and things end on a lightly peated note. While it begins crisp and dry, once the carbonation ebbs the body fills out nicely. Very nice brew here - a bit more hop flavor than most Scotch ales, but this is well-balanced and damn tasty. Definitely recommended."
"D - An easy drinking Scotch Ale that is neither awe inspiring or off putting in any way... Simple and straight forward... Goes done rather easily... A bargain for the price... No complaints... Would gladly drink again, but not something I would highly recommend..."
"All in all I like this beer, not your average Scotch Ale, but I guess they vary."
"Not my favorite style, but this brew was drinkable enough."
"Poured this from a 22oz. bottle into a icy Pint glass. Color was a copper amber with a little head that didn't last long. The nose was sweet and toasty. I found almost no bitterness. Very balanced and drinkable, not as heavy or rich as other Scotch Ales I have tried. Overall a good drinkable ale, but nothing exceptional. I will buy this beer again."
"I'm a big fan of Scotch Ales particularly at this time of year, but this effort is a serious disappointing brew. It lacks the boldness and the full bodied character that I think defines the style."
"Overall this is just an average beer. It's my first from Pike and I'm disappointed."
"It packs a punch but it isn't zippy or burny. Some people might be put off by this, but I'm not convinced that a strong alcohol presence is a necessary component of a Scotch."
"Drinkability: my palate grows weary of the onslaught of not-terribly-interesting malt flavors. For me, personally, this is not an exceptionally drinkable beer. It is serviceable, though."
"A decently drinkable, more or less solid scotch ale - 'wee heavy' may be a bit of a stretch here - certainly malty, aye, and a wee bit boozy, with some underrated hops to keep things honest. Something worth considering come the inevitably cooler weather, and that Scottish bard's celebration in January."
"D-it is actually a very easy to drink ale, i would have liked more hops and alcoholic bite but i think i would pick this up again. not a bad price either for what youre drinking."
"One finger very light tan head, medium-fast dissipation with minimal lacing. Clear amber body, a singular trail of carbonation. Nose is lightly roasted malt, pretty sweet, a bit of grassy hops. Taste mirrors nose, caramel sweet, slight bit of roast, just a hint of hops. Medium-light mouthfeel, not much effervescence. Not bad drinkability, close to style, but not sure I'd order one again."
"Pike Kilt Lifter has no distinguishing characteristic; nothing to excite the taste buds or palate; nothing to remember; and no reason to have more than once."
"Taste is lightly smokey up front with rich dried fruits, toasty grain/barley, light earthiness joining later. The toastiness, rich fruits, light earthiness and light smokey quality all carry through the finish and linger gently. It's slightly on the sweeter side. It is not very good with many foods, but alone or with Pike's macaroni & cheese made with it, it is simply wonderful."
"D- Overall, Kilt Lifter is a decent scotch ale that is solid in some areas (taste, drinkability) but lacking in other areas (aroma, appearance). Worth a try."
"Pours amber with a disappointing head. The aroma is sweet, a little peaty, with an unfortunate bite of elastic. The flavor is sweet, slight, and malty with a band-aid finish that is not appealing. The mouthfeel is prickly to an unpleasant degree."
"Not bad. Easy enough to drink."
"D) A nice Scottish ale. I'd drink another."
"Drinkability: Lacks richness and depth. It's drinkable. But is that what we really want from this style...something that goes down easy."
"Aroma is fairly strong and malty with a faint yeasty undertone and just a hint of miso. It pours a nice clear coppery amber with a fairly thick pale orange-tan head. Flavor is rather mouth-filling, malty with an undertone of hard apple cider and hints of caramel and hops. Fizzy texture leaves a decent tingle behind."
"I've enjoyed but not been particularly impressed by the other pike beers, hopefully this one is different. Pours a clear amber color with a nice tan head that retains well. The aroma has some candied fruit notes upfront, along with molasses, esters, a hint of smoke, toasted bread and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is a little more complex than the aroma, with a nice fruity character upfront (apple, plum, date) along with some caramel and molasses, toasted bread, smoke, and some herbal hops. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is excellent. A quite enjoyable scotch ale, with just the right amount of smokiness and restrained sweetness."
"The body was light, but full. Drinkability for this beer is very good, having a sixer for a cookout is a great idea. The brewery no longer calls this a Scotch Ale, they now call it a ""Ruby Ale", either way, it's a loyal beer friend. Worth trying when you see it."
"Overall, nothing too offensive but not far above average."
"Had their stout and really liked it. This, not quite as much. Still good enough though."
"Pike Brewing Company--Pike Kilt Lifter ruby ale--Scotch Style--2010-B 12 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 27 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Thin white thin lace head. Clear dark bright amber orange color. Delicate aromatic malt mild hop peat hint front. Dry toasted biscuit thin texture rich caramel mild fruit malty Scottish body. Dry clean crisp mild hop smooth tasty crusty hint end. Sampled 7/8/2010. 6-Pack $8.99. Purchased today. Fresh Bottle. Ages quickly."
"This beer is pretty straightforward, nothing too aggressive, perhaps on the more laid back side of this style, yet still tasty."
"Dr. Good, but not more than one or two."
"Nice brew with a good name. Looks good, smells good, tastes good. Has a range of flavors with each drink. Doesn't blow my socks off, but enjoyed it. Had a bomber from Total Wine ... would drink 2 back to back on a Friday. ;-) My taste buds need the equivalent of a 2x4 upside of 'em which is why I prefer IPA. That said, this brew has enough flavor and complexities in that flavor to keep me interested."
"Drinkability: decent beer but I have had better scotch ales"
"A decent interpretation of a scotch ale, I suppose. It could use a little more smokiness and a bit more complexity in the malt, but overall not too bad. This beer is probably better suited to the cooler months."
"Completely clear Scotch-brown in the glass. Not much head to speak of. Appearance is true to style. Not a bad beer. But not a very notable beer, either. I'm visiting the area, so I'm happy to try local brews. But I've definitely had better Sotch Ales. It's not as sweet or malty as I expected; and both hoppier and more dank than I wanted when I bought it."
"Drinkability: Lacking the satiating richness of others, it makes the shaky trade of character for ease of drinkability. It's nice enough, if a bit simplistic. Sort of a wee wee heavy, if you will."
"D: This was a decent beer (more like a scottish than scotch ale). It wasn't super clean or bold, and it certainly wasn't unique at all. But it was still enjoyable and easy to drink."
"D: A fairly disappointing Scotch Ale. The flavor is fine, but lacks depth, and this sports a rather one-dimensional aroma to boot. It's improved as it has warmed, but only to the point of decency."
"I don't mind this beer but at nearly 20$ for a 6er here in Alberta I doubt I'll be drinking much of this in the future"
"Overall, I really like this ale. It is a good summertime Scotch ale. Not too heavy, the malty sweetness, and rich flavors are present, but not too intense. It doesn't have quite the oatmeal heaviness that you might find in Oskar Blues Old Chub, for example. Different, but appealing. I'll be buying this again!"
"Drinkability is not bad. I certainly wouldn't turn this down, and wouldn't be upset to find it in another trade box."
"For a scotch ale this one is kind of light on what I look for in a scotch ale. It's very smooth an drinkable but just a bit shy for my tastes."
"D - High, smooth and drinkable. Some people will not like the fusil burn for sure. The smells took a long time to wake up but this was fine. I'd drink it again."
"Cloudy brown color body, small off-white head, quickly diminishing. Malty sweet aroma, syrupy. Earthy. English malty taste, biscuity. Sweet, but not syrupy. Scotchy taste, maybe butterscotch. Not bad, not too headache inducing."
"Overall, this is simply put, a solid and sessionable scotch ale that is packed with style accurate flavor. As common as it may be, it is solid. The color really throws one off going into it, but as soon as that signature scotch ale flavor makes its way in, there is no question what style is in the glass. This is definitely the best readily available scotch ale in a decent priced sixer that ive had. I was afraid that i only loved it becuase i drank it so much before my palate really matured and i would hate it now, (like their IPA) but this is a solid offering from pike. Nice scotch ale."
"Drinkability: The ABV and heaviness of this beer make it very hard to drink to much of."
"The taste is sweet and light with some of the fruitiness coming through as well. The malts are there, but not in enough quantity to be rich and creamy. That makes it probably a good thing the ABV is only 6.6, just not enough body and flavor to support any more alcohol. As a beer, it is far from bad and I do not think I will have much trouble finishing the bomber, but for a Scotch Ale, this is a pretty weak attempt."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is particularly low, this was not a very good representation of the Scotch Ale style, would have thought that this did not come from a craft brewery"
"Simple, single dimensional beer that's pleasant. Nothing special."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the clear dark amber brew. Head is quickly down to a swirly skim of tiny bubbles, with average to good lacing. Aroma is biscuity sweet malt. Taste starts where the nose left off, light fruitiness in the middle, and a slightly chalky hops close. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is easy. Could be better, but I wouldn't refuse on these."
"Overall the worst scotch ale I have ever had. I am really shocked to be honest as well. It was just all over the place and way too thin for the style. I was expecting average but did not even get that. Not sure whats going on but I would not go here again."
"D- Worth another try, but not something I'd seek out."
"Orangey, red with a small head that acted like it had somewhere else to be. This hurts the aroma as well. The smell and taste are like a hybrid between a pale ale and scottish ale. This is hardly a wee heavy. Too much hop bitterness, not a strong enough malt profile. Its a little lacking in my book."
"The mouthfeel is the strongest part of this beer but given the track record of this one that's not saying much. The residual sweetness from the taste lasts into the finish and actually is refreshing. It's medium bodied, slightly creamy and has a nice small carbonation that makes it drinkable. However the flavor is something I find boring and average which makes me not want to finish it, so I will have to pass this one by the next time I see it."
"Stronger malt than hop, but this could be described as a hoppy Scotch Ale. Good body, with a solid level of carbonation. Very short aftertaste. Not very complex."
"As far as Scotch Ales go...this one does not lift my kilt (or Nike gym shorts if you will, kilts aren't my thing). It's not bad or offensive, but on a strictly style based opinion...it doesn't impress."
"J"
"Medium-full body, moderate carbonation. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. Overall a rich, enjoyable Scotch Ale. For a Strong Scotch the ABV is actually on the low end, and the alcohol presence is actually so well hidden I don't get much warming. Only other detractor is the haze in the appearance, as a Strong Scotch/Wee Heavy should be clear. Honestly, I'm actually quite surprised at the number of reviews that call this clear. Drinkability is good, likely a bit heavy if your thinking of having more than one in a sitting."
"Sample at the brewpub. Pours a clear deep amber color with a medium thin and creamy beige head that recedes slowly. Stringy lacing on the glass. Aroma of smoked malt, hops and caramel. Medium body with flavors of roasted malt, caramel, and hops. Light smoke in the background as well. The finish is rich and sweet with a lingering caramel malt aftertaste. Above average all around."
"Thanks Mark!"
"D - Drinkability is good. The smokiness adds enough to this beer to keep it pretty interesting. Alcohol is covered very well. This is pretty easy to drink but would be more enjoyable with a little more punch in the mouthfeel department. I could have a couple of these over the course of an evening with no problems. Not a beer I would seek out though."
"D- The alcohol is well hidden in the creaminess of this beer. Lots of great flavors and a richness that doesn't come along too often make this an enjoyable beer. I recommend this one, but would be careful with having more than a couple...I think it would fill me up fairly quick!"
"via colts9016"
"I would place this beer more in the camp of Scottish Ale vs. Wee Heavy. AS an ale it is quite nice and very drinkable even with the high ABV."
"If you like peat malts - I mean if you really like peat malts - then this one's for you. Personally, I think they're a little overstated in Kilt Lifter. But that's just me. The beer is impeccably clear, dark auburn with a plump body and a crewcut head of suds. Peat malts fervently dominate the aroma as they do the taste. They emulate a smoked, marshy funkiness like lit punk sticks. Bittering is marginal by comparison but works nicely to offset an earthen sweetness. Sample first if you're not sure what your tolerance for peat malts is."
"D: Very drinkable and recommended. I'd grab it a few more times on tap and look forward to picking up some in bottles as well."
"D-Goes down easy, but at 6.5% you get some bang for your buck"
"Overall: The mouth feel is slight carbonate with a dryness. The finish has a hint of bitterness. The beer is overall just okay. There wasn't anything that stood out to make this beer pop."
"D: The light, carbonated nature of this beer makes it very drinkable, although I think it lacks a bit of complexity. Aside from the less than stellar flavor, it's pretty smooth and drinkable. Coming in at 6.60% ABV, it makes for a nice winter warmer. Fairly drinkable, but there are tastier Scotch ales out there."
"12 ounce bottle drank tonight, came as an extra in a trade with SuzyGreenberg, thanks Ben for the opportunity, this bottle says 6.5% ABV so it might vary by batch, poured into my Arrogant Bastard pint glass, color is on the darker spectrum of an amber, 1/8 inch bubbly off white head, practically not there, no lacing or retention, smell has a big malt presence, peat, caramel, floral hoppiness, smokiness, and maple syrup, taste was much the same with an enjoyable dry finish, definitely on the lighter side for a wee heavy, also some esters and a fruity earthiness later on once this warms up, mouthfeel is dry, chewy, and sweet, medium bodied, thinner for this style, above average level of carbonation, could drink a few bottles of this for sure, light on the stomach, easy drinking scotch ale, barely can detect a drop of alcohol, nice introduction from this brewery, interesting presentation of this style with a much lower ABV than usual, would drink again, recommended"
"taste oily, flat, has a sweet start then ends bitter, malt, some roasted nuts, some butterscotch, becomes more bitter as it warms."
"Glad I was able to sample this one - bottle muled back by my son working in Seattle - atta go!"
"Not a bad scotch-style ale. Smooth and drinkable with a good balance. The flavors near the verge of sweetness, but quickly veer back to the malty and woody notes, creating a drinkable yet fairly interesting brew. Nothing outstanding, and it could use a bit more depth, but I'd drink it again, if given the opportunity."
"Not bad, but does not measure up to my favorites of the style. I probably wont be getting this again though. There are other top notch Wee Heavies around that blow this one out of the water."
"Fairly average."
"D: Drinks like a champ. Goes down easy, and goes well with cheese. A little rich/sweet though. I don't think I could down a lot, but a pint is no problem."
"I was hoping for a bit more malty richness/depth. Not quite what I think of as a wee heavy, but there's enough characteristics to give it a try."
"Overall it's not too bad, but seems to be lacking some depth of flavor for me. Pretty drinkable though, as it is milder than some other Scotch Ales."
"D: It's a light beer which makes it pretty drinkable. The lack of flavor would not make me reach for another though."
"Thanks to julian for the opportunity. Pours a nice copper/caramel with a standard head that is quick to disappear. Little carbonation. Smells of slightly nutty, toffee, caramel malts. Taste of soft caramel malts mingling well with a very subtle hop profile. Mouth feel is silky. A nutty, toffeeness comes into play in the aftertase. Well balanced and very tastey."
"Overall I thought it was a well balanced and light ale. I could drink a sixer on a hot day."
"After a good couple of sips the spiced kick mellow but its still present. Could be considered a bit harsh but not. A good drinker I could sip upon."
"I like this beer and I think it is well done. I think the apple sweetness may bother some, but I like it. I think it mixes well with the malts and provides for a sessionable beer."
"Drinkability is not where I expected it. Not a bad scotch ale, but i've had better."
"D_not quite malty enough for me personally. This is a mildly scottish malt style pale ale to me. Sort of a scots for begginners"
"Nice dark amber color with red and gold hues peeking through in the light. No head, no real cap and not much lacing to speak of, maybe just a hint of tan and white floating in there. The smell is a sweet caramel-like scent. Not too complex. Some smokey tones linger there too. The taste was very much on the sweet side, but had a nice little spicey, smokey bite to it. Again though, not too complex. Light to medium bodied with a mildly carbonated mouthfeel. Goes good with the food at the pub, but I wouldn't necessarily be looking for this one otherwise."
"I am torn over this one; I've never been impressed with this one, though Pike Kilt Lifter is my brothers ""desert island beer"". I've had it dozens and dozens of times over the years and have been underwhelmed for the most part.. tonight, though... it seems to be a better brew. Kilty still needs more over everything to really raise the bar."
"Drinkability: Nice character. Had many scotch ale qualities, but made its own statement without going over the top."
"Many thanks to Bill for generously sharing this uncommon Scotch Ale."
"D: Nice easy brew but after a couple I needed something without the sweet fuzzy fullness to clean my palate and move me deeper into the party."
"D- strong aromas, tasty brew, and great mouth feel, give this brew a whirl if you are into scotch ales"
"Overall Impression: A gentle lift of the kilt! I expected stronger flavors but this was dangerously drinkable."
"D: Quasi-drinkable, only because of the smokiness. Rein in the smokiness vs maltiness, and you've got yourself a Scottish ale worthy of a session."
"Overall, a very balance, although not terribly complex, brew."
"Whatever flavor there was tasted watered down. Some grainy sweetness, some bitter in back, dry finish. Just thin and lacking in character. I expected more body from a ""Scotch Style"" as well, but this offering from the Seattle brewpub just didn't have the stones to earn the title. I lifted the kilt and didn't find anything there!"
"On tap at Lynx Pizza just outside Denali national park. The color is a reddish copper with minimal head and a bit of delicate lace. Do they use lace on kilts? The smell is rose hips and smoky malt. Now we're getting more Scottish. The taste has a nice hops bite followed by a sharp malt. Very dry finish. Not at all sweet, which surprises me a bit. The mouthfeel is nice but with minimal carbonation, although that could be the tap. There is some silkiness there to keep it all together. The drinkability is limited by the bone-dry finish but the malt balances that out as best it can before it is overrun. Not my favorite style but an interesting example of it. The alcohol is well hidden."
"The was on the lighter side for a wee heavy, although at times it seemed like more beer then it was. Went down easy enough, but not really noteworthy. While not an average example of the style, it was average across the board score wise."
"Pours a brilliant copper which is extraordinarily effervescent, a large head forming and big bubbles continuing to surface for several minutes. The head is retained pretty well, and leaves some lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, but lacks the smokiness and peat that I'd expect in such an ale. Caramel is obvious, and a bit of alcohol. Taste follows the expected pattern, with a notable astringency in the finish. Nutty flavours come through as well, with lots of sweetness and just a hint of the peaty smoke one would expect. Mouthfeel has good body, with lots of carbonation at the beginning which subsides after a few minutes. Drinkability is quite good. Not bad at all, but I've had much better."
"D: Despite any negative implications above, I could drink this all night. I've often noticed an inverse correlation between the first four characteristics and this last one; this beer is no different."
"Despite the abv, this seems more like a session beer than the Kiltlifter I am accustomed to. While it goes down easier, I personally think it is less distinctive than it was before. I wouldnt mild drinking more of this but dont feel drawn to by any means. Id call this re-tooling/restoration a success only with some definite qualifiers."
"Body and other notes: Medium to medium/light body, with a dry finish. The label clearly says "" Scotch Style PIKE KILTLIFTER ruby ale", And the addition of ""ruby"" completes a very good description, I just somehow expected it to taste more Scottish than (stereotypically) Irish. It is right down the middle in my estimation, still a great beer."
"From a 12 oz bottle. This was also called ""ruby ale"" on the bottle. It poured a light amber, very clear, with a small white head adn light lacing. Nose is mostly of malts and hops;. Medium mouthfeel and flavor is somewhat sweet. There is a little fruit and bit of herbal taste. Mild finish."
" I will buy this beer again. Pike again has put out another Great well balanced beer. If you like this ale you will love their Ruby Scotish Ale!!"
"D: I'll try another one just to confirm or dispel my initial conclusions, but what I found here was not enjoyable in any form."
"Overall, a fine effort and well deserving of the 84 score (when I wrote this review)."
"Nice dark amber color with red and gold hues peeking through in the light. No head, no real cap and not much lacing to speak of, maybe just a hint of tan and white floating in there. The smell is a sweet caramel-like scent. Not too complex. Some smokey tones linger there too. The taste was very much on the sweet side, but had a nice little spicey, smokey bite to it. Again though, not too complex. Light to medium bodied with a mildly carbonated mouthfeel. Goes good with the food at the pub, but I wouldn't necessarily be looking for this one otherwise."
"Not impressive, possibly my least favorite scotch ale to date."
"D: Good enough to drink again. Yes. Worth seeking out. Maybe. Not the pick of the litter but not a bad beer at all...worth a try."
"This was my wife's favorite of The Pike, but I thought it was a bit light for being a Scotch ale. The dark golden color with a white head was nice in the glass, but the mouthfeel didn't match up, watery and light for style. Sharp bite in the taste over a solid malt, almost but not quite astringent with a very light hint of smokiness. Musty in the nose with a light malt, and little hop anywhere. Too be expected, a little off center from style, but a very good beer. And, this was one of only two pints my wife ordered in three bars, so a pretty recom there."
"This beer pours a straight copper color with a creamy off-white head exhibiting light retention and moderate lacing. The smell is malty and slightly earthy. The taste is focused on the malts, but there is a balanced hop presence. It tastes to me equally split between malt and hops, but the malt dominates the first several seconds of a taste and the hops fill in afterward. No significant fruit esters in this beer. One of the defining characteristics of the style, a drying finish despite a malty sweetness in taste, is spot on in this beer. The overall mouthfeel is drying due to the finish. This is a very drinkable Scottish heavy, but the higher abv, somewhat deceptively high, keeps it out of the session category."
"A gift from Seattle"
"but that 6.6% abv isn't noticeable in the taste. flavorful, malty, very smooth mouthfeel and dangerously drinkable. it's not nearly as big or complex as fat bastard, the wee heavy i am most familiar with. but when i was thinking it was a scottish ale i was happy with it, and i'm not going to change my score. i like both styles, can't really tell much of a difference anyway. i liked it, and it's available at just about every store around the seattle area, so i recommend it and will definitely get it again."
"Drinkability: not too bad, but this needs to be kicked up a few notches on the malt and peat levels. Decent beer."
"At times, this comes off as thin and under carbonated. Its enjoyable to drink, but somehow seems a little slick at times."
"Pour is reddish orange. Head appears for a moment and then vanishes entirely. Nose reminds me of hops dipped in caramel. Taste is hoppy, brown sugary, and caramel-y. This one isn't completely doing it for me, I'll be honest. Mouth is quite nice though. Very thick ... carbonation is like a blanket. Drinkability is ok because the taste isn't bad or tastebud wrecking after only a couple sips. It would work to try a sixer of this."
"Pours an orange-amber color topped by just a touch of creamy white head. Aroma of rich caramel malt, some light peaty smoke, light fruity hops, and a hint of diacetyl. Palate is well-balanced between sweet caramel and fruity hops, with notes of dark fruit and peat smoke. Medium body is just a bit light for this style, and lacks the syrupy feel that is characteristic of some of the heavier-hitting scotch ales. Nonetheless, it's a fairly tasty and easy-drinking take on the style."
"D - Drinkable. This brew surprised me, I thought that I would not like it, but it's really not that bad. Would buy again."
"I really need to seek out more brews in this style as this one is night and day different to the only other scotch ale I've had to compare it to."
"It has a fruity, tangy flavour with a malt profile which manages to mix caramel and carrot. This is well balanced with enough hops to give it a little bite. As the beer warms the fairly high alcohol content becomes apparent. I like this beer but it isn't easy to knock back and an imperial pint was more than enough."
"I enjoyed this beer. It is light, tasty and very drinkable. Id love to stop by the Pike Pub & Brewery and try one on tap some time."
" I found it to be a decent beer but not one I would seek out. I also don't think it's a very good representation of the style. The faint smokiness probably means it would pair well with with a good stadium dog or a hearty chowder, but by itself this really just drinks like a malty amber ale."
"The head is tiny, off-white, bubbly, greasy. Beer is hazy copper-orange, maybe tending somewhat toward brown. There's sweet toffee/caramel/brown sugar in the nose. Some pipe smoke. Dark tobacco toffee in front; tangy, fruity caramel in the middle; sour fruit and smoky caramel in the end. Interesting. Sour fruit and dark, burned caramel. Not bad. Kind of ""homebrewy""."
"Overall impression: Dangerously drinkable. High ABV and great drinkability could be a very dangerous combination in this one. Wish I could get it regularly here in Colorado."
"The peated malt is apparant, and there is some residual sweetness, but overall, it was too bitter for this style. The flavours were just a little harsh for my tastebuds."
"Good stuff."
"It sits well in the mouth, asking for another hit or, even better, a visit to Pike's itself. Well done."
"Kilt Lifter (a fairly common name it seems) is not good beer. It misses the style mark by a fairly wide margin, yet isn't so bad that it's completely without merit. It really isn't worth a purchase though and I'm glad that I only bought one bottle. Pass this one by."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild crystal malt scent with a bit of peated malt aroma. The taste is good, although I'm not sure it really nails the style too well. It has a nice and light malty core with a smokey feel and a rather bitter hop aftertaste . It goes down smooth and has a grainy bisquit malt and hop finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine brew. It is certainly unique and quite flavorful; a good drinker."
"Highly dissapointed in this one...thin...fizzy...lacks peat...lacks maltiness...has almost a fruity sourness...very unremarkable drinking experience. I would never buy this one again...perhaps it's old but we got it from Liquid Solutions and I assume they only ship fresh beer..even if it is old a 6.6% Scotch should hold up better...tangy tasting...just not at all what I expected....light orange color....nose almost smells like a barnyard...tart on the finish...not very good at all"
"This beer pours an amber color with a small head that goes away fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. kmpitz2 described the aroma as tomato and spices and I totallly agree. The flavor was much the same. I didn't even detect any peated malt. Something really strange about this brew, not in a good way. I had to pour this one out."
"This beer pours a golden amber color with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is really strange. The first thing that comes to mind is tomato, some leather and spiceyness. I hope the flavor is different. What I get in the flavor is odd. I get the peated flavor, but it tastes a bit like leather. There is a bit of bite in the finish, but overall I don't like the beer all that much. Not what I want from a Scotch. The feel is rather thin, and drinkability suffers from the odd notes I get in the flavor and nose. I would not recommend this beer."
"I had the pleasure to drink this beer back in the days when there was a LOT of peated barley presence (and it was still called ""Maul Hammer."") It still has some decent mouthfeel, and when it warms up, you get just the slightest reminder of that smoky peat. It has always been a smooth drinker, to the point of being quite dangerous in its 6.5% abv past, but I think it's been dumbed down to the point of near-fogettability. Still, it's better than most US attempts at a Scottish style."
"Pours a copper orange with a white cream head that fades rather quickly. The smell is of roasted malts and grilled fruit, alcohol lingers. The taste is very light for this style, roasted malts and fruit blend well with the alcohol tones, hopyp dryness bring up the rear. A drinkable Scotch Ale but lighter than most, I like Scotch Ales with a cigar but this one just doesn't quite make it to the cigar room."
"Copper infused rust color, a bit of chill haze to it, large and thickly fluffed beige head sits well for a while before descending to a thin collar and the lacing sticks in strings and spots. Aroma is super yummy malt goodness, thick and dark caramel, super nice peat moss thats not overly smokey, but favorlaby earthy and has a terrific sweetness to it overall. Taste follows suit with a brigade of dark caramel and toffee sweetness with super nice earth tones and breadiness to make it rich and thick. Again the peat is there but not overwhelmingly smokey, it adds just enough to it to really go ""Wow"". Hops play underneath more towards the finish with a slight spice and bite helping the end of warmth and add to some of the slight dryness. Great feel, nearly full, very well rounded, and toothsweet smoothness and the low carbonation makes this a creamy thick treat to drink. The first thing that came to mind, and only after a few sips, is that its a whole hell of alot like a good barleywine. But without all the baggage of the higher ABV. A real plus and incentive to get alot more of this in the future, as it is quite a malty, yummy treat. One I would keep in my fridge alot if I could get it. Yummy! Did I already say that?"
"Pours a nice copper/orange with a thin head that is gone pretty quickly,aroma is soft and fruity with a light alcohol note that lingers.Taste is fruity in the start with an alcoholic warming aspect to it,I noticed a hoppy dryness in the finish.Seems a bit thin for the style but flavorful I would try it again though."
"Notes: It has alot going for it but one thing that really is out of whack is the ultra thin mouthfeel. Still fairly drinkable, but it comes up short of a great beer."
"Pike Kilt Lifter Scotch Style Ale was served from a 22 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a clear orange caramel brown color, and was topped by a negligable head. that left weak lacing. The nose was quite malty, with a nice orange citrus presence and just a slight hint of peat smoke. I would have liked the peat to be more pronounced. I was pleasantly suprised by the taste though. A sweet flash is very quickly eclipsed by a powerful orange zippy bitterness, which lasts though to the drier, very estery earthy bitter finish...very nice and lively.. The body felt appropriately full for the flavors and style, but the carbonation was a bit lacking, which was apparant from the lack of a significant head. Overall, a very tasty effort that drinks well."
"Drinkability  I dont know if Ill be lifting my kilt after one of these, but it sure was tasty."
"Dark copper body with a light tan head. Smells of sweet, almost winey malts. Slight medicinal character and some hops too. Taste starts with the winey sweetish malts, bread pudding, and then a smokey-peat bog flavor. Finish is more bitter than other Scotch ales I've had, with lingering sweetness. Medium to big body, with a little syrupy feel. A little sweet to drink much."
"Reddish brown color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Slightly hopped, very malty. Scotch like maltyness. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty with nice smoky undertones."
"Clear, caramel-orange in color forming a beige head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is heavy with caramelized sugar, honey, vanilla, and a complete absence of hops. Taste begins with sweet caramelized sugar and malt, nuts, and a cookie-like sweetness. Peat comes in just at the end very end with a faint earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body and a lightly dry finish. An enjoyable example of the style, and also more representative than most of the over-hopped, under-malted offerings by other breweries. Solid."
"It pours a deep mahogany with a nice, uneven head. Carbonation tops it in very sporadic patterns, like the yeast was still active. The smell is sweet and malty with a slight smoked tinge. The taste in this batch is a bit sweet, but normally its a wonderful full and chocolate body. If you're not careful, you can drink a whole sixer, and it really affects your skiing."
"A beauteous orange to amber color, the head prodigious in size, creamy in texture, a nice light tan in color and the residual lace a thick and sticky sheet to meld with the glass. Sweet malt is the nose, fresh and inviting, the start ambrosial, malt laden, and the top rich in its feel to the palate. Finish has a delectable acidity, the hops spicy and pleasant, dry aftertaste and a real treat."
"Real nice beer. I don't know if it can be called a ""wee heavy", didn't seem thick enough, but the flavor was wonderful. Tad on the hpbby-bitterness side, but I am not saying that is bad at all. The color was a nice suprise, I kept holding it up to the light. I look forward to trying it there again sometime. I have to leave the family home though, they wouldn't let my daughter in the place, not even to sit on the couch. Kinda anal about that."
"Overall i could drink a few of these in a session..might just do that if i ever see it on tap up here!"
"Notes: Smaller in stature than most Scotch Ales I have had, a decent strong amber that was easy on the palate with a balanced malt and hop."
"Pours a red/gold color with a medium off-white dissipating head. The smell was breadlike with a slight smokey hint. This beer had a toasted bread and slight peat like flavor with peppery alcohol and somewhat piney finish. It also had a pretty firm mouthfeel. A good and tasty scottish ale."

"When you see Pike Place in the store, this Pike Kilt Lifter is the one I'd recommend from this classic Seattle brewery."
"Many thanks to jreitman for this one."
"(from notes at brewery) Nice amber color with a good nose to boot.  Nicely fruity and malty sweet with a pretty well hidden alcohol profile.  Was very smooth drinking and light on mouthfeel.  Surprisingly, there were quite a bit of floral hop flabors in there, but it did not detract too much from the style and was a nice variant."
"Daniel's point on the hops is well taken. But I dissagree with him on the body being too light. Kiltlifter does have a lighter body but not every Scotch ale is a Wee-heavy. I think if you were to put this beer in a 60 shilling (or light) catagory then the body fit just fine. The malt profile is supurb and could not be better. I did take off a point for too much hop for the style but in their defense it is brewed in the middle of hop country so extra hops are hard to resist."
"A little to light for a scotch ale, both in terms of taste and color.  Instead of a chewy brew you get a medium-bodied ale that is a touch too bitter.  Since most scotch ales are naturally sweet (though not overwhelmingly so), I was slightly disappointed with this one."
