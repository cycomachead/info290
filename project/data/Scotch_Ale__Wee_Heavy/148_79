The lacing that is left is slightly splotchy and carbonation bubbles can be seen bursting through the surface...  The color is a warm inviting caramel brown...  Some carbonation bubbles cling to the glass, the remainder powers through at a rapid pace...  The nose is rather subdued, but all the usual suspects are present...  Caramel...  Toffee...  Peat...  Toasted malts...  Light brown sugar...  On the palate, the peat is dialed up in intensity and much of the expected malty goodness is buried deep in the background...  There is a very subtle booziness which lingers on the finish...  There is a greater than expected hop bite even though it is still relatively minor...  Medium bodied...  Sturdy...  Limited carbonation...  A bit chalky throughout..  Some syrupy characteristics as well...  Overall, this one is a rather pedestrian Scotch Ale...  As a lover of the style I can't help but be a bit let down by this offering which has proved somewhat elusive for me...","philbe311","Dec 08, 2014"

4.25,4.9,,,,,,"The clear bottle had me a bit nervous, so I took one from the way-back of the shelf. Poured a deep brown with some coppery red hints. Tall, dissipating head of khaki. The aroma was certainly of butterscotch and caramel, not much in the way of hops to describe. The flavor was a direct hit from the aroma, really what you smelled was what you tasted. Really smooth butterscotch and caramel maltiness, balanced by a good bubbly carbonation and hops so subtle I can't describe a profile - but enough to cut the sweetness and make it a very enjoyable brew. No real alcohol on the finish, even at the early cold sips.Solid offering, will definitely put this in the stable for when in the mood for malty brews.","MisterGone","Nov 24, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, brown bread, brown sugar, herbal, light smoke, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, biscuit, brown sugar, brown bread, herbal, light smoke, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, herbal, light smoke, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Low-medium carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome scotch ale. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt and fruity/earthy yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 05, 2014"

One can smell the strength of the malt a slight alcohol smell. Taste of sweet smooth buttery and malty with a hint of sweetness towards the end of the sip.

Also present is a touch of what strikes me as EKG hops. Heavy medium bodied with a rich creamy mouthfeel against a slightly below normal carbonation level. The flavor profile is well balanced and complex. It begins with a dark malt sweetness that hints of raisins and plums, progresses to molasses and ends with a biscuit sweetness that floods the palate. The finish is very smooth and ends with a residual sweetness against a slight hop and alcohol tingle with just a hint of smoke. This is the standard against which other Scottish ales much be judged, and it is outstanding.","tillmac62","Feb 04, 2014"

A shame; I was looking forward to it. As it is, a fair brew, though I strongly suspect a fresher bottle would result in a much higher rating.

Extremely tasty, as a Wee Heavy fan this is a really good one, tasty without to much bitter follow up. The only ding I can give it is that it is only 6.5% which seems a little low for a Wee Heavy.

Beautiful mahogany pour with two finger off-white head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose has an initial subtle skunkiness that dies off quickly and yields to a wonderful toasty and malty aroma with hints of caramel, dark fruit, and maple syrup. The taste follows suit with earthy and nutty, yet slightly sweet hints of toffee, caramel, brown sugar, maple, and just a wee bit of peat, pardon the pun. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy but extremely smooth. And everything about this beer improves as it warms. Haven't had much exposure to the style, but this is one damn fine beer!","beerdrifter","Mar 27, 2012"
3.78,-6.7,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Overall, the best thing about this brew was how flavorful it was. After the nose, which was relatively mild and adjuncty, the flavoring came forward with boldness. The first sips are sweet, intensely drying, and malty. With time, however, what develops is a deeply complex flavoring, which ultimately encompasses the spirit of the style expertly. Everything else seems to fall into place, and this beer keeps you wanting more with every sip.","TheBrewo","Mar 12, 2012"

This stuff pours a deep sunset tawn topped by a short-ish finger of dark cream foam. The nose comprises toffee, caramel, light walnut, dank cocoa, and a touch of maple syrup. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit of cola-esque sweetness thrown in for good measure. Still, things keep their Scottish identities (if you catch my drift), particularly with a light, vague woodiness pervading the background. The body is a lithe medium, with a nice nitrogenation and a subsequently silky feel. Overall, a very solid wee heavy, one I wouldn't mind having several of at some random pub on the outskirts of Edinburgh (or any other Scottish town, really).","TMoney2591","Nov 24, 2011"

The brew tastes like caramel and toasted malt, toffee, and some butterscotch and peat. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and it's well carbonated, a little too carbonated for my liking. I think it's an OK brew, but for the style there are plenty of other beers I'd choose before this one. I've liked the Belhaven brews I've tried in the past, but I'm not a fan of this one.

Clean and translucent though. Molasses, smoked meat and red grapes mixed into a heavy smelling malted monster. A little on the light side as far as strength of the aromas. But in all, pleasant and a rather good display of the maple-smoked flavours within. Heavy smoked meat flavours. Maple sugars and strong smoked malts. Bitter molasses and coffee-like hops. Has a strong, almost rauchbier body. Finish is oily and sweet. Well carbonated smoked body, heavy with sugars and light with carbonation. Plenty of molastic texture. Tends to become dry and sweet. In all, this scottish ale has a smokey, molasses, and maple sugar presence. So strong (wee heavy) it actually is hard to handle for too long.

It comes in a clear bottle and I did notice some skunky scent, but luckily the skunkiness was not present in the flavor (thank goodness). For lovers of authentic British Isle beers, this is a fine example of what to expect stopping for a brew in a small countryside pub on the Moors (at least what I recall from my UK visit last year).

Nose is somewhat muted - some malt, grapes and currants and something of a skunky quality. Taste follows nose - malty quality comes out a bit earthy in the flavor profile. Grapes and currants carry over, but not expressed as sweet; there is also a slightly herbal/medicinal quality in the mix.

The head diminishes some but remains pretty durable throughout. Caramel malts, sweetness, and modest hops flutter across the aroma's spectrum with a pleasing and enticing balance. The taste begins with an unobtrusive bitterness reminding me at the end that there is an undertone of sweet malts and subtle hops still beckoning the palate.

4.3,6.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Cream brown colored head, good finger's thickness, mainly small bubble foam, lacing glides off the glass. The nose is a pleasant medley of caramel/toffee, peat moss, fallen forest wood, raisins, figs and cherries, white bread dough, nuts and flower water, quite smooth and without a trace of any rough or bitter qualities. Medium-bodied with a fluffy, soft texture which expands in the mouth, offering more square inch coverage than weight. The carbonation is steady and full, few pinpricks, contributes to the expansive feel. The raisin, date, fig, cherry, apricot, apple fruit a fine mix of dried and fresh fruit characters, pairs well with the chocolate, caramel, nutmeg flavors. The breadiness not a major player, if there more cake than out-and-out bread. Corn and flowers appear more as it warms some. Never too sweet nor dense, the final sip as fresh as the first.","farrago","May 29, 2009"

Flavour was very mild with, again, dampened sweet malty flavours and that lovely, modest, earthy hop bitterness one finds in so many ales from the U.K. I enjoyed this one, but honestly, I could find nothing *really* special about it, save for it's modesty made for a highly drinkable Wee Heavy.","SilentSabre","Mar 25, 2009"

3.93,-3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Very nice Scotch Ale with excellent balance. This beer has a complex malt flavor and minerally hop bitterness. The liquid is a dark mahogany topped by a big, sticky, foamy head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma is a bit on the mineral hop side, but I guess it could be the water. The malt is toasty, deep caramel with some thick doughy flavors. The hops are stronger than expected, and the beer is probably considered quite balanced. I almost wish that I could age it a bit to tone down the hop flavors, but that's just me. There are some slight medicinal notes lurking in the background. The feel is rich and creamy. It's a sweet beer that avoids being sticky. The beer gets better and better as the temperature increases.","popery","Dec 18, 2008"

Time will tell, but in either event, Wee Heavy from Bellhaven gets my stamp of approval. I will defintely seek out other Wee Heavys to try based on my time with this brew.

Roasted malts pique the nose first, but there is a springy hop mixture with some figs and dark fruit (cherries) also in the smell (my nose was all over the place). Not only did I taste roasted malts but it seemed like there were coffee malts in this brew too. Definitely some caramel to round out the body and give it a little sweetness (tagged with some fruit, I swear). Not really smooth but just slightly smooth as there is a hop kick towards the end that gives this full-bodied beer a semi-dry finish after passing over the tongue easily. A spot-on wee heavy, and despite the higher than should be ABV I would session this, although it seems to better as a dessert beer (which is how I drank it last night).","clayrock81","Mar 16, 2008"

Could be smoked slightly, but that sweet malt aroma comes through. The taste does not disappoint. There is that sweetness of the malt and thickness likened to pumpernickel bread.

So much so that I and another friend could not really nail down a description. Possibly a little nutty. I'm really hung up with this one. I really did not care for ot very much at first but by the end of the glass I was not so sure. I think YOU should try it for yourself, I do not think I will though.

Once this beer warms up a little the taste isn't far from being good. I couldn't quite give it a 4 because like the smell, it seemed a little light and watery. The closer it got to room temperature, the more the flavors intensified and showed their true colors. Mouthfeel was up to par, very clean and smooth. The best part about this beer, although it's not something that I'll seek out in the future, is the drinkability. Very easy going down and very easy to take on more than one bottle in a sitting.

If you lean towards malt rather than hops then you will probably enjoy this Scotch Ale. It's not my preferred type but for the style I believe this is a nice one. I would definitely drink this again. Goes great with curry and other spicy dishes.","shamus","Jan 07, 2007"

Dark fruit and scortched brown sugar mingle in the flavor, backed by some mild leafy/grassy hops, and thinned by a light touch of alcohol.

Overly sweet aroma and taste - not a bad thing in the nose, but too much for my palate, at least. For me, the malt was really overwhelmed by that sweetness. I had a hard time finishing it. The girlfriend (who enjoys darker beers) mentioned an unplesant aftertaste. I was pretty surprised to log on and see how well it's rated. My opinion, here, so don't put too much stock in it, but if you don't have much of a sweet tooth, I'd steer away from this one. If you do, maybe you'll love it as much as most reviewers seem to have.

Wonderfully crafted beer with lots of malty flavor and some dried fruit tones with little hop presence but a very smooth and lasting finish. Nice body bordering thick and a very drinkable beer.

It is sweet, but never becomes cloying, something I find offensive in many lesser Scotch ales. It finishes with a nice alcoholic kick that warms you as it goes down. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, buoyed by a mild amount of carbonation. Drinkability remains good because the sweetness is always kept in check by the bready, biscuity element. This is great Scotch ale that remains one of the pinnacles of the style.

4.05,0,4,4,4,4.5,4,"A pretty good brew. I expect more out of a Scottish Ale. The off-from-clear rust colored pour gives me hope. The aromas of dark fruit, caramel, bread, and yeast jump out at me. Taste the obvious caramels, barley malt, and maple syrup; provides a very sweet base that is never rounded out with English hops. Other flavors of over-ripened fruit: prunes, figs, raisons, dates, nuts, and cherries swirl around in my mouth. Body is full and round. Alcohol (rum-like) is revealed in the finish and aftertaste. The aftertaste is also sweet and cloying; no spices or hops to balance out. Slight smokiness helps, but not enough. Sticks to your teeth a little. A quality beer, but the flavors don't meld together or balance out properly. Has a lot of flavors, but not a lot of complexity.","BEERchitect","Aug 18, 2005"

Sure it's sweet with malt, but the alcohol cuts the sweetness, and a little hops help to funnel this malty god down with their bittering influence. I'm left with a palate hung with dried grapes, shall I say fresh raisins. I like the spirited maltiness. It's nicely (lightly)carbonated for the style, a wee heavy afterwards--as it should be. There's a smokiness, like a dessert cigar. Earthy beer. Good for a pub session with your friends.

The taste was similar as sweet dark fruits came first before a more subtle chocolate toffee malt flavor that lingered a bit in the aftertaste. There was a slight bit of hop detected but not much, there was enough their to keep the sweetness balanced nicely. Rich creamy mouthfeel with a medium-full body added greatly to the overall experience. Very drinkable stuff here as the alcohol was not detectable or too high to keep a few of these from going down.

The smell is sweet and pleasant. Lots of caramel, toffee, and spice to the aroma. The taste is very malty, with molasses and caramel coming through. There is just a tiny bit of hops at the end. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, a lot smoother than I thought it would be. At 6.5%, the drinkability is fairly good. Very nice for my first Scotch Ale.","SheepNutz","Aug 07, 2003"

Seems to be ideally balanced for the style, with enough complexity to keep it interesting. As nice of a malt profile as I've tasted. reminds me in a way of a good doppelbock (like Salvator or Moretti). Fans of either of those beers (or McEwans) should try this one.","JohnnyDuvel","Apr 28, 2003"

The flavor is again toasty and nutty, almost a smoky flavor to it. There is also a bit of fruitiness in the flavor. It is medium-full in body with an oily texture; it finishes dry. This is a very good brew I will definitely sample again. This was actually my second time with this beer. The first was at the MN BA gathering. It was my last beer in the daylong session that ended at feloniousmonks Blue Nile.","BeerBuilder","Apr 25, 2003"

Head was a nice light brown color with some nice laciness. Raisins, plums, and other dark fruits were really noticeable in the front of the mouth. Alcohol zestiness came across on the back of the tongue in the finish. Earthy graininess comes out as it warms. Medium bodied and well carbonated with a slight oily sensation in the finish.

Simple but very effective, it felt rustic, especially the nose. A very attractive beer for the style, and a perfect example of an underappreciated style. But, its so potent in scent and flavor that it needs to be drunk only one or two at a time. Great in a Duvel glass!","nomad","Apr 18, 2003"

The head was a a fairly dark tan which lasted a long time and clung to the glass leaving a nice lace. The aroma is very subtle primarily malt. The taste is of malt and whatever hops is there to offset the malty sweetness. It finishes a caramel, chocolate. It is creamy and has a medium mouthfeel. It is a very nice beer that I always look forward to drinking. I would recommend it highly for someone trying to learn the style.","LarryKemp","Mar 23, 2003"

It had a very nice dark color with a nice thick head that lasted a little while. The taste was a nice bold taste, with some roasted maltiness to it. It had a semi-sweet after taste, but not too sweet. It coated my mouth and had a little bit of a dry finish. It also had a bit of a bitterness tinge to it.

Lacing was most prominent from mid glass on down. I will for sure buy this again, I enjoyed it's eminent drinkabilty, some of our domestic micros make darn good ales in this style but they are usually packing about 8% abv.

Taste is delightfully sweet, as it should be for the style. Big malt backbone with sweet bread, caramel and toffee flavors. Didn't detect any smokiness or peat flavors (typically found in a Scotch Ale anyway). IMHO this beer is everything it should be for the style.

4.05,0,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The garnet colored brew has just a bit of haze.  The head settles quickly, but a welcome lace is left down the glass.  Rich, sweet, and toffee - like caramel malt notes dominate the aroma.  The appealing biscuity notes that I've noticed in the other Belhavens is lacking, but an appetizing treacle aroma can be perceived.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and carbonation is fairly low, but the body is a bit thinner than I would like.  The rich malt profile is comprised of caramel malt sweetness, but a bit of dry and bitter roasted barley is evident as well.  Hop bitterness is minimal, while hop flavor is next to nothing.  Belhaven Wee Heavy finishes slightly sweet with more roasted unmalted barley bitterness.  Tasty stuff.  As a beer in itself it's excellent, but as a wee heavy it could've used a bit more malt.","marc77","Apr 07, 2002"
