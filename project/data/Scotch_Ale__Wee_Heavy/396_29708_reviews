"2009 Vintage from the SD Bottle Share"

"Got in a trade with swingracex. 750 ml bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, bottled on 2/11/2014. Pours hazy nearly opaque dark brown color with a small foamy khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a small ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining a thin cap. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, prune, fig, date, licorice, light chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light butterscotch/coconut/leather, and toast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. A fair amount of noticeable alcohol, but subsides as it reaches room temperatures. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, date, licorice, light chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light butterscotch/coconut/leather, and toast/oaky earthiness. Light amount of tannic oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, licorice, light chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light butterscotch/coconut/leather and oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged scotch ale style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Very good aroma and flavor but I thought it was a bit thin and over carbonated.  And it's tough to justify the $40 cost."

"Overall: This is best barrel-aged scotch-style ale I have had.  Unbelievable flavor."

"Another great product of the Alesmith barrel program"

"O - Overall this beer is a killer drink. I can't imagine how good this batch will be aged."
"O- A hard one for me to drink only because I don't enjoy it as much when the bourbon overwhelms everything in the base beer. I can definitely see how some people can really enjoy this, but it's really not for me."

"B/B-"
"O - Not always does barrel-aging a beer make it better but it certainly does in the case of AleSmith's Wee Heavy. Good but uninteresting and frankly quite plain, the normal version of this beer features the same alcohol percentage hidden behind distant maltiness while the barrel-aged version features forward alcohol (at the same percentage) that manages to bring out it's underlying maltiness. Caramel, toffee, and dark fruit are more apparent in the face of bourbon barrel-induced vanilla, oak, and, well, bourbon, and all conglomerate for a party in the mouth that's quite extraordinary but not quite worth the $40 price tag. AleSmith's barrel-aged Wee Heavy is a fantastic beer but if I saw it on the shelves again at the same price I wouldn't think twice about passing on it."

"Bottle from Jeff. Thanks a million! Poured to snifter/tulip thingy deep dark brown with hints of reddish amber at the edges. Half finger caramel colored head that recedes shortly thereafter. Aroma of big biscuit, lots of nuttiness, toffee, vanilla, oak, whiskey booze. Oh man. Flavor is big whiskey and nuttiness with an excellent sweet-bitter balance. Finishes with a nice toffee vanilla caramel sweetness that lingers. Just a bit of heat on the way down. Thick but carbonation is adequate. So glad I got to try it finally. Awesome BA beer, though I might a really like the regular version a tad better. Alesmith continues to impress. PS-This went amazingly with a chunk of cheddar cheese!"

"O: Great beer. The barrel treatment on this one is perfect, and it really adds to the flavor profile of the beer. I would drink this beer any day of the week."
""
""
""

"I feel like if this was done with a lighter wee heavy and less barrel aging time, I would have enjoyed it much more. It's certainly a delicacy; sweet, savory, boozy - a slow sipper and a night cap all the way. But I can't help but feel like it's unnecessarily overdone and it would benefit from curbing some of the intensity just a little bit. Still a very, very solid brew, though."

"When tasted this one came up a bit short, leaving me wanting the full flavor and body of the usual Wee Heavy. This is not a bad beer, mind you, but the standard Alesmith Wee Heavy does set a high bar. I have always appreciated a booze hot mouthfeel, but this one comes out light. Again, not a bad beer, but I am not sure it is an improvement upon the original. A barrel does not universally lead to better!"

"Overall - Had this next to the regular. Loses some caramel, but gains a nice barrel character."
""

"Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and bourbon. Taste is much the same with a brown sugar flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great smell but the taste isn't matching up."
"2012. Pours a dark brown with a small amount of bubbles. The head is beige and dissipates relatively quickly. Nice enough lacing though. Aroma is a well blended mix of bourbon notes and the wonderful flavors of the base beer. There's vanilla, oak, bourbon and a bit of booze mixed into molasses, caramel, fresh dough, toasty malt sugars and all sorts of other warm, friendly flavors. Taste is sweet and warm. It's a lovely beer. I realize that I'm sorta repeating myself here, but the rich malt flavor of the base beer is impeccably blended into the bourbon barrel flavors. Alesmith is one of the very best at barrel aging, and it very much shows in this beer. Feel is smooth and full. Never gets too sticky or boozey. This is just a phenomenal beer. On a sidenote, I don't think it will get any better with age. This beer is drinking wonderfully, right now."

"This didn't live up to the legend of the BA Speedway that I'd built up in my mind, but that's my own couch-issue. Really good beer that I'm really happy to have tried."

"Bottle (2009 vintage): Poured a clear medium brown color ale with a medium size off-white foamy head with some retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with light toffee notes and light butterscotch and some wood with a light whiskey finish. Taste is also a good mix between balanced notes of butterscotch and caramel with some notes of wood and whiskey and light residuals sugar notes. I though the body was a bit thin for the style with medium carbonation."
"Overall - Very smooth and extremely easy to drink. The best beer I've had from Alesmith hands down."
""
""
"o - overall, pretty good, but nothing mind blowing."

"A joy."
"Another great BA beer from AleSmith. With the exception of BA Speedway, I have yet to taste one of their BA brews that isn't outstanding."

"Drinkability: It's hard not to both respect this beer but also be a little disappointed in it all at once. I've half a mind to try and get my hand on a 2009 bottle to see what this one's like at the height of its power (should have tried to do a side-by-side!), because the remnants of a great beer are definitely here. As it stands, this one's a shadow of its former self, but in a way that's demanding of appreciation. Crack 'em if you've got 'em folks."

"Drink- This was my last beer of the night and I was blown away by everything there. This was definitely in the top 5 of the night. A simple amazing beer with layers upon layers of flavors."
"O- incredible, I am so fortunate to be able to be drinking this. Amazing.... I don't know what else to say... So much barrel character! So derrricious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I had to choose something bad to say about BA Wee Heavy, Iâ€™d say the barrels take over the base beer just a bit too much. But hot damn, this is a tasty brew. Sweet, oaky, bourbony, and incredibly smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my favorite beers, because this is always what I hope a BA Barleywine is going to taste like, even though it's not one. Gotta hand it to Alesmith, they do barrel aging right."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very well balanced and tasty, although the base beer does not show through very much in the flavor. That being said, this is nowhere near the bourbon bomb that the last vintage was."
""
"O: a good beer, though not extremely complex. Stil, it's quite tasty and still bourbony after nearly 3 years."
"Big thanks to Thirstybird for sharing this brew. 750ml capped and foiled bottle. 2009 vintage, bottle #678/972. Pours a deep mahogany, almost brown, with no head and no lacing. Nose expresses bourbon, light smoke, and a buttery character; all on malty backbone. Taste consistent with nose. Some vinous notes and a light acidity are also revealed, as well as a trace of maple syrup. The buttery character present in the nose also manifests itself in the flavor profile. There's also more of a barrel presence. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a still carbonation and a slightly oily texture - this beer could use just a bit of carbonation in my opinion. What a great brew that's both easy drinking and complex. That said, I can't say that the BA version is better than the standard (which I also really enjoy); however, it's quite different although nonetheless enjoyable."
"O-wow. Unexpected treat. Almost perfect"
"Pours a gorgeous yellowed brown. Brown with a nice tint. Not really any head. Smells bourbon heavy and a bit boozy. Really nice nose. Tastes boozy and malty. The bourbon is fairly subtle on the tongue compared to the nose. Smooth and rich. Quite good"
"Overall despite the huge bourbon and booze on the aroma this is surprisingly drinkable. I mean I almost don't consider this beer anymore because the bourbon completely overpowers the Wee Heavy base. I don't think this style of beer lends itself to barrel-aging as well as barleywines and stouts, but that's my two sense. I am torn on this beer because while it was tasty, I could have easily just poured a glass of bourbon and added a dash of the original Wee Heavy with similar results. Probably not worth the time, effort or cost it took to procure and I do not need to revisit anytime soon."
"O-- Might be at its peak. Very well done for the style but seems to get forgotten because it is a Wee Heavy and not a Stout. Look and nose were excellent but the mouth dropped off a lot."
"m - medium-heavy body. carbonation keeps it from being too cloyingly thick."
"Really good beer, i like what the barrels did."
"Tried again 12.29.14 and more carbed.  Tasty and changed ratings to reflect new value."
"Bottle 96/222 of the 2005 batch sampled courtesy of Sparky27 @ Hellbillyâ€™s Hellraiser 3.0...THANKS ERIC!!! This one has to take the top honors of the night (and Rodenbach Alexander, Southampton RIS, and Toronado 20th were in the Hiz-Ous)...rusty penny/maple syrup pour with a razor-thin caramel head. Aroma has strong barrel-notes; oak, bourbon, toffee, and molasses. Flavor is sweet malt, candied sugar, dark fruit, brown sugar, and freshly spliced vanilla bean. Quite thick and sticky...WOW!!!"
"O: An extremely well crafted brew, but like I mentioned a million times...I wish there were more traces of the original beer. A must try! Cheers!"
"Thanks Olie! And happy birthday, dude!"
"Overall: The beer is very tasty and smells very nice. Normally I dont have a problem with a beer being a bit hot. The beer seems to be not substantial enough to stand up to the barrel. In many ways I think that this beer was diminished by being barrel aged."
"O; nice wee heavy nice roasted malts, chocolate and cherrys in the nose. the wood i did not find in the taste or smell."
"O: Decadent and a slow sipper. Enjoyed by all."
"M/D: pour looked flat, but It had good carbonation, pretty thick-body. Feels great. Bourbon adds a nice sweet element to the base. Solid beer."
"A sipper, as the booze is pretty noticeable. Surprisingly mellow at the same time. The extremely low carbonation also works really well in this."
"O - Really like this one a lot. Flavorful, smooth, easy to drink. Shocked, as this is one of my least favorite styles, guess the barrel-aging really paid off in this one."
"O: Just fantastic stuff. I'd be happy to drink this any day, though after having the previous release last year, I'd say not the best candidate for aging."
"D - Really enjoyed this one and was glad to try it. I would still like to try an older vintage, but I hear they're becoming oxidized. Def would try this one again!"
"2009 vintage. Pours with pretty low carbonation, looks an even brown color with a touch of tan head. Looks fine. The smell is big bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar and wood with just a touch of smoked malts. Bourbon, oak and smoked/roasted malt blend nicely. Finishes a bit boozy in flavor (not heat) and with some oak. Seems like it could use some time to round out the finish. Lower carbonation and medium body. Enjoyable BA scotch ale. Not as good as I thought it was going to be, but still quite good."
"d - Overall I thought this was a good beer but I was expecting a heavier mouthfeel and more bourbon. I got to try 2 oz.'s or so of an 06 vintage a few months ago and really liked it and remembered it having more bourbon than this newer batch. Still a good beer, but not their best BA beer or vintage."
"D: The fact this is not a RIS really adds to its drinkability. I could drink many more of these."
"Somewhat heavy body, as befits a drink this flavorful, and decent carbonation even after its time in the barrel. This is a beer that I will always look for from now on. This and the BA Speedway."
"Overall, if there's one thing I know about AleSmith, besides the fact that they don't make a bad beer, it's that they know their way around a barrel. A very well done beer and one that's well worth a shot."
"Overall a good beer not the best aged beer."
"Flavor is really quite exceptional with a really nice barrel character. Really smooth and mellow. Beautiful warmth in the finish coming from the alcohol. Slight sweetness comes alongside the dark fruit character. Medium body and quite complex. Good carbonation. I've been waiting quite a long time to try this one, and it certainly was not a disappointment."
"D: A very enjoyable experience. If you are fortunate enough to happen across this brew, you will most certainly enjoy it."
"Beer is medium bodied and really creamy. There is minimal peat in the mid-palate and rounds out nicely to finish the beer. The lead off is a little sweet and very bourbon-y. It is not very hot, just a nice beer all around. The flavors walk that line between tasting like liquor and being liquor. I would have more of this if that were possible. As it is now I'll just have to lean on my memory."
"D-this is very sugary and rather thick and creamy. hints of oxidation and nothing subtle to it. seems to be to style but the flavors seem slightly jumbled together but not bad."
"I don't think this style is really for me but in my opinion this is heavily oxidized and is way past its prime, regardless of my own tastes."
"Excellent beer. At this point, the 2005 vintage is drinking very nicely. Very mellow and very rounded. Now would be a good time to open a bottle (I point this out to the multitudes of you with bottles waiting to be opened). With that said, given the minimal oxidation, it could probably handle another couple of years - but, I don't necessarily see it improving either."
"Creamy body has a delicate carbonation. Very nice."
"I wish I had the patience to save some beers a few years..."
"What an awesome beer. If this wasn't so rare, I'd definitely seek it out again. Easy to drink for what it is."
"Thanks to urwatuh8 for a great trade involving this brew. Pours a maroon/brown/coke color with tan head. Pretty significant carbonation for a BA brew, is this force carbed? Smell is sweet, bourbony, tangy, slightly sour, shriveled raisins and plums and any other fruit that people dry up. You can definitely tell this is oxidizing. It's a 2006 bottle, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Flavor: more of the above. This is a sweet beverage. Some brown sugar, chocolate, and toffee also present themselves. Body is medium/thick with light/medium carbonation. Tasty brew, but I doubt I'll go out of my way to acquire another bottle of this in the future. Nice to have tried it though."
"Appearance is a murky maroon and brown color. Very still, obviously low carbonation, and a very thin off white head that quickly fades to absolutely nothing and no lacing. Aroma is very rich and port like. Strong notes from the barrel of vanilla and bourbon and occasionally raisins, oak, chocolate, etc also assert themselves. Body is lighter side of medium with fine, soft carbonation with a long lasting slightly dry raisin and bourbon finish. Flavor begins with pleasant bourbon sweetness before the base beer with rich malt, toffee, raisin, etc enters and lingers into the finish. Slightly astringent but very little alcohol presence or burn. A very pleasant sipper, mildly complex and delightfully balanced, however maybe a little past it's prime as its lost the robustness and complexity of the regular Wee Heavy."
"Drinkability is solid for a beer of this ABV. This could be a world class beer if there was either more body or a better level of carbonation. But as it is, that glaring weakness has a negative effect on the taste and overall enjoyment. Nonetheless, this is still a fine beer and one I'm glad I had the privilege to consume."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable! It was a little sweet for me, but I'd have no trouble drinking more of it and enjoying it."
"Slightly hot medium body with a nice, silky viscous malt presence with lots of chocolate, roasted coffee bean, burnt toast, caramel and licorice. Very roasty with subtle hops and a huge bourbon presence that is slightly hot and somewhat dominates the flavor. It isn't too overpowering however, allowing the other notes to shine. Slight tannis and a heavy oak and vanilla presence. Absolutely delicious! Highly recommended."
"D- A huge, bourbony beer that has held up well these years."
"Drinkability: ABV is burny and kind of high - definitely a sipper; the maltiness doesn't seem especially well blended with the woodiness and the alcohol, but still pretty solid. I think I actually prefer the regular Wee Heavy from them."
"From the first sip to the last this beer is exceptionally caramelly, rich and not-too-sweet. The barrel-aging complements the earthy quality of the style. It adds an additional dimension that breaks up the heaviness. It is strangely tart and bright in the taste, which is probably due in part to the moderate amount of carbonation in the beer. The carbonation also keeps the stickiness from weighing down the beer, and it finishes nearly clean. This beer almost reminds me more of a wine in the way it drinks. A very highly alcoholic wine."
"The first bottle I had was stored in a cupboard so the oxidation was quite pronounced, but the second bottle I drank on 10/10 was my own and had been stored at 55 degrees since the release. Oxidation was still a bit too strong to be complimentary. This beer is past its prime. Drink it now if you have it."
"D: Damn good. I love the non BA version, and I now love this one too. I would have no problem taking care of a bottle by myself."
"D: Definitely a slow sipper, tasty though."
"The other night, I split a bottle of the 09 vintage that I received from peteinsd with some friends. Very briefly, this was excellent. Fruity with raisins, port, honey bourbon and vanilla, the balance between the base beer and the barrels is exceptionally done here. Fantastic. 4.5/4.5/4.5/5/4.5"
"D - One glass was enough - glad I got to try it, and I'd be interested in trying a new batch, but this seems to be on the decline."
"D: I could sip this one all night long."
"This is a very boozy Scotch ale that will be tasty for those folks who really like a bourbon-heavy taste. Another world class brew from Alesmith."
"The apparent lack of carbonation is compensated for by a full, thick, silky maltiness. This is no thirst-quenching quaffer of course, but is a pleasure to drink nonetheless. The deeper I drink of this, the more entangled I become in a web of pleasure it spins about my soul, so that I desire to drink deeply of it endlessly and endlessly."
"Pours like the non BA version, lightly hazed dark reddish brown, big thick tan head forms, drops a nice amount of lacing, good retention, forms a solid ring. Smell is great, bourbon, toffee, vanilla and oak, iron, lots of fruit, lots of fig and raisin, brown sugar, bread, real nice and integrated. Taste is figs and bourbon up front, toffee, oak, butterscotch/toffee, alcohol, melons, vanilla, great maltiness, some sour oak character in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, really smooth, slightly dry finish, some oaky tannins going on. Very well integrated, Alesmith certainly know how to barrel age to perfect, great beer. Thanks Parker!"
"Very dark amber color with an off-white head. Head quickly disappeared and left very little retention. Smell is boozy, caramel, toffee, and butterscotch. Taste has caramel, butterscotch, bourbon, smoke, dark fruits, and vanilla. Carbonation was light, body was medium. A very nice barrel aged beer. I'd love to drink this more regularly, but obviously it isn't possible. Thanks to doubleo for the bottle!"
"Dark brown, lightly hazed, with coppery and purple highlights. A fine collar of beige bubbles formed after the pour and produced a fair bit of spotty lacing. Good head retention. Aromas were of caramel and plums, toffee, bourbon and booze, vanilla, wood, and tobacco leaf. Low bitterness with a rich flavour. Sweet plums, chocolate covered raisins, sweet cherries and malt, a bit of woody oak, milder alcohol than expected, and a little tartness in the finish. Leaning towards full bodied with low carbonation, very fine bubbles, alcohol warmth, and a dry finish. This stuff was really good, a nice combination of fruit and barrel notes. Well balanced and tasty."
"Drinkability is surprisingly very good. What a nice beer! It's not nearly the big heavy beast I thought it would be. I actually was kind of hoping for a brash and heavy bourbon laced brew. And this wasn't it. This was malty sweet, light oaky booze goodness. This is an excellent beer that I am glad I got to taste."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance of the base beer, excellent balance between the base beer and the barrel character. great stuff."
"Drinkability? I could sip on this all night long. Almost wish my wife weren't downing half of this."
"Notes from 12/17/07"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Chewy toasted malt, tobacco and earth, chocolate and vanilla, huge oak flavor but not overtly bourbony. Malty, but drier than I was expecting. This is a mellow beer to begin with, but barrel aging has smoothed it out even more. No heat whatsoever despite the high ABV, and the low carbonation makes for a silky mouthfeel. Excellent stuff, not quite as outstanding as BA Speedway, but clearly better than BA Old Numbskull."
"Thanks to Tom at O'Brien's SD and his Alesmith tasting for this. Maybe the best beer I've ever had."
"2006 vintage released in 08, bottle 253/254. The first thing I thought when I smelled the open bottle was bourbon. The beer pours a nice brown color and I am pretty sure it looks like the regular wee heavy but I've only had that once. The aromas from the glass seem to be mostly vanilla and bourbon. The taste is pretty good, licorice, vanilla, nutty,fruits different than I remember the regular version but a hint of smoke and peat which I couldn't detect in the regular version. The alcohol is definitely present in this beer. This is a good beer but really only a twist to a beer that was already good to start with. I would definitely purchase this again if I ever had a chance. Damn you Alesmith!!!"
"Good body, low carbonation. Lots of complex flavors and aromas working here. Very enjoyable."
"Big beer but sightly thin in the middle of the mouthfeel. Long never ending finish that shows loads of residual sugar, brown sugar brandy reduced dried fruits really shine through on the finish with a slight warming alcohol. Much sweeter than anticipated. Bourbon, huge vanilla toasted oak, charred woods, with much more caramel in the mouth to balance and add complexity. Dates, fig, dried fruit, creamy on the finish. Slight prickle as well. Bit roasty with only hints of peat showing through. An absolutely amazing beer that I look hugely forward to enjoying again in the future. Thanks Peter!!!!"
"05 Vintage, #184 of 222. Pours still, just a few bubbles hanging around the edge of the glass, regardless of how vigorously I pour. Brown and ruddy in color, a decent haze of sediment. Aroma is outstanding bourbon barrel characteristics, sweet vanilla, great woody notes, big and bourbony alcohol, some aged, worn leather, salty grilled meat and dark rich fruity maltiness all combine in the complex aroma. Taste follows with some nice oaky woodiness, strong, sweet vanilla, only hints of the malty wee heavy style that lay beneath. Good alcohol bite and a dry oakiness wind up the taste. Slightly slick feel on top of the tongue, some peppery alcohol before a warming alcohol breaks into the party and thins things out. Somehat drying in the finish. Outstanding beer, alesmith is doing the barrel ageing very well. Would love to see some barrel aged blends some day from this brewery."
"Drinkability: Very tasty bourbony boost to what was already an excellent beer. Happiness really is a choice."
"Overall I thought this was easily one of the best beers I have ever had. The only thing it lacked was a little bit better initial presentation, but aside from that, it was just sublime. I could have had a dozen bottles and would open one every night. I just think it was amazing the transformation this one undertook. Some Barrel agings just do not go over well, this one on the other hand just went perfectly. I could not have envisioned it being any better. Just perfect I would love to have it again, and can only imagine what the Speedway must be like, if I can ever manager to get a hold of a bottle of that one!"
"After I was done explaining to various people that this was actually beer and not oaked whiskey like they were all claiming, I was able to do my review, I expected more from this brew but it was still good, bourbon and wood character seemed to just take over the original brew, certainly the strongest tasting scotch ale I have tried next to the Berksire for Julio's, might pay the money for another bottle in the future but I am in no hurry to do so, definitely worth trying if you get the chance though"
"D: I definitely think the Barrel Aging has improved the Wee Heavy from Alesmith, which was already a great beer. It gave it more complexity and in the end made it much more interesting, I'll definitely buy another bottle or 2 at the next release, a beer that certainly grows on you as you drink it."
"This beer tastes completely different than the non-barrel aged version. This beer poured a dark brown with little to no head (and by the end of the bottle, no carbonation). Taste and smell had a lot of vanilla, bourbon, caramel, and prunes/figs. As it warmed the beer took on more and more of prune flavors and was completely flat by the time we finished. A great sipping beer, but you will be hard pressed to finish a bottle by yourself."
"I must admit that I like the regular version of this beer a bit better, but that is typically the case for me. I just think that this one is holding up a bit better than most do as the base beer really is such a malty, monster of a beer (though you lose that with the bourbon barrel character layered on top of it). My biggest complaint is the lack of substantial carbonation, a light-medium level of carbonation would be perfect, though it does still do well with the low level that it does have. I really like how complex & integrated the barrel character is here, somehow, though it is the dominant note, it does not overwhelm my palate, and it is not too hot and one dimensional."
"This is drinkable in the sense that I could keep sipping this all night long. It's really a finely crafted masterpiece. As mentioned below, this is second only to the Decadence old ale that was barrel aged. Glad I waited in line for this gem."
"**I'm sorry, but there is no way this beer is only 10%ish alcohol. It's three ... maybe four percentage points above that, at least."
"Feels weird to enjoy a brew that people would pay hundreds of dollars for on eBay, since I didn't and couldn't pay that much for it. Just have to bask in my fortunateness and luck."
"Aroma is dominated by bourbon, but I can detect ample caramel malt, dark fruits, toasted toffee and mild notes of licorice. Body is dark brown, not muddy, and holds a diminishing, frothy tan head. Holds flavors of raisin, stewed prunes, licorice, oak, caramel, vanilla, bourbon and a massive and sustained malt backbone that can more than stand up to the many different flavor components. ItÂ’s a joy to drink and feels very nice on the mouth. It only has the faintest suggestion of smoked malt in the finish."
"I think this beer is great. I am very happy to have had the chance to try this once in a lifetime beer."
