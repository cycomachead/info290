"Malty and you feel the alcohol - almost bourbon-like"
"While it is a wee heavy, it goes down pretty easily.  Yum!"
""
""
""
"I live fairly close to Devils Backbone and go out there occasionally, and while I like many of their beers, this remains my favorite from the brewery."
""
""
""
"As a fan of the style that normally is above average on Wee Heavy, this one disappointed.  Had a late aftertaste that was not really bitter, almost like rubbing alcohol, that lingered in the back of the mouth.  Despite not being extremely big you notice the alcohol, they did not disguise it very well.  Hopefully I just got a bad bottle or something."
"O: Not very complex, but tasty enough. A decent but unremarkable Scottish ale."
""
"First drink was sweet but not too sweet to my taste. Thoroughly enjoyed the brew."
""
"First wee heavy I've had in a while, makes me want to look for some more."
"Love the Eight Point IPA (also produced by Devil's Backbone) and Virginia beers overall (born and raised), so I decided to give this beer a shot.  Pours a dark amber with minimal head and moderate lacing.  Taste is very sweet, aromatic, citrus...Overall a great taste but nothing wildly unique or explosive.  Goes down smooth with very little aftertaste.  Overall, I enjoyed this beer and would drink it again!"

"Has a nice ruddy hue, leaning towards brown.There is a thin white head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves microscopic amounts of lacing. The aroma is pretty underwhelming, with only slight malt tones. The taste is a little bit more robust, with a nice generic malt profile and a decent hit of alcohol that threatens to overwhelm it but then dials back. There is also a nice earthy hops quality. THe body has a nice weight to it and a good thick feeling with just a hint of carbonation."
"Not much of a aroma, its my first scotch ale but I've got to say I like the sweet taste"

"Pours dark very little head.Not much smell.taste not too bitter smooth going down after taste a bit like Scotch. The right amount of alcohol to give it a kick.Drink a few of these and switch to a larger with less alcohol volume to keep the buzz.Outstanding beer from one of the best Devils Backbone."

"Beer poured into a ""pint"" glass from a 12 oz bottle. Beer pours reddish orange with little head. Beer smells of fruitiness, this is inviting. Tastes of nice barrel aged taste with dark berries, not bad. Beer is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall, an above average beer."

"A bit of a disappointment, mainly because it seems off the category I was expecting"
""
"O: This is a nice beer for a winter night. Doing a full review now, I notice the flaws in the beer a bit more. That being said, this is the last beer of the 2nd 6-pack that I picked up. It's a solid beer, works just as well out of the bottle as out of the glass, and it'll warm you up."

"D: This was an average scotch ale at best. The scent and taste and body weren't bad, but not that enjoyable. The finish was a little rough too, so it wasn't easy to drink or enjoy. Not recommended."
""
""
""
"Nice dark amber color with a nice head - very little lacing. Rather strong flavor but not overwhelming. Roasted caramel notes with a slightly bitter (but not too bitter). Very nice mouthfeel. Overall a rather tasty beer. Will be buying this one again."
""
"Overall not bad a wee heavy not the best but reasonably priced and quite drinkable, a big malty treat."

"Overall it's also not quite boozy for the style, but the palate flavor is intriguing and enjoyable. Nice one to add to the Devils Backbone collection."
""
"Who wouldn't love this by name alone?! I was a wee bit leery of the moniker of Scottish ale...I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. On first sip I tasted hints of black licorice and another sweetness that I could just cannot put my finger on...perhaps a true scotch-y flavor? Nonetheless I am savoring this pint, and sipping it slowly as this is not a quaff to be chugged."
""
"Picked up a sixer of this after seeing it in the store. I had liked wee heavys in the past so figured it'd be worth it. Poured into a snifter from the bottle. Nice dark amber color with minimal head. Lots of smells, very complex. Can't put my finger on everything, but I get some nice malty backbone, apricot, and a bit of alcohol. Taste is very much the same. Solid beer overall. Very happy I bought it."
"o: a nicely malty scottish ale, alcohol only peeks out as it warms, not really complex but carries some good aromas and flavors"

"For the style, I think they missed on this one. Love the brewery, just not this beer."
"Not a typical - nor above average - wee heavy. But a solid attempt and Certainly a couple will warm you on a cool night."
"O:I don't normally drink this style but this wasn't that bad I wouldn't go back but if its your thing seems worth a try regardless goes down fast for the abv so there is that"

"O- one of Devil's Backbone's best offerings. Not trying to be anything other than a solid example of the style."
""
""
"O: This brew hits where it counts -- in the smell and taste. And, for that I gotta say I'm pretty impressed. Been meaning to drink Devil's Backbone stuff. Being in VA, I'm really rooting for it. Nice offering here."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the high side of the style. Overall, it's a pretty good version of the style. The malt flavors were nicely done and it was pretty drinkable and flavorful overall."
""
""
""
""
"O- I have not been a huge fan of DB offerings so far, but this is probably the best one I have tried yet. I am reminded of a Belgian influenced Scotch Ale, if you can imagine. Now that this brewery has expanded distribution across most of VA, it would be nice to see them take a step back and think about doing some more unique, perhaps ""reserve"" beers (a la Blue Mountain Barrel House, just down the road). We shall wait and see! I recommend giving this one a try though!"

"On tap at Rustico during the Devilâ€™s Backbone NoVA launch. Served in a taster glass. Pours a decently-dark brown color with a good tan head. Spots of lacing on the way down. The nose carries some sweet caramel, and a bit of bread and toffee. Mild sweetness to the flavor and just a hint of fruit in the background. Body is medium. Good finish."
