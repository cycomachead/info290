"Malty, strong slightly smokey ale. Dark rich red brown color. Great price for the flavor. Wee good."
""
""
""
""
"An excellent scotch ale!  Super smooth and creamy.  I had this in nitro from a can.  It pours pitch black and has a nice tan head.  Smell is chocolate, coffee, and all things dark.  Feel is like silk in the mouth.  Not a heavy ale; easily drinkable.   Excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Malt forward with a subtle hop presence. A solid Scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent  with great scotch taste that doesn't  overpower  the beer."
""
"at 55 deg. And above it's very good!"

"Compared to Dirty Bastard: tastes more like a beer. But I get that same overall flavor profile; same lineage there w/in the style. But given the 4 stars I gave to Dirty Bastard, lowering to 3.5. Which is not a knock on Old Chub by any means. Just trying to compare the two."

"3/12/15 (Draft - Iron Horse Ale House) - Very dark black beer with nice thin brown head and light carbonation. Smokey malt and chocolate aroma. Nice dark coffee and chocolate taste, texture firm, solid feel, nice taste and kick going down. Overall excellent beer!"
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is a really good Scotch Ale, a little too boozy for my liking but otherwise very enjoyable, I would not have more than one in a sitting due to the ABV."
"Solid Wee Heavy. Not as good as those I tried in Scotland, but still very good. It amazes me that folks here rate numerous examples of this style above Traquair House, the clear exemplar of the style."
""
""
"pretty smooth; nice aroma; looks above average"
"Would be great without the smoked flavor which is a bit distracting.  Would be good with chili but not by itself."
""
""
""
"Deep, dark mahogany pour with tiny tan fine foam. Light aromas of malty chocolate and some alcohol. Sweet flavors of chocolate and caramel are so smooth and dangerous. Slightly smokey finish per commercial desc is accurate. This stuff is dessert, but I could enjoy several. Fantastic."
""
""
""
""
"O-  Good scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
"Certainly an enjoyable beer. Big, sweet, and grainy."
""
"Overall: Nope. I drink these styles of beer expressly for the malt. As soon as enough hops to start coming forward join the party, I'm out."
"Overall: Pretty good on it's own, if you're in the mood for something sweeter. This beer is really amazing with any dairy or caramel dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth drinking medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good. Not as many flavors as the Iron Thistle, if you like some bitterness in this style then go for Rahr's offering. Otherwise, this is a good choice."
""
"Filled with toasty and nutty  feeling"

"What I compare other scotch ales to"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O (4) - All in all, a 'nice' beer.  I'm not going to wait in line on Black Friday to get this, but I certainly will buy it again."
""
""
"O: A very nice scotch ale with waves of sweetness and dark fruits with just enough smokiness to keep it interesting. Surprisingly easy to drink given the heavier body/maltiness and abv."
"Great Scottish ale. Usually there is some hint of diacetyl in Scottish ales but these guys nailed it. No butter after taste smooth and strong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  Not big on scotch ales, but I like this."
""
"Excellent Scotch Ale. Definitely recommend."
"not a huge fan of this"
""
""
""
""
"I wish there were more Scotch Ale's on the market. This is a great example. Malty as hell, and delicious. There are hints of coffee within the intense malt flavor. While it doesn't sip well at the end, it's still a paramount among Scotch Ales."
""
"Malty, caramel, smoky. Hides the ABV well."
"Pours a very deep mahogany that is almost pitch black in color with a thin foamy head. Sticky lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of malts and caramel for the most part. Bit more going on with the taste as there is a very light hint of smoke that actually was pleasant. No bitter or harsh aftertaste and you couldn't taste the higher alcohol content but knew it wasn't a 5%er either. Medium bodied with lower carbonation. A really good brew of this style."
""
""
""
"O: Well balanced, tasty, flavor develops while it warms."
""
"T: follows the nose, though more pronounced and there's a bit of nuttiness around the edges that I didn't get in the nose.  The malts are layered, and come in a hearty breadiness, toffee/caramel as well as a touch of chocolate...nothing too sweet, but very flavorful.  What really makes it go, though, in terms of taste, is the faint peaty smoke, a little grassy hoppiness, and the oaky vanilla.  Again, holds back from becoming too sweet or cloying; really delicious."

"Had this one on Nitro.  Made a big difference with the mouth feel."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beer, much more so than the nitro version - it has just the right taste and feel, but watch out, this angry scot will will club you down if you're not careful at 8% ABV."

"V - Great value, comes in a six pack of cans."

"Creamy. Smooth and enjoyable brew. WishIhad more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown with an amber tint.  A quarter inch of beige foam is present.  Brussels lacing.  I smell subtle,sweet dark malt.  The flavor is packed with sweet,dark malt with a nutty edge.  The mouth is a bit chewy and lightly sticky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my style but pretty tasty"
""
""
"Taste: Nice sweetness followed by toasted malt flavors.  Not much hoppy flavors.  Everything is balanced and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Dark brown, with small head. Fruity caramel smell - kind of dubbel-like. Taste has a lot of toastiness, tobacco. A little too intense and noticeably boozy."

"O - Old Chub has quickly become one of my go-to's. It's affordable and available in many grocery stores, but it has a truly complex and finely crafted flavor that is virtually unheard of in its price range. The only downside is the overwhelming heaviness of the sugars and malts that discourage having more than one. But that one is always a luxurious and memorable delight."
"for a beer that comes out of a can this is really good beer"

"Very pleasant and sessionable for the style."
"Had this on nitro tap. Incredibly smooth. Smokey, peaty, heavy mouthfeel."
"Picked up a six for my Fantasy Draft, just to try something other than the IPAs and Lagers that would be around. I was able to only have two of them as the rest of the deadbeats guzzled them. Overall, everyone loved it. I rather have a Wee Strong, but it was a nice taste with TONS of malt, and very good. I can see sipping this around a fire place while making fun of someone's haircut."

"This is a dark brown ale with a nice 1/2"" thick head and lacing on the sides of the glass.  Nice full malty aroma.  This is a delicious beer with hints of coffee and chocolate.  I will drink this over and over..."

"This is one of my favorite scotch ales, pours a dark dark brown, almost black. With a creamy white head with a little bit of lacing. Tastes like it should, scotch hinted ale. Good stuff!"

"Deep brown pour. Delicious beer. I really liked the nitro version of this beer. This one holds its own for sure. Malty and rich. Great beer. Man I love this one. Sweet and warm if that makes any sense at all."

"Wow, I was not expecting this beer to punch me in the face, but it did!  I should have read the 8% ABV on the can before buying it, since I usually like my Scotch ales a little lighter.  But it's a tasty beer, though I think it might be a little better if it was in fact lighter.  The alcohol kind of overwhelmed this one.  The sweetness and alcohol content combine to make this an intense, heavy beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Don't let the can turn you off.  The first time I had it I drank it straight out of the can and didn't think much of it.  Recently I had it out of a glass and it made a huge difference. Very smooth with a clean finish."

"Few friends love this beer , acquired taste I guess was not for me, strange flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a fair bit of head that quickly dissipates. Sweet aroma. Tastes sweet and inviting with notes of brown sugar, candied fruits and carmel. Very pleasant on a crisp night."

"I had this on a nitro tap at a whole foods. I am quite a fan of the Scotch ale/Wee heavy style in general having had a particular opportunity to try a good few on a recent trip to Edinburgh and this one was just about everything I want in one. It was malty, creamy, had a little bit of that whisky flavor, and all in all a great dark beer in general and a wonderful Scotch ale. The nitro tap was also hug in bringing out the creamy and almost dessert-like qualities in this beer which were outstanding to begin with. Coupled with the consistency of a nitro pour (almost like a milkshake) this made for an amazing overall experience."
""
""
"Old Chub pours a brownish color with a nice white lacing head. There is a earthy aroma, with smokey peaty malt notes. The taste has smokey peaty malt flavors, and some earthy tones, brown sugar notes. Great body, and very smooth and easy to drink. Overall its a top notch scottish ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a tasty ale, and potent, strong, and bold. If you want a smooth, strong, and very sweet - malt-dominated - brew, this is a good option. The nitro (especially on tap) is a fantastic choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep clear ruby brown with a thinner creamy tan head, lingering on around the circumference. The aroma is rich malt, deep with notes dark fruit and rich earth. The taste is complex deep malt flavors, with more dark fruit, burnt sugar, and earthy notes. It has a nice silky mouthfeel and weight. A great Scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
"Great daily drinker, but also goes great paired with a spicy Thai or Indian dish (at least for my palate). Not the most prolific example of the Scotch Ale genre you will find, but an extremely tasty, well-crafted brew, especially at this reasonable of a price point."

"I wanted to like this beer, but my initial reactions were not positive at all. I gave it a 2.50 rating within the first two minutes. Obviously I deleted that rating. I'm somewhat new to the craft beer scene, and I found the taste syrupy and bitter and kinda gross. But as I approached the bottom, I started to warm up to it and the beer seemed to settled down. I don't think it was simply the alcohol taking effect and me growing acclimated to the new taste, though I'm sure that played a part. But the beer seem to change consistency midway through. I found it quite good at the end. I definitely want to try again"

"Overall this is a waaaayyyy better beer than I expected. I shouldn't be surprised considering how much I love Ten Fidy. It's just that most of the discussion I've seen was about either that or Dale's Pale Ale and the latter is sort of panned, so I thought Ten Fidy was maybe a one-hit wonder sort of thing. That was not the case and I will now try any Oskar Blues beers I can find. I can't believe this is year-round and less than $10 a six pack! I'm also glad I got this with regular carbonation because I really don't care for nitro at all. Just tastes flat to me."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown with moderate tan head that thins and laces. The aromas are of walnut, green sappy wood, & fruity pear. Sweet flavours follow the nose, but drying with addition of some smokiness, and caramel. Mouthfeel is smooth, followed by roasty wood notes in the finish. Nicely done."
""
"Heavyness which gives all the flavor only detracts from the drinkablity in minute amounts."
""
""
""

"O - a very nice evening beer to relax with, but not quite a fireside beer. A beer that I would limit to 1, maybe 2 to a sitting, because of its richness. Highly recommend letting the beer warm to cellar temp before drinking."
""
""
""
"This beer was ok, it was not as strong as I thought that it would be. It is a really dark beer, almost black. It does not have a very strong scent to it, almost like their is no scent to it at all. It could just be me but I did not notice that much of a scent. It is a smooth beer for a dark beer. The taste was ok not my favorite but it was ok."

"Just a little too sweet; other than that, pretty much the perfect wee heavy."

"Final Word: Not as complex as I’d like, but at least the flavor here is good. The beer became more flavorful and enjoyable as I drank it, so I’d recommend letting it warm up some before diving in. The profile was so simple, mostly consisting of sweet malt and chocolate, that there is no danger of this beer becoming overwhelming at a higher temperature. Even after the beer opened up a bit, it was still very straightforward and simple. This a beer for people who like sweet, caramel malts but aren’t a fan of any hop bitterness in their beer. I’d choose this one as a safe bet if there’s nothing great around, but it doesn’t stand out enough to warrant ordering it over beers you already know you love."

"Great, low-hop flavored ale...I wasn't in the mood for a lot of hops this afternoon, so I decided to skip the IPAs this time to try a malty Scotch Ale. Good on the nose, great feel in the mouth, and very good follow-through on the taste, with a caramel malt finish. So good, I had to order a second one just to make sure the first impression was correct, and it was!"

"Poured into a glass and was very impressed. The color was dark brown with a cream colored head. The smell had a bit of wood and a lot of malt in it. The taste was great with smooth wood beginning and then you get a little bit of hop and then the sweetness of the malt takes over. For such a robust beer I was surprised that it wasn't overly syrupy thick. Overall, I thought it was a great beer and I liked that I could bring the cans out fishing."

"O: I really like the flavor of this one. It is less like a traditional beer (think lager) flavor and almost like more of a soft drink with 8.0% ABV. Really easy to drink - really nice mouth feel and flavor. Very happy surprise with this one."

"It looks great - dark, with a creamy head that isn't too voluminous or fluffy - but what sold it for me was the smooth feel and rich taste. It also helps that a pint doesn't feel overly filling. The alcohol content is a nice middle ground between weak and overwhelming."

"At one point I was a huge Scottish and Scotch ale buff. I'd like to think this is still true but over the last little bit exemplars of this style have fallen a tad flat for me and its not just the naturally low carbonation for these styles (nyuk nyuk). Let me just say that Old Chub has restored my faith. A dark ruddy brown brew with a shapely large khaki colored head, the aroma jumps right out in the rich sweet malt department, all toffee and malted milk powder. Palate is classic sweet malts as well, the same components as on the nose with a little treacle and faint wispy campfire smoke. On top of these to-be-expected elements, I also get some boozy raisins and dry chocolate. Complex malt bill is shining and although one can concoct a solid Scottish ale with nothing but pale malts and a pinch of roasted barley, the multifaceted approach is working well here. Just a bit boozy. The sweetness persists right through until the finish, but there is also some dry cacao powder to provide some balance. Wonderful ""wee heavy"" and highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O - Old Chub is a very pleasant scotch ale."
""
""
"O- This was an awesome beer. I've been on a big malt kick lately and this one definitely didn't disappoint! I loved the combination of aromas and flavors in this beer and how they played together so well with the scotch. Very nicely balanced and well crafted."

"Is it the best scotch ale I've ever had??? Not by a long shot. . . But damn do I feel comforted that I can go to a Trader Joes, World Market, or novelty beer selection of Whole Foods and find an easy pack of these bad boys to indulge in without breaking the bank. . ."

"Cloudy, rusty brown pour, with a inch or so of off-white head that lasts a while, leaving some lace on the glass. Aroma is pretty much full-blown malts and dark sugars, light phenols. More of the same in the taste, caramel malts, toffee and brown sugar, sweet chocolate notes, lightly smoked peat, some earthy hops. Smooth mouthfeel with a slightly sticky aftertaste, medium body. Pretty much appropriate all around for the style."

"Tried this beer once at my cousin's wedding after about 12 Dale's Pale Ales... wasn't too impressed. Wanted to give it a go with a clear palate (and mind) as well as few years more experience. Poured from the can (5/22/14 date) into my snifter. This poured a deep, dark hue... like a translucent mahogany with a 1/2 finger of eggshell head which retained pretty well. Lacing galore in my glass. Nice bready aromas with some fig/raisin goodness and a slightly boozy/funky note. Caramel up front, followed by a nice mix of the dark fruits and booze. Nice balance of malt and bitterness. Medium/heavy body to this one, great carbonation throughout and a nice bit of chew to the brew. Really enjoyed this one the second time around. Look forward to trying a few more in the style. Cheers!"

"O - A nice Scotch Ale. A very easy drinker and a good representation of the style."
""
"I'm never quite sure what to make of this style, but a decent brew nonetheless. Looks a bit lifeless - shame the head disappears so rapidly. The aroma and flavour are replete with sweet caramel and hints of sugar, along with a touch of pine-laden hops. Nice, smooth body. A solid effort, though I can't say it blew me away. Worth sampling if you stumble across it, but I probably wouldn't go hunting for it."

""
""

"O. That first sip shocked me but after letting it sit and air out, the flavors exploded and I fell in love with this beer. I am now a big fan and introduced it to friends who felt the same way initially but also fell in love with this scotch ale after letting it breath."
"O: Quite let down by this one. Very little complexity and what flavor it has is off-putting."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Dark, dark brown ... almost black, with nice red edges when held to the light. Foamy one finger head, when poured with some vigor, that fades to a thin sticky lace. Delicious aromas of caramel and toffee! Malty, but not markedly sweet, with enough hops bitter and carbonation to leave a fairly clean and dry finish. Flavors of burnt toffee, roasted coffee, bourbon and vanilla are present on the palate and finish. Not a big fan of the style, a bit too malty for my taste, but this one is good nonetheless."
"O: I could drink this one all the time. A fine example of a Scotch Ale. So smooth. The bourbon backbone makes it all the better. Recommended."
""

"Overall- This is what I think of when I image an archetypical Wee Heavy. I really can't fault this beer. It drinks so easily. For such a high gravity beer, the sweet malts don't overwhelm the senses because of the wonderful balance of bittering hops. If you like Wee Heavies then you will love this. Guaranteed. If you haven't tried one but enjoy robust porters and stouts, give this style a try. I bet you'll really enjoy it."
""
""

"Overall: I've only had a few scotch ales and haven't completely developed a taste for them yet, but this is on par with what I've had in the style, although I think it needs to be more smokey. Solid beer nonetheless"

"I'll repeat myself: Overall, this is a well crafted Scotch ale. Meaty and hefty without making you work to drink it, just bitter enough to keep it from being clingy and heavy. The malt shines here. In a world full of IPA this and IPA that, it's nice to have a relatively big, bold, malty brew to turn to. This one fits that bill nicely. Well worth seeking out."

"I asked he bartender to suggest something different and he slowly said, ""Well, we just tapped some Old Chub and it's pretty good"". This was more than just pretty good! It was an excellent surprise. I'm not a Scottish ale expert but if this is an indicator, I'm in for more. This was a mild, sweet porter like ale with hints of malt, fruitiness and lingering flavour. This is a sipper and not a guzzler. I've heard good things about Oskar and it was great to try my first one blind."

"Overall: A extremely good beer. My first in the ""Scottish Ale"" category, so I can't compare to others as of yet, but who would want to? This is everything I want it to be. With that being said, I took a hard look at my ratings and asked ""Can it truly be improved upon?"" And I said ""No it can't"" to Taste and Mouthfeel. So I upped them to 5s. Looks: I'd like a bit more lacing. Smell: A bit more than just the wood/molasses that I was getting."

"Big fluffy khaki head recedes quickly to a soapy foam. Decent lacing. Garnet amber beer. Smells of coffee, chocolate, caramel and toffee. Taste has some coffee overtones with very pleasing smoothness of caramel, toffee and light earthiness. Mild carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Medium body. Pleasant toffee caramel finish."

""

"O: This is probably my favorite scotch ale. Many fail to deliver the characteristic butterscotch/caramel flavors that come from the long boil and caramelization of the malt, but this does not. It's definitely worth a try and recommended, as are all of their beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from nitro tap into a snifter. Pours pitch black with a nice slightly off white head. Smells of chocolate with slight coffee. Tastes of very strong coffe with nice chocolate aftertaste. Beer is medium bodied very smooth nice finish. Overall a very good beer."

""
""
"I was served this for the first time in the clubhouse on draft at a friend's golf course. I don't usually drink darker beers while playing but this was so good I wanted to go back for more."
"Taste&Mouthfeel: Wow, this beer is way more complex than I even expected. Definitely roasted malt, caramel, bread, and coffee. Not too bitter, but not as sweet as I was prepared for. Actually a nice surprise that there's little to no cloying sweetness. Round in the mouth, medium body. Warming slightly on the tongue, which is quite pleasant. The coffee notes come through the more I taste through this brew. Medium carbonation. I personally miss the carbonation, but it truly is spot on stylistically. High appreciation for this particular brew, well executed and very enjoyable."

"Tried this on tap at Dick Odows after they ran out of draft Ten-fiddy. The pour is a dark amber color with very little head but a decent lasting lacing. It was hard to tell the clarity of this in the dark bar but it seemed darker and a touch thicker than many of the scotch ales I've had. The aroma is malty and sweet. Almost too sweet. Carmel and toffee notes abound. Flavor follows suit with notes of smoke and a pleasant alcohol bite on the tail. Im not sure I like how sweet this one is. Almost a little cloying. As a fan of scotch ales I believe I'll stick with Dirty Bastard or Wulvers next time. But still a nice offering from an excellent brewer."

"drinking this beer mid afternoon after an easy shift. given to me by a friend who usually is into IPAs.it has a mellow feel with a good drinkability. unsure of the price that this would cost at a bar or by the 6-12 at the store, but I'd pay 2 bucks for it."

""
"Overall, another great Oskar Blues offering."
""
""
""
""
"My first Oska Blues try. I had not tried a Scottish ale before, so I can't compare it to other Scottish ales. A nice deep brown color with a finger of foam. A great butterscotch, caramel flavor with a manly finish. A little on the sweeter side also. I'll definitely be buying this beer again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Picked up a six-pack for $9 at Ye Ole. Pour great, beautiful looking wee heavy that has an awesome strong smell that gets a wow out of me. Taste is as good as the smell, absolutely wonderful beer that I sucked down, did not seem to be 8%. Overall a great beer and when you consider the value due to cost it is as good as it gets. Will be a regular buyer."
""
""
""
"Canned 9/24/13. Dark brown pour with a dark ruby cast. Massive head and lasting lacing. Light nose of malt - sweet, chocolate, biscuit. Heavy medium bodied with normal carbonation. The mouthfeel is almost slick. The taste profile is every flavor of malt available. Very well balanced between the malt variants with just a hint of alcohol. The flavor isn't as pronounced as Founder's Dirty Bastard, but this one is outstanding. The finish is smooth with a slight alcohol kick on the roof of the mouth that lingers"

"Definitely one of the better Scottish Ales."

"I had a tough time figuring this one out. It's very good, but I don't know why with regard to the particulars. There's a malty smell for sure, but then I can't really place the taste. It's a bit like caramel, or something similar in sweetness. The alcohol is very well hidden. This is great...and I don't know why. I would get it again."

"Poured from a can. Not too much of a head. Color is dark brown, mid to high 30s SRM. Left very solid lace. Aroma was mildly sweet but the high alcohol is apparent and you definitely enjoy it on the taste. No bitterness. The alcohol leaves a warming flavor as it goes down and almost acts as a topical on the roof of the mouth. Medium viscosity is enjoyable on the palate as it lingers. Great Scotch ale that seems stronger than the 8 it claims. I would buy again and can recommend to anyone wanting a wee heavy."
""
""
"Pours a brilliantly clear, red-mahogany, with a short-lived tan head. Deep, rich malty nose with suggestions of candy sugar and grape-nuts. Rich, enveloping, malty palate balanced by a reserved hop bitterness. Decent Belgian lace forms. The ABV provides warmth and is noticeable. Tastes like a heavy should! Sweet, delicious, rich, and satisfying. You can have too many!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It has been awhile since I've sampled this style and I've always enjoyed them (even though I rarely opt for them). This beer is reminiscent to liquid caramels and I love it! I would have liked the mouthfeel to be a little more full bodied, but that's a minor issue for me. Now that Oskar Blues is readily available in my area, I will be purchasing again."

"O - I love this beer and would recommend it to anyone looking for a dark, flavorful beer."
""
""
""
"It pours a dark brown with a decent amount of head, similar to many Scotch Ales. Both the smell and the taste are of malts and caramels but what distinguishes this one is a sweet, candy-like taste and smell. Ideally, I would have liked it to be a little more bold and malt-forward but overall, this is a great Scotch Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Described as a Light Stout when I 1st tried it Nitro."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a very good, nearly outstanding beer. I've been into the Scotch Ales lately and Founders Dirty Bastard has set a standard that makes beers like this - good beers - pale in comparison. This is easy drinking and a great beer to pair with a burger, but on its own it won't blow you away."
""
"It poured a deep dark mahogany almost like a Cola with little head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was of sweet malt and toffee and the taste continued the sweet malt with a hint of chocolate. It had a medium to full body and was very smooth, although slightly boozy. Not overly complex, but highly drinkable. I haven’t had a Scotch Ale in a long time and I thoroughly enjoyed the Old Chub, although it did get a little sweet to me at the end."
"Very rich malt profile, but it's a little lacking in the peat character that I look for in a good scotch ale. Less complex than most. A bit too sweet."
""
""
""
"O- this beer is a complex beer that may take a few to figure it all out"
""
"Taste is similar, with a heavy-duty malt bill and touches of spicy-sweet bourbon, peat, leather, and tobacco. And the high alcohol content (8%) is well-submerged. This is a killer Scotch ale and a top-tier example of the style. Bravo."

""
""
""
""
""
"A nice little warm alcohol added nicely to a slightly darker tasting beer makes for a pretty good drink."
"Poured from (of course) a can into a beer mug. Deep, slightly cloudy brown color. Beige head that disappears quickly. Smells of coffee and caramel. Taste like smokey sweet hops, with a nice alcohol overlay. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. The best beer I have ever poured out of a can! I'd go again."

"i wish it was a tad more unctuous and the hop-head in me would like a little touch of hop bite... no matter what -- this is easily the best widely distributed scotch-style ale <<< and it is a very worthy style indeed."

"Picked this up from Target for about $8.50, six pack cans. Poured from the can into a mason jar (neither of my big bell goblets are clean; seemed the next most appropriate glassware). I haven't had this since last winter and thought it was black, but this actually pours more of a dark mahogany with a fairly thick tan head. Nose on it is pretty impressive, heavy dark fruit, raisin, malt, jam. Flavor is also raisiny, jammy, SWEET, lightly hopped and a little alcohol lingers on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and syrupy. Leaves some stickiness on the lips. I will say as it warms up it deteriorates into this sort of malty, alcoholic mess, but just put a good chill on it and drink promptly! I'm actually really blown away. I've had this before, quite a few times, actually, and don't remember it being this awesome, but it is that awesome."

"12 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 2/13/2013. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, smoked meat, wood, raisin, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, nuttiness, wood, light smoke, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and moderately slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent scotch ale. All around great complexity and balance of malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"O - Really nice Scotch ale - smokiness is more prevalent than most of the brews I have tried in this style."

"This came across as very one dimensional and not particularly diverse but still rather tasty."

"O - Decadently rich. Satisfying like a dessert.  Enjoyed this side-by-side with a Founders Backwoods Bastard.  I enjoyed both; and in particular, liked the lower ABV of this brew with still plenty of mouthfeel and malt flavor.  I didn't miss the bourbon character either.  Impressive."

"Back home from a trip to Colorado got the chance to pour from can to glass. Nice deep mahogany red color. Lovely 2 finger off white foam of fine bubbles. Leaves lots of fine lace behind. Holding the glass to my nose brings on sweet molasses, toffee, and smokey malty grain. Flavors are kill for the style - caramel, smoked almonds, chocolate, vanilla bean, and coffee. Feels creamy and thick. Coats your whole mouth and hangs a while. Overall, I love this Scotch ale. Why oh why did I not buy more..."
""
""
""

"Had a few sips from the can and wasnt impressed - definitely pour this into a glass! It pours with a nice, thick 3 finger head that quickly dissipates to one finger. Color is deep caramel - like a typical root beer. The taste was light but also very malty with hints of chocolate. Strong alcohol presence on the end that made surprised that its only 8%. A bit sweeter than I usually like in a beer but I'd definitely drink it again. One of the few beers that I didnt like better as is warmed up and, despite being lighter & easy to drink, I dont think I would drink strictly this all night long."

"Picked up in part of variety pack in Cincy as not available in my market. An appealing burnt cardinal red color with creamy 1 finger albeit slow poured yet short lived head in tall German .5 L glass (wonderful lacing). Smell was absolute malty with a small bit of prune cocoa contrast happening. Mouthfeel and drink was naturally a solid malt backbone with smooth lightly smoked toasted tootsie roll poured over just the right amount of select hops to give this scotch ale a medium sweet but pleasjng finish. Impressive if your first go at a scotch ale as not to smoky. Effervescence died very soon so swallowing is quite unimpeded. Higher abv is hidden so you'll quickly feel this great ale. Good anytime"

"Poured from a 35ml can. Pours a cola/chestnut/root beer brown colour. The nose offers notes of sweet cocoa, caramel and roasted nuts. There are rich notes of peat smoke, roasted nuts and sweet malt. This is a big, smooth, complex and easy-drinking brew."
"Overall- Excellent brew, not sure how it represents the style, but there isn't too much scotchyness, its a little more stout-like"
"Overall: This is a fantastic beer in almost every way. It's rich mouthfeel and caramel taste profile make it a very satisfying experience, while it remains very drinkable despite the 8.00% ABV."

"I have been really enjoying my scotch ales lately and thanks to Cellarbrations at Carlisle I get to sample this and it pours a dark mahogany hue with a fluffy yet creamy two finger head that stays all day long and leaves beautiful clingy lacing around the rim,the smell is abit weird it's half bourbon and coke mixed with herbal hops and a tinge of peat,the mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation which suits perfectly and has tastes of dark fruits,a tinge of peated malts,sticky toffee,caramel and finished with a beautiful neutral finish which is neither bitter nor sweet and overall apart from its aroma while cold as it does pan out abit when warms up and gets easier on the nose it's quite a tasty scotch ale that I could session on given the fact it hides its ABV so so well,will make sure I get a few more of these before they vanish cheers."

"Final Thoughts: Wow, it's been a long time since I've been able to honestly give a beer anything over a 4.0 rating in the taste category. I was lucky to pick this one up while on vacation in FL and can't wait to visit the brewery on another trip later this month. It's my opinion, based on what I've had from them, that Oskar Blues delivers some seriously good beer. If Old Chub never gave you pause in your local beer store before then let it do so now. A great example of the style and one of the best beers I've had in the past few months. Would I drink it again? Of course."

"I'm a big OB fan, but I'm not a big fan of this particular one. Even as Scotch ales go, I have prefered certain others considerably more. Fair."

""
""
""

"Overall: I like Oskar Blues, but I was still surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer. Very nice and very drinkable: a good one for a hot day on the porch."

"very enjoyable scottish ale. great if you like them big and malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: different. i'll give it that. but other than the really nice nose, there's nothing about this brew that will get me to buy another six-pack. still, Oskar Blues gets major points for trying to nail down a style that isn't yet another hop salad IPA. won't buy any more but glad i tried it."

"The stellar carbonation lends a creamy texture to the medium body that complements the flavor of the beer quite well. This is a brew where the whole definitely exceeds the sum of its parts. It's flavorful, lively, and sessionable in spite of its moderately high ABV (it strikes me as the scotch ale equivalent of Domaine DuPage). This is the first offering I've had from Oskar Blues, and I must say I'm impressed."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, decent foamy head, and some very sporadic but distinct lacing. Nose is complex combination of sweet, fall spice, and peat. Flavor is charred coffee accentuated with bitter licorice and sweet molasses. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"I think the flavor is a little underwhelming but a solid scotch ale that's always available. Always nice to have a malty beast in a can."
""
"Quite a complex and tasty beer. An excellent interpretation of a scotch ale- hits all the high point of this style. I'd buy again."

"Overall- very tasty I would order another for sure. I had it with a steak but I think it would be good with dairy based desserts, chicken and dumplings meat pies. Good country cooking!"
"Overall (4.00) – I'm pretty satisfied with this for a scotch ale. There is not an abundance of flavor, but I think the mouthfeel is spot on."
"Overall a big chewy treat that I have been meaning to try for years but just never picked up. A good brew from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
"O- Quite a nice beer. I do like Scotch Ales and this delivers fully. Oskar Blues continue to prove they are a quality brewery (which I would love to visit sometime). I would definitely recommend trying this beer, especially if you like the style or would like to try the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had some nice traditional Scotch Ale flavors to go with some smokey peat that only a few Scotch Ale's I have tried have had, it combined both those aspects and makes it pretty balanced and smooth. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, the alcohol was hidden very well, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these in a row and be pretty happy with that and I can't say that for a lot of Scotch Ales, it's for sure more drinkable than Scotty Karate and Dirty Bastard. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability and the balance they were both pretty good with the alcohol was hidden better than almost any other Scotch Ale I have tired. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it didn't look bad at all, but a little more head would have been appreciated, it wasn't that big of deal. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a good and drinkable Scotch Ale, it was nicely priced and it was pretty good for what it is, i can see this showing up in my fridge fairly often. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Scotch Ales, I think it's a good example of the style and one of the most drinkable. All in all I was happy with this beer and so far it's my favorite beer from Oskar Blues and it gives me hope that there's more beers from this brewery that I will like. Dirty Bastard is still my favorite Scotch Ale with Scotty Karate coming in close second, the flavors are much more intense in those beer but with the intense flavors comes less drinkability so it was nice to have a Scotch Ale that was on the other side of the spectrum and I feel like this one would be my third favorite of the style. Good job Oskar Blues, this is one quality Scotch Ale that I will be revisiting."

"12oz can. Deep clear ruby with a foamy mocha head. Rich ringing and a robust looking cascade of spotty lace. Smells of rich sweetness in the nose, with toffee, brown sugar, cocoa, a dash of fruit and some smoky accents. This is nice. The taste pretty much matches that, with a rich smoky sweetness on the palate that includes notes of caramel, cocoa and brown sugar. There is also a light herbal bitterness present that combines with the roast to help offset some of the sweetness here. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bubbly crispness that fills up the mouth. There is some warmth on the tail end of each sip but this is otherwise very smooth for 8%. Scotch Ales are admittedly not one of my favorite styles but this one made a believer out of me in this instance. This is just packed with flavor and very drinkable for the size. I won’t be ignoring this one on the shelf any longer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. It pours a deep amber color and has a light white head that quickly fades away. Lacing is minimal. As far as flavor goes, it is malty, toasty, and full of flavor. Hop bitterness is low and very subtle. Unlike some other scotch ales, this beer is very easy to drink and not overpowering on the smokiness or stong malt flavor of other scotch ales on the market. This is the type of beer I could enjoy any time of the year. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A: Pours a lively dark amber nightshade. Lacing quickly fades to a ring on the glass perimeter. S: roasted malt. T: BBQ sauce at the front transitions to crispy caramelized chicken skin with sesame oil, soy sauce, and horse barn smell. Burnt marshmallow and cherry cough syrup finish. Mild vanilla spice. This brew is stout and complex. This is the kind of beer I want after a long day of whitewater kayaking at flood levels. Nice balance overall- not too syrupy or carbonaceous, despite the fact that this beer takes the Maillard reaction to a whole new level."
""
"Overall: Very solid Scotch Ale, but could use a little more hops or smoke to combat the (albeit tasty) sweetness."
""
""
"Old Chub is the most commercially available of the Scott Ales currently. It is not the most harsh of all Scotch Ales (in terms of actual scotch taste), but it blends the English style ale very nicely with the scotch flavor. One of my favorite Oskar Blues options."
""
"O - Hits heavier than the 8% listed for me. I've had two out of the sixer I bought and both times they have sent me looking for my bed. If I can find a nightcapper like this that scales back the sweetness, it'll be the best lights out since Shawn Merriman stopped dancin..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oskar Blues hasn't failed me yet. Old Chub is a great beer. Not much like Founders Dirty Bastard at all, if you've had that ... I find that Dirty Bastard is more caramel-y. Old Chub is a lot of sweet, dark fruits, and some roasty bitterness near the end. Really a great beer. Oskar Blues keeps showing that it's possible to brew a great beer and put it into a can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I'm more of a stout drinker. But, this ranks up there with Founders Dirty Bastard. It would be better to bottle it, since I only tried this because of the reviews. Cans tend to make me shy away."

"A very solid beer that's satisfying and easy to drink. Nice color, sweet smells, lots of complex flavors, and a good solid mouthfeel. A really nice spiciness and peppery finish. Very easy to drink and doesn't seem like it's 8%. I enjoyed this very much and will have again. Oskar Blues continues to make some fine beers, and especially ones in the can. I'm really starting to like this style."
"O- A very enjoyable creamy dark beer. Really does remind me of a Guinness on steroids. Very similar flavor and mouthfeel, only much better."
""
"Extremely enjoyable."

"O - It is a flavorful beer. It gets better as it warms."
""

"Watch out! At 8.00% ABV, this Scotch Ale packs a Highland punch. I paid $9.95 for a six-pack. It's rare to experience such a pleasurable blend of taste and potency from a beer in this price range."

"it became too burdensome. ""Beer is good God is Great and people are crazy"". This is a great site, for the erudite and probably for fuzzy old men like me, but just enjoy beer.

"Pours brown with a ruby hue with over a finger of head that quickly dissipates. The nose is malty with a touch of caramel sweetness and a sourness that is hard to place. The body is thick and the taste is malty and sweet, but not overdone like some scotch ales. A very subtle smokiness is barely detectable, but present nonetheless. There is a touch of alcohol on the finish, but it is not harsh at all. One of the best scotch ales out there!"
""
"I'm no expert on this style, but this is one of the finest American-made Scotch Ales I have had. It has terrific body, feel, and rich malty flavor. That little bit of booze really pushes it over the top. Wonderful beer for those who love the malt. Someday I'd love to do a blind tasting of a few of these beers. I think this one would come out pretty strong."
""
"O: Decent Scottish ale. My beer was a little too cold and the flavors really didn’t come out until it warmed up a little."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My take: Caveat, I'm still looking for a wee heavy that I like. The smell is VERY interesting for the style, and the mouthfeel is quite nice. But the alcohol content seems to be a hindrance to the taste, whether it was intentional or unwitting inclusion of unsavory volatiles, I imagine that this would be better at 6.0%. Man, that sounds blasphemous..."
"Overall/Comments: I was very impressed by this beer. Aroma and flavor profile are excellent and complex. This beer is meant to be savored and enjoyed slow as evidenced by its full bodied filling nature. Seems like an excellent choice for a fall campfire beer!! Classified as a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy at 8% ABV. Consumed 12-18-12."
""
""
""
"O. Good beer. Not my favorite style, but I have to say this one of the best of the style. The other best of the style I think would have to be Dirty Bastard. Old Chub seems smoother, and less peaty than the Bastard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Never had a scotch ale but am enjoying this now. Leaves an interesting aftertaste which is different than anything I've tasted before. Not real strong but something I could drink a few of on a hot day. I'm currently drinking this from a can so I really can't look at the color but the rim is caramel color. Overall I'd like to drink this one again. Thanks."

""
"I rate this overall as a great beer. While it's not an everyday beer, it is great to have in the fridge. If you can get a hold of Oskar Blues beers, you owe it to yourself to check out Old Chub."
""
"O: Worth it in every way. Price, taste, availability; it handles it all. This beer is like a buddy you have from high school. You don't see it as often as you should, but damn do you love it when it comes around. I'll be buying more this weekend."

"O - Wow, wasn't expecting this out of a can. A very good scotch ale, well done. I recommend this one. Cheers!"
""
""
"O: I don't know if I could have more than a single can of this in a session - simply because it's meant to be savored rather than rapidly downed. Any beer that bears a passing resemblance to Schlenkerla's rauchbiers is a great thing, in my opinion. It strikes me as a fantastic 'cigar' beer, too."

"O- Great stuff, and proof that Oskar Blues and Sixpoint are on to something...(the cans)"

"An old favorite of mine, and a good reason to give canned beer due props. An absolutely wonderful, full-on malt dominant beer with a style-proper alcohol balance. An excellent beer in a convenient package: good for stuffing a few in a backpack or popping a can open and pouring a proper pint while watching football on TV."

"High scores overall for this one, especially considering the fact that it's canned. This may be a go-to brew from now on for cold weather camping/hiking trips. I'm bummed it took me this long to give it a try."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This pours a dark, reddish-orange color with a slight beige head. The aroma is mild but has hints of robust and grainy scents. The taste is pretty delicious as you take in a complex blend of malts, hops and yeast. The texture is just as smooth as the beer is flavorful. This brew is just as the description says: a great celebration of malts. Definitely give this one a try; I’m sure you won’t be disappointed."
"O- a good Scotch ale from OB... definitely holds its own within the style"
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent beer, very easy to drink and enjoy. Balanced well and plenty of flavor. Has the classic wee heavy flavor, with the added cherry flavor that works well. Very enjoyable, and worth the drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a good drink. Can see having again."
"Overall - Delicious Wee Heavy here. Very good balance. Incredibly drinkable."
""
"Notes: Decent beer. Hits the notes you'd expect for the style, but it doesn't really wow or stand out. Good but not great beer. I don't mind it in the fridge, especially for $10/6pack for an 8% Scotch Ale."
""
""
""

""
""
"Nice example of the style. Traditional and well executed. Will enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - easily drinkable, decadent. Overall a great beer."
""
"O: Scottish style is one of my favs. This one is complex. My favorite thing about this one is the underlying fruitiness that seems to play really well with the caramely malted taste. Very happy that OB has finally made it to Ohio."
""
""
"It goes down nice and easy but nothing particularly amazing about the mouthfeel. I'd like it if it were a little less carbonated."
""
""
"Thicker than I expected to the nose, mouth and tongue this was dominated by a roasty meatiness and some sweetness which leads to a fluttering trace of sharp light soya. a bit sappy too but the sugar cane backbone didn't quite hold it all up. Good though ,not legendary but very very grateful for Marty and Andrea for supplying this so I could share."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A good showing with a huge lacking the mouthfeel department. I an interested to try the oaked and vanilla versions of this one. I feel the improvement would be immense."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not as adept in cask ales as some other styles, but this is tasty. I'm a big fan of Oskar Blues so I had to try this one. In fact, this makes me want to venture out and try more casked ales. I can't speak for other similar beers but I like the complexity of this one. The taste and smell seemed to change a bit from start to finish."
""
"O – This is a really nice Scotch Ale. It has tons of sweet, rich malt, perfect for the style. The hot smoke and alcohol at the finish are nice complements to the malty sweetness that opens the taste. Furthermore, it is extremely drinkable for a beer of this magnitude and body with 8% ABV. Cheers, Oskar Blues!"
""
""
""
"O: it’s a decent brew, just really wish there was more of a body to it. Its just too light of a brew for me to really get excited about."
""
""
"good looks!"
""
""
""
"Overall - Good representation of the Scotch ale style. Strong, aggressive flavor and mouthfeel, but stays within an acceptable limit. I'd love to try it out of the can some day."
""
"Really good scotch ale, one of the best I've had. Up there with Skullsplitter. I bought a 6-pack of these and I will enjoy every last drop."
""
""
""
""
"overall another keeper from oskar blues - nothing otherworldly but definitely a very nice scotch ale, tasty and enjoyable. will purchase again."
"Flavor close to the nose, with a modest hop bitterness on the back end. Again, a bit of booze, lots of bready, chewy malt, medium toffee and caramel sweetness that dries up a bit (but not completely) in the finish. Body is medium full and the feel is smooth and rich. Carbonation is medium to slightly restrained allowing for easy drinking. Tasty but somewhat simple; malt, malt, and more malt."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic beer. I'm not a huge fan of Scotch Ales but this beer is drinkable and definitely a repeat. Although repeating it more than twice in one sitting is slightly risky with the ABV %."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An excellent beer in one of my least favorite styles. Oh, and it ages extremely well! 15 months old and its damn tatsy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a beautiful dark brown that, in the right light, has an almost reddish mahogany hue about it. There's not much in the nose on this one—a little alcohol and hint of sweet malt—but the flavor is jammed with syrup caramel malt, booze, and a little smoke. The beer has a medium body; The mouthfeel is smooth and buttery but doesn't hang around very long but the beer has a pleasant finish: It warms inside our chest, making us long for the fall days when we might actually need the few extra degrees of body heat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Super impressed especially coming from a canned beer. If you took an excellent winter warmer and mixed it with a supreme doppelbock you would have yourself an Old Chub."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. At 8% abv the alchol is hidden very well. Great beer to have when relaxing and want something to sip on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I rank this one up there with Three Floyds Robert the Bruce and Founders Dirty Bastard. At 8% abv it's well above Robert the Bruce and just a little bit under Dirty Bastard, but maybe more drinkable than both. The alcohol is well hidden behind the rich, robust, smokey, caramel malty goodness that is the Old Chub. I'd recommend this to anyone. Even if it is not your favorite style it is hard to say anything bad about Old Chub. I love this beer and am so glad Oskar Blues came to Chicago!"

"O - This is a very good wee heavy, and my go-to for one of my very favorite styles. From the many scotch ales I've tried, it seems that many brewmasters have trouble balancing such a malt-heavy beer so as to make it drinkable, and this has drinkability in spades, even with the fairly high ABV. One of the very best that doesn't have the benefit of barrel aging."
""
""
"O: This terrific brew comes from a can - amazing! An absolutely solid beer that never disappoints. A go-to Scotch Ale for me."

"O: This scotch ale is quite good and a fine example of the style. The nose could have been better, but this was quite enjoyable overall."

"I really like this beer! It is a little dangerous because of it's smooth nature and high alcohol content. Appearance is dark brown with a little mahogany red. Smell is a little lacking because of the lack of hops, but very warm and nice. Taste is a little smoky/ sweet with a nice coffee and caramel note. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little thicker than most. Overall this beer adds up to more than the sum of it's parts. It is subtle and smooth like a warming winter beer and yet I am loving it right now in a Georgia summer. That is hard to do!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Drinkability: Due to the high ABV, I find that this is a sipping and savoring beer, with one being enough. What I find odd about this beer is that each can is different. Some cans are ""wow!"" and others are not quite the same. I almost wonder if it is some sort of temperature issue, but I've tried to keep the cans all at the same temperature before pouring. What I describe is usually always there, but the flavors that pop out are strong in one can and weaker in another. The aroma is consistent though - go figure. So not highly drinkable, but good. Not sure if I'd go out of my way to get it again based upon this can, but maybe the next can will have me crazy about it again. Interesting and worth trying though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Overall a great beer for those who enjoy Scotch and Brown Ales. However, some might be hesitant to spend top-shelf money on a 6 pack of cans."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied. It's pretty smooth on the tongue and fuller on the swallow. Overall, this is one of the best Scotch Ales I've ever had. I think it's easily better than, say, Founders Dirty Bastard. Moreover, I find this to be the best beer that Oskar Blues produces."
""
"Overall: Finally an American brewery gets this style right!! I was skeptical of buying beer in a can, but everyone who knows good beer kept telling me to try this and I am glad I did. Smooth and silky and so easy to drink at 8% This is how a Scotch Ale should be!! I agree with the bros. to put this one in a glass and enjoy. Cheers!!"
""
""
"Overall: Not really familiar with scottish ales, but this one is good. Will have to get more accustomed to these in the colder months instead of steamy July."
"O: This beer is full on malt with little else to show for it. And for a guy whom admittedly enjoys the hops over everything else, this was a tough beer to enjoy."
"Overall: Well put together beer that, for people who aren't too familiar with a scotch ale this definitely shouldn't be your first. Once you are used to it, or at least a real beer drinker you will not forget. Salud!"

"One of my new favorite Scotch/Wee's after being introduced to it by a friend. Not sure if I want to share this six-pack with him now however. This one is mine to drink!"
""
"12 oz can. Pours dark amber with a long lasting tanned head. Nose is of caramel, peat, and hints of sourness, piney hops and chocolate. Body is full and smooth. Taste is caramel, chocolate, alcohol, earthy hops and brown sugar. Finish is long, tangy and dry. Nice brew to sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: I tried a more recent batch of this beer and the diacetyl problem seems to have been fixed (or was it merely a fresher batch I sampled with the diacetyl not having the time/opportunity to form??) The horrendous experience of the first six pack makes me loathe to change my review, but I'm convinced that this beer **does** seem to be a crap shoot--if you get lucky and get a hold of a fresh/well-handled version of this beer it *can** be quite good."
""
""
""
"Poured from glorious can into tulip. This nearly dark brown bear had a fine creamy almond-colored head of medium duration. The nose was a faint caramel chocolate that was also evident in the flavor although i felt there was licorice there as well. The pallet feel was like velvet with little hang. I'll have another."
""
""
"Serving type: can"
"O: an excellent ale - had some strong ale qualities at a lower temperature, but on the warming really defined itself as a scotch style ale - great flavor and aroma profile"
"O: Pretty good drinkability. ABV is somewhat hidden. A very good all around scotch ale. One of the best in the style I've had."
""
"Overall – One fantastic and pretty easy drinking beer. It has a nice smooth flavor yet still is able to pack a punch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Picked this up in Buffalo. Pours a dark chestnut brown with creamy white head. Tastes slightly sweet with some smoke lingering, and a caramal like malty finish. Mouthfeel is good and there is no hint of the 8% alc what so ever.I've had very few scottish ales, but this is a decent beer overall."
""
""
"O/D - Too smokey for my taste. Can see the potential but sadly it was masked by the smoked element. Alright, just held back."
""
""
""
"I've always believed this brew is best ICE cold... But, wanted to rate it as it should be served. There's tons of noticeable alcohol, but it's placed nicely beneath the heavy malt. A very nice go-to brew. Recommended."
"The taste is big as well. Really over the top, which I like. It does get tiring after one or two though. By far the best scotch ale I have had to date."
""
"O- Solid, definitely recommend"
""
""
"Looking for a delicious malty beer? Check it out."
""

"O: A great scotch ale. Tasty on the slopes or off."
"On-tap at the Tasty Weasel. I think this is the best American brewed version of this style. Dark brown with a ruby edge when held to the light. Creamy ecru foam sits on top firmly and never leaves. Thick caramel and toffee on a base of shortbread and toast. A hint of char adds depth along with a fleeting earthy hop flavor. Balanced on the finsih leaving Old Chub more drinkable than the overly sweet examples out there. This one is loaded with big flavors but manages to stay smooth from start to swallow."
""
"O-A nice scotch ale but at the end of the day it is a little thin, adding a touch more bitterness/grassy hops would made this a perfect brew."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is ok- I definitely think it could use more carbonation. Medium full body with light, soft carbonation. Not particularly quaffable, but a decent beer. I've had better scotch ales and if I'm in the mood for one I don't think I'll turn to Old Chub."
""
"Pour a thick deep brown, with a substantial tan head. Smells sweet with caramel notes. The taste similar, sweet with notes of chocolate and caramel. A very excellent representation of the style. A beer that's 8% ABV, only $10 for a six pack, tastes this good AND I can take it to the beach? Count me in."
"This was the right price at a little dive bar, so I thought I'd give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised with it's drinkability: it's still sweet and still very much a Scottish ale but the sweetness isn't searing and the mouthfeel's nice, moderate, clean, and doesn't mask the underlying flavours."

"Scotch are not my favorite style; they tend to be too sweet for my taste, but this one is a nice take on the style. Sweet with a nice boozy finish to round out the sweetness so as not to be too cloying."

"This may be the best canned beer i've had the pleasure of tasting. This makes me want to get the required thistle glass to enjoy it properly. Rich and sweet, this beer does almost everything well and would be ideal for hiking or just to relax with at the end of the day. I did't expect this to be near this good - will purchase a six if I can find it again at World Market."

"O- Not a bad beer by any means, but nothing really stands out that would make me want to pursue this again."
""

"O - For right now I'm a bit underwhelmed by this. Wont write it off until I have a fresh one but feel a significant lake of punch in this one. Hmmmm"

"O: a very solid scotch ale... In really enjoy the flavor profile and the drink ability.... A very solid brew from Oskar blues."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a go to beer from Oskar Blues. Normally is reasonably priced even at the bar. I like a little more carmel malt in my scotch ales."
""
"Beautiful deep red in body with off-white head. Aroma of light raisins, chocolate, toasty grains, and light cinnamon. Starts off cinnamon, chocolate toast, and then evolves into a dark fruit, tangy sweetness with some booze lingering on the palate. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Looks great, smells great, tastes good."
""
""
"It is not the best scotch ale I have ever had but besides Scotty Karate I would say it is second. The only thing that could make this better is a stronger nose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Given the availability and quality of this beer, it'll be hard to stay away from it in the future. The on draught version takes it to another level."
"Review from 6/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark red-orange amber. Minimal head and no lacing. Aroma of caramel and sweet malt, almost a cola component; light aroma. Taste starts with dry caramel malt and dark fruit, almost a whiskey like flavor which may be from smoked malts, and molasses component. Flavors are a bit understated and even with all these components seem simple and not too complex. Well integrated. A pleasant scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasty malt and some caramel/toffee aromas. Taste is of toasty malt, caramel, and some slight smokey flavors. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some pretty nice flavors. I am really digging the slight smoke I am getting after each sip."
"This is a good beer for the style, but this is not one of my favorite styles. This is the last one of these out of a case I bought and I am enjoying this one more, but I am so much more likely to be reaching for so many different styles of beer. It is a Scotch Ale well pulled off, but this beeradvocates tastes lie elsewhere."
""
"A very big and bold beer in a can, indeed. I highly recommend giving this one a try at least once in a lifetime."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is medium bodied and smooth as you could ask for. It's a little sticky, especially on the back of the tongue and throat, and the carbonation doesn't make a big deal of itself."
""
""
"O - Enjoyable Scotch ale that I would definitely have again. Sweet, but it doesn't get in the way."
""
""
""
""
"O: Although I'm more of a hop-head myself, I can appreciate a good malty beer. I love scotch ales, and this is a solid example of a great scotch ale. I highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Certainly drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than a couple in a sitting. As I said, I'm not super familiar with the style, but based on this am interested to investigate further. Check it out if it's available in your area."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty & well made. I would prefer slightly less alcohol but still enjoyed it"
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is one delicious sipper. The body is smooth and coating but quickly becomes quite sticky as the beer warms. The carbonation isn't overly noticeable, which allows the body to present the flavors very well."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a tumbler pint, the beer is a crystal clear, dark, blood-ruby coloring that is vibrant and lovely. A thin, filmy, sparse covering over the surface of the brew, with a slick, clear looking cling along the glass. The nose is super malty and rich, with a boozey undertone and a roasted overtone. Flavors are bold and rich on a full, robust body. Roasted, tangy sweet molasses and toffee flavors blended amazingly into a velvety, creamy body. The aftertaste is super-boozey, with a caramel rich maltiness on a bold, rich, full body. The finish is smooth and rich, with a slight cloying feel that is cleaned up by the booze. Delicious representation of the Wee Heavy style."

"Overall this beer is amazing in my opinion. Will definitely be buying this one again and thats rare for me! The way the flavors and mouthfeel compliment each other is its strong point. Its everything you'd expect from an american craft beer companies take on a wee heavy/scotch ale x10. That may be a little much for some people but I definitely enjoyed it."
""
"Poured from can to pint glass while at Moe's in Lionshead (Vail). The beer pours a slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger off-white head with some retention and lacing. The aroma is a mix of sweetness from caramal malts and roasted character. The high abv is also prevalent. The flavor is dominated by strong malt character. Roasty flavors but mostly a malt sweetness. The sweetness is very overpowering. Finishes sweet with lingering mild bitterness and a reminder of the alcohol. Not pleasant, really. Full bodied and oily in character. Rather average. Overall, I remember enjoying this beer a lot more than this can. I found it hot and thick in sweetness, too much for the style to make it really enjoyable."
""
"O: This is just a great beer. It is easy to drink for a beer that is 8%. The flavors just bust on my palate and the beer never really gets old. I buy this beer all the time and I will gladly buy it again."
"It pours a reddish brown with a light brown one finger head. There wasn't any lacing, though I don't usually see lacing with most beers at that bar - might be something they clean with. It smells fruity like raisins and somewhat like black cherries. It tastes like dark fruit - dates, raisins, cherries - with a bready malt backbone and an almost peanut butter tinge to it. It's got a full mouthfeel, low carbonation, smooth but not so creamy. Overall, I can't keep my hands off this beer. At 8%, it's pretty dangerous."
""
"O- It's alright, but as it is the third beer I've had from Oskar Blues, I'm not tremendously impressed with their stuff so far. Too bad, as I was looking forward to trying more."
""
"Appearance pours a very dark brown with a thinner dissipating head leaving scant lace. Smell of sweet malt and alchoholic chocolates in raisin wine. Taste has the sweet malt, raisins and a slight smoked peat note with alchohol to fallow. Mouthfeel is medium/full with good carbonation. A nice full enjoyable Scotch ale."
""
""
"D/O - a very filling beer. Overall, the second excellent Scottish Ive sampled in the past few days. Not the sexiest of all styles, but a very well done brew for the style."

"O: Overall a great beer that shows really great malt depth. I normally drink fairly hop forward beers so this is a nice contrast. Scotch Ale is a style I couldn't drink too regularly but once in a while it's great. Another good beer from OB."
"D: Considering the ABV, this goes down pretty easy. At the same time, the sweetness would make it hard to drink multiple cans in one night. Good, but not exceptional in my opinion."

"O - Okay, tastes a little bit better than flat Cherry Cola, least favorite scotch ale I have had."

"Overall excellent scotch ale, I love how it's almost like an heavier version than most. A great sipper that I could drink more than one in a sitting. I recommend."
"O- Not bad, but I like Robert the Bruce a bit more."
"Finished clean an kind slick on the tongue. Medium bodied with minimal carbonation making this ale easy to drink. So watch yourself. Other than that the best canned (but do not drink out of the can, Scotch ale!!!"

"O - A very drinkable Scottish Ale. It is as unique as they come but also quite delicious. Certainly a fine example of the style and one that should be tried by any Scottish Ale fan."
"Very bold flavor, with malts and barley notes highly present. Pours with a small amount of foam head, but dissapates quickly. The color is very dark brown and prefer it well chilled. One of my favorite ales I have found because of the very bold but yet mild taste it has. The ale is a very fine example of what a dark ale should be."
"poured into snifter, just about opaque and black. Stout-like with a red tinge around edges. Deep sweetness on the nose, black cherry if you will, other dark fruit, just a tad of caramel latte and cream. For taste, a bitter sweet burntness, a slight booziness, lots of caramel malt. Coats the palate, goes down smooth and creamy. I almost grabbed ten fidy until I saw this, and being a scotch ale fan, had to try it at this price. Doesn't disappoint but I prefer certain others."
""
"I can't get this stuff in Ohio, so it looks like regular trips to PA are in order. Definitely a great sipping beer with amazing complexity."

"D - Not bad. I enjoyed this beer a lot. I love the whole microcan movement and pay homage to Oskar Blues as one of the founders. A really nice scottish ale. I will certainly have it again sometime."
"pours a really dark brown with very little head. exactly how i want and expect my scotch ale to look. smells unremarkable except for a nice peat/alcohol aroma wafting from the glass, more organic mattery than smokey, but alluring. taste is strong for one thing, really robust malt profile and alcohol backup. woody and slightly fruity, rich and mellow. this is a fine ale indeed, one of oskar blues best. mouthfeel is just right, a little undercarbonated and thick, but thats all okay in this style. could imagine this one going off the charts after a few months in a bourbon barrel. solid solid beer, but a tough session"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is something I definitely prefer over bourbon aged beers. I know they are not the same thing, but they have a similar feel. This is something definitely worth trying."
""
""
"O) An average Wee Heavy. Not anything outstanding."
""
""
"M/O - Thick, full bodied, and sticky sweet. No real alcohol burn despite the abv. Very low (bordering on too low) carbonation. Nevertheless this was an excellent scotch ale, and hands down the best offering to date I have had from Oscar Blues."
""

"Although this is not my favorite style I found this well suited as nightcap beer and a good change up from APA/IPA style"

"O-I love this beer, usually packed in the trunk of my car at all times for ski season...this beer has hops, is smokey, chocolatey, biscuity, deliciousy...scotch ales are about the booze and at 8% this beer sneaks up on you...perfect for cool winter nights or hot tubing (thanks to the can)"
"Overall this is better than I expected. I'm not a huge fan of caramelly, malty beers but this one hit the sweet spot."
""
"O: Not a bad wee heavy, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. I still have another 5 cans in the fridge, and I don't imagine I'll be powering through them any time soon."

"This comes to me in a pint glass, dark reddish brown with no real head. However, as I drink this and create room, I'm able swirl a head in, and generate a nice, brown head. The nose is pretty excellent. Rich and complex with toffee, some chocolate, dark caramel and a faint hop character, this is excellent. Especially as it warms up, the malt character shines. The yeast isn't particularly expressive here, this is all about the malt. And that's what the palate demonstrates too. Opening full in body with a soft, creamy carbonation, this beer has a beautiful blend of light smoke, dark caramel, chocolate and toffee. The milk chocolate in particular works nicely with the caramel and toffee. Mildly sweet on the finish, but with enough of dark caramel bitterness, a firming hop bitterness and a touch of burnt sugar as well, this is a thoroughly enjoyable beer. As such, a better beer than the barrel aged version."

"O- Holy shit. A Scotch ale I actually like! Every other one I've had before this (CCB's Big Sound, Sam Adams' Scotch Ale to name a couple) have been gross and nearly undrinkable. I could definitely see myself knocking back a few of these."

"This is a robust dark ale that reminds me of Barleywine. The alcohol content can sneak up on you after a few, not such a bad thing. There is essentially no head to this beer. The color is quite dark, almost black with some red tones. It is a bit sweet for my liking, but this probably makes it easier to drink more than one. My first impression of this beer wasn't a good one, however that was on a hot day tailgating. This is not a beach beer. I have come to appreciate more though as the weather has cooled. It is the perfect camping beer. I assume that is why it says pack it in pack it out on the can. Anyway I would give this beer a B overall. I will definitely drink it again."

"O: Delicious and very drinkable."
"O - I wasn't overwhelmed by Old Chubb. It's bitterness is pervasive and a bit heavy. It's a pleasant drink but not the best in class"
"O: Highly drinkable."
"Overall: Really solid brew from Oskar Blues. A bit on the sweeter side vs. something like Dirty Bastard, but its a great after dinner beer. Tasty stuff."
"This is a nice change of pace beer, but the style is a little on dimensional for my taste."
"O - Deep, robust, smooth, clean, big, perfect. Always love a Chub."
"O: Good. Very good. Especially in a can. But not quite as good as it could be. Kudos to Oskar!"
"Pours a nice deep reddish-brown. Small head sticks around, light alcohol feet. Smells of malt and dark candied fruit. Taste follows nose. Medium body, very lightly creamy mouthfeel. Solid brew, decent price and love the can. Would not seek out like a lost treasure, but would definitely buy again."
"This is a magnificent colder weather beer for me. From a guy who loves his IPAs, this is a great malty change of pace. One if the better examples of the style to me, less purely sweet and nicely complex."
"O: A strong, satisfying ale. Great tasting and full flavored, could definitely drink on one or two of these especially on a cold evening."
"Excellent, very smooth, alcohol low and huge malty flavors. Exactly what i want in a scottish beer."
"O - This is just a great beer. I was introduced to this in college and have suggested it to so many people looking to explore the craft world. It is accessible to the non-craft drinker due to its sweetness and unpredictable nature, yet complex enough to leave anyone to their senses. Enjoyed many times, and I hope that it will be available for years to come."
"Taste is much like the smell, smooth and a bit thin with low carbonation. It's not an aggressive ale and gets much better as it warms up a bit. Leaves a lingering, slightly astringent aftertaste."
"This is the least sweet scotch ale I've ever had. I find it very strange. The smell was earthy and metallic. The taste is distinctly not sweet for a scotch ale. An astringent taste of hops is also present. Only very light, but it seems the bitterness is not primarily of roasted malts or so it seems to me. The mouthfeel is very thick. It even seems somewhat oily. The lack of sweetness is so striking considering how cloying most examples of the style are. It's hard for me to decide if I like it since it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm going to have to go with no, it's not very good. It's not sweet enough. I want my Scotch ale to be sweet, not a dry maltiness."
"Drink: Like many sweet and malty beers, it's very drinkable, but also like many sweet and malty beers, high abv makes it dangerous. Enjoy this as you would a fine single malt - one that you happen to have a full glass of!"
"Old Chub is a dark brown color that's quite appealing, but nothing special. It has a toffee like smell, with some sweetness. The taste is a pleasant strong malt with hints of caramel that you can feel all the way to the stomach. Goes fantastic with heavier meals such as a burger or pork chop, and is of course a great sipper."
"Well, this puts the 'Scotch' in Scotch Ale, it does, without going overboard with all that Islay wankery. Sweet? Aye. Cloying? Nae. The wood, smoke, peat, and booze, all in their relatively minute amounts, contribute to the balance in this offering, and weirdly make it all work. Chubalicious!"
"So, I have to sip. No big deal."
"O: Great beer that would go well with a rich dinner. I would probably tire after about two beers which is probably good for as high as the alcohol content is. Would easily overwhelm a lighter food dish that would accompany it."
"This beer is great strait from the can. It has a nice thick mouthfeel, kind of sticks to the tongue and throat with a nice malty sweetness. The smell does nothing for the beer, it is very light, made me not expect much from this beer. But then it hits your mouth and wow, that malty sweetness is very balanced, with slight boozy overtones, but they fit the flavor profile nicely. This has to be one of the best beers I have ever poured from a can."
"O- I really enjoyed this one. I thought it was very solid."
"Overall, this may be the single best beer I've ever had from a can, and the lovely fruit esters--especially the surprising cherry tones--that dance on the tongue are delicious, and left me craving more. As a whole the beer is quite well balanced, and the flavors finely nuanced and delicately pronounced. Even better, the beer did not weaken with subsequent sips, maintaining its deliciousness throughout the can. Excellent fare, and highly recommended."
"Overall: I was very pleased with the smoothness of the beer. Especially with the amount of alcohol scent and content. Cheers."
"Dark brownish red with with a tan head that dissipated VERY quickly. No lacing on the glass. Aroma was not as strong as I expected, but I noticed malts and molasses. As typical in the style, hops are subtle. Flavor of dark roasted malts, caramel, smoke, and whiskey-like alcohol. Medium bodied with an effervescent mouth feel. It finished with a lingering taste of sweet smoky malts and tobacco."
"O: Very simple scotch ale with lots of sweets, hold onto these for at least a year before drinking."
"Mouthfeel - Beer has a slickness to it that really give it great drinkability for a malt forward beer, while still being full flavored and not watery. Great drinking even from the can."
"O: A really strong example of the Scotch style, and you couldn't ask for better beer from a can."
"Mouthfeel was a little flat. I think a little more head would have added to the mouthfeel and softened the sweet aroma. There wasn't much of a hoppy taste which is part of the style I believe."
"Overall, I think I'd buy this again."
"Great Scotch Ale that's insanely drinkable."
"Overall: Quite a different interpretation of the Scottish ale IMO. Complex brew that surprised me a bit. Was ok, but not grade A in my honest opinion."
"It's dark, rough, and extremely malty. It has became not only my favorite scotch ale, but my favorite beer overall."
"drinkability: superb.... a new fav of mine. I could have this a few more times."
"This poured out as a deep reddish copper color with a thick foamy white head on top. The clarity of the beer was nice. The smell of the beer was earthy, a little smokey and kind of sweet like caramel. The taste was just about the same, there was a nice amount of sweet malts in this brew and just a touch of some earthy spice in there too. The mouthfeel was creamy and had a medium body to it. Overall this is a really nice Scotch Ale. I would recommend this one to friends how haven't tried it before. Really nice stuff."
"0: I'm not a big scottish style ale drinker, but this one could be addictive... Good buy!"
"Overall - This is a fine tasting, complex beer. If it looked better with more of a quality head I think it could be a world class wee heavy. Its extremely good though and highly recommend."
"Overall, very nice beer. Just like Dale's Pale Ale."
"The earth tones of Old Chub are overwhelming. This is one awesome beer."
"O: This beer goes perfectly while sipping rye or a highland Scotch. This is a Killians for a beer geek."
"O - very good for style, and one of the very few choices of this style available in a can. The wee bit of extra hops in the mix was appreciated. Surprise: went well with a sweet pastry."
"O: A decent example of the style. I must admit, this is the first time pouring this beer out, and I have to say I actually prefer it much more drank straight from the can. Not sure what that says about the beer...."
"O - Really nice in my opinion. Very drinkable with a great taste and mouthfeel. Winner here all the way. Nice."
"Notes: A little too estery for my taste. The fruitiness is a bit too forward. I would like it better if the malt tastes had a chance to operate without the fruity distractions. The smoked malt tastes also take on more of that rauchbier campfire character rather than that peaty smokiness I look for in the style. A solid brew, but not the best out there."
"O-"
"O- I really like this beer. One of favorite wee heavys to date, for sure."
"Appropriately robust malty nose full of toffee, caramel and sweet chocolate. A hint of smoke so small that it goes undetected until it warms for a bit. Thickish sticky body with leafy, earthy hops and a touch of tobacco cutting through the sweetness. Smoke is still nothing but a hint; a dash more would really take this to the next level. Still quite tasty, with enough carbonation and bitterness to keep things moving along pretty well. A few tweaks away from the next level, but an easy recommendation."
"one of the first canned craft beers ive had and it was great"
"This is an easy beer to drink and has all of the makings of a great scotch ale, but does not break through in the individual components. I also think this is what makes it more sessionable to me."
"This was a wonderful beer. It certainly held up to the other high quality offerings from Oskar Blues. It even kind of reminded me of a Dogfish Head Raison D'etre, but without the alcohol burn. I can’t wait to have one after ageing for a year or two."
"This is not the most amazing Wee Heavy ever. In fact, the issue for me is that it is more akin to a Doppelbock than a Wee Heavy with all the bready melanoidins going on. The peat is a nice touch but it doesn't all come together for me."
"The beer poured a nice dark caramel ruby color. Off white/tan head. The head stuck around for the entire duration of the beer which was an added bonus. Smell was very malty and sweet- sugary. Taste was beautiful. Malt bomb here. Candy, booze, fruits...some grainy aspects. Awesome beer. Such a treat."
"Overall – The alcohol was well hidden and the beer had a really great balance. I'm not a huge fan of this style of beer but this was definitely one of the better ones that I've had."
"D/O- First Oskar Blues reviewed and I have to say I was a tad underwhelmed. One of my new(er)-found favorite styles, this one falls into the second tier. Thanks for the go MammothBrew!"
"D - relatively inexpensive at my favorite store for under $2 per can in a mix and match 6er. this is a great Friday night beer to go along with a burger"
"O- Really good it has a lot of flavors, it's a sipping brew though."
"O- not really my style, however it has an interesting flavor, so worth a try"
"overall, good beer but at the price I will pursue others."
"This is another Scotch ale I enjoy and yet another Oskar Blues beer that impresses."
"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, slightly prickly and sticky on the tongue. I usually like Oskar Blues, but this seemed a bit strange to me, although the alcohol was masked well for the style."
"A satisfying wee heavy though I would give the edge to Skullsplitter or Old Dirty Bastard."
"D - This beer concludes my Craft-in-a-Can Series for now. I really liked this beer. Nicely balanced, yet very complex flavors lie underneath. I will surely revisit this one in the near future."
"Very rich and full flavored. They do a good job of making it taste older than it is. Stale but very full if that makes any sense. A great beer to sip slow."
"This pours a dark brown with auburn tones under light and thin light brown head. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, molasses, and licorice. The flavor begins with dark chocolate followed by anise and molasses with a bit of brandy in the finish, strange. It has a full mouthfeel with some alcohol warmth. Oskar Blues Old Chub,while a good example of the style, is a so-so beer. Not recommended."
"Dr: Amazing for a canned beer. Well priced, high ABV, and great quality. Worth a try for any beer advocate."
"Pours a dark amber with slight head and no lacing. Dark malt with caramel overtones. little hops, lots of roasted malt, slight sweetness, and very smooth. Drinks really smooth for an 8% beer. Very good, and great change of pace from the more common ales."
"Pours a very dark red. Smells of big sweet malt flavor, plus loads of caramel and a touch of vanilla. A nice sweetness to it. Loads of malt. I catch a ton of vanilla and some caramel as well. Caramel was bigger on the nose than in the taste. Loving this beer. Creamy mouthfeel. Slightly carbonated. This is the first scottish ale I have enjoyed. I'm usually not huge on the style, but this is nice. Looking forward to my next trip to ohio to stock up on oskar blues beers."
"overall- a sold dark beer, it definitely embodies a scotch ale. best part was the smell! first oskar blue beer I've had."
"O: Great malt character and surprising drinkability."
"Overall--A great change of pace, to be sure. Rich but easy to drink, this pretty much hits the nail on the head. At least once in a while."
"O: Kickass. Go-to canned beer."
"Overall, this was pretty damn good. I love the feel."
"O- This is a nice brew, and recommended if you haven't tried it yet. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit."
"My second Oskar Blues beer and like their lineup so far."
"Will be revisiting this time & time again, definitely a standout Wee Heavy!"
"O: reminds me of my own scotch ale... yummy."
"Overall, this is a good beer. Not the best scotch ale I've had, but a really solid one. Goes down way too easily. Very smooth for an 8% abv. Would drink this again no problem."
"Overall a great representation of the style, but could use a little more umph in the flavor department. Still overall a very very good beer"
"O: First scotch ale, and it is a good one. I have been waiting for a while to try this. For the price it can't be beat."
"O Not blown out of the water but a nice beer. I'd get it again."
"This was a lot less bold and complex than I expected and wanted. However, it was pretty darned drinkable and I won't mind drinking one again."
"D- This is a really nice beer both for the style and in general. It proves that canned beers can be awesome and was reasonably priced (I bought the single can for a buck fifty). I see myself buying this again for sure and it seems like it would go well with lots of meats and desserts or as a nice sipper alone."
"This is a solid beer offering in a can and again another beer that I wish I could get here in Ohio!"
"Not my favorite, but it just might not be my preference as it gets good ratings by everyone else. I guess I prefer beers with a little more hop character."
"The color is dark brown, pretty good amber head which nice retention. The smell is malty caramel, not very strong but good. This is the 5th of the 6 pack I've tried this week and each one taste better, I guess I know what to expect now. No real bitterness (which I usually prefer), there is a malty sweet flavor, the higher abv is almost completely hidden. The mouth feel is good, medium thickness. Overall a good beer, which is starting to grow on me. (Normally this malty of a beer is a turn off for me). I'm much more in love with their canned Stouts though."
"6. Overall this is a great beer and would defiantly buy in the future. I would like to thank my buddy for leaving this over in the fridge and not taking it home. I would have a hard time leaving this beer somewhere. I am putting this on the homebrew list in the near future."
"D/O: This beer is simplistic for a Scottish ale or wee heavy, but clean, likely able to pass for an average doppelbock. It would benefit from an additional layer of earthiness, wood, or fruit/vegetable complexity to add interest and make it more ale-like."
"O - Overall very good. An accessible yet complex scotch ale. Drinkable, tasty, and filling."
"Not a session beer. Goes down real heavy. I bought this beer to drink on a somewhat hot summer weekend for tailgaiting purposes, and it really was just too strong. I feel like I made the wrong choice for what I wanted it for. A really strong taste up front, which is not a good idea on hot summer days. The ABV feels and tastes more than 8.00%. I've had other beers that are a higher ABV, that are much more drinkable."
"O- A good beer but there are better Scotch Ales for sure (Highway 78 comes to mind). Very drinkable even though it is kind of sweet. Goes down easy and not boozy at all"
"O- Overall this is a highly enjoyable scotch ale. I don't think it's the best out there but it's certainly worthy, and I'm glad I found a six pack."
"O - The creamyness of this brew is really nice, pretty good taste too. If I was more of a dark ale guy this is a really nice go to, definitly a good option if I'm with someone who prefers scotch/stout brews."
"Overall I still remember why I come back to this beer, it's just a simple solid, easy drinking version of this style to me."
"HV"
"Nice American take on a Scotch ale. Enjoyable, but also rather pricey."
"Overall a flavorful and tasty beer. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall its not bad, but seems to be a one trick pony, just a big blast of caramel malts and not much else."
"Definitely worth a try. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a wonderful beer. Another great one from Oscar Blues. If you like Scotch ales, I think you'll like this one."
"O: Pretty good, up near the top for me so far in the style, but not my favorite. Not overly complex, but well done. On the filling side, a definite slow sipper."
"This pours very dark brown with heavy tan head and little lacing/retention. I smell a lot of malt, sugar and booze. The taste is toasty and sweet, but not overpowering. I am impressed with the mouthfeel. I was expecting more chew-spit, but this is actually rather medium and drinkable. This has a mild bitter, hoppy aftertaste that adds to the complexity. This isn’t a style that I love, but this beer is a solid representation for sure."
"Fairly light mouthfeel that is very drinkable and has nearly no notice of the alcohol. Very good offering."
"O: This goes down easily but unfortunately, does not have the scotch flavors I've come to expect in wee heavies."
"Overall Drinkability - Great beer. Strong characters with great balance and no off flavors really makes this beer shine. Nothing overpowering, even though there is plenty of strong malt, hop and alcohol characters."
"Two inch pillowy off white head from an aggresive pour. Coca-cola hue with just a touch of redness and a faint amount of small fine bubbles rising to the top when held up to light. The smell is supry malt sweetness with just a touch of hops/chocolate and just a slight bit of soy sauce. Some sweet bananna at termination. Claerly malt forward. The taste is similiar. Heavy bodied mouthfeel with loads of malt, some hops, soysauce and chocolate at the finish. Overall a good beer, but not something i wo Alcohol not well masked. would purchase again at this time."
"O- a nice scotch ale ,tasty ,malty,hops.it was good"
"Overall-Great first impression from a scotch ale. Heavy Malts and nice sweetness. Could sip on a 6 pack of these on a sunday while watching sports very often."
"Kind of like a good brown ale with smoke added, with pretty much no hops at all. Hard to believe how smooth this one is for its ABV. Scotch Ales haven't always been my favorite but this is very, very good."
"Overall, a pretty regular scotch ale, but I found some unique flavors in this one. It was also pretty intense flavor wise."
"Finish: Smooth, clean, and sweet. Extremely drinkable. Its everything a Scotch Ale should be."
"O: I'm very impressed with this beer. I've been weary of it for a few years, as I had it back a few years, and it was not my ticket, but this is really good. Oh, how the palate changes."
"I suspect many overrate this because it is in a CAN and you can't help but be surprised by the quality coming in a can. But, put it in a bottle and you have a good example that doesn't exceed expectations."
"O: Not a big fan. The nose is pretty simple and it's very hard to pick out anything of note and the taste is very lackluster and one dimensional. I hope all scotch ales aren't like this."
"O - when i had this can's other 3 bro's, i remember it having carbonation, hops that were present...and now the this beer has evolved quite nicely, which happened on accident. i would only drink this again if it were 1 year or older. my preference from experience, nice surprise. absolute malt grenade and the color of the head is my favorite amongst any"
"Nice little beer when your in the mood for a malt bomb. I prefer this type of beer in the depths of winter. My timing is clearly off, but I won’t blame the beer for that. Nice representation of the style."
"Overall, this is a good beer. It is definitely too sweet to be a session beer. I might could drink two in a sitting, but that would be difficult. The flavors are complex and balanced, but overall the sweetness dominates."
"Final thought - Oskar blues, you have done it again. Thank you!"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the earthiness and musk of tea, which became even more apparent in the mild astringency of the mouthfeel. This was a lighter end beer, but it had all of the nice flavoring of a scotch ale. While it was at times almost too light, it retained enough flavor and kick, giving a tasty and unique brew."
"Oskar Blues with another really good beer!!!! This Scottish ale is quite sweet. There is a malt used to obtain this sweetness....and I dont like it per se. In a Scottish Ale I would like to taste more roast and earthy tones. The color of this beer was quite nice...dark amber with thin white head. There was nothing really to smell. The taste was very sweet....the malt used was loaded with molassis or brown sugar or caramel. I would compare this to the Malzbeer served in Brazil. Mouthfeel is fine...just to sweet for me!"
"O: A true meal in a glass. Like a loaf of cinnamon toast. Rich and satisfying."
"Pours a clean deep amber color with a light brown head. In the aroma, sweet earth and a hint of caramel. In the taste, caramel, a light roast, and a small presence of earthiness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry caramel like aftertaste. Hides the 8% well, and a nice small earthiness."
"Overall: Fairly good scotch ail, and neat that it is in cans."
"D: definitely sweet, but was hoping for something more in this one. got some of that smoke in the nose, but not on the palate, which was kind of a let down. if the abv were a bit lower i may have expected less complexity but that's not the case."
"1327"
"D - I'm not the type to take alcohol on a backpacking trip, but I'd certainly entertain the idea of keeping a cooler nearby for these on a car camping trip. This would be great with smoked meat or seafood."
"Amber with golden highlights. Lots of lacing. This brew smells fantastic, caramelized malt, subtle hops. The flavor has sucha nice bite and balanced complexity between the malt and hops, alcohol apparent but that just adds to the effect. This is an awesome brew. I applaud the use of the can which protects freshness better than bottles. Can't wait to try other Oskar Blues offerings."
"D- Old Chub is one heckuva canned beer. While Dale's Pale will be my favorite from Oskar Blues, this will always be another one I go to. Very delicious brew"
"O: Overall, a decent beer. Nothing to get excited about, but at only $8 and change for a sixer, it's a good deal and introduction to the style."
"O: Very solid beer. Well put together, and one of my favorites in this category."
"This beer pours a stained mahogany in color, looking like a Coke or Pepsi with no head. It smells of sweet caramel malts and that's about it. The flavor is solid, very sweet and of caramel, molasses, brown sugar. Its just not my thing. It is extremely smooth, pouring from the can. Its velvety soft and medium in body. This is a solid Scottish ale in my opinion but there isn't anything to set this one apart. Fans of the style should like it."
"Overall a good beer, but if I'm going camping backpacking with beer, I'd prefer Dale's Pale Ale. This one is just a little to sweet for my taste."
"O/D: Can't believe this is 8% ABV. It does not taste like it, there's no real alcohol presence. I was rather disappointed in this brew from a taste factor, but it's a great looking beer. Maybe it's better out of the."
"First beer of the night last night at the Yard House, Dedham, as my pre-meal drink to start the night off. Served on tap into a pint glass. Dark brown color. Fluffy white head and plenty of lacing. Smell was peaty and smoky, which is something that I am really into right now. Taste was also a winner. Tons of malt, so it had a sweet side to it. But the smokiness gave it a dark side, and both sides seemed to compliment each other nicely. Mouthfeel was thick but smooth. The abv was present but was appropriate. I liked this beer a lot. It's a shame that it's taken me this long to have one. Will have it again for sure."
"Poured from the green can into my Duvel tulip. Light brown color and nice roasty toasty aroma. The taste was malty with a touch of hops. I didn't get any of the smoky flavors mentioned in the literature. All in all this was a basic scotch ale. Couldn't tell it was canned. Cool. Would try again."
"D - Pleasantly surprised overall with this beer.  Very easy to drink more than one of these, I actually had 4.  I will seek out the cans to see if they are just as good as from the tap."
"A fantastic beer, especially if you love malt."
"D/O- No alc. A very smooth scotch ale. Really solid and easy to drink."
"O: A great example of the style."
"12oz can bought at McKinnon's in Salem. Pours a crystal-clear copper-brown body with virtually no head to speak of. Toffee, caramel, chocolate, nut, smoke all waft from the beer. Toffee, caramel, nut, bread, hints of smoke and chocolate in the flavor. Medium bodied with medium to full carbonation. Wow. I'd definitely call this more of a Scottish ale (despite the claim that it was a ""Scotch Ale"" on the label), but I don't mind as it's one of my favorite styles. Lots going on, all working in harmony to make this a glass full of awesome. Winning!"
"jd"
"Pours a dark, dark caramel brown. Holding the glass up to the light you can see small pieces floating around in the beer. Almost no head with the pour. Little to no lacing on the snifter while swirling. The smell is average. I smell a hint of caramel, bread, and malts. The taste is good. Taste of malts and a lot of sweet caramel. Not much carbonation present and very thin. This seems like a good gateway beer into the Wee Heavy style. Overall a good Wee Heavy and look forward to drinking more in the future."
"heavier side of medium bodied. ample carbonation. drinks fairly good, but i dont think i would want more than one or two in a session. im sure i will come across this can again, but its not something i would buy."
"O - one of the best scotch ales I have tasted; very easy to drink on a snowy early spring day"
" Decent but get the oaked and you will be allot happier!"
"This brew pours a stunning ruby red color with lots of depth. Creamy off-white head laced pretty well. The nose is pretty nice. Has a underlining woody smell that pairs with caramel and chocolate malts. Palate is rich and complex. Butterscotch, smokey oak, and earthy hops. The 8% is felt but not at a overbearing level. Mouthfeel is full and silky. Great take on the style."
"I guess this could be described as the limburger of beers in my opinion, Smell is like sour milk. but if you can get past that it has a complicated caramel malty flavor that finishes like sugar. Has a reddish brown color with a whiteish head. It's pretty smooth not overwelmingly boozey. I don't see much besides the smell hurting drinkability, and if you can get past it its a very good beer."
"Overall, I like this beer. This isn't a beer I need a 6 pack of but it is a beer I can have one or two of and very much enjoy."
"I'd certainly drink this again...possibly pick up a sixer if i see it. Nice little taste and a good kick of booze as well."
"A full rich tasting beer."
"I'm not big on Scottish Ales but this one went nicely with my meal and would likely go very nice by itself. Another complex beer from Oskars that I will have to focus on before I can give this beer justice with a decent review. Until then pick one up for yourself."
"Pours a murky amber-brown colour with thick off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly, not too much lacing. Smells of roasted malt, caramel with some earthy hops. Flavour is quite sweet upfront, with a hint a smoke towards the aftertaste. Thick mouthfeel, almost smooth. This is a very nice scotch ale, I don't know I waited so long to try this."
"D: Old Chub is a very sip worthy beer that tastes better in a glass rather than in the can. It does have high ABV that could make one regret drinking too many at once."
"Pours a hazy dark brown/red, thick tan head forms, tons of lacing, nice retention, really looks nice. Smell is wicked, sweet, very malty, chocolate and toffee, some roast, dark fruits, some dates, really pleasant. Taste is similar, very sweet and malty, dark fruits, heavy toffee, nice roast, cherries, balanced and not a hint of the alcohol, nice heavy finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. Very nice beer to drink."
"355 ml can, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.0%. Very dark brown to mahogany colour, thick beige head. Sweetish aroma of brown malts and caramel, Very sweet and malty flavour, notes of caramel, chocolate and some smoke. Should be drunk fairly cool, else the sweetness will feel cloying."
"D - great balance and complexity. definitely could see myself going through a sixer real quick."
"Drink- One step behind Ten Fidy as my favorite Oskar Blues offering. It's slightly creamy, balanced and deceptively smooth."
"This isn't a beer that could probably be consumed quickly but it is a beer that could be sipped through out an entire evening. An excellent after dinner beer."
"Haven't had this since they moved locations. Still that same, delicious scotch ale. Glad I revisited, may have to do so more often."
"Prost!!!"
"The roasts are a bit much on the palate, but it's one of the best wees I've had outside of one brewed in Scotland. Nice job."
"M-medium to full body, minimal amount of carbonation, leaves a nice coating in the mouth, very smooth"
"D - Not the easiest drinking beer, big in the flavor dept but at the cost of having another 3.0"
"The cpj"
"O - Coined as a session beer especially due to canning but the body is a little heavy for the whole sixer. Another great example of why I'm so addicted to this style."
"D - I usually shy away from this style, preferring the less sweet ales, but Oskar has balanced the sweetness with a malty alchohol flavor nicely."
"D- Not really. One is good per sitting. I bought a six pack and its going to be around for awhile. Its more of a sit back and have a high alcohol beer every once in a while that is mediocre. Probably won't get around to drinking another of these until all my Palo Santo is gone (but I'll prolly be buying more of that soon!)"
"On tap. Pours a dark, dark brown color with a thin head. No lacing. Aromas of malt, caramel, and alcohol. Flavors of malt, booze, some caramel and hints of smoke. A mix of flavors here for sure. Sweet and creamy. Warming alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is creamy. Overall its a solid brew but I don`t think I could drink more than 1 in a sitting. Toes the line of being too sweet and alcoholic."
"D - The drinkability is good here. I liked this beer quite a bit, but I think there are definitely better examples of the style out there. Overall, Im glad I got the chance to try this, and I'd get it again."
"Overall a decent ale, but nothing special. I'd certainly look to it again."
"Oscar Blues Scotch Ale is bunker material."
"Overall, a great example of a scotch ale and one that I'll surely have again."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. A nice malty/caramel flavored ale."
"D - It is very drinkable for a beer this dark. I had 4 in one sitting."
"I'm certainly want another one. It tastes good, feels good and I want to crack open another one, we're in good shape."
"D: I could easy polish a six pack of this while playing poker with friends or even playing horseshoes."
"O - A thoroughly enjoyable brew that exhibits complexity and depth. It's richness is ideal to quaff on cold winter nights (or days) and it's big booziness is bold enough to ignite the furnace of your soul."
"Overall, a good beer. It's not 'the best Scottish Ale I've had, but it's quit good, especially from a can."
"M/D - Medium/heavy body with a definite syrup like texture. Very low volumes of carbonation allow an increase in body. Very smooth on the palate as well. Alcohol is semi-hidden thanks in part to the overall sweetness of the beer. Very easy to drink and a great example of the style."
"Easy drinker, other than the headache."
"Overall a very tasty Scottish Ale, with lots of nice malty flavor and just a touch sweetness at the end."
"6/10"
"After a number of excellent experiences with Oskar Blues, this beer is a big swing and a miss for me. It's just a little too dull and boring to drink again."
"This is my first Oskar Blues offering, and I'll definitely be picking up more of them."
"DRINKABILITY: This was a quite satisfying, tasty beer that went well with the spicy food I was eating. I'll remember it and, in the right circumstances, would jump at the chance to order it again."
"This beer poured great and it was very easy to manipulate the head, smelled great and sweet. Malty and slightly floral. Tasted very much like the other scotch ale I've had (Founders Dirty Bastard) but it didn't quite have the big flavor profile that the founders had. The style was spot on, i just would have preferred to have the flavor knob turned up"
"Not sure what it was about this one but I had trouble finishing it off-- and that's uncommon for me. There's nothing I can really pick out that I disliked aside from the syrupy mouthfeel, but somehow all of the components just failed to mesh."
"I'm not going to get into too much detail with this one because I drank it all day during the NFL division championship round of games last weekend (Green Bay beat Chicago and Pitt beat the Jets), and all I remember is that I f'ing loved it. In a can but still drinks expensive. Rich but still drinkable all day. So, I definitely plan on finding some more to always have around the house."
"This beer is highly drinkable. It isn't too heavy or too sweet. It's just great."
"M/D: I haven't tried too many Scotch ales, but of those I have tried this one has by far the best body (similar to an oatmeal stout to me) and mouthfeel. I could put away more than a couple of these away in one sitting."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It was a nice change of pace and I will always support a micro brew brave enough to stick their beer in cans. Cans are a hard sell for the uninformed, and there are many out there. It seams after reading through my review that all I can say is this beer is sweet. I kind of feel like the guys in the movie ""Dude wheres my car?"". Well not to string this out any further I recommend you pick up a six-o-cans and drink down this nectar. My local beer stores are selling this for $9.99 I hope you get as good a deal."
"D: I'd certainly not turn down more of these, but to my mind, there are better examples of the style, both domestic and of course from Scotland itself."
"M, D- A viscous medium body. A very creamy and smooth feel like the Belhaven Wee Heavy, which is certainly a compliment."
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Very attractive rusty red, with a nice two inch white and sticky head. Very nice lacing that hangs around the whole time. A malt powered smell of burnt sugars and hints of plum. Solid taste, more powerful then the nose, some alcohol in the finish. Thickest Scotch Ale I have ever had,a wonderful winter warmer. Moderate carbonation. I think this great one in done beer, that would be perfect after snow blowing the driveway."
"Pours from the can a beautiful medium to dark brown with a nice cap of off-white foam on top. Aromas of caramel, roasted nuts, light peat smoke and dark fruit. On the palate this one is fairly full-bodied, with a little peat, dark fruit, chewy malt and alcohol."
"Can. Canned on 09-07-10 @ 15:16. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a deep, dark clear copper color with a 1 finger light tan head. Caramel, slight smoke, peat, and some spice fill out the nose. Medium mouthfeel. Caramel smokiness comes to mind first as I take my first sip. I haven't had a whole lot of Scotch Ales so my experience is rather minimal with this style but it is fairly easy drinking and has a nice flavor profile. Its fairly rich and the flavor really comes alive as it warms. It starts with an almost caramel apple start with some smoke that then transitions to a lingering bitterness. The 8% really isn't that noticeable. Minimal lace."
"A full-bodied, enjoyable beer."
"D: Very drinkable for a scotch ale, Definitely will enjoy this one again!"
"Oskar Blues Old Chub has a nice dark brown colour and a good 3 mm head that fades to excellent lacing over the entire upper surface of my pint glass. The smell is very malty with some sweet caramel overtones. The taste is malty with some hop balance up friont. The maltiness is the dominant flavour though with some sweet toffee too. The finish is like sweet bitter coffee. After drinking it for awhile, the bitter and smokey aftertaste built to be unpleasant. This beer has a lot going for it. It reminds me of Founders Dirty Bastard, except for the aftertaste."
"Overall this was a good beer. From the scotch ales that I have had, this was nothing special for the style. In general, it seemed like a safety attempt at this style. They could have done more with the body and definitely a bit more carbonation."
"If I were Captain Cookman and had people over to eat BBQ or something, I'd get another 6pack of this to pair with dinner sometime (or I'd recommend it to someone else who is both Captain BBQ and fond of hosting people). Unfortunately, I'm Private Hermit, so I will likely never buy this beer again."
"D- Yes, its drinkable, cheers!"
"good drinkability, just a little on the pricey side. lighter than other Scotch Ales, which make it easier to throw a few back."
"Drinkability was good, as this bordered on being too sweet but did not cross the line into gross sweetness overkill; went down relatively easy considering it was 8% ABV and I enjoyed this quite a bit. I recommend trying this beer."
"d- good"
"D: Oversweetness prohibits this one from being extremely drinkable, but I never got sick of it throughout the one glass that I had. Still, would not opt for another in the same night."
"Pours a deep dark reddish brown color with a thick yellowish white head and tons of lacing. Smells of coffee and tons of malts. Tastes of tons of malts -- a malt overload -- and some toffee, caramel, chocolate, and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with a little carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"Beer from a can is something i usually avoid unless im fishing or camping but this beer is a keeper. If i could find it more easily i would keep this beer around all the time. A definite must try."
"D: I'm notoriously not a fan of this style because many I've tried has sort of a ""dog food-like"" aftertaste that I usually find unpleasant. ""Old Chub"" had none of those things and I found it to be a pure malt-candy delight. This may be my new favorite Scotch Ale."
"Thanx goes to D Kurtz....again. Nice surprise, I heard a lot of good about Oscar Blues, now I need to try the rest."
"Notes: Maybe within the style this would deserve a higher mark? Pretty good malty offering in any case from Oskar Blues."
"Drinkability: I love me a good American scotch ale, a good smoked beer, and beer from a can! This one combines all the great elements I've come to love about beer! The beechwood comes through beautifully in the glass on this one, and the big malt backbone is not overly sweet or cloying, which makes this one of the better scotch ale's I've had. The 8.0% ABV is well hidden here, so be careful with this one! An excellent beer all around and one that should be tried by all!"
"Maybe it's the style, but this isn't a beer I'll be revisiting anytime soon, it just seems completely lacking ""umph"" and balance."
"The flavor is very much like the nose; Sweet. Big cloyingly sweet flavors clash with each other. There is some caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, toffee and just a hint of smoke. This beer has the potential to be complex and flavorful, but the overwhelming sweetness seems to steal the show. Medium/full bodied and mildly carbonated. Almost a syrupy mouthfeel. I had a hard time finishing the glass."
"This beer has almost no carbonation at all, a pleasantly sweet aftertaste, is extremely smooth and easy to down. I could drink these endlessly..."
"Pours a deep mahagony color with a creamy white one finger head. Smells sweet and carmelized, some licorice, toffee. Tastes very sweet, toffee, caramel, some earthiness. The lingering creamy caramel is the best part. Low carbing, highly drinkable, very smooth. I pick this up again. A bargain at $2.10 for a single."
"It's a bit strong and heavy. One is enough."
"I love Scotch Ale and this as of 12/27/2010 is my favorite of the style. Pours a great very dark color with hues of amber bleeding threw. The aroma is very weak but is a lovely fragrance. Sweet malt power threw this hint of aroma. Taste is excellent the sweet malt and main charectoristics of Scotch style ale power threw. The alcohol is perfectly hidden, but not to much. This is a staple in my fridge when I can afford it. Price is running a bit high on Oskar Blue brews in my area as of late, and has halted my purchasing of them for a bit."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied and very smooth going down. I could definitely drink several of these. This beer has nice flavor and balance for the style."
"This is a decent brew, but nothing worth seeking out. It struck me as rather similar to the Chocolate Bock that Sam Adams puts out, but inferior to it overall. Not a bad beer, but nothing amazing."
"One of those beers everyone says you have to try maybe that led to the let down, working my way through this six pack."
"D: It is very drinkable for the abv."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a light orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramrl, and slight bitter hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramal, chocolate, and a slight hop followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. I can say this one is pretty tasty out of the can or on-tap now. Excellent flavor going on here without a doubt with a good aroma to followthrough on the flavor. I'm glad that OB is back in SC again to stay! This one is a must try if you have been under a rock for quite awhile..."
"D- nicely drinkable scottish ale, there are more complex beers out there, but this is just nice."
"This is a VERY good American version of a Wee Heavy. Saddled up to a roarin' fire and kicked back a few for the late NFL games. Lots o' good stuff brewin' in this can laddies!"
"D--High. You can barely taste the alcohol, and because of the sweetness of the beer, I could see myself drinking several of these in a night. Especially on a nice, cool night."
"D: Great overall brew with a nice balance, of flavors. Very drinkable for the ABV - can't really notice it except at the very end of the sip."
"I really like this. Nice scotch ale."
"best scotch ale i have had to date. really nice flavor profile and just right warming alcohol finish. could drink many of these in a night."
"Very good. Can't wait to get my hands on some more of this."
"D: More please."
"Creamy mouthfeel. I could drink a few of these."
"Old Chub is a relatively heavy beer, and loaded with dynamic, and somewhat sweet flavors that mask the alcohol very well. Its one of the only scotch ales that I can drink 3-or4-or 5 of in a sitting"
"Good price, I snagged on for a build your own 6er for 10 bucks."
"D- The alcohol affects this drinkability. A bit syrupy but still very yummy."
"This beer should be in attendance at your next camping trip."
"This is a great beer, and I have been impressed with both Oskar Blues beers I have had so far, so I'm going to be sure and pick more up. I didn't realize this was 8%, because it is far too drinkable!"
"D- Booziness suffers the overall. Sip this beer. Very complex though. The heaviness and syrupy feel is a bit overwhelming, but enjoyable at the same time."
"Poured from a can (dated 8/21/10) into a pint glass."
"Overall, yes do yourself a favor and have one after another."
"The taste is sweet upfront with lively carbonation and flavors of toffee, chocolate, molasses, burnt sugar, and an earthy residual sweetness on the end. No hops to be found as this beer lingers with a sweet syrupy finish."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - is just a nice scotch kick. Could drink alot of this."
"Pours a moderate brown color with an off white head. The nose is caramel and a slight touch of earthy hops. A bit of toffee and slight roast there as well. The taste is mostly a light caramel/toffee flavor with a bit of light fruits and some dry hops. The feel is nice and creamy; a bit heavy, but not overly so. Drinks quite well and is a really nice example of the style."
"D - Not too experienced on the scottish ale style but I can't complain about this one...nice flavors of sweet malt and dark fruits...I just wish I could have picked up more on the nose"
"D - Not one of my favorites by a long shot. Little disappointed to be honest."
"Overall, this was a strange beer. Not sure if Id' buy this again."
"Alcohol was more evident than I expected but not too bad. Mostly, though, I can't really see any reason to have this one again. It wasn't unpleasant but there are much better beers out there."
"Mouthfeel is rather heavy and chewy, but very smooth with little carbonation. Overall, a high drinkable but almost too sweet Scottish ale."
"Might be hard to consume too many beers this rich and high in alcohol, but certainly more than one could had, especially with a bit of food to cut it down a bit."
"Overall a nice Scottish ale better than average. It is good but nothing groundbreaking there are better Scottish ales out there. However this is a nice beer."
"Overall, it's not atrocious, many like it, but it's a little too sweet for me."
"This one was a bit on the sweet side, but made a pleasant sipper as it warmed."
"Poured from can into Ikea beer mug. Dark, opaque amber color with a very thin white head that dissipates rapidly. Brown sugar most evident on the nose, with hints of caramel, and a smokey profile at the end. Caramel taste, with a hint of vanilla. Slightly bitter, carbonated aftertaste, but does not detract too much from the smoothness of the drink."
"Not a bad brew, could have used a few more of those darker notes, but it's an enjoyable malty beer overall."
"D - I haven't tried too many scottish ales, but this is pretty good. 8% isn't too high, but should still be noticeable and in this beer it is not. Sweetness isn't off-putting, it's inviting and leaves a bit of mystery in the flavor for the next sip."
"Drinks good leaves a nice warm filling in your tummy."
"Overall, a nice and flavorful scotch ale. Really clean and balanced and a good interpretation of the style. Worth trying."
"D: I wouldn't want to drink a whole bunch of these in one sitting, but this is a very good after-dinner sipper."
"Medium-full bodied, light effervescence, smooth and chewy. All malt aftertaste. A seriously good draught. Needs a bit more nose."
"D - Very drinkable. It hits the expected notes of a Scottish Ale."
"Pretty tasty beer all up, rich and heavy and with some robust, manly flavours that will put hairs on your chest. Good effort."
"D - I can handle only one of these. I have a thistle glass in my collection and this is the perfect beer for this. Old Chub is decent, but give me a Gubna any day of the week over this one."
"Deep brownish red with a light beige head that didn't last. Sweet caramel malty aroma, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied with low to medium carbonation and smooth, creamy feel. Sweet caramel flavors in the beginning, smokey chocolate in the middle , and a coffee flavored finish with a very slight alcoholic hint at the end. Went down pretty easy."
"D-despite the mouthfeel, this beer disappeared rather quickly, and i wouldn't mind having another. the taste stays throughout the drinking and i found myself excited every time i reach for the glass."
"Notes: This is my first Oskar Blues sampling. I was going to trade for this but I just noticed Whole Foods in La Jolla started carrying the whole Oskar lineup (maybe it's been out here for awhile and the cans were just hiding from me). So far so good, Ten Fidy and GUBNA along with football this weekend."
"Very drinkable for the smokey and roasted character."
"Another fine job from the folks at OB."
"and some Texas-style Beef Brisket would both play off the malt and smoke of Old Chub."
"Overall this beer is perfect, nothing at all can be slander this beer. ABV is not at all noticeable and I could drink 12 of these (and then go to bed) but you get the idea."
"Highly drinkable smoked scotts ale."
"I'd like to try the bottled variety just to see if there is any difference. However, I would buy another six pack of the cans without question. Also this is my first review hopefully I've been sensible and appropriate."
"Notes: Overall this is a nice easy drinking and tasty beer."
"D-Maybe its not my style. A bit too boozey and sweet for my taste. Definately worth a try however."
"D-This was decent, but not something I will seek again, especially at the price. I like SkullSplitter and the Wee Heavy style much better."
"Drinkability-It's nice, it's just so damned sweet that it gets cloying after awhile and you need to pause between drinks."
"I can't imagine that this is a historically accurate Scottish beer, but it sure is tasty!"
"As drinkable as an 8% scotch ale could be. Throw a few of these with some Dale's pale on your camping trip."
"Overall: Very solid beer overall. I'm drinking at the wrong time of year but this would be an excellent winter warmer. I'll be buying more this winter."
"DB- Scottish Ales are one of the more definite styles to me, very signature in their flavor. This separates itself from other examples of the style with a nice roast aspect. The mouthfeel and sweetness hold this one back for me, it gets tiring."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark brown color with a small head. Smell is very mild, maybe a hint of malts, not much there. Taste is of sweet malts, a hint of hops, good flavor. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Medium-full body, slightly chewy, some creaminess, with moderate carbonation. Malty brew, with well-hidden alcohol. Not bad, fairly enjoyable, easy to drink certainly, but I feel like the malt flavor is a little non-descript except for a touch of bitter chocolate in the finish. May need to try a different batch."
"D A good beer. Large in alcohol, so won't be drinking a lot of it. Overall a well crafted beer."
"Drinkability -- It hits all of the markers I expect in a scotch ale. Massive rich, roasty malt flavor and just enough hop presence to keep things interesting. Another solid beer from Oskar Blues."
"Exceptionally drinkable due to the smoothness and perfect blending of all the flavors. This is the best beer of this style that I have had."
" Taste is excellent full and complex like an aged wine - a dry bitterness in the back of the mouth, with sweet caramel goodness up front, not too smoothe balanced just enough by the tangy fruit flavors - plum, raisen. A fine complement to beef or cake. I find it very drinkable, but not for the light of heart."
"D: This is one of those OB brews that you need to be careful around, higher ABV and a clean easy drink. the only thing that slightly brings this ale down is the presence of booze in the aroma, not too much but a little less and total 100%. Well I feel that I enjoy the aroma and do not wish it to change, but for the drinkability -.5"
"D- Best example of a scottish ale I've had AND it's in a can"
"D: The alcoholy sweetness makes this a sipper and a bit difficult to take too much of but this is still a great beer from a great brewery"
"Overall, I'll probably get this again, but not if I'd go with Dirty Bastard before it every time."
"D - A nice warming sipper. A beer that you would enjoy 1 or maybe 2 of but that's about it, at least for me anyway. I really enjoyed this one and have been wanting to try it for a good while. It does a decent job at hiding that 8% ABV with it's smooth rich flavor profile. A good beer I probable will come back to sometime. Cheers!"
"d: Obviously low drinkablility. Solid Scottish ale, i prefer mine to be just a little less chocolaty though as it seems like it skirts the line of crossing over to an imperial stout."
"That said, I've grown the scope of my palate and learned to embrace the Scotch Ale. I recommend you try this beer."
"It's a little tough to compare this to other Scottish ales as it is bigger than almost all of them. This one is more Scotch ale than Scottish. Classification aside, it's an excellent malt-forward beer. Call it what you will, it's tasty."
"This is exceptionally creamy and drinkable, and for the price it is an excellent choice."
"D - Excellent scotch ale, really enjoyed it and plan on enjoying it again, and again."
"drinkability: Man, this is easy to knock back."
"Drinkability- certainly and definitely a sipper this is a big heavy made for winter time beer that I happen to be drinking on a hot summer day just because i have the craving to try this beer again which i havent had in so long, let me honest with you this is a reallly goood beer, if your a fan of scotch ales this is a must try and if you are a fan of good beer this is a must try, its just so smooth and easy drinking and complex and the sweetness though plenty sweet never gets unbearable, a future staple for me"
"Thanks to jgasparine for this brew! 12 ounce can, canned on 6/30/2009 (printed on bottom of can). The brew pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head that went away quickly. Lacing is decent. Aroma is pretty nice, it's sweet and malty and it smells like caramel malt, peat, smoke, and dark fruit (plums). It tastes like caramel malt, chocolate, smoke/peat, molasses, and a bit of dark fruit. Even though the can is a year old, this is still a good brew! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth and not hard to drink at all. Not a bad beer, I liked it."
"Overall a malty brew that is multidimensional in its complexity and demands to be contemplated and sipped."
"Drinkability:This is a terrific scotch ale, thick and rich, malty and sweet. As you drink it, it reveals hidden complexity."
"D: Good example of the style - easy to drink and at 8% I could have a few of these with no problem at all."
"Drinkability- This was a really good scottish ale. I enjoyed it. I would like to have it again."
"Notes: I have had this beer a couple of times before and tried the Dales pale ale. This is a very tasty brew and very drinkable. Cheers."
"drink this"
"Poured a dark brown into my Sam Adams pint glass. Gave two fingers of head that left behind some impressive lacing behind with each sip. The smell was extremely malty and sweet. Some definite caramel and chocolate scents in there. Taste was what I expected from the smell. Next to no hops. Had a very sweet malt taste with chocolate and caramel up front. I picked up a nice smoke taste on the backside. Mouthfeel was full and very smooth. I would never have guessed its 8%. This just became my new stand by brew."
"This sat in my stomach more heavily than I expected, considering the mouthfeel. It isn't too boozey, considering the style."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. A really nice example of the style and anytime you can get a good beer in a can it is a win."
" Drinkability is good even on a hot summer day."
"Salud!"
"I can see how someone with a different palate might like this, but it's not for me. I don't think I'll be coming back for more any time soon."
"Poured from a can, dark brown with not much head that fades pretty quickly. Looks well carbonated with a good amount of bubbles. Mild, sweet, slightly raisin smell. Toasty malt taste and some caramel. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Very drinkable, I would definitely have this again."
"D: Very drinkable. The sweetness would be a bit wearying over time but it's very smooth for its strength. Zero alcohol burn and pleasantly warming."
"Pours from the 12 oz. can (still gotta get used to typing ""can"" instead of ""bottle"") a cola colored brown with a light tan, foamy, one finger head that rather quickly settles into a thick collar. I can't make out the level of carbonation because it's impossible to see how many (if any) bubbles there are in the darkness. Aroma is sweet & malty, with hints of caramel & chocolate. The 1st sip is a rich joyous blend of caramel, coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, and roasted malt with a touch of smoke thrown in. The mouthfeel is of notable substance...bold, thick, but not overpoweringly heavy. The drinkability is almost too good...this goes down dangerously easy for a beer weighing in at 8% abv. Overall? Holy Haggis!! This is one hell of a beautiful brew!! I'm gonna be buying quite a lot of this in the near future!!!"
"Bought this one after wanting tontaste some real craft beer from a can. Pours dark brown and slightly thick. Some carbonation with little to no head. Aromas of caramel and sweet corn. Hints of some alcohol. Starts off sweet and the malts really start to take presedence. There is some hints of bubble gum and caramel popcorn. Really surprised by the flavor. I like to say that I do get metalic flavors but that might be mental. I really enjoyed this one. The finish ends with a great coat of hops and malts."
"D - Very smooth for 8%. Alcohol is well hidden. One could down a few of these pretty easy."
"D--At 8 percent, this could be a little tricky in terms of making a session beer of out it, however, highly recommended!"
"I can't think of many I enjoy more from this style. There does seem to be a little variation from can to can, which may lead to some of the lesser reviews, or not. This is a solid brew, just maybe not what some expect from the style."
"Very drinkable for being 8%, it hides it well. I enjoyed drinking this quite a lot."
"D: Really not a great offering from Oskar Blues. I would rather pick up a can of Gordon or Ten Fidy."
"Drinkability - wanna get toasty and spend a lot of money, drink this. Wanna enjoy a scotch ale, don't drink this. Not recommended."
"I'm a little disappointed - this has been the only Oskar Blues beer I've tried that I haven't liked."
"Poured from the can into large wine glass,temp at about 40.Nice dark color,good clarity,half finger head.went down nice and smooth,very rich.I liked this one alot,good sipping beer.Alcohol was present,but not overpowering.I was a little skeptical of it coming from a can,but don't let that fool you!You wont regret this one."
"This is a very good scotch ale. Has all the malts you would want for the style, completed by a great mouthfeel and drinkability. Very impressive stuff. Would love to session this brew even with its high alcohol level."
"D - This is definitely good, didn't have huge expectations for this, but defintely a winning, good scotch ale."
"I love the way this beer tastes - brown sugar, chocolate, a little dark fruit, exceptionally smooth. Body is full, but so smooth you never notice a hint of the alcohol. Strong maltiness to it, with just the slightest bit of smokiness. This beer is great with dinner, dessert, and strong cheese in my opinion."
"D - Quite different than any Scottish ale I've had before and a very nice surprise. This beer is dangerously drinkable for an 8% beer. A great beer to remind you that a beer doesn't have to be packed with hops to be a winner. First beer I ever had from Oskar Blues, and I'm eager to have more."
"Old Chub had been calling my name for a while, but I have to admit I was slightly underwhelmed. It was good, but definitely won't rank among my top Scottish ales."
"o - Can't say its my favorite scotch ale, but I do like it and would drink it again."
"This like many other flavor rich, malty ales, goes great with one my new favorites, Achadinha Capricious aged goat cheese."
"Final Impressions: Looks and drinks like a Coca-Cola on beeroids, without the high effervescence. The sweet smokiness is reminiscent of a lowland or speyside Scotch. A beer that could go with dessert, but is surprisingly lighter and more drinkable than expected. An excellent Scotch ale, but on the sweeter end."
"This is a great Wee Heavy in a good looking can. I will soon seek out a fresh six pack, as I bought the one this came from in December 09 when it was already a year old. I don't think age harms it, but I can't tell you if it helps it."
"Thanks to the threewisemen for enabling me to experience this"
"I too am a huge fan of the OB brewery. I can't wait to see what they're going to make next. Can or bottle, this stuff is really good."
"Here comes Oskar Blues and one of their mainstays- Old Chub. It is a delicious ale that is not only full bodied but smooth going down. Most prefer to pour it into a glass but I prefer right from the can. You do not get that can taste but you do get the great taste of Old Chub. I grabbed a 6 pack today and it came in it's usual style can. When I looked at the 6 pack behind the one I chose, it seemed they changed the style of the can. I did enjoy the new look!"
"D: This beer is extremely drinkable and is perfect if you're looking for something rich and creamy with a good amount of flavor. I would definitely try this one again."
"Feels smooth and also sticky on the palate, very sticky sweetness. Carbonation is spot on with this. Not too lively, just about perfect. Great drinkability here, great alcohol content makes this a winner in my book. Just have to remember to not overdo it, this one could give you a nasty hangover in the morn."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full and has a creamy amount of carbonation."
"tter! Complaints aside, this is a great representation of the style. I'm quite certain that OB followed the Scottish way, and fermented on the cold side, followed by a nice chilly secondary fermentation to clean things up further. A job well done on a severely under-appreciated style."
"Can't wait to try this in a can! Could easily see quickly putting back a sixer of this. Good drinkin'."
"D: One of the better Scottish Ales available in this country. Drinkable."
"A nice beer, but one that does'nt sit well. Once purchased, the cans should be consumed within a reasonable time period as they tend to flatten with time. But, no one buys beer to sit around - do they? Well ... do they!"
"This is such a great beer, it takes the style and ratchets it up to 11. highly recommended."
"Medium bodied, low carbonation, and sweet. Feels somewhat sticky. Very drinkable. Not a lot to say about this one, except it is good."
"D-Really nice beer. Really malty with a decent body to back it up. Nice to see that this isn't cloying or too sweet."
"D- the 8% isnt really well hidden here but it goes so well. This is a big beer and I really enjoy that."
"Drinkability is quite good. Alcohol is very well-hidden, and the beer is quite tasty."
"D: This is a very good beer. Not exactly my favorite style, so I don't expect to drink it a lot, but if I were to crave a Scottish Ale, this would be my go to."
"The aroma was malty with a bit of peat. Not much smoke the way others have described it to me. There was a pronounced sweetness and some caramel flavor that went with the maltiness and peat. The mouthfeel was very smooth and seemed to temper the slight boozy after-taste."
"overall a pleasant beverage from oscar Blues"
"Another hit from OB! This was served with a college guys head (very little)and a little lace. Color is a very dark brown with mahoganey hightlights. Aroma is standard, classic Scotch Ale: very malty, a bit roasty and peaty. Flavor's about the same plus lots of caramel and some toffee. Boozy in the finish. Good body and carbonation. A standard for Scotch Ales."
"Taste is very smokey but not over the top and still very drinkable. It's got some earthy tones and nice to drink. Super rich and smooth."
"D - Now when I had this fresh it really was dry to finish but with some age the flavors rounded out and little bite was received by the ABV. Would find it again if it was this affordable."
"D: Good overall beer that you can enjoy en mass!"
"D-It's a nice, robust beer that has a nice warming quality. It's not an everyday or more than one a night beer for me, but a nice beer from time to time."
"Nothing terrible, nothing great."
"The flavor is big and full upon first contact. The smoky bit of heat comes at the end and extends well into the after taste. The main flavors are a mix between a super sweet caramel malt and a smoky/slightly hop component. The mouth feel is full and thick. Will get again, great value and great taste."
"Taste is full and rich in malt body with a lingering caramel finish and a bit of roast. Not much for variety but smooth and rich enough to mask the ABV easily. Flavor improves somewhat with warming but the lack of carbonation limits the potential here. Full bodied feel though without much texture and in fact kind of watery, again firming up a tad with warming. Not really getting this one, another Oskar Blues beer with a malty coverup, even for the style."
"Good drinkability for the high abv."
"D: A really solid brew overall. The nose on it was just a little disappointing, but overall I enjoyed this beer."
"D- Strong tastes, this is certainly no wimpy beer! Obvious, strong, huge, comforting, relaxing and fairly complex. Nothing I would want to session, this is more of a sipper, made all the better by the fact that it's in a can! I really liked this beer, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a one-hit-quit kind of a beer!"
"D- An awesome beer to sip on; really complex with lots going on."
"This is probably too sweet to drink all night, but most scottish ales are. Still would be great in the winter. I'd love one of these after skiing."
"Poured into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet. Minimal head retention which is an off white and little lacing. The smell is of rasins dates, brown sugar, malty goodness. Taste is similar, with verly little hop presence but not cloying. Carbonation is wonderfully light and mouthfeel is slightly syrupy but silky smooth. Taste is fantastic and similar to the nose with no hot or phenolic surprises. Very straightforward. My new favorite example to the style. It reminds me of a light quad without the belgian yeast peculiarity imparted. This is a fantastic brew. Heavenly."
"Drinkability is pretty high, I could throw down a few if it wasn't for the very well hidden 8% ABV. The alcohol doesn't even make itself known until you feel a slight warming on the palette."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights and a tan milkshake head that melts slowly leaving sheets of lace on the glass. Rich roasted malt, cocoa and brown sugar with a touch of dark fruit in the nose. Big and slightly smokey with rich carmelized malt and an earthy tea/tobacco like bitterness. This is a big Scottish ale for sure, almost more of a Wee heavy than an 80 shilling export. Full and sticky bodied with mild carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden in the finish. A tasty brew, I wish I had another one."
"A very well balanced ale done right!! Chocolate and spices don very well."
"Can from Westy in Camp Hill - Dark chocolate pour with thin head, sweet almost cordial cherry nose, palate is malty caramel, some chocolate and brown sugar, medium body finishing with a pleasant alcohol burn, moderate carbonation. This is a beautiful beer."
"D: The lack of carbonation and the thin watery mouthfeel make this beer a one and done. I drank it because I had it, but wont be buying another for a while.. hoping that the beer I got was just an anomaly."
"Old Chub is an exceptional ale that almost goes down a little too easy. I almost wish the alcohol was a little more upfront so I wouldn't want to drink so much of this. Oskar Blues does it again...excellent!"
"D - A sipping beer for sure but soooo good! One of my favorites to take on a cold camping trip to keep me warm!"
"anyway it's a decent ale for the style, quite simply not for mine."
"D=For the alcohol content....pretty damn easy. I would say 3 is a good number. As its one of the few oskar blues that come in 6 packs (that I've seen), 3 is perfect. You get two enjoyable nights."
"Nice ruby color, with very few bubbles to interrupt the display. I don't know what the big deal is about the head-- I poured right into the center of the glass and got a mountain of foam with very little fuss. It didn't last long, but it was medium dense and full of bubbles despite the low carbonation. Raisins, prunes, apricots, caramel and pears erupt in the aroma, followed by the distinct tang of alcohol, then a slightly smoky smell to finish. And that pretty much sums up the taste, too, except the ham-fisted alcohol squashes the malty, fruity flavors. It's not too sweet, not very dry but definitely suffers from the ABV. I like what I've had from Oskar Blues, but if they toned down the alcohol on this beer it would be great. Instead, it's merely drinkable."
"This beer was an anomaly. I'm torn between the way it started and the way it finished. First, I would give the advice to allow this beer to sit and warm a bit. It pours a dark amber with transparent reddish orange along the edges. Perhaps it was ruined by the can, but it only had only a light scotch malt and inexpensive alcohol aroma. A thin mouth feel initially, it filled out a bit when it warmed. The alcohol flavor did not match the taste and so reminded me of a steel reserve or other high alcohol cheap beer. However, as it warmed the caramel malts came out a bit more. In the end, after sitting for half an hour, the strengthened mouthfeel and slightly more complex flavor still could not overpower the overbearing alcohol finish."
"I really like this. Just wish the head stuck around awhile."
"D - Well, it's 8% and the tart sweetness gives pause. But after finishing one, I would consider another."
"A: Thin head on a hard pour, the color is a dirty coffee brown, minor spots of sticky head - 3.00, S: Strong caramel and tootsie roll, malt overload with just the faintest hint of citrusy hops - 4.50, T: Like the nose there are strong caramel malts as well some dark chocolates, the palate also provides a hefty shot of raisins, alcohol is evident but is not disruptive to the beer, hops provide just a nice dollop of grapefruit, faintest touch of smoke - 4.25, M: The heavy malts on the beer provide an extremely smooth mouth feel and provide a lingering syrupiness - 4.50, D: All around an exceptional beer, extremely enjoyable and one I'd happily drink again - 4.25"
"Taste was similar but balanced out by some hop bitterness. Rich and balanced. Strong malt and caramel richness. Full mouthfeel. Really nice beer that's pretty easy to drink."
"A very full bodied and delicious beer that's almost certainly all but crossing the line between a Scottish Ale and a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy. And no bad thing."
"Ill admit, though, that this is only my second scotch ale. My first was on tap at Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, and I loved it. That beer is the reason why Ive been meaning to pick this one up, in fact."
"Value: Great price at $9.00 a sixer."
"D - This was my first craft brew from a can, and I'm impressed. Easy to drink, and a fine scotch ale (one of my favorite styles)."
"A wonderful deep dark reddish brown in color, with light carbonation. I was not able to get much of a head, even with a fairly aggressive pour, and really not much lacing. Aroma is very malty with lots of caramel and chocolate aroma. Mmm, very presently surprised by the taste. Very malty with loads of caramel and some chocolate notes. Also getting a bit of dried fruit, some smokiness and a touch of grassy hops. This beer is Smoooth, and believe me that extra O is not a typo. I was about to type that it is hard to believe this is 8%, but as it warms a bit the alcohol really comes out. Drinking this beer is an experience to savor and enjoy. I have not had many scotch ales, but this is by far the best so far."
"A nice sipper - I guess the can makes you think that you're in for a less substantial beer? One of the best of the style!"
"D: Well with no hops detectable to hide the booze I will have to claim the drinkability comes from the mix of malts used to achieve an easy drinker. Well balanced and a truly remarkable war between the sweet and the boozey finish in an Even Steven Tie!"
"Pours a dark, seemingly murky brown, with some dark auburn highlights and a minor bit of light ecru head. The smell is piney, sappy, sweet, and has a small hint of breadiness as well. The taste holds plenty of malty sweetness, with the sap and pine from the nose coming through as well. The medium body is lightened a bit by the nice amount of carbonation, allowing this brew to maintain a good level of drinkability."
"i have had this on tap and now in can, all around a great brew."
"On a side note, this beer pairs incredibly well with Colby-Jack Cheese, give it a try!"
"D: Very drinkable beer. It's strong, but not too overbearing on the palate, and it comes in cans, which are always convenient."
"Pours dark reddish brown with a tan head. The aroma is dark fruit, smoke and caramel malt. The flavor is dark fruit, light smoke, roasted malt and some chocolate. The finish is slightly fruity with some smoke. A little bit of alcohol also appears in the aftertaste, but it is faint. Medium, somewhat creamy mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. I had had Old Chub many moons ago and recall it being rather heavy; I think my palate simply appreciates bigger beers now, because I find this easy to drink -- though a sixpack might, admittedly, be a bit much."
"Overall it's a great scottish ale...and it comes in a can which is awesome. However I don't think it surpasses my Michigan scottish ale favorites from Founder's and Dark Horse."
"There is a nice smooth creamy feel. This is a winter beer for me. It reminds of a mellow stout."
"D- This was an enjoyable beer that for some reason eluded the ratings by me until now. A little sweet for me but a good intro I would think for the style. The sweetness was the only factor that would keep me from killing a sixer of this....well that and it's not in Indiana."
"Old Chub has sweet, flat, and warming characteristics similar to a winter warmer; however it does not have a lasting impact."
"D- The alcohol never shows itself on the palate or in the throat, but by the end of the glass I did feel a warming sensation in my stomach. The 8% shows up, but it takes a while. Good beer that needs to be consumed close to room temperature to be truly appreciated."
"Thank you Drizzam, you are a very nice individual."
"D - This is a pretty tasty brew. The 8% ABV may preclude it from being sessionable, but it is certainly highly drinkable. Another excellent brew from Oskar Blues. A top notch version of this style of beer."
"Conclusion: Nice example of the style; one I was definitely stoked to finally get to try!"
"Light head, barely gets to one finger, dark brown color, gone in a flash, no real lacing, no foam islands. Mahogany brown in color, mild fogginess to it, more copper orange around the rims. Fruitcake scented nose, full of sweet baking spices, nuts, milk chocolate, butterscotch, coffee ice cream, cola, only sign of hops might be that it texturally stiffens after a second of two in your nostrils. Full-bodied, layers itself like syrup on your tongue, if the carbonation didn't have a prickle to it it would be too cloying for sure. Brown sugar, cola, caramel, butterscotch, ginger, cinnamon, honeyed nuts make it a candidate for a Willy Wonka product. More floral here, glazed bread. Impressive in that it maintains a full throttle appeal throughout, however, nuance and contrast are not strong points."
"Served from a cellar temperature can into a chalice. The beer is a very dark ruby color; it seems darker than other Scottish style beers I've had. A slight head of tan bubbles disappeared to virtually nothing, just a spiderwork lacing of tiny foam in the center of the surface. It has a biscuit and caramel aroma, but it isn't too potent. This is a tasty Scotch ale! Loads of caramel malt and a hint of alcohol work well together. There may be some toffee in there or some other sort of non-candy sweetness, but I can't be sure. It has a light, smooth finish that leaves the slightest mouthcoating the evaporates as if it were pure alcohol. The body feels pretty heavy at first, but it seems to lighten after the beer first hits my mouth. I'm going to classify it as being on the lighter side of medium. Whatever it is, I like it. This is a very easy drinking beer. I may be a bit biased, as this is my favorite style of beer, but I could drink this entire six pack by myself. On top of that, each sip goes down so easily, I find myself reaching for my glass to take another drink without even thinking about it. I'm glad there are five more cans to drink."
"Poured from a cellar temperature can into a goblet. Pours a beautiful dark brown with ruby tones when viewed in front of a light. Next to no head. Smells alcoholic, slightly smoky, somewhat toasted. Carbonation is the first thing I notice in my mouth, followed by smoked bicuity malts and dark toffee flavors. A slight metallic taste is detectable in the aftertaste. Light bodied, there is little coating and very little aftertaste, but overmuch carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, especially from a can, and I can see drinking many in a single sitting."
"A great beer, and definitely not for the weak paleted. It comes in a can which is convenient for many reasons. When poured straight into a 16 ounce mug it forms a nice frothy head and a deep amber-rich body. Since it is a Scotch-Style Ale the caramel and similar sweet flavors compliment the high alcohol percentage. I recommend for anyone that enjoys feeling a nice buzz after only 1 or 2 beers, even for the experienced drinker. Highly recommended."
"Highly drinkable. Overall a very pleasant beer."
"mouthfeel thick with low carbonation. good for sipping, leaving a lasting taste on the palate. i was really surprised by old chub. not because i don't like oskar blues(i'm quickly becoming a fan), but because there are a lot of interesting and rich flavors in here. maybe it's the can that threw me off. either way, this is a great beer, despite looking horrible."
"Overall- I never really got into this style before, but I think i'm gonna have to give a few more a try."
"Overall, a very good example of one of my least favorite styles. I will certainly have this beer again and suggest you add it to your regular rotation as well."
"Overall this was another nice brew from Oskar Blues and a style that I am starting to really enjoy. Thanks again Gar!"
"The feel of this beer is pretty light for what I was expecting and it really rolls off the tongue quite well. Not too heavy but surprisingly refreshing."
"D: Good drinkability. The sweetness doesn't wear on the palate, and the alcohol is masked well enough to make this one slightly dangerous."
"D: a solid beer. recommended."
"Overall, I really like this. I haven't been impressed by too many Scottish style ales, but this one is fantastic. The rumors are true!"
"This is a decent beer. Especially coming from a can. It pours nicely and had a great amber color. Aroma has nice hints of sweet and spicy. The mouthfeel is well rounded. I could drink a couple of these easily. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this beer again. I would recommend letting it fully pour out into a goblet or tulip glass."
"I thought it kind of lost its gusto about halfway through the glass but it's still a winner."
"D: For 8% in a can this stuff is dangerous smooth...."
"It poured into my glass in a a dark brown color with a hint of dark ruby color to it. slight head with a decent amount of lacing left over. Smells of vanilla, caramel, and maltiness with a hint of smokiness. Maltiness up front with peat in between. A nice example of the Scottish style. A decent thickness to the beer almost like soda syrup but not quite so sweet and thick. definitely could enjoy quite a few of these in a row no problem. Thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Love that it comes in a can."
"Very impressed with this. A good beer out of a can - who would of thunk it."
"Drinkability - Very nice. Not sessionable to my tastes, but not all beers need to be."
"The on-tap version compares well with the can, but patience is definitely rewarded as warming from on-tap serving temperature is definitely needed to allow the smoky, peaty maltiness to come through. Feel is great and the drinkability is very good, even at 8% ABV."
"Pours extremely dark with a slight amber tone to it, head starts out strong, then fades to almost nothing. Smells of prunes, alcohol, figs, strong malts and has a sweet aroma that I can't put my finger on. Taste is exceptional. A smoky, slightly sweet and malty concoction that ends with hint of alcohol on the tongue to finish. Mouthfeel seems medium bodied with just a hint of carbonation. Overall, this is an easy drinking scottish ale that packs a punch with the ABV and would also be perfect for packing along on a multiday hike through the mountains."
"d- this definately isn't what i was expecting, i don't know why but i thought this was going to be a lighter beer with some noble hoppage, haha. this definately isn't that, but it's very good none the less, a nice change of pace and my first scottish ale. this sets a nice bar for other scottish to stand up to."
"Dark, deep brown with reddish garnet hues. Not much head or carbonation. Very sweet malty smell. Alcohol is presant with not much hops coming out. Thick sweet malted milk ice cream maltiness. Some caramel, toffee, bitter chocolate flavors. Roasted burnt coffee bitterness shows up as it warms. There is a hard boozy alchohol bite at the end. Not really any bitterness from the hops that I can detect. It's the malts all the way. Very full bodied mouthfeel. Maybe not the best flavors I've come across, but I really enjoyed drinking this beer. Great winter beer. It makes me want to crack open another one and sit outside in the eight degree weather. I think I might."
"D - I like it. And it comes in a can, so it is extra drinkable."
"Pours dark brown, appearing nearly black in the glass. One finger of tan head, but it dies down fairly quickly leaving just a ring and a spot of lace. Aroma of caramel, figs, brown sugar, hazelnut, and some spiciness. Tastes of caramel and nutty malts with a spicy, almost clovelike twist. Figs and grapes on the midpalate and a spicy cookielike finish. Body is somewhat heavy with a medium level of carbonation that fits. Overall moderately tasty with lots of spicy nutty malts."
"D: Very solid scotch ale, wish this was available locally as it seems to be a great value. Extremely drinkable for its ABV."
"Drinkability: I generally don't go for the sweeter beers as I'm a bit more of a hop head, but this is quite good. It's sweet, but not to the point where I feel like my teeth are going to rot out of my skull. That being said, I don't think I could drink too many of these in a row as the sweetness would just get to me. I would definitely recommend this one if you like the sweeter beers, but even if that isn't your thing it is worth a try."
"Dark brown with ruby/mahogany highlights, really no head to speak of. I did pour it pretty lacksidaisically. Pretty sweet smell of bready, smokey malt and caramel. Just an inundation of sweet malts in the taste. You get a little smokiness with maybe some dark dried fruits, but it's tough to discern. There's some boozy alcohol present in the finish as well. It was odd popping open a can with little apparent carbonation. It had a pretty smooth feel and appropriate carbonation, but fell a little flat toward the end of the glass. I will admit that it did take a while to finish though. I've only had this style a few times and I've never been a real fan so it's tough for me to judge whether or not it's a good example of the style."
"Oskar Blues is a winner - can or not. This beer ages very well and obviously in the packaging travels quite well. An excellent example of sweeter Scottish Wee Heavy style. This and Skullsplitter I believe are particularly great strong and sweet Scottish ales."
"Solid brew, but not outstanding."
"D- it took awhile to finish, and isn't my favorite style but i could see where others would like this"
"D=definitely drinkable, good beer overall, sweetness is not over the top."
"As I said, this is as good example of the style as I've had before, just not particularly a style I seek and savour. Thanks to biegaman for this pre-Christmas treat, I enjoyed it with the hockey game going on in one room and my wife summoning me every quarter hour to bring another box of decorations up from the cellar!"
"D - Easy to sip... a bit too easy to drink. This is one I will look for again... perhaps it will become a staple in my fridge."
"looks like coca cola and like nougat apple toastiness. the palate is mildly smokey with a toasty malt. a bit of nut and a bit of sour apple quality. malt character of apple pie with a wonderful body that give the beer a range of toasty crust, sour, sweet apple and herbal nutmeg. nice mix and a wonderful taste out of a can."
"Overall, I enjoy this greatly. I have not had a significant number of scotch ales but this demonstrates a great level of complexity on the nose and the palate with an excellent balance. It's getting rave reviews for a reason, so drink up."
"Overall this beer isn't bad, but the sweetness of it just covers up all the complexity to me that is lying underneath. I can still tell it is there, but you have to search for it. Seems like some people are crazy over this one, but just not my cup of tea, while not bad just seems like this could be better."
"Moderate to full body, pretty sweet. Really good full flavor on this beer. Completely covers your mouth and tongue. Very low bitter, sweetness up front. Drinkability high, mouthfeel high, second taste is really smooth, sweetness backs off. Overall this is a really nice easy drinking malty beer without being a malt bomb. Overall, really good, definitely a repeat."
"Overall, this is another great brew from Oskar Blues. Nice robust flavor that lives up to the style. I haven't had too many Scottish ales, but I'd have to say that this is currently my favorite."
"I have to try more from these Oskar Blues folk. So far they have not disappointed."
"""Shower the people you Chub with Chub"" reads the bottom of the can, hilarious. Pours a beautiful dark brown amber that I can barely see through. The head was a very nice and tight tan, about two fingers thick. Smell was rich and malty, and a lot of chocolate, which I found surprising. Smells thick and syrupy like a Scottish ale should. Taste is rich in sweet malts and chocolate, a pretty nice caramel presence as well. Brown sugar lingers on the tongue. Taste is quite nice. Nice and thick and malty on the mouthfeel, low carbonation only accentuates this. Pretty drinkable beer, but quite filling and with a high abv this one may be dangerously smooth."
"Good mild scoth ale. 60 schillings maybe?"
"The aroma and taste improve things quite a bit. Old Chub smells of dark fruits and alcohol. The sweet fruityness from the aroma carries through in the taste, with flavors of dried cherries and prunes. Compared to the aroma, the flavor is not so boozy initially. The alcohol is certainly there, however, and the alcohol heat comes through, especially as the beer warms. Despite a decent mouthfeel, this increasing booziness makes this one a sipper for sure."
"Notes - An excellent Scottish style ale. The only complaint, a minor one, is that the alcohol aftertaste inhibits the drinkability a bit. Overall, though, a great way to satisfy any malt craving."
"Pours a dark, ruddy brown, some nice lacing from a decent head. Later, no head. The aroma makes clear this is a thick, malty beer. The taste is just lovely. Thick and malty, toffee and chocolate underline the malt base, some bitterness after the middle, but very even keeled. The mouth is muscular, but doesn't amass on the tongue while drinking. I brought this back from a trip down south, and damn, I wish I bought more. This is a great beer."
"D- really enjoyed this drink, especially as it warmed. could really see myself working into the rotation. since it comes in a can, going to take it on our camping trip this week and offer it to the guys."
"Good beer."
"D - It's becoming more cloying as it goes on. The balance from the bitterness of the roasted malts hardly makes up for the lingering sweetness of the malts. A good Scotch ale though. One is enough but a good beer for a malt-lover."
"Taste also is clearly a wee heavy, pretty good, solid character, drinkable and not harshly alcoholic or bitter. It is mostly sweet, rummy, darkly caramelised prunes and other fruit, a bit spicey with a faint, toasty-leathery-earthiness underneath. Ultimately, it ends up being a bit bland and one-dimensional in character, with a smooth but dominant, sweet rummy quality and no real complexity. It has a little oiliness but reall yht body is rather light and almost watery for the most part, making the oiliness a stick-to-the-back-of-the-tongue margarine character, which is not entirely successful in my book. It's good, solid, but not at all great."
"Nice brew overall. The taste was very nice, and fairly complex."
"The body does seema tad watery, I would expect more fo a ""fullness", but overall I feel the beer is a great Scottish ale, overpoweringly malty, no hops that I could detect and pretty much no smoky presence which I can appreciate, since I've had one too many smoky sottish style ales."
"3.5 D: The sticky body and sweetness can be cloying. I'd only want one of these in a sitting."
"Overall: Great beer. I really enjoy this style."
"This is my gold standard for Scottish ales, I will find a newer can to compare."
"This probably would be last among the OB beers that I would choose to buy, but with their stellar line up that isn't a bad problem to have."
"The malty finish combined with the gravity are very close to a true Scottish Ale."
"Old Chub is, for my money, the champion of canned beers...if someone poured this opaque scotch ale/porter into a pint, you never think for a minute that it was from a can. Lots of chocolate malt and unbelievable drinkability. A must for all beer lovers."
"Overall this is good. Nice and solid. I almost have to give extra points for being a good beer in a can. Sampled it at the Durham World Beerfest and didn't recall it being quite this good. I could rotate this in with some of my standards for everyday drinking."
"Cheers!"
"D: Haven't had this style but I'm really enjoying it. Not great on the nose or eyes, but makes up for it on the palate."
"A solid Scotish Ale. Poured from 12 oz can, canned 08/07/09, into tulip glass. Nice dark redish brown with thin off white head. Virtually no lacing. Very sweet brown sugar and caramel malt smell, hints of fresh grass in the background along with a slightly sweet alcoholic burn. Taste is similar to smell. A little syrupy on the tounge like a cherry cough syrup or hard candy. this makes it a little low on the drinkability side for me."
"Cheers!"
"I still get a kick out of drinking fine craft beer from a can and Old Chub is no exception to the rule. Full and warming, I could easily drink a few of these in a pleasant evening with friends in front of a fire. A few would be all you need to develop a warm fuzzy feeling!"
"overall a nice scottish ale...im not a scottish ale fan but this rocked...oskar blues continues to impress me..."
"Feel and Drinkability: This is an easy drinking beer, especially for one that's 8%. This could be a very dangerous beer as the alcohol is hidden extremely well...nix that it is completely hidden. Full body with just the right feel and amount of carbonation. Everything is in check for this beer, I don't really think that there's much more I'd want from it. Pick it up, if ya can. I just wish that Oskar Blues was a regular choice of mine and not something I had to go hundreds of miles to get."
"Really attractive pour. Decent lace and nice gold dust cascading effect when the glass is tilted. Nice and malty this was a cross between a wee heavy and a Christmas Ale that was well spiced. Butterscotch showed prominently in the aroma and taste as well as vanilla, caramel, toffee, cinnamon and nutmeg. Lacking the nutty character which I appreciated. Very nice creamy and perfectly carbonated mouthfeel. Alcohol was extremely well hidden."
"D: I'm not a big fan of the style, and I don't think this one is particularly drinkable"
"Drinkablity: Delectable brew. The size of the can allows this brew to be an everyday drinker. It allows you to drink a big brew in a smaller format. Very easy to drink and enjoy."
"Drinkability- Excellent. Great, refreshing flavor leaves me wanting a lot more."
"Drinkablity is very good for the style as the alcohol is not particularly powering. I wouldn't say it would be a session beer, but I could see myself having a couple at a time. Very rich and pleasant."
"D- Overall a very nice brew that I wish was more readily available to me."
"this beer is as drinkable as any 8% beer ive ever had not named pliny. considering the style and the malt package involved here (as malts typically detract from drinkability IMO) this beer could be more drinkable than pliny."
"While Scottish Ales of all sizes have grown on me significantly, I still find Old Chub overly sweet and lacking complexity. The beer pours a darkened umber with a dissipating head. The aroma is malty with some spice and a fairly strong cola character. It's mildly vinous with a strong alcohol note. The flavor is malt forward without much hop character but a fairly strong bitter note. There are some roasted malt flavors present and a strong caramelized cola flavor. It's just too sweet, though. The feel is a lot thinner than I would like. It's not awful, but there are much better Scotch Ales out there."
"Notes: The apparent lack of carbonation really hurts this beer, in my humble opinion, of course. The appearance is very underwhelming, the aroma is good but rather weak, and the flavor is a little more shallow than I would like in a Scotch Ale. Over-carbonation is a bad thing, especially with a Scotch Ale, but a beer this still just fails to bring the flavors to life. Not bad, but not great."
"D - good, but personally i could only handle 12-24 oz of this rich and heavy thing here. not a session brew. that said, these 12 oz. were quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability was really good for being as heavy and sweet as it is. It finished nice enough to easily drink a few. No signs of ABV."
"Pours a deep brown color with a slight head. The aroma is of caramel, coffee, toffee, and dark chocolate malts. The taste is much of the same the caramel forms the backbone with the coffee, toffee, and dark chocolate rounding out the flavor. The flavor mask the alcohol very well. There is a little bitterness in the middle that i wasn't expecting though. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall its an okay drinkable beer, the smell and taste are good, but that middle part through me off."
"12oz. Pours a deep reddish-brown color with a foamy tan head that held decent retention and left some decent lacing on the glass as well. Aromas and tastes were malty and sweet - brown sugar, butterscotch, and toffee with a hint of molasses and maybe some ripened fruit - cherry perhaps. Alcohol is also fairly present and prickles the tongue and slightly burns the throat on the way down. Overall, nothing wrong here - good example of the style, just didn't really have that wow factor I was hoping for."
"I found no evidence of its 8% ABV whatsoever. Loved this beer, and would make a great session brew regardless of alcohol."
"Highly drinkable, even though it's not my favorite style - I'd really love to enjoy this one on tap."
"Color is similar to that of a Belgian dubbel and there's a similar fruity malt sweetness aroma going on here. Head retention is surprisingly high for a canned beer. This is just a malt monster...chewy, bready, some alcohol soaked fruit flavors, most prominently cherry. Some brandy characteristics. It has a very well developed malt character. No balance here at all. This is for malts what WCDIPAs are for hops. Killer."
"Out of the can, this beer appears dark brown with red highlights. The initial head calms to a very light layer on the surface. Wow, the scent reminds me of a barrel aged beer, even though this is not. Lots of sweet malts, vanilla, chocolate, smoke, wood, and even leather in the nose. No hops that I can detect. The flavor is a recap of the aroma with plenty of bourbon vanilla and wood. Some nuttiness. What is the difference between scotch ale and scotch-style ale? All I know is that this one reigns supreme. Superb value to boot!"
"Notes: I enjoyed finding this and drinking it from a can, which I believe more craft beers should be presented in."
"D: I liked the sweet tangy fruit play with roasty toffee type flavors and then a bit of whiskey alcohol. I thought it was well done. I am not a huge fan of this style but this brew was enjoyable. I really need to drink this style in the winter time to get into the spirit of it."
"Overall this beer is wonderful and for the price it can't be beat. Goes great with Chocolate Cake!!"
"Extremely drinkable; possibly the best scottish ale I've tasted. I wish we could get it in Ohio."
"Ok, I'm back. Another sip, and my palate is crushed. White flag is waiving. Some outstanding Old Chub and some EPIC sugarfest known as peach cobbler. DONE."
"Ok, I for one miss McEwans, a scotch ale that will always be the benchmark for all scotch ales to be judged against. Old Chubb is the closest you'll come to find that McEwan's spiciness and alcohol tang. Smoky and syrup sweet, very malty. Wonderful taste. Nice body too. Here's a tip too, if you like a nice head you must this one directly down the center of the glass. Oskar Blues has had some issues with me in the past, but they've out done themselves in customer service! Recommended."
"To me, this is the pinnacle of a Scottish Style ale. Highly recommend."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another if it was less sweet on the opening"
"(but don't drink it out of the can..it is too pretty)"
"I'm not going to go into great length here as most of what I'm gonna say has already been said. This is the best Scottish Ale I've had in a long time. I put off buying this as I was a bit apprehensive but I think I've found my new go to sweet malty beer. The appearance is darker than most of it's kind and it has a great malty sweet smell. The flavor is of malt and sweet brown sugar. It has a great mouthfeel for it's style with just thre right amount of carbonation. The 8% really creeps up on you but I could see myself drinking 2 or 3 of these in a night. The only thing keeping me from giving it all 5s was the fact that it was a bit one dimensional."
"I could easily tear through a 6 pack of this beer. With a lighter body this beer could easily turn from a sipper to a chugger. Be careful and respect this brew. This beer met my expectations and I will absolutely be back for more. In fact, I think im going to grab another one right now.... I like the whole ""can"" concept. I cant wait to try the Ten Fiddy..."
"Drinkability: A darker sessionable beer. I'll say that, its not astringent nor intense. Perhaps not what I'd cool off on a hot day but a drinkable dark beer minus the higher alcohol content. I don't know if I'd buy it again due to the price but its cool that its in can."
"Another winner from Oskar Blues. I haven't had too many Scottish Ales so I can't do much comparing, but as another excellent edition to Oskar Blues' lineup, this makes me eager to try more from them."
"This is a drinkable beer for this ABV. Not overly smokey or boozy for the style which helps it. All of Oskar Blues beers that I have had, contain this really sweet maltiness that I really dig. Another solid, well done beer from OB."
"Great beer - very pleased. Not to the mention the very well hidden 8.0% ABV."
"(actually goes good with BBQ chicken!)"
"Overall, this is an excellent beer...and in a can! It tastes great, goes down easy, and is incredibly drinkable."
"D- Takes a while to drink (must sip), but very enjoyable throughout."
"Thanks to Smitty on this one, and the Scottish Chub Bomb (think an Irish Car Bomb using Old Chub instead of Guinness)."
"D- While this beer is wonderful, I think I couldn't get past two cans in one sitting... its just too rich."
"This beer was stunningly good with a homemade dark-chocolate icing donut."
"D: the sweet and boozy strong points are counterpointed by the almost too smooth texture"
"Drinkability: Moderate to high. I've always been a fan of this style, and this one doesn't disappoint."
"Drinkability: Moderately high - it's a fine tasting beer with a smooth character in the profile and mouthfeel that are pretty hard to beat. The ABV is a tad high, but still where it should be for the style and it's not too overwhelming, but it definitely sneaks up a bit."
"Great taste from a can, good idea, kudos to the brewery for using cans."
"Old Chub is a pretty solid example of the style, hitting the mark with the nice balance of dark malty goodness and a muted hope response. My only complaint is I'd like a bit more smokiness to be present. Still, it's a good brew worth trying."
"Should probably be called a Strong Scotch, rather than a Scottish Ale."
"Dark pour with less than a finger of head. Smells of sweet malts with a floral hop background. Caramel malts dominate the flavor profile, true to the style I suppose but not necessarily enjoyable. There is an odd taste that I can't put my finger on, it is very similar to a taste in Gordon that I didn't like. Kind of like faded hops and crayons (tough to describe). Something about this brewery's beers is just not right. Ten FIDY was just fine but I have not been impressed at all by this, Gordon, or Dale's Pale Ale."
"Pours a dark red with gread head retention and lacing throughout the glass. Smell is caramel, malts, faint floral aromas, piny hops. Taste is very caramelly. Mouthfeel is thick, juicy, buttery, creamy, full. Drinkability is good for this one as well."
"Overall, a nice offering from OB. On par with the Dale's Pale."
"Poured dark garnett which really came through in the sunlight. Brownish crown of a head that dissipated quickly but laced down the glass. Very caramelly on the nose with some cocoa in the mix and plenty of malt. Tasked very much the same with a bit more malt on the tongue than the nose. Just enough light carbonation and eminently drinkable."
"Dark amber color, can't tell head since I am swilling straight out of the can. Big malt presence in the nose, mirrored in the tastebuds, where the sweetness is a bit overwhelming at first, but get used to by the bottom of the can, with hops barely noticeable. Not an overabundance of carbonation. Pretty drinkable for the alcohol. A pleasant surprise"
"Very creamy and sweet, quite malty. Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: This is a high abv beer, but I think it does hide its alcohol well. This is a malt bomb and is traditional to the style. One of the better Scotch ales that I have had that was not on tap. I could have several."
"quite dark, with a fingers worth of head that kind of sits around and lingers. smell is dark malts with a faint hint of the booze coming through. some dark fruits in the nose too. taste is a bit cloying through the finish until a coffee bitterness comes out and tames it a bit. body is thick and creamy. some raisin flavor comes through on the taste too as it warms. mouthfeel is quite nice on this one. despite it's 8% i'd have no problem polishing off quite a few of these. it does have a bit of heat from the booze, but nothing unmanageable."
"Bottom line: Old Chub's one I'll definitely get again."
"D - WAY too easy to pound these. Sweet malty goodness covers up the 8% almost too well."
"I've had this in the can as well as on draft. Creamy beige head with little to no lacing. Smell is sweet malt, chocolate and vanilla. Taste is very sweet with lots of chocolate flavor dominating. Finishes smooth and sweet and feels very thick in the mouth. Easy to drink with the alcohol masked nicely."
"I would definitely buy this again, although preferably in the fall when it fits the season better."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer and at about 1 dollar per 12 oz it is a great deal. This is easily the best canned brewery I have had. Oskar = Metal."
"Overall this is a so-so Scotch Ale and not high on my list. The plus is it's in a can and very portable if you like this style."
"Full bodied with little carbonation. The flavor is sweet and for some reason reminds me of a fig and port sauce I once had. There is some very nice malt, not much in the way of hop flavor or bitterness and no real complexity, but the subdued sweetness is right on for the style. All in all this is a very good beer for the style."
"Notes: I did not really write a long review on this beer,but was this really from a can!!! I would not have believed it,but I cracked the can open so it is true. Really smooth and rich. ABV well masked. I loved the balance of sweetness,smokiness and malts."
"D: The ABV is incredibly hidden with this one. It goes down easy due to its sweet taste."
"Poured into a glass, I was able to avoid nasty can taste making its way into this one, and I can completely appreciate it having some from the can."
"Drinkability: Wish I had a few more of these. No, wait, I don't. I've got to do homework. Fuck homework! I wanna drink Old Chub! But there aren't anymore Old Chubs. Damn. Yeah, it's kinda like that."
"Despite the nice flavors, the carbonation problem made this one hard to finish. I would definitely give this brew another chance, though, based on its reputation."
"Overall, another solid offering from Oskar Blues. This beer simply lacked in complexity and seemed to accentuate certain parts of the beer that maybe shouldn't have. Despite all this, a great Colorado brew."
"Not a bad brew, but definitely not one I'd drink several of in a session. Loved the burnt copper/reddish appearance with nice lacing and a good foamy head. Smell was of peat moss, smoke and tinge of alcoholic aroma. Taste was almost overpowering, a little on the sweet/malty side for my tastes, but still a good sipping brew."
"So, either my tastes have changed; my palate was in a different shape or I just got a better can."
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this - I'm usually a love or hate kinda guy when it comes to Wee Heavy, and I had no idea if Oskar Blues would ""americanize"" their take on it. Well, this one is pretty much true to style, and I love it. Great mouthfeel on this one, with a bold maltiness that is not over the top (or overly sweet). It does seem a tad boozy, but it's not harsh, and the aroma is a little weak, but these are minor quibbles. I've only tasted their hoppy beers, so it really impressed me to see them pull off a malt-bomb so well."
"D- Started off as a sipper but about a third of the way into it I found myself picking up the pace. Definitely could go for a couple in a sitting."
"It's been a while since I've had this beer and I'm glad I had it again. This is one of my more favorite styles and this will become a more regular items seen in my fridge."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, a smooth alcohol presences, and very chewy. The body of the beer is very thick and heavy. The finish on the beer is medium to medium full. The nice finish of the beer lingers on the palate for a moment to relish the flavor. This is a very nice strong tasting Scottish Ale. The beer has a wonderful flavor and it has a very strong dense malt complex with the taste of scotch. I enjoyed it."
"D: very easily drinkable, the flavor is really good, no alcohol taste, etc"
"Color is a deep rich copper color with a small beige head. Aroma is pure malt with not much hop aroma. Flavor is a rich caramel malt bomb. High alcohol but not overpowerering but definently warming. Taste has nice hoppiness at finish. This full bodied beer has a clean crisp feel. One of the most drinkable canned beers I've had."
"D: Very drinkable; However, the alcohol really leaves a mark after a while. Left me with a somewhat uncomfortable headache the entire night."
"The can looks sketchy, and it is very easy to pass this up, but do yourself a favor and try this!"
"Drinkability: Tremendously drinkable at 8%. I would pretty much give this beer to anybody who can stand a beer beyond macros."
"Blipped ""Stoned in the Bathroom"" by Chubby Checker"
"Body is a little heavier than medium. Very sticky. Coats the mouth nicely. Low carbonation is appropriate. Not a single hint of the 8% ABV."
"D - A nice dark beer with good flavor. Could have a few of these."
"A nice take on the style. Oskar Blues shows once again that they have brass balls by canning larger styles. Not recommended for anything but sitting by a nice warm fire and sipping out of a pint glass."
"D: Hells yeah. Cheers!"
"Big, big, malty brew, as it should be. Not much head or lacing, and very lightly carbonated, despite being in a can. Taste is really nice. Sweet, high malts, chewey caramel and decent hops which round out the brew at the end. But slightly unexciting in a way. I usually do not say this, but this beer needs more carbonation."
"d: This is almost an imperial Scottish ale. Not bad, but not something I'd look for again."
"This is a must try for any beer geek."
"Wow, one solid Scotch ale brew from a can. A few of these can be put back with ease me thinks. Good stuff."
"Overall, a very good beer, I just wish there were more smoke, but it does fit the style."
"good stuff. bought it @ wholefoods after trying @ a local bar. no need for stupid descriptive words. it's a good beer...not THE greatest. but, it definitely is good. (here is filler beause there isn't a need to describe past 250 characters)...try also dale's pale ale...one of it's brethren. - word"
"Creamy and very drinkable! I could probably put down a sixer of this, if it wasnt for the high alcohol."
"Pours dark brown with light brown head. Nose is caramel sweet with smoky components, and a slight bready character. Body is somewhat thin, surprisingly, but malt and smoke flavors are in force. A nice malty, smokey beer. Finish has a touch of wood, and alcohol is subdued."
"A nice Scottish one here. It's got some good malt, and some nice flavors, but nothing spectacular. Very enjoyable, but kind of forgettable."
"Feels thick and heavy (but not syrupy) in the mouth. Nice beer -- one of my favorite Scotch styles."
"D: Overall, I find this to be a very rich and delicious malt dominated brew. Skillfully crafted with a nice depth of flavors that all complement each other well. As a side note, I wonder about the style classification mostly because of the high (8%) abv, but on second thought, who cares about labels. It is good beer no matter what you call it. I would certainly recommend this to anyone, especially those who prefer predominately malty beers."
"Notes: Overall I've been impressed with Oskar Blues' offerings, and this beer is no exception. To be honest, though, since this beer is a seasonal and it comes out around the same time as Ten FIDY, I see no real reason to purchase this beer over Ten FIDY unless you're a big fan of Scotch Ales. This beer is a little too sweet for me to buy too often, but it's still a good showing from a good, and innovative, brewery."
"D - Easy fella, this beer packs quite a punch! At 8% abv, this one goes down almost too easy. It has a nice sweet malt taste, but is kept in check by just the right amount of hops. I have not had much Scottish Ales, but this one sure was tasty."
"Rich, smokey, dark malts, dried fruits and a slightly sweet creamy finish with low carbonation."
"Cheers."
"D - Outstanding...I think that the intensity of the flavors would limit the amount that you could actually consume, but boy does it go down nice...and you can't beat the value of this beer - just over $30/case"
"It's also nice to see an unbelievable world class beer at a very reasonable price (about $3.50 a can)."
"D= Pretty good. I liked it. Thank you Natasha for the delicious brew. Very impressed with the sweetness from it almost like drinking candy."
"Medium body, light carbonation. Goes down relatively easy at first, but drinkability slows as more goes down. Clean, somewhat watery mouth."
"D: Delicious scottish ale, and an excellent beer out of a can. This is a great beer to have indoors on a snowy day. High ABV/alcohol warmth keeps the drinking of these limited, but it is quite a great beer."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass..Pours a dark brown with a small spotty head and good lacing. Aroma is definitely heavy on the peaty and smoke aspects. Traces of caramel and toast. Flavor is better balanced with deep chocolate flavors and more caramel, but the presence of smoke and wood is still there. Finishes with a deeper and more well rounded wood taste, followed by a linger earthy buttery hop flavor in the mouth. The best part of this beer is how smooth the flavors are. I thought the peat was too pokey in the aroma, but the chocolate notes round it very nicely in the taste."
" Great malty ale, out of a can. Worth at least trying once. Great price for a sixer of eight percent ale. Would and have bought repeatedly."
"Pours almost black with red colors coming through and a decent beige colored head. Sweet caramel malts and hop scents. No surprise in the flavor....very sweet caramel flavors mixed with flowery hops. The sweet caramel malt flavors are very thick and intense. After a while they do get to be too much. The beer finished nicely with sweet warm alcohol and hop flavors. Reminds me of a caramel sugar daddy candy bar."
"D: again well crafted but a little too intense for me"
"Poured a mahogany-brown, with just a slight beige head. Caramel sweetness on the nose. The taste is what one would expect from the style - malty. Carbonation is barely there, but the beer is heavy enough that it's not missed. If I'm in the mood for a Scottish-style ale, I'd drink it again."
"Not bad if you're in the mood for something really sweet. The malts are delicious, but that candy-like brown sugar sweetness really hurts the drinkablility. I might be able to do two, but then I'd be looking for a good APA or IPA."
"Drink ability is very good. Tasty scotch ale, not too much on the alcohol side. Would have been nice to get a good head of foam but its not that much of a problem"
"I poured this guy into a glass to see what I was in for. I reccommend those of you who have not tried old chub to do the same. It held a nice frothy head a first. Some lacing was present on the glass. There was a very nice aroma. I was reminded of choclate covered cherries and cinnamon. In terms terms of taste, this is a big beer. Old chub is all about malt! This beer is full bodied and would make a fine dessert!"
"A very enjoyable malt bomb of a beer, I loved it."
"Even though it's a seasonal, the beer will stay pretty fresh for a long time at 8%. I think I will stock up on this beer"
"Dark brown with a one finger tan head. Good amount of lacings. Aroma is smokey sweet malts. Taste is dark smokey malts with enough earthy hops to keep it from being too cloying. A bit of molasses creeps in as the tasting continues. The mouthfeel is quite good with adequete carbonation. Initially thought the abv was excessive but it is needed to cut the thick body of the ale. Most drinkable Scotch Ale I've had. Canned on date indicates this is about two months old. There are some minor comparisons to Scotch whisky. If there was ever a session Scotch Ale this would be it. Very nice can label art."
"Pretty easy to drink despite the ABV%, very flavorful and all around a nice beer."
"For an 8% Scottish Ale, I'll give this decent marks on drinkability."
"D: This is a great beer to have laying around for the winter months. Easy to drink, develops some complexity as it warms, and the packaging makes this a great camping beer."
"Mouthfeel for this is rich, thick and creamy. Its a very easy drinking Scottish Ale at 8%."
"Sixer from the co-op (this review is for the 2nd and 3rd cans out of the pack). Pours a nice dark brown with a reasonably large brown head that settles off after a while. Smells of big peaty malt, strong and smokey, with a big alcohol presence. A bit sweeter and drier than i prefer, but the level of peatiness is impressive....its a peat-attack! Chalky, some prunes and dates come through as it warms. Medium to full bodied. An interesting beer...very aggressive with the peat and quite sweet and fruity, but it never really all comes together for me. I like it, but at the same time it leaves me a bit confused."
"Pours a dark dark brownish colored body, with a good sized head, lasting, tannish in color, and with some good lacing. Has a malty and alcoholy aroma. Decent tasting, but I am not a fan of the sweet maltiness. A little too much for me, I don't know if it's the alcohol taste or what."
"D - It needs to be less sweet or more bitter. Could use more complexity."
"I could drink this all night long but I think the 8.0% would catch up to me. This is amazing stuff and should be searched out by any beer fan. CHUB IS A JOYRIDE!!!"
"D 3.0 - I am new to the Scottish Ale Style, but this seems right on for the description. It's not very drinkable for my preference but a good rep for the style - so it gets a 3.0 on drinkability for me. I scored appropriately on all other categories."
"Overall, a great beer."
"Can't even believe something this good comes without the use of a bottle opener."
"D: Very drinkable. I could enjoy this frequently. Hopefully I will."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. One sip follows another easily and I could easily repeat for another. I like this Scottish ale and will be getting more on a regular basis."
"A good brew, I am quite enjoying it. A good after dinner sipper from a can. Who would have guessed."
"A nicely balanced malt bomb."
"Old Chub is a clear dark red ale with a bubbly beige head that fades and leaves nice lacing. It has a deep, semi-sweet, malty aroma that has notes of bread and spicy resin. It is full bodied and very smooth. It's pillowy soft with a slick finish that's a little syrupy. This beer is pretty sweet, but balanced with a little resiny bitterness. There is peppery alcohol in the taste. A rumbly sweet aftertaste lingers. It's quite boozy and quite pleasing."
"Overall- Great beer, very drinkable with lots of nice flavors. I could enjoy a few of these."
"Pours a hazy, reddish-brown color with almost no head. A little ring of tan carbonation sits around the edge of the glass. The smell is still really great. An incredible caramelly sweetness arrives first, then comes this bready, toasty smell. There's a little whiff of a chocolate and roasted coffee. Almost no hops to be found, but there is kind of an earthiness to it - like dirt and fallen leaves, smoky kind of. The taste delivers as well. Big malty sweetness, backed with bitter roasted coffee. The alcohol is hard to detect, but leaves a pleasant little burn. The smokiness kind of cling to your mouth, and just builds and builds, without ever reaching the burnt weeny level. The smokiness really balances out the sweetness, but I think the roasty bitterness and smokiness eventually overpower because of how they linger so much longer. Very complex and pleasant. This one is so thick and chewy, and actually well-carbonated, a bit prickly with the alcohol burn, despite not having much of a head. The clinging flavors are nice, but get annoying after a while. This one has a bit more alcohol than I'd expect. It's tough to handle more than one (though I did shotgun one without flinching a week ago). I figure anyone interested in a more malty, smoky beer should get their hands on it."
"The nose, in my opinion is dominated by the metalliness, and its gonna cost it a big score."
"Easy to drink, smooth, a well hidden 8 percent brew, an excellent canned offering."
"Overall: Very easy to drink! A lot of malt flavor and smell. Not much alcohol presence. As it warms the caramel malts start to become more prevalent."
"The beer poured a dark mahogany with a tan head. The aroma was just straight up sweet malt. The taste was very nice but was simply overly sweet malt. The feel was heavy and wet. A nice try at a Scottish Ale, I'll probably have some more as I love the style and it's rare to find it on tap, but it won't get me to pass up Bellhaven's for Old Chubb."
"S- i wouldn't drink a whole lot of this in a night. however, if i am craving a scotch ale, i will definitely return to this one."
"D&M: From all of Oskar Blues' beers I have tried so far, I would say this is my favorite. This brew is a sheer joy to sip at cellar temp. It's very complex, but maintains a high level of drinkability. One thing Oskar Blues did a good job of was not overdoing the smoked malt character of this brew. It's there, but instead of drowning out the other flavors, it adds a nice complex character to this great interpretation of a Scottish Style Ale."
"Glad to have finally tried this one."
"sweetness and herbal qualities may get in the way of drinking more than one or two at a time, but good as a balance to meaty dishes, especially lamb or game."
"Poured from the can a deep though not opaque brown with reddish highlights at the edges of the glass. Head was less than a quarter of an inch and quickly dissipated. In the nose is mainly roasty malt, cola, what I assume is peat, and a little alcohol. I get many flavors from the taste, including cocoa, caramel, cola, and an earthiness. The mouthfeel is full and sticky, with some alcohol in the finish. On the whole, this is a nice, though not standout, beer."
"Why have I not had this beer in so long? It is soo good. Pours dark brown with some amber highlights. Nice brownish head, sticky lacing. A little bit dirty smelling, sweet peety malts. A lot of maltiness in the flavor. Peetiness. Smooth creaminess. Silky and smooth mouthfeel. So easy to drink, dangerous with an 8% ABV, but worth anything it throws at you. Delicious."
"One and a half fingers of creamy brown and tan head almost fills the glass to the rim, resting above a dark reddish-brown brew. Retention is ok, and a thin sheet of lace is left behind as the froth settles into a paper thin covering. Aroma involves a big hit of toasted malts up front. Right behind that exists some caramel notes, some candy (perhaps licorice and bubblegum). Tastes of roasted grains, earthy spice, subtle sweets, and a very slight, but noticeable hop bitterness. The alcohol is evident in the aftertaste, but not overwhelming. Although the mouth-feel is thick and creamy it has just enough viscosity to keep it from approaching chewiness. There's not much carbonation to speak of. Oskar Blues has taken a not so notable style (at least in America) and produced a great beer with lots of style and character."
"Drinkability is a bit limited as the peat is big (but not unpleasant)."
"D - A decent brew, but nothing spectacular. Enjoyable but not something that will be calling my name in the fridge. A nice, smooth sipper."
"Poured this into a glass and it poured a very attractive chestnut brown with a thin head and speedy lacing. The nose was pretty much sweet malts and light alcohol tones. The flavor was of sweet malts, cream soda and a cedar-like finish. Thick and full bodied with medium carbonation. A great barleywine lovers camping brew."
"Mouthfeel is rich, complex, and just plain great. Alcohol provides a great warmth, but is controlled. At 8% this brew is dangerously drinkable, goes down far too easily. Damn good beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium and nicely carbonated, and considering ABV and style, drinkability is pretty great."
"D: Despite its strength and strong character, this is a very enjoyable and drinkable beer. I could have several in a row with no problems."
"Taste is mostly reflected in the aroma. The balance is amazing. Bitterness comes mostly from the roasted malt rather than the hops. Certainly not too sweet. Mouthfeel is light to medium for the style. Very easy to drink with low/soft carbonation."
"This is a standout beer and one of my top rated beers for style."
"If Oskar came in mix-packs I'd have maybe one of these in a sixer. Or every other sixer - it's a nice change of pace but not something I'd want all the time."
"Drinkability: A great beer, and a fine scotch ale. At 8% ABV I will only be having one or two, but thoroughly enjoying each sip. Oskar Blues is a great brewery, glad they are in Texas."
"D: Hides the alcohol well, though the sweetness would keep me from more than a couple."
"Aftertaste throws this off a bit."
"A little too sweet for me- just a malt overload. Granted, this is coming from a hophead, but I have been known to enjoy some doppelbocks in the past. The mouthfeel is a bit too much combined with the malts. Granted, the malts are fairly complex but they weren't having me reach for another can. The taste followed what was prefaced in the aroma almost completely. Nice to try, maybe I will have to revisit it down the road."
"D: This one tastes good and is just very appealing across the board. Nothing wrong with this beer from a can. It's bold and big without being difficult to drink in any way."
"My choice for sipping on the slopes after (and in between) hitting up the mountain. Cans fit perfect in the snowboard jacket, and abv is just enough to give a little warmth. Oskar Blues scores again."
"Overall this is a surprisingly good beer. It was recommended to me by the bartender and I really enjoyed it. I would give this a try even if you don't typically enjoy the chocolate/caramel tasting beers."
"D - Delicious, with alcohol well-hidden. Probably my favorite Oskar Blues beer."
"D, notes: Full and sweet. This is hands down the best Scotch ale I have had. I could drink this all day despite the booze."
"Mouth: Smokey and roasty, sort of like chocolate-covered bacon (yes it does exist). Subtle dark fruit and cold coffee. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Flavors are bold but not huge, which helps lend a unique drinkability here. Some astringency and some booziness."
"Drinkability - It's not easy for a ""Hop-head"" to admit liking this beer. I'd recommend choosing this or a bowl of ice cream for dessert because it's better than most sweets out there. And what other after dinner treat packs 8% ABV? Great ""Wee Heavy"" example. OB Brewery has another knock-out."
"D: Dangerously drinkable, this one goes down easy and is a beer that has gotten me in trouble many times, it tastes like dessert and is one that can get out of hand quite quickly, excellent beer though!"
"Taste is good, but I kept getting a weird vegetable-like aftertaste. This is a very sweet beer, tons of brown sugar and maple syrup. A bit of chocolate and tons of malt. Not bitter, and definitely a bit of the soy sauce element that I've experienced before with doppelbocks. The alcohol is apparent, but not overpowering. The mouthfeel was excellent, creamy and luscious. Overall this a good ale, but I don't think I'll be buying another 12-pack anytime soon."
"Man, this is a complex Scotch Style ale. Beautiful stuff."
"Drinkability: Alcohol is a bit high for this...ABV is already a high number..but you can just feel the alcohol on this one. Tastes good, but I wouldn't session this. Recommended"
"D: Not my favorite of the style or brewery but I could see this being very drinkable. I wish there was a bit sweetness to it, but oh well its still a very good brew!"
"Syrupy count - 9"
"Not my favorite from Oskar Blues, but worth a try."
"Poured from 12oz. can into my fav pint glass. Pours a beautiful dark chesnut brown with a small head that quickly faded leaving behind some nice lacing. Huge amounts of caramel malts along with some chocolate also detecting a small amount of hop aroma with a little alcohol. Cannot believe this stuff came out of a can big roasty caramel flavors, also a nice smoky chocolaty character. Very sweet but not sryuppy and a nice warming alcohol as you swallow. I could drink a couple of these babies pretty easily. Awesome brew."
"Second Oskar Blues beer for me this evening and this didn't disappoint. Poured a reddish brown with virtually no head. Big malt smell with no hops that I could detect. The taste was sweet and creamy with a nice roasted flavor along with some caramel. Little carbonation with a dry finish. I would have two or three of these over the course of the evening and not be disappointed."
"Pours a mahogany brown color with red highlights. Small off white head and light lacing, with no visibly carbonation bubbles. Smell is fantastic! Nothing but chocolate covered toffee in the nose, the lightest bit of roastiness, and a hint of nuttiness. I love it. Taste is reminiscent of Heath Bars. The rich chocolate and caramel flavors mix nicely and hop bitterness is virtually non-existent. This is a malt bomb to be sure. Thick and creamy feel to this one, almost no carbonation bite at the end, which I'm sort of missing right now. If this beer was carbonated properly it would be a winner for sure! Very drinkable for the high ABV, alcohol is well hidden. I enjoyed sipping on this six pack slowly over the last week. When, oh when can we get Oskar Blues in Minnesota??"
"D. The alcohol is well hidden, thats about all i like about this. Not my type of beer"
"D- this can was a treat. pretty easy to drink and a good representation of the style. something i would buy again if it was available here."
"This poured poured dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light and a very thin off-white head. The aroma was of malty sweetness, but not very dominant. The taste was of caramel and peat. It was sticky sweet, but so very smooth and easy-drinking. Did not seem like it was 8%abv to me, as I could easily drink a few of these. I really enjoyed this one."
"Overall, a solid beer. Give me more. This would be a optimal beer to take hiking/camping trip, and the best scotch ale I've had in can, hands down!"
"Drinkability: I wouldnt session this beer. it was tasty but half of it went down the drain. Nice beer for those one a night beers, but I think it needs some food with it. Alcohol comes through too much."
"Nice very dark brown appearance. Small head to start which quickly fades leaving little lacing. Sweet smells with a little but not enough smoke. Some caramel and dark candyish tastes - again not enough peat for the style and maybe a little too sweet. Hides the 8% ABV very well. Medium to full bodied. You could drink a few of these if your a big malt beer guy. For me, one of these a night is enough."
"D: Overall only a slightly above average beer per style and slightly above average drinkability. Much better examples out there."
"Cloying to me, so not very drinkable."
"a good beer overall will enjoy again"
"D: Although this beer is a little on the heavy side, it is still rather drinkable. This is probably due in part to it's flavor, which isn't overbearing and doesn't leave you feeling too full. That said, two of these would probably be my limit. Not a session beer, but it's very tasty!"
"Overall, excellent, and one I would not hesitate to return to."
"Awesome beer and worthy of its ranking."
"D: Not an everyday drinker for me, but Scotch Ales are a bit sweet for my tastes. Definitely a good beer for the winter, though, as it has a very warming effect. I probably wouldn't do more than one, though."
"D - extremely high.. very smooth and sweet."
"D - Real good, wish I could have a few more."
"A great one for the holidays. Given the reasonableness of a six-pack of this in price and availability, this is a great everyday beer."
"Tap @ Pizza Port SB. Pours murky brown with a short off-white head. Peat, molasses, leather, and smoke in the nose. Rich caramel taste with nuts, followed by the peat/smoke and a bitter finish. Kind of chewy ending. Good stuff. Heard that it is just as good out of the can."
"Pours a super dark brown...it could almost pass for a lighter porter. The head is off-white, fluffy and leaves great lace. Malt dominates the aroma with some spices and nuttiness coming through as well. The taste focuses on the malt also. It is wonderful. Some roasty and nutty characters come through as well. It is super smooth and sweet...awesome take on the style."
"D- This is pretty drinkable, especially for the ABV. Because it's complexity, smoothness, drinkability, I can see drinking this again."
"The beer was fairly complex beer and it was fairly heavy. I really liked the taste of this beer. A good solid offering of a traditional Scottish Ale."
"The awesome malts linger on the palete, which is wonderful, but not conducive to frequent sips. This is a beer I could have one, maybe two max in an evening and then go looking for something different."
"I really like this beer, strong but not overpowering with a rich full flavor."
"Verdict: Old Chub is a complex beer that really showcases the Scottish style of brewing while demanding your full attention. If you've never tried a Scottish Ale and are looking for somewhere to start, you could do a lot worse than choosing this. Please don't be thrown off by the can, this is world class beer."
"D- Nice drinkability. Slightly sweet with an almost non existence hop flavor and low carbonation. Although its a heavy beer it didn't feel me up to bad. I would buy it again if in the mode. Cheers!"
"This beer pours a dark mahogany color. The head is large, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of deep caramel, toffee, and more caramel. The taste is like the aroma. There is tons of caramel everywhere, but it somehow remains interesting. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a wonderful Scottish Ale. I really wish this were available in my area."
"Very solid offering."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good tasting beer. It is not a Wee Heavy, so don't expect one...even from the alcohol %. There is nothing wrong with it, and it has a good flavor...but it doesn't stand up against some of the other beers in this same style. I would drink it again, but it is not something that I will be seeking out."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with thin tan head. Nice malty aroma with a nice nutty presence as well as some chocolate, caramel and hops. Flavor very similar to aroma with a lot of roasted nut maltiness, chocolate, caramel, toast and dark fruit with a nice hop finish."
"I can drink this beer but cant drink many.A very tasty beer."
"Really drinkable, you could down one of these without even realizing it."
"Poured this dark oil color beer into a pint glass. Slight amount of foaming at the begining reducing itself down to a fair amount of lacing. The aroma of caramels, brown sugar and slight toffee tones reach the nose. The tast of the beer is a good balance of malts and slight hops that give a brown sugar, slight hints of smokeyness and that of chocolate."
"Pours a deep brown with a small and brief head. Smells of brown sugar, maybe caramels. Tastes of brown sugar and toffee, a touch of smoke, and ends with flashes of milk chocolate. Barely hopped, if at all. [Update: Oskar Blues website says they added a ""smidge of US and UK hops.""] Tasty for sure, but a bit oversweet for my taste as the can goes on. Mouthfeel: dense and creamy with low carbonation, very interesting. Drinkability: good stuff but too sweet and high in alcohol to have more than one at a time."
"Another Oskar Blues beer to enjoy. Thicker and chewier than some Scottish Ales, and almost bordering a Scotch Ale (minus a little complexity found in Scotch Ales). Recommended."
"taste is liek the smell but different, brown sugar, caramel, an almost bourbon like thing going on as well, hit of smoke on the end, thick viscous, malty moutfell, great beer, its my go to for anything outdors, but i think it deserves ter than that, this keeps showing up in my fridge more and more, great beer."
"This beer all around tastes like a cool, dark cave in the middle of a mossy forest."
"The mild bitterness and malt forward character are very much in line with the Scottish tradition. This is a solid Scotch ale on the lower end of the size spectrum. Oskar Brews knows how to blues them...er, maybe that 8% is in there afterall."
"D- Did not taste any alcohol in this beer. Would definitely try it again."
"A bit oily in the feel, but also a bit chewy. Thick and dry too. Top shelf. A great, sweet Scotch ale. Quite good and strong."
"All thanks to Old Chub! Please give me more!"
"Overall - A beer that's exceptional in every area except the most important one: how it tastes. It's not uniformly bad and I can understand how other people, people more experienced with beer than me perhaps, might like it, but it's simply not my thing. Cheers to the canning revolution, though."
"i would drink this again. i liked it very much"
"Notes: I'll trade you an Erie Ol' Red Cease and Desist for one of these ;)"
"Been wanting to give this a try for a while, glad I finally got the chance."
"D - Dangerously tasty beer at 8% ABV. Heads up kids."
"I poured a 12 ounce can into a standard pint glass. The first thing I noticed was the little bit of carbonation in the beer, as I opened the can there was just a light hiss of air. The beer pours a dark shade of brown with a very thin white head. The beer is sweet smelling on the nose, very heavy on the caramel malt. The first flavor is a smokey caramel flavor, followed by malty sweetness. The finish is sweet with no discernable hop profile. This beer is a malt bomb. Even though this beer is medium bodied, to me it felt a bit thin. Perhaps this is a consequence of the light carbonation. The beer hides its 8% ABV quite well. I did not enjoy Old Chub as much as I had hoped. The flavor was enjoyable but to me it was too thin."
"D: It actually goes down very easily for being a bigger beer. Not really a sipper, but more of a slow gulper. I've found myself taking some big gulps and trying to savor the flavor and enjoy the finish a bit. Old Chub is a nice malty mix-up for a hop-head like myself."
"""High Altitude. High Attitude. High Land. High Ya. ...alright buddy."
"This is no wimpy beer. For me, the last half of the beer started to drag on a little bit."
"Drinkability - A very good brew and one of the best american versions i have had of the style. If it were a bit less smoke it may be tops. Worth trying on draft."
"D_Pretty much an utter dissapointment. I love Scotch ales but this is a bit of a mess with a wierd mouthfeel to it. Much better examples of the style. Not very complex or interesting and a bit of a chore to get through."
"This is a full bodied, big palated Scottish ale. It pours a very dark, just slightly opaque color with some ruby hints. There isn't much head right from the can, a thin light brown froth that dissipates quickly. Lacing, there isn't any. The nose on the beer is very sweet caramels, some candy like aromas, a good bit of liquour sweetened fruit, and a bit of ABV. There isn't much carbonation to the beer, but most Scottish ales are pretty flat. This is a very sweet, molasses laden beer, with some coffee notes, plenty of ABV in the background. I'm getting some cherry chocolate notes as well. This is a very sweet Scottish ale, but there is enough of the roasted molasses and caramel flavors, some smokiness, a bit of peatiness to still be representative of the style. But it is sweet. Not a bad beer, I can see why people are raving over it, I'm just not a huge fan of the style and this is a bit too syrupy and cloying for me at any rate."
"A one centimeter of fuzzy, slightly tanned head rises on top this dark ruby brown beer. Head retention is poor, only leaves a paper-thin sheet on top. The aroma intersts me...sweet cake batter, some esters, grapes. Ok, let's continue on and taste it. Mmmm...tasty. Is it wrong to think of cake batter as I drink this? Faint esters in the back. There's a chocolate-fruit like flavor that is in the aftertaste. Oh, and there's a faint boozy aspect as well. It's all good here."
"My first stab at a scottish ale and I liked it a lot. Pours a dark, ruby red with a nice little white head to it. Smell is a bit lacking for me, don't detect much of anything in the nose. Taste is very good though.. the caramel malts show through and has a nice smokey taste to it. It has a nice body and is very creamy in the mouth. Definitely glad I gave this beer a try."
"A god beer by all accounts. The can is cute but flavors are much been when transplanted to glass."
"D= This is a great strong Scottish ale and one that has converted me to the canned beer apocalypse. Though it is not currently easy for me to get my hands on this beer, I will gladly seek out more of this one."
"D - I have to find a case or sixer of this when I get back home... Ridcuously drinkable and enjoyable... Definately the best beer in a can that I've ever had..."
"One of the smoothest cleanest beers I've had, taste so good but almost like nothing at the same time."
"Dark carmel color and smell when first poured with very little lacing. Heavy malty, almost biscuit taste, along with notes of carmel. Drinkablity suffers, thick heavy in the mouth full of flavor. Purchase as part of an Oskar Blues variety pack. Awesome that this beer comes in a can."
"This poured a nearly opaque mahogany with thin tan head. It smelled like roasted barley with some coffee and burnt caramel, and a bit of sweet lemon hops. It tasted like smoked barley and burnt coffee with sweet caramel and a bit of oaky vanilla and slight citrus hops. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. This beer somehow seemed to derive its sweetness from the hops and its bitterness from the malt, which was very interesting. Reminded me more of a porter than a Scottish ale. But overall it was a very tasty, malty beer. It had good body and clean flavor, and was easy to drink. Great change of pace."
"D - for 8 percent it is very good. Half way through I thought my enjoyment was slowing but it leveled off and I can definately do another."
"Strong and flavorful, but balanced."
"Pretty good interpretation of the style, smooth and malty. I'll pick up some more of these at some point, but I think I like all the other O.B. brews as much or better. Nonetheless, quite quaffable."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, but there is a bit too much bite."
"This is a really good scotch ale. Probably my favorite. Definitely worth a try."
"D: I really liked this beer! Awesome savory flavors coupled with no trace of its' 8% make for a dangerously drinkable treat."
"Drinkability: let this beer warm up to room temperature and enjoy it's buttery smoothness and caramel sweetness with just a touch of smokiness."
"This beer pours a nice clear dark brown. The aroma has caramel and toffee present. It has a good body and great flavor, with lots of malt and a nice, sweet finish. This is definitely one of the better beers you can find in a can. Then again, I guess you can say that for the entire Oskar Blues line."
"A good example of scotch ale I would gladly pick this up if I see it around. All this and from a can too what more can you ask."
"D - Smooth and dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkability: A wonderful Scottish Ale, with rich and creamy flavors and a thick and mouth filling body. Only hit would be the artificial sweetener flavor that becomes noticeable as the beer warms."
"Prost!"
"D. For an 8% big and beautiful chub, this is a drinkable Scott ale."
"Heavy and thick on the body. Slick covering of the whole mouth. I imagine peat fields in Scotland while drinking the malty beauty."
"A sipping beer, but great none the less."
"A very nice, drinkable beer, and from a can no less!"
"D - Easy to drink very enjoyable"
"D: Very smooth and easy drinking, this could be a very dangerous beer given the alcohol level. I could easily go back for another (and maybe another after that). Recommended"
"D - For being a bigger beer, this is some drinkable stuff. You hardly even know it's going down."
"Overall this is a solid beer, but I think it's my least favorite of the main Oskar Blues offerings. Still, it's saying something when my least favorite beer of theirs is this good. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: The best beer I've ever had from a can hands down... and I can't believe it's 8% ABV... I want a 12 pack..."
"This is solid Scotch ale. A wonderful cool weather sipper. Can't wait till the temps. drop so I can enjoy brews like this at their fullest."
"A medium thick mouthfeel and low carbonation add to a slick body that goes down pretty well. This one would wear on me after a while, but one on a cold winter's night would do well."
"This is another EPIC beer from the Oskar Blues Brewery out in Lyons, Colorado. I picked up a case at my local beverage supply warehouse about a week ago. I am fairly new to Scottish style ales and am quickly developing a taste for them. I poured a 12 oz. can into a Guinness pint glass. The first thing that I noticed was the smooth malty aroma, with hints of toffee and caramel. There was a creamy head that quickly dissipated. The taste was heavy with again a roasted malt/caramel creaminess. As far as all the Scottish style ales I've tried so far, this one is definitely one of my favorites...and it comes in a can too!"
"drinkability: hi"
"Pours a deep dark reddish brown with a small tan head. Smells strongly of chocolate and dried fruit. Taste is very malty, toast like, with some roasted flavors. There are some earthy hops and a hint of smoke in the finish. Bitterness levels are low and let the malt shine through. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, carbonation is slightly prickly. Quite drinkable though, very smooth for 8% ABV. Interestingly enough this reminded me of a dopplebock, probably due to the dark roasted malts and low amounts of hops. Another excellent canned beer from Oskar Blues."
"This is a great beer. Something I highly recommend."
"I had 3 of these and was in a perfect place."
"Old Chub is medium-bodied, nicely carbonated, silky smooth and velvety with great drinkability."
"Drinkability- Nice it makes me want to drink canned beer more often."
"Drinkability is good, I'll be on the lookout for more and I'd recommend this to anyone who likes this style. Pair it with a sirloin or a steak, flavor is fantastic with the meat and worchestshire sauce."
"All and all not a bad beer. Easy to drink as the body is somewhat lighter than most of this style. This is a decent entertaining beer, as you probably could slip the ladies an old chub. I will enjoy this beer again."
"first beer in a can i would recomend to any true beer drinker. definately would bring to a beer sample party. something that a person who does'nt appreciate good beer would enjoy. not to heavy but has nice color and flavor that anyone would enjoy also the can is good for the enviroment"
"a hint of kiln astringency (which really comes across like coffee when attached to the sweetness) finishes up a nice drinking experience. it's an earthy brew: there's some rootbeer in here. rich, creamy"
"Drinkability- I was pretty impressed with this brew. Not really my favorite style because I don't care for the peat smokyness that many have. This one was just right for me...even though it's not quite to style, I really enjoyed it."
"D ~ Way too easy! Perfectly paired with an evening around the campfire, fishin' or... just hangin' out on the deck with my OL' CHUB in hand."
"D - This is the best Scotch ale I have had. I wish I would have picked up a full six pack of this."
"Borderline sessionable - medium to heavyweight. Great expectations for this in front of a campfire."
"Tastes fantastic. There's a light earthiness that starts things off and a hint of smoke hangs over a strong, sweet beginning of chocolate and biscuit that moves quickly into very sweet caramel and then ends on a lightly peaty sweetness that is just perfectly balanced. Wow that's how you make a good Scotch ale."
"D- Easy to drink, went well with a burger."
"Probably the best american made scottish ale out there. Very enjoyable all around."
"Overall, I'm not as impressed with Old Chub as Dale's Pale Ale, but still a very good beer in a can."
"Poured a very dark, thick reddish brown with a brownish head. Smelt of malts, brown sugar. A hint of hops and malts in the taste. Had a mild sweet taste, reminded my of molasses. Thick, chewy texture, but smooth. Very enjoyable beer, a six pack in a setting would be good."
"This beer was much better than I thought it would be and I would have to say I have liked this style more than most I have tried. This is the first craft beer I have found in a can which, while blocking all light, is probably not very good for aging. Definately recomended if you like malty beers."
"M/D - Full bodied with a lingering taste in the mouth. Very drinkable."
"D - I had mixed feelings about this beer. There were times I liked it and times I didn't. I'm not sure I would go back for more."
"D - Just one can is good enough. The milk chocolate flavors are getting a bit grating towards the end of the glass. I'm having some trouble finishing cause this beer is so uninspiring. Maybe if the smoke flavor would have been amped up or more caramel or hops flavor I would have been more excited."
"M and D- This is a very, very drinkable brew. When i think of Scotch Ales, i think of Belhaven. This blows that out of the water and then some. The ABV is nowhere to be found. It tastes like a 6%er, if that. No taking this to the pool on scalding VA days. Much better than i had anticipated."
"Good, falls short of great. I claim to really like Scottish Ales but too many American attempts fall short of something as simple as Belhaven, unfortunately."
"Drinkability is good. This is a good Scottish ale and certainly a good beer to buy again. Not bad at all!"
"Dropped out of a can into an imperial pint, produced a root beer color liquid, with a big white fine frothy head that left nice lacing. The smell is roasty, malty, maybe caramel sweet. Nice big flavor of malt and coco-licorice Crazy this is from a can. Feels nice and smooth going down. I'm finding this hard to not drink fast. Sorry I only had one can, but fortunate to have it at all, as it was an extra in a trade. Very nice malty brew."
"It's also worth mentioning that my expectations were also inflated by previous offerings I've had from this brewery, all of which were great. I wouldn't say the same about the Old Chub, but if offered again, I certainly wouldn't turn it away either..."
"the sweetness is a bit overwhelming at first. it has a very thick, heavy body that coats your mouth. personally i can't do beers that are thick as can be and overwhelmingly sweet, it's too much for me. it did have some chocolate and carmel flavors i could appreciate but this beer is just not my thing. it's decent for what it is though."
"Mahogany so deep that it could pass for black. Frothy foam head after pouring into a pint glass. Mild malt nose with a weird bodily fluid quality. Smooth creamy attack. Late presentation of coffee in the flavor. Warm sensation in the belly at the finish. Thick mouthfeel. Some sweet notes like cherry but I pull mostly coffee from the flavor. Very good scottish style although scottish isn't really ""my style."" I graded it a B+ on my own flat scale."
"Awesome ale, good example, gets better as it warms."
"This is the only beer from Oskar Blues that I had yet to try. And just like Gordon, Ten Fidy & Dale's it also rocks. Very nicely done by OB once again."
"Holy cow this is a great beer, and it is from a CAN! I have rarely poured it out, but it is a deep red/ruby color, very similar to a Coke or Pepsi but with a different head. The smell is almost fruity with hints of hops flowers. The taste is great! It is full bodied, with a rough mouth feel, that highlights the strong malt notes to it. This is also a highly drinakable beer!"
"Cheers..."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with medium carbonation. Medium to full bodied."
"Poured from a 12oz can into a pint glass. The can opened with just barely a pop. It was a deep, deep mahogany color. It had a small head that quickly settled to broken foam with a collar. Good lacing but no carbonation. The smell was really good. I love the aroma on Scottish ales. Lot of chocolate malt, caramel and good amount of smoke. A little more smoke and I would have given a five. The taste is awesome. Very smooth. The choc malt hits the tongue just right and the smokiness adds a bit of character. Great mouthfeel as well. Creamy and solid. It's like eating instead of drinking. I could, and have, drank several in a session even though it's 8% ABV. It goes down smooth and doesn't overpower with the alcohol. This one has earned a spot in the rotation."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for its weight!"
"this is just a wonderful beer .. lots of coco lacing .. smell is of a scottish bbq and meat shop heated with peat .. has a very solid flavour .. i have to ask myself this as i drink, where are the ribs?? ... is a great scottish .. goes great with a cigar!"
"A bit too simplistic for my tastes. I could see this really hitting the spot on certain occasions, but not my favorite. In fact, all who sampled it found it pretty monotonous."
"very good beer in a can."
"D - Pretty drinkable, though the thick sweetness gets a bit monotonous after a can or two. A good example of the style, overall, though it leans a bit towards a milk stout in flavor."
"Drinkability- A bit too sweet for my tastes but a good brew overall. I could not have more than one of these in one sitting."
"Had this on draft at the Mellow Mushroom Delray Beach, FL. Pours a blackish color with a minimal head that leaves no lace on the glass. Smell is of roasted malt, and a slight smell of sugar. Taste was pretty damn impressive on this one, I could taste the roasted character along with a bit of a sweet molasses and chocolate flavor and a bit of smoke in there with an overall bitter and flavorful finish. I was expecting big things from this on tap and was not dissapointed very flavorful."
"D - Nothing less than a 5 here. A big, complex beer that challenges but doesn't fight back. Tremendous."
"It's filling, but really tasty. A very nicely built malty and highly drinkable beer."
"Get this beer when you can, in a can."
"I am not usually a fan of Scottish ales, but this is a wonderful example of the style. I really enjoyed this beer and can't wait for OB to expand to Chicago."
"Tasted on 5/12/08. Trade from DHermit (thanks man, I obviously liked it!)."
"Aroma is sweet and malted, mostly chocolate and caramel, with some fruitiness that opens to a medium bodied brew, better than I expected for such a hot day, that shows the same heavily malted taste suggested by the aroma. I am not sure if this has enough depth for the winter, but it was good enough to satisfy my malt craving in a reasonably hot day. Well worthwhile."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. The beer pours a dark amber, forming a thick creamy 1 inch tan head. Light lacing is visible as the head recedes. The aroma has a strong malt presence, but also there are hints of caramel and nuts. Taste is not as pronounced as the aroma would have suggested. Strong malt presence up front, followed by a light caramel/toffee flavor, and finishing with a slightly strong alcoholic finish. Light mouthfeel. Good flavor and thin body make for a drinkable beer. Overall, I'm still undecided whether I like this beer or not. The flavor is good, but the alcohol presence seems like it could have been covered up better. The mouthfeel is very smooth but a little on the thin side for a Scottish ale. Not bad, but there are other Scottish ales that fit the bill a bit better than this one. With that said, I still think that I have alot to learn regarding Scottish ales and their characteristics."
"One of the best Scottish Ales I've had so far. It was chocolately and smoky at the same time. Some of the ones I've had are one or the other. There was that and there were still plenty of additional flavors in between the chocolate and smoke. If you like your Scottish Ales, then this one is a must try. Don't let the can fool you."
"D - This is an excellent robust brew that I think is very drinkable - when you are in that sort of mood."
"D - once I start drinkin this beer I am left wanting another and another; so drinkability for me is high..."
"D: Another good beer from the new Oskar Blues, a great beer to have on hand anytime."
"Drinkability - It is pretty easy to drink. The huge caramel component makes it difficult to have more than one in an evening - if you kill a sixer of this in an evening you will have diabetes by morning . It is a brew that feels heavy after it is in your gut. All in all, it is a pretty decent brew. Whenever I am in a rare mood to get a malt fix, I would probably turn to this."
"First sip of this tastes creamy and the malty and slightly sweet. Working through the glass notes of caramel and dark grain begin to poke out and the taste becomes a bit sweeter, but not overly so. It leaves a nice creamy feeling all the way down. Very well balanced and delicious."
"This is a really drinkable, tasty Scottish ale, among the best I have tried. The only flaw I can detect is a slight metallic flavor (from the can?)."
"My third Oskar Blues beer and I love 'um... what a fun brew Old Chub is. Talk about body! And tastes good too."
"This beer is excellent, what a sleeper! The perfect sweetness and vast array of flavors makes this one to enjoy over and over again."
"I picked up a can in Western MA, and drank it from a pint glass. This beer was surprising, it looks like a stout and smells like a stout/wee heavy mix. The beer is dark brown and opaque, with a thick tan head that retains for a long time. The smell is massive, brings to mind both Stone RIS and Skullsplitter wee heavy. Lots of sweet malt, chocolate, and richness in the smell and taste makes this a sipper. Mostly I found this malty and sweet, with no perceptable contribution from hops. Very nice and highly recommended to stout lovers or wee heavy drinkers."
"D : Another fine example from Oskar Blues"
"Thanks to thickerfreakness for this beer! Decanted from the can into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown color with a one finger head that fizzles away quickly. Aroma of sweet, caramel malts, toffee, and a touch of smoke. Tastes almost exactly how it smells. Starts with caramel and toffee, then ends with a slightly bitter, roasted flavor. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but still creamy. Drinkability is quite high as this is easy to put down. Overall this beer might have revitalized my interest in a style I thought I didn't like. It's not my ideal beer, but definitely good."
"Got a single can for $2 from the corner store...who knew? Pours amazing - a deep brown color with lighter brown highlights. Cascading bubbles bring forth a three finger cream colored head that sicks around before dissipating to a thick film after a few minutes. Nice lacing as well. Nose is deep toffee malt, lots of spicy caramel and chocolate. Smell's delicious. As the beer warms you get more of the roastedness as well. Taste is also solid - some bitter coffee, smokiness, and then that strong hit of sweet caramel malt. Cookies. Body's a little thin, for such a sweet flavor, but the carbonation's solid and works well with the spiciness. Overall, a very tasty beer, keeping up with all of Oskar Blues's solid offerings."
"Pours a cola like dark brown color with an egg shell colored head that left a sparse cap. A nice smoked caramel aroma with some peat and some chocolate malt. A nice malty aroma. The taste is of bitter sweet chocolate with a touch of caramel, toffee, smoke, and just a hint of hops to round out everything. This is one malty good brew. The feel is moderate to well bodied with softer carbonation. Finishes malty sweet then with a roasted bitterness. A very nice Scottish ale, nice subtle smoke flavor to blend with the bold malt. Bonus for being in a can, nice addition to the cooler for tailgating."
"id drink this most times... especially out of a thermos while shoveling snow or at a dinner party with a fireplace. i am happy"
"pours a deep mahogany browwith a thin tan head which dissipates quickly leaving a decent lacing in my nonic ; a moderately strong smell, a mixture of dark fruits, wood, caramel and licorice a bit of alcohol as well ; sweet, rich, big malty flavor up front, a collage of dark fruits, nuts, caramel and wood, a touch of smoke and mineral in the finish ; a full body and moderate co2 level fit the style ; an excellent brew, i wish i had a fridge full..."
"In regards to style, a bit deeper than a scottish style typically is, but not quite as complex as a true wee heavy. Extremely well put together beer, none the less."
"M + D: Quite nice, all around. A rich mouthful, a little chewy. Finishes surprisingly dry considering (that's not to say it IS really dry, per se), which I found kind of interesting. A very nicely done brew, and perhaps one of the favourites from Oskar Blues, to date."
"Excellent Scottish ale."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I've yet to have anything bad from OB, but Old Chub is probably my favorite of their offerings."
"Super glad I got to try this one. Everything Oskar Blues brews is great and this falls right in line with their other offerings..."
"Soft carbonation, medium bodied, not quite full to be rated higher. Drinks okay, if you're in the mood for sweet and buttery caramalt pie."
"Overall a really great choice!"
"This ale pours a deep, almost opaque chocolaty brown with a thick, fine-bubbled, persistent ecru head. Rich aroma is like smoky coffee, what I call ""stouty."" Flavor has coffee and chocolate tones, and a fair amount of smokiness. Texture is jazzy and edgy."
"Yeah, it comes in a can and the name is kind of funny and it's getting a little warm for heavy, malty beers, but you're doing yourself an injustice if you ignore this one any longer."
"VIVA EL CAN REVOLUCIONE!!!"
"mouthfeel was outstanding, really coated my whole mouth and the creamy texture was like silk - can't wait to try ten fidy and more of their brews :D"
"I like this beer a lot, I don't know how often I'd pick it up, the flavor profile is not one I often run for as I like bitter and funky better than smokey and sweet, but that said, if I'm in the mood for that, say early fall, I'll be scouting out a can of Old Chub"
"Always interesting to see craft brews come out of a can and this is another one (along with Ten Fidy) that proves it's possible."
"D-pretty damn delicious"
"The high alcohol and heavy malt profile makes drinking difficult. I really like the can packaging. More breweries need to ditch the bottle and go to cans."
"Very tasty beer, great to bring to an event where bottles aren't allowed!"
"Pours a deep dark ruby color with a decent off white/tan head that leaves fine lace. Smell is of dark malts with peat and copper. Taste follows with nice dark malts, slight smoke, good sweetness with a very slight metallic copper taste. Mouthfeel is defenitely on the thin side here, but ok. Drinkability is quite good as the 8% does not show up at all. Overall this is a tasty and very good session beer, it is just lacking a bit in body and strength of flavor for the style. Its on the light side, but certainly a great session ale, and I am glad i got a four pack, as I will defenitely like to drink this again. Defenitely the best canned scotch ale Ive had, awesome portability. Thanks again to SuzyGreenberg."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Elegant in the mouth, soft and slick with an excellent body. A very well balanced yet daring example of the style, daring to tread where others might not."
"Update: Feb 2009, this remains one of my favorite Scottish Ales, very smoky, great malt, easy drinker, upped my score on taste and drinkability, just one of the best of this style."
"D - I only had one can, wished I had another. You could session this brew."
"D- I was at a beer store when a homebrewer next to me said I should try this stuff. He said, ""I know it's in a can and only $7 for a six, but trust me, you'll be surprised how good it is."" He was right. This is one of my favorite Scottish ales for sure. Very easy drinking due to it's nice balance of flavors. It's got a respectable amount of alcohol, but it's kept nicely in check and certainly isn't overly evident. If you see this in a store, trust me, buy it!"
"Pours a dark maroon brown with a tan head atop. Smell is as expected for the style with peaty maltiness in the nose. Never been my favorite style, so the sample size was ample for me. Creamy body and flavor of malt and peatiness. Slight touch of hops to balance but the smoky flavor of the Scotch Ales have never been my thing."
"This started out as a good brew but faded a little as I drank. Decent brew, nothing special."
"Other comments: It tickles me how a brewery can take something as mundane as an aluminum can, put their craft brew in it, and it's suddenly more interesting and eye-catching than a lot of bottled beers."
"D- Easy to drink, obviously pour it into a glass. One of my favorites, can or otherwise..."
"I tried to come into this one with an open mind re: the whole can thing. And I won't lie, it was tough - ""can"" screams cheap American macroswill. But I really, genuinely can't help but feel like this beer had some kind of metallic funk to it. All the other elements of a good Scotch Ale were present, however, so this beer wasn't a total waste. I'll be buying another one just to make sure I wasn't misplacing something - it deserves that much, at least."
"A very good Scottish ale -- compares favorably to other strong Scottish ales like Old Jock, Dirty Bastard and Belhaven Wee Heavy."
"Pours dark, dark brown with a thick tan head. Strong aroma of caramel, toffee, and chocolate. Initially, chocolate domonates, moving through lighter malts and finisjhng with some bitterness. Very thick mouthfeel. Another very nice offering from Oskar Blues."
"This is something to have a 6-pack of in the fridge at all times."
"The beer was full of smooth, malty flavor, and its mouthfeel grew more robust as the slight amount of carbonation fizzed. It wasn't as dark as other Scottish ales I've had, and certainly didn't taste like the high-alcohol beer that it is. The finish was appropriately dry, with a mild bitter hop taste lingering in the back of my mouth."
"D. Only downgraded this since I am not a big fan of Scottish ales. A great example of a Scottish ale though."
"Overall: An extremely smooth and drinkable (not to mention flavorful) Scottish Ale, very similar to a very good stout. Great complexity and drinkability. Highly recommended."
"I like this beer, and I recommend it."
"It poured with a finger's worth of deep tan/light brown head with lots of CO2 bubbles, low retention, and great lacing. The nose was very chocolaty, which I found interesting for a Scottish-style ale. The color was a deep, dark brown with garnet highlights. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy, almost milkshake like. Speaking of which, that is what it reminded me of - a quality chocolate milkshake. It was rich with chocolate flavor in the mouth and on the tongue. The finish continued with the chocolatiness, but the extreme finish had a light smokiness. My, oh my! This could make me rethink my stance as an avowed hophead."
"Smooth creamy mouthfeel with a full body. Bitter and sweet taste like a good coffee in some ways but thicker. Bready and smoky malts are in the forefront. Nutty flavor with a hint of bitter chocolate in there too. Excellent drinkability. This is now the best beer I have ever had from a can and I give two thumbs up to the brewers for pulling off a well balanced scottish ale in a can."
"12 oz can into tulip glass, poured a dark brown with perhaps some red in there, beige head that goes down fairly quickly but leaves some nice lacing. The sweet is sweet chocolate, milk, roasted malts, some boozey spice and distant bitterness. Taste is much the same but has a wonderful dry, bitter, chocolatey finish that goes on for quite a while. Maybe I'm being unduly kind to this beer because I so appreciate the unpretentious can, but this is a wonderful brew. Wonderful balance, very complex, insanely drinkable, really unfolds as it starts to warm. I'll definitely be picking this up again."
"D = I give this good drinkability (in part because I had 3 the first I had it despite the ABV because I just couldn't stop). I really like this beer."
"D- At first I thought this one would easily be a sessionable beer but after a while there is a sticky sweetness that gets left behind in your mouth. Good drinkability in general though, I would have it again."
"D: Very impressed, one did the job but still a pleasure to drink. Still amazed it came from a can? Good job OB."
"Dark brown and copper in color with barely a head. Strong and very malty in smell. Also a definite aroma of alcohol. As it smells, sweet and malty in taste. A good balanced flavor. Also a roasted, yet strong flavor. A good beer. Not as drinkable as I would like or as I've had from other Scotch Ales. A solid beer."
"Drinkability is good. 8% ABV is hidden well. I could easily enjoy a few of these if I had the chance. Highly recommended!"
"D: 8%? Really? Damn tasty and drinking superbly. Lived up to and surpassed my expectations."
"A truly remarkable brew!"
"This is where quality craft should head (but with an 16oz can or alum. Bottle)."
"I must be honest, I gave this 3.5s in appearance and smell to give it a good grade overall but I didn't pour this into a glass. The reason I gave this a 4.5 in drinkability is this is the rare ""college"" (read: cheap) beer that is actually pretty good. I did smell it in the can and got a slightly metallic (duh) chocolate/coffee malt smell. This had a generic but great ale Scottish Ale taste; thick and creamy with good chocolate and coffee malts kicking in and a smoothness that makes it easy to just keep pouring them back. The fact that this is 8 percent alcohol shows that they were really able to hide it and it is scary how one can session this. It not only has a sweetness but it is deceptive; a great beer all things considered."
"D: Only delicious near the end, so I had to ""get used to it"" Minus points for that."
"Drinkability is moderate, this is one flavorful Scottish ale with plenty of flavor and boldness, the heather floral aroma throws off the taste a little but is very exciting, the alcohol is barely detectable but that 8% will likely creep up in time"
"Drinkability: I caught onto Oskar Blues late, with Dale's Pale Ale also being sampled recently, but I like both of them very much. Sweet, dense, rich, complex, and boozy, this is a great brew, and one that can be in a session (though I'm not sure I'd want more than a few in a sitting) or enjoyed as an after dinner dessert. There officially needs to be more craft beer in a can. That's my stand at least."
"Definitely recommended..."
"Many of this makes this one a bit to drink eagerly."
"The more good beer I drink from cans, the more I like them. Props."
"Pours a nice reddish brown color with a nice off-white head that laces pretty well. The aroma is of nice deep roasted malts, some hop bitterness and a bit of scotch. It tastes really good for a scotch ale as well. Nice deep roasted malts intertwined with a nice earthy hop bitterness and even hints of scotch make it a nice ale. It is smooth and refreshing and the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability isalso pretty high because I could definately have a few of these."
"Pours into the chalice I requested a dark ruby color with pale brown highlights. A quarter inch head trickles down to just a tracing. The aromas are incredibly rich with caramel and toffee, chocolate and a slight smoky finish. No hops are evident, fine for style. In the mouth, the toffee and chocolate continue to dominate the flavor. A quite dextrinous body is very creamy, the smoky/toasty flavors along with a vague bitterness are just enough to keep this ale balanced. The hops are just there in the warming finish. This Scottish is very low on carbonation and with a thick body has a nice mouthfeel. Overall, it is a very rich ale, one that should be reserved for sipping after dinner."
"Overall the best Scottish-stlye beer I've ever had! If you like malty beers this is for you."
"This was a rare treat indeed. I was given this to sample at the Sierra Grille in Northampton, but man was that sample great. Te appearance was a very dark amber with a frosty head that eventually dissipated a bit. The smells were sharp with malt laced with sweet aromas such as caramel. Taste was out of this world and packed a punch in just a sample. A bitter aftertaste but great sweetness and malt flavors. The body was light-medium, nothing too heavy. Overall this was a seriously delicious Scottish Ale. I can't believe a beer like this is served in a can. I cannot wait to try it through that."
"Probably one of the better scottish ales I have had, and it came out of a can which is even cooler, I am convinced that Oskar Blues makes some solid brews, recommended for fans of this style"
"It poured really dark with a reddish tint, a nice tan head that stuck around. It smelled pleasant, a bit nutty. The taste was pretty good, but for whatever reason the aftertaste reminded me of a sardine or something. Just fishy tasting. A friend of mine was swift to concur. Overall it was tolerable but I doubt that in the future I would choose it over much else."
"Can poured nicely too."
"A well-made Scottish ale from Oskar Blues that is easy to love."
"I'll repeat...what an amazing beer. Every BA should try this beer to see just how good beer out of a can can be."
"Served in an Imperial Pint glass. Poured a dark brown (the color of cola) with a quarter-inch tan colored head that dissipated into a thin skim of oily beer algae. Scent of roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste similar to nose with a touch of smoke at the end. Nice effervescent mouthfeel with a creamy finish. Great Scottish Ale from Oskar Blues."
"Overall = A well done Scottish Ale. I will continue to buy this one!"
"This is a really dangerously drinkable wee heavy, just super smooth. More complexity and it would be perfect. Big thanks to Oxymoron for the hook up!"
"It may be the best Scottish Ale I've had."
"M/D: Very nice on the palate. Carbonation compliments the fullness of the body very well, slightly creamy. Drinkability is very nice for a big 8% beer. Just something about a can too, that says ""Drink Me""."
"D- Glad I got the sixer! I like this. It is 8% so I cannot make it my session beer but I think this will be a staple in my fridge."
"d: this is a better than average beer not that familer with the style ive only had a few scottish ales but i would rate it better than most winter ales and or cream stouts that the taste reminds me of."
"This is my favorite true Scottish ale. I'd prefer Middle Ages Duke of Winship Scottish Porter any day, but that beer's a different beast. The appearance is a dark brown with tan head and legs after a good swirl. This has a great foundation of dry cocoa and sweet caramel candy, along with a balance that isn't too sweet like some big Scottish ales or Wee heavy. Really, this beer does remind me more of a Wee Heavy, with the rich honey and caramel bread flavors. It almost tastes like a wonderful chocolate cake or candy bar with caramel liqueur, but it's still not cloyingly sweet."
"D - a little too heavy to drink a bunch of these, but it's a beer worth trying."
"Old Chub is the one Oskar Blues beer I have neglected for the last few years (even though I liked it) but no more! Nice dark brown-black color, malty smell with a smoky thick taste, wow! I really like the flavor of this beer, which is no surprise. I was a little sad Dale's Pale Ale changed but Gordon and Old Chub are pretty awesome."
"Good beer but it would be hard to session this one, filling and 8% alc. not sure if I could drink more than a pint of this since it can also get very sweet."
"D: I would buy this again in a heartbeat. It's strong, so I couldn't see myself drinking more than two in one sitting. But it makes a great nightcap."
"C'mon the hoops !!!! ..."
"D - I liked it, really, but this beer is brutal. That really says something coming from me too. It wasn't the nice savage dangerous beer, it was the sadistic type that attempts to break down the spirit, ravage you, then abandon you. I doubt I would drink more than one. Worth a try though."
"Overall, a good beer, an awesome canned beer, but a bit bland."
"Drinkability - I was so digging this beer that I was drinking it in cognito from a Koozy at our local pool in mid-August. It felt so bad drinking it from the can and felt so good to have a canned beer so delicious. Our tentative plans are to head back to Carolina again this summer and I plan on re-stocking this and any other OB brews that the Greensboro Total Wine might have on hand."
"Overall- Very impressed with this one. Loved it and wanted more so I stopped and picked me up a six of the cans. Great for desert or any finisher."
"Blackest brown body hosts a huge deep tan head at almost three fingers tall. Leaves scattered lace as it fades. Nose is a lively mix of pepper, cola, smokey malt and toffee sweetness. nicely bold on first sip with well developed notes of rich malt. Flavors that come thru included roasted malt, toffee, nuttieness and woodsy minerals. This is a very very good scottish style which I am a fan of already. Nice dark chocolate feel on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is thick due to the sticky sweet carmel like hue from tha malts. A drinkable brew that should be savored a little more than others of this style."
"used to drink this like it was going out of style at the ""mulligan's"" bar at the Hidden Valley golf-course when i was finally off work. pours out of the can a beef stew brown color with nice head retention (though I love them the bar tenders made me drink it out of a solo beer-pong cup so I'm at a loss for how it laces). smells more like a nut-brown than a wee-heavy as the distributor for the bar told me it was, major walnut aroma. tastes like a weak scottish or an okay yorkshire ale, with the same walnut flavor as the nose would lead you to believe. mouth-feel is crisp yet malty but I'm sure the solo cup bastardized it plenty, and strait from the can it's got a tin note(just can't win at mulligan's when it comes to beer) and the feel screws the drinkability, otherwise i'd give it a 4.5. all in all it's a good beer i just need to try it with a GLASS pint glass."
"D- The 8% ABV is hidden very well. This isn't really my style, but it is very good."
"I loved this beer and it is an extremely great value for a 6 pack, this brewery is great and I really look forward to trying even more of their beers."
"Pours a dark brown that looks ruby when you let light through it. Tan head. Nose is heavy caramel with a touch of a peaty tone. Flavor is sweet with a touch of smoky background. Feel is good. Slightly sticky, but smooth. Pretty drinkable, though the level of sweetness (I think) detracts from it just a little bit."
"pours a semi transparent dark brown with a light tan one finger head and not much lace. rich aromas of chocolate with a hint alcohol. taste of sweet chocolate with lots of roasted malt and fresh coffee also dark cherries and figs come to mind. full bodied and silky smooth with a light carbonation that goes well with it. alcohol a little high to have to many but its a very good beer."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours very dark mahogany, with a dark tan, dense, lasting head that leaves a nice lace. Aroma is dark malts and chocolate, some faint hops, and hints of smoke, as well as very faint dark fruits. Flavor is dark malts and chocolate upfront, some slight raisin notes, and more faint smokiness. Alcohol is pleasantly, and faintly warming, helping to balance the sweetness of the malts. Aftertaste is well balanced dark malt, slight hops and faint smoke."
"The mouthfeel is great, sweet and that oh so smooth drinkability factor. This is a great malty beer, tastes of chocolate, a bit of coffee and some smokiness."
"Poured from the can into a mug. Auburn with red and brown hues. Very little head, which I expected from the scottish ale style. Smells great, some chocolate, caramel and nutty pine. Taste wasn't what I expected after the great smell. I picked up some of the chocolate and caramel, but it was more of a dull aftertaste than a strong presence. An ok brew, but not being a Scottish Ale fan, I probably won't try it again."
"Another great canned beer and one of if not the best domestic Scotch Ale I've had.... up next.... another canned Scotch Ale.. I am feeling lucky after this brew."
"Notes: A very nice brew, especially as it warms. This makes a great winter/cool fall night sipper, especially as a change of pace from the Imp stouts/barleywine varieties that I usually opt for in those settings. A great beer."
"D - This is a very good beer I was a little skeptical because it comes in a can but its good and worth a try"
"pours a deep ruby brown with some nice tan head, which leaves excellent lacing. The smell is strong with sweat malts and caramel. The taste is also quite malty, with some hints of chocolate and a hint of hops, that dose not quite balance it out, but adds some complexity. The Alcohol is barely apparent. The mouthfeel is light and the drinkability is very high for something at 8%. I dont see to may of this style around, but this may be the best i have had."
"A nice malty beer with a unique taste and smell. Plus it's in cans so easy to haul around. Yeah, it's better in a glass but it's good straight from the can too!"
"Though I had this one on-tap, I've seen it in cans, and you can't say you've had that many great craft brews in 12-ounce cans. (Only New England Brewing Co brew from Woodbridge come to mind at the moment) Too bad you can only get this one during the holidays."
"Craft beer in a can?!!! Absolutely!! Love it. Beer pours a beautiful red/brown into the glass, with a frothy tan head. I don't generally go wild about beers this malty, but this is just amazing. Smells chocolatey/smoky/sweet....oh, man. Goes down like silk, and I really like the low carbonation level...just perfect for this beer. I've had two, and the ABV is catching up with me...so I don't see myself drinking more than 1 or 2 in a night. Really impressive, I'd buy this again in a heartbeat. Can't wait to try more from Oskar Blues!!"
"The drinkability is also good, this brew is a very good representation on the style. Prosit MK"
"D - Pretty damn good stuff! To strong for a session beer, this is a nice sipper for a cold and rainy November morning."
"Drinkability: I downplayed this a little due to the strong flavor. Usually with this beer it is one and done for the evening for me (but I certainly do enjoy the one.)"
"Enjoy year round, seriously, I had my first in June!"
"i had this friday night at the north bowl in philadelphia and get this 2 bucks a can !!!! poured into a pint glass that wasnt frozen !!!! i have seen six packs of this go for a 11 bucks which held me off from trying it and the sweet looking barmaid told me thats the price all the time . well it tasted great just like mcewans so on my way home from philly monday afternoon i picked up a 12 pack in new jersey for 15. bucks which surprised me too. this is not exactly a session beer since its 8.0 but to have one or 2 a couple times a week would be pure pleasure.by the way the north bowl is a hop skip and a jump from the standard tap where the cheapest beer is 5 bucks . id really like to review the north bowl too not a big selection but most impressive you will ever see at a bowling alley where blue moon was selling like hotcakes for some reason"
"D - A nice beer and a good change of pace. Seems a good winter beer, not something for a hot summer day. This is a cozy and comforting beer perfect for a lazy evening."
"Pours clear red-edged brown with a good inch of thick tan foam. The head slowly subsides to a creamy blanket and rich lace. The smell is quite peaty, a bit smoky and with an undercurrent of alcoholic raisins and figs. The flavor is more grainy; full of husky sweet oatmeal with strong peat and dark fruit notes. Some bare alcohol bite at the slightly sour finish. Body is very smooth and creamy initially, though some carbonation sneaks in by the swallow. Not the best Scotch Ale, but altogether pretty likable and an entirely different beast than the draft variety."
"Deep, dark brown color with a tan foam, rich color when held to the light. Good head retention and thick lace. Roasted aroma, nuts and dark malt. A bit earthy and smoky, very nice. Slightly sweet and malty taste. More toasted, nuttiness. Lots of flavor going on, caramel, smoke, cocoa, and an alcohol warmth at the end. Slightly dry finish, with a balanced hop finish. Full flavor while still being light and thin. Very drinkable, especially for an 8% brew."
"A bit too sweet to drink too much of it. However, this was much more than I was expecting; very nice."
"D - Wonderful malt - smooth, rich malty, smooth and clean and roasty w/ a hint of hops and spice w/ a subtle smoke note. I found this to be one big beeer w/ a growler worthy drinkability -Very good to quaff even though it will show its true colors eventually. So drinkable, nowhere near tasting like 8% One of Oskar blues gems, Kudos!"
" Anyway, this Scottish Ale is my idea of the perfect session beer. If you have not tried it, I highly suggest giving it a go."
"Beer poured a dark brown color with a three fingered head initially that is sustaining solidly. Nose is sweet heavy toffee malts which is a heavy hint that is to follow. Taste is heavy on the sweet caramel and chocolate malts that blends into a dry toffee finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy smooth, nothing but pure pleasure on the palate. Drinkability is good This is a very good representation of the style, very enjoyable, and is recommended if you can find it."
"Overall, one of the better Scottish Ales I have had. Definately worth a try, especially if you enjoy the style."
"Comment: Nice brew...not a session beer. After a while the sweetness catches up and becomes more than desired."
"Drinkability: This is 8%?"
"One of the best sessional beers I've ever had. Didn't even know it was 8 percent abv. You have to try this beer. I bought a six pack of this in colorado. WHY DIDN'T I BUY A CASE?"
"Great on a cool fall night with it's lingering spice. Actually I could have this any time. And I still can not believe this just can out of a can."
"D- Considering its thickness and its high ABV this is very drinkable. I'm usually not a big fan of beers this heavy on malts but I really like this one. I will have it again. Besides it goes for the same price as Dale's Pale around here...and is always included in the Lower tier of craft mixed 6-ers (Gordon is really expensive...and also very delicious). I guess you just can't go wrong with Oskar Blues."
"D - I had 2 that night...and enjoyed them very much"
"I consider this to be a middle-of-the-road scotch ale. It is not a wee heavy although the alcohol would lead you to believe it is."
"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy tannish head, lots of nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slightly spicy, and some toffee/caramel. The taste is big on malts, slightly bitter/spicy, good dose of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very smooth drinkable Scottish Ale for 8% ABV. Highly recommended."
"Overall, the best Scottish Ale I've had thus far. Definitely worth looking for if you haven't tried it."
"This one pours a deep brown with tan head that is thin but creamy, sticking a bit to the sides of the glass. Lots of caramel with some accents of coffee, roast and slight malt sourness in the nose. The taste is a big caramel malt bomb with a bit of bittering earthiness from the hops at the end. The body is a bit thinner than others in this style but I find it to be a nice effect in this brew. Very smooth and creamy mouth feel with mild carbonation. Cans are great (as it turns out) and recycle better than glass to boot"
"12 oz can poured into a new Sam Adams glass. Dark, almost black color with a tan, soapy head. Smell alcohol initially, then chocolate, light roast coffee and raisins. I know there is a touch of smoked malt in there but I can't smell it. First sip has a very, very mild cognac bite that dissipates quickly to chocolate and just a hint of that ""touch of smoked malt"" coming through. The mouthfeel is creamy with well balanced carbonation. I'm not familiar with the style but I really like this beer. With a 12-pack costing $15.99 I'll definitely buy this again."
"dark brown with a dark tan head that has minimal retention but leaves a great deal of lacing on the glass. roasty malt, toffee and unsweetened dark chocolate in the nose. i wish it would have an even stronger smell because what i do smell is fantastic, i just have to try hard. taste is unsweetened dark chocolate, maybe some dark fruit (like fig or something) a faint hop finish and some alcohol kick. mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but a little flat in my opinion. great beer. one of my favorite crews. go dale, chub and gordon."
"Wow! I was not expecting a domestic scotch ale to be so good, especially considering it came in a 12 oz can. I was happily amazed. It poured out nice and smooth, with excellent head and lacing. It has a fantastic dark color, the deepest copper color I've ever seen in a beer, it was almost pitch-stout-like. Very flavorful, excellent hoppiness and oak/peat tones. Goes down smooth and finishes with a wonderful aftertaste. I'll need more than the single I bough to be sure, but I may have found the domestic scotch ale that could tide me over if I can't find an import."
"This is a great beer. Even though I'm almost totally ignorant of the Scottish Ale style, I can tell that this is a superb example. It's malty, smoky, and above all, delicious. I imagine this would be a good cold-weather beer, although I enjoyed it immensely with temperatures in the 70s. Please do give it a try. Highly recommended."
"I tried Old Chub on the reccomendation of Sam Matson and Jeff Shaw from Red White And Brew in Florence NJ. Sam has a great eclectic selection of beers at the Florence store. Old Chub to me was exceedingly smooth and very easy drinking which is not usually my description of a dark beer. The taste was light and not ""overpowering"" like some dark beers (Guiness) the appearance was that of a european ale that you would find in a pub. No mentionable after taste which in my eyes is great because I dont think that a beer should have a huge aftertaste."
"Taste is mildly burned with chocolate and soft coffee notes. This burned taste together with the sweetness make the beer like rum beans covered with chocolate. The alcohol finish the experience by adding a boozy kick to the beer. The dark malts are maltbitter, the hopbitterness is low and almost undetectable. Mouthfeel is sweet and sticky."
"I drank half of it just writing this review. Watch out though, it'll sneak up on you."
" Mouthfeel is rich and a tad creamy, very nice for a Scottish ale. Overall, a very pleasant Scottish ale. Needless to say, the can doesn't seem to affect the quality of this beer in the least. Good stuff."
"Drinkability - If it wasnt for the 8% abv tag, Id drink a lot of these bad boys. One of the best Scottish Ales I have had the pleasure of having. Hats off to Oskar Blues!"
"One of the best Scottish Ale's I've had to date. Full flavors and a nice balance; the 8% abv never even entered my mind. This one opened my mind to the fact that good beer can be canned."
"Easy to drink in that the alcohol never gets in the way, even as it approaches room temp (which was fast, it was roughly 95 degrees in the apartment), but still such a rich, strong, flavorful beer that I think it's pretty easy to get a handle on. An excellent end of the night brew."
"Very nice! This beer is the second that I have had form Oskar Blues, the first being Dale's Pale Ale, which I throughly enjoyed. This beer is even better that DPA, with an almost stout like character. The pour is beautiful, dark brown and black with a ruby tranluscence. The smell is nice, with toffee, dark fruit, molasses and coffee. The taste is quite malty sweet and has some roasted smoky qualities. The mouthfeel is also nice with a lifting, medium body. The drinkability is good if you like Scottish ales."
"This is a Great example of the style... EXCELLENT... I am happy to have this beer around all the time... Micro in cans.. I love it and this is one of the best"
"Never poured a beer from a can. First time for everything I suppose. Pours a reddish-dark brown. Head dissipates fairly quickly. Taste is relatively complex. I get hints of coffee. Overall, a very solid beer, especially since it's coming out of a can."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. The alcohol, although warm, is not overpowering. It would be very easy to drink a few of these w/ out remembering the 8% that accompanies this drink."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a can. Poured out a deep brown into the glass, but was a nice blood red hue when held up to the light. Two fingers of light brown head formed with a somewhat vigorous pour. Head slowly faded into a thick layer of foam and left plenty of thick lace behind. Aroma was of the roasted/toasted sort. Roasted almonds, coffee, some sweet caramel, and just a slight touch of chocolate. A pretty damn good nose in my opinion. This beers flavor is as equally good as the smell. The first flavor that jumped out at me was smoke, or charred wood. Tons of roasted malt, toasted nuts, some dark fruit, toffee, and just a little bit of a smooth alcohol kick in the finish. A great tasting beer in my opinion. Had a nice full, smooth, palate coating mouthfeel. Drinkability was decent but it seemed the beer was harder to drink the further down the glass I got. Oskar Blues continues to convince me that good beer can come from cans."
"Quite drinkable - a little stronger than I like for my forays to the pool with a cooler of canned craft beer, but I'll survive."
"Drinkability: Good! My favorite OB beer now (Gordon is too expensive to be a favorite beer). Easy to drink."
"To summarize: My roommate (a likker fiend) loves Old Chub. I love Old Chub. Women and children and menfolk all love this beer. I don't think I've met someone who hasn't enjoyed it. Drink Old Chub, you will be a better person for it. Or at least a happier one."
"The taste presents a huge malty backbone infused with bitter chocolate, coffee beans, and alcohol. For a can (as with OBG's Dale's Pale), Old Chub doesn't disappoint flavor-wise. The mouthfeel is smooth and almost creamy with a thick body, low carbonation (as expected with the 8% ABV). All in all, I'd say this beer is definately complex and flavorful, but it's a bit much to stomach more than one in any given setting."
"Not your typical boring pusillanimous canned beer."
"Overall, this is an excellent brew. I think someone else mentioned that it seems to be a bit of a cross between a Scottish style ale and perhaps a Wee Heavy...and I agree. Anyway, I highly recommend it!"
"Of the three Oskar Blues beers I've had, this is my least favorite. But that should not keep you from drinking this beer. It is a fine one."
"The Old Chub pours a tawny, coffeeish colour with a thick tan head. The aroma is all dark malts, milk chocolate, plummy fruit and whiff of smoke. Mocha, spice, toffee, roasted malty flavours all wrapped up in a very full bodied, fully flavored brew. Taaasty!"
"This is a good supping brew that I will definitely like to try again. It actually kind of tasted almost like a porter with the character of the roasted malts. A very well done brew overall."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, kind of filling, very good representation of style, good kick, this is a good beer to drink as a sipper. I think its a little too heavy to a whole lot of them in an evening, but its still a very good beer."
"Overall, an outstanding scotch(ish) ale - highly recommend."
"For the level of alcohol, this beer is dangerously drinkable. It's not a flavor bomb by any means, but is still tasty enough to order another pint were it on hand at my local. Were it not for the alcohol content, this could be an excellent session beer."
"I don't care what time of year it is, I'll take a dark and richly flavored treat like this any time. Very drinkable."
"This is really more of a Wee Heavy than a Scottish Ale, but style-wanking aside, this is a big, gutsy beer in a little can. I'm definitely impressed so far by what Oskar Blues is doing-- now if they could just get the price on their cans down to something reasonable..."
"D- Something about this one is right up my alley. Just damn tasty."
"D - Give me more ... by far the best American brewed Scottish Ale I have had (is this thing actually 8%). I am taking the rest of the six pack with me to the Bogue Chitto River tomorrow."
"Proof it ain't the can that makes beer taste bad, this canned beer is truly good beer. Buy it in spite of the can, I'd have tried this a long time ago if it was bottled."
"drinkability is great. balanced, deep, and interesting. a malt lovers dream."
"At first I was hesitant about this beer, being that it's in a can. Thanks to a friend, who highly recommended that I give a shot and thank god I did. Aggressively poured dark brown with a mocha color three finger foamy yet creamy head. Great rentention, leaving an excellent amount of sticky lacing around the glass from top to bottom. Upon pouring a blast of roasted coffee hits the nose. In the middle the scent of burnt chocolate chip cookies, caramel and vanilla shines through. I also got a hint of clean barnyard hay and plum. The initial taste is right on with the aroma. Semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and roasted coffee to start. I somehow got a little salty favor in the middle. Plum with a long bitter chocolate favor was left on my tongue, that left me longing for more. At 8% ABV, this smooth middle body, softly carbonated, creamy and oily feeling brew is a hit on my palate. I recommend pairing with a nice juicy burger. Enjoy"
"Poured from a can. Pours a dark brown color with a nice head that falls quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of chocolate and caramel notes. Smells really good. The flavor is also very chocolate-filled with hints of roasted and smoked grains with a lot of caramel flavors as well. The flavor comes across a tad sharp at first, probably due to the use of lots of chocolate malt, but it mellows as it sits. Tasty. It has a full body and is very drinkable for 8%. Two thumbs up for this can of beer."
"Hands down, the best canned beer I've ever had. The beer does indeed prove that good beer can be followed by smashing its container in your forehead (not recommended, by the way). The beer is promising right from the git-go. A sturdy, deep mohogany color with ruby highlights, supported by a 1"" lightly tanned foamstand that lasted the session. Moderate aromas of toffee, cocoa, molassas, caramel, and a light smoke scent turn into very bold, rich flavors of strong, toasted malts, caramell and toffee, a hint of coffee and peat-moss. A complementary hop flavor increases into the finish. Bold alcohols ride just behind the sweetness, providing a nice distraciton. The body is full and rich, but rests just before becomming chewy. Bready and earthy flavors and textures provide a lot of complexity well into the sweet toffee lingering. Folks, this is a good beer!"
"Over all this tops my list of Scottish Ales."
"D: Smooth and full-flavored, this one is a winner. I would drink copius amounts of this if available in Ohio. Damn."
"Good body, with a good amount of carbontaion. A bit sweet and chocolatey. Very nice."
"This beer is very quaffable for a Scottish, which are often heavier than this example. Seductive! Highly recommended."
"D-Decent enough...lacks strong smoky qualities....also would prefer to have the body a little bigger and creamier....don't care for the acidic/dry finish...It has some redeeming qualities but I could live without another one of these.."
"Old Chub is a high, high quality Scottish ale. Very enjoyable and easy drinking. Big flavors but in no way overwhelming. Excellent."
"D - The best beer I've ever had in a 12 oz. can. Great caramel and malt flavor."
"This beer pours a nice hazy red-brown with very good, thick, and durable head formation, comprised of tiny bubbles of varying sizes. Aroma is a bit peaty, and with abundant amounts of sweet malt roastiness. Beer is fairly bourbon-y, with lots of sweet roastiness. You definitely cannot fault this beer for a lack of flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth. This beer is solid all the way around."
"Beer reviewed on 01.30.07"
"12oz can. Dark mahogany with ruby edges. Tan head with tiny bubble carbonation. Looks creamy. Has the look of a porter in the glass. Definitely tastes like a scottish style ale. Fresh wort taste and smell, like standing next to a mash tun. Very sweet start. Hops are big but late in the taste. Reigns in the sweetness. Equates to a 90 shilling plus! American style with pronounced hop flavor and aroma. Best scottish ale in America and competes with Scotland. 8%abv warms but doesn't detract from flavors. The can doesn't impart any flavor because of a can lining. Definitely pour into a glass to see what it looks like unless you are hiking or boating etc., then just crack open and enjoy."
"I knew I would like this and it is very nice. Got a case for $19.99 at a tent sale, sixers of this go for $7.99. Great Scottish Ale and OB does not disappoint."
"Very nice and easily drinkable, however not the most complex of scot. A good bit of bittering hop hold through the finish and leaves you puckering. Milk chocolate covered toffee bits. A peat smokiness is noticeable and adds a good touch. Some dried fruit and even a nutty character are present. Mouth is medium and thickens up on the long finish, very creamy. A scot I could session for a day or two."
"Drinkability - nice, I like it, alcohol is warming and the ABV would probably catch me off guard if I had more than a few of these"
"Hands down, the best Scottish Ale from a can I've ever had."
"D- Very drinkable, a little high in alcohol to enjoy too manay during a session, but very good."
"D- This beer has a nice big porter flavor with roasted depth and a good body and I can't imagine a better beer in cans. The smooth malt flavor has a nice hop finish with some nice lager notes."
"Pours a hazy dark brown/red, thick tan head forms, tons of lacing, nice retention, really looks nice. Smell is wicked, sweet, very malty, chocolate and toffee, some roast, dark fruits, some dates, really pleasant. Taste is similar, very sweet and malty, dark fruits, heavy toffee, nice roast, cherries, balanced and not a hint of the alcohol, nice heavy finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. Very nice beer to drink. Could easily put back a few of these and be in some trouble. Thanks Jay and Jeff!"
"Flavor is comples. Tons of caramel. Chocolate and toffee. Maltiness has a solid backbone. Slight--ever so--hop bitterness. Then I find a smoky essence. Medium body to a fuller and oily trexture as it warms. None of the ""tinniness"" that I find in most canned beers."
"M&D - smooth and full bodied, nearly syrupy, an easy down scottish ale, that truly is a pleasure to drink, a great front porch/hot summer day ale, especially as it comes in a can"
"Very smooth and creamy, a pleasure to drink. Nicely done; beware the alcohol content however. Definite warmth from the alcohol."
"D- It is good. I think it is over rated though. It is tasty just wouldn't try hard to get another."
"Bottom line: I get some roasted malt and some chocolate but it really doesn't work for me. If you see it, try it, because many reviewers found it to be an excellent rep of a Scottish Style Ale. You may too."
"Very nice, deep garnet color. Great tan head on top. Really is a nice looking brew. Good aroma-very malty with a slight smoke aroma. Nice caramel tinge in there. Fantastic malty flavor. Terriffic blend of caramel sweetness with a slight peated taste. I get a very faint espresso taste to it. Very full body here. Dangerously drinkable at 8%. I liken this to a wee heavy more then just a scottish ale. Damn fine beer in a can."
"Definitely a mammoth of a beer. Pours a dark mahogany and settles with a nice, creamy head. Smells of caramel and chocolate malts are easily noticeable, I'm sure this is going to taste great. Taste great is almost an understatement. Loads of chocolate, caramel, and perhaps a hint of coffee coming through immediately in a thrist quenching way. Sweet and a little smokey. I can't get enough of this stuff. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, malty with a bitter edge. Definitely a full bodied treat here. Surprisingly, this is very drinkable even with an 8% tag. I would never know if they didn't tell me and in my mind, that's a good thing. The only thing that prevents this from a great drinkability score is how full the mouthfeel is. A little more than it should be. Overall, a pretty great example of the style. Maybe a little overboard in some areas but I enjoy that. Excellent work once again from Oskar Blues."
"Drinkability is great. If this beer was available in California, I'd buy it often. Well done Oskar Blues!"
"Will have to try this in its can, instead of tap."
"Cheers!"
"A nice sipping beer, but just as easy to chug (though not suggested). Watch out though ... I seem to have forgotten about the 8% ABV when I reached for a second one. Subsequently I forgot to set my alarm for work the next day ... whoops. It's a good beer to have in the fridge for hot days or picnics. Love the can idea ... makes for easier transport and cooling. Can't wait to try some of their other styles."
"I split this brew with Stopper. Poured into a snifter at room temp. The beer pours a deep mahogany color with creamy beige head of .5 cm foaming up and receding rather quickly to an edge layer. Aroma is rich and malty with caramel and brown sugar and some dark fruit. Quite nice on the nose. First sip reveals an ave to lite body with fairly mild carbonation that is almost non-existent. Flavor is all malt with brown sugar and caramel mixing with a bit of chocolate. An easy drinker with lingering sweet malt and some roasty notes as well. A very nice beer that is worth every penny. No hint of the ABV anywhere."
"drinkability - I could drink this all day. I loved this one. I think it took me an hour to drink this and savor it. I should of just bought more lol."
"D: Terrific, easy-drinking stuff! I definitely recommend grabbing some Old Chub if you see it...hey now, did I just write that? Unfortunately I only had one can of it, but I can imagine after a couple more the old chub/junk innuendo is HIGH-larious!!! Again, thanks to Jeff for sending this...and look for the emailed photos coming soon..."
"If you enjoy this style, its worth seeking out for sure. Very enjoyable!"
"Served a deep black, not quite opaque like a stout, but deep enough. There was a thin head that slowly diminished and left a little spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by black malts. The beer was nice and smooth with black malts dominating. There was the slightest amount of hops WAY in the background, as the case should be with a Scottish ale, this provided for a very enjoyable beer, even for a hophead like me; I must admit, I love a good Scottish ale as a change of pace every now and then. The beer was nice and crisp and the alcohol was slightly present, but not overbearing. This is a very good beer when I want a break from hops."
"Not my favorite style in my current hop phase, but a hell of an impressive beer. Seemed very true to style, and one I will return to in between my hop fixes."
"Pours out a dark brown that almost looks black from some angles. Tan head is thin and settles to a rim above the glass. Leaves some scant lacing. Smells of a mix of chocolate, coffee, dried fruits, stone fruits, and ever so faint smoked malt. Flavor starts off very fruity with a mix of grape and apples. The middle brings more of a chocolate and roasted character. Finish is dried fruits, tobacco, alcohol, and smoked malts, which all linger on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel leans a bit toward heavy, has an almost sticky quality , and has a smooth, light carbonation. Really good American version of a Scottish ale. A sipper, but still rather drinkable."
"D: Pretty good, Im not a huge fan of this style but Oskar Blues has once again make a quality beer and allowed me to buy in cans again without feeling like a total loser. Thank you OB."
"Poured from the can into a Duvel glass. Ample head, dark color almost opaque. Aromas of sweet malt, caramel. Flavors are a bit more restrained. I was expecting more of a wee heavy type of ale due to the 8%abv. Malts are there, but not as over the top as some other brands. Good dose of hops as well. Highly recommended. Craft brew in a can. What will they think of next?"
"Poured a thick dark ruby brown with a huge tan colored head. A great amount of lace was left down the glass, and the settling of the beer was a fantastic site, grat pour, looked perfect. Smell was sweet right away. Lots of sugar and caramel smells, hints of grains and breads and even a light hop presence rounded this put nicely. The taste followed right away, but was alot more hoppy then I had envisioned. Lots of caramel and sugar flavors, and more then a hint of alcohol made up the bulk of it. Big hoppy finish which suprised me in a good way. The taste and feel were both very full, smooth and creamy. This was a very very good brew, I enjoyed it tremondously and very glad I have a bunch more!"
"Pours a big head, I poured to rough and had a double pour. The head is fluffy like ice cream and leaves behind a grand lacing. The color is very dark, I can barely see through to the other side. About 7 minutes after the pour the head has gone down into a layer just above the beer, still a little thick in the middle, but no beer exposed from the top. Smell is spicy and aromatic, I smell cinnamin and some other spices. The taste has some clove and is a pretty darn good scottish ale. The mouthfeel is pretty nice and a bit smooth. Overall I would/will have another one of these fine beverages."
"I am less familiar with Scotch Ales and am usually less intrigued by them, however, this brew seemed very enjoyable. Despite being strong on malt, it didn't get overly ""sweet"" and I was glad for that. Good balance, and complexity of flavors. Recommended..."
"D: Very drinkable, especially from a can! I genuinely hope that more brewers begin to can more of their offerings, as this one can do no wrong."
"Pours an opaque brown with ruby hints when held to light. Has a 2-finger head that fades relatively quickly, leaving rings of lace. My first experience with this one - hard to believe it poured from a can. The smell is what I expect from a scottish ale - sweet, earthy, hints of caramel, earth. I seem to get a little chocolate in the nose as well. Taste is a nice sweetness up front that fades to an earthy, slightly smokey finish. Avoids the scottish ale trap of finishing overly sweetly - very drikable for its style and ABV. A very solid brew."
"This is a very good beer, the fact that it's in a can puts it even further away from the pack. The appearance, when poured into a glass, is very nice. It's a proper color for a Scotish ale, even if it is lacking a bit in the head department. The smell is a nice, malty affair with perhaps a hint of chocolate nose. The taste seals the deal, a faint undercurrent of smoky flavor comes through, just enough to qualify for the style but not enough to scare off the masses. Good mouthfeel, and for a 8% beer VERY drinkable. I'll try to keep a six of this around."
"Solid brew overall, though this isn't one of my favorite styles. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"Almost full bodied, yet light on the carbonation. Some bitterness in the aftertaste let's you know that they did throw some hops in there. Another great canned beer. Hopefully, other breweries will follow suit."
"Very dark brown brew with a tan head. Nice trails of lacing. Smell is very malty. Faint alcohol note. Taste is somewhat sweet but not over the top. Malt has a caramel note. Also some smokeyness in the finish on the taste. Little bit of a grainy mouthfeel and some more of the alcohol note in the finish. Overall a very nice beer. Big thanks goes out to Cisco for passing this one along. Was pleasantly surprised to find this one in PA."
"D - Incredible drinkability. Now that I've drank Old Chub in a glass, I can't wait to crack open a nice cold can of this great beer. I drank it at a pretty warm temperature and it was outstanding."
"Despite the off the wall presentation, this ale was a great surprise. It poured a glossy amber brown with some nice lace and sticky malt aromas. Smooth going down, not mild at all- very strong malts, sugary but not too sweet. Sticky on the back end, with some watery hop to bite at the sweetness of the malt. All around very decent and it hides the relatively high ABV very well."
"I'm picking more of this up. right away!"
"Pretty good stuff here. A perfect choice of a six-pack to split between 2-3 friends in a sitting... just make sure everyone has a ride afterward."
"Another solid craft beer in a can! I'm digging this new trend. Anyway, this is a nice Scottish ale I had no problems consuming. I like that it's on the dark end of the style (or beyond), but would prefer just a few less IBUs and a touch of sweetness."
"D: Quite a drinkable brew. Has some nice warmth and mouthfeel, and a full enough taste to want to go back for more. If not the best beer I've had, a really enjoyable and drinkable beer I'd get again."
"Can courtesy of shp555: Poured an hazy dark brown color ale with a big thick foamy head with good retention. Aroma of sweet malt with subtle touch of peat smoke is quite interesting. Taste is a nice balance between smoky malt with some sweetness. Body is above average with a creamy texture and some medium carbonation. This is a very good example for the style with some very good balance."
"A great beer. Deceptively strong. Love the can!"
"Poured into a little belgian snifter from the can. Wow. A deep ruby-black color with a thick and creamy one-finger head. No real lace as the beer dissipates, and the head thins out quite a bit, but I am really pleased at how nicely this pours from the can. Malty, sweet, bitter aroma. Caramel with some vanilla and molasses. Sweet, but with a pungent hoppy, coffee bitterness in it. This smell has lots of character. Tastes sweet and hoppy and delicious. Raisins and prunes with a tart accent. Coffee finish. Man, this beer is done right. Even tastes good straight from the can. I think this is the first beer I've ever reviewed that I've given a straight, across-the-board 4 to. Old Chub, indeed."
"D- Probably the most drinkable scotch ale in the world. Cheers."
"Taste is awesome! This beer is very drinkable - and they sneak up quickly on you! Beware!"
"D - The ABV is well hidden. Another fine Oskar Blues beer in a can. It it nice to have good beers for tailgaiting or boating where bottles don't work as easy."
"You can drink this right from the can and it tastes great! This time around though i poured it into my pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown color with a nice tan head. The aroma is very rich. Chocolate, caramel and loads of malt.The taste is fairly complex, kind of like a very flavorful stout. The caramel, chocolate and coffee flavor works very well together. The mouthfeel is moderate to full and is incredibly smooth.Virtually no bitterness is detected as the hops are covered up by the dominating malt. The alcohol is barel detectable. VERY drinkable."
"Drink beer from a CAN? You must be mad, sir! Or so I thought, when I saw this staring unobtrusively from the beer cooler at Lone Star Liquor Company in Breckenridge (cool name, by the way). But the guy behind the counter swore by it, so I bought a sixer. Whoof. This is one damned fine brew. Pours that deep, satisfying ruby-mahogany color you'd expect. You can smell the malt. Tastes delicious, malty, sweet, just a background trace of hops (those Scots emphasize the malt over the hops). But be careful: at 8% abv, this beer will sneak up on you! I can now safely say, Drink beer from a CAN? Why yes, I believe I will, thanks!"
"Pours a deep dark brown color with a light tan head that leaves a fair amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The almost stout-like aroma features a lot of malt and a bit of smoke. The taste is much like the smell with a lot of dark roasted malt flavors and a nice smokey and bitter finish that features some warming from the alcohol. Overall, this is a rather enjoyable brew that does a pretty decent job of hiding its high alcohol content. I would recommend and certainly have no objections to trying this brew again."
"Overall Impression: Very enjoyable brew. Hard to say its better than Dales Pale, just different. Id take either one any day."
"Popping the can and pouring reveals a liquid of a very dark, rich brown, almost coffee-black, with a collar of foam. Aromas are rich and balanced, and evocative of chocolate, fudge, and vanilla. Very smooth and silky on the tongue, with subdued carbonation that's only big enough to add a touch of sharpness to an otherwise thick, could-be-sludgy beer. The taste is just right for the style, with robust chocolate malt and vanilla notes balanced by moderate bitterness. Very well done. Not exactly sessionable due to the high ABV, but certainly a very good beer for a special occasion or even every day drinking (in small amounts)."
"Drinkability: Very nice Scottish Ale Nice malt character and nice warming from alcohol"
"Poured beer into tumbler from can at 48 degrees. Beer was black with a nice brown head. Beer smelled really good like a nut brown ale that had been made right in front of ya. Nuts and toffee and Chocolate oozzed from this brew. Taste was good, but a wee bit tight on the alcohole. If it had a wee bit less of that I think the flavor would reall jump out. I will say that I will try this brew again."
"D: Nice beer, especially for one in a can. Good balance, not overwhelming in any one direction. And the alcohol does a great job of hiding itself."
"I must admit this beer grew on me somewhat"
"Old Chub - Scottish Style Ale pours a dark brown with a big tan head from a twelve ounce can. Chocolate malts and toffee are most noticeable in the aroma. Thick mouthfeel, nice toffee and chocolate flavors, a bit of coffee too. Wow, good stuff. Highly recommended."
"Pours a clear deep dark mahogony with a giant tan foamy head. A pretty good looking beer with good lacing. The smell is pungent with dark fruit,alcohol, and a strong ""bisquity"" aroma. The taste is very like a porter, coffee, dark fruit,alcohol, and bread yeast. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. This beer is the best canned beer I've ever had and it really is a top quality brew. It's tough getting over the can,but man it's good."
"I enjoyed this beer with a coulpe of friends on a -10° night needless to say we stayed warm and really enjoyed the brew. Nice work Dale and crew! I think the Scotts would be proud."
"Drinkability: surprisingly flavorful and quenching beer. Don't let the can fool you - this is a nice beer."
"This Scottish style ale poured a clear, very deep red-chestnut color with tall, fluffy, brown foam that persisted, and clung to the glass in rings. There was a good carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The smell was richly malty with a hint of whiskey and a touch of cocoa. The taste was malty with a very light caramel sweetness that built to the finish. There was a light hoppiness beneath the malt, and perhaps a touch of peat smokiness (?). The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with full body and medium carbonation. It was warming. This was a very smooth and easy drinking beer for an 8% ABV brew. Probably one of the best beers available in a can in the US."
"At 8%, this is still very very drinkable beer. The alcohol cannot be tasted or sensed, though I bet it could be felt after a few more of these, particularly at the speed at which I'm drinking it. The whiskey will have to wait until the next time I have one, because as I wrap up this review, my glass is also almost finished. Cheers to Oskar Blues, as well as dogfooddog."
"What a surprise from a can. Definitely a higher shilling Scotttish Ale (think Scotch Ale). Inconsequential issues of style aside, this is ale achieves great complexity with a fairly simple palate of caramel, chocolate and a touch of smoked malt. The name rocks too."
"Highly recommended."
"Wow, that's well hidden."
"D - I'll have another please!"
"Super-enjoyable, ultra-delicious, really glad I picked this up and will absolutely be keeping a regular supply of this on hand."
""
"Drinkability of this beer was moderate. It was a pleasant sipping beer but the alcohol was a bit much against the not-so-strong flavors."
"My only 12oz can from Bauer Wines in Boston. Sadly this can had a twin, but it exploded in my checked luggage in the flight home. Damn you, TSA! At least now my suitcase smells like Old Chub. Aroma is nicely malty. Appearance is dark brown with very little carbonation and head. First taste is malty and actually a bit crisp, surprisingly. This one doesn't round out the mouth as much as I was expecting. Some might say it makes it ""drinkable"". Surprised to now check and find it's 8% alcohol - could be a bit of a dangerous combination. A decent brew."
"In place of my hot chocolate, I picture this brew, poured into a big wide-rimmed coffee glass, alongside a big Colombian breakfast of rice & beans, chorizo, choclo, & scrambled eggs. I wouldn't get up for about four hours, but it would so heavenly."
"Due to its softnesss and dryness, very drinkable. Interesting enough to hold the atteention of your palate as well. Really a quite fine beer."
"Yeah, great - big -beer in a can."
"D: Very drinkable brew, not heavy but enough body to find complexity. Much better taste poured into a glass than straight from the can. The alcohol is hidden so well it just shows as a warm feeling in the stomach."
"D- nice take on the style but the chocolatey taste didnt rub me right, as it warms it is easier to take. Worth a try, but once will be good for me."
"The body is closer to full feeling. A rich, malty feel that lingers. Light on carbonation but acceptable. The higher ABV isn't really noticeable but leaves a warming feeling as you go along. Overall a great example of a Scottish ale."
"D - I just hope my opinion wasn't swayed by the fact that this comes from a can. Great flavors that finish very strong, but it seemed a little on the flat side. But you know what...I can honeslty say that this was much better than I expected, so who cares about the serving type."
"Overall, this beer was not bad, but the taste didn't live up to the looks/smell."
"This beer pours very dark brown, nearly black, with garnet highlights around the edge. There is a massive tan head that has nearly the same kind of amazing retention as Dales Pale Ale. The smell conveys amazing malty sweetness and mocha aromas. The taste is fantastically big and sweet without any cloying finish, a great example of this fine balance of the Scottish style. The focus is totally on the malt here, with the hops not standing out as much more than bittering. The taste is of heavy malt and chocolaty roasted barley. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and creamy. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Dale makes some fine beer. I definitely recommend this one."
"Overall, a good drinking dark beer, will buy this one again."
"Overall a very robust Scottish Ale. A good ABV as well. Highly recommended."
"Good beer in a can."
"Wonderful beer and the can makes it a joy to kick back with. Yum!"
"Appears a deep ruddy ruby brown very cola esque forms a large overflowing tan head leaves nice even bands of lacing with each sip. Aroma great herbal hop presence but the big malty chocolate cocoa powder layers is where it's at in this brew. A creamy edge of caramel malt notes is also notable with a mild current of alcohol going through this brew. Flavor contains heavy chocolate notes almost lactic quality comes about sweet heavy with caramel and fruit soaked alcohol notes maybe some raisins and plums. Mouthfeel is medium bodied full syrupy feel even carbonation does the trick. Drinkability a solid brew that I could definitely bring to family around the holidays and enjoy with some festive dinners...very tasty stuff but sort of filling and hard to drink in number."
"Picked up six of this on a recent trip to Helen, GA. Opening the can lets out a pssst more like a coke than a beer. Pours a dark ruby cola brown with a thick light brown head. Nice lacing. Sweet aroma of chocolate and caramel malts and alcohol. Taste is rich and malty with just a hint of smokiness. Hops are faint but apparent. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. At 8% ABV not a session beer, but one to savor slowly. Imagine great beer,,, from a can!"
"Chocolate malty and alcohol aroma. Great brown colour with lace and mocha slight head. very much concur with the promotional markings, chocolate more than malt in the smell. Very smooth drink, caramel, chocolate, smoke, I would drink this on a regular basis. Missed it in Atlanta, found it in Buffalo."
"Great!"
"d - nice fall/winter brew. oskar's does a great job and having some beers in a can to choose from is nice when you're tailgating or camping."
"It's incredibly smooth and easy to drink. It's a hefty brew, but I had several of these over the past summer, and found it to be drinkable even then."
"D: Excellent tasting Scottish ale. High abv is there but very well masked by the creamyness. Only one or two of these in a sitting for me."
"Overall, if for some reason you dream of having a decent craft brew or if by some reason you lay awake at night thinking of a good scottish ale in a can this is probably your best bet. It was cool to try, I don't think I will get it again however, just a bit too much for me."
"12 oz can, poured into a thistle glass. This one is very deep amber color with a 3 finger tan head that falls to a half-finger after a short wait. There is pretty good clarity on this. Taking a sniff, there are big, thick caramel notes, with some light phenolics that are nice and smokey. There is a lot of caramel maltyness, but it is not exceptionally sweet. The flavor is vert full. Very solid deep caramel and even a touch of chocolate. There is a moderate smokeyness that is really tasty alongside the sweetness and maltyness. Mouthfeel is on the border between moderate and thick, with a fairly light carbonation that makes it feel more full. There is no tell on the alcohol in this brew from either the nose or the taste. It has a very solid aroma and flavor, and really keeps me coming back to the glass without any problems. This is a very nice Scottish ale."
"Pours gorgeously into a 20-ounce pub glass: deep ruddy chestnut body with an enormous, creamy beige head. Caramelly-sweet malt all over the nose with a slight hint of peat. Mostly a foretelling of a major malt-bomb, however. The taste is indeed on the sweet side, with the malts strongly resembling an apple-less caramel apple (does that make sense?). I also detect a hint of bitter chocolate and only a wisp of smoky peat flavor before an assertive earthy-mineral finish. Medium-full body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on slick. This isn't exactly my favorite style, but from what I've experienced, this is a rather exceptional representation of a Scottish Ale. Definitely recommended, at least for fans of the style."
"D-a very drinkable beer, high ABV so not really a session beer, but since it is in a can it will get my vote anytime I camp,etc (anywhere bottles are not too convienent) wish there was more craft brew in cans"
"The pour into my Hobgoblin tulip raises a nice 1 1/2 finger light tan head, which is the epitome of the beer. It sits on an opaque ruby-brown body. The nose is strong of burnt brown sugar, molasses, and caramel. It's over-burnt. The taste is dry brown sugar, and a bit of dark fruit. Really, pretty simple. The mouth is too thin, lowly carbonated. Needs more heft. This beer is far too dry and simple. I bought an entire case of this a while ago, and have had 3/4 of the case before a review. I don't know why there's any hype around this beer at all. McEwan's does a much better job."
"Mouthfeel is full, creamy with a light dryness on the finish. Drinkability is good based upon the smooth quality and light dry finish. A very nice surprise in a can!"
"Wow!!! A can? Are you kidding, this is maybe hands down the best American Scotch ale I've had outside of a brewpub. Outstanding. It was tough at first to let down my guard on the whole can thing, but if all craft beers could be this good and come from a can, screw the bottle."
"Danged tasty, this. I could see this being a staple, in constant rotation in my fridge, were it actually available here. A great-tasting solid, full-bodied Scotch ale in a can. Got to love that!"
"Sweet, malty taste, thick and packed with flavor. Silky smooth on the palate, with an alcohol spiciness that imparts a cherry-like flavor. Damned easy to drink and a very good beer."
"Got lucky and found a sixer of this beer at a grocery store for 6.99 and couldn't pass it up after reading the reviews on this site. The beer poured a very dark brown color with a 1 finger head that dissipated only slightly. The aroma was very malty and chocolatey with a slight whiff of smoked malts too. Taste was malty sweet and caramelly with notes of chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, smoke and a faint hop spiciness in the finish. Hops were very subdued as they should be for the style. The beer had a medium to full bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability was high. 8% alcohol was not evident. Another winner from the canned beer microbrewery. Now, if only I could find ""Gordon", their DIPA."
"Scotch Ales are generally not something I can drink in excess of two in a sitting, but not so with this beer. It's drinkability is amazing for such a thick, hearty beverage. It's taste is complex and satisfying but the can prevents you from taking it so seriously that you have to drink it in a special ritual. It's a fun beer that's easy to get your Bud/Miller/Heineken drinking friends to try."
"""Psst"" goes the can. Our pours a muddied garnet brown body with a finger of sudsy, medium cocoa brown head. Good lacing. Nose is caramelly with brown sugar dates, and lightly smoked, peaty edge. Toasted, caramelly, mapley, brown sugary malts up front. Peat malt detectable. Rounded, bitterness mellowed out by dates and meat in the finish. Nice! Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Another good can of beer from Oskar Blues. Now I just need to find me some Gordon! Perfect for that ski yurt trip."
"What a great beer from Oskar Blues. Get some if you can find it."
"HIGHLY recommended."
"12 oz. can with no freshness date. It pours with a thick, dark (unfiltered?) brown body and a small brownish head that reduces to a collar, leaving little lacing. The smell is smoky and earthy/woody with peat malts, toffee, buttery/butterscotch diacetyl, caramel/chocolate malts, and hints of whiskey. Overall soft, inviting, and quite aromatic. The taste follows suit with the addition of coffee and a mild bitterness from the leafy/green hops, on top of a medium body that is smooth and drying, leaving a medium finish. Oskar Blues has impressed me again... and ya gotta love those cans."
"Higher in ABV, but this one is a drinkable beer. Again I say what a nice suprise to see something like this out of a can."
"Oskar Blues once again shows that it's possible for good beer to come out of a can."
"I'm definitely going to have this again and again; perhaps next time with a biscotti or semi-sweet pastry."
"It has a very nice mouthfeel to it, it could have been a little chewier for my preferences. Not oily. Not very dry on the backtaste. Deceptively drinkable. It goes down very easily and I wasn't aware of the alcohol content until after I drank it. A very nice scottish ale indeed."
"Chewy, sticky mouthfeel lead off this sweet malty ride. Some notes of burnt caramel along with a touch of coffee due to roasted malts. Slightly bitter finish."
"I wasnt sure this one would measure up to the hype, but it actually exceeded my expectations. From the can, it pours a garnet-like, brownish, shimmering liquid with a shallow but blanketing tan head. Nice lace. The aroma explodes with toasted malt, caramel, and toffee smells. A bit of wood and some smoke qualities round out the smell. The taste is full of malt, but not too sweet. Its exceptionally well done. Toasted malt and bread-crust flavors mingle all the way through the experience, and into the finish. The finish is lingering and full of roasted character. Very clean and extremely drinkable."
"Overall, a great beer. Far superior to many other canned options, especially non-nitro options. Worth trying more than one."
"For a can this is damn good. I have had cans from DG Yuengling & Sons, as well as slyfox, and this definet;y rates up there can-wise"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beer is even slightly chewy. This is a dam fine malty beer. This beer is highly drinkable. I didnt have a clue about ABV of 8%. I wouldnt drink this from the can as it deserves a glass."
"It's the middle of June, so right away I'm thinking this isn't a good ale for the summer. This was also my first Scottish-style ale, and I do see some whiskey similarities in the palate but this isn't as complex. It's pretty much smokey chocolate."
"Chestnut/cola colour, dark and clear, with a dark tan head composed of fine bubbles. Plenty of lacing and decent retention, even after the foam fell to a ring. Aromas of caramel and toffee dominated, but a mild chocolate and roast completed the malt profile. Peat and charcoal character grew as it warmed and were very well balanced with the malt. Very malty and sweet, caramel and toffee, with low bitterness. Light smokiness and dried fruit as well, with chocolate growing in the finish. Medium bodied with medium/low carbonation, creamy texture with light alcohol warmth towards the end. A solid beer all around, enjoyable and easy to drink. This complemented my dinner very well (BBQ brisket). I'll recommend this to some friends who enjoy Scottish-style and smoked beers."
"Notes: Someone put Scotland in a can! Very nice beer. The alcohol doesn't show through like I expected. This could be a very dangerous beer to drink a sixer of, because it would sneak up on you."
"Great offering and it's availability in a can, makes in even more interesting."
"Poured from the can nearly black. In low light I'm sure it would appear as black. Held to the light it's reddish brown, the red gleaming like a ruby. Head is almost brown as well. Nose is a wave of buttery diacetyl. I like diacetyl, but this was just a tad too much. There's a hint of caramel sugar but it's lost amidst the butter. Taste isn't as sweet as I'd like my scottish ales. I get a bit of barely sweet caramel, butter, and that's about it. I long for more in the taste dept since I love this style. The lacing all the way down is a nice touch though. It's heavenly carbonated but the bubbles feel almost delicate. Very nice. It glides over the tongue. Drinkability isn't so high. Even though I'm far from Scotland I can find better alternatives locally for this style."
"Good beer but not particularly representative of the style."
"Overall, this is made of quality, but it is just too sweet for my likings. The aftertaste just seems sugary."
"Body is damn near large on this one, with tiny bubbles of carbonation supporting a creamy, slick, dextrinous mouthfeel. Not a trace of the 8% until my second can, when I get unexpectadly relaxed and docile. Great beer in a can, let the revolution begin!"
"I have finally found my camping beer!!!"
"Overall, this could be a good brew if some things were changed up a bit. I have a can of Dale's Pale Ale in the fridge and am hoping it's better than this one, which wasn't bad but just didn't hit the mark for me."
"Old Chub is a malty, flavorful beer. Bitterness is just a minor player here. If you are a hophead, this won't make your top ten list. Don't let the can scare you, you're pouring it into a glass anyway."
"The aroma set the stage for some serious malt assault, and the flavor came through. In no way complex, it used the KISS method to deliver a sweet, malt-bomb experience that was pretty much nothing but enjoyable. The hops were there as behind the scenes mitigators, and did their job admirable. It went down hella smooth, and welcomed an encore. Though, the ABV is quite well disguised, and I could see an issue for the uninitiated. It may step off the reservation a bit style-wise, but it's well worth it. Good beer in a can...this is a trend one has to like."
"Even though Old Chub isn't as good as Dale's Pale Ale (relative to style), it's still the best Scottish/Scotch Ale that one is likely to find in a can. I'd like to see a more complex flavor profile before I jump on the Old Chub bandwagon with both feet, but if I was a camper, I'd load up on both this beer and Dale's so that my malt moods and my hops moods would be equally well-covered."
"I am kicking myself for not having tried this before. I will be stocking up on this stuff at every chance. The verdict is in now that I'm half way through this- hands down the best scottish ale I've ever had. Highly recommended!"
"Wasn't sure what to expect from this one when I spotted it in the store, seeing that it's a canned Scottish ale, maybe the only one of its kind. Taking a chance on a six pack, it proved to be decent enough. Not the best but not bad by any stretch. I tried it both from the can and poured into a pint glass, and the glass is certainly better though the can is serviceable. The nose is caramel and malty as might be expected. The taste of roasted malt combined with a little smokiness upfront makes for a nice flavor profile, but it ends up just a little too sweet. Not sure if I could drink a few of these in a row, but one or two are quite agreeable."
"Nice Coca Cola color and malt characteristics."
"Pours from the can a dark brown to deep red color with a smaller tan head and moderate lacing. Smokey nose with a bit of a cocoa edge to it. Slight scotch alcohol burn. Taste has more of that cocoa powder maltyness in it. There's an intensity of malt flavors up front. Lots of variation of chocolates in here. Sweet honey bread taste and dark fruits compliment the chocolate. An earthy hoppy flavor and peat smoke slip in. Not too strong but they add another element to the flavor profile. Finish is a bit smoky, slightly alcoholic tasting, but still quite sweet and more caramelly. This is dessert in a can. I would love to have this while out on Lake Michigan or golfing."
"Overall- The best, if not only, Scottish Ale in a can. For a canned beer this is phenomenal! I think this beer should be poured in a glass and drank. Good sipping beer!"
"I would have to say this was quite a bit darker than I thought it would be. When she brought me a 20 glass of very dark ale I was very happy. I think that the smell was a great indicator of what I was in store for. It had a rich coco smell with a very earthy undertone. When I drank the first beer I thought that the legs where very nice considering the low carbonation for this beer. As I drank the second one I noticed how boozy this beer is. I had just started my second when I felt a little buzz. I will be going back soon for another."
"D: Great for heavy sipping. I went back to the pub the next evening and ordered another Old Chub."
"Notes: A high quality scottish ale available in a can. If berweries more breweries were willing to start putting their products in cans, the stigma that follows cans might finally start to wane."
"Drinkability was pretty good. A nice quality beer, and as the brewer believes, if you put a good quality beer in a can, you'll get a good quality beer out."
"The drinkability is impaired somewhat by its thickness, but as for quality, this one is a new favourite. The 8% is nowhere to be found amid the rich tones of this brew. Absolutely stellar."
"I cannot believe this is in a can."
"What a nice suprise to find a craft beer in a can other than a nitro-type ale. But the fact that it comes in a can is not that important when compared to the quality of the brew. The color of the beer is a deep brick red, with a nice tan head that sticks around until the end of the beer. A huge aroma of roasted malty caramel, cocoa, and a hint of alcohol to let you know this is a fairly big beer. Great flavors you'd expect from a quality Scottish ale, sweet smoky malts, with a little bit of a tang, alcohol is pretty well hidden. I look forward to bringing these on campouts"
"Drinkability: Once it warms up, this beer displays all of its complexities; very nice"
"First try of a Oskar Blues brew new to NC.Poured a nice rich clear burgundy with a tight creamy slight off white one finger head that had some lasting power.When first poured the aromas seemed muted but after a minute nice caramel and chocolate infused fruity aromas started to stick out with a hint of smoke.True to form flavors for the style in my opinion,quite fruity and caramelly sweet,a sugar cookie typ flavor came on with a semi sweet chocolate note,finishing with a hint smoke.I think a good stab at a Scottish ale more like a wee heavy in its alc% and bigger chewey mouthfeel,very well done."
"A very dark brown beer with deep mahogony highlights. Has a big thick (spoonable) foamy dark beige head ( there was always a thin creamy bit of head all thru the glass). The aroma of sweet caramel malty goodness erupts from the glass. With just a hint of smoke in the background. The sweet caramel note hug the tip of your tongue while the roasted malt bitterness nips at the sides. The finish is a nice combo of easy bitterness and a smooth smokey note. Tasty."
"Good to see another craft brew in a can, though."
"Tastes of brown bread and molasses dominate, making the brew a bit overly sweet. A light metallic tang and slight tea-like bitterness is no match for the big sweet malt. A pleasant rummy fuminess provides a nice alcoholic breath."
"Well done Old Chub."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a complex malt scent that boasts of crystal, chocolate, and peated malts. It has a sweet malt aroma with a smokey, peated feel; very nice. The taste is good. It has a smooth and rich malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes roasted with some sweet burnt toffee aftertastes. This beer comes in at 8% abv., but it hides it well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. I love the aroma and taste. It has just enough peated malt to give it that slightly smokey edge, but it is dominated with sweet crystal and chocolate malts."
"So easy to drink I'll have to drink more."
"I saw the cans and I couldn't resist. Suprisingly good...very full and rich. Don't fear the can...the can is good."
"Aroma is chocolate malt, caramel malt and you definitely detect the smoked malt. Dark red/brown with a thin, but well established tan head. Huge malt flavors. Chocolate dominates with a very high intesnity flavor followed by smokey notes and a touch of caramel. Finish is clean with not even a hint of the 8% alcohol. Damn fine beer."
"It poured dark brown in color with an awesome full-on creamy, light tan head that's about a finger and a half deep. Certainly not the kind of head I would expect out of a can. The nose is also exceptional and appropriately forecast the complexity of the beer. I first smell some intensely sweet butterscotch notes with a faint cocoa-like background. The medium-to-heavy body is complimented with a full, creamy mouthfeel. There's a wonderful mix of flavors here; a pervasive butterscotch base, a highly creamy maltiness, just a hint of decadent dark chocolate notes lingering - a heavenly mix. Just when you think you're done, an awesome peat smoked essence flourishes mid-bottle. It finishes with a muted sweetness and a juicy caramel aspect that leaves you quenched and thirsting for more. The easiest drinking scottish ale I've ever encountered. Sensational."
"D- Very easy to sip, I still would not drink it out of the can ... a beer like this needs a glass no matter what. One of the most amazing beers in a can ... I'd easily have this beer around all of the time."
"best beer i've ever had from a can, without a doubt."
"Received from Zorro in BIF 24."
"Scots wha hey!"
"I was so eager to try this beer, as it came in a can. I'd always heard the myth that beer tasted better out of a bottle. Seemed psychological to me. Well this canned beer is one mighty fine tasting product. The appearance was a brownish burgundy color with a large head that dissappeared rather quickly. The smell was a very inviting smoky malt with a hint of caramel. The taste was a very rich maltiness. This is an extremely drinkable beer and I highly recommend trying it."
"This is a good example of Scottish Ale. Rich and caramely, smooth, slightly smoky, and a very low hop character. If it wasn't for the ABV, this would be a great session beer. Well made and recommended."
"By far the best beer I've had in a can yet (and that includes all those nitro imports.) The beer is very dark brown, almost stout-like, with a disappointing head, but after that its great. The aroma is strong, toffee / caramel / malt and toasty, with some hints of vanilla and chocolate. The flavor follows that up perfectly, rich and robust, sweet but not cloying, with a deep malt profile and a lot of extra-special flavors like caramel and toffee again, as well as some slight dried fruit flavors and enough bitterness for balance (given that this should be a sweeter beer). The mouthfeel is rich and thick. Awesome."
"As I smelled this ale the roasted chocolate, smokey nuts, and some floural essence is very present maybe honeydew, lilacs. The taste of this beer is sweet up front with chocolate malt that penatrates to core of the palate, then a small hint of bitterness rises up from the malted chocolate to relax the palate after the sweetness and finished with a smokey smooth coating on the throat like a finely made ""bechemel sauce"". This is a fantastic brew one that I wish I bought more of."
"Packaged in a 12-oz aluminum can that wouldn't look out of place in the cola aisle. Never judge a book..."
"Old Chub eh? Sounds more like a... Actually this is the best beer I've had out of a can. This far surpassed my expectations. I was expecting something bland and average, nothing too bold. What I got was a beer with a very strong malt backbone and alcohol kick. The smell was just as you would expect with a strong Scottish Style, a little smokey, big malt, some light peat, and an alcohol tinge. All in all a great beer. It's definately one of the more drinkable of this style. Don't know if it would be a good conversion beer, but it would be a good beer to give to someone who's looking to expand their palate a bit. I just wish SC would get rid of this stupid cap law, so we could get it down here."
"Translucent dark brown with a large off white head. Sticky bubbles and a stubborn 1/8 inch head remains. Smell is smoky chocolatey malts with a little raisin or prune mixed in. Sweet chocolate and mild alcohol throughout the taste, with a long sweet finish. Mouthfeel seems a bit light for such a sweet brew. Drinkability is not bad, the ABV is a bit high for session work. Gotta try one."
"poured a very deep brawon color with some reddish highlights. Massive tannish puffy long-lasting head. Beautiful lacing ont the side of the glass. Smell is a complex (and superb) moxture of caramel, chocolate (biitter), toffee, coffee, and dark fruits (figs, dates). Very nice. Taste is roasted malt all the way. Medium sweet, as it should be. Very creamy in the mouth and it touches the tongue as smooth as velvet. Finishes with a nice mild dryness and is the perfect ending for this beer. Hides the alcohol very well. I would almost consider this to be more like a Wee Heavy. Excellent first-rate beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: While I wouldn't label it a scottish ale, this is a killer brew. Whatever style you give it, it's a highly drinkable and tasty brew. Go for this, not the Dave's Pale Ale. Yes!! CRAFT BEER IN A CAN!!"
"Smell is toasty, roasty, and smokey goodness. The taste is mostly roasted malt with some hop bitterness. The bitterness of the the roasted malt is nicely balanced by tons of sweetness too. It feels nice in the mouth. But, man, is this beer drinkable. You never could guess it's 8%. Like Dale's Pale Ale, it's an amazing beer from a can. Very, very nice."
"A good, drinkable scotch ale that I will certainly enjoy again."
"The finest canned beer I've had, but that doesn't say alot when compared to the competition. Good stuff and I have to give credit to a small local brewery who pushes the packaging envelope, especially considering it's ABV."
"12 ounce can. Pours dark as molasas amber, Minor tan head and some blotchy lacing left behind. Nose is richly of peaty, sweet malt. This is a rich, flavorful scottish ale. Bold, full flavor and tasty. Fine brew indeed out of a can. Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety smooth, with a long soft finish. Well worth a try and at 8% this one packs a punch as well. Nicely done Oskars!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" dark tan head above the dark, deep burgundy brown brew. Head fades rather quickly to an uneven layer of bubbles, with minimal lacing. Aroma is dark hearty malts, with a smokey peat tinge running through it, and alcohol apparent. Taste is just what I would expect from a Scottish-style ale. Smoke and dark malts upfront, a grain husky heartiness to it all, and then sliding into the lightly fruity alcohol notes. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great on this one. Wow, this was in a can?"
"Poured from an aluminum can transported to NYC from Seattle's Bottleworks beer store. Poured into a pint glass, a very dark, almost opaque brown, with a thin head that recedes to almost nothing. Smells like maple brown sugar. Tastes like more of the same, toasted brown sugar and a little bit of smoke, as well as a bit of Tootsie roll-like cocoa powder. SLightly dry and bitter finish, but malt is the master here. Mouthfeel, like the Dale's Pale Ale, falls a bit short, but for this style it works a little bit better. Another impressive canned brew from Oskar Blues."
"Pours from the can with a tight light brown head settling over clear dark reddish brown liquid. The nose is dark chocolate some sweet and roasted maltiness behind it. Taste is heavy on sweet malt,mild molasses, chocolate, light hoppiness and some alcohol all wrapped within a viscuous mouthfeel. Finishes slightly smoky, delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, sweet, and well balanced. Nicest beer out of a can I've had."
"I do wish for a touch more complexity but this is still a very well put together and enjoyable beer."
"Can obtained from Liquor Mart (Boulder) and consumed a couple evenings later. Poours a half-finger light tan head over a very dark red/mahogeny liquid. Crystal clear. Smells dark rich careml and chocoalte. Tastes potently caramel with a little bit of sour. Some chocolate and dates. Alcohol sting in the finish that persists into the after-taste. Md body and over carbonated."
"Nary a ""pfft!"" when this one opens. Sounded like there was no carbonation in this one at all. Pours a very dark ruby-brown in color. Minimal head. Aromas are certainly sweet. Lots of caramel, sugary toffee, maybe some dark fruits as well. Touch of ETOH. Some smoke. Complex. Flavor is tasty. Again, lots of sweetness here, with a good Heath bar impersonation. Bit of warmth in the belly at the end. Thinner than expected but not enough to turn up my nose. Who would ever have thought a canned beer would get a 4 in drinkability? Here's a good beer for tailgating before the football game. Screw those macors in their plastic bottles."
"I am running out today to stock up on this puppy."
"Oskar Blues' Old Chub pours a clear, very dark mahogany body with glimmering ruby highlights beneath a full head of creamy tan foam that slowly dwindles to a wide collar. The nose suggests cocoa and a touch of roastiness with the initial whiff, and then some darker chocolate and a mild fruitiness appear. It's full bodied and creamy-smooth across the palate with a restrained carbonation. The flavor is richly malty with notes of chocolate-flavored toffee, caramel, a hint of coffee, and more dark chocolate. The bitterness is restrained, but firm enough to balance it; and it's never cloying. A touch of bitterness and some mild roastiness linger in the finish along with a note of peat-smoked malt. Overall, it may be a bit chocolatey, but other than that, this wee heavy is dead on! Certainly worth trying."
"-UF"
"delightfully suprised by this canned beauty. 1 finger of caramel colored head on dark brew with a faint amber glow. head goes down to a thin bubbly layer. i smell chocolate, caramel and toasted malts. carmel sweetness comes out first with a little bitterness in the end to balance. after it warms up a little, it becomes thick, smooth and perfectly carbonated."
"Rich and complex, yet decently smooth, this is a winner. I drank this one on a boiling hot day and liked it. I imagine I'd appreciate the complexity (chocolate, coffee, and on, and on) more on a cold day, but I'm not complaining. This is really well made. It's not trying any smoke and mirror tricks by overwhelming drinkers with certain tastes. It's kind of subtle in its way. There are a nice amount of hops for such a rich, malty beer. Awww, just try it. I don't know what else to say."
"This is an excellent American rendition of a strong Scottish Ale. Tasty, and quite drinkable. I'm impressed with the smoked maltiness and masked abv. More impressed, that this comes out of a can."
"Over all a fine beer..best ever ina can. Will have again."
"A ruddy-faced amber. thinnish froth (if you must pour) that doesn't say much before good-bye. This is a malt bomb. Dried fruit caramel. Jam-covered toast points. This would raise my kilt once, but I wouldn't dance around kicking up my knees over it. Bit smoky, toasty and warming. Almost too sweet. Old Chub in a can... This would be really nice on a late summer camping trip."
"Loved this beer! Drank from the can, so appearance rating is dead center. Hey, they went to alot of trouble to get it into the can, so why not use it? Also their little blurbs on the can lead one to believe they intend for you to enjoy it from the can. Hard to get a read on the nose through the little hole in the can, but I did detect some sweet malt and caramel. The taste is incredible - chocolate, coffee, toffee, sweet malt syrup...not really scotch ale territory in my opinion, but hey. Pleasantly thick in the mouth, almost comforting. I found this to be very drinkable - a dangerous trait in a beer with 8 abv. Go git yo' self some."
"At first glance, I thought, ""what's up with a seemingly upscale scotch ale...in a can?"" Well, the people at Oskar Blues pretty much pulled it off. Pours a generous, lacy head that caused me to let it settle in before draining the can. Smells very, very malty, with hints of raisins and plums. Taste is very deep and rich, like the best scotch ales, without the faintest trace of hops. All in all a decent brew that suprised me..."
"I had no idea whatsoever what think of this stuff when I first saw it. Scottish ale? From the USA? In a can? Called ""Old Chub""? What in bloody hell is this? It looks decent. Very, very dark red in colour with a slightly off-white head that dissipates quickly into a thin haze over the surface of the liquid. The smell is alright, I suppose. A little malty, not really much here. Didn't smell like much of anything. The taste, however, is fantastic! This is almost a smoke beer! Quite malty and very, very smoky in flavour!! Very tasty indeed. Absolutely full of smoke flavour. And the mouthfeel? Very, very smooth!! I do not hand out 5.0's very often at all, but here, one is certainly in order. This is very, very smooth and easy going brew. The package suggests that this is just awful. I mean, look at it. A Scottish ale from the USA in a 6pk can package called ""Old Chub""? For Heaven's sake. Who thinks this sounds tasty? I do, however, encourage those who doubt it to try it. It is indeed very surprising. I WILL buy it again."
"This certainly isn't the most interesting of heavy malty beers."
"The taste is of brown and caramel malt and is somewhat sweet. There is body to it, but the process of drinking from a can makes it difficult to fully appreciate flavors. A clean aftertaste leaves only a hint of smokiness and a desire for more. And more. Hmmm.... maybe this is perfect for camping."
"The strangest thing about this beer (stranger than it being from a can) is the aftertaste. An almost acrid sweetness that does not sit well with me. I was only able to finish half of the can."
"May be the best beer ever put in to a can."
"A fine scotch ale. A perfect night cap on a cold, February night."
"Drinkability  This is a thick, satisfying ale that is well worth the $1.49/can price tag. I wont make any comments about swallowing old chub all night long, but suffice it to say that this is more than a gimmick."
"Taste is of rich caramel malt and then the chocolate malt takes over and gives a roasted coffee flavor as it finishes. Smoky. Smooth and creamy. Something is not quite right but the taste is fine. Something just a bit haphazard. But it's very good and drinkable. The best canned beer I've had outside of Young's Chocolate Stout in the nitro can."
"Drinkability is high, way easy to drink, you would never know it is an 8% brew from the taste."
"Theres a definite smoky malt to the aroma and something that reminds me of peanuts (something about peat smoke is reminiscent of boiled peanuts to me for some reason). Theres a big dose of brown sugar and caramel with the peat smoke in the flavor along with a slight bit of cocoa. A bit sticky but very tasty. The can doesnt make any negative difference."
"Overall, a nice, well-balanced, scottish ale. Definitely the best beer I've ever had in a can."
"Tawny-crimson bronze in hue, beautiful color depth, when held to a light a shiny coppery color emerged around the edges. A foamy beige head reached two fingers in height, on a slightly harder pour than normal, the head retention was good as it took a long moment before it collapsed to a soapy cap, then collar. The subsequent lacing was very webby, unorganized, but quite prevalent. The bouquet had good potency, lovely fruity sweet notes upfront but the closer I stuck my nose to the glass the more malty the beer smelled; notes of smoke, chocolate, burnt grains, as a whole it is very nice! Inviting. The palate is plenty tasty, vague smoky and burnt malts, a hint of sweet fruitiness, a fair amount of roastiness too, maybe a kiss of grassy hops at the finish. Long aftertaste than just begs me to eat some grilled meat. I like the taste might fine, it isnt that complex but I can live with that as the flavor construction is well thought-out and nicely balanced. I never would have guessed this had an 8% abv, I couldnt taste a lick of alcohol nor did I feel it. The mouthfeel was very ordinary; it is also a bit under-carbonated, kind of slick too but nothing to really complain about. This is highly drinkable; I cant believe a beer like this is available in a can! Beer drinkers in CO are so lucky. Bastards. Old Chub is labeled as a Scottish-style Ale, maybe a Scotch Ale is more accurate. Anyway. I purchased a single can for $1.49 in Fort Collins. Recommended."
"Pours a clear deep amber color, and is topped by a good light brown head. Sticky, malty, candied notes waft from my glass as I pour. When I go in for a deeper sniff, I get toasted malt notes and a hint of roast malt at the end. Wow, this has a good solid mouthfeel and a nice rich body. There are lots of malt flavors here (caramel, biscuit, quite chewy actually). Perhaps a hint of roasty smoke in the finish. This beer is also subtly fruity with notes of raisins in it. This is a damn good beer in a can, certainly the best I have had up to this point. The hop perception is appropriately quite low, with only a hint of balancing bitterness in the finish. This is damn taste, for any beer, and it really hits the spot right now."
"12 ounce can. I will no longer shy away from a can after having this beer."
"Cabonation is sparse. Somewhat light in flavor. Chocolate, subtle smokiness sweet malts and a nice hop bite on the finish. Mouthfeel is full until then finish when it thins out and becomes watery. Nice flavor profile throughout the beer. Nothing great, but totally solid."
"The second canned beer from this great Colorado brewery, and as It sets in the glass a quite deep sanguineous color with ruby high lights, head is portly in size, creamy in texture and the color a toothsome light tan, as the head slowly evaporates a fine sheet of lace develops to seal off the glass, and as its consumed a fine set of Irish Rings is left behind to track your progress. Sweet malt nose, hints of toasted grain, fresh, crisp and quite pleasing to the olfactory and Ocular senses, start is sweet, nicely malted, top rich and pleasant in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops delightful in their spiciness, aftertaste quite dry, a fine representative to the style and one unfortunately we dont see much of here in the west."
"Nice, dark ruby-brown with a finely beaded coffee-tan head. Aroma is mildly peaty, hints of chocolate, and coffee. Sweet coffee beginning, slight smoke and grains, and dotted with butterscotch, followed by a somewhat sharp hops bite, roasted grain bitterness, and bitter chocolate finish. Very mild, soft mouthfeel. You would never guess that this is a 8.0% beer! Not bad at all... but I'd probably pick up the Dale's Pale Ale given a choice of the two,"
