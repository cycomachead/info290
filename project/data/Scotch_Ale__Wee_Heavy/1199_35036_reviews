"This is a thick, rich, malty gem that I hope I will be able to try again some day."

"Doing a side-by-side with '13 and '14 bottles, as air just have one '12 left that I'll save for a longer vertical in the future. No distinguishable difference on the pour. On the nose, the '13 has a slightly stronger bourbon scent. That carries through to the taste as well, with the '13 also having a just a touch more caramel sweetness. This makes me assume they keep their bourbon barrels on a 3-year rotation like they do with KBS. Overall there's not much difference at all between the batches, now 5 months and 17 months old. Will be curious to see how much difference is present with a bigger lineup in a couple years."

"O: Very drinkable, very smooth, tasty, it’s a 2013 and the bourbon and alcohol leave a slight burn on the palate, but overall, very good. Kind of reminds me of a barrel aged barleywine as the Scotch ale characteristics are absent."
""
"It is rare that I find a beer that just makes me want to have more than one at a sitting.  Backwoods Bastard is just that.  It is a very complex brew, similar to a good Scotch Ale but with a lot of subtle complexities.  Obviously that comes from the aging process in Bourbon Casks.  The taste is dark fruit, peat, chocolate and bourbon.   It has a little more hops on the finish than I generally like, but this is a world class brew.  Watch out however if you do engage and have more than a couple at a sitting because it is a 10.2% brew and they do sneak up on you.  Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"This beer definitely lives up to the hype. The oak-bourbon-vanilla flavor is the best I have had among beers with a flavor similar to this (Dragon's Milk and Pilgrim's Dole come to mind). A little more complexity in the aroma and flavor might have improved this beer, but no major complaints. Definitely a beer to sip and savor. Glad I was able to snag the last 4-pack of this at a local liquor store."
""
""
"A little bit rye whiskey, a little bit porter. Smooth and flat and more like settling in with a glass of whiskey. Flavor-wise there."

"Very close to Weyerbacher Insanity, a bit smoother with not as much bourbon. For my taste I prefer Insanity over BB. Great Ale and I will buy it when ever I can find it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - really enjoyable, very tasty and very smooth for the abv.  Too bad that I could only get 2 bottles, hopefully I can load up next time."
"Like butterscotch!  Let her sit for a bit after taking out the fridge.  Glad I loaded up on this stuff this year.  Looking forward to see what age has to offer.  Cheers!"
""
"A Little bit on the sweet side for me"
""
""
"One of my all time favorites!  I sip this one on special occasions, especially when celebrating success at work and wins by my favorite teams!  I go to great lengths to purchase as much as I can."

"5th tasting of the evening. Smell is bourbon and oak, burnt malt, taste follows with hints of vanilla and coconut. This bastard is smoo-oo-oo-ooth. Too smooth. This is sneaky smooth"
"Overall this is a delicious brew.  I love subtly barreled brews and this one is very well done at a very reasonable price.  Another master crafted brews from the Founders team!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really a wonderful beer, especially during these winter months. The sweet malts compliment the bournon barrel quailities very well. I dont know if this is what i imagine the perfect BBA scotch ale to be, but its damn close. The warmer it got the higher i rated it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank fresh on tap, increased ratings accordingly."
""

"Mouthfeel is smooth and clean. Overall, quite good."

"Creamy, lingering sweetness, boozy finish"
""
"12oz bottle into nonic. Clear dark ruby/amber with two finger khaki foamy head. Lacing all the way down. Smells of coconut, dark fruits, vanilla, and wood. No obvious bourbon notes. Flavor is malty and sweet with more coconut, vanilla, booze, caramel, and wood. Slight hop bitterness on the swallow. Medium bodied, creamy, low carbonation, and a touch thin."
"Any praise this beer gets would struggle to do it justice. It is phenomenal. From the aroma to the aftertaste it is a captivating, thrilling experience and keeps the alcohol so well in proportion with the bourbon and malt flavours. It is unbelievable pleasant and easy to drink, suited well to a cold winter night, and I beer I will be making a concerted effort to acquire more of. A delight!"
""
"Very solid taste and feel!"
"Blue cheese nose. Toasted coconut. Bourbon & oak for days. Better as it warms."
"Do u like bourbon? Cuz theres a ton of it to be had in this founders offering. Has opened my eyes to what can be done with a bourbon barrel aside from the usual (stout) suspects. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"Be warned; there is A LOT of bourbon in this beer. It's sweet and malty, but bourbon is the dominate flavor in this beer. The alcohol is NOT masked at all. Imagine drinking a viscous, carbonated bourbon with 1/4 the alcohol content. That's backwoods. Sorry, but I'm not a fan. I like BBA stouts and even barely or wheat wines. This is not for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer from Founders!"
""
""
"I think this may be my favorite beer now.  Dark brown in color but somewhat clear.  Sweet nutty aroma with bourbon.  The tast is carmel and bourbon with a lite sweet taste.  No bitterness.  This is one of the quintessential beers.  I could drink this everyday."
""
"Had this from several different years and has always been good. Definitely better at room temperature and be aware you can taste that 10.2%"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks of deep walnut. Carries a nutty, toffee, vanilla and an amazing bourbon barrel scent.  Dark, sweet and vinous fruit.  Tastes like figs and dates quite distinctly. Spicy and roasted malt.  Clean scotch cask flavor with rough barrel of bourbon. Big bodied beer. Very exceptional."
""
""
"The Mixed Drink of Beers. Okay head. Nothing special there. Rich, brown color. Smells sweet, you can smell the alcohol as well. Smells of whisky/bourbon. Tastes sweet, but harsh. You can definitely taste the alcohol, it's not masked much at all. A great beer for a whisky drinker, not so much for me."
""
""
""
"Loved this beer very smooth and a wee bit heavy but I loved it"
""
"Wee heavy? More like quite heavy, but this was worth savoring and the warming effect of the alcohol complemented everything else nicely. Founders brews some amazing beers and this one was no exception to it. I need to get a four-pack for this house and age a few as so many here have done. Shame that this was a fall release as I'd love this for all of the cooler months of the year. Yes, it's that good!"
"Overall- this is a fantastic and well rounded brew that has taken all the good things out of the barrel aging and left nothing behind. Drinking this with just under six months of age on it. I would love some more to be able to age and have the barrel flavors develop further. Great stuff!"
"Served in an oversized wine glass"
""
"One of the best barrel aged beers I've had. Pours like motor oil, the head is maybe 1/8th of an inch high bronze color. The smell is a good balance between bourbon, oak, vanilla, nuts and dark fruit. The taste is fantastically layered. Starts with a captivating bourbon dominance, transitions into layers of dark fruit and oak and finishes with a very long vanilla note. The feel is creamy and complex. Laid a few down in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tons of vanilla and dark fruits. Prob the best Scotch ale out there IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it! Would drink it year round."
""
"Had on tap, good beer. Very dark and almost black and smells oaky and scotch-y. Also tastes very oaky from the barrel aging and slightly overpowers the peated scotch-y malts. Bourbon tastes are incredibly apparent as well and this is a very boozy tasting beer. The scotch ale style has some malty sweetness to balance this out but this beer could use some aging to open up more flavors and depth. Definitely a recommended beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink fresh...have recently had a '12, '13, and a '14.  This bourbon bomb needs no mellowing."
""
"Best Founders Brew I have had!"
""
"This doesn't taste like beer, but I like it."
""
""
"Ooooh yes that's the stuff"
""
""
""
"Was really excited to get to try this one, but was immediately surprised by the hefty booze notes, both in the nose and on the palate. The purported smoky notes, which I'd hoped would balance out the booze and attendant sweetness, struggled to come through. There's certainly some dark fruit and toffee-like sweetness throughout, but they're not particularly inviting accords in lieu of the dominating bourbon. Yet another beer I just don't get."
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed this one. The bourbon flavor mixed perfectly with the chocolate and malt."
""
"This is a very interesting and unique ale, never had anything quite like it before. The scent hints at massive bourbon flavor, but the taste is surprisingly mild. Very smooth and easy drinking. Flavors are primarily toffee, caramel, creme brulee, bourbon, and a hint of chocolate. Very refreshing and doesn't have the bite associated with most bourbon aged beers."
""
"Really like the ale aged in bourbon barrels.  This is one of the better founders beer I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Such a perfect balance of complex malts and bourbon barrel character. It almost seems to evolve as you drink it - and the unexpected chocolate flavor was a nice surprise. Worth seeking out"
""
""
""
"For a craft beer very good"
""
"Surprisingly pleasant aroma of bourbon, toffee, caramel, and wood. The smell matches the taste. Its the aroma that really makes this wee heavy stand out the most to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a fantastic, outstanding beer!  Awesome flavors wrapped up in an equally awesome mouthfeel.  Be careful though, as with its awesome flavors and amazing masked alcohol, you might want to drink more than one at a time which could know you on your ass, real quick!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OK I'm not a big fan of Bourbon as a beer flavor!"
""
""
""
"This is an ok beer. I didn't expect the strong bourbon presence. It was evident from the time I popped the top until the time the final remnants finished rolling off my tongue.  To me, this was too overbearing. It was as though Founders took some ale and mixed it 50/50 with Beam. Beautiful deep red color and felt great on the tongue. Just couldn't get over thinking that I was drinking a cocktail."
""
""
"I love this beer, i just wish they would come out with this beer more then a month. The bourbon taste at the end of a sip taste amazing!Def a great beer to buy."
""
""
"Others in the class -barrel aged: Wulver ( fantastic but needs a lot more time to settle) and Ride the Lion (I have mixed feelings on this) are both great/good beers, if you like the style.  Alesmith Wee with a year on it is a delight"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Just from the nose I could tell this would be great and it was.  Rich toffee flavors and a mellow bourbon influence makes this incredibly smooth and easy to drink.   A sipper that sips very easily and isn't cloying in the least bit.  Given the price and quality of this beer this will be a seasonal must have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: With this style, it's easy to be boring, or do too much 'innovation'. This one nails it. Malt at the forefront, sweet overall but not too much, with whiskey spice and a bit of an ethanol reminder to really elevate it above the rest."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an absolutely outstanding beer!  It's powerful but not too overwhelming and I love the way it smells right after you open the bottle.  Drank all mine up, so I will have to wait until next year for more."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The power in this is in the initial aroma. Not as much bourbon as you would expect in the taste, which I don't mind. Very drinkable scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
"Gave it a couple shots spread out over time and I just cant get into it. Wayy too much booze on both the nose and the taste. Once you get past the booze there are some nice notes  hidden underneath but they are completely overwhelmed. The smell reminds me of a jack and coke. Taste is overwhelming booze then a decent bourboney finish. Will try to keep a couple in the cellar and see how it mellows with age..."
""
"O: This ended up being a mild whale for me and I'm not disappointed. It's special and robust and worth the hunt! I look forward to seeing it next year!"

"O – This is a very good beer.  The place where I picked it up had a limited release so I was expecting a lot from this one.  I am not sure I would go out of my way to make sure I get a bottle the next time it is release, but it is certainly worth trying."
"Best of its category in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Nice aroma. Nice start..... Then there is just thin alcohol."
""
"One of my favorite beers, so perfect so delicious."
""
""
""
""
"The color is almost black but with some burgundy shades. The foam is one finger high. The aroma is strong with vanilla and bourbon. The taste is sharp and sweet. Lots of vanilla and butterscotch. The finish is a bit smoky, which I personally like. It also cuts of the alcohol well. A very complex and strong ale. What I especially like about this beer is that you can really feel that it has been aged in bourbon barrels, both in taste and in the aroma."
"I like this brew, but I feel the bourbon is too dominant and doesn't allow the beer to shine."
""
""
""
"The color is a deep red/caramel tone with a thin-medium creamy head. Oaky and caramel, english toffee notes dominate the nose. The base beer, Dirty Bastard, is a classic Founders offering but this barrel aged version ramps up the flavor profile to 11. There are blended tones of vanilla, cherry/dried fruit and rich caramel all adding up to a complex, deep, woody ale. A phenomenal beer that shows incredible restraint on the booziness - this strikes me as one to enjoy fresh. Such complexity that demands your attention at each sip. Goes down smoothly, with a balanced body that has the perfect full feel without being sticky or too thick."
""
""
"Great color and I could smell the bourbon.  Not much foam and a little bit of bubble after it's poured.  Really enjoyed this beer."
""
"Found 2 4 packs in Nebraska in late December of all places. I'm assuming this beer is even better closer to the source. What can I say... One of the best winter beers money can buy."
""
""
""
""
"this beer looked and smelled great but was way too boozy, ruined the beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding beer. After the first sip I though I was imagining things. You know a beer is good when the last sip is as good as the first"
""
"First one was good. Next night better. 3rd one...out fuckin standing. Took a couple to really appreciate what's going on. One per session for me. Will be grabbing this whenever it is seen. Glad I couldn't get a single. Wouldn't have given it a second thought."
"Beer was not very good"
""
"Overall this is a damn good beer. It doesn't have an insanely huge barrel character, but it definitely adds to the beer perfectly. One of the better offerings I've had from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like liquid caramel.  I love it"
""
""
""
""
"It's basically a badass version of their Dirty Bastard (which is great). Bourbon is definitely the front runner on the nose and taste, but absolutely no bad tastes! Smooth my bros, smooth!"
"Not bad but the high alcohol content is overcompensated for by too much sweetness resulting in a syrupy beer that leaves some hoppiness or other flavor to be desired."
""
"If you love whiskey, and you love ales, you'll love this beer!"
""
"Strong and tasty.  Alcohol really jumps out at you.  Founders delivers again."
"I was blown away by this beer.  The bourbon flavor is perfectly balanced in this beautifully complex beer.  I want more!"
""
""
""
""
"O - love it. really, really, delicious sipper.  Suppose there's some minor improvements to be had, but fricking delicious.  A celebration of big beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The color is a very dark red burgundy shade with a small tannish head, not much lacing.  The beer seems cloudy with floating sediments.  The odor is bourbon, dark berry, cherry, woods, sweet, very rich, fig, dried fruits, dates.  The taste is dried fruits, dates, malt, sweet, berry.  Dry but not very bitter a aftertaste.  Aged a few months before trying."
"Bottle presence is strong. Can definately smell the alcohol and berry woody notes at the spout of the bottle. Initially poured about 2 ounces in a snifter. The color is rich and with full body. Upon initial swirl again the booze eminates strong but there is a very rich oak smell. The head is full but quickly dissipates as expected with the high alcohol content. The thickness of the beer is impressive and hold well to the glass. The temperature at taste is about 45 degrees Fahrenheit and this is where I feel the beer is at its best. Has a great mouth feel and the aging of the beer really shows through. The taste is super crisp and bites like a good whiskey. Over the course of an hour the drink warms but holds up well. Overall it makes for an overall enjoyable experience. There is a little room for improvement as the color muddied a bit as it warms , but I do enjoy this beer. Founders rarely disappoints me and this one holds up strong."
""
"this has always been a go to winter beer for me. This year it has a very creamy mouth feel, coats the mouth a lot though. Tastes good, but has a little bit of a banana taste to it. otherwise, it's still a favorite cold weather beer"

"Phenomenal beer. Everything you want in a BA beer."
"The best hands down scotch ale you will ever have."
""
""
"Looks great in the glass, smells like almost pure bourbon...taste has that similar twang that all befell KBS as well: where the bourbon seems to be somehow applied on top of the beer instead of a part of it, reaching an almost buttery flavor that almost puts you off, but not quite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoy this brew. Alcohol binding pretty well. Taste the bourbon in the after taste. Can't beat 2 in 1. Beer and bourbon."
""
"Good seasonal beer. Much more going for it than billed."
""
""
""
"Reddish brown hue with vanilla and bourbon in the aroma.  Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, and oak with a touch of heat on the finish.  I've never been a huge fan of any aging but this one works well.  Nicely done Founders!"
"This is an excellent bourbon barrel aged beer. The oak/vanilla/bourbon is somewhat downplayed compared to others that I've tried which often come across as cloyingly sweet. This been lets the underlying beer come through."
"This is my new favorite beer.  (For this week! )"
""
"As an initial foray in to the beer review community, what better brewery to start with than Founders? And what better selection than 2014 Backwoods Bastard? Admittedly, I am a little partial due to the fact that I grew up in metro Detroit, and was spoiled with the likes of world class breweries such as Founders and Bells. Now that I am living in South Carolina, I can appreciate their genius even more. Well it's Monday night.... what better way to usher in tedious Tuesday morning meetings than a midnight Wee Heavy that clocks in at 10.2%! I have tried many other Scotch Ales (Orkney, Old Chub, Innis & Gunn, McEwans, and more) but this one raises the bar for me. Dirty Bastard was always a favorite, but the barrel aging of this masterpiece sets it apart. The bourbon notes perfectly marry with the sweet caramel malts creating a warm and especially inviting beer. This is not for the faint of heart though. I would call it dangerously drinkable for those that can enjoy the aroma & warmth of bourbon and appreciate the syrupy splendor of sweet Scotch Ale. Give it to your friend that drinks Blue Moon and watch them recoil in horror. Share with an afficianado of spirits and you might find a convert. Best enjoyed in the company of a true Beer Advocate. This is simply too good to trifle with those that cannot appreciate it's perfection."

"Lots of vanilla! Too sweet for me but will be great for fans of bourbon aged beers"
""
""
""
"Overall, my favorite Founders brew second to KBS."
""
"2013 vintage. Really nice barrel influence on this to have such a presence after more than a year's aging. Nice cherry/plum flavors and hints of vanilla from the oak."
"Taste: Reminds me of drinking a Rootbeer & Windsor, There is a light fizz that dances on your tongue, coffee syrup aftertaste."
"Overall:  Wulver is better...I would take either, but prefer Wulver."
"O: This is a very interesting beer with an amazing aroma of caramel and big bourbon flavors that are a major part of everything. There is definitely some oak on the finish, but it is not overwhelming and is the perfect touch. This is a great beer, but personally I would like it more if the bourbon was slightly less pronounced. Nonetheless, it is a fantastic beer and now I am regretting only buying a single 12oz."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great beer but not exactly worthy of all the hype.  Thirsty Dog's Wulver on the other hand..."
""
"Good flavor but sticks on pallet"
"O- Regardless of style, this is simply one extraordinary BBA beer. The base beer (Dirty Bastard) is excellent in its own right, but after time in a bourbon barrel transforms it into a sublime libation. Founders continues to release very solid, barrel-aged beers with Backwoods Bastard being one that is often overlooked. (5.0)"
"O-  outstanding job by Founders.  I'm a sucker for KBS and stouts but this is a homerun for a scotch ale and is just a step behind KBS in my opinion.  I know quite a few people who enjoy this offering better actually.  It's smooth bourbon bliss in my book."

"Overall - boozy bourbon barrel beer and pretty good."

"The look is much the same as the standard dirty bastard.  The aroma is mostly bourbon with some sweetness.  Uh oh.  The first taste is a major surprise, having expected lots of harsh bourbon.  Actually, while the bourbon is present, the most amplified characteristic is vanilla, which sets in hard at mid palate.  Other flavors are something of a syrupy caramel, and of course a bit of alcohol on the finish.  The feel is wonderful.  Silky smooth.  My only regret was that I didn't drink it faster.  Not sure what happened, but after about 30-40 minutes the beer became sticky and cloying.  My ratings reflect the first half of the beer.  Still, I like to sip the heavy stuff, not sure I'd go back for this one."

"Medium brownish red pour (looks like dirty bastard). The smell doesn't jump out at you. You have to get down in there to smell it. Bourbon comes through though. Once you get past that there are all kinds of yummy smells in there. It tastes like bourbon. All the great flavors without the alcohol burn. It isn't overpowering. Keeps you coming back for more to try and figure it out. Great balance. Great beer."

"In the end, this functions well as a flavorful post-supper nite cap in the late year season. More world class from Founders."

""
""
""
""
""
"O. Very well done by founders.  Not too boozy and not too heavy.  Nice mouthfeel and just enough heat to let you know it's oak aged. The light carbonation is a nice touch also.  Everyone should try it at least once."

"A gift from a friend. Pours a deep reddish mahogany. The nose is sweet and boozy. Lots of bourbon flavor with a strong malt backbone. Very little vanilla shines through. Mostly oak and dark sticky fruits. The feel is thin with a nice alcohol burn on the tongue. This one is a perfect sipper enjoyed next to the dim light of the Christmas tree."
""
""
"O - An excellent brew and I am not a huge fan of scotch ales. I wish I picked up more than a single because I'd love to see how this beer ages."

"My neighbor was kind enough to share not one but two bottles of this woodsy aged oak goodness. If I can locate it within a reasonable distance I would for sure snag a sixer."
""
""
""

"Sweet. A bit syrupy. Slight barley wine taste. Gives way to slight peated whisky flavors. Slow sipper."

"This beer is one of my top 10 of all time, and I'm glad it is so easily attainable when it is released.  It pours a dark brown with a reddish tint.  Not much of a head and it quickly dissipates to nothing.  The smell leaves you with the impression that this will be a sweet beer, similar to a Southern Tier brew.  The taste strikes me as being an almost perfect balance of malts and bourbon.  The aftertaste is probably the best of any beer I have ever tried.  It leaves you with a sticky sweetness and a slight hint of oak.  The complexity is just amazing and if you sip the beer (as you should) by the end of your glass the temperature may be 10 degrees higher which accentuates even more flavors you may not have been conscious of before.  The more you drink this mysterious concoction, the more you appreciate such a well crafted beer."
"Founders knocked this one outta the park. Just a fantastic, well crafted beer for those who appreciate a beer a bit out of the norm."

"One of my favorite beers.  Super delicious and satisfying."
"O - This is a sipping beer, perfectly built for reading fireside on a cold, snowy Autumn afternoon.  Add someone you love to share the calm, and you just might glimpse the meaning of life well lived.  This may well be the best beer I have had this year so far."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep and clear brown. The thin tan head melts away quickly. The aroma smells like you're sitting in the barrel, bourbon sweetness dominating. The taste certainly brings the barrel, with nice notes of vanilla, oak and a hint of the bourbon itself. The body has a nice thickness and silky feeling, with an alcoholic tingle."

"Tried for first time tonight, wasn't sure what to expect... but exceeded expectations in smell and taste... not usually a scotch ale guy, but when aged in bourbon barrels, this was great beer... highly recommend trying, but starting to get hard to find... only available in November for retailers..."
""
""
"No beer is perfect, and it is totally by preference. And I will go out and say this is by far the best beer i've had so far. If you love bourbon, this beer is great. Some say this is a sipper, and I agree to enjoy it best. Aroma, look, labeling, very very pleased."

"Pours a two finger, off-white head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Deep ruby color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nice oak and bourbon nose. Flavor is similar with bourbon and oak, some malty sweetness. The high ABV is hidden. $3.50 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH."

"O- such an amazing beer. I highly recommend this beer. People are saying the 2014 batch is hot or not as good, bullshit. Its just as good. Go out and pick up a couple 4-packs and cellar some."
""

"This beer was a hot mess. The bourbon was hot, the scotch aspect was hot, it tastes like super sugary caramel covered in bourbon. I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't paid for it. Founders disappoints again."

"I love this beer. I had some of the 2013 batch for the first time a month ago and when it came out I bought 16 bottles of the 2014 batch and have had it on tap whenever I see it. fantastic beer!"

"Pours dark maroon with a slight dirty white head that quickly recedes. Aroma showcases that bourbon barrel wonderfully with some soft bourbon, oak, and vanilla and it pairs well with the beer which offers raisin, fig, cherry and caramel.  Flavor is downgrade; decent but not excellent. Bourbon stand on top of a thick malt foundation that does not come close to offering anything close to the depth I got from the aroma. Dark fruits and caramels are there but they don't really jump out at me, what I get in that first wave of flavor is all that there is, nothing really builds or evolves. Nothing new really comes at me mid sip or in the finish. Maybe a touch of hops are there mid to end stream, but minimal. A fuller mouthfeel, no activity. Overall, this one underwhelmed me in all honesty. In part because my expectations were sky high. A decent beer nothing outstanding and definitely not worth the $18 I spent on it."

"Tickling of the tongue, more carbonation than expected yet smooth none the less"
""
"Overall - An intense, complex ale that shows great depth of malt character with a surprising complexity of alcohol notes.  Oak character is a bit one dimensional but not overpowering of the wonderful underlying beer.  Just enough hop presence to make this behemoth of a beer more drinkable.  I have a feeling this might have been a bit harsh young but is good now.  And probably would have been better in another year.  Definitely one that holds up to age."

""
""
""

"Overall:  Was told to get this.  Pricy, but very good.   The alcohol is hidden very well, but at 10.2%, would not have more than two in a sitting.    A nice ""younger brother"" to the KBS (which is obviously better, but hard to get).   Would def. get another four pack.  Cheers!!"

"This is my first time having this beer (2014) and I love Bourbon Barrel Aged beers but this one is way too much bourbon. It's pretty much like bourbon that was aged in a beer barrel. No head. Low carb. Served in my Oskar Blues Rocks Glass which looks like a glass you'd drink whiskey from... very fitting. Founders- calm down the bourbon. It takes away from the beer."
"Thank you sir, I'll have another. This was everything I hoped it would be. Never found it to be overwhelming or out of balance in any facet. Maybe not for everyone, but definitely for me. Hank was right, a country boy can survive."

"This is my first time having this beer, and I'm hugely impressed. Split at cellar temperature with the lady after splitting a dirty bastard. I will admit that the neither of us are bourbon BA fans, but this has changed things. The flavors are so well integrated and blend way too well. This is entirely unsafe! It's unfair for it to be so delicious, coming from someone who does not enjoy bourbon in the least. I'm incredibly happy that I got a few of these. Can't wait to try it with several months/a year on it (if I can hold off, of course). Highly, highly recommended!"
"Dark brown with mahogany hues and a thin tan head that fades to a cap and some spotty lacing on the glass.  Really inviting aroma on this one.  Oak, bourbon, vanilla, malted milk, caramel, cocoa and some alcohol heat fill the nose.  Aroma made me think of bourbon balls with that same dessert like sweetness to it.  Dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, malted milk, bourbon soaked dark fruits, and oak flavors in abundance make this a complex sipper of a beer.  Smooth creamy feel with a medium body and semi dry finish.  Great texture and feel lends to sipping slowly.  Could it be less boozy?  Sure.  Could it have less barrel presence?  Perhaps.  Bottom line, who cares.  This beer is big, bold and unapologetic and I dig it."

"A lot of nice bourbon flavor without the kind of burn I would expect out of a 10+% brew. A little vanilla on the back end,  and even some creaminess,  if you haven't tried this beer before and you can find it in your area,  do yourself a favor and give it a go."
""
""
"O - This brew from Founders is another outstanding beer like most of their others. I'm happy to have landed a few bottles of this. I can only image this brew will improve with a little age on it but it is also an exceptional drinking beer within a couple of months off the bottling line."

"This is the best founders I've had so far. Highly recommend."
"O: [3.25] This is very alcohol forward in my opinion.  The booze and bourbon mute a lot of other flavors.  I let it warm before drinking.  Perhaps a colder beer would have suppressed the alcohol.  I had really high hopes for this - but I think it is just not my thing."

"O: I am a fan of bourbon, and a fan of the Dirty Bastard - as such, this makes for quite a beer for me. This 2014 bottle is the first time I've had the pleasure of tasting this since a Founder's tap takeover at Fries' Cafe around 2011 or so, and that may well be too long a span to go without this in my life."

"Overall: Another great brew from Founders. The brew melds big bourbon, a solid wee heavy, and a dominate oak very well to make a great drinking barrel aged beer. The only real complaint is that the body is a bit too thin. I think Alesmiths barrel aged wee heavy is still the best beer in this style but this is still a great beer and I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up when I see it again."
""

"Too much Bourbon flavor. Not enough smoothness in my opinion for a scotch ale which lowered its rating."

"A heavy looking beer that pours dark brown with a khaki head that leaves a lot of trail on the glass. The smell was full of wood and alcohol but also some vanilla on the end. The taste was amazing with hints of big flavors such as the vanilla and bourbon up front and then the sweet malt masking a slight burn on the end. Very well done and very tasty. Also really liked the weight of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, if you do not like bourbon, you are not going to enjoy this beer. It really isnt balanced really well. It does improve quite a bit as it warms. It is really hot initially though, like Curmudgeon is fresh.  My score is probably a little favorable because I love bourbon and think this is an excellent beer, but if you want a better balanced barrel aged Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy, try Wulver."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good barrel aged beer."
""
""
"Pours a thin white head, and dark garnet color when held to light. Bourbon flavor is well balanced and has a velvety mouth feel. Hints of toffee and milk chocolate come through with the oak and has a pronounced bourbon finish. If you like bourbon this is an excellent beer. Need to find more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I still find myself getting acclimated to the scotch ale styles since they are so unlike what I have conventionally accepted as beer. I have been a long time fan of good scotch. Later in life, as I have acquired a greater knowledge of craft beer and extreme beer styles, I have gained a greater appreciation for non traditional brews. As I'm nearing the end of this drink, I can tell that the potency of this brew is almost comparable to the feeling you get from drinking scotch. However, the malty sweetness in the aroma and the licorice  feel (a taste I have never enjoyed) is slightly disconcerting. As I said, I love me some good scotch but more for the bitter and spicy elements it brings. This scotch ale does not provide that for me. However, I will acknowledge that as someone who is still learning about the diverse and dynamic nature of beer, this one could become an acquired taste in the future."
""
"This is a very enjoyable beer.  Those of you who shy away from bourbon barrel aged beers should try this one.  Yes it is there and you can taste it but it does not dominate. Another great beer from Founders.  Very good!"

"Great big full bodied Barrel Aged Scotch Ale, huge Bourbon and Vanilla notes. Very well balanced, warms nicely and has just great flavor. Smooth all the way through, although at 10.2 some booze shines through and leaves a burn. Overall a great BA Brew that I will always seek out~"
""
"Overall- Bourbon barrel compliments the base beer beautifully, enhances and almost plays with the flavors in a wonderful way. Notes of bourbon are mild to subtle, but you also get a lot of oaky characteristics. Malt aromas and flavors are delictably sweet and satisfying. Rich and full of flavors, great to sip and savor."
""
"I loved the 2013 Backwoods Bastard.  The 2014 has even surpassed last years brew in quality.  Rich and decadent, with pronounced milk chocolate and caramel flavors balanced out with light oak from the bourbon barrels.  So smooth.  Incredible mouthfeel.  A bit boozy, but I fully expect that to balance out with a bit of bottle aging.  As good as scotch ale gets."

"Perhaps a top 5 beer of all time. Despite the warnings to only drink this at room temp, I found it to be delightful cold as well. The carbonation hits the tongue and immediately fades for a smooth mouthfeel. Then there's the bourbon; the delicious, perfectly accented bourbon. It's how bourbon and beer were supposed to taste together. Perfection."

"Overall, this is easily one of the best beers I have ever had and I can see why it is so sought-after. The vanilla, toffee, caramel, and oak just blend so perfectly with the bourbon to create such an excellent beer. I could deal with a little less bourbon in the taste (I now understand why people cellar this stuff), but that is really its only flaw. Now, excuse me why I go pick up more!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A potent brew; should've been called Backwoods Moonshine. So-so looks, while the aroma and flavour are an impressive blend of bourbon, wood, caramel malt and fruitiness. Seriously boozy - enjoyable but a tad harsh on the palate. Nice body; could be livelier. A good beer but I reckon the malt is overshadowed and the bourbon character could be dialled back a bit for balance. A good demonstration of why stouts endure bourbon-barrel aging better. Nonetheless, a worthy beer that deserves to be sampled."

"T: Tons of rich maltiness right off the bat with a lot of caramel, oak, molasses, vanilla and bourbon. The finish brings some heavy oak and some light cinnamon and charred wood. Mouthfeel is slick and gives the sweeter caramel flavors a bit of a buttery feel. This is pretty good stuff. Way up there on my list of scotch ales."

"Bringing this rating down slightly (from 4.75).  It remains an outstanding beer; however, the 2013 production was a bit smoother.  2014 is definitely boozier.  I actually preferred the ""half-baked"" version (Lil' Saplin') that was out in September."
"Pours out a burnt caramel with a thin ring of bubbles for a head. Barrel is overwhelming in the nose: oak, vanilla, char. Flavor is a good marriage of the base beer and the barrel aging. The bourbon notes tone down the overbearing esters of Dirty Bastard. Toasty caramel malts work very well with the oaky vanilla tones. Finishes sweet. Aftertaste has a lingering dried fruit bourbon thing going on. Mouthfeel is chewy, thick, and smooth. I'm usually not a big fan of bourbon barrel aging, but this is a solid example of when it goes right. I don't even care much for the base beer, so I'm surprised at how the barrel improved the original product, whereas normally I see it as detracting from the base product."

There are many flavors and aromas to enjoy, so practically any beer drinker will find something to their liking. Other beers contain these same flavors, but this beer presents them fully, completely, and in such good balance that it is worth seeking out above other barrel aged beers."

"Bottle date 10/5/12. Good amount of sediment in the pour. Appearance is dark reddish brown. Cold outta the fridge, nose is sweet & bourbony with some pungent notes. Sweetness is muted, mainly noticeable up front. On the sides, get some puckering bitterness. Toward the back, booze is noticeable, with a lingering sweetness in the finish. Half an hour later, and 25 degrees warmer, it's like a different beer. The sweetness dominates, with bitterness still there but taking a back seat. I know that most beers change character as they warm but this one takes it to an extreme. Barely enjoyable cold, it becomes a real treat as it approaches room temp."
""
"O: pretty good. I'm not a huge brown ale fan so my review is a bit skewed. It's very good for an aged brown. But my lower mark is due to my preference. The reason i dont love it is that the base flavor isn't really noteworthy. Pretty good, but not great. 3.5"

"The beer poured a deep brown with light hints of scarlett and a subtle off white head. The aroma was a caramel vanilla sweetness wrapped in a bourbon blanket. I wanted to dip my entire face in my glass, but I resisted the temptation. The bourbon was upfront but not overly dominant, just the right touch. It lended a smoky vanilla tone to the caramel malt sweetness of the beer that just glided along my palate. The Backwood Bastard had enough heft in the body and light carbonation to hold up to the heavy flavors in this enticing elixir. This was a truly phenomenal bourbon barrel aged brew and a real treat from Founders."

"O - Right up there with KBS. The barrel-aging process brings a new layer of depth Founders' heavy Scottish ale, which can be a tad on the sweet side. I find that at first this beer can have quite bite from the alcohol, but after 6 months to a year in the cellar it mellows out to be just about perfect."

"Overall I like this beer, its my first time having this from Founders and its well worth it, the oak and only slightly bitter make it a win for me. It has a 10.2% ABV so sip it slow but this one has a way of creeping up on ya, good job Founders."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not much of a wee heavy fan, and I didn't enjoy this beer the first time I had it. But after having it on tap and again in the bottle, it's really grown on me. Smell is fantastic, and taste and mouthfeel work together for a great drinking experience."

"Deep, muddy brown true to form. Headless. Bourbon and oak in spades on the nose. Vanilla notes breaking through the bourbon. Vanilla dominates the front of the tongue, warming feel on the mid, and nice slap of the bourbon on the back end. Smooth mouthfeel with long lingering presence of the barrel. This is excellent. Even better as it is a rare treat for me. Probably not an everyday drinker if I had the choice, but excellent for a special occasion."

"So, I would definitely grab this again, given the chance."

"Truly wonderful beer. Bourbon and caramel dominates the nose and taste. Little to no head or lacing. Light carbonation. Rich, buttery mouthfeel. So smooth and delicious. But this beer is all about the taste. Perfect blend of scotch ale and bourbon flavors. One of my very favorite beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely delicious! Had it for lunch and loved the smooth drinking caramel taste and smell. I'm not the most well rounded beer drinker but I will certainly be having this one again with a thick juicy burger. Complements a savory meal perfectly with its semi-heavy, sweet and very drinkable qualities. Brilliant work Founders!"

"Overall - Outstanding beer that you'll be sad when it's gone! Founder's did it again!"
""
""

"Overall- this was exceeded my expectations..so complex and tasty..I didn't want to stop drinking it. Definitely one of my favorites."
""
""
""
"Overall, while Scotch ales are not my favourite style, this is easily the best of the style I've had to date. Glad I picked up 4, hope I can get my hands on more eventually."

"Dark ruby color. Thin white head around the rim. Strong aroma of vanilla, caramel and bourbon predominate. Intense favors which all work together into a very complex taste that follows the nose. Quite a bit of heat fom the alcohol. The mouthfeel is one of my favorite parts of this beer, very creamy, rich and buttery. Overall a fantastic sipper, rich in complex flavors."
"As a lover of great single malt whisky and a good bourbon I naturally fall as a rock for this. It's heaven on earth..."
""
"Pours a dark amber with a reddish hue to one finger of creamy, khaki head that falls quickly to a thin collar and leaves minimal lace. The nose is dominated by the barrel, lots of vanilla, oak, bourbon and alcohol, but there is still a big malt character with big ripe fruit (prunes, raisins). The taste is very similar and starts off dominated by the grain bill highlighting swet rich malt and lots of luscious dried fruit (figs, prunes and raisins). The barrel warms the palate and delivers lots of warm bourbon, vanilla and a touch of oak as well as brown sugar and molasses. The body is full, creamy and rich with just enough carbonation to pull it all together. That is a really great beer!"
""
""
""
"big thick sweet , molasses, syrupy. little bit of hops. could use some sitting. thick and warming. overall, doesn't remind me too much of the dirty bastard, in my opinion much better balanced. just another example of founder's ability to make big , smooth beers"

""
""

"Overall: another great example of the quality brewer's setting up shop in my homestate. Founder's is world class. And although I wouldn't call this beer world class, its an example of the innovation and quality they're known for. Honestly, if they toned down the bourbon just every so slightly, I'd be singing it's praises even more than I already am."
"Overall, it would appear that I've given this beer a perfect score. I don't have a ton of reviews, but this is one of only two so far that has gotten such a rating from me. I dunno, for me, most beers fall behind in either mouth feel or appearance, but this one is quite simply perfect all around. I cut myself off once I'd purchased 16 bottles. I have 3 left, and I feel like I made a grave mistake buying as ""few"" as I did. This beer is an utter masterpiece."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As the beer warms there are additional notes of spice that were likely imparted from the barrel giving the beer additional depth and complexity. I'm very glad I had the chance to try this unique beer. For those who enjoy barrel aging this is one seeking, but don't expect any sort of wee heavy."
""

"O - I love Backwoods Bastard and its one of my highlights, beer wise, every late Fall. It's a simply stunning Bourbon Barrel giant and a true 'as good as it gets' type creation. The definition of perfection with a nice, big wee heavy and bourbon barrel brilliance!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A winter warmer for those cold, cold days."
"Overall - A very good BB aged scotch ale, but I've had better (St. Arnold Bishops's Barrel 5 trumps this one big time.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is a very warming beer and certainly a great sipper, much like scotch is. This is a very pleasant and well crafted beer. Do not let the styles name deter you from drinking this beer, even if you don't like scotch you will certainly enjoy this beer."
"Overall an amazing brew. So many interesting characteristics in the smell, taste, and mouthfeel. Happy to have been able to grab a growler fill of this."
"O: Unrealistically amazing. Founders has produced a world class BA scotch ale. Thank you Founders for this creation and much love for distributing to WI. Too bad I can not enjoy one of these daily"

""
"Happy Holidays, BA!"

"O - Backwoods Bastard may have a rough, grizzly exterior, but it's a gooey, soft-on-the-inside sipping dessert beer that's seeping with malty sweetness reminiscent of Milano cookies and home-made bourbon balls. It's moderate barrel-aging makes it great fresh but also allows it to age gracefully for a beer that develops for years to come."
""
"O-This beer hits the nail on the head across the board. Big but not overpowering. Its complex without being overdone. Sticks to the guns of a good classic scotch ale/weeheavy but brining a good modern twist with the oak barrel aging. Lets see this bad boy aged in an Islay scotch barrel with a heaping dose of smoke and salt water. sounds like heaven on earth to me."

"O - Love the smell of this and wish I liked it more than I did, but I'm not a regular drinker of heavy liquor. This is a very high quality beer and even though I'm not a bourbon-guy, it's obvious that this is done well! More personal taste than anything..."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Was just gonna go to bed but after walking the dogs off the lead only for the bitch to go walkabout on me an hour later after I return with the bitch in tow and after thinking the worst only to return achieved instead of finishing with a cool drink I'm drinking a beer for the moment name appropriate and after visiting the backwoods to find that bitch man it's appropriate and pours a dirty dark ass brown hue with a fast vanishing two finger head and and a rim of lacing along with sporadic clingers,the smell is strong bourbon along with feint oak and an undercoat of sticky toffee,the feel is medium bodied with above moderation and could use a little work but the tastes are a happy medium Oaked bourbon and sticky chewy caramel and finished with a dried fruit booziness but no boozy heat which is good and I'm always surprised at the ABV when drinking this and looking at it as it's hidden so well and overall the hype is right on the money for once this is definately something I could get used to being on our shores shelves as an option as it's tasty and nicely priced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - One of my favorites from these guys. I might say I enjoy it more than kbs. I get more bourbon out of it, and it ages better IMO (the bourbon stays intact)."

""
""
"Overall - A little too thin and bourbon forward, but still decent. Might rather just have a classic Dirty Bastard. The barrel doesn't seem to do much for this one, unlike KBS, which I think is excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a somewhat foamy (1/2) and smooth (1/2) mouthfeel that's a bit light and even slightly watery for the style. Ethanol easily felt in the nostrils as heat and as burning on the throat and tongue, Closes dryly, with heavy stickiness clinging to the lips and palate."

"O- This beer is better than my rating. Its appearance holds back the number here, but that's a mere technicality. As BBAs go, this one's done right."
"O: This was a good beer, especially for a BBA Wee Heavy that you can pick up off the shelf. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the best beers in that category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - This is a pretty cool Scotch ale. The barrel aging definitely shows but doesn't overpower the base, which is quite pleasant. A good sipper."
"O. I was impressed, you can't go wrong with founders"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is yet another home run from Founders. I love how they have stellar beers all over their lineup--some in the year-round, some in the seasonal, some in the specialty or limited releases--I could name several that I just love, and this one is no different. A really tasty take on a style that doesn't seem terribly widespread amongst American brewers."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolute homerun of a beer."
""
""
""
""

"O: As a said, I loved it. I want more, and I want it at my disposal at all hours. Sadly, I heard that it's a seasonal beer, and that breaks my heart. I guess i'll just have to stock up"
""
""
""
""
"I've rarely had a beer that I loved more than this! I love full-flavored ales and I've recently become a huge fan of oak whiskey barrel aging. Add that to Wee Heavy being my favorite variety of beer and this is second only to one other beer I've tried (St. Arnold's Bishop's Barrel #5 from Houston) and then not by much. Dark color. Beautiful, full aromas of cocoa. Taste and finish were delightful! The bourbon gives it an oaky, caramel-like taste to compliment the cocoa and adds just a slight burn that feels great going down. I can't give this beer enough stars! Unfortunately, like the St. Arnold's, it's a limited release, so I don't get to enjoy it over and over. I would love for a brewer to make a beer like this year-round!"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: well...after after a long search and pursuit I finally have this beer in my cellar. I think the chase was worth it. Bourbon barrel aging is either hit or miss for me, and in this case it is hit. It is well done and the bourbon really makes this beer drinkable and enjoyable. A well deserved reputation."

""

"O: several cuts above the Dirty Bastard and easily one of the top 5 bourbon barrel aged beers I've had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Probably the best bourbon-barrel aged beer that I've tried, and much better than it's base beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(4.5) D: This is delicious and alarmingly drinkable with the oak bourbon barrel qualities well balanced and very complimentary to the other flavours in this. Will certainly be picking up more of this."

""
""
""
""

"This is a well crafted barrel-aged beer that does not end up tasting harsh or cidery. The craftsmanship in the creation of this offering is evident."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice beer, well balanced in flavour and booze, the bourbon is a tad strong, but this is a hard thing to control, and does bring an otherwise nice characteristic to balance the toffee sweetness.... not extremely classic as with any aging, but is certainly up there for this style. The beer really comes alive with a bit of time in the glass breathing and warming up, which seems to smooth over the booze a bit. Won't be minding that I picked up a 4 of this one, this winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - admittedly I'm not a big fan of scotch, but I can appreciate it to a certain degree in beer. Unfortunately, it's way too overpowering in this brew. I prefer my beers to have their own flavours and not simply be barrel leaches. I'll give this another go in a few months probably, but will probably try to trade the other two away."

"Wow, I'm really having a hard time describing everything going on in this beer, other than, ""Awesome!"" I absolutely did not expect this beer to live up to the hype; I was absolutely wrong."
""
""
""
"O - 4.75 - This is a great beer. It's definitely unique, I'd love to put it next to the other wee heavy's because I think it would stand out. Glad I could score this guy at TW in WPB Florida."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Not much retention, but a good lace. Aroma is of Carmel malts, brown sugar, whiskey, and dark fruits. Body is thick with some carbonation. Taste is whiskey up front, with dark fruits and malts through out. Nice rich finish. Excellent brew, that warms you up quick!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good, but not entirely my kind of beer so I'm glad I only picked up one bottle. I expected some booziness, but there was none, even with aging in bourbon barrels. I can see why this is so highly rated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really quite good. I am not much of a scotch ale fan, and there are some elements of this beer that I don't love, but as a whole package, it is really good. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really exceptional beer. Front of the mouth, you get vanilla and coconut with a little bit of rye. Very soft mouthfeel, incredible aftertaste. A tad bit of bitterafter taste (50 IBUs) but really a lot going on for this one. I absolutely love this beer, and anyone who doesn't like this type has no place in drinking craft beers"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"No lie, I grew a full beard instantly while drinking this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a ruby red, slight purple, or dark brown depending on how the light hits it, an off white creamy head that's about half a finger that dies dow quickly. Slight to almost no carbonation and the smell is of caramel, oak, toasted almonds, vanilla and warm bread(where are those 50 IBUs?). Taste is caramel and oak up front followed light berries and a vanilla sugar finish and finally that delayed hop coating. The mouthful is huge, slightly lighter than a stout, on par with a barley wine. The alcohol to me is very minimal in this one especially for the 10% ABV, the only time present to me was in delayed drinks when I could feel my tongue soaking it in. Well balanced, great example of the style."
""
"Overall - Fairly complex, delicious, rich, malty, sweet with flavors mixing well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE 12/28/13: Had another and was struck by how much this tastes like a heavier-bodied Innis & Gunn Scottish Porter, which I just had a few nights ago, and which is also aged in liquor barrels. I must admit, much as I love I&G, I liked this better because of the more substantial body and slightly better malt/whiskey flavor balance. I like a hefty mouthfeel, and Backwoods Bastard is hard to beat! Of course it also tops the ABV of Innis & Gunn by about 3%."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good and very indulgent beer. I definitely think it's worth the cost per four pack. However, I don't think it's worth aging because the bourbon notes tend to get lost over time."
"Had this one stashed in the fridge from last year. I poured it and it has a black color body with just a small head. The aroma is very strong bourbon. The taste has a strong bourbon presence with a nice maltyness to it. The mouthfeel is very smooth and the bourbon lingers on the tongue. Overall this is a damm good beer and i wish i had some to age."
""
""
""
""
""
"Was very disappointed with this after looking at the reviews. I hope it was a bad bottle and the other three are better. The watered down whiskey and coke flavor is lingering."

"Decided to get grab a 4 pack of this. The temperatures have dipped down into the teens here in Chicago so I thought it would work well for the season. I typically don't go for this style but I was intrigued after having a nice bourbon aged ale last weekend during the holiday. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of balance in the beer and the lovely hidden alcohol. It definitely blooms while it warms and everything about the beer becomes a bit more pronounced, the smell the taste and the mouthfeel specifically. A nice creamy mouthfeel with notes of brown sugar, molasses, raisin, vanilla and finally a kick of the bourbon on the tail end that is not overly aggressive like some of the bourbon barrel aged ales out there. I'm gonna hang on to two of these and see how they age, thats if I can hold off from drinking them."
"O: Very impressed with this brew. The barrel aging does wonders for the beer as I don't really care for Dirty Bastard, but this is great! Can't wait to see how my other three bottles change over the course of the next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I had a complaint about this beer, it would be that it should be slightly more carbonated. Let the aroma fill the room."
"Pours an almost opaque black with a thin chocolate head. A steady ring of lace lines the outside of the glass and leaves its sticky presence with each sip. Strong bourbon, vanilla, oak, and slight hints of chocolate highlight the aromas. The taste is right in line with the smell. My palate is met with a mild, upfront bourbon flavor, then catches a hint of vanilla and oak in the middle that finishes with a nice boozy burn. Light carbonation with a warm mouthful from the bourbon makes this a very well-balanced beer. A great, complex, barrel-aged offering from Founder's. The accessibility, cost, and overall complexity make this one of my favorites from Founder's. This ranks up there with KBS minus all of the hype!"

"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Very dark brown color, small head with moderate lacing. The smell is pure bourbon - I'm getting a lot of oak and vanilla. I can also detect some of the booziness in the nose. The taste follows the smell, with the bourbon notes shining through at the beginning, but the scotch ale comes through after the bourbon fades. I think the two sets of flavors are really well-balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth and lightly creamy. For the ABV, this is pretty drinkable. Overall I think this is a really great barrel-aged offering from Founders."

"Pours a dark brown with red tints that has a very nice head and lingering lacing. Nose is of bourbon against a molasses, dark malt and chocolate background. Carbonation is average and the mouthfeel is a light medium. I was expecting a full medium body, but the lightness helps bring the bourbon flavor forward. The 10.2% alcohol is well hidden in this very well balanced beer. Bourbon against the molasses and dark malt backbone is the taste profile. Finishes with bourbon and malt sweetness with a touch of oak and a nice alcohol burn that lingers along with the oak. Another outstanding Founder’s offering that takes Old Ale brewing to a new level."

"O- Overshadowed by other barrel aged beers from Founders. I find BWB easily available and this year...incredibly inexpensive at $12 a four pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malt heads dream. Bourbon is spot on and drinkable now- no need to tame this one down. Very difficult to get around here but yet thru tenuous searching, was able to score a few 4 pks. Definitely worth the hunt down and reminds me every year that Thanksgiving is around the corner. Very similar to my liking of Central Waters barrel aging. Fantastic BA scotch ale!"

"Overall: Way better than I remember. Love this beer. The thing I love about this beer is that the bourbon is blended well and isn't boozy or overpowering the other flavors. They just mix together perfectly. Amazing beer and my favorite scotch ale now. Had to go back and get a 4 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An absolute surprise, possibly the best bourbon barrel aged beer I've had. A bit rough at times but I can see this beer approaching perfection with some age"
""
""
"O - Fantastic flavor, still quite boozy but much better balanced from fresh 2012 BWB. The sweetness is absolutely fantastic and holds up to the booze reasonably well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just too much bourbon for me. I prefer a lighter bourbon touch to my beer. As the prolonged aging in the barrel adds to the vanilla sweetness so prevalent in oak. Plus, Dirty Bastard is already malty and sticky sweet"
""
""
""
"The feel is so mellow, smooth and it has a silky thickness. It holds almost no carbonation and the high ABV is lost but a slight spike at the rear of the throat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a heavy hitter on the ABV that surprisingly mellows as it warms with nice bourbon and oak notes that are agressive but not too much and just the right amount of sweetness without a thick stickiness. Would think about one year in the basement would smooth it out a bit"
""
"Really good bourbon barrel style old ale that I will buy more of in the future. Thanks Founders!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Fantastic example of the style. I really enjoy the dirty bastard so this is jut that one step better after being in the barrels. Everything about it just sits right with me from the color to the finish. If you are a fan of Wee Heavys this is a must.."

""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is simply amazing. The color is a dark brown with some reddish hues. I poured it into a pint glass it has a very nice 3/8 inch head which brought out the smell. The smell is of sweet bourbon with an Oakey hint. Tastes was very similar to the smell with a bark roasted bourbon flavor. The mothfeel was very smooth even with the higher abv. Overall this beer is great."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would love to compare this to a non-barred aged version but as it is it's quite pleasant"
"Deep chestnut brown color. You can see some sediment floating within the body of the beer. The head is minimal. The aroma is heavy with bourbon and perhaps a bit of fig and oak. The mouthfeel is thick,sticky and with a lingering warmth in the aftertaste. This beer is all malt but that malt is buried within the bourbon. Much more depth emerges in the flavor as it warms."

"A wonderful barrel aged beer at a reasonable price point. Greatest thing ever? One of them."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lovely translucent coppery color with a thin eggshell head. Very bourbon forward smell, hits you hard. As one that generally doesn't like bourbon it was a bit off-putting, but not enough to want to put it down. The taste.. Amazing? Bourbon is definitely there, but not even half as strong as it is in the nose. Bit of a twang, but in a good way. Hints of a bitter vanilla/burnt caramel. Silky mouthfeel, warms nicely as it fills and goes down. Overall a great balance and really quite lovely. ..and this is coming from one that thought they didn't even like Scotch Ales. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had this one in the past, and not only did this beer get me into barrel aged beers, but it also got me into bourbon. The barrel aging makes a huge impression on this one, and it's not for those that steer clear of that type of thing. For those that like that though, this is one of the best BA beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great beer and one of the most cost effective bourbon barrel aged beers I've encountered. Scotch ales are my favorite style and Dirty Bastard is one of the best examples of the style. This just amplifies all that beer's greatness by adding the oak and vanilla from the barrel."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love scotch ales. A lot. As has already been said, the style really does lend itself to this type of aging. Strong, but not an all-timer by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Update: drank a bottle bottled on 9/23/11, so more than 2yrs old. Bit more watery. Still create flavors, but the mouthfeel is falling off."
"Pretty good over all. Wish I had more."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy ruby brown with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing. Big bourbon notes on the nose with hints of oak and vanilla. Bourbon hits the palate right up front with a nice, sweet oaky finish. Light bodied with faint carbonation. Overall, a bourbon lovers delight. Well balanced and well crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O excellent beer. Was really looking forward to this one. As previously stated its perfect for the cold weather. Reminds me a bit of Bois with much higher drinkability and without the crazy alcohol presence. This has nice big flavors but tastes very controlled and balanced like most founders offerings. I could drink this everyday."

"Overall- Unique. This blows away any wee heavy that I' ve had."

""
""
""
""
""
"O- very enjoyable. This would be perfect on a cold winter night."
""
"Pours a  clear dark ruby,  thin light brown colored head,  spotty lace down the glass.  Smell:  caramelized sugar;  mildly earthy, leafy and boozy.  Bourbon, yes,  not a lot from the oak.  Taste:  caramelized pear,  dates,  earthy,  with notes of bourbon, vanilla, and baking spices.  Sugary,  candied fruit finish."

"We weren't going to buy this after trying a 2012 at a local pub which left a tinny ""ok"" taste- but who knows how it spent it's last year ie storage, temperature, etc. I'm glad we gave 2013 a try because it's really a treat in a glass! Curmudgeon meets Dirty Bastard plus steroids. Poured into a snifter glass it has a really really dark amber color with very little froth line around the top. The smell is boozy but delicious. It's a beautiful blend of malty vanilla with a soft bourbon base. I don't make a lot of room on my top shelf which is crowded with stouts, but this one is near Anderson Valley's Bourbon Aged Stout, Parabola, and KBS."
"Overall, a very well made beer. Impressive. Alcohol forward and in your face. Delicious."
"A truly exceptional scotch ale/wee heavy. Founder brought the big guns here."
""
""
""
""
"O- DB was one of my favorites to this point, and BB has solidified itself as my favorite brew to this point in time. Would seek this out year after year. Thanks Founders!!!"
""
"Definitely one of the top three beers I have had the pleasure of drinking. I am not a liquor drinker, however I can most certainly taste and feel the bourbon from the pour to my belly. Amazing balance of hops, malts and other flavors (of which I am unfortunately not qualified to differentiate). Suffice it to say that I am very excited about this beer and wishing that I have purchased more than three four packs!"

"Founders just rolled into Florida last month and I've been blown away by one beer after another from them. Breakfast Stout, Red's Rye, and their porter have all been great, but this is my favorite Founders brew out of the ones that I've tried, and it's not close. It's just a phenomenal, massive beer with a ridiculous flavor profile and great balance. One of the best beers I have ever had."

""
""
""

""

"overall - top tier BA beer. I'm a big fan of Scotch ales and this delivered! Compared to BA barleywines or stouts, this seems a lot more balanced ""fresh"" from the bottling date, honestly I'm not sure if aging this would help much, but since I got a 4 pack, it's worth saving 1 for 6 months and 1 for a year I'm thinking."
""
"O: Not having been able to get my hands on KBS, this is by far my favorite Founders beer. Granted, I lucked out in that I only had to pay $12 for a 4-pack but hey, I'd pay $15 or whatever it should be selling for. It's not something I could or would want to drink every night, but it hit the spot on a chilly Vermont November evening."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
""

"Overall - A little disappointed with the mouthfeel, but the scent is fantastic. For such a full bodied beer it's a shame that it comes across as a little watery. The taste is solid and the alcohol is well hidden. Good stuff and I'm looking forward to trying the 2013 bottles."

"If you can get past the overwhelming booziness of this beer, you will likely be blown away by the amazingly rich, robust and complex flavor profile. I cellared my bottle for a year and thought that it was far smoother than how I remembered the glass that I had on-tap. All in all, Backwoods Bastard is a fantastic example of what barrel aging can do to a fairly ordinary base beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber-brown with a tiny head and a little lacing. Smell is bourbon, carmel, molasses, butterscotch and vanilla. Taste is bourbon up front with the flavors of the nose in the background. Mouthfeel is a little light with a low amount of carbonation. Overall it is a great scotch ale, definitely worth seeking out."

"Pours a very, very dark brown like coca cola with a small head that goes away very fast. There's a wonderful bourbon aroma emanating from the glass, along with molasses - it kind of smells like shoofly pie. There's some maltiness to back it up, but mostly bourbon. It's quite sweet on the toungue with more delicious bourbon and also a dryer oakyness that comes along afterward. Nice creamy texture and just a slight bitterness. This is one of my favorite offerings from Founders and it seems to mellow out slightly while holding up very well after almost a year in the cellar."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Loved this beer fresh, but now that it is pushing a year old, I think I like it more! The bourbon barrel is there, but its a more blended and subdued flavor.  The heat is completely gone and notes of vanilla and caramel are brought to the forefront."

""
""

"Overall: Founders has been making great beer for over 20 years. Backwards Bastard is an amazingly subtle yet complex beer. You will find the flavor change with each sip as the beer warms and the taste lingers. You can drink this with almost any rich food and meal course; from roasted garlic Portobello mushrooms, to a medium-rare rib eye, or a flourless chocolate raspberry cake. But why wait for the food. As my favorite late night talk show host would exclaim, “This is a beverage”."
""
""
""
"Overall.... I cannot judge this on the current or year of backwoods bastard because I had one that was 2 old. I would say the one I had was absolutely phenomenal and if your into Scotch ale's/wee heavys than definitely seek out an aged one, specifically founders, and you will love it as well...I am gonna buy a 4 pack and age them as well... see how they turn out in a few years."

"Overall: Excellent. This beer has taken the last 6 months well. Smooth, sweet and brings bourbon heat still. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and will be picking up a lot of the 2013 vintage and aging some more of it. It's almost up there with Cigar City's BA Big Sound- it's not as complex but its certainly mellow despite packing a good bourbon bite. (4)"

"Deep ruby red wityh a bit of brown, ring of eggshell head with little lace. Smell is a nice mix of bourbon, oak and caramel, vanilla with over ripe fruit and toffee, really well intergrated nose. Taste is malty with lots of oak and vanilla flavours, bourbon, caramel and toffee, mildly sweet, oaky finish, bourbon and fruit aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, medium full body. Great stuff here, really drinkable despie high ABV, something I will be searching out again."

"O: I've found that while I'm not the biggest fan of Scotch Ales, I really like barrel-aged versions - mainly because the dry, oakiness of the barrel cuts the malt sweetness. For the huge abv, this is a great bourbon barrel Scotch Ale - the bourbon aroma and flavor is there, but not so huge as to completely take over. Its a great sipper, and the nuances of the barrel, along with the base beer make it enjoyable, especially as you give it time to warm."

It has and great color and smell and was served in a sniffer glass. It is a sipping beer that will warm you right up. If you think of a scotch ale aged in a bourbon barrel you will have an idea about what this beer tastes like. If you enjoy their Dirty Bastard and you are a fan of whiskey this is a great beer."

"Big thanks to Hopshopenstein for sending this my way. Dark, dark red color with a minimal head. The aroma on this was just great, vanilla, bourbon, sugar, wood. Great! The flavor was not nearly as good, sort of muddled. It had hints of the vanilla and bourbon but i really couldn't get a feel for the base beer beneath. If the flavor matched the aroma this would be top notch."

"O – This is a delicious beer. It has all the key elements of a good Scotch ale with the added bonus of bourbon barrels. Furthermore, it is extremely drinkable, especially for the 10.2% ABV. The warming sensation from the alcohol is strong but really quite pleasant. This may be one of my favorite beers from Founders and may certainly be my favorite Scotch ale. I might also add that this is by FAR my favorite bourbon barrel-aged beer that I’ve had so far. I highly recommend this beer."
"This is a pretty perfect sipper. If you don't like a boozier beer then you can avoid this one, but this is a very balanced, delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- first off, I'm not a big fan of dirty bastard but this bourbon aged version is everything I want in a sipping beer. The flavor just keeps evolving as you drink it. Give this beer to a whisk(e)y drinker and watch their eyes open up and explode. Strong bourbon profile. Get a pack if you can, get two if you have the money.4.75"

"This is the best Bourbon Aged I have ever had. It was aged about 18 months to perfection. I'm in Texas and understand the Founders has been picked up here by a distributor. Can't wait to get my hands on more of this amazing beer. If anyone can recommend anything like this or better I want it."

"Big, tasty beer. The barrel flavor is a simple, though, imho. It smells great. Big vanilla, oak, brown sugar, molasses and a lot of caramel. It’s a bit on the sweet side. Taste is similar but the barrel flavor gets a tad harsh and isn’t quite as enjoyable. There's just an almost astringent harshness to the beer. Still, lots of vanilla, dark sugars and oak. Perhaps, a different batch or temperature would soften my opinion, here. Mouthfeel is smooth and while it’s fairly thick, it could be even thicker. Deep amber brown in color with a sudsy beige head. Interesting beer. I just wish that the barrel was a bit gentler on the palate."
"O - This has quickly become one of my favorite beers. Just bourbon drenched toffee perfection. Absolutely world class stuff."

"Flavor is fantastic. Sweet caramel malts, lots of chocolate, booze, scotch, and hints of vanilla and charred barrel. Really smooth...I mean such an easy drinker. What an awesome and amazing example of the style. Worth the wait for it every year. Everyone should have this beer."

"Overall (4.0): It has some flaws, in my mind, but nothing crucial—I’m just not the biggest fan of most bourbon barrel-aged beers. And while this beer does very well with the barrels, I just don’t necessarily like what bourbon barrels bring to a lot of the beers aged in them. This however does a good job. Also, it’s much, much better overall after it warms up more than a bit, and it becomes a very pleasant sipper."
""
"O - A really good beer, but what's new whenh it comes to Founders? I think they might have something there."
""
""
""
""
"Pours deep amber brown with small, orange brown head. Smells of straight whiskey, vanilla, smoke, brown sugar, candy sweet malt, butterscotch, and a hint of dark fruit. Very sweet but with some bite and smokiness to balance it out. Alcohol warmth and bourbon for sure, with a huge burst of vanilla. Slick and heavy on the palate. Very nice overall but doesn't live up to other BA scotch ales I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Huge bourbon flavor, but doesn't mask the other flavors from the base."
"An exceptional beer that is brilliantly balanced. Sweet caramel, shortbread, brown sugar and dark fruits are balanced by booze, bourbon and wood. I wish the mouthfeel was a bit creamier but I could not ask for anything more. A beer that is so much fun to drink, especially at 10.2% abv, wish I had more."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the first time I had this one I really thought it was great but every time i have it, it loses a bit every time I have it. It really is an improvement on dirty bastard but it is still not great in my opinion."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Evan! Beautiful mahogany pour with a hint of ruby when held to the light. One and a half finger head with decent retention and great lacing. Big buttery, woody nose with hints of butterscotch, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The taste is extremely unique and unlike any other beer I've had. Tons of oak, butterscotch and creamy caramel along with hints of bourbon, toffee, tobacco, and just a touch of dark fruit. The mouthfeel is the only perfect 5 I've ever given. It's totally incredible! Smooth and creamy with a touch of oil and a spicy, warming finish. This was an extra in my trade so I have to thank Evan as I may have never tried it if it wasn't for him! Another mind-blowing beer from my favorite brewery!"

"O: A very special treat. An obvious upgrade to an already awesome beer. Founders is known to be talented with barrels at their disposal and this only enhances that reputation. Extremely well-crafted with the bourbon character incorporated/infused perfectly. An absolute pleasure to drink. Unbelievable. Damn!"
"Very nice beer from Founders. The craftsmanship is impressive. Well done."
""
""
"O: Absolutely worth the price tag. Hard to track down, but definitely worth the hunt. Probably my favorite Founders brew to date. Wee Heavy is one of my favorite styles, and this one is at the top of the style for me. It's amazing how the vanilla and caramel notes balance the bourbon and oak. VERY GOOD."

"Backwoods Bastard is like Founder’s Dirty Bastard’s big brother that has spent time soaking in bourbon barrels. Cheers to soaking in bourbon barrels!! Well done Founders."

"A malt lover's dream."
"Founders has perfected bourbon barrel aging and with this beer they proved it once again. Now, what is different here is that it's truly unique to have a non stout/dark beer pull off such a smooth tasty flavor with such a high ABV. Once you crack the bottle the smell of malt and bourbon overwhelm and you know you're in for a very different experience. The taste of the base Dirty Bastard is present and it meshes extremely well with the sweet malt and bourbon to create a top notch smooth scotch ale. Overall, it's a must have and one of the best beers Founders has created."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fabulous sipper. One to celebrate with. Slow down and taste the burn."
""
"Overall, another excellent brew from founders, very enjoyable, especially for colder weather."
"Overall: This is what I would call a bourbon lover's beer. It's excellent - another fine example of Founders' skill with barrels."
"O- it took me a while to get ahold of some of these and I wasn't dissapointed. The caramel notes in this were amazing, I can't wait to put a few of these away for a few years and see how they age."
"O- this is really smooth for the abv. It's quite sweet and I get the bourbon mostly in the finish. I'm not a huge scotch ale fan, but I love bourbon, and this did not disappoint. I pulled it out of the fridge but as it warmed it got even better. Definitely worth picking up a bottle (even though many stores limit it to buying one oz bottle near me)."
""

"Poured into large tulip. Small, non lasting head that ended as a ring around the surface. The color is beautiful...very deep red, bright and clear. Aroma is of oak tones, earthiness, and wonderful bourbon. The flavor is amazing. No bitterness, a little underlying sweetness, great woody flavors, strong bourbon but not overpowering, maybe a hint of good scotch too. Clean on the palate with a lingering bit of alcohol and bourbon sweetness. Great stuff. This here is sippin' beer...really enjoyable and even better as it warmed. Unfortunately only found one lonely bottle...bummer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Great Beer, but I am not sure I would buy it again."
""
"Very easy to drink and extremely enjoyable young, but I'm going to age a few bottles as well to see how it is in a year or more."
""
""
""
"Copper mahogany colored with a wispy beige head that barely rises up and runs away quickly. Aroma of smoke and bourbon, some vanilla and caramel. Rich flavors of bourbon and smoke, toffee and caramel, alcohol warmth and sweetness, vanilla and woody notes. Full mouthfeel, low carbonation, tingly, warm. Decent beer overall, very rich."
""
""
""
" Highly Recommended ! CHEERS!!"
""
"O - I like some scotch ales, but usually don't seek them out. This is a standout. The aging in the bourbon barrels makes this beer sing. Perfection...no fake bourbon flavor here like a ton of bourbon ales out there. An A+ in my opinion. Seek it out, sit back and enjoy!"
""
""
"Having had two bottles over a couple weeks, I'm comfortable in my review. Solid, but definitely barrel driven."
"O - I gotta say, I was not expecting what I received in taste based on what I noted on the nose; how does a sweet, sugary odor have so much alcohol punch; this is a rare beer that drinks hotter than it lists as an abv; kind of a perfect sipping beer for a day where I had no heat with temps in the teens and 4 inches of snow. Backwoods as f***."
""
"Overall, if you like bourbon you will absolutely love this beer. The flavors mesh perfectly and the mouthfeel is just right; full but not too sweet. A really amazing beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I liked the first 2/3 a lot. By the last third, it was getting a little old for me. Kind of a one trick pony in my book, but a helluva trick. Wouldn't want more than one at once, but would like to have it around to have one once a week or so."
""
""
"Overall: This is a great barrel aged brew from Founders and I know why this is highly sought after. I'm glad my local store still has cases upon cases of this because that means that they're basically aging it for me. The boozy taste has mellowed out over the last few months and I cannot imagine aging this more than a few months regardless of what it says. Either way this is delicious and I will definitely keep buying when I run out of what I have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall a very good beer. Definitely an offbeat beer I wouldn't drink everyday, but it's fun and different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good beer but see my taste comment. Needs to keep the basics of a scotch ale in my opinion. Still the oak makes it so smooth it is insanly drinkable."
"O - This is one big sipper that demands your attention and is not for the faint of hearted. It definitely comes with extreme flavor and a hell of a kick. Simply amazing. I tried one when it was fresh and this slightly aged one has more pronounced bourbon notes. A must try for bourbon barrel aged beer lover. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A true sipper and a nice selection on a chilly December evening like tonight. I'm glad the weekend is here."
"O - Overall a wonderful take on an already great scotch ale. The bourbon tones take over and deliver wave after wave of enjoyable flavors. This is a real winner."
"The taste has some punch with sweet maltiness and vanilla which quickly evolves into a biting, long lingering bitterness that coats my throat. This is an excellent take on the Wee Heavy style."
""
""
""
"Overall. Fantastic stuff. Really mellow, probably at least pratially from the age on it."
""
""
"Overall: I know this is supposed to be a strong beer, but its strength is a little bit raw; as I said I'd prefer it a bit smoother. Still, quite a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very enjoyable beer and one of the best in the style that I have come across - though I might be a little biased as I really like bourbon barrel aged beers. Definitely one I will be getting again (and this is not even one of my favorite styles)."

"Overall: Again, this was never one of my favorite beers, but you have to respect how drinkable and smooth it is, even if you're not in love with the taste(like me). I'd say this is an excellent candidate for aging, and can turn into a classic after some. My guess is, the astringent factors of this beer will surely fade after a year and improve it significantly, giving it a more malty, balanced taste...just might have to buy a few extra. There are so many beers of this ilk that are practically undrinkable compared to this(especially young), which is why Founders is who they are, and does what they duz."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Love it! Not much more to say. Drinks extremely well at a great price point. I will gladly grab this anytime it is available."
"Pours a dark reddish brown, almost cola-like. Tight bubbled khaki/butter colored head that about 1/4 inch head that rests thinly around the top of the glass, and sticks and slimes with some very visible alcohol legs. Bourbon right off the bat, big vanilla, buttery malts follow up, big brown sugar and caramel on the finish. Buttery malts fill the tongue, then caramel and raisins follow, sharp carbonation hits around mid sip and opens up the taste buds to a vanilla bourbon blast, that resinates to a cheerywood and alcohol finish. Full bodied, medium carbonation, strong, boozey, and very sweet. Overall; just an all around great beer, intense complexity, creative flavors, malty, sugary, desert like sweetness, it is crazy how good this beer is."
""
"Backwoods Bastard pours a hazy brownish reddish color, similar to that of dieherra with no head. Strong oak aroma, with hints of bourbon, spicy malty aroma. There is a strong whiskey like flavor, on a mellow smokey malty backbone, with a sharpness on the palette. Good full flavor, well balanced and complex. Overall a fantastic scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an awesome beer from an awesome brewery, and made even better by its reasonable price. I'm aging a bottle in my cellar, and can't wait to see how it ages."

"Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip, bottled 10/12/12. Poured slowly down the center and got a beautiful light tan head that leaves, a thick ring of lace. The beer itself is a bright ruby. The smell on this starts with strong vanilla, bourbon, peat, dark fruit, and some biscuit. Taste is similar to smell not as much vanilla as the nose would have you expect, but really complex, pick up different flavors each sip, and really makes you crave the next one. Maybe a little smoke, but very subtle and blends well with all the other flavors from the nose. Body is medium large, perfect amount of carbonation for the style, not really dry almost surprising, and very drinkable for a big brew. Founders and Firestone are so good at brewing barrel aged beers it is scary. Love this and had a Dirty Bastard before to see what a difference the barrels made and it turned a very good beer into an amazing beer."
""
""
"O: An interesting, well-done beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm stunned. I knew this beer was going to be good, but I honestly didn't expect it to be this good. I gave it pretty high marks because I'm really not a fan of Scotch Ales usually, but for me this is so perfect. Backwoods Bastard is now absolutely my favorite Founders beer, don't get me wrong, KBS and Breakfast Stout are up there as well, but I think this takes it to another level. Well done Founders, and thank you Nick for sending this my way. I can't wait to see what happens to my other bottle with some age on it."
"Final Thoughts: Completely worth the money and unique. I'm starting to like barrel aged beers more and more because of tasting something like Backwoods Bastard which is brewed and aged to near perfection. Would I drink it again? This year if I can find it!(Would love to cellar a few of these bad boys). Otherwise I'll be on the lookout for next years release."
"super different for a beer in this genre. it pours a slightly cloudy pale amber color, with a dense nearly pure white head, lots of lacing left behind as it sips down. the nose is a little fruity, a lot boozy, and entirely different again from most scotch ales. its too light. the taste is awesome, like a tasty hybrid of licorice and fresca soda, thats what i taste. more fruit than ever for a scotch, and the same effervescent carbonation as that artificial grapefruit flavored soda pop. its really good, but i am missing that smoke and hefty malt base ive grown used to in these beers. anyone else get that? bright bubbling medium body, again too light for the style, but this is a damn good beer. living up to its name for all the wrong reasons, this is something unique and to be cherished. i never in a million years would have put uts abv over 10% on a blind tasting, its far too delicate to be that potent, but it all seems to work out just right. on tap at j. ryans in syracuse, a place you must visit as a beer enthusiast. what a treat from founders!"
"Pours a cloudy dark ruby-amber with a quickly attenuating scorched carmael-colored head. Lovely vanilla on the nose accompanied by tempered bourbon. Moutfheel is a little thin, but smooth as silk. A bit of a burn on the finish from a combination of carbonation, hop, and alcohol. The flavor is amazing. It would be perfect, but there's just some alcohol bitterness that detracts from the heavenliness. Toffee, vanilla, bread, and bourbon, all in spades. It's reminiscent of my favorite beer on planet Earth--Double DBA from FW, but a scaled down version."

"This beer, transcends style bullshit and proves light barrel notes rule. At least when done by Founders. Highest recommendation."

"O: I liked this beer a lot considering the sweetness, it was well balanced and very delicious. Glad I got to try it finally."

"O - great beer, bought a second bottle to cellar"
""
""
""
"O- A truly fantastic example of what barrel aging can do to a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is way too hot and needs to be laid down for at least 4 months. Its a mess to tell you the truth. This may be very nice when the bourbon cools off a bit. And I truly hope I was not tasting sucralose."
""
""
"O: I'm really glad I cracked this tonight. Looking for a beer to slowly sip and enjoy, I'm looking forward to seeing how this one warms up. Also happy I have three more bottles to sit on. I'll likely drink two soon since I'm liking where it is right now, but will be interested to see how it ages."
""
""
""
"O-An excellent beer one that I will get on an annual basis. Not usually a fan of the scotch ales, but the bourbon/oak in this one balances out the sweetness perfectly."
""
""
""
"D/O Drinkability not that high since it is such a big beer and overall this is a really great version of the style. There are many in this style that are big, huge beers. The bourbon here helps to make it more accessible and easier drinking. In short, it really helps the style for me. 4.0"
""
"O - This is a good beer that not many others mimic. The craftsmanship is noted and I look forward to grabbing a 4-pack each year."
"Wow, incredibly smooth. Like sucking down a rum raisin butterscotch sunday with toffee bits. Creamy rich vanilla oakiness throughout, caramel toffee and smoke, faint dark fruit. So smooth and so big on flavor but it seems so subtle at the same time. Alcohol heat is barely there. Simply put this is an amazing brew with incredible smoothness and a faint lingering sweetness. Balance is almost impeccable."
"This is a decent beer. It's a bit simple, but it's good. The bourbon is a bit heavy and the underlying scotch ale at times seems to struggle with it. On the whole, this is a very nice beer that is worth trying."
""
""
"Overall: Just amazing BA scotch ale. Leaves me pretty warm in the throat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I was very impressed with this brew. The complexity is stunning, the flavor is amazing, and the balance is like no other. It's definitely a sipper than demands sip after sip. If you can get your hands on this one, do it."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I do not think the brewers at Founders or anyone else could do a better job of making a true scotch ale with as much complexity and character as this. It is a true pleasure to drink. The only things I will say against it are 1) It only comes out 1X/year and in limited distribultion and with the high alcohol content, if you drink more than one you really feel it. However I will gladly put up with the buzz and slowly sip it."

"Would I buy it again? Yes."

""
""

""
""
""
""
"Worth the hype, but I really wish this was easier to get in bottles."
""

"Medium full body with mild carbonation, more than I thought a high abv beer would have but doesn't take away from the experience. Alcohol is well hidden, but a bit of warmth after swallowing."

"A nice brown pour with a small head. Minimal lacing on my class. Aroma of bourbon shines through, making me a bit nervous actually. Add a little vanilla to the smell and now I'm ready to drink it. Not as much whiskey in the flavor, still very present, but not overpowering. Lots of flavors in this. The more I let it sit it started tasting like almond joy candy bars. Really nice brew"
"Overall: Pretty solid beer. You can't go wrong with anything barrel aged, especially bourbon. This beer rocks."
""
"O: An amusing novelty."
"O: Founders doesn't disappoint when it comes to barrel aged beers. This is delicious and very complex, seems to get more complex the warmer it gets."
""
""
""
"Overall I was excited to finally see this beer in my area and to try it. The bourbon is sort of overpowering, feels like I am having whiskey not beer. Maybe some age or warming would help improve things."
""
"O: I'm not sure what to do with this brew, quite honestly. I love my beers aggressive, but this one just didn't cut it for me. There just wasn't much beyond the bourbon bite. Not much flavor overall, just ""hints"" of various other flavors. Perhaps some aging would do wonders for this beer, but I'm not so sure I'm willing to give it another shot quite yet. Above average brew, but nothing more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Personally : 3.75, mainly due to alcohol and easy drinkability. Onthe lower side due to taste that puts me off. I won't buy it next time."
""
""
"O: I’m a sucker for beers that get more flavor out of the barrels they use than the bourbon the barrels held. This is an excellent example...and an interesting experiment with a scotch ale. Grateful to now be able to get it in my market."

"Overall- As someone who isnt even a huge fan of barrel aged beers, I found this one to be superb. Great complexity, smooth whiskey taste that isn't overpowering. Very very good"

"A warming smooth sipper."

"O- This is a damn delicious, wonderful beer. It's very rich and the flavors are interesting enough to sip at all evening. Along with the Breakfast Stouts this is easily one of Founders' best beers."

""
"O - A very good take on a style I don't drink very often. There is a lot going on in the aroma with fruits, vanilla, and the forward bourbon contributions. The flavor is good, but doesn't live up to the aroma in my opinion. It improves considerably in flavor and mouthfeel as it warms. I am happy to have gotten a four pack so I can put a few down and try them with some age. Overall, a very good beer that I wish came to my area."

"D: pretty enjoyable brew. really nice to see a big, bourbon barrel aged brew this easy to drink after only being in the bottle for about 6 weeks. my only complaint is regarding the carb which i think detracts from the body a bit. something that i think if it were backed off a bit, would make this even more of a savory treat."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the pop from the bourbon right off the bat with the first sip. Throughout the sip the flavoring stays very smooth, and relatively uniform. This is both good and bad. On the one hand, you get this great, rich, buttery, sweet bourbon flavoring for the entire sip. On the other hand, however, there are really no surprises. You’re waiting for something insane to kick in, but they kind of pull all their stops at the instant the beer touches your mouth. Really, this isn’t a complaint, as we found this beer to be delicious, and another homerun for Founders. The insane bourbon nose and flavoring makes this guy a contender amongst barreled beers, despite the style."

"O - A very delicious beer, one that is sweet (but not overly so) and not to be taken lightly. This, even at its high price, will be a repeat purchase."
"J"

"O- Overall a really good Scotch Ale with the bourbon twist, out does Dirty Bastard with the barrel aging, and honestly one of the first bourbon barrel beers i've liked, dont care for bourbon, but this isn't overpowering"
"All in all I wish my bottle shop would have more than a one bottle limit. Guess I'm gonna have to road trip it for some more."
"O: Overall, this is excellent. I had heard good things, and this did not disappoint. It seems like everytime Founders puts a beer in a bourbon barrel they hit a home run. I highly recommend and will certainly drink this one again."
"O: well this totally sucked maybe its not my style but just tasted like liquor not beer maybe it needs time to mellow out or the style isn't for me but I hated it"
""
""
""
""
"I finally get a chance to taste this delicious beer again. The appearance is slightly dark brown. I bought a case of this because I absolutely love the vanilla, caramel, oak bourbon taste it emits. You definitely can taste the alcohol in this beer and it is worthy of praise! Founders does an amazing job brewing this. The mouth feel is warm, sweet and pleasant. I love drinking this ale when the days get dark and cold quicker. It is limited depending on where you live. If you find it, please try this! You'll enjoy it!"

"O: Well, the fact I've had this beer before, but have never bothered to review it is a testament to its quality. It is a very good beer; a big beer, but one that is not at all overdone: well balanced with the brewer showing some restraint on the bourbon barrel aging."

"O: This is a great beer. I could just sit an enjoy the aroma alone but drinking it is so much fun."
"O-great complex flavor. Definitely a sipping beer but well put together"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of my absolute favorite beers, though from prior experience I'd say it is definitely better after a few months, when the bourbon subsides a bit and the subtle smokiness of the base beer comes through. The flavor takes on more of a scotch note than a bourbon note, and this becomes a truly sublime beer experience. Even fresh, though, this is an absolute treat, worth seeking out and drinking as much as possible."
"O - Overall I love this brew! I'm immediately going to the store to buy more. Such a robust taste and smell! I wish this beer were available year round."
""
"O) This is very good, but honestly, I found myself just slightly disappointed. This is likely because my expectations were sky high, based upon anything barrel aged I've had by Founders, which have been amazing. Having said all of that, I will gladly revisit this offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I absolutely adore barrel aged beers, and I buy a six pack of every pack I can find. I also do a lot of home brewing and throw oak into nearly every batch. However, this surpassed anything I have purchased or made. It is worthy of the Founder's label, and I cannot recommend this highly enough to any big beer lovers."

"O: Not mind-blowing, but pretty tasty."
""
"12oz bottle with a Bottled Date of 10/12/12 stamped on the neck. Pours a dark brownish black with almost no head. Moderate amount of lacing. The nose is a big whiff of oaky booze with some toffee and caramel. The taste is sweet oaky booze. The toffee and caramel malt flavors come out in the middle. More bourbon and oak at the finish. Not overly sweet. Warming alcohol presence. This is a slow drinker with lots of oak and bourbon. Overall, outstanding Scotch Ale that is easily one of the best around."
""
""
""
"O: A potent, earth, sweet beer that stop short of being cloying but it definitely weighs in as a desert beer but that's the style. If you don't like sweet beers stay away. The Wee Heavy has the richness and boldness to let the oak and whiskey really infuse this beer with a lot of there character and the balance between the base beer and the oak is spot on."
""
"Pretty low drinkability at this point, I anticipate some rounded edges after a year or so."
""
"Careful, the high alcohol content can sneak up on you!"
"Tons of oak, vanilla and bourbon from the barrel. Sweet and smooth. One of the few 10%+ beers I can knock back a few of. I can get enough of this stuff! Go find some if you can."

"O - This is my motherfucking shit."

""
""
""
"O - Very impressed by this beer. It has re-defined the style for me. A great sipper that competes with some of Founder's others Barrel Aged behemoths. After buying two 4pks, I'm ready to commit to stocking up on this to get me through til next years release."
"O-great marriage of scotch ale and bourbon barrel, a delicious sipper with good balance of sweetness and bourbon flavor"

"O-Easily hands down one of my favorite Founders offering, and hands down my favorite wee-heavy. I'm glad I got a few 4 packs of this to sip on for the next few weeks. Its incredibly balanced, and no one flavor is really overpowering. I'm amazed at how balanced and drinkable this beer is. Well done Founders, well done."
""
""
"O-This is my first Barrel aged Scotch Ale, so not sure what to compare it to. I really enjoyed this beer. Much thinner than I expected. I can taste the alcohol, but I enjoy this. I will age and see what happens after a few months. Very good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a real good barrel aged brew. Mostly find stouts that are bourbon aged, was a good chance of pace to try a scotch ale. Can't wait another year to see how this ages."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, and I'm glad I was able to hunt some down. I'll be putting two bottles away to see how the bourbon notes do with some age. This is drinking rather hot when fresh, not a bad thing at all for me but that's not for everyone."
""
"The beer pours a beautiful dark, syrupy caramel with terrific ruby tints. A slight ring of creamy head is present and leaves behind a light ring around the glass, but the body of the beer is dark red, bordering on black, and completely opaque. The smell of this beer is big with malty bourbon, caramel and sweet alcohol. Slight bread in the malt adds further complexity.. Peat malt is also slightly and gives the beer an ever-so-slight roasty tinge. On the taste the beer is very complex in flavor, beginning sweet and almost cloying with spicy alcohol and too sweet malts and big bourbon flavoring, but then transitions into very slight middle caramel before the finish pulls big barrel notes onto the tongue which lingers with the cloying bourbon. Mouthfeel is big and marmalade-like on the tongue, with sharp effervescence and a prickly feeling on the tongue. The mouth is left sticky but dry with very little saliva to speak of. Overall, I think I’m going to cellar the rest of this. The alcohol is a little too much in the flavor right now for my personal taste. There are some big bourbon notes which very intriguing in a sipping beer, but I’d like to get a little more malt flavor in this and less alcohol. The complexity of both the taste and the smell are superb, and show to Founder’s superb skill in brewing extreme beers, it just is not really the flavor I’m looking for. This definitely a must try for Bourbon fans, and barrel aged beers fans alike, and a superb beer, but I plan to cellar this to bring some new complexity to it. Expect a redux review in a couple months. This beer is a sipper meant to be enjoyed slowly in the evenings in front of a roaring fire, but it is definitely worth a try."
""
""
"O - a decent beer. I'm excited to age my remaining bottles and do a vert in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is one of my favorite burbon barrel aged brews, the burbon character from the barrels and the scotch character from the malts make a delicious brew where you can really taste all the complex components going into it... Deffinatly give this a go if you have the opportunity... Particuarly of you like barrel aged beers."
"O: I can't say enough about this beer, I know I gave it a 5 but this is a rare example of a truly great beer..."
""
"Overall: This one had a shit ton of hype behind it and with this my first try of it, I'd say it has held its own! I'm a sucker for big bourbon barrel aged beers and Founders does seem to know what they are doing in this category."

"O: An incredible BA scotch ale. Nice and complex, which makes this is a definite sipper. Definitely recommended if you can find it"

"O - Just outstanding. I love this beer. my new favorite founders beer, tho i am going to crack CBS next week"
""
""
"Overall for being such a heavy powerful beer the balance is great. I had another wee heavy ale during a tasting the other day and I couldn't handle it with the alcohol being too powerful. This founders brew was expertly balanced and dangerously easy to drink. A must try."
""
""
"O- absolutely a masterpiece in terms of a bourbon aged scotch ale. Backwoods has drinkability that wants to shatter the sipping component that you need follow. So delicious fresh, I can only imagine how it tastes after a little time down"
""
""
"EDIT: had a bottle from 2010. Bourbon notes are more mellow, much heavier on the vanilla and oak accents. Much to my surprise, this one had more carbonation. Once again, awesome brew."
"O: A beautiful strong scotch ale, warm and comforting. Sweet, but nowhere near clawing. Very balanced and a perfect introduction to the style. Packed full of flavour, but not extreme. That seems to be Founders in a nutshell. Great stuff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This maybe one of the easier bourbon barrel aged beers to drink.The flavors stand right out in front. I would love this on tap, or to try a very (3-4 year) old bottle. I would trade for this again."
""
""
"A serious sipper even with age. Smooth, big, and boozy. Drink it fresh and you'll feel like you just took a dozen shots of iffy whiskey. Drink it aged."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle, this beer has a dense, dark, and cloudy chestnut brown color with a crimson-tinged halo around the edges. The aroma is intensely woody, giving an impression of being in a pine forest at dusk after a storm. There is also a mild, fruity, cherry-like sweetness that wafts out from under the wood. The flavor is similarly rustic, with notes of charred wood and dark caramel, but any nuance to the flavor profile is difficult to appreciate under a substantial alcohol heat. Overall, though, despite some identifiable faults, the total experience with this beer is still satisfying."

""
""
""
"O: Another solid brew from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with a two finger beige head. Good retention and noticeable lacing as the head recedes. A lot of bourbon on the nose with oak and toffee. Opens with a shot of bourbon, toffee, vanilla, and rich caramel maltiness. The mouthfeel is amazingly creamy, perfect carbonation, and frankly feels like velvet. A truly amazing brew that sets the standard for barrel-aged scotch ales."
""
""
"Taste is very soft and creamy. This is a hell of beer which makes you very happy while drinking it. The alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
""
"This has less peat and smoke than other Scotch Ales, but being mistaken for a very good old ale is not a bad thing. I distinctly enjoyed this beer and would like to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-- Nice beer but not that nice. Would have again as the barrel enhances the beer but does leave some fairly large gaps here and there."
"Overall this is excellent. Very appreciative that I got to try an aged version."
""
""
""
"This beer does get better in my opinion. Fresh, it's a bit hot and harsh carbonation-wise. With this time on it, it's totally mellowed out. Even with a year on it, we get similar results. I have several bottles from 2012 vintage with 1 year on them and I plan to let them stick around for some side-by-sides down the road."
"O- This was a great scotch ale. Another great offering from Founders, It kind of reminds me of the Curmudgeon with the molasses taste. Definitely probably one of the best scotch ales I've ever had. I loved the balance between all the tastes including the scotch, sweetness, molasses, etc.. Nothing was overpowering or too subtle. I definitely recommend trying this beer and I would love to pick more up in the future."

"Overall, it is an amazing bourbon beer, rich and luxurious. I like my bourbon beers heavy on the bourbon flavor, and this delivers in spades. It's great with BBQ, as an after dinner drink, or really anytime. It's one of the best beers I've had."
""
""
" Big creamy mouthfeel with a smoothness that is surprising. Notes of bourbon & caramel are balanced by an herbal bitterness & an oak dryness. The vanilla comes across as sweet & bitter. At times it reminds one of Creme Brulee or Bananas Foster. This is one big bad easy sipping smooth as hell beer that is full of flavor."
""

"Awesome beer focused largely on the barrel. I'd buy as much of this as is available."

"Overall: Really like this. There is a great amount of scotch and the sweetness is up a bit from the non BA version. Really enjoyed getting a chance to try this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A really nice bear. I had it on tap once at the ginger man in NYC and I rememberd it to have a little less bourbon. Could be mistaken. Or maybe it's the aging that has changed it. But I would think it would be the opposite. Either way, pretty nice beer. Could do with a little less bourbon, but would definitely have it again."
"Wow, the ABV is extremely well hidden and despite the flavors being built on bourbon, this was still pretty easy drinking and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: This is an excellent beer. Maybe not quite on the level of KBS, but oh so much more obtainable. Pick yourself up a couple of packs and enjoy following them through the aging process."
""
"O. Top notch barrel aged beer here. Not sure I can discern that this is a Scotch ale from any other bourbon barrel aged strong ale offering, but it's very good. Bourbon lovers rejoice!"
""
""
""
""
"O -- love every second of this. i stumbled upon a case late last year and have 5 bottles left; will enjoy every last one of them. i thoroughly enjoy this beer, and appreciate more my chance to PLAN for having one at the end of a night, when deemed appropriate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinking a 2014 bottle. I'm still not impressed. Scores unchanged."
""
""
""
"O- I'm looking forward to trying this next time it's released. This is a bit of a strange experience, having my first one after it's been aged for a couple years (post-barrel-aging). The hops have remained as spice and light bitterness, the malts are all there, and the bourbon is just wacky. This is a fine beer, a contemplative beast."
""
"O-Scotch Ales are a style that I think should be made more, throw it in a bourbon barrel and it becomes even better."
""
""
"Verdict: Drink this one around four to eight months after release for maximum enjoyment."
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this. One of the better scotch ales I've had, definitely the sweetest. While not a great textbook example of a scotch ale per se, it's still a very good beer"
""
""
""
"An excellent beer, but definitely a dessert sipper."
""
""
""
""
"I was expecting this beer to be a punch in the mouth, but it was fully lacking compared to what I was expecting. That being said, it was still a tasty beer."
"Taste is exquisitely heavy and malty. All of the aforementioned aromas make a showing on the palate, but with an added vanilla/bourbon booziness at the finish. This is a top-tier Scotch ale with a unique twist, and an experience in itself. A marvelous beer, but definitely a sipper."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best barrel-aged beers I've ever had. Such great integration between the beer and the bourbon - the light smoke, the hefty malt bill, and the dark fruits all work really well with the mellow bourbon character. Simply delicious. And the alcohol is starting to talk."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer, one of my favorite Wee Heavys."

"O: This is my second review of Backwoods Bastard. I don't like reviewing a beer more than once...but, my palate was pretty inexperienced the first time, I didn't enjoy my serving, and so my rating was pretty low. I owed BB another shot. While I can admit that my first review is essentially invalid, I still feel like the overall ratings are substantially inflated. And so it is then, I guess, that I remain in the minority on this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a massively rich, complex Scotch ale with lots of oak and bourbony sweetness. The spirit is well integrated. Very nice."
""
""
"Overall a fabulous beer. Huge flavors that you are prepared for by the aroma wafting out of the glass. Then it lives up to the anticipation with expertly executed tastes and mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just outstanding. I don't dabble into this style often, but this beer is one I'll always drink when I see it. Founders doesn't mess around with their barrels."
""
""
"O - This is a bourbon lover's beer. If I drink hard liquor, it's only good bourbon or scotch, and this would be a great substitute. Barely any burn from the alcohol, a great sweet malt backbone to complement the bourbon flavors, and the hit of pure bourbon flavor make this an amazing beer. I highly recommend to anyone, especially someone who enjoys bourbon/whiskey/scotch."
""
"Pours a slightly murky reddish brown with a tiny off white head that never really musters, but never fully dissipates either. Smells of sweet caramel and brown sugar with lots of dark fruit and oak and bourbon. The smell is heavenly really. Taste is as sweet as advertised but have enough bourbon warmth to keep is slightly balanced. Lots of dark sugars and dark fruits round out the flavor nicely. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sugary almost syrupy mouthfeel. I enjoyed the heck out of this beer! I only wish it were a little easier to obtain."
""
""
""
""
""
"But this is all about the bourbon. It burns pleasantly on the way down and leaves you feeling warm."
"O - Along with beer, I'm a huge bourbon lover. This is like the best of both words! Some might find it too boozy, but it's just right for me."
""
""
"O - A nice BA Wee Heavy, but could use a bit more body and needs some time to smooth out. At this point, pretty boozy and not really something I can drink much of. Decent."
"M - Fairly similar to the '11 with slightly lighter carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer, would love to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I liked it. But I'd like to see how this one ages. Would the bourbon smooth out a bit on the finish?"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty interesting beer. At times I really enjoy the huge bourbon presence...at times I think it's too overshadowing. I have plenty in the cellar, I'm hoping that with more time some of the more predominant flavors mellow out, allowing the base beer to come through more clearly."
""
"I buy a lot of this when it comes out, and drink it often. For a few weeks it is my regular grab beer. I don't horde it and it doesn't last long in my hands. I dig it."
""
""
""
""
""
"i had this beer a few times at Blue Dogg in Warminster P.A. Everytime i see it on a list i will get it because it is one of the best beers that Founders makes. It has an incredible balance of hops and barley. The smokey hint tops it off at the aftertaste. The head is always full and rich with overwhelming aromas that make you want more. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice scotch ale. Not enough barrel for my taste."
""
""
"O- This is an excellent beer that totally piqued my interest in exploring this style and other bourbon barrel aged beers a bit more. I've been on a pretty long hops kick and this beer may have just changed that. I wish I had more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine brew if you're into sweeter big beers. I see this on a continuum with sweet barleywines and especially old ales, but that's fine by me."
"O: Different than the last batch I had from 2011, can't wait to try again, this is good stuff 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall carbonation was there just right a very complex and great brew i really enjoy how the bourbon aging pairs with the carmel sweet malts. A great product from barrel aging one of the best I've had to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I’ll have another."
""
"O: The alcohol presence is not distracting, I think the heat and the bourbon flavors mix well with the hefty caramel malt bill and all the bready characteristics. For a beer this old it still retains a lot of bourbon notes - must be a hot one fresh. I really liked this one."
""
"Overall: I love these beers. It was great to have both at once. The base beer is one of the better scotch ales I’ve had. The barrel aged big brother is sweet, smokey greatness that any fan of big beers, scotch, bourbon, LIFE ITSELF ... will love. Seek these out. Enjoy them."

"O- I had pretty high expectations for the beer, sadly it didn't quite live up. It was solid, but didn't wow me."
"Overall - It is a good beer, but in some ways unbalanced for its style in my mind (i.e. thin body and lack of great bourbon flavor vs. its high abv and alcohol flavor). Good, but not great."

"It's a cold rainy night in Southwest Ohio and I can't think of another beer that would be better in this moment. I will seek this one out again next year!"

"M: Medium-heavy body. Rich but not heavy. Carbonation is low. Alcohol is apparent, but drinkability is still quite high."
"This is a well done strong Scotch ale. Aging in bourbon barrels just makes it more impressive. Highly recommended to fans of the style or bourbon barrel aging...and everyone else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- wow, perfection in a bottle. KBS may get the glory, but this beer is the self assured older brother."
"O: I haven't been big on Scotch Ales in the past. I really like this one though."

""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a snifter, the beer is almost completely black, with some deep blood-ruby highlights around the edges. Thin, sparse, frothy, beige head that settles slowly into an uneven covering. Aromas are darkly sweet and earthy, with a heavy dose of caramel, molasses, and cherries blended with a good booze character and some woody smells. Flavors are bold and rich all over the front of the tongue, with a decent alcohol warmth that hits the throat immediately. Taste profiles include a strong bourbon backbone, with rich caramel and molasses sweetness rolling off. Good balance of sweet characteristics, with a roasty feel, and a kick of light cherry sweetness at the end. Super rich and smooth, with a good, full body to carry both the flavor and the ABV. Aftertaste is slightly sharp thanks to the ABV, with oaky and earthy flavors. The finish is slightly cloying, with a slightly astringent feel from the booze. This is a good brew that is fairly easy to drink despite the increased alcohol presence. This is an ass kicker!"
""
""
""
"It pours a murky orange/brown with no head. There is some mild lacing around the edge. I really smell the effects of the barrel, almost a sweet rum. Mouthfeel is viscous, but not overly so. the taste is what brings me back every time. There is only a hint of alcohol and heat, mostly on the finish. The main flavor for me is caramel. I do get a little oak and ting of syrupy sweet, but that dissipates quickly. I am sure I have not said anything that hasnt already been said about this beer. Overall one of my favorite non-stout beers from Founders."
""
"having spent my summers in scotland back in the 80s as a we lad... i have had a few scotch ales in my youth and have to say that this one stands alone and above most...(probably because i am a huge bourbon fan as well)... but all aside another great product from founders... who have set the bar in many catagories..."
"O - It seems a little hot even with a year on it. The alcohol and sweetness tend to dominate the senses. I do like the warming sensation that comes over me."
""
""
"Pours a nice bright mahogany with a thin bright white head. The smell is strongly bourbon with some slight malt/caramel in the background. Taste was way too heavy with bourbon for me, It just tasted like any scotch ale I have ever had except with a shot of bourbon added. It was still good, just a bit one note for my taste and nothing that made me able to distinguish it from anything else. The mouthfeel was good, no burn from the alcohol, but nothing particularly special either. Overall I was a little disappointed. It was still a good beer, I just feel like a lot of people really like this beer and it seemed pretty one note to me. I would definitely like to try this one again with some age to perhaps let the bourbon settle into a more balanced brew."
""
"O: Very tasty, and pretty drinkable if you're in the mood for an oak bomb. The barrel treatment dominates here, but it's well executed so it's hard to complain. As always, it would be nice if the base beer showed through more."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. It is a little light in the body for the style but still very enjoyable. I enjoy a little bit of smoked aspect in this type of offering and I didnt really pick up on any of that. Instead, I was left with an enjoyable barrel aged beer that could easily be mistaken for a barleywine/strong ale. Overall a pretty solid offering, I wouldn't mind trying one of these fresh to see if there is any big difference."
""
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: I had this beer several years back, and it was too much for me. Now, I absolutely love it! It's meant for sipping, and the flavors come out more as this one warms up."
"Cost: $6.50 for a 10 oz pint pour or $15.99 for a four pack."
"Yet again, Founders delivers a true masterpiece in brewing."
""
"Just a phenomenal beer, so tasty and balanced, lovely bourbon character."
""
"M- Carbonation is active but dim. For a barrel aged Old Ale this is fine IMO. I feel it's a little thin, I wish it where a little more chewy but still a decent mouthfeel."
""
"I have looked forward to this one for a while. Poured into a sniffer, the beer was a dark color with hints of brown. The aroma, which was quite potent, was vanilla and alcohol. Being a scotch ale in its initial state, one expects a certain level of sweetness. I detected tastes of prune and vanilla mixed in with the scotch flavors. The alcohol from being aged was very detectable in the taste. It had a negative impact on the overall scope of flavors. The alcohol stays on the tongue in the aftertaste, making the aftertaste disappointing since the more desireable flavors disappeared. For all the hype that went with this beer, this is slightly disappointing. The barrel aged flavors did not blend well with the beer, making the alcohol flavor too prominent. Overall though, this is still a pretty good drink."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 10/07/11. Pours cloudy dark red color with a small dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, vanilla, coconut, toasted malt, oak, bourbon, and molasses. Simply incredible aromas here with fantastic balance. Taste of huge caramel, coconut, vanilla, toasted malt, bourbon, toffee, molasses, and a bit of spiciness. Fairly clean finish; but some lingering notes of caramel, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and molasses on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and quite full bodied; with a very creamy, silky, and incredibly smooth drinking mouthfeel. Alcohol is almost completely hidden; but there is a small bit of booziness and a slight warming after the finish. Incredible balance of flavors in the taste and aromas. Overall this is definitely a world class brew. Incredible flavor balance, with some unique flavor combination thanks to the barrel aging. I am glad I have more of this; I wonder how it is in a year."

"Damn. Great beer. Wish they made it year-round, and that it wasn't so hard to score."
"12 ounce bottle courtesy of scray24, poured into a pint glass. Deep dark amber with a small eggshell head. I’m basically getting bourbon on the nose, without much scotch ale influence. Malty caramel with oodles of toasted coconut. Not an alcoholic smell though, very smooth. Flavor is very similar. The main note here is woody bourbon, heavy on coconut, light on booze. A little vanilla and honey come through. A strong sweet beer, perfect for nightcap purposes."
""
"Hands down, best Wee Heavy I've had. I said, put your hands down!"
"half finger rapidly dissipating head, no lacing, on a cloudy dark brown amber body. Aroma of the bourbon barrel is right on. Nice oak and vanilla notes. Mostly oak and bourbon in the flavor. Smooth with some molasses and caramel notes. medium to full body and moderate carbonation. Just the right amount of bourbon flavoring, smooth and surprisingly drinkable."
""
""
"Great caramel color and a thin ring of lace at the edge of the glass. Tons of bourbon and oak on the nose, a little vanilla. Taste follows aroma with some extra malti sweetness behind. Lightly carbonated and super smooth, moderate alcohol warmth. A sipper."

"O: I really enjoy this year's batch of Backwoods. I have had it on tap and out of the bottle, and both are excellent. I believe the draft version is even smoother than the bottled version, but this is still great. I loved last year's batch with a year of age to it. I am looking forward to this batch with a year on it even more."
""
"Another good -bal from Founders although not great overall. It's a bit too sweet at times and the bourbon got a bit too hot. This review is of an '11 vintage. I much prefer about 9-12 months on these to mellow out some of the flavors. It's sublime then."
""

"O - Wow! Where has this beer been all my life? I absolutely recommend this, especially if you enjoy all the bourbon and oak notes in your beer as well as your whiskey!"

"O - An awesome beer! Near perfect for the style, just a bit too heavy on the heat. Very glad I have one aging, can't wait to see the results!!! Thanks for the awsome brew gentlemen! Highly recommended."
"Overall this is a great, complex beer with a lot going on. I will say outright I am not a fan of scotch ales as a style (to include founders dirty bastard), but this beer is strong enough to make me look past that. For the price point, it won't be something i'm going to be seeking out a lot in the future, as I'd rather spend that kind of money on a great imp. stout.... but if you even remotely are fan of scotch ales and/or very bourbon-forward beers, stock up on this one."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style but there are others I would drink first including Founders Dirty Bastard."
""
"All around, Founders has done a great job with this brew. I enjoyed the uniqueness of this beer and its pretty well balanced all around. I wouldn't say its full bodied, but lies somewhere in between middle and full."

"Another big thanks to 2BDChicago for the chance to try this. 12oz. bottle served at 51 degrees in a tulip. Pours a slightly hazy, brownish-maroon hue with a creamy, quarter inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders forming a frothy band around the edges. Great nose on this beer - bourbon notes, brown sugar, raisins and prunes along a robust, malty backbone. Aromas are very much reminiscent of an old ale. Taste follows nose; however, the bold aromas are somewhat hollowed out in the flavor profile; nothing really pops. That said, I also get some buttery notes as well as a slight earthy hops presence at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation as well as a trace of acidity. There's also a little bit of residual alcohol heat that lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall, a very good beer. I'm not really getting the wee heavy on this, so I am rating more to preference than style. Another great beer from Founders; however, not a beer that I would cellar for an extended period of time as I feel like this brew could develop some oxidized flavors."
"This was the leadup beer to me 1st shot at the Mountie's best so I feels like I beer threadin' my gullet with some soft comfy furniture before put down some plastic. This stuff sweats sweet maple and burrrbon. I am liking each sip whilst weighing me hopes and dreams on sipping some equal to the sweat off Zeus' balls*c. This grog is floatin' around in a Chimay glass just doin' iyts thing. Be squid-ink black and causin all kinds of trouble. Its way too smooth for as strong as this swill is. Damn I am livin in heaven while still havin' a ticker that ticks. Yea, ya know. Good stuff, better'n Duff."

""

"Overall, one of the most drinkable ones I have had in a while. I sure wish we got this stuff locally. I was lucky to get this as an extra in a trade. Cheers!"
""
""
"pours out a rich brown body with copper highlights all thru it. not much carbonation to speak of, just a thin tan ring that eventually disappears. there are notes of vanilla and oak that blend wonderfully to make a nice bourbon aroma. taste is like drinking bourbon without the burn. once again the vanilla shines thru with a dry oak feel to it and a nice caramel malt balance. mouthfeel is silky smooth, almost oily, it goes down so smooth with just a touch of warming in the belly. overall this is an excellent beer that everyone should try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Black pour with a short lived white head. Nothing amazing. The smell however, is quite amazing. Huge hits of vanilla, coconut, and bourbon. Really awesome. Taste has less of the bourbon, but all of the coconut and malt. Very german chocolate cake like. Smooth as silk body, and while the bourbon is prominant, it is not overpowering. Very good stuff. I will be picking up much more of this on the next release."

"acquired in a trade and thank you chris! pours a deep earthy brown, very murky with some deep red edges. 1 finger of a lightly browned head quickly fell to a thin layer while showing good retention. the aroma is of sweet sweet candied sugar, caramel fudge but not much of a barrel presence. the taste is among the sweetest that has ever graced my palate. follows the nose with a strong torched caramelized vanilla bean awesomeness, roasted pralines and subtle woody dryness, then the bourbon shines through with some very warming heat. considering the barrel aging there is not much of a charred character but bourbon is the dominant flavor with a touch of oak. very smooth on the palate and quite the sipper the carbonation is just enough and done right. overall what a great brew for the season. i do wish there was more of an oak or charred characteristic to help balance some of the sweetness but i can't complain. dirty bastard stands its ground well and could take the cake in comparison. all in all, this is a great beer and im very happy that i got it and have one left. once again, well done founders. (don't see this one improving with age)"

"Pours a deep amber to brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, oaky and bourbon smells. In the taste, bourbon, oaky, and sweet notes of vanilla. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry vanilla and bourbon like aftertaste. Like drinking bourbon, but less abrasive."
""

""
""
""

""

"Overall this is a very nice beer, I really like the mix of the sweet, caramelized base beer with the heavy handed character of the bourbon barrel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The bourbon is overpowering. I suspect that if you have bottles and age it for a year or two it'll taste great but it is not good fresh. I love Founder's beers and was excited to finally get to try something other than the breakfast stout. I am, however, very much disappointed. Beer should taste like beer. If I wanted a glass of bourbon, I would have purchased a glass of bourbon."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a treat of a beer , a slow sipping tasty beer that will reward anyone who is fond of scotch/bourbon."
""
""
"Murky rusty brown. Tiny wisp of beige head. Full on bourbon bomb in the nose. Hints of caramel and bready malts. Rich toasted malt, caramel, coffee, light vanilla. Above all that is the bourbon though. Man this stuff is a bourbon lovers wet dream. Light carbonation. Great sipping beer for cold winter nights."
""
""
"Poured into a tall glass at room temperature this wee heavy shows a deep mahogany with rosy/root beer colored edges. It produces a solid, light tan head that settles into a nice blanket and leaves a respectable web of lacing. The aroma offers deep vanilla scotch and woodsy malt, subtle dark fruits and heavy grains. Completely enticing. The first taste brings intense scotch malt with super sweet pine and deep fig/prune. Vanilla certainly comes back as well with a sure alcohol presence but one that does not block the urge to go back to the well to keep the flavor coming. Bourbon and oak can definitely be identified, as advertized. It's just such a classic medley of all things a scotch ale should be, and then some. It's a pretty hefty brew with fairly full body, nearly cloying except that the flavor works right through it to make it drinkable enough for the style. It's finely, but thoroughly carbonated and makes for a smooth, somewhat silky feel that works well despite the seriousness of this brew. I'd say the 10% ABV-plus is evident but very well managed here. It's just a great, serious scotch ale. A wee heavy, yes, exquisitely so!"

"This pours a rich caramel color. It has a slight aroma to it, light notes of caramel and toasted coconut, both of which become more apparent and pronounced as it warms. Tastes great, with the coconut sweetness and a warming alcohol working in tandem. It reminded me of an aged barleywine once the hops mellowed out—in terms of the sweetness and finish—and I’d certainly drink it again. A real treat!"
""
""
"Smells of Vanilla, Bourbon, Licorice, alcohol. Had this fresh and now a few months past. The vanilla has definitely faded leaving more of a bourbon alcohol, heat, and oak presence to this beer. Still good, just one i won't be aging. The scotch ale is in there somewhere providing a great base for this beer to stand on."
"O: A solid all around beer. It's impressive how smooth it is for 10%. I could use just a little more in your face flavor out of it, though."
""
"This is an amazing beer. It is like a luxury model of one of my all time favorite beers - BBC's Bourbon Barrel Big Brown. I do love barrel-aged stouts, but I wish more brewers would make barrel-aged versions of easy-drinking sweet, malty beers like brown ales and Scottish/Scotch ales. The oaky tones of the bourbon just go perfectly with these beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a great barrel aged offering from founders. Very bourbon-centric though, which to some may be off-putting. That being said I think the base beer melded great with the aging and preserved its integrity while taking on an even more complex flavor profile"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Unique beer, I can compare it some but I will let you be the judge, if you like rum meets malts with slight hints of vanilla you will love this beer. It's definitely not for most but definitely for all real beer drinkers alike, Cheers to all!"
"O: I really enjoyed this. A lot of bal- beers tend to be rather unbalanced, either it's all barrel or it's invisible. This hit the perfect harmony of a great base beer made better with barrel character. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who likes Bal beers. Founders clearly knows what they are doing with barrels."

"Overall I think this beer is stupendous! And that's not a word I often use to describe a beer. Last time I had this, I believe it was pretty old. While still good, I don't quite remember the same wow factor that I get with this relatively fresh one! Extremely well done barrel aged beer. If I could get my hands on a couple four packs of this, I know what I'd be drinking almost every night! Very well done."

"Overall Impression- While I enjoyed this one on-tap @ the Founder's Beer Dinner in the beginning of this year, I feel I was able to grasp more the second time around and enjoyed it more. Still has such a huge Jim Beam clone like aroma and taste, I don't know if I could EVER drink more than 16oz of this in one night! Tough drinkability but a very great brew. Have 3 more left... Who shall I share them with?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice body, chewy, oaky caramel and light bourbons round this brew out. Has the aesthetic of an Old Ale brewed by a crazy warlock in a musty stone cellar deep below the earth. Great balance. I dig it… probably be great with some chili."

""

""
""

"Overall: A great wee heavy. Delicious bourbon notes."
""
"Overall, another pretty delicious beer from Founders. I don't know how many of these I could have in one sitting, largely because of how sweet it is (not to mention the high ABV) but a very good representation of the style."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A definite slow sipper. Amazingly good, but one is enough. Becomes much more dangerous as it warms up as the alcohol gets hidden. Thankfully the bourbon flavor and smell is there to remind you of the higher ABV and to slow down. I think this is a wee heavy that would indeed put a fierce scotsman in his place, mellowing him out with one, and prompting him to fight after two. As I said about the aroma, it's like a whiskey toffee fudge candy in liquid beer form and that makes this a very good beer overall."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer, but if you prefer the taste of bourbon, drink this fresh, as the barrel disappeared quickly. Even with a few months on this, the flavors still balance nicely."
""
""
"Overall, for a beer of this magnitude and age, I find that it is a very enjoyable beer. Formidable for sure, it is a sipper, but every sip is delicious and well worth it."
""
""
""
"Overall: I love this beer! Very rich and complex, and not nearly as hot as I'd anticipated. Gonna hold onto some of these in my cellar, and highly recommend you give it a try as well."
""
""
""
"It seems aroma wise to have lost a little something, or maybe this is its style. I do not know as this is the first bottle I have ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost feels like the high test Cab's coming out of Napa Valley these days. Big mouthfeel, dark sweet candy, alcohol upfront, round and biting. Very worthy to seek out and hang on to."
"This is a special brew and one that can convert the uninitiated."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer overall when you are in the mood for something a bit different and boozy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is pretty good. I've never been a huge fan of Scotch Ales, but this is solid. Another winner from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was medium to heavy in body. Carbonation seemed a little light, and the beer seemed rather boozy at the end."

""
"O - Overall, this is an excellent beer. Just about perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This barrel-aged wee heavy has the makings of a favorite sipper, with alcohol distributed evenly and prominently throughout. It is the bold but respectful handling of alcohol that makes this beer special, allowing the booze to define the experience without becoming unruly of excessive."
"Overall: Drinkability is 5.0 and beyond. I could down this like water! But it should be bigger, like Old Stock or something similar. The mouthfeel brings it down. However, if it were $2 a bottle instead of $4, I would drink this all day long!"
""
""
"O: Overall, I really did not enjoy this beer, a rarity as I always enjoy Founders beers. I don't get the melding of flavors, they don't seem to work in my opinion. I love Dirty Bastard, but do not dig this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is quite good, very enjoyable, I would definitely buy this again if I found it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Like a Dirty Bastard with bourbon. Lots of flavor. One of the best very-strong-bourbon-tasting beers I've had. Perhaps it's the fact this is a Wee Heavy, but I prefer their Kentucky Bourbon Stout a little more. Nevertheless, this is one fine beer. It ages REALLY well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Do not let this fairly limited seasonal beer slip through your fingers another year."
""
""
"O: I would avoid it, but a lot of people like this beer. I would just recommend getting bourbon, since the bourbon in this beer is so overpowering that it hinders much of the ale-taste found in Dirty Bastard."
""
""
"Notes: Perfect mouthfeel, good barrel aging. Hot, but not overly so. Maintains a great balance of beer and barrel."
"Cheers, and Happy Thanksgiving!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid drink, I'm curious how the flavours will develop with some age on it. Definitely a solid performer, as per Founders' usual."

"I was expecting that it would be perhaps a bit richer, but I found it was about the same as DB. Surprisingly, it seems much smoother though, and that's a real accomplishment when you add Bourbon. I was expecting a lot of boldness from this, and while it didn't deliver as much boldness as I expected, it seemed to be very balanced and tastefully done."
""
""
""

"Overall: The age has done this one very well. Extremely smooth and complex. I'll definitely have this one again."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Quite a huge and complex brew. The flavors complement each other very well. It will be be interesting to see how this ages."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is truly like sipping a glass of bourbon, I'm nearly tempted to throw some ice in a rocks glass and pour a few fingers to sip! This is not a bad thing really, the flavors are actually very well balanced, but the bourbon and alcohol are the main acts here."
"O - This is the 2nd time I've had this beer. Both from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. The 1st time I thought this beer was god's gift to earth. This time it was just really good. Interested to see what the 3rd bottle brings."
""
""
"Overall- Good beer. I haven't had this fresh, but would assume that it is a little ""brighter"" than this. Maybe the hops are a little more apparent. Some bigger alcohol flavors might be there as well. 4/5"

""
"The mouthfeel is medium to heavy with low carbonation levels. Definitely something you have to sip. The booze holds you back a little, but the wonderful flavors constantly draw you back in. Overall, this is a great brew. For someone that doesn't like bourbon, this would be something to avoid. However, this is absolutely wonderful to me."
""
""
""
"Had this on-tap at Sapsucker's Hop & Grubs in Huntington, NY. The deep reddish color and nice tannish head are very pleasing to the eye. On the nose the distinctive aroma of bourbon and strong alcohol lets you know that this beer has been cask-aged. The first sip confirms the bourbon barrel aging. The syrrupy quality of the beer allows it to linger after first sip and leaves a lasting bourbon, vanilla, and caramel notes on the tongue. A fantastic beer definitely one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
"I had an early 2010 vintage and picked up more vanilla and molasses on the palate with less bourbon burn. The mouth feel was also better, being more creamy and less dry, not as much heat."

"Another great seasonal from Founders. Been awhile since I've had this one but just as good as I remember. Worth hunting down a bottle or two a year. Thanks kawilliams81!"
"Overall: A wonderful beer as long as you let it warm up so that you can appreciate all of the subtle flavors."
"overall a very good beer will be looking for more of this"
"O- This is really nice! Burnt sugar and wood... vanilla, dried fruit and cocoa. It has a nice funky yeastiness on the nose and the back of the tongue. Has some candycorn and caramel popcorn notes. I'm really glad I have a second bottle to cellar for a couple of years!"
"Overall I really liked this brew. I'm far from familiar with Scotch Ales but I think this is a great example. To my ignorant pallet this seems like a ""double"" Scotch Ale, so maybe not the best choice to someone new to the style. Love the prominent, but clean, bourbon taste. Cheers!"
"Bottled: difficult to read with new wax. 06/2011? A: dark brown with a transient finger of toast foam falls to a scatteredsheet of the same. Where able, excellent clarity. Spotty lace. (4) S: caramel, oat, leather, toffee. Hints of raisin. (4.5) T: sweet with tones of English yeast and subtle clove and molasses. Really great tasting scotch ale. (4.5) M: full and creamy with just a hare too much carb. Semi dry finish. (4) O: one of the best of the style I’ve had. Yummy. (4.5)"
"A darn good beer. I'm liking this Wee Heavy style."
"Overall: This is easily the best Scotch ale I have had. The way the bourbon works with the smoke and malt is absolutely superb. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of bourbon barrel-aged ales"
"Enhances with warming up, bourbon mellows out a little bit. I enjoy bourbon aged beers, but they're not my favorite. I can tell which ones are quality and this is one. Will be anxious to see how this beer drinks with some age on it."
"Overall: no doubt about it, this beer is excellent. The bourbon barrel treatment works wonders for the Backwoods Bastard.. my favorite scotch ale to date."
"O - Overall this beer was delicious. Sad I only have two bottles of this. Wish I had more."
"Overall this a fine beer. Very smooth and easy to drink considering the abv and the fact that it's aged in bourbon barrels. A real nice beer that I will revisit for sure!"
"O: What a difference barrel aging can make – this is a much more enjoyable bastard-in-a-bottle! This beer has a hell of a kick, but enough mellow flavors to counteract it with incredible smoothness. I’d really love to have this on-tap; that version of Dirty Bastard was even better than its bottled counterpart."
"Backwoods Bastard pours mahogany to a deep red, with about a finger of beige foam. It displays good retention, and there's a small amount of lacing left clinging to the glass. The nose is fantastically sweet/malty. Vanilla ad caramelize sugar immediately jump out at my nose, eventually making room for subtle bourbon and oak scents to show themselves and add a layer of complexity. The flavor takes that great balance though and turns it on its ear, as bourbon and wood trample all over the malty flavors present in the beer. Those spirit and oak notes work much better in a supporting role, and aren't great acting as the focal point of the beer. The beer's carbonation is alright, tending towards the less intense side of things. The body though is inexcusably light, not nearly as full and rich as such a big beer brewed in a malt forward style requires. Backwoods Bastard is an alright beer, and it has some potential, but as is I think this is one case where I prefer the base beer to the barrel aged version."
"Thanks to Illudium for the bottle."
"O: This is a world class wee heavy. The bourbon notes are just outstanding. One of the seasonal I look forward to every year."
"O- a very good beer that will sort of remind you of CBS or KBS without the coffee and deep complex flavors. It's basically 3 flavors of bourbon/whisky, caramel malt, and spice note finish. Very strong and will knock you out. A very good beer"
"O: An intense and overwhelming beer fresh, and a tasty caramel bomb after a year of aging. I've got 2 more bottles aging and I'm curious how it'll be after sitting for another year or two."
"With the first sniff there's no mistaking that this is a bourbon barrel aged beer. Nice dark copper hue, good head. Dirty Bastard is probably my least favorite Founders beer (but I'm a huge Founders fan). The barrel aging really works with it, though. The bourbon *almost* overtakes the beer here, but since I like bourbon so much, this isn't a problem."
"Draft to snifter. Looks good; brown with a little head laced around the circumference of the glass. Smells good too; malt and bourbon are noticeable. Tastes great! It's this beer's best attribute. The bourbon barreling mellows out the scotch flavoring nicely. Mouthfeel is good. It would get better with age, but for a draft I can't complain. Overall, a very good beer, and one of the few that the taste is the best feature of."
"overall: damn good and i know it will be better in a year!"
"Medium mouthfeel and just a hint of the alcohol. Overall, one of the best Scotch Ales I've ever had."
"This is a fine, fine creation--the bourbon barrel treatment makes the flavors of the Scottish ale truly shine."
"Scott is the absolute man for cracking some of these for us during this Bliss tasting. Seriously. It pours a clear dark russet-amber topped by a finger of dirty light-tan foam. The nose comprises bourbon, oak, light vanilla, caramel, toffee, light peat moss, raisin, dates, and a touch of cocoa. The only thing holding this smell back is the strength of the bourbon, which comes close to singeing my nosehairs with every sniff. (But this ain't enough to deter me from going further, mind you.) The taste brings in more of the same, but with a decidedly stronger and boozier bourbon component, which threatens to overtake everything else in a blaze of usurpatory glory. It's still pretty tasty, but much more one-dimensional than it could have been. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, yeah, it's heavy on the bourbon, but it's still a damn fine, tasty brew. It's not amazing, but it's more than an experience."
"Years later, tried again fresh in 14, and the fruity notes are excellent in aroma. Flavor still boozy and vanilla dominant. Upped my rating a bit."
"Overall: A rich, smooth wee heavy that has a nice hoppy balance."
"O - The Backwoods Bastard is a unique bourbon barrel offering that combines the taste and boozyness of bourbon with sweet butterscotch-esque flavors. It's not an everyday type of beer, but it is a tasty treat."
"I know a lot of people who really look forward to this one and hype it up a good bit. For me I can’t say I’m in that group. I love bourbon but frankly I was bored to death by Dirty Bastard. This beer is rather tasty and I am putting a few bottles aside to see if age helps, but frankly this one finds itself in that special place where it isn’t a great late night sipper or a nice pairing for a meal."
"O: Solid work from the boys at Founders. Keep 'em coming. Oh, a note though- I'd actually suggest letting this guy get up to around 50 degrees, because I feel the chill actually suppresses some of the flavours"
"Still trying to decide how I feel about the buttery flavor..."
"O. Excellent bourbon barrel aged ""old ale"" or ""wee heavy"" depending on how you classify it. Highly recommended. This will vary year to year and is great to have in the cellar."
"O: One of the top tier beers Founders makes. Phenominal. Only thing I don't like about this beer is that is comes out only once a year."
"Why would anyone drink a Bud after having this type of beverage? (I'll never know!)"
"Pour is the same, but the smell has lost some dark fruits and gained a barleywine smell. carbonation leaves what looks like a film at the top. It has actually gained more vanilla and beautiful oak barrel notes. I actually like it more now than before."
"O This stuffs great. I'm not a gigantic malt bomb guy but the bourbon works perfectly with everything to make a really tasty and dangerously drinkable beer."
"I enjoyed this fine beverage from a modern day tulip glass at cellar temp. When held up to the sun it shows a deep red with a thick white head that dissipates quickly. This beer smells like a loaf of bread with vanilla, oak and a hint of caramel and dark fruit. The taste is unrivaled amongst its peers. Extremely well-balanced the flavors of the barrel only compliment this beer. No single flavor is overwhelming. Not boozy considering its ABV. Mouthfeel is thin yet creamy. This bastard is drinking really well right now and will only improve with age."
"Backwoods Bastard was a very early beer I had when I first started drinking craft beer, and while I do remember enjoying it I don't think I appreciated it as I do now. It's so complex, flavorful and smooth; unlike many other bourbon barrel aged beers. One of my Fall favorites that I cannot get enough of."
"Overall good brew enjoyable perhaps not as great as some see it for me as barrel ageing defiantly upfront as you have to search for anything else."
"O-This is one of my favorite releases from founders. It took some time for me to get into. When I first tried it a couple years ago I thought the bourbon was overpowering now I think it is perfect. This is really a fantastic example of what barrel aging does to a beer. I know it is not comparable to KBS but I enjoy this beer much more and just sit back and enjoy it."
"A really good beer, especially for the cold winter nights."
"O: The barrel is well integrated yet again in a Founders beer. This is sweet, but not overly sweet. Great beer."
"O - Overall very nice. My only gripe about this beer is the amount of dark fruits in the beginning of the taste. I was hoping from the nose that it would be more vanilla and caramel, with the fruit and toffee as more of a backdrop. I will also say that I thought this was much more impressive the first time I had it on tap at Founders."
"O - Another excellent beer from founders. I don't know if I've ever had a barrel aged beer with this strong of a bourbon flavor and aroma, but it works well with this beer."
"O- I would buy this beer again to age for 6-12 months. Right now for me, it's just out of balance. I'd prefer more vanilla/oak/malt on the palate instead of the fresh bourbon/booze which dominates. I can see this beer aging wonderfully though."
"Seriously, the Founders brewmasters are rock stars."
"This beer pours with a dark brown color with a fine finger of head that recedes to a ring around the outside of the glass fairly quickly. The aroma has a lot of caramel, malt, and some bourbon and a bit of vanilla. There is a mild frutiness that comes out as the beer warms a bit. The taste is amazing. Malty, caramel, with lots of vanilla and a touch of booziness which accompanies a very nice bourbon note. A bit sweet as well. The mouthfeel is where it should be. Not much carbonation and a pretty full mouthfeel. Very well made beer. One of my favorites from one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall, an excellent beer that makes a good nightcap. This is the first barrel-aged bourbon beer I've had that was not a stout and I was pleased with the result."
"O: Really interesting style with the scotch/bourbon flavor. Definitely worth a try! Tread lightly though, because you will be feeling it before you finish just one."
"O- While I'm not the biggest fan of beers aged in bourbon, I had to pick this up considering Founders makes it. That said, I prefer this beer to any other bourbon barrel aged beer (over Angel's Share and Bourbon Santa's, but that could be inferred by my previous reviews). Nothing in this beer is overpowering to the point that the other flavors are hid, and the balance of the beer is really the most impressive aspect. Is $4 too much for a bottle of this? Absolutely not, but I probably won't be stocking up on it when Founders still makes stouts."
"O- So glad I got to try this. It is such a great step in learning more and more about beer. This beer is pretty legit, great beer."
"Revisited on 11/10/13 - current score reflects those changes. Score from original review was 3.43. Suffice to say, I've acquired more of a taste for BA beer as well as wee heavies."
"O. Very impressed. Which really isnt a surprise for me with a beer coming from Founders. Really nice barrel aged flavors going on with this one especially vanilla. Perfect beer to warm up with on a cold day. Like most Founder's beers, the only thing that could improve this beer would be to make it available year round."
"Cheers"
"O: I thought it would be a bit better but I still really enjoy it. I couldn't have more then one."
"Pours a brilliant reddish-brown. Thin white head fades rapidly. Aroma is dominated by bourbon, not so much oak. More bourbon and malt in the taste. Warm alcohol. No hop presence. Very low carbonation, mimicking a liquor. Would definitely buy this again."
"Overall a really nice complex beer, can't wait till Founders expansions when they can put out of more of this each year."
"This thing immediately smells of bourbon. I will say that i was turned off a bit in the fact that the previous night i had had a little too much to drink and this brought back some of the spins for me. Now getting on to it. This is an amazing brew. The bourbon is nice and mellow once it warms and this is extremely drinkable for a nice 10% er. A nice dark red to brown hue, no head at all, it was really fresh so a little carbonation was noticeable. I will say that the feeling is a little think for my taste overall, but this is worlds above some of the other wee heavies ive had."
"Tastes really really good and potent."
"Overall, Founders nails it everytime and this is no exception. Great bourbon aged brew that holds great characteristics. The barrel really work some magic in this beer. The nose is really heavy on the booze and suggests that this brew should be cellared for a little while."
"A nice fireside sipper. It could work with a bourbon-spiked bread pudding."
"O- Wasn't as good as I had expected, but a quality libation for sure. I thought the nose was amazing with the body and taste lacking abit. All in all worth trying once for sure"
"Overall - I had this beer for the first time when it had a year on it and i was absolutely blown away. I think i prefer this beer with more age on it. When i found out my local shop had it i went and bought three 4 packs because thats how much i loved it when i first had it. However, the newer bottle tastes a lot different than an aged one. I really wanted to review this one higher, i should have taken notes on the first one. But honestly this is a spectacular brew."
"The feel of this beer is bold and complex with plenty of flavor to dwell over. Bitterness it countered by some sweet malt and things seem to battle back and forth but always seems to even things out toward the end."
"Barrel-aging usually makes big beers better and Backwoods Bastard is a fine example of this. The base beer was already a good brew and the addition of bourbon barrels has only made it better. Founders really does know how to keep pushing the envelope and come out winners a vast majority of the time. Prost!"
"2012 Update: The 2012 batch has a really nice barrel character to it, lots of bourbon, oak and vanilla. Unfortunately it kinda ends up being ""bourbon barrel aged generic malty beer"" as the base beer doesn't offer much other than support for the barrel flavor. It reminds me of a lesser Firestone Walker Double Double Barrel Ale. I'd probably give it a similar score but for different reasons."
"O- Phenominal; This is my favorite Founder's beer. I love the complexity that the barrel-aging brings to it. I am disappointed that it will not be as abundant this year as it was last."
"Woody, malty aroma has a strong overtone of bourbon - no surprise there! - and a hint of molasses. It pours a luscious clear dark caramel with a decent light tan head that leaves some good lacing. Rich, malty flavor has notes of molasses and horehound with a strong but not fierce bite from the bourbon and a woody, slightly fruity undertone. Smooth, fizzy texture has average body. Overall, delicious and recommended!"
"This is rich and big. It holds the alcohol very well and is certainly not a gulping beer. The feel is really good and deep"
"Mouthfeel was smooth. Medium-bodied beer that went down smoothly aside from the bourbon struggle! Overall, I liked this brew well enough...but the bourbon was just TOO overwhelming! The balance of flavor was not good enough for my taste. Still, I would be willing to try it again...maybe next time, on tap!"
"Definitely the ""least good"" of any Founders brews I've had. Poured a reddish-mahogany color, muddy, with a spotty white head that receded to a layer of patchy bubbles. Booze-heavy aroma, almost straight bourbon, big and woody (there's a B&B joke in there somewhere). Let's be honest: this tasted like a cheap boilermaker, big on the booze, eliminating almost all complexity that might exist. Tones of oak-aged vanilla come through, but the bourbon just kills the palate almost completely. Tasted way higher in alcohol content than it actually was. Thinner than most Scottish ales I've had, but certainly not as good as some. The texture is more what I'd like to have in that it wasn't too syrupy, and certainly not as peaty, but it just didn't work with the intensity of the booze flavor. Not very good, not very drinkable, and I'll be happy never having it again. Sorry, Founders."
"O – Overall I really enjoyed this beer. I thought the flavors all complimented each other well. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes bourbon barrel aged beers."
"Flavor is where this beer knocks it out of the park. The mix of malt and caramel with smoky bourbon and a light alcohol burn. This is what I want from a beer. Toffee and butterscotch are there as well. Body is medium with very light carbonation. Overall this is a great beer."
"O: Good sipping beer on a cold night. Lots of strong flavors (and ABV) in this one. Try to enjoy it warm, it's way better. Not really my style of beer but a good example of the style nonetheless."
"Overall - The base beer, like Dirty Bastard, just isn't that interesting. The bourbon aging makes it quite nice, though."
"O: I love this beer. I'm a sucker for oaked beers that have a tail end of vanilla. backwoods is underrated. KBS,CBS, ect.. get all the attention. this batch of backwoods hit my store same day as CBS made its rounds. while people pillaged the toowns for CBS, backwoods sat on the shelf waiting for me. id say even if you don't like scotch ales, this being barrelled makes it easy for anyone with one tastebud in thier lousy mouths. keep buying and racing around states looking for KBS/CBS and leave this for me. Founders youre my fave."
"Unfortunately I've had different experiences with Founders. I want to really like their beers but I find them sometimes falling a bit short."
"O: Very good beer. One of my absolute favorite scotch ales, and something I go for (when accessible) whenever I'm in the mood for bourbony flavors but without the bite."
"O - A scotch ale that actually tastes like scotch?!? That's bloody brilliant. Great job of pushing the envelope while staying faithful to a much underrated style.Yet another example of why Founders is one of America's top notch breweries."
"Quite simply my new personal favorite. Founders has reached legendary status with this one in my book. \m/m/"
"O - Great beer, love the strong bourbon taste, it will be hard for me to age any of these since the bourbon and vanilla are so delicious. Pretty drinkable for 10% and I must be a lightweight since this started to numb my tongue."
"age this boozy doggy. a interesting merge between beer marshmallow maltiness and bourbon hints. some walnut and zucchini bread hints. pour is sticky and nice head of mahogany with an off white head. nose of bourbon and caramel. palate is hard on the tough like bourbon and then cuts clean. this is not syrupy at all. its a bit hot. its a nice blend of flavors. that ends sooner than the expected barrel ages stout. dry mineral tongue. dessert that doesn't let itself linger."
"overall - great beer, i think i liked it more than fresh after everything melded together, have 4 2010's left so ill see how they are doing soon"
"Thanks"
"Overall: With every sip you taste the bourbon. I am a big fan of Old Stock Cellar Reserve and this beer reminds me of the other in many ways. It is balanced with an excellent taste that is as smooth as 25 year old bourbon. Considering the difference in price and overall availability I would visit this beer again, maybe not a staple but certainly a regularly."
"d - Overall I thought this was a great scotch ale, and much better on tap than in bottles. Bourbon is there mixxing with sweet caramel malts and dark fruits, and it isn't nearly as alcohol-dominated as I remember it. Would love to have it again."
"On tap at ChurchKey in DC. Pours a clear, dark amber with a bright red tint and a thick tan head that slowly settles down into a thin layer of even lace, leaving thick residue along the inside of the glass. The nose is strong with vanilla, cinnamon, and oaky bourbon, along with a light cherry undertone with a ton of caramel maltiness as well. The flavor is much the same with the sweeter malt up front, moving to the very oaky vanilla and cinnamon bourbon, a hint of cherry, and a bit of burnt caramel bitterness. The body is full with light carbonation and a long vanilla bourbon, caramel malt, and lightly burnt bitter finish. Not a huge fan of Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy styles, but glad to have tried this out!"
"truly amazing beer. Hints of bourbon, tons of vanilla, toasty oak, buttery toffe and caramel, slight Scottish roast. medium carbonation, almost syrup-like mouthfeel. tons of flavor. founders hit a BIG fucking home-run with this beer. one of the best beers I've ever had."
"O/D-This far exceeded my expectations. I usually don't love Scotch Ales, but this one is delicious. Looks like I need to buy a four pack instead of just a single. $4.15 for a bottle is pricey but its worth it. This is a gem. Founders is among the best."
"O: Overall this beer is pretty damn awesome. I would like to see some more bourbon bite on this one but it's still damn good. Another superior offering from Founders! 4.5"
"O: A delicious, malty Bastard expertly aged in oak bourbon barrels. Comes off smooth and easy drinking for 10.2%. Although there's a slight hint of booze it seems rather pleasant. This is the best Wee Heavy around, hands down!"
"-JH-"
"UPDATE:!!! Pouring a 2011 and a 2012 next to each other and seeing the differences. Looking at appearance my 11 is slightly lighter then the 12 which is much darker this year. The smell on the 11 has definitely mellowed out over the year and the 12 has the same wonderful smell that I imagine. Let's taste... Wow the 11 has really mellowed out and became extremely smooth. You can taste the difference in the two from the get go. The year of age really benefits this beer though the 12 is still the amazing beer that I remember. It shows the alcohol much more and has slightly more of the bourbon burn. The 11 is now super smooth and easy going alcohol presence has lessened but I'm sure that the overall abv has hopefully increase with age. Mouthfeel on the 11 is amazingly creamy while 12 has the nice bourbon feel and fresh beer carbonation. Can't wait to put the 11 next to the 12 and 13 next year lol :)"
"Overall: I like my wee heavy/scotch ales, but this is comparable to a Ola Dubh 30 year reserve by Harviestoun which I enjoyed very much. I have to say I like this brew a little better. I wish it was not a year round release, but I will hunt for when it is in season I suggest give it a try. If you like scotch ales this one is superb."
"This is the first offering I've tried from Founders and I'm an instant fan. Anyone that can make a beer like this knows what they're doing. Plain & Simple. With all that's great about this beer there are two things about it that make me sad; 1) It's only released once a year and 2) I don't have a fireplace to sit in front of (in a rocking chair of course) while sipping this wonderful drink. And at 10.2%, sipping may be the way to enjoy it."
"O: This beer is absolutely blowing my mind now. It's very complex with a fruity vanilla bourbon character. As a bourbon drinker this is very familiar to me and this is the best scotch ale I've ever had making me warm and tingly with each sip."
"Overall- Wow. As a bourbon and scotch enthusiast, this was right up my alley. A sipper for sure, but dangerously sippable at that. Another great brew from Founders, one of the greatest breweries in the country."
"This is a heavy bodied beer but its easy drinking. Its definitely a sipper but its dangerously drinkable. Its very smooth and creamy. Great beer glad I have a few more to see how they age."
"Overall I enjoyed it, just as I've enjoyed everything from Founder's. Really a wonderful brewery but I don't need to tell you that. Pick some up and try it!"
"It should be noted that the price, $18 for a four-pack, was the going rate for this brew in most places locally. I had designs on buying a case if I could find one, but at that price, it's a tough sell. I adore this beer, but in the end, it's just beer."
"Insanely drinkable and very smooth. Mouthfeel, as mentioned, is a little thin, but the taste here will keep you distracted from that."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. The bourbon barrel comes through a lot, but it is not too overpowering so you can still taste the complexities of the grain bill."
"O: Much better than last year (but I may have had a bad batch). On par with 2009. One of my favorite beers."
"Overall: Another solid addition to Founders' bourbon line. Damn, those guys know how to work with barrels! This is a worthy altering of the already solid Dirty Bastard and I would love to have this whenever possible. Really solid brew, and its nice to see something other than a stout and barleywine as the vehicle of bourbon in beer."
"O- You know, there is a lot of alcohol in this beer, and its prevalent. Its not necessarily a bad thing as it plays really well with the whole bourbon characteristic. The flavors are nice, soft oak, syrup, and earth. They come together to make a really really nice flavor as a whole, but i can't bring myself to give this beer a straight A/A+ just based on the alcohol content and the hype around it. Its a great sipping beer for a cool fall night, and those who like bourbon and/or scotch ales will find nirvana in this beer, but for me, its just very good."
"Pours a dark brown color w/ a one finger cocoa head that quickly disappears. Good carbonation, and somewhat weak lacing on the glass. Smell is oak, vanilla, malt, alcohol. A little on the thin side for me- and warming doesn't help much. Not as complex as I would think for a beer w/ this pedigree. Taste is the same- good, but not great. Something's missing here. It just doesn't have the depth of flavor or complexity that I would expect from a Founder's brew. Still, it's good. Mouthfeel is a disappointment. Very thin and carbonated feel. Too thin to be honest. Overall, this is a decent brew, but fell short of what I had hoped for."
"This is a beer that packs a hefty bourbon punch, but also blends almost seamlessly with the wee heavy base. This is a brew that would probably benefit from a few years of aging."
"O - a real winner, definitely need to find as many as I can to hoard. Another awesome brew from Founders."
"O: Fantastic beer. I'm going to go purchase some more, can't believe this is the first time I've ever tried it! Definitely tasty right now but I'm very interested in what a little aging will do to this beer."
"Mouthfeel is fullish and somewhat creamy/syrupy yet not cloying in flavor. The sweet upfront taste followed by a dry finish turns me off slightly. The carbonation is very fine and lightens the body a bit. I like this beer, but one at a time is enough to satisfy. I would love to age a bottle for 3 years and revisit... if not, I'll pass on it fresh."
"Overall impression: Lighter weight cousin to KBS. Excellent Beer. I'm gonna stop reviewing and enjoy the rest of it."
"O: Strong and boozy, but enjoyable."
"Knockout-- completely nails it."
"Very enoyable beer."
"O: Quality stuff. very balanced. Some heavy oak aged beers are way too sweet. This beer is just about spot on."
"Overall, a very good beer. It's nice to find a bourbon barrel aged beer that isn't all bourbon. This beer balances a very good base beer with the addition of the barrel aging. The scotch ale flavor is complex and the boubon barrel aging only adds to that complexity. This is a very smooth beer, highly recommended."
"O: I've never been a big fan of ""Dirty Bastard."" Witness the power of bourbon barrel-ageing!"
"Overall: Great beer, glad I finally got to try it and would love to have a couple to keep around for a while."
"I will look fo it in the bottle this year!!"
"O-very very good beer"
"O - such a great style. So old and perfect for a chilly night."
"Pours a dark brown, oaken color that is very nearly opaque. A small, thin layer of tan head develops, bud dissipates quickly. Small patches of wet lacing are left as the beer diminishes. Smells of bourbon, caramel, some toffee, a touch of vanilla, oak, and some dark, sugary fruit (cherries, date). Tastes of caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and the same dark fruits. Very well balanced and palatable. The alcohol is almost completely hidden, only noticeably by a warming exhale. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, and it finishes a touch dry. Overall, a spectacular brew that I could easily sip on all evening. It pains me that I don't have regular access to this."
"edit: upping my score on taste after sampling the current (2011) batch. the bourbon seems more well blended for a smoother and tastier overall flavor. fantastic beer."
"O - Excellent offering from Founders, and a great take on an already awesome beer (Dirty Bastard)!"
"Another excellent bourbon beer from Founders!"
"Overall: This is a tasty beer, no doubt. With almost a year on it, it's a pleasantly (for the most part) boozy cold-weather-appropriate sipper that's stays relatively close to the British style of Wee Heavy. Yet, for about $12 a 4-pk, it doesn't have quite the depth or complexity I'd need for it to become a regular seasonal purchase."
"Smells like smoke, tea, a little caramel, light oak , and savory spice. Taste is the same with some earthy hops added. Not very boozy and I can still taste base beer. The 2010 vintage I aged for a year was boozier than this fresh one. Would probably give this a B/B+"
"Medium to full bodied, firm, and a bit drying."
"Founder's take on the Wee Heavy is one of my favorites. It maintains the Scottish character but the added complexity of the oak bourbon barrel aging really sets this beer apart."
"Overall another solid offering from Founders. In the future I would love to see this in a 750ml bottle."
"O- This is a big beer, really enjoyed the big bourbon flavors, not over powering but really balanced, really impressed."
"This bottle poured out as a light muddy brown color with a soft creamy looking head on top. The lacing is thin but sticks nicely. The smell of booze, maple, some fennel, malts and wood all flood out of this beer. The taste is sweet with some light vanilla flavors, sweet malts, a light amount of bourbon and some earth in there too. The mouthfeel has some soft bubbles and a smooth creamy feel in the mouth. Overall I am very glad I finally got to try this one. I had wanted to give it a shot for a while and I did my best to enjoy each sip of this. This beer is great but isn't my favorite from Founder's."
"my very last 2010...poured into my over-sized snifter..pours a translucent mohagony body with almost no head,minimal lacing denotes the booze presence...and wow...are you greated in the nose with bourbon..but it is every pleasent aroma that bourbon has to offer,mixed with a nice malty backbone..honestly a truely exceptional nose..the taste is great..just what you would expect out of a good wee heavy, but with a nice bourbon presence...a bit boozy on the back end though..and the aint so bad...a nice mouthfeel to a wonderful beer..."
" Overall this is another badass beer from Founders,easily my Favorite brewery. I definately recommend this beer,a must try!"
"O- Great beer from Founders again! You get the initial flavors of dirty bastard and then the perfect blend of oak, vanilla, and bourbon finish off the beer perfectly. A must try!"
"Drink: As it’s a 10.2% ABV, it’s a sipper, but it surprised me with how easily drinking it was. This would be a great beer to enjoy during the colder winter months given that warming alcohol taste."
"O - More and more, this is becoming a favorite of mine. Really like how the barrel integrates into the base beer and comes out a winner. Thanks Mike!"
"Not to bad considering this is not really a style that Ive ever much enjoyed."
"Overall, a really nice bourbon barrel aged scotch ale. The booze is a bit heavy in the nose, but it blends well in the taste. A nice, complex and warming sipper. Definitely recommended."
"Was fortunate enough to get a bottle from a friend. This beer is absolutely incredible...very smooth taste, definitely can tell it was aged in Oak Barrels. If you aren't a fan of the oak aged beers, then this one might not be for you...but this beer is no joke...some bite of whiskey on the front end, but smooths right out. I think one is enough for drinking one of these...I wish I had several more!!"
"O- This is a nice brew, not as stunning as I remembered it, but nevertheless it's a beer to take your time with and appreciate."
"Illegitimate or not, Backwoods Bastard is a glorious wee heavy, showcasing a smooth and surprisingly drinkable blend of beer and barrel. It’s great now, but the flavors may yet be able to develop more — good thing I have a bottle from 2009 nestled away."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good, I feel it could be a little more carbonated, but the mouthfeel compliments the flavor profile pretty well. Ratio is in favor of the malts but a good ratio/balance, slight tingle on the tongue from the alcohol. Pretty darn drinkable, perfect after dinner drink or nightcap. Not typical to the style, but I love what Founders is doing here, knocked it out of the park."
"This beer is expensive but well worth it. It has an excellent brown body with amber tone. There is average head but the lace has a lot of staying power. It has strong aroma of bourbon roasted malt it is very rich. It has candy and bourbon flavor with wood, caramel and some vanilla esters. The mouthfeel is medium with some burn. A very good desert or night cap beer"
"mouthfeel - medium body with light carbonation, pretty drinkable but the alcohol was too much on a hot day in texas. so im sure id give it higher had it been winter"
"Overall I remember having this fresh and almost gagging but after about 8 months possibly at the most a year (if you want to age it) it's about as good as it will get. Very tasty bourbon beer that's worth the $4.50 price tag (especially considering some can't even find this right now) At the most one a sitting since the bourbon goes right to your head"
"O: Great brew by Founder's. I am going to keep this on my radar so that I can buy some and throw them in the cellar next time."
"Has tastes of yeast, oak, fudged corn, corn, booze, malt, tang, Nesquik and vinegar. Had this several times now and liked each time a little better/a little more, than when I had previously. Good stuff. I want some more, alas I can't get Founders here ."
"O - A solid barrel aged beer. I actually liked both versions equally. I liked the strong bourbon flavour in the fresh one (only cuz I love bourbon) but it was very alcohol-hot. And I like the 2009 because it had mellowed out and allowed the oakiness and vanilla to shine through, but less bourbon flavour. Great beer!"
"Loved it! I am thinking I need more of this to share with my buddy who frequents his bourbon bottle as a nightcap."
"Overall this was an excellent bonus. Thanks to prototypic for this gem. I loved every sip of this beer. This beer had the right amount of sweetness and some serious boozy notes. Bottom line: if you cant take the heat get out of the kitchen son. This beer will eat your lunch!!!"
"I have long been critical of over-barreled beers, and I imagine in previous years, or exceptionally fresh, that this beer could suffer from the traits it plays with here, but pulls off. I've had several over the last few months, and it's a beer that I'd always be glad to dust off from the cellar and pour into a snifter or tulip and nurse as the evening's cool settles in."
"Overall - Smooth and delicious."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer has a rather thick mouthfeel. It is easily drinkable despite its slight stickiness."
"Pours a murky dark brown color with a 1 inch light beige head that fades to a thin cap. Rings upon rings upon rings of lace on the drink down. Very nice looking lacing with this beer. Smells of toasted coconut, some wood, alcohol, and malt. Taste has the toasted coconut, slight wood flavors, some vanilla, and malts. I am not really getting any stand out bourbon alcohol smells or tastes from this beer. Low carbonation with a thick and chewy mouthfeel. Slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat after each sip. Overall, this is a pretty taste beer with some nice toasted coconut qualities (I love coconut). I could probably only handle one of these at a time though."
"D-Overall it was not the wee heavy scotch ale i was hoping for. Def. a good brew but just alittle too dry and boozy for me. I wanted a tab bit more sweet and refreshing. But still a good beer. Would drink again. But i think their are better wee heavy's"
"Overall: Another great offering from founders! i am going to let a few bottle sit for a while and this beer should be perfect. Still a bit hot, but delicious. Reminds me of Tyranena BGW Shaggin in the Woods, but heavier."
"O: Very enjoyable. Look forward to getting my hands on more of this one. Easy to drink, especially for a scotch ale which I usually find very hot."
"overall - great beer. i like this one alot. warm, complex, a sipper. better with a year or two on it."
"Cheers!"
"Glad I chose a snifter. This one warms up nicely to bring out the notes from the nose and it's definitely a one-and-done! Big!"
"O - Another fantastic barrel-aged brew from Founders. Wish I would have bought more."
"O: Great for a strong ale. The only negative for me is just little to strong on the Bourbon. Enjoy the subtle oak notes though."
"O - I like this a lot! This would be a perfect cold weather sipper. A very high quality complex brew, once again, from Founders."
"O: alcohol incredibly well-hidden. Not at all the tast profile I anticipated but certainly enjoyable. For the price (at least in my area), this will not be a yearly must-have but I will no doubt enjoy this beer another time or two."
"D: This is not a beer for the average beer drinker. This is a gnarly beer, very strong bourbon presence and the 10.2% does not go unnoticed, definitely a sipper. However, if you like bourbon and aggressive beers then give this one a try."
"D-Too much bourbon flavor to make this one more than a sipper for me. Bourbon whiskey lovers will like this one."
"Beer is too overloaded to be enjoyed as more then a novelty."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium thick and the finish is full. This beer is almost too much. There is no balance in the beer, it has too much booze in the beer. The beer needs to age for a couple of years to mellow it out. The beer is just too strong to drink, it is a sipper."
"D-I enjoy this beer each time I have it...this years vintage is no exception. I can put down mulitples on this."
"Loved this beer, will definitely look to buy again. Is very much a sipper and I look forward to finishing this glass."
"Rarely am I given the chance to rate a beer so highly. This is so far beyond any other American Scotch ale, it is the standard for American beers in this style. Bourbon to the fore! Add to that the gentle aroma of citrus with a heavy malty tang; a dense taste of orange peels, lemons, rope, cocoa, butter, oak, new leather shoes... is there anything *not* to envy in this beer? This can go head to head with any UK Scotch ale. Best enjoyed in a snifter or a thistle while playing the piano, or on one's front porch on an almost-spring New England afternoon. An incredible beer by any standard."
"I'm surly bumbed this is gone. Rudy reddish brown and opaque in the glass. Light tanish head which leaves sheets of lacing down the glass. Aroma is slightly one dimisional and whiskey based. Not much wood or oak, just high spirit aroma, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. My taste buds tingle with tasty brown sugar, sweet vanilla, creme brulee, cheap whiskey, and faint oak notes. This beer reminds me of liquid bread pudding. Somehow it isn't cloying, but there is a lingering flavor. silky. I'd say damn, wish I had more of this. Founders truly knows what they are doing with bal aged beers."
"looking forward to trying it again someday."
"O - Definitely a sipper, but this is one that just comes together right. It would be better with less booziness on the initial hit, but that seemed to go away as it warmed and I got further into the glass."
"So the verdict is that this isn't a favorite beer from Founders for me. Not a big deal, they make plenty other good ones."
"Creamy and full. Nice and smooth with soft carbonation. A great beer here. Founders really hit the mark on this one. Really one of the finer examples of this style."
"D (seems to be O now): The bourbon booziness and sweetness is detracting from the drinkability for me. Scotch ales are not my favorite style to start with and I love bourbon barrel aged beers, so I might just be having a hard time not separating these tastes. This is an absolute sipper that I really needed to take my time with."
"This beer pours a dark caramel to light brown color with a decent off white head. the smell is bourbon up front with toffee and vanilla notes swirling around in there too. the flavor is pretty similar to the smell with the bourbon being apparent immediately and then the sweet caramelized malts, followed by some hints of oak and vanilla. The mouthfeel is full and sweet and overall this is a very good beer, definitely one of my favorite scotch ales."
"This is a definate sipper and not a liter mug guzzler."
"Its` smell is quite nice, with some vanilla, bourbon, and dark roasted malts. Taking a sip of BB, I get some oak, scotch, a little chocolate. MF is medium-heavy, a bit rich. All in all, this is a very nice scotch ale. I continue to be happy from my Founders purchases when I am traveling to/through nearby states (live in CT)."
"O/D: good flavor and is overall not your typical scottish ale but thats not a bad thing."
"O - Glad I got this one, this was appropriate as a long slow sipper. The hoppiness surprised me, but this was a well made beer."
"the CPJ"
"Drinkability - This beer is very, very nice. Lots of kick and a wonderful aroma, taste and mouthfeel. Most definitely a beer for sipping. The alcohol is prevelant, but it is surprisingly not distracting. It's noticeable in the mouthfeel, but it's not unbearable. After one of these I would more than likely be done. Not from lack of enjoyment, but lack of alcohol tolerance."
"very dark amber color with white head. smell is off sweet cherries and strong bourbon. taste is similar although bourbon is more forward and dark fruit taste is more nondescript than the specific cherry flavor in the smell. also strong malt flavor. medium bodied. I enjoyed this one more than it's brother beer, Dirty Bastard. The bourbon adds a nice complexity I enjoy far more than the straight malt in Dirty Bastard."
"D- This is a sipping beer and meant to be slowly appreciated. Great brew overall !"
"D: Mmmm! Strong, but I want another and would buy a 22 oz. or a 6-pack maybe (if it came as such, a 4-pack if in that)."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink although I can't see myself having more than one of these in a sitting."
"m/d - if given the chance to get this on tap I would jump at the chance. I really love this beer and have enjoyed many a bottle, but the freshness from the growler/tap pour does wonders for this beer. founders doesn't make a bad beer, but this is one of the highlights of their catalog."
"Overall: Although the mouthfeel is a little thin for a Wee Heavy with this level of ABV, the nicely balanced flavor profile makes up for it"
"Founders does not make a bad beer. The do just about everything right in any style they try."
"This is my new favorite beer...like I got a single from Duffextracold and I'm now going out buy a case favorite beer. Whereas I could see where this beer could be much better (I'd love to see some of the scotch ale actually poke through) I love the extreme bourbon. I'm a huge bourbon fan but can' stomach too much alcohol...I think I just found the solution."
"Overall, I would love to have this on hand all the time, just a great beer to smell, sip, and enjoy. After having this both fresh and with age, I actually prefer it fresh though, but it was still good with age, but the toffee notes which I love faded a bit. Kudos to Founders, well crafted."
"Overall, an absolutely delicious beer, even if it's not pretty. Definitely the best Scotch ale I've had to date. The oak and bourbon flavors are definitely present and unmistakable, but very well balanced with the other flavors of the beer."
"A very nicely done beer by Founder's. The bourbon barrel certainly takes center stage on this one so if you don't like bourbon, this may not be a good one for you. I thought it went down very easy and wouldn't mind having this again."
"D: this is a delight to drink, im not the biggest fan of scotch ales, but this is impressive, I bought 2 bottle to have one now and save the other for later the other bottle didn't last a month well done"
"D: Surprisingly well balanced. The caramel sweetness of the scotch ale blends well with the bourbon and vanilla notes. Overall solid beer."
"2013 Edit, after trying this beer several more times both aged and not aged i have changed my score accordingly."
"I remain endlessly curious as to what age will do to my other bottles. Good stuff. This year's Backwoods and Breakfast Stout releases confirm for me that Founders is consistent."
"D- Definately a sipper; this is a cool weather brew that takes a while to consume, sip by sip. You won't drink more than one or two of these in a sitting, unless you're a huge bourbon fan."
"It IS delicious though and my only complaint is a slightly dry, phenolic finish. I'm not grabbing this when I want a Scotch Ale, but it's a wonderful sipper when you want that Bourbon feel but don't want the heaviness of a stout."
"A sipper, but every enjoyable. Try."
"D- really hides the alcohol at first, but after it sits in the gut for a bit you get the warmth. overall, not the best Wee Heavy I've ever had, but still a decent beer. I'd drink it again"
"Great for cold weather - probably only one in a sitting."
"Poured from the bottle a dark amber copper with a soft tannish head that disapated quickly. The nose was dominated by oak and burbon lots of it but under it you could smell smoke bready malt and light wisp of alcohol. Taste is big and bold burbon vanilla oak and bready malt hit you big upfront big on the burbon, the taste finishes dry and warm with a nice alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is thin and quick very light on the carbonatio as would be expected from an aged beer. Drinkability is marked as be careful, good brew but strong and dangerous!"
"Very nice beer !!"
"Backwoods smells of bourbon, toasted vanilla, sweet toffee, and roasted dark malts. Tastes of caramel-y malts balanced by bitter smoke and all pulled together by bourbon deliciousness. Long smoky finish, similar to burned marshmallows. Mouthfeel is a bit warm from the 10.2% ABV. Definitely a slow sipper."
"On to the Wants you will go!"
"This is a wonderful barrel aged beer. Highly addicting flavor, but the booziness assures you cannot manage more than a sip at a time."
"D: Very drinkable due to the high ABV. This is one that I can say I would highly recommend and will be getting for myself again!"
"Loved it, bourbon amount is perfect in this beer. Sweet but well attenuated with enough bitterness and alcohol to counter the sweetness."
"D - Fairly drinkable. Knocking in at a relatively high 10.20 % abv, this is a fairly heavy beer and is best sipped. That being said, the booze flavors stay in check for high level and the flavor is just amazingly well balanced and complex. Excellent beer."
"This beer pours a hazy plum-maroon color with little to no white head doing anything but lacing on the surface. The aroma is a lot of malts hanging out together and having a party in this glass. There is an overwhelmingly sweet aroma coming off of the nose of this beer. This beer truly is a bastard because I really can't figure out all of the flavors it's really trying to go for. The short answer is that I like it, but I don't know why. I believe that there is a definite whiskey kick to this beer that is more prevalent in the back of the palate. There might even be a touch of smoked malts used. It's a true malt bomb in every sense of the word. It's got a really decent mouthfeel, but is almost too sweet and strong to easily take down without a lot of time on your hands."
"Drinkability - I have been spacing my beers out tonight so I wouldn't be too ""tipsy"" to review them, and I can honestly say for the ABV I have no taste of alcohol nor warming. This is a very rich beer, though one I am thoroughly enjoying. As has been shown, sensory feelings (i.e. taste or smell) are very strong, and this beer for some reason brings me back to happy childhood memories, which makes it all the better. A very solid brew."
"I'm not a bourbon person, so this was a miss for me. But it's a nice foray into malt-forward and -bal side of experimental brews as opposed to massive IPAs or sours."
"Pours a ruddy amber with iridescent orange hues; no real head to speak of, some descent but oily looking lacing. I can smell the bourbon bomb from an arms length, so this should be interesting. Upon closer inspection with my nose I detect vanilla and cola, slight oak, and thats about it. Taste is upfront bourbon. Wow. Ok, this is too much for me, but I'll try to judge it fairly based on merit. Vanilla, cola, bourbon, some slight char somewhere in there, but damn, this is like a bourbon cut with a lager, there ain't much else than that. I know others love that sort of thing, but there is no balance there for me. Carbonation is medium and the mouthfeel is thin; body is dry, like a bourbon heavy mixer with coke. I'm giving this an average score, as nothing really stands out in this for me aside from the bourbon."
"Overall, I like the effort Founders masters put towards this one. not exactly my cup of tea/bourbon, but enjoyed for the time."
"Drinkability: This is my first Founders Brewing Co. beer, and I feel like I started on top with this particular one! I could drink this all the time and anytime. Just sad that this was my only one. If your ever in eyesight of ""Backwoods Bastard", run, don't walk to it and grab as many as you can...this bastard can attest to it!!!"
"Deep, dark garnet brown color with an incredibly thin head. The aroma is sweet malty, and smoky. The taste is comparable to bourbon with tinges of oak, smoke and sweet vanilla. The mouthfeel is a little thin. The lack of carbonation is noticeable with each sip. The beer is a little boozy and it has some heat to it. To me, that affects the drinkability. It's definitely a sipper"
"D - Awesome drinkability. It is sort of a sipper, but I can hardly keep from drinking this quickly. The flavor is great and it is very smooth. I think this is a great beer and will definitely be trying it again. I highly recommend."
"I had this at the Founders tasting at Big Hunt in DC in November 2010. It was poured into a small glass and never really had much head, but it did show some lacing. If you swished it around in the glass the head would appear briefly. The smell was sweet with a hint of raisins and buttery whiskey. The flavour was malty yumminess with a vanilla buttery finish. The alcohol is quite noticeable in the aftertaste. It tasted like acidic Jameson to me: like Jameson and coke. That might not sounds like high praise, but I really like Jameson and coke... so yeah. This beer tasted a lot like whiskey barrel and not much like beer. Really nice and really unusual, but I don't think the aging process improved this over the regular Dirty Bastard Ale."
"D: Very well integrated and balanced flavors. Not too sweet, not too hot, not too bourbony. I wouldn't want to drink this very often, but this hits the spot when you're in the mood for something rich and malty."
"Drinkability is good for 10.2% barrel-aged scotch ale. Sweet and boozy, but there is some nice bitterness that evens things out. One bottle is enough for me, but quite enjoyable on a cold night. I like this just a touch more than the non-barreled offering. As usual, Founders brews tasty beers."
"Overall this is perhaps my favorite Scotch ale to date."
"D- It's a delicious brew that needs to be savored one of the best if not the best scotch ales Ive had."
"O - It's not a standard scotch ale, but it's an excellent beer that is better than the score indicates. I'd buy it again if it was available here."
"I really enjoy this except for a split second on the finish. A non heavy handed barrel aged that displays mostly the bourbon but very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Love this beer...might be gay for this beer..not sure. Either way, this is one that your should certainly seek out/trade for. Thanks to Jeff and Jarrod...two awesome IL BAs."
"D: If I could get this in stores more than once a year I would! Great beer to age! I have 3 left and looking forward to how these develop over time."
"D: I enjoy drinking this beer, but given the 10.2% ABV and the bold flavors, one is enough."
"D - Way too powerful to rush through. It's a beer that should be enjoyed slowly, but it carries such a punch that you really don't have a choice."
"Beer pours a deep mahogany color, tiny head quickly recedes, hazy, vary little carbonation. Looks delicious, excited to dive in. Smells very very boozy, bourbon, oak flavor. Some malty notes as well as vanilla and resiny - smells like it's going to be a strong one! WHOA! The taste blows me away! DELICIOUS! Super sweet. Malty, vanillay, maybe some raisin notes. Very smooth delicious, full bodied and no burn. Such an incredible mouth feel. INSANE drinkability. Will be seeking out this beer again!"
"Drinkability: I feel that I often overlook this beer from Founders with KBS and CBS, but this is a very enjoyable and complex beer that I really do enjoy."
"A truly solid beer, very likable. Drinkability suffers somewhat due to the price and availability, not to mention the abv. I look forward to the release next year."
"D: I wasn't really aware this was supposed to be a Scotch ale when I bought it. It's not really like any Scotch ale I've ever had (Scotch strong w/ bourbon?). But it was overall excellent and one of Founder's better efforts."
"D - It's hard to put down. This is a very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"final note: if you like the taste and the aroma of scotch this beer is perfect."
"D: The Bourbon does not take control of this, like I've experienced before with other barrel aged beers, and it finishes quite smooth."
"I poured this average brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a strong tea colored affair. The head was non-existent with only a slight tan few bubbles on top. The beer had a slight sour smell but was very carbonated feeling in the mouth. I will not buy this one again."
"This beer pours a maple syrupy, thick mahogany with reddish highlights. It is really thick. The smell is of sweet maple and bourbon, that's about it. The flavor is sweet maple, bourbon, and a lot of alcohol. The alcohol is very present in both the taste and after taste. Somehow that doesn't matter. It's still a great Scotch ale. It drinks exceptionally smooth and coats both the glass and the palate. The only thing holding back the drinkability is the ever present bourbon. Very good beer."
"D--This a boozy brew, and if you are not into bourbon aged beer, dont bother. This is a great beer, a truly exceptional brew by an incredible brewery."
"This is a difficult beer to rate for me because I do like some things about it but it doesn't have any characteristics of a scotch ale. Tastes like a decent bourbon barrel ""something", just not a decent bourbon barrel aged scotch ale."
"although a bit of bourbon flavor, there is no booziness or alcohol burn. great to sip, very tasty"
"Drinkability: Okay, so I know for the regular beer drinker this may be way too strong, but as far as barrel-aged goes, I find this one to be highly drinkable. It really doesn't give off a heavy booziness unlike some other offerings, which is nice. If I could only drink one barrel-aged beer this might very well be it. Great job!"
"This is a very nice enjoyable beer to be enjoyed at a slow pace, the sweetness dies down as the beer reaches room temperature making it a little more enjoyable to me. Great job Founders."
"D-high ABV? i think not. the taste is amazing and it stays so well. there is no alcohol note whatsoever. i loved this beer and i hope to have a lot more of it!"
"D - This beast qualifies as a nice a slow sipper. High abv and bourbon foward make this one to seek out for those who love bal-aged beers. Very good and well crafted makes this one worth revisiting again."
"D: I think I just don't much care for bourbon-barrel aged beers. This beer has a lot of interesting things going on, but it's just ""not for me"". A little boozier than I'd like, but it's really that overwhelming bourbon-sweetness that turns me off here. And at 10.2%, you probably wouldn't want to pound several of these in a given night even if you liked it."
"Good. The impression of Scotch whisky is very well done."
" ~ For a beer with an ABV over 10% the alcohol is caped very well. The complexity of the characters in this beer make it one that I wish I had more of to enjoy. Overall this is a very good beer and one you should certainly get your hand on."
"Really enjoy this beer! I feel that it will be better with a little age; the alcohol will have a chance to balance out. The finish could be a little longer. For a sipper I wish this beer displayed a little more complexity as it warms."
"Backwoods Bastard is a very enjoyable beer. It simultaneously gives a tutorial as to why people age beer in bourbon barrels, and a benchmark against which one can measure the success of other barrel aged beers. Worth the large pricetag (around $15~ per 4pack if I'm not mistaken)."
" The flavor of the Scotch ale is strong and rich with a toffee quality w/ pine from the hops and lots of vanilla from the barrel. The taste is nutty with earthy flavor and mild woody taste like a vanilla toffee spice with a moderately strong bourbon flavor. There is a bitter presence that dominates w/ a caramel candy and bitter presence w/ more sweetness evident in the taste as it warms. I was overjoyed when Mike offered this growler to me -A wonderful oak and bourbon element presents itself so well w/ lots of roasted and candy-like notes yet strength is high in the flavor and feel. It fits the style well and has exceptional drinkability in my opinion. I was truly grateful for the gift -I almost drank a whole growler save for 2 pints."
"Conclusion: one of my favorite beers"
"Smooth and thick, this is pleasant to drink. The alcohol is clearly there, but not overwhelming."
"An excellent winter warmer that is good from start to finish!"
"Maybe I'm a lightweight low abv smooth drinking bastards. Not from the backwoods. Still well made though. Can never deny Founders that. Cheers!"
"This is an all-time favorite! I just wish it wasn't a once-a-year release!"
"Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Really enjoyed it. The flavors tracked the initial nose, not the later more alcoholic aromatic shift. Got hints of coconut as well as toffee, oak and scotch. Bourbon element was nicely balanced, not overpowering as in some ales (though I really like good bourbon). Nice medium/heavy volume. Extremely drinkable, though you would not want several in a row. Nice for sipping."
"This is still a must try, come on now, it's Founders!"
"An interesting stab at an oak-aged Scotch ale. It seems, though, that the bourbon character overwhelms the other flavors (and aromas) at times. It's still very good; I'd just like a little more Scotch ale flavor to come through. Recommended, but steer clear if you don't like bourbon."
"I bought one 4'er and then immediately bought 3 more, with the intent of aging some. So, I guess you can imagine how I feel about it."
"After having Dirty Bastard I didn't think this one would be this good, but this is exquisite."
"D - Off the charts. Probably the smoothest Wee Heavy I've had. The barrel aging in this beauty was masterfully crafted. I highly recommend getting your hands on some of this goodness!"
"Backwoods Bastard is some damn yummy stuff! Founders astounds with this one. If there is a bastard who lives in the backwoods somewhere in Michigan, probably the U.P., this would be what's for breakfast."
"Drink- I have one. I want more."
"Drinkability: I could probably drink two of these in a row before I felt compelled to call it a night. This is a big beer and it drinks like a dessert. The boozy fumes are powerful but not overwhelming. Definitely one to sip and enjoy the nuances and subtleties."
"This beer is not for your everyday beer drinker...This beer pours like the red seas...And the aroma of this beer opens up the bourbon barrel. the first sip is a full mouth of delight.But the way it makes you feel is the best.It is to bad thiss beer is very limited...thank-you Founder"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and smooth drinking without a lot of carbonation. Very nice. Despite The nice flavors and feel of this beer, I find it very hard to put more than one down at a time. The scotch flavor and maltiness is great for one beer, but overstays its welcome after that."
"Pours a dark ruby with a pinky's worth  of light tan head.  Smells smokey, malty and boozy, a lot of smokiness.  Tastes pretty much exactly like it smells, boozy, oaky and smoky. Damn good beer! Mouthfeel is good, low carbonation, but thick enough, and drinkability is high, at least for me it is. An outstanding beer, but if smoke flavor isn't your thing, avoid this brew."
"Pours a very dark carmel color, can still see through the glass. Very little head but a bit more carbonation that expected. The smell is bourbon and alcohol, some sweetness to the nose. The flavor has maple syrup and vanilla notes with a good dose afftertaste bitterness. Mouthefeel is a bit thin for me. I'm not sure I could get through another one of these at %10, but it's a great 12oz. after dinner beer."
"D: This beer is quite hard to get through as a bottle, its tasty but gets a little old as you go through it. this is a 12oz to share for sure."
"D: For the 10% ABV, this one goes down suprisingly easy. While it is definitely an excellent beer, I'm not sure if I could see myself drinking more than one of these in a night, the molasses gets a little tiring."
"D: After dinner drink, or one or two with a book when its cold outside."
"D: Very drinkable, despite the ABV. A great brew to sit back and finish off the weekend with. I only tried 1/4 from the pack, as I am interested to see how it cellars."
"D - If you like bourbon barrel brews, you'll fall in love with this as soon as you pry the cap off the bottle. You do have to appreciate bourbon to be able to drink more than one in a sitting though. All in all, Founders did not let me down here. This is a very solid brew and well worth the try."
"D: Oh yeah."
"O - good example of the style."
"D - Could drink something that tastes like this all day, but the syrup is and alcohol are a little over-powering, need to switch to something else after this."
"Pours a ho-hum murky brown color with a rather small head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of brown sugar, vanilla, some sour oak and some sweet bourbon. Pretty much all bourbon barrel in the nose, but it does smell quite nice. Very much like the aroma, the taste is dominated by the bourbon barrel. I like to see a sturdy malt and some smoke or wood flavors in a scotch ale but this doesn't seem to have it. It does have a very tasty bourbon flavor with good vanilla and sour oak flavors to go along with the bourbon flavor. The malt bring some brown sugar flavor and perhaps the lightest touch of peat. The feel is light with tingly carbonation; finishes quite sweet and a bit sticky, not cloying for a 12oz bottle. There is some boozy vapors going on. This is a very tasty brew due to the bourbon barrel aging and I scored it as such. However I would like to see more of the malt pop through especially for a 10.5ABV brew. If you are going to make it that boozy, beef up the malt. If you like the taste of bourbon is a light body this is for you. I like this beer don't get me wrong just needs to be a tad thicker."
"Drinkability is stratospheric!"
"D: This has a delicious bourbon taste but it would be better if it incorporated more of the scotch flavors of Dirty Bastard."
"D= A lot of people like this beer but I just don't like it at all hard to get through IMO. I have a few bottles left I'll gift them and probably won't try this one again."
"D: At 10.2%, the drinkability is astounding. With the smell I assumed the beer's scotch taste would be overpowering but it is actually more subtle than I thought, making the beer much more enjoyable. I could absolutely have a lot of these in one sitting, which is dangerous at 10.2%. I recommend this beer to any fans of the style, or to anyone who simply enjoys good beer."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied. Overall I really like this beer. While very easy to drink considering its abv, I prefer to sip and savor it. Very complex, with a lot of flavor."
"P.S.: Can't stop drinking this! A true treat. Enjoy!"
"D- This is a heavy one, but the initial flavor is just so good. A nice sipper on a cold night, very tasty"
"D: The high abv of this Bastard is the only thing stopping me from drinking the whole four pack at once. Its incredibly tasty and is everything I expect from a bourbon barrel aged ale. I hope you hate this beer so there is more of this limited release for me."
"I've heard it gets much better with age, so the rest of the four pack is going into the beer fridge, but I am sorely disappointed as I tried hard to find this four-pack."
"D-Drinkable but you must like bourbon barrel aged beers. I tried to drink this slow but i found it to have a somewhat addictive quality."
"D - I've got to say, I love bourbon, but this is like the bourbon barrel aged beer for the person who doesn't love a heavy dose of bourbon. The bourbon sweetness is highlighted, while keeping the alcohol heat at bay (though there is a bourbon aftertaste). Because of this, this was a beer I began sipping, but couldn't stay away for long."
"I had no problem polishing off a bottle - at this abv it's probably best to leave it at one 'though."
"D- The alcohol doesn't burn, but it just tastes awful. Truly, truly, gross fora finish. If I could capture the first moments and let them last I'd find this to be a good beer. Unfortunately, that is not the fact. This 10% tastes more like a 20% or worse. I'm forced to drink it further as I hit the middle of the bottle."
"I love this beer, the bourbon, vanilla flavors are awsome. So far, ive been nothing but impressed with what founders has to offer. I will buy whatever these guys have to offer. A bit boozy, but this is what i love from barrel aged beers. Can't wait until next years version of this, i'll age at least one until then maybe more."
"I'm splitting this bottle with my brother, and we've each nursed a half for nearly an hour. I think this is almost a liquor substitute that isn't very complex this young but still solid and great sipping for bourbon or brandy fans."
"I want to like this more than I do. It's good, it's a fine bourbon barrel beer, but it's not that exciting and when I'm done I rarely crave another one."
"D: Bit of a sipper, but good."
"This is a very tasty beer that deserves to be sipped while the glass warms. I think the oak flavor dominates a bit too much. I'd bet with some age the alcohol notes would fade and make this a better balanced brew. I'll have to throw a bottle into the cellar before they are all gone."
"Has a very nice driniability but at 10% it only takes a couple to feel nice"
"I could sip on this all night if it wasn't for the ABV. Phenomenal beer."
"D - Pretty easy to drink for a 10.2% and nice for a Minnesota winter day/night. I could drink about 2 before I had enough. Its a bit boozy but I'm ok with that. I'm not much for scotch ales but I do enjoy is one, especially barrel aged."
"Drinkabilty - Well, its over 10% so you cant drink it as you like. I split a 12oz bottle with a friend and was happy, so 1 bottle is enough. I can say, this should be a top 100 beer on here, its fantastic and i hope more people get to drink it."
"drinks pretty well for a beer as strong and bourbon-heavy. one in a night is plenty to warm me up, though. one of my favorite winter beers!"
"Cheers."
"D-This is a superb beer. Like so many full flavored brews this should be savored for its complexity and its power. I may have just found my new favorite Wee Heavy. I may also have just killed my palate for the evening. After this, anything you drink will taste like water."
"over all a very drinkable beer."
"Overall: I could see why a little time on the shelf could settle this one down a bit. I do think the bourbon flavor is complex and not without its charm, but a little time to melt into the rest of the flavors could help the overall balance."
"T - perfect balance of bourbon, some of these taste too strong of bourbon which i hate. this one tastes so sweet you forget about the 10% abv."
"I can't account for the good-but-not-great reviews for this beer. There's a big disparity between the tapped and bottled version, maybe? I dunno. What I do know is that this tasted like a world class brew, and I'd love a chance to try it again."
"What kind of barrels are these in? Remind me never to buy that bourbon."
"D: Can I have another please. Now!!! Yeah, it's that easy to drink. Small sips only please... ""savor every morsel"" as my momma used to say."
"D: Pretty good. Maybe one bottle is good?"
"D - A little boozy, and I think I'll try to age my remaining bottle and see how it mellows."
"Fuller body, some dry and stickiness in the feel. Definitely a super slow sipper, but delicious if you're into bourbon and whiskey flavors. You can feel this beer going all the way down, and despite it's super bold flavors, I found it very tasty."
"I love this beer. Yet another winner for Founders!"
"D/M: The aging really has given this the characteristic of a scotchy smoothness. It goes down really easily which is scary because you don't overly sense the 10% alcohol that goes into this bad boy. Very nice to sit and enjoy but hard to switch to other beers that do not pair the weight."
"Let me preface this with saying that I love scotch ales - I love Old Chubb, and I typically love beers aged in bourbon barrels - Black Ops comes to mind. That being said, I had a really hard time finishing one bottle of this 4 pack. It was like drinking bourbon - almost no beer taste to be found. If you love bourbon, you will love this beer - but be warned that it is EXTREMELY overpowering. I typically love Founders beers - had the Breakfast Stout and Nemesis on tap last night -- but I can't see myself buying this one again."
"D: Overall, they are advertising the bourbon barrel aging. They get that for sure. However, I would like to get something else besides Bourbon and sugar. I think it is a good beer, and interesting, however, I wouldn't purchase again (I paid $14 for a 4 pack)."
"Poured into a snifter at the Mohawk House in Sparta, NJ. Deep opaque, reddish-mahogany, with one finger of beige head that retained and laced excellently. Very little visible carbonation. The aroma revealed a huge cherry-vanilla/whiskey/oak essence, with some caramel apple and smoke as well. The taste? Wow...sweet malty, caramel-apple, cherry-vanilla, then followed by more sweet fruitiness before finishing on an ever so subtle bitter peel finish, that hid the alcohol content ridiculously well. As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for the whiskey in the nose, I wouldn't get much hint of alcohol at all. The feel was a silky smooth medium thickness, with no carbonation. The crazy thing is that the alcohol presence is such a non-factor, that you can find yourself having downed three snifters of this stuff, and still be yearning to session more. I know I was. Anyway, I sampled this at my virgin trip to the fine establishment known as the Mohawk House (see review), but even if I didn't like the place, I would've come back just for this beer. I can't remember when I have given a beer review 5's across the board..if ever. This beer is excellently done on all fronts."
"Pours a nice deep brown color with some red hues I. It. Creamy off white head with alcohol sticking to the glass. The aroma is pure malty bourbon with a nice sweet caramelized bourbon aroma. The flavor starts out intense but falls off completely. Really lands flat and boozy on the backend. Initial sweetness and starts out very nice, but dry and austere on the finish. Nothing going on but booze after the first second. As for drinkability, this is ok, not something I want more than one of but for what it is I think it's a definately sipper and a sharing bottle. Worth a shot but not on par with their other bourbon a barrel beers."
"D - the high ABV and sweetness might get to be a bit much, but with some age and (temperature) warmth, this baby is a winner!"
"Deep brown pour with a tan head that fades into a faint ring. Sticks all over the glass. Aroma is of bourbon, cherry and vanilla. It almost feels as though the bourbon aroma is burning my nose hairs. Big caramel, burnt sugar, roasted malt, and bourbon flavor. Big chewy body, and very boozy. One bottle is enough for me, this is a big beer."
"Founders makes great beers and this is no exception. This is exactly what I think of when I think bourbon aged scotch ale, and this is near the top of the list when it comes to bourbon aged beers (The best bourbon aged beer that I've ever had was brewed by Jeremy for the BA party at HopCat...a bourbon aged porter on nitro that tasted like chocolate milk) Great beer. Try it."
"D: The nice bourbon flavors are accompanied by quite a punch of alcohol. I know this beer is 10%, but wow. This could definitely benefit from some aging, which would probably take away the alcohol flavor in favor of the vanilla, bourbon, and smoke notes."
"Enjoy this if you can find it."
"ps this beer has one of the coolest labels ive ever seen."
"Overall it is well done, at first the alcohol teetered very close to overpowering the taste but as I worked my way down the glass it became more mellow. As I conclude drinking it, it gives me a nice,pleasant, relaxed feeling."
"Served from tap into a goblet at the Founders event at Duckworth's. Poured reddish-brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and bourbon. The flavor was of sweet malt, alcohol, and syrup. It had a medium feel on the palate with light to mild carbonation. Overall this one was very nicely balanced with a nice flavor. The aroma on this one was quite nice as well. Probably one of my favorite Scotch Ales to date. It is also crazy drinkable to weigh in at 10.2%..."
"im very glad i got a chance to try this. if this was readily available to me, i might get some to age, but i prolly wouldnt go out of my way to trade for this. im not sure of the price, but its worth a try."
"Overall - A great example of the style with exceptional caramel notes and a surprisingly subdued alcohol profile considering the 10.2% abv."
"Drinkability isn't exactly the name of this beer's game. It's evident from the first whiff that this is a sipper, and it's an excellent one at that, though it would definitely be nice if a bit more of the base beer's character would show through after the barrel aging process. For fans of Bourbon and beers aged on Bourbon wood, this is definitely worth a shot, and it makes a heck of a nightcap. Sadly, because the base is so masked by the aging, it becomes a good deal less interesting than it could potentially be. I'd like to see how this cellars, though, as it certainly has cellaring potential and could, mellow and become more intriguing with a bit of age on the bottle."
"Edited on 2/4/12- I love this beer now. It's one of my favorites. I'll try to get it every year."
"D: I love this beer and would pick up some more if they were on the shelves out here."
"Overall pretty rich and tasty, but the flavors are too dominated by the bourbon notes and it has a bit too much heat."
"Great well balanced scotch ale. Definitely going to buy me some bottles later this week."
"D- This is one of those dangerous beers. Big abv that is hidden well and all around great flavors. If you like big bourbon notes, this one is for you."
"D - Drinkability for me is fairly low. It may be just me getting acclimated to both of the styles, but I found this to be a real sipper and it wasn't easy to get down. For me, the sweet malts were just too much for this beer."
"D: A nice beer, not too overpowering with the bourbon character, at the same time, it seems a little one dimensional. I just read my review of Dirty Bastard and it seems like some of that goodness is missing. I like this beer, but don't love it. May have to revisit in the future. Worth trying if you are a bourbon fan or really like barrel aged beers."
"High abv is the only detractor, otherwise a very drinkable beer and one worth seeking out."
"Overall- I find this one to be excellent! The bourbon notes are very present, but not over the top. The abv's are hidden very well. I will be drinking more of this fresh and ageing a few bottles to see what happens."
"I've loved this beer in the past though can't remember if it's always this ""hot"" upon release. Right now the bourbon completely dominates the other flavors. I seem to remember it being a bit more balanced, even fresh. I'd like to give this 6+ months and see if the flavors seem to come together a bit making this a little easier to drink. The potential for greatness is there, just needs a little time I think."
"Thick, rich and chewy; very satisfying, this is a great wintertime beer and I'll be putting up a few bottles for those January snow days with an extra log on the ire and time to kill. Drinkability takes a shot because I've had one and i'm done for the night. Pick up a four pack of these before they disappear."
"D-Obviously this beer is not for people who don't appreciate a good bourbon but for those that due it is a smooth and drinkable must try."
"Bought this beer in a 12 oz bottle. Poured it into a glass. There was no head. The appearance was a nice caramel color with ruby tints visible in the light. The smell was wonderful. Definite caramel and vanilla notes in the initial smell of the ale. The taste was the same way. Obviously a oak bourbon barrel aged ale. Where I found this beer somewhat lacking was in the mouthfeel. A bit too syrupy for my taste, but this might be what you would expect from a barrel aged ale. The single bottle serving was the perfect amount. Between the intense flavor, mouthfeel, and high alcohol content, one of these is all you need."
"Taste and mouth feel were the two carrying factors for this beer. I enjoyed the sweetness and malt up front. As the beer goes down the throat it has a rather bitter finish. Also noticed some caramel and very little spice. Overall, this was quite nice. One of the best Scotch ales I have had. This one was way heavy not wee heavy due to alcohol. I don't think they are usually this strong!"
"Betty drinkable such a high alcohol beer"
"Well, for a heavily oaked-and-charred, 10.2%, unfiltered Scotch ale, I suppose it's as drinkable as it can be. B.B. is pretty much the antithesis of a session beer, with it's palate-wrecking bourbon-and-oak flavors, sweetness, and high A.B.V., but for those extreme-beer lovers with patience and time to kill, it's plenty sippable. Take at least an hour and play ""find the flavors in the oak," or, better yet, drink to accompany a good cigar. Skål! 3.5"
"Even after a year, this is definitely a bourbon bomb, a huge beer. It's good but you can tell there's excellence buried underneath it all. I'd say this needs at least another year."
"D: This beer is overly flavorful and very drinkable for the style. Oak adds a nice and lingering finish that it is warm and is enjoyed best in cold weather. Great brew and will enjoy to see how this beer develops."
"Drinability -- Easily the mellowest barrel-aged beer that Founders puts out. However, it has the least going on. A tasty sipper, if a little one-sided. A Wee Heavy worth trying."
"definitely a sipping beer. Incredible flavor, but I doubt I could have more than 1 at a time because of the alcohol and sweetness. The beer is a bit pricey so I don't know if I'd buy another 4 pack, but would definitely grab it on tap."
"The brew is moderately carbonated, and has a smooth oily slickness with a very warm feeling in the end. This is a nice beer to have on a cold October's night."
"D: Overall a little disappointed -- not sure if the beer just doesn't age well, but the tart sour notes were a bit unpleasant and I would think unintentional."
"It does have a very nice smooth mouthfeel, but overall not something I'm going to be seeking out again."
"High drinkability for the ABV, and just an overall really easy drinking Week Heavy."
"D - Similar to DB this is a sipper. However I enjoy this a lot more. This beer really highlights what a bourbon barrel can do. The bourbon notes are real smooth and delicious. I think when this comes out again I am going to do my best to grab several 4 packs of this."
"More like a barleywine than anything else. Reminds me of the Jubel 2010 I just had. Not balanced, its rich and sweet flavors make this a beer thats best enjoyed in small doses, but is is quite enjoyable."
"The body is medium full and a medium amount of carbonation which was surprising considering the lifelessness of the pour. This is a nice sippable beer that shows some nice complexities in the bourbon flavor but isn't filling or harsh in the alcohol content. Overall I really love enjoyed beer which is almost a year old. I think I should try a fresh bottle and then pick up a few more for the cellar because at a year old, this seems like the perfect age."
"D- This is a nice sipping beer. The higher ABV limits this beer to a couple before moving onto something else. Founder's makes some damn good beers and I like this one like many others do."
"(NOTE: i enjoyed later batches better. re-reviews forthcoming)"
"Drinkability is extremely high. I need more of these bottles as soon as these come out again."
"Overall still really enjoy this beer."
"D - Founders calls it a sipper, and I agree. I wouldn't hesitate to buy this one again, and am looking forward to getting more of this heading into the colder months."
"A slow sipper that should be allowed some time to warm up."
"Beer is medium body, minimal carbonation on the palate. Pretty sweet, mildly dry, creamy mouthfeel, easy drinking. This is a very very good beer. Probably my favorite Scotch to date. Amazingly smooth and completely enjoyable start to finish. Thanks Dustin."
"Barrel aging is a lot like remixing a song - it leads to different, unique, interesting renditions. Sometimes, however, a song is just better left alone, especially if the remix distorts the original to a point of it being unrecognizable. In my opinion Founders has taken a great song - one of their greatest hits in fact - and gone and ruined it. Maybe (excessive) bourbon barrel aging isn't my thing - but hey, whatever blows your dress up."
"Pours woody deep brown amber with a diminutive light tan head. What little head there is fades fast, but leaves nice, although spotty lacing on the sides of the snifter. I discover as I hold this beer up to the light, that it is completely impenetrable. The aroma is quite alluring with plenty of bourbon and sweet toffee and brown sugar malt deliciousness. I also detect earthy hints from the wood as well as sweet vanilla. Bourbon and sweet malt are definitely the most prominent of the aromas, but all in all it has a well integrated nose. The flavor is not too in your face and very enjoyable. Wonderful bourbon notes mix with a heavenly malt backbone that is bursting with flavors of brown sugar, toffee and caramel. The barrel aging shines through much more in this beer than a lot of other examples, and I can taste the wonderful woody and earthy notes, as well as a surprising amount of vanilla. The mouthfeel is oh so smooth and on the fuller side of medium, with very low carbonation. The alcohol is fairly well hidden in this brew, and it goes down much easier that one would think. If it was not so delicious, I think I would be tempted to drink it too fast. Once again, Founders for the win."
"Having a fresh one today (11-16-10) that was bottled on 10/8/10 and I can say that I like this one better with some age on it."
"D: Not bad for what it is - a sipper more akin in many ways to a mild whiskey than a beer."
"D: Drinkability is somewhat limited, as the strength and sweetness make this a slow sipper."
"I've had my share of bourbon barrel conditioned beers, but none of them exactly lived up to my expectations. In light of this, tasting this beer was practically an epiphany. I really can't imagine how this beer could be improved. The balance, the mouth feel, the pour, all for me at the absolute peak of perfection. I only wish I had another!"
"I could definitely knock back a few of these without being overwhelmed or getting sick of it."
"Three out of five categories this is a very good beer."
"It's angry. Challenging. Delicious. I want more."
"Pours a dark ruby/amber color...kinda like red hardwood floors with a nice white head with a hint of rusty coloring. Once putting my nose up to the glass I get struck in the face with bourbon and vanilla flavors. Very strong alcohol scent with some sweet malts. Love that bourbon smell!!! Wow, this taste is like nothing I've ever had before. On first sip I immediately taste a sweet marshmallow taste, followed by sweet bourbon whiskey and oak flavors. Sooo tasty! Man, this beer is so sweet, but not too sweet at all. The bourbon blends perfectly with the sweet malts and vanilla (also a bit of maple) to make a deliciously perfect beer for a dessert. The mouthfeel is very nice, but maybe a bit syrupy. Still good though. Drinkability is scary-good for how hight the abv is. Outstanding beer!"
"this is one superbly crafted beer. dangerously drinkable and perfect for a cool michigan night. 9 month old bottle and doing just fine."
"I've had this a couple times and finally got around to review it. Very very nice overall...does Founders do anything wrong when barrel aging?"
"D: I've done this a little bit backwards- I haven't yet had Dirty Bastard to compare with its barrel-aged brother. On its own I'm really enjoying this brew. The combination of flavors and finish are just right. The 10.2% is definitely noticeable but not overly hot. I think it would be even better with some grilled pork in a rich mushroom sauce- perhaps next time."
"D - Understatement of the year: ""Founders is amazing!"" JFC. Off the hook. This might be my favorite of all the Founders brews (though Nemesis is totally insane, so...)"
"Overall this is simply a fantastic beer and one that I will seek out every year when it is released. I have had a sample before this bottle that I thought was mind blowing, so I'm not sure if the plastic is just due to having an off-bottle or what. Perhaps I just didn't detect it before. Either way, it still tastes great."
"D - Fairly drinkable. Alcohol is fairly apparent. I had one of these a while ago when I first bought the fourpack and this was not as good as I remember, unfortunately."
"A very nice beer but as good as it was it's still probably not among my favorites from this brewer. Founders continues to climb the ranks of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability: Another bourbon beer from the recent barrel aged craze. Good, and complex in flavor. But not a favorite."
"I really like the complexity of this beer. Too bad I didn't pick up more when I was able. I wouls have liked to age a few."
"D - Great flavor, aroma, and body! Whats not to like about this beer? The oak flavor from the barrel comes through nicely on this one, and is not too overpowering. The only drawback, which really isnt one, is the higher abv prevents this from being a sessionable ale."
"the pour is dark brown like a wee heavy should be with a little head and a tan ring with minimal lacing..the smell is caramel and burnt toffee with a big bourbon boozy smell vanilla bean and cream smell..whoa !! the taste is boozy bourbon first so much so i dont taste the toffee and biscuit and caramel of a wee heavy..this is just a bourbon hit first with a whiskey/alcohol taste..just not my thing..the mouth fell is booze first with some caramel and toffee ..i dont know this brew is just not 4 me..so low score on drink ability..is this beer brewed well for the style ..oh yeah because as it warms it does mellow out... i just cant give it high grades for me IMO i will not buy it again. i just feel like im drinking booze instead of a fine craft brew IMO.. but will recommend it to scotch ale lovers with high bourbon notes if thats your likes"
"D: Quite boozy. Couldn't have more than 1 or 2. Nice filling after dinner beer though."
"D: Dangerous. While the complex flavors and aroma beg to be savored, it's so damn tasty and smooth it goes down rather quickly. Could drink a four pack of this easily, except I can't afford that, both in the wallet and gut."
"Although flavors from barrel aging are the dominate charecter, Founders did a grat job on blending a quality ale foundation. One of the best barrel aged offerings available."
"Enjoyed in my Magic Chouffe snifter, and ""wow"" what pleasure when controlled for temperature and glass.Full flavors of bourbon and wood, vanilla and that soft fullness that comes from excellent aging. The alcohol is only evident in it's creep; nothing that impacts the drink enjoyment. I am a rabib double imperial stout boy, who unabashedly loves Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout. But this is a wonderful drinking experience that needs to explored again and again."
"Pours from the bottle a deep, rich mahogany color, with a nice cap of light brown foam, which rather quickly settles in along the side of the glass, leaving only random bubbles upon the surface. Aromas of bourbon, dark brown sugar, caramel, toffee and vanilla. On the palate, this beer is absolutely delicious, with more great bourbon flavor, toasted malt, caramel and a little bit of milk chocolate. The bourbon here is integrated so well, and the 10% alcohol is barely noticeable. Another incredible effort from Founders."
"overall - phenomenal beer. DB is good, but this blows it away. i could drink this every day."
"D- Dangerously drinkable and one of the two best scotch ales I've ever had (the other was also barrel aged)."
"D: Shockingly smooth and drinkable for 10.2%. Obviously you could have a few of these and they would sneak up on you. I think this one is another winner from Founders."
"Drinkability: Do you like heavy? Do you like bourbon? This is a good beer for you then. At more than $5 a bottle in Louisville, I will buy a bottle every now and then for an in-your-face bourbon beer experience, but I doubt I'd ever order a second."
"I don't know if it is very drinkable to the average joe but I happen to love bourbon so its right up my alley. the 10% abv & bourbon barreled aged can really cause this one to sneak up on ya! definitely worth the experience."
"D-this is actually insanely drinkable for a 10%+ beer. The alcohol is so well hidden, slightly warm at the very back but not at all detracting from the beer, just letting you knoww this is a beast. The complexity is a beautiful blend or flavors that work well together and transition so nicely. Glad I have a whole growler for the evening!"
"SkÅL!"
"Overall, a very nice beer. Recommended."
"D: Definitely a sipper of a beer. Nice, tons of carmel in there. Roasty, oaky and really does taste like something out of the backwoods."
"d- this is one strong, potent beer. i'm glad i had the chance to try it, but this isn't something i could polish off on my own with much ease. the alchohol and strong flavors in the bastard hinder the drinkability a bit, overall though this is a pretty fine beer."
"D- This is a sipping beer, but quite easy or someone to drink over dinner or for a relaxing drink after a meal."
"D-This beer is not very drinkable by the standards of high ABV brews. The alcohol was very prominent, and the barrel aging seemed to give it a bit too much of a harsh spirit-like quality."
"Drinkability: It's going to be tough for a barrel aged wee heavy to be very drinkable but this one definitely pushes that limit."
"Obviously I really liked it nice look great taste had a wonder taste to me of dark cherries. I have had some like this that the smell and taste overpower but not like this beer again well balanced, it is strong, so be carefull here. This is a brew I would love to try again and am greatful to try."
"Drinkability: The abv and prominent hop bitterness hold it back a bit."
"A great beer in every category. Definitely a sipper."
"M/D- full bodied, low carbonation. very smooth and silky mouthfeel makes this beer a treat to drink, especially with the absence of the alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is very creamy and dessert-like. This one is truly a treat. I could really go through these regularly if we could get them out here."
"Seek this one out. And get more than one bottle, because you're going to like it more and more with each one. And for the love of God - drink it cold!"
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thin tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm burnt toffee scent along with a nice oak bourbon aroma. The taste is awesome. It has a wonderful mix of warm burnt toffee with fresh oak and bourbon. The oak contributes an excellent vanilla character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. I'm generally a huge fan of Scotch ales anyway, but this one is exceptional. The barrel aging adds an additional layer of complexity. The 10.2% abv. is well hidden."
"On tap at Capone's Friday and reviewed from notes. Pours out a very dark brown with not head and just a ring of off-white froth around the edges of the beer. Leaves light lacing that is spotty but looks pretty good for an aged beer. Smell needs a bit of strength but it is good. Bourbon, wood, vanilla and that signature caramelly/sugary scotch ale scent. No alcohol comes through in the nose. Taste was fantastic. A perfect balance, it is like the bottle but much more balanced and without the alcohol notes. Bourbon, oak, caramel, vanilla, and great tasty malts combine to form a nectar of the gods. The bourbon level here is perfect and more enjoyable than the extremely strong bourbon in KBS. Mouthfeel also improves from the bottle! The body is medium but very, very creamy with moderate carbonation. A tiny warmth makes for the most suitable mouthfeel possible. I could drink this on-tap all night, if the ABV didn't eventually kill me. It is so balanced on tap, it is amazing. The price at Capone's was fantastic and the flavor couldn't get any better for what the beer is."
"The taste is chocolately sweet. Strong alcohol presence. It's like a brown ale with a shot of rum. Rich body, like a true wee heavy."
"This is a sipper, although I'm tempted to have two in one sitting despite the high alcohol. The flavors are so well-blended they just invite you back for sip after sip after sip. Would be interested to age this one for a year and see how it develops."
"Drinkability: I just bombed a final exam, and Backwoods Bastard is acting as the perfect comfort beer. A little more complexity would be nice, but then again my mind is totally shot right now. Not great, but certainly recommended."
"D: Very much nicer than it was when it was fresh."
"Damn, this is a treat. I'm already a huge fan of Dirty Bastard and the bourbon barrel aging is blended so well in this one, particularly balanced in the flavor. More, please!"
"D: A phenomenal beer. I had this side by side with Dirty Bastard, and I loved the way the barrels change this one. I will seek out more in the future."
"Still a good representation of the style. More smoke would be nice but it was a good drink."
"Edit: Oct 2010 - have had this beer a couple of times with some age on it and find that it's much better. Bourbon and heat die down and allow more of the Wee Heavy character to become evident. There's even a bit of the smokyness that wasn't there when I had it fresh. Bourbon's still very evident, but enhances the base beer instead of competing with it."
"A real sipper here...rich and malty and boozy and a pleasure to sip and enjoy..."
"A bourbon barrel-aged Scotch Ale seems a no-brainer, but obviously it's the bourbon stouts that are more popular. Backwoods Bastard is so totally smooth, not near as cloying as could be imagined from a beer of this construction. But we should, by now, expect Founders to have a firm handle on anything they choose to do."
"This beer is antagonistic for lack of a better word. Certainly worth a try, it stands out among some of the barrel-aged brews I have enjoyed recently. The ""bastard"" on the label pretty much summarizes the beer. If you are a scotch/bourbon/whiskey, etc. drinker, you will enjoy the intricacies of this brew."
"pours a beautiful, ruby amber with a ruby tinted two finger. flakes of sediment throughout the glass. the smell is strong and boozy, dominated by bourbon, oak, caramel, and vanilla, with backrounds of malt. complex and lovely. I found myself smelling this one for awhile, a little hesitant to try it. didn't want a mouthful of bourbon i think. the taste is not as strong as the smell, with flavors of vanilla, sweet malt, scotch, and booze with a hint of a bitter finish. the mouthfeel is so velvety and silky. definitely a slow drinker. i could see not liking this beer a few years ago. some people around the room both loved it and disliked it, but it is a experienced nerds beer i think."
"Notes: A nicely aged scotch ale. Pleasing and memorable."
"With this beer rated quite well, I am beginning to think I should take a break altogether from purchasing bourbon barrel aged beers. This is another example of one that is just too boozy. I guess I like to separate my bourbon and beer drinking habits."
"Mouth feel is thick and with everything going on in this beer it is a sipper."
"D - I definitely enjoy this beer and glad I have a few more left. Congrats to Founders for another outstanding effort."
"The beer pours a dark brownish-red with a small white head. The aroma is awesome, lots of cherry, vanilla and bourbon. The flavor is just as great, with the same cherry, vanilla and bourbon notes, with the vanilla being the most dominant flavor. There is very little detectable alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is low."
"Truly a fantastic brew. Wish I had bought more than one - now I have to wait 6+ months for more! Dammit."
"For a widely available seasonal beer this one is terrific and definitely a must try for all big beer lovers."
"Whap - that is the sound of this beer smacking you in the face on first sip. An immediate onslaught of bourbon and vanilla oak, some sweet malt and fusel alchohol. After a couple more sips to acclimate, the alcohol retreats but does not leave the background. Malty sweetness emerges and the beer with a shot impression lingers. A bit more boozy than I care for."
"Overall, one of the best scotch ales I've ever had. Another great Founders beer, go figure."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Its got a deep copper color with slightly rocky lacing. The smell is amazing. Its the best of both worlds, bourbon and beer. There are heavy vanilla flavors coming in from the oak and bourbon, mixed with the creamy robust flavors from the scotch ale. What a truly amazing beverage. The alcohol is present, but its not the focal point of this beer."
"This beer took me way to long to drink. It had some decent attributes, and some nice, subtle barrel character, but the base beer didn't impress me. It feels a bit lifeless in the mouthfeel, and the flavors just weren't my bag."
"D - A very nice beer. With so many stouts being aged in bourbon, it was nice to have a Scotch Ale. The style really lends itself to the bourbon. The ABV of this beers knocks it out of ""session"" territory, but I could drink maybe two of these in a night. It is a great sipper."
"Taste: Very complex, too much going on to take it apart at first sip. You get the wood, the whiskey, and below the sweet Scotch ale at the base. Mmm, oaky...mmm, rich and bourbony. Starts sweet, gets dry and well-rounded, nicely balanced, and oozing over with wonderful flavor. You don't feel the 10% right away, but it gets in there, oh, yes...very nice. Not too much bourbon, which can be a detriment at times. If it weren't so strong or so expensive, I'd be at this quite a bit."
"D: Excellent. This is a very well crafted beer. I could imagine having more than one of these in a sitting, but eventually the high a.b.v. would put an end to that."
"The first incounter with this beer was remarkable. The appearance came with a wonderful copper color. The bourbon smell was right on point with taste that was an explosion of bourbon, malts, and hops. The mouth was pretter bitter and had a puckering effect because of the bourbon aging.. Overall it was an excellent experience for a seasonal brew.."
"Note to richbrew. Lets clear this up?? Lets do that. Whatever floats your boat. Before you criticize reviews and taste of others you might want to review more than 17 beers. Secondly, dont bash other reviews. Its one's own taste and choice."
"D - Had this once before (very fresh) and thought it was way too wild...have a few bottles left and hopefully some age will bring out even more complexities. as far as drinkability goes, abv and tons of sweetness make a single bottle almost too much."
"Excellent effort."
"Bottle pours a dark hazy brown with little floaties seen in the glass. You can smell the burbon on this one, and its definately in the taste too. Mixed with a dark malt taste, and it does drink so damn smooth. The 10.20% is very well hidden. This was a decent beer and glad I got to try it. Never had a burbon barrel aged beer before. Nice offering."
"The booze is very well hidden and I think this beer is dangerously easy to drink. I wish I could get access to this beer more frequently as it may have moved up into my top 5 brews."
"D - This was my first bourbon aged beer...I wasn't sure what to expect besides the bourbon flavor and this provided lots of bourbon...it smelled nice but maybe this just isn't my style...I'll have to just try more bourbon barrel aged beers!"
"Recomended if you can find it. I have 3 more I may age for a while to see if the scotch ale flavors come forward after a year or so."
"However...I think the bottle I had was way too young. The alcohol has not settled and melded. It seems to have some good underlying characteristics that may present themselves better in a years time once the alcohol settles down."
"D: A very good beer for it's style, however, it's high ABV and intense flavor make it a bit heavy to sit down with and enjoy on it's own. It will be interesting to see how it ages."
"Poured dark with rich, creamy head. Aroma is predominantly bourbon, with hints of malt and caramel. Smokey, oak barrel flavors with a hint of mild whiskey bite over vanilla. A pleasant, drinkable brew that feels nice and warm once it settles and will have you craving another as soon as you polish off the first one. Low carbonation, this makes for a good reading ale."
"Poured into a Chimay chalice, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head is quickly down to an uneven skim, with heavy legs, minimal lace. Aroma is sweetness and bourbon. Taste starts sweet, a touch of fruit in the middle, and then heavy on the vanilla, with a warming close. Flavors seem very distinct and separate. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. I keep coming back to this one."
"D: Delicious. Complex and a real joy to have. The appearance of tiny particles in the beer really threw me off in the beginning but it recovers well. Like a barrel-aged RIS but without the soy sauciness, making it a different experience altogether, but still enjoyable nonetheless."
"Sweet caramel is noticeable upfront. That gives way to slightly boozey, bourbon flavor. A faint smokieness is in the background, with a dry, bitter finish. Body is medium-full. Overall a pretty solid effort and a nice concept."
"I poured from a bottle into a snifter. It is murky and muddy in apperance with a slight white head. The nose is full of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and sweet caramel. The taste is bourbon heavy, but not overbearing. It is nicely rounded out with some vanilla. The finish is hot with alcohol. It has a medium/full body and has nice carbonation. I really liked this. The bourbon really works with this one."
"Aquired via trade with beerbeerbeerbeer, Thanks brother. Pours a dark copper with a nice two finger head. Smell is dominated with bourbon but in a good way. Also vanilla, oak, brown sugar, love it. The taste is a huge sweetness, plums, bourbon, toffee and caramel. Mouthfeel is perfect silky smooth coats well with a full body. Drinkability is off the charts. A sipper for sure but will seek out again and again, Founders nailed it on this one."
"Feel and Drinkability: Overall this one feels very nice. It warms once it hits the stomach. The beer is heavy on the palate and carbonation is low as it should be, otherwise it'd be way out of balance. Although its heavy on the palate it is far from syurpy. This is one that I'll not hesitate to pick up again...another great offering from Founders, they cease to amaze me."
"D: A decent beer but too thin and unbalanced, worth trying but not one that I will try again."
"Overall I was more impressed with the bottle version I had last year as I feel like the whiskey notes were more well-defined. Still, this remains a very good beer and one that's worth a shot."
"More food than beer? Possibly. A good example of the style? More than likely. A damn good beer either way? Definitely."
"I don't think my score will really reflect how much I am enjoying this. It is my first Wee Heavy. Appearance I gave average but I honestly don't know what these are supposed to look like. Drinkability took a hit but this is a really awesome smelling and tasting beer. Bourbon lovers should really check this out. Get a few for your bourbon loving non craft beer drinking friends. I think this will make then see craft beer in a different light."
"Great beer. Not sure I could have more than one in a night, but this is a great alternative to regular bourbon."
"Pours a real nice dark red color with a small white head that quickly dissapears but leaves some head around, enough to leave some pretty good lacing down the glass. The smell is very caramel and very malty. There is also some chocolate that is pretty apparent in the smell as well which starts to stand out more the more I smell it. The taste is very malty and pretty chocolatety. There is a hint of vanilla and if you look for it the taste of the bourbon barrels is right there and adds a nice touch to the taste. The mouthfeel is pretty average, but is good for the style. A high ABV but noticeable in the taste. I'd do this whole four pack in a night easily. Overall this is one I've been wanting to try for a while and am glad I did. I've been getting more into this style lately and this one is up there with the better ones I've had lately. Great stuff but then again what do you expect from Founders!"
"D: An extremely, almost to much so, drinkable beer considering its high abv. You probably would never guess as the alcohol adds beautiful highlights and added flair, and NOT off balancing hot liquor notes like so many other high abv beers do. Extremely smooth, refined, sweet and joyous to consume."
"Poured to a caramelish head and about 1 fingered at that. Head hung around and left some good lacing with every swallow. Brew itself was a dark brown in color. Boozy smell was very evident with the opening of this bottle. Also smelled of caramel and hops. When opening, I didnt think I was going to enjoy this brew. But I was wrong. Strong bourbon taste at first. Then you got a nice creamy slightly bitter taste of booze, caramel and dark roasted coffee. Flavors blended pretty good. Felt thicker in the mouth. Carbonation was good. You couldnt make this a session beer. After drinking I sure had a good buzz. But it wood be nice to enjoy every now and then."
"Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, smooth and creamy. This is a very drinkable Scotch Ale. I have to wonder if Founders is capable of making a bad beer? It seems like everything they make is either very good or great."
"Overall, a very good beer that I enjoyed a lot. If this were more readily available to me, it would be in my regular rotation. Thanks again, John!"
"Nice big mouthfell."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is above average for the style, the high ABV with the burbon will limit it some. Overall, I am very pleased with this brew. The barrel did its job here, very solid, and recommended. Skal."
"This beer is truly awesome. Love it."
"One finger tan head didn't last long, some soapy bubbles persist on the side. Light lacing. Solid dark brown body. Light malty nose, but not really noticeable. Taste is peppery first, sweet second, alcoholic third. Not really that petty, scotch flavor I was expecting at first. Chocolate notes come through with more drink, almost like a chocolate martini now that I think about it. Mouthfeel is perfect, I like the balance and everything about it on the tongue. Even with the noticeable alcohol, I could drink this pretty easy, no problem. I liked this brew. Thanks to hophead101 for throwing this in the ss09 bif."
"I think this is incredibly drinkable. Probably a sipper for most though. This one could really get me in trouble. I love every facet of the flavor. This would make a great after dinner beer and would bode quite well in some dessert recipes or over ice cream. Yet another outstanding beer from Founders and it may be my overall favorite."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent for the style. I've been fortunate enough to try several bourbon barrel aged malt heavy beers in the past year, and this is towards if not at the top of the list. Great beer from Founders!"
"Overall, a really fantastic brew!"
"D - A great scotch ale, and one that I would happily return to again."
"Overall, a solid beer, but the scotch notes were not as apparent as one would expect. I do like it, but I am very curious to what would happen with some age on it. I recommend this one."
"d - just when you think you have tried everything! i've had some beers before that were aged in bourbon barrels but none have had whiskey notes like this one. i'm not a huge fan of really malty caramel beers like double bocks and wee heavies but this one gets balanced out nicely with the whiskey bite and slight hop bitterness. if you like whiskey you must try this."
"D: A very unique bourbon,er, beer. It goes down like a shot, but sips like a beer. Sipped it while making a good chicken dinner. Perfect for a snowy winter night."
"D: Very tasty, nicely balanced, goes down easily, one or two would do me, but a nice one to sit and enjoy."
"love the label, love that founders is in va. after having drank one from the bottle, i didn't realize how light in color this would be. it is, after all, a scottish, but silly me, here i thought i had a stout in my belly. somewhere around carnelian in color and reaking of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, oak, and alcohol. caramel and vanilla up front then washed back with bourbon. a little sweet. much better in a glass. i could drink eleven of these if it were prudent."
"Pours an opaque deep reddish mahogany with a small head that recedes quickly. Big sweet complex bourbon aroma with notes of fruit and oak. Taste is quite sweet. Again a very pleasant bourbon flavor. Carmel malt. A tiny bit of bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied. Finishes dry with a hint of warming alcohol. Pretty easily drinkable although this is a sipper given its flavorfulness and abv. Really nice and interesting beer overall."
"I found this to be very drinkable given the heartiness of this ale. The sweetness complemented the dryness of the wood enough not to be overbearing."
"This is definitely a great beer, but it's one of those beers I'd only have one maybe two in a night."
"O Very good brew. One to consider on those long, cold, winter nights."
"An aggressive pour gets you maybe a half finger of deep tan foam, swift to evacuate the premises, nothing close to lacing present. Super-cloudy brown-red mud in appearance, barely lightens at the rims, looks like you could catch a catfish in it. Smells like someone hit you in the face with a coconut custard pie, butterscotch, caramel, no kidding about those bourbon barrels, plum to prune, date and maraschino cherry fruit scents, close to zero room for anything else. Full-bodied, thick and treacly, you almost spoon it into your mouth. again, the coconut custard, butterscotch, caramel, vanilla fudge, caramelized brown sugar flavors far and away dominant. Candied orange peel is there. Cherry, plum fruit, once more, in a candied, boozed up fashion. Splash of ginger and allspice. There is nothing subtle about this beer, it's on you like white on rice. You must drink it under carefully thought out circumstances. You have been warned."
"Fairly drinkable brew...fair offering by Founders. A bit too ""boozy"" to drink more than 1 or 2, but enjoyable."
"Backwoods Bastard I've been wanting to try this for quite sometime now, I liked last year's label with the Banjo player adorning the label. Pours a murky mahogany brown amber hue with a large off white tan khaki head forming fine even lacing down the sides of my glass. Aromatics come straight from the barrel, soakin with vanilla/oak and mild charred bitter notes. Peated malt smokiness entertaining me upon a big malty alcoholic Scotch Ale like Dirty Bastard. Whiskey stands out in the nose and in flavor with vanilla/caramel soaked malts bringing in sweetness this beer is pretty amazing. I'm not crazy on either scotch whiskey/bourbon/scotch ale but the flavors combined do much better than each individual for me. Alcohol is so warming it pretty much overbears the carmel/vanilla/charred oak combo in my book this beer is so big I haven't tasted anything like it to date as far as craft beer goes. Carbonation surprisingly smooth and well represented, while the body is thick with residual sugars that didn't make it past residual sugars. Drinkability overall is an intense scenario that I'm sure will be passed on from generation to generation within the beer community."
"The bourbon aging really works well here, and is extremely well balanced with with everything else that is going on. I love how the barrel aging has not taken away from the Scotch Ale base. Highly recommended."
"Ok so this brew is probably better than I am giving it. Not to say that it wasn;t a very enjoyable brew. It's just that i had bourbon county earlier today and yes i know stout vs. ale is different, but i did and so be it. The appearance is a nice medium golden hue. Has a nice mellow smell of bourbon with a wee bit of vanilla and toffee. A nice mellow bourbon taste followed by vanilla and spice. Feels a bit heavy for an ale, but still easily drinkable. I enjoyed this brew just not as much as the previous brew i had. I could have a had one or two more but that would be it before the bourbon sweetness got to me. Definitely worth a try though."
"Drinkability: A somewhat tough drink in my opinion. Definitely a sipper. The strong bourbon and higher ABV hamper drinkability. Pretty good overall, but one glass is enough."
"wow. what a monster. this is a very well executed experiment and definitely seems like a special occasion beer. dark mahoganyish brown with a creamy, tan colored head that holds very well and leaves tons of splotchy, webby lace as it goes. nose is really reminicent of the backwoods moonshine we get here in virginia. it's super top shelf, often aged for many years, and always comes with fruit in it. backwoods bastard reminds me of the cherry kind. booze, caramel, burnt toffee, cherry, wood, earth, brown sugar... all kinds of stuff going on here. taste is peaty booze up front, dark sugar laced fruit in the middle, and musty celarish (like a musty celar that is) woody booze in the back. mouthfeel is slick and creamy at the same time with a long, boozy finish that really isn't all that dry, it's just boozy. this is a nice one that i feel is executed well because the beer and the barrel get to share the stage as opposed to the barrel taking over. the fruity, roasty, malty goodness of dirty bastard is here and the sweet, peaty, earthy, boozy, woody goodness of the barrels are here, and they come together in fantastic balance to create a bastard bastard. amazing. can't drink more than one, and maybe should have shared this one with someone, but amazing none the less."
"Pours a hazy deep brown with about two fingers of head after an aggressive pour. There's a fair amount of sediment swirling around in the bottom of the beer and a lot of lacing as the head dies down. The smell is tremendous. LOts of bourbon with some sweet malt as well. The taste is absolutely heavenly. Initially very smooth and sweet with a hint of oak and vanilla The aftertaste is primarily sweet bourbon. Very boozey, but unlike a lot of beers, that's not a downside. Between the alcohol content and the flavor, this is a sipper. Almost like sipping on a good whiskey. This is probably my favorite beer that I could legally buy in the state of ohio right now. If I could afford it, I'd buy out my local shops and drink it right now."
"I must say I love this beer. It smells incredible, tastes just the same, and is smooth and deep. The alcohol is very well-hidden. In many ways, it's a less hoppy, more malt-focused cousin to Founders Curmudgeon, which is one of my favorite beers."
"This beer pours with a medium sized light brown head that sticks around for a few minutes and leaves light lacing. The beer itself is a brownish red color with nice orange hues. Smelling this beer is like putting your head inside an oak bourbon barrel. Large vanilla, oak and whiskey notes. There is also a lot of nice malt character int he aroma, caramel, roasted nuts and Light biscuit. The hops are really an after thought in the aroma, very light bitter presence. This beer has a wonderful flavor again a lot of the character is coming from the barrel. Huge vanilla, chard wood, and nutty flavors. Hints of caramel, butter, cherries. This beer is well balanced, the hops add just enough bitterness but do not take over. The flavor is really about the barrel. This is one of the better barrel aged beers I have had. I would like to see more Wee Heavys aged in barrels. Mild complex and smooth drinking, this is a great beer."
"UPDATE: Definitely don't cellar more than a month or two. There is little to no heat. Buy as much of this as you can -- delicious top tier BBA ale.  Stellar aroma and flavor. I have not had Dirty Bastard for a while and will have to revisit to see the connect as I have drank a case of Backwoods Bastard since my last DB."
"This is one fantastic beer and I'll be buying some to cellar"
"D- Overall this beer tastes just like I expected. This seems to be Dirty Bastard aged in bourbon barrels and that is exactly what I got."
"D - Hmmm...hard to say totally. I think this ultimately is a sipper...10.2% alcohol and plenty of bourbon in the nose and flavor...but it is so smooth, it really begs you to take sip after sip after sip. On a really snowy day, sitting in front of the fire after dinner with one of these is just the right combination. For what it is, really good...but more than one of these will cause me some problems for sure."
"Granted, if you're not a fan of bourbon - you will most likely not care for this brew. But if you are a fan ... Merry Christmas!"
"I didn't get a lot of peat or smokiness in this beer so it seems to be more of a straight ""strong ale"" than a scotch ale, but it is tasty none the less. Nice bourbon flavors without dominating the beer. Good stuff!"
"Founders Backwoods Bastard is not as good as good scotch ale, because it's too boozy, and it's not as good as good scotch whiskey if you want to sit back and sip, because it's too thick; but it is a nice creamy after-dinner experience if you have someone with whom to share a 12-ounce bottle."
"Beautiful deep brown with minimal head, has the appearance of an ale aged in oak. Perhaps the oak contributed to some of the dark color here. Swirling the glass provides a small amount of carbonation and the head appears a tan, mocha cappucino froth color. The aroma coming off this beer is delightful, full of dried fruits, huge oak presence and a big hint of booziness. Nice caramel and toffee aromas as well. Malty beast here I suppose. Absolutely delicious, oak and caramel right up front. Alcohol carries the flavor across the tongue. Super rich and malty, the oak is wonderful in this beer...more than I've ever realized in another oak aged beer. Never got a deep wood taste from any other beer before this. Pairs so well with the toffee and burnt sugar flavors. Vanilla is a huge flavor going on here too, each sip is wondrous. Huge and syrupy mouthfeel, great aged Scotch ale. Hope I can find more of this in large quantities. A bit too heavy to be easily drinkable, only cracked this one out because Philly got hit with a wicked snowstorm tonight. Great beer!"
"Overall: This is genius really... You take a scotch style and age it in bourbon barrels? Two Scottish specialties in one mouthwatering drink. Makes me giggle, just how smooth the bourbon is with the beer. Maybe I will have that second one."
"D-Wow, this beer is really mellow for being 10%+. That being said, it's still definitely a sipper."
"There is a smooth feeling going down the mouth, a little spicy, but not like the heat of an alcohol burn. Ends a bit syrupy with me smacking my lips in overall satisfaction. If I was hiking, though, I can assure you I would not want to run into the Backwoods Bastard--as he looks scary--but I would drink his beer again."
"This is my second attempt at a bourbon beer - I'm not much of a whiskey drinker so I was a little skeptical, but boy am I glad I tried the Backwoods Bastard. An absolutely fantastic beer. I'll definitely be buying more of these."
"Drinkability:I really enjoyed drinking this. I'll probably pick up another 4-pack before it goes out of season. This is a great cold weather brew. Really a pleasant improvement to it's predecessor Dirty Bastard, definitely worthy of a seperate seasonal release."
"Notes: Reminds me of the time when I found an old bottle of Double Crooked Tree and poured in a shot of rye to cover the dead hops. "
"i am shocked this is a 10.20% ABV. I could down this glass with no issues and pop another bottle which would lead me to sleeping on the floor. this is one hell of a bourbon beer. works quite well fresh, cannot wait to see what some age does."
"For only being a seasonal release, I would like nothing more than to see this be available more often. It's just excellent. My only complaint may be that the flavors that I would have expected from the aging in bourbon barrels was not there. Instead, there was something unique to the beer that I like immensley."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served alongside Slappy Sappy Bastard on 12/10/09 and reviewed from notes. The beer was served in a tulip glass a murky brown with a decent khaki head that diminished to a thin layer. The aroma is Bourbon in front of dark malts, burnt caramel and slight dark fruits. The taste is dark malts, dried fruits, bourbon and vanilla. The beer is slightly heavy with a decent alcohol presence, but an enjoyable sipper. This is a very enjoyable beer, I'm looking forward to opening a one year old bottle I've been holding."
"All in all, if you like roasted nuts and coconut, then this is your brew. I love walnuts, but don't like coconuts, so this one is good for me, but not great. You might think otherwise."
"OVERALL pretty easy drinking big beer. Alc not really so evident other than the nose."
"Personally, I want to be able to identfy the Scotch Ale traits underneath it all. And this doesn't allow me to do that."
"D- well it seems very good to sip one or two or these but i cant imagine drinking anymore than that for that fact it actually makes my mouth and tongue water. as in i need to be replenished with water. not bad by any means, but most certainly not a session beer. good for sipping and makes me all tingly on the inside."
"Highly drinkable, if only for enjoying after a big dinner - great to warm the insides on a cold winter day."
"D= Great beer. One of the best beers I've ever had. A total Vanilla bomb and everything you could want from a barrel aged beer. This has all the great woody oak flavors you can ask for without having over powering bourbon flavors and just enough of everything to make this a great beer."
"I could think of nothing better, then to sit in front of a warm fireplace on a cold winter's eve sipping a snifter of this beer. And when I drink Backwoods Bastard, that is the scene that instantly comes to mind. A great after dinner drink, with a great amount of complexity. A rich creamy body, and very mild amount of carbonation really improves the overall drinkability despite the high ABV."
"Drinkability: This beer goes down smoothly a sip at a time, with each sip leaving me wanting another. I won't hesitate to have this one again. And am already thinking that it would be a fine beer to serve as a digestive after a tasty meal with good friends. However there also is a bit of rough edge to the bitterness on this one and I'm thinking it needs a few more months in the bottle for the flavors to become truly integrated and smoothed out."
"12oz. bottle served in a snifter. Poured a dark amber with a finger of off white head. Amazing aroma of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, and a little alcohol. Big, rich and smooth body. Toffee and more vanilla in the flavor. A fair amount of hop bitterness, but just to balance the malt. I wouldn't call this a hoppy beer though. Very long finish of vanilla, oak and bourbon. Might be a bit over the top with the bourbon, but in a good way! One of the best beers I have had this year."
"D: Great beer that is pretty easy to drink for the abv. Perfect brew for a cold night in front of the fire. Founders doesn't seem to make a bad beer, and this is just another example of their best work."
"Taste is exceptionally sweet with more traces of maple syrup, vanilla, and varying whiskeys.. but not quite as diverse and complicated as the smell. Not very heavy or hot for something with double digit ABV, this is pretty drinkable. Enjoyed"
"Overall impression: Probably an nice candidate for cellaring, although the bourbon is perfectly integrated into the beer already. Very enjoyable sipper."
"Big bourbon aroma. A swirl kicks up a sweet maltiness behind it, hinting at the base beer's character. Otherwise it's sweet, woody whiskey and sour mash fumes: hints of corn, cherry, and fried plantain. Full fledged bourbon flavor too, more or less steamrolling the whole thing. Luckily not as harsh as straight bourbon, but the full flavor is there. Flashes of sweet malt underneath, with a growing warming sensation in the gut with every sip. Low carb and medium body, the strong flavor takes centerstage."
"D - While this is not an incredibly boozy beer, the alcohol can grow tiresome. That aside, this is a solid beer worth seeking out again."
"200th review! A nice molasses brown with bourbon highlights. Almost no head, although I can't knock it too much because of the ABV. Nose is very reminiscent of other big bourbon beers, notably similar to BCS. By that I mean that the nose is nearly all bourbon, but I still like it. Vanilla, oak, and earthy notes abound. Again, this is quite like a lighter version of BCS. Delicious. Amazing how underneath the initial bourbon assault comes a bit of leafy/earthy hops and a decent alcohol and slightly spicy kick. Fantastic take on bourbon aging, surprised more people don't try it with ales. Mouthfeel is creamy, slick, and full bodied. I'm really impressed. Tremendous sipper, interesting, complex, delicious."
"Its always cool when breweries barrel-age a style of beer that isn't typically barrel-aged. I can't think of any other notable Scotch Ales that are aged in bourbon barrels, which makes this a nifty beer to try if only for the story of it. Make no mistake -- it's not a gimmick. The barrel flavors -- while perhaps not executed to the degree that they should be -- do improve upon the base beer. This is a fine sipper."
"Drinkability: Very slow occasional sipper. Strong flavor, strong ABV."
"D = This is good, but perhaps a bit cloying by the end of the glass"
"D - I expected something big, round, sweet, and bourbon like, but what I got is something far leaner and meaner than one would expect from a scotch ale. There is a lot of phenolic smoke character in this beer, either from abused yeast or from peat, and it does some strange things when it meets the bourbon. The phenolics seem to bring out a lot of the boozy and astringent qualities of the whiskey that are usually not present in barrel aged beers; combine this with the relative dryness of this brew, and the fact that it is not at all shy about its 10% abv, and you have a weirdly convincing bourbon beer. I'm still not quite sure what I think about this one. It has managed to capture a lot of the harsher qualities of distilled spirits that I prefer not to see in a beer; on the other hand, I have to respect the fact that they have brewed what I can only regard as the liquid equivalent of the grizzled, scotch-irish mountain man that graces the label of the bottle. This is quite a unique beer, and while I won't be rushing out to buy another one, I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to try it."
"I would recommend this to someone who enjoys a good bourbon This is definately a sipper."
"D- Amazingly drinkable. I find this easier to drink than the Dirty Bastard I'm having with it (less of the cloying maltiness.) The bourbon is obviously there (in the finish, specifically), so that would keep drinkability down for some."
"Great scotch ale, the only big complaint is the lack of carbonation, but that won't keep me from buying a couple 4 packs! A fine dessert beer."
"Personally I like this stuff, but it IS pretty strong in the whiskey department. Easy call if you like whiskey you will love this. If you do not like whiskey this will be a drain pour."
"D: I was expecting to be blown away by booze, but it really was quite manageable. That said, you still feel it after enjoying a bottle."
"Thanks John!"
"D- not as drinkable, but i could definitely drink two"
"Wow! Dangerously drinkable. The bourbon keeps this from being an authentic Scotch ale, but it's supremely tasty."
"Edit: Re-review 1/29/10, the bourbon has mellowed the slightest bit, allowing the phenomenal vanilla barrel flavour character to come through, as well as the layered caramel malt. Truly a great beer."
"Would I buy more of it? - I bought one bottle to give this one a try and now I am kicking myself for not shelling out the $14 for a 4-pack, I believe its worth every penny. Hopefully I'll find some more before its all gone"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and and light on carbonation. Drinkability is probably as good as it can be for a 10% beer that has a lot of bourbon flavor. I enjoyed one but couldn't drink this on a regular basis or more then one in a sitting. An enjoyable treat though none the less to have on occasion."
"I am usually not a huge fan of Scotch ales, but this is the cream of the crop. A really amazing beer, I am going to pick some more up to age in the cellar. Also, you gotta love the artwork and the labeling on the packaging. Really a perty brew."
"D: This beer overall sweeter, smoother, and lighter than ""Dirty Bastard"". The high alcohol content is suprisingly masked. I could definitely go for another!!"
"D - 10.2% abv. I'd be careful it is strong and you probably couldn't tell if youre not paying attention."
"Drink: The alcohol is hidden rather well I think. You can feel it, but the taste isn't overwhelming. A sipper yes, but its a good drink."
"MMmmmm, baby, baby - can't get enough of your beer babe. Luxuriant. Poured with fine creamy, light tan head and good lace. Color is cured cherry wood. Aroma is vanilla, sweet cherries, malt, caramel, and brandy. Flavor is sweet, a hint of roastiness, Texture is velvety with fine carbonation. Some alcohol in the finish which is fairly long and sweet with a tinge of bitterness at the very end. Not a session beer although an excellent beer."
"Drinkability: i think this beer is well-crafted, but not something i'll be buying again in the near future. i prefer the ""urban"" bastard."
"Pours a deep obsidian color with a slight beige head that quickly diminishes. Aroma is of bourbon, roasted malt, vanilla, and molasses. Taste is a good combination of vanilla, mollasses and bourbon. Finishes relatively smooth with an easy combination."
"Another great ale from Founders, never had a bad beer from these guys."
"Overall a good sipping beer, especially if you enjoy bourbon."
"M&D - smooth and supremely complex, the end of the taste makes the beer, the caramel, woodiness, it is easily quaffed, one of the better wee heavys ive had, up there with Wet Willy"
"D- The alcohol content, which is obvious in the taste, makes this one a pretty slow drinker for me. Can't say I could really drink more than one. However, this beer gets better and better as it warms."
"This poured a hazy mahogany with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like sweet nutty malt with lots of bourbon and oak, along with some rich caramel and a bit of copper. It tasted like lots of bourbon and oak, with some sweet caramel and nutty malt and cooking vanilla and maple syrup, and a bit of bready yeast. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very powerful beer loaded with bourbon and oak. Nicely done flavor and good body, but it was a bit much to drink freely so I was happier sipping. Age might help tame this beast. In the end, I enjoyed this beer, but it seemed more like a variation on Dirty Bastard, rather than a true improvement."
"D - Wow, this is a pretty hearty brew. You definitely need to sip this one and take all of its aromas and flavors in. I really enjoy the bourbon that lingers between drinks. Another fantastic brew from Founders - I have come to expect nothing but the best from these guys."
"Taste is pretty complex. Scotch taste again is very present. Booze aspect is pretty subtle. Sweet flavors again of chocolate or caramel...malty...VERY good. A little heavy, so not a quick drinking beer."
"I think this is the ultimate winter beer. Full of complex aromas and flavors and enough booze to keep you warm. Pours a ruddy brown color with a small tan head that quickly settles to bubbles around the glass. Some sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is a mixture of vanilla, caramel, scotch, rich malt, and some earthiness. The flavor likewise is complimented nicely by barrel aging. Hints of vanilla and scotch along with the richness of the malt makes this a nice sipper. Alcohol warmth in the finish. Full body with carbonation that gives the beer a nice soft texture. Fits this beer nicely. This beer is a sipper so that limits drinkability."
"I have enjoyed this beer immensely as my Thanksgiving holiday beer."
"Drinkability: The four pack will last the long weekend.... enjoying this at a pace of about 1 per day."
"D: Definitely a sipper. Not something I'd immediately go back to."
"D - It's a pretty good beer, but I wish it had a little more body to match the alcohol and sweetness. A little too boozy and not enough flavor to go along with it."
"Nice sipper. Not too complex on the palate, but still a really interesting brew."
"Deep maroon color with a small head and a touch of lacing. Nose is huge bourbon - delicious, if fairly straightforward. Flavor is similar, huge bourbon and malt. A complex taste - dried fruits, a hint of alcohol spiciness, and then bourbon all over the place again. Absolutely delicious. Body is nice and full, somewhere between syrupy and full bodied. Overall, a delicious one - glad I got to try it. Another winner from Founders."
"The mouthfeel slips a little for me. Such a big beer with heavy flavors has a surprisingly thin mouthfeel. Firm carbonation sizzles my tongue and distracts from my overall enjoyment. I like this brew but think a little more malt flavor and less oak could balance things out better. A tasty sipping beer."
"I had to review this beer...Burnt cranberry color, thick and oily, light bubbles, sappy center. Light and firm head...nose of dark berries, tons of seeds. Fig newtons, to dried strawberries, to chocolate dipped grain. A biscuity body drizzled in fruity, burnt, boozey, caramel spread, finishing dark, bitter chocolate. A touch of robitussen enters as it warms; thats fine, its the best tasting robitussen I ever drank. Excellent ale...don't need really more than 120z a sitting either."
"Pours dark amber/cloudy red sea, dirty penny topped by off white bubbly head. Aroma is frightening: whiskey anyone? Shot of bourbon, wood, spice, some sweet malt. Begins dull sweetness, toffee, woody, molasses, and then wild nights at the bar kick in with JD shots laced with a little sugar that leads into the aftertaste. A dull blade of taste, mild yet heavy. Thick in body with no carb. My face twitches a bit, I'll be honest. Gandalf is chilling in the woods with Leatherface and I got an invitation for dinner."
"This is the first beer that I have drank and felt like I just had a dessert. The richness, flavors and aromas of this beer are incredible. In my opinion, I would enjoy it without the accompaniment of food, but that is me. Sadly, this one is only around in November so stock up while you can."
"D: this is one heck of a little sipper. Very enjoyable and complex beer that I would say could find a permanent spot on cold weather rotation (if I can find it for sale)."
"D: the flavor is really good and it makes me want to keep sipping and sipping, however the alcohol taste make this one hard to drink a lot of"
"This beer is perfect for a cold November night, but one glass is all I can do in a sitting. I still wish I bought more bottles though."
"Notes: delicious fuckin beer! i wait all year for this and i made sure we stocked up big time at the store. one of my favorite beers and probly my favorite seasonal ANYONE puts out! decided to give it a 5 cause i cant imagine a scotch ale getting any better. i can always go back anyway"
"O: Amazing beer that overtakes Dirty Bastard as my favorite offering from Founders. This beer will age well, no doubt about that."
"So glad I gave this one a second shot - am now convinced the first try was a mishandled bottle. Fantastic beer, far better than it's non-barreled counterpart."
"As much as it pains to do, I have to review this beer poorly, and will be waiting until next year's batch to try it again."
"Another excellent beer from Founders. I've said it before & I'll probably repeat myself again, but these clowns could give lessons on barrel aging to anyone & everyone in the industry."
"This lived up to my high expectations. I look forward to trying it again soon with a Havana stogie. If it pairs up as well as I hope, I am going to need to load up on a case of this stuff!"
"Drinkability: All right, here I'll give it a 5. Delicious, with the 10.2% ABV amazingly hidden. I'm not always a fan of bourbon-barrel aged beers, but this is truly top-notch and incredibly easy to drink."
"Overall, I've only tried this once before and it was last year around this time. It was good but this year's batch is outstanding. I really enjoyed this and will be seeking out a four pack soon. Founders +1!"
"The only reason I wouldn't drink a barrel of this in a sitting would be to remain conscious and for the slight alcohol burn."
"D: Hmmm...the bourbon element entices me to want it, but the thin mouthfeel and not to my liking sweetness of this beer make would make me grab for it if it were in the back of the fridge."
"I could drink this all night (and with breakfast in the morning) but that probably wouldn't be wise). As a bourbon lover, (and lover of scotch ale, and Founders Brewing Company) I might be a little biased, but I strongly urge any fan of barrel-aged beer to give this one a shot."
"Overall- this is definitely worthy to pick up."
"Drinkability is great! I think it goes down quite easy for the amount of alcohol. I don't think I would say its a session beer though as it might sneak up on you. This is something I would have one in a night. Something to savor every now and then."
"a nice surprise as im not a wee heavy fan at all...this is one easy drinkin brew...i cannot get over it..damn"
"Dark amber brown, small head that's gone in a flash, no lacing. Aroma is of caramel and apples, chocolate, bourbon and oak. Taste pretty much follows the smell. Lots of caramel and light fruitiness reminiscent of apples, light chocolate, some roastiness, and plenty of warming bourbon. Alcohol is a tad hot, but not bad. Good stuff."
"mouthfeel is medium bodied,doesn't take away much from the beer itself. the beer is a nice sipper,the abv is high which takes away from the drinkability imo. still kinda hot as well,but i like this rough version."
"D: This is TOO drinkable for a 10% bourbon barrel aged brew. The flavor is complex and delicious which keeps me going back for another sip. I really enjoy this one, even if I am having trouble detecting what I am used to in a wee heavy."
"D: You can have only so much 10.2%, but if this was a better brew this would score higher here. This is a nice one, but can't hold up to other bourbon aged beers. Not sure it was worth the $4 paid for the bottle."
"Poured a reddish brown with a small head that almost instantly dissipated to almost nothing. The aroma was musty and boozy. The taste was heavily alcohol, sweet but with a lightly bitter bite to it (may have just been the alcohol). The feel was full bodied and oily, with very little carbonation. Drinkability was decent for a 10+ ABV. Very good beer, perhaps a bit over rated because this time, the bourbon barrel aging did not significantly improve the brew."
"I was totally surpriseed by this beer. At 10.2% and a Wee Heavy one would think it would be a big beer. Not all to my surprise. The beer had a great taste, wonderful texture on the mouth and went down smooth. A ver deceaiving beer, it tastes and is as smooth a s a 5% beer, the alcohol can easily sneak up on you."
"I would have this one again, around a fire with friends on a cold winter night. To be savored slowly."
"A strong, full flavored beer. Complex and a sipper for sure, though I could drink so much more in an ideal setting."
"Similiar to Fouder's Dirty Bastard but with an added kick of the bourbon barrel!"
"This is tremendous!"
"Drinkability- To me this drinkability is extremely high, I am someone is a fan of bourbon so I would have to say this beer is definitely right up my alley, it doesn't over kill you with that bourbon but has alot of it there, it also is very sweet but doesn't over smash you with sugar maintaining a bit of bitterness, this beer to me is actually extremely well crafted and well made, one that while i can I will buy extra of to have around,"
"Dark amber with a creamy two fingers of beige colored foam that slowly melts leaving sheets of lace on the glass. This beer smells fantastic, toasty oak and nutty with vanilla and dark fruity notes. The flavors are pretty bourbon heavy, strong, toasty and woody but well balanced with sweet maltiness, dark fruit and just enough hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is fairly light for the style but not to a fault. A really nice beer for those that enjoy whiskey, I do."
"Backwoods Bastard isn't exactly a miss, but if I was doing this in a lineup I'd use it of an example of a bourbon beer that doesn't quite hit the mark."
"Drinkability is fair. I'm not too big on bourbon bombs and this one appears to be so in its youth. Maybe with 6 months or so on it, it'll be more palatable and drinkable to me. Overall though, a good beer."
"Drinkability: I love the smell and the flavors, but the detracting factors would be the higher ABV, the sweetness gets to be a bit much for my palate and stomach after a bit, and the cost - 14 bones for a 4 pack, while not necessarily unreasonable, would definitely dent the wallet if I wanted to enjoy this more often."
"D: I have to rate the drinkability here very high. I am certainly sad that I didn't have another to follow my first. I can't say that this is a wee heavy but then again there's no wee heavy bourbon barrel category. For what it is, this is a fantastic beer. The art is cool as well."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque dark brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a ring of lacing. The aroma is of strong candy sugar, caramel, bourbon, and wood. It is a very strong aroma, but all the candy sugar makes it seem to lack any sort of complexity. The taste is very malt, as a Scotch Ale should be. It has the same simple candy thing going on as the aroma, and although it is still strong it isn't as dominant as it is in the aroma. Still it makes the taste come across as simple. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is not doing it for me. I'm not sure if extra sugar was added to boost fermentation, and subsequently ABV, but is sure seems like it. And the result is a beer that taste/smells like candy aged in bourbon barrels, instead of Scotch Ale aged in bourbon barrels. I am certain I will not drink this again, and am wondering what I should do with the other three bottles I have. Maybe some of that sugar will mellow out with time."
"D- I want more of this. Aside from the booziness brought on by the bourbon this is really drinkable."
"Note to self: Stop buying singles of Founders' beers; every single time I regret it and wish I had bought the 4-pack."
"(D)- A very good beer. I was expecting something extremely potent (it is!) but in a much more delicate/complex sense. The oak bourbon barrels really makes this brew shine. If it tastes this good fresh, this should be really interesting with a year of age on it. Well done, once again Founders!"
"Future outlook: Decent and interesting, but didn't knock my socks off. Probably won't merit a repeat purchase."
"12 oz, 2008. Cloudy dark amber/brown/orange pour. Minimal cream head, disappears quickly, but sticks nicely. Heavy aroma of charred oak. Some malt and caramel/toffee and booze. Taste is excellent and smooth and really comes out as it warms. Oak and bourbon, vanilla, toffee, some charred peat, a little vanilla and just hints of vinuous fruits. A warming sipper, good medium body. Finishes a little ashy bitter, with some warming whishy barrel. Pretty darn good wee heavy. Year of age has brought out some refinement and mellowed the heat a bit. It was very good fresh though as well."
"Other than the very strong taste of the bourbon, the 10+% alcohol is surprisingly well masked, and it goes down rather smoothly. I had to give this one time to warm up, which only revealed its depth and flavorful creativity that much more, but it wasn't easy to do! This would be amazing with some dark raisin toast spread with bleu cheese."
"Another great beer from Founders. This is one of the better BA beers I have tried in a long time. Perfect for a cold night."
"D:Very enjoyable, though i couldn't drink too many at one sitting, all in all a great Scotch Ale that i would buy again."
"Drinkability is moderat. The flavor profile is pleasing, but not overwhelmingly good. The moutfeel was the major flaw in the beer, at least to me. The could definitely ramp up the complexity of the beer as well. All in all a decent effort, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again."
"Enjoyed with a nice cigar to round it all out."
"Drinkability: Very high. I love it. The last one of my four pack. I'll buy another."
"I poured a bottle to find a deep maroon, almost purple color. It has only a finger of head ontop with a very faint ring of lace remaining on top of the brew. It smells of vanilla, bourbon, coconut, and caramel. Fairly intense but I enjoy it. Quite mellow tasting now with the sweetness and bourbon blending quite nicely together. The finish is very bourbony, but quite enjoyable. Much lighter than expected and one that continues to get better as it warms up"
"Full bodied with a nice roasted malt flavor that is kind of nutty with a big oak, vanilla and whiskey presence. Chocolate malt, caramel, toffee, burnt toast and oatmeal notes are also detectable. Kind of sweet up front with a silky malt backbone with a very nice touch of bourbon and a bitter dry finish."
"F: Finishes slightly dry but still semi sweet. The alcohol leaves a fresh clean feeling in the mouth like you just finished mouthwash. The vanilla and oak also seem to stick around for a little while adding some nice lingering tastes in the memory. The bourbon also remains, but much less than before. It adds some bitter qualities that seem to stem from some possible hops. The creamy feel and taste also lingered for a little bit. Some oak esters stick around your tongue, or my tongue since I'm the one tasting it dammit. Damn this is such an awesomely awesome beer!"
"That said, this is still fairly drinkable - though, a sipper nonetheless. No rough edges, no burn, not overwhelming on any front, well integrated, bold."
"Thanks RyanC84!"
"Dangerously drinkable. I can see why people rave over it. I think I prefer this to Founders Dirty Bastard, but honestly, I'll drink anything from this brewery."
"Tremendously drinkable. alcohol is masked. Enjoyable and easy to drink."
"I don't think founders can make a bad beer. Simply amazing as always. Vanilla times ten. Not so much a bourbon touch as it is a vanilla monster. Good beer though."
"It seems the label is different from the picture, I like the new label better. Pours a cloudy brown color with very little head and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of chocolate, caramel, toffee, nutty, and alcoholic notes with a touch of bourbon. Smells great. The flavor is all malts, no trace of hops here. Fairly sweet with a pretty heavy bourbon character. Chocolate and toffee compliment the bourbon very well. The body is quite full and the drinkability is pretty good for the level of alcohol."
"D - This is a great tasting brew. Potent and rich."
"D - Have one of theese and you will be good for a while. No need to rush to finnish this one."
"Could still use some age to mellow more. Despite its high marks on aroma and taste, a little more of a straight-line-graph-effect could probably help this ale out a bit more. Definitely a sipping and savoring brew that warms out well."
"D- great hides the 10% AVB quite well i could see my self having another"
"Drinkability: Way too deceptively drinkable at over 10%. I knew I should've picked up a 4-pack instead of a bottle. Seek this out, as it seems to be a younger, lighter cousin of KBS in my opinion."
"Note - Overall, while still a world class brew, this bottle version is a slight step down from the draft version... The bottle version seems to be slightly more dominated by the booziness and some the terrific complexities of the draft versoin tend to get lost..."
"Drinkability - I would like this even more if the straight alcohol flavor was more subtle, and the bourbon and malty flavors were stronger. It still a very enjoyable beer, even with all the floaters in the glass."
"I usually do not care for Scotch Ales as they tend to be overly sweet and cloying. But this brew does not go overboard on the sweetness and I think the barrel aging did wonders for this one. It is seasonal, I believe, but go out of your way to get some when it is available. Great brew."
"drinkability is good even at 10.2% but i would not drink more 1"
"Thanks, Craytonic!"
"This bourbon flavored aged ale pours brown with a nice tan head. Lovely soft burnt carmel nose, with hints of fruited toffee. Smokey-campfire malty flavors with dried fruit flavors and characteristics. Desireable creamy fruit and malty mouth and long on hops in the finish. Excellent character and quality."
"Drinkability is really good, a tasty strong ale, basically an English style BW by my book, but enjoyable for sure. This bottle is on the newer side, but I'm sure it will age well. The funny thing is I just remembered that it was bourbon barrel aged. Didn't get much of that. Some vanilla from the oak though, which is really all I want from the barrel anyways."
"Poured up a nice medium brown colour with a cream coloured head. Smell is sweet malts, maybe a bit of dark fruit (figs?), and some mild, earthy hops. Taste was dominated by sweet malts with a bit of hop bitterness, which was nice. Alcohol was somewhat assertive, which hurt drinkability. Mouthfeel is pleasant and about average for the style. A well crafted brew, but I couldn't have more than say, maybe 2 of these in a sitting."
"Overall a very nice brew. Im loving these bourbon aged wee heavies these days. Berkshires has got to be my favorite out there but this one probably takes second, as far as bourbon aged wee heavies go. Not for the faint of heart or the weak of palate. Seems like a prime cellar candidate to me. Another winner from Founders."
"D: Pretty drinkable, and sips especially quickly for a beer with so much bourbon."
"Drinkability is nice and again, benefits from some time to mellow."
"D- Easy to drink for sure. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Bleh."
"They weren't kidding about this one being a ""kick-back sipper."" Huge alcohol presence in this one. You have got to like whiskey if you want to enjoy this offering. I think it's very much worth ordering if you see it on tap, and I always do (order it that is)."
"Overall a very good beer, interested in aging to see how it mellows out."
"Great beer. Not too sweet as the oak dries it up a bit. The Bourbon is significant but not overbearing. Great balance and quite rounded in character."
"This is an interesting take on a Wee Heavy/Scotch Ale and I do like it. I'm not sure if I would get it again, but I definitely recommend it if you can get your hands on it - well worth the try!"
"I can see how some people like this beer, for me, it's like Mordor where the very air you breathe is poison."
"Pours a cloudy, brown/red. Nose is caramel; dark fruits like raisin or cranberry creating tartness; chocolate; toffee. Flavor builds the nose to add creamy vanilla, sweetness, and a tart, carbonated bite on the finish. The vanilla and ""oakiness"" has a welcome similarity to the Kentucky Breakfast Stout."
"I really enjoy both this and Dirty Bastard, although this is better."
"D :: I qualify this as a sipping beer. I really enjoyed it and it could be a good after dinner drink. Keep in mind the ABV; it will sneak up on you."
"Drank one, could drink another."
"A unique brew with a good flavor decinetly worth a try"
"Pours a tawny deep maroon. Very thick and cloudy (yeast?). No light comes through this beer at all. Smells of caramel, chocolate, oak, licorice, molasses. This is a full nose for sure. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, almost chewable. Yet there was a slight crispness to it. Flavor is of syrup, booze, some woodsy notes, and big bourbon smack. This wasn't what I expected at all. Way too boozy and thick for my liking. Interesting beer."
"single from 6-12 Market, Raleigh, NC"
"The beer stood up to everything we ate and seemed to get better as the glass went on. I had intended to keep trying different things they had on tap but this beer stopped me and demanded a second. The ABV is the only thing that would prevent me from downing a 6 pack per sitting."
"Pours a cloudy copper brown in me allagash tulip glass. Why must Founders use twist off caps? A scant head but a suprising level of carbonation with a swirl or two. Part of a trade with Hoppymeal. A noticable bourbony nose. Not overwhelming, mind you with a caramel malt base. Big bourbon influence in the taste to go along with a Jim Beam-like alcohol burn in the finish. Very carbonated brew with an alcohol burn that won't quit. It' big at 10.2 abv . The yeast clouds the glass. A little vanilla. Nice brew. A sipper."
"The mouthfeel is medium-full and the finish still has that spicy bite. The alcohol is fairly hidden and the the tobacco seems to come out as the beer warms."
"3.5 D: Though I enjoy a wee heavy/barleywine/olde ale now and again, I haven't found one that I find very drinkable."
"Overall- My favorite Wee Heavy/Scotch ale and was lucky enough to drink quite a bit of it in 2008"
"This seemingly perfectly named beer will only grow better with time. I will be making a beeline to my beer store to secure a four-pack for my cellar. In the meantime, this has gotten me even more excited(if possible) about the Kentucky Breakfast Stout chilling in my fridge. Well done Founders."
"A very interesting beer and another fun drinker from Founders."
"Drinkability - A sipper not really worth the trouble in my book. However if you're a fan of Scotch Ale's this is something interesting you should try."
"The un-oaked version of this is much better."
"D: Good once. Next."
"Drink up and enjoy!"
"Pours an almost blackish body with a one-finger tan head that stickss around for awhile. A rich, thick malt smell of toasted, maple, caramel, molasses, that whiskey smell (oak cask, bourbon...) mixed w/ sour/tart fruits - reminds me of a barleywine the smell is that strong. A thick, full-bodied beer that is strong and a little syrupy/sticky. The malt taste is excellent with cocoa, caramel, toffee, coffee bean, oak, vanilla along w/ minor fruit flavors like cherry (tart fruit). Overall I'd say this is a smooth and creamy scotch ale, but it does have a little dryness in it thanks to that really high ABV, which is mostly hidden. This is a grat sipper to relax with, but I couldn't session this it's so thick and strong."
"Very drinkable. So well balanced and smooth. It's hard to believe that this has 10.2% ABV. Where is it? All that I get is a nice mellow warmth, in my belly. One of the best 'hidden ABV' brews that I know of."
"Overall, fantastic beer."
"this is quite drinkable for what it is. but not something i'd really wanna drink more than one of per session... ok, maybe two. a sipper for certain. guess i'll need to find some fancy snifters or tulips for next time."
"A nice little scotch, gotten in trade. Pours medium with good lasting white head, tons of lace.Aroma is decent bourbon. Mouthfeel is easy, average and smooth, good bourbon taste, whiskeyish not too corny, not in-your-face that is well integrated and woody. Very drinkable."
"D - Overall, I was really impressed with this offering from Founders. Backwoods Bastard boasts plenty of borubon flavor with a big vanilla presence, resulting in a bourbon barrel aged brew that isn't too boozy. Drinkability is fantastic for a 9.2% beer."
"Founders can't miss with me. Bring on Kentucky Breakfast Stout!"
"An interesting well done beer, complex in character and drinkable to boot. Slightly sweet at the finish and high in ABV but otherwise flawless."
"Normall I don't care for whiskey/bourbon barrel aged ales, but I did like this one. The whiskey flavor was not quite overpowering and the smokiness of the scotch ale shone through nicely."
"D: The only place where this loses points is the ABV. The 10.2% it clocks in at this year (2008) is pretty well hidden but a few could easily catch up to you. I love this beer though and plan on stocking up on the next release!"
"I could put back a few of these, delicious. Another impressive offering from founders."
"Now, this is a genuinely bourbon-influenced beverage. I've noticed it's different than the wee-heavy in the descriptor above, if for nothing else than the ABV on this joker is 10.2%. As such, I don't recommend you funnel this one. Tell ya what, though--this beer is unique and tasty enough to include in any tasting. I think it demonstrates a little about how versatile a beer can be. That being said, I probably won't ever drink two back-to-back. I will, however, strive to always keep one on hand."
"D: The ABV is well hidden in this one. It smells and tastes of bourbon, but there is no alcohol burn for a 9.2% beer at all. It is a bit of a sipper, but that's because you want to enjoy each sip."
"This is a nice sipper, to say the least. A tasty maltiness combined with bourbon. I'm a happy man to have tried this one!"
"D - Good flavor and drinkability, but nothing amazing in this one. Still, its worth trying especially if you are into barrel aged ales and/or scotch ales."
"D: Oh my. I had to keep myself in check and stop myself from killing this in a few gulps. For such a big beer with such big flavors, it is damned easy drinking. Goes down so easy and sits very nice. I just think that Founders did a great job of keeping these boozy bourbon flavors in check and from getting out of control. So damned good. Thanks, Larry. Love this beer."
"Pours a solid brown color that glows a bright orange in the light from underneath my Dogfish snifter. A small head forms and quickly disappears leaving only a ring, oblong in thickness. I could sit and smell this beer all day long. Complex notes of vanilla, sweet malt, butter scotch, root beer barrel candy, coconut, subtle wet wood, cream soda, caramel and a tame whiff of lightly astringent alcohol. Amazing. The beer tastes just as good as it smells, a lot of the same combinations and layers of its aroma come through in flavor. Although this is definitely a sipper the alcohol is very well hidden behind the deep flavor profile. Full bodied with very light carbonation that barely pricks the tongue. Backwoods Bastard drinks like poetry and receives one of my highest recommendations."
"D: This beer is tasty. I am a huge fan of bourbon barrel beers and this falls into that catagory easily."
"D- Not wild about the heavy pina colada scent and taste. However that aside a solid beer well worth trying."
"Drinkability is ok despite the mouthfeel problems. Decent beer despite some problems."
"If your a Dirty Bastard fan, this is definitely a must try."
"Super sweet, lots of whiskey...not as complex as it should be since the bourbon flavors pretty much mask most of the malt. Too sweet to drink more than one."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full in body. I have to say I ""don't get"" this one. Seem one dimensional to me. Too much up front bourbon flavor. I prefer muted bourbon notes, not feeling like I'm drinking a mixed drink."
"Good brew."
"One would hope that this beer would be enjoyed after one has becom acquainted with dirty bastard, as there are obvioisly many more similarities than differences. Unless one is recently-familiar with DB, the differences may go unnoticed altogether. Basically, you don't really need to write a full review on this, but rather add some comments onto a DB review.. The bourbon presence is definitely noticeable and a nice touch. The flavor (and aroma) are both a bit more complex with whiskey and bourbon notes, as well as hints of vanilla and sweetened chocolate. Overall, in many ways it is very similar to DB and the other prominent Wee Heavys (skullsplitter, etc), except the brown liquor presence adds extra boozey warmth while at the same time slightly decreasing the drinkability as the sweetness and liquor-like qualities could get tiring after your second or even first bottle. It certanly puts the ""scotch"" in scotch ale, though for all it's deliciousness and highlights (which, like DB there certainly are many) it seems as though it's not quite perfect and falls just short of a solid A."
"As I began, I love Founders brews but this one doesn't do it for me. I find this one interesting because I really love fresh GI BCS. However, the big difference for me is I can taste the beer in BCS but I can't with this one. Maybe it needs more time on it?"
"Well, I'm finally getting around to reviewing this one after enjoying it quite a few times. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my nonic pint glass a rich dark brown color with a good two fingers of foam. Smells and tastes of oak, vanilla, bourbon and caramel malts. Very rich in body with medium carbonation. What a great sipping beer on a cool night. Looking forward to my next one."
"Good brew. I want a couple more so they can have some time in the cellar. I would say at least a year."
"On tap at Founders,served in a snifter. A ruby/purple color with a thin white cap that fades quickly and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is vanilla, oak,alcohol(Burbon)and maybe even some dry barly grain. Flavor is very earthy peaty,lots of burbon notes oak,vanilla,alcohol,rye bread,brown sugar,very complex.Full mouthfeel,medium carbonation,dry boozy finish. Very good brew if you like burbon but not something that I would drink more than one of at a sitting."
"Not for the timid, but very, very good."
"I look forward to seeing how these age over months and years."
"D- I really like this brew a lot just don't think I could have too many of them at one sitting but still find very easy to drink. Highly recommendend."
"D - Of all the whiskey infused ales out there, this one is my favorite. Its great, combining to of the great things I like, and in a almost perfect way"
"Drinkability? Its too drinkable. And very very strong. Sip with care. Enjoy."
"D- It's a good sipper. The robust flavor makes me want to try it again. I'd suggest it to any Scotch Ale fan."
"Overall, this is a nice beer to have on a cold winter night like tonight, but not one I could drink all the time. Grab it if you have access."
"I had this again off the tap on Jan. 17, 2013, and I would score it exactly the same."
"D: I would love a lifetime supply of this brew. I've purchased it on several occasions, and I feel that it is well worth seeking out. Give it a try."
"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight bourbon notes, with some toffee. The taste is very nice, malty, slightly sweet, very nice bourbon notes, and some toffee. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, thanks for the extra Brian."
"D: I don't know. For as much as I enjoyed the beer I just didn't want another. I like bourbon aged beers (including KBS/oaked aged yeti/etc) and this is the first one I wasn't willing and ready to have another."
"D: I suppose i could drive to mass for this beer, which is becoming a distinct and imminent possibility. I would love to have this in my fridge at all times."
"D- If it wasn't for the 10.2% I could drink this all night. However...I think two is my limit. I still call it drinkable!"
"D: Above average for the abv."
"I already miss this beer and can't wait for it to come around again. I have like 3 left and I'll have to ration them till next year I guess!"
"This beer was excellent and a definite recommendation."
"Taste is pretty big - molasses, syrupy, caramel, chocolate, and maybe some cherry. Alcohol is definitely noticeable (my bottle says 10.2%). The bottle says 50Ibus, but I don't taste much bitterness."
"Overall, a fun, slow sipper. I wish I had more."
"Overall: Its nice to find an oak-aged beer that isn't a stout. This is a very good oaked beer that shows the wood and vanilla characteristics typical of such beers without losing proportion."
"Hazy, almost but not quite murky, amber/brown color with insubstantial white head. Taste is really nice caramel, malt, toffee, and bourbon. Wow is this a nice-drinking brew. Really nice to be able to just buy 12 ounce bottles of a delicious bourbon barrel aged Scottish Ale. Contrast this with so many brewers that only sell this caliber of product in a wax topped 750 ml bottle for a lot more money. Medium bodied, medium/low carbonation, slightly sticky. I could easily have another."
"D- The more I acquaint myself to them the more I am loving Scotch Ales. This is a darn good one. The bourbon is a perfect compliment to this beer and I think its great. The alcohol is definitely not hidden...but it is not obnoxious either. Wonderful and definitely my favorite Founder's brew! IMO, it easily Trumps Breakfast Stout and KBS. Wasn't expecting this to be so good!"
"Overall, a heck of a lot better than I remember. I didn't think I would enjoy this Bastard as much as I have. A real treat, and now I know, as far as my tastes go, I should get a 4-pack, and hold of drinking it for at least 6 months. Cheers!"
"The beer is very smooth, creamy, and easy to drink, one. I am not sure that I could handle too many of this at one go. That is the only reason for the slightly lower drinkability score. Overall, a very good beer, one that I hope to encounter many more times."
"*Trader's Note: Many thanks to hoppymeal for this one."
"D: Almost too drinkable. Very nice beer."
"D: Awesome. This one gives no hint at the ABV it packs. I had the base beer Dirty Bastard and was not impressed. Put on wood this beer becomes quite possibly the best of the style."
"Otherwise, unique, good stuff..."
"...abv makes this a sipper but the body does not..."
"Dark burgandy. Thin beige head dissipates quickly. Not much for lace, but not much expected for 10.2%. Nice aroma of caramel and bourbon like vanilla notes and a little dark cherry. Definitely smells like a winner. Nice warmth to this beer. Not too boozy, which is good, but rather a ""glow"" to it. And the bourbon is noticeable in the alcohol notes. Nice little chocolate and caramel notes on the buds. A little bitterness coming from the 50 IBUs. This makes for a nice little nightcap. A sipper."
"This is my first time trying this and i very much enjoyed it, BB is worth the dollars. The barrel aging in this one is spot on. I was expecting mostly bourbon but recieved much more. I drank this to quickly. Worth seeking out, will get again!!"
"Thanks to Bowman (not a BA) for sharing a bottle. This is a darned tasty and drinkable beer. I'm taking it as a sipper, but I could certainly down it faster were I in a hurry. The aroma has smooth oak and mild vanilla bourbon while mellow chocolate notes and burnt caramel come out in the back of the flavor. It drinks like a balanced bourbon-beer candy drink. It's not the most complex BB beer, but it's a fine example of what a barrel can do."
"3.5/3/2.5/2.5/2.5"
"Overall, this was a very well balanced beer. I really enjoyed the creaminess and smoothness. I don't care for huge bourbon flavors in my beer, but this one was very enjoyable."
" Drinkability seems to be good- very smooth and pleasantly flavored lead this to go down pretty easy. Not the syrupy-ness of stouts-slash-quads or even some strong dark ales. The barrel aging has really smoothed this out, only the problem seems to be that the barrel is one of the dominant flavors of the beer; instead of enhancing it it seems to have completely altered it into a different beer. Not sure if that's a good thing or not. Still, really good effort from Founders that proves to be a welcome to the thick winter beer staples [barley wines and stouts] that often are heavy and leave coating on the palate, this is pretty clean."
"Quite full bodied and heavy on the tongue. Overall a semi interesting beer due to the oak aging but I think this was a relatively fresh bottle and I would hope a few months in a cellar would allow this beer to come together and blend the independent flavors that seem unfriendly to each other now. A 4 for flavor is being generous, but i think it will age into that number or better with some time."
"An interesting and engaging ale!"
"Poured a light cloudy deep amber color with a small foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of scotch and malt. Taste is a fine mix betwen some scotch notes with some deep sweet marley with some light dry fruit notes. Malt definitely mellowed it out a little. Full body with average carbonation and no alcohol ester where noticeable. Bourbon is a little to noticable. Mine as well take a shot. Definitely a unique brew. Still very solid beer as usual from this brewery."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Rich caramel malt flavors meet whiskey heat. Medium in body, low carbonation. Earthy bitter finish, hints of burnt grain. Light tannins. Really nice stuff."
"This was a well-made beer that definitely was not my favorite. Just too boozy, with more candy sweetness than I'd prefer. Another reviewer said ""If you don't like bourbon, I'd try something else"". I guess that's the thing. I DO like bourbon, but not when I'm drinking beer. If I want a nice bourbon I'll pour myself a glass. I think this beer just sort of muddied the line instead of just being the best beer it could be."
"M/D: Full bodied, a little creamy with a slight prick on the tongue from carbonation. Decent drinkability, a sipper but good enough to have a couple of."
"Tastes nicely tannicked oak with supporting sweet and clean alcohol burn. Not much malt flavor and esters are mild. A bit of fig and some caramel bordering on toffee. Vanilla is tame and some dreid cherry. Acid is a bot stronger than I'd like and a soured character is also distracting. Nice creamy md-thick mouthfeel and too much carbonation for the style."
"I am quite surprised at how easy this is to drink considering the ABV, but it is tasty and I will be having this beer again."
"Bottle: Poured a lightly cloudy deep amber color ale with a small foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of bourbon and sweet malt dominates. Taste is a fine mix betwen some bourbon notes with some deep sweet marley with some light dry fruit notes. Full body with average carbonation and no alcohol ester where noticeable. Bourbon might be slightly too present and somewhat overshadows the malt but still very solid beer from this fine brewery."
"Nice one, but not great. Perhaps a bit too thin."
"D - I was craving this beer tonight - wanted something with bourbon, wood, and some alcohol. And I'm big on wee heavies...love this beer and I will get some every year."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a murky, pond water brown with a tiny head brown head that left no lacing. The aroma reminds me of the best qualities of Bourbon. Caramel, vanilla and oak. The trinity so to speak. That's all that the nose consists of. The flavor is heavy on the caramel/toffee notes, with vanilla, oak, and a hint of butterscotch. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and the carbonation, should be amped up just a bit. This is a good beer, one that I would be happy to imbibe again."
"D - Certainly better than ""Dirty Bastard," the barrel aging has done good things for this beer; but even barrel aging can't make a medicore beer great. The biggest flaw is with the body which just isn't working for a huge wee-heavy. Overall a rich and complex beer."
"vanilla, malts and woody hints. I wish I would have bought more now. Oh well. Nicely done."
"Thanks to tburkhart for this one."
"D: A very good sipper and quite tasty. Worth picking up."
"The beer pours a cool ruby, almost purple color, with a limited tanish white head. Initial aroma is mostly alcohol/whiskey with a bit of an earthy undertone. The taste is very caramel sweet with a nice bite of alcohol and a touch of vanilla. Great smooth mouthfeel esp. for 10% ABV. Definitely something I would drink again."
"well this is a special beer which retains much of the whisky flavor. very different and creamy."
"D: Overall, this is a beer that is way too drinkable for its abv. Very enjoyable, especially on a rainy night getting ready for the holidays. If i weren't told that this is so alcoholic I may have been in trouble! A god pick."
"This beer is an excellent one for a cold night by the fire. Just a bit too sweet and warming to garner a high drinkability score, but certainly worth a try, and a great sipper to share with friends."
"I thought the beer was spot on for its style in terms of taste and mouthfeel. Some scotch ales come out of the bottle a little thin, but I though this one nailed it. A very enjoyable beer and perfect for a cold night."
"A great beer all around."
"mouthfeel is oily and delicious, smooth and creamy flavors mashed with alcohol, age on this would be delicious even though bourbon overtakes everything, mmmm"
"Drinkability is low. This one is almost up there with triple bock, though this at least tastes like something someone (not me) would want to drink. One of the few beers I actually poured out. I was very disappointed in this one, but I probably shouldn't have been so surprised. If you like bourbon, you will probably like this but I still think the dirty bastard is a far superior brew. At least I got a cool bottle out of it (the newer style label)."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (2008 vintage with the new artwork) and served in a snifter. This beer poured a dark, murky mahogany brown with a thin head that lingered for a bit, leaving behind some decent lacing. The aroma consisted of slightly vinous, boozy dark fruits, burnt caramel, brown sugar, and maybe a hint of maple syrup. The flavor was like a piece of hard caramel candy soaked in bourbon. The flavors work really well together. Rich, malty caramel and brown sugar with a mellow, boozy bourbon note. The mouthfeel was thick, full-bodied and had very mild carbonation. Just a bit sticky. A really tasty sipper!"
"D - This is damn enjoyable and pretty easy to drink. Yet another awesome beer from Founders. Why won't they distribute to Texas :("
"Nice deep mahogany color with sparkling red tinges. Thin creamy off white head that trails just a little bit of lacing. Drank this fairly warm and the smells were very bold. Lots of bourbon with some floral hop notes very faintly in the background. Also some sweet maple syrup notes. Bourbon again comes to front of the taste, it somehow manages to dominate but not give any burn on the way down. Thick mouth. This one is a good one to sip on a cold winter night by the fire with a book. Across the board good beer but i just couldn't bump it to the exceptional level."
"Pours a semi cloudy copper with a very small beige head. Aroma is medium sweet with grapefruit, bourbon, smoky and caramelization. Flavor is grapefruit, orange, caramel and smoky with some alcohol detected. Medium to full body, sticky texture. Finishes somewhat hot, low carbonation."
"D: Very drinkable for the style, not something I'd necessarily want to drink more than one of or frequently, but great balance of big flavors makes this a great offering."
"Dangerously drinkable. It is so smooth. I wanted another two bottles of this to sip on all night. Great beer for a cold evening."
"Best aromatics of any bourbon barrel aged ale that I've tried that hasn't been a stout. (Yeah, I know that's kind of weird.) Bourbon, vanilla, caramel and toffee are all present in the aroma of this beer, along with a bit of oak and maybe even leather. The combination of these scents is what really makes these introducing. The word I'm searching for is probably nuance. It's a nuanced character. What you smell is also what you get in tasting this beer along with an extraordinarily smooth mouthfeel. I like the way all the aforementioned flavors (and some others) mix in this beer. The flavors show themselves, then hide, then come back in the finish. Simple caramel maltiness starts things out, then a there's a big smack of toffee; make that a huge smack of toffee, followed by a grainy bourbon flavor and then a port-like tawny character making for a rich, warming finish. As the beer warmed up I noticed a sort of coffee with cream flavor in the finish. Overall, a complex and very well made ale."
"It's smooth alright. I don't really know what else to say here. I like it. I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it. Is this really a scotch ale?"
"this beer is definitely worth a try...if your a whiskey drinker you will love this beer ...i sure did"
"D- Not my style, but could drink one or two on a cold winter night."
"Poured a slightly hazy brownish amber with a medium creamy light tan head that left some nice lacing. Aroma of dark malts,vanilla,oak, dark malts,caramel and bourbon. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel with flavors of vanilla, caramel malt, and oak, with the bourbon enhancng the flavor but not overpowering it. very nice finish that is slightly bitter and warming. A perfect beer to drink on a cold michigan evening."
"BWB pours slightly turbid showcasing a rich brown color. A firm pour produced a 1/2"" head that settles fairly quickly to a nice foam skin. Small patches of lacing are present. When cold the aroma is that of mainly caramel but as it warms a whole range of scents poke through - vanilla, bourbon, figs, a damp earthiness or mustiness and butterscotch - WOW! The taste does not disappoint either - many of the same smells follow through to the palate - this is a full flavor beer with caramel malts, bourbon and figs. The mouthfeel is spot on - not too heavy or light though it could use a bit more carbonation for more punch. If it weren't for the high ABV, I could easily have 2 or 3 of these beers in a night. A lot of bourbon-based beers become ponderous to me after a few sips - not this beer. Good stuff from Founders."
"This beer is hits every end of the spectrum for me. The appearance was nice. A deep cloudy brown with a few bubbles and no head. Aroma was absolutely perfect. Strong vanilla dominates with oak and bourbon intertwined. Taste was a little thin. The taste reminds me of the days when I first started drinking in bars. It tastes EXACTLY like a Jack and Coke that has been sitting too long with ice in it and got watered down. This is because the beer lacks any HINT of carbonation. With some carbonation this beer could be an A. I don't remember 07s being this flat. Maybe it's just the bottle I had."
"The flavor starts out with a sharp bourbon bite of oak and booze that quickly gives way to creamy vanilla and scotch malts. Candy-apple molasses and brown sugars slide through for a deliciously sweet finish. Aftertaste is more vanilla and a boozy warmth that continues all the way to the stomach. The mouthfeel is creamy, perfectly carbonated, and slightly viscous--but not so thick that it's tough to drink. All in all, an impressive Scotch Ale from the ""Bastards"" at Founder's. Me likey."
"A flavorful experience... but it is a bit too intensely alcoholy and sweet for me."
"at 14$ or so for four this isn't something i'm going to be drinking all the time but its a great alternative to a winter warmer, which tend to be too rich for my taste. if your sick of stouts this could be your new favorite seasonal."
"The mouthfeel decent. A little watery but very in tune with the style. I don't know how drinkable this one is with over 9% ABV and $16 a four pack but I cannot slam them for either considering the awesome flavor!"
"there is nothing wrong with this beer, im just not acclimated to whiskey"
"As a bourbon fan, this is a winner. I have to be honest, I bought a 4 pack and now I am considering running out to get another."
"D - Extremely drinkable, as most have said here, for a 10 percenter."
"Drinkability: Oh, it's quite good. Potent, sure, but good! If ever anyone has some extra bottles of Backwoods Bastard they're looking to get rid of count me in."
"D= Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV and the relatively strong bourbon barrel quality. I think that malty Scottish ales work pretty well in bourbon barrels and this is no exception!"
"Backwoods Bastard is on the full-bodied side with milky feel and mild carbonation. Alarmingly drinkable for a 10.2 percenter."
"Ahh the Lions,enough said.Backwoods Bastard poured into a small tulip glass an awesome deep mahogany with with amber hue,a tight formed clingy tannish colored head atop,great clarity and a great pour.Deep complex malt aromas with the bourbon barrel showing through,vanilla and cherry notes dominate with some wood and a tinge of sweet alcohol.Obviously not a beer to start turkey day with but I did,its a sipper but not a head knocker.Flavors are pretty sweet up front with vanill,caramel and cherry flavors dominating,the bourbon flavor is prevelent but not overpowering,theere is a noticeablr drying leafy finish.A great beer,like I said asipper but it wont slow you down to much,a few of these and I might enjoy the Lions game."
"The rich aroma, luscious flavors, and low carbonation make this a pleasure to drink. But the heat of the alcohol does become a bit distracting towards the end. I'm glad this is available in 12 oz. bottles. Anything larger would be just too much."
"Awesome extra from Bigdaddywil. Very dark reddish amber, almost brown. A one finger, off-white head lingers for a short minute. The lacing disappears quickly. Immediate slap in the face (nostrils) from the bourbon. Nice. Huge sugary malt notes in the nose with some caramel and brown sugar. Initial taste is sweet and malty bourbon, with some caramel and vanilla as well. Very boozy and delicious. The finish is remarkable. Long bourbon alcohol finish that lingers, imparting a sticky coating to the back of the tongue. Full bodied with good carbonation. Backwoods Bastard leaves my mouth dry and wanting another drink."
"As it continues to warm some slight dark fruit notes come out but really this beer basically tastes like watered down sweet bourbon...I am starting to think that my notes above took a bit of digging to detect."
"Awesome beer. The strong ale with a vanilla kick really appeals to me. Wait for the snow to fall and grab a couple of these for the evening. Trust me, you'll enjoy it."
"Drinkability: If you love bourbon, you will love this beer. I will have to get some more."
"Drinkability - this is one to cherish IMO. Aging a few is a must."
"On tap @ the Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. In a snifter, this one sits in all its dark dark amber splendor. Dark tan head, fine wispy lacing. Nose of smoke, berries, vanilla. Very tasty, sipper. More smoke, some cola, dark grains, raisins. Perhaps a bit thin mouthfeel wise to match the ABV and the complexity lurking around here. More tasty, high quality and interesting beer from Founders."
"Whiskey lovers will enjoy this beer because that is what dominates both aroma and flavor. There are other aspects that make it interesting and it is definitely flavorful."
"Pours a caramel stream with a thin sheet of off white head. Smells mostly of bourbon, oak, vanilla, and alcohol. Tastes like malt, caramel, oak, vanilla, some raisin I think. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but could be less carbonated still. You can smell the alcohol, but you can't feel it much."
"D: This is a likable, drinkable beer, especially on a cold, cold night."
"Not bad, but could use significant improvement. Goose Island Bourbon County Stout, this isn't."
"First comes malt, second comes malt, and third comes the malt, always malty, nutty, and earthy sweet. Lord, I wonder what the wort smells like as it boils! Anyway, this malty bastard also sports a seriously buff ABV that heats and hazes. Still, it drinks happily, if malt be your thing. So I'm not sure if I mentioned malt, but it is malty, and damned proud of it. Enjoy it, friends, for the no-airs prideful creation it is."
"Drinkability: Many thanks to afterexile for this stellar brew, and I was very impressed by it. Founder's has continually managed to blow me away, and this beer's no exception. Drinkability suffers slightly from the heat and the nearly-double digit abv%, but that's alright. It's still an expertly constructed beer, flavorful, wonderfully aromatic, well-integrated with all the bourbon notes and whatnot, and very drinkable despite the high alcohol. Definitely recommended."
"Glad I tried this, but 1 would have done just fine"
"Drinability- This beer is really smooth and easy drinking and does a great job of covering the alcohol. It's not big and brash like I was expecting but in the end, I think that turned out to be a good thing. The barrel aging may have added a bit of one dimensionality but it's still tasty. Recommended for sure!"
"Nice stuff!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. The bottle reads ""50 IBU's"" and ""10.2%"" around the top of the bottle's neck label. Appearance is a semi-translucent dirty dark brown with a thick foamy head of light tan that is a full two fingers high before slowly falling back to a moderate ring of lace. Aroma is rich, full of oakiness and vanilla, bourbon comes through strong. Also notes of earthy grains and smokiness, sweet dark fruits also present. The taste opens with a big warming bourbon flavor that makes a transition to the vanilla and smoky oak flavors, buttery diacteyl notes, slightest hint towards the big abv% which this beer hides quite well. Aftertaste is lightly sweet but clean. Mouthfeel is silken-smooth, lightly carbonated with a medium body, syrupy in texture, coats the mouth and throat. Drinkability is outstanding for a 10% brew, you are tempted to follow one with another as wonderful as this beer is. This is a beer you sit and sip quietly to appreciate; I would suggest limiting it to one of these per sitting. Easily one of my top ten, highly recommend trying, definitely worth the higher price tag."
"Head was a creamy dirty blonde. The color deep, deep amber--par for the course of Scotch ales. Nose was full of dark toffee and hints of leather. Just the tiniest hint of smoke. As the regular Dirty Bastard I thought the beer was okay, a little thin but quaffable. But in this conception, the bourbon-barreling made the beer richly textured yet not stick to the roof of your mouth. I am about to put my feet up and enjoy the rest of this glass as the wind howls outside and winter really begins. I recommend each of you do the same."
"I didn't note the pour, color, bouquet or head. What I did note was the terrific initial taste and the pleasureably sweet subsequent aftertaste. Aftertaste is usually a bad word, but with this beer it is the dessert. Reviews compare this beer to Founder's Dirty Bastard but I taste no similarities. For a heavy HEAVY (10.2%) beer, this is a delightfully pleasant and refreshing brew that far surpasses all expectations."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a full body. It is lightly carbonated. The beer even pulls off a bit of creamyness. This beer is a sipper by many peoples standards. I had to restrain myself from guzzling this malt bomb."
"Another great brew from Founder's!"
"A fantastic brew from a fantastic brewery."
"Sweetness comes back with time and brings some booze with it too. It's enjoyable as hell but has some heft in there. Definitely a sipper."
"As soon as I heard that this beer had come in locally, I raced over to an establishment that had it in stock. Interesting label, with a guy with a big beard that looks a lot like this crazy guy I used to talk to on the bus when I was back at Umass (we called him Gandalf). Anyway, pours a very murky dark raspberry brown color. A bit more heading would raise the score of appearance a bit, as there is little, if any. Great smells of candied apple, custard, bourbon, and other sweet fruit come through. Taste is of more apple, some cinnamon, chocolate, sharp acidic twang, and some molasses. There is also a bit of a medicinal aspect to the beer as well, perhaps a result of barrel aging. Body is large and malty, with little hop presence. This would make for beer to pair with dessert, or on its own with a pipe or cigar. This beer conjures up thoughts of changing leaves from Fall, which is a great thing. I might consider putting this in the lineup for Thanksgiving beers this year. Great beer, Founders is amongst my favorites right now. Happy Trails"
"Full bodied and perfect carbonation. I really dig this beer. I cant picture another example of a bourbon aged scotch ale that would stand up to this. Simply delicious."
"Drinkability: Not something I would want more than a bottle of in one sitting. Definitely a sipping beer."
"This is a decent scotch ale and one that bourbon lovers will especially enjoy. It's definitely a sipper and makes a great nightcap."
"I've had a few other barrel aged, either plain oak barrel or a barrel previously used with some other spirit and this is one of the best. This beer can definatley benefit from cellaring, although good now, I can't wait to revisit this beer after a couple of months."
"12 ounce bottle, Fall 2008. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a dark red/brown color with a very small tan head that went away quickly. Not much lacing either. Aroma is mostly bourbon, but there's also vanilla, oak, peat and smoke noticable. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the alcohol heat is a little harsh at first. It does mellow a bit when it warms up but you can still tell there's some alcohol there when drinking it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, carbonation is low and it's creamy. Drinkability is decent enough and it is smooth, but the alcohol isn't hidden well at all so that hurts it some. I don't think I'd want to drink more than 1-2 of these at a time. Overall I think it is a decent enough beer, I think aging it some would help."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/3.5"
"Redish copper color from tap. I do not really like this beer. But that is (sort of) a compliment. It is very true to stile becouse I do not enjoy scotish ales. As in most scotish ale the big alcohol precese is not balanced with any backbone. No real malts or hops. However, it was a great suprise to find a Michigan Beer on tap that I have not tried. Hard to really go wrong with any Founder's."
"I like barrel aged beers, but this one was still quite hot for my liking."
"I have had the regular Dirty Bastard and thought it was pretty good but I had no idea it could be improved this much. This stuff is great, I'm gonna have to get another four pack."
"Bottle on 12/27/08 - Pours a cloudy brownish/red with a frothy ½ inch caramel colored head. A light aroma of bourbon and malt complete the nose. First sip is much more bourbon than the nose indicated. It is all bourbon, and then some malts appear in a supportive role. As it warms, it is still all bourbon but now some hops are present adding to the overall complexity. I am guessing this was aged in some very fresh barrels still loaded with residual bourbon wetness as the beer picked up a ton of flavor."
"Slightly murky red, decent amount of foam. Clear and strong bourbon aroma. Alcohol has mellowed, oxidation is creeping in, but doesn't interfere. Bourbon flavors are front and center, woody sweet maple syrup, brown sugar, drizzled in caramel toffee. Really tasty without the alcohol heat."
"god damn i'm drunk. it tastes like you're drinking hard liquor. 10.2%. the smell is straight up bourbon, but it doesn't have the burn you'd expect. it pours black as hell and is easy to drink, but i stumbled several times while drinkin this and lookin at some fine ladies. i haven't thrown up yet. founders is delicious, but i think this beer might be a little much for me. wooo"
"D - Overall, i wasn't too impressed by this one. It was sort of rough in the mouth and the flavor profile wasn't anything too special. I really didn't care for how the peat, bitterness and oaky spicness came together. They just didn't seem to blend right as one area was always a bit out of whack. We'll see what time does for it but i wasn't too impressed."
"Overall, somewhat disappointed in this one. Founders does so many beers well, perhaps I'm unfairly holding it up to their stouts. Regardless, one 4-pack is more than enough for me in a season."
"This was a great wet barrel bourbon Scottish ale. Glad to get this in trade!"
"d- amazingly drinkable. i let my wife take a sip who hates strong beer and she even enjoyed it. tastes nothing like 10.2% excellent beer."
"D: This is not my favored style of ale but I did enjoy it. It was nice to drink it out of a thistle glass and just sip away. The kind of beer that makes you question what beer is - a sophisticated and acquired taste. I tend to enjoy high ABV brews that mask the alcohol a little better but I will look forward to the other 2 bottles I have left. It's a quality brew and I would recommend giving it a try. I ate some Gouda with this - good call. It balances it out very nicely."
"D: Insanly high, heavier and bigger (it seems) than the Old Ale, this beer is a champion of barrel aging and has done very well for itself. Looks pretty, drinks easy and feels great on the pallate, a great beer all around."
"D- the ABV and the taste of alcohol make this one hard to want a second. however, i do feel that its a much improved version of dirty bastard and wish it would be a year round staple."
"Founders has once again created another amazing beer. A must try as far as I'm concerned. Founders is rapidly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"D - Very overbearing, would tire easily."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice Wee Heavy. (A favorite style of mine.) But I think there is just too much barrel aged flavors and alcohol burn to make this a great beer. Solid, and certainly worth a try. I'll have to compare notes later when I crack open my Alesmith Barrel Aged Wee Heavy and see how it compares."
"Every one of the above scores was barely achieved. Founders managed to take a great beer and a great concept (bourbon barrel aging) and turn it into 'merely good' beer. It would still be fantastic if they make this a regular release because the potential for greatness is definitely there. Thanks prototypic."
"Brown color with a full forming head that lasts well. Fairly nice nose that shows hints of vanilla and whiskey, with also some nice notes of the original beer (a little toastiness.) Flavor is of a very sweet beer that is mainly dominated by oak, a touch of coconut and whiskey notes. I like it, but it is not a complex beer. The original beer should really have a lot more character and is missing malt depth."
"I'd received two or three of these from nflmvp, and I'm most thankful for these treats."
"HV"
"D - I had this at the end of the Great Taste and thought it was awful. Nice to try it with a clean palette to taste the complexity. On the sweet side but it brings out a nice candy/dessert like flavor."
"Damn fine, interesting, bourbon bomb of a beer. I can't wait till this fall to get more."
"12 oz Bottle: Plum, roasted malt, bourbon, oak. vanilla, and some sugar notes consists the aroma of this brew. Appearance is an almost opaque dark brown to black with a little light creeping through the actual brew. Taste is Bourbon big time with later the sweet malt and woody, oak, vanilla, and roast textures peaking through. Finishes with an almost vanilla ice cream/ shot of whiskey like taste. Overall, I love this brew. Great tasting and very complex. Thumbs up to Founders!"
"Pours a hazy mahogany amber with a shallow wispy light tan head that's gone in a flash, spotty patterns of lacing in it's wake. The smell is immediately a vanilla cherry boozy wonder. Beneath that a rich malty caramel goodness. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel has a 'mixed drink' boozy nature, as opposed to straight up single malt. Very smooth. Full flavored, the premium oak aged bourbon treatment is first class. The Scotch Ale character of the taste is denied by the more dominate ""Wee Heavy"". The 9.2% ABV is exaggerated by the bourbon notes. A really wonderful beverage and a classic sipper. Reminiscent of Founders Curmudgeon. Highly recommended."
"Pours an amber/brown with a great head and lacing. Smells malty and fruity with fig and cherry. Sweet and smooth aromas that are bold but not cloying. The taste is sweet and somewhat grainy, with more deep flavors of fig, dates, butterscotch and a touch of peat to control all the sweet stuff. Quite creamy and full in the mouth, the flavors explode here. This pushes the edge of too sweet but holds on to enough complexity and pure, clean flavors to be very enjoyable."
"Drinks good for the abv, & style. This is a bit off style to me, but tasty enough"
"Drinkability: despite the high alcohol, this one goes down pretty smoothly. Very tasty brew."
"Pours an cloudy orange/red, a bit muddy, nice thick tan head forms, slowly settles to a thin layer, nice ring, some lace spots on the glass, a fine looking head! Smell is nice, buttery, toffee, bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, oak, touch of chocolate and coconut, brown sugar, boozy but rich, I like. Taste is similar, buttery beginning, some citrus, toffee, heavy vanilla/coconut, brown sugar, alcohol, bit spicy, woody, chocolate, toast and bourbon in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low to medium carbonation, some alcohol warmth, but nicely drinkable, and pretty balanced, even though I think the bourbon is a bit heavy."
"Drinkability: This is a really nice beer to nurse. The mix is one that could easily overwhelm the palate, but this one doesn't."
"Drinks fairly well because it tastes so good, but the alcohol is noted in taste and feel, making it a nice sipper."
"D: Tasty brew that would probably be better suited for a chilly Indian summer night.. but was just fine tonight, too."
"D_I am not the biggest fan of bourbon barrel beers but this one is pretty damned good. Avery interesting wee heavy"
"My buddy who mainly drinks lagers (decent ones) tried it and loved it. He referred to it as dessert. I thought of it as the Main Course."
"I purchased a couple bottles of this stuff a few months ago and I am really kicking myself right now for not buying more. I don't know what it is, but this bottle tastes much better than the previous bottle. I've had my share of barrel aged beers and this is right up there as one of the best. Dark brown in color with an aroma that is totally dominated by bourbon (vanilla, oak, caramel), this brew is totally inviting. The taste is great - hints of chocolate, vanilla, and an obvious bourbon overtone. Mouthfeel could be a little richer, but not bad at all. This is a treat - for real. Easy drinking. Highly recommended."
"A nice sipping beer with good complexity."
"Pours to a murky dark brown body hosting a creamy tan head that stands at one finger but fades quickly to just a skim leaving no lace. Right up front on the nose you are greeted by huge bourbon tones wraped around dark fruit, coco, and carmalized malt. Oh wow! is all I can say after first sip, this is so right. Take Dirty Bastard, mellow it out, perfectly develop all the flavors and then add a pinch of Bourbon. Creamy on the mouth are a mix of flavors including hot buttered rum, toffee, dark fruits and bitter chocolate. A bitter bourbon hint shows off a hop profile as well as aged bourbon on the end of the palate. Bourbon is big on the finish and the mouthfeel. This is a wonderful sipper that should be savored. Definitely for bourbon fans."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are noting too special."
"I am a big fan of wee heavys and really wanted to try a barrel aged one, my bottle said 8.7%, nice first experience, would drink again, noticeably better than Dirty Bastard in my opinion, recommended"
"drinkability: woooowee"
"D- Love it! Maybe one of my favorites. Just wish the smell wasn't so dominated by bourbon. Thanks Hoppymeal for these!"
"Quite a good beer actually. This is not a style I'm too fond of but the oak bourbon ageing gave this one some more dimension."
"Nice beer overall, though it's not as ""intense"" as I would have expected. This is a good use of bourbon barrels. The bourbon flavors really add another dimension to the beer without overwhelming the caramel and toffee flavors."
"Pours a foggy dark mahogany with a tan colored two finger head that quickly dies down to a thin frothy layer of bubbles. A good amount of lacing remains on the sides. Smell is dominate by the bourbon aromas with a good amount of chocolate and caramel malts. Lots of vanilla sweetness and dark fruits, mostly fig and raisins. Some faint woody scents find their way in the nose as well. Smokey malt flavors with a creamy coffee bitterness up front. Molasses and carmelized almonds on the tongue as well. Aftertaste is actually pretty dry and woody, more than I expected for the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of bubbles. I had a difficult time drinking this one because of the dry aftertaste and boozy flavors. Founders still does a great job once again though. A nice warm feeling left in the tummy after this one."
"Pours a ruby brown in color with no head. Smell is exactly what you'd think, a scotch ale with bourbon, oak, and rum notes. They must have used the same barrels as for their curmudgeon, this has many of the same characteristics. Taste is bourbon, oak, and some fig. The mouthfeel is medium and very smooth/creamy. This is an easy drinker, but you get a hit of the alcohol warmth in the aftertaste."
"The aroma is strong, bourbon and malt, maybe you could guess it was even a rum and coke. The flavor is way complex, rum, coke, bourbon, sweet and roasted malts, unreal. Alcohol is really evident as well, which limits the drinkability for me."
"The bourbon aroma and taste is just right, it's not overpowering. Overall, a drinkable beer that I'm sure will get better with some age."
"drinkability is great. alcohol is dangerously well hidden. i could drink this all night. perfect balance. great malt profile. excellent balance of the barrel character against the base beer too. this is good stuff!"
"Overall, this was a really nice and quite complex wee heavy. I have had ones strong then this, but this was almost borderline on a old ale. It was just full of alcohol and really sweet tones. Very nicely crafted and definitely a quality brew. I look forward t having another one day."
"I really like that the malt character plays a slightly bigger role in the flavor profile than the bourbon barrel does; this keeps the integrity of the rich, Scotch ale style, but with an offsetting bourbon component that helps to offset / balance the thick malt character of this brew. Having said that, bourbon barrel aged beers seem to be a bit hard for me to get behind; there is something about the Bourbon notes that add a harshness the beers aged in the barrels that just doesn't quite work for me. As the beer warms up from its initial 50°F / 10°C it picks up more of the sharp, hot, Bourbon flavors which pull this away from being balanced. This is not a bad brew, but the Bourbon character is a bit much, especially as the beer warms up a bit."
"Very big beer, good drinkablity will drink this one again. one per sitting though"
"Poured a very dark brown, nearly opaque with a bit of a ruddy hue at the edges, a little muddy. Little foam, just a smattering of fine, beige bubbles that produced a bit of spotty lace. Vanilla and bourbon aromas up front, with toffee and a bit of smoke in the background. Low bitterness relative to malt, same characters as in the aroma. There was a bit of fruity raisin to start, plus cocoa notes in the middle and finish. Bourbon character was more pronounced and it had a warm, alcohol finish. Really good stuff. The texture was rich and malty with light carbonation. Founders hasn't let me down yet."
"Thanks to hoppymeal (Derek) for sending..."
"Kentucky Breakfast Stout is an awesome beer and I've even rated it more highly than this one, but I actually like what the bourbon does for this beer more than what it does for KBS. It's too dominant in KBS, in my opinion, where here it is just a perfect complement to the brew. Really tasty beer that is most certainly worth a try."
"A viry nice scottish ale, but it is a little boozy and is a sipper for sure. A nice drink that would make a nice nightcap."
"D - This one is a very sweet brew but that is balanced with a strong alcohol presence. Drinability is good but the abv puts the limit at one per sitting."
"D: The abv is too far to make this a go-to beer. If you like the punch of a bourbon aged beer, this is worth a visit. The bottle is not as powerful as I remember the growler being, but that could just be the passage of time."
"Pretty easy to drink even for the high abv. think it would be too much to have more than one or two, like drinking a beer and a shot of bourbon, but i could drink one every day."
"This is an entertaining beer. I wonder what would happen after aging it for a year or two, I'd be curious to read about this later."
"This has a decent drinkablility and is definitely worth a try..."
"The aroma is nice: caramel, milk chocolate and notes of the oak barrels. It tastes wonderful, of syrupy bourbon, ripened berries, some alcohol, and a perfectly complementing finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth, with tiny bubbles of carbonation, but I wanted it to be slightly more harsh, less watery. Still good, though. That said, it went down so easily and was a most pleasant drinking experience. I look forward to finding this one again."
"Thanks again, Derek!!"
"It tries to settle at mid-bottle, but it stays on the sweet side  and this hides any thought of 8.7% alcohol. But eh, Ill try again next year."
"Very nice, deep, rich reddish hue to it. Some head though not overly carbonated. Somewhat muted aroma-slight oakiness and sweet caramel malt. Big malt flavor with a very heavy handed oakiness to it. Great caramel sweetness. Slight tinge of alcohol burn. Very soft and smooth body. Well balanced-maybe a touch of harshness off the alcohol but I am amazed how ""soft"" the beer seems. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Not a big fan of oak or bourbon aged beers but this one is quite good for my tastes."
"Flavor is full and rich. Hops are hardly noticeable. Huge smokey malt character matches well with strong woody bourbon. Alcohol is clearly present, but I never would have guessed that it is 9.2%. A tasty and flavorful brew."
"Drinkability - this is excellent, and quite hearty, only the high abv limits sessionability."
"Body is thick but far from syrupy. Finish is dry as one might expect from a barrel aged brew. Although the drinkability score might seem less-than-stellar, I'm yet to find a barrel-aged brew that is sessionable. This is a remarkable example of what the barrel treatment can do for a beer and stands in stark contrast to a mistake like, say, Imperial Brown Goose. That was a style (Christmas ale) that didn't have the fortitude to stand up to the treatment. This (Scotch ale, presumably Dirty Bastard) beer had what it takes to deliver the goods. Really good bottled version of a barrel aged beer."
"A very easy to drink big beer, founders does it again, they just keep impressing me beer after tasty beer. I would drink lots of this if it were more readily available."
"Aftertaste is boubon and alcohol warmth with a touch of vanilla."
"I don't think this needs to be said but this is another great beer from Founders. They've really opened things up this year with all the new bottled releases. A great beer from one of the best breweries in the country."
"I also picked up Old Curmudgean, tasted side by side and close in charactor."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's thick and definitely a sipping beer. It's pretty well carbonated. It's potent at 8.7%. I'd be hard pressed to drink more than two in a sitting. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. I'd definitely pick it up again (if I happen to see it)."
"Prosit un Zum Wohl... MK"
"Nice. A tasty change of pace. Id recommend a bottle, but not a case."
"I like it. Would I want it all the time: no way. Not as well integrated as the superb KFBS, but still a very good brew."
"D- A very interesting beer for sure. This is just essentially bourbon beer. Unique, tasty, and worth trying."
"Pours a great, deep ruby that stubbornly lets a little light pass through it. Makes me think of a mans cognac or brandy. No head or lace to speak of. Very meaty aroma of sugared fruits, like pruins, figs, and apricots with a definite touch of oak and alcohol. The taste starts with vanilla and malty figs. A good oaky finish but with a bit too much alcohol that lingers a little toolong. Still a good sipping beer. The palat is thick and fruity with an undeniable oak and creamy standard vanilla tone. Good for a long sipping night cap. No more than one a day. I'm glad I got to try this beer. Considering I really like the old dirty bastard."
"This is an exceptional beer. As far as I'm concerned, dump the dirty the bastard and only make this liquid nectar from now on."
"Drinkability suffers from the big bourbon flavors, but is still pretty good."
"D - Dangerously so....this is one great bourbon aged beer. I am not the biggest fan of Dirty Bastard so for this to come out so well is a pleasant surprise."
"I would give it a higher score if the beer showed through a bit more."
"Regardless this 1 is creamy and smooth throught until the booze in the end. A good sipper."
"D: Rich and hard-hitting. An awesome palate-womper, but one is quite enough."
"D: This is a sipper for sure. If you enjoy bourbon style beer's you should enjoy this one."
"Overall, this is a great ""bourbon beer," with a major emphasis on the whiskey-ish half of that moniker. Another fine brew from Founders--Michigan's ascending brewery."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, warming, lightly carbonated, and yummy."
"Seems a bit thin, not much carbonation. Either this is overdone, or just needs to sit and chill out for a while. I was kind of disappointed, I felt the oak took all of the character away from the bastard."
"drinkability: very enjoyable. I wish that I had a few to age. I'm rounding up my rating in a few areas. I'd say a very good result for what I'm assuming is a new take on the style."
"Backwards Bastard is a very different beer than the Dirty Bastard. The oak aging is very apparent in the taste. Also, it's quite a bit less hoppier than its cousin. I wonder, in part, how much the oak aging had an effect on the diminished hoppiness. This is a decent bourbon barrel oak-aged beer, but it seems the more I try these, the more they all start tasting the same. One of these is enough for me in a sitting. The 9.2% abv and body of the beer easily makes this one to sit back and savor."
"Maybe too much bourbon/barrel? Nah! Damn fine beer. I sampled this on Dark Lord Day and have been really looking forward to enjoying a whole one. Will enjoy my others as the weather gets cooler."
"Overall, I like this beer. It warms you and is very ""digestive"" in the Belgian sense of the word. But I do think the bourbon-barrel aging process overwhelms the original beer."
"Wow, Founders comes through with another oak-aged wonder. Definitely one to sip and savor to fully enjoy it's complex and warming characteristics. I just wish that I had more than just the one bottle."
"Drinkability - Exceptional. But the alcohol was kinda harsh. Could use a year in the cellar. Flavors worked well with each other. Recommend!"
"d: One a night for sure as this is a sipper. I'll miss these when they are gone."
"Smooth and velvety on the tongue with moderate carbonation. Full, buttery finish that lingers a bit on the palate. I'm often not big a fan of many similar selections, but this one really captured the most appetizing qualities from the barrels without dragging some of the overpowering harshness along. Another fantastic selection form Founders"
"Dark, garnet-brown body with a thick, frothy, khaki brown head. Great lacing. Bourbon notes are prominent and they meld fantastically with the bastard's rich caramel, smoke, peat, and maple syrup aromas. Light bourbon burn up front. Dark fruits and rich caramel soon follow, with the bourbon around the edges. Hints of peat before delicious wave of vanilla, butterscotch, oak and sweet dark fruits. Herbal hop bitterness way in the background gets lost in the warming bourbon finish. Delicious. Full-bodied with a very smooth, creamy feel. Very impressive!"
"D- I love the bourbon notes on this batch, but the off flavors turned me off in turn. But still good, especially the drinking experience of syrupy, mildly boozy, beer."
"D- This beer has a bit more sweetness to the malt which adds more depth to the bourbon and wood. This is a great beer for the winter months ahead. It will pair well with a warm fire, cold winter nights and perhaps a cigar."
"D - This was really good, but I would say that the bourbon did overwhelm the scotch ale. I don't know if this would be any better, but I am curious is this beer would have worked better with more balance between the two."
"Some might call this the latest Founders monstrosity, but I promise it's nowhere near as bruising as other ""big"" Founders beers, and it's a nice escape from a dreary fall afternoon. (Leave it to Michiganders to know the antidote to Michigan weather!)"
"Very drinkable, too bad it's so rare."
"This beer poured a clear very dark red amber color and formed a nice foamy off white head that left laticed lace as it subsided. Very little carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, smoke/wood, caramel and lightly of cherry. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and again the woody/smoke probably from the cask aging. The the body was medium light and the finish was slightly burnt."
"It's medium bodied with a creamy, and just slightly sticky, mouth--but it's just right, well balanced and very active on the palate. It's drinkable, but probably not a session brew. It's more of a desert beer. It would make one hell of an ice cream float. Outstanding."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, a very different beer, and one I thoroughly enjoyed. I would love to see what a year would do for the flavor of this beer."
"Can't remember who it was who was roaming around with a growler of this, but thank you very, very much."
"D - Being 9.2%, it will sneak up on you, but until it does, drink it up."
"This is just one of 2 beers im reviewing from tastes at Dark Lord day...this one because of how amazingly good it was and because i actually took notes on it. Pours dark, dark brown with reddish hues and a thin wisp of a head. looks exciting. Odor is full of bourbon, oaky and ethanol-laced with chocolate and peat smells too. Taste is absolutely sublime. Bourbon, some vanilla (not too much), oak, cherries, peat, toffee, prunes, other dark dangerous fruits. obvious alcohol warming. i think dirty bastard is definitely a beer that lends itself to barrel aging. what a great beer this is, ill have to head on up to Founders soon. Don't know who brought the growler but thanks!"
"Mouth is silky smooth and full of life. Very highly drinkable BA beer."
"the flavor is very malty, almost sweet, there is a good hop flavor, with a pleasent oakiness, bourbon, and vanilla."
"D: Wow! The bourbon is so well intergrated into this beer. It doesn't over power the other flavors and aromas. A pleasure to drink!"
"The bottom line: Founders does some of the best barrel aged products around. Kentucky Breakfast, Old Curmudgeon, the Bourbon Stout, and now this are amongst my favourite offerings by the brewery. Be sure to check this out if you're in the GR area anytime soon."
