3.51,-7.9,3.5,3.75,3.25,4,3.5,"Growler from brewery poured into snifter. Pours a finger of tan head that fades rather quickly into a thin film, with moderate lacing. Clear, and reddish-brown. Sweet, rich and roasted malty nose, with notes of toffee and dark fruits. Earthy malty flavor, notes of raisins and prunes, rather straightforward. Slightly metallic undertones. Mouthfeel is syrupy, with medium-heavy body, and moderate carbonation lingering on tip of tongue. Decently balanced. Overall, I like the feel and the nose, but I find the flavor lacking much complexity. Enjoyable, and sessionable. I have had better in this style, but I would still buy again.","sporklift87","Mar 09, 2015"

4.1,7.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 11/21/2013. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, fig, apple, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, raisin, fig, apple, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, dark fruit, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, brown sugar, light roast, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent scotch ale. All around great balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 07, 2013"
3.99,4.7,4.25,4,4,3.75,4,"Pours a very dark brown than has a small tan head that leaves good lacing when sipped. Good carbonation. The aroma of caramel is right up front around with some dark fruit like plum or berries. Very nice. the taste is also very pleasant with hints of caramel, butterscotch, toffee and malts. Great balance of flavors. Not a summer brew as this is a little on the heavy side. Great brew for cooler months for sure.","BeerWithMike","Oct 07, 2013"

The taste is very smooth, the malt comes through with a slight caramel flavor; pleasant after taste, a well blended ale. Mouth feel - medium body and carbonation. Overall: An excellent take on the style. I'll have to try more of Big Sky's offerings, they have yet to disappoint.","Steamer","Oct 03, 2013"

3,-21.3,4,4,2.5,3,2.5,"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I though that it was a little below average for the style. The look and the aroma were going in the right direction but when it got to the taste it really fizzled out and left me wanting much more. This beer had OK drinkability, it went down smooth, but the flavor was pretty bland and it couldn't hold my attention, one is enough for me and I'm ready to move onto something with more flavor. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both were they should be for the style. What I liked least about this beer was the flavor, it seems like all the nice things I picked up in the aroma never made it's way to the taste and that really hurt this beer. This beer was priced well but the lackluster taste really holds this beer back and I would much rather have a Dirty Bastard, I can't say that I would recommend this beer. I find Big Sky to be a pretty solid brewery, but I was a little let down with beer as it really didn't deliver when it came to the flavor, you guys make some good and solid beers, it's too bad this is not one of them, better luck next time, looks like I'm back to the Dirty Bastard's.","StoutHunter","May 02, 2012"
3.85,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"a decent scotch ale. smells and tastes very very malty, with very little of the earthy depth many of these style beers showcase. palate is a little on the sweet side, with a touch of the alcohol coming through. almost tastes and feels like a barleywine in that respect, very grainy, in a good way. mouthfeel is good, i like the fuller body on this one, and the fairly heavy carbonation i think serves it quite well. this isnt my favorite scotch ale, or even my favorite big sky beer, but its sessionable for a its style and its one that works with all kinds of food, so i will probably grab this one again if i see it.","StonedTrippin","Apr 29, 2012"

As scotch ales go, this one appeared a dark reddish brown with a certain degree of cloudines. The aroma was not incredibly potent, but did produce a mild wheat flavor. One may have to really search for an aroma here. The initial taste was a moderate level of scotch sweetness with a wheat backbone. This flowed into the aftertaste which was mildly warming and yet somewhat sour. Overall, this is a mild scotch ale. It would not stand-out in crowd of elite scotches, but it is an easy drinker.","JohnnyHopps","Dec 17, 2011"

Light lacing on the sides as well. Aroma was spectacular. Rich notes of caramel and toffee, oozing with butterscotch and sweet herbal notes. Light hint of a boozy alcohol touch to it at well, but it played out quite nicely. The first sip made me fall back in my chair. Simply brilliant. Rich butterscotch and toffee flavors roll across the tongue. Enormously sweet like a wonderful piece of hard candy, each sip seemed more compelling then the one before it. Sublime.

2.66,-30.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Pours a slightly see-through brown with a tannish head. The nose is light caramel and breadiness. None of the smokiness/particular roasted malt character I always hope for and sometimes fail to get off of a scotch ale. A little concerned already that this is going to be a Scottish Ale. Taste is pretty light - caramel malt and bready sweetness in a package with a thin flavor and a thin body. No depth in the flavor. Seems to be short of the style. Someone mentioned that it was more like a odd brown ale than a Scotch Ale, and I would say it represents something more like a Scottish Style Ale or a Brown Ale than a Scotch Ale. Overall, this is not nearly my favorite representation of the style.","seeswo","Apr 25, 2011"

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, nuts, cream, and hints of vanilla. The taste is similar to the aroma. What I think really makes this beer wonderful is that no one aspect of the flavor or aroma dominates. Instead everything seems to work well together in perfect balance. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a good Scotch Ale that I will certainly drink again.","KarlHungus","Nov 18, 2010"
4.15,8.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This Scotch Ale pours a dark brown with a had that last for a fair while as a good scent of malts tickles your nose.

4.17,9.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I wouldn't say that it classifies as a strong scotch or anything, but it comes across as more like a 80 schilling or something with mild Peat.

The smell was sweet and fruity malt. The taste was lightly sweet upfront with dark malt and fruit flavors. It finished dry with a touch of bitterness and throat warming alcohol. It was medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. Heavy Horse was a decent Scotch ale and worth a try.","afinepilsner","Nov 06, 2010"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a nice mahogany color with ruby twinges. The smell is of some drunken apples and a bit of earthy notes that come along with it. There is a good citrus note from the hops to mix in with the aroma, would have liked it to be more potent. The flavor is a nice mixture of ginger and molasses. Some cinnamon comes to play in the party and I think perhaps there is a bit of a chocolate note. It is a good quality flavor for a Scotch ale. The mouthfeel is nice sticky and malty with a twinge of bitterness that is paired well with the carbonation. This is a very good beer, one of the better examples of the style I've had from an American brewery.","Vdubb86","Nov 04, 2010"

Aroma of caramel with notes of peat with some grassy hops. Flavor is caramel with a hint of peat and smoke. Just a little grassy near the finish. Seems very dry for a Scotch Ale. Nothing terrible about the flavor but there is very little to make one excited. Body seems a little thin for the style as well but has nice carbonation. Easy drinking beer which is a little dangerous considering the ABV. Nothing really to savor to slow consumption. I expected something better from Big Sky.","morimech","Oct 30, 2010"
