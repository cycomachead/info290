"Usually like scotch ales but the tartness threw me off on this one. Overall not good."

"I don't know if this beer was intended to be presented this way... but its not good as is. The tea leaf bitterness doesn't work and the tartness just adds to the confusion. I'll pass in the future."

"O. Almost too sweet, yet not quite. I like this."
"O- A decent wee heavy, but I didn't find it as complex as some reviewers. A decent drinking beer, but I didn't find it to be outstanding."

"It's gotta be me, as I just don't get a lot of flavor out of this. Poured perhaps a bit cold with a modest light tan head that soon settled and some lace. Color is a clear mahogany with some bubble trails. Aroma is very malty, toffee, caramel, hint of smoke, grain. Flavor's kind of bland; not as pronounced as nose, some tang up front, only a suggestion of scotch ale. Body/carbonation are excellent. Finish is like flavor, a slightly nuttiness lingers and that's it. Meh."

"For style this is kind of a subtle beer. It doesn't' knock me over with intensity of flavor, rather is requires some searching and effort. . But it is worth it."

"I really like Lake Louie beers, but this one is a little different than the rest. Most of their brand is smooth and refreshing. This beer seems a little bit over the top with taste. Don't get me wrong...This is a good beer, but I have had plenty of scotch ales over the years and this one is in the middle of the pack for me. Maybe it was just an off night for me on this one. I like my strong beers, but this scotch ale seemed a little to much taste up front. I was expecting a little more on the back end of the tongue and throat, rather than on the tip of my tongue. All in all, I would get the beer again, but not my first choice for Scotch Ales."

"This is my go to beer. Whenever I have been standing staring at the selection at local beer selectorium for too long trying to decide what I would like to take home, I inevitably grab the Warped Speed Scotch Ale. This beer has everything I look for in a beer anytime of year. Fans of IPA's may find it a bit heavy in the summer, but for me it's balance of sweet and bitter is perfect."

"Warped Speed Scotch Ale pours a dark golden color, with a nice large head for a scotch ale. There was a boozy sweet sugary aroma. The taste had a very nice scotch like taste, a good hint of sweetness, nice warm and boozy. Good full flavor, nice sipping beer. Overall a very nice complete and well crafted scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - A malt-lover's dream, Warped Speed Scotch Ale manages, quite well in fact, to usher sweetness forward while remaining balanced and drinkable. Toffee and caramel get along well with the beer's coffee and chocolate roasted malt notes for an almost dessert-like quality to this smooth brew."

"Overall- I was kind of disappointed. When cold the sweet malts really were present but as it warmed the bitter hops over shadowed the malty goodness."
""

"4.0 D: Supremely drinkable and a damn good scotch ale. I had the bourbon barrel version of this and it sucked, so I guess it was the barreling that was fucked up and not the base beer."

"The beer is medium-bodied, I suppose. I never really noticed the mouthfeel (which is oftentimes a good sign). Overall, this is a darn good example of the style. I don't love this style, to be honest, but I can certainly appreciate this beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Dark clotted blood color, foam collar for a head, medium body with light carbonation levels, smells of sweet malts (mostly caramel), dark fruits and also that hint of peat smoke that I wasn't able to find in the Louie's Reserve. Taste includes all these elements and some strong earthy hopping on top of a bowl of grape nuts cereal. Body is medium thick and slightly undercarbonated. It really does come across as a smaller Louie's Reserve, but with the inclusion of peatiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Very, very good. Right on par with the Brewer's reserve version of this beer and an excellent bargain for $7.99 a six pack. Maybe one of the best beers for your buck."

"I'll stick by my theory that Wisconsin is incapable of producing a good beer."
" ~ I'm not a big scotch ale fan but I have to admit this is a good beer. If you're interested in starting out and finishing with a good beer in this style category, this is the one with which you should go."
"Pours a chocolate brown amber with a 1 finger head. Caramel, yeasty, banana, spicy and phenolic on the nose. Modest bitter bite on the tongue, more than I expected. Strong molasses, bready, caramel, toffee, with a spicy boozyness about it, and raisin, fig and faint banana esters. Medium to light body, chewy, boozy spice in the finish. Very good, characteristics don't seem to meld perfectly in my book, the reserve is bigger and seems to bring everything together a little better."
"D/O: This is a solid scotch ale that takes a traditional approach to the style. The flavors in the middle were nearly perfect, and overall it stayed appealing from start to finish. Pair with lighter braised meats, but don't look for this beer to be a reliable source of acidity in the pairing."
"O: Good Scotch ale, but a light mouthfeel and a overall character is what I feel defines the style. Very nice blend of malts add to a classic Wee Heavy taste, but a bit light."
"O - overall, impressive. I like my scotch ales to be heavier, but this was really enjoyable."
"Overall, this beer is a bit too light. The scotch ale components are there, but not prominent enough."
"Body is medium, almost medium-heavy. Carbonation is just about spot on in conjunction with the body. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and wish i lived closer to Wisconsin so i could have access to it whenever i please."
"There's some caramel and butterscotch flavors here, but none of the diacetyl and buttery mouthfeel that I really want in a Scotch ale. Then again there's none of the unfortunately chalky malt flavor, either. Overall, it's relative mildness (read: blandness) and perfect level of carbonation makes it supremely drinkable and probably a fine session beer, but not a great beer. Pitty I only picked up one in a mixed 6-pack while traveling through Janesville, WI."
"I had this on tap at The Shed in Spring Green, WI on Feb 26, 2011 and purchased 2 6 packs of bottles at the Piggly Wiggly in Dodgeville to bring home. This is my favorite destination beer. The full mouth feel is very satisfying with big malts. Some of the recent BA reviews make me think some bad (or badly mistreated) beer has been making the rounds because I have found this brew to be fully satisfying every time I have had it. Very drinkable any time of year."
"D - Not sure if this is the intended flavor or not but it tastes kind of sour and not too much like what I would expect from a Scotch Ale. It isn't overly so which has saved it from the drain. I'd like to revisit this one sometime to tell if I got a bad bottle or not."
"The mouth-feel is smooth with the carbonation accentuating the flavors"
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a moderate brown-red color with a slight head and no lacing. The nose is some light dark fruits, caramel, toffee, and a slight sour scent. The taste is definitely of an infected batch, though it hasn't set in too much yet. Slight acetic character plus some toffee. Sourness pops up in the feel with a bit of sweetness. This is a problem I've encountered with several of their beers, unfortunately."
"It's really a shame that there's that misplaced sharp smell/taste - otherwise this would be a very nice wee heavy. As it stands, I won't be buying it again."
"My first Lake Louie beer, and the first beer of the pre-interview extravaganza in Madison. It pours a slightly hazed ruby-garnet topped by a half-finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises dank moss, caramel, drier greens, and a small pile of roasted malts in the background. The taste holds notes of toasted caramel, toffee, and walnuts. The body is medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a finish that borders on the sorta sticky. Overall, a nice Scotch, nothing too amazing, but a fairly tasty offering nonetheless."
"By far the best Scotch ale for the money. In fact, I substantially prefer this to several I've had that were 3-4x the price."
"Overall, not a bad beer but a disappointment. I'll probably not go back to this for a scotch ale fix."
"Drinkability -- I was told that this was an exceptional Scotch Ale, but this exceeded my expectations. Easy-drinking, incredibly flavorful, another exceptional example of Wisconsin brewing."
"Pours a dark amber with little head. Aroma of malt and dark honey. Mouthfeel and flavor are excellent for this style, with a crisp maltiness that slowly disapates. There is a lingering astrigency (sort of tannic) that I can't quite place that goes on a bit too long for my taste, but this is an excellent true-to-style beer that I would certainly seek out."
"D: A fine Scotch ale that offers a bit more complexity than most Scotch ales. Very good. Very food friendly."
"D - We have a winner..."
"Pours a dark reddish brown to black color with thin head and minimal lacing. The smell is sour with some sweet and smokey notes. Deep malt and smokey flavors are abundant. There is something sour in there like cranberries or something along those lines. A little twang of vinegar hits at the end. You can feel something that hints of booze on your lips and tastes somewhat of smoked malt like scotch. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, but it isn't overly filling for something this dark. I couldn't find an ABV for this, but I'm betting it's up there. This stuff could knock you around if you are not carefull. Overall I enjoyed the complex malty boozey flavor of this beer. I think it would be a good warmer in the middle of winter. Good flavor and well crafted, but not one that I could drink more than one or two of."
"Nice Scottish Ale. I like my Scottish Ales to have bigger flavors, this one sits more of the lighter side of the spectrum. But that's not a bad thing, this is still a tasty beer."
"D - cant figure out the ABV on this, maybe 9 or 10, not listed on the website so its a toss up, loved founders dirty bastard, so was looking forward to this - certainly a different beer, less smoky, more fruit flavors, about as good as well, will be seeking more wee heavies out"
"Overall, a below average take on the style. Try it if you see it, but don't seek it out."
"Another great extra forgotten in the back of my refrigerator. Pours into a pint glass a deep, rich, dark brown color, with a small cap of tan foam. Huge aromas of milk chocolate and roasted nuts. Nice full mouthfeel, with roasted malt, chocolate and just a hint of piney hops. Very nicely balanced, and quite a good beer."
"The scotch is present, but plays more of a supporting role beneath the canopy of roasted and slightly smoky malted barley. Delicious. Absolutely recommend this -- especially on tap."
"maybe this bottle was slightly off? still, not a bad brew by any means."
"D - Moderate drinkability. Potent abv - it is a scotch ale. Not filling from a carbonation point of view, but the very thick beer seems to weigh down the palette. The flavors are not overbearing or fatiguing to the palette."
"Drinkability - Unbeatable flavor. Plus it's a small, local brewery. What's not to like."
"Overall nice easy drinking beer. I haven't had much from LL but I might have to grab some more of there stuff."
"Drought dry. Strangely unsatisfying. This is a decent brew that confounded my expectations, & this time not in a good way."
"Thanks, ThomasHardy, for the opportunity"
"This is a very good and extremely drinkable Scotch ale that might lack the complexity of the best in the style, but it's still solid."
"D: Goes down very easy, nice smooth drinker, there is no hint of alcohol which could be dangerous. A very nice example of the style, worth trying."
"Really strong take on a Scotch Ale here, with that deep fruity tang being the highlight but it almost gets to be just a big distracting as well. Another good effort from Lake Louie."
"D-A true gem of a scotch ale. They don't make them much better than this. What an incredible beer! Everything about this is close to perfect."
"Creamy and medium-full up front, the beer fades nicely into a warming and dry finish. I didn't expect that from a sweeter and maltier beverage. Thanks Jeff!"
"A great beer for a cold fall evening. I would enjoy this more often if we got it in Chicago. I do with the body was more full though."
"D: Drinks decently easy but you can tell it's a reasonably big beer."
"D - Very high. This is a great ale that has all the balance and features you would want. I could have quite a few of these in a session."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color with lighter tan along the bottom of the glass. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Poor lacing and poor retention. Smells of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, slight citrus (plum), very slight hops, raisin, and toffee. Fits the style of a Scotch Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, smoke, slight citrus (plum), slight hops, and toffee. Overall, a quite excellent beer that is only slightly hurt by its appearance."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fairly strong carbonation, keeping it a bit lively."
"Pours out a deep mahogany color. Actually nice and clear, I can see right through it, which is kind of rare for the color. The head pours out very dense, and just over 1 cm. Leaves pretty decent lacing. A good looking scotch ale. The smell has the two main ingredients - a lot of burnt caramel sweetness and a nice touch of smoke. As you search, there's a deep, earthy sweetness, maybe from a bit of hops or some other addition, but a nice earthy leafy kind of smell, like pipe tobacco almost, but much sweeter. Then there gets to be this chocolatey smell, almost with a bit of coffee in it, pushed along by a bit of smoke. The taste has a bit more of the smoke than the smell does, but it doesn't get you upfront, you taste everything else first, and then the smoke fills it up, almost getting to that meaty level, but then falling back into the malty sweetness. The things you taste first are this dense burnt cake kind of taste. It's like you put a slice pound cake into a toaster until it got kind of brown. There's a nice earthy note in the middle, maybe a little leafy, like a tea made of dried up, withered, almost burnt leaves. I guess those two things don't sound too good, but when they're rounded out with a bit of sweetness, they make a brilliant scotch ale - which is what this is. Sometimes, with the right amount of smokiness, the right amount of sweetness, and the right amount of earthiness, a scotch ale can taste, at points, a bit like the harder drink of the same region. This one does that a bit. I'm a fan. The body is good, over medium, but not syrupy, but the carbonation is a little more than I expect. There's a slight sting, which isn't unpleasant, but it's uncharacteristic for the style. This is a very nice drink. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and kept finding new things to keep me interested. Of course, I couldn't sit and session this, I doubt if I could drink more than one, due to the alcohol content and to the intensity of flavor, but if I was in the mood for a scotch ale, and this was nearby, I would not hesitate to buy it."
"A very solid, easily drinkable, malty beer. I'll definitely be purchasing more of these."
"Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel, fairly low carbonation which accentuates the overall texture. A great combination of flavors, truly a malty masterpiece."
"M/D - Mouthfeel and drinkability are average, nothing to write home about, but there isn't any reason to dock points."
"Very dark brown pour without a ton of head. Maybe a finger. Aroma is all malt. Nothing else competes with the malt taste. The taste is smooth and malty with just a hint of booziness. Not a quick drinker, but definitely one worth trying. I got it as an extra in a low-cost trade and I probably wouldn't trade for it again."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving nice lacing. The aroma is very fragrant. Burnt caramel, toffee, and strong floral notes. This is the best smelling Scotch Ale I have had to date. The taste is both bold and subtle. All the flavors stand out on there own, and mingle perfectly with each other. As with the aroma with is the best tasting Scotch Ale I have had the honor to taste. The mouthfeel is full bodied with sprightly carbonation and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer that I will surely search out again. If it were available in my area it would be a regular in my refrigerator."
"Bottom-of-bottle code: 8320"
"D: Well made and enjoyable but I prefer my Scotch Ales with a bunch more smoke."
"This could have been a good Wee Heavy, poor fermentation management has ruined this beer for me though."
"Drinkability isn't to hot. It was light and sweet enough to go down, but the fact is, there were some distracting off-flavors."
"Mouthfeel was thinner than expected for the style. Minimal carbonation. Not my favorite style but I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would."
"Very good, but I only think I could drink 1 or 2 at a time because of the sweetness."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and lush, full and chewy the malt is awesome for the mouthfeel in this beer."
"D: I Think this is one of my favorite beer and is easily one of the most drinkale beers I have come across so far. But they don't call it warped speed for nothing! Its a great Scotch Ale."
"Thanks to whoever sent this one my way. I just got a newer bottle of this from grub, so I'm swapping that out with this older one I've had in the cellar. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a cloudy brown color akin to fresh brewed iced tea. The tan colored creamy head measures a solid two fingers.Smells and tastes of caramelized malts, bready yeast, and fruits such as cherries and plums. Really malty as a good wee heavy should be. Medium in both body and carbonation. A nice representation of the style."
"Medium full bodied with good carbonation, and a creamy, dry mouthfeel that is a bit thin."
"Not a bad beer, but could use some carbonation and a bit more depth of malt character."
"Holy crap, the head on this thing was HUGE! Crystal clear deep amber color. Gorgeous beer. Could only fit half the bottle in the glass though with that huge head, and it took a while to settle down enough to pour the rest. I have a cold, so it was hard to judge the smell. I actually think all I detected through my stuffy nose was a little whif of alcohol! Taste was excellent with strong alcohol flavor and warming. More malt than hops, but still well balanced. Heavy body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable, but only in moderation with the high ABV."
"D - Easy drinking. Even though the aroma was similar to the taste the aroma seemed more complex and the strange flavor didn't fit very well."
"I find this nicely drinkable. A good Scotch. Glad I tried it."
"EDIT: glancing at other reviews, looks like this sample is atypical of this beer as the cloying sweetness and overbearing tart aspects aren't often noted. This could well be a bad bottle, though my s.o. thought it smelled and tasted of sourdough dough and kinda of liked it. Not one for me."
"*Trader's Note: Thanks to nflmvp for the bottles!"
"An excellent Wee Heavy. Unless you absolutely hate malt bombs, this is a must try."
"An interesting beer that has decent balance for the unique flavor that it has."
"D - this is a very tasty, easy drinking brew."
"Autumn colored beer with a large, frothy head. Aroma mainly dominated by contamination, or you could say unpleasant smells not common in scotch ales. No rich malts, mainly just wild yeast and funk in the nose. Flavor is sour, clearly contaminated and not right. Remember having this several years ago and it was great, but this bottle has some serious issues."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's lighter and less sweet than most in the style which makes it more sessionable than your typical Scotch Ale. Overall, it's worth drinking several of if you're in the mood for the style."
"The drinkability is good, a fine example of the style not my favorite but close. Prosit, MK"
"Pours a dark brown with amber highlights. Thick, creamy light tan head. Wonderful malty aroma on the nose. It has an interesting sweetness to it. There's cocoa, caramel, dark fruit and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel seems a little watery for a Scotch Ale, yet it's still smooth. Warped Speed is a huge malty Scottish Ale. Flavors of smoked malt and chocolate dominate. There's an intriguing cocoa sweetness to it that arrives midway and lingers into the long finish. Nicely done."
"Body is a bit disappointing; it is rather thin, adding to its drinkability but taking away from what I like in scotch ales; taste is malty and caramelized, but has little depth or complexity. An OK beer."
"drinkability is good. this is a solid brew with good concentration and flavor complexity. the flavors work well together and produce a good example of a scotch ale. cheers!"
"Solid heavyness, and easy drinker, probably around 6% here, not sure but a great choice for a session beer, could have 3-4 easy, glad I got a 6 pack."
"Overall I thought this one was excellent. It really crept up on me with how good it was, and I would have no issues at all with trying this one again any day. Definitely a top not beer that I would love to get a hold of again any day!"
"Well, daggum if this didn't produce one of the biggest, creamiest heads I think that I've ever seen! It looked like a Jamocha milkshake from Arby's and as it slowly fell, it left some really stick lacing in its wake. The beer itself was a slightly hazy deep amber color. The nose was very malty sweet with a hint of coconut and milk chocolate. Mouthfeel was on the thick side with a chocolaty flavor on the tongue. The finish was equally sweet, but with a lingering smoky aftertaste. It was pretty good for the style, but I am just not a fan of Scotch Ales. That said, given that it is apparently available in prefilled growlers, I'd be willing to give it another try."
"Pours a pretty clear dark reddish/orange and brown, thick off white head forms, drops a ton of lacing behind, solid layer and ring, looks real nice. Smell is nice, sweet and caramelized, very earthy, some bread, light chocolate, super malty, brown sugar, on the sweet side but nice. Taste is wow, toasted bread, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, very malty, earthy, rich, excellent flavour, alcohol is well hidden, balanced chewy finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth, super smooth. Excellent stuff, thanks Scott!"
"I bought this single serve 12oz from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"D- pretty solid beer"
"And now that my review is all wrapped up... time to pour myself a little Scotch Whisky to drink beside it."
"I am not the biggest lover of this style, but being a big sweetooth I did want to get more out of it. Still, I appreciate the quality that it brings to the table. I still have a bottle left, so we'll see how my palate evolves over time. :)"
"A super smooth, nicely drinkable scotch ale that could easily become a household favorite if locally available."
"drinkability - Very nice beer to drink, would buy this again, only thing is I received it in a trade."
"Overall a good beer when judging all the qualities. There was more Brussels lace as the beer continued to warm and the volume continued to drop in the glass."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. fruitier than i'd expect, but nice. thanks jeff!"
"D - Overall, this Scotch Ale is not really my cup of tea. It seems to be an interesting take on the style that deserves recognition, but the tart yeastiness takes away from the comforting, warm malts that make Scotch Ales so alluring at this time of year."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth, giving this a very good drinkability. This was the only bottle that I had, but hopefully i will be able to get some more in the future."
"Bottle: Poured a deep mahogany color ale with a medium head with some retention and average lacing characteristics. Aroma of sweet malt is dominating with some barley wine like feel. Taste is dominated by some very sweet malt with no peat like malt. I noticed a metallic aftertaste which I didnt like very much. I thought this was totally off-style and I didnt appreciated very much overall- cant figure out what all the hype is about on this one."
"D: The big taste makes for a great drink. As I said, let 'er warm up a bit first."
"Smoky, tea-like flavors...dry, earthy peat. Husky grain, caramel, smoked malt, earthy hop bitterness in the finish. A clean finish too, long residual boldness in the flavors. Even though this is likely best fresh, after a year it still has very distinctive and unique characteristics. Very drinkable, and my favorite Scotch Ale."
"Pours a beautiful deep brown with deep burgundy and mahogany highlights. Good head and lacing, caramel nose. The flavor is nicely assertive, malty and roasty (even a little smoky) and caramel. A little nuttiness and maybe even butterscotch lurking in the background. Nice hoppy finish for a Scotch ale, even a bit of a sour aftertaste (in a good way). This used to be one of my favorite styles, but I'd lost interest the last few years. Lake Louie Warped Speed has brought it back. Recommended."
"D: It's good, but the flavour is a little too bold to session."
"D- Drinkability is very good. This is a nice summer or fall ale for those who want a stronger flavor without too much body."
"Good beer from Lake Louie. Every one I've had from them so far has been solid. Could use a little tweaking, if only to make a good beer great, but definately an enjoyable brew."
"Poured into a chalice a grapey color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head, leaves some small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly oaky, cherries, figs, raisins, and some caramel. The taste is malty/oaky, nice presents of dark fruit, some tanginess, nice touch of caramel. The finish is dry. Light-Medium body, kinda watery, a good thing because it almost goes down like water, lol A complex brew. Very drinkable, I/you could drink a few of these before you know it, easily."
"D: Wonderful balance, complex aroma and flavor, just a pleasure to drink. I'd love to have more of this excellent beer."
"The most important components of this beer (smell and taste) were complex and wonderful. I wished the mouthfeel could have held up better, but overall it was a great beer and I would easily try it again..."
"Mouth is nice with passive carbonation that is very subtle. Ultimately it's like Georges St. Pierre said to Matt Hughes, ""I am not impressed with your perform-ance."" Did this taste good? Yes. Does it fit the style imo? No."
"Taste is quite fine, a thick malty brew, something deserving of the style and name. A potent malting, full of flavors, caramel, raisin, molasses, figs, a bit smoky perhaps, a slightly biting alcohol, some spices, sweet, bitter, just a heap of goodness, a meal unto itself. The mouth is thick, smooth and creamy, just right carbonation, warm and tingly, sooo go. Scotch ales aren't really my thing, but I've had several lately, lots of good ones too, and this one much be tops, its a damn good brew and were I to have a sixer of this beer, I'd develop a real addiction to this style. Very well done, and huge thanks to nflmvp once again."
"I had high hopes for Warped Speed Scotch Ale prior to cracking the crown. While I was (slightly) disappointed initially, my expectations were met by the final ounce or two. I have a feeling that the Scotch ale of my dreams is in my cellar at this very moment... in the form of Louie's Reserve Scotch Ale. I'm looking forward to seeing how that higher octane version stacks up against this standard version. Which, by the way, is highly recommended."
"Pours a nice little head with some coaxing and has a seemingly very nice little lacing. The color is dark brown with an amber hue. The first smell was a little weak, but there's a slight sweetness to it that doesn't seem to fit just right. The smell is very light, it has the sweet smell and almost no roasty characteristics at all. The taste is a little watery, it has a little roastiness present with some light sweet tones to it as well. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth and didn't have anything wrong with it besides a small amount of watery feel to it. Overall I might actually try this again."
"Originally reviewed on December 30, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. Sweet caramel malt and pear aroma. Deep brown murky color, with a creamy tan head. Heavily nutty flavor, with hazelnuts and pecans over cream and butter. Palate is wicking, almost immeadiately evaporating and dissapating, but for a Scottish Ale respectable. Unfortunately, at the end over the dry nutty smack a blast of stryofoam."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3 1/2"" tan head over the cloudy reddish brew. Head fades VERY slowly, with lots of heavy sticking lace. Aroma is rich sweet maltiness. Flavor is chocolate sweet upfront, with light bitterness, and the malts carry through from beginning to end. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and drinkability is excellent. Liked this better from the growler, but the bottled offering is definitely nothing to sneeze at either. Would accept some of this anytime anyone had some available for me."
"A smidgen thin bodied and fizzy, but thats just nit-picking. This was a solid fall/winter sipper  indoors or out. I guess the WI guys sit on the ice, fishin, with this."
"Drinkability is good dark, fruity and smokey with nice hops flavors a touch more then normal for the style but its good. Thanks go to dirtylou for this brew."
"Thanks jpm30 for this simple bottle of great fresh scotch style. Thick dark brown foam and lace. Taste of light roast and smoke and tabacco, well hopped, nicely malted. Full mouthfeel. Whatever the alcohol, its well hidden and enabled clarity and room for another beer after."
"Thanks to Stonecrusher for adding this to an already overflowing box."
"D: Definately a drinkable offering from Lake Louie. Glad I got to try this fantastic offering."
"This is a very flavorful beer and highly enjoyable. With all the good qualities of both a fine porter and a strong ale this Scotch Ale does a good job both getting and keeping your attention throughout the entire brew."
"Thanks to murrayswine for the bottle."
"stellar example of the style, wish i had more of these to drink. midwestern trading buddies, you might as well go buy me a sixer cause thats what ill be searching for during our next dealing..."
"Nice 30 second finish that leaves an creamy, somewhat resiny mouthfeel. Very pleasing and drinkable. Thanks to nflmvp for this treasure."
"Mouthfeel is slightly thin with hints of caramel and candy lingering."
"I haven't been into malty beers for a while, usually opting for hop-driven brews, and this is a nice change of pace. With how tasty this is, I think I may switch up my selection a bit more. I used to be really into balanced session styles, but I've become a reluctant hop-head. This is a good one to remind me that malt driven brews can be just as delicious."
"-UF"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with plenty of carbonation, but it's not aggressive. Goes down rather smooth and each sip has me coming back for more. I wish this wasn't my last bottle as I would have no problem drinking another. Lake Louie has impressed me so far...and this just gives me a good reason to get back up to Wisconsin and grab some more sixers!!"
"Music: ""Sigh"" by Praful"
"Well, Lake Louie Warped Speed is 9% abv. I've been to bars and had two pints and they laid me out. I can drink a few of these because they're so delicious, but I probably shouldn't. I just can't give full points for drinkability either. A great value to boot at about $8 a six pack. Usually one bottle while I do my homework is plenty. Glad I live in Wisconsin."
"cellared 9 months: Still drinking well, though the carbonation seems a little more fizzy at this point. The profile does seem to have changed, and the roasted and toasted malts have moved further towards the forefront, with some peaty notes on the nose. The nose has flourished but the flavor seems to have lost just a little of its original appeal."
"Beer is good. Happy scotch beering."
"Bottle shared by crosling at a BA gathering. What a great time I had. Pours a thin light brown head over a cloudy brown red liquid. Smells caramel butter. A light and dancing flower that I can't quite put my finger on? A little bit of honey and some green apple. A small bit of citrus carried by a pleasing waft of alcohol. Tastes butterscotch with a nice caramel and munich malt aftertaste that just hangs around forever. Dry mixes with the slick butterscotch in a pleasing combination. A hint of sour green apple adds an underlying edge of complexity. Hops I can't identify, but may be the darkish flavor that held like deep baratone ""oohhhmmmm"". Md body and moderately carbonated. What a wonderful beer."
"I will skip the look and smell since they were not especially unique or outstanding and are well captured by others. The big ones are the taste, mouthfeel and drinkability. The taste is fantastic. Big malty goodness with an incredible sweetness like a doppelbock but a bit more subtle. The body is just as incredible making for a looong lasting aftertaste even with a small sip. Caramel, hop bitterness and a malty goodness all in perfect balance making this a truly unique and satisfying brew. Thanks to dirtylou for this excellent WI beer."
" This one keeps reminding me of sweet rolls with honey butter, warmed over a woodsy campfire of burning maple logs. Very Yummy! I'm amazed that a Wisconsin brewery can execute a Scottish Wee Heavy better than so many of the native breweries. Wish I could find this one in Kentucky, Virginia, or Ohio. Thanks again, Kevin."
"Want more. Want more. Want more. Want more. Want more. Want more. Found this glass empty long before its time."
"Pours a murky maple brown, pretty much completely lacking a head or lacing. Glows. Nose has caramel and chocolate malts, smoke, and some piney hops. Simply smells terrific. A fair amount of hop bittering in the taste balances the sweet caramel and chocolate well. Ridiculously smooth mouthfeel could almost be mistaken for watery, but it's deceivingly big. Warped Speed is a little piece of heaven in a bottle."
"This is truly a wonderful scotch ale. If you come to wisconsin you must seek it out. Luckily they are available everywhere, at least here in Madison."
"Relish it. Seek it out. Try this beer!"
"D- This is an amazing beer with wonderful malt complexity and layers but it is a little low in carbonation and it would be great to have a bit more alcohol. However it is not too sweet and the finish is medium-dry so it works quite well without the alcohol. Well done."
"Edit: 2.5 hours in, I've finished a little over 2.5 pints and I am seriously buzzed. At first you really don't notice the alcohol, but as each pint warms you can taste that alcohol bite even more. This ""wee heavy"" lives up to its name....it really packs a punch. Delicious, but definitely in moderation. I've never been so effected after 2.5 pints. Yeeesh. Kudos, Lake Louie -- I have met my match."
"Slàinte mhath!"
"Pours a dark brown color with a small head that fades fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of malty goodness and has a slight smokiness. The flavor is very nice with huge malt character. Lots of dark and creamy flavors with a hint of spice and a tiny bit of smoke. Very tasty. Drinks very easily too."
"About what it would be like enjoying a beer infused Jolly Rancher while sitting around a campfire."
"From a growler poured into a snifter. It pours a deep caramel brown color with one finger of head that dies off quickly. The smell is very rich and malty. Lots of sweet roasted malt with just a hint of alcohol. The taste is heavenly! Malty malty and also malty. Lots of toffee sweetness coming through, and the alcohol is kept to a minimum. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and smooth. The drinkability is great for a beer that is probably high in alcohol. Thanks to Kevin for sharing this brew with me!"
"Grabbed a growler while in Madison. Tonight seemed like a good night to break it out. It pours a deep ruby color with a finger of head that falls to a slight coat over the beer. The nose is very nice, with a sweet caramel and slight fruity base. There is a sweet smokeyness in there as well. Its very enticing. The flavor is right on there with the nose, but with a slight pepperyness on the finish. I like that pepperyness. There is also a slight hint of hop bitterness on the finish as well. The feel is moderate to thick with a small carb. Overall, this really is a nice brew. I wish I knew the ABV, as it is so smooth and drinkable. I like it. Very good Scotch ale."
"Appearance is near perfect - clear caramel/ruby color, but the head didn't last long enough. Aroma is mostly caramel with some alcohol thrown in. The first thing that hits you on the first sip is the creamy smooth mouthfeel. Very silky and luxurious. The malt takes the form of wonderful caramel covered dark fruit, which really slides down the throat with ease. Some mild smokiness shows up in the finish, as well as a mild hop bitterness which really makes you want that next sip. I could drink a ton!"
"Drinkability is near perfection. Coats the palate and leaves such a pleasant balance of sweet malt and roasted notes that I can't imagine a better representation of this style. Great brew, worth all the good words written."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a quickly fading large head. Smell is sweet, earthy, nutty, chocolatey, just simply magnificant. Taste is so sweet and smooth on the mouth. The malts really stick out here, as they should in a scotch ale, but the depth of this brew is incredible. Caramel, and earthy flavors pop through, maybe some smokey wood flavors. All I can say is if you are in south central Wisconsin go and buy yourself some of this brew. This is only my second growler of this stuff and I am in complete love. If only it were available near me. Second only to its big brother the scotch reserve."
"64 ounce growler. This beer has a dark reddish brown color with a creamy tan head. The aroma is sweet, slightly burnt, creamy, chocolatey, buttery caramel. Huge malty flavor with chocolate and caramel, but not too sweet. Malt flavor turns to smokiness, like smoked salmon. Very complex, and a great combination of flavors. Perfect medium to full mouthfeel. I'm not sure what the abv of this beers is, but it is dangerously drinkable. I finished a growler in one evening. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone, especially fans of Scotch style ales."
"Buddy of mine picked me up a growler of this (and Tommy's Porter) and what a treat it was. This was very fresh tasting scotch with a wonderful caramel, toffee taste. The color is nice and dark with a little red-orange backlight. The head wasn't large, but I didn't expect it to be. The sweet malt aroma filled the nostrils and the sweetness on the tongue was an excellent finish. The alcohol was nicely hidden, but I can tell this one is pretty-heavily leaded based on the sommersaults my mind started doing. This one could be a dangerous one to belly up at the bar with all night, but not difficult. Get a growler of this now!"
"My 3rd Lake Louie beer so far, all thanks to Mr. C., and not a one has been less than a joy! If only they'd come a little closer to my house, and not stay way off in Wisconsin, I'd be a happier 'monk than I am now!"
"Excellent craft yet again from Lake Louie. It's hard to pass on the ones you know you like to try out the rest. Porter or Cream Ale next? Stop reading this and try it for yourself. :D"
"Mouthfeel must be experienced to be appreciated. Silken just does not seem to do it justice. Serve this at cellar temp and be prepared."
"Many thanks to cokes for this growler."
