4.24,5.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, almost opaque, ruby-brown coloring with a halo of off-white head. Aromas of caramel sweetness, molasses, chocolate, earthy notes, a subtle booze character, sweet cream, and some vanilla. Smells big and rich! Flavors are sugary sweet and heavily roasted forward, with tangy caramel and sweet cream blending together over a boozy undertone. Highlights of chocolate and molasses dart in and out. There are also some notes of earth and floral highlights there to layer this beer a bit more. Roasted notes throughout, and the increased ABV is hidden very well in this beer. Full and robust in mouth, it remains smooth through to the finish. The aftertaste is rich and sweet, with all of the caramel, nut, and cream notes lingering on subtly. Very tasty beer.","GarthDanielson","Mar 20, 2015"

The nose is a rich bouquet of caramel malts, woodsy notes, smoke, and a hint of booze. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy; in the best opulently rich way. The flavor follows the nose with lots of sweet toffee malt, earthy peat, and gently warming alcohol. I'm a big fan of both Dark Horse and Scotch ales and this is one of my favorites.

The bourbon barrel-aged flavor was a bit of a surprise, but since I like that style variant, it was a good surprise. I'll look forward to having Scotty again and will definitely want to have one when I drive over to the brewery in Marshall, Michigan.","breakingbland","Jul 27, 2013"

Perhaps that is how they anticipate one will feel after a bottle of this beer. We shall see. Holy hot, Batman! I got a good whiff of booze in pouring this one into my glass. I got a brief appearance of (maybe) a finger of deep-tan head that quickly fell to swirling wisps. Color was a slightly hazy cola-brown. Nose smelled of dried, dark fruit(s), leather, lemon zest and al-kee-haul. Whee! Mouthfeel was medium with an initial alcohol heat followed by notes of toffee, leather, dried fruit, and brown sugar. Finish was semi-dry with the alcohol heat accounting for this in the face of all of the sugary flavors involved. This really packed a wallop, even for me. I would recommend that you at least try it once and if you are a fan of the style (which I am not), you will be head over heels for it.","woodychandler","Jun 08, 2013"

The liquid is a murky orange rust to reddish brown mud, lots of particulate floating around, barely lightens to yellow at the outer reaches. The nose evokes a bakery full of German chocolate cake, caramel covered pastries and butterscotch, nice for the amplitude of the scents without heavy clinging in the nostrils, spreads further into hazelnut coffee, cola and some poached apricot fruit, not that alcoholic, minimal hops presence. Medium to full-bodied, slight fizz during the mouth entry but the carbonation overall is lacking. Smokier here with tar, sauna stone and scorched camp fire earth notes, delays the entrance of the chocolate, toffee, butterscotch and honey, more yeast and bread dough. Past the mid-palate dries out, this before the apricot, peach, golden raisin and orange citrus really take hold. As in the nose hides its ABV well. Could use something to stiffen it and create more energy in lieu of carbonation. Otherwise, it comes across as a traditional rendition of the style.","farrago","Mar 25, 2013"

Huge caramel malt, fresh moist bran muffins, some grain, and just a whiff of clean alcohol on the nose. An absolute malt bomb. Bread crust, freshly baked lightly sweet dark bread, hints of caramel and toffee. Moderate carbonation fights through the creamy, full body and shows up here and there; a bit of syrupy accents on the edges. Heavy, but creamy and ridiculously smooth. This is just a fantastic brew and one of my favorite Scotch Ales. You'd be hard-pressed to find one that tops it.","chanokokoro","Jan 10, 2013"

The flavor follows suit with a mellow prune malt and vague chocolate caramel. There's a tart herbal-grass hop that blends smoothly with the dark fruit.

Pours very cloudy dark reddish brown color with a good 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, apple, toasted biscuit, peat, leather, raisin, toffee, light chocolate, and spices. Very nice and complex aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, smoke, toasted biscuit, toffee, apple, raisin, wood, light chocolate, earth, and spices. Light spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, smoke, molasses, and wood on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance with a good amount of robustness; and absolutely no cloying sweetness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, lush, and slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is insanely well hidden for being almost 10%, with only a small warming well after the finish. Extremely smooth to sip on for such a big beer; drinks much smoother than some lower gravity beers. Overall this is a fantastic scotch ale! Great balance of flavors with good complexity; and extremely smooth.","superspak","May 09, 2012"

It tries hard, and occasionally delivers, but is simultaneously constrained by some typical strong-ale problems. The smell is excellent and enticing, providing a bookend that is complemented by the far finish of pungent and dry umami. Along the way acidity plays too large a role and flavors take too long of a break in the third quarter. In the final tally it is worth drinking for the volatile dried mushroom aftertaste alone.","beagle75","Feb 03, 2012"

Poured into a Boulevard tulip. Color is a reddish brown with a 1/4 inch head that stayed throughout. Smell was boozy, with the typical bourbon nose of this type. Taste was not overly hot with great hints of caramel, and oak. The finish lingered although not as long as BB. Mouthfeel was on the thinker side, which is what I want from Scotch Ale. Overall this is very nice, balanced beer and a great example of the style. Its very clean and does not have the twinge that you get from BB at the end. A pretty good substitute for Backwoods Bastard, which is not easy to achieve but is lacking in the overall mix of flavors that Founders provides. I will definitely be looking for this again!!!!

Lots of sweet notes taking over on this one, with hints of caramel, vanilla and nice earthy grains starting to come to the front. Definitely, some wood somewhere in its history as the aroma of oak was huge on this one. Lots of caramel and vanilla starting to take shape here, really lightning it up and make it that much sweeter. Next up in the lineup was a full on assault of the oak and wood flavors that were coming through earlier. Strong hints of oak and bourbon dominating it here, really giving it a deep flavor and pronounced presence. ever so slightly dry hop finish. Really quite complex and very nice indeed.","mikesgroove","Nov 21, 2011"

3.93,-2.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a murky brown, toffee color that is hazy to the point of opaque. About two centimeters of fluffy, bubbly, cream-colored head develops and lingers briefly. Minimal lacing is left on the glass as scattered patches of bubbles. The nose is a bit subdued, but scotch, a bit of grain, some lighter (English?) malt, and earthen notes are present. The aroma is pleasant, just hard to detect. It tastes of earthen grass, faint malt, peaty scotch, some odd, citrusy fruits, and a rush of smoky grain at the end. Alcohol is completely hidden. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected, but not in a bad way. It is crisp on the tongue and finishes clean, adding to the drinkability greatly. Overall, a highly drinkable scotch ale that I could happily return to.","eclipse54","Nov 10, 2011"

Not as sweet and powerful as something like Skull Splitter, Scotty Karate errs on the side of session ale (though at 9.75%, it ought to be a short session) in it's ability to hide it's alcohol and leave the palate unburdened by thickness or sugar.","gigaknight","Oct 06, 2011"

The sweet maltiness coupled with a degree of fruitiness in the aroma brought to mind children's breakfast cereals. The color was a murky brown with a touch of reddish hue. The taste was a robust maltiness with a sweet banana candy flavor. This is not a scotch ale that one forgets a few minutes after it fits your tongue. Very smooth going down and easy to drink, Scotty Karate ends with a mildly sweet yet tart aftertaste. As a fan of the style, this may be the best Scotch Ale I have had.","JohnnyHopps","Aug 19, 2011"

Smell is sweet, malty, fruity, ethanol-y. Wow that's not what I expected on the nose, quite complex and different. Caramel, toffee, juicy dark fruit, toffee, hints of smoke and chocolate. Taste is sweet up front with a hint of chocolate, juicy fruits mixed with caramel midway through, long lingering sweet fruit and alcohol heat in a fairly dry finish. Body is a bit lighter than medium, light level of carbonation with a sweet sugary watery mouthfeel. This smells fantastic, looks horrible and tastes pretty good.

The taste of the beer has a really nice sweetness throughout, it's a very malty brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy feeling with some light carbonation.

The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, and slight peat. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. It had a definite peat presence going on here, but was not overly invasive to the palate. I'm not a big peat fan so this was a nice compromise for me. The flavor and aroma were very nicely balanced.

The nose comprises caramel, toffee, mandarin oranges, a touch of peat-smoked malt, and red apples. The taste holds notes of cinnamon, cherrywood-smoked honey-baked ham, cocoa, caramel, and a hint of oak. The body is a hefty medium, with a somewhat light moderate carbonation, a slightly chewy feel, and a dry finish.

The malty dominates the taste (surprise!) from front to back, with a dried fruit and caramel sweetness blending in at the end. A hearty feel, with a chewy texture and clings to the palate.

Look at the label."" Sure enough, for a Scotch ale this thing is over-hopped. The hops aren't very apparent in the aroma, and the slightly smoky malt is the dominant force. But the taste tilts toward citrus and even seaweed. I like nori as much as the next sushi lover, but not in my beer. If you're looking for a good American Scotch ale, you'll do far better with those from Geary or Founders. Leave this one on the shelf.","gfreed","Dec 18, 2010"

The aroma is coated with scotch, boozy toffee, thick malts and a slight fruity presence. Solid flavors on this one to. Again, scotch with a big malt backbone and a slight spiciness to it a toffee sweetness. This is kickin'! Kind of a light body and low carbonation, this is solid but I think I'd like it more if it were a bit heavier. This drinks real nice for a near ten percent beer.

4.4,9.2,4,4,5,4,4,"I got to say I was really impressed with this one. Pours a dark amber, sort of hazy but not as dark as a porter just slightly dark. Had a half inch of head. Smells of slight bourbon, caramel malts, and faint hops. Taste was amazing for almost 10 percent, you get faint alcohol then a bite of hops to mellow, then the sweet caramel finish. Mouthfeel didn't seem that heavy at all with a medium kind of body. I was assuming the entire time it was around 8 percent! Drink ability is kind of good if I were to find it again but this one was on tap at a place in south side so I may find a bottle of this stuff floating around somewhere. The best part was the tap handle was a shotgun shaped and they said everyone always asked ""whats on the shotgun?"" Smooth beer.","DrDemento456","Dec 07, 2010"

Pine sap bitterness on the end tastes out of place and overly-complex. At least the near 10% ABV is well-hidden.

4.05,0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Brown bottle with no freshness indication to be found but with nearly 10% abv we wont have any issues here. Pours a clear dark amber/brown with a finger of khaki colored head. Head receeds fairly fast with an audible crackling of the bubbles. It disperses to just a thin film on top of the beer supported by pretty much constant bubbles of carbonation. Aroma is...wow. This is the first time I can truely thank myself for being a homebrewer and being able to identify the unmistakeable aroma of pete smoked barley. The nose also includes other malt and an vibrant alcohol presence. Taste is inline with the smell of the beer. Pete smoked barley creastes the minor illusion of sipping scotch. Flavors of heavy malt, smoke, oak and alcohol prevail. Medium to heavy feel would seem more full bodied if it didnt have such a modest amount of carbonation. Very drinkable to the point of being dangerous considering it flirts with double digits worth of alcohol. Lingering taste of the pete'd barley is left in the mouth. Very nicely done overall with the only gripe that the amount of the pete smoked character pretty much overwhelms the other flavors this beer could have shown. As it warms, a little note of sweet caramel comes through the smokiness and the alcohol remains notably warming.","stakem","Mar 22, 2010"

Nice sized head. Good amount of lacing. Smell was malty and smoky. In the taste, there was definitely a peaty flavor, but it was much more subdued that other scotch ales I have had recently. I think it prefer it this way actually. The scent and flavor of smoke and peat is there, but it doesn't overpower the beer. Very much just a nice background aspect. Smooth body, could be a bit thicker, but that might reduce its drinkability. High abv is certainly noticeable about halfway through the glass. A great beer, surely worth a try from a brewery that is just gaining some presence in the Mass market.","morebeergood","Mar 15, 2010"

The nose has peat, smoke, chocolate, caramel, and again, some smoke. Taste has all the aspects of a good strong Scotch Ale that I like, such as the smells listed above. What I am amazed by is how well balanced this beer is. Sometimes Scotch Ales can come off a bit one sided or dirty, but everything works really well here. One can also really get the Scotch aspect from a beer like this. The 9% provides a very nice warming sensation to accompany all of the complexities going on. It definitely feels like a full bodied beer, while at the same time coming off very elegant and drinkable. One of the best Scotch Ales I have ever encountered without a doubt.

Pours a murky dark cola amber brown with ruby highlights when held toward the light. Head was quickly dwindling highly carbonated fizzy sounding as it settled, kind of a turn off at first with minimal head left behind. Aroma has a caramel plum fruit and raisin infused booziness at first sniff. With my first sip in addition to caramel, plum, raisin and booze I get an oak barrel or tree bark bitterness with evident smoked malts gathering on the palate together a touch of whiskey and vanilla this is complex like some herbal tea with a whiskey chaser blended with birch syrup root beer if that makes sense at all. With my next few sips the smoke meat characteristic even jumps into the party I'm sure this may be peated malt at this point but it's really riding a wave with carbonation that is sharp but not too lively. Mouthfeel overall is a bit cloying for me, at this point the carbonation is sharp but not lively it kind of lands flat as soon as the initial harshness passes the palate, but a smoked meat syrup layer is left behind with some charred oak and minimal vanilla that bring the heat with it. Drinkability overall depends on what your into, me I'm having carbonation issues, but does that effect my experience as a whole. Final answer it has to because it effects the way that the other flavors are sensed on the palate. In this case I feel that smoked peated malt sensation overstays it's welcome yet makes the beer memorable in an extreme sort of way. Booze ridden for sure but this beer is going for all of that, I applaud the effort it was a fun experience but damn how many of these can or do I want to drink?","WVbeergeek","Dec 10, 2009"

Sweet like candy with notes of dark brown sugar, caramel, toffee. As the ale warms, notes of cherry and plum come through with a somewhat masked hint of citrus. At 9.75% ABV, the alcohol is very well concealed. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and rather syrupy, yet very creamy and smooth. Finishes very sweet as a Wee Heavy should.

This beer has a good flavor and with this mouthfeel, it flows across the palate pretty damn easy. (Almost feels like a cask ale out of a bottle.) A little bit of a dry, chalky aftertaste, but to me, it's appealing. The flavor doesn't carry over the roast and nuttiness from the nose....which is o.k. It's more of a peaty, smoky malt base with some juicy undertones of plum and raisin. Slightly lingering roasty bitterness. For 9.75% a/v, the alcohol is hidden quite nicely.

Pours a ruddied pale brown, with a rim of creamy off-white. Flavor finds warmer ground in a field of sweet alcohols, figs, middle malts, including a bit of roast in a smoky wisp of coffee dredge and cocoa powder, adding some unique depth to the beer. Not thin bodied, nor heavy. A pretty nice body, actually, well balanced by the soothing roast edges and a lemon-pepper hop smack. Great caramelization and nice construction.

4.17,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a murky, dark caramel color. The head bubbles up relatively slowly to form a thin layer and then abruptly breaks up into nothingness. The nose is strong--unabashedly malty and sweet with alcohol clearly there as well. Dark, ripe fruit comes through too. The taste follows suit, with sweet malts quickly yielding some space to dark fruit and alcohol. The malts invoke a dark, whole grain roll. This one clings to the mouth and tongue but finishes with a surprising bit of crispness. Goes down dangerously easily.","BitteBier","Jun 04, 2007"

Sometimes the ""smoke"" in Scotch Ales, to me, tastes like a phony flavoring. This seems very real and subtle and is very enjoyable. Unfortunately, with this much alcohol, this is not sessionable. Although, the brewers at Dark Horse did a commendable job of burying the alcohol flavors and aromas.","GbVDave","May 06, 2007"
4.1,1.7,4,4,4,5,4,"A light to medium brown Scotch Ale that pours with enough foam to create a quarter-inch beige head that falls to a collar of foam. This beer smells of a single malt with raisins, dates and alcohol. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a luxurious caramel malt flavor laced with a light bitterness that builds toward a surprisingly dry finish. Bitter roasted coffee with cream flavor. This beer picks a punch, so be careful!","marcobrau","Apr 15, 2007"

Aroma is malty sweet with notes of brown sugar, toffee, and dark fruits. Hints of smoke and floral hops. Medium body with low carbonation. Taste is sweetish malts balanced by a slight floral hops bitterness. Some dark fruits add more sweetness. The alcohol is slightly warming.

Aroma is highly sweet malts, dark fruits, plums and over-ripe apricots, some boubon maybe or some other liquer I can't distinguish. Taste is powerful, boubon, fruits, similar to aroma, but the mouth is kind of thinnish to medium, which doesn't mingle well with the noticably higher alcohol content. Its decently drinkable, but a bit quirky, as most Scotch Ales are for me I guess.","objectivemonkey","Feb 12, 2007"
3.65,-9.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a murky orangish brown with basically no head, even a fierce swirling produces only a few loose bubbles. Aroma is burnt paper, peaty and smoky, a little rubbery with some fruity malts behind it. Sweet and slightly syrupy on the tongue, the sweet berry and sugary maltiness is at first dominant in the taste but then is taken over in the finish by a bit of the smokiness and a nice small prickly tingle on the tongue. A medium dry finish. Overall a nice easy drinker, rich but not too rich, I enjoy the lack of carbonation and the nice bit of smokiness.","hoppymeal","Feb 05, 2007"

The aroma is awesomely malty and full of dark, toasted, fruits. The taste is a little more complex, bringing some caramel and moe specific fruits like , plums, prunes, and black cherries to round out the fruity malt. The alcohol mixes well with this malty obslaught. Could be better of a plain malt was detected than a just fruity malts.

4.53,12.4,4.5,4,5,5,4,"Pours exceedingly thick, just short of black, with dark mahogany edges and a deep, deep brown center. Huge head of yellow cream that fades to a collar and a dusting across the top of the body. The nose is very solid for a scotch ale, with raisin fruits, nice spiciness, lots of sweet smells (sweet cream, brown sugar, caramel), some Maris Otter and just a touch of raw alcohol. In the mouth, though, this beer is heaven. Rich and thick and silky, the malts slide over the tongue while just enough carbonation backs it up and wakes up the palate. Sweet cream, caramel, pears flambee and fruitcake, with a long, sweet, nutty finish at the end. There's a slight burn of alcohol here, but for a beer this big and this good, who cares? This beer grabs you and holds on, tickling your tongue for a good 60 seconds between sips (I counted). This beer could take the chill off a Scottish winter. Hell, it could take the chill off a Antarctic winter.","geexploitation","Jan 04, 2007"

Disappointed at the subtlty of the aroma. Sweet caramel flavor with dark fruits and an extremely well balanced citrus hoppiness and roasted malts in the finish.

Head quickly fades down to uneven swirly sections of small bubbles, with small amounts of bubbly lace here and there. Aroma is rich hearty sweet dark malt sweetness, heavy on the dark fruit, and prominent alcohol, yet not blow-torch booze levels. Taste is starts with light medium dark grain, hits with the dark fruits, cruises on to the plentiful warming alcohol, and then the aftertaste is the grain coming back and really opening up. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth over the tongue, and drinkability is nice in how this brew handles its abv in a responsible manner.

Taste is the smell and more, very very sweet, cloying even, though the warming tones that down substantially. A mountain of caramelized deep malts overload from the start as the peat and alcoholic spice battle to bring it in check the rest of the way through. Slightly piny hops, though very slight. I'd prefer a bit more, and less sweetness. Some white pepper through the peaty finish. Not bad. Mouthfeel is medium full with soft carbonation, but a definite sipper.","numenor1","Mar 23, 2006"

That being said there is a nice harmony within the malt flavors with the mild bitterness providing a counterpoint, whose absence would spell disaster for this brew.

Some notes of lacing, and a medium level of carbonation. Sweet aromas of raspberry, hops, corn laced malts, caramel. Some herbal earth elements as well. Nice. Taste is medium to medium full bodied; buttery malts and sharp hops develop into a fruity, estery, butterscotch mix, with some herbs dancing about the tongue. Mouthfeels is medium bodied, kind of slick and buttery, with the alcohol making it's presence noted with a slight warming on the palate. Fair drinkability, as this is a sipper, and one will do just fine. Nevertheless, this a darn good beer, and one i'd like to have again. Worth seeking out and trying.","Frozensoul327","Mar 04, 2006"
