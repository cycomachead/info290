4.11,1.2,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but I started to get a little worried when I got to the aroma and the barrel aspect was pretty light, but it made up for in the taste with more barrel flavors and some really nice balance.  This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, fairly sticky, a little silky, not too crisp, a little warming, slightly filling and the taste did a good job of holing my attention, one glass might be the perfect amount for me, but I know I'll have no problem drinking the whole bottle by myself even though it is a little warming.  What I liked the most about this beer was the taste, it was very nice and it was just what I expect from the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were pretty nice, but they still could have used just a little work.  I would buy this beer again and I wish I had another bottle to cellar and see how it changes over time.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes barrel aged scotch ales.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and a little impressed, I started to doubt it a little, but when I  got to the taste it really delivered and I ended up enjoying it.  Since I did a comparison between Wulver Backwoods Bastard recently I'm confident in saying this is my third favorite of the style with Backwoods coming in second and wulver first, but they are all pretty close to being on the same level.  Good job guys, this was a tasty barrel aged Scotch Ale, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Dec 07, 2014"

Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak, light smoke/roast, light nuttiness, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak, light smoke/roast, light nuttiness, and yeast/aok earthiness on the finish for a while. Slight earthy/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut, light smoke/roast, light nuttiness, nd yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible robustness and complexity of big dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a fantastic malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged scotch ale! All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 06, 2014"

4.09,0.7,4,4.25,4,4.25,4,"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 06/19/14.  Served in a thistle glass, the beer pours a murky reddish/brown color with about a half inch light tan head.  Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like toffee, vanilla, bourbon, caramel, and some dark fruit (raisin, plum).  The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some peaty smoke and brown sugar, and there's a bit of apple noticeable as the beer warms up.  It's also a little boozy, but not too much.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and a bit syrupy with moderate carbonation.  I think it's a good brew, maybe I should have picked up another bottle to see how it ages.  $13.99 a bomber.","bluejacket74","Sep 24, 2014"

Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I can't believe, with the other amazing beers Clown Shoes puts out, that this was what they were shooting for. While this one was definitely a big let down, I'll be looking forward to next year's release! Hopefully they decide to go back and do some tweaking!

4.13,1.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"O: a nice BA Wee Heavy. Not as good as Wulver or Backwoods Bastard but overall pretty good. Still a bit hot, glad I picked up a couple so I can sit on them for awhile. Priced at 12.99 for the Bomber is way more expensive than Bastard but essentially the same as Wulver. Really enjoy this style, glad to have another good example.","Docrock","Jul 03, 2014"
