Given my inability to find much beer under the bourbon, combined with the serious alcohol heat that poured out of this as it warmed, it's not a favorite for me.

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear ruby topped by a short finger of light sandstone foam.  The nose comprises deep bourbon, toffee, light dark greens, and a bit of mild buttery biscuit.  The taste holds notes of whiskey, caramel malts, light chocolate, mild dark greens, and some brief flashes of oak.  The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this is just as good as assumptions would lead you to believe it would be.  Very good times, indeed.","TMoney2591","Nov 11, 2014"

The peated malt comes through more in the taste, rich with some earthy peat complexity, still identifiable as the base beer, with layers of bourbon barrel characteristics over the top. Rich and burly with a low to medium carb level. Slight alcohol bite in the finish, but it's tempered by the big malt sweetness, though not fully disguised. In the end the bourbon character slightly overshadows, but at least there was some nuance from the base Scotch Ale.
