review_text
"A super dark opaque brown with a light brown head. spots and streaks on the glass. Nose has so much to offer and delight in. The bourbon is well represented without being too big. It sets a platform that allows the malt of the ale to offer toffee and caramel against the notes of smoked cherry and dark fruit sweetness. A hint of oak. Some toasted coconut and vanilla flows throughout. Taste is superb. Balanced and complex. Lots of Scotch ale in the front with its typical burnished maltiness. Cherries and vanilla follow with the oak dryness leading to a mild hop presence. Lots of subtle complexities, caramel and dark fruits, toffee and roasted grains.  Feel is full and creamy with just a few points off for a bit of thinness that seems to affect the bottle I'm having. Last one seemed a bit better carbonated. Still a good feeling glass this time around with a mild smooth feel and satisfying swallow. A stupendous beer al the way around. The seemingly perfect melding of Scotch ale and bourbon barrels has me wondering about the prominence of stout instead of a good wee heavy. This is just outstanding."

"Never had a scotch ale before..kinda reminds me of a barleywine. .but maybe because this is barrel aged?..I dunno but it's good and I'll seek out more of this type"

"O: Fantastic, fantastic beer. Deep malt complexity with a natural bourbon barrel flavor blended in and vanilla character taking center stage. CW again and again blows me away."

"2013 bottle as a trade extra. Pours murky brown amber color with a small off white head that recedes quickly. Beautiful bourbon aroma with plenty of vanilla, oak, toffee, caramel, brown sugar. Flavor is lots of brown sugar, raisins, vanilla and marshmallow finish, bourbon, toffee, oak, a tad of metallic oxidization. Big body, some booziness, medium plus carbonation, smooth long finish. Nice brew and deserved love in the style."

"An incredible brew that has lots of similarities to Backwoods Bastards with a hint more mouthfeel and sweetness."
"O- This is a great beer.  So glad I had it and would always try it again."
""
""
"Overall - It's very slick and the butterscotch flavor almost takes over.  The bourbon keeps it pretty interesting, though."
""
""
""
""

"This is a fantastic beer. The bourbon barrels worked overtime on this majestic offering. The nose is as expected with rich toffee and a classic bourbon scent. The smooth, almost creamy beverage is a comfortable on the tongue. The flavor is sweet, with a sense of higher abv than the beer offers. The nice tingle in the back of the mouth is reminiscent of a well aged bourbon. This one is a case purchase and store."

"Overall really nice smell, nice body, and a good blend of flavors. Would happily drink again."
""
""
""
"Overall: So glad I picked this up again. I didn't fall in love with it last year, but this fresh bottle is fantastic. If it's in your market, it is well worth the $13-ish 4-pack price. I'd rank it ahead of this year's BBA Stout but just behind BBA BW. Would be awesome if this were aged in some Highland barrels."
"CW brings it again, it seems like they can't miss on their barrel program."
""
""
""
""
"Drank this at nearly room temp and was fairly well blown away. This viscous concoction pours a dark amber, with minimal head and oily lacing. The nose and taste are an explosion of vanilla and caramel and just the right amount of booze. This brew was good enough that I actually had regret after drinking it - I should have shared it with a buddy. One hell of a good scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: $3.49 for a bottle well spent."
"O - Lots of bourbon presence, a touch of heat as well."
""
""

"2013 bottle. Bottlecap and seal in good shape. Dark brown pour with a one-finger tan head. Cloudy appearance with lots of visible sediment throughout the beer, not just in the bottom of the bottle. Aroma features lots of sweet bourbon. A bit of sourness in the background. Nose is decent and reminds me of CW's BB Barleywine. Taste is sweet & bourbon up front that really pops. Some tanginess on the sides. A little roasty in the finish. Mostly the taste is about the sweet & bourbon. Mouthfeel is nice, pretty thick, a little syrupy. Below average carbonation. Overall it's a nice beer. 1.5 years of age haven't altered it much, from my recollection. Lots of sweetness, a little roast. Nice barrel presence."

"Overall: This beer is good to great, but the smell was the best part. I like how the flavors work in tandem, with nothing being too overwhelming. Now, I must try Backwoods Bastard one of these days in order to compare!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So drinkable it's crazy. I think I even prefer this to Backwoods Bastard."

"B"
"Pours deep reddish brown, medium light tan head, decent lacing built up around the glass. Aroma is sweet buttery raisin, red fruit, earthy toffee and hint of fudge, vanilla and bourbon finish. Taste is bourbon, toasted oak, brown sugar and cola, mild caramel sweetness, boozy bitter finish. Medium body, could use a bit more filling out."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"D - Smells great, lets you down on the taste. Doesn't live up to its description or hype. Felt that it needed more barrel aging. Probably would have liked it better in a blind taste test (not knowing it was barrel aged) or if I hadn't smelled it first."
""
""
""
"O- Another gem from Central Waters. One of the best scotch ales I've ever had and its shows that they really know their barrel aging. Want more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Served in a NODA snifter - kind of a muddy brown body and not much carbonation. This will instantly draw comparisons to Backwoods Bastard, which I tend to favor. This will also draw comparisons to the other barrel aged beers in the CW arsenal, which I also tend to favor. The body is a little thin and the barrel flavors are spot on, but could be turned up a notch in my opinion. Nice toffee notes throughout."

"O: Really nice, this is right up there with Backwoods as the finest Scotch ale I've had. Barrel character is nice, the touch of smoke is really welcome with the sweetness of the beer. Just balanced enough, but plenty of nice bourbon flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd love to side by side this and Backwoods some day but during the day I had this in Tampa it reminded me a ton of one of my favorites. Mouthfeel is something special and the Wee Heavy and Bourbon balance is great."
"O - Good flavor and decent depth and complexity."
"Really a well made, delicious beer.... it's a bit sweet, but there's so much going on with the flavor profile, I really didn't mind. Can't imagine drinking more than a single bottle, but regardless, this is an impressive beer."
""
""
"O- This beer had some very nice flavors of barrel and malt sugars but the odd flavors of pencils really got in the way of enjoying the rest of the beer."
""
""
"Overall, it's a decent brew but I wouldn't get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was just an incredible beer. Maybe it's just that I haven't had any other bourbon barrel aged scotch ales, but this really blew me away! Thanks a lot to coirm for the bottle!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Another well done brew by CW."
""
""
""
""

"O-enjoyed this a lot, right up there with Backwoods Bastard"
""
"Really nice, a touch more body would elevate this."

"(O)- An absolutely killer BA scotch ale. Easily might be the best in the style I have had thus far. . . maybe even better than Founders Backwoods Bastard, but to confirm I might have to do a side by side"
""
""
""
"one of my favorites of the style i've ever had a chance to try. a delicious sweet candy-like liquid bliss of a beer. do not let this one out of your sight, if you see it buy it."

"Judgement - Another recommended Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Aged behemoth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not always the biggest fan of bourbon barrel beers, but this one I enjoyed, with the flovors melding nicely together, balanced."
""
""
""
"This is pretty fantastic. While I'm NOT a big fan of their Scotch Ale, after the bourbon barrels, this is great. That sweet, toasted malt pairs WONDERFULLY against the vanilla from the barrels. I'd almost say the Scotch ale works better than a stout to highlight the bourbon barrels. If you like bourbon aged things or scotch ales, this is highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"This kicks ass. I can feel the bourbon leaching out of my pores, like after a good garlic pizza, I probably smell like it. The base beer is overshadowed, but it's so good, who cares? Excellent beer; for the equivalent of $6/bomber, how can you beat it?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The beer is perfectly aged, not overbearing with bourbon smell and taste, yet always lingering around. Perfect palate is a great finish to a very well done beer. I loved it."

"O - Central Waters' rich, malty scotch ale is the perfect candidate for barrel aging, and who else does barrel aging as well? Ready to drink fresh, the barrel-aging is balanced perfectly and brings relaxed, soothing additions to the beer, not flagrant booze, for another stellar addition to their ""Brewer's Reserve"" collection and an exceptional transition from fall to winter when the big barrel-aged stouts come out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink, with perfect carbonation. A very well made beer, which I would buy again gladly."
""
"Overall: A very good barrel aged Scotch ale. Bold barrel presence and some good toasty caramel malt flavor."
"It's a very solid barrel aged beer. The scotch ale contributes a nice sweet side with earthy tones. Very enjoyable."
""
"OThis is an elite offerings. One of the my favorite beers of all-time. These fuckers do the bourbon barrel aging right...."
""
""
""
"O) Highly enjoyable offering from Central Waters. Admittedly, I wasn't the biggest fan of their regular Scotch Ale, but doggone it, they aged it in some bourbon barrels, and it tastes fantastic."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very tasty beer with a few minor flaws."
""
""
"Has some great qualities, but fails where it matters most. Still a worthwhile drinking experience but it is no Backwoods Bastard."
""
"Overall this was a great scotch ale. I would love to put some of these away. I have had some great experiences aging some central waters bourbon barrel brews and I'm sure this will be no exception."
"Spot on Scotch Ale + nice barrel aging = a quality beer."
"O: Very nice aroma. The taste is almost very good but not quite there--the bitterness is not really complementary, and I think it could use some richness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty stuff. There are other, better, bourbon-barrel scotch ales around, but not many. I'd definitely drink it again, though only when I'm in the mood for such a thing."
"O: I am surprised by how sweet the beer manages to be while still remaining balanced. The first things I notice are all sugary: vanilla, coconut, caramel, toffee, candied nuts, etc. Even the bourbon is sweet. But then a light roasted flavor, oak tannin and relatively small, sharp carbonation come together to keep it from being cloying. Still sweet, but not quite a dessert beer. Great take on a scotch ale."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice barrel-aged scotch ale. More on the dark, roasty side than I'm used to for scotch ales, but a good beer nonetheless."
""

"Poured into Darkness glass. Appearance is a deep dark amber with minimal light passage. Some tan head upon pour with moderate retention. The nose starts with mellow bourbon notes, mainly vanilla. Some malt base is present at the back, a touch of smoke and peat paired with caramel. Taste starts out with smooth vanilla and a bit of oak. The oak seems to add some acidity to the flavor, not sure if this is intent all or what. Light bitterness present next with strong caramel and a metallic twinge on the finish. I can't help but perceive the beginnings of the infected flavors I experienced in Peruvian Morning. Perhaps this is just from some astringency from the oak, As it stands, this is a tasty brew, but I'm not sure how long this one will hold up."
"Overall - job well done. Nice balance to this complex beer"
""
""
""
""
"O- another great BB offering from CW this one is outstanding"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Smells great, although I think a 12oz bottle would be a pretty hefty serving; it took me awhile to work through my chalice. Still, it's pretty nice stuff and a definite return to form for Central Waters after some middling and 'off' beers."
""
"Central Waters has yet another fine BA offering here. I plan to age 2 of my bottles to see how it develops."
""
""
""
"Subtlety is strong in this one (oxymoron)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The bourbon is overpowering the base beer here. I'll sit on a few of these and see if that will fade over time"
""
""
""
"O) Great on tap, wish I remembered this one more, but I'll wait to buy in bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
"At the end of the day though, Central Waters knocks another one out of the park in their Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Series."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2. More time in the barrel to mellow out the boozey burn found in this beer, a perfect example lies in what central waters did this year with all the barrel aged offerings... 2013 vintages of the CW brewers reserve beers (Bourbon Barrel Stout, Peruvian Morning, Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, & Bourbon Barrel Cherry Stout) in the barrel for a full year instead of the 6 months (which is what they previously practiced). This made such a remarkable difference in the quality of CW's final product is was really impressive to speak honestly. 3.75"
""

""
"I don't drink bourbon but I don't mind bourbon (e.g. BCBS). If I wanted straight up bourbon, I would invest in a good bottle of bourbon. The bourbon is strong here but it is at the expense of the base beer, which I can barely taste. I can't help but think that Central Waters just threw Slainte into used bourbon barrels as a money grab. Slainte is a fine scotch ale on its own, but it does not get much of a chance to shine here. As a style comparison, this is nowhere close to being in the neighborhood of Backwoods Bastard or BA Big Sound. As a local comparison, I consider Shaggin in the Wood to be significantly better. I can't recommend this beer to most, but if you enjoy a strong bourbon flavour, this is probably your beer."

"O - Almost as good as BWB and great to have in the summer time when very few BA beers or Scotch Ales are available. I'm not aging this because I think it is perfect to drink right now."
"O- Another great brew from Central Waters barrel program. This is a very good BA scotch ale that with a little more body would be terrific. I will gladly pick up a case this year and seek it out again next year."
