4.67,17,4.25,4,5,5,4.75,"Poured into a sniffer aged about a year. Looks, smells and tastes like cola from the addition of kola nut. Never would have thought this to be a scotch ale more like an extra dark and malty brown ale. Nevertheless the scotch style malts added another level of complexity to the beer. Massive tastes of honey give this beer extra depth as well. A combination of malt, dark sugars and alcohol make this a heavy yet delicious beer. Hope to see it on the shelves again and would highly recommend it.","barfootbandit","Feb 01, 2015"

Poured at a perfect temperature with a modest light tan head, a little yeast and a very dark clear but almost opaque cherry color. Aroma is dark roast malt traditional Scotch ale. Flavor is a little muddled upfront but it really comes out in the finish as an excellent traditional Scotch ale; lots of dark malt and sugar flavors toffee little Cocoa, not quite smoke but in that direction. Body is great for this style soft warm round slightly boozy. Great drinkin' Scotch ale.","drpimento","Sep 30, 2014"

3.99,0,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with red highlights, virtually opaque in the glass. Thin tan head that dissipates to a ring around the glass, leaving thin lacing. Interesting aroma of brown bread, molasses, caramel, sweet nuts, hints of cola spicing and light cardboard similar to aged stouts. Flavor is a mellow blend of dark toasty malt, molasses, dates, figs, mixed nuts, cocoa and hints of coffee and cola. Really complex. Very nice creamy mouthfeel and medium to heavy body. A fun, complicated ale that has elements of both Scotch ale and porter, but with other interesting and complimentary flavors. There was so much going on here it seems almost all over the map, but still feels well melded and integrated. I'm impressed. The heavy malt and molasses flavors make it more of a sipping beer despite its moderate ABV. I liked this a lot and will snag another one when it rolls around.","LiquidAmber","Jan 04, 2014"

3.97,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Dark mahogany pour with a touch of ruby when held to the light. Two finger beige head with decent retention and lacing. The nose is spicy, malty, and really complex with hints of nutmeg, molasses, figs, toffee, smoke, honey, and just a touch of coffee and mocha. The honey really comes out in the taste as this comes to temperature. Extremely toasty and malty with hints of cocoa, dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, coffee, and just a bit of red berries and licorice. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk with a subtle creaminess and tangy bitter finish. Not at all what I had expected as I'm not a big fan of honey. A very unique and tasty interpretation of the style.","beerdrifter","Oct 23, 2012"
4.05,1.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This beer poured out as a deep brown color. Very rich looking. It's got a cream colored head on top that holds a very good retention. Not much lacing though. The smell of the beer is malty, with some smoked malt, and hints of chocolate. The taste is also loaded with a strong malt dominance, lots of caramel in there with subtle smoke and chocolate toast flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and heavy. It's dense and should be for the style. Overall it's a good brew, I don't pick up on the addition of Heather or Honey too much in it. However it remains a good beer and is worth trying. In my personal opinion it's far better than the original Dogma.","Knapp85","Sep 23, 2012"
