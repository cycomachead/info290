3.75,-5.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.75,"Flavor is very caramelly, slightly sweet, dark fruity, woody, and smoky, with a dry finish. Lacks depth of malt presence, and that might be due to the nitro. Seems hollow.","barczar","Apr 01, 2015"
4.12,4.3,4.25,3.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,"By far one of my favorite stouts, Old Chub Nitro is a refreshing and smooth ale. The aroma is soft and nutty, with a delicate yet rich initial blast. The feel is extremely smooth with a lower carbonation than many of my preferred beers, but it compliments the softness of the flavor. As for the overall taste, it's nutty and not too dry. Many describe it as caramelly and chocolatey, but I'd personally describe it as a soft oaky flavor. The nitrogen widget makes it taste just like it's off tap, which enhances the refreshing nature of the beer. Overall, a great beer to experience.","PrincessMeriwhite","Apr 01, 2015"

Once the thick head rises up, it's a dark Brown Beer with deep Ruby around the edges with a Tan coloured head. On the nose, lots of Caramel, some Woody tones and a little smoke. Great smelling for such a malt forward brew, you can really pick up on the caramalisation. When tasting this beer, there's an initial wave of Caramel, followed by hard Toffee and Fudge. Wood and a light Smokiness carry through the Palate. On the finish there's a little Tea aftertone, which is quite nice. As this beer is Nitro, it's insanely smooth and almost coats your throat. Light carbonation and a Sweet finish.","Sam-VW","Feb 18, 2015"

4.03,2,4.25,3.75,4,4.75,4,"It's a good thing I had my Guinness pint glass in hand, because the second I popped the top on the chilled can it exploded with gushing foam. Several ounces were laid to waste as they spilled over the sides before I could even attempt to pour it. Wow. What was left in the wake of the explosion was a pint glass full of stubborn off-white foam. It just lingered forever, with amazing retention. The foam served as a barrier to the deep, dark brown liquid beneath it. By the time the whole can was poured and ready to drink, the temperature had warmed significantly. Not that I minded, but it was a little annoying to sop up spilled beer and wait 15 minutes to take the first sip. The can says the nitro widget could cause unchilled cans to overflow. Well, this one came straight from the fridge so I don't know what went wrong here. However, once I tried the beer, everything was right! Although tamer than the standard version, it still produced a nice malty, sweet ale with negligible bitterness. There were hints of smoked peat and caramel, but much more subdued than its predecessor. Unsurprisingly, where it really shined was in the mouthfeel. Exceptionally smooth and creamy. The combination of subtler flavors and enhanced body made this extremely refreshing. Gulpable in fact. In the land of nitro-widget cans this is king. Compared to its non-nitro brother, this one is the smooth, mellow fellow. However, it packs more than enough punch (in both the ABV and flavor department) to be its own man. That said, it's more of a textural experience. If velvety smooth, creamy mouthfeel and subdued scotch ale flavors are your bag, you will fall all over yourself for this beer. If you want the strong scotch ale experience, then you might want to stick with Chub's older, bolder brother. This one could definitely get me in to trouble. I could crush can after can of these things.","JohnnyI","Jan 11, 2015"

In the meantime, I should definitely like to get my hands on more of this before it goes out of production again. Between this and the Ten FIDY Russian Imperial Stout (review coming in the future) Oskar Blues is definitely carving out a place as one of my favorite breweries.","m_hall","Nov 02, 2014"

Nose is nutty, with some lightly roasted chocolate and coffee. Tastes of creamy goodness. The nuttiness is still there, but now there is the presence of very sweet caramel malts and dark fruits. Very sweet, has a smoky taste as well. The creamy sweetness is definitely my favorite thing about this beer. Despite the higher ABV, the sweetness and creaminess makes this one rather easy to drink, although it does leave the mouth a bit dry. Honestly, I'm not super well versed in nitros or Wee Heavy, but this is an okay beer. Not the greatest for either style.","majorbase2","Oct 13, 2014"

The alcohol was very mild and as it warmed up it got more complex and tasty; the smoky notes tamed the general sweetness and the nitro made it flow down like a chocolate milk that was very enjoyable. High drinkability, this went down a lot easier than it should have for an 8% ABV brew and I really enjoyed this nitro version.","CHickman","Aug 26, 2014"

The initial taste of this beer is apple vinegar. As the taste lingers the molasses joins in. Tobacco is another flavor evident in the developing flavors. These flavors fade into a lingering aspirin bitterness. All of this is accompanied by a slippery, unset gelatin mouth feel. This is a cold night, cigar smoking beer.","Malt-i-Grain","Aug 06, 2014"

Doesn't have the flavor profile of a traditional scotch ale at all. No fruity notes, smoke or peat, zero booze. Nonetheless I really liked this. I have always had a soft spot for nitro cans and this one is amongst the best I've ever had. Fun to drink, more flavorful than anticipated, and just all-around pleasing to the senses.

The Old Chub is a great Scotch Ale, but the Nitro version seemed a bit more dulled down. Poured great. Great head retention. Dark Amber, almost Brown color. But all the caramel and maltiness and big flavor that kicks you in the throat with the Old Chub, is still present, but a lot more subdued in the Nitro; disappointing, if that's what you were looking forward to, but could be a good thing if you were looking for the ABV and flavor, but wanted a smoother drinking experience. Overall, just as with the Old Chub, your fondness for this beer will grow exponentially as you near the end.","Renzan0","Jul 23, 2014"

Possibly a slightly lighter and creamier mouthfeel and a few more hints of sweetness come through but this is a hard beer to improve upon as it is quite good in the original form/packaging. Alcohol is fairly well hidden.","dbrauneis","Jul 04, 2014"

Appearance is perfect. Smell is also excellent. The taste is also dead on, very smooth. Although I love the appearance of the nitro, I am not sure if it has any distinct advantage over the regular old chub which can be found at a great price.","JamieDuncan","Jul 02, 2014"

3.79,-4.1,4.5,3.5,3.75,4.25,3.75,"16oz. can served in a tulip nonic. Pour is beautiful and cascading - cola-colored in hue and opaque in clarity with a tight, creamy, one-inch, cafe-au-lait colored head. Head eventually settles into a consistent, quarter-inch cap. A few residual spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose very much subdued but there's a hint of something vinous mixed in with a trace of cocoa and an earthy/roasty malt profile. Taste consistent with nose with perhaps a suggestion of lactose and a trace of something metallic. Mouthfeel of this beer is wonderful; light-medium in body with a creamy/silky texture. Overall, the mouthfeel on this beer is outstanding, but I have to say that I prefer the standard over the nitro - the nose and flavors all come off a bit dull and underwhelming.","Jwale73","Apr 19, 2014"
