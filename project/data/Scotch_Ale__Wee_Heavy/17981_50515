Aroma of bourbon notes with light vanilla with a heavy malt base with quite a bit of residual sugars. Taste is also dominated by heavy caramel malt with quite bit of residual sugar with some medium bourbon notes with light vanilla notes. Body is full with medium carbonation and light warming alcohol notes. Drank very well for a four year old beer but ultimately this beer is a sipper and can’t be enjoyed in large quantities.","Phyl21ca","Jul 22, 2013"

I actually think it would benefit with some age, giving the bourbon a chance to mingle and settle in with the rest of the flavors and hopefully form a bond for the greater good. As it stands - still a great beer, just a bit hot at the moment.","tectactoe","Jul 17, 2013"

4.22,-3.7,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Burr, winter nights call for winter beers. Big Sound scotch ale fits the bill. Indeed this does look like coca cola as another reviewer pointed out. Nice looking tan head but it fades away real fast. Tawny brown with reddish highlights. Not the prettiest beer. Yup, toasty oak, vanilla, bourbon, bready and toffee. At first there is an off putting aroma but it fades. My first impression of flavor is a cross between vanilla and chocolateyness. Lovely toffee flavors and caramalized figgy goodness. Raisins, slight bit of cinnamon and more of that nice bourbon barrel goodness. Is this beer slightly thin? I feel like it might be. And there is a bit of an aftertaste that lingers with a bit of a tin like quality. This and the otherwise underwhelming apperance are the only real drawbacks of this otherwise very tasty, tasty cold weather sipper.","pmlondrigan","Jan 02, 2013"

Nice aroma, sweet with dark sugars, vanilla, bourbon-soaked wood. Though it's a different style, this conjured memories of Mother of All Storms and King Henry. The taste reflected the aroma, all the toffee, brown sugar and caramel goodness, vanilla, smooth bourbon, subtle oak, notes of raisin, fig, papaya, and a dash of cocoa. Great. Heavy-medium body, meh, might as well call it full-bodied, smooth and creamy, chewy with not too much of a boozy bite to it. A good sipper. So glad this was in bottles when I was down there.","Rifugium","Dec 24, 2012"

I never had this beer fresh, but if I had to wager a guess, I would say that this has held up alright. However, I can imagine it was better fresh, and it is a 8.5% beer, so if you're holding onto one of these, you might think about doing something with it while it's still decently enjoyable.

There is also a big whiskey character to the flavor, as well as some roasted malt and quite a bit of chocolate. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice.","Mora2000","Jul 27, 2012"
4.42,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Medium bodied with a strong barrel character that adds another layer of flavor to the base beer.  Some dry oak along with silky vanilla, toasted coconut and a delicious spicy bourbon character.  Although the barrel flavors are strong, they are perfectly integrated into the flavor without overpowering the base beer.   Lots of excellent bourbon flavor but barely any heat making it deceptively drinkable.  Underneath the barrel, there is a nice combination of sweet and roasted malt notes.  Slightly smokey with hints of dark chocolate, toffee, caramel and oatmeal lingering into a somewhat dry finish.  Highly recommended!","corby112","Jul 04, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really put back by the aroma on this one as it was really well balanced and intense. I wish this would have carried over to the flavor, but the flavor was still quite good though.
