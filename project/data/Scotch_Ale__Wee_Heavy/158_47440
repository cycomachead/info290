A good amount of nuttiness. A bit of caramel. Taste is wonderfully sweet caramel malts, and a touch of bitterness. Roasted nuts, coffee, and cocoa. Alcohol is very well masked, although it does come through a bit more as it warms. This one is medium bodied, a bit thick, but still very smooth. Goes down with relative ease. As a relative newcomer to Wee Heavies, this is my favorite that I've had so far.","majorbase2","Oct 26, 2014"

Weak nose of mostly caramel coupled with hints of roast, dark fruit and coffee/toffee.  Almost full bodied with a nice almost creamy texture.  Slightly below normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is quite nice and well balanced, but lacks the intensity and complexity of the world class Wee Heavies such as Traquair and Thirsty Dog's Wulver.  It begins as the nose, mostly caramel with hints of dark fruit, roast and coffee/toffee.  As the sweetness fades in the middle, hops and associated mild bitterness are noted.  The finish leaves you with a touch of smoke and a very light alcohol burn.","tillmac62","Sep 24, 2014"

I've never encountered a beer that I thought was ""too malt-forward"". Needs a nose. Why can't I smell this ale?!? Flavour really needs a bit more complexity. Just seems like something with so much crystals should also have a bit more specials. A little more peat (was it?) and a dram of smoke would've been nice.

Malt-heavy and whispering with booze. Hops are overcast by the prominent grain flavors, however, they're not thickened with sweetness or bolstered by much meatiness. Disappointing is the lack of a good, sturdy carbonation. Body is flaccid and wet without it.

That being said, it's a pretty interesting take on the style, and really pretty tasty.

But it's the aroma where this thing gets interesting. Peat, roasted nuts, a slight hint of smoke, caramel and an unmistakeable sense of wood. The intricate layers of flavor continue onto the palate. Deeply roasted, but not black, caramel malt leads the away, along with the earthy tones of peat and mahogany. Sweetness develops and becomes more prominent as it warms. The beer is solid to the end where it signs off with a slight earthy bitterness. Just enough to balance it out, but not enough to betray the style. Nice brew.","BeardedBoffin","Jan 03, 2013"

The taste brings through a robust, slightly prickly maltiness, with a bit of smokiness on the finish. It's pretty relaxed for a scotch ale, but it's tasty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. This beer hides the ABV very well. Overall, it's a tasty scotch ale. I like the style with more aggression personally, but this is still a well-composed beer.","shand","Dec 08, 2012"

Good mouthfeel, slick but not too heavy--perhaps even on the light side for the style.

It’s not what I expected, I thought at first, as it lacked any sort of malty sweetness or an expected toasted caramel which I look forward to in my scotch ales. Flavor was more of the same—bad, off, and just wrong. As it warmed it developed what I can only describe as a “vomitty” flavor. Its hard to tell if its just old beer or a quality control issue.

Must say that the beer is totally tasty and drinkable, but wanted a whole lot more complexity out of something like this. No alcohol burn, no roast, no toast, no smoke, just a big malty beer, a bit of hoppiness for balance but only noticible as keeping the malt from becoming cloying. It doesn't taste bad, it just isn't as flavorful as it might be. Good through the mouth, can kick it back easier than you might want to. All in all, a slightly above average beer. Nothing is bad or wrong about it so much as it just fails to stand out, especially for a style with some room to play with.","kc44","Mar 20, 2012"

Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with some roasty notes and caramel aromas. Taste is of roasty/toasty malt up front with a mild burnt caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good Scotch ale with a tasty malt presence in both smell and taste.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 28, 2012"

It smells very rich and complex in the malt department, as well as reminiscence of breakfast cereal. The taste mirrors the smell and there's kind of a chalky cocoa texture which personally I loved. Average length finish but with chocolate malt satisfaction. Both I and the lady of the house thoroughly enjoyed it.","MoreThanWine","Feb 27, 2012"

Smells of alcohol, malt and a smokiness with a bit of peat as well as dull sweet bread. Full malt flavor in the front with the aforementioned peat like smokiness and mellows rather quickly without any real mix of sweet bread or dark fruit. I found this overall to be a bit underwhelming for the style, not very complex, rather average though I'm willing to give it a second try in the future.","Blueribbon666","Feb 17, 2012"

A small off-white head that dissipated within a minute or two. Aroma of sweet malts, roasty, dark fruits and caramel; not too pronounced. Taste of rich caramel malts, roasted grains and nuts, brown sugar, hints of earth and figs. Very smooth and highly drinkable, and I don't just say that because it was my third drink of the night.

No matter, the aroma is wonderful. You cannot miss the roasted malt and wisps of smoke that linger above the glass. The Scotch Ale is very smooth on the palate with an even malt flavor throughout, and the long pleasing aftertaste make for a great sipping experience. Nothing bitter, acidic or unpleasant here. Highly recommended if you are in the mood for an easy going dark ale. Great Divide has a number of off the beaten path offerings that are really good, and the Claymore Scotch Ale is another.","iSip","Beers"

Taste of big caramel, chocolate, molasses, and roasted flavor in the front; that leads to smokiness, a bit of dark fruits, and a bit of booziness in the back. A small amount of bitterness is noticed in the back on the finish as well. Notes of caramel, molasses, and roasted flavors linger for a short period after the finish. Surprisingly smooth and creamy body that drinks easily for the alcohol level. Medium carbonation and medium-full body. Fairly strong alcohol warming after the finish, with very little noticed in the taste. Overall a great Wee Heavy ale, probably the best one I have had yet.","superspak","Jun 19, 2011"

Or a wet wool coat that hasn't been cleaned in three seasons and could really, really use a good cleaning RIGHT NOW. In any case, this is one Scotch ale to avoid.

This after all has a unique flavor, one that I may enjoy at other times. Its just that I always scrutinize my first beer of the night and challenge it to make me enjoy it.

3.68,-4.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Served in a Tulip Glass. Claymore pours a near black color with slight brown hues when held up to the light. As it is poured into the glass it generates a nice amount of creamy light brown head that dissipates rather quickly. The brew leaves a scattered amount of lacing around the glass which I have found to be typical of the style. Claymore Scotch Ale has an overall scent of deep malts (possibly coffee malts) and dark roasted nutty scents. The taste of this brew is not exactly what Ive come to expect of the style but, that being said, it is not in anyway unpleasant. The initial taste is that of deep malts with a slight molasses note backed by roasted nut hues. As the brew finishes, more of the woody flavors and a very slight scotch note work their way onto the pallet. There is very little alcohol burn which really helps it drink easily. The brew is very smooth on the pallet and has a nice complexity of flavors. Overall, I would have liked to have seen more scotch notes in the scent and even more of the same in the taste but I did find the brew to be quite pleasant.","BigPlay1824","Jan 15, 2011"

Then I definitely get the biscuit flavor with a bit of roasted/bitter chocolate and dark fruits. A bit of alcohol at the end. I haven't had too many wee-heavy's but one that sticks out in my mind would be Founders Dirty Bastard...and that was SOOO much better...Other than that and Belhaven, I can't think of much to compare it to.

This beer could certainly benefit from a little more flavor balance. From the smell and appearance, I expected the body to be thicker, but I was surprised to find it medium, smooth, and mildly carbonated.

The flavor is a tangy maple syrup and juniper malt. Alcohol is pretty intrusive here and not entirely to my liking as it seems like the astringent qualities are knocking out the malt sweetness. It's grassy and medicinal to me, chemical hilights. Medium bodied and very lazily carbonated, it has a somewhat silky but limp feel. Soapy sweet, just not my cup of tea and a disappointment from Great Divide, especially for a normally exotic style like this. Vaguely drinkable.","Durge","May 31, 2010"

The aroma has a lot of smokiness initially, along with salty bacon, burnt bread, toffee and molasses, some dark fruits (fig and date), and some alcohol. The flavor similarly has an intense smoky character upfront with notes of bacon and peat, along with some blackstrap molasses, burnt bread, plum and fig, treacle, tobacco and alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the thicker side, and drinkability is pretty good for the style.

Scattered speckled lacing left behind on the sides of my chalice. Aromatics come with sweet caramel and plum and raisin notes, earthy and herbal hops with a touch of peated smoked malt. Even a bit of dark powdered cocoa edges come off with some toasted nuttiness, maybe it's the yeast and malt playing together. Flavors build upon each other nicely, deep with malt character plums, dark fruits with caramel and a bit of booze. Mild smoked malt and with dark chocolate, herbal earthy hops in the finish just enough to balance it out. Booze is there but doesn't overburden the experience. Mouthfeel is easy going medium bodied sturdy but not overdone in carbonation, not off flavors left behind. Drinkability is decent a good beer to go with some rustic wild game, a nice bison steak and this beer could befriend one another.

There is a bit of lacing, but it is in clumps, not uniform around the glass. I can smell sweet malts and alcohol that is reminiscent of a mild bourbon. There is some hop in the taste, but ot is not bitter. There is also some mellow caramel sweetness that is quite tasty. You can also taste some alcohol at the end, which provides some warmth. Very nice, like a good port or bourbon. This is a rich, creamy beer. It has a full-bodied mouthfeel and provides some warmth as it goes down. I'm drinking it a bit above cellar temperature, and it is near perfect. I don't think I could drink it all night because it is so strong and rich, but I could certainly drink a few of these beers.

It's a big beer, and it's rich, but it's also very focused which keeps it drinkable. Great Divide is kind of known for that in all of their beers, but it's particularly welcome here.

3.94,2.6,3,4,4,4,4,"D= This one grew on me as I progressed through the glass. Its appearance is way too dark (almost to an off-putting level) but the aroma and flavor make up for that. I would drink this again for sure.","spointon","Mar 21, 2009"
3.77,-1.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"M - Creamy, lots of carbonation.","HeyItsChili","Mar 21, 2009"
3.97,3.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a really dark brown with garnet highlights when held to light, smallish creamy tan head dissipates quickly to a cap. Smells of molasses and burnt sugars, caramel, smoke. Very malty, very nice aroma. Taste is molasses burnt sugars and toffee up front with a touch of alcohol mid way followed by some raisins and a bit of spice in the finish. Sweet sticky mouthfeel, syrupy full body, medium carbonation. Nice Wee heavy, a little dark, a bit sweet, but very nice nonetheless.","johnnnniee","Mar 20, 2009"
3.9,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"What a rich, creamy brew this was. Pours a blackish color, not deep amber, like a true wee heavy. Full bodied with a smokey taste. However, looked and smelled and tasted more like a smoked porter than a ""wee heavy"".. Wasn't ""peaty"" enough in my mind, to be a wee heavy. Very tasty, somewhat sweet, but elegant!! Roasty malts with a touch of hops and a smoked porter flavor. This is one hell of an interesting beer.","bigdeuce","Mar 20, 2009"
4.16,8.3,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability - I love the way this one blends together, and Great Divide just has a way of making their beers ultimately drinkable. Only negative points here are the noticeable alcohol on the tongue and the nose. Overall, this is another great one from Great Divide.","sevopie","Mar 19, 2009"
3.68,-4.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, a relatively good beer. Not my favorite interpretation of the style.","jdubjacket","Mar 18, 2009"
3.43,-10.7,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D: A bit atypical for the style, yet tasty. Worth a try, but not one that I'd actively seek out again.","klewis","Beers"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall impression: This one is surprisingly drinkable given the ABV, another good offering from Great Divide.","rowew","0"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"D: My favorite of the three beers I had at the Tap Room. It's a nice departure from Great Divide's heavier offerings.","Rayek","Mar 16, 2009"
3.64,-5.2,4,2.5,4,4,4,"The smell was just not good on this one, but it redeemed itself by tasting good. I won't rush out for more, but it's one of the only Scotch ales around here.","roadhouse","Mar 16, 2009"
4.08,6.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"d- There isn't an ABV on this bottle, but reading other reviews I would say its 7.5-8%abv. You really dont notice until after its going down. It warms you from the inside and with each drink you want more. I can imagine drinking more, but I am afraid that after 2-3 I would be gone.","nhudson","Mar 15, 2009"
4.15,8.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Picked up a single from Abe's for $2 at Abe's. This is a bit different for the usual, heavy sweet caramel and smoke wee heavy I get. This is a dry, extremely bready, like dark multigrain loaf crust. There are notes of cocoa and toast with an underlying caramel malt profile. Despite the 7.7%, this beer was fairly drinkable and I'd go back it. Check this beer out if you're looking for something a little different with the style.","tempest","Mar 14, 2009"
3.67,-4.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability? The label on the (bottled on Feb 17 2009) bottle says it's 7.7%abv and I think they've done one heck of a job of hiding it but...I would not turn around and open another bottle. This style seems to be a real hit or miss with me and the Claymore falls somewhere in between. I say, try it and judge for yourself.","Bitterbill","Mar 14, 2009"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a beautiful clear root beer color with a small quickly dissipating head and not much carbonation. Smells of sweet roasted malts, caramel, and just a tad of dark fruits. First sip is creamy, clean and refreshing with the sweet roasted malts and caramel giving way to a welcomed rather bitter finish. Great malty goodness here with almost no hop presence. Medium bodied and very drinkable.","ATLbeerDog","Mar 14, 2009"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer as it's not one of my favorite styles, though with Great Divide on the label I should have been expecting it. Definitely worth a shot.","glid02","Mar 12, 2009"
4.1,6.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Formed a 1"" dense tan head over the clear ruby brown brew. Head falls gradually, with ample lasting lace. Aroma is malty, with wisps of peat smoke. Taste starts with sweet roasty grain, goes a touch leathery in the middle, and closes malty as well, with a touch of warmth. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is great. I'm liking this one.","ppoitras","Mar 11, 2009"
4.08,6.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"I'm impressed. really impressed. One of the better scotch ales I've had in a good while, and definitely an interesting interpretation. Nice to see an American brewery take on a style with so much power and make something so ultimately drinkable. Definitely wish I had a few more on me at the moment... a problem I will have to rectify in the morning. Hands down, a must try - no question.","djeucalyptus","Mar 10, 2009"

4.37,13.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Sweet smell. Candied caramel and apple. Malt slight roasted. Followed through in the taste as well. Sweet, but not overly. Good balance. A nice crisp finish, but not dry. I haven't had many wee's but this one is darn good, even though it's not my style.","Mebuzzard","Mar 04, 2009"
4.45,15.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D - Extremely impressive... Looks good, smells good, tastes good, feels good, and an enjoyable experience...
