Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep orange copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, raisin, pear, brown bread, peat smoke, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/smokey earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, peat smoke, and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, raisin, pear, light chocolate, peat smoke, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/smokey earthiness. Slight earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, brown bread, herbal, peat smoke, light nuttiness, and yeast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, peat smoke, and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice scotch ale. Good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and moderate peat smoke flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 10, 2014"

3.82,6.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Breaking up the winter warmers, I tried this one. I've tried a few scotches in the past year and this one gives a nice simulation of the flavors of a mildly peated scotch. I find its profile to be close to JW Black Label--some peat but not overpowering. An interesting beer.","Mdog","Oct 10, 2011"
3.57,-0.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending me this one! Shared with caSSino and the NoDa Brewing crew! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, peat, caramel hop, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, peat, wood, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing on this one really stood out to me if I am honest. The peat character was definitely there, but it was not very pronounced as one might expect based on the name of the brew. It did go down pretty smooth however, which was nice to say. Worth trying if you see, but not worth seeking out.","thagr81us","Sep 21, 2011"
3.86,7.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O- A very good Scottish Ale, but it just needs a bit more intensity. Not that every beer has to be a flavor attack, but this is just a bit lighter in all regards than most of the style. Still, a solid beer.","jsprain1","Sep 09, 2011"
3.4,-5.3,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Overall, I'm just not terribly impressed. Not offensive by any means, but nothing special either.","Phocion","Sep 08, 2011"
3.88,8.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O - I enjoyed this one. Not as heavy and a little hoppier than most scotch ales, I still liked this for what it was.","warnerry","Aug 20, 2011"
3.65,1.7,3,3,4,3.5,4,"D/O: While this beer stops short of being a wee heavy, it does provide some satisfying malt-focused qualities that are, arguably, Scottish. It exceeds the typical Belgian dark ale because it doesn't rely too heavily on dark fruit, conveying more pure grain in flavor and smell, while also suggesting some heady spirituousness that exceeds the empirical reality.","beagle75","Aug 18, 2011"
3.8,5.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Bancreagie Peated Scotch Ale is a dark brown colored brew, with a small tan head. The scent is a heavy dose of carmalized malts, a hint of peaty smoke.. Taste-wise, it starts off with a nice dose of caramel malt, toffee, some hazelnuts, fairly earthy, a bit of smokey flavor, which is well-blended. There is a bit of diacetyl, maybe a touch of spice from the alcohol as it warms a bit. Hop profile is floral and blended well. The mouth is medium bodied and pretty wet.","Tballz420","Aug 16, 2011"
3.83,6.7,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"And apparently Bancreagie is Scottish for “White-rock”. Not quite Claymore or Skull Splitter, and while I can’t say this scotch offering is quite as good as either of those, it is still worth a try if you can find it.","Pintofbrown","Aug 10, 2011"
4.14,15.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is a light amber shade in appearance. a wonderful smell of cherrywood smoke. Pretty easy drinking, with a nice smokey note that isn't typical for scotch ales. I love a good smoked beer that can be sessionable, so this was a winner. That said, it's a bit watery in the mouthfeel.","DaCheesehead","Aug 01, 2011"
3.42,-4.7,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,3,"Medium to light bodied with low carbonation. The mouthfeel on this beer could use quite a bit of work. Not bad overall, but I am not sure I would seek it out again.","hardy008","Jul 29, 2011"
3.45,-3.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"According to the label, Bancreagie is the named after the granite that creates the aquifer from which the water for the beer comes from in Lucan. The rest of the label basically says they are trying to make an authentic Scottish ale. Off white head bubbles up high when I tip the glass a bit too hard for the last bit of beer, which settles into a light lace. Amber to copper all in the glass with highlights around the edge. Definite smoky peat in the nose over top of lots of malt, some hop and a mineral smell. Light and airy in the mouth, peat isn't as strong as the nose would suggest. Strong caramel and burnt biscuit. Not a lot off the back--somewhat disappears. Not a bad beer, but I'm not a huge fan at this point. Happy to drink this one but unlikely to get a six pack.","FightingEntropy","Jul 11, 2011"

3.97,10.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"M - Thin to medium body with a syrupy sensation. Good, not-too-strong carbonation. Juicy sweet finish.","rundocrun","Jun 28, 2011"

4.05,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The reason I enjoy this one is that it is a summer style beer with some character and complexity. Wont fill you up and isn't boring. Perfect for sitting by the fire.","Expedition","Jun 05, 2011"
4.2,17,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, I really enjoyed the hell out of this beer. I would love to have this one again someday. Really a nice beer to add whiskey barrel aging too. Well done Bros.!","jera1350","May 10, 2011"
3.62,0.8,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"A Scottish Ale that has some uniqueness. More carbonation would definately improve this beer.","morimech","Apr 28, 2011"
3.37,-6.1,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel- the carbonation is barely there and what is there is large rough bubbles. But the body is great. This beer shows some great progress for this company. Moo Joos and sheepshead are good stuff. This beer, I think, could use a revision, especially when it comes to carbonation. I like the fruitiness but some darker tones or less crystal malts could go a long way.","Miketwolf21","Apr 17, 2011"
3.24,-9.7,4.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability is okay, but not something I'd revisit a lot, too abrasive.","ccrida","Apr 14, 2011"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Very drinkable. The extra peat smoke adds a dimension to this Scotch Ale that takes it a notch above others. Love that sweet and smoky malt flavor in this one. Will definitely buy this one again and store it for Fall/Winter. But I'll enjoy what I have now for Spring.","ChopperSmith","Apr 10, 2011"
4.25,18.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"O - This is a top notch ale. I have had a few very decent brews from Brau Bros and will certainly try more.","lwillitz","Apr 01, 2011"
4.35,21.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy ruby brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and a hint of earthy peat. The taste is considerably more peaty than the aroma with some nice smokiness too. There is still a solid caramel backbone, but the peat really stands out. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very fine beer. It reminds me a lot of Samuel Adams Scotch Ale, but fuller in flavor. I can see this becoming a stable for me when I'm in the mood for something malty.","KarlHungus","Beers"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I'm not a big Scotch Ale fan. Usually the burnt aftertaste gets old for me fast. However, this one really did it for me. The carbonation kept it lively, and the sweet taste did not linger too long. The alcohol level seemed right for this beer. I'm going to have to seek out more Brau Brothers offerings.","Jazz1","0"
