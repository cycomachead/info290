There is nothing bad about this brew so far. Now for the taste it is bold with caramel taste and some grains at the end. This brew has a nice balance to it. There is a lot going on in this brew. the taste is great and the color is nice.  I have to say that Magic Hat Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. the mouth feel is nice for being 6.9% ABV. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. I would buy this brew again. This brew was great choice.","nicholas2121","Sep 11, 2014"

Not really know what a Scotch Ale was I proceeded to did out. The beer was rather nice shade of red with a really nice head that lasted for a little bit. The smell was a little roasted and sweet, I found it to be fairly inviting. The taste was sweet at first which faded into a nice bitter aftertaste.

An aggressive pour produced a big, billowing head that arched over the top of the glass and held for a bit. The cream colored head died down to a minimal covering after a few minutes. Clear red color with a swirling of sediment from the bottom of the bottle mixed through. Smell is malt dominated with notes of caramel, dark toast, dried fruits, and a hint of smoke. Smoked almond flavor to start off, followed by prune, cherry, dark toasted bread and sweet caramel. The finish includes smoke and toasted malt. A high level of carbonation mingles with a medium-full body. The flavors of this beer, while good, would prove to be a bit overbearing after a while for me, along with the nearly 7%.","kkosmoski","Jan 23, 2009"

A malty scent at the front, with a touch nof smokiness with woody green fragrance at the end. The malt is straight out strong in the taste, sweet, but not over bearing. Then the smoke comes foward and gives you what you expect from a scotch ale. Then a grassy green flavor comes in right the end, is a bit of a put off from the smokiness. A medium bodied feel with a chewy finish, with a slight dryness at the end.

The taste parallels the smell well, but adds an additional hop and spice profile. I can't quite put my figure on it, but there is this flavor that lingers in the background, and the best I can do to describe it is calling it this ""smokey"" earthy taste.

I really don't think that Magic Hat was brewing a style here, I think that they were going more for a seasonal fall ale, which is prolly the best descriptor for this beer that there is.

What you will get is a hazy brown beer with some head that doesn't hang around too long. The smell is molasses, coffee, chocolate, toasted malts. The taste is quite subdued and you don't get near enough of that smoky peat flavor characteristic of the style. This is a light to medium bodied beer, that needs to be chewier.

Great taste! It has a nice dark, earthy feel to this aspect, as well, including a wonderful, strong taste of peat.

All with a heavy dose of earthy, amber-malt, and mild peat-ey quality. You'd think that the textue would be heavy, but instead lands on medium firmness and much less sweet / cloying than anticipated.

It's very easy to drink while being very flavorful. Alcohol dryness shows more as beer warms.

She produced a sheet like lace that slowly broke apart as it slid down the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were soft in smell, detections of some fruit, and sweet malts came to nose. I did notice small waves of smoke but these were few and far between. Not an overly impressive aroma - soft. The tastes that came from the glass were not ""in your face - especially compared to other smoke beers"". Tastes of soft fruits (apples, apricots) were noticable, sweet malts, a tad lemony hop arose a few times and again a low lying smoke seemed to be present, ut severly understated, the swollow ended with more apples and malts. Not really an aftertaste, again I noticed some smoke that seemed to be there, but not as I would have liked. She started off realitively chewy and thick in the first sip, but seemed to thin alittle as I drank. A simple beer good to drink, but not sure if it should be classified as a ""smoke"" considering there was little smoke involved.

This one is no exception, even though I've never reviewed a beer of this style before. It's decent, suitable for fall or winter enjoyment, has just enough of an aroma, as not to overpower the senses. I still feel that somethings missing here, and think that this could benefit from a more peat or charcoal base, and some spicy notes. Certainly, worth a try to sample this style out...","JerzDevl2000","Feb 05, 2007"

The nose is light sweet caramel, much simpler than expected. The mouth is slightly sticky and fairly well carbonated. There's lots of sweet caramel malt taste, but not much else. No spice, no bitterness, and definitely no smoke. It's smooth and enjoyable, but very siple. Just a touch of dryness in the aftertaste hints at the presence of hops.

It poured a dark brown coloration, with little heading at all. Smell had some sweet sugars, tree bark, caramel...all somewhat weak but nice overall. Taste was to be honest a bit on the sour side. I could taste some of the smokyness to this beer, but it didn't really add to it very much. Mouthfeel was also quite a bit lighter then I remember it being in recent years. One or two of these was more then enough for me. It's sort of unfortunate considering I really used to enjoy this beer. Maybe I got an old bottle or something. I'll probably give it another chance next year. Cheers","jamie2dope","Dec 22, 2006"

Roasted flavors and earthy tones come next but the sweetness holds up. Some of that vanilla from the aroma makes way. Darker fruits toward the back and some floral hoppy characteristics. The end is herbal and piney with a touch of roasted malt. Creamy mouthfeel makes all the flavors work in harmony.

The nose is a bit difficult to catch, though when you do there are subtle notes, of sweet malt, chocolate, earth, and smoky moss. On first sip it tastes great. Big chocolate notes along with sweet malt and an almost ""scotchy"" taste. Unfortunately it finishes a bit weak ... almost watery. This was a bit odd to me as my first experience with this beer was a great one. Initially I had had it served on tap and the draft version seemed much meatier than the bottled version did. I remember the mouthfeel from the draft to be much fuller with an almost creamy finish to it. The bottle had the same taste up front, but as I said it just seemed watery at its finish. When this beer is served correctly it's heavenly ... I must say though that even when I pour it incorrectly/have a mediocre bottled batch this stuff is still pretty darn tasty.","Jaynuze","Sep 06, 2006"

Tastes are smoke first and foremost, but it's slight smoke (not like a German rauchbier). That is followed up by sour fruits and a touch of diacetyl, then a vinyl-like finish. Mouthfeel is overly dextrine-smooth, with only minimal carbonation. Very good drinkability, with minimal and accessible smoke. This is really more of a scotch ale than a smoke beer.

It's not quite sweet, with nice toasty flavor shining through, complementing the slight smokiness. Although slight, the smoke flavor appears nicely in the after taste. I drank this beer quite a bit when it was near out of date last year, and while the aged beers are still good, its even better fresh.

It has earthy and smoky malts, mild hops/hop bitterness and some sweetness toward the end with a body that is medium and smooth.

The taste is very smoky with earthy toasted malts and some peat. It has a medium body, dry texture and moderate carbonation. Im not a very big fan of smoke beers, but this one was done very well.

Palate is quite interesting - rather fruity, with notes of apricots and light hops, blended with a bit of peaty smoked malt. The alcohol is rather prevalent on the finish. Body is a bit lighter than I would hope for to hold up the assertive flavor.

The smell is very malty supporting a touch of sweetness. There is a note of smoke in the background, but I wish it was stronger. The taste is very malty, as are most fall seasonals. There is a sweetness in the background that dances around just a hint of smokiness. I think maybe if the sweetness died down a bit, the smoke would be more apparent. At the end, the dreaded diacetyl makes a presence. It isn't really off-putting, but I wonder if this is the sweetness I tasted in the beginning. After the swallow, it leaves a sticky residue in my mouth. I remember liking this beer much more than I do now. It's still a nice beer, but it's lacking some sort of individuality. A stronger smokiness would go a long way towards making it a great beer.","Hagbard","Oct 12, 2005"

Earthy and woody, with some tea-like tannins that balance out the malt. Rather unique brew; pretty drinkable. I'm a little surprised the ABV is 6.9%, it's well hidden.

The taste offered delicous smokey/roasty oaky-woody malts that pleased the tastebuds right through to the lightly astringent, zippy citric finish that left residual citrus-smoked roasty malty flavors.

Following a chimney like smokey flavor is quite present and adds a nice flavor to the brew, followed by an almost nutty characteristic which added to an even more complex flavor profile. There is also a bit of sweetness and creaminess to the brew which adds quite a nice mouthfeel. Finally the brew finishes just slightly hoppy, but not bitter.

Anyway... The pour was a medium dark copper color. This is what I think is so funny, my notes say: clean aroma! Uhh, I tasted a malty base (no smoke detected, alas), with a flowery hop aroma. Some slight astringency in the finish. I remember I was out with a few fellow BAs, and we were all like: what is it. I can't believe this was a smoked beer. I found this an average beer, not bad, not outstanding. pat","PatandDavid","Nov 08, 2003"
3.98,7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The Jinx was on cask last night at Eli Cannon's for the Magic Hat tasting, a nice variation. Poured into the pint glass, it appears at first to be nitrogenated because it has a beatiful cascade effect and a nice thick and creamy off white head. Color is a smoky quartz and garnet, good clarity. Aroma is a little malty and sweet, a little buttery, with just a little bit of chutney. Medium to light bodied and incredibly smooth on cask. Taste is a mix of lightly smoked malt and a raisiny sweetness, with a little hop tang coming in the end to blend with finishing notes of alcohol. The pronounced yeast flavor of some MH beers is not evidenced in this cask beauty. Pour me another...","mikeys01","Nov 07, 2003"
3.7,-0.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a deep amber brown hue topped by a nice sized cream colored head lacing is present in thin sporadically patterned rings. Smells of deep roasted malts with a nut characteristic and smokey peated malts nice and robust even a presence of hops here slightly piney nose. Flavor mildly smoked deep woody, malts a slightly chocolate flavored with an herbal quality about it tasty and quite different. Medium bodied smooth light carbonation here, simple. Drinkability is quite effortless I could drink a few before the smoked effect would ware down my palate.","WVbeergeek","Nov 06, 2003"
4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice deep burgandy color. Slight off white head. Lacing is sporadic, but nice. Aroma has a nice faint sweetness to it. Seems like bubblegum esters and hard candy. The taste follows suit with more of the same sweet character. But unlike the nose, there is a dose of smoke flavor added to the flavor. Ever so delicate, it makes it's presence knows and integrates into the flavor profile nicely. There's a bit of a dryness on the finish that has me going back for more. Nice beer here.","Bighuge","Nov 05, 2003"
4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Again, I have had teh pleasure of enjoying a new MH brew. Pours a deep smoky chocolate color with a thin lace on the glass. An mellow aroma wafts a moderate peet smokiness with a caramel background. A smooth body supports a mellow caramel and chocolate malt with a building, eclipsing smoke that brows right through the finish. All the flavors meld well to present a great, not overly smoky concoction.","beernut7","Nov 01, 2003"

3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out with a deep amber/brown color and was topped off with a thin white head. This is weak for a smoked beer, but holds its own. In the nose theres roasted chestnuts, fermented fruit and alcohol. The flavor holds some orange liqueur and sweet caramel. Finishes clean and dry and is light to medium bodied. A flavorful ale but not in the same category as some other German Rauchbiers that I have tried. Not bad.","pezoids","Oct 28, 2003"

3.28,-11.8,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a deep reddish-brown, small tan head that quickly becomes just a ring, leaves small amounts of lacing. Aroma is butter cookies & earth. Flavor is a little sweet, little buttery, a little chocolate, and a but of hops in the finish. Medium-thin bodied, very toungue-tingling carbonation. If there was smoke there, it was VERY much in the background.","goz","Oct 18, 2003"

4.3,15.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"According to the brewery's website, this beer uses a peat-smoked whisky malt. The smoke was so delicate that I really didn't perceive it as such, rather, it registered as a malty, slightly chocolately essence woven among the malt. This beer is sort of a classification buster - at first it struck me as a Vienna, then the malt kicked in, sort of Oktoberfest. The malt softened and seemed more Scottish and finally, when the beer was fairly warm, it had hints of English brown ale. A beer chameleon. Also according to the website, abv of 7%, which I never would have believed. A very mellow beer, on purpose, and quite well made.","Brent","Oct 08, 2003"
4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep dark red in color with an off white to light tan head, nice lacing. I'm quaffing cherries, pepper, and leafy hops. Taste is of bitter cherries and an earthy fall leaves complexity in the hops. Unrecognizable spices are also in here, pepper etc. and there is cherry candy sweetness present as well. I'm not detecting much smoke here though at all [?] I'll have to try another... My favorite Magic Hat offering thus far, and a good beer to celebrate the beginning of Fall!","chaduvel","Sep 23, 2003"
3.8,2.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a brown color with a tan head that had medium retention. The aroma was kind of woodsy, oak maybe, also with dark fruits and a bit of hop bitterness. The taste had no indication of the high ABV. It was slightly smokey, not much though, along with a balanced hop crispness that gave a relatively dry finish. The mouthfeel was nice and smooth with medium carbonation. This is a great beer to get settled into the Fall season with.","nixhecks","Sep 16, 2003"

4.23,13.7,4.5,4,4,4,5,"Poured with a superfine off white collar...akin to whipped cream almost! The head settled over clear red/amber & brown hightlighted liquid. The interesting nose gave hints of caramel, roasted maltiness and very slight but noticeable smokiness. The taste started sweet and smooth with a complex blend of delicate smoke, malt and background hop bitterness with lingering peppery spiciness and small amounts of phenols. Finishes long, silky-smooth and superbly balanced with no hint of the 7 percent alcohol noticed. A very distinctive ale, recommended if found.","beerluvr","Sep 13, 2003"
4.8,29,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"On tap at the brewery. 1st bottling run of the '03 Jinx. It's been way too long since the '02 Jinx was around. Pours a dark brown with a small creamy head. Big malt flavor with a spicy smoked touch. Very well balanced and complex. Very smooth. This is my favorite of Magic Hat's regular seasonal brews. I wish it were available all the time. I can't wait until the bottles start showing up in the stores in a few weeks!","scottum","Aug 19, 2003"

Nor does Magic Hat describe it as belonging to a particular genera. It has a dark caramel color and a small white head. Smells a bit sweet, the taste is smoky like a stout but gives way to dryness similar to a an English bitter. Kinda strange also good. Uniqueness is always cool.","Bcant","Feb 13, 2003"
4.85,30.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Another excellent ale from Magic Hat. Slightly smokey due to the peat smoked malt. There's also some wheat malt and chocolate in the recipe which all make for a unique flavor. It's not out for long, so buy it when you can. My wife figured out the logo. I thought it was a funky falling leaf, but she informed me that if you look close, it's actually three overlapping hearts around the smiling face.","far333","Jan 10, 2003"
4.35,16.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy-amber in color with a tan head that leaves some wipsy lacing. Floral hop aroma with some herbal hints and sweetness and hints of smoke in the backround. Medium to full in body with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Sweet malt flavors with a butter cookie characteristic. Hops balance with some bitterness and herbal notes. Smoke lies in the backround and does not overtake the brew, but adds nice complexity. Highly drinkable and almost begs to be finished, but you want this to last.","Lupe","Dec 13, 2002"
4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability & Notes: This is one of those sip and savour brews as the complex flavours do not deter the palate from being overwhelmed yet the after taste is never-ending.
