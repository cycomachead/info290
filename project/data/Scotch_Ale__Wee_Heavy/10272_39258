As the name suggests, there is a rum aroma and taste. You can also taste the oak. I am not crazy about the finish since rum has never been my favorite liquor. There is too much of a medicine like after taste for me. The feel is refreshing in a soda like way. Perhaps the mouth feel and color makes me feel like I am drinking a Coke. I am not as familiar with this style and perhaps need to get used to it. Will try other examples of this style and perhaps re-evaluate my rating. However, for now I do not see myself buying this one anytime soon.","Gajo74","Oct 21, 2014"

Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, vanilla, rum, oak, plum, brown bread, light clove, herbal, and oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and oak notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, rum, oak, plum, brown bread, light clove, light coconut, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, vanilla, rum, oak, plum, brown bread, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of malt and oak flavors; with a great malt/oak flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice oaked scotch ale! All around good complexity and balance of malt and oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

This resulted in a pseudo-cascade which netted me two fingers of dense, light-tan head that slowly fell, leaving brilliant lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) with an enviable button-brightness. Nose smelled strongly of oak, rum, smoke, and sweet malt. Phew! I remember smoking cigars that smelled like this. Mouthfeel was medium and, man, was it sweet. It was a bit much for me, as a self-avowed hophead, but I liked the way that the beer commingled with the oak and rum to create a very evocative taste. Finish remained wildly sweet, so much so that one of these would be plenty for me. I am keeping an open mind as I open some of my other bottles from this brand.","woodychandler","Jan 26, 2014"

The flavor follows the aroma, sweet sugary malt beverage with light fruit and rum beep in the background. Little to no hop bitterness or flavor.

The aroma is subdued, maybe because of the cold mug. I bet they drink this at room temperature on Great Britian. I only detect s mild aroma of hops and malt. Flavor is balanced but also subdued, first the carbonation, then hops, malt, and buttery togfee. Brentk56's description below is better than mine, and I agree with him. Mouthfeel is medium-light after the initial carbonation. Overall this is interesting, but it does not grab my attention or my passion. I'm glad I tried it.","Dsimenson","Nov 10, 2013"

Pretty pleasant smelling stuff, I'm engaged let's take the first sip. A bit sweet but very enjoyable limited heat from the rum, which is a good thing. The oak chips soaked in rum added to a nice base Scotch ale is great concept, definitely solid and enjoyable. Flavors are straight forward hints of vanilla oak, caramelized sugars with a soothing hint of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with no cloying or over done qualities, carbonation is rather light but appropriate for this beer. Overall I would drink this again, a solid offering that any liquor or beer drinker will enjoy. This could be a perfect cigar beer, next time I will try that pairing.","WVbeergeek","Oct 15, 2013"

The nice part is the oak isn't too crazy like many oak beers can be. The mouthfeel is nice too with a smooth creamy feel. The only knock would be is on the flatter side. Kind of feels like the beer has been sitting around too long. Overall, I'm on an Innis and Gunn kick. This is another very well put together beer.

I'm not saying theres not a better wee heavy/beer out there but rum cask is exceptional... Other wee heavy's I've had, had a bit more umph to it. Rum cask is smooth.. which is amazing being it's aged in casks. To me the cask beers usually are the ones with the umph. I don't have the greatest sense of smell but the smell was good... great carbonation which made a two finger head that stayed very long with sticky lacing. Very complex mouthier but again very smooth and layered perfectly. I really can't taste too much alcohol burn, barely taste that it's there but it is in the nose. It also may be more subtle because I like to drink it a tad colder than the recommended wee heavy temp.... still tatstes great at its temp. Love the Rum beers and this is one of the best...","pjkelley82","May 22, 2013"

Taste is smooth and malty with an oaked rum over the whole thing. Vanilla and mild cherry merge with rum and dark sugar and roasted grains. Thickish weight and feel with a delightful, smooth and mild carbonation.

This beer had great drinkability, I wasn't expecting it to go down smooth and quickly, the flavor held my attention and I would mind drinking more then a couple of these by the campfire. What I like most about this beer was the great mouthfeel and the great balance this beer had, that's what made this beer above average. What I liked least about this beer was that the rum wasn't as bold as I would like and it was a little too sweet, if those were worked on this would be a very good beer. I would buy this beer again when looking for an affordable and good barrel aged beer, I can see getting this often and I recommend giving this beer a try if barrel aged beers are your thing. This was my first rum barrel aged beer and my first beer from this brewery and I have to say that I was impressed and I'm interesting in checking more of there different beers out, good job guys, you can bet I will be a repeat customer.","StoutHunter","Jun 24, 2012"

It has a nice aroma of oak and rum, blended with a spicy and hoppy ale -- the flavor is the same. You can taste the rum, but peppery spice is my favorite part of this beer. This and the alcohol content makes this a perfect sipping beer, best served after a meal or paired with a cigar or pipe. This is not one that I would drink more than a glass or two in a sitting ~ because of the bold and rich flavor, not alcohol content.","BigRedGator","Jun 22, 2012"

Aromas are roasted and woody, with dark fruit spices and floral notes. The nose is dark and subtle. Flavors are sweet, with a candied sugar initial taste, followed by some subtle oak and brown sugar characteristics, I'm assuming from the rum barrels. I mean, I'm sure it's not just a clever name. Roasty and currant fruit undertones keep the sweetness from being overpowering. The body is somewhat light, but smooth overall. The aftertaste is syrupy sweet, and imparted with oaky characteristics, it almost has a maple syrup like profile (only oak, because it's not a maple barrel). The finish has a slight linger that slowly shrinks away, leaving a semisweet touch on the palate. Not bad, but I'm not blown away.","GarthDanielson","Feb 09, 2012"

The taste holds notes of vanilla, cinnamon, buttercream, toffee, rum spice, very light oak, and light ginger. This stuff is very complex, each flavor inhabiting its own layer and its own wave across the tongue. Nice. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a damn fine beer, no surprise from the I&G crew.","TMoney2591","Jan 29, 2012"

The taste of this brew compared to the other Oak Aged Ale by Innis & Gunn to me was much nicer here. The flavors were still pretty intense but in a more balanced manner here. The rum flavors kind of die off midway through the bottle leaving you with a sweet dry flavor in your mouth. The mouthfeel of the beer was medium bodied and smooth.

(Why not abandon clear glass bottles?). Taste has some toffee and raisin and a sugared richness from the rum barreling. But the weight is still pretty light, less than I'd expect from barrel aging. It's an interesting beer but I still get the impression they've taken a pretty mediocre beer, absorbed just a tad of the barrel qualities, and then marketed it in clear fancy bottles to show off more the look and concept of the beer than to have the best possible product.","MoreThanWine","Jul 24, 2011"

Huge toasty nose that's full of oak and caramel with hints of vanilla, tobacco, and just a touch of ginger, dark fruit and rum. Toasty caramel and oak dominate the taste as well with lots of vanilla and just a touch of cinnamon. Spiced rum and whiskey are present as well with just a smidgen of cocoa making this a really complex and flavorful brew. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, mellow and slightly creamy with almost no evidence of the 7.4 ABV. A hugely drinkable beer considering how rich it is. This is my third different offering from Innis & Gunn and it won't be my last. I love barrel-aged beers and these guys know how to do it well.

The head dissipates in under a minute leaving the deep brown brew to stand virutally alone. The aroma is eclectic; the wood of the aging barrels is up front as is the sweetness of the rum. Notes of spice (presumably from the rum barrels) elevate as the beer warms while the more traditional beer aromas of yeast and malt are secondary here. It has a very ""island"" character to it. The first sip is a bit of a let down given the heavy aromas coming from my glass. The body is good not thin or watery while offering no syrupy slick either. The carbonation is low as suspected with the quickly dissipating head. There is a background of woodsiness,not overpowering at all, but I am missing a lot of the spice and sugar on my pallet (I have just gotten over a cold a couple of days ago, but I don't think I'm tasting at a deficit). The smoothness of the brew in both its carbonation and even body combined with its mellow flavors allow for a highly drinkable beer for me, whose alcohol content is right on at 7.4%. I don't get a boozy character in the 7% range which is a pleasant departure from many of the high octane liquor barrel conditioned brews.","ArrogantDeadGuy","Dec 21, 2010"

The rum character is light to mild and really enhances the aroma. The taste is good. It has a damn smooth malt flavor. It's sweet with excellent caramel notes. It goes down easy with a dry oakey finish. There is a hint of rum in the finish as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

There is a brown sugar sweetness as well. The rum flavor is quite present in the taste but its not harsh, blends in nicely with the malt. Almost gives it a cola like flavor. There is a pleasant vanilla flavor as well. I don't pick up too much from the malt. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation; starts off and finishes sweet but nothing cloying. The ABV is well hidden. A very drinkable barrel aged brew. The rum flavors worked well with the malt body.

More brown sugar than anything else in the nose, plus a faint skunk (thank you, clear bottle) and some faint leafy hops. Sweet and sugary flavor with, yes, a slight rum kick and a bit of cola to round things out. Quite nice, actually, with some pleasant lime and vanilla nuances and an agreeable spice integrated nicely with the somewhat high alcohol. Nice work from Innis & Gunn, better than their usual offerings by far.","soulgrowl","Jan 08, 2010"

3.86,1,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3,"Red mahogany with a generous capping of tightly formed beige head. The head lasts right to the end and leaves some lace behind. Aroma of vanilla & plum with hints of toffee & cherry. There's big rum note in the nose, and a little bit of spice. The vanilla flavour is much more pronounced than in the Innis & Gunn Original. It's pretty buttery, perhaps both from diacetyl and oak. Dark fruit, some spice, hint of toffee, and that rum character again. Sweet with a mildly sour finish. Alcohol is extremely well hidden, and integrates extremely well into the overall flavour profile as it comes forward. Light-medium body with fine carbonation. Feels syrupy. I find the sweetness becomes a little much towards the end, but this is otherwise a delicious sipper.","mintjellie","Nov 01, 2009"
2.98,-22,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"M&D: overly fizzy and fluffy comes the palate, and the body comes a bit too thin as well. The lengthy ageing process (107 days) for this limited edition seems to be at the expense of flavour and fails to bring out whatever unique elements rum casks are supposed to contribute. Plus, in terms of bottling quality, the much added CO2 is a major put-off for my palate, hence a rather poor rating for this beer overall (in comparison with other Innis&Gunn products).","wl0307","Sep 12, 2009"

Taste is pretty good, kind of light, oaky sourness, vanilla and caramel, rum and bananas, brown sugar, raisin, some fruit, buttery, not bad.

Well done!","ChrisCage","Nov 25, 2008"
3.13,-18.1,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Taste is pretty boozy. For me there is a lack of depth and it leans a bit too far to the sweet side of the palate. Luckily there is a bit of granny smith apple tartness to get things a bit more on track. Dried fruit and vanilla round off the palate with a bit of a woody undertone. Creamy in the mouth with a very mild carbonation, a bit thin feeling. This is a sessionable beer but I still find it a bit on the sweet side.","trevorwideman","Nov 13, 2008"
