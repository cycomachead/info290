"A very nice Peated Scotch Ale."
""
"Bancreagie Peated Scotch Ale pours clean, brilliant reddish chestnut, under a 1‚Äù off-white foam cap  that is moderately persistent. On the nose is roast barley, a dash of peat smoke, malt spice and a suspicion of fruit. Smoke and banana emerge more on the palate with kettle sugars and a dash of caramel. The beer is smooth with a medium full body and moderate carbonation."

"Overall (3.27) : My first Peated Scottish Ale. I don't think it's bad, but I wouldn't buy it again. It's just not my type of beer. With that being said, it's drinkable, but the strong alcohol presence really turns me off, especially at only 7.6% ABV. I'm drain-pouring this one unfortunately."

"Pours a hazy deep amber in color with a smaller off-white head. LOTS of lacing is seen when sipped that first leaves rings then slowly slides back down. Lots going on with the aroma and there is hints of caramel, medium roasted malts, with slight herbal and yeast. Even more going on with the taste with a nutty and dark fruit at the end with a slight tangy finish with a touch of smoke. Overall, it was decent. It's a 'sipper' and not a 'chugger' brew though."

"Bancreagie pours a hazy dark amber color with a nice large lacing head. There is a weak aroma, with a sweet but sharp malt aroma. The taste has a nice mellow malt flavor flavors, very balanced, with a hint of a sourness. Overall its a nice drinking mellow scotch ale."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep orange copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, raisin, pear, brown bread, peat smoke, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/smokey earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, peat smoke, and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, raisin, pear, light chocolate, peat smoke, light nuttiness, herbal, and yeast/smokey earthiness. Slight earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, light chocolate, brown bread, herbal, peat smoke, light nuttiness, and yeast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, peat smoke, and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice scotch ale. Good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity/earthy yeast, and moderate peat smoke flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O - I like the smokiness of this beer. The sweet malt accentuates the smoke. It's worth a try."

"Good brew! Worth trying for a certainty, maybe you'll choose to pass if you've got a number of wee heavies under your belt already but I think this is a solid first for me. I like it, but I don't see myself running back to the liquor store to pick up a sixer. I'll call this a 3.5 - the perfect 'good'."

"mostly inoffensive, deceptively strong, not my cup of tea"

"My review of this beer disappeared, so here it is again. This beer looks great and tastes awful. I love the deep amber, nearly but not quite ruby color that reminds me of glowing embers in a fire place. This was my first experience with peated malt and I absolutely hate it. Like licking a band-aid soaked in medicine."
""
"As with the flavor, the feel is too light and thin for a Wee Heavy. It's a bit thin regardless, and only the carbonation gives it crispness. This causes a lack of real flow or depth. While fairly smooth, it goes flat at the end."
"O) I enjoyed this beer. In fact, I enjoyed it more than several of the more highly regarded Scotch Ales I've tried. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Its not a favorite and I will probably not get it again I like the brewer just not this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - not a bad offering but not really notable within the style"
""
"Final Thoughts: As I mull over the last few sips of Brau Brothers Bancreagie, I'm torn on a rating. Though it has grown on me, the lack of any real complexity leaves me a little underwhelmed. I think as a one-off or seasonal release it would be worth having a bottle or two but I don't understand it's year-round status. Would I drink it again? Maybe an oak-aged version."
"O- Not my typical style but I found it good with the bbq tri-tip for dinner. The smoke really comes on in the middle but finishes nice. Decent beer imo"
""
""
""
"O= This is a solid beer. A nice smoky beer at a reasonable price. Works well but it's not the beast scotch ale I've had."
""
"Overall: Decent enough, packs a malty punch but average scotch ale."
""

"Very nice beer, and fairly easy drinking."
"There are better scotch ales out there, but this is worth trying..."

"Generally this beer was a good, malty Scotch ale, except for the ""peat"" flavor. Having drunk and thoroughly enjoyed oaked and smoked beers, and Islay single malt whiskeys, I have to say that this beer didn't taste ""earthy," as should be expected. What I had hoped to be a malty, earthy beer, to me tasted metallic with a chemical after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one takes a bit, but it's nice and interesting after you get adjusted to the peatiness. As a big fan of peated scotches from Islay, much like those, it grows on me."
"Ruby coloured ale. Peat smoke, burnt sugar and fruity yeast in the nose. Immediate smokey peat flavour, sweet caramel and light roast follow. Finishes bitter sweet. I really like this beer. It's defenetly peaty, with a surprising hoppy bitter finish."
"O - A bold flavoured ale that boasts a solid smokey peat flavour profile. Easy drinking and nicely balanced. A tasty brew that represents the style nicely and is well worth seeking out."
""
""
"Overall, a nice try except for the foam. I almost had to keep it from shooting out of the bottle when I opened it. Not right."
""
""
""
"Overall: I thought this one was quite interesting. Lots of depth and complexity. I would have another."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very nice Scotch Ale. I like the peat focus, but wish that just a few more of those residual sugars had been gobbled up. Light years better than the old Brau Brothers Scotch Ale."

"Very drinkable. I bought a sixer and could sit here and drink them all. Very good job."
""
"I would drink this brew to some Ryan Kisor trumpet sounds, you know, like the sounds on his cd Power Source. Ok now. I guess I'm done here then."
""
"The body is a bit thin for what i would want in the style, bring up the body a bit by adding a bit more peat and roasted/caramel malts and this would be really good i think, just a bit light for me, but it does make it very approachable."
"Drinkability: Scotch in beer form. Needless to say, I like the beer form the best right now. Very solid, tasty, and drinkable brew."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid brew, not one I would seek out, but it is one I appreciated drinking."
""
""
"The makings of a nice beer are here, but the peat is overdone for my preferences. I have enjoyed most Brau beers up to this point, but will probably skip past this one in the future."
"This installment of from Brau Bros pours a nice looking dark amber to mahogany color with a few centimeters of head. Grainy toasted malt in the nose. The peat wafts about. This trend continues on the palate. Lots of smooth malt. The peat adds an earth, nutty, smokey flavor. This is an easy drinking, tasty beer."
"I always look forward to picking up a rack or two when I pass close enough to the brewery"
"Bit of a disappointment from Brau Brothers. The appearance is a dark amber/light brown with a little head and no lacing. The smell is decent smoky peat aroma. The taste is kind of tart and tannic. Not very nice, nor particular of a Scotch/Scottish ale. I like the idea of a peated ale like this, but this needs more malt to make it work."
""
"D: Unique and good. Very tasty."
""
"Overall, a decent scotch. A nice amount of spice that I didn't expect. Okay drinkability."
"O: This is a great beer that I will definitely be buying again. There is just so much flavor here for a medium bodied beer."
"Notes: This beer is medium in body, but mouthfeel is just a bit thin for the style. Flavorful and complex, it's a sipper for cold evenings. Quite tasty, as this is a very solid offering from Brau Brothers."
""
"Overall - I found the flavors here to be quite appealing yet different at the same time which I found to be very good. The flavor will not appeal to everyone, but those who enjoy their beer with a different kind of flavor would be wise to check this out. Plus it's a pretty easy drink as well!"
""
""
""
"O: A very nice peated Scottish style ale; I wish there was a little more punch in the aroma but that is one of the few dings here; nice beer"
""
""
"Breaking up the winter warmers, I tried this one. I've tried a few scotches in the past year and this one gives a nice simulation of the flavors of a mildly peated scotch. I find its profile to be close to JW Black Label--some peat but not overpowering. An interesting beer."
"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending me this one! Shared with caSSino and the NoDa Brewing crew! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, peat, caramel hop, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, peat, wood, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing on this one really stood out to me if I am honest. The peat character was definitely there, but it was not very pronounced as one might expect based on the name of the brew. It did go down pretty smooth however, which was nice to say. Worth trying if you see, but not worth seeking out."
"O- A very good Scottish Ale, but it just needs a bit more intensity. Not that every beer has to be a flavor attack, but this is just a bit lighter in all regards than most of the style. Still, a solid beer."
"Overall, I'm just not terribly impressed. Not offensive by any means, but nothing special either."
"O - I enjoyed this one. Not as heavy and a little hoppier than most scotch ales, I still liked this for what it was."
"D/O: While this beer stops short of being a wee heavy, it does provide some satisfying malt-focused qualities that are, arguably, Scottish. It exceeds the typical Belgian dark ale because it doesn't rely too heavily on dark fruit, conveying more pure grain in flavor and smell, while also suggesting some heady spirituousness that exceeds the empirical reality."
"Bancreagie Peated Scotch Ale is a dark brown colored brew, with a small tan head. The scent is a heavy dose of carmalized malts, a hint of peaty smoke.. Taste-wise, it starts off with a nice dose of caramel malt, toffee, some hazelnuts, fairly earthy, a bit of smokey flavor, which is well-blended. There is a bit of diacetyl, maybe a touch of spice from the alcohol as it warms a bit. Hop profile is floral and blended well. The mouth is medium bodied and pretty wet."
"And apparently Bancreagie is Scottish for ‚ÄúWhite-rock‚Äù. Not quite Claymore or Skull Splitter, and while I can‚Äôt say this scotch offering is quite as good as either of those, it is still worth a try if you can find it."
"This beer is a light amber shade in appearance. a wonderful smell of cherrywood smoke. Pretty easy drinking, with a nice smokey note that isn't typical for scotch ales. I love a good smoked beer that can be sessionable, so this was a winner. That said, it's a bit watery in the mouthfeel."
"Medium to light bodied with low carbonation. The mouthfeel on this beer could use quite a bit of work. Not bad overall, but I am not sure I would seek it out again."
"According to the label, Bancreagie is the named after the granite that creates the aquifer from which the water for the beer comes from in Lucan. The rest of the label basically says they are trying to make an authentic Scottish ale. Off white head bubbles up high when I tip the glass a bit too hard for the last bit of beer, which settles into a light lace. Amber to copper all in the glass with highlights around the edge. Definite smoky peat in the nose over top of lots of malt, some hop and a mineral smell. Light and airy in the mouth, peat isn't as strong as the nose would suggest. Strong caramel and burnt biscuit. Not a lot off the back--somewhat disappears. Not a bad beer, but I'm not a huge fan at this point. Happy to drink this one but unlikely to get a six pack."
"Cheers!"
"M - Thin to medium body with a syrupy sensation. Good, not-too-strong carbonation. Juicy sweet finish."
"O- For the style and alcohol content, this is a very tasty pick. Well done."
"The reason I enjoy this one is that it is a summer style beer with some character and complexity. Wont fill you up and isn't boring. Perfect for sitting by the fire."
"Overall, I really enjoyed the hell out of this beer. I would love to have this one again someday. Really a nice beer to add whiskey barrel aging too. Well done Bros.!"
"A Scottish Ale that has some uniqueness. More carbonation would definately improve this beer."
"Mouthfeel- the carbonation is barely there and what is there is large rough bubbles. But the body is great. This beer shows some great progress for this company. Moo Joos and sheepshead are good stuff. This beer, I think, could use a revision, especially when it comes to carbonation. I like the fruitiness but some darker tones or less crystal malts could go a long way."
"Drinkability is okay, but not something I'd revisit a lot, too abrasive."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. The extra peat smoke adds a dimension to this Scotch Ale that takes it a notch above others. Love that sweet and smoky malt flavor in this one. Will definitely buy this one again and store it for Fall/Winter. But I'll enjoy what I have now for Spring."
"O - This is a top notch ale. I have had a few very decent brews from Brau Bros and will certainly try more."
"This beer pours a hazy ruby brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and a hint of earthy peat. The taste is considerably more peaty than the aroma with some nice smokiness too. There is still a solid caramel backbone, but the peat really stands out. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very fine beer. It reminds me a lot of Samuel Adams Scotch Ale, but fuller in flavor. I can see this becoming a stable for me when I'm in the mood for something malty."
"I'm not a big Scotch Ale fan. Usually the burnt aftertaste gets old for me fast. However, this one really did it for me. The carbonation kept it lively, and the sweet taste did not linger too long. The alcohol level seemed right for this beer. I'm going to have to seek out more Brau Brothers offerings."
