"Comes across much more like a BA quad than a wee heavy."
""
"Appearance: Brillliant chestnut to brown tinted ruby under a thin finely bubbled white foam cap. Produces thin lace and has good legs. Smell: Darker malts, grain, kettle sugars, light caramel, faint smoke. Very slight floral hop aromas. Taste: Big malty palate with grain and kettle sugars, low to moderate esters, finishes dry. Mouthfeel: Full bodied, malty sweetness moderated by slightly warming alcohol. Carbonation moderate."

"O - A nice Wee Heavy. The flavors are a bit overshadowed by the booziness of the beer."

"This is currently one of my favorite styles of ale. I feel confident that I know what to expect and appreciate when tasting this style both imported and domestic. However, I have to admit that I have limited experience with bourbon barreled Scotch Ales. That having been said, I still have to say that I found this example just a bit ""Wee Heavy"" in the ABV and bourbon flavor. I plan on purchasing another bomber and will hold it for a while to see what evolves."

"Bottle from Hop City on my Atlanta visit. Pours murky amber colored with a toe finger creamy off white head. Nutty aroma with lots of bourbon and very dry oak, caramel, toffee, some vanill. Flavor is a nice blend of big time bourbon and lots of dark fruits, very oaky vanilla finish, caramels and biscuity malts abound. Plus bodied with more than adequate carbonation, smooth. Overall se nice things going on here. A bit dryer than I like my BA beers but stil comes together nicely."

"This is a great example of a Wee Heavy, it really warms up your mouth, and the aftertaste leaves a lingering sweet flavor  that just begs you to take one more sip."

"O- Not bad at all...just a little light in the flavor dept. I'd rather have an Alesmith or Backwoods...something that stands out. This is fine...but just fine."
"O-I would have never guessed the alcohol was around 11% and it was rather drinkable. That being said, this bomber is the same price as a 4 pack of Backwood's Bastard and a little more than the price of two bottles of Wulver. This like many of Clown Shoes offerings are completely hit or miss and I would never pay to drink this again. Release it as a 4 pack for the same price and I will consider it but this was a watery disappointment overall. 3/5"

"Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but I started to get a little worried when I got to the aroma and the barrel aspect was pretty light, but it made up for in the taste with more barrel flavors and some really nice balance.  This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, fairly sticky, a little silky, not too crisp, a little warming, slightly filling and the taste did a good job of holing my attention, one glass might be the perfect amount for me, but I know I'll have no problem drinking the whole bottle by myself even though it is a little warming.  What I liked the most about this beer was the taste, it was very nice and it was just what I expect from the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were pretty nice, but they still could have used just a little work.  I would buy this beer again and I wish I had another bottle to cellar and see how it changes over time.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes barrel aged scotch ales.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and a little impressed, I started to doubt it a little, but when I  got to the taste it really delivered and I ended up enjoying it.  Since I did a comparison between Wulver Backwoods Bastard recently I'm confident in saying this is my third favorite of the style with Backwoods coming in second and wulver first, but they are all pretty close to being on the same level.  Good job guys, this was a tasty barrel aged Scotch Ale, keep up the hard work."

"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Murky brown color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Strong bourbon nose. Flavor is bourbon and hints of caramel, maybe some alcohol in the background. Nice wee heavy. Pricey at $12.99 for a 22oz bottle from Big Deal Irving Spofford, NH."

"O: Good, but nothing spectacular.  Definitely worth the price, and I’m glad I tried it, but next time I get a Clown Shoes beer I will probably go back to their RIS’s that I love.  4"
"Overall - Decent beer with a decent barrel character."

"The mouthfeel really seems to be something that really helps and gives the beer some better life as the brew seems to weaken shortly after opening.  A solid though barrel aged wee heavy though."
"Clown shoes continues with a good utilization of barrels. It is hard not to compare this to the Central Waters Reserve or Backwoods but honestly it holds up fairly well to both of them. The oak is just a bit more juxtaposing but I would get this again for sure."
""
"Not sure what people see in this that give it such high ratings.  If I was doing a blind tasting, the nose would tell me this was a Flanders Red.  Really nice wood and some earthy tartness in the nose.  Followed by not much in regards to flavor.  Yeah, there's really not too much going on here.  Just some barrel character - vanilla sweetness and some heat.  That's pretty much it.  Drinks pretty easy for 12% but not that great."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 6/19/2014. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak, light smoke/roast, light nuttiness, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity/earthy yeast ester notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, oak, light smoke/roast, light nuttiness, and yeast/aok earthiness on the finish for a while. Slight earthy/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, apple, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut, light smoke/roast, light nuttiness, nd yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible robustness and complexity of big dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a fantastic malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged scotch ale! All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Had too much bourbon presence. Tasted like I was drinking straight Woodford Reserve which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you love bourbon.  I just prefer my BBA beers to be more subtle.  Also not enough malt backing IMO."

"O - Good and tasty, but falls short compared to Founders Backwoods and Central Waters Reserve."
""
""
"Dark amber/brown color with a decent sized off white head that shows moderate retention. Sweet malty sugary aromas with hints of smoke and oak. Sweet sugary maltiness with lots of dark fruitiness. Light smoke and oak flavors with a solid shot of alcohol towards the finish. Medium to thick body with a sweet sticky mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. Not horribly complex and a touch high on the alcohol burn but a solid sipper."

"Overall: What a boozy beast. You don't expect subtly from a group named Clown Shoes, but this is a bit over the top. An experience, but I can't see making it a regular staple."

"A not-so-wee heavy meets barley wine.  Outstanding and delicious."
""
""
"Overall pretty nice, great bourbon nose, bourbon fell off a bit on the taste but still rounds off the beer nicely, with so much sweet characters but not too sweet in general, lots of caramel all over, nice nutty toffee presence, hint of bitterness on the back end, nice level of alcohol, pretty enjoyable but still a sipper."

"Overall a very good beer. When i first smelled the aroma of this one, I thought I smelled a little vinegar, but as the beer warmed a little, that went away completely, so I figured it was just me."

"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 06/19/14.  Served in a thistle glass, the beer pours a murky reddish/brown color with about a half inch light tan head.  Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like toffee, vanilla, bourbon, caramel, and some dark fruit (raisin, plum).  The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some peaty smoke and brown sugar, and there's a bit of apple noticeable as the beer warms up.  It's also a little boozy, but not too much.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and a bit syrupy with moderate carbonation.  I think it's a good brew, maybe I should have picked up another bottle to see how it ages.  $13.99 a bomber."
""
"O: Not a bad wee heavy. Pretty typical but a bit heavier than traditional. The bourbon adds lots of oak and toffee which mostly compliments the base flavors."

"Overall (4.0), a very nice beer, and done in a style (BBA Wee Heavy) that I really enjoy, but that I can never seem to find very often. In the context of the lack of availability of the style, this is a very good beer, and one I would probably buy again in the right opportunity. But I just wish there was a little more to it. Perhaps this is a case of expectations being too high."
""
""
""

"Overall, this was a solid beer. I would prefer Old Chubs over this if I was looking for a wee heavy."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol is well hidden for a 11.00 % abv beer. I am glad I have a few more bottles of this to age."

"Overall - This beer is okay, but only just. It's watery and, honestly, it puts me in mind of something like a stronger Miller High Life. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I can't believe, with the other amazing beers Clown Shoes puts out, that this was what they were shooting for. While this one was definitely a big let down, I'll be looking forward to next year's release! Hopefully they decide to go back and do some tweaking! I think the hype has gotten to this one."
""
"O - it's a good beer. Feels like they might have bottled it too fast though. I feel like a wee heavy that is barrel aged should have more of a depth of flavor. I am being very critical as I hold Clown Shoes to a high standard. Give this one a shot."
"O - I like it quite a bit.  My description does not do this beer justice and any negative connotations you get from reading my review are probably due more to my inability to adequately describe it than any shortcomings on the part of the beer.  This is good stuff and worthy of a try if you even remotely like the style."

"O:  Like most CS BA beers just missing something from making them great it's like you go to the plate for a Home Run then you bunt.  I know ppl are impressed with how they churn out BA beers and their availability but I think their availability is due to not being astonishingly good.  Grab a Backwoods Bastard or a Thirsty Dog Wulver if you want satisfaction from a BA Wee Heavy."
""
""
"There is more available at one of my favorite stores, but I'm not buying any more. I was hoping for a grand slam, and got a double because of an error by the short stop."
""
""
"Even more solid work from Clown Shoes. It's good to see them getting more respect as they continue to expand their high quality barreled offerings. Ride The Lion is perhaps not the pinnacle of the style but it is quite delicious nonetheless."
""
"The bourbon barrel saves this beer."
""
"O: Probably the best thing I have had from this company. Pretty impressed. A good representation of the style especially because of that butteriness and the barrel aging is well done."

"This is at least a 4.0, but well closer to 4 than 5.  Very tasty, with the subtleties that I've come to see as a trademark of barrel aged Clown Shoes beers.  Not really mindblowing like Very Angry Beast, but I'm not complaining about a delicious BBA Scotch ale.  How does it compare to Backwoods Bastard?  Meh, both very good.  BB has a lot of bottle variation; its best is better than this, its worst is not.  I already feel like what I'm writing is trifling, so time to stop."

"Overall, this is a very interesting barrel aged Wee Heavy in comparison to my favorites, Backwoods Bastard and Wulver. Somewhere in the middle between the two. But I would highly recommend this to any lover of this type of beer. Another winner from one of my favorite breweries!"

"O: A very nice example of a BA wee heavy. Not quite as barrel forward as backwoods, but it is still integrated very well and plays a big enough role. Far too easy to drink for being 11% as well, but it is very enjoyable to sip on and allow it to warm and open up. Snag some if you can find it"

"Pours dark orangy/reddish color. Thick foamy head with good retention and lacing on the side. Boozy, fruity aroma. Maybe plums. Boozy, dark fruit taste. Very smooth, though. Does have that bourbon tastes. Very aromatic. Goes down very well. May have a slight caramel taste to the end."

"A brew that needs to be allowed to rise to almost room temp: this was dull until that point, & opened up like a hosta in the sun afterwards. Like most of Clown Shoes product, a good beer."

"O: a nice BA Wee Heavy. Not as good as Wulver or Backwoods Bastard but overall pretty good. Still a bit hot, glad I picked up a couple so I can sit on them for awhile. Priced at 12.99 for the Bomber is way more expensive than Bastard but essentially the same as Wulver. Really enjoy this style, glad to have another good example."
