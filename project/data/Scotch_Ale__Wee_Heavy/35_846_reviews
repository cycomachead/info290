"O: All in all, this is a good beer. A nice clean easy drinker. This seems like it may be a good beer to convert BMC drinkers to craft."

"Overall impression: nice offering, a good choice for the first snowfall of the season"
"Excellent Sam Adams brew here. Something I'd like to see around in the fall but I believe it is only available throughout the spring."
"Samuel Adams doesn't just provide a superficial glimpse of the scotch ale style as many brewers do, they provide you with a bona fide example that is indistinguishable from the immemorial ales of Scotland. While it doesn't take the style to the same extremes as other American micros, I'd still consider this one of my favourite examples this side of the pond."
"Poured in snifter."
"O- Probably the most easy-drinking, sessionable version of a Scotch Ale I've had. Not the best one, but a really solid rendition."
"Overall: This is a good Scotch Ale that is nice for all the floavor you get from a lower abv version of the style. I tend to like this style and there are others out there that I would choose over this. That said, it is probably one of the first ones I will claim out of the Sam Adams variety packs."
"Note: I thought the taste was really good especially since I wasn't impressed with the smell."
"Conclusion: This, like almost everything brewed by the Boston Beer Co. is a well crafted, moderately complex tasty beer. I think it holds true to the original style and tastes quite good."
"Good flavor especially warm. Feel is too easy for a scotch ale. It finishes cleanly and unfortunately the flavor backs away and disappears too quickly. An easily accessible scotch ale"
"Love the use of fruit and the way the alcohol compliments it like that of wine. Nice brew for the sampler packs, like its counterpart the Irish Red its a well Sam Adams view on the style. I would love to see this distributed more, its very easy and pleasant to drink. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"Not as much caramel aroma as I expected. A little chocolate, a little roast, a very small hint of smoke. The flavors are slightly more bold. In particular, the smoke is stronger, lending a touch of meatiness. Overall, though, it's lacking in both sweetness and robustness. Fairly thick, but not exactly coating. A tasty enough beer, but somewhat frustrating in its tameness."
"D: This wasn't bad, but not terribly impressive. Below average scent, and not very clean or delicious taste. Not difficult to drink, but not overly enjoyable either. There are lots of better scotch ales out there."
"Overall, a good, solid rep of the scotch ale clan"
"Pours a reddish amber, thick head, lacing. Smells peaty, smokey, but clean. Taste has a smoky bite to it, balanced, a bit of a bitter finish on the end. Acidic quality to it works. Clean mouthful, but bitterness lingers. Overall? A very nice Wee Heavy from Sam Adams."
"Never would have thought to give this brew a try, but with the sam adams variety pack it's great not to have to spend $ on a full 6 pack of something that may be a bust. This brew is great, i could enjoy year round."
"Pours a pretty solid looking, one finger creamy head that is sticking around pretty well and is giving good lacing. The body is dark dark red with a fair amount of brown in it, lots of carbonation, maybe too much, we will see. Overall this looks really good, the head is very impressive, if it weren't for the carbonation this would look perfect. It for sure smells like a scotch ale, deep malt smell with a molasses/maple syrup smell. It smells solid, doesn't smell like there is much wrong with it, does it smell amazing? No, but good. The flavor on this is a little disappointing, it's not a bad flavor or anything, just really boring. It's very smooth, and easy drinking, and even a little creamy, but it's just not that complex and it's lacking in flavor. You get that molasses/maple syrup taste and that deep malt taste, but the flavors are just dumbed down a bit all around. There isn't really anything wrong with it, no offensive flavors or anything, it's just boring, not complex and not enough flavor, it's that simple. The carbonation is better than I though it would be, not too much, and the body overall is pretty good for the style. The drinkability is decent, kinda a toss up between it not having enough good flavor, but at the same time being light because of that lack of flavor. Overall it's a good beer, just very average in the creativity category and flavor category."
"Overall: A somewhat bland take on the scottish ale style. I would drink it if offered, but I won't be going out of my way to find this one again."
"poured a dark copper, burgandy color with a nice creamy white head that left nice lacing. Smells of malt, smokey peat. Tasted of malt, then earthy hops with a hint of caramel. subtle nutty pecan. Carbinated a little too much for me but nothing too excessive. Overall a smooth offering from SA. Came in a sample 12 pack and worth a try."
"The smoky edge here is a nice flavor and kind of unexpected for me. Another solid offering from Sam Adams, the mixed packs are pretty much a must buy a few times a year."
"This is way better than I expected. I was expecting a weak, overly sweet mess, but this was good. I love all the smoke in this beer; it gives it a real unique flavor."
"This scotch ale pours out as a reddish copper colored beer, with a decent tan head on it that settles by mid glass. The smell of this beer is a on the sweet side with some possible caramel malts there is a very light aroma of peat or some kind of earthy tone to it. The taste is decent, this beer is big on malts and doesn't have a whole lot of hops in it. It's mostly a slightly roasted sweet earthy brew. It's interesting. The mouthfeel is medium and pretty easy to put a few down."
"D- easy to finish. lots of flavor packed into the almost session strength beer. i wish they sold this in six packs, id be all over it."
"Overall- I was very exicted to try this beer when I picked up the sampler pack but was kinda let down. I was kinda let down and I love Sam Adams."
"D - Not really a fan of this one. Not sure if it's the style or interpretation."
"Almost surprisingly where this beer lacks in aroma it more than makes up for in flavor. This beer comes in with a medium to full bodied but big smoky flavor. Caramel malts and even some light earthy hops show through for excellent balance in the extensive smoky finish. Soft and somewhat creamy mouthfeel make it an easy drink. I enjoyed it but I don't know if I would necessarily consider this my style."
"O: I've always loved this one and look forward to getting to it whenever I go through a SA variety pack...."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a metallic twang, a light body and mellow carbonation. A decent beer that's tastes alright, but just is a little off base for my palate preference. OK beer that I enjoyed, but not something I'd drink on a regular basis."
"Thin. Bad."
"Sam Adams Scotch, 12oz's into HopNog pint. Pours a beutiful ruby shade with a light tan 1/4"" head that drops quickly. Smells great, loads of the usual Crystal malt, pinch of chocolate malt, slight hint of Smoked malt, and a very soft touch of Hallertau's. Taste is earthy, sweet, and smokey. A very enjoyable Wee that stands out in its own class. Do yourself a favor and pair this brew with a few strips of bacon, uncured ham, chops, ect. Anything that can match its subtle smoke will prove itself to be a great reward! Cheers!"
"I've never had a scotch ale below 7%, this does it well. The super buttery/toasty feel makes it feel a little typical-Sam Adams for me but this is a nice beer."
"A mainly clear dark copper colored brew, small tan head. Slight chill haze. Scent is mainly caramel malts, just a bit of hops. Pretty malty taste, some bittering elements, some candy sugar notes. Pretty full bodied with a soft feel. Its a pretty good beer, but i dont know, something is holding it back a bit."
"Overall impression: Big miss. Too much artificial smoke character and not enough true Scottish Ale character."
"Overall: not the biggest Sam Adams fan, but I will give credit where credit is due. This is a fairly solid Scotch ale. The maltiness works well and this is a good example of the style. I would give this beer a try if you have whatever sample pack this came from. Cheers!"
"O= possible session if on-tap somewhere."
"Overall: The most sessionable Scotch ale I've had so far. Very good, but not quite as complex as others I've had. This is also the only one with a distinct peat flavor, so thats good if that is what you like."
"The mouthfeel and finish make this pretty drinkable, but I was a bit disappointed. I like my scotch ales to be a bit more malty. Still, this is a good quality beer and one that fits well in Sam's seasonal mix."
"I like Sam Adams Scotch Ale as a Scottish Ale with the likes of Robert the Bruce. I do not feel it quite fits in the same category as a Founders Dirty Bastard or Dark Horse Scotty Karate."
"Overall: A good version of a Scotch."
"overall this is a nice example of the style - with their special releases, i'm starting to reconsider my opinion of sam adams!"
"a nice dark, but not cloudy beer. reminds me of stained oak in appearance. It took me a while to figure out the taste... I drank half the stinking bottle before i could put a label on it. It reminds me of hay or grass. Mind you, it doesn't taste bad, just kinda grassy... The smell is very similar to Boston Lager, so much so that it bothers me a little. As far as mouthfeel goes, it's fairly thin, not too much, but not really thick either. Overall I like it. I don't know if I would go out and buy a case of it, but I would definitely drink it again!"
"This beer started out promising, but fell to earth fast. Too bad, as I was initially veyr impressed with it."
"Seems carbonated, and a bit oily. Astringency lingers."
"There's a slight bitterness of English hops, with its herbal-tea flavor addition. Carbonation is pushing it on the high end, and the body is far to chunky enough. Easy drinking but far from the vanguard of the style."
"This beer was a deep amber color, with good head and great lacing. There was a distinct smoky malty smell, with a little sweetness to it as well. To a large extent, it tastes like it smells - earthy and smoky, with a touch of sweetness. I thought SA Scotch Ale was quite good, but seeing as this is my first beer of this style, perhaps I have nothing else to judge it against."
"Final Notes: Sweet and smoky. What's not to like? One of Sam's better brews, I think."
"Finish: Malts and grass with a little stickiness on the lips"
"O - Sam Adams is as Sam Adams does. This isn't going to wow to many people, but it is a good brew which deserves to be tried out."
"D: I would have liked to describe this unique beer better, but I was at a loss of words. It has a very interesting taste and is easy to drink. I would suggest you try it!"
"D: Quite hoppy for the style. Very drinkable though, and not cloying in any manner. (I don't like scotch ales that are too heavy-handed in the malty sweet/caramel department.) It is funny how beers can be distinct, yet still have a brewery character to them. This one does that and pushes the style boundaries a bit, but above all it is an undeniably fine drinking beer."
"12 oz into a snifter...let me preface this by saying I am in fact a big fan of the style...not this beer...I'll try to be constructive, but this one is fairly bad...this style is supposed to have a lot of malt depth, but it's pretty much all in one layer to my taste buds and has a slightly unpleasant astringency. This was purchased out of a sample pack and I'd never buy this on it's own, especially not now. It has some characteristics of scotch ales, but is not as impressive as the standard bearers of the style. I'm not sure what it is about Sam Adams, they seem to get their lagers and pilseners done with flying colors, quite good brews, but I've never to this day had a top quality ale from them."
"Smell is sweet rich malt, some peat notes, A little nutty. Taste is roasty and peaty, some malt sweetness, some smoke and a finishing dryness and wood flavor. The body is medium with active and fine carbonation which makes for a silky and smooth beer. Overall an interesting brew though the uniqueness of the peat, wood and smoke flavors would limit my intake to one."
"12 oz bottle from a variety pack. Pours deep mahogany with a thick, white, foamy head and a good amount of lacing. Aroma is of grassy hops in the beginning followed by sweet malt and some hints of ripe fruit. Full, smooth body. Earthy hops and smoky malt are balanced on the palate with some hints of ripe fruit. Long, dry finish. Nice ale."
"An alright scotch ale on the whole, though it's a bit heavy handed with the peat smoked malt, making for a somewhat one-dimensional beer."
"OVERALL GRADE: B+"
"D: I like this. I enjoy the peat smoked malts (used in Scotch whiskeys) and the bit of a kick at the end."
"O: I liked this beer a lot. It had a lot to offer in terms of depth and substance, and it was drinkable and accessible. Top 10 beer's ive had in the last month."
"D-A good beer, you can get the sense of what the start of making the new Imperial Serials Wee Heavy is from. The Wee Heavy seems to be this beer ratcheted up a notch or two."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice flavors and balance without being too heavy. The smoky flavors are nice and not too overpowering. Really nicely balanced."
"not very heavy, i would consider this to be a lighter bodied beer. well balanced and carbonated that sits well and drinks well. Certainly drinkable and sellable in my honest opinion. I'd like to see this in some 6rs rather then some of the other brewmaster collections out there. another good one from BBC!"
"D/O- Enjoyed this one. ""Drinkability"" was there, even with the hints of peat-smoked malts. Props to BBC for this offering. Would probably buy a six pack of it if offered."
"D -"
"I'd love one of these on cask in February."
"D- Very high. Lots of flavor without killing the palate and a manageable ABV for a session. I love scotch ales, but most American brewers seem to try and go over the top with this style and, quite frankly, they are awful. Sam Adams hasn't done that, and they deserve a lot of credit. I would definitely buy this in droves if it was offered in 6 packs."
"I would drink it again but probally just in the sampler packs. Couldn't see me buying a pack of just this beer."
"D - Very drinkable beer, either on its own or as a session."
"A fine brew, the peated malts do produce a distinctive addition to the taste but not where it dominates the flavour. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability - I didn't particularly like this to be honest. That metallic taste was just offsetting. Would not seek out in the future."
"This beer pours a clear amber color with a near white finger plus of foam on the surface. The smell is strongly malty in nature, but there are nice hints of cinnamon and strong caramel notes. The taste is pretty standard for the style, but that doesn't mean it's not good. I rather enjoyed the caramel flavoring with an almost nutty background flavor. The mouthfeel was a little thin for the style, I expect a more syrupy body. This is a very good beer and I enjoyed drinking it. One of the better beers that Sam's produces."
"Deep and dark copper color with a thin whispy head. Smells a little medicinal, with a fermented cherry note. As it warmed, scents of oak and smoked malts become more apparent giving it a unique and pleasent nose. The palate is pretty nice. Dark fruits, smoked and caramel malts, and a subtle woody oak flavor. Mouthfeel is heavy and silky. This brew grew on me quite a bit. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is high. Being fair-weather fan of scotch, I actually could have stood to have this be a little stronger. I'll seek more in this vein, perhaps with even more of a scotch-like umph."
"Pours a supremely clear, dark honey-amber. A tannish head patches to the glass. Looks good already. Smell and taste are definitely smoky, peaty malts, mostly. An underlying sweetness balances things out nicely. Mouthfeel is crisp and tart, a lot of complexities going on in this beer. Perhaps my favorite wee heavy to date. Like smoked meats and cheddar in a bottle. And scotch!"
"Verdict: Recommended for the malt-heavy lovers. There's little to argue about with this brew. It's genuinely saddening to see the better Sam Adams selections relegated to mere cameo appearances in the seasonal boxes. This may have been one of the better brews I have had of Sam Adams, a claim that grows more definitive by the day. If it was available in a larger quantity, I would get it in lieu of lesser desirables. If you can spare the $13 for a 12 pack, it should be a winner for most. A- (4.13)"
"D) A decent brew. I think I'd have another. True to style."
"D: Better than the Irish Red, for sure."
"Overall this is a very good full ritch flavor beer would highy recommend"
"I am a Scotch drinker and a big fan of Islays, so this is right up my alley. It can definitely be sessioned. Shame there are only 2 in the Spring Variety Pack."
"Drinkability: Not for the brew pounding type, this is definitely a heavy beer, thought very satisfying."
"This is probably one of my favorite Sam Adams offerings, along with Old Fezziwig and Chocolate Bock. I would buy this by the case if I could."
"So I'm coming off a vacation (cruise) where all they had was mostly American/Mexican balony beer...I was Jonesin' for something with some taste and body...OOOHHH Yes....had two bottles of Samuel Adams Scotch Ale chillin in the fridge....soldiers from a recent Mixed pack! What a cure for the beer blahs....baby!!!! This beer has a great malt flavor. Its dark amber color and white head give way to perfect lacing as I drink down this wonderful libation. The drinkability and mouthfeel are excellent...SESSION...NO QUESTION! Could drink this all night long!!! Enjoy my friends!"
"It's complexity works against it here. I think it's a bit too sophisticated to drink much of."
"D: Another easy drinker from the Sam Adams Spring seasonal multi-pack."
"Overall - A pretty decent example of a Scotch Ale"
"I bought the spring mixer for this beer specifically, and don't regret doing so."
"Solid example of the style and very approachable."
"Yeah, it's not Old Chub but it's not 8% either. A bold sessionable wee heavy. One of Sam Adams' more robust regular offerings. Love that peat! I pretty much bough the Sam Adams Spring (released in February btw) mixer just for this beer. It's as good as I remember it."
"Pours a sharp red color with a one finger head with good retention and lacing. Strong malt in the aroma, but a bit weak smelling overall. Taste is much stronger, with toasted malt and a very smokey taste overall with a bit of nut and a bit of a woody taste. Mouthfeel is excellently carbonated and full bodied with a pleasantly bitter aftertaste. This is also a very gulpable beer. Very good overall, I'm very impressed."
"D - Just above average drinkablility. Goes down easy for a while, but eventually slows me down a bit. I like it a lot, but I'd only have one in a night."
"D - Yeah this is very drinkable. A good taste, interesting, not heavy, not high abv."
"Overall, the light carbonation and smooth malt profile make this brew easy to drink."
"This pours copper with a small white head disappearing to almost nothing with a little lacing. On the nose it's a mixture of sweet caramel and a smokiness underneath that. I didn't get the peaty, seawater, iodine notes that someone else mentioned, which to me would be a positive. In the mouth it's the caramel that comes out first, with a medium but somewhat cloying feel carrying down the slight smoke later on. Overall it's a decent beer but nothing I'd really go out of my way to get."
"I seem to remember last year's version being better than this. After skimming a few of the most recent reviews, the peated malt seems to have come off a lot more strongly to my palate than to most others who tasted it. Maybe my palate is just more sensitive to it, but it seems to me that the beer would be much improved by dialing down the peated malt just slightly."
"D - The drinkability is good. It goes down easy, and leaves you wanting more. For me, this is a bit light for a scotch ale, but I could and would drink quite a few of these in a sitting. I recommend giving it a try."
"All in all, this is a pretty decent beer, and better than a number of other Sam Adams brews, however I was expecting a bit more from this one. Perhaps I'd have been a little more happy with the purchase if I didn't buy their spring sampler pack specifically to get to this brew."
"great drink ability....not much alcohol....although it is full bodied...but still very drinkable"
"Notes: Recommended. Pretty big flavor and the smokiness was delicious."
"D. This a a decent brew the balance was good, the only negative was the slight soapy flavor."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before date notched at Oct. Pours a reddish copper color with a thin head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of caramel, malts, bread, and earth. Taste is a boozey caramel with some earthiness to it. Large amount of malts. One of the better beers of this mix 12 pack (American Originals). Good amount of flavor and lower ABV make it rather drinkable. Good beer."
"D-I had a difficult time getting through this one. The tastes really get to me. If I had any cookable food in my bachelor apartment, I wouldn't have finished this beer and would've kept it for marmalade. It came in the variety pack so I have one more left. I don't know what to do with it."
"D: I generally like Scotch and Scotch ales, but I didn't find this one especially drinkable."
"Two finger head with spider web lacing. Fades o pencil thin head. Low carbonation. Amber color. Smell is very sweet like 1 percent milk mixed with cereal. Slight chocolate and a hint of vanilla. touch of hops at the finish. Same with taste, but with a touch of bitterness and a dry finish."
"Could drink these all the time if i really had to, and im picky about malty beers so this one gets a tip of the hat from me."
"This is a great example of a plain and simple Scotch Ale. It's not going to blow anyone away with it brute strength or melt your digestive tract with its intense alcohol. It will, though, give you a great indication of what a flavorful, malty and multi-dimension Scotch Ale can be. ANd this one does the job very admirably."
"As with most Sam Adams beers I've tasted (yet there are a few more to go in the variety pack), this brew is balanced and slightly reserved. This very easily could have been a malty, syrupy, or smoky over-load, they scale it back just a touch so that nothing gets too far out of hand. This is something I like and dislike about SA, but in this case, I like it."
"Another blizzard, another variety pack. This participant pours a clear sunrise garnet topped by a nice finger of cream/ecru froth. The smell is kind of a letdown, as there ain't much happenin' here, despite the glass's best efforts. Some faint caramel does manage to come through, but that's about it. The taste does better, bringing in some toffee, some minor pine, some mild coffee, a tinge of dark chocolate, and an allusion to light orange peel. A light haze of peat smoke hovers over the proceedings. The body is a hefty-feeling medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel. Overall, a pretty nice Scotch ale, not the best I've tried but a highly drinkable one regardless."
"http://www.smuttynose.com/beers/the_smuttynose_big_beer_ser/scotch_ale.html"
"D- Very drinkable, i don't taste many home runs from Sam Adams sampler's, but this is one."
"I've been enjoying this beer for many years in the various mixpacks that Boston Beer Company releases. It's always a highlight for me. A good interpretation of the style."
"M/D - Could drink it all night long, its a tricky body, tastes full, but on the tongue is a medium ale."
"Mouthfeel packs a nice creamy and almost chewy full body feel, especially for something under 6% abv. Overall, Scotch Ale is probably one of BBC's better representations of all the various styles they try. This style overall really needs more love from the craft beer scene."
"D - Not very drinkable. The smokiness of it prevents it from being a solid session beer."
"Overall - A pretty bold expression. I'm impressed, it is a very good beer and they went further with it than you might expect them to."
"Drinkability: One of Samuel Adam's better one off beers, I can see why they don't put this in six packs anymore, this beer is awesome for a ale drinker like me but people used to SA's regular profile of beers might get thrown off by the flavors here. I find the smoke flavors very authentic and the malt backbone thick and viscous yet not overbarring. The low ABV makes this a decent session beer even though 2-3 of these would be enough in one sitting. Glad to see this one back in the Spring mix pack, I truly missed this beer!"
"M & D - pretty smooth. Good balance, good carbonation. Needs to go with certain foods and cannot have more than one or two at a time."
"Pours a clear amber-red color with a small white head that diminishes quickly.Scent is very malty with hardly any hop profile. I also get a lot of caramel and some brown sugar with cinnamon. Taste is surprisingly smokey...very smokey. I've never had a scotch ale with this much smokiness to it. It has a nice balance with the malts and caramel flavors. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and leaves the lining of the mouth with a nice crisp feeling. Drinkability is high. Tasty scotch ale."
"D: Not bad, not bad at all. A little too slated on the smoky-peat end of things, but over all enjoyable."
"A decent beer - nothing too remarkable, but one of the better attempts at a Scotch Ale here in the US (and better than a few imports too)."
"Poured a dark reddish brown hue. Still appeared bright though. Good clarity. The smell came off strong, kind of bitter, with a flowery aspect. The taste really stood out. The smoky taste was strong. It wasn't too heavy though. Accompanied by a malty, woody taste. Overall was a good balance between the woody, smoky, and sweet. Goes down easily, especially with a meal."
"Overall, this is very drinkable. I tend to think that the Sam variety packs are kind of hit or miss, but this one is certainly a hit. I will seek it out again."
"Pours a dark red color, with a two finger head. Looks really good. Not getting much in the way of smell. A lot of lacing on the glass as I drink. I'm getting mostly earthy malts as I sip this. Taste-wise, this doesn't stand out very much to me. It's good enough, like most Sam Adams beers, but this is not my favorite. Having said that, it's going down nicely and quickly as I type this."
"The mouthfeel is good, there's really nothing to complain about here, it's paired well to the style. A touch more body wouldn't hurt. The drinkability is absolutely superb. It goes down very easily, coats the throat perfectly, and leaves you wanting more. A great Scotch Ale that I wish were in wider distribution. This is a great one, for sure."
"Overall, an interesting take on the wee heavy style and one that I wouldn't mind drinking another of."
"This is a very meaty brew. I've had scotch ales before, but were much more stronger. This is a lot more drinkable due the sacrifice of alcohol, but it does quite well when compared with other scotch ales."
"Really impresses with this beer that I hijacked from my friends house out of a sampler 12 pack that another dinner guest brought."
"Pours out a deep copper almost mahogany color. Smell is somewhat faint, but upon big sniff I am detecting some smokey, roasted malts. The taste is slightly sweet, mildly bitter and mostly peaty smoked scotch malts. The beer has that characteristic peat/dirt taste of the funky scotch malts, slightly phenolic, and vaguely astringent tasting too, all by products of this malt. Don't get me wrong, the beer still smells and tastes very clean, almost lager-like in some ways. It sounds like this beer is sort of a mess, but in reality is a nicely balanced, rich and flavorful, slightly smokey beer. I bet this beer would be killer with some good BBQ ribs or even some chicken. It is just that drinkable, and easy on the tastebuds for someone like me who gets nausea even just thinking of smoked beers....though I have yet to really try! I love BBQ so what am I so afraid of?"
"D: Extremely drinkable. The smoke taste is very enticing and makes you want more, which is very possible with the 5.4%. I'd love to session this, but unfortunately it only come in 2's with the mixed pack"
"Incredibly drinkable! Pours a luxurious shade of red to copper with very light tan to off-white head. Beautiful appearance, as usual with a Sam Adams beer. Nose does have the identifiable smoked quality along with some appetizing caramel notes. Glad it isn't a big bitch slap in the face of smoke like other craft wee heavies out there. Nice balance of roasty, smoky, and sweet malt flavors on the palate. Just simply a delight to imbibe, refreshing and very, very drinkable."
"Drinkability - Not a big fan of the bitterness and it is filling, but still better then some."
"Very tasty brew here, I would recommend it to those who enjoy red ales and/or Scotch ales."
"Very nicely done, Boston Beer Company. Another slam dunk."
"Head was consistent when poured into a class from the bottle. Stayed with the beer till the end. Carmel flavors and overall very smooth. Unique idea with the Scotch Whiskey malt...it is noticeable in the scent and less so in the taste. I do enjoy the variety packs Sam Adams has been offering as of late, although this is not my favorite Sam Adams offering, it is solid."
"This is a solid scotch ale. Very flavorful and refreshing. Tough to drink many of these though."
"Drinkability: Not bad overall. Good taste, low ABV. Certainly not Founder's Dirty Bastard, but then again it is also a bit cheaper, so depending on your sway it's a decent choice."
"Pours a very dark brown with a very thin tan head and no lacing. Nose brings through quite a few notes, with caramel, slightly-burnt toast, and a slight peaty character. Some light dark fruit characteristics and a bit of brown sugar. The taste is mostly caramel and some dark toast. Medium feel with good carbonation and a bit of booze. Drinkability is pretty good, and a pretty good, low alcohol example of the style."
"Sam Adams delivers once again with this tasty scotch ale. It pours a golden brown with a thick head of foam that sticks around well beyond the first sip. It has a bold taste with an almost nutty taste to it. A good tasty beer with a pizza, but not exactly a summer cookout beer in my opinion."
"I poured into a pint glass and it had a deep rich carmel color with a inch of nice creamy head on it, then a nice lace around the edge. It has a nice smell of carmel malts and a little bit of hops. The beer hits the tongue with a nice roasted malt taste with a little bit of hops. It has a nice bitter taste to it. It has a little carbination but not to much. Great mouth feel and is very drinkable."
"D- very decent. I'd readily buy it again"
"D - I really enjoyed this one, pretty richly flavored to me, I see myself having a few on a mild to cool evening. I would definitely buy this one again, one of the better ones I've had from Sam Adams. Cheers!"
"D: This is easy to drink. A low ABV makes this scotch ale a worthy choice."
"Drinkability: Damn good. Id certainly like to sip on these all night. ABV is solid at 5.4, and although i feel like im drinking something a lot stronger, it doesnt hit nearly as hard. Very interesting, and stays fresh"
"Notes: Not a bad beer, but didn't really impress me past the appearance."
"pours a brownish amber like color with a half inch of off white head followed by some good lacing and light carbonation.chocolate malty taste that was also a bit nutty, smell was the same. probably one of the better samuel adams beers i've had. would drink again but not go out of my way for."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Smooth and drinkbable while still carrying some weight to it. One of the beers I wish was offered all year by the brewery and not just in the brewmaster's collection."
"A good domestic version of the style, but misses big on tradition. Not overly smokey, not big bodied or big alcohol, but a tasty beer that can be enjoyed in multiples. They stuck with their tradition and their target market. A real play it safe Scotch Ale. I've had better, but this is good one if you are new to the style or want to have more than one without getting kicked in the face by alcohol."
"Medium body with good carbonation. Crisp and refreshing yet still a substantial mouthfeel."
"Overall: In my opinion, this is Sam Adam's at its best. Whiskey lovers will like this one. Anyone will appreciate it."
"This is a good brew, although not the best Scotch Ale I have tried. What it lacks it huge flavor, looks and mouthfeel it makes up in drinkability, as this can be sessioned. A good solid brew."
"I may well have to re-review after having a few more of the style. This one likely seems a wee light to make a proper wee heavy."
"We've always been fond of this brew, even though it doesn't hold its own against many of the other American-brewed Scotch Ales that are double its size. That said, it's without a doubt one of the most drinkable Scotch Ales. Combine it with some herb-crusted, grilled pork chops and broiled, stuffed apples."
"Drinkability is pretty great. A pretty good example of the style although a little light on the abv. It goes down easy and has a good flavor. My only complaint would be the availability as I had looked for this beer for a while and it seems to only be found in the variety box. Would be good as a six-pack!"
"Taste, not quite as good as McEwans, but reminiscient and durable. Not we're exceeding expectations. Peat and smoke are detectable but far from overwhelming. Not your standard SA beer, nicely unique, smoke, sweet and peat, not too many like that. Lots to think about and find throughout this beer. Not necessariy the easiest or cheapest beer to drink."
"drinkability is good - this is the lightest scotch ale i have had and one i could see drink a few at a time"
"Drinkability: A great beer! Sam Adams really hit this one on the head. I wish that this one was more available outside the mixed packs. Definitely worth a try."
"Yet another good brew from Samuel Adams. Really good stuff. Not big in terms of flavors, but there is enough to satisfy here."
"apparently this is hard to find... this beer has introduced me to the Scotch Ale genre.... well done Sam Adams."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is good, a tiny bite from what seems like alcohol (even though the abv isn't there to back it up). Very good drinkable beer that is full flavored and good for a spring evening."
"This beer is really quite good. It has a wonderful aroma to it, and though it looks just average when poured out, it has a splendid taste and a rich, flavorful mouthfeel. I could easily drink a sixer of these with no problem. It's too bad they don't release this more widely, or I would be first in line to buy it in mass quantities."
"Chestnut brown in color with two fingers of creamy tan head, good retention and some lacing evident. Aroma has nuttiness and is dominated by a peaty smoke that obscures most of the malt notes. The flavor is dominated by peaty malts with plenty of smoke followed by some nuttiness and a light tart and bitter raisin finish Body is moderate, not as thick as a Wee Heavy would typically be, but this is a lighter version of the style so it works. Carbonation is high, but not excessively, so it avoids that pitfall. Interesting beer, actually comes across as a smoke ale more than anything. I would call this a smoked brown ale probably, fairly tasty though."
"I'm not sure how often the Boston Beer Company brews this one, but I'll be back for more whenever I can find it. This beer features a complex flavor which is excellently balanced and just put together very well. I didn't find it as overpowering as some other Scotch Ales that I've had, so its appeal is probably pretty universal. Get yourself one of these if you haven't already done so."
"Drinkability- I was sad to see this one gone, too bad it's fairly hard to come by."
"OK Scotch Ale, but Dirty Bastard has me absolutely spoiled."
"12oz bottle poured into a Boston Lager glass a crisp copper with a decent diminishing khaki head that leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is dominated by burnt caramel malts with slight cocoa. The taste is a nice blend of dark malts, burnt caramel, cocoa and dried fruits, a pleasant malt bomb. The beer is on the light side of medium with mild carbonation. This is an enjoyable Scotch Ale, one I could certainly see drinking again."
"Drinkability: Overall, another good offering from Sam Adams."
"Deep amber in color. Has a thick white head with good lacing and retention. The smell is of malt mostly with hints of a Scottish smokiness. The flavor is full of malt and lingers. This finishes with a roasted oak flavor. All around a great Scottish ale the hints of scotch and oak are subtle but apparent, however the malt is the star here."
"From reading other reviews I guess you can't get a 12 pack of this....that sucks....hey Jim Koch...hook it up"
"Poured into a shaker pint. Poured a clear red/amber with an off-white creamy head with great retention and excellent lacing. Slight smokey aroma. Smokey peat taste that is very enjoyable, hint of caramel sweetness and very slight bitter finish. Not relly like Scotch ales I've enjoyed at all but still very good. Sucks that you have to buy the lame Brewmasters collection to try it. SA does not need to add their lager or ale to these collections and the Noble Pils and Coastal Wheat have been heavily pushed on their own, wish SA had more diverse collections."
"Taste is similar to the smell, with the flavors somewhere in between a Scotch Ale and a Winter Warmer. Sweet malts blend with a nice biscuity, bready yeast flavor. Reminds me just a bit of AV Winter Solstice...even tasting a little bit of spice flavors. Hints of peat and smoke. Hop bitterness does not go completely unnoticed on the finish. Its a bit thin and somewhat astringent near the end...not smooth, but yet easy to drink. One of Sam Adams' better concoctions, I would buy a sixer of this every once in a while if they made it available that way."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is ok. Gets a little harsh as it warms."
"I really like this one. It pours a nice dark brown with just a hint of red to it. Smell is malt and smoke. Taste is also malt and smoke. To me it tastes a LOT like a porter. Mouth is fine and drinkability is good. I'd drink these all evening. Very nice beer."
"Drinkability: Nice, everyday Scotch Ale with an emphasis on peat smoked malt."
"D -- Drinkability is very good. The balance between the phenolic sharpness of the smoky malts & the sweetness of the biscuit malts is a nice change of pace from the usual all hops or all malts characters that are more prominent these days."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good as well"
"D Style wise its fairly smooth and not a show stopper. i would drink more than one, and price is good too. works nice in a variety pack but i wouldnt buy it six pack or more."
"When I poured this out of the bottle it had surprisingly little head. A dark beer that had a unique smokey smell, I found the appearance and smell to be only slightly above average. The taste was better than the smell, with a very rich and long lasting flavor. It was smooth to drink, and I enjoyed this beer, however it is not a beer that I could see myself drinking frequently, (which probably has to do with how unique of a taste this beer has.)"
"Value: Excellent in the mix 12 pack format!"
"D-a very drinkable beer but its stronger malt tastes may turn some people who are not a fan of the syle off of the beer overall but as a scotch ale fan i find this very refreshing and would gladly have a few of these in a row but probably not all night though"
"Poured into snifter. reddish caramel color with creamy off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Has a great smokey smell with some sweet malt and rich caramel. Very nice smell. Taste was fine but slightly watery I thought. You could taste the caramel, some wood notes, smoke, sweet malt and a kiss of hops but overall nothing really jumped out too much. Mouthfeel let me down. I felt it was a little too thin, a little on the watery side. Overall though a great beer. Good offering from Sam."
"Poured a dark amber with a frothy white head. Smell slightly smoky, malty and sweet with caramel and molasses. Taste was malty up front, going to sweet then smoky, slightly hoppy finish. Good beer very drinkable, nothing special, just a good beer. Southampton Scotch Ale is a more extreme interpretation of this style, much more interesting though this is more drinkable."
"D - Not a beer you'd want to play a drinking game with, but definitely a beer that you could session with while watching a sporting event."
"This is a solid brew, but definitely one to sip on. I would have been fine with half of one of these. Maybe it's just not a style I find all that quaffable. It could be the intensity of flavor from a beer that's of a modest abv. The finish seems to linger forever. It's good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. However, the Brewmaster's Collection is a pretty good value, and worth picking up for those who haven't."
"A little lighter than I'd like for the style, but drinkable."
"D - No problems drinking this all night."
"Unfortunately, it just seems a little tame compaired to many other examples of the style."
"I'm going to say right here that this is one of my favorite Sam Adams brews. One of their more challenging offerings and it reminds me of an Islay Scotch ...but not so much that I'd rather just have the scotch. I could drink these all day, and I'm still waiting for the brewer to produce a twelve pack of these exclusively."
"D: A solid Scotch Ale, which doesn't surprise me at all... SA usually does such a good job of representing a style."
"It was very easy for me to drink the 2 bottles I got in the mix pack."
"Overall: Try it. It's different, but I really enjoyed it."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass (of course). This beer is copper in color with excellent clarity. The beer produces a mega foamy head with generous amounts of lacing to it. The nose is good, extremely malty and sweet smelling. Smells of caramel with after-notes of toffee and a hint of smokeyness. The taste is good. A very malty brew, you can really taste the caramel and chocolate malts as well as malted barley. Slight smokeyness again (from what I gather is the Peat Malts) in the flavor followed only by a slight taste of the hops, but not very strong, hopes are more noticeable in the mouthfeel than the taste. The back of the bottle sums it up the best in two words ""Sweet & Smokey."" The mouthfeel is truely exceptional. For a beer with so many different malts, it has a well balanced smooth and creamy feel with just enough of a bitter finish. Not too heavy, not too light truly remarkable. Along with everything mentioned this beer has excellent drinkablility."
"I poured this beer from a bottle into a pint glass. This beer is amber colored with a one finger tan head that was gone quickly. This beer has minimal lacing. This beer barely had a smell but their was a hint of smokey malt. This beer has a light smokey malt and hop taste. The mouthful is crisp and carbonated. This is not a beer i would have again. I saw it had some good reviews but i don't understand. This beer did not have much flavor in my opinion. I wish I had something more to say about it but?"
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this. The sweetness is balanced nicely, and it doesn't become cloying like some malt-heavy beers. I enjoyed this. It's not my favorite style of beer, but I wouldn't mind experimenting more with the style."
"Overall I'm really impressed with this beer. It's much more adventurous and bold than I expected from Samuel Adams. Don't get me wrong, they make great beer, but I really like what they've done with this one."
"Pours a beautiful clear brown with lots of carbonation action and a nice white head that laces the glass. Aromas are very malty, almost roasty like a much darker beer. Taste is malt-forward and layered with a strong woodiness and toffee flavors. This beer is crammed with taste. I'm a big fan."
"D = This is a nice drinking beer that goes down smoothly and could easily be followed by a second bottle. I also would be happy to drink it again, but am not sure I would go to lengths to find it. I hadn't had in several years and I do like it better than I remember, but there are a lot of other beers in the same category that I would place before this one."
"D: this beer tastes good but is is kind of lacking in flavor and character"
"Drinkability is quite good for the style. This is a very good scotch ale, and an excellent beer in the Sam Adams lineup. For some reason it reminds me ever so slightly of Old Fezziwig, but better."
"Pretty good beer. It's clean, malty, and smooth but fails to really distinguish itself as a scotch ale, aside from the slight smokiness. Unique but not great."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Dark auburn red color. Very large white head. Good looking beer so far. Smelled a lot like peat smoke. First sip was mostly foam, and you can almost taste that scotch whisky flavor. The next sip more liquid, and the flavor was a bit more subdued. But that heavy smoky flavor was there throughout. My only wish was that this beer had a bit more body to it. That would make this brew fantastic. Very drinkable with a low abv and intense flavors. One of the more underrated and unknown SA beers on the market."
"My perfect pour glass was filled with is brew the color of very dark copper topped with a finger of foamy white head but had little carbonation. The aroma was malty with a touch of cinnamon. The taste of malt and caramel was a nice blend, with a spicy touch to it. It was rather smooth and finished with much enjoyment."
"It has a dark red-amber color with a beige head that dies to a collar relatively fast. Aroma is a combination of tea and bread/malts. Taste is similar to semi-sweet tea. There is some caramel in there, some smokeyness, malts, and hoppy finish. Decent thickness, not too much carbonation. I would definitely buy a pack of this alone."
"D: A good Scottish Ale is one of my favorite styles. SA Scotch Ale is a nice take on one."
"An interesting beer. I think it's starting to fade, but time has done some interesting things to the nose and flavor profile."
"A solid ale with a good amount of character. Not overly strong and a nice session beer."
"Overall a very tasty malt driven ale."
"I can drink again and again. Doesn't weigh me down."
"Pours a deep amber with less than a finger head that dissolves fairly fast. After a couple sips there is barely a translucent film across the top of the beer. Despite the lack of the head, it leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Nose has a bit of malty sweetness, very pleasant. Also can smell hints of smoke and maybe something to the effect of Pete. Taking a sip you can taste a bit of smokiness as well and a slight bit of hop bitterness in the very crisp finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light and carbination is perfect. One delicious brew that is quite easy to drink."
"D - Really good beer. SA makes some great looking beers that taste great too."
"Overall, I was a bit put off the the taste. I think this beer has the potential for being very good if the metal component weren't so overwhelming. I will try this again another year and see if this reduces."
"Pours a very light brown color with an one and a half finger off white head to it. There is decent lacing left behind. The smell is of caramel malt and smokey earthy malts at the back end. The taste is of smokey malt, with caramel and chocolate notes being faint to round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and moderately carbonated. Overall the drinkablity is good, the ABV is average so it doesn't detract from the drinkability."
"Drinkability- My favorite from the Brewmaster's Pack. A solid selection for six packs in the future."
"It's alright, but really doesn't come close to some other Scotch Ales I've had."
"Wow. A new bar-raiser for Sam Adams. This is to them what Black Forest Lager is to Saranac for me - a singularly fantastic beer that rises above their normal lineup by a good bit."
"Very drinkable. The ABV is under control. I'm not much on the style, and had low expectations going in to the one. It might be the most drinkable Scotch Ale I have ever had."
"Drinkability: This very complex beer is meant for sipping and basking in the brilliance of this great beer. It is a shame that they only sell it in a 12 bottle multi-pack."
"Drinks very well, body is a little lighter than some scotch ales, but it drinks solidly."
"Drinkability: Ok beer. I would drink it again but it is not a staple for me"
"Dark amber/brown in color. Little to no head. No discernable nose. Clean attack and finish with a mild malt flavor. The mouthfeel of creaminess is tempered by a slight bite. This beer is pretty pedestrian for its type, but its a convenient way for folks to try the type since it comes in the sampler packs offered by Samuel Adams. There are better versions of the style and worse versions out there."
"At less than 6% abv, it's almost sessionable. Would without question be a staple in my fridge if it were available in sixers."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability- Scotch ales are among the best drinkers in my opinion, and Sam Adams' is no exception."
"It is a mild take on the style, but a good one."
"I don't have an incredible wealth of knowledge involving scotch ales so I hesitate to be too harsh. I'll try a few more and perhaps reevaluate."
"Notes: I had to buy a whole pack to get just two of these but it was worth it. This is one of Sam Adams best brews. We should all email them to see if we can get this to come back fulltime."
"very drinkable if you like this sort of beer."
"It's a decent beer, but it's not something I would go out of my way to find. If offerred one, I certainly wouldn't refuse."
"Smooth and, drinkable with a pronounced dry finish."
"Poured from the bottle a dark reddish-brown with a fast-fading finger of brown head. Both smell and taste contain a lightly spicy malt flavor and a little caramel sweetness, with the taste having a stronger, lasting spice. The taste reminded me a bit of SA's Holiday Porter. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for me, and leaves the mouth a little sticky. All around, a very average but drinkable scotch ale that I enjoyed, but won't necessarily seek out in the future."
"Drinks alright. Could probably only have a couple in a night."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and smooth but does have an extra amount of carbonation. Is really easy going down and is one of the better beers brewed by Samuel Adams and is quite tasty."
"D - Good interpretation of the scotch style that is quite drinkable for its flavor. I enjoy this beer."
"My first Scotch style ale, and it's got me intrigued. I'd probably never want to drink six of these even in the time period of a few months, but the two that came in the mixed 12 pack are more than manageable."
"Glad to finally try this beer."
"Clear coppery dark amber with a fluffy eggshell cap of foam. Lots of lacing, mostly chunky-style, with good head retention. Malty aroma, notes of caramel and sugary sweetness, plus the added bonus of well-balanced peat and smoke character. I certainly didn't expect that! Low bitterness with caramel and malt sweetness that didn't end up cloying. Peat was more subdued in the flavour, but made its presence known in the finish. Medium bodied with decent texture, average carbonation. Easy drinking for a beer with some peat character. A pleasant surprise, but seems more of a scottish than scotch ale to me."
"Feel is velvety smooth and carbonation is adequate. Very drinkable and just a really great beer."
"Overall: a perfect drinker right here."
"D: The more I drink it, the more I enjoy it. This beer opens up really well. I'da wanted a bit more on the body, but the amalgam of flavors is riveting."
"D- Pretty pleasant beer that goes down nicely."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is good. I would drink this beer again."
"D - I could see myself having a few of these without a problem .. but not all night. An enjoyable brew none the less"
"Overall this is another staple from Sam Adams. Very easy drinking beer with a lot of flavor."
"D: The pungent and almost sour tastes combined with breadiness and relatively low sweetness don't help here. It also tastes higher than its 5.4% alcohol."
"taste is not near as 'burnt' or peaty as i remember...which i 'loved' then, but like even better in that it's not so 'bold' as expected. seems more balanced. actually, sweeter than i remember, but again, love that it is a sweetness i don't mind. it is fairly counterbalanced by some other bite i can't place. neither thick nor watery, it's got a nice mouthfeel, a bit creamy, but that carbonation, again, provides a nice counterbalance. again, not my favorite style of beer at all. but it's quite good and very drinkable. not a session brew...i'd drink two of these alone or maybe three with a grinder or pizza or just about anything crunchy, salty, spicey. think i'll get out some of that cheddar/horseradish pub cheese tub out and dip pretzels. i think it will be a good blend with the Scotch Ale."
"I would write more about this brew but I think my two sentences sum things up. It is a decent brew that is a scotch ale. The problem is that it tastes like a watered down scotch ale. If you don't like bold brews, you'll probably love this version of scotch ale."
"overall drinkability is good and sessionable.. one of my favorites of the sam adams line, sad that it's only seasonal, but hey"
"Smell is of malts and slightly smoky notes. Taste follows through. Not overwhelmingly forward, but rather a pleasant subtlety that would lend this heavier brew great to a hearty meal. Bubbles are balanced and play with the bear and not against the palate forming a nice smooth finish with minimal aftertaste."
"Easily drinkable. The malt flavors stand out in this one. Good balance. Another solid offering from Samuel Adams, but there are better Scotch Ales out there."
"D: Very drinkable version of a scotch ale. More flavor would help things along a bit, but it's still a decent brew. Definitely one of the better beers produced by BBC."
"A very good session scotch ale. Good overall flavor with some American bitterness to boot. Not as full flavored as traditional scotch ales, but i could easily drink six of these in a session."
"Nice creamy texture. Smooth carbonation. Nice example."
"Pouring and oh oh, foaming over! Slurp up some frothy head, mmm smoky. Does this beer have smoked malt? I just read the neck label, it must be the special peat malt which was used. It is delicious. It certainly tastes like it, well the head anyway. Deep amber color with foamy, soft, offwhite head. Very nice. Smooth aroma, some sweetness, peatiness! Great flavor. Like I said smoky and peaty. Great malts. Smooth and luscious mouthfeel. This is one of my favorite Sam Adams. They seem to make, for me, flops or homeruns. This is a homerun."
"I guess this is representative of the style, but not something I like. Only other beer of this style I have tried was old chub, and only tried it once years ago, havn't been able to bring myself to try a whole one yet. Maybe this style is great to some people, but not to me. Could be an aqquired taste I guess. The woody aftertaste just turns me away."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the clear brownish copper brew. Head recedes at fast clip, with average lacing. Aroma is malty, slightly smoky. Taste follows along, but I find myself wanting to use ""slightly"" over and over. Slightly sweet to start, slightly smoky, slightly hoppy at the close. Wish it wouldn't be so nondescript. Mouthfeel and drinkability continue the trend of being pretty good. This is not something that I'd buy the 12-pack for, but it holds its own."
"Drink ability is great. It goes down smooth, is only slightly thick, and the alcohol isn't even noticeable. It was 35 degrees here when I had this but I will get it again as soon as it is warm out. Downside I'd that the inky way to get it is in samper pack"
"Lot of malt flavor with caramel notes. Has a fairly strong roasted flavor and an almost wine-like warming at the end. Light dose of hops. Finishes very dry."
"Overall, one of my all time favorite beers. I'll recommend it to anyone. I wish I could get this stuff by the case :/"
"It is not a bad beer, and I will drink one more bottle (since it was in the 12 pack), but won't seek it out again."
"Smell is rich with smoky, peaty malts and reminds me of a bock beer in a sense, given the sweet nose. Hoppy sweet when agitated. Like many Sam beers, I don't pick up any hops until mid glass when I can give it a good spin, and even then the hop profile is inconsistant. Taste follows with a simple sweetness and a moderate carbonation level. Light in flavor, light in ABV yet a bit too syrupy. Does offer a bit more smoke on the finish which supports the feel a bit, but limits the drink. A decent offering from Sam but nothing special."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, but there is a bit too much carbonation."
"D- Excellent! My personal favorite SA offering, it should be a crime that they don't offer this in 6/12 packs. Plenty of flavor but not overwhelming like some other Scotch ales I've had."
"A bit smoother and flavorful than some of my other favored scotch ales. Perhaps not as drinkable as Olde Burnside Ten Penny and not as authentic as Belhaven, but very tasty and a brew Sam Adams would be wise to brew for 6 and 12-packs."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy this beer. Flavors are clean and nothing is overpowering. A good beer to introduce drinkers to the component of smoke in beer."
"Over all very tasty. Reminds me of a lighter, smokier doppelbock. Very drink able, solid beer from Sam adams"
"Pours a clear brown color, off-white head, big bubbles, good lacing, somewhat lasting. Very malty aroma, some sweet, light fruit like green grapes, and some dark fruit like plums. Malty sweet taste, sweet nutty aftertaste, somewhat bitter. Interesting, and good flavor. Somewhat smokey flavor. Surprisingly good. Nice session beer."
"MF&D - Medium mouthfeel and good drinkability. Once again Sam Adams has produced a nice brew and decided to only include it in sampler packs."
"D= pretty good. I will get tired of the smoke eventually but for now it's great. It reminds me of a good BBQ. Great beer."
"Maybe I'm just not a scotch ale person, but I didn't like this beer. Color started off nice, reddish brown pour. Smoky, peat moss kind of smell. The barrel aging taste that comes through with the malt was largely unsatisfying - like someone had spilled some bourbon in my beer. For me, the drinkability wasn't there - I can see sampling this one in a 2 oz. taster to appreciate the style, but not more than that."
"Not a bad beer, just not a very good one either. I hope Sam Adams keeps this one going though, because I do have a craving for one every once in awhile."
"Kudos Samuel Adams. You did it again."
"Overall - Good balance. This beer is a good choice to sip and enjoy."
"A smoky like brew. This is a big brew dominated by malt flavors and aromas, rich and full bodied, slightly sweet. This challenging beer is not for everyone. A high original gravity, hop bitterness, and peat smoke character yield a robust and a smooth balanced ale, for the consumer of rich and complex ales. I really like this one."
"Definitely one of my favored Sam Adams selections, although I don't know it is not more readily available on draught here in Boston! Regardless, this ale pours a good body full of amber-dark brown hues with a fluffy full head. The aroma is a lovely roasted malt with bread & honey. Smooth & mild yet with a more complex floral malt than what you would expect. Although it lacks a smokiness that you might expect, there is a hint of scotch in the nose, which brings out more. Might I have another?"
"Pours a deep amber with moderate light brown head. Strong initial taste, smooth finish throughout. Definite malt, yeast influence; smoke flavor very evident. Kind of smells like the bottom of a bag of BBQ potato chips! Head dimishes to thin coat, good lacing through finish. My first experience with a Scotch Ale (part of SA Variety Pack). Enjoyable beer, now I am going to enjoy the 2nd one - Cheers!"
"Taste: Nice balance of malts and hops. Some smokey character as well."
"poured into a 24oz mug, and it was beautiful. a dark beer with a wonderful aroma of heavy scents of barley and hops. tastes even better, with an almost burnt aftertaste (which I love). it is a heavy dark beer, while not incredibly filling. would definitely buy again and again."

"Samuel Adams Scotch Ale from Boston Beer Company pours a brown reddish color with an off white head. The smell is of malty caramel and maybe a touch of vanilla. The sweet malt really comes through in the first sip. This beer starts sweet and finishes dryly with some earthy flavors such as smoke, wood, and tobacco. A well made beer that I wish was more readily available to me. I've only seen it in the 12 and 24 pack Brewmasters Collection here in the Alabama jungle. Brew on, Patriot, brew on!"
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium with a medium finish. This beer is okay for a scotch ale. I was hoping for more a malt in the beer, but hey it is a Samuel Adams."
"Drinkable"
"The aroma prepares you for something different than what you get in the taste making for a very interesting beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey brown color with a small yet dense head which dissipates into a slight cap. The aroma is of light roasted malt, some grape wine notes, perhaps a touch of butter, not much of, if at all, peat or smoke presense. The taste is of a nice malt base, not too thick or roasted. Definitely pick up on the smoke/peat flavors, not too powerful but noticable. Some tea like hop bitterness in the end. The feel is moderate, a little chewy but is cut by the active carbonation, finishes with a slightly dry/astringent bitterness. Perhaps a touch thin for the style. While the feel may be a touch thin, it leads to some good drinkability. Not very heavy in the feel or in the smoke flavor, which would allow you to drink more than 2 if that was available."
" ~ I'm very disappointed that I only have one. I wish I had at least a six pack."
"D-A very drinkable one, as it's flavor is pleasant and it's goes down easy."
"I finished one and immediately cracked open the other. Damn them for only giving me 2."
"Solid, puffy, beige head on a quite dark nut-brown colored beer. Both odor and character is reminiscent of a British Pub Ale, but a nice caramel flavor and sweetness contribute to an agreeable offset for my Western palette. A hearty drink; a nice, well-balanced entry beer into the beer world of the British Isles."
"I am revising this review. I tried this two years ago and was not a big fan but my taste have been refined (smile) since then I would say that I do like this. I personally like SA's Boston Ale more but this is pretty good. I would certainly drink this again and Sam Adams proves again they have easy to get and yet tasty beer."
"Drinkability: One of the better Sam Adam's brews, in my opinion, and one I was pretty surprised and pleased with, actually. They pretty much nailed the style spot on, and though nothing here is grounbreaking or mindblowingly awesome, it's a solid all-around beer - tasty, low in alcohol, aromatic, nice to look at it. Recommended."
"Good robust red ale that pours with a good finger width head then reduces to good keeping lacing. Great taste of a scotch and oak barrel flavor malted ale. Low hops tasting as it just leaves a aftertaste of one that is associated with a good quality scotch."
"D= Good drinkability exellent mix of flavors that leads to a high level of enjoyment"
"D= This is a damn good Scottish ale and I have to admit I was surprised by that. Very drinkable, very sessionable."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but a little watery for the style. Robust flavors like smoke need a burly body to match, and this beer doesn't have it. Definitely more wee than heavy. Other than that, this beer is tasty, and clearly one of Sam Adams' best."
"When it comes to Scotch Ale, it would have been great if Mr. Koch had gone the 'craft beer' route rather than the 'appeal to the widest range of beer drinkers' route. If this stuff was easier to find, I might be tempted to buy a sixer now and again. Just for a change of pace."
"D - This is a pretty good scotch ale. The flavor really improved as it warmed."
"D - this beer is good and would go well with a cigar or some smoked meat. Like I said earlier, this is almost too smoky to be a scotch ale, but it is good nonetheless."
"Overall, I thought the beer was pretty good. I never had a scotch ale before and I guess I just expected a little more. You should definitely let this beer sit for a little bit to allow the flavors to come out. It was a nice change of pace from the IPAs that I have been hooked on."
"Now we shall get into the meat and potatoes of the review...the taste. Who wants smoked beef jerky? Or perhaps a cigar? Those sound good with this beer, the smokey flavor is big. There's a subtle fruitness buried in the smoke. Nope, this is not what I was expecting...I was expecting a malt bomb. But it's all good."
"This is one of the first Scotch Ales I have ever tried so I wasn't sure what to expect. The smoky flavor was hard to get used to but it kinda grew on me and felt it added a good touch of flavor to the beer. Other than that it tasted a little bland but still very much drinkable. This led me to try many other scotch ales."
"D: Good, not too heavy on the palate."
"Beer #2 from the mixed 12 pack. I've had most of these Sam Adams brews before but didn't review them. The Scotch Ale is one of my favorites from the brewery. Nice sweetness and smoke and not too heavy on the palate."
"Nice light creaminess to this one and a low carbonation makes this a very nice beer."
"Not a Skullsplitter or a Founders but a good solid Scotch ale nonetheless."
" Very good. I haven't had too many Scotch Ales but this one is great. Very smooth and drinkable. Don't hesitate to pick this up."
"D: Very drinkable beer, I really finished it and wished I had more, very good beer."
"I hope to find it in cases or six packs, but some of the posts here lead me to believe that might not be possible!"
"Feel is silky with carbonation to match, easy to drink but only two at a time."
"D- A very good, very drinkable beer from Sam Adams. This is one of my favorites by them, I just wish it was easier to find it in a sixer."
"This beer poured a beautiful garnet color with a light tan head. Perfect for the style. Smell is mostly malts and again suits the style well. The taste is where I can't quite figure out what is going on, interesting, but all the flavours don't seem to balance out. There is a toasted bitterness I enjoy, but it's not offset by the maltiness of the brew. The lingering aftertaste of this brew is very good. Bitter, peaty and very nice. I wish I could find a 6 of this, I'm going to buy it again just to figure it out."
"D: I liked this beer a lot, if you want a beer that tastes like whisky go for it, good for a couple of pints, but the character and strength of the flavour would make it difficult to session."
"D- For me, this is probably one of the most drinkable of Sam Adams' releases."
"Very good overall. Doesn't touch Belhaven Wee Heavy in my view, but very good still."
"D: A lot of complexity here, definitely a lot of interesting flavors interacting. I like this one a lot. Something to discover with each sip, but certainly not inaccessible by any means."
"Had this brew the other morning (23Sep08) with bacon and eggs...Top shelf with that combination and only strengthens my belief that this is a great ""dinner"" beer."
"mouthfeel is great on this. very smooth. and easy drink. a nice beer all round. well played sam."
"This is my favorite so far in the Sam Adams catalog. Wasn't expecting much and was very pleasantly surprised."
"6/17/2004. The only other Scotch Ale I've had before this one was the McEwan's and I hated it, so I came in thinking I'd hate this one too. I was pleasantly surprised. A nice deep amber appearance to it topped with a nice head that left a great amount of lacing. A smooth, rich, smoked malt taste to it is the best way I can describe it. Almost like a combination of their Boston Ale and a real good Brown Ale. I may be way off but that's what it tasted like to me. It's a different taste, but that's not a bad thing as I really enjoyed this."
"overall, one of the most enjoyable from the Sam Adams lineup, a shame that it is not produced for sale other than in the Brewmaster's mix, I wold buy it on its own regularly."
"Scotch Ale feels and drinks just great."
"This is tasty, rich and full bodied a nice treat from the sampler. Heavy aroma very malty and somewhat bitter with a good hearty breadiness. Dirty copper pour good light tan head and ample lacing. Creamy on the palate with a nice smooth finish. Flavor is grand full of thick malts with well balanced hops. There is a real nice smoky taste that sets this beer apart. As I sip I can also detect the smoke in the aroma. Every once in a while Sammy breaks through with another great recipe, here's one of them."
"D: Good flavor but a bit astringent. Overall an easy drinking scotch ale. Pairs well with chili."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable one of the best in the Sam Adams line."
"Good scotch taste on this beer, without it being overly harsh or overdone. I am not a big fan of the style, but I think it's a solid example for what a scotch ale should taste like."
"This beer poured a dark brown with some reddish tint. The smell is fairly sweet with some malt and perhaps some caramel. The taste starts off with some rich malt with some very candylike butterscotch and caramel. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with a small amount of carbonation and a a decent thickness. This beer might be difficult to pair with some foods, but isn't a horrible brew to grab to cool down and relax."
"overall, this is good but i dont see myself buying it again"
"Beautiful amber color. nice full head lacing on glass. Sweet tones on first check then nice subtle smokey aroma. Wonderful full flavor sits on you palette. Not a great choice for a hot summer day, geat for cooking. (use as a marinade for BBQ)"
"D - An excellent mild, sweet beer to spend an evening with."
"Pours out a orangish ruby color with an OK head. Looks alright. The aroma is bready and smoky with hints of dark fruit. The taste has similar flavors, is a little boozy, and seems earthy. Quite sweet, but with a strong bitter finish. It's a little soapy, but with decent thickness in the mouth. As do many Sam Adams offerings, it went down well, but there are certainly better scotch ales out there."
"Recommended..."
"Pours a deep bronze color with a large head that slowly dissipates into a nice lacing. Nice smokey smell with a medium-to-full body. Nice full flavor that lingers on the palette nicely. This is one of my favorite Sam Adams brews - goes great with grilling and BBQ'ed food."
"A nice amber color lies beneath a thin tan head. The nose has some smokey malts behind some really sweet caramel or toffee. The taste has better balance with a big malt structure hiding the sweetness fairly well. A medium body is a bit cloying. Not a bad Scotch ale, just a bit out of balance."
"Aftertaste is peppery with bits of toffee and caramel. This finishes lots of residual sweetness and slightly bitter."
"Not really my taste, but I can enjoy the quality of a good beer."
"This is a great scotch ale and worth trying if you're into the style."
"Nice brew overall."
"Drinkability: I had two in amixed 12 pack, which is the only way I think I have seen this for sale (at least around here). I want more. I would really enjoy to just sit back an consume a six pack of this one evening."
"Got this along with 6 other brands in a variety pack from costco. This one had a red/brown color with a decent head. I was expecting a unique taste but I got a taste that was similar to some Canadian brews I've had. The smell was a fruity smell with some sugary lacing. This is a good brew and I look forward to the rest of the pack."
"Thick and a bit oily. Sticks to the mouth. Not a choker but sticky and heavy. Quite nice. It's really a pleasant beer. Bursting with sweet/smoky flavors. Repeats are most welcome."
"M/D: Slightly bitter definitely not sweet and the glue taste kinda hurts the mouthfeel. The drinkability is ok not my favorite to enjoy. I have definitely had better scotch ales and probably will not pick this one up again."
"Best before November, notched on the label. Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Translucent amber in appearance with reddish-brown highlights. Luscious off-white head was barely contained in the glass (went from the stripe surrounding the bowl up to the lip of the glass) leaving behind lots sticky white lacing. Good head retention eventually dissipated into a thin consistent layer of foam. Fair amount of lacing with decent adhesion during the tasting. Lots of sweet malt (perhaps a hint of caramel) in the nose as well as a subtle smoky quality. Flavors are consistent with the nose; however, sweetness is less pronounced and a nice earthy-peaty flavor at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation to round out some of the flavors. Decent drinkability for the style, although I personally wouldn't have more than two in a session."
"Sam Adams Scotch Ale has the coolest of the Sam Adams labels because of the plaid. Other than that, the beer pours a very nice, dark amber with a 1-finger off-white head. It smells of sweet chocolate maltiness and a bit of grassy hops. The taste hits hard with smoked flavor and roasted, grainy chocolate. This is followed by a bit of bitterness and astringency. I think I also detected some alcohol flavor in there. The mouthfeel is very nice and full-bodied. Though not real high in alcohol, the richness and somewhat harsh graininess make this closer to a sipping beer than I would have expected."
"Got this one out of a friend's fridge. Pours a nice looking smooth dark amber color with a mild off-white head. Solid lacing. Nose is fairly mild for the style, mostly toffee malt with a hit of hops too. Some oak in there. Taste is likewise, although the oak sort of mutates into a fairly untasty bacon flavor. A fair bit of bitter hops melding with oddly not-sweet roasted malt. Really not a very good flavor. Feel is solid, no complaints. Overall though, the flavor just didn't do it for me. Not gonna recommend this one...one of the worst Sam Adams I've tried so far."
"Drinkability- 5.4% is rather lower for a scotch ale, making this unique offering, a bit more sessionable."
"D- A very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. Very, very smooth and drinkable. I could drink a number of these. Overall, this is an excellent offering from Sam Adams. I wish they sold it in six packs. Definitely recommended."
"This is now my second favorite behind the Irish Red... Now why don't they offer this in six packs???"
"I could drink a couple of these at a time, more of an indoor or cooler weather drink."
"great thick creamy head, layered lacing upon dissipation. tanned brown orange bark in color. too malty. yes the peat is present and welcome, but too malty sweet. the smokiness is offset too harshly with the sweet maltiness which leads to a bloody character in the taste. it's a good beer all in all...but for what their intent was, it didn't seem to come out as eloquently as probably desired. Bonus points for using good peat to smoke the malts. i'll stick to my laphroaig, ardbeg, and lagavulin if i want any good peat/smoke notes in a drink."
"As a afternote, the warmer this beer gets the smokier it gets. More of a liquid smoke saltiness, and not a natural smokiness."
"D: A very nice beer and a nice change of pace. Not quite as ""big"" as a smoked porter but feels similar. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall I really liked this beer and may seek it out in sixers as I wonder how it would sit for awhile."
"Drinkability: While there are some nice elements, there are just a few too many distractions and flaws to this as a top tier Scottish"
"Pours a hazy, dark amber color with ruby tones and just a whisper of off-white head. Aromas are rich and malty, some slight fruity raisin like notes, toffee, chocolate, and a touch of peat. On the palate, malty sweetness fills the mouth but it is backed up my plenty of hops, perhaps more than necessary. A bit of toffee and caramel flavor comes through, but not as much as there should be. The finish is dry and exudes that spicy, smoky peat character. The smoke is certainly balanced and the amount I think is great. Overall, there's some lack of malt and caramelization, but it is a decent Scottish."
"Drinkability - always happy to enjoy a few of these."
"Notes: This malt bomb is amazing so smokey. It should have Smokey the bear somewhere on the label. It's such a perfect fall and winter beer. I wish this one would return to at least six pack form that would be incredible. Cheers"
"D - At only 5.4% ABV, this is one of the ""lightest"" Scotch Ales I've had... but that's what makes it supremely drinkable -- especially since not a wisp of style was lost by keeping the ABV low. I could drink this all night long without worry that I'm going to get supremely hammered as I would if I were drinking most other Scotch Ales. Wonderful, and tragic that I believe this beer can't be bought in 6-packs anymore; only in the Brewmaster's Collection 12-packs."
"Shame I can't buy a 6 pack."
"My only complaint is the availabilty. I wish this beer were released all year round, or at least in carriers by itself instead of only 2 in the Brewmaster 12-pack (sidenote: the rest of the 12 pack is also very good!)"
"Taste is malty up-front with a buttery smooth feel to it, a bitterness lingers in the back, rich but not overly syrupy."
"Appearance hazy brown with a three finger tan head that stuck around quite well. Smell malt fruit sweetness and some smoke. Taste some smoke up front malt seetness followed by a nutty dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel mediem body and mediem carbonation. Drinkability not bad a good representation of the style its a good beer for a cold winter evening like this one just don't serve to cold."
"D - This is a decent Scottish ale, not really strong enough to be considered an accepted 'Scotch ale'. It drinks well enough; however, I think it could use more subtly in the smoked peat flavor. Nonetheless, it's a good American version of the style, even if my tastes lean towards the examples from Scotland."
"D - A very drinkable Scotch ale and with a nice low ABV could session on this all night"
"drinkability - Average. An ok beer, nothing more."
"D- Decent session beer. Not my fav Sam beer."
"D - Very drinkable in the right session. Perhaps with a steak or BBQ dish. Recommended."
"A bulky, bland tasting 'Scotch Ale' that is really hurt by the alcohol presence. Some poor flavors, lack of balance, and little resemblance to the style."
"Pours a brown-copper color with a foamy white head. Aroma is quite malty. Taste can best be described a buttery (Diacetyl?), and quite sweet, with very little presence of hops. Easy drinking, with a dry and slightly smoky aftertaste. A pleasant addition to the Sam Adams 12-pack."
"It's not as full-bodied as I'm used to for a Scotch but the dry finish is a definite plus. For all it's deficiencies, this is nevertheless a highly drinkable beer and one that doesn't overwhelm the taste buds so much that a few more wouldn't be welcome."
"Solid. Solid. Solid. There's really nothing more to say except ""solid""."
"Pours a deep burnished copper with a nice, creamy light tan head with awesome stickiness and retention, leaving plenty of lacing. Aesthetically an unusually pleasing brew. The smell is mostly sweet malts, as is to be expected. The taste is a pleasant malty sweetness -- cookie and toffee notes, a hint of diacetyl butteriness and a nice little hoppy bite in the finish. Medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. I could definitely session this. Very enjoyable -- I'm a big Belhaven fan, and this compares favorably. Very solid version of the style. I wouldn't call it a Wee Heavy -- it's not that strong, but it's definitely a very good Scotch Ale."
"D - A little too sweet for me personally to drink a ton of them. Great for a sitting though and pairs well with a lot of foods."
"d - Would drink this any time, any where. If sold in a sixer would no doubt be near the top of my list but will be content as long as I can continue to find the Brewmaster 12 pack."
"d - Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. The flavor is interesting and well balanced. This is one of my favorite sam adams. It's a shame you have to buy a 12-pack to get two of these."
"I enjoyed this brew. The carbonation in this beverage is noteworthy - the abundance of which contributed to the foamy head. With so many malts and hops combined so skillfully, I am looking foreword to ""sampling"" this again."
"i dont recomend this, im sure a scottish person would be insulted by this horrible brew."
"The mouthfeel leaves a wee bit of bitterness too much for this reviewer, detracting somewhat from my final ratings. Yet all in all, this is tasty and worth grabbing. There is a nice complexity that, hopefully, a more skilled reviewer can unravel, and it finishes fairly well despite the accumulating bitterness. Good show."
"M: Round, almost creamy... a bit of a butter oiliness to it through the finish. Quite easy to take a nice big mouthful, swish it around and swallow it all back. One of the better choices from the selection of Adams brews I've had."
"This is definitely a ""sometimes love, sometimes hate"" kind of beer. When in the right mood, it would hit the spot, whilst at other times it would be tough to even finish the pint. I call this ""campfire beer"" -- smoky and peaty in both taste and finish. It's a brilliant dark red color and exhibits a bready, soy-like nose. But that complex smoky/peatiness is what really defines this one. One of the better Sam's, but make sure you work yourself up for the commitment."
"D - In my opinion, this beer emphasizes roast character a little too much for a scotch ale, but otherwise it is a reasonable interpretation of the style. The only issue that interferes with its drinkability is a strange, soapy note that fades in and out of the finish."
"D- It is a ok Scottish Ale but I would never call it a Wee Heavy. I probably won't bother to get it again."
"D-very flavorful and thick keeps the drinkability to a minimum for me,but all in all a very enjoyable brew"
"Beatiful rich amber color with a admirablelight tan head that never seems to disipate till its all gone. Moderate lacing all the way down the glass. Great aromas of malty butterscotchiness and notes of caramel, a little sweet in the nose. Tastes smooth and balenced with both sweetness and twanginess. A bit milder than McEwans offering, watered down in comparision, but this is not exactly a bad thing as it adds to the ease of drinkability. Strong maltiness upfront that front that fades to a smooth buttery and creamy finish, quite pleasent. As mentioned feels a little watery in the mouth and a bit slipery. Quite a drinkable brew all in all and would definately be something to look forward to in the brewmasters collection."
"D--One of the better scotch ales out there. I would love to have this on tap. Winter bbq beer...or super bowl chili beer."
"Excellent."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. The balance between the malty taste and the smoky aftertaste makes it a great beer to drink."
"Overall, a surprinsgly good beer from SA. I did not expect this one to be anything like it was and actually thought it would be kind of bland. Rather complex and comes through strong on its own. A beer I would definitely look for again especially because I don't find too many of this style. One of the better beers that I've ever had from SA and would make me consider buying the Brewmaster's collection for it if I had a craving."
"Just got two bottles in the 2007 Brewmaster collection (the one with the Irish Red that I have yet to try). Poured one into a pint glass and it had very little head, natch, and a dark mahogany color with small lace patches left on glass. This label doesnt say triple malt like the picture on this site, but they are there. Smell is rather malty, with some caramel picked up  I didnt pick up much else. You can taste the roasted malt immediately, and it gives this rather full-bodied ale (it doesnt look like a traditional heavy ale) a mildly dry backbite. I think the malts overpower this ale a tad, but you can still pick up some earthy tones. I dont know; I cant put my finger on it but this is one of those instances where I am not thoroughly impressed w/ a beer, yet I cant really find anything negative to point out. I will probably cellar the other brew and I would recommend this, yet there is a part of me that is probably being pessimistic because it isnt a real Scottish Ale."
"drinkability - Very good, nice balance of caramels and roasted malts here."
"This is a very balanced and drinkable scotch ale. It is pretty good but doesn't blow me away."
"The ale is a clear, dark brown capped with a rocky, tan head that falls to a light covering and leaves heavy sheeting and semi-rings as it descends. The nose is nearly all sweet malts, some toffee and notes of banana esters. Not too heavy or dark in the nose. The taste is full of similar malty sweetness with lots of caramel, light toffee. The fruity notes are absent from the taste, and the smokiness comes through distinctly, but not unbalanced. Bitters are very low and more of a bite comes from medium levels of carbonation. Mid-high mouthfeel. Slightly sweet and smokey aftertaste with lingering roasted notes. Alcohol is noticeable in the mouth as light tingling on the tongue, but not in the nose. Quite smooth and drinkable."
"This Scotch ale has a nice malt complexity with a subtle smokiness. It's a shame that it is only available in the variety pack, as I would have enjoyed having more than two of them in my fridge."
"D- very tasty and impressive scotch ale, sessions limited by abv%, hands down of of the best brews under the sam adams label"
"Dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head that didn't last, but nice lacing. This beer has a very earthy smell, with hints of smokiness. I think of a mossy damp field when getting a whiff of this beer. The taste matches the smell. This is a very earthy flavored beer with a strong smoky flavor. The beer has moderate carbonation and is fuller in body. There is a malty after taste once you break through the overwhelming initial hit of must. This was one of 6 in a Samuel Adams variety pack. I don't think I would buy it on its own. Not my pint of beer, but as all beer I am glad I tried it."
"Nice reddish brown color. Like a wet Irish setter. Not much head. good lacing. Smells like the cork from a bottle of good scotch along with hoppyness and smokey malt. A little bit of a sweet smell and a bitter and sweet taste. Kind of rich and heavy. Good beer but I wouldn't want to drink too many of these. This is a good ""two beers before bed"" kind of beer."
"Sams Scotch Ale pours a light cola color with a malty frothy head. Interestingly there is a profound Bamberg beechwood smokiness in the flavor profile of this brew, whats interesting is that this smokiness is barely perceptible in the nose! In the mouth are flavors of well-roasted malts, beechwood smoke, and sweet malts. Perhaps lacking the foundation and body of some of the top notch Scotch Ales, this version makes up for this departure by providing us with uber drinkability and a very enticing flavor profile from this original Scotch Rauchbier Ale. I would imagine this brew would firmly plant a smile on those who enjoy this type of brew, as I do.."
"The flavor is dominated by the taste of roasted malt. A little smoke and hop bitterness leaves this a very balanced brew. It feels medium bodied and nicely carbonated. A beer that probably could be helped by a slightly higher ABV. I think this is Sam Adams most impressive beer. I had the lowest expectations for this beer and I am pleasantly surprised."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability  Very good drinkability, very smooth and an easy drink. The only thing lacking in my opinion was maybe a bit more ABV, which might have helped it be a little bit 'warmer'. A great beer besides though."
"A very drinkable brew, and one of my favorites from Sam. A complex malt profile coupled with a bit of hop finish makes this a keeper."
"A dark, reddish brown is what poured out. Wow, that smell was strong. A strong presence was immediately felt. The taste, was even more powerful. Bold and malty. The drink sweetly and warmly stays on the tongue but this drink is definitely not for the faint of heart."
"The drinkability on this one is great, almost perfect."
"the taste does shine through, it has an almost smoky flavor to it with heavy malts and a not too penetrating aggressiveness. I would recommend this beer, its a good style representation."
"# 3 out of the sampler 12 was the scotch ale, it poured a deep reddish hue w/ a slight pinkish head some lacing; nice malty aroma w/ some faint hop undertones; a good malt profile some hop flavor present; rich med-full body; i could drink a few of these, but not too many."
"Poured a dark amber color with a light brown head that leaves lacing on my glass. Has a nice smell to it caramel and malts stand out. The taste is good with hints of malts and hops. Mouthfeel is good medium bodied and pretty smooth. I would buy this brew again if I ever see it again good tatse and smoothness."
" Overall this was easily my favorite Sam Adams brew to date. It was the most full, and in my opinion the best crafted that I have seen. Very sweet for a scotch ale, but that was actually a plus here. Perfect one for dinner as it was just full enough that it accentuated flavors great. I really enjoyed this and will be on the lookout for more every time I see it. It just gave me a really good feeling to be trying this one. I highly recommend giving it a try if you can, you will definitely not regret it."
"drinkability is great for a wee-heavy. these brews tend to be over-smoked, which makes this one a milder exception to the rule. another well-crafted brew from the guys at the Boston Beer Company. cheers!"
"Dinkability- This beer is delicious and would go well with a nice cigar, Id have a few."
"Cheers"
"D: This is a tasty beer with a great feel and characteristic smokiness from peat that is really distinctive."
"My last to try from the ""Brewmaster's Selection."" Beautiful pour...deep, dark, reddish-brown with a nice head in the Sam Adams glass. Unbelievable ""smoked"" flavor! Tastes I'm drinking a glass of pipe smoke!! (Not a bad thing, really!) Very smokey, but in a wonderfully unique and smoooth way. Also very very malty, with hints of caramel in there too. Geez...this is a complex brew...the most of the ""Selection"" and one to be savored. Search your palette (or however you spell it!) and you'll find alot of different stuff dancing around on your buds! Very nice and HIGHLY recommended!! Not for the ""faint-of-heart-beer-drinker"" though, since it's very deep and complex. Smooth and yummy after-dinner brew with a cigar! Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!!"
"part of a SA mixed 12"
"DA: Complex enough to keep you interested and very easy to drink."
"The first scotch ale I've had. It took a bottle or two before I became a fan, but now I love it! Sam Adam's version has a very nice coloring, an excellent rich, deep, dark aroma, and a wonderful peaty-smoky finish. My favorite American brewed Scotch Ale. (So, I suppose it should be called a Scotch style ale, huh?)"
"This was my first Scotch Ale,and if the rest are as good or better...bring 'em on! I got this in a Sam Adams mixed 12 pack and enjoyed it the most.I drank the two that came in the 12 pack with a Punch cigar,and afterwards was wishing I had found a 12 pack of just these.I will be looking around for more in my area...but I'm not going to hold my breath."
"Nice and easy to drink. An excellent beer."
"This brew came in a Boston Beer mixed twelve pack. Poured in to a Sam Adams pint glass a light brown color, with a small head and nice retention. Aroma produced smoky characters, chocolate, and an overall roasted personality. Flavor is not unlike a Rauchbier in it's smoky tastes, however they are not nearly as pronounced as in that style. Other flavors I picked up were of smoky peat, caramel, and brownies. Mouthfeel is light as far as I can tell for the style. The malt has been bigger in others I have tried, but it might make this an even more drinkable offering. Not a bad beer from Sam Adams brewery. It surprisingly went very well with a dill pickle."
"Samuel Adams Scotch Ale was a brown-amber color with good clarity. It had a nice beige head with good retention and lacing. The aroma was malty and a little sweet with dried fruit and a hint of smoke. The taste was malty, a bit fruity, a peat character, and good balance with sweetness upfront and a little bitterness towards the finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation and was somewhat creamy. Drinkabity was good. This is another fine ale from the Boston Beer Company."
"I love this beer and got it with the Samuel Adams Mix Pack. I only wish that they could make it more accessible."
"I liked this beer, and probably would buy more."
"A dark brown liquid with a thick tan head, good lacing. Smell is more subtle than I would anticipate with such a dark and bubbly brew. A hint of chocolate and raisin, touch of malt. The feel of this is smooth and very drinkable. You get a mild malt and brown sugar taste mix with a dry, almost licorice quality. After a few minutes you start to smell and taste some butterscotch which eventually becomes a prominent flavor. Very nice. A nice carbonation. Went down real easy for a heavy-ish beer. This is a scotch ale that I would think most beer lovers would like, if not love. Nice job Sam."
"M/D - So smooth & creamy all the way through. As soon as I took the first sip I knew I could enjoy it all night but too bad it isn't available more. I've never seen it in a 6-pack although I've heard they are available. This was part of the mix 12-pack and is definitely the most enjoyable beer along with the Black Lager. I would recommend this to anyone."
"12 oz bottle best by November 2007, Pours a dark ruby-garnet color with a finger of fizzy off-white head, lots of sticky lacing left behind. Nose is very malty, with a hint of caramel and of smoke. Taste is full of smoky malt, hints of chocolate and caramel, a slight nuttiness, finishing with a slight hop bite. Full bodied and very smooth, this is a nice drinking beer. Very good brew from Sam Adams."
"D: Few things can top a nice wee heavy. This one has it all, a low abv, strong caramel (especially in the nose) and a great smoked caramel flavor. Very enjoyable."
"Crisp, refreshing, and immensely drinkable. This is a session ale for the ages."
"Definitely one of the ""darker"" tasting Scotch Ales I've tried, it embraces the bitter, silty, peated side of the malts instead of the sugary side. Its nice, balanced, not boring, and a stunner to look at. A pretty good Scotch Ale, especially if you prefer the not so sweet style. Could pair beautifully with a number of cheeses of many styles. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a deep amber with a thin, longlasting head. Plenty of upfront maltiness in the nose. A nice, rich ale; chewy, sweet but not cloying, and very firm body. Finishes a tad dry with little aftertaste. One of SAs best brew in my opinion. Bought it as part of a 12 pack Brewmaster's Special."
"D- a very interesting and drinkable beer, but one I need to be in the mood for"
"D- Its pretty drinkable. Take the carbonation down a few notches and it would be much better."
"The taste on the other hand was terrible. One gulp and I spitted it out and dump the rest of the six pack down the drain. It tasted like, ""liquid Vynal"". The flavor was just like the way Vynal smells. Do they have Vynal tanks?"
"Again peat just totally dominates the taste. Still some hints of fresh darker fruits. Black cherry, red currant, and hints of flowers. Problem is this really lacks in depth and balance. Mouthfeel is also thin for this style. A good solid beer but not best of category."
" This was probably my favorite of the mixed case and I always like to save the best for last, cheers!"
"Drink - Goes down pretty smoothly, but it is not terribly interesting, and it is not a great session beer. Somewhere in between."
"Poured a dark brown with an amber tint, cream colored head that went down very slowly. Smelled strong and absolutely delicious. Roasted, slightly-sweet malts balanced very well with a tasty bitter smell. Tasted very good as well, similar to the smell in many ways: smokey malt flavor with hints of caramel and nuts, yet a tasty, wet, bitter aftertaste. Medium-light body that goes down warm and easy. Quite drinkable, I might grab another one right now."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and pleasantly surpsising. Ihad this in the brewers 24 pack I bought at Costco. This beer alon is worth the price of the case, although the Honey Porter and Boston Ale are quite good as well."
"Very nice, deep caramel color. Good sized head on top and some great lacing as it goes down. Decent aroma though not overly pronounced-slight smokiness against a caramel sweet malt. Smokiness dominates the flavor-almost ""ash"" like. Good caramel flavor with a hint of bitterness to it. Moderate whiskey notes. Nice body considering the lower abv. a nice beer but the smokiness is over done to my liking. Still quite enjoyable and it doesnt have the vinuos/winey notes that some wee heavys tend to have."
"Drinking Sam Adams Scotch Ale was no problem. Restraining myself from polishing off of my supply of four was more problematic. Quite tasty and holding true to style, S.A. Scotch Ale is a well-crafted example of the style and worth seeking out."
"D - Mouthfeel is pleasant. I found myself enjoying almost as much as the gentle hop spice nuance complimenting the malt backing. A larger gulp increases enjoyment of the experience w/ this ales salty caramel sweet balance."
"D: WAY off for the style. This could pass as drinkible, but I think I'd rather dump it."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a murky reddish brown with a fluffy head that leaves thick flat lace on the glass. Smell is very matly with a hint of some smoke goodness. Taste is of roasted malt and barley with a smokey wood taste finish, this is pretty complex for a Sam Adams brew and a good after dinner relax drink. This is a fine offering from Boston Beer and a good addition to any relaxing event."
"Bottle says best before November 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch off-white head. It smells like smoky, roasted malt, raisins and caramel. It tastes the same way, but very peaty/smoky and malty. It also has a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium, with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it's smooth and good to drink. Not a bad beer, I'd definitely drink it again."
"Cheers!"
"pours a dark amber with a nice white head. the smell is like sweet alcohol to me. very subtle smoke flavor throughout the beer, nice malt balance. drying but at the same time resfreshing. not overpowering. some caramel sweetness, but balanced out by a slight bitter tinge. well balanced. really nice to see a larger brewery brewing this kind of style. definitly hit the mark with this one."
"Pours a jewel-like, translucent brown with highlights like dried amber. Sticky head that leaves lacing in spite of its small size. The aroma is quite smoky, and also features some molasses-y sweet malts. Dusty, dry nut aroma sneaks in as it warms. On the palate, there's a sharp twang of bitterness first off, then a sweet, smoky, oaky warmness at the center. The finish dries out a bit as those earthy hop tastes return. Medium bodied, not very thick for the style, with pretty understated carbonation. Overall, this is only OK. IMO, it's too smoky; I would have preferred a bit of fruity and nutty complexity. It has a touch of astringency in the mouthfeel and feels a bit sticky on my teeth. It's not bad or anything, just flawed."
"A really nice beer from Sam Adams, got it in the brew masters variety box. A nice box with some really good beers, give it a try if you get a chance."
"Now, then, time to take some Tylenol PM, and drift off to sleep."
"Drinkability, very much so, easy go'en, laid back brew."
"Also being an imbiber of scotch, a scotch ale sounds incredibly inviting. Bottle smell is sweet malty, and outdoorsy, like the scottish highlands, with hints of licorice. Poured into a chalice the color is dark caramel. Slight head, quickly dissapated. Taste is semi-sweet with an smokey more than roasted background and a slight bitterness. Good carbonation. Moderate weight not too heavy but not light. A great flavor. May be a little too smokey for a sessioner but tasty none-the-less. Sam continues to please with a great uniqueness of flavors. But, 4 oz of hops per barrel, this might need about 7."
"Very clear amber/brown color. Nice creamy head and some decent lacing  this is a pretty beer. The aroma is quite malty with some hints of caramel. The taste is malty with a bit of a smoke flavor. Overall it seems to be well balanced. The mouthfeel is on the full side and seems fitting for this brew. I think this is a smooth beer and would consider it an easy drink."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Nice clear amber color. Medium carbonation and light bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is malty with some hop bite, medicinal, watery finish. Disappointing example of a scotch ale. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Poured to a medium dark reddish-brown with medium thick off-white head that lingered well and left good lacing. Aroma was a blend of smoked wood and malty dark fruit. Flavor oicked up teh dark fruit more than the smoke, and the mouthfell was slightly tingly, and somewhat bitter-sweet. The finish was on the bitter side, and of medium duration, both of what I have found to be the case in most Scotch Ales. Not a bad beer."
"D - Very strong tasting beer not for the faint of heart. One of my favorite beers from Sam Adams."
"Light alcohol warmth as an aftertaste only."
"Poured a clear , darker reddish brown , with a small offwhite head which left a bit of lace. The aroma is of fairly rich and sweet malt , bit of dark fruit , and some chocolate. Taste is nice and smooth with a fair amount of roasty and sweet malt , a light smoky character , brown bread ,slight chocolate , caramel , brown sugar, hint at a dark fruit , balancing bitterness , and dryer finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly slick quality. Not a bad scotch ale at all , very quaffable and i liked the peaty/smoked quality. Definatly worth a try , a bit like a smoky doppelbock."
"12oz brown bottle with best before date of October 07. Pours a medium dark amber with a 1 finger head, decent longevity and good lace. Big malt aromas - nuff said. big malt flavors but mixed with a smokey flavotr as well. The smokiness is a bit too strong for me. a well amde a tasty beer but it could be a bit smoother. With a bit more work this one could be a really nice beer, but its not there yet."
"Served in a bulb. A medium pour produces a two-fingered tan head, which collapses into a rocky formation in a few minutes. Lacing is quite good, adhering very firmly to the surface of the glass in a lattice-like formation. Dark garnet in color, and brilliant to the eye. The nose is very compelling, with notes of peat-smoked malts dominating tangy dark malts and sweet, biscuity pale malts. Bright and lively on the first sip, with a pleasant roundness to the malt profile coming to the fore. Finish is actually compelling as well, beginning with lingering biscuit notes before giving way to a partway tangy, partway peaty finish. There's a nice touch of oily, viscousity here, too. Fruity and a bit boozy at one moment, yet hardly sweet; tangy, light, almost crisp. Notes of ripe dark fruits and berries, particularly those that balance sweet with tart (cranberry). A little bit buttery, with a bit more alcohol in the aromatics. Hop bitterness is very well defined, yet works in tandem with the carefully blended malt profile (besides, has anyone heard of a hoppy Scotch Ale?) This may be a bit lighter than I prefer for the style, but no doubt this was formulated with an appeal to the more casual drinker than Scotch loyalists. Either way, there's no missed-step in the execution of the style. Perhaps a bit too smokey for some, it works for me. A fine rendition overall."
"Purchased "" Brewmasters Collection"" sampler set and the Scotch Ale was one of the choices. Pours a nice reddish brown color with decent head. Has a strong smoke taste as well as hints of subdued fruits. I will say that the first bottle of the Scotch ale that I tried was not all that appealing. On second taste I have discovered that this is a pretty complex brew with some nice subtle flavors. I now look forward to drinking more of this beer."
"The mouth is just thick enough. Im on the fence if this one is a session beer or not, but it sure is tasty."
"pours medium brown color, tan three finger head with good lacing. smokey caramel, molasses roasted malt and coffee nose. taste is the same with a lingering after taste of coffee. mouthfeel light, little weak on the carbonation. its not my style, i am not a fan of that smokey flavor otherwise its ok."
"Purchased a 12oz bottle as part of a ""Brewmasters Collection"" mixpack. Pours a deep amber color. Decent head settles quickly, forming light collar. Not overly carbonated.Smells mossy and woodsy. Tastes slightly sour as you might expect a scotch ale to taste, and finishes very smooth. Not too bad, but it wouldnt be my first choice."
"Pours a deep reddish amber color with a solid half inch head and good carbonation. Aroma was quite malty and biscuity. Taste was of sweet malts, smoke, tobacco and light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was light to medium and had a smooth character. Drinkability was good. For a Scotch ale though, you expect something a little more substantial and heavier. Still, this is a fairly tasty ale. I just wish I could buy a sixer of it and not one of those mixed 12 packs."
"The ale pours a deep brown with a fluffy half inch head. Faint malty aroma that dives into a rich complex malty flavor that has some roasted malts & hops that bites slightly on the back end to balance the sweetness. This is a full bodied ale that is very drinkable. The malt profile is rather interesting. I wish we could have this in six packs in Nashville because our Scotch Ales are few and far between."
"12 oz bottle. The beer is a very deep amber color with a finger of light tan head that falls to a full coating over top. The brew is fairly clear and there is a lack of visible carbonation in it. I like how this one sits in the glass. The nose is caramel, a little buttery, and light with peaty smoke. The butteryness seems to dominate a bit and is not what I really wanted to find. Taking a sip, I find a more pronounced peaty smoke than the nose would tell me. The caramel is really nice behind that, adding a mild sweetness and a very good malt base. The butteryness is not present in the flavor, which really helps pull this one together for me. There is just a hint of a mild hop bitterness that fills out the finish of this one. It is enjoyable. The mouthfeel is moderate with a lightish to moderate carbonation. Overall, I like this one. Outside of the buttery aromas that are in there, this one is solid."
"All in all, it is a decent interpretation of a scotch ale. However, if you want something GREAT and are in the Western New York area, Rohrback makes an incredible scotch ale."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a ruby brown color with a thin, creamy looking head. The smell is primarily of sweet malt, but the smokiness is also quite prevalent. The taste has a little bit of a roasted character to it, very smoky and sweet with amber/caramel malt, almost no hop character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and chewey. This is a very drinkable beer, goes down easy, full of taste. This one is worth a try."
"D: Like I mentioned, a great sessional Scotch Ale (if that's possible), but it's just not a genuine S.A. and doesn't have nearly the depth of most. It's the drinkability and the balance that's game here. So, it's a Sam Adams."
"Mouthfeel of this brew is pretty good. Creamy in the mouth with a medium-heavy body, and lower carbonation...well at least for Sam Adams. I would not buy this beer again. It is a complete let down. I was looking forward to a Scotch Ale, and well this shouldn't be classified as one. There are definitely better examples of the style out there if you're looking to try a scotch ale don't look here."
"Overall, a decent beer, and certainly one of SA's better beers (though not better than Triple Bock, Double Bock, or any of the super specialty offerings like Millennium or Utopias.) It definitely beats the hell out of standard Sam offerings like Boston Lager; however, it's far from overwhelming. Like I said: average."
"This is a beer that I will drink again, and may order it. Definately on of my favs ... even with the roasty taste."
"Sampled from a variety 12-pack (which by the way, is quite enjoyable!). A little dry on the tongue, most likely from the ""triple malt"". No don't get me worng, I love the malty aspect of beers, but this ends up being a little too much. Lots of smoke and bark root. I think what's missing is the heavy ABV that I accustomed too witht this style. Witht the low ABV, it ends up being quite drinkable. This is a beer you give to your cousin-in-law that doesn't drink craft beer regulary. Not a bad offering, certinaly won't be purchasing a 12-pack of it though/"
"Longneck into a standard pint. Produced a 1/2 inch light tan head and was deep red in color. Took a while for the head to fade, and it did leave some lacing. Aroma was dominated by malt with some caramel sweetness and a scotch or whisky-like smell. Taste was very malty and caramelly-sweet up front with some light roast. This was balanced by a nice, earthy hop presence, and finished peaty with a whisky feel. A medium-bodied brew with moderate carbonation and a slight alcohol warming. This malt-bolstered brew is heavy and complex, and it is probably better in smaller amounts or as the end of a session. One is enough for me."
"D: This is not a brew to sit down and drink several at a time, as there are several malt flavors to analyze. Because of the variety of malt flavors present, this is probably one of the best brews to analyze, as its complexity is awesome. It might be argued there are too many malt flavors going around, but when this beer is served at the right temperature, they taste damn good."
"12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of Sept. 2007. Poured into a pint glass. the beer poured a deep amber, forming a 1/2 inch fluffy head, leaving thick lacing on the glass. The aroma is very weak, being mostly of the malts. The taste is of malt, with a little caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium. An interesting brew from Sam Adams. Not something that I could drink several of in one sitting, but definitely one worth experiencing."
"The Scotch Ale pours dark red-brown with a nice, rocky slightly off-white head. The aroma is a bit smoky with malt sweetness and a little alcohol. Taste is dominated by the maltiness. The smoke is still there. Mouthfeel is good, somewhat full, some creaminess. Drinkability is good as well. This beer is a treat after a long, cold day. I could easily polish off the two that were part of the Samuel Adams mixed 12 pack, but I don't think I will. I'll try another and save the other Scotch Ale for another time. I will seek this beer out again. Recommended."
"Eric"
"12 oz bottle from the new SA Brewmaster's 12-pack. Dark brown body with ruby red-highlights and about a half an inch of light tan head. Smells malty, smokey and peaty. Tastes sweet and roasty, malty, rich, with hints of peatyness and butter, as well as a few other things I can't quite put my finger on. Surprisingly complex for a Scotch ale. Does not clobber you with malty sweetness and peatyness like many Scotch Ales do. It's fairly well-balanced and rich. Creamy mouthfeel which is enhanced by the carbonation in this beer. A really well-crafted beer. I'm impressed."
" For me, superb scotch ale. Just luv it, would luv this in a sixer, but que sera, sera."
"This was a decent ale, but a poor representation of the style, I felt. Colour was a brick red colour with a thin, khaki coloured head. Loads of CO2 and fair head retention. Average at best. Smell was a bit weak. ""Malt"" is about all I get from this. Taste, too, leaves alot to be desired. There is a grain / malt presence, and a touch of bitterness, but as far as any really noticeable flavour profiles, they simply aren't there. Not impressed. Mouthfeel is fair and the overall drinkability or ""functionality"" of this ale is decent. It is not a bad beer. In fact, I would likely drink this again. Especially with food. I simply think this is a very poor attempt at brewing a Wee Heavy."
"Holy shit. The best SA brewmaster's beer I've ever had. I am sad I have to buy a whole mix pack just to get two of them. But oh well. This beer has a great head an retention. The smell leaped up to me as I poured. The taste is a balance of caramel and chocolate malts, sort of a licoriciness. It clings incredibly well and was the easiest to drink scotch ale I've had to date. The best SA beer that I've ever had."
"The peat character is noticeable, but not overpowering, and gives this ale a distinctive taste even among Scottish ales. It is not as smoky as I expected, just peaty. The emphasis is on malt complexity rather than sweetness, which is still fairly substantial. An intriguing Scottish ale."
"From the sampler pack. Pours a light mahogany color, with a thick off white creamy head. Very good head retention and lace. Nice malty, robust and slightly smoky aroma. Caramel flavors combine with a hint of nuttiness. Not as robust as I would have liked. Medium body, with slightly lower carbonation. Pretty good."
"Pours a deep garnet color with a nice frothy tan head that disappears alomst completely after a minute or so. Smells of of peat smoked malts with woody scents mixed in. Tastes great. Peat smoked malts dominate here but some dark fruit flavors are also present here. Good mouthfeel, maybe a bit thin in terms of body but has the right amount of carbonation to make for a creamy and delicious brew. Great drinkability, at only 5.4% abv and with the somewhat lighter body this is a good brew that Id call sessionable."
" A very tastey beer, makes the mouth water,could drink this untill I could drink no more.Very enjoyable."
"Pours a clear deep amber with a modest head that dissipates quickly. Caramel malty aroma that is pleasant to the nose. Smooth initial taste leads to a somewhat astringent finish. My first Scotch Ale and to me, not one of the better Samuel Adams offerings, to my taste."
"This one has a good aftertaste that will remind you of what you're drinking.... stand up, open yer mouth and enjoy this fine brew from one of our founding fathers..."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: A very tasty Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy. I really liked the smokiness."
"Overall, quite good and very drinkable. Looking forward to the other varieties I have in the ""on deck"" circle."
"I don't have much experience with scotch ales, but I found this one to be very nice. Fairly mild in flavor but a good drinking beer. Recommended."
"I hereby raise the taste rating 1.5 points."
"355ml bottle. Not bad, Malty with a little bit of sweets...my tastes must not be able to detect the deepness BBC is trying to produce. I think they have decent other beers. Has a higher alcohol content than I would have imagined. I think they may be spreading themselves too thin with all these spceialty beers."
"This has alot of characteristics in common with big ass porters and stouts, but is somehow more drinkable, maybe due to the lighter body and slightly less powerful flavors. I've got so say that this is one of my favorite beers so far. Deep, robust, complex, well balanced....what's not to like? I can wait to drink the other one! (this wonderful brew alone makes buying the whole mixed 12-er worth every penny)."
"A good one from SA and I'd like to be able to get this in a six...not just the mix pack."
"mf/d-The mouthfeel wasn't bad but it was incredibly drying on the tounge and also slightly watery. This wasn't the most drinkable brew either. I would only have 1 or 2. Not the tastiest scotch ale I have had but I guess it doesn't matter since you only get 2 in their newest samplr pack. A decent scotch ale."
"Not as strong as most scotch ales but man, there's some tasty maltiness going on here. I really like the peaty overtones too. Why can't we get this in 6-packs? Its a damn shame..."
"Adam"
"D - high, very nice, a great beer, easy to throw back in quantities"
"Poured a deep rich amber with pretty weel sustained off white head leaving seperate sheets of lace behind as it it eally never sttled completely.Big malt driven aromas brown sugar and dried fruit aromas dominate dried cherries really show thru along with the before mentioned brown sugar.Alot like the aromas the flavors start out with a big brown sugar character melding into a pruney,raisin flavor finish somewhat dry but not earthy just an ubrupt finish to the sweetness.I think a very well made Scottish style ale deeply malty and packed with flavor,give Boston Beer company credit for this one there are many out there that dont come close to this one."
"I havent had any other beers of this style, but I certainly wasnt expecting the smoky flavor. However, the more I drink it, the better it enhances the overall drinking experience. I suppose if I smoked, this would be really good beer to have with a cigar."
"For year's this has been my favorite Sam Adams offering. While it still is, I would say it only is because Sam's quality has declined across the board. I bought the twelve pack that it comes in a couple of months ago for the sole purpose of getting two scotch ales. They were not anything like the ales I fell in love with years ago. Thinking I might have got a bad batch I've bought two more of these very mediocre twelve packs within the past two weeks. I don't think I've just bought three bad batches. This beer lacks the zing it once had. The qualities that I once admired, the delicate balance of smoke and malty sweetness, have either been carelessly overdone or removed from the formula. In there place is an unimpressive tanginess and a confused jumble of flavors. Obviously Sam Adams is going for quantity over quality. I just wish they'd give this new ale a new name because it is not the Sam Adams Scotch Ale that I had grown so fond of. An average offering at best, which is sad because it is just about the best ale that Sam Adams is offering these days."
"How shall I assign drinkability to this? The bitterness is too much for the style. As a different very malty beer style this is a truly exceptional Altbier that is among the best. As just beer, this is a good one with an assertive bitter snap. I will just say that this is a good beer."
"Drinkability - Good in small quantities. I would get tired of this beer because of its bitterness, but it has a very solid taste and considering the price, I don't think anyone would regret getting this brew."
"This is probably the my least favorite scottish ale I've tried, but still enjoyable."
"This is a surprisingly good Scotch Ale. Flavors are balanced and complex. I didn't expect anything like this from Sam Adams."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is just shy of medium bodied. The carbonation helps bring the taste forth. The beer has a nice smoky balance of sweet and bitter. This is a pretty good beer drink. Overall I wouldnt hesitate to have this one again."
"A great beer from the Boston Beer Company, its to bad it can't be purchased on its own anymore."
"Notes: This would be #2 on my list of sam adams regular type offerings. Solid and although it won't be a regular in my stable of brews at home, if I see it out and about I'll partake for sure. Nice."
"If you are looking for a stronger beer with a nice feel, this is a winner. Not an everyday brew, but for a scotch ale, a decent offering."
"A very dark amber, almost brown, body with a thick frothy head.Head retains itself for a lengthy amount of time. A sweet, smoky aroma. Malty sweetness mixed with a slight smokiness in the taste as well. Medium-bodied and pretty easy to drink. Not my style, but all right every now and again."
"Quite drinkable; it is a strong beer, but not overly strong, with a very palatably smooth draft."
"Closing Notes- This is a fine example of what Sam Adams does best - they make very drinkable and approachable beers in a particular category. This is one of their best."
"This is just an all around great (session) beer."
"Overall an easy to drink Scotch Ale. Probably a good introduction to the style for someone whose never had one before."
"Pours a dark brown with a white head. Smells smoky and burnt, almost sweet, and very inviting. Taste is burnt with mostly bitter and malty characteristics. Aftertaste is the same, but the bitter leaves you wanting another sip. A pretty good mouthfeel, a good balance in flavor as with most sam adams beers. A very drinkable beer that is interesting and definitely worth trying. I enjoyed this beer and probably will buy more."
"I would enjoy this one much more on tap I believe...not something I'd purchase in the future."
"For years, this was my favorite of all the Sam Adams beers, until it disappeared from the market in Texas in 1999. I got this one from a 24-beer sampler. An excellent beer!"
"A bit watery and I wish it had more of a body but overall not a bad beer to drink."
"I'd buy this one again, but not often."
"Dark bronze color, creamy off-white head. Smoky, slightly roasted malt character. Woody, mildly chemical aftertaste. Medium-bodied, could use a bit more heft. Dissapointed it doesn't gain really any character as it warms..tastes nearly the same between fridge temp & room temp. Was nice to try, but didn't bowl me over. Will wait until I find this on-draft before I sample it again."
"Edit: In reading over other reviews of this beer it seems that either the consistency varies greatly or people are tasting something very different... I may revisit this one in the future and see if it's any better than what I've had this time."
"This is a great beer pours amberish brown but see through. held a good head the whole time I drank it not just on the pour. the smell was very clean lightly roasted malt. taste is good smooth and balanced malt. and the mouth feel was really pleasant a good balance of carbonation. I could drink several of these beers in one sitting it didn't seem really heavy so it will not fill you up too much. Over all great beer, and a great style of beer."
"Da very good sipping beer. Would have another, but would probably stop after 2"
"A nice ale that is damn good I must say."
"Mouthfeel: This beer has a nice heavy mouthfeel, I would have thought it was stronger. I'm not sure I could drink more then one or two, but its really holds up well for 5.4%."
"A dark amber color with a small head that dissipates quickly. The fun starts with a good sniff. A sweet smoky odor, almost like a burned caramel. It has a similar taste, with a grainy background. Some hoppiness also. A smooth feel to it, and fairly substantial too. A good beer to drink, but not too many in a single sitting."
"Pours a nice amberish, dark brown, with a nice sticky 1/4"" head with average retention and sticky lacing. Smell is malt heavy. Sweet. The forementioned caramel. And a tad bit grainy. The taste is a complex malt dominated chewy taste. I also get some dark fruits. Plums maybe. And a bit of an oak taste. Wonderfully complex but I wish the hops were more noticable. Feels thick and creamy in the mouth with a nice bite on the back end. Drinakble but not to session. Seems more of a desert beer to me, or one to sit by the fire with a good book and sip."
"nice dark amber maple syrup colored.. clear. thin but intricate lacing, creamy head. very visually appealing. big brown sugary sweet malted nose. very wee heavy with a touch of additional sweetness. the smoked malts come through more in the flavor, mirroring the taste of jinx with a bit more sweet and buttery malt presence. the lower ratio of peat smoke in the malt bill shows here, providing something a bit more drinkable and accessible to the boston lager drinking public. still, a little thick and sweet and personally i'd like more smoke to it. a nice achievement nonetheless."
"A nice fireside sipper, could be that I've had few other smoked beers since then so I'm skewed as far as my memory goes. This is in the upper tier of Sammy's bootled efforts widely available to us poor masses outside of the North East"
"This beer poured out with a thick creamy head. The color is a deep brown-mahogony.The smell is a malty caramel like scent. The taste is a little overpowering. Not as bad as others of this style though. It has sweet backnotes to it. The mouthfeel is affected a bit by the tangy taste but again, not as much as others of this style. The drinkability, I could drink one of these every now and then but not every day. An average beer that I would not mind having again."
"This is quite delicous, wish I could find it on it's own. Pours very dark brown, not much of a head on this. Tastes very malty, caramel, slight hops, even to me a little bit of chocolate, not what I was expecting, though it's extremly slight, but perfect in it's taste. Mouthfeel is nice. Best part is I can drink several of these in a row. Another great beer from the Boston Beer Co."
"It has a great head that holds well. The color is a little murkey brown. It has a great complex smell. One can dectect both hops and sweet malts. THe taste is even more complex than the smell. Hops and malts are once again present but there is also a definite bitterness. Smokey malts are present along with some woody flavoring. The beer has a good body and carbonation. Overall this is a great beer that can bring something totaly different to one's palate"
"I think the beer could do with a little more alcohol, but its still a decent beer indeed. Outstanding."
"12 oz. with purchase by April on the side. Served chilled in a tulip. Pours a nice ruby color with medium carbonation and an off-white 2 finger head that is rocky/clumpy, taking awhile to recede. It leaves beautiful lacing and retains a half inch cap throughout. Smells of sweet dark fruits, nutty/earthiness, green hops, and some smokiness. Lots of hops on the palate - mostly floral/citric - along with a big malt backbone of earthy/nutty malts, dark fruits, and a medium to high bitterness. The malts are wonderful - hard to pin down individual flavors - and the hops balance nicely. The mouthfeel is medium and quite smooth. Without a doubt the best Sam Adam's I've tried to date, whether it is true to the Scotch style or not."
"A thin tannish foamy head over a dark nutty brown clear beer. Smoky roasted malt aroma with hint of nuttiness lurking in the background. Tasted nutty, slightly bitter, and smoky. A burnt aftertaste and a hint of residual sweetness. This beer is smooth on the tongue. This Scotch Ale is weighty in my opinion, so I don't think I'd drink one after another after another. I think this is more of a session beer."
"Pours out a deep crimson with a smallish, but nice, almond colored head. Head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is of strong malts (caramel?) and a notable nutty scent. Tastes of big malts and a nice strong hop balance. Finishes slightly dry, but not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but not a distraction in any way. Very drinkable, but not something to make a long session with. Recommended for people who are not a fan of the style."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with a huge fluffy white head. The aroma is rather subdued. It is sweet, and buttery. The taste sweet with no detectable hops. Still, it is not overly sweet. There are also some buttery flavors. The mouthfeel is slightly no the light side of medium bodied, and mildly creamy. Overall, this is a decent brew, but there are better Wee Heavys available in my area."
"A nice dark amber color,but the head was a little on the smallish side,one finger.A real spice and hop smell,very aromatic.A strong hop and spiced filled flavor.This leaves a very nice malty after taste.A medium/heavy feel that means I don't know if I could have more than a couple.A very good offering from Sam.I'll try this again."
"Poured out a nice dark red brew with a 2 finger head,,very nice.Nice malt sweet smell, if i could place it i would say smell of black licorice.Taste is decieving at first,,sweet up front then a nice tight dryness in the finish. Mildly hopped,,hops show up in the middle of the sip.An ok brew this is my first of the style."
"Pours a beautiful dark red amber with a nice two-finger head. Smell is sweet and fruity malt. Tastes is sweet malt with a little smokiness- very interesting and good. There's a little bit of hops in the finish- but not much. Also leaves a slight smokey flavor in the mouth. This beer is medium-bodied and easy to drink."
"The aroma is mostly malt and toffee smells. The aroma is nice and distinguished in that it stands out after several sips. The taste is nicely malted with a caramel and toffee chewiness. There is also a nice balance of hoppiness in the aftertaste. This is one of the best I have tasted from Sam."
"Pours a deep red amber, semi-clear. An off-white two finger head holds a foamy cap to the end and produces some patchy lacing. Smell is faint burnt malt and sweet esters. A burnt malt flavor washes over the palate followed immediatly by an pungent bitterness. I'd guess the rich flavor is due to the ""rare peat smoked malt used in scotch whiskies"" and addional malts. Hop presence is low and incidental, just enough to dry aftertaste. Full bodied and strong, but finishes clean."
"As a Scotch Ale, this is real drinkable. Lower alcohol, a nice smoke presence, and caramel sweetness make this an interesting diversion for any day. Or all day, as the case may be! I would like to see more alcohol in this, but this is damn good."
"Drinkabilit: it is a deep and complex beer I could definitely enjoy."
"Very enjoyable and very drinkable. I wish this was available in more than the mix pack."
"deep ruby color with a creamy head that shrunk to a thin patch; nice lacing. smelled fruity and floral with a candy or soapy overtone. dry malty taste with a slight sweet finish and small bite. metallic and prune or liquorice qualities in the flavor as well. could only find the faintest smoke or peatiness which was disappointed. medium body with almost no apparent carbonation - very smooth. not bad, but not my thing i guess. as a scotch fan i was hoping for more smoked peat."
"Got this from their 12pk Collection- seems to be a good marketing device for them.Certainly gets you to ttry the full line."
"Overall, a nice scotch ale, while being mass-produced. I'd recommend this to anyone who wanted to be able to drink a nice Scotch Ale by the sixer."
"Bottle notched best by October 2005. When I heard Sam Adams was bringing this beer back, I was overjoyed. I fondly remembered the complex, smokey flavor of the old brew. Finally found some in a brewaster 12 pack at Green's in Columbia, SC. Alas, I was a little disapointed. Poured a deep rich ruby red with an off white head. Smell of dark chocolate and caramel malts with just a hint of the peat smoked malt that I remember. Maybe my taste buds have matured or they have changed the recipe, but I did not sense as much of the peat smoked malt as before. A very satifying brew, just not as good as I remember."
"A remarkably average scotch ale for what I was expecting. The pour was a bit darker than I've had in other scotch ales and the head but a bit denser but that's about it. Light malty and 'dry' smell. Perhaps unbleached paper. Not really malty or sweet, not enough lowland scotch sensation either. Not bad but nothing remarkable about the taste. Perhaps a bit undercarbonated, readily drinkable."
"pours out a clear, deep ruby colour, with an off white head that sticks slightly as lace. sweet malty and slightly smoky aroma. lots of peat smoked malt in the flavour; quite tasty. a bit of alcohol spice adds a touch of character. the overall profile is sweet and malty but a dryness in the finish balances this brew out. the body comes off as lacking, mainly because i prefer a big body with a flavourful brew. the mouthfeel is a bit prickly. ends with some warmth and satisfaction. i'm sure i'd like this more in december rather than early june. i would buy this if offered in six packs and available in the fall and winter. a nice ale."
"Drinkability: I couldn't see drinking more than one of these in a sitting. It was nice to see that Sam Adams brewed something that was different from other breweries. Nice to try, but not my favorite."
"Overall-While I suppose I can respect the labor of love that went into this brew and that I am a defender of Boston Beer this is one of the most disappointing beers I've had. The mix of flavors isn't sucessful and don't go together at all, chunky mouthfeel as well. I'm not a fan."
"Poured out a light brick ruby color with a nice 1/2 inch head. Smell was all malts for the most part. Some caramel makes an appearence with some smoky peat lingering in the background. I would of liked to see some more smokiness, but this will do. Taste was decent. Sweetened malts start out and gives away to a caramel, smoky peat flavor. Some hpos do show up, but just add to the variety of flavors that are already in here. Mouthfeel was a little weak I thought. It was medium but finished a tad watery with no big aftertaste. Overall it was a good, tasty brew."
"Drinkability: This is an intriguing offering from the Boston Beer Company that is fortunately featured in their Brewmasters Collection packs. While I find the smokiness a bit too overwhelming to enjoy this regularly (if I could, that is), this is nonetheless a beer worth tasting."
"A very smooth pour; a nice deep red brown color, lots of clarity, little head. Smells strongly of butterscotch, sweet maltyness, toffee, and that classic Scotch Ale smokiness is just perfect. Wow, the smokiness is much more pronounced than I thought it might be. That hits you up front, and then fades to the sweeter candy butterscotch tones hinted at in the smell. Nice toffee malts. I'm sure there are hops in this beer, but beyond a slighty bitter bite in the finish, I can barely notice them. Nice slick full mouthfeel. A nice end of the evening beer."
"Obtained in Sam Adams latest brewer's collection pack. Pours a reddish amber with a rocky off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. Malty/carmel nose. Nice mixture of sweetness and bitter in the taste. The neck band mentioned the presence of peat-smoked malt... and I was looking forward to it, but I'm not really sensing much smokiness. Interesting complexity to the taste. Clean finish and a medium body. Good drinkability. Went nicely with a grilled sirloin for dinner!"
"Pleseant brew, nice taste, and good enough to be made for a 6ers. nice show all around"
"Drinkability/notes: Far off of style for a Scotch Ale, a type which I happen to like very well. Disappointing that such a beer comes from Sam Adams, whom I associate with competent, if not inspired, craft brewing."
"Overall Impression: Drain food. Didnt enjoy this at all, and I like Scotch ales. I think Sam Adams is trying to be all things to all people, which is a bad road. Im also thinking that somehow the case we got was abused, well, hoping really."
"Have another laddie? Aye."
"Fairly dense, dark cream colored head leaves some nice. Aroma is nice and malty; kind of biscuity/doughy with a bit of caramel. Transparent, deep mahogany colored beer with a ruby hue. Body isn't too thick, but the mouthfeel is still soft and chewy. Flavor is just sweet enough. Tastes like a bit of caramel and some toasted bready goodness. The finish is slightly bitter and just a tad tangy. A good scotch ale that would probably go over well with a wide variety of beer drinkers."
"Well, honestly I bought a 12-pack of the Brewmasters Collection for the Black Lager, but this was the real gem in the package. I know that Sam Adams presents a fine target for the beer geeks of the world, but I hope I've always given them a fair shake, and this is my reward for doing so. A very nice Wee Heavy with a nice mix of the caramel and smoked malts along with an uncharacteristic hop touch that melds nicely into the beer. In general, I can see why people begged Boston Beer to bring this one back, and I hope that this will be a regular offering for them."
"In my opinion not the best example of the scotch ale style, but still enjoyable. If you enjoy good scotch, then you should love this beer."
"Pours a dark ruby red color with a large sticky head. Smells very sweet and malty. Some what smoky too. The taste is dominated by sweet and smokey malts. Some syrupy flavor and a little bit of hops make this ale a very balanced one. Mouth-feel is meduim, kind of creamy. What can I say, this is one the best Samuel Adams has to offer! One thing I do not undersand is; Why not six packs?! Either way a big thumbs up!"
"Pours a very clear reddish amber with a handsome beige head. Lots of lacing. Smells mildly nutty and sugary. Strong dark caramel malt profile with a bit of tart sweetness. Scant chestnut and ginger blurbs in there too. Finishes slightly dry and astringent. Easy on the tounge, easy going down. Another nice Sam specialty brew."
"A good beer and fairly complex, but a lot more subtle than I remember it being years ago. More balls, and this would be a great one."
"Tastes of sweet cookie dough malts with notes of peat bog and whiskey. Moves toward a meaty, smoky bitterness as we head into a bready-sweet finish. Medium/big body with a creamy mouthfeel. Nice. Good example of the style (as far as I can tell). One of the best SAs Ive had as well. They should sell six-packs of this."
"This poured a reddish-brown color with a good head. I'm thinking of a burnt apricot smell,pleasant. Smokey, but more of a licorice taste,this isn't my type of ale but not that bad. It has a slight malty after taste that stays for awhile. This is worth a try, not something that I would go out of my way to drink again."
"Overall, this beer isn't my cup of tea. Other than the second bottle I have, I can't see ever wanting to drink this one again."
"Alstroms update: you can now get two bottles of this beer in the Sam Adams Brewermasters Collection Mix pack! (12 pack)."
"excellent ale from sam adams. looks good, smells good, and tastes good. cant compare this ale to another because it is quite unique, smooth malt, goes down nice, refreshing also. can say a lot negative about this beer, one of the best in the ne wline of sam adams ales."
"Final Thought: This was the 6th & final beer of the Brewmasters' Collection and all were great, I raise my beer for you Sam, you founded the microbrewery, and I drink to you!"
"What a pleasant surprise. This brew poured a caramell brown with an initial two finger head that dissipated but remained with excellent lacing. Smell was malty with a smoked character. Taste was three fold...an initial malt sweetness, then a smoky peat character, and finally a lightly bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel was good, with no harsh or oily element throughout. Easy to drink...a pleasant surprise out of a sampler pack."
"A nice example of the style."
"I'm really glad SA decided to bring this brew back!"
"Nice to see this brew back, if only in the Brewmaster's Collection. Perhaps BBC can put a couple in the Winter Classics box too. Tis a proper pint."
"I've always liked this beer. This didn't disappoint."
"Taste: Mmm... interesting... smooth, malty, roasted. Medium body beer with light carbonation, roasted aftertaste that quickly fades. Tad bit dry, but very welcome. Wow this is tasty, very drinkable, pity it is only found in the twelve pack brewmaster's collection."
"dark brown ruby beer with tan head. looks like root beer. a little darker than i thought it would be. nutty aromas with coffee, caramel and chocolate notes. i get a faint licorice smell as well. a little grainy too. the taste is pretty rich, with nutty caramel and coffee flavors coming through the most. a grainy character is present that contributes to a little bit of dryness that this beer needs. hops make an appearance but the maltiness dominates. there is a delicate smokey flavors that lends itself excellently to the complexity of this beer. surprisingly light mouthfeel for the taste. an enjoyable beer. i feel like this walks the line between porter and scotch ale."
"The beer pours a dark ruby color with a thick frothy off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that is very pleasant. It has a caramel malt aroma that is sweet and creamy. The taste is good. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes creamy. It has a dry yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine Scotch ale. It has real malty complexity and a creamy finish; a good drinker."
"Out of the Brewmaster's Collection. Pours a light tan with a creamy dark caramel colored head. Aroma consists of toffee, mineral water and a touch of peat. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth. Roasted, rich malty front. I love the finish of this scotch ale.... sweet caramel malt and a smokey, peaty finish. Robust and satisfying. The hop bitterness that arrives midway through provides a nice balance to the malty sweetness. Glad to see the return of Sam Adams' Scotch Ale."
"This is a very nice brew. This was one of the brews that were included in the Brewmasters Collection. The brew poured to a nice deep mahogany type color with a nice pillowy off white head that broke down slowly and left nice chunky lacing on the sides of the glass. The aromas from this brew are of heavy on the malt with a strong caramel sweetness that goes perfectly together. Also notice a slight smoky aroma with highlights of dark fruit. Simply a fantastic smelling brew! The taste and mouth feel are very good with a strong caramel sweetness that leads to a slight smoky mixed with earthy flavors. Also has a little bit of a alcohol taste that I was able to notice but was mixed nicely with the rest of the flavors of this brew. Very nice offering from BBC, wish the would sell just this in a 6er!"
"Very nice stuff, probably one of Sam Adams' best offerings. I could do with a little finer, less enthusiastic carbonation, but I have no complaints with the malt at all. Pretty much the same as i remember it in it's previous incarnation. Great beer."
"Appearance: Big ol' deep caramel amber hue with a nice light cream head forming two finger measurement leaves nice evenly dispersed lacing all around me pint. Aroma: Awesome caramel nutty edge with a great smokey peated malt influenced note, hops play in the background but the malts rule this brew. Taste: Relatively strong smoked malts tangle with a caramel toasted nut edge simply excellent Scotch ale mild but well balanced and tasty as all hell. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied textbook for the style slightly sticky with each sip but the carbonation very nice even and smooth. Drinkability: Easily one of the most quaffable Scotch style ales I have had to date and very well the best Boston Beer Co. brew widely distributed in the Brewmaster's Collection."
"Part of the brewmaster's collection, I heard through a buddy of mine that the Scotch Ale would kick my butt as soon as I sip it. Man, was he right! For appearance, Scotch Ale pours out in a deep red colour, with little head. The bottle label uses a tartan design. I didn't smell much of an odor upon opening the bottle. After I poured it into a glass, I detected a smoky odor. The taste was really strong at first. It was very smoky, and I felt it immediately on my tongue. On the label, Jim Koch describes it as a ""subtle smoky flavor."" There was nothing subtle about it! After a few sips, I began to fully enjoy the drink. If you are not familiar with scotch ale, like myself, then enjoy one and see if you like it. I came around to enjoying this drink. Cheers."
"Sam Adams Scotch Ale was the first micro I ever drank that was outside of the basic pale ale flavor profile. It was the beer that taught me that beers could taste ""different."" It pours a deep red/mahogany with a thick tan head that has some staying power. Aroma is one of malt, peat and even some iodine/medicinal notes like one would find in Scotch. Maybe a hint of hops as well. Taste is malty with some strong smokey peat notes with a nice dry finish with a decent amount of bitterness. The dry finish makes this beer very drinkable. As good as I remember; a pity that it is only available in mixed 12 packs currently."
"Sampled 1/15/04"
"Medium feel, smooth, very lightly bitter."
"Disappointing, confused as to what they are thinking with this brew. Overhopped for sure, which basically ruins the beer."
"SA Scotch Ale is solidly drinkable and enjoyable. What a treat! A notch above most other BBCs brews."
"Who says the Atkins diet sucks? I was able to pawn the SA Lights off on my buddy. Heh heh heh..."
"Rich malt flavors. Bitter smokiness and nutty flavors. Big malt and big flavor. Hints of caramel and bitter chocolate. Nice hoppy finish. Big beer flavor from a small ABV. Full bodied and just so tasty and chewy. Very well balanced, a symphony of flavors. Very smooth. This beer is worth the Sam Adams Lights I am now stuck with. Oh how I've missed this beer! Now if only the Honey Porter would return."
"ah, the ever elusive sam scotch ale. i was able to grab the second to last brewmaster's pack at a local store solely for two bottles of this brew. it's been at least five years since my last sample and boy did i miss it. it pours a lovely amber/copper colour with a clear, crisp body. a slightly tan thick and foamy head hangs out for a good while. the smell is just great: mainly of malt with a little sweetness in the back (maybe berries of some kind) with some caramel and a touch of smoke. the flavour is full on (but niceley balanced) smokey malt with a dry, slightly chocolate finish. burnt toast and caramel are interlaced throughout. yum, yum, yum. this is an easy drinking brew that's just loaded with flavour. it's one of, if not the best of the bbc's beers."
"Pours a beautiful brown color with tan head that holds up nicely throught the duration of the beer. I really love the appearance of this beer. Has a smoky scent to it with a hint of tobacco. Tastes a bit chocolatey, very malty, and goes down great. A drinkable beer with a great taste. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm about to have another right now."
"Now bring back the Honey Porter, dammit!!"
"On a side note I had a chance to try this beer at the brewery about 2 years ago. They were playing around with the recipe a little and they had added a bit more smoked malt in that batch. It really added another depth to this wonderful beer. Its really sort of a shame they didnt push the envelope again with this mass release. Still, one of my all time favorite Sam Adams beers."
"One ofthe better SA beers and an enjoyable drink...nowhere close to McEwens but that is a truly special beer...this is simply very good.."
"Gotta love the brewmasters collection. This beer pours a gleaming reddish with a middling head. Smells of peat, roased malts and smoke. Tastes of smoke, peat and a nice malt hop balnce. Finished dry with a nice citrus hop aftertaste that compliments the smoke scotch flavors of the beer. The mouthfeel is lighter than what I expected given the aromas, but was pleasing overall and made me wish there were more than two of these in the pack as I would have liked more."
"Call me Ishmael. This is one of my white whale beers. Well, I was not disappointed at all. It was a nice amber color with a tan head. The head was fairly thick and stood around for the whole drink. The smell was like most Scotch ales, but had a bit more body in the malt area. It says that whickey malt is used in it, and I can detect it in the smell. The taste had a small hint of whiskey malt to it, I thought, but had a creamy sweetness to it as well. The only thing that was a ""let down"" to the beer was that it wasn't really thick in the taste, like most are. Don't get me wrong though, it was still really friggin awesome. That aids the drinkability though, IMHO. It doesn't leave you all full and bloated, and leaves you refreshed. If you see this, buy it, or leave more for me!!!"
"All I had are five year old notes on this beer, so its good to see it back in sampler packs...glowing brown amber appearance, clear. Small tea-like head of a yellowish hue. Laces in rings and latter, small dots. Good smell, caramel and Twix Bar chocolate mingling. Body is medium, slightly lighter than I remember it. The flavor is entirely pleasant, beginning with obvious malt tones. The balance is good for a beer, astringent hoppiness finishes the impression -- a little more like an ESB. As a Scotch Ale, could be a little thicker and emphasize the malt qualities hinted at in the aroma. Drinkable brew..."
"Also my main reason for buying the new sampler. Pours a very deep maroon color, with a tan head. Has a very different smell. Smells sweet, but robust, probably from the barrels that were used in the aging process. Has a nice roasted carmel taste that really shifts into a hops finish very smoothly. This is an extremely satisfying beer, that is worth buying the sampler to get. My only negative reaction to this beer was the label. Why can't Boston Beer have Sam in a kilt on the label? Is that too much to ask? OK, maybe it is."
"Drinkability: Very good, although I keep burping up hop leaves."
"Beautiful red hue when held to the light, otherwise there is lovely brown influence as well. Clear. The head is foamy and light beige in color, about a half finger in height. It fades to big soapy bubbles; there was some spotty lacing as the beer was quaffed. The nose had a modest aroma, strength-wise, the bouquet expressed hints of chocolate malts that are lightly toasted with a whisper of smoky-caramel at the end. There is something mysterious about the aroma, the invitation is frank, and I gladly took a sip. The mystery is solved, the palate is well developed with chocolate malts upfront, slightly dry, a note of earthy, herbal, spicy hops are found in the middle plus a vague smooch of sweetness and the finish is smoky, dry, chalky, with a hint of toasted malts, wood, and peat. This is far drier than I expected and the maltiness is not as big or as sweet then Id prefer. But the subtle complexity of this Scotch Ale cannot be ignored. Medium in body, a bit less bulk than there should be, low carbonation; the mouthfeel is slick and thinned by a lack of malt. This aspect of the beer is ordinary at best. This is a plenty tasty beer, Id recommend you find this dandy, pop the cap, pour, enjoy."
"Pours a deep red amber with a big off-white lacey head. Roasty sweet malt flavors are in front with an almost smokey thing going on too. Spices and hops add solid balance to the brew. Smooth, but a tad thin in feel. Certainly a fine beer which am glad to see again."
"Pours a deep clear mahogony with a nice hefty off white head. Good strong malty aroma, mostly of caramel. The taste really shines here. Some dark fruity flavors that give way to a sweet malt with a slightly meaty character, a bit like Bovril. Some hops round thing out in the finish, balancing this out slightly. The mouthfeel is fairly thick with with a syrupy aftertaste, but as far as scotch ales go, this is quite drinkable. An overall good mild scotch ale. If you enjoy this, try a heartier scotch ale like McEwan's."
"J"
"The beer on the pour appears deep dark amber with a modest light tan head, frothy and the lace a fine sheet. Nose is heavy, strong malts and hops a beer that fights back, start is sweet, malt laden and the top middling in feel. Finish is spiteful in its acidity, hops personable in their spiciness, very dry and a good drinking beer all around."
"560"
"Tasted: 04/08/03"
"Deep amber/copper with reddish tints; and a nice creamy head that dissipates quickly leaving only a thin collar of foam. Minimal, and 'slightly touched-by-roast' malt aroma, as expected for style. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Smooth, malty flavor showing an edge of peat smokiness and a touch of English hop bitterness. Well balanced. Finishes with a malty sweetness and light bitterness. Very smooth and drinkable. An excellent example of a full Scottish ale! Scotch ale as beer afficianados see it? Hmmm? However, nicely done."
"One of the best scotch ales ever. Sorely missed."
"[ Edit: now available in the Sam Adams Brewmaster's Collection 12-pack ... but you only get 2 of them. )"
