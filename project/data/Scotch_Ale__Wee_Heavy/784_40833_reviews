"Roasty and sweet are the two biggest flavors for me. Very tasty would buy again."
"Lovely dark amber with a persistent golden head. Nice blend of malts in this brew -- and you can really taste the smoke. A faithful take on Scottish-style ale."
""
"Lacking in taste...just mediocre for me."
""
"Overall: A good beer, but not what I'd consider a traditional Scotch Ale due to the assertive roasted notes. Nonetheless, a good beer from a brewing company I'm anxious to try more from."

"Stop the mandatory reviews please"

"This is an easy brew to drink....I believe it's one of the most under-rated breweries out there."

"I have tasted my way around Scotland several times and this is the closest to good Scottish ale that I have found in the U.S. so far. I love the sweet full taste. I purchased it locally but when I went back for more it was no longer there. I need to see more of it. Hopefully that will be soon."

"Tyranena Sheep Shagger Scotch Ale ---4/5."

"O- This beer overcame its sweetness and poor looks with big flavors. It's a good one."
""
""
""
"This is a complex and flavorful brew that extends itself well beyond your archetypal scotch ale. The synergy could be slightly better, but I must give it a nod for the slightly chocolately, nutty finish, which I found to be especially pleasing."

"Would I buy this beer again? Maybe."
""
"Overall: A very tasty, and fairly big, everyday Scotch Ale. If the finish dried up a little more and played against the core sweetness, this would be sublime."

"An interesting tasting scotch ale; a little different than what I expected. My initial sip wasn't as malty and sweet as I come to expect with this style but was actually quite nutty. It was good, don't get me wrong but was just a variation on what I am used to with this style. Since it is a pretty affordable beer with a solid abv, I would probably buy it again but it wouldn't be the first thing I reach for when looking for a Scotch Ale."

"*As the beer warms coffee makes a big presence in both the smell and taste to add another tasty element to this already complex beer."

"Smells amazing, tastes great. This is one of the Tyranena brews worth seeking out."

"I didn't know this was a winter seasonal, so this bottle is probably 7-8 months old. I liked it anyway, nice scotch flavors with plenty of malt and some smoky peat. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"D - Started off promising, albeit a tad off-style, but the flavor was a touch bland for me to get really excited about this. Pretty easy to drink, and with not much alcohol at all. I prefer the added depth of the barrel-aged version, but this isn't a bad beer, especially at its price point."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid Scotch Ale to drink for a long time."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's got a good flavor to and its very easy to drink. It's good to have when you're thristy and is perfect for any occasion. Definitely will be buying this again in the future!"
"Carmelly brown pour with short lived head, no lacing. Smell is rich werther's-like toffee malts. Taste is toffee and brown sugar, molasses, and roasted malt, perhaps even some chocolate notes. Earthy hop appears at the end to refresh palate. Medium-smooth and velvety mouthfeel, with a bit of carbonation to tickle. Quite delicious."
"Overall- Very good, but doesn't put forth anything particularly memorable. Mild for the style, but hits the right notes. Extremely well-balanced and tasty, ABV is deceptive. I'd definitely pick it up again if I had the opportunity, but probably not as a regular thing."
"Sheep Shagger ale not only has a funny name but is relatively decent. The beer poors a rich amber with thin off white head that is not lacing. The smell is mostly hints of caramel malt. The taste follows suit. The mouthfeel is medium body with subtle carbonaiton. Overall it is a good scotch style ale."
"I really enjoyed this beer, even though it departs from all examples of the style that I've had."

"O-I didn't care a whole lot for this beer. It was alot bigger than I would have liked."
""
"Taste: Awesome; instantly one of my favorite beers. This is a scotch that isn't too sweet but is severely malty; balanced with a decent body, but not thick and is hopped to a decent crispness. I love the toffee, woody, vanilla, maple-esque tones. A definite showcase of how using different maltsters (and top-notch brewers) can effect a beer. Love it."
"On tap at Twenty Tap in Indy. Poured a very nice deep brown with red tinges, and some nice head, though little lacing. Very deep malty scent with a very earthy and jerky hop undertone at the end. Big caramel flavors! Thick and malty, very sweet, with some nice peat underneath as well and a bit of jerky hop finishing. Goes down well, but there is some alcohol heat."
""
"Big bourbon aroma. An interesting taste with some sourness. Still a good drinkability at the end of a meal and tasting. Dark colour with generous lasting off-white head.Above average mouthfeel.Liked the vanilla, long whiskey finish.Decent for the style."
""
""
"Does have a stout quality to it, but that's not really a negative. The feel is really good and the aromas are really good as well. This is a quality scotch ale and shows no booziness that they sometimes can do"

"hazel brown with a nice 1 inch head that slowly faded lacing up the sides. Much visible carbonation and a noticeable hissing sound. Smell was very nutty, and I mean that literally. Smell was of nuts and caramel with a hint of hops and just a touch of alcohol, smells like its gonna warm you up. The taste was very very sweet, syrupy and lots of dark fruit flavors. Very sugary sweet, no real taste of alcohol, which at 7.5%abv is a nice touch."
"O - A decent Scotch Ale, but this is no Dirty Bastard. Sorry."
"Not bad, but almost too overmalty for my palate."
"Another situation where I enjoyed the BGW barrel-aged version of this and just had to try the regular version. It pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, baked toffee, orange peel, and some light cocoa. The taste does not deviate much at all from this plan of attack, save for a slight increase in the orange character. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth-ish feel. Overall, a pretty nice scotch ale, one that does not disappoint, even if it doesn't necessarily impress, either."
"This one took me a bit by surprise, with rich, full, flavors and a great drinkibility for a larger beer. This is one of the better American Craft versions of the style that I've had and was quite enjoyable. This is a good one from Tyranena."
"Future outlook: My limited exposures to Tyranena have been quite positive, so it's too bad I can't buy them here. Can feel my appreciation for Wee Heavies/Strong Scotch ales really increasing recently."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!). Pours deep cooper with thin tan head. Aroma has nice sweet malts, some peat?, caramel and alcohol. Taste is similar. Medium bodied with a slick texture and smooth finish. The bourbon is not overstated-its provides some nice warmth as it goes down. To me, the star is the caramelley goodness of the beer. Mmmmm. I would love more of this"
"I would personally like to see a further developed caramel flavor, and a hair less roast/toast, but Sheep Shagger is quite good, and drinks pretty easily for a beer of this heft."
"D- Good, easy to drink beer. Could have a couple of these, but would probably get a little bored with it. Still good beer, just not my favorite here."
"Very nice. Everything is there that should be. I enjoyed this a lot. Something I would highly recommend."
"Overall a very tasty SA with an ABV that is hardly discernible."
"Poured into a tulip. Wonderful dark amber with very little head. Dissipates quickly to a ring around the glass. Nice malty smell. I get a little biscuit too. Taste is mostly malt with a little caramel and a clean finish. Well carbonated. Very easy to drink. It would be no problem to sit and work through a few of these."
"D- Fairly drinkable for being 7.3%"
"A fine beer, kinda light, but with veritably no traces of alcohol in the taste."
"D. Easily consumed. A nicely rounded scotch ale brewed in the heart of America. Well done."
"The taste starts super malty sweet with a caramel like syrupy texture. The middle lets some of the sweetness go for a little alcoholic warmth. The finish is some warm caramel and toasted, faintly nutty malts. This a ood representation of a wee heavy. One worth enjoying slowly."
"Soft coppery color. Bready and malty aroma-somewhat toffeeish and caramel like. Malty flavor upfront, maybe a kiss of hops. The toffee/caramel thing continues throughout the flavor. Just a faint smoke tinge though that may be more of the malt coming thru then anything. Silky mouthfeel. Nice Scottish ale for sure. One of the better US versions."
"Overall, a very good example of the style, and well worth trying."
"D - Quite drinkable, pretty smooth, and nothing offensive."
"Pours a reddish bronzish copper brown color. Thin film of white head floats at the top. Smokey malt with a whiff of booze hits your nose. Taste is earthy and slightly sweet up front. Very faint hints of vanilla and cherries. It dries out in the middle with a smokey and slightly sour flavor. Smokey and malty at the finish with a noticable boozey feeling on my lips. It does have some of the smoked malt characteristics of scotch whisky. This is a big beer. Moderately thick body, but the complex flavors and high abv mean this one is for sipping. I came in last night from the -5 degree weather and cracked one of these open. Hit the spot very nicely."
"A really nice example of the style. Drinks well and is highly recommended."
"Drinkability -- A good beer, but not one of my favorites, either for the style or for Tyranena. Came off more as a robust amber ale as it was lacking some rich caramelized malt flavor."
"This beer has an awesomely good mouthfeel. Silky smooth and slightly chewy. It is only low to moderate carbonation. Overall an awesome beer that I wish I could readily get."
"Drinkability: I had forgotten how well Tyranena does so many styles. This is an excellent easy drinking beer with an exceptional flavor. Well done."
"D - Out of all the Wee Heavies that I have had, this is one of the more easy ones to drink for sure. A great session beer for this style, perhaps the best. Very light on the palette."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Creamy and smooth medium bodied beer. The alcohol is not felt in the flavor or the mouthfeel. This is a very smooth and wiked beer nearing 8%. Kind of makes me grin sheepishly!"
"Mellow feel, malty sweetness, husky grains. Not getting any smoke or toffee notes typical of the style. Sort of basic, a very malt forward Scotch Ale, not a ton of complexity here. The abv is definitely hidden though. Can't really find much more to say about it unfortunately... not the best i've had from Tyranena, but a decent Scotch Ale."
"Drinkability - There's nothing better to cut through the winter chill than a nice slow sippin scotch ale. Thank the lord they make such a fine one nearby."
"Solid session beer."
"D: This is a nice and easy drinking beer. Not too heavy, while missing a bit of the intensity of other in the style, this is a nice brew that I would come back to and have a couple."
"One of the nicer Scotch Ales I've tried and likely to become a staple in my beer pantry."
"This one pours a dark, dark reddish brown with a light khaki head. It smells of woody hazelnut and dark malts. Definitely interesting and welcome aromas. It drinks pretty nutty and has a good rich hazelnut flavor to it. I was very surprised. It drinks medium bodied with light carbonation. You'd never know it was 7.7%. I would've guessed around 6%. This one is very drinkable. I don't like scotch ales in particular but this is a good one. It's definitely worth a try."
"This beer pours a murky pale brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and vanishes within seconds into a mere ring of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is of peat, caramel, nuts, and chocolate. The beer smells like a candy bar smoke with peat. I really like the uniqueness of this aroma. The taste has more caramel than the aroma. There is still a lot of peat, and a solid nuttiness. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a very silky texture, and fine carbonation. Overall, this is a really, really good scotch ale. I can see this becoming my go to beer for the style."
"Overall, I'm more of a fan of the Brewer's Gone Wild series from Tyranena."
"M/D: Medium body. Average carbonation that is a little too prickly on the tongue. ABV is not hidden to well, you can tell its almost 8%. Drinkability is average. Its pretty damn malty and something about the finish is off."
"D - Easy drinking for a scotch ale. Flavors are well integrated, albeit the sweetness perhaps can get to be too much. Not filling - ABV is pretty zingy as well."
"I believe I'll finish this six pack before I stand up."
"Overall a very nice beer. Super drinkable with huge flavors. Not surprising coming from Tyranena."
"d - Overall another decent Scotch ale. Some nice malt and dark fruits taste to it. I would have liked it a little better if it wasn't as boozy, but it wasn't overpowering. I would try it again."
"Very good beer. Glad to know the crew in Lake Mills is cranking out new stuff & even better to find out that it's as good or better than the old stuff. Keep it coming!"
"D - This is not the best scotch ale I've had to date but it's a solid offering from Tyranena. I would like to see the malts, toffee, and caramel notes turned up and a little less booziness but considering there is almost 8% abv, it's rather impressive."
"This stuff drinks down with amazing ease and drinkability. Way too smooth for nearly 8%. So watch yourself with this one or you may just find yourself really sheep shaggin'...??!?!!..."
"D= This beer was pleasant enough to want several and the ABV was well hidden. The main issue is that its not a wee heavy in my opinion. Sort of like a Scottish amber. It defies categorization really, but its very tasty."
"D - I wanted a six pack on the first sip. Very good. A fantastic example of the style and a delicious beer. The mouthfeel's smooth, soft texture aids in drinkability."
"D: This is a sipper that gets better as it warms...great post dinner beer on a cold night"
"D: Highly drinkable, nice 7.7% brew. Could have a few but inevitably the sweetness and ABV would catch up with me."
"Dusky looking mahogany. Thin tight cap of dirty white froth. Lacing is quite sufficient. Aroma is malty and meaty and rich. Just the way I like my Wee Heavy. On the buds, take all that is on the nose...the richness, the maltiness, the beefiness and add some nice does of chocolate to the equation. The result is very good. Luxurious feel to it. Creamy and smooth. Very easy to drink. One would never guess we're approaching 8% with this beer."
"Despite protestations on the label copy about the meaning of ""sheep shagger", Colonel Carmichael is looking awfully familiar with his lamb."
"This ale pours a clear dark copper/light amber with a quickly diminishing off-white head. The aroma is very complex; sweet caramel, hints of roast and chocolate and there is also a bit of tobacco/earthy aroma. The flavor is initially loads of bittersweet malt with just a bit of carbonic bite. The flavor transitions to a slight roast with a bit of smoke and pleasant slightly dry finish. The carbonation is moderate with medium-full body. Overall a very complex, flavorful, well crafted brew. I bought a 6er and am glad - I will very much enjoy sipping each one."
"Looks like a cloudy glass of Single Malt Scotch. Very earthy aromas and a mild, but lingering, taste. Slight smoke hints and mild malts hide the 7.7% ABV. A pretty tasty effort from Tyranena. I still like Rocky's Revenge better, but certainly a good brew from Lake Mills, WI."
"Pours a slightly murky ruddy copper with garnet highlights. Small, wispy, off-white head. Not much lacing. Nose of toasted malts, sugary fruits, singed caramel, smoky meats and peat bog. Toasted malts quickly give way to sweetish caramel and toffee. Slight earthy, smoky edge to an otherwise sweet palate. Mild grassy, herbal notes in the finish. Lingering malt sweetness (molasses). Medium body with a with a slightly under carbonated feel. Very nice though!"
"A flavorful beer - not overly complex - but nice flavors."
"this is quite easy to drink and not overpowering in any way. very well rounded!"
"D-This is an enjoyable beer. Definitely would reach for these if they were more available by me in the winter...well done.."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a strong malty body. Goes down quite easily with mellow bubbles. Overall, a nice robust scotch ale for the cooler months and a great addition for Tyranena if I do say so myself. Hope this will be around next year!"
"D- easy drinking beer from a style that i find fairly easy to enjoy. something ill be grabbing again before its off the shelves until next year. i liked this one."
"D: This is another winner from Tyranena, a complex Scotch ale with loads of flavor. This is a nice sipping beer for a cold night. Highly drinkable and highly delicious."
"Unless you despise malt bombs, this should be on your list."
"drinkability: good"
"Overall, this is an easily drinkable beer. There are spots where it could be improved upon, but overall worth the opportunity. This is balanced and tasty, without ruining the palate."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth, though the bite of carbonation seems to be a bit strong for the style."
"Definitely one of the best Scotch ales I've ever had. Nice appearance; copper/brown. Nice head that dissipated quickly. The nose promises caramel, butterscotch, vanilla and bourbon. The mouth delivered with all of the above plus a little sweetness and a ton of malt. Highly drinkable, the mouth feel is perfect, to me at least. Medium to heavy bodied, I could drink a lot of this!"
"Medium to full bodied, thick, viscous, palate coating, malty goodness. A genuine ""malt bomb."""
"Lowly carbonated, but what is there is persistent. It's not a muddy, smoky peat monster. It's earthy tones are evident, but there is a balancing brightness here too, and that helps make this tremendously quaffable."
"Balance! This one delivers tasty goodness sip after sip, without fatiguing your senses. It was great washing down Friday Fish Fry. Last swallow was as good as the first."
"D- drank most of a pitcher pretty quickly, well worth it."
