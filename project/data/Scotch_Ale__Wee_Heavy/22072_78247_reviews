"Odd malt profile that doesn't match up well with the barrel. A rare miss for Revolution's barrel program."

"O - 5 - I REALLY enjoyed this beer. I can't believe how much bourbon they were able to impart into this beer. It's one of the most delicious brews I've ever had, hands down."
""
"Lots of bourbon...tobacco...leather and a bit of chocolate.   One of the best wee heavy ive ever had...period."
"One of my favorite barrel aged revolution beers, hope to see this bottled regularly."
"Pours dark brown with very little lift making it through this beer. Smell has aromas of English toffe, candi sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, oak and a bourbon alcohol finish. Taste follows the nose with toffee malt and candi sugar first to hit the palate. Moderate caramel sweetness and a heafty alchohol presence dominate the midsection with notes of charred oak barrel, vanilla, and brown sugar. More alcohol and bourbon in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick wit moderate carbonation and an alchohol bite in the finish."

"Overall, doesn't look that great on the pour, but wonderfully smooth and beautifully balanced."

"Overall - Overwhelmed by bourbon.  You only get a glimpse of the scotch ale at the beginning, then all bourbon."

"Smooth, full body with medium carbonation."

"This is an extremely boozy strong ale. It was delicious. It really sets the tone for the evening."
"O – Bourbon bomb that is well balanced and extremely tasty. The folks at Revolution are quickly turning into my favorite brewery."
""
"Very smooth, tasty beer but the smell and finish were almost sickly sweet."

"In my opinion, a solid 4.25+. Definitely would enjoy trying this again in the future."
"I've not had a ton in this style that are barrel aged but the ones I've had were all much better than this. The smell is nothing but bourbon. The mouthfeel is just flat, zero carbonation and not a huge amount of flavor. There was no head on this one. Glad this was something a friend shared with me and I didn't seek it out."

"I think this beer is world-class, like most of Revolution's beers are.  Very balanced, sweet and boozy (quasi barleywine-ish) yet very drinkable and a joy to savor."

"O: While I am a fan of bourbon as well as beer, this comes in second place to Backwoods Bastard for me, which is itself in second place to Wulver. Given my inability to find much beer under the bourbon, combined with the serious alcohol heat that poured out of this as it warmed, it's not a favorite for me. Age might do wonders for this beer, however, taking off the boozy edge and allowing the malt to come forward."

"John, what have you done? You told me this was really good…then sent me one. It’s like telling me about the great plate of scallops at the place down the street, then telling me they’re closing tomorrow. Revolution has been hit or miss for me & this is one excellent hit."

"Revolution crafted a really good BA Scotch Ale here."

"Overall - An excellent bourbon barrel Wee Heavy. A do think it is slightly hot/boozy across the entire range of temperatures, and a tad thin on body, but has some really good qualities. For me, even though I enjoy it, I would personally have a hard time buying again based on the fact I can get the much better Wulver for less money. I don't think anyone would be disappointed in this purchase though. I suggest trying."

"Yeah, they're not tapping last year's BCS for a few hours, but, whatever, there's a barrel-aged Scotch ale from Revolution.  We win.  Period.  Anyway, this stuff pours a clear ruby topped by a short finger of light sandstone foam.  The nose comprises deep bourbon, toffee, light dark greens, and a bit of mild buttery biscuit.  The taste holds notes of whiskey, caramel malts, light chocolate, mild dark greens, and some brief flashes of oak.  The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this is just as good as assumptions would lead you to believe it would be.  Very good times, indeed."

"Good barrel aged scotch ale. Lots of bourbon flavor."
"Another nice Deep Wood Series beer from Revolution."

"Overall, a wonderful beer that I did not want to stop drinking. Hides its booziness quite well."

"Served on tap at the brew pub. Appearance is a dark reddish brown with decent clarity, short white head. Nose is bourbon forward with heavy vanilla character and marshmallow. Not getting much from the base beer. The flavor is similar with huge vanilla notes, mild smokiness, and more vanilla. The flavor isn't ever boozy, but very bourbony. Mouthfeel is smooth and mellow. Overall, very tasty but would've liked a little more malt character."
""

"A barrel aged wee heavy that is as smooth as the Fonze. The vanilla notes really shine through. If baby Jesus had a floor this would be it. After my first sips I recall hearing the Beatles on my head. I could add a bunch of other beer Mumbo jumbo but I don't feel it appropriate because this was tasty. You can sort of taste the alcohol but at 9.7% it is not that noticeable."
"Overall: An incredible scotch ale."
""
"Overall - Very fine example of a bourbon barrel aged scotch ale. If they bottle it, I'll definitely pick some up. Good stuff!"

"O - A nice BA Scotch Ale that has been aged on Woodford the best I've seen from any brewery. The booze is hidden well, but still there, and the base beer is complimented by the alcohol. Glad I was able to try this one!"
""
"It would be great if they had this more often. This was excellent and was really aided by the bourbon barrel."
"Deep aromas of bourbon and peated malt, mostly bourbon though. Sweet brown sugar, vanilla, toasted oak, some light spirit fumes. The peated malt comes through more in the taste, rich with some earthy peat complexity, still identifiable as the base beer, with layers of bourbon barrel characteristics over the top. Rich and burly with a low to medium carb level. Slight alcohol bite in the finish, but it's tempered by the big malt sweetness, though not fully disguised. In the end the bourbon character slightly overshadows, but at least there was some nuance from the base Scotch Ale. Unique and recommended, this is a fine BA Scotch/Wee Heavy... can't say i've had many of those."
"D - This is another barrel-aged winner from Revolution. I don't normally like BA Scotch Ales, but this was delicious and I actually regret not ordering a full serving. Hopefully this is still on-tap next time I swing by the brewpub."
