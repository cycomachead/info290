A pleasant bitterness combined with roasted malts follows and overtakes the initial taste with a caramel flavor coming in last. A wonderful scotch ale.","Myotus","Mar 18, 2015"

Initial taste was sweet full lots of alcohol cause it was too cold. Let it warm a bit and I taste orange and caramel and a cookie like sweetness. Alcohol still there but much less astringent. Taste lingering on palate is earthy sweetness. Raisins and plums come to mind. This is a nice package. Pretty spot on for what I expect from the style, plenty of alcohol bite married to malty sweetness with a syrupy mouthfeel and a medium body. I think I'll have another.","Stebbimacdaddy","Feb 03, 2015"

The first taste was an intense maltiness with sweetness and a roastiness at the same time that ended with a slight bitter hop profile.  There was a sweet dark fruit and an almost chocolate and coffee aftertaste that lingered on my palate and was a tantalizing reminder of what was to come with each sip.  This was a very rich and deeply layered scotch ale that was like sipping a nice after dinner aperitif.  This creamy brew was a very satisfying and robust drinking experience and a very well done scotch ale.","brurevu","Jan 27, 2015"

I know hoppy beers are all the rage with the kids these days, but there's a such thing as overdoing it. I couldn't taste any smoke in it, but I'm not sure I was supposed to either. In spite of my gripes, Dirty Bastard is very drinkable and the high ABV is masked well. Overall I like this one a lot, and I buy it frequently. This is so close to being an amazing beer, but the bitter:sweet ratio is just a little off for this style.","GerryPendry","Beers"

Taste is plum, molasses, a bit of roast bite and a little alcoholic burn.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side but it works with the flavors to allow them to linger in the finish.

Nose of brown sugars, toasted malts, figs, peat, and strong alcohol.  Flavors are sweet up front, tons of malt backbone with brown sugar and caramel.  A lightly fry peat flavor is present with come dark fruits, light herbal hops, and alcohol warmth on the back.  A barley wine drinkers Scotch ale.

4.25,5.2,,,,,,"It's a nice looking beer.  A deep mahogany with beautiful ruby highlights.  Low head, minimal retention, spotty lace.  The smell is closest to what I typically associate with BSD's, but not quite as potent.  Flavor is long and lasting, evolving over time.  I can sense the alcohol throughout, but it but only really feel it slightly on the back end.  Otherwise it's primarily a dark fruit.  Maybe some nutty character?  No smokiness.  Nice medium-bodied with a hint of carbonation in there, although nothing is visible.  This is a treat.","Andrew041180","Beers"

4,-1,,,,,,"Bottled 07/17/2014:  Aroma and taste definitely open up as the ale rises to room temperature.  A dark and mildly vinegary aroma.  Taste has notes of prune and brown sugar or light molasses, plus a very mild spiciness.  Very subtle hops are complemented by a sweetish, roasted malt whose character is a bit elusive at first but which comes more to the fore in the early finish, with a note of walnuts in the end (which I recognized after reading another review).  Finish is moderately drying, but the alcohol is not overly dominating; there are slight nasal alcohol fumes with exhalation.   Overall, this brew is a nice change from my usual fare and from one of my favourite breweries, but I find it a bit too dominated by dark fruit for my taste, and this year's batch doesn't seem as tasty as last year's.  The label depicts what appears to be Freddy Krueger with a nose-ring and tartan cap.  —Reviewed on 30 October 2014","BubbleChamber","Oct 29, 2014"

Compares really well to other American Scotch Ales. It is the signature beer of one of America's greatest craft breweries. Be warned though, the alcohol effect is definitely wee heavy, but does nothing to detract from the overall taste and mouth-feel. And lastly, if you should be lucky enough to land a sample of Backwoods Bastard, bow down and pay homage to the beer gods, for you will be blown away.","Abinlp","Sep 20, 2014"

Founders' Dirty Bastard is one of the finest wee heavies I've had the pleasure of drinking in my 8 years on this site, with a beautifully bold malt backbone that works perfectly with the smooth mouthfeel and earthy hop finish. This is not one of my favourite styles, but like all of Founders' offerings (at least - the ones I've tried so far), I'd be more than willing to pick up a sixer at some point in the future, as this is a quality malt bomb that is sure to be a crowd pleaser. A fabulous brew to ring in my 700th BA review.","thehyperduck","Jul 25, 2014"

3.9,-3.5,3.75,4.25,3.5,4.5,4,"Out of the bottle it pours a very nice, dark amber color. Although it pours out a nice head, it has no staying power and little to no lacing. Smell-wise it was rich and aromatic with hints of almonds, distinct roasted malt, and even slighter hints of caramel. It felt thick and bold sloshing around, not watery at all - very bold, but it did leave a strong aftertaste I didn't quite like. As far as the taste, I think it was bogged down with the overpowering flavor of burnt malt, rather than a lighter roasted flavor - it just took away something from what was otherwise a pleasant experience. Overall, it was outstanding and I was saddened to only have had two of these.","jjamadorphd","0"

3.32,-17.8,4,3.75,3,3.75,3,"Pours out a ruddy brown with a thin ring of head. Smells of toasty malts, cane sugar, dried fruits, and grape juice. Flavor is chewy, malty, toasty. Way too much estery fruitiness for me (more of an American yeast profile than anything British). Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected/hoped. Carbonation is great: scrubs the tongue, but not too active. Overall, I like elements of this beer, but the fruity esters are overbearing.","goochpunch","Jul 05, 2014"

I would say the I prefer Dark Horses Scotty Karate over this one slightly though. It think the hops are a bit too much and I really like how much they tone down in Backwoods Bastard (my favorite Founders beer).

An excellent looking beer and completely true to the style. Excellent. Scent begins with rich dark fruit, raisins, plum and figs, with an equally rich malty character, alongside aromas of caramel and hints of banana bread. A moderate aroma of alcohol is also present. An excellent aroma profile, rich, sweet, malty, and strong. Flavor begins strong and assertive, with a strong hit of sweet malt, with rich flavors of caramel, dark fruit, especially raisin and prune. This moves into some roasted malt flavors, balanced by the same excellent caramel sweetness and some smokey flavors and faint alcohol. On the finish the caramel sweetness continues, but is joined by a stronger alcohol presence and a stronger roasted malt bitterness and a faint touch of hops, very low, that is quite nice. Aftertaste is roasted malt and some slight nutty flavors. Faint cinnamon-like flavors are present in the background at low levels throughout. An excellent, deep, rich, malty, sweet, true to style scotch ale flavor profile. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick, rich and chewy with a slight hint of alcohol warmth and a low level of carbonation. A good, true to style, rich, warming feel. Very nice for sipping. Overall this is an excellent scotch ale. It has a fantastic aroma, an amazing flavor profile and an excellent mouthfeel that aids the drinking. An excellent beer from Founder's.","Auraan","0"

Some sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle. Spotty lacing is seen with each sip. Lots going on with the aroma with a hint of caramel, dark fruits, malt and 'boozy'. The taste has a lot going on as well with dark fruit (plum and maybe fig), caramel and roasted malts with a light hint of licorice. Perfect carbonation. The finish is a bit hoppy and dry.

4.19,3.7,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"This scotch ale pours a deep brownish mahogany hue with a very slight off white head that leaves a thin film and substantial lacing. The aroma is deep, rich, and sweet. Lots of burnt sugar caramel and toffee notes plus a little vanilla and alcohol. It is definitely a thicker side of medium bodied beer with lots of coating sweetness. The flavor is amazing. Lots of rich malts following the profile set up by the nose. There is a little bitterness on the tail that just makes one want to dive back in for another sip of the awesome caramely malts on the front end. This is a great example of this style and always a favorite from one of my favorite breweries.","lochef81","Beers"

Similar to doppelbocks like Ayinger Celebrator and Weltenburger Asam-Bock, but with more bitterness when fresh. (I've tried one from the old bottle and bitterness was very low. The beer reminded me of English strong/old ales and classic Scotch ales from Scotland.) Nice winter warmer, especially if you want to take a break from imperial stouts.","hansavijaticar","Feb 07, 2014"

The smell was almost of chocolate which I like because it didn't taste like chocolate... Some of the best whiskeys also smell like chocolate. Im assuming its because its a "scotch style ale". If you like strong beers of good quality try this.. but as their saying goes. Its not for the wee lads.. so be prepared!","Warmonster","Beers"

No lacing and average level of carbonation, certainly a harder task with a beer of this size and malt complexity. The aroma has smokey notes with a shadow of caramel and plums. Reminds me of some flavors from Marris Otter. On the front end the alcohol warms the mouth with toffee, plum like flavors following. Finished with a light puckering bitterness that holds a noble, East Kent Goldening spiciness. Again, Founders created a winner for this style and would be my benchmark.","Hoperator","Dec 07, 2013"

Smells like...Grape Nuts cereal. And that's a good thing, in this case. Nutty, crackery, slightly caramelized malt with a tiny hint of hops at the end. Can't wait to taste this, with a nose like that...and I am not disappointed. Sweet, crackery caramel malts are all over the place, with warming alcohol hiding in the background between a pinch of bittering herbal hop at the end. Mouthfeel is full but smooth, a bit sticky.

A somewhat subdued earthy, malty nose with hints of caramel, maple, wood, toffee, and a touch of herbal perfume as it warms. The complex taste is rich and malty with lots of caramel and brown sugar along with hints of maple, dark fruits, wood, molasses, butterscotch, vanilla, and a distinct herbal, piney note that I've tasted with Heather beers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated, slightly syrupy, with a subtle warming burn on the finish. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Overall, this is not a style I'm really familiar with, but as always, Founders leaves me wanting more.","beerdrifter","Jun 09, 2013"

Not too alcoholic and not too sweet. The 8.5% is perfect and the beer is just heavy enough without being pretentious. Very highly recommended.

Nose is strong of molasses, raisins, prunes, and a bit of Scotch smokiness. Taste is well-balanced, with molasses and figs coming through most prominently. Overall a great beer, as Founders is want to make, and a great example of Scotch ale.","smooth_aleing","May 09, 2013"

Let's just say the smell alone would probably turn me off. Taste is sweet and malty with a slight sting and bitterness. The alcohol aftertaste lingers. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. A lot of carbonation that dissipates over time. Overall, this is an alright brew. I don't think I'd go out of my way to get it again though.

Quite complex and just the right amount of decadence to be an excellent after-dinner beer.

For a beer overall though this is some good stuff, very complex taste, the fruity character is reminiscent of a Belgian ale, but the slight smokey peat taste sets it apart. Not bad for the price per six pack, will definitely purchase again. Thanks Founders, you have yet to let me down.","MaineBrewing","Jan 22, 2013"

The first thing that hits the palate is a very sweet, brown-sugary scotch taste. Don't mistake this as an indication that the 8.5% ABV isn't masked well, for this is quite the contrary. Near the middle there is an odd hop presence that falls somewhere between the "earthy" and "grassy" area of the spectrum (excuse my ambiguous terminology; I'm not well-versed in specific hop varieties enough to accurately diagnose it beyond that). Each sip taste a bit different, for I just tasted an almost milkshake chocolately note that I've never found before, which itself is a testament to the devious sweetness of this heavy brew. Not much carbonation here gives rise to a "syrupy" texture with a creamy mouthfeel and oddly wet finish. Everything here is really well balanced, and in order.","Tomhet","Jan 03, 2013"

The taste is malty at first but the hops lingers for quite a while after you put the glass down. A six pack was about 14 bucks which I think is this beers only downfall. It is good but not good enough for me to lay down this much money for it again. There are many beers as good or better for a few bucks less. I find Yards ESA is comparable in style and flavor for about 10 bucks a six pack. Over all it is worth a try.","Uniobrew31","Dec 21, 2012"

4.02,-0.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Deep mahogany brown with a slight haze in the glass, a quick pour gives a thin head of tiny bubbles that dissipate fairly quickly. The smell is of all malt and just what a scotch ale should be. Caramels dominate with a bit of chocolate and bready notes in there as well. A sugary sweetness and touch of alcohol are also present. The taste is similar to the smell with the strong caramel maltiness as the base. Surprisingly this beer is not as sweet as I would have expected given the smell and the style as there is a significant amount of bitterness, with little in the way of hop flavor to balance the malt. Beyond the caramel there is a bit of dark fruit and earthy yeast character that add to the complexity of this beer, alcohol is also present but it is restrained and seems just right for this style. This is a big, rich and creamy beer that floats along the tongue leaving a tingle and slight alcohol numbing character. Overall this is a very solid example of the style, I personally would have liked tit to be a bit sweeter throughout but that is a small complaint as this is still a good beer.","fank2788","Nov 03, 2012"

The body was a dark mahogany color with moderate carbonation visible and a huge amount of "floaties." The nose presented with smoke, roasted nuts, rich caramel and even a hint of dark fruit. A very robust nose to say the least. The taste had a lot going on. I got nuttiness, caramel malt, brown sugar and then smoke. There was also a bit of fruit in the background as well. The booze made a quick appearance at the end of the sip. The body was bigger than I'm used to seeing for the style with lower than expected carbonation. The finish was long with nuttiness and smoke. This could be one of the best beers of this style that I've had. All of the flavors worked with each other and it was a great sipping beer. I would definitely have this beer again.

Incredibly clean nose with notes of caramel, toffee, carob, brandy, and dates. Flavor is unsurpassed in balance, intensity, complexity, and the long lasting finish. All the flavors of malts, dark fruits, treacle, and a hint of spice from the alcohol melds perfectly on my palate. Touch of roast in the finish too, an unexpected surprise. Prickly carbonation with this heavy bodied hitter. I would prefer slightly less carbonation. Overall, this is quite the dirty bastard with whom to drink. Cheers!","DmanGTR","Jun 28, 2012"

Enjoyed straight from the bottle, chilled to approximately 42 degrees, the taste is extremely satisfying, not as harsh as the 8.5% ABV would imply! The smell is sweet with a definite twinge to it, reminiscent of Barley wine style ale!

4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall: I love these beers. It was great to have both at once. The base beer is one of the better scotch ales I’ve had. The barrel aged big brother is sweet, smokey greatness that any fan of big beers, scotch, bourbon, LIFE ITSELF ... will love. Seek these out. Enjoy them.","Number45forever","Feb 10, 2012"
3.91,-3.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep dark amber color that is clear but difficult to see through. Has a nice one finger of a smooth creamy light brown head. There isnt much on the nose but it very malty, similar to a red ale, also has a lot of caramelized dark fruit flavors. Taste is smooth and not as heavy as it looks. A complex malt profile consists of dark fruits and caramel and various spices. This beer drinks rather well for 8.5%. This is a good Scottish ale that I have had before and will likely have again, it wont disappoint.","TwelveOunces","Feb 10, 2012"
4.17,3.2,3.5,4,4,5,4.5,"O: Surely, I'm no expert on what a wee heavy should taste like - but for what it's worth, this is one of the most drinkable high(er) alcohol beers I've ever had. It's amazing how the complexity doesn't hinder its drinkability, either. Big thumbs up.","ThisWangsChung","Feb 09, 2012"

Barely translucent, some sediment is visible towards the bottom of the glass. Yeast? The aroma is very decadent with a maltiness dominating amongst raisins, pineapple, and maple candy. Taste - wow - very full bodied, yet the alcohol content is undetectable. It begins with a splash of sweetness, then hops rush in with a very nice bitter shot to the palate immediately following. I really like the way it coats the mouth fully and gives me that great warming sensation on the way down.

Poured it cold and it had no aroma and very harsh flavor. As I let it warm up the flavors and body began to show up along with some aroma. As expected a malty aroma, very sugary caramel and some bread notes. Heavy sweet taste with slight bitterness. Medium body with a bit thin creamy texture; flat carbonation and long finish. I’m not sure I really like this style of beer based on this selection.","mikeborglum","Dec 21, 2011"

Too much bitterness for a beer brewed in the notoriously hop-stingy Scottish style. My serving was too cold, which may make for an unfair assessment. I understand the relationship between coldness and the maintenance of many tap handles. Bitterness may be accentuated under these circumstances however. Good beer nonetheless.

Some sweet dark fruits hide on the nose behind the malt and booze with just a touch of citrus hops. Taste is very malt forward, with a touch of roastiness balanced with just enough bitterness. Plenty of sweet dark fruits as the flavor sticks around in your mouth. Carbonation is pretty low which works for this style. It drinks smooth with getting prickly or cloying. Overall a really nice brew, definitely worth checking it out but it won't blow your mind in any particular way.","quirkzoo","Beers"

Smells of caramel, toffee, faint bourbon, some molasses, and a touch of oak (though I don’t think this one is barrel aged). Taste is very similar, with caramel, scotch, vanilla, and some molasses coming through. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is smooth, and finishes only a touch dry.

The taste buds detect more charcoal and butterscotch but licorice remains a key ingredient. This stuff is carbonated with fine tingly bubbles that keep this very lively in feel with a solid medium body and some resinous qualities for sure.

Dark fruit and alcohol scents are noted in the smell. The malts are prominent in the taste - caramel with a slight smoky flavor. A piney hop bitterness comes through in the finish.

4.97,23,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Purchased a six pack of bottle at the local grocery store for 9.99. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a medium dark brown with a half inch of thick sticky head. Stick your nose in the glass and you are greeted with a wonderfully complex medley of smells. Biscuity malt and earthy peat are balanced with vanilla. The flavor is equally complex, and frankly, wonderful. It starts with the maltiness, but finishes with the smoky peat and alcohol of good scotch. The smokiness lingers. Overall, an exceptional complex standout. Definately worth picking up!","Sdesenberg","Sep 08, 2011"
4.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Fresh 8/11 from the cooler. Pours out a nice dark ruby color with a sticky looking head. The smell is rich and malty, slightly smokey, and mildly sweet, with some vanilla almost reminiscent of a fine Bourbon. Really a complex smelling beer. The taste is equally rich and malty, but has a nice citric, resinous hop base to balance it all out. Nice warming alcohol as you sip this one and it works well on a cool night like tonight. More flavors are coming forth, a bit of molasses from all that alcohol, but also some nicely roasted malts. Sure, there is a bit of earthy peat to it, but not nearly as much as some scotch ales I've had and I like it. Anyway, this is a big beer, one to be sipped and slowly warmed and the mouthfeel is pretty smooth too. Overall this is a nice Scotch ale that is making a great alternative right now to the shelves full of tired, but true Oktoberfest offerings.","Star80","Sep 06, 2011"

3.65,-9.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Not too bad, there is a lot of complex sugar character and the aroma is really very nice. Some of the dark sugar in the flavor profile is accompanied by a musty note that may be diacetyl or possibly even cardboard. In addition to that slightly unpleasant note it has a touch of alcoholic warmth that is, perhaps, understandable considering the strength but kind of messes with the smoothness that I would really like to see in this sort of beer.

Smell is rich caramel and malts; a little dark fruit (raisin) as it warms. The aroma is kind of muted, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Taste is more caramel, brown sugar, and malt, but the finish is mostly a not-so-pleasant hop bitterness. Carbonation is on the light end (not bad for the style, I guess), maybe a little lighter than I'd prefer. Medium bodied and a little hot on the finish.

Smells of dark fruits like raisins, malts, and alcohol. Maybe some light caramel aromas. Taste is of some malt flavors up front with some caramel and raisin like flavors on the finish. A bit of roasted malt bitterness after each sip. Mild carbonation makes for a smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this a a good beer all around.

I really enjoy this beer alot, very satisfying for those who like the flavor of dark fruits, molasses and malts, and still some hop gratification at the end of the sip - really a great, complex beer with a wonderful progression of flavors and nuances in every sip.

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, and very slight alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The flavor on this one was slightly complex and very well balanced. Very nice aroma going on here as well that keeps you coming back for more. A great brew for the style and a definite must try for anyone out there.","thagr81us","Apr 26, 2011"

4.03,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This pours like a really dark piece of bloodwood with a light khaki head that's two fingers tall and leaves big, chunky lace on the way down. On the nose there are caramel and toasted malts set against a definite background of alcohol. There are sooty and earthy notes here, almost like spent oil poured on a pile of leaves. In the mouth there is a large base of the caramel and toasted notes from the nose, but also some dark fruits come out. Buckeyenation said bourbon soaked figs and I think that accounts for both the dark fruit and the alcohol, which seems like it's there by design rather than by mistake. The body is full and the finish is long but conspicuously absent from the back part of the tongue, I guess due to the absence of notable bitterness. I like this beer a good deal, perhaps not a staple but something that is very good and easily enough had on tap when I'm at home in Michigan.","EricCioe","Apr 20, 2011"

The taste follows, focusing on the maple syrup and brown sugar, adding some molasses, vanilla extract, and a touch of cocoa powder. A distinctly sharp sweet bitterness (yeah, you read that right) comes in at the end. (Okay, maybe bitterness was the wrong word...just a bittery sharp twang o' sweet.)

Nice aroma just wish it was stronger. The taste is of chocolate milk, wet bark, light roasted malt and smoke and some brown sugar sweetness. Very nice flavors. Solid malt body, a bit chewy, decent carbonation, smooth, finishes with a light bitterness. A good scotch ale, not the heaviest nor flavorful but pretty darn good.

4.2,4,4,4,4,5,4.5,"Pours extremely dark reddish-brown, nice off-white head. Many carbonation bubbles floating up and sticking to the sides of the glass. Tons of sediment. Leaves some lacing. Smell is very malty, caramel, slight coffee-ish/roasty smell. Wow this is much better than I remember it being. The malts are excellent, a great chocolate/caramel taste with a bit of spiciness, a bit of dark fruit. That "cola" taste I always seem to get from scotch ales (maybe just the caramel?). The malts are definitely king here. You can sense a hint of the hops and the 50 IBUs but it just gets trampled by sweet malts. Mouthfeel gets an easy 5 from me, one of the most smoothest, velvety beers I have ever drank. I remember there being quite a bit of alcohol taste the first time I had it but this time I am getting none whatsoever. Drinkability, usually a beer of this style is kind of a sipper for me, but here before I knew it it's nearly gone. This is my 3rd time having it (twice in the bottle, once on-tap) and I enjoyed it the most this time around by far. Usual excellence from Founders, I'd love to try Backwoods sometime.","Chico1985","Apr 03, 2010"

There is nothing of it. But the six-pack albeit a bit boring is drinkable if not particularly worth seeking forth.

There was the afore mentioned pineapple from the nose, some dark cherry, banana, and the scotch/peet smoke that is typical of this style. There also was just enough hops to balance out the malt back bone and lend a little bitterness. The alcohol was very well hidden but started to warm after 2-3 gulps. Mouthfeel was virtually perfect.

It's a hard to drink beer, but you plunge through it because you paid $10 for a sixer. It would be a challenge to choke down more than one of these tonight.

Taste is pretty typical of a Scotch Ale or at least compared to the ones I've had. Taste is good, kind of malty I guess. Has some caramel that comes through in the taste as well as something else that is a little sweet. On my first taste of this one I got some alcohol but it was faint and I didn't get it after that.

The head is on the thinnish side, evaporates quick enough, lacing more persistent. Restrained nose of orange/lemon citrus, apricot pits, round malts alongside non-intrusive hops, pine resin, bread and a slight infusion of dried flowers. Medium-bodied, smooth with enough carbonation to keep a steady forward pacing. Semi-sweet with baking spices, orange peel, honey glazed bread, pine, none of these have the depth nor tenacity to overshadow the hops component. Never bitter, maltiness persists.

And then add some liqueur soaked cherry flavors, some charred bits in the finish, and then some hop in the finish. There is a bit of carbonation in the beer, it isn't flat, the mouthfeel is a bit oily, and the aftertaste has a tad bit of throaty burn from the ABV, but not over the top.

Smell is mostly sweet with malt and a bit roasty. Smells a bit of alcohol, this also is evident in the flavor and aftertaste, which maintains a boozey warmth and a bit of a sour whiskey-ish..well.. sourness (but not much, just enough to keep the sweetness from being that of, say, a doppelbock or such). A good amount of hop bitterness in the flavor, as well. There is a roasted quality to the flavor, a malty sweetness, some caramel-like sweetness and, again, a liquor-like feeling. Mouth is well carbonated and on the lighter side of medium. Its very easy to drink and quite refreshing.

Nose is oaky with hints of cherry and sweet maltiness. Roasted coffee and chocolate can be detected as well. A very complex and robust scent profile. Taste is quite rounded with a malty sweetness. Coffee, cherry, nut and flavors come through. Reall has scotch tastes to it: a smoky and woody profile fit for the harsh terroir of scotland. A medium-to-full bodied ale that has a long malty finish.

Felt heavy in the mouth, and carbonation was right. After a couple you could really tell that the alcohol content was high. Got a good buzz after two.

4.12,2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A dark amber color, with a beige head that dissolves away quickly to a film on top. The scent of sweet malt hits the nose immediately, there is a twinge in alchol in the middle of the aroma. That does not last long, and soon the sweet fragrance of dried fruit comes out, mostly of currants. The malt dominates the flavor at the front, then the fruity flavors of currants and cherries blends on to the palate. A slight bit of bitterness at the end, nothing to strong, mostly mild citrus flavor to balance out the malt. A heavy feel and the weight stays consistant all the way through. Feels very slick and a tad oily, but is very smooth. This is a cold weather beer, it warms you all the way down. You should sipp this slowly, with its strong flavor and aroma, plus a hearty feel.

The only negative was that, even keeping in mind its relatively high ABV, the taste and feel of alcohol was higher than usual compared to other beers, which affected its mouthfeel considerably and its taste a bit, as well.

Despite the heavy, roasted malt, this is a very smooth, creamy, dreamy brew. Extremely smooth. I can't express that enough. Full bodied, but still light on the tongue and throat. Starts out a little bitter, but finishes smooth and rich with a strong tasting, roasted malt aftertaste that makes you yearn for more and also my pipe (legal tobacco).

Virtually no head or lace to speak of. The aroma of this beer was made up of sweet caramel malts, light yeast notes, and a bit of wood. The flavor is dominated by smokey malt richness. Some sweet caramel notes followed by a big roasted, smokey malt flavor. A touch of hop bitterness is present at the end. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with light carbonation, leaving a lasting smokey taste on your tounge. Towards the bottom of the glass, it reminds me of drinking a Scotch and water. The flavor seems to become a bit muted by the smoke. I enjoyed the aroma and flavors that this beer presented, but the smokey finish seemed to detract from the overall experience. Made my mouth feel like I had sat next to a campfire for a few hours, directly in the line of the smoke eminating from the flame. A decent beer, but maybe just not my cup of tea.

Dark Crystal malt and slight plum aromatics are the strongest, with a mild herbal hop note and a earthy/yeasty scent in the background. Sweet caramel taste upfront, followed by a deep roasted flavor something like chicory. Aftertaste is long and drawn out, but not in any bothersome way. A lingering caramel sweetness gradually fades to a stiff roasty bite and sharp earthy yeast tones; finally met by a herbal hop flavor and balanced bitterness. Full bodied and lightly carbonated, it has a somewhat viscous mouthfeel that furthers the perception of fullness and allows a hearty residual sweetness without becoming cloying. It finishes very malty with dark fruit notes coming out more as it warms, eventually dryng out with the help of the ample hop prescence. This is strong and complex like a good Scotch ale should be, but it is also balanced well enough to retain an excellent drinkability.

Decent balance of malt & hops, and neither seemed to overpower the other although both the maltiness and bitterness were high. A strong but drinkable beer.","BeerCheese","Feb 11, 2007"

The alcohol flavor dominates this beer especially as it warms, like you actually are drinking scotch. Very potent but brings out a nice flavor for an aftertaste.

Taste, wonderful toasted sweet malt, immediately followed with balanced bitterness, imparting sort of a nutty dark chocolate flavor, how ever I would not describe this as syrupy or too thick.

4,-1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a murky brown with some burgundy hues under a thin tan head. Head quickly settles to a slick film which persists throughout the glass. The initial aroma is of assertive peat smoked malts, followed by faint notes of burnt caramel candy, dark wheat bread, raisins, black cherries and a touch of herbal hops. Carbonation is appropriately subtle resulting in a smooth, slightly oily and slick moutfeel. Just right for this style. Initial flavor leans toward the sweet side presenting burnt caramel, brown sugar, raisins and figs with a hint of chocolate. The hops and alcohol eventually emerge in the late palate and finish with a fairly crisp, dry bitterness and ethanol warmth.

Taste begins with a bite from the alcohol. Flavors of nicely toasted malt. Good balance from a light hoppiness in the center of the tongue. Clean, dark finish. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy (I mean this as a compliment; I like this style thicker) with light carbonation. Like a very thin caramel. Very good drinkability, although this style will sneak up on you if you're not careful. Contrary to my brother's analysis, I prefer Founder's to McEwan's, although both are excellent beers.

The first thing that comes to mind when the first taste is computed by my brain is COFFEE, with a quickly depleting toffee aftertaste. One rule of thumb I apply to moutfeel is its chugability. Not implying that I chug every beer I try, but to get an idea if this beer is something that lends itself to be guzzled easily. This beer is not condusive to chugging. The name Beer Advocate gives as an alternate name for Scotch Ale, Wee Heavy. Which fits this beer very well. A strong coffee like taste covers up any hint of alcohol.

Nice toffee malts and a bit of chocolate, as well as some raisins and a slight (very slight) smoked feel.

Dirty Bastard pours a hazy, deep burnt orange body with a very small beige head that quickly vanishes, leaving only a few spots of patch lace. Aroma is complex and inviting. Big malty notes of toffee, maple syrup, and molasses are complimented by a touch of charred wood and some prominent hop notes of spruce pine and citrusy grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied, almost chewy, with somewhat low carbonation. Taste is plenty malty for the style, with caramel, toffee, and molasses. Lots of burnt and roasty malt flavors as well as a note of smoked almonds. Surprisingly tart, with grapefruit and pine cone hops that suggest some Cascades hops in the mix. Some green apple notes add to the tartness. Alcohol is very well concealed. Malt character reasserts toward the finish, but this one is very well balanced, overall. Very tasty and highly drinkable.

Aromas of sweetish caramel and chocolate, with a rich, smoky, peaty accent and a whiff of Scotchy alcohol. Rich sugary malt up front, along with dark fruits (plums) and chocolate. Light smoky character throughout. Tannin-like bitterness leads into a bitter, woody finish with residual brown sugar sweetness. Big, thick, full, creamy, exquisite feel. A nice beer, and unlike most Scotch ales I've had.","alexgash","Feb 15, 2005"

The foamy topping dissipates fairly quickly leaving some scattering of lace to decorate the glass. Malty sweetness fills your nose with notes of dark fruits and a bit of chocolate. The fruits notes really stand out as this warms, pleasant but a bit simple overall. Chocolate covered fruits are tasted first before a hint of alcohol. There are roasty malt notes as well. Finishes with a roasty chocolate sweetness. About a medium body though a little thin but smooth. Easy drinking stuff here. Tasty brew that I could easily drink several off but not quite up there with the best in the style. Thanks for sharing tikkigodxxx.","meathookjones","Feb 10, 2005"

There is a nice candied malt flavor that waltzes nicely with a brandy-like quality. The real beauty is in the finish. It starts with sweet licorice intermingled with faint grape and woody notes.

Initial sweetness lasted through mid-palate and the drifted into a light slightly dry and bitter finish that lasted and left a pleasant mouthfeel.

Head showed reasonable retention, and laces with a layer foam pretty much wherever it has been. Aroma is a sweetly malty, with an alcohol undercurrent, as expected. Taste follows the nose, heavily malty, and the alcohol packs quite a punch on the back of the throat. A bit overboard in that department for me. Mouthfeel is okay, as I said, the alcohol character could be abit more subdued, but it grows on you (or numbs you, perhaps).

Flavors run deep-caramel, dark chocolate, fruitcake, black licorice, and plenty of twangy hop to keep it interesting. The finish continues long and deep-the only way to stop the delightful lingering flavor would be to get out some grub. I can see this standing up to something rich and meaty-perhaps a dry aged hanger steak accompanied by some fries, and a side of super fresh, crispy vegies of choice.

Deep, satiating waft of caramel drizzled biscuit along with hints of roasted barley and alcohol heat in aroma. As it warms, agreeable hints of almond and sweet cocoa surface and provide additional depth. Quite luscious and decadent, yet pleasantly clean aromawise. Maple syrup laced cookie sweetness upfront in flavor is complemented by gentle combination of roasted grain derived bitterness and equable, rounded dark caramel sweetness. Hop bitterness is paltry. Once roasted grain character fades residual sweetness surfaces towards the forefront of flavor, but remains judiciously both dextrin like and toasty in character, and thus avoids a cloying, sugary nature. A bit shy in body to support the malt profile, but a passable viscosity allows for ominously easy, fluid drinking. Whiskey macerated plum along with hints of diacetyl emerge late, adding a buttery dessert like richness, which finally signals beefiness to the palate. Finishes with fading notes of dilute carob and roasted nut. Dirty Bastard is a brew that improved tremendously as it breathed and warmed. Its rich, simple malt character is both satiating and appetizing... my belly craves more. With a firmer body this could be top notch. An impressive find.","marc77","Aug 22, 2003"

A lovely brew to look at as well, its hazy red hues are quite warming to behold. The flavor is of the malt richness, but it also provides a surprising level of hop bitterness. I was at once surprised and delighted by the beer after having my palate set up by two hoppy offering just before it. The fullness of this malty brew countered their light bodiedness quite well. The feel is rich and smooth and the drinkability is hampered rather more by the fullness of its body than by its high ABV.","AtLagerHeads","Aug 01, 2003"

Its floral with a hint of brown sugar & malt. The mouth is left with a floral hop-oil coat while a slight alcohol dryness or bitter settle in.

The flavor was of malt, caramel, slight bit of chocolate and a hint of raisin. A slightly lighter body than I would expect for this style and slightly sweet finish.
