On the nose, the '13 has a slightly stronger bourbon scent. That carries through to the taste as well, with the '13 also having a just a touch more caramel sweetness. This makes me assume they keep their bourbon barrels on a 3-year rotation like they do with KBS. Overall there's not much difference at all between the batches, now 5 months and 17 months old. Will be curious to see how much difference is present with a bigger lineup in a couple years.","HowardTheDuck","Mar 27, 2015"

4.94,13.8,5,4.75,5,5,5,"It is rare that I find a beer that just makes me want to have more than one at a sitting.  Backwoods Bastard is just that.  It is a very complex brew, similar to a good Scotch Ale but with a lot of subtle complexities.  Obviously that comes from the aging process in Bourbon Casks.  The taste is dark fruit, peat, chocolate and bourbon.   It has a little more hops on the finish than I generally like, but this is a world class brew.  Watch out however if you do engage and have more than a couple at a sitting because it is a 10.2% brew and they do sneak up on you.  Cheers.","sweet-maltman_1","Mar 23, 2015"

Also tastes very oaky from the barrel aging and slightly overpowers the peated scotch-y malts. Bourbon tastes are incredibly apparent as well and this is a very boozy tasting beer. The scotch ale style has some malty sweetness to balance this out but this beer could use some aging to open up more flavors and depth. Definitely a recommended beer though.","barfootbandit","Feb 08, 2015"

The base beer, Dirty Bastard, is a classic Founders offering but this barrel aged version ramps up the flavor profile to 11. There are blended tones of vanilla, cherry/dried fruit and rich caramel all adding up to a complex, deep, woody ale. A phenomenal beer that shows incredible restraint on the booziness - this strikes me as one to enjoy fresh. Such complexity that demands your attention at each sip. Goes down smoothly, with a balanced body that has the perfect full feel without being sticky or too thick.","Barnoloid","Jan 04, 2015"

The color is rich and with full body. Upon initial swirl again the booze eminates strong but there is a very rich oak smell. The head is full but quickly dissipates as expected with the high alcohol content. The thickness of the beer is impressive and hold well to the glass. The temperature at taste is about 45 degrees Fahrenheit and this is where I feel the beer is at its best. Has a great mouth feel and the aging of the beer really shows through. The taste is super crisp and bites like a good whiskey. Over the course of an hour the drink warms but holds up well. Overall it makes for an overall enjoyable experience. There is a little room for improvement as the color muddied a bit as it warms , but I do enjoy this beer. Founders rarely disappoints me and this one holds up strong.","JamGrover1983","Dec 27, 2014"

Admittedly, I am a little partial due to the fact that I grew up in metro Detroit, and was spoiled with the likes of world class breweries such as Founders and Bells. Now that I am living in South Carolina, I can appreciate their genius even more. Well it's Monday night.... what better way to usher in tedious Tuesday morning meetings than a midnight Wee Heavy that clocks in at 10.2%! I have tried many other Scotch Ales (Orkney, Old Chub, Innis & Gunn, McEwans, and more) but this one raises the bar for me. Dirty Bastard was always a favorite, but the barrel aging of this masterpiece sets it apart. The bourbon notes perfectly marry with the sweet caramel malts creating a warm and especially inviting beer. This is not for the faint of heart though. I would call it dangerously drinkable for those that can enjoy the aroma & warmth of bourbon and appreciate the syrupy splendor of sweet Scotch Ale. Give it to your friend that drinks Blue Moon and watch them recoil in horror. Share with an afficianado of spirits and you might find a convert. Best enjoyed in the company of a true Beer Advocate. This is simply too good to trifle with those that cannot appreciate it's perfection.","JohnnyI","Dec 22, 2014"

The first taste is a major surprise, having expected lots of harsh bourbon.  Actually, while the bourbon is present, the most amplified characteristic is vanilla, which sets in hard at mid palate.  Other flavors are something of a syrupy caramel, and of course a bit of alcohol on the finish.  The feel is wonderful.  Silky smooth.  My only regret was that I didn't drink it faster.  Not sure what happened, but after about 30-40 minutes the beer became sticky and cloying.  My ratings reflect the first half of the beer.  Still, I like to sip the heavy stuff, not sure I'd go back for this one.","Andrew041180","Dec 13, 2014"

Not much of a head and it quickly dissipates to nothing.  The smell leaves you with the impression that this will be a sweet beer, similar to a Southern Tier brew.  The taste strikes me as being an almost perfect balance of malts and bourbon.  The aftertaste is probably the best of any beer I have ever tried.  It leaves you with a sticky sweetness and a slight hint of oak.  The complexity is just amazing and if you sip the beer (as you should) by the end of your glass the temperature may be 10 degrees higher which accentuates even more flavors you may not have been conscious of before.  The more you drink this mysterious concoction, the more you appreciate such a well crafted beer.","Pourharddrinkslow","Nov 26, 2014"

Aroma showcases that bourbon barrel wonderfully with some soft bourbon, oak, and vanilla and it pairs well with the beer which offers raisin, fig, cherry and caramel.  Flavor is downgrade; decent but not excellent. Bourbon stand on top of a thick malt foundation that does not come close to offering anything close to the depth I got from the aroma. Dark fruits and caramels are there but they don't really jump out at me, what I get in that first wave of flavor is all that there is, nothing really builds or evolves. Nothing new really comes at me mid sip or in the finish. Maybe a touch of hops are there mid to end stream, but minimal. A fuller mouthfeel, no activity. Overall, this one underwhelmed me in all honesty. In part because my expectations were sky high. A decent beer nothing outstanding and definitely not worth the $18 I spent on it.","denver10","Nov 19, 2014"

Oak character is a bit one dimensional but not overpowering of the wonderful underlying beer.  Just enough hop presence to make this behemoth of a beer more drinkable.  I have a feeling this might have been a bit harsh young but is good now.  And probably would have been better in another year.  Definitely one that holds up to age.","gjoker321","Nov 14, 2014"

It takes away from the beer.","Jasonclick","Nov 14, 2014"

It's unfair for it to be so delicious, coming from someone who does not enjoy bourbon in the least. I'm incredibly happy that I got a few of these.

Oak, bourbon, vanilla, malted milk, caramel, cocoa and some alcohol heat fill the nose.  Aroma made me think of bourbon balls with that same dessert like sweetness to it.  Dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, malted milk, bourbon soaked dark fruits, and oak flavors in abundance make this a complex sipper of a beer.  Smooth creamy feel with a medium body and semi dry finish.  Great texture and feel lends to sipping slowly.  Could it be less boozy?  Sure.  Could it have less barrel presence?  Perhaps.  Bottom line, who cares.  This beer is big, bold and unapologetic and I dig it.","HopBomb515","Nov 13, 2014"

I have been a long time fan of good scotch. Later in life, as I have acquired a greater knowledge of craft beer and extreme beer styles, I have gained a greater appreciation for non traditional brews. As I'm nearing the end of this drink, I can tell that the potency of this brew is almost comparable to the feeling you get from drinking scotch. However, the malty sweetness in the aroma and the licorice  feel (a taste I have never enjoyed) is slightly disconcerting. As I said, I love me some good scotch but more for the bitter and spicy elements it brings. This scotch ale does not provide that for me. However, I will acknowledge that as someone who is still learning about the diverse and dynamic nature of beer, this one could become an acquired taste in the future.","Gajo74","Nov 08, 2014"

It's how bourbon and beer were supposed to taste together. Perfection.","jewellrunner","Nov 07, 2014"

The vanilla, toffee, caramel, and oak just blend so perfectly with the bourbon to create such an excellent beer.

So-so looks, while the aroma and flavour are an impressive blend of bourbon, wood, caramel malt and fruitiness. Seriously boozy - enjoyable but a tad harsh on the palate. Nice body; could be livelier. A good beer but I reckon the malt is overshadowed and the bourbon character could be dialled back a bit for balance. A good demonstration of why stouts endure bourbon-barrel aging better. Nonetheless, a worthy beer that deserves to be sampled.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 01, 2014"

Flavor is a good marriage of the base beer and the barrel aging. The bourbon notes tone down the overbearing esters of Dirty Bastard. Toasty caramel malts work very well with the oaky vanilla tones. Finishes sweet. Aftertaste has a lingering dried fruit bourbon thing going on. Mouthfeel is chewy, thick, and smooth. I'm usually not a big fan of bourbon barrel aging, but this is a solid example of when it goes right. I don't even care much for the base beer, so I'm surprised at how the barrel improved the original product, whereas normally I see it as detracting from the base product.","goochpunch","Jul 05, 2014"

Sweetness is muted, mainly noticeable up front. On the sides, get some puckering bitterness. Toward the back, booze is noticeable, with a lingering sweetness in the finish. Half an hour later, and 25 degrees warmer, it's like a different beer. The sweetness dominates, with bitterness still there but taking a back seat. I know that most beers change character as they warm but this one takes it to an extreme. Barely enjoyable cold, it becomes a real treat as it approaches room temp.","foobula","May 09, 2014"

I wanted to dip my entire face in my glass, but I resisted the temptation. The bourbon was upfront but not overly dominant, just the right touch. It lended a smoky vanilla tone to the caramel malt sweetness of the beer that just glided along my palate. The Backwood Bastard had enough heft in the body and light carbonation to hold up to the heavy flavors in this enticing elixir. This was a truly phenomenal bourbon barrel aged brew and a real treat from Founders.","brurevu","May 01, 2014"

I find that at first this beer can have quite bite from the alcohol, but after 6 months to a year in the cellar it mellows out to be just about perfect.","hail_seitan","Apr 24, 2014"

Vanilla dominates the front of the tongue, warming feel on the mid, and nice slap of the bourbon on the back end. Smooth mouthfeel with long lingering presence of the barrel. This is excellent. Even better as it is a rare treat for me. Probably not an everyday drinker if I had the choice, but excellent for a special occasion.","Mikus","Mar 31, 2014"

The nose is dominated by the barrel, lots of vanilla, oak, bourbon and alcohol, but there is still a big malt character with big ripe fruit (prunes, raisins). The taste is very similar and starts off dominated by the grain bill highlighting swet rich malt and lots of luscious dried fruit (figs, prunes and raisins). The barrel warms the palate and delivers lots of warm bourbon, vanilla and a touch of oak as well as brown sugar and molasses. The body is full, creamy and rich with just enough carbonation to pull it all together. That is a really great beer!","mtomlins","Mar 07, 2014"

Add that to Wee Heavy being my favorite variety of beer and this is second only to one other beer I've tried (St. Arnold's Bishop's Barrel #5 from Houston) and then not by much. Dark color. Beautiful, full aromas of cocoa. Taste and finish were delightful! The bourbon gives it an oaky, caramel-like taste to compliment the cocoa and adds just a slight burn that feels great going down. I can't give this beer enough stars! Unfortunately, like the St. Arnold's, it's a limited release, so I don't get to enjoy it over and over. I would love for a brewer to make a beer like this year-round!","Paul5211","Dec 31, 2013"

Slight to almost no carbonation and the smell is of caramel, oak, toasted almonds, vanilla and warm bread(where are those 50 IBUs?). Taste is caramel and oak up front followed light berries and a vanilla sugar finish and finally that delayed hop coating. The mouthful is huge, slightly lighter than a stout, on par with a barley wine. The alcohol to me is very minimal in this one especially for the 10% ABV, the only time present to me was in delayed drinks when I could feel my tongue soaking it in.

I must admit, much as I love I&G, I liked this better because of the more substantial body and slightly better malt/whiskey flavor balance. I like a hefty mouthfeel, and Backwoods Bastard is hard to beat! Of course it also tops the ABV of Innis & Gunn by about 3%.","scotorum","Dec 10, 2013"

I typically don't go for this style but I was intrigued after having a nice bourbon aged ale last weekend during the holiday. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of balance in the beer and the lovely hidden alcohol. It definitely blooms while it warms and everything about the beer becomes a bit more pronounced, the smell the taste and the mouthfeel specifically. A nice creamy mouthfeel with notes of brown sugar, molasses, raisin, vanilla and finally a kick of the bourbon on the tail end that is not overly aggressive like some of the bourbon barrel aged ales out there. I'm gonna hang on to two of these and see how they age, thats if I can hold off from drinking them.","bushwik","Dec 05, 2013"

Strong bourbon, vanilla, oak, and slight hints of chocolate highlight the aromas. The taste is right in line with the smell. My palate is met with a mild, upfront bourbon flavor, then catches a hint of vanilla and oak in the middle that finishes with a nice boozy burn. Light carbonation with a warm mouthful from the bourbon makes this a very well-balanced beer. A great, complex, barrel-aged offering from Founder's. The accessibility, cost, and overall complexity make this one of my favorites from Founder's. This ranks up there with KBS minus all of the hype!","brian44556","Dec 03, 2013"

I can also detect some of the booziness in the nose. The taste follows the smell, with the bourbon notes shining through at the beginning, but the scotch ale comes through after the bourbon fades. I think the two sets of flavors are really well-balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth and lightly creamy. For the ABV, this is pretty drinkable. Overall I think this is a really great barrel-aged offering from Founders.","mc4z","Nov 27, 2013"

Carbonation is average and the mouthfeel is a light medium. I was expecting a full medium body, but the lightness helps bring the bourbon flavor forward. The 10.2% alcohol is well hidden in this very well balanced beer. Bourbon against the molasses and dark malt backbone is the taste profile. Finishes with bourbon and malt sweetness with a touch of oak and a nice alcohol burn that lingers along with the oak. Another outstanding Founder’s offering that takes Old Ale brewing to a new level.","tillmac62","Nov 26, 2013"

Bourbon is definitely there, but not even half as strong as it is in the nose. Bit of a twang, but in a good way. Hints of a bitter vanilla/burnt caramel. Silky mouthfeel, warms nicely as it fills and goes down. Overall a great balance and really quite lovely. ..and this is coming from one that thought they didn't even like Scotch Ales.

Curmudgeon meets Dirty Bastard plus steroids. Poured into a snifter glass it has a really really dark amber color with very little froth line around the top. The smell is boozy but delicious. It's a beautiful blend of malty vanilla with a soft bourbon base. I don't make a lot of room on my top shelf which is crowded with stouts, but this one is near Anderson Valley's Bourbon Aged Stout, Parabola, and KBS.","kapalacc","Nov 09, 2013"

There's a wonderful bourbon aroma emanating from the glass, along with molasses - it kind of smells like shoofly pie. There's some maltiness to back it up, but mostly bourbon. It's quite sweet on the toungue with more delicious bourbon and also a dryer oakyness that comes along afterward. Nice creamy texture and just a slight bitterness. This is one of my favorite offerings from Founders and it seems to mellow out slightly while holding up very well after almost a year in the cellar.","greenmtn1111","Aug 26, 2013"

4.84,11.5,5,4.75,4.75,5,5,"Overall: Founders has been making great beer for over 20 years. Backwards Bastard is an amazingly subtle yet complex beer. You will find the flavor change with each sip as the beer warms and the taste lingers. You can drink this with almost any rich food and meal course; from roasted garlic Portobello mushrooms, to a medium-rare rib eye, or a flourless chocolate raspberry cake. But why wait for the food. As my favorite late night talk show host would exclaim, “This is a beverage”.","YoDude","Jun 14, 2013"

I would say the one I had was absolutely phenomenal and if your into Scotch ale's/wee heavys than definitely seek out an aged one, specifically founders, and you will love it as well...I am gonna buy a 4 pack and age them as well... see how they turn out in a few years.","pjkelley82","Jun 12, 2013"

For the huge abv, this is a great bourbon barrel Scotch Ale - the bourbon aroma and flavor is there, but not so huge as to completely take over. Its a great sipper, and the nuances of the barrel, along with the base beer make it enjoyable, especially as you give it time to warm.","jpro","Apr 28, 2013"

The flavor was not nearly as good, sort of muddled. It had hints of the vanilla and bourbon but i really couldn't get a feel for the base beer beneath. If the flavor matched the aroma this would be top notch.","ArrogantB","Feb 10, 2013"

Furthermore, it is extremely drinkable, especially for the 10.2% ABV. The warming sensation from the alcohol is strong but really quite pleasant. This may be one of my favorite beers from Founders and may certainly be my favorite Scotch ale. I might also add that this is by FAR my favorite bourbon barrel-aged beer that I’ve had so far.

It’s a bit on the sweet side. Taste is similar but the barrel flavor gets a tad harsh and isn’t quite as enjoyable. There's just an almost astringent harshness to the beer. Still, lots of vanilla, dark sugars and oak. Perhaps, a different batch or temperature would soften my opinion, here. Mouthfeel is smooth and while it’s fairly thick, it could be even thicker. Deep amber brown in color with a sudsy beige head. Interesting beer. I just wish that the barrel was a bit gentler on the palate.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

And while this beer does very well with the barrels, I just don’t necessarily like what bourbon barrels bring to a lot of the beers aged in them. This however does a good job. Also, it’s much, much better overall after it warms up more than a bit, and it becomes a very pleasant sipper.","fmccormi","Jan 18, 2013"

One and a half finger head with decent retention and great lacing. Big buttery, woody nose with hints of butterscotch, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The taste is extremely unique and unlike any other beer I've had. Tons of oak, butterscotch and creamy caramel along with hints of bourbon, toffee, tobacco, and just a touch of dark fruit. The mouthfeel is the only perfect 5 I've ever given. It's totally incredible! Smooth and creamy with a touch of oil and a spicy, warming finish. This was an extra in my trade so I have to thank Evan as I may have never tried it if it wasn't for him! Another mind-blowing beer from my favorite brewery!","beerdrifter","Jan 09, 2013"

Now, what is different here is that it's truly unique to have a non stout/dark beer pull off such a smooth tasty flavor with such a high ABV. Once you crack the bottle the smell of malt and bourbon overwhelm and you know you're in for a very different experience. The taste of the base Dirty Bastard is present and it meshes extremely well with the sweet malt and bourbon to create a top notch smooth scotch ale. Overall, it's a must have and one of the best beers Founders has created.","sjones5045","Dec 31, 2012"

I'd say this is an excellent candidate for aging, and can turn into a classic after some. My guess is, the astringent factors of this beer will surely fade after a year and improve it significantly, giving it a more malty, balanced taste...just might have to buy a few extra. There are so many beers of this ilk that are practically undrinkable compared to this(especially young), which is why Founders is who they are, and does what they duz.","PsilohsaiBiN","Dec 09, 2012"

4.5,3.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark reddish brown, almost cola-like. Tight bubbled khaki/butter colored head that about 1/4 inch head that rests thinly around the top of the glass, and sticks and slimes with some very visible alcohol legs. Bourbon right off the bat, big vanilla, buttery malts follow up, big brown sugar and caramel on the finish. Buttery malts fill the tongue, then caramel and raisins follow, sharp carbonation hits around mid sip and opens up the taste buds to a vanilla bourbon blast, that resinates to a cheerywood and alcohol finish. Full bodied, medium carbonation, strong, boozey, and very sweet. Overall; just an all around great beer, intense complexity, creative flavors, malty, sugary, desert like sweetness, it is crazy how good this beer is.","gabedivision","Dec 07, 2012"

4.33,-0.2,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip, bottled 10/12/12. Poured slowly down the center and got a beautiful light tan head that leaves, a thick ring of lace. The beer itself is a bright ruby. The smell on this starts with strong vanilla, bourbon, peat, dark fruit, and some biscuit. Taste is similar to smell not as much vanilla as the nose would have you expect, but really complex, pick up different flavors each sip, and really makes you crave the next one. Maybe a little smoke, but very subtle and blends well with all the other flavors from the nose. Body is medium large, perfect amount of carbonation for the style, not really dry almost surprising, and very drinkable for a big brew. Founders and Firestone are so good at brewing barrel aged beers it is scary. Love this and had a Dirty Bastard before to see what a difference the barrels made and it turned a very good beer into an amazing beer.","SawDog505","Dec 04, 2012"

I gave it pretty high marks because I'm really not a fan of Scotch Ales usually, but for me this is so perfect. Backwoods Bastard is now absolutely my favorite Founders beer, don't get me wrong, KBS and Breakfast Stout are up there as well, but I think this takes it to another level. Well done Founders, and thank you Nick for sending this my way. I can't wait to see what happens to my other bottle with some age on it.","bifrost17","Dec 03, 2012"
4.5,3.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Final Thoughts: Completely worth the money and unique. I'm starting to like barrel aged beers more and more because of tasting something like Backwoods Bastard which is brewed and aged to near perfection. Would I drink it again? This year if I can find it!(Would love to cellar a few of these bad boys). Otherwise I'll be on the lookout for next years release.","JamesMN","Dec 03, 2012"
4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"super different for a beer in this genre. it pours a slightly cloudy pale amber color, with a dense nearly pure white head, lots of lacing left behind as it sips down. the nose is a little fruity, a lot boozy, and entirely different again from most scotch ales. its too light. the taste is awesome, like a tasty hybrid of licorice and fresca soda, thats what i taste. more fruit than ever for a scotch, and the same effervescent carbonation as that artificial grapefruit flavored soda pop. its really good, but i am missing that smoke and hefty malt base ive grown used to in these beers. anyone else get that? bright bubbling medium body, again too light for the style, but this is a damn good beer. living up to its name for all the wrong reasons, this is something unique and to be cherished. i never in a million years would have put uts abv over 10% on a blind tasting, its far too delicate to be that potent, but it all seems to work out just right. on tap at j. ryans in syracuse, a place you must visit as a beer enthusiast. what a treat from founders!","StonedTrippin","Dec 03, 2012"
4.42,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a cloudy dark ruby-amber with a quickly attenuating scorched carmael-colored head. Lovely vanilla on the nose accompanied by tempered bourbon. Moutfheel is a little thin, but smooth as silk. A bit of a burn on the finish from a combination of carbonation, hop, and alcohol. The flavor is amazing. It would be perfect, but there's just some alcohol bitterness that detracts from the heavenliness. Toffee, vanilla, bread, and bourbon, all in spades. It's reminiscent of my favorite beer on planet Earth--Double DBA from FW, but a scaled down version.","DocJitsu","Dec 03, 2012"

Throughout the sip the flavoring stays very smooth, and relatively uniform. This is both good and bad. On the one hand, you get this great, rich, buttery, sweet bourbon flavoring for the entire sip. On the other hand, however, there are really no surprises. You’re waiting for something insane to kick in, but they kind of pull all their stops at the instant the beer touches your mouth. Really, this isn’t a complaint, as we found this beer to be delicious, and another homerun for Founders. The insane bourbon nose and flavoring makes this guy a contender amongst barreled beers, despite the style.","TheBrewo","Nov 12, 2012"

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a beautiful dark, syrupy caramel with terrific ruby tints. A slight ring of creamy head is present and leaves behind a light ring around the glass, but the body of the beer is dark red, bordering on black, and completely opaque. The smell of this beer is big with malty bourbon, caramel and sweet alcohol. Slight bread in the malt adds further complexity.. Peat malt is also slightly and gives the beer an ever-so-slight roasty tinge. On the taste the beer is very complex in flavor, beginning sweet and almost cloying with spicy alcohol and too sweet malts and big bourbon flavoring, but then transitions into very slight middle caramel before the finish pulls big barrel notes onto the tongue which lingers with the cloying bourbon. Mouthfeel is big and marmalade-like on the tongue, with sharp effervescence and a prickly feeling on the tongue. The mouth is left sticky but dry with very little saliva to speak of. Overall, I think I’m going to cellar the rest of this. The alcohol is a little too much in the flavor right now for my personal taste. There are some big bourbon notes which very intriguing in a sipping beer, but I’d like to get a little more malt flavor in this and less alcohol. The complexity of both the taste and the smell are superb, and show to Founder’s superb skill in brewing extreme beers, it just is not really the flavor I’m looking for. This definitely a must try for Bourbon fans, and barrel aged beers fans alike, and a superb beer, but I plan to cellar this to bring some new complexity to it. Expect a redux review in a couple months. This beer is a sipper meant to be enjoyed slowly in the evenings in front of a roaring fire, but it is definitely worth a try.","Maxwell","Nov 04, 2012"

The aroma is intensely woody, giving an impression of being in a pine forest at dusk after a storm. There is also a mild, fruity, cherry-like sweetness that wafts out from under the wood. The flavor is similarly rustic, with notes of charred wood and dark caramel, but any nuance to the flavor profile is difficult to appreciate under a substantial alcohol heat. Overall, though, despite some identifiable faults, the total experience with this beer is still satisfying.","devilben02","Sep 18, 2012"

Thin, sparse, frothy, beige head that settles slowly into an uneven covering. Aromas are darkly sweet and earthy, with a heavy dose of caramel, molasses, and cherries blended with a good booze character and some woody smells. Flavors are bold and rich all over the front of the tongue, with a decent alcohol warmth that hits the throat immediately. Taste profiles include a strong bourbon backbone, with rich caramel and molasses sweetness rolling off. Good balance of sweet characteristics, with a roasty feel, and a kick of light cherry sweetness at the end. Super rich and smooth, with a good, full body to carry both the flavor and the ABV. Aftertaste is slightly sharp thanks to the ABV, with oaky and earthy flavors. The finish is slightly cloying, with a slightly astringent feel from the booze.

The aroma, which was quite potent, was vanilla and alcohol. Being a scotch ale in its initial state, one expects a certain level of sweetness. I detected tastes of prune and vanilla mixed in with the scotch flavors. The alcohol from being aged was very detectable in the taste. It had a negative impact on the overall scope of flavors. The alcohol stays on the tongue in the aftertaste, making the aftertaste disappointing since the more desireable flavors disappeared. For all the hype that went with this beer, this is slightly disappointing. The barrel aged flavors did not blend well with the beer, making the alcohol flavor too prominent. Overall though, this is still a pretty good drink.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 22, 2012"

Some spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, vanilla, coconut, toasted malt, oak, bourbon, and molasses. Simply incredible aromas here with fantastic balance. Taste of huge caramel, coconut, vanilla, toasted malt, bourbon, toffee, molasses, and a bit of spiciness. Fairly clean finish; but some lingering notes of caramel, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and molasses on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and quite full bodied; with a very creamy, silky, and incredibly smooth drinking mouthfeel. Alcohol is almost completely hidden; but there is a small bit of booziness and a slight warming after the finish. Incredible balance of flavors in the taste and aromas. Overall this is definitely a world class brew. Incredible flavor balance, with some unique flavor combination thanks to the barrel aging. I am glad I have more of this; I wonder how it is in a year.","superspak","Jan 16, 2012"

Pours a slightly hazy, brownish-maroon hue with a creamy, quarter inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders forming a frothy band around the edges. Great nose on this beer - bourbon notes, brown sugar, raisins and prunes along a robust, malty backbone. Aromas are very much reminiscent of an old ale. Taste follows nose; however, the bold aromas are somewhat hollowed out in the flavor profile; nothing really pops. That said, I also get some buttery notes as well as a slight earthy hops presence at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation as well as a trace of acidity. There's also a little bit of residual alcohol heat that lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. Overall, a very good beer. I'm not really getting the wee heavy on this, so I am rating more to preference than style. Another great beer from Founders; however, not a beer that I would cellar for an extended period of time as I feel like this brew could develop some oxidized flavors.","Jwale73","Jan 06, 2012"

4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a tall glass at room temperature this wee heavy shows a deep mahogany with rosy/root beer colored edges. It produces a solid, light tan head that settles into a nice blanket and leaves a respectable web of lacing. The aroma offers deep vanilla scotch and woodsy malt, subtle dark fruits and heavy grains. Completely enticing. The first taste brings intense scotch malt with super sweet pine and deep fig/prune. Vanilla certainly comes back as well with a sure alcohol presence but one that does not block the urge to go back to the well to keep the flavor coming. Bourbon and oak can definitely be identified, as advertized. It's just such a classic medley of all things a scotch ale should be, and then some. It's a pretty hefty brew with fairly full body, nearly cloying except that the flavor works right through it to make it drinkable enough for the style. It's finely, but thoroughly carbonated and makes for a smooth, somewhat silky feel that works well despite the seriousness of this brew. I'd say the 10% ABV-plus is evident but very well managed here. It's just a great, serious scotch ale. A wee heavy, yes, exquisitely so!","Durge","Dec 23, 2011"

4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall / Drinkability: A definite slow sipper. Amazingly good, but one is enough. Becomes much more dangerous as it warms up as the alcohol gets hidden. Thankfully the bourbon flavor and smell is there to remind you of the higher ABV and to slow down. I think this is a wee heavy that would indeed put a fierce scotsman in his place, mellowing him out with one, and prompting him to fight after two. As I said about the aroma, it's like a whiskey toffee fudge candy in liquid beer form and that makes this a very good beer overall.","damndirtyape","Dec 05, 2011"

The syrrupy quality of the beer allows it to linger after first sip and leaves a lasting bourbon, vanilla, and caramel notes on the tongue. A fantastic beer definitely one of my favorites.","angelogarcia3","Nov 16, 2011"

3.52,-18.9,4,4.5,3,3,3.5,"Backwoods Bastard pours mahogany to a deep red, with about a finger of beige foam. It displays good retention, and there's a small amount of lacing left clinging to the glass. The nose is fantastically sweet/malty. Vanilla ad caramelize sugar immediately jump out at my nose, eventually making room for subtle bourbon and oak scents to show themselves and add a layer of complexity. The flavor takes that great balance though and turns it on its ear, as bourbon and wood trample all over the malty flavors present in the beer. Those spirit and oak notes work much better in a supporting role, and aren't great acting as the focal point of the beer. The beer's carbonation is alright, tending towards the less intense side of things. The body though is inexcusably light, not nearly as full and rich as such a big beer brewed in a malt forward style requires. Backwoods Bastard is an alright beer, and it has some potential, but as is I think this is one case where I prefer the base beer to the barrel aged version.","axeman9182","Nov 08, 2011"

It pours a clear dark russet-amber topped by a finger of dirty light-tan foam. The nose comprises bourbon, oak, light vanilla, caramel, toffee, light peat moss, raisin, dates, and a touch of cocoa. The only thing holding this smell back is the strength of the bourbon, which comes close to singeing my nosehairs with every sniff. (But this ain't enough to deter me from going further, mind you.) The taste brings in more of the same, but with a decidedly stronger and boozier bourbon component, which threatens to overtake everything else in a blaze of usurpatory glory. It's still pretty tasty, but much more one-dimensional than it could have been. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel.

Nothing in this beer is overpowering to the point that the other flavors are hid, and the balance of the beer is really the most impressive aspect. Is $4 too much for a bottle of this?

Booze-heavy aroma, almost straight bourbon, big and woody (there's a B&B joke in there somewhere). Let's be honest: this tasted like a cheap boilermaker, big on the booze, eliminating almost all complexity that might exist. Tones of oak-aged vanilla come through, but the bourbon just kills the palate almost completely. Tasted way higher in alcohol content than it actually was. Thinner than most Scottish ales I've had, but certainly not as good as some. The texture is more what I'd like to have in that it wasn't too syrupy, and certainly not as peaty, but it just didn't work with the intensity of the booze flavor. Not very good, not very drinkable, and I'll be happy never having it again. Sorry, Founders.","Rifugium","Oct 26, 2011"

It shows the alcohol much more and has slightly more of the bourbon burn. The 11 is now super smooth and easy going alcohol presence has lessened but I'm sure that the overall abv has hopefully increase with age.

With all that's great about this beer there are two things about it that make me sad; 1) It's only released once a year and 2) I don't have a fireplace to sit in front of (in a rocking chair of course) while sipping this wonderful drink. And at 10.2%, sipping may be the way to enjoy it.","CrookedStill","Oct 17, 2011"
4.89,12.7,4,5,5,4.5,5,"O: This beer is absolutely blowing my mind now. It's very complex with a fruity vanilla bourbon character. As a bourbon drinker this is very familiar to me and this is the best scotch ale I've ever had making me warm and tingly with each sip.","keanex","Oct 16, 2011"
4.37,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall- Wow. As a bourbon and scotch enthusiast, this was right up my alley. A sipper for sure, but dangerously sippable at that. Another great brew from Founders, one of the greatest breweries in the country.","Morningside","Oct 16, 2011"

4.2,-3.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O- You know, there is a lot of alcohol in this beer, and its prevalent. Its not necessarily a bad thing as it plays really well with the whole bourbon characteristic. The flavors are nice, soft oak, syrup, and earth. They come together to make a really really nice flavor as a whole, but i can't bring myself to give this beer a straight A/A+ just based on the alcohol content and the hype around it. Its a great sipping beer for a cool fall night, and those who like bourbon and/or scotch ales will find nirvana in this beer, but for me, its just very good.","znichols","Oct 13, 2011"
3.95,-9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark brown color w/ a one finger cocoa head that quickly disappears. Good carbonation, and somewhat weak lacing on the glass. Smell is oak, vanilla, malt, alcohol. A little on the thin side for me- and warming doesn't help much. Not as complex as I would think for a beer w/ this pedigree. Taste is the same- good, but not great. Something's missing here. It just doesn't have the depth of flavor or complexity that I would expect from a Founder's brew. Still, it's good. Mouthfeel is a disappointment. Very thin and carbonated feel. Too thin to be honest. Overall, this is a decent brew, but fell short of what I had hoped for.","jayhawk73","Oct 13, 2011"

3.89,-10.4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is fullish and somewhat creamy/syrupy yet not cloying in flavor. The sweet upfront taste followed by a dry finish turns me off slightly.

4.29,-1.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark brown, oaken color that is very nearly opaque. A small, thin layer of tan head develops, bud dissipates quickly. Small patches of wet lacing are left as the beer diminishes. Smells of bourbon, caramel, some toffee, a touch of vanilla, oak, and some dark, sugary fruit (cherries, date). Tastes of caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and the same dark fruits. Very well balanced and palatable. The alcohol is almost completely hidden, only noticeably by a warming exhale. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, and it finishes a touch dry. Overall, a spectacular brew that I could easily sip on all evening. It pains me that I don't have regular access to this.","eclipse54","Sep 25, 2011"

With almost a year on it, it's a pleasantly (for the most part) boozy cold-weather-appropriate sipper that's stays relatively close to the British style of Wee Heavy. Yet, for about $12 a 4-pk, it doesn't have quite the depth or complexity I'd need for it to become a regular seasonal purchase.","BedetheVenerable","Sep 04, 2011"
3.91,-9.9,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Smells like smoke, tea, a little caramel, light oak , and savory spice. Taste is the same with some earthy hops added. Not very boozy and I can still taste base beer.

The smell of booze, maple, some fennel, malts and wood all flood out of this beer. The taste is sweet with some light vanilla flavors, sweet malts, a light amount of bourbon and some earth in there too. The mouthfeel has some soft bubbles and a smooth creamy feel in the mouth. Overall I am very glad I finally got to try this one. I had wanted to give it a shot for a while and I did my best to enjoy each sip of this.

I am not really getting any stand out bourbon alcohol smells or tastes from this beer. Low carbonation with a thick and chewy mouthfeel. Slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat after each sip.

Add to that the gentle aroma of citrus with a heavy malty tang; a dense taste of orange peels, lemons, rope, cocoa, butter, oak, new leather shoes... is there anything *not* to envy in this beer? This can go head to head with any UK Scotch ale. Best enjoyed in a snifter or a thistle while playing the piano, or on one's front porch on an almost-spring New England afternoon. An incredible beer by any standard.","gfreed","Apr 04, 2011"

Aroma is slightly one dimisional and whiskey based. Not much wood or oak, just high spirit aroma, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar. My taste buds tingle with tasty brown sugar, sweet vanilla, creme brulee, cheap whiskey, and faint oak notes. This beer reminds me of liquid bread pudding.

This beer truly is a bastard because I really can't figure out all of the flavors it's really trying to go for. The short answer is that I like it, but I don't know why. I believe that there is a definite whiskey kick to this beer that is more prevalent in the back of the palate. There might even be a touch of smoked malts used.

Taste is upfront bourbon. Wow. Ok, this is too much for me, but I'll try to judge it fairly based on merit. Vanilla, cola, bourbon, some slight char somewhere in there, but damn, this is like a bourbon cut with a lager, there ain't much else than that. I know others love that sort of thing, but there is no balance there for me. Carbonation is medium and the mouthfeel is thin; body is dry, like a bourbon heavy mixer with coke.

If you swished it around in the glass the head would appear briefly. The smell was sweet with a hint of raisins and buttery whiskey. The flavour was malty yumminess with a vanilla buttery finish. The alcohol is quite noticeable in the aftertaste. It tasted like acidic Jameson to me: like Jameson and coke. That might not sounds like high praise, but I really like Jameson and coke... so yeah.

There is a bitter presence that dominates w/ a caramel candy and bitter presence w/ more sweetness evident in the taste as it warms. I was overjoyed when Mike offered this growler to me -A wonderful oak and bourbon element presents itself so well w/ lots of roasted and candy-like notes yet strength is high in the flavor and feel.

Pretty much all bourbon barrel in the nose, but it does smell quite nice. Very much like the aroma, the taste is dominated by the bourbon barrel. I like to see a sturdy malt and some smoke or wood flavors in a scotch ale but this doesn't seem to have it. It does have a very tasty bourbon flavor with good vanilla and sour oak flavors to go along with the bourbon flavor. The malt bring some brown sugar flavor and perhaps the lightest touch of peat. The feel is light with tingly carbonation; finishes quite sweet and a bit sticky, not cloying for a 12oz bottle. There is some boozy vapors going on. This is a very tasty brew due to the bourbon barrel aging and I scored it as such. However I would like to see more of the malt pop through especially for a 10.5ABV brew. If you are going to make it that boozy, beef up the malt. If you like the taste of bourbon is a light body this is for you.

Very little visible carbonation. The aroma revealed a huge cherry-vanilla/whiskey/oak essence, with some caramel apple and smoke as well. The taste? Wow...sweet malty, caramel-apple, cherry-vanilla, then followed by more sweet fruitiness before finishing on an ever so subtle bitter peel finish, that hid the alcohol content ridiculously well. As a matter of fact, if it wasn't for the whiskey in the nose, I wouldn't get much hint of alcohol at all. The feel was a silky smooth medium thickness, with no carbonation. The crazy thing is that the alcohol presence is such a non-factor, that you can find yourself having downed three snifters of this stuff, and still be yearning to session more. I know I was. Anyway, I sampled this at my virgin trip to the fine establishment known as the Mohawk House (see review), but even if I didn't like the place, I would've come back just for this beer.

For fans of Bourbon and beers aged on Bourbon wood, this is definitely worth a shot, and it makes a heck of a nightcap. Sadly, because the base is so masked by the aging, it becomes a good deal less interesting than it could potentially be.

4.64,6.9,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours woody deep brown amber with a diminutive light tan head. What little head there is fades fast, but leaves nice, although spotty lacing on the sides of the snifter. I discover as I hold this beer up to the light, that it is completely impenetrable. The aroma is quite alluring with plenty of bourbon and sweet toffee and brown sugar malt deliciousness. I also detect earthy hints from the wood as well as sweet vanilla. Bourbon and sweet malt are definitely the most prominent of the aromas, but all in all it has a well integrated nose. The flavor is not too in your face and very enjoyable. Wonderful bourbon notes mix with a heavenly malt backbone that is bursting with flavors of brown sugar, toffee and caramel. The barrel aging shines through much more in this beer than a lot of other examples, and I can taste the wonderful woody and earthy notes, as well as a surprising amount of vanilla. The mouthfeel is oh so smooth and on the fuller side of medium, with very low carbonation. The alcohol is fairly well hidden in this brew, and it goes down much easier that one would think. If it was not so delicious, I think I would be tempted to drink it too fast. Once again, Founders for the win.","zoso1967","Aug 31, 2010"

Wow, this taste is like nothing I've ever had before. On first sip I immediately taste a sweet marshmallow taste, followed by sweet bourbon whiskey and oak flavors. Sooo tasty!

No alcohol comes through in the nose. Taste was fantastic. A perfect balance, it is like the bottle but much more balanced and without the alcohol notes. Bourbon, oak, caramel, vanilla, and great tasty malts combine to form a nectar of the gods. The bourbon level here is perfect and more enjoyable than the extremely strong bourbon in KBS. Mouthfeel also improves from the bottle! The body is medium but very, very creamy with moderate carbonation. A tiny warmth makes for the most suitable mouthfeel possible.

Mmm, oaky...mmm, rich and bourbony. Starts sweet, gets dry and well-rounded, nicely balanced, and oozing over with wonderful flavor. You don't feel the 10% right away, but it gets in there, oh, yes...very nice. Not too much bourbon, which can be a detriment at times.

Strong bourbon taste at first. Then you got a nice creamy slightly bitter taste of booze, caramel and dark roasted coffee. Flavors blended pretty good. Felt thicker in the mouth.

Full-bodied, thick and treacly, you almost spoon it into your mouth. again, the coconut custard, butterscotch, caramel, vanilla fudge, caramelized brown sugar flavors far and away dominant. Candied orange peel is there. Cherry, plum fruit, once more, in a candied, boozed up fashion. Splash of ginger and allspice. There is nothing subtle about this beer, it's on you like white on rice.

Aromatics come straight from the barrel, soakin with vanilla/oak and mild charred bitter notes. Peated malt smokiness entertaining me upon a big malty alcoholic Scotch Ale like Dirty Bastard. Whiskey stands out in the nose and in flavor with vanilla/caramel soaked malts bringing in sweetness this beer is pretty amazing. I'm not crazy on either scotch whiskey/bourbon/scotch ale but the flavors combined do much better than each individual for me. Alcohol is so warming it pretty much overbears the carmel/vanilla/charred oak combo in my book this beer is so big I haven't tasted anything like it to date as far as craft beer goes. Carbonation surprisingly smooth and well represented, while the body is thick with residual sugars that didn't make it past residual sugars.

Has a nice mellow smell of bourbon with a wee bit of vanilla and toffee. A nice mellow bourbon taste followed by vanilla and spice. Feels a bit heavy for an ale, but still easily drinkable.

The taste is absolutely heavenly. Initially very smooth and sweet with a hint of oak and vanilla The aftertaste is primarily sweet bourbon. Very boozey, but unlike a lot of beers, that's not a downside. Between the alcohol content and the flavor, this is a sipper. Almost like sipping on a good whiskey.

There is also a lot of nice malt character int he aroma, caramel, roasted nuts and Light biscuit. The hops are really an after thought in the aroma, very light bitter presence. This beer has a wonderful flavor again a lot of the character is coming from the barrel. Huge vanilla, chard wood, and nutty flavors. Hints of caramel, butter, cherries. This beer is well balanced, the hops add just enough bitterness but do not take over. The flavor is really about the barrel. This is one of the better barrel aged beers I have had.

4.37,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Beautiful deep brown with minimal head, has the appearance of an ale aged in oak. Perhaps the oak contributed to some of the dark color here. Swirling the glass provides a small amount of carbonation and the head appears a tan, mocha cappucino froth color. The aroma coming off this beer is delightful, full of dried fruits, huge oak presence and a big hint of booziness. Nice caramel and toffee aromas as well. Malty beast here I suppose. Absolutely delicious, oak and caramel right up front. Alcohol carries the flavor across the tongue. Super rich and malty, the oak is wonderful in this beer...more than I've ever realized in another oak aged beer. Never got a deep wood taste from any other beer before this. Pairs so well with the toffee and burnt sugar flavors. Vanilla is a huge flavor going on here too, each sip is wondrous. Huge and syrupy mouthfeel, great aged Scotch ale.

Luckily not as harsh as straight bourbon, but the full flavor is there. Flashes of sweet malt underneath, with a growing warming sensation in the gut with every sip.

Nose is very reminiscent of other big bourbon beers, notably similar to BCS. By that I mean that the nose is nearly all bourbon, but I still like it. Vanilla, oak, and earthy notes abound. Again, this is quite like a lighter version of BCS. Delicious. Amazing how underneath the initial bourbon assault comes a bit of leafy/earthy hops and a decent alcohol and slightly spicy kick. Fantastic take on bourbon aging, surprised more people don't try it with ales. Mouthfeel is creamy, slick, and full bodied. I'm really impressed.

4,-7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"D - I expected something big, round, sweet, and bourbon like, but what I got is something far leaner and meaner than one would expect from a scotch ale. There is a lot of phenolic smoke character in this beer, either from abused yeast or from peat, and it does some strange things when it meets the bourbon. The phenolics seem to bring out a lot of the boozy and astringent qualities of the whiskey that are usually not present in barrel aged beers; combine this with the relative dryness of this brew, and the fact that it is not at all shy about its 10% abv, and you have a weirdly convincing bourbon beer. I'm still not quite sure what I think about this one. It has managed to capture a lot of the harsher qualities of distilled spirits that I prefer not to see in a beer; on the other hand, I have to respect the fact that they have brewed what I can only regard as the liquid equivalent of the grizzled, scotch-irish mountain man that graces the label of the bottle. This is quite a unique beer, and while I won't be rushing out to buy another one, I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to try it.","nickfl","Dec 08, 2009"

The taste is very malt, as a Scotch Ale should be. It has the same simple candy thing going on as the aroma, and although it is still strong it isn't as dominant as it is in the aroma. Still it makes the taste come across as simple. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is not doing it for me. I'm not sure if extra sugar was added to boost fermentation, and subsequently ABV, but is sure seems like it. And the result is a beer that taste/smells like candy aged in bourbon barrels, instead of Scotch Ale aged in bourbon barrels. I am certain I will not drink this again, and am wondering what I should do with the other three bottles I have. Maybe some of that sugar will mellow out with time.","KarlHungus","Nov 08, 2009"

Complex notes of vanilla, sweet malt, butter scotch, root beer barrel candy, coconut, subtle wet wood, cream soda, caramel and a tame whiff of lightly astringent alcohol. Amazing. The beer tastes just as good as it smells, a lot of the same combinations and layers of its aroma come through in flavor. Although this is definitely a sipper the alcohol is very well hidden behind the deep flavor profile. Full bodied with very light carbonation that barely pricks the tongue.

Unless one is recently-familiar with DB, the differences may go unnoticed altogether. Basically, you don't really need to write a full review on this, but rather add some comments onto a DB review.. The bourbon presence is definitely noticeable and a nice touch. The flavor (and aroma) are both a bit more complex with whiskey and bourbon notes, as well as hints of vanilla and sweetened chocolate. Overall, in many ways it is very similar to DB and the other prominent Wee Heavys (skullsplitter, etc), except the brown liquor presence adds extra boozey warmth while at the same time slightly decreasing the drinkability as the sweetness and liquor-like qualities could get tiring after your second or even first bottle. It certanly puts the ""scotch"" in scotch ale, though for all it's deliciousness and highlights (which, like DB there certainly are many) it seems as though it's not quite perfect and falls just short of a solid A.","BirdFlu","Feb 08, 2009"

Not sure if that's a good thing or not.

The flavors work really well together. Rich, malty caramel and brown sugar with a mellow, boozy bourbon note. The mouthfeel was thick, full-bodied and had very mild carbonation. Just a bit sticky. A really tasty sipper!","mdm46410","Dec 09, 2008"

Bourbon, vanilla, caramel and toffee are all present in the aroma of this beer, along with a bit of oak and maybe even leather. The combination of these scents is what really makes these introducing. The word I'm searching for is probably nuance. It's a nuanced character. What you smell is also what you get in tasting this beer along with an extraordinarily smooth mouthfeel. I like the way all the aforementioned flavors (and some others) mix in this beer. The flavors show themselves, then hide, then come back in the finish. Simple caramel maltiness starts things out, then a there's a big smack of toffee; make that a huge smack of toffee, followed by a grainy bourbon flavor and then a port-like tawny character making for a rich, warming finish. As the beer warmed up I noticed a sort of coffee with cream flavor in the finish. Overall, a complex and very well made ale.","marcobrau","Dec 06, 2008"

When cold the aroma is that of mainly caramel but as it warms a whole range of scents poke through - vanilla, bourbon, figs, a damp earthiness or mustiness and butterscotch - WOW! The taste does not disappoint either - many of the same smells follow through to the palate - this is a full flavor beer with caramel malts, bourbon and figs. The mouthfeel is spot on - not too heavy or light though it could use a bit more carbonation for more punch. If it weren't for the high ABV, I could easily have 2 or 3 of these beers in a night.

Strong vanilla dominates with oak and bourbon intertwined. Taste was a little thin. The taste reminds me of the days when I first started drinking in bars. It tastes EXACTLY like a Jack and Coke that has been sitting too long with ice in it and got watered down. This is because the beer lacks any HINT of carbonation.

Appearance is a semi-translucent dirty dark brown with a thick foamy head of light tan that is a full two fingers high before slowly falling back to a moderate ring of lace. Aroma is rich, full of oakiness and vanilla, bourbon comes through strong. Also notes of earthy grains and smokiness, sweet dark fruits also present. The taste opens with a big warming bourbon flavor that makes a transition to the vanilla and smoky oak flavors, buttery diacteyl notes, slightest hint towards the big abv% which this beer hides quite well. Aftertaste is lightly sweet but clean. Mouthfeel is silken-smooth, lightly carbonated with a medium body, syrupy in texture, coats the mouth and throat. Drinkability is outstanding for a 10% brew, you are tempted to follow one with another as wonderful as this beer is. This is a beer you sit and sip quietly to appreciate; I would suggest limiting it to one of these per sitting.

But in this conception, the bourbon-barreling made the beer richly textured yet not stick to the roof of your mouth.

Anyway, pours a very murky dark raspberry brown color. A bit more heading would raise the score of appearance a bit, as there is little, if any. Great smells of candied apple, custard, bourbon, and other sweet fruit come through. Taste is of more apple, some cinnamon, chocolate, sharp acidic twang, and some molasses. There is also a bit of a medicinal aspect to the beer as well, perhaps a result of barrel aging. Body is large and malty, with little hop presence. This would make for beer to pair with dessert, or on its own with a pipe or cigar. This beer conjures up thoughts of changing leaves from Fall, which is a great thing.

It does mellow a bit when it warms up but you can still tell there's some alcohol there when drinking it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, carbonation is low and it's creamy. Drinkability is decent enough and it is smooth, but the alcohol isn't hidden well at all so that hurts it some. I don't think I'd want to drink more than 1-2 of these at a time.

The smell is immediately a vanilla cherry boozy wonder. Beneath that a rich malty caramel goodness. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel has a 'mixed drink' boozy nature, as opposed to straight up single malt. Very smooth. Full flavored, the premium oak aged bourbon treatment is first class. The Scotch Ale character of the taste is denied by the more dominate ""Wee Heavy"". The 9.2% ABV is exaggerated by the bourbon notes. A really wonderful beverage and a classic sipper. Reminiscent of Founders Curmudgeon. Highly recommended.","jjayjaye","Jun 10, 2008"

Having said that, bourbon barrel aged beers seem to be a bit hard for me to get behind; there is something about the Bourbon notes that add a harshness the beers aged in the barrels that just doesn't quite work for me. As the beer warms up from its initial 50°F / 10°C it picks up more of the sharp, hot, Bourbon flavors which pull this away from being balanced.

4.8,10.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is just one of 2 beers im reviewing from tastes at Dark Lord day...this one because of how amazingly good it was and because i actually took notes on it. Pours dark, dark brown with reddish hues and a thin wisp of a head. looks exciting. Odor is full of bourbon, oaky and ethanol-laced with chocolate and peat smells too. Taste is absolutely sublime. Bourbon, some vanilla (not too much), oak, cherries, peat, toffee, prunes, other dark dangerous fruits. obvious alcohol warming. i think dirty bastard is definitely a beer that lends itself to barrel aging. what a great beer this is, ill have to head on up to Founders soon. Don't know who brought the growler but thanks!","aforbes10","Apr 30, 2007"

4.17,-3.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"the flavor is very malty, almost sweet, there is a good hop flavor, with a pleasent oakiness, bourbon, and vanilla.","plaztikjezuz","Mar 23, 2007"
4.3,-0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Wow! The bourbon is so well intergrated into this beer. It doesn't over power the other flavors and aromas. A pleasure to drink!","GbVDave","Feb 04, 2007"
4.5,3.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The bottom line: Founders does some of the best barrel aged products around. Kentucky Breakfast, Old Curmudgeon, the Bourbon Stout, and now this are amongst my favourite offerings by the brewery. Be sure to check this out if you're in the GR area anytime soon.","CortexBomb","Jan 30, 2007"
