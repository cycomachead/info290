"For about $9 a 4 pack this is an absolutely spectacular buy.  I prefer this over Scotty Karate, Old Chubb, dirty bastard and any of the other regularly available Mid West scotch ales.  It pretty much only distributes in WI, but whenever I am up there this is top of my to do list!"

"Color is a murky reddish-brown, with a cream head that dissipates pretty quick.  Nose is a caramel malt, with something like a rye spiciness behind it, maybe a hint of booze, burnt sugar.  Taste follows nose- caramel, mild spice, fairly sweet with bitterness on the followthrough, a little dark fruit.  Finish is bitter, boozy, and leaves that spice flavor (maybe nutmeg?).  Creamy carbonation, very fine bubbles.  Pretty good, step up from Warped Speed for sure."

"Like Warped Speed but a bit better.  Very good scotch ale.  Wouldn't bother buying a 4-pack of this for more than a 6-pack of Warped Speed though."

"O: Not always a huge Lake Louie fan, but they do make some fantastic scotch ales. This and Warped Speed are phenomenal beers, perfectly balanced in sweetness and awesome mouthfeel."
"Still one of my favorite Strong Scotch ales of all time. Definitely rivals Founders Backwoods Bastard, which makes its own weather because of the barrel aging. Beats my other two commonly found go-to's, Oskar Blues Old Chub and Dark Horse Scotty Karate. Much better than Skull Splitter or Sticky McDoogle."

"O - I find this to be one of the best Wee Heavy beers in WI and it is Lake Louie's finest beer. I enjoy a 4 pack of this every year. If you are in WI during October, do yourself a favor and get a pack or two."

"Starting off by saying I think it might be a bad bottle. The beer poured out as a muddy brown color with a quick fading cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer is funky... It should be sweet and malty, smells like it was aged in oak or something. Just too funky for a Scotch Ale in my opinion. The taste is tart, very sour off the first sip. The finish is more of the malty scotch ale shining through. The mouthfeel is decent, a little thin for the style and some sharp carbonation. Overall this beer would probably be good I just think something got infected here. Would be willing to try it again in the future with hopes of a better outcome."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a fine example of a Wee Heavy beer. Its very traditional and a solid beer all around! This is probably the best beer that I have drank from Lake Louie, its gotta be thier standout beer that they brew."

"Not a bad beer, but fell a little short of my expectations."
""
"D/O: This big scotch ale lacks the smoothness required of such a sipping beer. If acidity was not so out of control at times, it would impress. As it is, authentic malt-derived flavors are tossed about and sent fleeing by the scathing carbonic acid that sticks in the throat. It also struggles with style identity a bit, easily mistakable for a doppelbock or conservative quad in lieu of a wee heavy."
""

"O: Good Scotch Ale, will seek out and try again"
""
"Pours out a dark bloody ruby red with a sand colored foam collar, no lacing. Aroma is a heady mixture of dark fruits in a sturdy aromatic base of sweet caramel and toffee. A sip of the medium-heavy body reveals dense layers of the same sweet malts with large wallops of nutty flavors and no hint at all of the alcohol content inside. Very small hop accents of grassy and earth tones show themselves towards the end of the sip and smooth things out, but remain background level enough to keep things appropriate for a well-made scotch ale. Silky smooth in texture. The only nitpick I could find is that it could use a smidgeon of smokiness. That said, I definitely recommend trying this one!"
""

"This is the finest, by far, of the few Scotch Ales I've tried. A bold and wonderful beer you are certain to enjoy."

"A shame about the excess bitterness and alcohol."

"An enjoyable, large, sipping beer. Does not live up to expectations however. I wonder what would happen if they barrel-aged this beer?"
"The Wee Heavy poured into my snifter displays a deep amber/light brown color with a moderate off-white head that very quickly diminished to barely a skim. The aroma is moderately malty, earthy, slightly smoky caramel malt, hints of booze and a bit of butterscotch. The flavor is big nutty, earthy caramel malt, a bit buttery. Medium hop bitterness and a bit of alcohol dry out and balance the sweet malt nicely. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall a well-made, dangerously masked Wee Heavy, nice, very niiice!"
"Pours a translucent chocolate amber with a 1 finger head which dissipates quickly. Sweetness pours off the head of the beer, candy like, with a hint of booze. Chocolate, rich caramel, yeasty, some fig but much less estery than the warped speed. Big malt caramel, chocolate, toffee, candied sugar, pecans, nice sweetness with a balanced and mild bitterness. Finish is balanced, creamy, chewy and grainy malt, velvety finish, smooth and wonderfully rich all around, good stuff here. Excellent!"
"EDIT-After drinking a few Scotch Ales this winter, I noticed that many of them have a little sourness to them. This one did not initially but I cracked a bottle in March that I have had since August and I tasted the familiar Scotch Ale sourness that was absent the first time I had this. Is it possible that only aging for 7 months could have done that?"
"O- A solid beer to keep an eye out for during the fall. To be honest, i feel like it used to have even more flavor when they were making it in smaller batches (they used to release like 1/4 as many cases as they do now). I still enjoy the rich malty flavor and its a great beer to lay down until late winter."
"Overall, one of my favorite scotch ales. I think this would actually be a better beer if the alcohol were lower. I think the high alcohol takes away from some of the subtle flavors or caramel and chocolate. I look forward to this seasonal every year."
"Pours a cloudy apple cider-like color, sparse off-white ring of foam. Not much lacing. Smells like caramel malt and some red fruit (mix of candied cherry and strawberry), brown sugar, hop earthiness, slight alcohol. Taste is mostly caramel malt, alcohol, along with something that makes it taste like a macro lager. Like a dry lager yeast or something; reminds me of MGD. I am confused now. Medium body and low carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good scotch ale, nice and somewhat unique smell, but taste leaves a little to be desired."
"Overall, as noted, this beer seems like it might be starting to skunk. However, I have had it absolutely fresh too and it is solid. Not amazing, but solid in the fundamentals."
"1.5 D: I'm pretty sure I got a bad bottle. If I didn't, then I don't understand the other reviews. This tastes like a noob's homebrew."
"Not a huge scotch fan to begin with, but these does nothing to help change my mind, nor is it a good representation of the stye. Pass for me."
"Overall: I loved this beer! I was a bit turned off by the smell, but as soon as I had a swig, I was totally impressed. The flavor has the distinct taste of malt and maybe some cocoa as well. The hops, though light, are blended perfectly. I'm not sure if this beer is sold anywhere but southwestern Wisconsin, but if you find yourself in Arena, WI, stop at any liquor store and pick some of this up. You'll be happy you did!"
"Overall- Quite nice for a Scotch Ale. Big beer but great balance and loads of complexity. Fun to drink but dangerous. Would be nice with some caramelized onion smothered, pan seared pork tenderloin. Already wish I would have bought more than one bottle..."
"D: Very drinkable, I would enjoy a few of these with a rich stewed game meal."
"D: very good for a higher scotch ale"
"Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Slick and smooth with a slight lingering bitterness and alcohol heat..."
"D - This is an above-average Scotch Ale that doesn't have any major flaws, but doesn't really blow my mind either (although it's not one of my favorite styles, so I'm curious what it would take to do so). It's not very heavy in peat or smoke but otherwise it's quite true to style. Definitely recommended if you're into this type of brew."
"D: Overall a decent Wee heavy. I'm not sure what sets it apart from all the others in the style category though."
"D- With the great complexity of flavors in this one and the alcohol never apparent in taste, this is a dangerously good beer. Every sip I take, it keeps getting better. Now all LL has to do is distribute more to the Milwaukee area."
"Pours a dark amber-brown with little head. Very little aromatics to give a sense of the beer. The mouthfeel is thicker than Warped Speed with much more intense dark flavors, leather and earth. This is a very good beer pushing to the edge of the Scotch ale spectrum, being a bit heavy to have more than one. It would have outstanding potential to be aged on oak."
"Heavy body, medium carbonation. Good complexity and great flavors. One of my favorites from a great brewery. Look forward to it every year."
"Drinkability: This is a very enjoyable Scotch Ale. It has some nice sweet, fruity flavor, and just enough heat from the 9% ABV. I would really like to try this beer fresh just to try it at full power. Still, time has done this beer well and I would recommend this to anybody that likes the style. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I've had a few bottles of this over the years and it's always the same story. A pretty poor offering and certainly does not come to mind when thinking on a good scotch ale. PASS."
"amazing. I'm a big fan of warped speed, so this knocked my socks off. pours deep with a solid head. smells great, and tastes even better. similar to warped speed, but soooo smooth. I could drink this everyday."
"A good, thick malt bomb of a scotch ale that has just enough smoke and fruit to keep things from getting too syrupy."
"A good, strong brew that I like to linger over."
"A 12 ounce bottle with Louie's Reserve Strong Scotch Ale labeled on the neck. Poured into my Wachusett shaker glass. The ale appears a murky crimson brown color with barely a finger of fizzy, quickly fading tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of butterscotch baking chips, believe it or not - watermelon, bittersweet caramel, alcohol, sourdough bread, raisins. Fizzy carbonation, medium bodied, and the finish is bitter as well as mildly sweet and sour."
"Drinkability pretty good, definitely better then the Warped Speed. It was lighter, a nice sweet maltiness, some scotch esters, decent depth as it opened up. But like the Warped Speed, I'm not loving the acidity"
"Bottle from a trade with wisrarebeer. The beer is murky red-brown with a thin but solid looking head. The beer smells rich and nearly oppressive, a strong malt bomb of a beer. Same with the taste, this is massive with strong malt and barleywine notes. Very boozy, so much so that it's difficult to rate drinkability very high. Much appreciated brew."
"Very clean alcohol note considering ABV. As mentioned before, a light astringency, and seems to come out more as it warms. Carbonation is light but good for style. Overall a very nice Wee-Heavy. The yeast notes are impressive, and just a minor tweek on the malt would make this world class."
"Poured a deep deep brownish red with no head. The scent wasn't what I was expecting, malty, caramel sweetness and dark fruits! The taste was earthy and sweet. There was a good presence of dark fruit which added to the sweetness I'm guessing and you could pick-up the alcohol in there too. What a beer! I'm glad I tried and wish I would've bought more than a single bottle this fall."
"*Trader's Note: Thanks to nflmvp for the bottles!"
"A decent Scotch, care of Derek. Lightbrown colour with a white head, lts of lace. Smooth drinking, creamy mouthfeel.Some sourness and then a seet finish.I rank this a bit above average for a style that I often don't like.Aroma draws me in and has a bit of smoke."
"Thanks for the trade DaPeculiarDane!"
"drinkability is great. nicely balanced and very enjoyable. thanks dave for helping me to finally try this one!"
"Pours a hazed dark orange, light brown, thin off white head forms, thin ring around the glass, some lace spots, looks nice. Smell is nice, toffee, very earthy, light chocolate, some wood, bit of sour dark fruits, brown sugar, nice. Taste is similar, caramelized malts, chocolate, earth, light smokiness, fruit, very dry woody finish, bit of sourness, not as complex as hopes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, some alcohol warmth. Think I prefer the regular Scotch ale, but this one is still good. Thanks Russ!"
"Overall I was completely under whelmed by this one. I was hoping that this was going to be some really great Scotch ale the likes of which I had not seen before, however this was just not the case. It was dull , muted, and just really just did not taste anywhere near what I would have liked it to. I don't think I would try this one again, unless I just had a bad bottle, but whatever there are much better representations of the style out there to be found, I don't really think this one is worth the hype."
"The mouthfeel is medium bordering on heavy and feels silky smooth. Yum again. That toffee is really make this one very drinkable given the alcohol content. I'm really happy that I got to try this Wee Heavy as it's a darn good one!"
"Clear brown with an off white head of foam. Caramel hits hard in the nose, with light hops in the background. Other notes of chocolate, roasted malt, and booze make this one similar to a dark chocolate roasted caramello bar. Taste is caramel again, with nice boozy warmth, toasted/roasted malts and a wonderful lingering finish of toffeeness. Mouthfeel is a little thin but that lends to the excellent drinkability"
"D- This beer has a good smooth flavor with some nice depth. The light note of smoke does a good job of enhancing the malt without tasting like band aids."
"Dark toffee brown, fairly clear, with a thin, fine skim of beige foam. The bubbles formed a solid collar and produced quite a bit of delicate lace. Toffee/caramel aroma, a hint of cocoa and roast, light smoke. Low bitterness with a lot of malt, mostly toffee and caramel sweetness, light hoppiness and chocolate notes, some alcohol and smoke in the finish. Medium to full bodied with smooth, soft carbonation. A little on the creamy side with some warmth. This stuff is really quite good. I could sip on this all night."
"A-4 S-4 T-4.5 M-4.5 D-4"
"Quite a bit of punch here which is probably due to the alcohol. I like the lasting flavors and slight lacing which also hung around for a while. Read some information on Louie Reserve and it looks like the alcohol at 9% to 10% is what I am sensing. I did not get the caramel either but then I dont always know what Im doing. Looks like I was lucky to pick up a six of this."
"Although it was bit more than I wanted to spend (partly because the vendor), the ale is quite good and can see indulging again."
"D: The 9% is so well hidden that I'd be hardpressed to put the abv above 6%. The ale is warming and full without being to sweet. An incredible beer that is worth the accolades. Easily one of the best wee heavies that I've ever had."
"Louie's Reserve Strong Scotch Ale (as the neck label reads) is the best beer that I've ever had from what I think is the best brewer in the great state of Wisconsin. It's everything I want in a wee heavy and then some. If I was a Badger, I'd buy this stuff by case whenever the brewery decided to grace us with a batch."
"D- It is pretty good. I think it might be a tad to old but still tasty. I think there are better wee heavies though."
"Poured into a chalice a grapey color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head, leaves some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly oaky, cherries, figs, raisins, and some caramel. The taste is malty/oaky, nice presents of dark fruit, some tanginess, nice touch of caramel. The finish is dry. Medium body, a complex brew. Very drinkable, I/you could drink a few of these before you know it, easily."
"I will get a pack of this for next winter."
"Pours a big head that doesn't fall that fast, it leaves a great lacing behind as well. The color is a dark brown with a red hue in it. The smell is a little sour and smells like a scotch ale. The taste is a little clove with a big Scotch ale taste. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and slightly fizzy. But it's crisp and a little refreshing as well. I will wait patiently for the next year's reserve ale to try it again."
"I'm amazed I actually traded one of these away. leftmindedrighty, mother fucker you better like this one!!! :)"
"Like it!"
"A bit sweet for me, but a good brew."
"Medium leaning toward thin mouthfeel."
"D - Give me another, period."
"Overall this is a very worthwhile brew to seek out while in WI, or through trading. Be sure it's fresh, and stored cold though. Old bottles are nothing to write home about."
"Violet ink dark amber brown. Thick, creamy, rocky, dirty khaki head. Laces excellently. Complex aroma: caramel apple, smoke, butter rum, meat, scorched brown sugar, leather, and light peat bog. Big earthy sweet caramelly malt flavors up front. Rummy fruits and sweet bread combine with leather, spiced pudding, and peat. Mild, pleasant, peppery bitterness follows. Residual malty sweetness in the finish. Full-bodied, coating feel. Excellent beer! So malty and complex!"
"Drinkability: This is amazingly drinkable for such a heavy beer. Balanced, smooth, with a belt that sneaks up on you. No wonder they used to call this Liqiud Reefer...."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavy and syrupy but remarkably smooth and drinkable. Would make a fine winter warmer, or pair well with a cigar. I like it, no matter what it decides to be."
"Mouthfeel is nice and chewy with plenty of carbonation. It makes itself known and goes down easily with only a touch of alcohol on the finish. Another stellar scotch ale from Lake Louie that I wish I had a bigger supply of. I see myself coming home with a trunk full of Lake Louie the next time I get up to WI. Thanks to kmpitz2 for this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and syrupy. Not bad at all."
"Overall, a good scotch ale, and since I don't often get to have these, I have to give this one props, although I don't think I'd be able to have more than one in a session."
"Drinkability is solid, the regular Warped Speed is more stylistic accurate IMO but this is a complex and enjoyable beer with just a bit too much alcholic threads."
"1-23-07: Same batch, cellared until now. Seems that more of the malt has come out with age. Smooth but with a nice alcohol bite. Worth a shot in the cellar for sure."
"After drinking so many hoppy beers it is good to go to the malty side and this was a great departure. Filtered darker red/amber with a distinct malt and buttered caramel popcorn nose. I'm not getting any peat just a lot of the same flavors as the smell. This needs to be enjoyed slowly since warming really helps bring some excellent flavors forward in a big bodied beer. I liked the warped speed much better. Someone get me a Lake Louie t-shirt! Yet another dirtylou beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/4"" tan head over the clear reddish brown brew. What head there is fades relatively slowly, with bubbly lacing prevalent. Aroma is vanilla and alcohol, with sweetness also weighing in. Taste is almost a light mocha sweetness, touches of peat smoke, and a vanilla alcohol close. Mouthfeel is awesome for the style and abv, and drinkabilty is only limited by how much you can find. Another great Wee Heavy from these guys."
"Nice American example of a Wee Heavy. Sticky sweet malts govern, with an assertive smoky character and ideal hop bitterness for a well executed complexity. Very enjoyable! Thanks to kmpitz2 for this superb bottle."
"Pours an amber color with almost no head and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of sweetness and some caramel - and graham cracker, as kmpitz2 said. The nose didn't really do it for me. The flavor actually got better as it warmed - I really didn't like this beer at all when it was really cold, but it got better as it got warmer. The flavor has a lot of sweetness, caramel, and some burned malt. Finish is somewhat oily. The drinkability is pretty good for the alcohol and the mouthfeel is moderate."
"Pours a full-on deep amber color with a light swirl of something over top. I wouldn't call it head, but its pretty cool looking. Nose is caramel and brown-sugary sweet, with notes of graham crackers and chocolate. Just hints of alcohol play in the back. Flavor is rather brown-sugar sweet, with a moderate burnt to smokey note and a bitterness that hangs on the finish, but it is not from hops. Nothing lingers too long. Feel is slightly syrupy slick, thick with a light carbonation. For 9%, this one really goes down smooth and doesn't let on to the alcohol content. The more I drink this one the more it grows on me. Glad I have some to hang onto and drink."
"There's a bit of an alcohol burn in the otherwise smooth, creamy mouthfeel that detracts from the drinkability; other than this, though, Louie's Reserve is a hell of a beer. Better than Warped Speed? I'm not sure, and I'm leaning toward no--but that's hardly something of which to be ashamed."
"I really dont see that many differences between this and warp speed obviously, but that isnt a bad thing! Lake Louie is quite the gem brewery and I will drink this one while it lasts"
"let's unretire this brew and get it on the best of BA. It deserves it!"
"1/25/06: Updating my ratings slightly. After several more bottles, I've decided this is not quite as good as the regular Warped Speed Scotch ale. The alcohol is a little overpowering. Still a great beer, though."
"Pours a dark garnet/mahogany with a finger and a half of khaki head that fades to a whispy coating, Nose is phenomenal: barrel-aged bourbon, warm vanilla, chocolate-covered cherries, smokey caramel. Just amazing. Taste is just as complex and warm as the nose: a hearty caramel malt backbone smothered in woody vanilla ice cream, sweet cherries, chocolate caramels, a light floral hop bite for balance and a healthy warming alcohol that spreads quickly throughout your chest. Body is velvety smooth and creamier than cream, yet insanely drinkable. This really seems like a barrel-aged scotch here, sublimely mellow yet incredibly complex. This is Warped Speed's sophisticated, elegant, well-traveled big brother. If you can find it, get it. The most refined beer I've had to date."
"Props to cokes for the big ol growler."
"Seeya next fall, good buddy."
"Surprisingly easy to drink, and delicious on top of all that. So soft and lucious, leads one to the assumption that you simply cannot stop. Back on my heels, the beer is gone....but not for long."
"This is absolutely brilliant stuff, and stands in ably for a barleywine as a last-beer-of the-night, or happy reward when you've been good...I hope I've been good? Huge thanks to Mr. Cokes for sending along this 22oz. sample! A great beer sent by a great BA!"
"Fucking incredible."
