Wee heavy is a great style for a barrel as it allows for significant influence without being over-barreled.  The palate is a bit thin and doesn't carry the complexity of the aroma.  Still, though, a very nice scotch ale worth seeking out.","timc100","Feb 08, 2015"

Gave it a quick whiff and had to do the double take. Wonderful caramel bourbony nose. First thing that came to mind after taste was was a fizzy JD single barrel with a splash of coke, yet it was somehow not too boozy. I loved every sip of this. If you have friends who love bourbon but not beer, i highly suggest you get them to try this. Awesome.","KATCanada","Nov 30, 2014"

Smooth bourbon aromas, woody spice, molasses, toffee, berries, and coconut.  Not particularly hot smelling, which is nice.  Flavor is smooth and rich...wow.  The bourbon blends nicely with the base beer, which results in something sweet like pure honey and toffee ice cream, vanilla, chocolate, and brown sugar, but absolutely no harsh barrel notes.  Warm cinnamon way in the back along with some coconut.  Super smooth, creamy body has some thickness and leaves a bit of heat in the throat.

Heavy oak and stone fruit in the aroma with some tobacco, vanilla and raisin. Chocolate came out in the taste particularly strong in the beginning then gave way to the bourbon, with an emphasis on oak and vanilla as well. Creamy mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation to carry everything. Nice amount of sediment at the end.","Phigg1102","Sep 30, 2014"

The taste has a good cohesive sweetness with barrel blended well into the base and nicely balanced malt with scotch ale flavor smooth yet still strong as it finishes more on the sweet side. Overall this is a great mix of scotch ale with bourbon in an almost seamless combo -this is like a match made in heaven with malt complexity enhanced nicely by the woody barrel aging.","Slatetank","Jul 10, 2014"

4.5,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of a Bourbon Barrel Aged Scotch Ale, I think they weren't joking around when they said this beer was made just to be aged in barrels, the flavors work so well with barrel and I can see a good amount of thought went into the base beer and it seems like it sat in the barrel for the perfect amount of time and it achieved some killer balance. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, a little rich, a little sticky, not crisp, a little silky, not too filling and the taste did an awesome job at holding my attention, I wouldn't mind sipping on this all night and it really amazes me how smooth it is. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and drinkability, they were among some of the best I've experiences in a Bourbon Barrel aged beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything I would change, but I did think it was a little pricey and it would be great to see it at around the same price point as Backwoods Bastard. I would for sure buy this beer again, and I'm kicking myself for not picking up more when I had the chance. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone and it's a must try if you like bourbon barrel aged beers. All in all I was straight up impressed with this beer, i had some high expectations and it met every single one of them and even surpassed them in some aspects. This is without a doubt my new favorite beer from Thirsty Dog and it's right up there with Backwoods Bastard as my favorite of the style, these beers are very similar and I would have to have them side by side to fully get an idea as to which is the better beer. Fantastic job guys, keep up the great and impressive work.","StoutHunter","Jun 08, 2014"

The initial aroma is a blast in the face of super fresh bourbon barrel, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, etc. As the beer warms you can pick up some more earthy notes. Downside it is kind of a one note aroma, uni-dimensional. To start with the flavor mirrors the aroma, as the beer warms though it becomes easier to pick out chewy raisin, vinious flavors, and a smokey maple syrup quality. It's nice. Thick, sticky, slick, however not cloying over the palate. Really good beer here. Actually....love it. Here is the problem...it is 28 dollars a four pack, that's a lot and I think value is important.","pmlondrigan","May 02, 2014"

The nose is bourbon over sweet dark fruit, mostly plum and raisin, coupled with notes of vanilla, caramel and oak over molasses. Almost full bodied with a very rich creamy texture. The superb flavor profile is complex, yet balanced. Unlike Founder's Backwoods Bastard, bourbon doesn't predominate. You get a complex balance of bourbon against the flavors of the nose. It begins with the dark fruit, progresses to the caramel and molasses based sweetness, then bourbon and the associated vanilla and oak notes. The finish is a smooth bourbon forward sweetness counter balanced with an oak astringency that flows into that nice alcoholic burn at the back of the throat. Compared to FBB, the Wulver wins by a nose for the Wee Heavy title.","tillmac62","Mar 26, 2014"

The malt profile is weak for the style and the body is also too thin to properly balance with the bourbon flavors. The bourbon almost completely takes over on the finish and this offering ends up tasting like a shot rather than a beer.","57md","Feb 15, 2014"

Not completely opaque with some ruby showing through the edges of this one. Aroma of chocolate, bourbon, caramel, vanilla. Flavor is boozy bourbon up front alongside some sweet chocolate, then fades nicely into overwhelmingly vanilla and caramel notes. The oaky bourbon and vanilla lingers a good while. The body in this is not as thick and chewy as I had expected, with solid medium carbonation to go along with a medium heavy mouthfeel. It nevertheless tastes excellent with lots of layers of flavor coming across the palate. A nice exhibition of the bourbon barrels here. Yum.","BMMillsy","Jan 20, 2014"

If I hadn't seen the bottle opened I would swear that this beer was cut to serve more people.

Based on that experience, I have had no problem ever since paying $24 a 4 pack for it to be a permanent resident in my home. Aroma of toffee, vanilla, caramel, molasses, wood, sweet dark fruits, and last, but not least, bourbon. Taste follows everything you smell with some peat moss to boot. The very subtle, perfectly integrated bourbon up front. The deep, rich scotch ale flavors on the back end. A slow, mild heat in the finish. I can't overstate how balanced and smooth this is for a 12% BA beer. The body is just a hair on the thin side for a wee heavy, but expected. Overjoyed that this is in my back yard. I won't say that there isn't another brewery making something as good, but I haven't had it and can't imagine anything being better. This is like a Backwoods Bastard, Bourbon County style.

Alcohol certainly diminishes the head retention. The aromatics are simply divine with nuances of Four Roses Kentucky Straight Bourbon that show some spicy & sweet notes of rye, cinnamon & sweet molasses which carry a hint of roasted barley, deep caramel, cherry & vanilla. The alcohol is noted and certainly gives hints to the strength contained within. The flavor starts off very cloying at first with big hits of charred brown sugar e.g. Steen's Pure Cane Syrup before the underlying spicy hops & bourbon character help lend balance towards the very warming & slightly stealthy alcohol laded finish. Wulver is really a Werewolf in disguise, as it starts off innocent enough before unleashing the beast.

There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a barrel aged presence that is slightly better in the aroma in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 28, 2013"

Smell is all about the toffee, caramel, vanilla, and brown sugar bourbon dipped raisins. Taste is really the same, but vanilla and toffee dominate, with the other flavors in a supporting role. Body is medium, with enough life, a touch dry, and a sipper for sure. This is a fairly smooth monster of a beer, that really deserves its recognition and tickles the palate in the best way.

Pours moderately hazy and cloudy deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, clove, oak, molasses, light chocolate, pepper, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with amazing complexity and balance of malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, vanilla, clove, oak, bourbon, brown bread, molasses, chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, clove, oak, bourbon, chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of malt and barrel flavors; with absolutely perfect balance of barrel/malt and zero cloying sweetness on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class barrel aged scotch ale. All around insane complexity and balance of malt and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. Amazing.","superspak","Sep 06, 2013"

One more microbe of booziness, and it would slide completely over the edge and become a chore to drink. It is wonderful how it toes the precipice without falling in and serves itself up as a classic sipper. If I had to compare this to Backwood's Bastard, I'd say this compares to Backwood's Bastard like BCBS compares to KBS. Interpret that any way you like. Me, I'm gettin' back into this here glass.

There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is very sweet, the brew smells like caramel, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, dark fruit, and molasses. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some nuts and a bit of chocolate. It's a very sweet tasting brew full of malty goodness! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, smooth and very easy to drink. It certainly doesn't drink like a 12% ABV brew. I think this is a pretty good brew overall.

I prefer BBA Siberian night because I favor the style, but this is the best damn wee heavy to cross my face, thanks to the precise 11 month bourbon barrel aging that fits this style so well. I love you, thirsty dog. I love you with all my senses.","hustlesworth","Jun 04, 2013"

(The brewery tells me they had some trouble getting the label approved by the US government, so it took a while.) I wasn't able to make good on my word to stock up on it because it sells for six bucks a bottle, but I've been buying it while it's available as my budget permits.","ScottR","Sep 11, 2012"

4,-8.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from growler into a Green Man snifter. Poured a massively dark reddish brown with a half finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, wood, sweet alcohol, red wine spices, vanilla, and sweet barrel. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, vanilla, spices, wood, and barrel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one really screamed barrel to me. That nice sweet woodiness with a kiss of vanilla shined throughout and really made this one quite pleasant. With all of this it still managed to be quite well balanced and complex at the same time. I just hate that so few have gotten to try this one as of this review as it is definitely one of the better ones I’ve had from Thirsty Dog’s barrel program. This is saying a lot as I usually do not like this style. Well done Thirsty Dog, well done.","thagr81us","May 15, 2012"

A thin layer of head stays a while--this big boy beckons like a mythological siren.... The nose is straight bourbon. It's like I've hanged myself upside down in a bourbon barrel. Soggy wet oak with vanilla undertones bombard the malty wee heavy. The taste confirms an earthy, bourbony goodness. This makes me wonder why more wee heavys aren't BBA. I'm not really a fan of the basic style, but it's as if it hugs the bourbon influence with lots of love and kisses! That sweet oaky bourbon really imparts its influence to what might otherwise be a malty mess. I can't help. It compare it to the template of a Backwoods Bastard...and this one hold its own! I'd like to try 'em side-by-side. A deliciously done dog from Thirsty, Ohio! :-)","marvin213","Mar 18, 2012"
