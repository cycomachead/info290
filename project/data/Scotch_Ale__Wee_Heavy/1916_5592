Has an almost peaty flavor pleasant some cocoa aftertaste. Highly carbonated and chewy. First sip seemed to fill mouth quickly. Feeling acidity linger on tip of tongue. Moderately syrupy. Seems to attack fast and linger mildly. A good beer with a medium body, and a good buy, once in a while.","sporklift87","Mar 03, 2015"

My only knock is that it's a little bland and could use some complexity. Maybe ramping up the smokiness just a smidge (not too much!), and a wee bit more bittering hops. In my area this beer sells for about $8.50 for a 4-pack of pint cans, which is very reasonable.","archyquaffer","Aug 08, 2014"

There's a bizarre over-sweetness in the aftertaste on this and the heat comes through a little thick in the beginning.

4.1,2.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Long time since I've had the pleasure of a Cold Smoke. Compared with a few other top-grade examples within the style, it could have a little more bulk. Nevertheless, a very nice, easy-drinking Scotch ale that is worth a trip to the Kettlehouse taproom if you are lucky enough to find yourself in Missoula.","GeezLynn","Beers"

3.81,-4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"My pour created two fingers' worth of bubbly, thick, light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep cola-brown with NE-quality clarity and ruby highlights. Nose was sweet, milk chocolaty, cocoa and coffee. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a more muted sweetness on the tongue than the nose had led me to expect. Finish had a coffee/cocoa flavor that lingered. This was nowhere near as sweet as I had girded myself to expect. I really enjoyed it, but its absence of noticeable hops made it less compelling than many American-IPAs would be for me.","woodychandler","Oct 10, 2008"
4.35,9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Spent a week in Missoula last September. Stopped in to the Kettlehouse Brewery and Tried this beer after being disappointed in their Bongwater porter (the name fits). I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. Found this beer on tap most everywhere we ate on tap. The only other Wee Heavy I'd had was an Import from Scotland. This beer comes damn close!","Kindsdaddy","Sep 30, 2008"

At 6.5 abv this drinks like a 4.5. A great Scotch Ale, and very good entry beer for those wanting to sample different styles without taking a big risk.","TheBishop","Jun 20, 2008"
4.15,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"D-Tasty stuff, this alone could let me down multiples! I like the smoked elements plus the sweetness is not overwhelming....a fault I see in many scotch ales. This is a well crafted and tasty brew, from a can no less! Give it just a bit more body and round out the smoothness and this could become a world beater!","Deuane","Jun 02, 2008"

3.88,-2.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Draught @ Big Sky: This one pours a ruby tinged brown color. It has a fairly decent frothy off white head on it, but it doesnt last too long. A bit of a roasted, sweet malt to the nose, as well as some smokiness. I didnt really get any peat out of it, as I might expect in a scotch ale. A good medium body and flavor. Mainly the sweet roasted malts that were in the aroma, as well as some of the smokiness. Some lurking hops for balance, but fairly hidden. Decent!","Boto","Aug 20, 2002"

The brew was light and refreshing…a little too light and refreshing for a style of ale that was probably created to impart the need in man to throw objects in many different ways for sport or war.","beernut7","0"
