The nose is dark fruits (dates, raisins and figs) coupled with hints of vanilla, oak, anise and coriander over a rich malt sweetness. Full bodied with a rich luxurious creamy texture. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish. The outstanding flavor profile is both complex and balanced. It follows the nose with dark fruits slowly yielding to the sweet malt. In the middle chocolate notes are evident that slowly fade to a very subtle vanilla and smoky oak. The finish leaves you with a note of coriander and the only hint of alcohol. In short, this is a brewer's masterpiece.","tillmac62","Jul 08, 2014"

4.32,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"500 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/1/2012. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, cherry, plum, pear, fig, toffee, toast, apple, molasses, oak, brown bread, chocolate, coriander, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark malt, yeast ester, and moderate oak notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, pear, toast, toffee, apple, oak, brown bread, chocolate, coriander, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, pear, toast, toffee, oak, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of dark malt, yeast ester, and moderate oak flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding scotch ale. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark malt, yeast ester, and moderate oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 28, 2014"

3.77,-8.9,3.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and while it isn't the truest to style it still has some of those base Scotch Ale flavors, but the sweetness and fruity flavors are really kicked up and the coriander adds to the uniqueness of this beer. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth, rich, a little cloying and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention but I think the high amount of sweetness would start to wear on me so I think one glass would be enough for me, but I think this would make for a nice beer to enjoy on cool fall night by the bonfire. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good and very unique and complex for the style. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, it was just a little too high for me and it held this beer back from being as good and drinkable as it could be. I might buy this beer again in the fall if i'm in the mood for something like this, but it's a little expensive and I wouldn't buy it regularly. I would recommend this to people who likes sweet and fruity beers. Overall I thought this was a nice beer, it did have a couple things that held it back but when it came to the flavor and aroma it was pretty complex and I thought it was a very unique take on the style and I actually thought that the Coriander worked well with this beer and I wasn't really expecting that to happen and I wouldn't mind seeing more Scotch Ales brewed with it. This made for a nice first impression for Traquair and while it isn't my favorite Scotch ale it sure is pretty memorable. Nice job guys, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Feb 06, 2014"

There is not really much about this beer that can be criticised, although perhaps there is a tad too much coriander and possibly a little *too* refreshing for a wee heavy.","machalel","Aug 15, 2013"

After reading some of the other reviews though, I believe they are all referring to this ale so I thought it best not to add an additional beer to the mix and just confuse the situation even more. However, this is not your typical ""wee heavy"" Scottish beer. It is much closer to a Belgian Trappist in my opinion.","Steamer","Aug 06, 2013"

The nose comprises toasted caramel, orange juice, perfume-y and earthy greens, light lime rind, mild pine needles, light wax, and light toasted coconut. The taste brings in more of the same, but without the orange juice (which instead comes through as a mild bit of orange peel) and with a very light tinge of coffee-ish-ness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda watery feel. Overall, a generally solid bit of Scotch ale, one whose admittedly odd complexity both sets it apart from others in the style and also keeps it from achieving greatness therewithin.

Imagine how light looks when it passes through an object like that. It has a light taupe colored head. The head consists of the microbubbles often seen in nitro-infused beers. The aroma is mild, but rich with toffee and sorghum. The mouthfeel is medium- to full-bodied, wet, and slick. A bit dry on the finish, but only enough to balance things. Sweet sorghum emerges first with faint lemongrass coming in late. I don't pick up the corriander, but this beer seems to be all about balance.

It's odd that I can't pick up the coriander in the aroma, because it's actually quite prominent in Jacobites flavour. In addition to that strong coriander flavour, it's richly malty and medium sweet, and vaguely reminds me of a good doppelbock. Some raisin-like dried fruit character can be discerned. The alcohol is noticeable, but it integrates well with the other elements in the flavour profile. Tastes pretty damned good. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation. Feels slightly sticky.

Overall this was a very interesting beer. It had a nice clean scent and taste with good body, although I'm not sure how much I really enjoyed that blueberry taste.

4.25,2.7,4.5,4.5,4,5,4,"After being completely and utterly impressed by Traquair House Ale, when I saw this, I had to try their Jacobite Ale when I saw it. A dark, rich color, with a bready, sweet and lightly spiced aroma, it was delicious even before I tasted it. The taste is initially sweet, with a chewy, bready middle, and very prominent coriander in the finish. There is caramel and a note of whiskey in here too. Really nice mouthfeel here... just enough tiny bubbles of carbonation to give a little lightness, but very smooth on the palate. My only criticism is that the coriander is a bit strong for my taste... it comes through here much more than a Belgian Wit or other Belgian brews with coriander. But overall, while it doesn't impress me the way their House Ale does (but really, what could live up to that?) this is certainly very drinkable and enjoyable.","apintofknowledge","Oct 29, 2008"

Probably won't buy this on a regular basis due to the quality of American craft brews, but considering it's one of the legends I had to try it and will drink it again. The scent is fulfilling, strongly malty. The appearance is dark in the tone of a stout. Quality taste but not better than I expected (after drinking so many quality American craft brews I expect a lot out of a $5 11 oz bottle). Tastes a lot like a stout. I'm not a spice expert, but I don't experience so much coriander (it's written on the label). Great beer, maybe not worth the $5.

The feel is moderate to well bodied, with soft carbonation leading to a nice silky texture. The brew finishes a tad bitter from the malt with a touch of booziness.

I also picked up something like honey (it may have been something similiar to honey, I'm not sute), and even some yeast, so I don't know if there's bread/dough in there or what. The first thing I picked up was the coffee/chocolate malt taste with a semi-dry finish complemented with corriander for a little spice. Also picked up hints of berries, figs, bubblegum/sugariness and that honey(?). An extremely smooth passing over the tongue although a tad sticky/syrupy for my liking. Still, one of the best beers I've tasted and it is mixed well with the sweetness then hop bite. I had this as a nightcap, and I think it is worth a try as a ""dessert"" beer.

A hint of tobacco and peat, spicy notes (the coriander coming through, but with lots of clove as well), and molasses round it out. Stellar. Taste, as a result, is just a bit of a letdown, lacking both the complexity and the body of the scents. Still deep and malty, but the cherry notes are absent.

3.97,-4.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"11.2 ounce bottle, says best before June 2014. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours brown with a very small fizzy head. It smells like raisins, plums, caramel and coriander. The taste is pretty much the same way it smells, except that there's also molasses, peppery spicyness and a little bit of alcohol. It's mostly sweet, but there's also some bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it goes down very easy and smooth. Overall a tasty beer, probably would be better to drink on a fall/winter night but it's still good on a warm day too.","bluejacket74","Jun 09, 2007"

Body is dark blackish brown almost completely opaque. Smells is strong coriander, I get a sort of berry yogurt smell which is strange, not completely unpleasing, but very different. The malt is there just masked heavily by prune juice smell. Taste is similar with that prune juice character and dark malt undertones. As this brew warms the toasted malt with tiny hints of coffee and chocolate can be spotted, but on the finish its straight prune juice again. The abv is fine and the mouth feel is decent, just slightly watery for a wee heavy, but it leaves something slightly acidic on the very back of my tongue. I really want to like this, but I just cant get past the strange fruit. Maybe its my tongue or a bad bottle, but as it is this beer is just not for me Ill stick to my dirty bastard.","mmcave","Mar 05, 2007"

Like fresh, wild blueberries. Malt is also present in the aroma and maybe a hint of sticky caramel toffee and bubble gum. Smells like candy. Taste is of caramel malty goodness with berries galore, probably from the coriander, ripe dark fruits, light hop bitterness. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden, although this bottle is probably aged a tad. Very refreshing. This would serve good as an apertif beer. It's very juicy.

Flavor is full with lots of yummy esters holding hands with the sweetness and the fininsh is where I get the coriander.

The body is a wonderful near-opaque black, with ruby highlights only when potently backlit. Nose is dominated b a sweet orange smell, which is surely the coriander. Also helped out by a generous portion of sweet malt. Still, somewhat one-dimensional. Taste is again of coriander, with buttery malt coming in behind. Sweet the whole way through. Body is medioum-light. Smooth, with mild carb. Overall, not quite what I expected - I wanted more rich maltiness, but I got sweet and spicy. I prefer the regualr Traquair to this, but it is nice.","mjc410","Aug 05, 2006"
4.15,0.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I was expecting something completely different. When I saw this was infused with corriander (the seed of the cilantro plant) I thought I would get a stong 'soapy' or metallic flavor typically associated with the spice and it's herb. It gave the beer a unique characteristic, but basically blended itself in seemlessly with the beer, which was damned good. The taste of the beer just dropped out from underneath on first tasting. Very clean, with little to no aftertaste. you have to keep drinking it to get a hold on its flavors. For a beer that advertises itself as a corriander beer, it doesn't really reflect its billing, but the beer itself is trully good and should be enjoyed.","dherling","Aug 04, 2006"

Frothy, big bubbled head settles into frothy, big-bubbled lacing over time. The nose has got tons of coriander, along with dates covered in molasses. The overall effect is a touch on the medicinal side. On the palate, this thick, almost syrupy brew starts off with a touch of pinprick carbonation on the tip of the tongue, accompanied by big, sweet malts and some bitter herbs (coriander, I guess). Overall it's big, sweet, and malty, with a bit of medicinal pruniness. This is one of those brews that's more interesting than it is pleasing to the palate. Not that it's bad or anything, just a bit strange.","geexploitation","May 24, 2006"
4.67,12.8,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Mouth: This lightly carbonated beer hits the mouth with a sweet smoky flavor in front and a fruitiness that spans the length of the mouth and on through the swallow. The flavors include blueberries, bananas, a coriander spiciness, toffee, dark roasted coffee, and an alcoholic exhale that warms all the way to the ears. Also reminds me of a candy or bubble gum in the back of the throat - a flavor that remains long after swallowing.","clickpush","May 24, 2006"
4.54,9.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours medium purple, very wine-like texture. Light head and carbonation. Beautiful coloring. Borders on a 5. Nose is a complex bouquet of floral esters and faint hints of grape. Hard to explain, but almost like the worlds greatest air freshener. Unlike any other beer Ive ever come across, and if Traquair ever comes out with ""new car"" Im all aboard. Mouthfeel: thin and lightly carbonated. Goes down almost like wine with very littly carbonation and zero hop presence. Most of the action is in the malt and coriander flavoring. The malt increases as the swallow finishes and this is what offsets the mildly cloying sweetness, thereby giving the beer its backbone. The initial taste almost feels like flavored soda water. With a great balance of abv and solid but not overwhelming taste, I could drink this all day, or at least until nappy nappy time.","BAbaracus","May 24, 2006"
4.4,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Tastes relatively simple, yet quite pleasing. Nice chocolate. Full chocolate with fresh coriander flavor. The flavor holds a hint of saison character (but I was drinking saisons earlier, so, whatever). Earthy...maybe some dry molasses. Body is thin, but silky in someway.

Great drinkability. Alcohol is not at all noticable. This is a very nice beer. I enjoyed it slowly, taking the time to enjoy the subtleties.

Lots of caramel, liquorice, walnut, and a root-beer like sweetness and spiciness. The corriander, though, never really comes into play over the big malts. Mild alcohol flavor and warmth until the end when it grows in harshness. Body is thick, rich and creamy--quite cling-ey. Finishes sweet and a bit drier than expected.","BEERchitect","Nov 03, 2005"

Smells terrific, loads upon loads of malt, caramel, molasses, fruits and is oddly similar to triple imperiale. Upfront the taste is sweet toffee and caramel, then it widens taking out a very full, deep caramelized fruit characteristic and finally dries out with coriander becoming quite evident. There's plums, raisins and perhaps a touch of smoke. As it warms, peaches and apples emerge, and the spice shies away a bit--both on the nose and the tongue. The finish lingers for an age. Hopping is mild and the malt complexity is devastating. Definite barleywine characteristics, as well as similarities to some belgian dark ales, somehow this seems to be accomplished through the coriander...Carbonation is low medium and body is relatively full, creates a thick creamy texture through the mouth. Drinkability is sky high but i refuse to do more than sip. Afterall this did cost 5.99, and is damn good so it needs to last a bit. Almost a 5 in taste, but i try to reserve those.

The aroma is quite nice and rich, and quite intrigueing, I am definitely spending quite a bit of time just smelling the wonderful aroma on this beer. The beer is only lightly sweet, but still finishes with the rich fruity notes that were found in the nose. The finish also has that earthy spice note of coriander.

It must be the coriander, I guess. The flavors all sort of explode on the taste buds and are long lasting. I've always loved strong scottish ales, but this goes to an entirely new dimension.

The body was still a bit thin for all the flavors but there were so many flavors. Figs, dried prunes, raisin skins, juicy cranberries, semi sweet chocolate, molasses, wood, smoke, peat, hazelnuts, the coriander was hardly noticeable to me, maybe b/c of all the other flavors or maybe b/c of the aging of this beer.

The rich aroma led me to a letdown as the flavor was much more subdued than i expected. The coriander flavors were there though they were much less prevelent due to the intemingling of the roasted grain flavors detracting from the spice. The body of this ale is an immense letdown as a scotch wee heavy IMO should have a bit more viscosity and sweetness but this is a rather thin ale in terms of body. For being an ale with such disinction and prestige i would have thought it would taste better but maybe it just isn't my style.

There's some bitter fruit in there... what is it? Grapefruit? No... more like tonic water! This is a very nice, malty toffee, sweet, spicy beer.

Big molasses and licorice flavors, chocolatey, fruity, spicy, so complex you know youre missing half the flavors. Mild alcohol suggestion reminds you to slow down the sipping effortless effort. Wow this was great, maybe even better than expected, a wonderful dessert sipper with a nose that is nothing short of sinful and creates a dependance.

Finishes somewhat smokey with the fruitiness holding up quite well. Interesting beer, well-executed, a different profile is gigging here.","ADR","Apr 04, 2004"

Just too much spice from the coriander the house ale is much tastier in my opinion this is complex but it becomes medicinal in nature and it's quite a job to finish a whole bottle.

I can taste smoked, roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, various types of fruits, apricots?, nectarines?, and that spicy coriander.

WOW. What a complex tasting beer. The rich malts and spiciness interact to make this a very complex and tasty beer. The malt sweetness is balanced by the spiciness. Body is more like a porter or a stout. It has a definite vinous quality as well. Flavors are varied; malts, plums, apples, smoke, chocolate, coriander, vanilla and whole lot more. Smooth.

4.77,15.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Dark brown hue with a reddish trace around the edges, silky beige head, very small, decent retention. No lace. The nose immediately screams buckle-up! The bouquet is spiced with coriander, highlighted with alcohol; plums, fig, maple syrup, and chocolate add depth. Needless to say the invitation is striking. Shockingly light mouthfeel (at first) allows the flavors to meld together beautifully. Sweet malt seems to dominate the palate but that notion only lasts for a split-second the spice of the coriander, the influences of chocolate and the persuasion of alcohol all lends a hand to create a balanced ale. Towards the end a note of plum arises coriander again is noticed at the finish. All I can say is this is a damn tasty beverage with an alcohol punch that socks you right in the brain but it is surprisingly easy to drink, the carbonation is minimal and the thickness on the tongue increases with warmth. Id highly recommend trying one of these, even if you have to pay $7.00 for a 11.2 oz bottle like I did.","bditty187","Jul 06, 2003"

A hint of sherry and licorice. A bit of bitterness.  I don't expect a coriander taste with these combinations.  As Putnam mentions, according to the bottle these are good for another 6-7 years.

4.24,2.4,4,5,4.5,4,3,"Dark brown in hue, w/ clear deep garnet when held to light.  The light tan head settles into a thin, tight layer.  Aromatic spices comprised of coriander and a hint of cumin hit the nose initially, then are followed by light chocolate malt, dark crystal malt sweetness and trace smokiness from the yeast strain. Mild diacetyl butterscotch surfaces as the beer warms.  Overall the aroma is akin to a Belgian wit and British porter hybrid.  Flavorwise, roasted barley bitterness quickly yields to a mixture of sweet caramel malt and assertive coriander. Bittersweet chocolate malt then partially counters the strong, herbal spice and prevents it from being cloying.  Moderately bodied, w/ a smooth mouthfeel lent by the high apparent terminal gravity.  Hop bitterness is meager and lends an overall sweet, but not cloying profile to this brew.  Roasted barley bitterness supercedes the secondary hop bitterness.  Finishes sweet, with darkly toasted grain lingering.  Jacobite is an absolutely unique brew!  It falls into the hybrid category-- If you can't decide between a Scotch and Belgian wit, drink this, since it has elements of both.

The aroma and flavor make this a very interesting beer. The coriander mixed with the very rich, dark malt backbone of this beer made for a very interesting aroma. It reminded me of chocolate covered cherries (the cream kind, not the clear liquid centers) despite the fact that the beer has no cherries in its ingredients. The flavor lacks the cherry notes (although I burped and tasted the chocolate covered cherries). Instead you get a rich toffee and chocolate maltiness with some mild notes of the coriander giving it an interesting taste of something like a bastard child of scotch ale and Belgian abbey ale. There is some bitterness, especially in the finish as the beer warms, but it seems to come from the dark malts as much as from any hops (which were buried under the onslaught of the aromas and flavors of the other ingredients.) The mouth feel if full with a slight cheesiness but not too syrupy. The heaviness of this beer makes it difficult to drink in large quantities or fast, but you'll be satisfied after one and will want to savor it anyway.","aracauna","Jun 09, 2002"
