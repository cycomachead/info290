3,-14.8,,,,,,"The Crack! revealed a well-filled French Broad who was a Wee Heavy. I picked her up and gave her an inverted Glug to kick off our time together. There was a nice pseudo-cascade which settled into three fingers of dense, light-brown head with good retention.  Color was Light-Copper to Copper (SRM = 14.5) and the preciseness is due to the brewery including it on the CAN. Thanks! The nose had an earthy sweetness, sort of medicinal, like Geritol or along those lines. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full.  Taste was quite vegetal, mostly earthy and not at all pleasant. The BJCP app tells me that this is allowable due to the use of peaty malt, but I was not digging it. We used to be admonished NOT to review based on style due to brewersâ€™ interpretations, but if I rated this just on its merits, it would do very poorly. By taking style into account, it at least gets a fighting chance. Finish was semi-sweet but that vegetal taste was going to linger with me for a while. Ugh.","woodychandler","Aug 20, 2014"

Head eventually dissipates into a skim and a band. Only two random strands of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses earthy/peaty malt and a slightly vinous quality. Taste follows nose with the addition of a buttery character. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a lively, almost prickly carbonation; the overall consistency is also a bit on the watery side.

Aroma is a mix of mild malts, both sweet and roasted, with very little hops. Not a nose-catching aroma but it did attract me. For a heavy ale this is rather a light beer. Medium-bodied, at best, it passes smoothly, slightly creamy, as the malts are rather subdued for a little sweet and chewiness; caramel, hints of cocoa, and some toffee along with roasted are in there but nothing that is really outstanding. A dab of fruit flavorings/dryness from the hops, which provide a minor sour fruit and bitter taste for balance in the backend, but are overpowered to be honest.

Malty, but fairly dry for the style with some citrusy bitterness as well, and a dash of anise or fennel in the finish. The mouthfeel is light and on the crisp rather than the rich side of the style.

The smell is very nice. Upfront, without a question, is the smell of scotch. I wonder if this ever touched wood, or scotch for that matter. There are lots of caramelized sugars and a bit of smoky, roasted smells. A bit of esters in the nose as well. The taste is very nice too. I expected booziness after the smell, but there isn't any. The smell has a great smoky flavor, but it isn't to the beef jerkey level. There's an odd roastedness, and its a little less sweet than I would've expected though there's plenty in this, it finishes a little dry with the smokiness coming back in. There isn't a whole lot of depth, but I'm fascinated by what's here. Definitely could be improved upon, with a bit more chewiness and roasted flavors (not smoked malts), maybe junt a hint more sweetness or some hops to cut through the smokiness. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, though there's enough body to satisfy, and nothing really off-putting (unless you don't like smoke), with good carbonation levels. It finishes nice and clean, and is easy to drink, since the alcohol isn't apparent and the beer isn't too intense. I think I'm a bit of a fan, and would recommend it at least once. The scotch smell is really what's so fascinating.","taylorhamrick","Feb 25, 2009"

Other than that, the flavour was mostly malt (as in the nose) with a clean yeast profile, perhaps a bit of butterscotch. The carbonation was sort of coarse and definitely too high, creating a texture that was pretty far from smooth. Body was on the lighter side. Mild dryness too, which I wasn't expecting for the style.
