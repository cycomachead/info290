Spaghettios for sure (wife confirms this). Flavor is nice, with a scotch and malt backbone on top if some sweet dark candy flavors and, yes, a sweet tomato-ey essence. Somewhat unique, but one of the funkiest smelling beers I have encountered. Medium slick mouthfeel, with some creamy finish. Not bad, but a little weird.","BMMillsy","Oct 16, 2013"

I am not trying to slam the beer or anything, but it is a pretty good example...so I would expect it to be in pretty much average packaging. To get it in a 7oz bottle means, IMO, that this is super f**king special. As it turns out, it is OK. It is on the higher side of this style, and coming from a brewer like Roue, it is clean and well presented overall.

The burnt toffee character is reserved. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average beer, but just an average Scotch ale.

The peat seems to echo and perfume in the mouth and into the aftertaste. The carbonation is a wee prickly, the body being medium and sweet.

Wonderful flavor, with deep malt tones, a great smokiness, hints of peat, and a touch of caramel. Goes down quite smoothly, but it does have an odd, almost generic, flavor on the tongue at the very end.","JamesS","Nov 04, 2010"

3.97,3.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"D - Nicely done, there is a great deal of malt character with an appropriate emphasis on toffee. While the malt is central to the experience, there is more than enough hop character to balance things out and it has a touch of English Bitter character as a result. The yeast comes in at the finish with some red apple character that works nicely and makes for a drawn out finish with the toffee and butterscotch.","nickfl","Oct 19, 2010"

3.84,0.3,3,4,4,3,4,"Originally reviewed June 10 2007. 1996 6 oz nip bottle. Aroma is a unique and piquant touch of cedar smoke, british candy, old lemons and school paste. Aged and mellow. Gentle and nice. Nips of random spice perk up. Pours a clear burnished deep bronze amber, with a rim of micro white bubble and a few skeins of percolation, seriously. On the tongue, a matured cherry bark blends with old malt husks and candied pears. Quite oxidized hops find their way through and bite as a bit of old cask dusk. It actually bubbles a little bit and released a lit hiss upon opening. Flavors are subtle and marry with a sherry note. Light vinousness finds a home amongst salted minerals and salt-water taffy. Actually, I think this has held up alright. Any beer 11 years old is going to show signs of wear, but for a Scotch Ale with hops, itÂ’s doing okay. I think I like old hops. Actually, in reality, IÂ’m blown away at how good this Scotch Ale is 11 years later, after having purchased it from a minifridge at a shitty liquor store in Grand Island, Nebraska. A hidden gem.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 15, 2007"
4.07,6.3,1.5,4.5,4.5,3,4,"Poured from a 7oz bottle which read ""Bottled in 1998", and on the reverse, ""Best when aged for 6 months"". I think we have that covered. Appearance was just short of offensive having absolutely no head. The lifeless, murky, brown liquid looked like something you might pour out of an old rusty pipe full of rain water. The smell, and everything else, however, was really something! Fantastic aromas of chocolate, sweetened coffee, caramel, and perhaps some candied dark fruit are all present here. Taste, too, is full of nearly everything in the smell, with the addition of a rather nice medium dry finish that sort of reminds me of toasted cereal. Mouthfeel is nothing to get overly excited about, as there is virtually no CO2 at all present here, and the liquid, while not water-thin, is close to it. I would imagine that this was probably even better in its prime, but here, 9 years later, it's still a nice brew. Too bad I had only one.","SilentSabre","May 22, 2007"
4.13,7.8,3,5,4,3.5,4,"The beer is surprisingly light on the tongue (perhaps it is a bit cold), but begins to coat the mouth as it passes on through. The finish is quite complex and interesting, it is almost smoky, slightly astringent, but definitely long and satisfying. The taste is lightly sweet, but has a full malt character with competing notes of toffee, chocolate and a slight burnt caramel note. The toffee note is definitely the dominant characteristic of this beer. This is quite the sipping contemplative brew, though the flavor did not quite live up to the awesome aroma.","Gueuzedude","Sep 01, 2005"

3.44,-10.2,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Bottled in 2000, Appearance: After a straight up and down pour forms a dark brown amber cloudy tone with a thin bubbly cream head leaves rings of speckled lacing. Aroma: Deep plum tones toasted caramel notes and a strong alcoholic force brewing there. Taste: Semi sweet air of smoked peated malts, bitterness is there too but not much of a dominant flavor of any kind. Malts seem stale here a bit of diacetyl cooking but still very drinkable. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied ale not bad low carbonation, I'm guessing this one didn't age that well. Drinkability: Still a decent Scotch ale the roasted malts stood up with a smoky finish pretty solid brew that I find tame for Rogue, overall drinkability is somewhere in the middle.","WVbeergeek","Feb 22, 2004"

Mouthfeel is thinner than I expected (somewhat watery), but still very smooth. Exquisite taste consists of sweet malt, caramel, toasted nut, oats and a touch of oak. The rolled oats used during the brewing process adds such a great smoothness of both texture and flavor to this Scotch ale. I wish I would have purchased more than one bottle. If I can find this again, I will definitely stock up.","Winter","Jul 25, 2003"

4.12,7.6,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured in to the glass an amber color with ruby red hues when held to the light. Cloudy. The head was a cream/white color, not long lasting, 15 seconds I believe. The aroma was some what sweet with hints of coffee, malt, some chocolate, medium to light fruits, yeasty, and a light hop bite. The taste was creamy surprising due to the lack of head (I would have thought), tastes of malt, caramel, yeast/bread, some of the fruit came out and tones of alcohol and hops were also present. Small bottle with a lot compressed into it. I would like to get a few more bottles to enjoy and get more out of them. I liked it none the less.","Jarod","Jan 22, 2003"
4.36,13.8,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2000 - 7 oz bottle. It poured clear until I hit the yeast at the bottom of the bottle - thus, a hazy auburn body topped by a very thin off-white head that drops almost immediately. The nose, however, makes up for any inadequacies in the appearance with a bold sweet caramel that can express coconut, light fruit, and even a dull earthiness as it's swirled in the glass. The body is full with a very mild carbonation that leaves it exceptionally smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor doesn't deliver the bold sweetness that the nose indicates, but rather, a more balanced and complex maltiness with some bready character, soft chocolate, a firm bitterness, some limited fruitiness, some light smoke and a touch of alcohol. It finishes dry with some mild hop flavor and the light alcohol and smokiness laying about the mouth and throat. Very nice.","NeroFiddled","Dec 31, 2002"

4.47,16.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I picked up this 1998 bottle about a month ago.  The bottle suggests aging for 6 months, let's see what 8 times that amount has done for it.  Head is completely gone due to the aging.  Nice color though, deep dark brown.  Extremely intense caramel aroma, with some nutty sweet coffee aroma underneath.  Tasting this I find that the full flavors I expect from a great scotch ale are mostly still there, and even more complex than in others.  It seems that the body has suffered a bit though, I would imagine that this was once much more full-bodied.  Many rich, sweet flavors, including caramel, chocolate, and roasted/coffee-like character, as well as a wood-like character in the background.  Faintly smoky.  Even without a head, it still has a nice, creamy mouthfeel.  It would really be great if they started brewing this again for us all to enjoy.  I'd probably give it an even higher rating with proper aging, and I know I'd be drinking it by the gallon!","hyuga","Sep 29, 2002"

This is a good Scotch ale (although the head on mine was nonexistant) I can't see paying XS prices. Lovely complex malt structure with the Caramunich and oats comming through. Subtle hopping, if it wasn't so expensive I could enjoy a couple of pints of this at 1 siting.","mattmaples","Sep 22, 2001"
