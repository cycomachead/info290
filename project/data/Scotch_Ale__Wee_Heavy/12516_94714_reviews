"Great aroma and taste of vanilla and bourbon. Maybe a little heavy on vanilla, but I like that."
""
"TASTE: Thick maltiness, smooth, creamy, sweet, alcohol, warming, woody, brown sugar, mildly peppery, mineral, wood tannin, bourbon, faint vanilla, sweet finish"

"Why don't they age scotch ales on scotch barrels? Makes no sense."

"Had tasting with a friend of three scotch ales, Scotty Karate, Wulver and Backwoods Bastard, in that order. Expected ratings to be 3rd, 2nd and 1st. If you think BB is very good, as I do,  Wulver is even better. More bourbon, more vanilla, really quite a treat."
""
"Very boozy on the nose at first, as it warms this beer opens up and becomes a thing of beauty."
""
""
""
""
"One of the very best Wee Heavy's I've had!  Smooth vanilla and booze finish."
""
""

"Boozy bourbon. Not really my thing. It was a bit too much."

"Had at Pittsburgh Winter BeerFest."

"Belongs on your bucket list."
"O: an excellent Scotch ale - one of the finest and as far as I've had, very true to style; these ales are perfect for barrel-aging, as the flavors and feels meld seamlessly together. This edges out the others I've had from the style, even - just barely - Backwoods Bastard..."

"A beautiful beer, gorgeously presented."
""
""
""

"Fantastic sweet barrel aroma that reminds me of BA4D - very sweet pronounced coconut, vanilla, and sweet toffee.  Wee heavy is a great style for a barrel as it allows for significant influence without being over-barreled.  The palate is a bit thin and doesn't carry the complexity of the aroma.  Still, though, a very nice scotch ale worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Top notch sipper.  Drinks slow and with potency.  Definitely worth seeking out."

"O: A very good representation of BA Scotch Ale. Honestly prefer this one over Backwoods Bastard, which is one of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious beer.  One of the best things I can recall having from Thirsty Dog."
""
""
""
""
"This is one amazing brew. If it weren't for BA, I wouldn't have bought this. If I can't get BCBW, I'm going for this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some of the flavors were far too stark."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Torst (Brooklyn, NY), 5 oz poured into a wine glass. Clear, light cola brown color. Molasses, sweet malty aroma. Big malty, nutty, lightly toasted taste without deeper burnt notes; vanilla, barrel notes. Relatively light bodied given full flavors; low carbonation."

""

"Overall: man there is a lot going on with this one. I usually like beers nice hot and fresh but this one is a bit much. almost spot on with the look and feel but I think the flavors just need some time to get along beer and mellow out a bit. next time I plan on putting some years on it."
""
""
""
"Overall - The is an exceptional version of the style with barrel aging. The barrel aging works well in conjunction with the style of beer. Well done!"
""
""

"Very heavy on bourbon, but super smooth for a 12% BBA beer. Much better than Backwoods Bastard."

"This wolf can hunt. Split with the wife from 12oz into stem less wine glasses. Looked great. Nose was amazing, bourbon, vanilla, caramel. Vanilla & oak hints and nice bourbon (balanced though) on the tongue. Velvet mouthfeel. Wulver dominated Backwoods in my reviews. Need to do a side-by-side. Get it. Get it, now."

"I've had a couple better beers, but never a better Wee Heavy. The 11 months of barrel aging pays off. The aroma & complexity of flavors is amazing!"
"This was one of those great beer moments for me. I was given a bottle and did not know anything about it. Felt like something bourbon ahead and it was in the front of my cellar/fridge. Gave it a quick whiff and had to do the double take. Wonderful caramel bourbony nose. First thing that came to mind after taste was was a fizzy JD single barrel with a splash of coke, yet it was somehow not too boozy. I loved every sip of this. If you have friends who love bourbon but not beer, i highly suggest you get them to try this. Awesome."

"THe best Wee Heavy BB Sctoch ale you can buy, well worth the high price tag and a must try for any and all craft beer drinkers."

"Just had the Founders Backwoods a couple of days ago and this sure beats that excellent beer. I am simply in love. Tried, but hard to give any suggestions. Worth it every cent."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am in love with a Wee-Heavy! A regular Wee-Heavy I usually am not that impressed with, yet age one in a bourbon barrel for 12-14 months! I am thoroughly impressed with this offering. I had Backwoods Bastard which is great in it's own right, yet doesn't hold a candle to Wulver. This brew for being 12% is one of the most drinkable High Gravity beers on this planet! With that said this brew is Recommended!"
""
"t/m/o - rather impressive beer. Taste matches the nose but disability is through the roof. Abv is well integrated and this puppy slides down too easily. Not sure why you don't hear more about this one. Super good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"From bottle at home. Excellent brew. Pours to a firm off white head that descends to a light lacing. Liquid has the look of a strong coffee. Aroma remind me of some nice barley wines. Toffee & vanilla with no bitterness & a pleasant sweetness. A very full body rounds out this 12% ale. Like most rich victuals less is more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This may be the single best execution of an aged wee heavy I have ever had, including the Founders Backwoods Bastard. Incredibly easy to drink, allows the malty sweetness to star with the bourbon barrel as the supporting cast, hides the ABV well - this is a really well done beer."
""
"O - This is an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is simply an exceptional beer, and a wonderful expression of a Wee Heavy.  It's hard to think of something that needs to be tweaked.  They set out to create a beer whose purpose was to spend almost a year in bourbon barrels rather than simply be a barrel-aged version of an offered style, and they've succeeded in spades.  Aging this in the cellar may well make it perfect."
"Wulver is the best wee heavy on the market!!!"

"Not sure of the date, but I bought this a while ago.  Deep mahogany colored body with a little creaminess on the surface that all but disappears.  Smooth bourbon aromas, woody spice, molasses, toffee, berries, and coconut.  Not particularly hot smelling, which is nice.  Flavor is smooth and rich...wow.  The bourbon blends nicely with the base beer, which results in something sweet like pure honey and toffee ice cream, vanilla, chocolate, and brown sugar, but absolutely no harsh barrel notes.  Warm cinnamon way in the back along with some coconut.  Super smooth, creamy body has some thickness and leaves a bit of heat in the throat.  Sweet-as-fuck, which is my only gripe, but this is a dessert beer, right?"

"Pours the deepest brown I could imagine, with the slightest red hints around the edges. Almost no head, but leaves a moderate amount of lacing on the glass. Heavy oak and stone fruit in the aroma with some tobacco, vanilla and raisin. Chocolate came out in the taste particularly strong in the beginning then gave way to the bourbon, with an emphasis on oak and vanilla as well. Creamy mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation to carry everything. Nice amount of sediment at the end."

"Unfortunately quite thin and flat."
""

"Oh my goodness...this is soooo good. The smooth malt blending with the woody bourbon is off the hook! After just a couple sips, this might be the best scotch ale I have ever had. One of the smoothest 12%'ers for sure, at the very least. I wish I could write more, but I already finished my 6 oz sample...want moar."

"The mouthfeel is heavy-bodied, with low amounts of carbonation. The finish is sticky and leaves the taste hanging around for a while - works really well. Overall, this is an excellent brew. It is extremely drinkable for the ABV, and the complexities are crazy. Everything works together in beautiful ways and keeps you going back for more. The price is a bit high, but understandable for this brew."
""
"A year has done wonders for this marvelous beer. I can't wait too see what happens to this one with time."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great tasting brew.  Must enjoy strong bourbon barrel brews.  This is a whopping 12% alcohol and the taste is unreal. I highly recommend this for those who enjoy a strong beer.  I cannot wait to try others from Thirsty Dog!   The flavors are unbelievable, making it a tasty beer."
"O- My mind is properly blown. Easily one of my top 5 BBA beers. The aroma alone makes me wish I had more than just one of these."

" The flavor brings a lot of malt with moderately woody flavor and light caramel with buttery toffee-like taste with slight toasted character and mild warming flavor from bourbon in the background. The taste has a good cohesive sweetness with barrel blended well into the base and nicely balanced malt with scotch ale flavor smooth yet still strong as it finishes more on the sweet side. Overall this is a great mix of scotch ale with bourbon in an almost seamless combo -this is like a match made in heaven with malt complexity enhanced nicely by the woody barrel aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wulver is an enjoyable Wee Heavy that stays rather true to the style. A slightly more robust flavor profile and a bigger mouthfeel however might have lent itself well to the barrel aging."
""
"Wow, that is one sweet SOB. Barrel is really prevalent, but man, the sweetness takes this b*tch to a whole new level. And the ABV is VERY noticeable. Tasted like liquor at times. Also, it got sweeter as it warmed up. I loved the first few sips, then the sweetness started to get a bit much. Glad I shared it with a buddy because it would have been too much for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very strong. I expected this however it was a bit strong for my taste. I am a very big bourbon fan so I decided to give this a shot. Strong rich coffee sent with a similar bite to the tongue. Heavy in abv and you can tell. I feel like one or two of these 12% would knock me out. Not my favorite, but doable."
"A - dark rich brown color, like a stout. S - nutty hint, strong coffee stout aroma. Hint of alcohol. T - tasted like a stout with a smack of yummy bourbon at the end. M - Thick and rich, no complaints. O - about what I expected, not gonna have to drink to many of these to enjoy a good night."
""
""
""
"This is a very good beer and well worth the price. The flavor is excellent, the aroma is excellent, the palate is very good, and the appearance is good but somewhat lacking because of the absence of lacing."
"O: This beer definitely tastes strong, but rather manages to mask most of the alcohol from the taste (except for the bourbon). It is a very nice beer to sip and savor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is chestnut brown with a thin beige collar. The aroma brings a huge dose of bourbon, followed by malt, brown bread, oak. Bourbon steals the show. Delicious flavor, following the aroma. An almost tannic character. The aroma is the star of the show here. Thin body with a light feel on the palate. A touch of spice with a hearty malt body. Very tasty."

"Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of a Bourbon Barrel Aged Scotch Ale, I think they weren't joking around when they said this beer was made just to be aged in barrels, the flavors work so well with barrel and I can see a good amount of thought went into the base beer and it seems like it sat in the barrel for the perfect amount of time and it achieved some killer balance. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, a little rich, a little sticky, not crisp, a little silky, not too filling and the taste did an awesome job at holding my attention, I wouldn't mind sipping on this all night and it really amazes me how smooth it is. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel and drinkability, they were among some of the best I've experiences in a Bourbon Barrel aged beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything I would change, but I did think it was a little pricey and it would be great to see it at around the same price point as Backwoods Bastard. I would for sure buy this beer again, and I'm kicking myself for not picking up more when I had the chance. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone and it's a must try if you like bourbon barrel aged beers. All in all I was straight up impressed with this beer, i had some high expectations and it met every single one of them and even surpassed them in some aspects. This is without a doubt my new favorite beer from Thirsty Dog and it's right up there with Backwoods Bastard as my favorite of the style, these beers are very similar and I would have to have them side by side to fully get an idea as to which is the better beer. Fantastic job guys, keep up the great and impressive work."

"One of the best, if not the best, wee heavy I can recall trying. I'd definitely recommend seeking this out and hope to have it again sometime."

"For a scotch ale this is not bad looking. It is murky and brown, but there is a decent head and decent belgian lacing. The initial aroma is a blast in the face of super fresh bourbon barrel, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, etc. As the beer warms you can pick up some more earthy notes. Downside it is kind of a one note aroma, uni-dimensional. To start with the flavor mirrors the aroma, as the beer warms though it becomes easier to pick out chewy raisin, vinious flavors, and a smokey maple syrup quality. It's nice. Thick, sticky, slick, however not cloying over the palate. Really good beer here. Actually....love it. Here is the problem...it is 28 dollars a four pack, that's a lot and I think value is important."

"My first beer tried from Thirsty Dog- and I am thirsty for more."

""

""
""
"O: How is this beer so underrated?! I was blown away by its complexity and decadence. This bottle must be a few years old because of how mellow and integrated the flavors are. I could sip this all day. Thank you again, TurdFurgison!"
""
""
"Happy Holidays, BA!"
"O: Wow is this tasty. I paired it with a piece of chocolate cake I had at home and it was a match made in heaven. It would probably make a nice dessert by itself too- given its smoothness and 12% I could see it creeping up on you in a hurry. Definitely give this one a try"
""
"Clear dark amber pour with a deep dark ruby cast. Nice head and lacing that retains for 3 minutes. The nose is bourbon over sweet dark fruit, mostly plum and raisin, coupled with notes of vanilla, caramel and oak over molasses. Almost full bodied with a very rich creamy texture. The superb flavor profile is complex, yet balanced. Unlike Founder's Backwoods Bastard, bourbon doesn't predominate. You get a complex balance of bourbon against the flavors of the nose. It begins with the dark fruit, progresses to the caramel and molasses based sweetness, then bourbon and the associated vanilla and oak notes. The finish is a smooth bourbon forward sweetness counter balanced with an oak astringency that flows into that nice alcoholic burn at the back of the throat. Compared to FBB, the Wulver wins by a nose for the Wee Heavy title."
""
"O: Interesting brew. It's big and complex. Pretty well balanced too. But boy is it sweet. Like drinking maple syrup sweet. It's got that same cloying sweetness that you get in a lot of the bigger He'brew beers. Like drinking pure molasses. I am glad this bottle was only 12 ounces because I don't think I'd make it through a larger format. Sipper for sure. Dessert beer."
"O - One of the best wee heavies right up there with Backwoods Bastard. A really nice sipper for a cold night."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I would call this an occasional treat for more reasons than the price. It's sweeter than other barrel-aged Scotch ales (like Backwoods Bastard), but executed better than most (Central Water's for example). The availability of Wulver makes it an excellent contender as a flagship beer for a brewery that should work to emphasize their higher ABV offerings. Do they barrel age Bernese? If not, they should try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very good beer but when Backwoods Bastard is one of my favorite beers naturally I will compare it to that beer. I just think that it is very close to BB but not quite there, plus the fact that this is over twice the price per bottle really is a negative on Wulver. Still a fine example of bourbon barrel wee heavy. I found this beer interesting in that at 12% it pushes Ohio's ABV law about to the limit."
""

""
""
""
""
"O-one off the best BA Wee Heavies I have tried, great for sipping on a cold night"
""

"Wulver is a near-perfect wood aged beer. Where the scotch industry has used bourbon barrels for centuries, its no surprise to find all that wood-aged character playing out on a base beer that supports the wood seamlessly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the best beer that I have drank from Thirsty Dog! Wulver is effortlessly the very best BA Wee Heavy that I have drank. Backwoods bastard doesn't even hold a candle to Wulver. Wulver has many layers of flavors and fantastic complexity found in this beers aroma and flavor profile. A great beer to slowely sip on and contimplate its many complexities. I cant remember enjoying a BA Wee Heavy as much as I am enjoying this beer right now! I hope this is a yearly release by Thirsty Dog, they would be crazy not to release this brew on a yearly basis."

"Pours a brownish copper with less than a finger of tan head that enjoyed some decent retention. The nose has soft but distinct bourbon notes. The malt profile is weak for the style and the body is also too thin to properly balance with the bourbon flavors. The bourbon almost completely takes over on the finish and this offering ends up tasting like a shot rather than a beer."

""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, the best wee heavy I've had. Makes me want to stand in the cold rain wearing a kilt while bagpipes play in the distance. 10/10 will drink again."

"Best wee heavy I think I've ever had."

"O-best wee heavy I've had. Will seek out again asap."

"Bottle from a quick trade. Big time thanks! Pours dark brown with very little head, which is off white and recedes quickly. Not completely opaque with some ruby showing through the edges of this one. Aroma of chocolate, bourbon, caramel, vanilla. Flavor is boozy bourbon up front alongside some sweet chocolate, then fades nicely into overwhelmingly vanilla and caramel notes. The oaky bourbon and vanilla lingers a good while. The body in this is not as thick and chewy as I had expected, with solid medium carbonation to go along with a medium heavy mouthfeel. It nevertheless tastes excellent with lots of layers of flavor coming across the palate. A nice exhibition of the bourbon barrels here. Yum."
"Overall/Comments: Wow. An extremely complex and interesting beer that was excellent. A great beer that will probably age very well. More that one of these would be dangerous. A must try beer. Consumed 7/22/13. Classified as a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy @ 12.8% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had hyped this beer up and it was one of the beers I was most looking forward to trying. The appearance was a little light and pale for a beer of the style. The nose had faint vanilla notes that were hardly detictable. The taste was lacking as well, it seemed watered down and lacked any complexity. Mouthfeel was watery and thin. If I hadn't seen the bottle opened I would swear that this beer was cut to serve more people. Maybe it's because the night started with a big barrel aged stout but I found this beer lacking in every category. I would try it again just to see if I was given a bad bottle."
""
""
""
"Thirsty dog really knocked it out of the park."
"Overall- One of Ohio's best offerings. A must try for all serious craft beer drinkers. At $25 per 4-pack, the beer isn't cheap, but worth every penny."
"D: really good stuff and one of the best bourbon barrel aged brews Ive had. unbelievably smooth. I have one in the cellar, but I really don't know what it will do to this brew. might even be better fresh."
""
""
"At these prices this is a no go for me. I will say make sure you drink this one on the colder side, it isn't an imperial stout that can be had at 60-70 degrees and still be wonderful. It needs to be in the 40's."
"Once, I was at a burrito restaurant in a place you wouldn't expect to find delicious burritos. I'd never been. It was two in the morning and the guy in front of me was drunk. I asked him how the food was. He grabbed me by the shirt and said ""I'd kill my mother for this s**t."" He thought he meant those burritos (which are indeed the best on the planet), but that kind of accolade should be reserved for a beer like Wulver. Amazing."
""
"I have never downed a beer this fast - absolutely ridiculous, but I couldn't quit reaching for the glass. My first sip I thought ""meh"" but it improved every time I put my worshipful lips up to it. Excellent: close to top shelf."
"Overall, this was a very nice beer. Yes it is a bit on the pricey side, but treat yourself once in a while."
""

"First time I had this it was at the brewery on tap. Based on that experience, I have had no problem ever since paying $24 a 4 pack for it to be a permanent resident in my home. Aroma of toffee, vanilla, caramel, molasses, wood, sweet dark fruits, and last, but not least, bourbon. Taste follows everything you smell with some peat moss to boot. The very subtle, perfectly integrated bourbon up front. The deep, rich scotch ale flavors on the back end. A slow, mild heat in the finish. I can't overstate how balanced and smooth this is for a 12% BA beer. The body is just a hair on the thin side for a wee heavy, but expected. Overjoyed that this is in my back yard. I won't say that there isn't another brewery making something as good, but I haven't had it and can't imagine anything being better. This is like a Backwoods Bastard, Bourbon County style. World class +. Look me up if you can't find it."
""
"o - Overall a very nice BA scotch ale, and another really good BA beer from Thirsty Dog. I liked the BA Siberian Night a little bit better but this is up there with it as one of the best beers I've had from them. Worth checking out."

"Overall: The most bourbon-forward of my three favorite barrel aged Scotch Ales (this plus Backwoods Bastard and Ride the Lion). A well crafted beer by any standards. Is it worth the often-charged $10 per bottle? You need to decide but it's a must-try for Wee Heavy lovers."
"Overall not a bad BA beer, but not digging the wood and too long in the barrels...."

"Overall, I was a little disappointed by this beer because I expected more complexity but instead it was dominated by the bourbon. This is the first barrel aged beer I have had since Bourbon County Brand Stout so my expectations are slightly skewed. However, it is still a good beer and I would recommend it."
""
"O- Very good barrel aged wee heavy. Not the most complex I've had but it accomplishes the bourbon forward flavor that I like in the style."

"Definitely something I look forward to drinking again, easily my favorite BA Scotch Ale that I've had."

"Overall, a great sipper. Not for a long night of drinking, but perfect for staying in on a cold, winter night. I will go out of my way to get more of this beer."

"O- Overall this is a good BA scotch ale. The dark fruit notes are a bit atypical and give this scotch ale hints of Belgian dark ale. This brew doesn't hide the booze-but it certainly isn't off putting either. I'd like the beer to taste more like it smells. On a side note-my husband absolutely thinks this beer is exceptional."

"Wulver pours up with ample effervescence creating ample lacing that creates a tightly clustered ring of beigish-white bubbles that manage to hold on above the bright burnt reddish-brown body. Alcohol certainly diminishes the head retention. The aromatics are simply divine with nuances of Four Roses Kentucky Straight Bourbon that show some spicy & sweet notes of rye, cinnamon & sweet molasses which carry a hint of roasted barley, deep caramel, cherry & vanilla. The alcohol is noted and certainly gives hints to the strength contained within. The flavor starts off very cloying at first with big hits of charred brown sugar e.g. Steen's Pure Cane Syrup before the underlying spicy hops & bourbon character help lend balance towards the very warming & slightly stealthy alcohol laded finish. Wulver is really a Werewolf in disguise, as it starts off innocent enough before unleashing the beast. Beware of the full moon or prepare for Wulver's fangs & claws to ripe out your throat!"

"Brown pour with a tan head. The aroma has some strong bourbon notes with a lot of maple, vanilla and peat malt character. The flavor is similar. The Scotch and peat notes come through up front, but are complimented by a heavy dose of bourbon character. I get a lot of maple, oak, vanilla and whiskey notes that really add to the base beer. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Pours a thick dark brown with a tiny light tan head. Smell is vanilla, bourbon, and oak with some butterscotch and molasses. Bourbon and vanilla dominate the taste with hints of the butterscotch and molasses. Heavier bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. Overall a great scotch ale. Had this side by side with Founder's Backwoods Bastard and prefer this, heavier body and stronger vanilla notes with less booziness."
""
""
"No head but bits of lacing on a clear copper with amber hues body. Aroma of oak, wet towels, bourbon, caramel, red wine and molasses. Flavor follows with an excellent complex mixture including notes of vanilla, caramel, bourbon and oak with a nice balance between sweetness and boozy bourbon although not at all overwhelming boozy. The base beer is still well represented it seems. Light carbonation and medium to full, oily body. Very nice beer. Easy to drink for the style. Would love to come across this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. It is surprisingly very smooth the whole way through. It leaves just the faintest residue at the back of the throat. Carbonation is just right- subdued."
""
""
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with toffee and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a barrel aged presence that is slightly better in the aroma in my opinion."

"O-as good as they say. As great as Ohio is doing with IPAs(Head Hunter, White Rajah, Bodhi, GReat Lakes offerings) it's good to see a big beer holding its own against the big boys. I think this might be a hair better than Backwoods Bastard, one if my favorites."

"Poured into a 16 oz snifter, not sure of the bottle date. Pours a gorgeous dark amber with, a quarter inch off white head, that leaves behind some attractive lace. Smell is all about the toffee, caramel, vanilla, and brown sugar bourbon dipped raisins. Taste is really the same, but vanilla and toffee dominate, with the other flavors in a supporting role. Body is medium, with enough life, a touch dry, and a sipper for sure. This is a fairly smooth monster of a beer, that really deserves its recognition and tickles the palate in the best way. Reviewed on barrel aged beer day and a delicious treat."

"Clear dark town pour, almost no carbonation except a thin tan halo around the edges. The nose is potent, overwhelming butterscotchy caramely sweetness, little bite. The taste is relatively potent barrel-y sweetness, a bit of prune, tobacco, heavy flavors that coat the palate. The mouthfeel is relatively heavy/syrupy as well, pure caramelized wood sugar sweetness, and almost no bite. Really rounded flavors, masked ethanol, drinkable, and certainly worth trying."

"The appearance is a dark color with a hint of some amber. No head. The nose is a lot of bourbon and sweetness. As soon as I took a sip, I was blown away. I literally said aloud, ""Wow. Wow."" I was really shocked by this beer. I taste a lot of vanilla, and the mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat like velvet. It's creamy. You taste the bourbon but oaky, caramel, vanilla sweetness balances everything out. To be honest, this is one of the best beers I've ever had. Excellent beer from Thirsty Dog."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was a recent release. Pours moderately hazy and cloudy deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense off white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, clove, oak, molasses, light chocolate, pepper, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with amazing complexity and balance of malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, vanilla, clove, oak, bourbon, brown bread, molasses, chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, vanilla, clove, oak, bourbon, chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of malt and barrel flavors; with absolutely perfect balance of barrel/malt and zero cloying sweetness on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class barrel aged scotch ale. All around insane complexity and balance of malt and barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. Amazing."

"What a beer! It's everything I hoped it would be. As much a big, bourbon-barrel-aged English Barleywine as a Scotch Ale. It packs a sizable, sweet, boozy punch, yet still insists on teasing you with its power. The brewers took this one right to the limit. One more microbe of booziness, and it would slide completely over the edge and become a chore to drink. It is wonderful how it toes the precipice without falling in and serves itself up as a classic sipper. If I had to compare this to Backwood's Bastard, I'd say this compares to Backwood's Bastard like BCBS compares to KBS. Interpret that any way you like. Me, I'm gettin' back into this here glass. Cheers!"

"O: What a surprise. One of the best scotch ales I've ever had. Would buy and recommend all day long."

"Overall, a great way to end the evening's drinking , after a couple of summer ales early on, Nursed this for an hour or so, and enjoyed every minute. Have one more in the fridge, will try to pour a bit more agressively, to see if head can be maintained. Nicely done, Thirsty Dog."

"Very nice barrel aged Scotch Ale that drinks pretty nicely. The bourbon pounds its chest and flexes hard in the aroma, yet still shows you that it has a softer side when you finally decided to take a sip. It's like when you find out that the 240 pound, weight lifting, muscle head jock cries whenever he watches the Notebook. Get your Kleenex ready, bro. Thanks again, Kevin."
""
""
"Overall: This is the best BA Scotch Ale I've had. Thirsty Dog really set a new standard for BA scotch ales with this beer. For me, it beats out Backwoods by just a little. I had them side by side, and I felt the Wulver was just a little better. It was also very hard to compare though, since both are world class beers."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very nice BBA wee heavy, a bit on the sweet side but the flavors are nice overall and the booze is very well-hidden."
"One of the better brews I've had in a while. Weakness being this slight thinness, but drinks very easy. For the style this is great, For the price probably only a one time try though. Glad I picked this up before the fourth of July going through Ohio."

"My sister in law got this for me while in Ohio and she said it was pretty pricey, doubt I would grab it again but if you see it give it a try."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a thistle glass, the beer pours a mostly clear reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is very sweet, the brew smells like caramel, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, dark fruit, and molasses. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some nuts and a bit of chocolate. It's a very sweet tasting brew full of malty goodness! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick, smooth and very easy to drink. It certainly doesn't drink like a 12% ABV brew. I think this is a pretty good brew overall. Yeah, it's pricey at $23.99 a 4-pack, but it's tasty and I don't regret buying it. Luckily I have 3 bottles left! Worth trying for sure!"
"Was expecting a bit more from it honestly. but a very nice drinking brew. not that i'd trade for it, but if i saw it on the shelf i may pick a 4 pack up.. i'm waiting for it to warm up and see if more of the nuances come out.."

"Pours a deep rich amber with a thinner but well sustained slight off white head,just great color clarity going on here.Wow the aromas are mind blowing,big sweet caramel and vanilla with a toastiness from the barrel,it has almost a pecan pie-like element to it to go along with dark fruit dipped in vanilla tinged bourbon.Mellow but full feel in the mouth,quite creamy with low carbonation.Vanilla and caramel flavors,almost like spiced rum ball,(if you have ever had one you know what Iam talkin about),there is this faint nuttiness that keeps me harkening back to pecan pie.Damn Thirsty Dog have hit home runs in their barrel aged beers,do more!"

"Overall this is the best wee heavy that I have ever had. So smooth and delicious, at $7.99 per bottle i wasnt going to pull the trigger but an employee was raving about it, so i gave it a shot. WOW. i was not disappointed. Going to be picking up a 4 pack of this despite the heavy price tag. It's that good."

"D- this is an insanely good beer that earns its high price tag. Between this and BBA Siberian night, thirsty dog has some of the best beers in the galaxy. I prefer BBA Siberian night because I favor the style, but this is the best damn wee heavy to cross my face, thanks to the precise 11 month bourbon barrel aging that fits this style so well. I love you, thirsty dog. I love you with all my senses."
"O: Exceptional brew and a really good example of what Thirsty Dog can do. If you are a fan of Backwoods Bastard and similar beers, this is one to seek out."

"LATER NOTE: It did come out in bottles, at least in a limited run, and the bottled version is as good as the draft. (The brewery tells me they had some trouble getting the label approved by the US government, so it took a while.) I wasn't able to make good on my word to stock up on it because it sells for six bucks a bottle, but I've been buying it while it's available as my budget permits."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light kiss of carbonation. Not bad but nit something I would have again in any quantity larger than a couple ounces. Its an interesting change of pace for the style but too sweet and medicinal for me to really dig."
""
"Served from growler into a Green Man snifter. Poured a massively dark reddish brown with a half finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, wood, sweet alcohol, red wine spices, vanilla, and sweet barrel. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, vanilla, spices, wood, and barrel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one really screamed barrel to me. That nice sweet woodiness with a kiss of vanilla shined throughout and really made this one quite pleasant. With all of this it still managed to be quite well balanced and complex at the same time. I just hate that so few have gotten to try this one as of this review as it is definitely one of the better ones I’ve had from Thirsty Dog’s barrel program. This is saying a lot as I usually do not like this style. Well done Thirsty Dog, well done."

"A little darker than normal, as expected from the ol bourbon barrel doi g its thing. In fact, it's darn near black! A thin layer of head stays a while--this big boy beckons like a mythological siren.... The nose is straight bourbon. It's like I've hanged myself upside down in a bourbon barrel. Soggy wet oak with vanilla undertones bombard the malty wee heavy. The taste confirms an earthy, bourbony goodness. This makes me wonder why more wee heavys aren't BBA. I'm not really a fan of the basic style, but it's as if it hugs the bourbon influence with lots of love and kisses! That sweet oaky bourbon really imparts its influence to what might otherwise be a malty mess. I can't help. It compare it to the template of a Backwoods Bastard...and this one hold its own! I'd like to try 'em side-by-side. A deliciously done dog from Thirsty, Ohio! :-)"
