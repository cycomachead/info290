"Overall:  Very much lie Bell's Amber, but with firmer bittering hops on the end.  Would consider this more an Amber than an ESB; a very American take on the style.  Plan on making this (or the non-nitro) a yearly regular."
""
"This was a flat bitter mess. Poured the beer into a pint glass. There was no head. Aroma was bitter and stale. I had one sip and poured it out. It could have been a bad bottle."

"The entire Nitro line with Left Hand is groundbreaking quality, great beer, quality flow, and great flavor!"
"Very average bottle of beer."

"12 oz bottled poured hard into an English pint.  Good flavor, great texture as expected."
""
""
""
"Nice mouthfeel. Not as flavorful.as I had hoped it would be. Nice body and head. Nitro always yields a good feel. Not as tasty and crafty as their other offerings."
""
"Disappointing."
""
""
""
"Glad I tired it, but won't purchase again."

"The look is unsatisfying, hardly any smell, tastes flat. It does taste more smooth as I drink it this glass more. I don't think I'll get this beer again."
"Not as good as the stout but the feel of it is similar if I don't feel like drinking the milk stout I go for this one."
"Another horrible FLAT ale. Couldn't finish it to give any review. How are they still in business after the reviews I've read all say the same thing? I feel I've been cheated."
"Great beer ! You've got to dump it into a glass to get any head . All their nitros are that way hence the ""pour hard"" . But overall  a very silky smooth feel and great taste . One of my favorites ."
"Not anything to write home about."
"Overall:  Like the regular Sawtooth, this Nitro’d version is a delicious, malty, slightly sweet, English-style ESB!  A malt-bomb for sure!  It’s another great beer from Colorado, and another great beer from Left Hand, which is fastley becoming one of my favorite Colorado breweries.  I just prefer the regular version of Sawtooth over the Nitro-version."
"This beer is good man."
""
"This was a bit of a letdown as the nitro milk stout is a favorite. This one has a similar texture though it poured flatter and has more of a hollowed out palate. If the ABV were a little lower it would make sense as a session beer."
"If this isn't a mistake by Left Hand Brewing, than it's shameful to produce let alone distribute this swill."
""
"This was just boring. The mouthfeel was great and it didn't taste nasty, just underwhelming and boring. Light watery slightly sweet hops, then light watered down slightly sweet malts. That's it."
""
""
""
""
"This review was generous. I know Ledt Hand is capable of better. Just not thrilled with the style overall"
""
""
""
""
"The one time I had this beer, it had been sitting in the fridge for a week or two and I thought that made it as flat as it was. Maybe it's just not that great a beer, based on its ratings; I'd try it again just to see, but if it's in the neighborhood of where I had it the first time, I'd say i'ts just an okay beer."
""
"Malt forward beer balanced by hops.  Not much of a head though."
""
""
""
""
"Looks better than it tastes but the bottles were past best by.  Taste is what turned me off, tasted like bad weak tea.  Not skunked but not sure if the taste was impaired by age.  Not a brew I'd do again."
""
""
""
"Poured aggressively from bottle into my favorite tulip.  I usually enjoy nitros but this was very flat and not too flavorful.  Decent hop aroma but uninspiring thin,  almost watery grassy taste and mouthfeel.  I enjoy the Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro very much but the Sawtooth is a miss for me...oh well."
""
"I like nitros but, this one seemed flat, tasted grassy, bought a sampler six and this was my least favorite. I was actually surprised how bad this was."
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed the brew but there are many other ESBs that I'd seek before this one."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle says to pour hard. I did and as an ESB, I got very little head and golden amber color that did not impress. Flavor up front was malt sweetness. Flavor was sort of flat, not very bitter and overall seemed to be watered down. Also felt flat on the palate and definitely lacked something, was very week...."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I thought it was an Ok example of the style, I thought this beer was going in a really good direction, but when it got to the taste it seemed to go off course and that made it a little rough around the edges.  This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, very creamy, a little velvety, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think on would be enough for me, I don't really have the urge to drink another one right now.  What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty nice and it was what i wish the taste was like, it was the highlight og this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't nearly as good as it could be.  I'm not sure I would buy this beer again, but I wouldn't turn it down and I would say it's worth trying to see where you stand with it.  All in all I was a little let down with this beer, I started to expect some good things after that nice aroma, but I was let down when I got to the taste.  This isn't my favorite Left Hand beer and it's by far not a favorite ESB.  In the end I did think the Nitro aspect was nice and I will have to try the regular version and the nitro side by side one of these days.  I appreciate the effort, but I think with a just a little bit of work this could be a pretty good beer."
"Beautiful golden brown hue, incredibly smooth; the nitro system produces a fantastic mouth feel, and superb, long-lasting, creamy head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with an orange tint. The head is creamy white but a little thin, given the nitro pour. The aroma is almost a blank slate, with just a bare hint of malt. The taste is equally bland. The body does have a nice weight and silky feel courtesy of the nitro. Given the quality of the nitro milk stout, this one is big let-down."
""
""
""
"Seemingly thick on the early palate, its finish dissolves effortlessly and allows the beer to finish semi-dry, highlighting a broad and woodsy bitterness for a smooth and delicate finish. A return of biscuit and orange keep the palate rewarded in aftertaste."

"O: Nicely done ESB. I think the nitro is a little lacking, though I tried a vigorous pour. Slightly sweet, but overall well done. Drank in Boca Raton, July 21st, 2014."

"07/31/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Nitro being the blessing that it is, this one has set a high standard to live up to with it's handsome looks. First taste is of well managed malt. Listed in the ESB category it comes up shy on the hop side...not that that is a bad thing, IMO. Amusing lacing looks like it's done by a fledgling interior decorator or some Japanese painting of Sea Foam. All in all this is a distinctive beer that minds it's P's-&-Q's. In a word smooth."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, hint of earthy malt, sweet malt, caramel malt, hint of pale malt, and a hint of biscuit. Fits the style of an extra special / strong bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and cream, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel malt, citrus hops, hint of pale malt, hint of yeast, and a hint of biscuit. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, body, and blend."

"i like that left hand has started putting these beers out on nitro, although im not sure its as good as a real nitro tap. in fact, its definitely not. while the beer looks really nice, the liquid itself is rather flat after all the little nitro bubbles come out. clear copper color, whipped cream head. the nose is a little more malty than i remember sawtooth being. in fact, its got an almost metallic vibe, but its not at all unpleasant. english ale yeast breaks down most of the sweetness, and a very clean and clear beer results, very autumnal in nature, with a hearty body and flavors of fresh grain and faint cider. i prefer the non-nitro edition and here is why. sawtooth is made by its feel, and that lively carbonation is has is missed here. the smoother but stiller nitro makes it more like a classic esb, but the regular version is more intriguing to me, keenly skirting style guidelines in favor of an attention holding session ale. this is a little more generic despite the format. still a worthwhile endeavor."
""
"Poured this Nitro into a tulip glass, with a hard pour to activate the Nitro action. Sadly this one really fell flat, literally, which is a pity since I love regular Sawtooth Ale. Carbonation was lacking, mouthfeel was watery, and the delicious smooth slightly sweet taste present in regular Sawtooth but was a week presence in this Nitro version."

"O: Nitro lends to a great appearance and mouthfeel, although potentially at the expense of smell and taste."
""

""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on the ESB style. Good nutty malt flavor with a nice touch of hops and cream from the nitro."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Added note, 4/27/14 - I had this with a fatty hotdog dish I threw together, and it was a very nice bitter bite to accompany the sweet mustard notes of the sauce I prepared. Since I like to drink my beer separately, I don't change my overall analysis, but I did want to add that this beer has decent promise as a something to have with a meal with robust, bright flavors."
""
"It's okay, but has a butterscotch twang that I'm not too fond of."
"O: A very good beer here.... well balanced and good ABV make this a pretty session worthy beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle, it produced a nice off white head and dark copper color. The head melted pretty quickly. Nose slightly sour malt. Mouthfeel was full, actually a strong point for this beer. Taste is similar to nose. Slightly sour, very mild. Ends with a bit of hop. All in all not too exciting but not bad."
""
"3.75 D: Solid beer and super drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, a smooth and decent example of of the style with a big emphasis on the improvement in feel. This nitro pour simulates a tap pretty damn well."
"O: I picked this up as well as the non-nitro version at the same time I bought both milk stouts from Left Hand. My plan was to compare both styles and see how that effects flavor etc. While the flavor here may be crisper and smoother than the original, it seems as though the lack of carbonation in this bottle detracts from the brew more than one would think. I think in the future I'll stick with the original."

"Overall it's got some interesting qualities, but I don't think the deliver system is giving this thing justice. I am not so worried about the age dating on this, but there might be a better way to do this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess the nitro consistency is the point of this beer anyway, which is as close to the real thing as you can hope for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a decent party beer, no more, no less. If someone buys a case of this - other than me, for obvious reasons (bland, ESB) - for a celebration and it's the only thing available, damn right I'll kill a few of these in a night."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very drinkable, it went fast and I wish I had another or a larger bottle at least. Simple well done flavor profile."

"Taste-Creamy mouthfeel, floral hop note, toasted malt. Finishes clean and quiet. A nice effort, but I wished for a little more flavor profile. A nitro IPA would fit the bill nicely. Hint, hint."
"Perhaps what I purchased was flawed, but with delivery of head, and retention of same, it wasn't flat. In any case, I won't bother to sample it again. Too many others out there to look into."

"So, I was very excited to try this beer last night. What a letdown... I probably should have expected it to be nothing like the original sawtooth. I really hate to say anything bad about Left Hand, but the nitro sawtooth was very underwhelming. Pretty much indistinguishable from an Old Speckled Hen. This beer need more hops!"
""
""
""
""
"Really nice balanced ale. Just enough sweetness and hops. Hands down, the best part about this beer is the body. The mouthfeel is almost velvety due to the nitro, with a low but soft carbonation and super clean finish. The hops longer for a moment, but are neither floral nor super bitter. More of a compliment than a focus point."
""
""
"Overall: I tend to like Left Hand's non-nitro versions, but this is worth seeking out if you like Sawtooth Ale. Nice creamy, smooth, and tasty beer."
