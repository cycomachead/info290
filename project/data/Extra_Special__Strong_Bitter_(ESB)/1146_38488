Taste is citrus and orange undertones, with good amount of caramel malt as it warms up followed by floral and earthy hops bitterness on the end for balance, A medium body, smooth with moderate carbonation. The finish slowly mellows out to a flavorful caramel malt, a bit of orange peel, some grains followed by some good floral earthy hops bitterness for balance and a bit of a nutty flavor as well. Overall a good, tasty and enjoyable brew.","Samp01","Sep 19, 2014"

The slight nose is sweet citrus fruit (mango and orange) and caramel over a biscuit sweetness. The body is almost medium with a smooth texture that approaches a slight slickness. Normal carbonation with little effervescence. The flavor profile is well balanced. It begins with slight citrus sweetness, progresses to caramel and biscuit sweetness and finishes with a nice mild bitterness. The finish is more smooth than crisp and leaves a nice herbal bitterness.","tillmac62","Mar 26, 2014"

Extremely tasty hop-malt balance, and easy to drink; I could knock these back all night.","TheMirrorOwl","Feb 10, 2014"

While Goose Island can blow you away with some of their more creative ales they also really do extremely well crafting great beer in the somewhat forgotten styles. Harvest Ale is perfect for the Fall season and I am almost greatly appreciative that we get a wider variety of Goose Island brews here at home. Ill buy a pack of this every single Autumn. It's one of the best ESB's ever created. No more to say. Try it","BradtheGreat7","Jan 24, 2014"

3.78,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 8/2/2013. Bit of a gusher upon opening. Pours lightly cloudy orange copper color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, toast, biscuit, floral, light pine, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, toast, biscuit, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, floral, toast, biscuit, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt and hop flavors; with a very nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good ESB style. Good balance of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Flavor is balanced and refreshing, with toasty, biscuity malts perfectly balanced with citrusy/earthy hops. Pleasant alpha acid finish. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is right for style, but it seems a bit rough on tongue. Good everyday ESB.","EagleTalon","0"

4.15,11.3,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Brewed and bottled by Goose Island Beer Co. in Baldwinsville, NY??? Okay, I guess they are doing some contract brewing in Baldwinsville, NY or AB is brewing at one of their locations to increase production. Regardless the beer in this bottle is good so far, here's some more details. Beautiful copper bronze body forms thick with a light tan head slightly off white head, fine speckled layered lacing forms on the sides of my nonic pint glass. Aroma has citric, herbal/earthy notes that smell great, along with a crisp malt heavy backbone, giving perfect balance to my first few sniffs. Striking fresh hop flavor flows freely through with each sip leaving a nice smooth level of bitterness on each palate starts citric earthy finishes with a bit of spice/mint combo held together with amber roasted specialty grains. Under 8 bucks a sixer and readily available now due to the AB distribution network. I was nervous to try this seasonal because the 12 packs brewed in NY were not matching up this summer, this however shows promise for future endeavors and specialty releases not brewed in Chicago. The Oktoberfest I get in Ohio says brewed and bottled in Chicago, IL it's stellar this year, I haven't had one brewed in Baldwinsville, NY to compare. Mouthfeel is dead on smooth even carbonation slightly slick hop oils glide across the palate, this pairs well with pizza, meat and cheese trays, steaks, and just about anything a very versatile well brewed Harvest Ale (ESB) that should be sessioned and enjoyed by all. Price point is right, quality is on par it's going to be a great stand by this fall season.","WVbeergeek","Oct 06, 2013"

A bit of pine and pineapple. An abundance of lemon and lemongrass flavors from the hops. The malt backbone is non offensive and rather light. Its quite sugary and has a slight bit of grainyness. Overall, this is decent fresh hop ale. Doesnt stick out from the rest but will make for a fine drinking brew for a nice price.","TwelveOunces","Dec 10, 2012"
3.53,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer is transparent and copper hued with a thin, tan head. The aroma brings biscuity malt, caramel, subtle alcohol and spice. The flavor is ok. Some bitterness from the hops, with a sturdy malt bill leading the way. Residual bitterness with a hint of pine. It certainly tastes English in style, but I do prefer most Brit offerings to this. Lacking the delectable character and drinkability I look for in a fairly low abv beer. Overall, this is ok, but I don't see myself having it again.","Huhzubendah","Dec 10, 2012"

Clear copper brown in color with a few trace bubbles lazily rising, more of a yellow cast around the rims. In the nose you get pretzel dough, salt and miscellaneous bread crust then honey, cocoa malts, peach pits and lemon rinds, oddly neither sweet nor grassy, like it doesn’t want to commit to a specific direction, slightly better than average staying power. Medium-bodied, its firmness creates additional palate presence. Malts, cocoa, caramel, honey yet not that sweet, the carbonation is subtle but effective, scrubs the tongue well. The lemon citrus brings out more earthiness and likely more pit aspect to the apricot, peach, apple, fig fruit. The well baked bread never a major factor, just one of many drying elements. Leaves you wishing it showed more exuberant personality, not that it’s playing it safely but you just sense it could have been more complex with some effort.","farrago","Sep 13, 2012"

Aromas of pumpkin sweetness, both rich and creamy, with some very subtle spicing to accent. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg spicing that doesn't come anywhere close to cleaning this thing up. Tangy, bitter overtones throughout, with a touch of hops in the background. This beer is getting more muddled the more I drink. Unbalanced aftertaste, as well, with a roasty, spiced, and cloyingly sweet character. Slick, slightly bitter finish, but there is a filmy sweetness that lingers behind.

Some caramel notes in there too. The taste of the beer has a moderate roasted sweetness up front that finishes bitter.

Its taste mirrors more of the piney resiney hops with a bit of citrus and more of a roasty malt presence. This beer seems a bit too carbonated to me, but overall, it just seems too light.

After a hit of nasal decongestant inhaler (thank you girlfriend for that nose remedy -- I am going to marry the hell out of you) and a few swirls of the glass, I began to smell great big aromas of caramel and oatmeal, and only a hint of hops. The taste of oatmeal is fantastic. It is like eating an oatmeal raisin cookie without the raisins. The bitterness of this beer is pretty good for a session beer, even as it seems to leave a film of malty flavor in my mouth.

Now call me crazy, I drank one of these yesterday and I tasted some fresh roasted malts, not sure how the brewery handles this, but it all came together exceptionally fresh and it was very very pleasant. I would say this is certainly an American ESB interpretation, with a strong West coast influence from the choice of hops with their citrus and pineyness. However it is quite nice and fruity tasting and almost kinda refreshing, I would say this one is highly drinkable. Mouthfeel as with almost all standard Goose offering is slightly thin, which could be intentional to increase drinkability. Overall; this is a strong offering from Goose Island.

4.25,13.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Harvest Ale is a great seasonal, though I'm not sure it's best termed an ESB. If the beer has no English hops in it then there's no reason to call it an ESB. It's clearly a pale ale with American hops and no English yeast I could recognize. The only thing is that its a bit deeper red and more carbonated than a traditional pale ale. I didn't ""take off points"" per se, but if you are looking for an ESB then you might be disappointed in this offering. Enjoy it as a good example of a middle of the road pale American ale.","vishneda","Jan 01, 2010"

Toasted biscuity malt up front. Herbal, vegetal hop bitterness comes in. Butterscotch malt sweetness (slightly buttery) fills up the middle of the palate, but the moderate hop bitterness stays (marmalade and pepper). Finish is bitterer and drying with lingering buttery toffee malt. Moderate body with a slightly mineraly feel. Not bad.","alexgash","Dec 04, 2009"

Smell is a bit weak, but definitely has some fruity hops and light malt in there. Taste is a bit more robust, a generous portion of citrus hops followed by some sweet malt. A bit thick, although a nice sipper, I could have a few of these. Nice cheap brew to have around.","LordAdmNelson","Nov 19, 2009"
4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle courtesy of jrallen34. Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Bottled on 08/13/2009 indicated on the back label. Poured a hazy amber with a frothy, 1.5 inch off-white head that eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch cap; light strands of lacing were exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals a slightly malty character as well as some light fruity esters intermixed with a mellow hops presence. Taste follows nose - malt up-front; an interplay of caramel/toffee, some light acidity and bitterness in the middle, ending with a slightly resinous hops character. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a sparkling effervescence. I like this beer very much for the style. I have never been a huge fan of ESBs, but I found this brew to be interesting, flavorful and sessionable. I've yet to be disappointed by a GI beer.","Jwale73","Nov 17, 2009"
3.95,5.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Served in a pint glass with about a 1/2"" of frothy white head. Orange to light brown in color. To me, it looks the color of autumn. Opens with a heavy caramel malt that lingers for a bit before the hops kick in. Not much in the way of bitterness - light to moderate, but the hops definitely take a more predominant spotlight in this beer than I would have expected. On the heavier side of medium with appropriate carbonation level. Overall, a good autumn beer, full of flavor and hops, though I did find the malt sweetness to be a bit distracting and, while I've had this beer on many occasions, I can never seem to drink two in a row.","Florida9","Nov 14, 2009"

It's nothing spectacular in the malt department (pale and a low lovibond crystal), but the hops are a plenty and really make this beer. The mouthfeel is fine.

Bitter but finishes easily. Kind of has that familiar Goose Island taste (at least of the Honkers Ale). Mouthfeel may be a bit thin but it could just be the style, I'm not to sure on these. A lower ABV this one is drinkable. Like I said it reminds me of the Honkers Ale which I love so this one I could do all night.

There is almost a bit of a leafy hop flavour and a nice fruit taste to the beer and very little bitterness. The leafy/aroma hops is absolutely beautiful, but the beer really lacks in bitterness (hence the low taste rating).

Gosh - all those descriptors don't make it sound like I liked this beer all that much; but I assure you, it was quite to the contrary.

Aromas are faint, but take on deep amber malt / toasted malt character with nuttiness and earthy (English) hop scents. The flavors are also mellow and bring out the same toasted malts found in the nose, along with stronger hop rates, fruityness, and a lightly pungent peat-ey note.

3.68,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D - Some earthiness in the flavor fits the harvest name but I was expecting a wet hopped beer. Highly drinkable but I might tire of this one easily.","brewcrew76","Sep 26, 2007"
3.9,4.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a tawny amber hue with copper highlights and decent clarity. Above average retention leaves rings of lace. Toasted and fruity nose, with hints of nut, buscuit and leafy english hops. Light caramel sweetness upfront, followed by a toasted pale malt taste and suspect Marris Otter flavor. Some buscuit notes and faint dextrins further enrich the malt profile, with a mellow english ale ester in the background. The aftertaste shows a flash of fresh tobacco leaf and herbal English hop flavor; a solid bitterness keeps the grain-centric character of this beer in check without pushing the malt out of the spotlight. Medium-light in body with a gentle and light carbonation, the mouthfeel relies heavily on increasing grainy notes and drying hops to provide balance- but manages to do so very effectively. Some faint diacetyl buttery taste slowly becomes evident near the finish, but the bitterness and building tannic grain taste dries the palate enough to fend off any slickness. Finishes mostly clean with soft diacetyl and fruity Ringwood yeast becoming more pronounced but thoroughly covered up by the hop oil and now vaugely astringent grain character. I had expected this to be a slightly altered version of the Goose Island Flagship, but in fact is a unique and satisfying entitiy unto itself.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 25, 2007"
3.63,-2.7,4.5,4,3,4,4,"D- Could be that earthy aspect to the flavor, but for some reason I picture this being a great beer to enjoy when I'm workin' the fields. Not all that impressive, but better the other Goose Island offerings I have had so far.","david131","Sep 23, 2007"
4.67,25.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"great head retention that holds to keep carbonation in. Copper color very nice. Smell floral scent cascade dry hopping. Taste: Nearly tastes like autumn if that makes sense? WHich is what I look for in a seasonal. Don't taste as much hop bitterness as I smell I taste more malt tones. Most drinkable ESB i have tasted. Great session beer for the College Football season.","gavinstoub","Sep 23, 2007"

4.3,15.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle. This one pours a deep golden color with a small but full head that falls to a solid coating over top. Clarity is fantastic and there is a light carbonation in the brew. The aroma is a nice malt and hop balance. I get very solid notes of toasted grain with mild breadyness. The hop comes through as a mild earthyness and a moderate citrusy orange as well. I really like the malt character in this one. The flavor is dominated by toasty, light grainyness and a solid earthy hop that pulls the two malt components together very well. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It keeps the beer from flowing from my glass too quickly, but also keeps it very approachable. I find this one to be incredibly drinkable. The flavors are nice and prevalent without being too much. It has a fairly low ABV keeping it nice and drinkable. I think this one is a winner.","kmpitz2","Sep 17, 2007"
4.37,17.2,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Overall a very nice brew. If it would have been title 'Oktoberfest', I might frown a bit due to the hoppy profile. This is a perfect beer to help welcome the colder months to soon follow. It's got a little bit of summer charm with a somewhat bolder underbelly. It really works well with my palate and mood right now. Great 'simple' beer with a couple tricks up its sleeve. Bravo!","malty","Sep 17, 2007"
3.63,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours an amber orange with a nice sized white head. The head leaves some decent lacing. Retention is decent as well. Aroma is of pine, citrus, sweet bready malt, and a touch of bubble gum. Taste hoppy up front. The hops are piney, fruity, and spicey. Sweet malt is slightly present in the back. Not really as well balanced as the style generally is, but an easy drinker and a decent brew, though I wouldnt get it if I were looking for a classic example of the style.","hckyfn9999","Sep 15, 2007"

3.53,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"served on-tap, this was a clear deep copper with a creamy tan head that quickly diminished to a nice collar. simple but appealing nose of bready caramel and piney hops. taste strikes a nice balance between the light to moderate sweet malts and matching bitterness. this is a nice, sessionable brew.","MrMcGibblets","Sep 13, 2007"
3.86,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Goose Island is very underrated, in my opinion. The Harvest ale being no exception. It pours a beautiful red amber/orangish color. Great head and nice lacing down the glass. Sweet malts kick in on the nose followed by perfect balance and a bit of hoppy goodness. A very clean, smooth, brew and highly sessionable. I enjoyed this one and it will be in my fridge more often.","bigdeuce","Sep 12, 2007"
3.6,-3.5,4,4,3.5,2,4,"I really enjoyed this beer and found it pleasantly surprising. It had a really pleasant citrus-hop aroma, and a light maltiness balanced with a lot of very crisp and pleasant lemon-y hop. Color was a nice amber, with a lot of head. I found the mouthfeel to be just a bit thin and watery, but I would still call this one a winner. I would definitely recommend giving this beer a try.","BeerBelcher","Beers"

4.02,7.8,4,4.5,4,3,4,"A good brew but could be better with just a little bit better carbonation. Therefore I don't consider this a good session beer. Just feels a tad heavy.","morimech","Sep 10, 2007"
3.98,6.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Finally found the new fall seasonal from Goose Island. The brew poured a nice clean red with a fluffy thick cap. Decent lacing is left on the glass. Smell is a fruity resin coated hops, a bit of bready malt tempers the aroma. Very nice. Taste has a nice fruity hop start, grapefruit mostly. The piney hops are also very present. Again the over all feel has the malt balancing it out. Easily one of the best tasting G.I. brews I've had. Mouthfeel is a crisp and clean. I found this offering extremely drinkable and enjoyable.","crayphish","Sep 08, 2007"
4.03,8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D: Solid offering, pretty complex with well balanced flavors even though its a bit hoppy initally, good and solid seasonal from Goose Island.","bluemoonswoon","Sep 05, 2007"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"HeatherAnn and I also drank this, on draft, at the GI sponsored ""Hideout Block Party"" last night (9/07/07). We noticed that the draft version of this that they were serving was even hoppier! We could've sworn that they were pouring their IPA until it warmed slightly and the maltiness came about. Excellent!","GbVDave","Sep 04, 2007"
4.17,11.8,3.5,4,4,4,5,"Mouthfeel is full and in fact borders on creamy which is unusual for an ale not on nitro. I absolutely think this is the most drinkable GI beer I've had in ages and am thrilled that it has replaced the steady but unspectacular Oktoberfest in their bottled line-up.","malcontent","Sep 03, 2007"
3.78,1.3,4,3.5,4,3,4,"I think this is more a of an American Red, but I am reviewing it under the correct spelling. It is a nice deep amber copper color, with an off white head. It is already gone as I look back at the glass but did leave some lace. Aromas of American citrus hops start of the aromas. However I am noticing a sort of phenolic, chemical cleanser smell in there too. Bread like character notes are in the background with caramel and toast. The mouth feel is really light. Makes it very easy to drink. a nice fall afternoon beer, that is very session-able.","quasimoto","Beers"
4.63,24.1,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"D- perfectly balanced with great hop flavor that isn't overwhelming. totally a session beer. pair it with goose island honkers ale and switch on and off between the two with their relatively low ABV you can have a great night with great beer without getting too hammered.","hustlesworth","0"
