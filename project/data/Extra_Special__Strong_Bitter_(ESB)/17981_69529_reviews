"Served via nitro pour on-tap"

"This ESB is fine looking but otherwise unexceptional, Body is smooth but too thin."

"Extremely colorful beer and has full flavor."

"Had nitro tapped.  A good ESB and quite smooth compared to others.  Hazy amber color with a think head, most likely due to the nitro tapping.  Very full bodied and surprisingly not so bitter.  A higher ABV is always appreciated but the smoothness from this ESB made it very drinkable.  Perhaps the best quality of this beer is the execution of the style.  Overall, a refreshing change from run of the mill ESBs."
"Had it on nitro at the brewery. Fresh & smooth; an extra tasty, extra special bitter."

"Much like fillers esb, with slightly richer caramel tones. Great head and lightly carbonated like all good English rand should be.."
"Next to no flavor or smell for me"
""
"Has an awesome look to and super smooth flavor with great drinkability. The nitro really does this beer good, as I don't think it would be as good without it. Would get this again if I saw it"

"Had on draft (nitro) at the brewery. Nice looking nitro head. Nice rich color. Very little smell, maybe a bit musty. Great creamy nitro mouthfeel, but very little taste. Admittedly, this is not my favorite style, so my rating is really just for my personal remembrance of what I thought of the beer. I am sure this is a good example of the style, or at least better than my rating suggests."

"On nitro at the brewery. Pours dark copper with a creamy white head. Light malt and spice aroma, smooth with low carbonation. Malty mostly with ever so slight hops, lingering malt flavor and a clean finish. Not much going on here, and I am not really a fan. Very boring and not much flavor. I feel like the nitro takes away from a beer like this, making it more bland than it otherwise would be."

"On nitro, at Pingleheads. Dark coloured, tasty stuff. The hops, and of course the caramel and chocolate malts survived fine on nitro. A little creamy. Fun stuff that still hit the spot after a long day and night and day of drinking beer. I could drink this for two days."

"I don't usually like ESBs, so it took Al's recommendation for me to order this. Surprisingly balanced as the malted barley meets earthy yeast and tangy fruit. Creamy as hell, thanks to the nitro. I enjoyed this, but gimme my pour of Huna back!"

"I'm not a big fan of English Style Bitters, but this was a great beer. As one poster commented and I agree- It's a very well balanced beer. My general complaint with ESBs, are they tend to be on the bland side, and lacking in flavour. No worries here- This beer delivers some very, very intense flavors. Starts with a nice roasted malt flavor/mouth-feel, and finishes with a nice, very bitter, hop bite. I highly recommend this beer and I will look for it again. It is available only on tap."
"O: This is a very flavorful ESB that is also very easy to drink."

"Overall, this exceeded expectations. I was quite pleased with this brew."

"O-the best esb I have had so far. Grant it Im not the biggest fan of the style but this is a very enjoyable beer. Flavorful and an easy drinker. Highly recommended."
""
"Overall an interesting and easy drinking beer."
"O- Usually CC's session beers are unimpressive to me, but minaret hits the mark. Probably the best ESB I've ever had"

"Nice ESB, but not my favorite CC offering. Admittedly, ESB isn't my favorite style. Not bad."
"Pours a dark caramel brown color with a one finger head into my ccb snifter. Caramel malts with a great balance of bitter hops on the nose and the taste is intensified. This is a well crafted easy drinking session able beer. I could drink this all day!"
"O â€“ Nice well balanced brew here that is pretty damn drinkable. Enjoyed this one. Well worth a try."
"Very nice beer, I'm pretty sure this was my first ESB, a nice style I will be exploring a little more."
"O: solid beer, I'm impressed to find a gem like this in the heart of Florida. Buy it if you find it and you like ESBs."
"I had this at the Kickbacks Cigar City/St Somewhere dinner. I'm reviewing this by memory on this I had this at the Kickbacks Cigar City/St Somewhere dinner. I have had most of CC's regular beers but I have not tried this yet. toasty flavors as style suggests with some nice american citrus hop flavors. worth trying but not there best. want to try again."
"Overall: Good beer overall. One of the better ESBs I've had (while I haven't had a ton, I know this one is good). Worth trying."
"Pours a lovely dark copper with a foamy white head. Nice aromas of roasted caramel malt and bitter orange peel hops. Taste follows the nose nicely, lots of toasted malt, caramel, and bitter citrus hops that linger on the palate for some time. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy, with a medium body and pleasant carbonation. Overall a very nice Bitter, and exceptionally drinkable."
"0 - was very pleased like how the bitterness did not ruin the fruitiness of the beer"
"Overall: Decent example of a true English ESB. Dryness is too much however."
"O: this is the first 'weak' beer I've tried from Cigar City. It's not bad, but compared to the other offerings, it's lacking some character. Unless you are fan of the style, pass this one out and try their other choices."
"D - Not bad, a bit too dry for my taste and the bitterness is slightly soapy. Still a much more authentic bitter than one usually finds at an American brewery."
"Warming with a dry finish. Medium-full bodied with a medium-light effervescence. Some oak notes in the aftertaste are nicely cleansing without removing all remnants of flavor. A decently balanced, flavorful brew that holds fairly true to my recollection of the style. Not overly hoppy but it is the lead guitar in the band."
"O: Sure, the style of this one doesn't exactly appeal to the masses, but it was still tasty."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Nice, amber color with a moderate head and retention, mild lacing. Aroma amazingly reminds me of Topps brand bubble gum like the kind that was in baseball card packs from 25 years ago. Maybe even the specific smell of the gum combining with the cardboard from the cards. Talk about memory lane. Taste is mildly bitter, no alcohol noted, mild sweetness. Nice balance and very pleasant to drink."
" Nice light hop profile was highlighted by hints of grapefruit and fresh grass. As it warmed it got tremendously more balanced, with a light bready malt character coming through and a light herbal like quality to it. Smooth flavor here, though the hops did seem a touch off to me. Light, with a grapefruit, peach, lemon like tartness coming through in the front and an almost green tea leave like flavor in the mid palate. Intresting mix of flavors here, some biscuit and a touch of light grain coming through now. Smooth, mellow, and consistent carbonation never failed and allowd this very sessionable lager to really be a smooth and easy drinker."
"Overall this is a fine ESB and another of the recent, approachable ""normal"" beers from Cigar City. Check it out."
"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it poured a light copper-auburn color with no head. Slight smokey and malt smells, like caramel. The flavor is a roasted caramel, with some slightly bitter hopping. It almost has some coffee notes, as well. Sour and bitter aftertaste, with syrupy qualities. The finish is a bit dry and slick at the same time. Tasty."
"On-tap at the CCB tasting room. Copper colored, one finger thick white head with decent retention. Smell: toffee, earthy, mild pine. Taste: toasted grain, caramel, lightly bready, earth + pine, mild citrus. Nice bitterness, slightly mineral feel. Pretty good ESB."
"O: I think could've better. The metal characteristics in the middle are the beer's downfall. It had the potential to be good, just fell short. Skal."
