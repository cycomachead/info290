Either Southern Tier has changed the recipe for this beer and amped up the malt presence while dialing down the hops, which I doubt, or my palate has really grown over the past year to be much more tolerant of hops, as I found this yearâ€™s edition to be really, really tasty!","Jeffreysan","Jan 22, 2015"

Nice sweet malt balance to the hop flavorings.  Hops lean towards pine. Slight bitter finish but really fairly subtle and ok by my preference.  Very high ABV for an ESP variety beer but this works just fine.  Definitely would revisit if presented opportunity.","bubseymour","Oct 04, 2014"

Very nice nose of blended hops (citric, tropical and a touch of dank pine) over a light biscuit.  Light medium body with a smooth texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a nice effervescent finish.  Very nice balanced flavor profile that is complex.  It begins with a rush of hop flavor - the citric and tropicals lead then flow into a dank note that is much more prevalent than suggested in the nose. The middle is a mild bitterness over biscuit, with a touch of caramel, light sweetness.  The finish somewhat dry, but leaves you with the classic English ESB flavors and bitterness over a fading light biscuit.  The 6.7% alcohol is completely hidden in this outstanding ESB.","tillmac62","Sep 18, 2014"

I didn't think the taste was all that bitter for an ESB; this was actually very easy to drink. Very well balanced. In addition to the citrus-y taste, I also detected a sweet caramel undertone.

It is quite refreshing which would make it a great beer for a warm summer night.

Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with excellent retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, grass, and light herbal spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, pine, floral, grass, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, pine, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor complexity and balance; with a great malt/hop bitterness balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent ESB! Great malt/hop flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink for the ABV level. Definitely one of the best ESBs I have had. Highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 07, 2012"

Tastes of lemon, orange, a bit of corriander, caramel, cardamom, allspice, wheat, and some earthen hops. Theres a strange, almost gritty bitterness to it that resembles unintegrated spices more than alpha acids. Mouthfeel is relatively crisp and finishes clean save for some lingering flavors (mostly the cardamom). Overall, a decent beer that's refreshing enough.

The malt and yeast anchor the beer with some very gentle pear and pine returns in the hop flavor as it warms.

The nose features orange peel, ginger root, scones and baked bread, hoppy in an herbaceous way, not much sweetness here, black tea leaves, more metallic than earthy. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation is average at best, while clean thereâ€™s little life and spring to its step. Malty with cocoa, coffee bean, toffee accents, the orange to lemon citrus noticeable, more pine here as well as peach, apricot, cherry fruit. About half and half grains versus full-on bread, lacks honey or bread glaze. Finishes with an increase in florality and blanched nuttiness, that metallic edge about as close to bitter as it gets.

Feel is a light crisp signature with a smooth carbonation and medium weight. A nice fall beer with wonderful drinkability and character.","scootny","Oct 30, 2011"

Agitating the brew kicks up a nice, creamy head and aromas of piney, floral and citrusy hops. Great malt backbone lends a toasty, biscuity flavor. Becomes a little boozey as it warms. ABV definitely detectable here. The hop profile follows through to the palate where piney and resiny flavors are present. Moderate bitterness in a finish that lingers for a good amount of time. Medium-full bodied; chewy for this style of beer. Carbonation is low and leaves the brew slick and syrupy. Drank more like a well-hoped pale ale rather than a bitter.

I really liked this beer. Great mouthfeel and a subtle complex flavor profile. The malt is there but the hops is the lingering taste, still does not dominate, like the balance and the body of this beer. I would agree, hoppy enought to satisfy and stand up to spicy(mexican) but with a deep enough body to speak of fall.

The taste is similar in character, but not as strong as the aroma. There is also a hint of orange in the finish. Bitterness is well integrated.

Citrus up front followed by a slightly sweet mango note and a lingering bitterness fused with pine. Little to no alcohol presence.

Interestingly it has a somewhat American hop aroma, but the hops turn a bit more musty and British in the flavor. The malt character is well done as well; there is a huge note of toasted malt with just the right amount of sweetness to keep it form becoming burnt tasting and cloying in the finish as it has a tendency to do in some drier beers.

Lots of pine, grapefruit and grass with just a touch of bread dough. Taste is quite like the nose, with lots of bitterness from the hops to nicely compliment the biscuity malt. Fruitier than most ESB's with a hint of tea also. Nice dry finish and a mouthfeel that reminds me of a cask ale. A very unique and drinkable ESB.","beerdrifter","Dec 01, 2009"

Nose is sweet tangerine, mango, peach, tropical fruit marmalade. The big smell is impressive - wow! Taste is citrus rind with big hoppy first impressions, bold yet very drinkable. This tastes like a stone fruit orchard passed through it, with a dash of spice. Mouthfeel is sharp, earthy malty edges, bitter aftertaste is dry. Very pleasant interesting presentation but again there's a spicy backdrop I'm getting that I can't quite put my finger on, not quite nutmeg or cinammon but moving in that direction. Another fine brew from Southern Tier, you really can't go wrong with this brewery.","ThatWineGuy","Nov 25, 2009"
4.12,7.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Picked up as a single in WI. Pours a pale, clear golden color with two inches of white head that had good retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. I have noticed that most of these harvest ales are very pale and this one is no exception. Nice hoppy aroma of pine, grass, and citrus. A touch of graininess as well. The flavor is likewise hopcentric. Bitterness is a bit high for an ESB, I would put it at APA levels. There is a bit of bready malt that helps balance the pine and citrus flavors. Nice smooth body and carbonation. Nicely compliments the flavors in this beer. I would consider this one of my favorites when it comes to these harvest ales. Slightly more balanced and drinkable.","morimech","Beers"

It has a nice mouthfeel if you like the bitterness that is associated with ESB's. Overall an average beer, probably something I wouldn't get again but it was nice to have an opportunity to drink it.

Bright rich golden color, very clear, with a scattering of lazy bubbles rising. The aroma is a bit mild, fresh hops and a light orangey citrus, no real malt character coming through. The taste hits me with tangerine hops, lightly sweet, kinda reminds me of those little orange bubble gums that came in those mini juice cartons. Good sturdy bitterness to balance out the sweetness. The alcohol is actually a little noticeable, which isn't the best quality in a smaller session beer... Finishes with a good juicy bitterness and a faintly grainy toastiness.

4.49,16.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Poured this one into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Comes out a very pale yellow gold color with a slight haze to it. I was actually really dissapointed on first glance till I took a 2nd look at it. There was a really thick frothy head to it with lots of different sized bubbles, almost a creamy frothy look. A good chunk of the froth goes away about a fourth of the way through the drink and a ring stays on the edges with a skim of froth across the surface. You get a little bit of lacing that sticks in small patches all over the glass. You can also see in the haze what looks like citrus zest floating around all over. The smell is great. Hops dominate the smell here. Primarily citrus hops smell, dry hopped, much like the famous ""hazed and infused"" by Boulder. The taste is also phenomenal. Still pleasantly hoppy with again primary citrus hops. Likely some pine hops but I'm thinking mostly citrus dry hops. The malts are clearly present, but the taste is dominated by the hops. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expected, it strikes me more like an IPA than an ESB, it has some bitter bite to it from the hops, but all in all pretty darn good. This one extremely drinkable beer, willing to go with flawless for drinkablity. Very little to pick on about this beer, maybe it could have been a little maltier and heavier but overall it's a pretty well thought out brew. This could easily be a year round beer. I like Southern Tier going hoppy for their fall seasonal, good idea on their part.","AndyAvalanche","Oct 30, 2009"

A light golden color that surprisingly sits a bit heavy in mouthfeel. The floral hops create an amazing smell which complements this brews extraordinary taste.

This strikes me as an APA or something of that ilk. The beer is crystal clear, golden colored, with a thin 1-finger head that laces onto the glass. The aroma is all amarillo hops, at least as far as I can tell. Based on smell alone I don't think I could distinguish this from Gumballhead (which is not a bad thing). I'm getting lots of citrus like grapefruit, orange, and maybe some non-citrus mango. The taste is nearly equal to the smell, and again it reminds me a lot of Gumballhead. Lots of sweetness from the hops and abundant malt based on mouthfeel, slightly bitter aftertaste which seems to come from the hops again. The body is on the thicker side for such a light looking and smelling beer. This is a big winner from Southern Tier, definitely worth a repeat.","TurdFurgison","Aug 13, 2009"

Plenty of citrus/pine hops and stone fruits in the aroma. Same goes for the flavor, with earthy hops dominating. Malts give it balance and there is a touch of banana. With a medium body and oily mouthfeel, this is a great way to ease into fall as this one reminded me of my favorite summer APA's. I'm always glad to see this one on the shelves.

Contains some graininess and sweet malt sensations that are balanced for a pleasant drinking experience as it passes the tongue and contains a grat, prickly dry backbite.

I definitely like the color for this style, a lot more Pilsnerlike but with a slightly unique touch of amber too it. Smells hoppy like a west coast IPA with good balance. The taste is rich and hoppy but well balanced by the malt. Grassy hops that finish very clean. I'm usually not a huge fan of overly bitter beers, but this is so clean and full of flavor. A little watery towards the finish, I'd like some more malt there to really get the full experience. Mouthfeel is a perfect balance of carbonation on a medium body.

Just o be overtaken by the herbal and orange hoppy finish. The start is hoppy, then mixes a little with the malt bill. Then finishes hoppy again. The hops are a little too bright, almost metallic tasting. But still a nice Amrican version of an ESB.","scruffwhor","Sep 02, 2008"

Very hop-forward taste, but it isn't quite as explosive as the nose would suggest, and that's a good thing. Slight piney taste, and all very expertly balanced with the sweet malt. Medium-bodied, slightly creamy, and a just-right amount of lingering hop bitterness. 5.20 ABV?!! Fantastic drinkability here. I'm picking up a case of this, without a doubt.

A huge hop pungency hits at the onset of the taste followed by a very smooth malt sweetness across the middle. The hops finish on the tail end with the bitterness.

A stong pine taste dominated the hop flavor profile, with fruity hints. The malt presence was stong with a slight nutty taste.

4.17,8.6,3.5,4,4.5,3,4.5,"Had this at Macgregor's in Canadaigua,poured a deep gold with moderate head that didnt stay around to quickly aromas of pine and some citruisy (mainly lemon) notes as well.Taste up front was very piney and resiny but as I drank more the biscuity malt backbone showed itself more really balancing this one out lightly sweet just enough to tame the hops a little.Seemed a tad thin at first not sure if its just me that picked that up,anyways a very good beer from Southern Tier.","oberon","Jun 10, 2004"
4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 3/4"" off-white head, which laces quite well. A cloudy (poured in the whole thing) slightly orangey amber brew, with a reasonably balanced aroma tending toward the hops side just a tad. Taste has a good malt base, and plenty of hops bitterness, although not very delicate in that aspect. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, and could improve if the bitterness was a bit more artistic and not as much head-on bitter. An enjoyable brew, for sure.","ppoitras","Feb 23, 2004"

4.42,15.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Not as punishing as it sounds, though it is quite bitter, this beer settles in surprisingly well after the first pint. The worst part of this beer was knowing I had to go home to a world without it. I'd love to sniff and chew this prim rose again. A bountiful harvest of hops balanced by a deft show of malt. Well-done!","nomad","Dec 07, 2003"
3.85,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a large fluffy eggshell colored head. Smells strongly of hops. Literally busting out of the glass with them. Not suprisingly, it is a hop dominated pale ale, and a darn good one. Just a small hint of pale malt with an immediate assault of (cascade?) hop. Finishes very piney and dry. Moderate in body and high in drinkability.","yankeeheel","Nov 18, 2003"
4.57,19,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a clear light amber, with a big fluffy white head that mostly lasts, leaved great lace on the glass. Aroma is biscuity malts, with lots of fresh floral and pine from the abundant hops. Flavor starts with some good biscuit and caramel maltiness, ends with a huge fresh tasting hoppy goodness. Medium-full bodied, extremely good stuff. Thanks to jah noth for this fine ale.","goz","Nov 13, 2003"
4.42,15.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a lucious autumn yellow like a slowly changing oak leaf and had a nice thick white head that laced up as the beer slowly moved down the glass. The smell had thick resinous pine cone hoppiness abounding. This was a strong smelling pale ale and for a second thought they may have screwed up my order and poured me a Southern Tier IPA. But upon taste bud inspection I quickly learned this was not the case. The first 1/3 of the glass was still all hops, but as I drank further some serious malts began to show up first in the finish and then throughout a sip. This was great biscuity malts that held their own against the judicious hops, but not overpowering in any way. This was a perfect warming beer for that nip in the air.","GreatPondBrewer","Oct 20, 2003"
4.6,19.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Wow, another godsend from NY, this beer is just as tasty and possibly more balanced as their IPA. These guys are doing some things right I am by far more impressed with their beers than anything out of the Matt Brewing Co. (Saranac). Appearance: Copper orange body nice white head with evenly disributed lacing, perfect. Aroma: Nice full pine cone and citrus scented hops plentiful hop aroma, with a lucious malt backbone. Taste: Well balanced with an overall excellent snappy hop bite to it, awesome caramel tinged malts very very good. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied smooth carbonation no complaints. Drinkability: A go to for myself hits my beer soul just right, so easy drinking and flavorful at the same time ideal session brew in my eyes.","WVbeergeek","Oct 18, 2003"
4.65,21.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"It poured golden orange, had a nice off white head that slowly faded away. The smell is great, big juicy hops. The taste is just frickin awesome. Its still got the hoppyness to it, but instead of taking your tongue and beating the hell out of it, it rubs your tongue until you're one happy camper. TRY THIS BEER! Yum, yum, yum, happy, happy, happy. Lot's of tasty hops, yet well balanced, just damn tasty. I haven't tried enough fall seasonals to tell you its the best out there, but this one single beer is the most impressive beer I've had in recent memory. Maybe its because I wasn't expecting much, but I am totally blown away. Time to drink the rest, woohoo!!!","HappyHourHero","Beers"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Sampled on tap at MacGregor's 18 Oct 2003. Two Imperial pints on special for $2.25ea. Hell yeah! Another fine offering from Southern Tier. Their fall seasonal is an immediate classic brew in a class all it's own. Clear copper, steady off-white head. A tad lighter than the ST IPA. A brew that begs to be drunk...with an irresistable drinkability. A perfect combination of solid malt and precise hop balance combining Cascade and Styrian Goldings. That combo lends an awesome hop profile thats blends classic oily/piney Goldings with citrus/fruity Cascade. A sought after fall seasonal worth its weight.","John","0"
