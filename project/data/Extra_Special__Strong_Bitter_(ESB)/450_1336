A bit out of balance for the style.  Toasted, nutty, with a hint of hazelnuts on the front with an explosion of citrusy hops on the back.  Very sessionable  beer an especially nice in the fall.

Has a good cap of creamy off-white head that just sits there throughout and provides a lot of sticky lacing. The aroma is dark bread malt and dark fruit sweetness. The taste starts with the malt sweetness and transitions into the nice hops bitterness. There's a great weight to the body and a silky mouthfeel. This is a great ESB.","delta490","May 01, 2014"

Not as malty sweet as it might be, or rather more bitter than it might be, but that may be the result of the American influence. I would buy this again next time I'm in the Philadelphia area, since although it is highly a regarded brewery in the eastern PA/NJ area, it is not widely distributed.","scotorum","Oct 25, 2013"

I have had this on tap and it was a different experience. A much better one. The corn aroma and the Band_Aid flavours really put me off as well as it was a bit too bitter for my taste and, I feel, the style if indeed it is an Extra Special/Strong Ale. I will still give it a mid to high 3's out of five. It's not crap, but it's just not for me.","WissBrauSean","Apr 15, 2013"

Rising bubbles with a off white dense head that stuck around. Smell is on the malty side with caramel and some faint pale malt. This fresh version brings out nice earthy hoppy appeal with some citrus. I've never had this as fresh before and it shows. Taste hits the spot, refreshing with a mix of malt a apparent English yeast strain, some nutty appeal and some earthy hops towards the end. It all melds nicely leaving me sipping more. Feel is mediumish with some bright bubbles felt on the tounge. After all the hubbub, the aftertaste is earthy and fresh and nice. I was pleasantly surprised in this one. A beer I always thought was sub par actually has class, it all depends on the serving type and freshness. Bottles of this would be a no go for me, as they degrade quickly.","BARFLYB","Mar 19, 2012"

The aroma is fruity without being overly sweet, with a combination of dried strawberries, toffee, and caramel. The flavor is much more balanced if not a little hop-heavy, with characteristics of pine and earth being contrasted by malty notes of burnt caramel, toffee, and some berry sweetness. The beer has a nice medium body that stands up against the blend of flavors, but the fine, prickly carbonation (at least in this bottle) detracts somewhat. Overall, though, this one is a satisfying, hop-forward bitter that drinks like a light barleywine.","devilben02","Jun 15, 2011"

3.8,2.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Yards Extra Special Ale, is the original beer that Yards made in 1994, so it has a special significance to Philadelphia and the drinkers that call the city of Brotherly Love home. It was one of the instrumental beers that kicked off the craft beer movement here. This is a classic beer. It has a deep reddish-amber color with a long-lasting film of white foam that sticks around. The beer smells like rich caramelized malt with a earthy woody hop aroma. There is a hint of browned apple skins and lightly toasted bread. The beer tastes malty with a graininess in the front with a slightly molassess sweetness, hints of apple cider, bruised pears and then finishes a little sticky with residual sweetness and a nice herbal hop bitterness. This beer is nice and soft and with a medium-full body. I feel like there are a few defects compared to the bet ESB examples. First, the fruit quality of this beer is a bit too subdued me, and tastes slightly oxidized. The beer is probably also a little too bitter, and the bitterness is too harsh and lingers on your tongue too long, leaving weird, almost metallic aftertaste. This is a solid beer, but I can only imagine drinking this after having only light american lagers to drink for decades and then trying this!","Soonami","Dec 26, 2010"

Taste of big, toasted and sweet malts intermingled with hops that are initially earthy and then linger like orange zest on the finish. Very interesting.

It appears a somewhat clear amber color that has some noticeable small particles stuck in suspension keeping it from being totally clear. Presents 2 fingers of slightly tanned fluffy head with fair retension that leaves a sticky about of lace clinging to the glassware in patches. Aroma is quite malty, grainy and has a little bit of mineral character to it before the hops come into play. Taste is slightly bitter upfront with a nice malt presence and again some mineral flavors come into play along with the flavors of the hops. This beer leaves a lingering hop flavor in your mouth without having much bitterness. Hops are somewhat spicy and herbal which exaggerates the mineral flavor in this beer. Light feel with moderate amount of carbonation. Nothing overly exciting about this beer but nothing to complain about either.

The taste: starts out with the smooth round fruit up front, accented by a very slight hint of roasted malts that cuts through it. The finish is crisp with a firm hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is pleasant, with medium carbonation that turns a bit creamy in the mouth. Drinkability is pretty good for this beer, could easily have a few, though there are plenty of other session beers I'd go to before this. Well worth trying though.","Finn","Jan 20, 2009"

Some light honeysuckel and brown sugar notes followed by a bittering hop flavor, typical of an ESB. The feel is fairly light with very fizzy carbonation. Has a very airy feel to it.

Nice smooth taste dominated by the malt, again nothing really jumps out. Very smooth very drinkable beer with good mouthfeel. All in all this is a solid ale. However, nothing dominates or emphasizing any aspect of the beer. I'm guessing Yards designed this ale to be their standard gateway ale.

No lace present on the glass, although there was a decent film left on top for a little while. Smell was a little light, but what was there was not too bad. Breads and grains predominated, as it warmed a slight caramel sweetness started to come out, as well as some hints of spices, maybe a little cinnamon, overall not bad. First impression of the taste was a bit slick,oily, and somewhat watery and thin. Aside from that which would be more of a mouthfeel observation, there is a decently bitter hoppiness to be found here, albeit a bit muted. Bread flavors as well come into the fold, and it did leave a slightly lingering aftertaste which was nice. Again though the feel fell a bit flat, with no real carbonation, and the slick feeling, was a bit of a let down.

He said that he had tried producing real English-style session ales (at 3.5% ABV or so) but there just isn't a market for them in the US.

Then soapy-leafy-earthy hops come in almost immediately followed by a wonderful biscuity malt middle and slightly mineral finish. Smooth mouthfeel, moderately prickly carbonation and medium body. All around, a great beer experience that warranted a second and third round. I ordered this expecting something enjoyable but middle-of-the-road all the same, but it turned out to be a real knockout.

4.35,17.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Yards ESA shines on draft, and a fresh cask or keg can can deliver a marvelous pint that draws you back again and again! This dark amber/copper ale reveals slightly-hazy orange highlights when held to the light, and a creamy dollop of short but long-lasting off-white froth atop. Bright, grassy, leafy, and floral hops greet you in the nose along with the signature Yards fruit and mineral yeastiness and wafts of hop-laced, caramel-accented malt. It's smooth across the palate with a medium body and a delicately zesty, gently restrained carbonation. Fruitiness and malt combine upfront in the flavor before it becomes a bit more complex as the leafy/grassy/floral hop flavors and a solid bitterness arrive to dry things out. It's not overly complex, but this is not a one-sided beer by any means, and that leads to a great drinkability. When it's on, it's on! And it's always worth the price of admission to see if you've found your pint for the night!

After I learned it was an ESB and not an ale or amber, I said, "Aaah!" The aroma is strong in yeast and slightly old, blackened bananas. The yeast follows through into the tongue of the beer, and is quickly replaced by a wood varnish flavor. The hops are quite pleasantly bitter and they hang around the back of the mouth well after I was finished. Kind of like sucking on orange peels.

Medium to heavy body, a solid ESB, but nothing too exciting bringing me back for more.","donnebaby","Oct 05, 2004"
3.85,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,3,"Pours orange amber with some haziness and a few floaties. Foamy tan head that leaves some nice lace. Nose is of apples, bubblegum, and malt, that Yards house character that sometimes gets out of control. Slight (this time) tartness dulls the sweet malt. Moderate British malt flavor through and through, a little bready, and spicy hops on the finish. There are slight hints of the phenolic funkiness that is rampant in the bottles of ESA and TJ Ale that were oh so bad. Carbonation is light and prickly, and the body is light as well. This is a very good beer that I can image being wonderful if cask conditioned (as I have heard from schoolteacher). If somehow I can be assured that the beer isnt going to be one of the woeful ones I have come across several times, I would certainly get this again.","yen157","Aug 10, 2004"

Tasting this makes me wish I had gone to the Standard Tap and dared the hangover gods. This is good. Heavily hazed brown-amber with a big airy head that fades slowly. The aroma is heavily fruity with apricots, grapefruits and plums riding over the malt. The flavor turns maltier with a strong toasty presence supported by a mild bitterness and that great fruitiness.

Smelled of sweet hay with pumpkin spice and just a hint of hops -- an oddly pleasant combination. The mouthfeel was thick -- like molassas but not quite as syrupy. It felt very good on the palate and allowed the flavor to coat. The taste was spicy -- I detected orange, clove, and some floral characteristics -- quite complex, actually, with a complimentary level of bitterness in the aftertaste.

The brew is overly hoppy with a harsh mouthfeel and minimum malt presence. A floral hop spice starts to work it way though toward the bottom of the glass.

Pleasant palate, lovely blend of toasty, caramel malts, moderate bitterness, floral hops at first the warmer it became, the hoppier it got (piney). High carbonation, very tight bubbles, a little too effervescent. Cleansing. Minimal aftertaste, light maltiness and soft piney hops. Perfect abv, the alcohol is just barely noticeable at the finish.

Aroma is a full bouquet of pine cone scented hops along with tones of caramel malt underneath the hops. Taste is predominantly hops of earthy, pine cone variety with a trace of buttery caramel malt to complement the bitterness. A little off balanced just way too much hop bitterness in my book. Mouthfeel is medium bodied fluffy textured with hop resins creating a slightly oily texture in each sip. The drinkability is kicked down a notch due to the fact that the hops a tad overbearing, but overall this beer should be experienced.","WVbeergeek","Jun 17, 2003"

I think this is probably my favorite ESB I have ever had. Although it is called ESA. Definitely a good example of the style. The hops are present and quite dominant but there is still a strong malt backround to balance the bitterness.

The aroma was semi sweet malt (dark) caramel, citrus and floral hops, sugar coated almonds, bread and yeast. The flavors that hit my tongue were of dandelions, hops, fruit, roasted nuts and semi-sweet dark malt. It had a semi-dry finish and a hoppy after taste, not strong but present.

Also present was a touch of roasted malt and some biscuit. The beer starts bitter, then a little malt sweetness and ends bitter and dry with the herbal hops coming forth once more. I thought the beer was just a bit sharp overall and could have used a bit more roundness.

The hops are nice and spicy that could have used a little more help from the carbonation to make this brew even more crisp. I did not find this beer to be really bitter. Maybe the malts balanced out the bitter flavors, but it is not a bad thing. As you get right down to the end of a swallow, then the bitterness comes in. It adds some needed complexity to the brew. I was also picking up a bit of alcohol in the aftertaste of this one. I don't know the abv, but I would hope it is pretty high since the alcohol comes through.","ElGuapo","Feb 18, 2003"

The first sip is more bitter than the aroma would have led me to believe. The wonderful bitterness is lightly supported by some malt in the background. The finish is a little dry, and some metallic aftertastes are present. Also a bit of a medicinal note lingering on the palate. A bit a fruitiness shows through the flavors a subsequent drinks are taken. The beer feels thin on the tongue, but itfeels like it is trying to hold on to the back of your tongue as it gradually fades down your throat.
