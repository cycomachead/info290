3.58,9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 7/10/2013. Pours fairly cloudy deep orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of orange peel, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, herbal, grass, light nuttiness, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with decent strength. Taste of orange peel, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light toffee, light nuttiness, herbal, grass, and toast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange peel, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, light toffee, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and decent robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this was a good ESB. Well balanced dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 07, 2014"

The nose comprises orange peel, grass, flowers, mild caramel, and buttery biscuits. The taste adds some mandarin orange character and wheat to the foundation set by the smell. Whatever maltiness that was there before is mostly o'ercome by the orange and lemongrass. The body is a rather light medium, with a just-light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel.

This beer pours cloudy copper and has a nice foamy head that lasts a little longer than the other beers form this brewery. The nose is fruit and caramel; I can definitely expect some sweetness if the smells are indicative at all. Not the case. This beer is pleasantly bitter and mild.

Taste is a little bitter upfront with the pine taste and a slight bit of citrus in there as well. Really a crisp finish with this and a lingering taste of the citrus/pine combo.

ItÂ’s a sour, tangy, tinny, yeasty quality. The organic ESB has always struck me as the single best idea this brewery has come up with: a means to serve and cater to a very vocal and increasingly powerful segment of the consumer marketplace, that being the Organic Consumer. A fresh bottle of LakefrontÂ’s Organic ESB beats the pants off the fresh tap of Stone Mill Pale Ale I had recently, and is about as close to style-specific as you can get, organic grains and hops notwithstanding. But this bottle is off: the sour, tinny, tangy yeasty quality I noted above is present here to an almost overwhelming degree. Sure thereÂ’s some malt sweetness here, and even a notable degree of hop bitterness, but what is this funky tangy weirdness? It canÂ’t be a water quality issue Â– can treated Lake Michigan water produce such a quality? Someday IÂ’ll take their brewery tour again (which is a great tour) and try this stuff fresh from the brewery versus a fresh bottle (hey, a guy can dream, right?)

The aroma...well, what is there isn't bad, it is just faint. If you try really hard you ccan smell dark fruits with a generic malty sweetness, but the extra effort it takes to smell the aroma is worth what you get in return. The taste is not unlike the aroma. Faint and underwhelming. Again it isn't bad, but there is nothing special about it. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, and is a bit watery. Overall, this isn't a very good ESB, and I do not plan on drinking it again.","KarlHungus","Apr 04, 2006"

3.78,15.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability -- Very drinkable. One could easily throw back a few on a pleasant Friday summer evening after work while sitting on the porch. This is the second six-pack I've purchased. The first pack I tried was excellent. This time around the beer tastes more common like a Miller High Life. It could be that I've been spoiled by drinking a lot of IPA's and Imperial IPA's though. Still a great beer. I would recommend this beer to someone who is looking to move up from macro beers to the finer micros.","ClearDog","Aug 19, 2005"
3.86,17.7,3,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: I'm captivated by this beer's aroma--it must be similar to some perfume my mom wore when I was a baby, because I'm irresistably drawn to it. Other than that, the beer is good, but unexceptional.","battlekow","Jul 30, 2005"
1.71,-47.9,3,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,"Drinkability: Why? No complexity, no balance, no depth, no reason to buy it. Doesn't even stick very close to the style. Drinks like a megabrew attempt at a real beer. Back to the drawing board, folks.","PorterLambic","Jul 09, 2005"

2.66,-18.9,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Lakefront Organic ESB isn't extra special, it isn't strong and it isn't all that bitter. Given the fact that I'm drinking this bottle at what should be the peak of its powers (it was bottled about one month ago), its lackluster showing is even more disappointing. Of course it's a damn sight better than Lakefront's execrable Pumpkin Lager. The flavor flashbacks from that one still cause me to break out in a cold sweat. I'd say avoid this one; even if you like ESBs.","BuckeyeNation","May 18, 2005"
3.7,12.8,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Delicate, lightly sweet, caramel-accented and subtly toasty malts combine with a thin thread of yeasty fruitiness and billowing grassy and floral hops to give this crystal-clear, dark amber brew a quaffability that's worth noting. It's well-balanced and drinkable with just enough character to keep you coming back for more. It makes an excellent session ale; serves as a great introductory beer to the uninitiated; and also works well for a backyard BBQ or sunny sporting event. It's worth trying; and it gets bonus points for being organic!","NeroFiddled","May 06, 2005"

3.55,8.2,4.5,4.5,3,4,3,"This is a decent beer, but probably the least enjoyable of the sampler. I'll sticky with my Un-Organic stuff instead. As far as ESB's go, this is decent for the style, but I don't like them in general.","Mitchster","Feb 17, 2005"
2.96,-9.8,4,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Clear copper color, small white head fades fast. Swwet carmel malts combined with a metallic tang and slight floral hops. Taste is very smooth and non-intrusive. Pretty bland, they should've called it Organic KOB (kind of Bland). Needs to be served warmer than I did (cellar temp), so maybe room temp? not very interesting, but not bad either.","TastyTaste","Dec 29, 2004"
3.18,-3,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,"Clear, gold in hue, there is a nice yeast haze that glitters when held to a light. It is like looking a Vegas from an airplane (okay, not quite). The head was white in color, about a finger in height; head retention was acceptable, the foam slowly faded to a fizzy cap. This cap lasted a few more seconds before during to a thin collar. Subsequent lacing was spotty and infrequent. The first couple sniffs of the nose were very nice, fruity, bready, toasty caramel, grassy/flowery hoppiness, and then I set my glass down. When I picked it up again a moment later a vegetable aroma was noticeable, yuck (this scent is very, very weak but I could still make it out). Overall the potency of the nose is low, it is kind of clean too. The bouquet has a flaw but it still tolerable, not quite inviting though. The palate is decent, no flaws. There isnÂ’t much going on really. What flavors are in play is a balanced offering of mildly zest citrus hints, some flowers, and a kiss of grass from the hops. Light bitterness. The malt offers a weak suggestion of caramel and toasty bread. This beer falls in the realm of an ESB; it could be way more flavorful. Malts could be richer, drier as well. Hops could offer more bitterness, more liveliness. It is the balance that saves this beer and like I said, it is okay. Medium-light in body, thin, light carbonation, the mouthfeel is empty. Sad. Drinkability is limited. One bottle will be enough for me. It is another yawner from LF. It was purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Milwaukee, WI.","bditty187","Dec 15, 2004"

3.08,-6.1,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Pours a soft head which disappears completely after a moment. Color is a pleasant amber. Initial taste is a slight bitterness with some malt, which fades away with the finish. Not a lot of body, nor is it highly carbonated. Makes a decent session beer, but there's little unique about it.","allengarvin","Jul 22, 2004"
3.62,10.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer has a dark orange/brown body, with a small, off-white head topping it. The scent is floral/bitter hop, with a buttery tone to it. The taste has a buttery feel, caramel malts, bitter hops. Somewhat of a weird flavor present like tobacco or well-water or something. The organic aspect leads to a unique taste, but i cant say its the best in the land.","Tballz420","May 15, 2004"
3.36,2.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Fluffy white head with heavy lacing. Nice rust color with little aroma. The taste itself was pretty bitter with decent hoppiness. This is a very crisp beer with a grain-like finish. The taste left on the tongue is very dry and somewhat unrefreshing. This is not my favorite, but I do believe it is a decent brew by lakefront. I do like the whole organic thing!","ALESwhatCURESya","May 04, 2004"
3.18,-3,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Clear orangey copper color. Frothy pale cream-colored head, sticks in nice fluffy patches on the glass. Pleasant brown sugar/cinnamon smell, slightly buttery. A little on the fleeting side for mouthfeel, more would be better. Malt dominates the profile, toffee, maybe bare molasses but the thin texture makes it go away too fast. This leaves you wanting because the hoppiness is light for the style, just lightly prickly and not enough to save the finish from being pretty ordinary. Could use more body and spicy elements for an ESB, though its attractive and decently drinkable.","ADR","Apr 28, 2004"

3.31,0.9,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Poured a chilled hazed amber with an off-white head. Light aroma consisted of grain and buttery biscuit. Thin to medium-bodied mouthfeel, with decent carbonation.

Pleasant aroma, initially very sweet, with hints of new mown hay lingering.. Nice malty taste, with some initial sweetness, however the beer goes dry fairly quickly, with a clean aftertaste. Not much in the way of hops. Interesting alcohol warmth towards the end. Decent.","jackndan","Apr 25, 2003"
3.71,13.1,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear light copper. Has a head that stays at around 1/4 inch, and leaves patches of lace on the glass. Aroma is pretty mild, with some grass and bread notes. Flavor is very nicely balanced, with a touch of sweetness, some bread-like flavors, a pleasant earthy bitterness, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, with low carbonation. This is very subtle for an ESB, but makes for a very easy drinking beer.","zerk","Mar 19, 2003"

Upfront floral hop and sweet maltiness, cleaned up by a pleasantly piercing bitterness. A very clean beer, light yeast character, strong hop and thick malt perception. An excellent American ESB.","hooligan","Feb 22, 2002"
