"This isn’t going to blow you away flavor-wise but it’s definitely flavored enough, and the cask conditioning nicely melds the flavor here and just gives this an all around kick-ass drinkability. I’d always be good for a pint of this if I saw it here on cask. Nice stuff."
"O: Good, but not great. Pretty decent. And likely a bit of Homer in my grading as Deschutes is one of my favorites."
"O: Not as hop forward or bitter as I remember, but still a tasty malt-forward beer. I don't quite know how it holds the line to the style though."
"What we have here, seemingly, is a decent amber ale. It needs a fair bit more biscuit edge and noble hop bitterness to slide into the ESB zone."
"This is the kind of beer I could enjoy many of in one sitting. Thanks for reading, and Cheers!"
"Pours a standard one finger head in length, the head is slightly off white, but just barely. Mostly big bubbles in the head, but there are a fair amount of small bubbles underneath that. Decent lacing throughout the glass. The head isn't hanging around too long, but it's not going away completely, something that I have found common in Deschutes beers. The body is a cloudy dark orange color, very little visibility through this beer. The color is unique, a little dark for the style, but I don't really care. The carbonation looks just about right. Overall the look is pretty impressive. On the smell, it's pretty malt based, very small hop note in there, but that works for the style. Does it smell good? Yeah, great? Not at all, pretty standard. You can tell the malts will taste good, but still, not an amazing smell. Maybe it's just the style I'm not a fan of, but the smell is only ok for me. I expect this to be a solid beer, just not my thing, but I'll give it a fair chance. Yeah, not my kind of beer here, I have had better ESB's though, so I'm a little confused here, overall it's not bad, but not too great either. The alcohol is a little too prominent in this beer for only 5.3%, the hops are very minute and the malt is just not the type I like. All over it's just not very balanced, and it's kinda all over the place. The alcohol is probably the most dominant factor really, which is never good. Then after the alcohol it's just a random mixture of malts and small hops. I'm trying to rate this beer in terms of the style and I think that it's just messing with my head. As far as a beer goes - it's just not that great for me. A little sour, which is unwanted, and the carbonation adds to the weirdness. Despite all these flavors it does have some watery characteristics to it. It kind of tastes like a mix between a scotch ale and a IPA. It's a very weird beer, and perhaps it's just the style, but like I said I have had better ESB's, so I dunno. Mouthfeel is decent, it's big enough to support the style, and the carbonation is right. Drinkability is ok, but these weird flavors for sure don't help. Overall I'm very confused with this beer, and I'm sure I'm just over thinking things and confusing myself, but only to some extent, it's a very weird beer. With all that being said, it's still not a terrible beer, I'd drink it again, but only if nothing else was available. Strange beer."
"The aroma was light, lots of grain and light spice with a smooth, mellow and light fruity hint that popped up toward the finish. Smooth mellow flavor with a n even cosistency. My only knock is it came off as more of a mild ale to me as the hop flavor was not really too high and not much in the way of bitter flavor. Easily drinkable though as no real heavy feeling or flavor."
"Another addition from one of the old notebooks. Brought back to us from Oregon by my (ex-)wife's uncle. Poured a nice amber color with a little light tan head. Aromas of light hops, sweet malt and caramel. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with citric hops, caramel and sweet malt."
"O- I'm dissapointed I have to say. Deschutes normally crafts devine brews, but this comes up short. Its above average, but not to the level I expect from Deschutes, I love a good ESB too, it may be my favorite style. Needs a little punching up. Since I can't find this locally and there are some other good local ESB's around it might not be a bad thing."
"drinkability is great - while i might be a huge fan for this style i could drink this beer for an entire session"
"Had this on tap at the Deschutes brewpub in Portland. Pours a copper colour with thin white head, leaving small patches of lacing. Smells of earthy hops and caramel malt. Flavour has very mild bitterness. Nice carbonation level on this. An easy drinking beer, but no where near the level of many of the other beers on tap at Deschutes."
"For some reason these aren't distributed as much as they used to be. Probably the most drank esb in my lifetime. Anderson Valley, close second I'd guess."
"Pours a moderate orange-copper color with a nice white head and a pretty good amount of lacing. The nose has some light malt as well as some floral and earthy hops. The taste strikes a nice balance between the hops and malt, with the mouthfeel surrendering to a bit of bitterness. Drinks quite well and this would be one nice brew to have locally."
"Very drinkable and very good overall."
"D: Overall a very well balanced beer. Very good."
"Do they make Married Man DESB? (Do they even make double ESBs?) Regardless, this brew pours a mostly clear reddish-amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, flowers, light orange peel, and light slightly blackened biscuits (they were only left in the oven a few seconds too long). The taste is very similar, though the bitterness (mostly from citrus hops eliciting a sensation of orange peel) is stepped up to a greater degree. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, wet feel. Overall, a nice ESB that lives up to its third letter."
"Bachelor ESB poured an impressive dark amber with significant red undertones from the bottle that I purchased at a local Portland store. The head was modest, but present, with good lacing. I was somewhat less drawn to the scent of this one when compared to many of the other reviewers -- it seemed a bit flat for my tastes, with an acetic, lemon smell accompanied by faint pine and other resins. The mouthfeel and taste are much more rewarding with a bold, yet balanced carbonation, and predominant flavors of grapefruit, dry herbs, and malts."
"D - Very good drinkability, at 5.3% this is a nice beer to go through a few of in a sitting. Will definitely get again."
"D- a worthy offering from deschutes, but not my favorite by far"
"Pleasant citrus and floral aromas. Fairly thin in the mouth, not overly carbonated. Some distinct malty bite at first. This quickly faded into a deceptively watery finish that expanded into a lingering grapefruity bitterness. Pretty drinkable, although the bitterness on the finish might grow to be a bit much after a pint or so."
"One finger white small-bubbled head, medium dissipation with significant lacing. Clear copper body with significant carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Caramel malts dominate the nose balanced by floral hops. Malt forward taste profile, some breadiness, a bit sweet, with a bit of hop bitterness on the back end, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, decent effervescence. Really drinkable at this ABV, very sessionable, tasty, worth a try. Another winner from Deschutes."
"M/D - The taste doesn't cloy or stick to your mouth, it goes down well and stays like that. The drinkability is above average. Perhaps it's just the style, but I would have enjoyed more kick to the hop taste."
"Drinkability: this is a solid beer which I'm really enjoying. I wouldn't mind keeping a sixer around to share with guests."
"Appearance has a roasted amber color to it with a thin head and less than fair lace. Smell of rich malts of caramel with some citrus fruits. Taste has a nice malty caramel citrus flavor with a nice hop that come from behind. Mouthfeel is medium with good body and carbonation. Overall this is a nice solid ESB."
"Classic English style ESB. Doesn't try to be something it's not (i.e. stray from the malt-hop balance). In a context of 2010 (or 2009) where hoppiness seems to be a primary virtue, this brew may not measure up. It's not ""exciting"". But, in a context of perfect hop/malt balance this offering from Deschutes is near perfection. Easy to drink, very easy to enjoy. I could drink it all spring-summer-fall."
"D: Emphasis on bittering hop, moderately strong ale. The caramel malt bite lowers the drinkability for me."
"Overall a decent to good ESB."
"Overall impression: Well balanced, sessionable and enjoyable ESB."
"A more tannic version of a British style ESB but with the same mellow hop flavor expected. Drinks well with a long finish. Great for conversation with the out of town guy sitting next to me (poor sap lives in North Carolina...)"
"This is the last of Deschutes' year round ales for me to review. Their consistency and value are extraordinary. Well done, again."
"A brew I often overlook in Deschutes' lineup, but I'm awful glad I grabbed a sixer of...worth going back for more."
"This is a very nice interpretation of the style. Well-balanced - hoppy with a firm malt backbone. ""English"" character in aroma and taste. An enjoyable brew!"
"Nice amber color with a small amount of head. Smells of bread, slightly piny hop scent, malts. Tastes bready with a nice hop flavor, hops are more piney than citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. This is a decent beer not as good as some of the other Deschutes stuff I've had but not bad."
"D: Very drinkable & a great representation of an ESB"
"D- Good drinkability, smooth with a lingering bitterness"
"Poured into 12oz glass. Poured with about an inch of khaki colored head, made of lots of tight tiny bubbles. The head lingered leaving good, sticky lacing. A pretty, dark orange/light brown color. Very nice malt foundation in the aroma, with a hint of hop spice. A smooth balanced flavor with just a touch of hop bittering on the back of the tongue. Great body, smooth, balanced and full. Wonderfully drinkable, this is an excellent companion for whatever you're doing on an afternoon, the moderate alcohol will not make you foggy so you can concentrate on your other pleasure."
"D: Good."
"Overall- Tasty and drinkable, but a bit monotone and lacking complexity in flavor department"
"D: This is a smooth drinking beer. No big powerful flavors to make this difficult. Just a nice ESB."
"a little light bodied for my tastes, but it has good mild hoppiness combined with a nice malt body"
"True to style, this Extra Special Bitter makes for a great semi-session beer. Share a pitcher with a friend if you can find it on draft or order a few pints for yourself. Deschutes delivers again despite my miss-cue on the pour."
"Mouthfeel is fine with a certain crispness from the hop bitterness. Drinkability is good due in part to the relatively low abv of 5.3%. Somewhat hard to find unless your beer store carries the full line of Deschutes standard beers. Well recommended."
"D: This is the first of these that I've had, and I'm quite a fan. This would be a great session beer, and ringing in at 5.2% makes for an even better session. Great beer."
"Drinkability: My, oh my, what a great beer! This is the second beer I've been blessed to enjoy from the same brewery (my first was their porter), and this is a beer that reminds me of how well an American brewery can interpret an English ESB if they want to. No expense was spared in this one. Nice job, folks."
"Really good clean ESB, also pairs well with food"
"Dark gold with little head this cask version really shows off the malt in the finish. The hops seem to move to the back ground compared to the bottled version. I like the lack of carbonation and the smoothness to the finish. Tastes a lot like a more English ESB"
"Juicy mango and citrus notes hit the front of the palate, followed by fresh, resinous hops and a mineral crispness. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery at first, but the hop bitterness that rides the back of the tongue makes up for it. All in all, this wasn't bad, but I'd be keen to reach for other Deschutes brews first (e.g. Obsidian Stout, Mirror Pond Pale, Inversion IPA, to name a few...)."
"12oz bottle. Pours a beautiful copper colored amber with an extremely sticky off-white head that possesses excellent lacing and retention. The aroma is sweet biscuity malt with some caramel, hints of dark fruits and hops. The taste is incredibly smooth with some sweet biscuity malt, caramel and citrusy hops. An extremely well crafted beer that I would drink all the time if was available here in FL. Overall, Bachelor ESB is another outstanding brew from Deschutes, quickly moving up my list of favorite breweries. Highly recommended."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a very light brown head. Smells mildly of malt and a little bit of pine. Tastes of malt, a little bit of herb, and a solid coppery bitterness with some citrus as well. A nice blend of flavors. Carbonation was about right for my tastes. This is a very drinkable beer, and I've had poured a second if I'd had one."
"The taste is like the aroma, with a nice sweet -bitter balance, a malty, caramelly body and flowery citrusy hops."
"Deschutes makes some quality brew and this is no exception. It's tough to find good American ESBs but this fits the bill. Thanks again for the sample Bill!"
"Drained into a glass to yield a roasted mahogany hue with one finger's width of sea foamed head, good retention with some lacing. A beautiful brew indeed, with an aroma of bready warmth and spicy hops. The smooth and luxurious mouthfeel offers some sweetness making way for a bitter and slightly tangy finish. Delish!"
"Great one to have on cask!"
"Still very sessionable, I remember this having a bit more fruittyness, but a super solid ESB that rivals many brewed across the pond IMO"
"Drinkablity: One of the best standard issue Deschutes brews I have had. I will buy this again."
"The taste was a maltiness up front and some fruitiness from a hopness. The bitterness stays in the mouth a long time and the malt hits the mark on the tip of the tongue. Overall a solid brew and one that is mellow but complex and is very true to Fuller's style."
"one of my first trips into the esb realm in quite a while, wow, what a great beer, I had forgotten how good an esb could be, this is one my all time favorites, bitter like an ipa but a little more smooth, great color a lighter brown that the average ipa, a solid color the whole way through, short head but lingered."
"Pours an orangeish copper color, creamy white head, settles to a thin foam with some lacing. Moderate carbonation. Smell is very bready, faint hop aroma. Taste is malt with just enough hops to keep it honest, very lightly toasted. Mouthfeel is fairly light in body, a bit more ""fizzy"" than I would like to see, but not too bad. Low ABV make this a very sessionable brew, one that could easily become a staple in my fridge."
"Bachelor ESB is another stablemate of standard brews in my fridge... you can get it at just about any grocery store in Boise... for good reason... a very good beer from an exceptional brewery."
"Nice low carbonation -you can feel it, but it doesn't overpower you, and very sessionanble. One of the best North American bitters I've had in a while."
"Body is full...flavors linger and end well with a dry and earthy finish. I like a lot of things about this beer. Well done, Deschutes!"
"I had this one during first NFL game of the year as previous BA did."
"Pours a rich amber hue with a nice one finger fluffy white head that slowly dies down to a thin layer. Lacing is pretty good for the style. Smell is pretty damn citrusy for this style, you can tell it's a west coast brewery. Under the initial hoppy burst follows a sweet caramel malt. Taste is amazing. Such a complete balance all around. The caramel malt is more present on the tongue than I had expected after giving this one a whiff. Starts off sweet, but not bitter. Towards the end a bit of a hoppy dryness emerges leaving a somewhat citrus like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of bubbles. Pretty creamy overall. At 5.2% abv. I could easily put these away one after another."
"Drinkability- A very well balanced brew that I really enjoy. Goes well with almost anything and always goes down smooth."
"Not what I really expected in an ESB. The color of it when poured was an hazy golden amber with a reddish hue. The smell of hops, with a hint of spice and fruity was just sitting there. When poured, it had very little foam and while drinking, no lace what so ever. The taste was not as good as the aroma. Bitter hoppy flavor with not spice or fruit flavor that was evident. I really expect more out of the ESB. A little dissapointed, but, I guess that's how it goes!"
"Rich amber color with a good head of white suds. Mostly clear with a filtered polish. Smell was gently malty and fruity with a good measure of bright floral hops though not as much hop aroma as you'd expect form a pale or IPA. The bittering was nicely balanced and allowd this beer to hold onto a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel was pretty normal, not really too chewy. I drank three bottles and enjoyed all of them from start to finish, so I'd say the drinkability is ideal."
"Rich, amber copper body with glowing edges and a soft, fluffy cushion of light khaki head. Great lacing. Nose is ripe with chewy butterscotch and caramel. Fresh, strong hop aroma of pine and tea leaves cuts through. This ESB has some definite PNW influence and it works well. Taste starts with toasted malts and rounded hop bitterness. Light pine and citrus. Toffee and fruity malts in the middle. Nice. Finish shows a hint of spice before juicy hop bitterness takes over. Medium-bodied with a gently carbonated feel. Would love to have this on cask. A very nice ESB."
"The finish is very dry and the mouthfeel, for me, is spot on for the style. This is a very good ESB and I'm glad that it's back in town after being absent for many years. I'm just hoping that I can get some fresher samples so I can compare and perhaps update this review."
"Beer poured a cloudy orange with a foamy tan head leaving a nice lacing. Nose is of sweet malts and a hint of floral hops. Taste is of caramel malts balanced by those floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently carbonated. Overall drinkability is OK. This is a decent offering from DeSchutes and is worth a try."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber hue with golden highlights, topped by a good inch of creamy off-white head. Nice aroma of floral noble hops and mellow, slightly sweet malt. Palate is well-balanced between assertively bitter noble hops, mildly sweet malt, and a lightly fruity undertone. A lingering bitterness follows the finish. Body is smooth and creamy, very nice for an ESB. A very drinkable ale, and one that is overlooked in the Deschutes lineup."
" A nice pour into a SA Boston Lager glass. Copper body with golden hues exposed by the light. A thick head that was white in color and held up for quite a bit. Citrus hops and sweet malt in the nose. A nice subtle bitterness, and not at all astringent, due to the hops that are nicely balanced with the malt. A medium-bodied ale that is very drinkable. A solid take on an English style ale."
"D: A good drink, this one has the malt and hops to make for a good couple of hours."
"One last little point - I find the bottle to be good looking. I am a sucker for nicely designed labels."
"Pours a cloudy orange amber color, nice carbonation, nice foamy tan head, nice lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of sweet malts, slight hops, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly hoppy, with a nice caramel under tone, the finish has a nice bitter bite. Medium body, well rounded brew. Drinkable, a nice offering from Deschutes."
"The labeling is very artistic and enjoyable, too. Just an all-round winner!"
"Pours with average head,orangy-ruby in colour. Clear enough you could make a crayon colour out of it (Bachelor ESB orange!). Aroma with a splash of hop bitterness, nothing overly lively or present. Pleasant, but slightly timid. More assertiveness on the mouthfeel, an interrupting bitterness upfront. Might interrupt the flavour except there isn't much. Very aggressive bitterness that abrupts the drinkablility - no need for such hops. The malt is nice, I wish it was showcased a little more. I think for this style my first choice would be the British brewer. I think this could be more if tried to be less."
"The smell is somewhat light, but nice and full of biscuit and malt flavor. The taste is classic and bold while giving way to a substantial hop flavor in the end. It's solid in the mouth and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Well-crafted and nicely balanced; a great session beer"
"Very bitter, and some malting in finish. Grapefruit C-hop aroma. Golden with white head. Consumed three days past expiration date. More bitter than I would like so not as drinkable as it could be. Some citrus. Dry aftertaste. Was not what it could be with food. Quite median brew."
"Notes: Ehhhh....its above average for the style but from deshutes I was honestly expecting more. To be fair its a decent brew that is without a doubt is reccomended. I would pass this to someone trying a ESB for the first time without hesitation but nothing for me to get overly excited about."
"This is a very drinkable beer, perhaps the best Deschutes product I have tried. Ill be looking for more Bachelor ESB."
"Pop the cap and witness a pour that results in an inch thick head and copper body. Nose is full of caramel and extremely mild grapefruit hops. Lacing follows the progress of the consumption. Taste is caramel up front, grapefruit and pine. Mouth is a pleasing full body. Yep, this could be consumed over and over. A winner for Deschutes, who have continued to kick ass ... moreso as time rolls on. Props to you Deschutes, please keep giving us in the northwest the brews we dream of."
"Clear Amber/Dark copper color with pillowy head that has great retention and kept a nice thin foam layer the whole time. Smell is sweet caramel malt with good earthy hop aroma. Medium body mouthfeel with a dry bitter finish. Great deep hoppy bitterness all over, taste is well balanced between a great malty character and serious bitterering. Aftertaste is awesome, after each drink you can keep on enjoying. I really enjoy this beer, I think I will have another now."
"Quite a nice mouthfeel making this a very nice brew. More of a wintery one, or one for accompanying food than a summer cooler."
"Drinkablity: Go give this a shot as your session beer. I think the variety of flavors achieved in this brew will give even a seasoned palate a run for their money."
"The beer poured copper with a finger of head that dissapeared about half way through the beer, so it retained fairly well. The head left fine lacing at the top of the pour. The nose was a doughy malt character with some citrus as well. The taste was super balanced: caramel and floral hops. The beer just bettered as it warmed, and I'll admit to finishing one from this six pack earlier in the week at room temperature. A medium bodied but full flavored brew that is super drinkable."
"Overall: A great treat to have a friend bring me this one from the Northwest. Really a fantastic ESB that drinks easily while still being really interesting."
"Drinkability- A very well done ESB. Super easy to drink. Could use a touch more bitterness though."
"Drinkability As I said, I couldn't put this one down and could have another right away. Superb beer."
"The beer pours an amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a fine malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It also has a nice citrus hop aroma that refreshes and balances. The taste is good. It has a smooth malty flavor that is light, but full flavored. It has a floral hop flavor that adds quite a bit of bitterness, but nothing over the top. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a fine ESB. It is well balanced and full of flavor; a good drinker."
"Thanks to my step-cousin who is now a brewer at Deschutes for bringing me this fine brew."
"Pours a deep copper with a nice fluffy two finger head that settles nicely leaving a fair amount of lace,big aromas going on some dry biscuit malt with a little caramel and big juicy citrus to balance I even get some metallic in there.Very solid brew hoppier than say a true English ESB but there is a firm lightly sweet maltiness and nuttiness that keeps it pretty well balanced.A real nice beer well rounded and very flavorful my first ale from Deschutes was pretty darn good."
"Medium bodied, good session beer, quite drinkable, doesn't wear out your tastebuds."
"A nice sweet assertive carmel taste on the first sip leadsd nicely into the firm hop taste and bite. The Medium body of the beer adds to the flavor and charcter profile of this beer. A true winner in my fridge!"
"Bachelor ESB is clear, deep bronze, has a sudsy head, and is well-balanced and easy to drink. It is suited to popular tastes for all the best reasons."
"I'm sure I've said it before, but I'll just have to risk repeating myself: Deschutes brews very good beer. Bachelor ESB doesn't beat out Brutal Bitter for top ESB in my book, but it wins the silver medal quite comfortably."
"Mmmm, a fine ESB from one of the nation's finest breweries. It pours a rich glowing amber with large fluffy head and tons of beautiful lacing. Sweet aroma of caramel malts and a light hop twinge. The beer is hugely flavorful, with lots of strong tasty malts, and a crisp hoppiness that is just about perfectly balanced. Both elements are forceful, but that is the Northwest way. The malts put forth bready flavors that are reminiscent of English ales, but a bit more in your face. Hops linger on the tongue for a great aftertaste. Mouthfeel perfectly soft and smooth. The beer is nourishing and very drinkable. A success on every level, and yet another example of Deschutes' brewing prowess."
"The copper with a slight haze is topped by a soupy, white head. The aroma is slightly hoppy with a bit of light caramel malt. The flavor is mostly the malt, the caramel again with a bit of nuttiness. The hops just peek around the edges of the malt, but this is a pretty tasty and drinkable beer."
"Pours dark amber with some orange tint. Thick, fine white head boils down to a little cap. Got a bit of citrus and pepper from hops, and pleasing sweet, worty, malt scent. Hop flavor first on tongue, a hint of bitterness, strong malt counters into the middle and through aftertaste. Malt is nicely roasted nuttiness and some fruity sweetness as well. Balance is superb, aftertaste is smooth and a bit creamy. Some moderate lacing. Very good and incredibly easy to drink - but rather unexciting, making it a bit boring for my tastes."
"Pours a hazed copper and burnt orange with a very nice frothy cream-colored head with a mix of small dense areas and large massive bubbles making it obvious this one has body. The smell consists of nice caramel, floral and citrus hops, biscuity malt, and a dry bitterness. The taste consists of a hop bite with smooth toasty malts and caramel with some citrus notes tapering into a thin but dry finish. This is a medium bodied beer and it finshes slightly dry. This is a nice brew, however, this one did not make me crave another. Maybe too satisfying or it becomes less complex as I work my way through. Still good! Cheers!"
"Very drinkable unless one can't stand any kind of bitterness. I enjoyed the piney dimension to this ESB, and think its a nice change of pace."
"Light cloudiness, darkish amber color -- small tan head that dissipates, the aroma is bitter and grainy, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is thin and syrupy, and the flavor is smooth and mild up until the bitterness in the aftertaste. Its not bad, but leaves me wanting more. Fairly drinkable, but more due to its lack of offensiveness than a real desire to drink it."

"Drinkability  Another fine offering from Deschutes Brewery. This one went down like water."
"Medium copper color, med/large head. Aroma is malty and slightly fruity. Medium malts, med malts. Nice malt flavor, bitter as expected. Good taste, bitter yet malts are evident. Nice balance. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is bitter, yet somewhat malty."
"Overall, one good ESB."
"Overall Impression: Doesn't really stand up to the tastiness of Mirror Pond or Black Butte, but not a bad beer."
"A hazy, deep amber/reddish copper body is topped by a long-standing, frothy ivory head. It holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace at the offset. The nose is fresh and inviting with floral/grassy Goldings and a mild yeasty fruitiness over a lightly sweet and biscuity malt. The body is medium/full and it's quite creamy in the mouth, no doubt due in part to it's very fine and moderate carbonation. The flavor is as the aroma suggests it may be, with a dryish biscuity malt that's laced with fruitiness (soft berries, some cherry) and infused with floral/grassy hop flavors. A firm bitterness backs it, and ushers in a dry finish that lingers shortly with a dollop of gently caramelish malt. Quite nice, and surprisingly authentic ""English"" in character. A flavorful beer that doesn't step over the edge, and thus retains a great deal of drinkability. Sometimes a little restraint goes a long way!"
"Another fine beer from Deshutes. This ESB poured a medium amber, excellent head retention was noted, and lacing was in rings.Very smooth and English in it's character with a solid malt base and subtle hopping. Decent mouthfeel and very drinkable. I say go for this fine ESb if you come across it."
"Very drinkable..good example of and Extra Special Bitter..will buy again."
"The beer pours a lightly hazy burnished copper color, the head impressive in size; frothy in texture, light tan in color, with the resultant lace a fine covering sheet to conceal the glass. Hop floral start to the nose, sweetly malt, citrus crisp, fresh, and a treat to the senses. Start has malt sweetness with the top slender in its feel, perkily acidic, the hops forthright in their spicy bite, aftertaste dry and lingering. Bitters as a style, I think overlooked and underrated, I for one like the style and wish more were brewed and easily available."
"I am really impressed with Deschutes and the consistency that they display in their overall production of quality beers."
"A decent beer but lacked some flavor for my tastes. The beer looks awesome in the glass with its copper color with some reddish tones. Smells fruity with bready grain aromas. For an ESB I thought it was lacking in the malt department and wasn't all that bitter. Carbonation was high, maybe this was detracting from the flavor of the beer."
"Copper in color with minimal head...nice husky/oily hop nose along with some caramel malt tones in the aroma...I also get some alcohol on the nose too....taste is pretty good...that husky/oily hop bite emerges but there is a good malt back bone here...a quality ESB with some above average bitterness.."
"Notes: Very flavourful ... quite impressive. I must say ... this is a great ale, it goes great with marinated grilled flank steak."
"The beer pours a copper color with a thin off-white head.  Chill haze is barely evident, but there nonetheless.  This beer has a nice little hop boquet.  Fruity and floral.  There's some bitter tones here but they don't blow me away.  Fruity esters present.  And some sweet caramel malt backing (or so it seems).  Body is medium.  Finish is somewhat dry, but O.K."
"Another great Deschutes beer.  Nice amber color and lasting head.  Like the other Deschutes brew this one has a strong maltiness with a fine hop flavor balance.  Quite enjoyable."
"I'm smelling a spicey concoction of hop and clover.  Rich and complex malty body, with a good kick of bitters.  Definate clover notes intermingle with your palate.  Another great beer by Deschutes."
