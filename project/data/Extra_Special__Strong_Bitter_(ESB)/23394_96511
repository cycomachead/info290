Aroma is thin; malty (caramel), faintly fruity & mildly acetic, with earthy & herbal notes (burley tobacco). Taste is watery malt, tart candied apple, with a hoppy bitter character up front that rapidly balances with the malt. Malt dissipates in the finish to a dry mildly bitter/astringent, lightly metallic aftertaste.  All of the British ESB I\'ve ever encountered are watery & thin. Muted aroma & flavor might best described my experience with this one.","mothmanscott","Mar 29, 2015"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber topped by a couple fingers of creamy light-khaki foam.  The nose comprises sweet berries, light green apple, mild biscuit, and flowers.  The taste holds notes of biscuit malt, mild grass, flowers, light stonefruits, and a twinge of green apple.  The body is a light medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.  Overall, a pretty damn solid brew.  I'm not entirely sure it lives up to the bombast of its same-titled song, but it certainly provides an enjoyable experience.","TMoney2591","Nov 17, 2014"

OVERALL: Not ""Powerslave"" in its power or ""Seventh Son"" in its complexity, this beer nonetheless rates somewhere in the area of ""Fear of the Dark"" or something more recent--a nice take on a classic style; the glass drained quickly...considering the middle-of-the-road price, I would revisit Trooper in the future regardless of the season--a good all-around ale....","dacrza1","Feb 04, 2014"

A hint of sweet bread, then earthy hops bitterness. Nice mouthfeel and it goes down very easily. At only 4.7% ABV, you could easily knock down a couple of these during a show! Fantastic label with Eddie, as well. Perhaps I’m caught up in the novelty a little, but I’m a fan!","McNealc31","Oct 13, 2013"

Taste of caramel, the usual mineral hops of some english beers, and some bitterness in the end. Not bad, but very one-dimensional, maybe to please everyone, but a beer you drink easily.","janubio","Oct 13, 2013"

3.52,4.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer that was very true to style, it reminded me of some of the better English beers I've had with that really malty flavor and signature English Ale yeast. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I think one or two would be enough for me, I think more than that and I would start to get bored with it. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's just a good example of the style. What I liked the least about this beer was how one dimensional it was, I think a little more hops would add some balance and more complexity to this brew, I might buy this beer again, but I don't think I would get it often and I would recommend it to people who like the style. All in all I thought this was a nice beer, it simple and malty. I would think a darker more extreme beer would better suit the persona of this band, but this is probably the style they enjoy drinking so I can't knock them for that, This made for a decent first impression for this brewery and I'll be interested to see if they put out anymore Iron Maiden beers.","StoutHunter","Oct 03, 2013"

Nice aroma of bready, lightly biscuit malt, light caramel and light citrus, a hint of hops. Flavor follows, milder than the aroma, with biscuit malt, lightly grainy, mild grassy hops, light citrus. Finishes with a brief amount of stone fruit and citrus, with light lingering grassy hops. Light bodied. A fairly standard light ESB with perhaps a bit more fruit juice flavor, but mild hops and malt. A bit too lightly flavored to be very interesting. A satisfactory light ESB that would not stand out without the Iron Maiden backstory. Kind of odd for me to have a heavy metal band naming a light, almost bland ESB, but I guess those guys are old enough to settle down and yell at kids in their yard.

It's labeled as a premium British beer abv 4.7% abv. Nothing wrong with this beer, filtered bright copper ale with a nice light khaki head, leaves behind layered speckled lacing on the sides of my chalice. Aromatics are nice earthy cereal malts, with hints of pine and citrus from the hop additions. The fruity esters bring out hints of cherry, with caramelized sugars bringing some perceived sweetness as well. Flavor is okay a nice solid British ale, fruit adds some complexity a zing of hops but seems less cohesive and flavor forward than I enjoy. It's hard to knock it, but it doesn't excite me at all. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied a bit of slick hop oils left on the palate, but clean flowing carbonation washes most of any residual oils left on the palate away. Overall a beer I can't picture purchasing unless it was for my old roommate from Bangalore, India...he love British metal from this era...I miss Chaitanya Harimohan due to drinking this beer.","WVbeergeek","Sep 11, 2013"
