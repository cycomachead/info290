"This is a nice, refreshing ESB. It has a nice estery, citrusy-hop character as well as a solid hoppy, bitter finish. The flavor isn't as full as I would like, but this definitely has a solid flavor profile and tremendous drinkability. This is definitely worth a try if you'd like something refreshing and sessionable."
"I like it even if I'm not the biggest fan of the style. Check it out."

"Though this ESB doesn't have the masculine complexities and authentic nutty malt taste of Fuller's ESB, the taste and simplicity of American specialty malts and restrained yeast character keeps its palate a little short and simple."
"Notes; Looks fine, smells great, tastes pretty good. This is a fine little beer and priced right."

"almost more like an american ipa in style than an english bitter. smells like big west coast hops, fresh and bold. some sturdy english malts underneath. flavor is beastly and bitter, but not in an imperial only drink one kind of way. its hoppy and dry, refreshingly crisp, and more drinkable than the name implies. its got a great pine hop profile, only really getting bitter in the finish. mouthfeel is great, medium body with some caramel notes, and prominent carbonation which is uncommon in the english style ales. overall this is an excellent beer, if difficult to categorize perfectly. one of my favorites in the mixed 12pack."

"O-A nice ESB, there are better beers out there, it was worth the try."

"Beast Bitter is actually very tame, but striking nonetheless. Its floral, earthy, resinous hopping and mineral-rich water make it as refreshing as a pre-moistened towelette. It's definitely the kind of beer worth buying six of - and probably the kind most people could just sit down and drink six of to themselves too!"

"O: Breat bitter, not sure why it is called the Beast, but it beats out most other of this style. Highly recommended."
"Wasn't sure what to expect from this given the disparity in the bros and the people's ratings and my relative lack of experience with ESBs. It was alright, drink worthy, but nothing that stopped me. The beer has a gorgeous color with a nice white head that leaves carwash lacing. Nose is pungent with cereal and only the mildest detection of hops. The taste is much the same, but the honey very present honeycomb is robbed of its sweetness and is instead replaced with a very cereal, oaty taste that has an iron touch which maybe where the hops come in. I didn't not enjoy drinking it but it never made me think or savor. Good compared to other ESBs I've had but I think the buck stops there."
"This beer poured out as a nice golden color with a pretty good looking head on it. The head leaves a little bit of lacing but not too much. The smell of this beer is malty, it's a little sweet and earthy too. The taste of the beer gives off a lot of the same features as the smell. Mostly malts dominate the flavors here. The mouthfeel of the beer is decent, I'd say it's average for an ESB. Overall this beer was pretty good and probably worth a try. I can't say that I'd run out for more right away."
"o - Overall a pretty nice ESB. Easy to drink and some light fruit with the light bitterness, would have it again."
"Medium body, a bit higher carbonation, sticky and a bit chewy on the tongue. A pretty nice ESB, and nice balance of bitter hops and bready malt."
"O- While I think this could stand to contain a little more of a malt character to help balance out the heavier bitterness, this is a very decent beer that I'd be happy to enjoy over an evening! It's definitely flavorful, smooth, and quite easy to drink...it is actually quite clean on the palate. I recommend this one and am looking forward to trying more Middle Ages product!"
"This is the sort of ESB that can renew or ignite one's love of the style as well as make me really appreciate different interpretations. A fantastic effort from these guys."
"D â€“ Good tasting bitter, hints of orange peel and caramel. Glad I had this medium bodied brew. I would recommend this brew to those who like bitters"
"Overall a decent americanized pale ale, light malts that are distinguishable, nice grassy hop profile, semi bitter but not astringent."
"O (D) - good and tasty, but dryness slows you down."
"A true bitter in terms of flavor. The malt is present but it plays second fiddle to the hop bitterness. The body is smooth but thin. There is heightened level of carbonation, naturally. The aftertaste is mild bitterness. I detect a touch of sourness. Overall, a balanced bitter."
"Very decent brew. Never had an esb style before. this is the highest rated so I hope others can keep up"
"Pours golden orange with a lot of white head. A good combination of big and small bubbles on the head. Nice lacing. Smells hoppy and bitter with a nice balance. Tastes malty hoppy bitter with a bit of a kick. Really a very well balanced beer. Geat mouthfeel. A very drinkable bitter. Overall i much more agree with the bros rating of this one. A phenomenal representation of style"
"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation yet it is prickly and effervescent for a bit. This is an easy drinking brew and fairly good representation of the style. Quite a clingy resinous bitterness hangs on the tongue. I don't know how fresh this sample was but it was quite unique and enjoyable."
"D: ESBs aren't really my thing, but this is a solid representation of the style the style that drinks really well."
"This is a delicious brew from Middle Ages Brewery. Definitely a beer that I could have anytime, anyplace. The drinkability of this one in my books is very high and it comes highly recommended."
"body is medium, higher carbonation. drinkibility is low, an odd flavor. but I would try it again, as this appears to maybe be an old or off bottle."
"This clear deep orange-red brew gives a healthy inch of frothy stable light tan head from a moderate pour. Smell has a semi-sweet sugar and honey background supporting and balanced by a nice dose of dry mixed citrus and pine hops. The taste is less sweet than the nose implied, pretty dry. It has equal amounts of bitter and sour, makes me think of those Sour Patch Kids gummi candy things. The body is pretty thin but the feel still comes across as creamy to some extent. Great thick lacing throughout. This is a very tasty beer, great combination of bitter and sour with enough malt body to back it up without interfering."
"this drinks pretty well, not a bad beer to session. nothing extremely flavorful, but its pretty true to style. i would drink this again, but im prolly not going to go searching for it. if im offered i wouldnt turn it down."
"Drinkability: I could have several of these. Super clean and surprisingly very fruity. I like this one alot for the style."
"Middle Ages Beast Bitter is a very clear and very lively amber ale with a huge, fluffy, off white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It looks like there's a scoop of ice cream on this beer. It has a very wooden aroma. It kind of smells like an old attic. There is a note of toffee-like sweetness and tart green apple in the nose. It's pretty light bodied and very smooth. The finish is dry, a little watery and a little chalky. It's amply bitter-- wooden and herbal. The tart green apple note is present in the taste. It's slightly sweet but the bitterness keeps it in check. The aftertaste seems fruity. It's not totally pulled together, but it's a pretty inoffensive session ale. It kind of seems like a home brew."
"M/D - foamy in the mouth, not very pleasant at all. I will not be trying this one again"
"(D) i've been looking for my daily drinking beer with a moderate ABV and a taste that suggests an eagerness to be sessioned - i think i've found it! at $9/six it's not the cheapest beer, but it's a very local brew and one of their very best. highly recommended!"
"D - The finish of this beer kind of turned me off...I was hooked with the name and after smelling the beer but once I took that first sip my impression was lowered...I love this brewery but this one was not as good as it could be (bad bottle maybe?...I hope so!)"
"D- this is a great brew. The presentation combines with the appearance and taste to create a great brew. Middle Ages is geared towards their other brews at times. I think this is hands down their best brew and a great treat for the bitter profile enthusiast!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a solid session beer with flavor and substance that make it worth drinking for a while."
"D: Very good considering the style. I could go for another although I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"D- An awesome ESB; great sessionable beer that is balanced very well."
"D: Very drinkable. Quite a nice ESB. I bought one to try it, but definitely would've enjoyed a couple more."
"Drinkability: Overall, I give it a 3 for drinkability as the flavors are interesting and I believe with a better mouthfeel, it would really bring out the flavors and smells a bit more."
"Drinkability: A fairly solid ESB, though I'd prefer it slightly maltier. I could session a few of these, though."
"The aroma is hoppy as expected after reading the bottle. A biscuity malt and bitter aroma are in the background. The flavor is very smooth. It is well balanced once it warms, and the malt characters come through. There is a faint bit of apple and black pepper flavor in there. Fairly interesting if you look for it. carbonation is low, contributing to the smoothness. Very easy drinking."
"Pours a very nice hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slight hop note, and caramel. The taste is malty, slight hop bitterness, with some caramel. Medium body, the finish is dry/bitter. Drinkable, this is a very nice ESB."
"D: Good, tasty and sessionable."
"Note - Great label featuring a sleeping Dragon and a witty poem about the liquid libation inside the bottle... Middle Ages continues to be a highly underrated brewery in my opinion..."
"D: Very good."
"Beautiful pour from the cask, big foamy lasting head with some lacing. Dark amber hue. Smells floral, but not overly intense. First sip had a very nice, thick and buttery mouthfeel. Finish is definitely bitter and sour as well (apple, grape, some fruit there). Very drinkable, though it could use a better aftertaste in my opinion. My first ESB and will have to try again."
"Overall a nice little, light ale, not really what I was looking for, but decent none the less."
"Monster head, beautiful lacing (about which I usually could care less), deep amber color, a nose that penetrates even my deadened sense of smell. Crisp, outdoorsy, kind of peachy. The taste is sharp, doesn't get old. Mouth feel is clean with a nice light hoppiness. Imperial Stout is my choice, but I could definitely get into drinking this. 5.3 ABV, a little light for my likes, makes it a beer you could stay with a while ..."
"This is a very traditional and representative beer of the style. There is a slight butterscotch and sour dough breadiness to the beer. There is also a bit of course graininess, maybe a bit husky as well. Most pronounced is the nice bittering hop presence. There is a grapefruity tangy and estery hop characteristic in the background but a more traditional leafy and bittering hop presence up front. The beer is slightly crisp, but not overly so; the beer is moderately carbonated, actually quite carbonated for the style. The beer has a nice balance between cream and crispness and between the drying and leafy hops and the more floral estery hop. The beer is fairly complex and very nice. This is a light to medium bodied beer with a nice bittering mouthfeel. Worth seeking out. L'chaim."
"Drinkability: The initial taste of the beer was great but the aftertaste really killed my opinion of this bitter. I would have another, but not something I would seek out again."
"All in all, not an everyday beer, but definitely a refreshing break from the usual styles that are prevalent this time of year. Would definitely try again, but not a regular beer for me"
" I enjoyed this one very much."
"D_This is a decent beer, but a so so ESB. Still I would not refuse one if offered. Doesn't quite live up to its brethren across the pond."
"Pours a clear golden amber with 3 fingers of frothy khaki colored head. OK retention, spotty lacing. Smells of floral hops, caramel, bread dough, spices, and butter. Taste starts out with a touch of citrus before lots of caramel malt and bread take over. Finishes with spicy and earthen hops with lots of buttery notes. Medium in body with some fizzy carbonation. Lots of sweet malt and dough with a little bit of hop presence and odd butter flavors in the finish. Not very bittering, not one I would get again."
"Head: Very drinkable due to the balanced nature. Solid, yet understated ESB that shows a good beer doesn't have to feature stark contrasts to stand out. A first try at this brewery for me and I'm looking forward to a few more. I could see fish and chips pairing well."
"Drinkability is quite nice and I enjoy it more as it warmed slightly."
"Definitely recommended..."
"The taste is earthy, tea-leafy, and citric (grapefruit/lemon). There is a caramelish backing. Well-balanced leaning towards bitterish. Lighter side of medium-bodied. Easy to drink - An ESB with an American flair. A nice one!"
"This beer is like a person with a spray tan. Unnatural looking and tasting."
"pours a slightly hazy iced-tea orange w/ a thin off-white head that settles into a pool of irridescent bubbles that don't really stick to the sides of my nonic ; a fruity lemon/tangerine-like smell with hints of earthy hops and alcohol ; a decent hop bite initially that drifts into a nice noble hop flavor, some subtle hints of cereal grain and darker fruits, a bit citrusy and mineral in the finish ; a light-med body with moderate carbonation, feels creamy on the tounge ; a pretty decent ESB, and quite drinkable..."
"D - Solid offering. Lots of flavour and good balance."
"Drinkability is a bit less than the bottled, as the carbonation on tap will just about kill you."
"Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Orange-amber in appearance with decent clarity. Half-inch off-white head quickly dissipated into a thin inconsistent skim with the remnants of foam mostly pooling around the edges. Lots of effervescence present in the glass. Virtually no lacing present during the tasting. Mild nose of hops and citrus. Hoppy flavor is significantly more pronounced and somewhat floral in the mouth. Citrus flavor reveals itself as grapefruit. Also detected a hint of apricot present as the brew warmed. Finish is somewhat astringent and lingers. Lively mouthfeel without the carbonation burn. I could see this as being a fairly drinkable brew; however, a little too hoppy for my taste."
"D - excellent drinking brew."
"drinkability is okay"
"Strong aromas of citrusy/ piney hops come right to the front of this beer. Caramel malts and some horse blanket come to mind as well. Slight oak aroma as well. The flavor is a combination of the aromas and some other off flavors as well. I want to say diacytel, but it is not buttery. Caramel lemony/grapefruit citrus flavors. Really nice warm combo. The mouthfeel is light to med and carbonated, maybe a little too much. Overall one of the best I think to come out of middle ages. I love this beer and could drink it all the time."
"Other: VERY IMPRESSED. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?"
"Pours a hazed amber gold. Nose is a sweet tone with a bitter hoppy edge. Flavor is doughy with a slight bitter tone and a slightly larger sweet edge. Feel is slightly thick with bubble on the tongue and a thicker liquid feel. Overall pretty smooth and drinkable. I have had a few of this breweries beers over the past day and I have to say I am fairly impressed."
"D - This beer is almost as sweet as it smells. It's not quite as bitter as I was expecting, but it's pretty well-balanced. Not a bad bitter... definitely on the sweet side, but it hs a nice caramel maltiness and a pleasant aroma."
"I like this beer but dont think I will search it out again.Not that it is a bad beer but it just dont do anything for me.Mabey its just the style.Sorry Middle Ages..."
"D: I wouldn't drink this brew all day. Maybe now and then, but not a fridge-stocker. This one isn't really my favorite. I don't hate it but it's an ok brew. Middle Ages has yet to impress me."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a relatively weak head. Kind of disappointed by the head. The smell is very citrusy, which tells me hops are abundantly present. (good thing) Taste is very strange, little citrus, earthy, maybe even, actually, I can't put my finger on that strange taste! Mouthfeel is rather flat and unappealing. Drinkability is average."
"Picked this up at Half time in NY. Pours a clear burnt orange maybe sienna leaving a frothy tan head that stays and clings to the glass. The aroma is nice, grassy, honey, earthy hops, bread perhaps, grain, and full of character. The taste is strong bitter upfront, but balanced with a nice honey, doughy, malt feel. This is a strong bitter def not your typical English Bitter it has just enough balance to keep it from being an IPA and is pretty tasty."
"Nice light color with an OK head. A few trails of lacing. First wiff is very appealing. Strong grapefruit hops odor during the pour mixed with some piney notes. By halfway down the glass the smell has become mostly biscuity bready malts and is much less appealing. Taste is very earthy, with some hay like notes. And then i pick up that typical middle ages flavor, buttery and somewhat mettalic. I want to like their beers but they just don't do it for me. Not a terrible beer but what started out with such promise at first wiff from the bottle ended up dissapointing."
"Pours a nice clear amber hue with a huge fluffy three finger off-white head that slowly dies down a while after pour. Love the lacing on this one, stickiness is all over the place. Smell is a sweet buttery aroma with the typical Middle Ages ringwood yeast that's always there. Taste starts off with a sweet bready malt that's followed by a grassy hop bite. Finishes crisp and smooth, love this brew. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. I could put these down one after another. Middle Ages represents this style so well. So happy I basically live next door to this place. Keep it up guys, make the 'Cuse proud."
"Overall this is a pretty good although not outstanding ale. One thing I definitely find with these English ales is that it is best to drink them after they've warmed slightly. Only then does their true character come out."
"Flavor is dead-on English bitter. Not heavy on the malts or hops until the finish when the hops just rise out of the back of the throat and waft to the forefront of the tongue. And then a water cracker-like finish comes out to balance off the bitterness. Fairly light body and nice to drink on a warm evening."
"D: Very easy to drink and somewhat refreshing. I wish the malts were a little bit more on the sweet side. Nothing bad but I wouldnÂ’t purchase again."
"Eric-"
"Slightly hazy orange-amber body topped by a perpetual 1/4"" puffy cream head. Aroma has nice tangerine hop notes, hints of floral and bubble gum as well. Flavor has a bit of bitterness up front, mostly pine rosin with a hint of citrus rind. A touch woodiness overshadows most of the malt, and it quickly leads to a dry finish edged with bitterness once again. A pithy grapefruit aftertaste lingers. Carbonation is a bit aggressive, almost abrasive. Drinkability is average. The least impressive offering I've had from Middle Ages, but still a good beer."
"Creamy and with good body, pleasant aftertaste with no film left over. This is a magnificent brew. It's hoppy but doesn't make a fetish out of it. Subdued but lets you know the hops are there."
"The taste starts to a bitter peach and stays there to end. This product would be much better if they could shorten the lingering aftertaste. That said, a nice brew with lingering(to much) character."
"Thanks, plaid75, for the opportunity"
"Pours a hazy amber/orange, thin white head forms, some spots of lace but it disappears pretty quick. Smell is lots of citrus hops, little bit of floral, acidic, some toffee/buttery malt, but mostly citrus. Taste is weird, tons of citrus, butter and toffee, weird medicinal bitterness, more citrus and acidity with a dry finish, unpleasant. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carb, some residual sweetness. Not very good, overpowering bitterness."
"Simply put this beer is hops and ringwood. If you like the two of those, you'll like this beer. Easy drinking with citrusy hops and fruity ringwood with a little butterscotch. Not terribly complex, but well-made and well-balanced. To put it in perspective, on the bitter scalle it's a notch down from ImPaled Ale. Cheers."
"Pours an opaque, amber color with a huge head and decent lace retention. Smells a bit fruity with a bit of hops. Taste is so smooth; hoppy with a bit of citrus and a perfect malt balance. So crisp, clean and light on the palate, I could drink it all night. This is, at this point in time, my favorite beer. I have moved to PA but go to the brewery at least once a month to pick up some more Beast Bitter. I love it."
"Overall, my 2nd favorite beer in the case. A good beer!"
"12oz. bottle: This one pours with a huge head on it. The color is a slightly hazt, slightly darker golden color. The aroma is a bit floral with some sweetness in the background. The taste is a bit of a mish-mash of flavors. They all seems to collide and donÂ’t balance well at all. Definitely bitter and dry at the end. OK, but I probably wonÂ’t be coming back to this one."
"Overall a nice spicy ESB. A very sessionable upstate NY beer."
"One of the few ESB's I've had that was actually bitter. Not sure of the IBU's here, but they're probably in the 60's or above. Nice grapefruite flavor pervades with a slight pine finish. No malt characteristic at all, which is somewhat surprising for an ESB. This one plays more like an IPA, and is a better example of that style."
"Hazy burnt sienna pour, appears very carbonated with lots of bubbles headed skyward from the bottom and a circular pool of strange bubbles sitting on the top of the beer, all exactly the same in size and shape. It's aliiive!!! Very floral aroma, strawberries and peaches. A bit chalky on the palate, but the solid flow of herbal bitterness from start to finish and tingling carbonation in the finish make that go away quickly. Toffee and strawberry are noticeable, but the hops do their best to dominate the other flavors and smack around the palate a bit. A pretty nice drinker."
"I like this beer a lot. It is very drinkable. This would make for an awesome session beer. I can't get this in my area so I'll be keeping my eye open for it next time I'm out of town for sure."
"Mouthfeel needs work -- overly carbonated and a bit thin for the style. Pleasant, lingering aftertaste."
"Pours a cloudy pale copper under a one finger white head with lots of bubbles. The head fades quickly to thick film, but leaves lots of lace spots. The nose is coniferous, with a touch of malt fighting its way through the sap. The mouth is light and well-carbonated - a bit too much for the style. The flavor profile is about right, with mild sweet plum in the malt, chased by pretty strong pine bitterness. The finish is strong and dry, while the aftertaste fades quickly to a dry tickle at the back of the throat. This beer is enjoyable enough, but something lacks here..."
"Pours a rich gold color. Fluffy white head went into a nice lace. Smell was fruity, piney,and was lighter than expected. Mouthfeel is on the light side.Taste has a good bitter edge,but is nicely balanced by malt.Nice smooth finish.Not over powering. Recommended!"
"Drinkability : I could drink this beer all night with no complaints. Middle Ages is an excellent brewery with superior products. They are truly a joy to drink."
"DonÂ’t be fooled by its name, this is by no means a hop bomb."
"Very tasty bitter, reminds me of a true English pint, a la Fuller's. Sweet and hoppy all at the same time. A bit of a hoppy, leafy aftertaste and somewhat oily. Pleasant all around. Smooth mouthfeel, and a beer that's very easy to quaff. Nice."
"Another nice English style ale from Middle Ages. Happy to have access to them again after too many years."
"Pours golden-amber with an inch or so of frothy head that disappears pretty quickly to a thin surface. Aroma is yeasty, buttery diacetly, and some mild hops. The taste is quite good: butterscotch and noticably bitter with hops. More bitterness at the end with a slight mineral aftertaste. Mouthfeel is also very good, sort of oily with the hop bitterness and tingly carbonation. As far as drinkability goes, this beer is quite tasty and complex but goes down very easily. I picked up a single to compare this with Fuller's since I'm trying to educate myself about ESBs, and this one is definitely the superior brew. Next time, I'll go for a whole sixer. Nice."
"I really need to drink more ESBs. This beer is excellent - more buttery than malty - but its an aspect that I really enjoyed. Bitter, but not overdone. Super drinkable...more please..."
"A quality ESB and well worth drinking."
"Beer is good. Happy ESB beering."
"Drinkability of this is good. Not a stereotypical ESB by any means and I'm not sure if I would classify it as such but it's not a bad brew and I enjoyed drinking it."
"One of the best bitters in the world IMO. Middle Ages has set the standard with the Ringwood / Yorkshire Yeast and not many brewers have come even close."
"Drinkability: Eh."
"Taste/feel: Very dry mouthfeel, almost makes you more thirsty as you drink. Good amount of sweetness, and real clean bitterness, though not a lot of hop flavor. Bitterness was a little too clean, very ""sterile""."
"Unleashed out of the 12 oz. brown bottle, the Beast came out with cleat pale orange body with a foamy two finger head that lasted a short while before leaving wispy lace spread out all around the rim. Very little latent carbonation lingered around. The aroma was well balanced between fruity and bready malt and floral hops. The taste was delicate and subtle, with some toasted biscuit like malts and earthy bittering hops. There was a touch of buttery flavor indicative of diacetyl, but it was well in check and felt quite appropriate here. The mouthfeel was light and smooth with the fine light carbonation. Aftertaste was slightly sour followed by a long drawn out bitter fade. A very drinkable beer that thankfully left out or masked a lot of the funky flavors associated with the Ringwood yeast."
"Thanks to shippos for bringing this one my way. This one pours an amber color with a tall head that has good retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has some caramel character, but is mostly comprised of an American hop that dominates. The flavor has a lot of hop flavor and is slightly unbalanced in this way. For an ESB, it has too much American hops. It's a tasty brew, but too much hop flavor for what it's supposed to be."
"Again, thanks to shippos and clvand0 for bringing this my way. This pours a fine golden color with a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is big in citrusy hops, with a small caramel backbone. The flavor is rather hoppy. Too hoppy for an ESB in my humble opinion. The hop is nice and citrusy sweet, not lingereing and very crisp. The hop fades to a nice orange sweetness. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I like it. Its more of an IPA to me, but still a refreshing and tasty beer."
"Cool bottle, pours a medium amber with a relatively good head. Quite a bit of carbonation. Aroma is not very pronounced. There is just a hint of a citrus mingled with very crisp roasted malt. This is a bitter for sure, starts with a lighter mouthfeel but as it hits the middle of the tongue, the pleasantly intense hop bitterness hits. Surprisingly , this leaves little aftertaste. Very nice"
"Dark golden/amber. Nice head of lighbt white foam that holds up really well, and leaves sporadic lacing patterns on the pint glass. Aromas of sweet ringwood yeast esters, fruits, slight citrusy hops, and butterscotch-like English malts. The hops are also prevalent in the aroma, but they are a tad bit subdued. It seems that cluster and fuggles hops were used in this brew. The taste is fruity up front with a grainy, buttery, bready flavor in the middle and a slightly dry/grainy/hoppy finish that begs you to take another sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and almost cask like, carbonation is moderate and English in style. Drinkability is very good. A damn good ESB from the fine folks at MA."
"Pours a two-fingered cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy, amber color. Nose is a spicy malt. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Starts with a mix of sweetness and hops very similar to Mordue Radgie Gadgie (a pale), hops start coming through at finish. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"A golden amber ale with a foamy of white head, and some lace. The floral aroma of hops mixed with a sweet butterscotch backbone. A very strong bitter hop flavor with only the hint of sweetness along the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel did seem a little watery at first. But after the hop pulverize your mouth it does'nt feel so pronounced."
"Some bitter, and malt and hops and yeast. OK bitter, somehow going off in different directions, drawn and quartered. Somewhat watery mouthfeel. Not best of the line, but not bad. Carbonation instead of high hops, unusual for the line. Golden with head."
"Beast Bitter is a pretty good effort and is a solid ESB. A little more malt would give the hops a sturdier springboard to bigger and better things and is the first change that I'd make if they let me. I can't wait to taste the Middle Ages take on a whole range of styles. Thanks to HappyHourHero, I'll have that chance."
"12 ouncer w/o any freshness indicator. Pours light copper. White head leaving just a smidge of lace. Seems to lightly carbonated, medium body, Dry hoppy nose, perhaps a slight metalic note as well. Grainy, piney hoppyness noted up front, thin malt to the rear. Hops linger on the tongue through the finish. Slight metallic flavor note again lurks somewhere in this brew. Nothing super impressive here, but a middle of the road, passable ale."
"True medium amber topped by a fairly thick, sandy head with a yellowish cast. Hops top the aroma and are very fresh. Grassy and lemony with the lemons verging on cleaning fluids, but not yet offensive. The flavor is loads of caramel and a bit of apple (especially the peels). This is an excellent bitter, but I think the carbonation needs to be toned down a bit."
"A pleasant, session worthy beer. The Ringwood is really starting to grow on me."
"pours a crisp looking orange/amber colour with a fluffy white head. smells buttery and rubbery at the same time. i picked up some caramel and malt as well. not bad. flavour is decent. not great but decent. bitterness up front, followed by some earthy maltiness and subtle sweet caramel flavouring and finished with some more bitterness. fairly simple overall, but midly tasty. this one is fairly light and easy dirnking for the most part, but just doesn't do much to separate itself from the pack. you can tell a beer's relative mediocrity when one doesnt have much to say about it...and i don't."
"This is certainly not the ""beast"" of my good, old college days (Milwaukee's be[a]st); rather this is well-crafted and balanced ESB. It pours a rich honey-gold with a sticky, light head. The first aroma to the nose is its definitive hoppiness, followed by creamy butter notes, but there are present some light ginger and citrus tones too. The taste follows suit: it's modestly tart (the lemony influence) but mostly it is yeasty. Nor is the bitterness all that profound, even at the finish, but it's there. In all, a straight-shooter of a brew."
"While ""The Beast"" conjures images of cheap booze and college parties lived through a funnel, this one certainly gives ""The Beast"" a new connotation, and a much better one at that. The color is a hazy orange and the head, which starts small, certainlyl doesnt get any bigger. In fact, it was gone in about a minute, leaving just a thin top and ring. Smell is tons of sweet buttery popcorn with roasted malts and a tiny hop presence. The taste is less than I had hoped for, but its still good (I think I need to drink it less chiled next time). Its a unpronounced chalky nut flavor with definatley a bit of bitterness, but not quite enough from the hops. The buttery malts come through here too. Mouthfeel is slightly dry, medium body, with a whole lot of small stinging bubbles. Looks, smell and moutfeel are good, however the taste which needs a bit more to it, although it does have a pleasant aftertaste."
"Cool bottle. Pours a nice dark gold, with a heavy head and lots of carbonation. Smells hoppy. Very carbonated body, sweet and smooth with good hops. Quite drinkable. A good beer, but nothing particularly outstanding, fun to try but I don't think I'll buy it again."
"Overall, a decent bitter. Thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the bottle!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, big ol' 1""+ thick foamy white head formed, which left extensive lace as drinking transpired. Brew is a golden/light copper and has a dominating hoppy aroma with slight yeast undertones. Taste is mostly about the hops, but doesn't overdo it, and I can appreciate that. The flavor has its sharp corners rounded by the light malts, which makes it a very easy-drinking brew, not as beasty as one might expect, after all."
"Thanks to PPoitras for the Middle Ages sampler."
"Comments Â– Big thanks to OFS for hooking me up with this East Coast beauty shop."
" Some caramel toffee notes appear as the glass warms and more hops both in the nose and mouth. The Beast within the glass has revealed himself as hops now coat my mouth and spar with the malt.Be patient with this stealthy creature and you will find a fine example of a bitter."
"Pale straw gold in color with a bit of a chill haze, nice finger high head of solidly firm froth that changed some as it drifted down, started whitish as a soft beige-like yellow but as it settled the yellow vanished and went greyish. A thin collar and broken, thickly webbed curtains of lace stick well around most of the glass. Aroma has a very dulled lemony citrus mixed with a grassy edge and just a tad on the dry side. Taste is a little short lived, mostly located mid palate to the finish is where most of the flavors decide to take effect with a slight sharp grassy hop bitterness with citrus and wood poking around the edges. Malts come through light but present with a dryness of paper. Not all that appetizing to me for some reason, it picks up some strange notes of iced tea, watery cola, and cardboardish things as it warms. Feel is alright I guess, weakened front, thin and a tad watery, but the middle and finish gain some slight fullness and smudges of hopped bitterness and some light dryness fading off, but the thin/watery feel seems to stay within through out the stint of each sip and/or gulp. Nothing to get excited about here, slightly better then average for an ESB, but not by much in my book."
"The brew was a hazy amber color with a big old white head. The aroma of the beer has a lot of different smells going on, the oneÂ’s that I can pick out are citrus, butterscotch and a strong sense of floral hops. The taste is all about the hops, hops and more hops! Also has some nice flavors of malt, fruit and spice. Over all a nice beer, just not one of my favorites!"
"Char"
"Pours an orange amber color that is quite hazy and almost opeuque. The head almost didn't exist. There was a clean grassy smell with subtle hints of sweetness. The taste was very much on the bready side with mild grain and hop tastes. It was also semi sweet. The aftertaste had a bitter kick to it. A good beer, but nothing to wow anyone."
"A hazy peach with an impressive off-white white head that sticks around. Aroma is a nice blend of piney/grassy hops and diacetyl. Taste is pleasing and rather complex. Grassy and earthy hops that are slightly spicy. A sweetness appears to be there from the bready malt and the buttery diacetyl, but the finish is definitely bitter. Feel is smooth with a slight hop prickle. Very solid and drinkable. I wish this was local to me, I would drink it all of the time."
"Pours a amber color with a thick head. Lacing was produced during the first half of the drink. The aroma was hoppy and sweet. The carbonation seemed lighter than normal. The flavor was as expected, a bitter brew that pleases the palette. The malt and hops were nicely balanced. The mouthfeel was somewhat dry and had a very minor metallic finish. Bitterness lasted a bit into the aftertaste. Very drinkable - a pure session beer."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Fairly creamy. Medium-bodied. Mild puckering effect from the bitterness. Drinkable, but not one that I'd put on my ""must have again"" list."
"Drinkability: Classic British-style ESB. Well done."
"Pours medium golden peach, with a medium white head that races to recede leaving just a small coating of bubbles, laces is mostly non-existent. Aroma is apple, caramel, some hops, and a bunch of butterscotch. Flavor is a bit fruity, strong butterscotch, and ends with a decent bitter and spicy hoppiness. Medium bodied, quite dry ending."
"A good bitter and fairly drinkable."
"Huge thanks to the great McCall for the chance to drink this one!"
"The Beast Bitter pours a light amber color with a slight orange hue, kind of like a dark iced tea. The head dissapeared really quick, but there's still a bunch of bubbles rising up from the bottom. It would have been fun to watch if I had used a chalice. The smell is of flowery hops. I really dig the taste, the hops are there but don't leave a bitter aftertaste, but the ringwood yeast is there to mellow everything out. All in all a good beer like all Middle Ages brews, definitely give it a try if you're in Central New York."
"Reading the label, I was thinking that this might be one of those overly hopped american style ""bitters", which really just seem like another excuse to make an IPA. I'm happy to say it's very british in style, all the way down to the hops. with a decent malty balance"
"Deep orange color with cream colored head. This beer has a lemon/lime hop aroma with a hint of butterscotch and caramel. Flavorwise it starts out caramel malt sweet and lemony hop bitter. A good balance is found in a light to medium body. It finishes dry and nicely bitter. A very drinkable bitter."
"The beer pours a golden color with a lacey white head; good carbonation. The aroma is sweet with Ringwood yeast and light crystal malts. Maybe munich or vienna malts are used in this one to account for malt flavor and aroma without a dark lovibond. The taste is good. There is that maltiness about it with a medium to heavy bitter aftertaste. This is a medium bodied beer that goes down smooth. A good session beer. I'm not usually an ESB fan, but this is one that I could have a few of and enjoy."
"A down-and-dirty session ale to be sure; I think that most of the flavors being understated but complex somehow allow the yeast to not become annoying here."
"If you see this brew on cask, I challenge you to pull yourself away from it. Dangerous."
"Medium bodied with subdued carbonation gives this a caskesque feel. This would be beautiful served via the real deal."
"Pours a near perfect head and a is a beautiful copper color. Smells a little sweet, but rich. Very smooth taste. There's a slight berry taste to cut the edge. Feels like a litle celebration in my mouth. The taste has a lot of staying power, but is very drinkable particially because of this. It's a good aftertaste and you want to update it."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Easy drinking and no high ABV to get in the way of having a few of these."
"Clear amber color topped by a nice off-white head with good retention. Lacing was thicker at the bottom of the glass. Aroma was faintly floral and did not offer hints as to what was in store. A tart citrusy hoppy taste hit me and it was very pleasing. Grapefruit came to mind, nice mouthfeel, and very refreshing. A very drinkable bitter and one I was able to try complements of McCall."
"Hops are definitely the dominator in this brew. They are not at the peak of hop intensity, but they are surely there and in numbers. The label says not for the faint of heart, but I think many people could handle this one. It is nice and crisp and very drinkable. The spiciness is deliteful. A nice medium body is as full as I could imagine for the style. This one is a fine brew that makes me look forward to more by Middle Ages. I would welcome the Beast into my company any day."
"Appearance of a typical American PA: somewhat hazy copper color with persistent very thin layer of constant foam-carpet. Smell was fresh and of slight hoppyness; no grain or malt aroma that I could tell. Taste was crisp and nicely balanced: Neither over- nor under-hopped for its style, neither over- or under-sweet. Typical of what I think of as a bitter, only bottled and brewed in Syracuse, NY. Agreed, the label and the name may lead to fool hop-heads: This is no ultra-IBU beer, nor IPA nor even American PA, just a bottled American bitter. This is a good beer that I think can be multi-sampled, even along with other beers."
"Picked this up thinking that it would be a heavily hopped brew. Wrong. Typical golden/orange pale ale color. Thin head. Faint hop and malt aromas. Very faint hop taste and shallow almost scorched malt taste. A little thin on the palate. Not very satisfying on the whole. If they are going to compete in the hop monster category they're going to have to do a whole lot better than this. The name, the cute label and the misleading allusion to hop bitterness might draw the customer in initially but it won't get a second chance among most hopheads."
"Pours a medieval copper under a quality, gluey head. Bouquet of an orchard alternating blooming citrus and almond trees. Flavor full of toasty pine nuts, earthy lingering hops, balanced and tasty, smooth and drainable. Quality English style brew from Syracuse."
"I found this to be a very tasty and drinkable bitter that rivals the hoppy IPA's that are out there. My only regret is that I don't live close close enough to NY to get some more once my six pack is gone."
"The pour murky deep golden amber color with a magnanimous head, frothy in texture, and the left over lace a nice thick covering sheet. Hints of the hop flower, big on the malts, crisp and fresh and pleasant enough with the front ambrosial, the top skinny. Finish is bitingly acidic and the hops top notch in their spiciness, dry lingering aftertaste and a quite decent ""ESB""."
"Orange amber, full head that recedes but does not vanish. A very tasty, crisp ale from Middle Ages that is quite subdued despite its hoppiness. There is a slight apple tartness upfront that fades into prolonged sweet caramel flavor, and lastly a dry crispness to round it off. A little bit of soap in the aftertaste. The qualities of a traditional bitter are present and built upon quite successfully with citric, lemony hops. Ends up being bolder than most bitters but a bit thinner than most American pale ales. Nice middle ground. A good beer, spritzy, not too flavorful which makes for fine session drinking."
"Amber-orange in color with a fluffy white head that holds OK, then drops to a thin collar. The aroma displays a lightly fruity and caramel maltiness beneath bold piney hops. The body is medium with a fine, moderate carbonation from bottle conditioning that gently caresses the tongue and becomes creamy in the mouth as it warms. Very English in character. The flavor expresses an excellent combination of bready maltiness with a gently sweet caramel character and piney/lightly grassy hop flavors. Some light diacetyl helps to round and soften - it's well integrated and unobtrusive. Actually quite nice. Some fruitiness appears towards the swallow along with a firm bitterness. It finishes with a mild lingering bitterness and some sticky residual caramel maltiness, as well as some more pine-like hop flavor and mild diacetyl. It's not a strong aftertaste, but it is long lasting. Very nice. A really enjoyable pint that seems to express itself best at closer to cellar temperature. Well done."
"A Bighuge thanks to Pbrian for the sample."
"Pours a hazy, golde, orange color with a sticky tan head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  The brew has a subtle diacetyl tilt to it that goes nicely with the bicuity malt aromas and subtle bittering hops.  Smooth toasty malt from start to finish with some hoppy spikes in bitterness throughout.  The hops have the citrus/piney flavor that is a definite reminder that this is brewed in the US.  The brewfinishes with a quick flurry of diacetyl before leaving a nice bitter hoppy taste lingering on the tongue.  Nicely smooth on the tongue with a mediumd body to it this is one very drinkable brew that I would love to find on cask some day."
"This was a nice, crisp, hoppy bitter.  The Ringwood character was much tamer than the Grail Ale, or it was balanced better with the hops.  Either way, a fine beer, maybe a tad thin."
"This beer poured a light amber color.  It formed a huge sudsy perfect head.  Nice carbonation present.  It had an aroma of hops and citrus.  The flavor was somewhat sweet, with elements of hops and some fruitiness present.  The finish was a touch bitter and astrigent.  Another fine beer from Middle Ages."
"It is a nicely hopped ale to be sure.Somewhat light and spritzy for the style,but interesting.Real easy to drink."
"A fine, not so ordinary bitter from Middle Ages. Nicely hopped, balanced and flavorful. One of MA best offerings. Don't miss an opportunity to try this beer cask conditioned."
