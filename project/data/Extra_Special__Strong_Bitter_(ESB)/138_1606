The aroma has loads of toffee and caramel, also notes of malts, fruits and bakery. The flavour is nutty with plenty of caramel, some fruity sweetness, and a distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is noticeable. Original rating: (500 ml bottle). Kentish strong ale of golden brown colour, good head, malty aroma with caramel and oak.

The taste is equally satisfying: moderately dry, but with plenty of malt goodness in the flavor. There's a steady bitterness that settles in a quarter of the way through the mid-taste.

The colour, though, is beautiful clear, clean copper with a creamy head that hung around leaving fine lacing. I must be olfactorily challenged because I am weak on aromas so I didn't get what other reviewers said. It's toasty and malty with a hoppy lift but I just can't pick any more detail than that. On the flavour side I found a perfectly balanced malt and hop; toasty again and a bit metallic back of the palate. I love the bitterness. Just right and great length with a lip-smacking finish. I must confess to being an ESB noob so I can't really compare with many others but I like this a lot.","rjimlad","Apr 06, 2007"
3.82,4.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This is an English bitter with some attitude and unconventional hopping. This clear coppery ale maintains a white head that leaves lace behind. The hops are rather interesting, going beyond the usual Fuggles and Goldings into some more mineral-like notes. The yeast has a decided fruity flavor to it that carries into the aroma as well. The taste is quite heavy with biscuity malt and hop flavors. For only 5+% ABV, it is quite full-bodied. A second or third bottle would be most welcome, but it does not fall into the realm of the truly sessionable.","MillRat","Feb 14, 2007"

This was a very disapointing, watery beer. The fact that it did lack any body may result in this being a decent all night beer, but not for me, I didn't even finish the bottle.","kmacphail","Mar 22, 2006"
3.65,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Appearence well intact: nice looking bottle, good colour and proper head. Foam stuck around and would leave good lacing. Shinning ruby-brown colour. Aroma is Kent hops. Could be stronger, especially considering the lovely scent these hops lend. Mouthfeel in the same manner, that is to say, developed and good character but somewhat restrained. Like it's trying to be too well mannered. Flavour is light buttery texture, some nutty notes. High-Medium bodied, some bitterness. The Kent malt makes up the majority of flavour. Tasty with satisfying finish. However, flavours seem to trail off. Taste kinda falls apart and really wears thin near the end. Carbonation is decent, but I think this would be better on tap. This is very much within the British manner, a beer full of character but still mild mannered and more concerned with being quaffable than bold or distinct.","biegaman","Mar 21, 2006"

Aroma has an earthy base to it with a floral edge and caramel maltiness. Seems quite balanced and quite nice. Taste follows suit but adds more of a fruity character, apples and bananas. A slight buttery flavor comes with the earthyness from the yeast. There is a slight mineral flavor which rides along the whole time. The hops are always there, floral and fragrant, but they never really come out and shine. Finish is drying, a bit citric, with a slight english toffee sweetness. Well balanced and smooth. The hops and malts and yeast work nicely here. Enjoyable but not the most complex or intriguing beer out there. Still, I definitely recommend trying it.","granger10","Mar 04, 2006"

3.79,3.8,4,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Good session beer. I'll buy a few cases of it next time. Bishops Finger pours a dark, wooden red colour. Stained mahogany? A huge, fluffy head appears that slowly disipated to about a half finger thickness. Still, thick and creamy, leaving lace down the sides of the glass. The smell, at first, is awful. Clear bottle, skunked beer. And this was a terribly skunked beer. However, after a few minutes of air, the skunk smell died down(or my nose grew accustomed), and I could smell the beer. Caramel, toffee, malts, sugar and flowery, herbal hops. The skunk smell was still their, but not nearly as dominant as that first initial sniff. The smell is probably worthy of a higher score, but because of the skunk smell, I must take it down a point. The taste is excellent! Light, nicely balanced, and a perfect blend of sweet and dryness. It almost tastes like caramel and honey spread over whole grain toast. Their is also a dry, herbal and flower taste in the end. And, because of it's light taste, I'd consider it a perfect session beer. Lightly carbonated, smooth mouthfeel. Definitely drinkable. As stated above, I must buy this by the case.","slitherySOB","Nov 24, 2004"

Modest head but good lacing...fairly pungent aromas of fruit ( apricot) over a musty burlap undertone. Good malt spine of caramel malts upfront but it is quickly ballanced off by resinous pine-like hops that continue to get increasingly bitter until the finish where they leave a lasting metalic after taste....this is a quality bitter but these styles of ale are not my favorite so that bias may explain my overall rating....it reflects my impression that this brew has nothing unique to distinguish itself in this style.","pootz","Aug 15, 2004"

Even the clear glass bottle didn't seem to effect the situation as I poured this beautiful clear copper liquid into my pint glass. A nice off-white contoured head built to just a bit more than a finger before settling at about one centimeter, which deposited some nice lace rings as the liquid descended. There's a nice strong malty nose with an enticing touch of flowery hops. The mouth is prickly and heavy. There's a good crisp malty opening, followed by a full hoppy bitterness that leaves a nice fresh aftertaste. Thanks, I needed that!","Globetrotter","Oct 27, 2003"
