review_text
"Pours a clear, copper color.  2/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and good lacing.  Smells of caramel malt, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, hint of earthy malt, hint of yeast, slight hops, hint of tea, and a hint of sugar.  Fits the style of an Extra Special / Strong Bitter.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of earthy malt, caramel malt, sweet malt, hint of pale malt, slight subtle hops, and a hint of yeast."

"Nice tasting, but nothing special."
"Not good at all. Had a strange metallic taste to it. Aroma was decent, but completely fell apart when I tasted it."
"O: nice, balanced ale. Well done."

"This was an interesting beer. I don't think this tastes like other ESBs that I've tried. It pours nicely into a SA Perfect Pint and displays some head and lacing but when I tried it with a Nonic there was virtually no head and no lacing, The color is amber with a hint of orange. The taste and aroma are hard to describe but I would lean toward earthy. I will say that I enjoyed the beer. It seems to be a nice transition to the fall for me although I would prefer a slightly darker color."

"I would love to know the story behind both the beer’s name and its label, but it was time for more important things, like the Crack! I love a brimful CAN and when this one revealed itself, I was ready to go. I initiated an inverted Glug, leading to a near-rebellious two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. I sat back as the battle raged, sticky lacing appearing in the wake of the fighting. Rebellion should not be without casualties. The first rule of The CANQuest ™ is to talk about The CANQuest ™. Color was a slightly hazy Amber (SRM = 7.3, thanks to the brewery for providing that bit of 411). Nose had a grassy honey-sweetness that really put me more in mind of a lager. Mouthfeel was medium and although I was still getting that honey flavor, it was accompanied by an earthy maltiness and an intensely grassy hoppiness (IBU = 42). Holy rebelliousness! I CAN drink this all day!  The grassy bitterness was offset nicely by the biscuit maltiness on the tongue. It was on the finish that it really came together, though. It was like summer in the country with biscuits and honey after mowing the grass. I really am a fan of this one and wish that it were more widely available."
"A big shout out to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bready, a bit of hops. Taste is also bready, some caramel sweetness, a touch of hops is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while I am not a big fan of this style, this beer was tasty and enjoyable."
"If need be, I'll revise the review."

"O- I will be trying the rest of what French Broad has to offer. The regular IPA was twice, if not more-so, as bitter as the 13 Rebels so it begs the question what has French Broad done with the rest of their brews? For the record, though, I would buy this again for sure."

"o - one of my favorite ESBs and i think this is FB's best beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was sweet, malty and fruity. There was a breadiness to this Bitter but a bit of apple, plum and sweetness that really caught my eye. Not a bad example of the genre but perhaps a bit to bubbly for my liking."
"O: Easy to drink, with a nice flavor and a low ABV - a little sweeter than other offerings in the style but definitely one to try (or have again)."
""
""
""
"Overall a very good and balanced ale."
""
"O: Overall this is plenty drinkable. Tasty, and interesting though I don't think I am in love with the flavor, there is almost a light licorice character to it that seems out of place to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, it's a very solid beer. Plenty of flavor, good balance, nothing overpowering. Fun lacing, too."
""
""
"O= not one I'd go out of my way to find. Given to me by a friend from Asheville, a random pick at the store, a much-appreciated effort."
"The beer pours a golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of citrus, with some orange and lemon notes. There is also a strong biscuit malt component. The flavor is fairly malt heavy, with both biscuit and toffee. There is also some bitter orange character and a little bit of bitterness. Easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"The mouthfeel was medium to thin. Mild carbonation. Smooth in the mouth. A pretty solid ESB."
""
""
"O - a decent esb to try, though not very complex."
""
"Overall: Not bad at all. A bit heavier body would make it nicer, but again, not bad. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This in my opinion was a pretty mediocre beer. It's one dimensional and that one dimension was burnt toast. The hops were noticeable but were unable to tame the intense malt character. I probably won't have this again."
""
""
"Overall an OK ESB"

"O - Kind of wish it was a little bit more bold but definitely a tasty super drinkable brew"
"O: 13 Rebels ESB is not a bad effort. In fact, it displays many of the classic traits of English ESBs. Unfortunately, the lack of head retention and the lack of a heavier hop profile are not forgivable. In the end, it's not bad, but not great either."
"O: Pretty decent ESB but not spectacular. That being said I would gladly have a few of these."
"A good example of the style, not a heavily hopped Americanized version. Good stuff. I had several bombers of this over several days."
"and would add this to my ""must try list"""
"o - overall, this is a style that has been growing on me and this one is pretty decent and worth checking out if you are into the style. mostly malty and spicey, nothing crazy. checking through other reviews, my overcarbonated bottle seems to be an anomaly."
"A pretty decent ESB… It’s no Rye Hopper, but not too shabby"
"This beer poured copper and was average in appearance. It had a very bitter feeling throughout. As described by a friend also drinking this brew, it has the qualities that you crave in an IPA…minus the sweetness and syrup qualities. I really like this beer as a session choice. It was an easy to drink medium bodied bitter beer that provoked continuous sipping. It is a great beer, and great for the style."
"An alright ESB, a few pronounced flaws hold this one back"
"Overall: a decent easy drinking ESB. Nothing to blow you away but it hits the spot. A few of these can be consumed in a session."
"I may not be getting too deep into details, but this tasted really good - a hoppier version of the ESB. Great color, great taste. It really made folding the laundry, doing the dishes, and making lunches for the kids go smoothly. Overall, I would say that you will enjoy this and be happy. It's the golden age of American brewing!"
"D: The beer is easy to drink because of its low alcohol content; the sweetness provides for an interesting taste."
"13 Rebels ESB is pretty solid; certainly an easy sipper. The reasonable abv is appreciated, too."
"The palate opens with a blend of the moderate malt sweetness and a rather big hop character. As with the nose, the hop character just isn't to my liking. Moderately soapy, intensely earthy, almost mineral-like, this is very, very green. Bitterness is on the lower side of medium, there's an almost resiny hop character here. Grain and yeast are secondary here, especially the latter. Medium-light in body with fairly high carbonation, this finishes with plenty of hop flavor on the finish. Decent, though not particularly enjoyable."
"22oz. bottle courtesy of BucketBoy. Pours a translucent copper with a quarter inch, loose, cream-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually dissipates into a cluster of foam around the edges of the glass. Thick slashes of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose suggests toasted, light malt with a trace of fruit. Taste expresses quite a but of grain - somewhat close to a sour mash flavor, but not quite. It's also slightly tart with perhaps a trace of caramel malt and a light lingering bitterness between quaffs. The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer. Consistency is medium-light with a pleasant carbonation and a semi-dry finish. A decent ESB. Not my favorite example of the style, but quite respectable nonetheless."
"Overall impression: Really like the malt profile, but really would love to see an injection of earthy and leafy hop goodness."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable E.S.B."
"Drain pour after a few sips... Not what I was hoping for here...."
"Notes: Well, definitely leaning British heavily, but it seems like it might not be so fresh... Ah, well. Decent beer, but not great."
"Had this one on cask at The Borough during Raleigh Beer Week, dry hopped with Cluster hops. Served in a standard pint glass a very murky dark orange with a thin diminishing head. The aroma was a nice amount of floral hops with sweet malts noticeable as well. The taste was a very nice balance of sweet caramel malts, Earthy mild citrus hops and a dash of sweet fruits. The beer is very well balanced, smooth, and enjoyable. As much as enjoy a good hoppy cask IPA, like the 2 Hearted cask I tried the other day, this is what cask beer is truly all about!"
"D: Not a bad beer but the toasted aspect of the malt needs toned down to allow more bitter hoppiness to at least pull even in the aroma and flavor departments."
"Pours a cloudy dark copper color, tons of carbonation, HUGE foamy off-white head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty with lots of caramel, and some spice notes. The taste is malty, slight spice note, and some caramel. Medium body. Not Drinkable, would not seek out again. Very dissappointed in this brew."
"All in all it is a decent beer, not outstanding, but decent. So far my least favorite of the French Broad beers that I have had"
"The taste is very watery with just a little bitter. This is very boring."
"Overall, I was disappointed. I thought it would be much hoppier. Honestly, it tasted a lot like Fat Tire. I would pass on drinking this again unless there were no better options."
"Not very impressed here...definitely a lot of flavors happening, but they all tend to clash with each other. I've had any number of better ESBs."
"This is the second time I've had this, the first time was a few years ago out of a growler, and this time its out of a bomber. Pours a hazy brown/copper. Thin head. Smells faintly like sweet malt and caramel. Earthy flavors from the hops are very prominent with a warming sweetness and mild alcohol. Fairly malt forward and really on target for the style I think. I feel like a lot of other breweries overhop their bitters, which doesn't really make sense to me. This ones an exception."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber. Beers pours a hazy dark golden color with a 2 finger head. The nose has malt, fruity esters, and some hops. Taste has upfront malt with some background notes of banana and apple. The backbone of this beer is a delicate hop flavor, that is not overly aggresive. The mouth is nice with a medium level of carbination. A good and very drinkable ESB."
"D - moar plox. very enjoyable E.S.B. hits the style on a sweet note. worth sharing."
"D - Very high. Can be paired with anything and consumed all day and night."
"Very, very good beer! I can see how this would not appeal to everyone, it's unique & quite a bit off the beaten path. I'll be sad to see this glass go, & it's moving off at quite a pace."
"Nothing horrible, but nothing outstanding either. It has maybe suffered from a little too much time on the shelf, but I think there's more to it than that. Worth a try."
"French Broad Brewing is a credit to the state of North Carolina. That said, 13 Rebels ESB is not one of their better efforts and is not a beer that I would buy a second time. Coming at it from a different direction, most craft breweries would kill to have a 'worst beer' that's this good."
"Drinkability: A worthy attempt at the style and an okay, perfectly drinkable beer. Personally, I'd prefer a slightly bigger body and greater inclusion of caramel flavor, but, again, that's just me."
"Comes out of the bottle a clear coppery amber with a decent but not very persistent light tan head. Aroma is mainly malty with a good hoppy undertone and just a hint of apples and yeast. Flavor is malty with a good bitter undertone, not complex but still satisfactory. Texture is fairly smooth and a little fizzy. Not too shabby."
"Actually pretty nice, no over powering characteristic to turn you off. Easy drinking, fairly simplistic but complex enough to enjoy. IMHO, I believe this would be an enjoyable session beer."
"M/D - There is a pretty good amount of bite on the tongue from this one, but relatively low in carbonation which confuses me. Overall though very easy to drink. This would be a great beer to have on hand as an ""everyday"" beer, good but nothing special."
"This is a pretty good ESB and I'm glad I got the chance to try it."
"Not bad, but nothing special either."
"It's hoppier than a traditional ESB, so it's definitely an American version. It's no substitute for a nice Fuller's, but at only $4 a bomber, it's a nice alternative."
"Hmmm. Well, this is definitely an American style ESB. There is the typical nuttiness and dry biscuity malt, but also far more hoppiness than usual for the style. That being said, it works here. Unlike Ding, I won't be hung up on the style parameters here and simply enjoy the beer for what it is. Pouurs a nice coppery color, but the head fades a little too quickly. Nice slightly nutty aromas with some of that biscuity malt and some earthy/spicy hops. The taste, to my mind, nicely balances the classic ESB flavors with a nice, and surprising, jolt of hops. They by no means dominate the beer, but merely add another dimension and take the beer into a more indeterminate style. Good carbonation, and a very nice drink."
"The aroma is odd for the style. It is grassy and paper like with some biscuits, fruit, and yeast. The appearance is deep gold with an amber hue and a large head. The flavor is like the aroma and astringent. The palate is thin. Overall this beer has some good qualities but the negative ones bury them."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer - it doesn't go very far off of the path of a traditional ESB, but where it does it succeeds."
"This is a decent, slightly-hopped-up ESB that I quite enjoyed. Thanks Ding!"
"D - With the low ABV and mild flavor, I could put away several at a sitting. Nothing amazing with respect to the flavor or aroma, but this is a solid ESB that I'll likely buy again."
"Pours copper/read, with a moderately sized head. The bubbles are loose and fades to a thin head quickly. There is some decent retention and lacing, but it looks just about right. It smells of sweet malts, but lacks a real hop aroma. There is a bit of earthiness, and a tiny bit of a floral character. The taste is nice and sweet, like golden raisins. A bit of toffee and caramel but not overpowering. Not much in terms of buscuity flavors. Minimal bitterness, with an earthy spiciness. Nice and balanced without a hint of alcohol. No estery flavors. Good burst of carbonation, but not incredibly full. Very easy drinker. Even at 5.2%, I could see myself going through quite a few of these. I really enjoyed having it and would revisit it if the price were right."
"D- Pretty decent, though not great, ESB."
"Overall it was decent, ok maybe, but nothing i would really go after again anytime soon. I have had worse though, and much better as well if I am being honest."
"Pretty thin on the body; too thin. Finishes really dry as well. Extraordinarily ordinary. Nothing special here."
"Not a terrific beer, 13 Rebels keeps plugging away and before you know it, the whole bomber is gone. Not a great ESB, but you could do much worse."
"Drinkability: A very nice, crisp, well-balanced beer. North Carolina is a craft beer haven, and if they keep pumping out beers like this, they'll remain one for years to come. What a lawnmower beer should be."
"Medium body with active carbonation. The bubbles help create a foamy, creamy feel on the tongue. This bomber is going down quicker than I imagined. I wouldn't hesitate to get this again...especially if I found it on-tap. Maybe a fresh one from the tap would improve the smell rating."
"The flavor is much like the aroma: underwhelming. It does get tastier after a few bites of food, however. Some grainy, breaded malts and a mineral note reminiscent of sourdough give way to a bit of sweet fruity esthers from the yeast that add pear and mango. Finishes very dry and bitter. All in all, a fairly unimpressive beer. Goes down easily, but there aren't many memorable or distinguishing qualities."
"Slight haze, light copper colour with a thin skim of fine bubbles and a soapy ring from a hard pour. Spotty stickage, good retention for what's there. Fruity aroma with a fair bit of floral/spicy hops, quite malty and toasty. Bitterness sat just underneath the fruity character, malt sweetness provided balance mid-palate. Slightly bready, more toasty though, with an earthy quality. Medium bodied, average carbonation, decent texture with a bit of pop from the CO2 but not enough to overpower the mouthfeel. Good stuff overall, quite drinkable and nicely balanced."
"Nicely balanced and lightly carbonated, 13 Rebels is exceptionally smooth beer on the fullish side of medium-bodied, and an easy drinker to boot."
"M/D: Pretty good mouthfeel. Carbonation is there, medium body that feels a little velvety. Pretty good drinkability as well. Aside from the aroma, this is a pretty good beer."
"Poured for a 22oz bottle into pint glass. Color is dark gold, clear, decent lacing and a very malty smell. Taste was ok but not that impressed, all malt taste with hardly any noticeable hops...not that bitter either. Had a very sharp and not pleasant taste that almost makes me think I got a bad bottle. Might try again if at a tasting but not impressed enough to spend $5 for a 22oz bottle."
"French Broad ESB is nothing extravagant, but a solid brew nonetheless."
"Not that special of a beer."
"*Note to self: revisit Blue Point's ESB...seems light years ahead of any in recent memory."
"Drinkability: Very nice flavor profile, although closer to a Best Bitter than an ESB; could stand a bit more malt and hops to take it to the next level"
"The boys and I poured this ESB from the growler into the souvenier mini-pilsners from the Brewgrass Festival the day before. It poured a golden hue with a tad of oranginess to it. Tons of head but I think that this was due in part to the mini glasses that we were werving them in. However the head did hang around for a good amount of time. This was the first ESB I had ever tried so I'm not totally sure if it was 100% true to its characteristics. Overall though it had a great mouthfeel and a good maltiness to it with very sweet overtones. Not much on the aroma side but did have a distinct hop character in it flavor."
"($9.99 / Growler)"
"Served on tap in a standard pint glass @ Union Jack's English pub. A: Light cuperic orange with mild carbonation and light head, but decent lacing. S: Not a lot there very mild, light malts with a few finishing hops and florals. T: A mild ESB that doesn't overly disappoint nor impress, a little light in the ass compared to what I usually expect from an ESB. This isn't a bad beer, just nothing too memorable."
"Pours a light orangish amber with a massive head and good lacing. Smells very feint of anything at all. I was reviewing this beer in a smoke free bar as well and I still could barely detect any scent at all. Taste is watery with the flavor of spice and wheat. Somewhat bitter but mostly just watery mouthfeel. Overall nothing I would order on a regular basis. Perhaps trying from a bottle might change my opinion."
"This is one of the staples at the Federal, and on the first real nice weekend in Durham this spring, I couldn't help but give this a try while taking in the good weather out on their patio. It poured a light golden body with no head to speak of. It did, however, leave good lacing about the glass. The smell was of honey and possibly some hops but everything was very muted and mild. The taste was extreme on the hops, both bittering and floral up front. Honey, some malts and alcohol followed which faded into a pleasant semi-sweet finish. The mouthfeel was bitter at first with a very smooth aftertaste, mild carbonation and a good round semi-sweetness that tied things together well. Overall a very drinkable local brew and a great way to enjoy a lazy afternoon."
"Pours a bright golden color. Small fading white head that leaves a rim of white lace on the top of the glass. Smells fruity and bitter in a citrus way. Taste is very mild up front and then the bitterness hits you in the back. The malts balance the bitterness out well. It leaves a citrus aftertaste. Feels very good in the mouth with a very nice mild burn and bite on the palate. It's a very drinkable ESB. ESB is not one of my prefered styles, but I could drink a few of these. One of the more balanced ESB's that I've tried."
"This is a very good ESB. Poured with a small head. The color is a very cloudy orangish yellow. The beer had a citrus like bitter smell. The taste was very hoppy. I also detected citrus in the taste. It is a very smooth beer for the style. A very drinkable beer. My growler did not make it through the night. Probably my favorite beer from French Broad. I will have it again. Top of the style in my book."
"A good ESB. Very clean and easy on the palate. Aromas are bready and biscuity on the malts end and pleasantly herbal and floral from hopping. Color is solid copper with moderate carbonation and and off white persistant head that laced well. Tastes biscuity and toasty without becoming yeasty. Mildly grassy and piney with a floral, spicy roundness to the taste. The body is medium but softens (without weakening) into the finish, leaving a pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Very clean brew."
"Pint at Speakeasy in Carrboro, NC."
"Pours a deep golden color with a nice, fluffy white head. Floral aroma of hops with a touch of spiciness. Up front, the palate is almost more like a Belgian ale, with notes of allspice and fresh hops. Finishes very smoothly, with a biscuity malt character that mellows out very nicely. Nice, full-bodied mouthfeel. Interesting, but not quite interesting enough for me to stick with it for a session."
"Had this before the Pop the Cap event over at Barleys Taproom yesterday.Pours really light for an ESB I think,a lighter copper shade with not much head to speak of,aroma of fruity malt with a touch of caramel.Taste hit the style better than the appearance nice biscuit malt and big fruitiness with a touch of hop to let u know its there.A decent rendition of an ESB,I have had better but this was solid."
"Notes: A good beer, nice flavors that seem to lead your tongue in different directions. A pleasant mouthfeel makes this beer an easy one to drink."
"Pours a cloudy dark golden color with very little head. There was a little bit of lace on the glass as I drank it. Smell is slightly fruity and flowery. Taste was a nice biscuity malt followed by a slight sourness and a nice dry hoppy finish, which was slightly herbal and flowery. Mouthfeel was medium body with a nice amount of carbonation. This beer seemed pretty easy to drink. I suppose I would have another."
