4,42.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Foster's Premium Ale brewed by Foster's Group Limited, with an ABV of 5.50%  This brew pours out a deep amber color with a nice white head. I like the color of this brew.  The smell is rich with grains , malts, and sweetness. You pick up on a hit of hops at the end. Now for the taste it is bold, but rich with flavor. Foster's Premium Ale, has a nice sweetness to it. There is a lot going on in this brew.  I think this is one of the better Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB). Foster's Group Limited did a nice job with this one. There is nothing overpowering in Foster's Premium Ale. This brew has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice rich and bold. I like how this brew goes down smooth.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Mar 24, 2015"

The smell is not so good, but everything else is rather better than I would have expected from the price ($2.50 for an oilcan where I live, and that's from a grocery store).

Pours out to a decent 1 inch head that falls to a permanent yet thin head with minimal lacing. Color is admittedly artificial caramel color added to give this ersatz ESB a golden-amber hue. Aroma is classic Foster's lager with bready notes and grassy hops and loud grains. Flavor is musty, crackery, and strangely boozy with a dry, honey graham cracker finish (don't ask me to explain).

Though no longer brewed in Australia and imported (a few years back they switched to ""inspired"" breweries in Georgia and Texas) the taste is more or less the same. Thick creamy head mellows to good lacing. Straw colored with a hint of ruby. Light airy aroma. Barely there. Soft smooth mouthfeel. Caramel front taste. Malty bread. Wafts into coppery ale midtaste and then finished with a bitter ale finish. Sour and bitter notes linger. Slight copper and just a hint of hops spice. Very drinkable. Good hot day, hot night drink. Clean Aussie ale taste. It's Lager cousin comes in the blue can (this is green). The ""oil can"" supersized beer makes you feel manly. It's a marketing ploy, but I'll bite into it-- just has that feel or ""real beer"" though it is arguably the Budweiser of Australia. Either way, as a commodity drink it is enjoyable and just right for this time of year despite its middle of the road quality. 3.25 out of 5. Good.","digitalflood","Jun 13, 2013"

First sip brings a sharp metallic bitterness, almost Saaz hops like, with a mild malty backbone, and a strong bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent, not heavy or watery. Overall, for a mass produced beer, this is well...decent.

It was not quite as balanced as the Wells ESB I had last night, but it was not bad, either.

4.24,50.9,4,5,4,4,4,"Update: I've gone back after over a year of further beer drinking experience and had to lower my score a bit. It is still a surprising gem considering the presentation. In my area, it is sold only in 25.4 oz single cans alongside budget beers and malt liquors, though for a slightly higher price tag. I've still never seen it available in 6-packs. It is many many times better than Foster's Lager could ever hope to be as well. However, it does have shortcomings. It tastes very very fake. While the astringency may taste perfect, it doesn't taste like it's necessarily imparted by hops. It could just as well be some artificial chemical bittering agent. I'm really picky about hops getting too up-front with their own flavour (and masking the beer's), so this doesn't bother me too much. The malt flavour is sort of oddly fake too, though. The sweetness, while once again in the perfect amount tastes oddly of red grapes just a wee bit, which makes no sense in a beer. I still don't find that offensive, but both of those things combined just makes this beer reek of fake flavours and a lack of freshness. However, I stand by my original proclamation that this is by no means a bad beer and for the price, is totally worth it every time. It is really a gem in the budget beer isle. I challenge you to give it a try.","ElCommodoro","Apr 15, 2011"

It smells grainy with a hint of floral. The taste is just this oily fake caramel taste with the sharp hops. It tastes like a fake Boston Lager.... but in no way does this compare to that quality beer. I would rate this double if it weren't for this odd taste that beer shouldn't have. It has a mouthfeel that you can tell is off.

2.72,-3.2,2.5,3,3,2.5,2,"Aroma is fine. Sweet bread pudding upfront, ever so slight tinge of hops at the end. Flavor at first was reviling! It was a bit strange to me. A light bitter hop that hits and dies instantly followed by a ton of maltiness. It's not overly complex, but I can taste some bit of fruitiness in the middle. Finishes very sweet, almost cloying. Mouthfeel is a bit off. Sort of a strange aftertaste that lingers after the sip. I don't think this beer is very drinkable. There is no way I could drink more that one of these things.","ahking","Aug 20, 2008"

3.43,22.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"The mouthfeel is kind of interesting. There is a moderate bitterness with a slightly numbing quality to it. Despite the poor scent and questionable additions, this beer is not impossible to drink. In fact it gets easier as you get closer to the bottom of the glass. Combine that with a low price and this is a great beer to get the party started.","jbphoto88","Jun 08, 2008"
3.06,8.9,4,3,3,3,3,"Overall, an OK beer. It has more flavor than the big-name American brews, but there is so much better beer out there. Go for one of the English or American ESBs instead.","Shaw","Beers"
3.46,23.1,3,2,4,3,4.5,"D- there are already 2 beers called ""foster's special bitter"" and although this is definitely a bitter, the can is different from the other pics and the abv is way higher. this can says premium ale AND special bitter, and the reviews from the others do not do this beer justice, therefore leading me to believe this is a different beer and that's why i'm adding it. just seems strange that foster's would brew 3 different ESBs but at 2.5%, 3.5%, and 5.5%, i suppose i could see the sense in that. or the session, so to speak. all in all a very surprising brew from a big ass can that quenched my thirst and left me wishing this was on tap at a local bar. IMO the only thing lacking is the aroma.","hustlesworth","0"
