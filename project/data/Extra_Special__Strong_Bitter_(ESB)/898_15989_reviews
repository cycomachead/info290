"Better on tap than out of the bottle. Pours a pretty light brown"
"I actually enjoyed this beer fairly well, just not sure if you were looking for a standard ESB if this would fit.  Also, not being overly versed in the style, maybe the offerings I've had are a bit more heavy on the bitter than expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter! Too much for me and I like heavy seas! NOT this one!"
""
""
""
"The feel is a bit abrasive and bitter."
""
""
"On cask at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Great well rounded flavor. A touch of the bitter but all in a great pour. As with most cask presented brews there is not much head or lacing, but the flavor is there. It is unquestoinably an ale so Hop heads take heed."
""
""
""
"Different, very interesting."
""
"It starts off very pleasant with a malty taste that quickly goes into a caramel flavor.  The aftertaste is very very bitter and keeping my liking of the beer at a minimum. That bitterness seems to last forever."
"Aroma of faint dark fruit, spice, earthy, oats, caramel malt. Taste malt, citrus, floral, pepper, toast, bittersweet finish. Nice!"
""
"Malt, followed by caramel, followed by malt. Very pleasant overall."
""
""
""
""
"Extremely unpleasant flavor on the palate which is unfortunate as the look, smell and carbonation level of the beer was well done."
""
""
"Overall:  Pretty spit on for the style.  Sometime one is in the mood for chewiness and mild bitterness."
""
""
"A little bland but not terrible."
""
""
"Very well brew ESB, great strong bitter end"
"I was not crazy about this beer. Poured a dark copper with what looked to be something like yeast floating as thick as a snow glob. Taste was watery with a alcohol after taste. Over all a poor beer."

"Pouring a hazy orange-brownish color leaning into mahogany, Heavy Seas Winter Storm gives an initial top note of hops.  As it opens up, there’s elements of orange peel, subtle woodsy notes, and elements of cacao.  There’s just the slightest trace of bread.  On the palate it starts bright, slightly bitter with flavors of citrus, pine, and an earthiness that’s almost slightly herbal.  The hop flavors are plentiful, the but the malt plays back up, with notes of subtle biscuit, burnt sugar, and toast.  The body is thick, noticeably carbonated, bright, and focused on hops leaning into the bitter side of the spectrum.  The ending comes alive has elements of unlit mild cigars, dried herbal notes, bread, burnt sugar, and hits of citrus pith.  The finish is long and complex."
"O: a little hoppier that your average ESB, which makes me happy;"
""
""
""
""
"had beer on tap.  was good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wanted to like this one a lot more than I did. Pours a dark amber with a tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves some nice lacing behind. It is a bit on the boozy side for an ESB and has a strong caramel aftertaste that just doesn't work for me."
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good beer; not overly bitter and very bright. I have not had a lot of ESB style beers so this review may need to be tweaked a bit over time as I taste more."

"O: An interesting take on an ESB - much hoppier than any of the others that I have tried. Slightly too much alcohol and that alcohol is not well enough hidden for me. Probably would not grab another one of these but it can definitely be enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours medium reddish brown, ruby colored, light layer of white foam. Bready toffee caramel nose. A little sweet. Taste is a light bread filled malt with a firm flavorful hop in the back half. Good flavor blend. Slightly amped ESB."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - decent offering. I'd drink another one."

"O- a solid brew from heavy seas. Definitely one you want to drink quickly and not age, as 7.5% is a bit under the abv for aging and due to the hop content, will definitely oxidize in 6 months or so. I look forward to next year for this seasonal."
""
""
"Like most Heavy Seas offerings, it was underwhelming."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good, a gray companion to a winter stew, exhibiting great malt character, some delicious spices, and a fitter finish."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great rendition of of an ESB, bold enough to be set as their winter seasonal."

"Pours a nice medium amber with red hue that has a nice head that laces and retains well. Nice light nose of biscuit malt with a touch of hops. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A nice balanced flavor of caramel malt sweetness and bitterness against a mild hop flavor, which I believe is East Kent Goldings. Finishes clean with malt sweetness followed by the bitters. My first sampling of Heavy Seas products, and this one outstanding. A nice change of pace for winter warmers that is expertly done."

"I forgot about this one, when I poured this beer it has a light reddish color body with a cc full 2""white head. The was of dark fruits and malt. The taste has some dark fruit notes and caramel to it. The malt comes in on the tail end. The mouthfeel is ok and overall it is ok beer, just not my style."
"Overall a very nice example of what I'd expect from an imperial ESB. Let it warm up and flatten a bit before drinking, however."
""

""

"O- not a bad beer but I wished for more focus on the esb aspects of the beer."

""
""
"O: It's nice to have your expectations met. Before reviewing this, I thought ""meh, ESB""; and after finishing this, I thought ""meh, ESB."" I didn't particularly enjoy this one, but that's due to my dislike of the style."

"forgot i had this one in the fridge decide to crack it open . poured from the bottle into a sam adams pint glass. deep amber in color has a bit of lacing after a while . rich aroma of roasted malt. nice taste from the roasted malt with a bit of burnt that isn't off putting . wishing i would of had this beer a bit earlier in the year. oh well tonight was a bit chilly"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before April 2013. Pours slightly hazy ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, pear, caramel, toast, brown bread, floral, light pepper, light toffee, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, pear, caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, pepper, pine, light nuttiness, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of spicy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, pepper, pine, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt and fruity ester flavors; with a good hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial ESB style. Nice complexity of malt/fruity notes with hop balance; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"This is a good beer, no doubt, but I'd much prefer a Fuller's ESB which is fruitier, less hoppy and easier to drink with that distinct orange marmalade and toast flavor that I love in well-crafted ESB's."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent brew – not my favorite heavy seas brew – but worthy of a try."
""
"Pours a darker brown to amber color with a decent head at pour. Decent head retention and good lacing. Aroma is darker malts and maple syrup. Taste is sweet - again darker malts and syrup present. Starts sweet and finishes on a slightly bitter note but not over powering for those that like milder hops. Great beer for a cold day."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste begins mildly sweet with a balanced but slight hop bitterness kicking in to round things off. Like the aroma there is an array of dark malts and dark fruits showing up in the flavor. Quite nice and authentic to a strong British Bitter."
""
""
"Overall: I'd certainly recommend this beer to a friend. With all the stouts and porter flooding the market during the winter months, it's nice to find something a little lighter. This opens up the window for a good winter drinking session with some buddies. Certainly not on par with their Loose Cannon, but regardless Heavy Seas has impressed me yet again! Touche HS."
""
""
""
""
"O - good beer. Having had this beer before I know it has shown better than this bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall OK, but not great. Not my fav style, although this shies away from the over herbal vegetal grassy hops I really don't like in most ESBs. It's quite bitter and a nice malty balance though, although it does get a bit too sweet. But overall done pretty well."
""
""
""
"Lovely clear rusty color with a light khaki head. Nose is bready with a healthy dose of what smells like Maris Otter malt. A melange of spices to compliment the malt body. Alcohol esters and English fruitiness. Taste is caramel malt sweet with a toasted light and roasted dark grain compliment. Holiday spices abound and flow into the alcohol edge. Big hops show here and give an earthy dry finish that has a good amount of grapefruit. Feel is velvety and lightly chewy. Creamy carbonation makes this on highly drinkable. A superb winter ale!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A good worthy brew."
""
"Overall, a pretty bitter brew. Sweet initially, then boozy and bitter. The hop character adds a little intrigue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good ESB on its own but the use of citrus hops makes it unique compared to other beers in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice winter interpretation of the ESB style. Definitely well-balanced between earthy hops and caramel/chocolate malts. Certainly something I'd have again and recommend to others."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied. It doesn't coat the mouth or tongue. Has a dry finish."
""
"Over all I have to say this ESB is delicious . Big malty and spicy flavor with no spice added. I love ESB's and this brew is at the top of my list."
""
"Overall I really enjoy a high quality ESB but unfortunately this just was not one of them. There is an overly assertive minerally, alcohol dryness that overwhelms the flavor profile. The hops are also too American for the style, comes across as a muddled IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent, a different kind of winter beer compaired to everything else that comes out. Its Flavorful, and a nice mix of bitter hoppy and sweet malty. Alcohol is minor in each drink. The spices really are strong and stand out. Nice change of pace, worth a drink."

"O- A decent sit around the fire fall brew. Flat on the tongue, and nothing very special about this brew. Bitter as it should be, but the nose, taste and mouthfeel are all very underwhelming!"
""
""
"Poured into DFH pint glass. Appearance is a deep reddish amber with desne micro bubbles up top and a coating left behind on the sides of the glass. The aroma skews in the direction of herbal with notes of spruce, pine, and molasses. Taste is pretty sweet with more molasses and spruce. The sweetness doesn't give way to any bitterness and is very sweet all the way to the finish. Not really getting the ESB quality here, this tastes much more like a winter warmer (Which is what the name implies as well). The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat heavy. Overall, I don't feel that this qualifies as an ESB, and it definitely leans towards the sweet side. I would pass on this."

"Heavy Seas Winter Storm from Heavy Seas Beer is brown in color and has the smell of malt. This one came in a Heavy Seas sampler pack I picked up sometime in March. The taste is sweet with a hop overtone. There is also raisins and molasses in the mix. A good tasting beer to be sure. May be a tad sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice, approachable interpretation of the ESB, which I normally can't stand (at least in its macro version found in Europe)."

"This is my second product from this Heavy Seas line. Both are good, but a little rough around the edges."
""
""
"O: once again clipper city delivers a quality ale at reasonable price"
""
""
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a dark red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, wheat, alcohol, perfume, and bitter hops. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I really wasn't too impressed with this one. There was something about the combination of the flavors going on in this one that really turned it off to my palate. I even let others try it and they agreed that something was off on the flavor of this one that wasn't very palate pleasing. Glad I finally got to tick it, but doubt I will be having it again."
"Overall, this is a very creative, and effective, approach to a winter beer."
""
""
"Overall: Absolutely appropriate as a winter offering. Nothing too inspiring, but a good beer nonetheless. What is an Imperial ESB? A barleywine junior?"
""
""
"O: Easy drinking, good beer. Nothing wrong with it, but I don't think I'd get it again. Not a huge ESB fan."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Very simple but pretty nice. The nose was a little light and the beer itself is more hop forward then what I would consider perfect for a ESB, but on the whole a very simple but good brew. What a great appearance. Worth a buy."
""
""
"This beer poured out with a nice looking amber color with a light cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer was malty, it didn't have much of a bitter aroma at all. The taste of the beer was interesting, I felt like I was getting hints of Pine in there. The mouthfeel of the beer was basically normal, not anything that really impressed me on that level. Overall this beer wasn't bad, I think it's one that I'd try again just to give it another go."
""
""
""
""
"I was expecting a bit more in the hop department, but overall its a pretty tasty beer. kind of forgettable, however."
"This is a great beer and one that I am thrilled I got to try on cask. Will definitely seek out again."
""
"Overall a nice beer, a nice strong ESB. One of the better offerings from this brewery,"
"Overall: This must've been a tough beer to capture, but Clipper City nailed it! Really tasty, refreshing stuff. One of their best seasonals."
""
""
"The body is medium with a light carbonation. Crispness is light up front and a bit of a gentle smoothness picks up. FOr such a delicious beer, I do wish it flowed a little better. It's not flat by any means but does seem to lay down just a bit when it could be more interesting."
"Overall it is a bit too bold for a bitter in my book. Still a fairly pleasant winter drink."
""
"Overall: Taste says it all, I love this beer. Any shortcoming are made up by the taste and I can't rate this any lower overall without kidding myself."
""
""
"Heavy Seas Winter Storm Category 5 Ale is a crystal clear and very sparkling copper ale with a huge, foamy, off white head that has outstanding retention. A sweet grainy bready raisin aroma is kind if muffled by the head. The soft, smooth, full body has a bone dry finish. It's creamy. A spicy bitterness is at the front, first like juniper and then like wood resin. There's a slight baklava sweetness lingering, but the bitterness keeps it opressed. This is a big burly beer. Good stuff."
"Overall: Well crafted. Just what I would expect for an extra special bitter to sip on during a cold winter day locked inside the house. Try it with some dark, smoked meats."
"O - A little too disjointed for me. Some nice characteristics, but they fail to play nicely together and leave me searching too hard for the highlights."
""
""
""
"O: This beer looked fantastic and had a great nose. Taste was a bit more bitter than I was expecting, and the alcohol is noticeable. Close to a tie between this and Gritty McDuff's."
""
"The beer had a medium feel, it was smooth and the beer seemed a bit under carbonated, but I suppose that is more typical of the style. Overall, a pretty good beer."
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty average ESB that really didn't interest me that much. The flavor was heavy on the malts, the malt profile wasn't bad, it just needed more hops to balance it out and it needed more bitterness. I could probably drink a couple of these, but the flavor is a little dull and doesn't hold my attention so I doubt I would want to drink more then one. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was pretty spot on for an ESB. What I liked least about this beer was the lack of hops in this beer, the aroma and taste could have benefited from more hops, the malts are just too dominating for an ESB. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I would much rather have Saugatuck's or Short's ESB. If your a big fan of ESB's you may find this beer disappointing, but if you like malty beers this may be worth a try. I haven't had a whole lot of experience with ESB""s but the ones I have had had a much better hop presence and that's where this beer was lacking. This isn't a bad beer but i just didn't do anything for me, it seems like I have much better luck with the mutiny fleet instead of the smaller format bottles. A pretty meh beer and so far my least favorite ESB, I am starting to think that the better beers from Clipper City come in the Mutiny fleet since I have yet to be impressed by their 12oz bottles."
""
""
"Not your average winter seasonal. I'm not so sure it really gets me in the mood for a winter storm, but in and of itself, it is not a bad beer. Not really as balanced as an ESB typically might be, but it's got an interesting interplay between flavors. Recommended to try at least once!"
"-JH-"
"M: Firm, robust, and yet delicate. The superb hop highlights add another dimension to both flavour and feel, adding dryness to complement the carbonation."
""
""
"O- This seems to be a recurring theme with most of the Heavy Seas brews: They have great ideas for beers but don't execute them well. IMHO, their two ""Cannon"" beers are the best things they've done and the rest is just ""eh."" Wins points for the pleasant aroma but, other than that, just another dud."
""
""
"overall a nice beer; not one i would kill myself trying to get a hold of, but does not disappoint either."
""
"This is pretty good. Not my favorite style, but still pretty good, and definitely does what it set out to do (whoever heard of an Imperial ESB?)"
""
"We did a large christmas and winter beer tasting panel and this was one of the many that we tried. Most of the beers we tried we solid including this one that the panel liked."
"I haven't acutally had a real one in some time. This one is strong and sweet and full and mild. I like it a lot. Good strong ale. I would say get some and have a taste."
"O - Pleasantly suprised at how much I like this!"
"M - good carbonation; medium body; less smooth than desired."
""
""
""
""
""
"SPOT ON, TRY THIS TREAT!"
""
""
""
""
"D: Defiantly a beer that you want to let warm as you drink it so the experience changes, a sipper for sure."
"Final Thoughts-Overall I really like this. I think it’s something you’d again, only have a couple of but it really is worth trying, though if you drink lighter beers the taste of this may be overwhelming for you. It does have a decent amount of the mentioned flavors, but for the dark or stronger beer drinkers this is surely a good beer worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is a little rough to drink though. Harsh sulfur midpalate flavor. The finish is a little dry but overall it is a decent little beer. Not my favorite but I might have it again."
"Overall a tasty and hearty winter delight."
"This beer poured a clear dark amber color and formed a light tan foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, molasses, hops and bitter coffee with some smoky aspects. The flavor was of malt, hops, caramel and candy sugar like molasses. The body was medium light and the finish slightly sweet with a slight burnt aspect."
"Overall described as earthy, but doesn't feel like that so much to me. It is a real nice drink but definitely hop forward for this style. I think if you are a bit of a hop head and want to try and ESB this might be your perfect beer."
"At first, the extremely bitter finish hit me unexpectedly – but my palate adjusted nicely after a few more sips. It’s not quite the best ESB I’ve ever had, but certainly an interesting one – definitely ‘imperial’ like the label says."
"D: Admittedly i have a soft spot for the ESB style, so this imperial version hits alot of the right notes for me. Balanced, unique, a brew worth having."
"O- This beer has flavors that call to mind the season, yet would be enjoyable all year round. This will probably be near the top of my list for this season...guess it's kind of a shame that we don't really have seasons in Florida to truly appreciate it."
"O/D-Pretty good. I enjoyed it. Definitely one of the more solid winter 6 packs. I will enjoy all six of these I believe. Nothing amazing but solid."
"Overall - I actually enjoyed this one quite a bit. Great flavor present, it's a bit spice-heavy, but I think it ends up balancing pretty well. A very good beer for a chilly evening."
"91."
"Overall - a good beer from Heavy Seas. Not quite as flavorful as some of their others but its a good strong beer that is just right on the ABV"
"O: Good stuff and the first time I have really had this brewery, will try more."
"O: Nice beer. A little off on some characteristics, but overall I would get this again. Not something I would search for, but if there was nothing else..."
"The mouthfeel is a touch heavy but understandably so. A very enjoyable offering and perfect for cold weather. I dig it."
"Overall not a bad ESB but definitely not the best. I bet most would like it but i like a little more of an English style"
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with a medium body, very little carbonation and slight bitter finish. Good drinkability, this is a nice winter beer that went down smooth and hid the alcohol well; a nice beer for a cold winter day and a solid ESB."
"Prost!!!"
"A well-done Wintertime Imperial ESB."
"This brew has pretty decent drinkability, its a nice well rounded brew. Its a nice hardy winter brew. I would surely reach for this brew again."
"Drinking this beer reminded me of smoking a clove cigarette. The mouthfeel was nice and solid, like other Heavy Seas beers, but a bit too chewy. I like this kind of chewy feel in Heavy Seas' Weizenbock, where it combines with banana, molasses and light spice. In Winter Storm, it combines with an overpowering range and intensity of spice. I didn't find it to be a pleasant experience."
"D: Decently drinkable; not going to seek this one out or anything- it's a bit too sweet without many interesting elements. That said, half a glass wasn't too hard to get down."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A slight crisp hot that still tastes like the water was melted from ice. I liked this beer a little more than I anticipated."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"The mouthfeel is satisfyingly medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. The drinkability is also quite good, the ABV is completely hidden, I'd peg this closer to a 5% based on taste. I was all prepared to write a terrible review of this. This was the last of a six pack I bought a few months ago, which quickly became my ""drink when already wasted"" beer because I really didn't enjoy it. I thought it was a bit of a mess with too-strong hops fighting with dark fruits and assertive bready malts - pulling in every direction but never quite reaching anywhere approaching good. Now, with three months of age on it, the flavors have considerably mellowed out and melded together to something that's actually quite nice. Give it a shot, especially if you see any lingering bottles on the shelf now."
"D: I've grown fond of this style in the last couple of years, and this is a fine example of that. Jeez... an ESB with a 7.5%ABV... WOW!!!!"
"Drink - There are a whole bunch of flavours going on with this beer and that definitely makes it interesting to drink. The alcohol was well hidden and it fairly enjoyable. It was the first Heavy Seas beer I've tried and I'm looking forward to trying others from their lineup."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Poured a transparent honey brown/amber pour with creamy bubbly off-white head with sticky lacing and soft carbonation. Very sweet and fresh earthy hop aroma. Flavor is of a slow starting, but ultimately potent grapefruit and pine hop finish; the alcohol is well hidden. Medium bodied on the palate with a nice bitter drag; soft with the decent amount of carbonation."
"Ah, and the alcohol will slowly but surely warm you up."
"Drinkability - This brew is really pretty good I think. Very solid and well rounded. Obviously this is a ""Winter"" beer, but I think I could enjoy this on occasion throughout the year."
"Drinkability: I rather liked this beer and wished I'd had the time for a second. The balance of flavors is very good but I would have to say it is basically a mixture of an English and an American style ESB since it includes the American hops. Not quite what I'd expected in an ESB but I enjoyed it none the less."
"D - goes down nicely but the alcohol slows you down."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. drinkability is decent, it was a nicely flavored winter seasonal. It was malty, hoppy and spicy and worked all of those flavors together nicely. Nice beer for the style and season."
"I really like this one. It is much more balanced than a lot of ESB's I've had before and I think it is nice for a change. There is hop spice, but not the elaborate ""coriander, ginger, nutmeg, etc"" that you find with other winter brews. I prefer when a brewery can let the hops speak in the beer without tweaking the natural aromas and flavors. I'd buy this again -- definitely a beer to keep you warm when it is below freezing outside..."
"Now if only breweries in the USA would brew a REAL ESB."
"D- This was a good beer don't get me wrong. It seemed a little watery for the style or I should say because they made it seem big that I figured it would have a big body. The ABV makes no real fuss in the beer at all which once again I expected. Overall a nice wintertime beer that is a little out of the norm."
"Had this last year and couldn't wait for them to put it out again. This should be available all year round. It's just what I imagined an imperial bitter would taste like. Domestic bitters tend to be a bit too dry for my liking. This one is slightly sweet, somewhat similar to a Fuller's. Heavy Seas has made another excellent beer. Baltimore should be proud."
"D - I am actually thinking about getting a six pack as I type if its still around my local place I should get it for around 10 bucks. Not a bad price for such a great brew!"
"D - Pretty good. Was it necessary to have such a high abv? I'm not sure, but despite the faults, it was enjoyable enough to order another."
"I was impressed by the two rocky fingers of light-tan head that I got off of my pour. Not only was it markedly different than the fizzy head that I usually see from AmeriCAN Adjunct Lagers, but its retention was fabulous. Color was a deep coppery-amber with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was initially big with malt, but there was also a good bit of piney hops in the mix. Yum! Mouthfeel was medium with a wild juxtaposition of caramel sweetness and pine hops on the tongue. Dang, but this was really good and wayyyy too smooth. I could see putting a couple of these away before I even knew what had happened. Finish was more hoppy than malty, but it was the interplay between the two that really made this a unique beer. I really should not pooh-pooh bottled beers the way that I had been. I would drink this pretty routinely during the winter."
"I'm normally wary of anything labeled ""imperial"" that doesn't have ""Russian"" to the left and ""stout"" to the right, especially if it comes from an American brewery-- that will practically guarantee that it's overly boozy and ham-fistedly hopped. However, the imperial part of this beer was nearly absent: none of the usual smelly alcohol; no thick and gooey body; no black-hole gravity; none of the smack-your-face hops. In fact, this was as light and fruity as a good UK ESB and only slightly more alcoholic. 7.50% seems generous, in fact, as there was very little warmth to this brew. Worth a try, especially because it is *not* ""imperial"" anything."
"D: Nice run-of-the-mill beer, but nothing to write home about."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors, while there, are decent, but disappear much too quickly in lieu of the bitterness and overall, I would best describe this beer as relatively bland."
"I chased a Celebration Ale w/this fine ESB. Drank this straight from the bottle as it was from the fridge @ a holiday party w/a very interesting mix of craft beers. I had my doubts about following the Celebration Ale w/this ESB but it actually was a nice brew that was actually a perfect step back if only slightly from the Celebration Ale which is hop cone right off the branch. Would definitely have again and recommend to all those looking for a winter/holiday beer that's just that BEER, w/o the trimmings. Clove, nutmeg and the like. Good drinkability for a stronger beer w/a hop kick"
"Pours a dark copper color with a thin cap of head that fades to a ring. Big, sweet malt aroma, with hints of fruity hops. There's a strong, green bitterness that dominates from start to finish, with some sweetness from the malt trying to make itself known, but not succeeding too well. The finish is lingering with a slightly harsh bitterness, and a bit of alcohol and body is medium with a decent amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good. Its nice to try a winter beer that doesn't involve cloves or nutmeg, but the hops are a bit too green for my liking."
"D: This is like every other ESB, only bolder."
"This is definitely an original. I haven't really seen any breweries attempt an Imperial ESB, so credit to Heavy Seas. Good beer; give this one a shot in the winter time."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and could have more than one at a sitting."
"Pours a clear deep orange copper color with a thick off white/ slightly yellow head with a small amount of lacing. Smells of caramel malts and a little floral and bitter hops. Tastes much the same. Tons of bitterness from the hops and a slight sweetness from the malts. A little alcohol. The beer is medium bodied and has a small amount of carbonation. Somewhat easy to drink."
"Great beer overall. I would love to have this on tap during the holiday season. Out of the bottle would be nice for Christmas Eve night and Christmas Eve dinner. I would recommend this beer to fans of Heavy Seas. While not spectacular, it does provide a some subtle complexity that is hard to find."
"I got some carmel from the malt and bitter with a little floral from the hops. It has a very nice and delicate mouth feel. The carbonation was nice in this beer. It stood up to is type extra special bitter."
"Not bad at all. Easy enough to drink, I'd say a good solid brew."
"D: Despite its abrasivish flavor and highish abv, I could put back a few of these. A good beer for the winter."
"Overall, a very enjoyable and unique offering from clipper city"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops, floral. Taste is well balanced hops and malts, a touch of alcohol is present, just a tad bit sweet. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
"D/M: Nice crisp carbonation that helps bring out the flavor and aroma of the hops. Not really too overpowering but really does not feel much like a winter beer. Great hoppy beer but not exactly what I was looking for in a winter beer."
"drinkability: Not bad. Not great. Interesting ""imperial"" ESB."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is light toffee.Taste is butter,toffee and caramel malts.There is a bitterness at the end.The alcohol is covered up by the bitterness.A pretty good beer in my opinion.I would recommend and purchase again."
"D: Very well balanced type of beer, would definitely enjoy it again!"
"A nice seasonal brew."
"Too bitter at the back of my palate. Not an ale for my taste. All other aspects were very good. The aroma of the freshly opened bottle was very hearty and pleasant. At first the taste was nutty like most ales but the overwhelming bitterness was too much. Might be an ale to be paired with food... Probably not buy this product again."
"PS. Frisco's is my new favortite place to go"
"Poured into a tulip. Pours a moderate copper color with a white head and a dose of lacing. The nose is fairly hoppy with some floral and earthy notes. Nice caramel notes. The taste is pretty good with a mild hoppiness. Feel is light and a tad bit harsh. Drinks fairly well and is a nice concept."
"Very unique tasting beer."
"Drinkability: it's a good, casual drinking beer. I enjoyed the overall experience."
"this beer company makes very nice beers>>>never had one i didn't like!"
"im not even going to finish reviewing this beer and save myself some headache trying to pick it apart. very disappointed. i LOVE just about everything these guys do but i gotta say this fell hard on its face. not sure why. the last beer i just got done reviewing was of similar structure so its not like my buds were like a deer in headlights from an enormous blast of hops, but perhaps ill still give them the benefit of the doubt and come back to this beer again some time."
"My overall impression was that this was a bit heavy-handed. Heavy-handed, you say? But isn't that the point of an ""imperial ESB?"" Well, I suppose so - no question that they pumped this beer up on some sort of beer steriod - but in that regard it came across like a similarly pumped-up body builder - no balance. Appropriately big malt, but in an effort to keep pace with hopping, the bittering came across as rough and a bit raw. The ETOH similarly was not well integrated into the flavor, and rode atop with a warming harshness."
"Given to me by a generous on-BAer. Thanks Kelli! Winter Storm pours a beautiful brown with ruby undertones. There is a thin layer of foam and moderate lacing on this. I found the scent somewhat nondescript with pine and sweet resin dominating. The taate is where this one truly shines for me, an introduction of sweet sugary maple gives way to tart grapefruit and lemon. The mouthfeel is near-perfect, but a touch overcarbonated for the subtler notes. I am very sad Clipper City is not local, as this would be a very welcome six pack to be always on hand. To be fair, I must be very partial to the imperial esb style, as I loved Velvet Underground ESB when Hopworks had it on draft. I wish more brewers would work with this beautiful style."
"*Reviewers edit: I just noticed that the ""purchase by"" date was 4 months old at the time of reviewing. This may have affected important characteristics, and will try to amend this review with a fresher batch."
"A surprisingly drinkable beer for a strong bitter."
"So this is what an Imperial ESB tastes like--American brewing at its best here even with excessively creative made-up styles. Impressive, yet another seasonal we wish was year-round. Give this one a go especially if you are already sick of the spiced winter warmers that taste like organic toothpaste."
"brownish red, light off cream colored head, slightly opaque. Mild aroma, mostly flowery and earthy hops. Big beer taste, sharp chocolatey malts rounded out with indescernable hop bitterness. The hop bite lasts long, moderate mouthfeel. pretty well done. This would be nice in the winter."
"Drinkability: This is like every other Heavy Seas Beer easy to drink and easy to drink more then one"
"pours an amber-copperish color semi-transparent with less than a fingers width of light tan head. very light on the carbonation. it has an array bitter, citrus, hoppy, and malty flavors. the hops most present in the smell. tons of yeast floating about the beer makes it very interesting to look at while drinking."
"Drinkability: Definitely an above average ESB, love the smooth alcohol finish, easy to have two or three at a time, warms you when it is cold outside!"
"Drinkability: An above average bready ESB. I could have two or three. Nothing extraordinary, but nothing bad either."
"D: Nice drinking winter ale. At 7.5% abv these will definitely keep you warm on those cold New England nights."
"Overall, I can't compare this to others of the style as it isn't a style I've tried. It is however a very nice beer and another good member of the Heavy Seas sampler."
"I enjoyed this one, but have had very few ESBs to compare it to."
"D: Decently blended and tasty. It didn't seem to fit the style though."
"I've been impressed with all the Clipper City beers I've tried and this one is no exception. I bought one single bottle, but I could have drank 2 or 3 of this fine Imperial ESB."
"D= 3 I could not drink a lot of this beer. The hops are harsh with a long draw at the end of bitterness. It was a good style of esb and I'm impressed with Clipper City. This was the first Imperial ESB I have had and I now have an idea, a bench mark, of what an imperial ESB should taste like."
"Giving this a shot on the tongue. Sharp carbonation at the start is a plus...taste starts with a honey and caramel maltiness. Thin on the tongue... A citric acidity shows up at some point then goes back into hiding. A nice, slight touch of dark fruit appears towards the balance. Ends with a potent but long TOASTED CARAMEL note on the tongue... This is the dominant taste here overall. Hints of bitterness pool in the corners of my mouth. A bit of alcohol present at the top of the throat. This beer is too nondescript to really impress. A solid brew, but lacking bright or deep notes. One saving grace is the strong carbonation. The activity on the tongue enhances the beer's bitter character and impedes the toasted malts from becoming cloying. In light of this beers shortcomings, at 7.5% ABV, it is not a beer I would choose to drink often..."
"D - A really impressive ESB... Enjoyable sip after sip... Hides the 7.5% ABV rather well... I would gladly welcome again and again..."
"D/Overall - In a longer 3+ beer session, I could fit this in towards the end, but I'd skip it if I had lots of options. Not bad, but not super memorable."
"Good drinkability and a nice change for a winter warmer."
"D- It's okay but very thin and unimpressive. It's not as bold as the bottle lead me to believe"
"Overall, I guess this one drinks pretty easy. But it doesn't leave me wanting another, and I don't think I'd reach for another one soon, considering the plethora of options. But I'm glad I tried it, and I wish Clipper City the best in its endeavors."
"Winter Storm has a beautiful reddish color, a sweet vanilla-like flavor, and leaves very little behind. Not bad but not worthwhile."
"Number five holds a burnt copperish brown color that's resembles a very dark lager. Just a bit of foam on the top of this off a tap. LAce does not cling well leaving a loose spider web design. Smells like a bigger version of a simple style. It's mainly sweet malty with caramel and some mild spicing. The hops give off a scent that's faint but not dead. This is pretty good stuff. Minimal holiday spices with just a sense of hop bitterness in the end. I really cant say that though cause the hops really don't come in at all. The feel is smooth going down with no sight of the alcohol and the carb seems muted, it works well, this is easy drinking. Medium bodied. This is nothing more than a lightly spiced simple beer with a great feel. Sometimes less is more."
"Overall a drinkable beer winter beer that has a solid flavor. I wish it would've given me a bit more head, though. A robust drinker for these cold winter months."
"D- Pretty good. I might get a little bit bored with it after a few...or maybe just full."
"Easy drinking brew."
"This pours a dark but clear mahogany color with a modest off-white head and good lacing. The aroma is a solidly bitter swampy malt and citrus hop. The flavor jumps out with lots of malty pumkin spice, a little bayberry fruitiness. It mellows nicely and provides a smooth mid-bodied feel with a very tiny bubbled but lively carbonation. It grows on you, full of dark coffee/kahlua and holiday accents that blend into a satisfying libation to usher in the holidays with aplumb. Drinkable enough too!"
"I would buy this again and would recommend it to almost anyone. Very accessible."
"Drinkability: It's alright, I suppose. It's sweet, it's got ample bitterness, and alcohol (though thankfully not anymore than it does). Personally, I've never been overly enamored with the Heavy Seas line-up, but you could certainly do alot worse than this."
"Comes out of the tap a warm translucent coppery amber with a fine, coppery-tan head Aroma is strong, spicy, malty and slightly hoppy. Flavor is rich, malty and spicy with an undertone of hops that is only slightly bitter. Texture is sharp, lively, sassy and tingly and leaves a hoppy-bitter and spicy finish."
" I wouldn't buy a 6-pack but it's nice to have a chance encounter."
"Poured to a brownish orange with medium off-white head and some lacing. Nose was very hard to detect and the mouthfeel was slightly on the thin side. Taste tried to bring out some caramel hints, as well as a touch of hoppy fruit, but didn't exceed well. At 7.3% abv, I would have expected either a whiff or taste of alcohol, but got neither. Not surprisingly, finish was somewhat on the short and watery side. Have realoly enjoyed the others I've had from Clipper City...this one just missed the mark slightly."
"Drinkability- Actually pretty good drinkability, smooth, and at 7.5 abv is certainly impressive."
"If you like Southern Tier Old Man Winter, then I highly reccomend this beer. Very similar in style and taste."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I bought this beer. Its a tasty, well balanced, easy drinking beer with a sneaky 7.5% abv. Good stuff."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination. Enjoyed this beer , drinkability is good , could have a couple more tonight.7.5 % alcohol very nicely masked here."
"Notes: Imperial ESB or not, this is a rather nice malty brew with a nice hop counterbalance. The cask profile gives it quite a nice character."
"D: I actually like this beer a lot, nice Americanization of a classic British style."
"d- Easy to drink, with mellow flavors. This beer goes down easy, even though it may be lacking in some other catagories"
"Pours a blood orange color, hazy, with a rather small tight cream colored head. The aroma is bready, some pepper, and a muted citrus hop. Fairly large honey malt presence in the taste, bready, very light pepper and a grassy slightly piney hop. Has a bit of a funk taste from the yeast. Funk as in off, not farmhouse. Kind of like a buttery apricot flavor. Moderate feel, bordering on full, soft carbonation; sweet overall but finishes with a slight bitter twang. A so so brew, decent flavors but some odd flavors as well. They seem to go with a imperial ESB which seems counter to the style. Why take a lighter style brew and imperialize it. I don't get this. Imperial pils, ESB, Helles??? Why? Imperial Bud Light here we come."
"Overall I very much enjoyed this beer. While much hoppier than classic ESB's I think the hops worked in this beer's favor and the malt profile itself is nothing to sneeze at. Well worth a shot."
"Pours a clear ruby red color with a creamy off white head. The head dissipates fast but gives off a light hoppy aroma with hints of alcohol. The flavor begins with sweet, semi-tart, maltyness and transitions smoothly into a tart hoppy flavor. Well balanced. This brew has a light body with moderate carbonation and the finish fades into a slight alcohol taste. As the flavor fades away, a tart after taste remains."
"MF/D: Good carbonation, a little rough and unrefined going down, bitter hop finish."
"D: Very high. The alcohol is well masked. I could go for another."
"Served from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer has a dark copper color, almost brown. There was about a finger of tan bubbles when first poured that quickly dissipated. There is a strong hop presence in the aroma; it evokes grass and caramel. It's quite pleasant. When you first taste the beer you're greeted by a smooth maltiness. This quickly gives way to bitter hops. The bitterness lingers on after you swallow and evolves to a slightly burnt flavor. It's complex and interesting. The beer has a fuller body than I expected; it really coats your mouth. There's also more carbonation than I thought there would be. I find the Winter Storm to be very drinkable. It isn't a beer I'd want to drink quickly, but it has some great characteristics that make me think I could slowly enjoy a number of bottles over the course of an evening."
"Drinkability- Greatly refreshing, but also a good brew for cold weather (thanks to some nice malt flavors)."
"Drinkability: A very good ESB to have on a cold winter night. Very drinkable besides the 7.5% ABV, but the hints of spiciness paired with the good balance of hoppiness and malt is a key factor in this beer's complexity. Definetley a beer I'll be having more of this winter."
"Tastes fine, mouthfeel is all good. Drinkable. Give it a try"
"D - If you like bitter ales, then you will find this very drinkable for this style."
"Cask at Churchkey. Cloudy amber with chunks and floaties, medium light tan bubbles, just around the edge of the glass. Aroma of bread and caramel. Nicely hopped but with a good malt balance. Taste has a few splinters of oak, very subtle. Longish bitter finish. Nice enough."
"Pours an attractive orange/amber color, transparent with some visible carbonation and a medium sized, sticky peach colored head. Perfumey nose, mint leaves, planty hops and an alcohol/solvent character. A round sweetness balances the very hoppy profile, peppery, assertive and pretty easy to drink. The alcohol content is apparent only in the nose, and it does become off putting after a while. Not the best ive had in this ""Imperial ESB"" style but then again not the worst."
"A strawberry jam colored beer with a cappuccino colored head. Smell is hoppy, a big old hop smell kicking the nostrils. Taste starts out a deeply bitter taste which sweetens as it finishes as you progress through the glass the beer gets to be much sweeter as you move through the glass. This is a medium bodied bubbly beer. The beer is sweet enough to settle my desires for a bitter brew while sweet enough to keep me interested."
"Poured a perfectly clear, deep amber with a small head that dissipated to a very thin collar. I couldn't get much of anything for aroma. The taste was lightly malt and even more lightly hops. In other words, a little bit sweet and a little less bitter, not a real stand out. The feel was medium bodied with a little carbonation. Drinkability was good. Not bad. I have found the Clipper City beers to generally be good valued beers."
"This one grows on you, or me at least"
"Nicely balanced medium body with some caramel malt and hazelnut countering a bitter earthy hop presence. The hop bitterness is pretty tame and not too overpowering but lasts throughout. The ABV is pretty well masked with only some slight alcohol warmth."
"D: For this style, I'd drink this all the time."
"Drinkability - not quite as sessionable as I'd like. I could enjoy more but would prefer a less hoppy ESB for a session."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination makes this one very drinkable. Alcohol was warming, but not overbearing on the taste. A nice drinking beer overall."
"Drink ability is good. For 7.5 percent the alcohol was hidden nicely. Not one of my favorite styles but overall a good beer"
"Drinkability - Not bad, but not a very sessionable beer."
"medium body, medium to almost light carbonation. nice sweet sticky mouthfeel. nice good drinkable beer, i recommend this to all"
"Birreria Paradiso/$6.25/Pint"
"Edit: Pairs nicely with some dark chocolate I had."
"D- Pretty solid beer, not overly powerful or the best tasting ESB ever but pretty good."
"12 oz brown bottle part of a Heavy Seas Variety pack. Pours a deep copper color with a thick rocky head. Nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops and alcohol,with come caramel malt notes. This brew tastes great, a perfect balance of firm hop bitterness and sweet malt with a alcohol kick in the finish. At 7.5 ABV I guess you could call this am Imperial ESB. Sadly there were only three to enjoy."
"Pours a slightly hazy, rich amber color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of hops, then some sweet malt come through, there's some nutty and biscuit aromas as well. Fits the style of a Extra Special / Strong Bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. A noticeable dryness is present as well. Tastes of hops up front, then sweet malt, then the nut flavors and dryness are present, an interesting yeast flavor, a slight alcohol flavor come through in the middle, and the finish is again hops. Overall, not quite what I was expecting from an ESB, but surprisingly good."
"Dark, reddish orange with a big fat sand colored head that leaves rings of sticky lace all down the glass. Smells nice and hoppy with some caramel malt. Tastes more like a DIPA than IESB to me, but who cares? Tasty and richly malty with gobs of grapefruity hops slathered on top with a nice bitterness in the finish. A hop head's delight for sure."
"Poured amber with gold shimmers, not much of a head and there was some spotty lacings left on the glass. Oaky smell mixed with honey, somewhat sweet. Citrus and honey mixed with malt taste, nice hop bitterness, seems a little bitey for an ESB, but still very tasty. Slick, oily mouthfeel, slides down nice and easy. Overall, nice beer, worth a try, different from other ESBs that I have tried."
"While I'd like the nose to exhibit a bit more specific hop character, I want the bitterness to not be as harsh in the finish. Impossibly to please I suppose. Even with those complaints, this is a pretty tasty brew. I'd happily down a few."
"D: Tasty beer. I've had it on tap and it's even better."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for a slightly stronger beer in this style."
"Pours a clear amber red with a small white head that leaves a small thin ring with some legs and lacing on the glass. The smell is some dark fruits with a hint of alcohol. Not much of a hop presence in the nose. The taste is fruity with some yeast and alcohol. There is a slight bitter hoppiness at the end but mostly an alcohol sting. Another reviewer stated this is more like a light barleywine. Since this is billed as a Imperial ESB I would agree but it needs more hops to become a true b-wine. The mouthfeel is oily from the alcohol and could be a little thicker in the body. Drinkability is good for a cold, snowy night. I could finish off a sixer by the fire before bed."
"D- Feels like the key to this beer is to serve it just lightly chilled so much larger flavor profile than when its cold. Its says esb but tastes more like a light barleywine. Either way I like it."
"Taste is more of the same as the nose, but the bitter hops are more prevalent and floral. Has a British feel to it, but without the mineral flavors. There is a heavy malt backbone here and has a big beer feel to it. Not bad, but not particularly memorable either. Not what I look for in a winter seasonal."
"D: I am a fan of big bitterness, but with the alcohol being quite in-your-face, I feel it is best sipped instead of guzzled. But that's just me."
"Blipped Children of the Sea by Black Sabbath"
"The finish is nothing but the warming alcohol. It gets my attention like I just took a shot of something harsh. Not the strongest in terms of alcohol I've ever had, but it tasted like it."
"Halfway through carbonation seems to fade and the drinkability subsides a bit for my liking."
"D: Pretty good. Tastes like it says it is: a strong ESB."
"Notes from: 12/24/07"
"I've had these before and I'll have them again (within minutes). Like all the other Heavy Seas beers, this is recommended."
"Drinkability~ Fair. I guess good for what it is, but not my idea of a good winter brew. Probably won't have another but worth the try and experience of having this type of beer."
"Easy drinking, smooth, and an enjoyable winter ESB."
"I do look forward to this seasonal from Clipper City. It is balanced and one of the more approachable brews in their heavy seas series - a solid brew."
"Poured a two-finger head with seethru body that left a lace ring as it went down my mug. Small, minor aromas of both sweet malts and citric hop notes. Smooth and creamy with a subdued malt sensation that is well-balanced with hints of cocoa and caramel. The hops are noticeable too with a leafy, bitter feeling that leads to a balanced beer and a spicy, dry backbite. Both mellow/sweet and with some hop pick-me-up, the ABV is tucked away well and this beer picked me up on a very cold Pittsburgh afternoon."
"Super-clear, almost shiny, amber red to orange in hue, you could read an eye chart through it, the head disappears real, real quick with no real lacing left behind. Nothing archly bitter about the nose, green hops, spices, meadow-like florality and grassiness, nothing too concentrated, the citrus component starts and then stops, not too round nor soft, just angular enough to stay within category bounds. Medium-bodied, glides well for its consciously semi-gritty texture, the malt eases it into the palate and ably hands off to the hops by the mid-palate. Orange rind, pine resin, hard maple candy, hardly any caramel nor chocolate accents. Never really bitter here too, just keeps you off-balance and plunging forward at angles. Really grows on you over time."
"This would make an excellent session beer, I'll be buying more of this."
"Not bad at all, but not the best from Clipper City- certainly worth a try, especially if you are fortunate enough to have a beer store that allows single bottle purchases"
"I love Clipper City beer. They always have something wonderful to offer. Would that they could increase their distribution area, so more beer lovers could fall in love with their wonderful product."
"Drinkability: A fine winter beer. I can see why people are giving this one accolades. Would quaff again."
"Clear orange copper body, topped by a small, gauzy, light khaki head. Good lacing. Nose shows off toffee malts, grassy-herbal hops, faint metal, toasted bread, and strawberry jam. Toasted grains and minty hop bitterness up front. Toffee and cookie dough malts add some sweetness, while maintaining a toasted edge. Herbal, grassy hop bitterness comes in near the finish as the malts turn a little butterscotchy. Slightly warming. Medium body with a creamy feel. A pretty good winter-y ESB."
"This is a pretty good brew, I'd recommend it for sure."
"M- Medium-to-thin and gone after the swallow, but that's not a bad thing for an ""Imperial ESB."" It's not quite sessionable, but I could have two without burning out. Tonight I had a stronger beer earlier and I'm ready to call it a night."
"D - love ESBs in general but Clipper City takes this well beyond most...could see myself buying some to savor year round"
"D- I like this one here and a solid brew for sure."
"Clipper City has brewed up a powerful storm of flavor with this one."
"This is an amped up ESB that still stays fairly drinkable. It's not extremely complex but is enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: This is a very good winter ale that fits as a very malty but hoppy ale. It's a very good beer for those who enjoy a balanced beer brewed with care and no malt or hops limits."
"Medium bodied, creamy, doughy. The carbonation keeps things fairly easy drinking."
"D. This is an extreme ESB and I like it alot."
"Creamy and rather thick feel. A tiny burn at the swallow. A good, slightly unbalanced drink. Very drinkable but sweeter than it could be."
"Drinkability: A pleasant enough beer, with nice malt depth."
"Medium bodied with a touch too much carbonation. Finishes really dry which accentuates the hop bitterness. Not a bad beer. A little heavy in the alcohol for an ESB but I guess this is a ""Heavy Seas"" beer. I would recommend this one."
"A decent stab at an ESB. I'm not sure that it is really so strong that it deserves the ""Imperial"" designation on the bottle, but I will look for it again next year."
"On the dry side (surprising, considering the smell). Full bodied, but not quite creamy. Peppery hop swallow and aftertaste. There's a dry darker malt flavor that comes out in the aftertaste. Great complexity and blend of flavors."
"D - Not something I would session, again I think more hops or reigning back the malt some would help hide or mask the alcohol and improve the drinkability."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Nice clear amber color. Mix of hops and malt nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is almost sweet caramel with the hops balancing. Better than an ESB - brewer calls this an imperial ESB which fits. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Tullys Beer & Wine Wells, Me. Best before Mar 2009."
"The taste is a delight. This is a medium bodied beer, not too syrupy on the tongue, but oily and smooth. This is a complex beer for sure. There is the full palate of caramel and sweet malts. There is a liqueur type sweetness with warming alcohol notes. There is also some citrus flavors, most noteably a bit of cherry and orange rind. There is a nice piney, grapefruity, slightly bittering hop presence. There isn't the oily or estery hoppiness in the beer, nor is it overly leafy or bittering. The hop is just so well balanced with the sweet malts and liqueur and warming alcohol notes, that the whole beer comes together just nicely. The alcohol is present but not over the top. There is a slightly oily mouthfeel and some lingering piney hop bite in the aftertaste. This is a real treat. L'Chaim."
"An unexpected find from Clipper City, this is surely the best ""Imperial ESB"" I've had -- not that I've had many -- but it's all around above average beer. Lacks brew magic, yet solid."
"D: this is one of my favorite ESB's and I find this very drinkable almost sessionable, the alcohol is very well hidden until you finish the six pack and have a decent buzz going."
"Pours a clear copper with a sudzy tan head. Smells of sweet carmel malts and faint citrus hops. Tastes is full of brown sugar and molasses up front but over the effect is well-balaced because it finishes considerably drier, with a burst of piney hops on the back end that linger. I like this beer quite a lot. In terms of drinkability, Winter Storm is dangerously good. Despite it's high abv I could keep reaching for this one all night long."
"D - Another please? A fantastic beer that I will revisit this winter and in winters to come. A little high in ABV, but it's difficult to notice."
"Notes: So well balanced. Alcohol was well hidden. A true winter beer and a fine one at that. Next time I buy six! (1/21/09-I did just that)"
"mouthfeel is of lingering hops, good malty creaminess, silky and easy to drink/session despite higher alc"
"D - I'd drink another. Not my favorite, but I'd recommend it."
"Very easy to drink and a good unique beer!"
"Overall this is a very nice winter beer. Perfect for cold nights either at sea or on land. It is quite bold, yet is still eminently drinkable. Another fine effort for Heavy Seas!!"
"Nikki"
"D - This is a nice winter beer...I'm looking forward to trying other Heavy Seas beer"
"D: I really enjoyed this ESB, but for me, this style of beer I cannot have more than 2 in a sitting It is one of my favorite ESB's though that I have tried, though I have not tried many but I will."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV, a nice heavy hitting example of the style. One of the better beers from this brewery IMO"
"Was poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. It poured a light amber/copper color with a very small head that disappeared as I drank it. The smell was of sweet hoppy notes maybe a little caramel as well. The taste was a little disappointing as it did not live up to the smell and up to imperial ESB expectations. With that said the drinkability was also average as it left a little dryness at the finish."
"	This would be beer #2 from my Thanksgiving brew pack. The label calls this beer an Imperial ESB or ""Extra Special Bitter"". I've had ESB's before in the past but never an Imperial ESB, so my interests are already peaked. I poured the beer into my crystal snifter with very little head. The color is a deep ruby, yielding to light when held up to the light. The aroma is rich with the fresh citrus and bitterness of hops, along with the roasted, mellow notes of malt. The taste is equally impressive. A good amount of bitterness provided by the hops, and keeps the aftertaste nice and clean. The malts provide a good balance of sweetness that round out the beer. The label proclaims a 7.5% ABV, which is well hidden. I would highly recommend checking this wonderful winter brew."
"I've had this beer on multiple occasions from its arrival until now, and it was enjoyable each time. And its worth purchasing - I'd call it a good value."
"poured a redish color with a large tan head that fades to a thin white lacing over the entire top, the smell is big red malt and not to be out done some hops hit my nose, the taste at first is carmel malt, dry bread and the start of the hops, the midle is the malt and hops ballincang equaly with each outher and the end flavor is a strong pine tar tipe taste, i dont know much about the stile but i like this one for sure"
"D- Pretty solid drinker, the alcohol is definitely present but it drinks pretty well. Overall, Winter Storm is a pretty solid Winter Seasonal that I wouldn't mind revisiting."
"Taste of alcohol and some citrus notes. Deep bitter aftertaste. Some licorice and dark fruit flavors. Gets better as it warms. Not too bad. Moutfeel is nice and crisp due to a decent amount of carbonation. Not a bad ESB. But wouldn't drink a ton of these due to the ABV."
"D-"
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, and the hoppiness and abv make it a little less drinkable than your typical esb, but the taste more than makes up for it. Another solid beer from the Heavy seas line."
"Yargh this here beauty is chock full of goodness. Friendly aroma not overpowering which looses a point or so with me, somewhat typical hop nose. Amazing pour, color is a very dark copper almost brown. Big fluffy tan head that has no intention of leaving. lots of stringy lacing cascading down as the beer is drunk. Mouthfeel is nice easy quenching and smooth nothing outstanding. Flavor is warming and refreshing at the same time. Hearty hop presence more bitter and citrus than evergreen. Thick malt content very surprising. A little bit of caramel is detected. Overall unexpected and absolutely enjoyable. Yargh!"
"Average."
"D: I like this one. It's kind of quirky and interesting, and it's rather drinkable considering the ABV and the fairly bold hops. Not something you'd session, but I enjoyed it a lot."
"D: This is one of the better American ESBs I've tried. It has lots of character and a well made taste."
"Notes: This is my first reviewed cask beer and I loved the presentation and mouthfeel of this beer I believe due to the fact that it was from a cask. Very cool and I think that it really enhanced the beer."
"D: Overall a tad sweet for mulitiples along with the high ABV but was generally a good experience by itself and six pack worthy for future drinkings."
"The body is moderate full but hard to pick out from the sweet finish. Overall this is too much for an ESB and with the spice characteristics I can't see how this is an ESB."
"I think I may have drank this beer a little late in the season. Everything looks good from the pour. Smells like a good ale and it looks a little cloudy. Up front the beer taste good with a notable amount of good malt and hop balance. The finish is a bit off though. I'm not sure if its the yeast giving off an odd tone at the end. I get a sweaty sock taste at the end, almost reminds me of bad tap water. It not so bad that the beer is undrinkable but doesn't make me want to drink 6 of them."
"This one pours a deep copper color under a beautifully thick and full head. Great lacing. Strong aroma of hops and alcohol, some citrus and caramel in the nose as well. Great taste: grassy hops balanced very well with a nice amount of bitterness, some malt sweetness, and a hint of alcohol, but not too much. A citrusy and lightly bitter aftertaste. Nice full mouthfeel. Would definitely have another."
"Lucky to find this on a local grocer's shelf. 5.99 for the six. ""Out of date", my ass! Awesome!"
"The first sips reveal big hops but this beer is not just a hops delivery vehicle. Although it does that quite well. It's strangely balanced with the sweet and considerable bready malt profile. Bitter herbal and citrusy hops dominate the finish and aftertaste. Their website says they use American and English hops and I believe it. Not sure I've ever tasted this combination of hops working in such balance before."
"A good, standard ESB. There is a strong, sweet, pronounced, and toasty malt presence in this beer, and it's aggressively balanced by a lot of juniper and woody hop notes. There's not much of anything going on in terms of spices or darker fruits, and the alcohol isn't ... well, it isn't ""warming," so it's not terribly festive, but it's still good for what it is."
"Easily drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden and it goes down smoothly."
"D - Another tasty big beer from Clipper City. Pretty bold with a complex hop profile. Finish is just a tad astringent, but nothing that really affects the overall enjoyment of the brew."
"This poured a clear reddish brown with off-white head. Its smell was a good malt and hops blend, and it had the solid taste of a quality IPA that I haven't had in a while. Its flavor was dominated by bitter hops but somewhat balanced by malt. I didn't sense any winter spices, however. It was thick and smooth with a nice aftertaste that was noticeable but not too strong. Overall this was a really tasty IPA, but too ""standard"" to call it a winter brew."
"D: I wrote 3.5. I remember buying this beer from a place I'd gotten several bad beers that had orange stickers on them. This one had an orange sticker, so I let it linger in the fridge for several weeks maybe several months. Well I was out of beer one night and I gently poured it and go get em dudes it was A mo fuckin ok!"
"Pour me another! Now!"
"First taste: this is a very good ESB. English-hop bitterness prevails up front and a malty, syrupy, sweetness works its way around the outskirts of the palate. A medicinal, alcohol-rich finish pairs up with bitter, piney hops to coat the back of the throat and leave a lasting aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with a low carbonation level that I'd expect with the high ABV. This is not exactly the most drinkable beer, as it sits heavy in the stomach and gives the palate a hefty workout. However, I could see this staving off the cold with the best of winter warmers and imperial stouts. Good complexity, great flavor, and one I'll definately be having again."
"Winter Storm pours a clear amber with a nice thick head. The aroma is sweet with caramel and citrus. The flavor is crisp with tastes of dark crystal and plenty of citrusy, spicy and earthy hops. Some light alcohol comes through in the end along with some dark fruitiness."
"A must try, i really like it i wish i could get more in depth about it, when i drink this beer i def don't feel the 7.5% its just that good."
"My kind of IPA, the malts play a heavier role than average, creating a nice balance that enhances drinkability, which makes up for the average complexity."
"I let it warm a bit since my fridge is cold - glad I did. Got a full dose of the caramel sweetness, herbal hoppiness and some faint ripe fruit right off the bat. Strong with great balance, like a well-forged blade. Has substance without being to syrupy. The alcohol, for 7.5%, is well-hidden without being concealed by too big a taste, and just adds to the complexity. It actually provides a tad bit of throat warmth during the final sips like a winter warmer/ESB hybrid should. And a well-done one at that."
" This beer is not a superstar. It doesn't scream for attention, but it's no slouch either. At over seven per cent alcohol, it should be treated with respect. Winter Storm does live up to the legacy of its style though, an easy drinker for daily use. Heavy Seas' habit of making ""imperial"" classics is really paying off for me, and Winter Storm works as smooth drinking delicious beer."
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a light mahogany color, with an off-white/slightly tan head, that leaves decent lacing. Sweet aroma of prunes, figs and molasses. Tons of flavor up front, sweet immediately then the hops take over for the finish. Tastes of dried fruits with a floral garden finish. Warm and thick mouthfeel, mild carbonation. Very smooth for a 7.5% imperial ESB."
"Plenty of carbonation, and plenty dry finish to make it drinkable, would say sessionable except for the 7.5%."
"This pours an almost clear reddish-orange with a dirty white frothy head. Lacing is very good. The smell at first is very similar to Sierra Nevada pale ale with some piny and earthy hops coming through. With more time you get a big pale and caramel malt presence. At the first sip the hops hit pretty hard- again, earthy and a bit citrusy, fading into a caramel or melanoidin sweetness at the end. That starts to dominate as you get a bit numb to the hops. The general feeling is that this is a very tasty and easy drinking ESB. I've never had an imperial ESB, but this kicks up both flavors- the hops and malt- to something a bit more intense but yet still balances them very nicely. Towards the end of the glass you pretty much enjoy a more malty beer as the hop presence has lessened. The mouthfeel is slightly slick. This is a type of beer I could find myself having a few of and not getting tired of it."
"D - Damn fine ale, I could tip these as long as you keep poppin them in front of me, given that I can still stand."
"This is definatly not an instant classic in my eyes but still good none the less. The hops flavor is too overpowering, in fact thats about all you taste."
"I anticipated this beer to be amazing, but after trying it I think it's awful. I guess its just another heavy thick beer I can't handle."
"The taste on first sips gives me a very large caramel malt flavour and some alcohol. A few more sips in and the hops take their place with both grass and grapefruit and some earthy flavour is there as well. It has a medium mouthfeel and it finishes with a healthy dose of grass. A pretty good sipper here but I think the alcohol isn't as well hidden as in other brews of similar abv. Too much warming in the throat."
"I wasn't expecting an ESB for a winter seasonal, but I'll take it. This brew pours a cloudy copper with a foamy, long-lasting white head that sticks to the glass. I get mostly malt in the aroma, semi-sweet caramel, with a bit of piney hops mixed in, but nothing overpowering. Malt takes over in the taste, with some bitter citrus tacked on to make this a true bitter. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. A solid brew to come in from the cold for."
"D- i like big beer. the heavy seas line sure has it down and i will try my damndest to sample every one! so far, small craft warning and winter storm have hit it off w me in a major way."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden amber/orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, hoppy, slight citrus/pines, and lots of caramel. The taste is bitter, malty, hoppy, tones of citrus/pines, and caramel. The finish is bitter and dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, one of the best I've had from CC, recommended, Thanks Steve and Eric."
"Very nice beer, at least on cask. Any other format and I wouldn't get it, but on cask this is a beer I quite appreciate and enjoy."
"M/D: A nice medium mouthfeel, carbonation is just right, alcohol is apparent but nothing harsh. Drinkability is nice as well. Really a well done beer."
"D: I really like this beer. Too bad it can't be winter all the time. I could have a couple of these with a good nor'easter blowing in."
" Finish is long and dry with a nice evergreen aftertaste that hangs on tightly to the back of the tongue. Very nice, un spiced and hoppy winter ale."
"Clipper City (B'more) is quickly gaining respect in my book. Especially, as others have noted, their Heavy Seas line of strong(er) ales."
""
"Pours a barely cloudy rich copper color, great amount of caramel colored head. Aroma is really nice for an ESB, strong floral and herbal hop notes. A lot of toasty malt and whole wheat bread in there as well with a slight alcoholic touch, very pleasing. On the palate, this one is a hoppy ESB with more fresh hop flavor overplaying the malt tones. While not as bitter as an IPA, it isn't classic ESB either. An Americanized ESB a la Brutal Bitter and Hot Shot, it does have a nice rich lingering sweet malt flavor. Clipper City continues to make some nice imperial beers, would try again."
"Poured a surprisingly good appearance. Long lasting thick off-white head with generous amounts of lacing. Very strong hop aroma with a hint of a thick malt note. I can't beleive this brew is 7.5% ABV. I've been drinking them all week and haven't even noticed. Thin lacing circles the glass. The color is a cloudy amber. Very bitter one-sided taste that leaves a long dry bitter after taste. Overall this is very good and perfect for the long cold winter months.I think they should make the name of this brew more clear. I didnt know if it was called Winter Storm, Heavy Seas, or Category 5"" Ale. Alcohol is well-hidden, but is surely there after half the glass was down. Would of liked to see a touch more carbonation on the mouthfeel."
"I've become charmed a bit by Clipper City's Heavy Seas series. I've yet to have one in the family that I didn't care for. It's also great to have a Winter ale that isn't loaded up with tons of spices (not that I mind spiced Winter ales). Basically, if you want to change the pace a bit on a cold winter's night, this might fix what ails ya (pun intended, of course)."
"D- a decent beer if you like strong a strong malt/hop beer."
"Overall it's decent brew and I'll drink it again. ESBs aren't my favorite style but this one's decent. Nice company for a winter night."
"Nice smell, but the hops (which I normally would welcome - as I did on the smell) seem out -of -whack here. The noticeable alcohol and tannic finish slow this one down. Not bad, but wouldn't be among my top choices for a winter beer."
"Served cask conditioned. I've had this one bottled before so enjoyed the opportunity to try in from the cask. Crisp floral hop aroma backed by a bit of caramel malts. The mouth feel was very smooth with a very nice piney and floral hop flavor. A very nice beer and the 7.50% ABV is well masked."
"D- Boozy and not really all that interesting to me. This is kind of rich but not all that complex."
"This beer pours a deep amber color with very little head that quickly dissapates. Hops dominate the aroma with floral and piney notes with some yeasty notes and biscuity malt notes. Taste reflects the aroma with mostly hop flavor coming out balanced with toasty malt. Moderate carbonation accentuates the hops without making the beer too filling. A very drinkable beer that is more hoppy than many of the amber winter beers, which I find as a welcome change to many of the malt balanced beers."
"smooth beer, not to hoppy not too bland. alcohol is well hidden. not too much of a winter beer by definition, but tasty. id definately pick this one up in case form if i ever saw it."
"Overall a very nice ale and worth a try"
"A pleasant and very flavorful ESB."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this is a very smooth and easy drinking brew."
"Pours a clear amber color with a nice, off-white head that retains wonderfully. Great lacing left behind with each sip. Smells of floral hops and sweet malts, maybe a little bready aromas too. Tastes of sweet malts and lots of hoppiness. This is definitely an imperial ESB. Almost like a hopped up red ale but different malt bill. Not too much depth but very good taste nonetheless. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, finishing a bit dry. I wouldnt call this a session beer as it's fairly strong @ 7.5% ABV, but I would enjoy a few of these. Not bad at all."
"The firm malty character of an ESB is here, but it's slapped upside the head by the hops. The brewery dubs it an ""Imperial ESB"". Whatever, this is one beer where style categorization isn't necessary...it needs to be enjoyed for what it is."
"Pours a clean copper/ amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops. In the taste, again grapefruity hops, with a nice malt backing to it. A bitter mouthfeel, with a dry grapefruity hop aftertaste. Big hops, yet a nice balance as well. I don't know if it is such a ""winter beer", but it is very nice."
"i read some other reviews, and i can't remember if they changed the label this year or what, but it says right on the bottle that it is an imperial esb, not an ipa or dipa. i don't know about all this imperial stuff, but it seems more like an esb to me than anything, so i'm judging it as so. pretty clear, deep, dark amberish with an off white head that fades away pretty quickly but leaves some good lace in its wake. sweet, biscuity, bready malt character and bitterish hops dominate the nose. a little bit of a roasty scent and some fruit as well. hops seem to play more of a role in the taste, but the balance is pretty good, followed by a bitter finish. hops and yeast coupled with the 7.5 abv make for a nice, spicy, warming finish as well. medium full body. i'm not going crazy over this one, but i'm really enjoying myself at the same time. i can't wait to try this on cask. clipper city is good about making their brews available around here on cask, and they've always been nothing short of fantastic. keep it up cc."
"D. Very drinkable, but lose the car keys first. The abv is well hidden but it catches up."
"This is a good one from Clipper City, part of their Heavy Seas series, which are generally of the stronger variety. This one is labeled as an ESB on the site, however I don't think this one is actually an ESB. The ESB style is usually about balance, which I don't think is achieved when dry-hopping is involved. I would call this an American Pale Ale before I called it an ESB. Maybe the malts are a little more pronounced than other APAs, but it's still not balanced. That being said, it's a good beer, whether it's an APA or ESB. Recommended."
"D - This a pretty good brew could be a session beer it has a good taste and smooth"
"Pours a dark orange ruby color with an off white head. The smell is somewhat sweet, with malty tones, and some hop presence. The taste is good, the malt is huge and the hops hold their own here as well. It starts somewhat sweet with all the malty tones and finishes bitter. A strong bitter aftertaste lingers. A good balance in flavor so many flavors come through from the malt. The mouthfeel is decent, smooth with good carbonation. This one is great, cannot even tell that is 7.5% AVB. I could see having more than a few in one sitting. This one is definitely worth checking out."
"This is a ramped-up ESB alright. Big and sweet in the nose with all sorts of fruit, and then lip-smackingly dry and hoppy when it hits your mouth. What a fine beer this is. A great winter warmer, but honestly I could drink this year round. I think this beer is better each time I try it."
"Mouthfeel is good with medium low carbonation that makes it all taste so creamy. I could drink this one all the time--it actually reminds me a bit of an IPA, but really balanced. I was simply floored by this--an amazing offering from heavy seas and something different for winter."
"A very nice ESB, one I plan to stock up on."
"I will definitely buy more of this ESB. I'm going to try to brew it, too. Drink up!!"
"The IPA is another easy drinker, but this is my brewers' choice."
"Good beer from Clipper City. A very good brewery indeed."
"This beer was dark orange, and decent looking. Smelled like nothing and tasted weird. I guess I dont understand the point of an imperial ESB, why not just make a good ESB? Why does everything have to be ""Imperial""? It tasted alcoholic and sweet. This beer was not my bag."
"D: This is a very good ESB, not sessionable by any means but very balanced and drinkable nontheless."
"Much better than the ""uber pils""."
"Bottle says best by May 2007, hopefully this is still good! Served in my new Sam Adams Boston Lager glass (thanks to SA and BA), the beer pours a brown/red color with a thick off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. It smells like pine and spicy hops, and also some sweet malt. The taste is very hoppy, like pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel and toasted malt. Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, and is a bit syrupy and chewy. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and smooth. I'm impressed with this beer, I wish I would have bought more of it. Another customer at the beer store I purchased this at recommended it, and I'm glad I listened to him. A very nice brew, I'll make sure to buy more of this in the future."
"I would prefer."
"Still... Drinkable? Oh yeah! I wish I had more than the 3 that came in my mixed case! Hell yeah! Love it!"
"Drinkability- Rated it a bit higher because it tasted really good, even though it wasn't exactly to style. Maybe a pale ale would have been better."
"D- Very impressive. Yet another above average beer from the Heavy Seas Variety case. Definitely worth trying."
"Floral aromatics, with light hop finish with a bready/bisquity backbone. Alcohol is well concealed, but you won't find the need to pound it either. Balanced & well-crafted. Recommended."
"Deep ruby red color, milky tan head that subsides after a minute or two into a small, blotchy dusting. Slight carbonation. The aroma is slightly malty with an overriding dirty/spicy hop affect. Piny hop resin and a very hidden chocolate malt smell. Overall I didn't like the taste of this beer. Its all big hops with very little balance. It leaves a parched, bitter feeling and it accumulates throughout the drink. Not my kind of beer."
"This brew poured a nice amber orange hue almost ruby in color when back lit. Freshness date marked on the label. Creamy tan colored head the dissipated but still left a nice layer of head on the top. Good lacing down the pint glass. Smell is malty with hints of caramel and maybe some toffee. There were mild hints of hop oil in the mix of scents clinging in my nostrils. Subtle alcohol esters play in the nose as well. Taste is quite malty with slight roasted malt or barley tones. There was a nice mild dry hop finish highlighted with some alcohol esters. This brew certainly has a smooth malty flavor making it very drinkable and enjoyable. There is also good mouth feel and a nice body to this beer. I would try this offering again. I really could enjoy this Imperial ESB. I am sure it is even better on tap."
"This is one of the better winter ales I've had. Many have too much of a spice flavor and just don't have any more complexity."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied and a bit chewy. Pretty drinkable though. I don't know if I'd go so far as to say it's a session beer. But, I could drink a few of these. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. Certainly worth a try."
"The beer poured a nice crisp amber with a thin head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was nicely balanced between caramel malts and earthy hops. The taste was also nicely balanced. There was a great hop bitterness that danced with the sweetness very well. The beer was medium bodied and the alcohol was very well hidden. This is a very enjoyable beer that does not need to be classified as a winter beer, today was a warm spring day, and I still enjoyed it."
"A touch of hot alcohol is noticeable at times, but it is fairly hidden and seems to be brought out a bit by the sharp, herbal hop notes. This is quite an impressive hop focussed beer. I am really quite pleased by the quality of the two hop monster's I have had from this brewery."
"D- It is pretty tasty but nothing to go crazy over. I think they hit what they were trying to go for with the imperial ESB I just wish they would of went with some different hops."
"Mouthfeel is good, so is the carbonation. Aftertaste is semi-dry with a good shot of bitterness. Clipper City has never disappointed me with their Heavy Seas line. A sixer of this wouldn't be a chore at all."
"D: This one isnt bad for an ESB. Good balance which showcases the flavors well."
"good drinkability, nothing overpowers or wears you out. not strictly an ESB by definition, but really quite a well crafted tasty beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation, and a great drinkability. If this were available near me, I would make it a regular in the beer fridge for the winter months."
"Overall a very good ESB, one of the best I've tasted. I prefer the extra hops which tasted very fresh."
"Serving Type: 12oz bottle poured into Koenigs Hoeven goblet"
"Just like the style guidelines, the ""imperial?' ESB pours nice dark copper color with very little head and just a tad bit of carbonation. Smells of fresh hops immediately, followed by esters. The malts do not seem to balance the hoppiness to this one. A bit hot, especially since more ESB are much lower in alochol. Warms the belly, but nothing too great."
"Just above average. I would like to pair this one with a pulled pork sandwich. Nothing great to look for in the style, but worth it as part of the mixed pack."
"Clear reddish body with a off white head that fell fast.Hops in the nose.Hops are the first taste but the malt keeps them from jumping out at ya.Its a pleasent taste.This stuff is a bit thin but good, im not complaing.I have never had a bad Clipper Seas offering.Its great to taste that the East Coast still has it as far as brewing.Kudos to Clipper Seas."
"Brown, bronze color. Nice head that leaves sticky lacing. Minimal carb bubbles but that fits the style. Smell is very pronounced hop bitterness, much more than expected in an ESB. Also some diactyl that creeps in under the ESB. Taste follows suit, the hops dominate and there just isn't enough malt balance. A little thin on the mouthfeel which may explain the lack of balance. Not a terrible beer but it really dosn't fit the style. Almost more of a barleywine than an ESB."
"Overall: Decent, but needs more balance between the malts and hops."
"A commendable attempt at an ESB, but it begs for a bit more balance, body and malts to balance the hop bitters."
"Thick head of medium to small off white bubbles. Amber/brown color, with particles in suspension. Aroma is of burnt brown sugar and a hint of spice cake. Some piney hops as well. Taste is mostly earthy hops with just enough caramel malt to let you know its there. Aftertaste is a pleasant lingering pine bitterness. Nice beer. Would not guess this is 7.5%. Thanks Hugh!"
"Porus a clear copper, some reddish hues, thick off white head forms, sticks nicely, very persistent, looks really good. Smell is sweet, some toffee, nice citrus/floral hops, bit of vanilla and chocolate, some yeast, very nice. Taste is odd, malty caramel, citrus, floral, mint? WTF! Weird astringent minty flavour. Spicy, very interesting, almost tingly mouthfeel. Medium body, low carbonation, alcohol warming, not sure what to think. I like the concept."
"A drinkable beer when consuming a couple in a sitting. Any more would be too much for me."
"Overall-this is a exceelnet beer. Although it may be hopper than the definition of balanced, for me it strikes a great ""balance"" of malt to hop. Fine selection, whihc I am sure I will buy myself again"
"D- This beer has a big hops that overpower the malts a bit but both are big fresh flavors. This is a strong ESB and the best, and only, Imperial ESB, I have had."
"I should admit though, I do like the concept of an ""Imperial ESB"" for these cold, Canadian months and while it failed to really captivate me, it seemed to do the trick all the same..."
"Extra malted and hopped ESB that has aroma of alcohol along with a bit of hop and malt aroma, is a bit on thin of mouthfeel and has cloudy orangey colour, but taste pretty good. Very dry finish and aftertaste. Could pass as a bit of a strong ale,more so than an IPA. thanks Dr.Jay."
"For me, one of the best winter beers i've had this year. It has alittle of everything I like in a quality, full bodied beer. Great job!!"
"I guess i could session this during a long winter storm, although here in PA we're getting pounded by 60 degree weather and rain (ah its early january), well at least this winter storm is still kicking."
"Pours a rich Frangelico amber with some light suspension throughout the whole brew. There is a good one and a half finger head at the start that semi0gradually recedes to and asymetrical film of foam. The arom is of carmalized hops. Not a whole lots of malt for an English style beer. The taste is just as hoppy. I was expecting some more mlaty sweetness and some X-mas flavors as well But alas. This was an ok beer. Glad I tried it. But the palate was a bitter dry."
"Bottle courtesy of Aprilluvsbeer."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and flavorful."
"Thanks to Enola for the bottle."
"Drinkability is ok not a bad ale decent flavors but not something I would purchase for myself but again not bad. One beer that my score doesn't seem to make sense. Thanks go to Enola for this sample."
"Fairly drinkable, with a nice flavor, but nothing remarkable."
"This is a big ESB; nearly approaching strong ale strength and flavors. Begins with a piney-sweet, malty-spice aroma that captured clean fermentations aromas, citrus, and pecans. Flavors begin and remain with a strong balance of barley malt and assertive hops (I think they may have sneaked in an American hop or two). Remains strong well into the finish. Body is heavy for the style which hurts the drinkability, but the access flavors I find pleasant and bold. Almost minty fresh in the finish with a mild drying, partly from alcohol, partly from hops. You'll likely find this brew in my fridge until they disappear from the shelves."
"This beer is a nice looking ESB. The color is a nice reddish orange. There is a small head and little lacing. The smell is very hoppy and bitter. Citrus fruit is also noted. The taste is very hoppy and bitter. There is just a bit of off-key flavors in the taste. The mouthfeel is very bitter and sticky. The bitterness lasts for a while. The drinkability is good. I could enjoy this brew on occasion."
"Good beer. I really tend to like this style even though it's one I often overlook."
"IMHO, one of the better offerings from Clipper City, and a heck of a winter beer. A little age might improve it if it takes the edge off the ABV, but, then again, it could screw up the balance the hops provide. Overall, I like it, even if I am a little unclear on the imperial ESB thing."
"the drinkability is straight up great. This is a fine brew all around Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"D - As I previously mentioned, the bartender 'warned' me of the hoppiness of this selection, but I feel I must explain on her behalf. We were discussing how we expect most Christmas/holiday selections to be more on the spiced-ale end of the spectrum, and this really doesn't fit those (i.e. Harpoon Winter Warmer). This really is a very pleasant winter brew as it does differ from the rest of the spicy alternatives. Very good selection."
"The dominant hop presense and high alcohol content can make this a little tougher to drink. Was drinking this from a SN Celebration glass and I gotta admit I was a little confused."
"I don't know that I've had many other imperial ESBs but even without the semantics I don't feel that this beer if very true to its English roots. I really believe that the ESB is going the way of the IPA and becoming Americanized and this beer is an example of why I would think that."
"Aggressively poured into an Ename chalice, the Winter Storm Category 5 is a deep orangish mahogany with a thick, creamy tan head, that subsided fairly quickly but remained across the the top of the beer til the end. It left a very nice, sticky lace. The aroma is fairly one dimensional, bright and floral cascade hops, that leads me to assume this is dry-hopped. The taste is much more balanced, with a wider range of hops then is evident from the aroma, some pine and grass. Still, it has the rich malt taste one would expect from an ESB, with some caramel and bread notes. There is little indication of the ABV, and the finish is pleasantly bitter, especially if your a hop-head, although you needn't be to appreciate this brew. The mouthfeel on this one is nice, rich and creamy but at the same time an undeniable sharpness from the hops, resulting in a well balanced feel that can easily lead one to drink more of these then they realize. Overall I think this an excellent interpretation of an ESB/winter warmer, in the more extreme manner that has become standard for many American microbrews."
"M&D - the sweet edge gives it a smooth mouthfeel, with a great balance and finish, the clipper city sailor themed series have all been pretty good, will be too bitter for some though"
"My first offering from Clipper City, I've been eyeing them for awhile now and never took the plunge until now. This winter offering pours a dark brown leaving a thick tan frothy head. the aroma is hoppy, caramel, sweet dark fruit. The taste is very hoppy, but balanced by a nice malt backbone that is highlight by a toffee sweetness that is followed by a definitive alcohal presence. I think this needs a bit more balance overall and the alcohal presence is far to great for only a 7.5% beer which can be overwhelming."
"Overall: I don't feel this is a very balanced ESB. I think it leans too much toward the hop end of the spectrum. That said, I do like it and would recommend it for hop lovers. It has an exquisite nose, and IMO lets down a bit in the taste and mouthfeel, but nonetheless is a very solid, above average offering from Clipper City."
"Part of a make your own sixpack. I knew nothing about this beer or brewery when I bought it. Poured a beautiful ruby/amber with one finger head. Smelled of grassy and citrus hops and malt. This is a perfectly balanced beer I wish I could get year round. An Americanized version of an ESB. I guessed this one correctly after tasting it seems. Wished I bought more!"
"This one will catch up to you fast if you''re not careful because it's so well balanced although the aftertaste will start to carry alcohol by the end of the first one. Either way, I congratulate myself on a quality selection and the boys in B-more for another tasty, different, brew."
"To think this great stuff is brewed right in my back yard in Baltimore and I haven't tasted it until now. Well you can be sure I'll be going out of my way to find more of this stuff. Highly recommended."
"Lovely to drink. Would like to have a few of these. Medium bodied for a winter beer, alcohol is definately pleasent but seems to fit well with the spice."
"I am impressed by this winter offering from Clipper City. The beer is a hefty, ruby colored ESB that smells of thick, toasty and biscuity malts. You can also pick up a heavy dose of hops in this one. The taste is quite a big gulp of malts and hops. The maltiness seems to be very powerful, but not overly sweet. The hops make the sweetness subdued and you are left with a great winter ale. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and thick...which I consider a positive for a winter offering. Drinkability is great. Just watch as the alcohol creeps up on you."
"D - Easy to drink. A bit strong to session, but otherwise you really could. This is not an ESB. It is far too hoppy. It is more akin to an American IPA (possibly double) IMO. No matter what it is, it is damn good. This is the last of CC's Heavy Seas line I have needed to try. I love Heavy Seas, they really need to expand it."
"this one i would recommend to anybody nice seasonal beverage"
"Pours a nice amber, tan head with excellent retention,and lacing. Smell is of sweet carmel malts, with a hint of hops. Body is medium with carbionation. Taste is sweet malt up front,with a earthy,hoppy finish. Alchol is evident in the finish, and after taste. Good stuff!!"
"Flavors are well balanced and big enough to keep things interesting. Alcohol is well hidden. A very solid offering from Clipper City."
"Aroma of sweet malt and fresh citrus hops. Flavor is intially malty, biscuity with brown sugar and cinnamon, a little bit of smoke. This morphs quickly to a slightly sweet citrus hop with piney background notes. A grapefruit peel bite lingers, as does some alcohol warmth. Good balance of malt and hops. Full and rich mouthfeel, an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"I really liked this beer as I did most of the other samples. If you like a certain style and they make it, it is worth a try. I'll be buying this one again"
"This looked fantastic, but everything else was rather average. Poured a brown chestnut colour with a nice looking soapy head with lots of froth and plenty of nice sticky lacing. Nice. I felt the smell was rather average, quite honestly. Well balanced with a malty presence, but dominated by hops. I would assume this to be a Winter Warmer, but it is indicated here as an ESB. I feel if this *is* in fact an ESB, they did a decent job at keeping with the style. Plenty of malt in the taste, but a nice, bitter, hoppy finish. Not an amazing concoction, but it certainly wasn't a bad ale."
"With regard to my initial review, I'm somewhat troubled by other reviewers of this beer who seem to have just accepted that it was a DIPA per BA's initial (and apparently incorrect) description of it as such, or accepted the ""pure hop power"" propaganda of the brewery, and reviewed it based on this. I'm not going to call anyone out by handle/name, but please: those of you who raved, or even approved, of this beer as a DIPA, try a few good examples of the style, and then re-review. (Suggestions: Pliny the Elder, Great Divide Hercules, Rogue I2PA, AleSmith YuleSmith, etc.)"
"drinkability would be higher if this were a better tasting brew."
"Drinkable and tasty, a nice offering from Clipper City."
"single bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"are no weird x-mas spices. Maybe a small hint of clove? Such an array of fruits like plum,raisins,orange rine. And the finish leaves a single malt scotch taste (Glen Morenge 12 year) mixed with a hint of earl grey tea!"
"Overall, this was a robust, flavorful winter-marketed beer that stands out because it doesn't contain the festive additives so alluring to brewers at this time of year. I tend to drink this style of beer 9-10 months out of the year so the winter classification doesn't matter. Just a good DIPA, if I've ever had one."
"its an okie beer. there are much better examples."
"Drinkability: I like this version much better than last year's; the style has departed from the norm and this Imperial ESB concept is intriguing and enjoyable"
"This beer pours a pretty chestnut red color with a small quarter inch head that lingers in the glass. Aroma: piney, resiny hops along with some citrus and sweet malts in the nose. Taste: spicy hops, grapefruit, peach and apricot flavors balanced with a good bit of caramel malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied on the palate. Drinkability is good and makes for a well balanced brew. I don't know why this beer was entered as a DIPA. This is an ESB in my opinion."
"Best by date of march 07, this beer pours a deep amber with a thin tan head that retains ok and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is intensely hoppy, with big citrus, pine and floral character upfront, along with caramel and toasted bread, and a touch of alcohol. The flavor again packs a serious hop character, with big grapefruit and pine taste, as well as some floral hop notes, intense caramel flavor and slight sweetness, toasted bread, some fruity esters and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth with light carbonation and drinkability is good despite the ABV. The description on the bottle calls this beer an ""imperial ESB"" and that seems more apropriate than a DIPA, with the big malty backbone...whatever it is, it's kickass."
"The mouth is medium-bodied, well-carbonated, warm, and complex, yet still lively with fruit and citrus lightening it up a bit. Despite it's prodigious complexity and substantial ABV, it is still very drinkable. Very solid overall, even if it lacks in hop characters compared to most beers in this category."
"Mouthfeel is full and rich but somewhat unpleasant hop feel. A easily drinkable beer for a winter seasonal."
"I went camping last night and kept company around the fire with my Winter Storm as the wind howled through the trees on the mountaintop. This reminds me of an ESB but more hops and alcohol. Everything is in good balance - malt-hops-alcohol. It is a little chewy but gently robust in its easy drinkin (for a hop head) mouthfeel and finish. I would do it again fer sure. Not a session beer ok?"
"Thanks Aprilluvsbeer for this sample in our trade."
"12oz brown bottle with best before March 07 on label. Pours a medium brown/amber with a one finger head, nice longevity and very nice lace. Malts are present but hop floralness predominates with hints of pine and citrus. Again malts are present, but hops define this beer. For such a young double IPA it is smooth and creamy. Hints of grapefruit and pine. Seems a bit mild as a DIPA - that is to say I expected a much more hop domination. Dont get me wrong, hops do dominate and it is a very well made and tasty beer I just don't think its a DIPA - perhaps a IPA?"
"(Can you tell this was written with the World Series on in the background?)"
"D: Another winner for the ""Heavy Seas"" division of Clipper City's offerings. I'm glad they've made their way to Mass as I really like their interpretations of each style. Slightly high abv goes undetected."
"Still, a fine beer, pretty darned drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"This is a hoppy, hoppy brew. The weird part was, it looked like a winter warmer and smelled like a balance brew but wasn't. Was overly unbalanced toward the hoppy side with tons of delicious flavors going on. Smelled almost like Old Jubilation and looked similar to it too. Left terrific amounts of lacing and is a beautiful looking beer. I would never refuse this one, but I wouldn't seek it out either."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and full. A bit chewy with good bubbles. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew that just failed to really excite me. Not something I'd go out of my way to seek out, your mileage may vary."
"Overall a nice experience. Not mind-blowing, but nicely done and enjoyable."
"12 oz bottle. Beer pours a deep copper color with amber hues and a half finger of off white head over top that falls to a full coat over top. Clarity is very good, and a moderate carbonation is bubbling from the bottom of my glass. Smell is okay. Solid piney and earthy hop notes dominate, with a ligher citrusyness overlays a nice caramel base with lighter notes of toasty malt. I like it. Flavor is pretty well married with the aroma. Earthy hop flavors dominate with toasty melanoidan malt melding well with it. Solid caramel is in there as well, along with a lighter citrusy hop character. There is just a moderate hop bitter on the finish. I don't think this one quite ranks up there in the DIPA category as far as flavor goes. Things are just not bold enough. Feel is on the heavy end of moderate, with a nice moderate carbonation. It works well for the brew I think. This one is pretty drinkable. ABV is at the lower end of IIPA's, and its just not doing anything to draw me in. Its not bad by any means, but its not necessarily what I want in an IIPA."
"Drinkability: Winter Storm is not your typical, big hop bomb DIPA. It has a healthy malt backbone that evens out the subtle hoppiness of the beer. Alcohol is well hidden which makes it an easy drinker. Not quite as good as Loose Cannon in my opinion but still a quality beer from Clipper City. Worth seeking out."
"Nice light orange amber color with a tight white head. Smells of pine and citrus with a underlying malt backbone. It is a touch more fruity than I would have thought from the smell and the alcohol jumps out more than I remember it. Still very piney and a decent balanced IPA. Good mouthfeel and a nice mix between a sipper and a pounder. There are better DIPA's out there like the Clipper City Loose Cannon."
"Probably much better fresh."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and roasted malts along with a bitter hop aroma. There seems to be good balance in the aroma. The hops compliment a darker malt bill, but lose some of their aromatic character. The taste is decent also. It has a very bitter hop flavor that comes at you hard and stays with you through the finish. The malt bill warms you, but it loses the balance and finishes empty. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This seems better suited as a full bodied beer. This is a pretty good beer, but it could use some tweeking. The hops roar, but it needs more body. Still, a decent drinker."
"My first St. Patty's day beer of the day.Poured a rich deep copper with a tight 1/2 finger head that left a light sheet of lace behind as it settled,big dose of herbal hop in the nose somewhat grassy with a noticable caramel malt note underneath.Not a bitter double IPA by any means and well balanced piney and herbal hop notes over top a big sweet caramel malt base the alcohol seems to really come in play as it warms in the finish.This is not an in your face hopped up double IPA just a well balanced big hopped brew,I liked it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Excellent texture... small foamy mouthfeel, active enough to support the malts and hops. The beer itself overall is oversteeped and overhopped for the style, and for a winter beer, it could use a lot more balance from the malts."
"Poured a copper color with a white head that left behind intense lacing. Aromas of malt, honey, and hops; not as diverse as might be expected. The taste was flavorful with a mild sweetness upfront followed by a stronger hop flavor that grows into the finish. Much sweeter than might be expected for this style, almost liek a barley wine. The hops just were not as dominant and everpresent as I would have liked, especially for this style. Quite tame and mild, but still enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Certainly a solid Double IPA for me, and one I will be drinking again. At 7.5% it's between the possible point of no return and ""Well, I'll have another one I suppose," which also makes it attractive as a session beer."
"This beer poured a dark golden color with a medium tanish head that disapated rather quickly. There was some good lacing down the side. The aroma is of some floral hops but not as intense as I would expect for a double IPA. There was also the smell of lemon and a touch of malt character. Overall pleasing. The taste of hops is a bit more intense than what I smelled and it also is a bit peppery. This beer has a medium body that is enjoyable and never gets too heavy."
"Drinkabilty: this does not overwhelm the tastebuds, and several of these can be quaffed in a session. Not great, but enjoyable and worth seeking out."
"This very drinkable strong IPA, strong enough to numb your tongue this just doesn't taste that strong. This is in the same class as a dry English bitter in pleasantness to drink."
"Bottle provided by higravity, via SS'05. Thanks for the opportunity. Pours a one-finger tan head over a nearly clear bright orange liquid. Smells pith hoppy. Sharply...it almost stings. Some pine and a hint of oranges. Tastes grapefruit and oranges. Dry. Nice toasty character and a late tangerine. Woody dry finish. Amarillo goodnesss. A bit of oil on the flat of the tongue. Not overly bitter, but a nice lupulin bite. Md-light body and moderately carbonated. Very drinkable as an IPA, but falls short in body for a DIPA."
"This is a serious beer from these skallywags(pirate humor). This is a little different than I expect for a WW, but infact, it does warm the chest. The high alcohol and hoppy taste, probably is the main factor. Whatever it is, it works out great, not having either characteristic overpowering the other. For a stronger beer, I think it's well balanced and goes down easy. A little too easy, which is why it could be dangerous. If ye drink too much of this grog, ye better watch ye booty!"
"12 oz. bottle with a purchase before APR 06 notch on the label. Much appreciated. Pours a slightly hazy amber color. Thick creamy, fluffy off-white head. Great head retention. Good amount of patchy lace is left on the sides of the glass as this disappears. Citrusy and floral hop aroma hits you right away in the nose. Hop flavor jumps out right away, followed by some caramel malt. Floral, citrusy, and piney hop flavor. Bitterness is not overwhelming. Medium body, low carbonation. Very enjoyable and well balanced. This doesn't seem to be a typical hop monster DIPA, but it is tasty."
"For a double IPA, this beer wasn't as pulverizing as I expected. Which isn't a bad thing. The bitterness is nicely balanced, making it go down easy. It did have the typical IPA characteristic of leaving my mouth very dry, though. Also featured the typical dark amber color of highly hopped beers, with a frothy head. I enjoyed this beer somewhat, but it is not my favorite of Clipper City's Heavy Seas line. I just didnt find it unique enough to really try it again."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Benji went for the kill on this one. Really dug it. Peaches wasn't in the beer mood. More for the guys, WOO-HOO!"
"Dark gold, tarnished brass with an off-white head and some stickiness. Plenty of tiny-bubbled carbonation. Smell is mild hops and a smooth malty odor. Taste is a fine blend of grainy malts, floral hops and some sweet notes. Mouthfeel is medium with a medium body. Drinkability is fine for the style. High ABV keeps it from being sessionable. Enjoyable."
"[This brew was from a recent trade with meathookjones but I'm pretty sure I got another bottle in a trade a month or so ago... I sure hope I have another bottle. I've got to go check my stock to see if I've got more of this. Maybe I'll arrange another trade soon to get another couple Winter Storms. Maybe I'll just move to Baltimore so I can have this year round... Dang this is a very tasty brew!]"
"S -"
"This is an easy drinking DIPA, although it seems more like just an IPA."
"Orange/apricot colored body with a one inch off-white head. Aroma is very light. A touch of citrus and some grassy hop aromas, not much else. Taste is mainly hop dominated, but not overly bitter. Hops are floral and citrus in nature. There is a bit of an herbal side to the hops in this brew. Needs more malts to fill this out; a bit unbalanced. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, not overly thick and oily like I feel it should be. Drinkability is good though. Worth a taste...a reasonable DIPA."
"Deep amber in color, very clear with a decent tan head. Nice lace left on the side of the glass as I drink. Lots of citrus grapefruit and hay in the aroma with a light caramel back. Taste is a balance of grapefruit and a light sweetness of caramel and toffee. The hay present in the aroma is gone in the flavor. Richer and heavier mouth feel than the IPA I had from these guys last week, more body, but less balance. Good drinkability as the beer hides the alcohol well."
"I think if the English were to make a DIPA, this might be it. Pours a deep coppery color; nose has some leafy hops and lemon twinge. Nicely hopped, but not the fresh raw oily sticky hoppiness found in so many American double's; this is more relaxed, some crushed pinecone and tree sap here to balance a big biscuity malt middle. Carbonation is light and balanced. Finishes with some icy sweet cake frosting and solid slap of bitterness. Alcohol hides well, but is noticeable in the aftertaste. I'm enjoying these Heavy Seas brews more and more, and this is no exception. Pretty nice indeed."
"Pretty nice beer. Not a palate killer like many. Don't know if that is good or bad for the style. Alcohol does it's job. I've been enjoying Clipper City's brews lately and this is no exception."
"First, I have to agree that this seems much more aptly suited to live its life as an IPA, not a DIPA, but that's so much quibbling because it's a tasty beasty no matter what you label it. The hops are crisp and sassy, and never over the top, even though they did tend to hog the limelight a bit. The ABV is manageable, and it reveals itself enough to make sure you take note. Still, it's nicely drinkable, assuming moderation, and it it makes a name for itself. In fact, it could call itself sewer water and I'd still gladly come back for more."
"Medium bodied, light, fruity finish. Alcohol burn starts to show further in, but doesn't flare. Too simplistic for the style, but, beyond that, not a bad IPA at all. Very warming, inside the mouth and out."
"I had never heard of this brewery until recently but I have to say I'm impressed. Good juicy hop flavors...excellent balance. Kinda on the line between IPA and DIPA but who cares? Its a damn good beer."
"Light on the palate and in terms of abv. A unique version of the style; not aggressive enough for a hophead. Somewhere between an IPA and a Double."
"Either way, another solid offering from CC and one I will look for on tap soon enough."
" The taste is nice. I am often disappointed by IIPAs because they are not Dreadnaught. This has a more refreshing and complex flavor. This is citrusy, piney, and grassy at the same time. The flavors are layered, not just a chaotic mess like some IIPAs. If you don't taste the malt halfway through a sip, you'll miss it. It is quite fleeting. This has a slight wet hop character. The mouthfeel is ultra creamy and smoothly carbonated. Drinkable as hell, except it is my only sample."
"Drinkability: High. I'm anxious to get a six of this. Very good."
"I found the contrast between this and the sister beer quite striking. Both clock in at identical 7.5 percent ABV, but the similarities end there. The Loose Cannon is more heavily carbonated, light, highly aromatic, rather citric tasting, and not too bitter. The Winter Storm is none of these things. Maybe if I was to make a 50/50 mixture, Id get a classic DIPA."
"A clean dark amber/brown beer. Has a nice creamy beige head and good lace. There is a sweet fruity character to the aroma with some hop note floating around in there and a hint of vanilla in the background. There is a small bit of sweetness ( with fruity and vannilla notes) at the front of your mouth. But all the action takes place at the back. With a combo of roasted malt and grapefruit hops making for a well balanced finish."
"Winter Storm delivers a dark orange body beneath a frothy head of ivory foam that holds very well and leaves short walls of lace on the side of the glass. The nose displays clear, grapefruity and piney hops, but it's not overtly bold, and the flavor is very much the same way. Its lightly caramelish malt works in unison with its firm bitterness and floral/citrus/pine hop flavors to deliver a solid, well-rounded and well-balanced beer... but it doesn't hit you on the head. It does leave it quite drinkable, however, and the only thing lacking is enough complexity to keep you coming back again and again. Still, this is a solid IPA that probably deserves more attention than it gets."
"Now for the taste... a surprisingly full sweet maltiness initally, followed by an almost whiskey-like mix of alcohol and sweet grain. The hops are certainly there in the finish - long, lingering and bitter. An interesting mix of flavors, and somewhat more complexity than I was expecting. Certainly not the hop-bomb expected from a Double-IPA, with more malt character than others, which I happen to like. And while you can taste the alcohol, it's not exactly a ""big beer"" either. Not really a beer I would drink all night, but not a bad change of pace from my usual favorites. All said, a unique brew well worth trying."
"Winter Storm is sub-titled ""Category 5"" Ale. I'm going to have to downgrade it to a much less dangerous ""Category 4"". There's a lot to like, but when judged against its peers, it doesn't have enough of what makes the DIPA style hum. Namely hops. It's still mighty tasty beer. Thanks to meathookjones for the bottle."
"The finish is crisp and has good bittering. Overall, not too bad."
"The freshness date was not notched. Poured amber in color with a filmy head. Fairly high carbonation. The aroma is hops. The taste is strong in the hops, but brings to mind cleaning supplies. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated and the alcoho burn is almost uncomfortably high. I think after a couple of these beers my taste buds will be shot."
"Received as a selection of the beer of the month club Poured a deep amber color. Head was a nice white fluffy color with good retention. Smell gave a hint of the hopr to follow. Taste was superb with enough hops to make it interesting without being overpowering. Alcohol content was well hidden, This is a very enjoyable beer"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with Jul 05 freshness date. Pours a clear bright orange with a nice thick whitish heads, with very nice lacing. Nose is all hops, primarily citrusy. Medium bodied syrupy mouthfeel. Very nice amount of bitterness both upfront and in the aftertaste for fans of hops, although it is balanced out with an almost caramel malt flavor. As others have noted, this isn't a very good IIPA, but is a great tasting for a strong IPA."
"12 ouncer sampled, label has area for freshness dating, but no matter how close I look, nothing has been notched/marked, oh well. This one pours a nice glowing orangy amber, white tiny bubble head/film and respectable lacing. Nose is a citrusy/resiny blend. Barely respectable DIPA. Ratings seem high to me, as this one is sort of mushy body wise. This is a decent IPA ,but Double? C'mon get real. Could be more firm and crisp to get a higher rating from me. Does have a nice hoppy finish (not the crunch to be expected from a top DIPA however) and lots of caramel malts. This is the best offering I can recall trying from Clipper City"
"This ship rides the winter storms well with is strong body and complex nose and taste of caramel malts and a hop sail trimed to perfection. I'll ride this clipper to the ends of the earth!"
"Thanks to Dithyramb for the trade. This is either an awesome IPA or an average Double IPA. Either way it is a very good beer. Pours dark amber with a medium thin beige head. Thin speckles of lacing through the whole glass. Aroma of hops and oranges, as well as malt. Medium-bodied and hoppy, with pine and citrus flavors at the forefront. Nice malt balance too. The finish is tart and fruity with a lingering citrusy hops aftertaste. I like this beer."
"12 oz bottle pours hazy glowing amber-orange color with a thick creamy off-white head that leaves a nice lace in my glass. Sharp hoppy aroma of grapefruit and pine, resinous sticky pine and grapefruit flavors , has a full thick, sticky and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that finishes with a lingering bitterness, has a good malt balance, I need to get more."
"Extremely bright, see-through amber, a hops-dominated nose, with a massive blast of caramel, almost a burnt caramel smell, if there is such a thing! Very rich, oh so smooth and creamy; a blast of hops that will slap the palate into shape; fresh grapefruit and orange peel notes in the body, a decent warming affect as she warms, throw in some fresh baked bread tastings that slide down the hatch. Juicy and sweet hops, incredibly smooth and refreshing, a Double IPA Winter Seasonal? WOOO said the nature boy!"
"Frankly I was sort of let down by this beer. After hearing about it and having been impressed with small craft warning (also from this heavy seas line), I was expecting hoppy ipa with a strong hop aroma presence. It certainly is hoppy but sorely lacks floral hop aroma. Also, it doesn't seem to have a fruity malty backbone as most ipa's do (albeit they are more hoppy than anything else). It almost seemed like a overly hopped pilsner rather than an ale. Overall, I'd say it's just an average ipa. It's drinkable but not nearly as good as others out there."
"Pours an incredibly rich a thick deep cream colored head rising 2 fingers high above the rim of the glass. Deep golden amber color with a yeast induced haziness. The nose is fresh intense flowery hoppiness with a nice sweet biscuity malty base to it. Kick ass hop bitterness fills the mouth along with thick slightly sweet maltiness. The hops just go on and on, ending in a long drawn out finish...bittersweet, but way more bitter/dry than sweet. Not too much alcohol sensed here, this one's a winner."
"-Oelergud"
"Gave this brew a try last evening while at Mahars. Had not heard about it before so was just hoping that I picked something good to try. Well I got damn lucky, this was a nice brew. Poured to a somewhat cloudy copper color with a nice sized off white head that had pretty good retention and nice lacing. The aroma has a very pronounced citrus like hop to it, was able to get a good whiff of it just from the pour. Also can notice a caramel malt aroma that is in the background but definitely goes very well with the other scents. The taste was not dominated by the hoppy characteristics as I thought it would be. It seems to be very well balanced, definitely hoppy, no doubt about it, but the maltyness has a very strong showing. Over all this is a excellent brew, one that I will be looking for. This is my first time having a brew from Clipper City, but will have to give some of the others a try!"
"-Thanks to the blitheringidiot for giving me a bunch of these!"
"Overall, my only (slight) complaint would be that this one seems a touch thin and maybe even watery at times. Other than that, this is a flavourful IPA that I'd be more than happy to pick up again."
"Sail on, and follow that star!"
"Beer is good. Happy sorta 2IPA beering."
"($27.99 / case)"
"12 ounce bottle. The aroma was very nice and the flavor was well balanced. No particular complexity about this beer, but pure drinkability does exist. As a fan of the Heavy Seas line, I would recommend this brew, but only as a nicely drinkable Double IPA, not as an outstanding example of the style."
"Pours a nice medium copper wiht a small, fleeting light tan head. Lots of hop citrus and spice on the nose. Mild malt tones noticable, but not too strong. Hoppy palate, but not too bitter. Malt gives a good backbone. Hop citrus makes an appearance, but not overpowering. Good, lingering, slightly bitter finish. A solid IPA. Nice hop profile, with some good maltiness. Worth a try anytime."
"Pours a light copper color and a huge, fluffy beige head. Lots of hops in the nose; dried orange rind intertwined with a clove-like spiciness, and a touch of pine sap woodiness constitute the aroma. Good crystal malt backbone with some scorchy caramel notes, and lots of hops and spiciness to keep the drinker continuously interested. Very enjoyable. Carbonation is a little on the higher side, but good. Clipper City has impressed me on this one."
"Had this back to back to back with this years Hop Wallop. I was pressed to determine which was better. Overall, Id have to stick with the Hop Wallop as better, and that would only be due to the slightly more complex flavor and mouthfeel. Regardless, this is a very good beer. Winter Storm went well with several different foods and by itself. I could easily have this as a tasty session brew."
"D&N: Very nicely balanced for a double IPA. Very smooth in the mouth with enough bite to make it interesting. This is a very good beer, IMHO. Clipper City does it again."
"Appearance: Caramel amber hue big velvety cream tan colored head leaves fine intricate lacing. Aroma: Sharp grassy citrus notes very aromatic big caramel malt base wow, yep I could sit around and smell this one for awhile nice. Taste: Strong bitterness lies in the middle of a fluid balance of flavors, somewhat mild for a double IPA nowadays but very good nonetheless. Big herbal juicy hop bursts with slightly burnt citrus peel notes puckering the lips mellowed by sugary sweet caramel malts nice brew. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied evenly carbonated sugary slightly sticky texture nice. Drinkability: Excellent really drinkable DIPA so flavorful but not overbearing in anyway very nice version, probably the best beer I've had from Clipper City."
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear orange with a huge orangish white head. CO2 bubbles swarm up through the liquid to maintain the head. Aroma of cirtussy pine and yeast. Hoppy yet not overly so. The flavor is very malty with a good balance of hop flavor, yet the bitterness is a trifle bit subdued. This is very drinkable for the style. Not as assertive as some may want though, but very nice regardless."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big pillowy 2"" light beige head above the slightly cloudy, light copper brew. Laces excellently, with large chunks here, there, everywhere, and aroma is intense piney hops. Taste is initially malty, and the hops kick in, yet not as intensely as the nose led me to expect. As balanced as you'll see a DIPA, although the hops burps have already started. Mouthfeel and drinkability excellent for the style. Check it out if hops are your thing."
"Pours a clear amber color with a frothy, gigantic head. Loads of carbonation run up my glass and burts forth into the head. Smells very piney and orangish, with a nice hop floral smell. Tastes suprisingly malty at first. Oak notes burst through the middle as the hops start to run strong. The finish is all hops with a great pine flavor. This is a very interested brew indeed. The further I get down the beer the fruitier it gets. And an almost vanilla flavor comes through. Excellent beer!! Well rounded, yet still complex enough to keep my interest. Feels a little dry in the mouth for me. All in all this is another great offering from Clipper City. Hopefully this brewery will start to gain some recognition soon, because they are a force to be reckoned."
"Very nice color-deep copper with a great head that slowly recedes. Big hop aroma-citrusy,pine like. Great hop flavor in front of a very soft malt backround. Good body-not as oily as some of the double IPAs out there. An excellent beer all around-quite the tasty treat. Should be a year round offering."
"Finally a local Double IPA that is bottled, I was truly excited to pick up a 6 of this in the store for a great price. Pours out copper with a tall beige head quickly erupting. The head collapses down to a rocky terrain as I drank this and scattered lacing was left around the glass. Aroma is full of citric and pine hops with a slight bit of caramel that made it self know once this warmed a bit. Big taste of citric bitter hops of front that is balanced by an eventual slightly sweet caramel. More balanced than I usually like my double IPAs but it works out well here. Taste ends with dry grapefruit bitterness. Body is about medium but a little lighter than I would expect. It works here though were as a Stone Ruination it kind of detracts from it. Overall a tasty very drinkable treat of a beer that I will be picking up plenty off in the future. Very sessionable for a DIPA at 7.5% as well."
"This poured a deep mahogany with a beautiful creamy tan head and heavy duty lacing down the glass. The smell was of dark fruits, cherry, floral hops and a little citrus. The taste was really intense, definitely ripe fruits, pine and citrus hops, caramel malts... just big and bold with nice balance. The mouthfeel was very crisp and although this brew was full of deep and rich sweet fruits the taste finished pretty clean and dry. The one thing that got me is that this is considered a Fruit/vegetable beer --- I mean, this is more like a souped up Pale Ale with incredibly nice characteristics to me... When I think fruit I think #9 (which I don't like). I really like this and it's being blown out at $3.99/6 pack. Ummm, I'll be back for more. So far I am VERY impressed with the Heavy Seas line from Clipper City."
"Hazy copper appearance. Good sized creamy off-white head. Lacing is full. This brew has a nose reminiscent of Rogue's Brutal Bitter, except with a little more caramel malt character. It's got a fresh, grapefruit like hop aroma with a little cannabis mixed in. Unike mixture of bready malts, fruity yeasts, bitter and somewhat raw hops. Great flavor combo for me. Body is a little better than medium and the carbonation is subtle. My first Clipper City. And it's a winner."
"- Can't wait for the small craft warning."
