"I´ll have another! Good taste & smell!"

"Overall: An excellent beer, and one of the cheapest ales out there in my area. Will certainly be buying more of this!"
"Average beer without any special features."
"An awesome brew to have off cask."

"Appearance: stylish bottle; copper-colored translucent, oily liquid, good training dense, full bodied foam. Aroma: excuse me, but I felt nothing ... Taste: hop bitterness, wood, reminded me whiskey. Alcohol is properly inserted, leaving the taste for hops."
""
""
""
"Very nice bitter."
""
""

"I just love English beer, so I might be a bit prejudiced. Lovely, malty brew.  Deep color. Smooth malt with enough hops to make it what it's supposed to be. I've bought up all the Bombardier that Beer Run had."

"Subtle bitterness from English Challenger hops with color and aromas from Crystal Malt give rich , rounded, biscuity flavor and deep copper color. Plus love the tap with cannon ball on it and the new pint glasses Huzzahh!"

"Overall, a very disappointing beer."

"Pours a deep, ruddy brown with a nice creamy off-white head. The head has great retention and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is deep and rich malt, with hints of dark fruit and a faint earthy whiff. The taste follows in line, with a delicious malt forward flavor and a subtle hint of hops to round it out. The beer's body weight is perfect, not too heavy or thin and it has a smooth finish. A great pint of bitter. If you're in England, always good on cask."

"O: Overall it's a nice beer but not something I'd probably pick up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finishes with a medium bitterness (slight spices also). Bittery, but then again not too bittery. OK, I guess."
""
""
"The beer deserves a bit more attention as a go-to brew of choice, given it's quality and affordability. Extremely solid drink."
""
""
"Overall – A rather nice drier and crisper esb that has a good flavor profile and drinkability. A nice more session style brew."

"This beer is simple to describe. Smooth feel, faint bitter aftertaste, and easy going. You can knock down several of these before you realize that you've done so. It pairs best with spicy food or any type of food doused in hot sauce. I know for an English Pub beer you're probably thinking really, spicy food pairing? Trust me. Spicy peanuts, steak with your favorite hot sauce, or even sushi with spicy sauces are what you need to bring the most out in this beer. Its not nearly as bitter as the name would suggest and the color is not as dark as you would suspect either. Its just a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A dark English Ale, minimal head but laces nicely. It does have a full bodied taste. Can taste the Carmel and Toffee. Aftertaste is pleasant. Not a great beer, but a good one. First tasted a couple of weeks ago, it was good enough to buy again when I couldn't find a limited I was looking for tonight. And good enough to buy again."
""
"500 ml. bottle. Brown colour, not very big head, but it leaves a crown. Smells of toffee, floral, maybe some fruit. Medium body, fizzy palate, good carbonation. Taste of fruits, with some chocolate and fruits, some liquorish dry finish. But in all in all, I'd just say a good beer, not an extraordinay one."
""
"Overall: not a bad English Bitter at all, though perhaps a bit light in both aroma and on the palate for my liking. A case of 16 x 500mL bottles is AU$90 (2013) which isn't too bad for I think one or two every now and then."

""
""
"full disclosure: my numbers are probably 0.25 to 0.5 high because I can't get enough of this style. also, I can't get Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale in my hometown, so this one serves as a fine replacement."
""
"Crisp with a semi-dryness brought on not by herb or leaf like many bitters, but encouraged by the hops, it's also softly but firmly carbonated with a solid crisp bite to it and some creaminess, too."
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
"Lovely, amber hues with a nice, frothy head. Some lacing. One of the best balanced bitters I have had, where the hops (Goldings, I think) come forth at just the rate level. Bread-like, toasty malt flavors develop throughout. A great beer to drink with Indian food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavorful and refreshing beer with high drinkability. Classic English bitter, with great balance of malts and noble hops. English beers grew on me and I dig their traditional sessionable like this one and US tweaks that are usually turbinated."
"I will definetley be having this beer in the near future."
"Great bitterness to just overwhelm the malt character at the finish. The fruity character was unexpected, and is not my favorite characteristic."
"Overall - Great beer and one of my favorites. It is no wonder that most of the Wells and Young's Board likes Bombardier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Could definitely drink a few pints of this throughout the night."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If you're expecting a nice, easy-drinking English bitter (such as Fuller's London Pride), go elsewhere. This ale is a little on the aggressive side. Very tasty. I like it."
""
""
""
""
"Nice enjoyable pint. The brown notes of aroma and flavor are interesting and the bitterness in the beer is nicely balanced and helps to support everything else that the beer is giving. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mild bitterness from start to finish. Esters primarily evocative of dried fruit. Toffee malt backbone. Texture is soft, but not quite creamy. While not a session beer per the classic definition, this is something you could enjoy for pint after pint. Compares quite favorably to Fuller's ESB. I have to credit this beer to turning me on to English bitters when I first tried it a couple years ago, and it's something I still go back to every now and then."

""
""
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
""
"It is definitely a nice, solid, all around enjoyable session Ale with a discernible and respectable yeast and malt character. Could probably serve as a gateway of sorts between sessionable beers and more dexterous (maybe even dextrinous) brews."
""
"O: Nice beer for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good solid Bitter. Light but flavorful and well balanced."
"Overall – This is a good beer that turns into a great one as the drinking experience goes on. At first I felt there was an aftertaste that was slightly offensive but as I continued to sample the beer I could no longer detect it and that gave way to a very enjoyable beer. The malt flavor is the highlight of this libation with strong British character. The noble hops and British yeast contribute their roles and play them well as second fiddle. By the end of the beer I am left wishing I had more; not for tonight but another that I wanted a nice British ale. To improve it, I would like to see a more pronounced head and something to clean up the slight DMS aroma that is present."
""
""
""
"O: Bitterness is not rich as the malt, but still is good, but the malt steal the show here, with an average ABV, make this beer perfect as a session beer, still its is complex enough to delight the most demanding taste."

"Easy to drink with lots of malt and hobs; you can nearly taste some fresh tobacco. Not too strong; so ideal beer for people with some thirst and also ""beer-connaisseurs""!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Just had Mexican (soft tacos), which you wouldn't normally associate with an English Bitter but surprisingly it works. Ole!"
""
""
"overall, very nice taste and very pleasing. typical range of abv content; expected and pleasing. i like the sweetness of this brew. it is not a stand-out brew but is one that can be had in succession easily."

"500 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, best before 3/22/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, molasses, toffee, and light herbal. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, nuttiness, pear, apple, biscuit, toffee, molasses, light earth, and herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, nuttiness, light fruit, biscuit, and toffee on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of flavors that are quite robust; zero cloying after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Overall this is a damn nice ESB offering. Great balance of fairly robust flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyed this."
"Wells Bombardier pours a clear ruby-brown with a small cap of head. The aroma is awesome and just what I want from the style. It's got an assertive, but not overwhelming amount of caramel malt, along with some nuts, bright fruits and a touch of pepper. The taste is a little less assertive than the nose and comes on gently with a bit of caramel before revealing everything from the nose at once - the caramel and nutty malts, the bright fruits, and the bit of pepper rush right in, leaving a nice, flavorful yet mellow aftertaste. Maybe a touch too much on the fruits, but otherwise solid. The mouthfeel is a touch over-carbonated, but otherwise nice. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a great ESB from a style I'm increasingly realizing I'll never fully unlock without a trip to England."
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Extremely British. Great session beer"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight citrus hops, slight pale malt, slight sweet malt, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of an Extra Special / Strong Bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of hint of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight citrus hops, hint of floral hops, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance and feel."
""

"It's hard to review these English beers in cans or bottle. This is more of a lager than what you would find on the hand pump in a pub. However, it's a highly drinkable sudsy gulp from the modestly-priced 440 ml can which seems to be a Trader Joe's regular."
"O: This beer was not as I expected. It was a little more sweet but still had some hoppiness in it. It's very drinkable. I got a 4 pack of cans at Trader Joe's. Would buy again. A nice beer to throw in the ice chest mix for a party."
""
"Poured it into an imperial pint glass just because I could. I was treated to two big fingers of cottony foam that died down into a gummy lacing atop an amber-caramel brew. Not much of an aroma to speak of—more of a light malt than anything—but the flavor has a light maltiness, a mellow bitterness and a clean finish. This is one I’ll pick up again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a 2 inch foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy chunks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, burnt caramel, and some slight metallic aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, slight caramel, and some nutty flavors. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very flavorful, decently balanced ESB. Nice complexity, leaning more towards the sweet malt side of things."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a wonderful English ale. It has an incredible drinkability, owing to the beer's balance. Every element has an integral place. I want to drink the entire 4-pack of cans right now. This is lovely."
""
"O: Very sessionable."
""
""
"O: The aromas and flavors are quite complex for a light-bodied beer. There is also a good balance between the malt and hops because it doesn’t taste overly malty. This beer is very sessionable."
"O: Very enjoyable, very easy to drink, and very sessionable. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would gladly have another of these - I only wish I could find this one on cask."
""
"-Overall 4.5: This beer gets it right. What is ""it""? ""It"" is how a quality beer tastes. It isn't about jamming as much hops and barley into every aspect of the beer pallet. It's about following tradition and keeping it right once you have gotten it right. Wells Bombardier hits the mark. Excellent English ale and highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful beer. I wish youngs/wells would start sending it to the US"
""
"Overall next to Anderson Valleys version this one is equally as good with smooth flavors and crisp taste. Worth trying if you love the style."
"OVERALL: A solid brew from England making its way to the states. Probably the type of beer you would expect to find at English pubs. Good flavor, good feel, everything is just about right and proper with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: an easily quaffable English bitter."
""
""
"Overall I love this beer. Will drink it anytime I get a desire for bitter."
""
""
"Gravity at LHR – who’d have thought?"
"Pours nice out of a can, deep caramel tinted ruby color with a tan khaki head pouring thick. Fine even spread lacing clings to my imperial pint glass as it settles. Aroma has a pleasant fruitiness with grain induced sliced bread qualities. Aromatic hops are distant but definitely in there, comes off herbal mint with a nice earthiness to it. Refreshing quality about this beer served up in a 14.9 oz/440 ml can. Way cleaner and more enjoyable than a New castle inline with a Fuller's but yet a bit more easy drinking. Assertive English hop character, mild fruit, bready caramelized malts coming through to balance it out, along with an earthy bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, even sturdy carbonation flowing smooth, I can't complain about anything while drinking this beer. Overall very enjoyable flavorful introduction to English ales, damn good and fresh in the can."
""

""
""
"O - This is an interesting brew to say the least and it is not bad, yet I do not think I will pursue it again in the future."
"One of best English ESB's money can buy!"
"very british tasting nice strong hops bite, with a dry malty aftertaste. a little pepper like the smell but bitter hops is prevailing . kindoff a simple taste but quite nice. a good classic bitter."
""
"O - This is a good beer to have with lunch - it would compliment most sandwiches well, such as a roast beef and cheddar with a soft horseradish sauce, or even fish-n-chips with a tasty, tangy tartar sauce. More hop-forward than the typical English brew, but not an American hopfest, either - it's an interesting juxtaposition of lightly toasted malts against straightforward bittering hops that delivers both sides of the coin."
""
""
""
""
"Nothing spectacular and not worth seeking out but solidly British bitter."
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit of a disappointment, this was a fairly average beer for me. I can't say I'd recommend it but judging from other reviews I've seen online, some people really like it, so I can't say it's to be avoided either. Either way, average beer for me."
""
"Overall this is a fairly solid beer but not up to par compared with other ESB's I have had. I would have preferred a little more maltiness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pleasant and well-balanced English-style ESB. Good session beer."
""
""
""
""
"550ml bottle purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth, expires 10-05-12. Pours a crystal-clear copper body with a thin crown of khaki-colored head. Smells bready and slightly spicy. Fresh-baked bread permeates the tastebuds. Hints of caramel and chocolate too, but only slightly. Light bodied with fairly low carbonation. Not much going on here, but a passable beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid beer. I am not huge into bitters but this is very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: This is a good mass produced beer. Easy to drink with pretty good flavors. But why would one ever drink it when Fuller's ESB is the same style and not only one of the best bitters ever brewed, but hands down one of the tastiest beers regularly available anywhere?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Very nice ESB that's easy-drinking. Surprised at the smoothness and mellow taste- Sessionable. Liking the contrasting (back and forth) malt and hop nature."
"O-A good looking and drinkable bitter."
""
"Dark reddish amber pour with a thin head, scant stickage. Smells of dark dried fruits, plummy and figgy. The taste has all this and a bit of bitterness. Good body to the beer but not the best ESB I've had. My vote is with Fuller's, but I do need to drink more of this style."
""
""
""
"A middle of the road ESB. Feels a bit too dry and roasty...could use a bit more sweetness to balance out the bitterness."
""
""
"O- A really rich and sweet English ale. I would love to try this on cask, tap, or out of the bottle, because the metallic taste brought this down some for me."
""
""
"O: Very nice Ale. Not as much head retention as I'd hoped and little aroma hops but still. Fine Ale.:) I'll have another!!!"
""
""
"Man, I like this beer! Yummmm! Served at a good temperature with a decent sized ,light tan head that slowly settled and lots of lace. Color is a clear, amber copper with some tiny bubble trails. Aroma is very toffee, caramel, malt, fresh beer, along with a little leather and roast. Flavor is like nose, plus a little carbonic tang and biscuit. Body & carbonation are just right for this style. Finish is like flavor, of medium lenght and readies me for another quaff. Super drinkable beer. I want more!"
"O: Really nice. I enjoyed it."
"I'm a big believer in English ale, and now a believer in English ale from a can. Wells Bombardier is a fresh-tasting offering, cold from the fridge, and as it warms a bit, as with any good ale, you can feel its glory. I agree with other reviewers - glad this was not a widget can with a nitrogenated head. Doesn't need that. The head is fine, the aroma of malt and English hops plenty evident. The only bitter I can compare this to from my limited experience is Fuller's ESB, which I have had quite a few times on tap in Canterbury Ales in Huntington, NY. So far the malt and hop flavor profile of ales in the bitter family are among my absolute favorites in beerdom. You will get that one-of-a-kind malty, aromatic goodness even from this can of Bombardier. Perhaps the only thing better is real ale, freshly casked from the brewer; barring that, give this a try. Very recommended."
"O- Easy to drink. Only roughly 5% ABV. Really kinda bland for my taste buds."
"Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- I can't believe it took me so long to get a hold of this one, i guess the opportunity never presented itself. it looks absolutely amazing, feels just as good, tastes and smells awesome, and drinks like a champ. and the modest abv means this 4-pack will not live to see the 'morrow. old chap."
" A real treat from across the pond!"
""
""
""
"Overall – I found this beer to be a little boring and one dimensional. It basically just malts/caramel and some dry hops. I'll stick with a Fuller's ESB the next time I'm in the mood."
"O - I found the Bombardier to be a classic and great example of the style. It's an inviting brew that can be enjoyed as a one-off or as a ""session."" I would love to have this one on cask again."
""
""
""
"O: Good, but that smoky flavor detracts. Also a bit too fruity for my preference."
""
""
""
"O: Decent, bit on the bland side."
""
"an old faithful"
"This beer is pretty good, but it didn't have the taste profile I was expecting or had hoped for."
"A quality bitter. Balanced with good bitter tones and a long finish"
"O: Pretty easy drinking English ale. Nothing remarkable about it to make it stand out, but its good and I could easily drink a few of these. Would be good with any pub/English fare."
"Final Grade: 4.06, an A-."
"Good beer, albeit a tad sweet, hence down a bit in drinkability after the initial flavour burst."
"Medium bodied, lingering malty finish. Great sessioner. A good ol' drinking beer, when you just want something tasty and wet, and are in no rush to challenge your taste buds."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a really nice poofy head, luxurious like thick cream. The beer was amber colored and had a slight bit of a malty taste that I really liked. It was not bitter. I would certainly buy this beer again."
"This beer improves as it warms; it really should be served at cellar, not fridge, temperatures. It's an excellent English ESB, and I prefer the canned version to the bottled. I applaud the brewery for not succumbing to the ""widget"" gimmick. The beer is, however, perhaps a bit over carbonated."
"Notes: Wow, what a beer! A great looking beer with multiple layers of flavor. Well constructed, delicious, soul lifting. I'll be buying more!"
"This pours a very nice looking dark amber / dark reddish color with a nice off white head head. The smell is much more malty and toasty than anything else. The feel is medium. The taste is like the smells, lots of toasty malts a little sweet for a ESB the bitters / hop presence is low and nothing very noticeable. Overall this one was good, but I prefer a Fuller's ESB."
"Overall, one of the better british ales and worth trying."
"Overall: Not a bad English beer, if nothing special. Definitely not as hoppy as some other English ESB's (I'm looking at you, Fullers) but the malt notes are nice here. Not really anything wrong with it, and it certainly kicks the butts of some other, easy-to-find English imports (and the fact that the brewery dates them is awesome), but there's not really anything that would lead me to purchase this again, if some other English options were available (Black Sheep, Fullers, etc). That being said, if someone handed me one, I'd gladly accept."
" Happy drinking, Cheers!!"
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle stamped 10/05/12-A-L1130-04:36. The pour is a handsome darker amber with just a small head. The aroma is classic British Ale with brightly sweet caramel malts and cleanliness. The body was smooth and in the medium territory with a powerful sweet malty taste and a decent bitter hop bite on the end. A fine example of the style."
"As an aside, I think the can is the correct delivery method for this beer. It's cheaper than the bottle and has a freshness date! (mine says 01/28/12). All hail Bombardier!"
"O - A decent tasting beer that looks better than it tastes."
"O-I haven't had a large amount of ESBs but I'm becoming a huge fan of them, it's very easy to drink pint after pint of this"
"The lacing on the glass was very nice. I also like that the can is a bit big. Why not. More is better."
"O- A solid ESB, very drinkable and tasty, the bottle describes it as ""England in a glass"" and I have to agree. Totally worth trying, especially at just over $3 a bottle."
"Poured a 2"" off-white head which took a while to settle down. Lovely clear reddish amber color when held to the light. Smells of malt. Taste is mild and pleasant with a crispness like a lager but a little more malt in the flavor, and there's a moderately long finish. It's easy to see why this is a popular classic."
"D - A textbook ESB in all facets... A very solid offering that doesn't disappoint, but also doesn't excel either... Not too shabby..."
"Brown ESB. Head is a bit creamy but dissipates. The smell is grain and bread. The taste is heavy malt more grain and a hoppy bitterness (east kent). There is a hint of caramel and a butteriness. Low carbonation, standard for the style, but a little bit prickly. Not bad. Not great, but I think it would be better if I was closer to the source. I have a feeling if this beer was fresh it would be a whole different experience. No freshness date listed. Quality beer, but with price being equal I'll buy a Fuller's ESB everytime."
"D - Not quite what I was imagining but not bad either. Perhaps I should have had this one at a more traditional rooms temperature. But seeing as how it's 100F now, that didn't seem like the best option."
"taste was quite malty, tad bitter, and a tad sweet. good drinkability, good carbonation. overall pretty enjoyable."
"O - A decent bitter, didn't knock my socks off but a good beer nonetheless."
"Felt very good in the mouth, little carbonation, but a pleasure to swallow."
"Overall I give this beer an A. A quality bitter with alot going on. Very easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Overall a very decent drop. Nice with some good old English fish and chips."
"Thin bodied with a sweet malt profile and a faint floral hop presence providing balance.  Hints of caramel, toffee, but and biscuit.  Nice dry hop presence provides subtle balance.  Not really bitter but enough to counter sweetness.  Easy to drink but not very complex.  Really watered down and bland.  I really like cask conditioned beers but this was like slightly malty water.  "
"D - Outstanding. I could drink this all day. One of the best ESBs I've had the pleasure of trying. Highly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"Nores: This is the epitome of a traditional English ESB. Moderate to medium in body, and quite easy to drink. Maybe the best English beer to come out of a can that I have tried. Very well put-together."
"This beer pours out as a copperish amber color with a white bubbly head. There was some light lacing on the glass. The smell had some nice malt aromas and grains on the nose. The taste was pretty mellow and had a good bitterness in the end. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Overall it's pretty good ESB."
"I liked it but at twice the price of the Foster's bitter, IMO the better taste/value for a bitter ale goes to the Foster's Bitter"
"pour is steady, with very little head produced - cask brew in a can. beer is dark brown producing some nice lacing after the first few sips. Malty, buttery and some very light butterscotch flavor here. Nice dry bitter finish and refreshing as can be. At just over 5% alcohol, this is pretty light by today's standards, but the amount of flavor from this beer is pretty amazing. One of my all time favorite easy drinking english ales. Glad to see this in a can. Will be on this a good deal this summer."
"Generally, a classic beer. This one of my early favorites when I first discovered beer could taste good."
"Mahogany pour, tan to black with little head. Malt sweetnes on the nose with little other hints as to flavor. A tasty ESB and a very even brew. A nice well rounded malt character with a nice subtle hop finish. The body is slight and nearly thin, though the style seems to demand it. For this reason I cannot judge negatively on lack of texture. Over all this is a good drinkin' brew with moderate ABV and a really casual flavor and feel. I like it."
"The Crack & Glug surprised me with two thick fingers of tawny head with good retention. Nose had a bready, biscuity maltiness to it and suddenly my mouth was watering. Color was a deep ruby red with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a mildly malty sweetness on the tongue initially, followed by a wash of grassy hops. Finish was more malty than bitter, very pleasant with a mild chocolatiness that seemed to linger. I would definitely want this in my cooler and I will have to pick some more up on my next foray."
"Starts of tasting quite hoppy, but the hops fades while drinking it, and the carbonation dominates most of the taste after a few sips, towards the last sips, when most of the carbonation is gone, it tastes a little bit like dirty coins."
"This should be what Budweiser tastes like. Super quaffable AND high quality. Good wtf-ever beer to go with a simple meal or a movie. But I wish I could try it on cask, maybe then it would have some complexity and real aroma."
"Extreamly drinkable, solid mouthfeel. The right amount of lively carbonation. One of the better examples of the style I've had, which is not a lot admittidly."
"D: A tasty, easy-drinking ESB with low enough ABV to be easily sessionable. Strong example of the style."
"Overall I enjoy this beer on-tap but the cask conditioning takes it to another level. Very much worth a shot if you find it served on cask."
"Dr: Too pricey for how relatively unremarkable it is."
"O- A decent session beer, but nothing special."
"I could drink this at any time, it's above-average, but not great in my books."
"drinkability - good version of the style, this was a beer that i'm glad i tried."
"*As I finish the pint, I note that the flavors smooth out nicely with warming -- don't sample this too cold."
"D: Very much an ESB, but not in the realm of Fuller's classic for me. The taste is pretty good though, drink this above 55F for the full experience."
"Drinkability for this whole style is way up for me. I really love the assertive hops balanced with bready malts, and this particular beer is just that. Balanced and highly quaffable."
"abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, about what I'd expect from an ale."
"Overall, a very nice brew. A worthy companion for a comfortable session at your local or home. Worth trying."
"A very dry finish rounds this beer out very nicely. I think I could easily sit at the local pub all night drinking these back without batting an eyelid. Great beer."
"A decent ESB, and certainly worth trying if you like this kind of beer."
"A decent ale - not likely to become my regular but representative of English beer."
"Poured a deep golden yellow with a thick white, long lasting head. The aroma was dominated by bready, sweet malts with a touch of pepper. The ale was thick, malty and smooth. Bittering hops came through in the middle before fading somewhat in the finish. A very nice, full body session ale. Watch the alcohol, as you will not notice it until you stand."
"An offering that teeters well away from the banality that I unfortunately encounter too much in imported British ales. I sure wouldn't pass up a few rounds of this as the local pub bitter option, if that sort of thing actually existed in my neck of the woods."
"Drinkablity - could drink it all day."
"D-Pleasant. One of the lightest bitters I've had."
"A good beer to drink and enjoy with the pals."
"Drinkability: One of the better ESB's I've had, I will keep an eye out for this one."
"Drinkability: For an ESB, the bitterness is prevalent here which works well. I think I prefer a beer with a bit more malt present, but overall I like this one, although with the strong bitter finish I'm definitely done at one pint. Went very well with Turkey, spiced sweet potatoes, and green beans. A solidly good English ale."
"D: Great session beer. Enough flavor for beer geeks and something adventurous for your newbies. Not usually great beer for the warmer months. Give this English brew a try, it's worth it."
"Solid brew."
"Here is a very clear light chestnut color with a modest off-white head. The aroma is notably malty, with a caramel and toasted malt character. Not much in the way of hops in the aroma, but there is a very English-style biscuit and toffee scent. The taste is more on the dry side than the smell presumes. It's moderately bitter, and very satisfying. All around, this is fine English-style ale."
"D: An unassuming, but eventually delicious beer. More depth than I have come to expect of British ales (perhaps unfairly.) Bombardier Bitter is well worth your time and attention. I will be having a few more."
"Pours a copper brown colour with thick off white head. Head takes a long time to dissipate. Some lacing around the glass. Smells of raisin, biscuit malt and mild earthy hops. Flavour has mild bitterness and some sweetness. Nice medium bodied carbonation. I like that the Control Board in Ontario has this so I can frequently have this."
"D-Pretty easy drinking beer that is decent but the price tag does not match up with the quality of this one."
"A nice mouth feel makes this a great beer for a cold, rainy evening."
"Looks to be a good dark red amber brew, rating 27 on the SRM chart. Not much head with this one. One finger of light brown froth which was gone in about 30 seconds, leaving a very thin ring of lace, with little cling. Hearty aroma of roasted wheat and malt. Solid taste of roasted wheat, and barley with a good shot of hops. Lovely feeling as it slides over my tongue, teeth, and the back of my throat. Nice sweetness on the aftertaste that really impresses me. One of the few beers that has given me the belches. This is one to impress the guests. A little pricey, but worth the expense to round out a good meal. Not one I would serve at the typical backyard gathering or time in front the TV watching the game. This beer deserves more than chips and nuts."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Nothing wrong per se but just bland."
"D: High, definitely a good drinking beer"
"Served: August 23, 2010"
"Pours a nice brownish amber color with nice cap of off white head, leaving some behind and decent lacing. Scent is of roasted nuts, wheat bread, yeast, touches of grass and earth. Taste brings all the qualities of the scent together, a great bready and nutty malt backbone with splashes of earthy hops. Medium bodied, perfectly light carbonated. Overall and very nice, highly drinakable ESB."
"Perfect amber pour with a nice off-white head, slightly thicker than a lacing. Aroma has some biscuity maltness and muted fruits and baked bread in it. Taste is perfectly balanced, leaning toward the malty with a nice fruitiness common in most bitters. Finishes with a nice, dry bitterness from the hops. A near-perfect British ale here, perfect for just having a pint or three."
"I'd drink this again and its not to much money so no reason not to try it"
"This is a competitive segment for me. I feel its a worthy beer, but not sure how well it stacks up against the other ESBs in the neighborhood."
"I really enjoyed the old-school feel of this strong bitter, and felt that it captured it's British roots quite well. I'd love to drink this as a session."
"I wouldn't go so far as to say this was ""thirst quenching"". A very good English ale - a little different - but nice. I feel like it begs to be paired with some chocolate nibs or some other desserty confection of small quantity and/or volume."
"A well balanced and good bitter."
"Well's bombadier comes off the pump looking burnt orange with a slight copper hue with a few cenimeters of bubbles leaing faint stick. Smells of toasted malt, faint sugars and banana. Slight caramel. Taste is very slightly bitter but very authentic. Some cereal and toasted malt with faint biscuit bread. Bananas and caramel. Simple and semi sweet. Feel is a real smooth criminal, no interference whatsoever. Less than medium bodied, carb on the light side. I could drink a lot of this, but something in the taste dept. Is lacking. This is plain tasting great beer if that makes any sense."
"D- so easy to drink it might as well be water but even better. This is what the uk does every day, I can get down with that."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer- worth a look."
"Amber to brown in color, but clear with visible carbonation. The buoyant 3/4"" head began to dissipate quickly, but then settled into a foamy coating that lingered while I drank the rest of the beer. Very prominent caramel and toffee aromas carry over to the palate; and there is a pleasant balance of these flavors along with some nutty flavors against some toasted malt and dry hoppiness. This is a medium to light bodied beer that is a great food beer -- English pub fare or anything else fried."
"Had one of these at Local 44 during Philly Beer Week. Poured fresh from a cask. Looks amber in color with slight white foam head. Smell is great. Aroma of still fermenting yeast with touches of slight hops, green fruit, and and almost avocado like smell. Little to none carbonation. Extremely drinkable."
"Just a bit average really. Maybe it's just the style?"
"Medium dry finish with a body just a tad too watery from my liking."
"D- I really wish our breweries over here could match the greatness of true English Bitters! The alcohol is well hidden, the textures are subtle yet distinctive, the flavors are perfectly balanced and it's a perfect session beer. I'll definitely be buying this again and recommend this to any true beer lover!"
"Cool looking 500 ml bottle, doesn't say Premium Bitter but simply ""Premium Ale", hope this is the right one, let's give it a whirl. Smell is distinctly English with some sweet malt and indeed a little peppery as they note. Pours to a deep chocolate brown with a multi sized bubble head that dissapates, but not quickly, lacing nicely. Taste is a very smooth, more European than English, well balanced ale. Has a bit of caramel combined with some roasted malts right up front. There's some crisp noble hops in the middle of the taste followed by a dry and tangy finish with bitter residuals. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth in the beginning, sparks up in the centre, but seems a little thin on the end. Overall this is a great drinking brew. Session beer without a doubt."
"Drinkability: As with most good ESB's very drinkable."
"D - Not hard to drink, just doesn't taste well enough for me to want to drink muc."
"Drinkability is decent, but this one is rather uninteresting, and doesn't have much appeal."
"D-just an okay beer. Not very much depth. I would have again if given limited choices."
"A great ESB that would make a perfect pint on tap. I prefer Fuller's ESB over this, but this is still a solid second. Flavourful, balanced, and sure not to disappoint."
"It is nice to have a full bodied English Bitter after a overdose of realy hoppy PNW beers. This is spot on for the style. Slightly yeasty and flowery but anchored in malt and having a full mouthfeel. Dry finish with lots of noble hops in the midbody."
"Drinkability: Pleasant and easy to drink with a good amount of flavor. I've found several English pale ales to be in the same realm but with more flavor. This would be a great beer if the price wasn't so steep. I've always found Samuel Smith's to be steep but a $4.50 pint from a bottle? A decent bitter though may drink again."
"Drinkability: To me easy to drink. Low 5.2% and a solid english ale taste that makes it enjoyable."
"love the look of the bottle, with the english flag emblazoned on a shield. when poured this ale appeared a dark copper color, with a decent sized head (near white in color) that dissipates quickly with just a few bubbles working their way to the top. looks very inviting. head retention and lacing are just about nil. smells are of hops, lightly roasted malts, and a bit of bready spiciness. the fuggle hops on the palate are apparent right up front, and are certainly not overwhelming, but offer a nice tangy bitterness throughout the sip. a thick breadth of malty sweetness accompanies the hops that i really enjoyed. good combination of fuggle hops and the crystal malts. has a slight toasty flavor i appreciated also. can't put my finger on the spice that is showing through. the finish has a spicy zip with a nice balance of that hop bitterness with the sweets. this ale has a medium body, with moderate carbonation. very nice. i found the drinkability to be a strong suit. i have yet to find a wells that i didn't enjoy. a splendid ale."
"This is a nice session beer. Nothing to write home about, but a nice ESB. Give it a try if you find it."
"A nice brew, although very intense. Wouldn't want to session these, ironically something like Cooper's Best Extra Stouts seem more sessionable to my taste."
"This pours a deep amber color with an medium sized off white head that slowly disperses leaving some thick lacing on the sides of the glass. The first thing I smell in this beer is the caramel malt, with just a little bit of citrus underneath. This is a smooth beer that tastes of caramel, malt, and just enough bitterness to keep it from being overpowering. Actually, the bitterness is almost refreshing following the sweetness of the malts as it does, very tasty. This beer is smooth and refreshing feeling light in the mouth, and could easily be the drink of choice on a warm evening, or even in colder months. A very good beer."
"More than makes up for their IPA; a fine pale ale, not overly strong so as to allow for sessions. Good stuff."
"A solid bitter ale."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops and malts. Taste is good, again hops and malts, slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a quality beer."
"This beer is as drinkable as you would expect an English bitter to be. However, in this category I prefer drinking Fuller's ESB over this one, since the Bombardier is a bit too tart for my taste."
"Taste was good, very mild for an ESB. Really a very good beer but nothing spectacular."
"drinkability: very affordable for a good beer that is a shining example of its style."
"Final Thoughts: I suspect the Young's end of Wells and Young's is the premium brand, whereas Wells is the good enough brand. It honestly tastes like this beer should be two separate beers, a Wells Brown Ale and a Wells Pale Ale. For an ESB, you will want to stick to Fullers, because frankly there is nothing special about this bitter."
"a bit english hop when you pop it with a pour that a bit darker. a straight copper. some head that isn't aggressive of particularly lacy. nose of quintessential beer bitter hop. some earth and metal. palate that is a traditional form i suppose... with an earthy finish."
"Drinkability: Very good, similar to Fuller’s ESB but not quite as well put together and not as strong. All and all I would very much recommend this to anyone who likes an ESB as much as I do."
"D: A nice well balanced bitter. Not the strongest in taste - but just like a bitter should be."
"There is nothing cloying or overwrought about this beer. Restrained elegance. A knockout."
"Drinkability: Really drinkable, nice flavours, not to heavy considering the fullness, and very moreish"
"OVERALL: Unfortunately the weak, airy and overly astringent palate kept this otherwise enjoyable beer from actually being enjoyable. Tasted quite nice, but I just couldn't get past the less-than-impressive feel of the beer. Not one I'd want to have again."
"A nice crisp english ale. Pours a quickly falling off-white head, moderate lacing. Nice butterscotch notes to the nose, a little biscutty. Flavor starts with sweet malts fading into a mild hop bite and finsihing with an oily sweetness. Smooth and refreshing I could drink a dozen of these."
"Creamy, very pleasant, another great cask beer to session all day"
"Overall a mildly complex beer, but still leans tot the refreshing side."
"D: A very pleasant brew overall. It ranges a bit much into bubblegum sweetness, but it works out."
"D: Quite easy to drink, a good session beer."
"D - Supremely easy to drink. Enough interest and smoothness to keep 'em coming."
"Exactly what one would expect from a good British ESB. Brilliant tawny amber color with great clarity, but not the overly shiney appearance of a lot of newer 'tourist' beers coming out of England lately. Aroma was clean with caramel notes and a background hop note. Carbonation level was perfect.. lively without being burpy. Up front carmel/crystal malt roundess without being cloying, followed closely by an assertive (at least in English beer terms) hop bitterness, I would imagine fuggles. An extremely well balanced beer."
"Light, drinkable, sessionable English Ale."
"Eggshell white colored head, mostly foam rather than bigger bubbles, quickly drops from one finger to a thin surface coating, no obvious lacing. Very clear redwood color, transparency does not diminish the fullness in the glass, brightens into zinc orange around the rims. Well-spaced nose, allows you access to all the various scents without interference, caramel, creamed coffee, scone, sodabread and a suggestion of fruitcake, you get golden raisins, figs, grapes and peach pits, any hops are lowkey and not out to get in anyone's face, florality too demure, overall depends on sweetness to make an impression. Medium-bodied, the carbonation starts churning from the first sip and shows no signing of diminishing until the bottle is empty. Places itself squarely in the middle ground, no favoring the toffee, chocolate or nutmeg spice or, conversely, the lemon citrus, pressed flowers or field grasses. That said, there's a noticeable metallic, streamwater aspect, which may be the most bitter thing about it. Not so bready here. Clings to your mouth pores, not sticky like honey, more so oily. So, has decent length in terms of palate presence even if not the flavor intensity to match."
"Overall, this is an excellent example of the style and quite authentic tasting.. I'm sure this is better on draft but it's still pretty good."
"A very excellent example of an ESB, and a downright tasty beer to boot. I'd call this a good after-work beer, a pleasant treat to come home to every night. Would also pair well with a wide range of cuisine (in my opinion). A good workhorse brew, and one I plan to purchase more of in the future."
"Cool Bottle!"
"D - Quite drinkable with a pleasingly complex malt profile. This beer stands out primarily for its rich toffee malt profile and dark fruit yeast character. Everything is well balanced and in proportion allowing for a very nice, enjoyable ESB."
"Full body with light carbonation makes for a beautiful fluffy mouthfeel. Luxurious in the mouth yet not too heavy. Very nice. A little rich for an ESB, pushes the boundaries of a winter warmer. Definitely not an everyday kind of beer, but a very nice special occasion beer. Too bad about the oxidation, but that is always a danger with a high priced import that may have sat on the shelf for months after its long voyage. Please date the bottles!"
"D - A well balanced, tasty ESB. I could certainly drink a few pints of this without a problem."
"Poured with a dark, murky copper-like look with a thick head and patchy lacing. Burnt cocoa aromas mixed primarily with malts. Taste was rather dull and watery. It lacked a stable flavoring and more had a flat, flavorless texture. Mouthfeel was decent with a good body but, like its flavors, was rather flat. Overall, not sure if it lives up to the title ""drink of England"" but it has its moments."
"Overall, this is a fairly lacklustre example of a bitter. Mostly, it's not very bitter - it's too malty for that. Secondly, the palate, while having enough complexity to keep you interested, is fairly poorly balanced and the flavours are all essentially lined up one by one for you to count, rather than being released in a gush of flowering complexity. I could take it or leave it, really."
"The taste is like the aroma overlal, with a lot of fruit as above, toast, a strong leafy tea character, esp. near the finish, mroe toast, hints of licorice and pepper, and a lightly winey fruitiness and a rather English sweet-sour hint. It has great sweet-bitter balance and a wonderful leafy finish married with sweet caramelised bread crust that lingers."
"I had this beer on cask when in London a couple of years ago. While the bottled version is very good, from the cask it is stellar. It's a shame we cannot get it in this form over in the USA!"
"The only thing i didnt like was the mouthfeel, the flavor doesnt last a lot, the body was ok."
"This is what I want to drink every day. A simply beautiful product. I wish american brewers would brew these kind of ""hoppy"" ales--the hops give an earthy cedary quality and an overall dryness while still remaining so subtle and harmonious with the fruity/caramel malt qualities."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Extra Strong Bitter."
"Medium bodied with a mild carbonation and a light warming from the alcohol make this a solid offering for the style. A nice bitter thats is a pleasure to drink and very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Very good; an excellent ale when well-kept."
"D- Quite a drinkable and sessionable ESB. Definitely will have more of this!"
"The drink becomes creamier in feel as it warms a bit, and is light-bodied with mild carbonation. Bombardier Premium could easily be consumed in great quantity should the notion strike."
"Enjoyed at cellar temperature, or just below, the character of this beer really comes through. It's really very nicely balanced between hops, malt, bitterness, and yeast character. And there's enough there to keep it interesting for more than one. Certainly worth trying."
"Pours a nice mahogany with a medium beige head. The foam shrinks quickly leaving a small but dense cap. Nice lacing. Aromas of crystal malt and some faint dark fruit esters (prunes maybe). Tastes of slightly toasty caramel malt. Light hop bitterness throughout with an earthy finish. Definitely going to have to try and find this on cask."
"Thick creamy mouthfeel. A medium carbonation level works really well too."
"This is one of those beers that are easy to dismiss because of the timid values in hops and malts; but balance does this beer justice. Remember that this is a moderate abv. beer and not meant for overwhealmed judgement-- just drinkability. I could drink this all evening long."
"Colour is ruby, small off-white head, there is some lacing, small bubbles. Aroma is fruity sweet, jam and honey smells amost like a doppelbock, the presence of hops in the aroma is not very strong. Flavour has a distinct bitterness, but for a premium bitter it is also rather sweet. Mouthfeel is rather lively. This is a very nice bitter, maybe lacking a bit of complexity,but still very enjoyable"
"Drinkability: Definitely worth a try. Not sure if it warrants repeated tastings though."
"D - I didn't care for this one. I could see how some might like it, but I just found it to ""off"" to thoroughly enjoy."
"Drinkability - I can wait till that next sip!"
"Overall it's one I'd highly recommend. Nothing ground-breaking, but a fantastic tasting complex English ale that's rounded enough to have as a once off or even as a session beer."
"Very drinkable beer that I would definitely try again."
"Traditional ""round"" British flavoring. Lots of malt (lighter toasted varieties), but an equally generous dose of hop bitterness. Very nicely balanced. Full bodied like all good English ales. A very predictable ESB!"
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured to a bright reddish-amber color with thin white head that lingered to mid-glass and left very good lacing. Nose was malty dark fruit with just a hint of spices and hops. Mouthfeel of this medium-bodied beer was tingly and slightly dry, while the flavor followed the malty dark fruit sweetness of the nose, with a hint of toffee. Finish not as dryly bitter as I would like, but not bad."
"This beer poured a dark copper/amber color with nice white head that lasted a long time. The aroma was fruity but not real prominent. The taste was also of dark fruit with a bit of spice to it as well as a touch of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was smooth and sort of creamy. I enjoyed this beer and at 5.2% abv, it was an easy drinker."
"Very good beer and my choice if Fuller's ESB isn't available."
"D: Good drinkability. Overall a very complex beer with lots of different flavors that blend together nicely with no one standing out or dominating. Rich, robust flavor and a great example per style."
"A great ESB. I would like to try this fresher and on cask to see how it improves. But as it is now it is still great."
"Pours a dark amber/copper color with a tan finger's worth of foam. Lacing is light but there. A nice malty, fruity aroma, hints of rum soaked fruit. Almost Belgian Dubbel in aroma. Interesting. Slightly bitter tasting, backed up by hints of dry chocolate malt, a bit of toasted malt character. Not bad. Very dry on the finish, bitterness is just about right. A good English bitter, would probably have again if I could find it in a Nitro can."
"Out of the bottle this ale was a clear amber color with a tan head. Great clarity, modest retention and very good lacing. The aroma was rich and malty, caramelized malt, toffee, raisins, figs, dates and some herbal hops. The flavors were rather subdued but well blended, sweet malt and caramel first quickly followed by the cutting herbal hops. Crisp and bitter at the finish. The mouthfeel is ultra smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a great example of the ESB style and well worth picking up."
"Pretty standard copper color. No real head. Nice, fruity aroma with a definate sweet malt tinge to it. Great flavor. Full malty flavor with a great fruity note to it. Plum like with a great sweetness from the malt. A whisper of hops. Complex in a simple sort of way. Good body. Very, very drinkable and enjoyable. Damn good beer. British beers that are this good always seem few and far in between at times. I could do this all night in a pub in a bad way. Very nice...."
"MF&D - Smooth, creamy and very drinkable. If your into English ales, this is a must have."
"Presentation: Packaged 19.25 ounce custom brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"M&D: overly spritzy is the mouthfeel, and the metallic touch seems to come from the can that doesn't add any points. But given the essential flavour profile as in the cask version and a decent level of bitterness and dryish yeastiness rounding up the whole performance, I would say this can is not a bad pint after all. Still, seek out the cask version and that's a world's apart~~"
"overall-a solid easily drinkable beer"
"An excellent example of the style..a session brew in my books...I'll have another govnah!"
"I liked this one, but 1 was enough. Complex, a bit filling. Enjoyable."
"Simple beer, quite drinkable. Would definately quaff again."
"This was a very enjoyable ESB. Something I would drink more often if it was easily available. This compares nicely with the Fuller's and Young's examples."
"not too thin, decently smooth. moderate carbonation."
"Poured into an Imperial Pint glass, this beer is deep reddish copper in color. The nose brings to mind diacetyl and some fruity esters. As for the taste, this is what I've come to expect in a good English ESB; some butterscotch/diacteyl, biscuity/bready malts, a faint kick of alcohol, soft yeast, very good balance, and an aftetaste of minerals found in hard water. Worth the $3.49 pricetag, and one I'll surely do again."
"A solid ESB from across the pond. Rich, but well-balanced. A great version of the original style. Perhaps not the best ESB I've ever had, but a really good one. Admittedly, though, I am a huge fan of the style."
"D: I don't think I'll finish the entire pint, and I probably won't buy it again. If one was to not mind the wateriness, alcohol, and sweet-overload, it would go down alright..."
"Mid sized bottle, some sort of dating perhaps etched onto the bottle. Pours dark amber, with a medium tan head, that shows retention then goes to a thin film and leaves nice and plentiful stringy lacing. Nose is nutty and malty. Pleasant British ale, bready malts, smooth and highly drinkable. Brit ales have been getting a lack of respect in my beer world, this one reminds me of the simple pleasures and understated elegance of the brews from England."
"This was a pretty decent example of the English Bitter. I'm not a big fan of them but I tried it at a tasting and was pleasantly surprised I suppose. This was pretty drinkable. Its a lot better than I expected considering I don't care much for the style at all. All that said, its not something I would go out of my way to buy but it was a good experience."
"I poured this beer from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is exceptionally dark copper, almost red, with a thick light beige head. Significant lacing. The smell is strongly coffee/cocoa beans/nuts with roasted malts and a hint of fruity hops. The taste starts out strong of roasted malts and coffee, but ends with a slight fruit flavor. Mouthfeel is rather carbonated--surprisingly, not very thick. This is a drinkable beer that is not as heavy as you may anticipate before trying. I really like the size of the bottle. The Charles Wells website says its the UK's only full English pint bottle."
"D - what a beer! The drinkability is off the charts. There's just something about this beer that makes it infinitely sessionable. The flavor is excellent and it feels great going down. Would definitely drink whenever!"
"Pours a semi-transparent light mahogany or coppery brown. Aroma is hoppy with some traces of spices and a little malt component. Flavor is almost more winey than beery, fairly fruity and a little malty, and has a strong nip to it, as well as some strong but pleasant hoppy bitterness. It goes down smoothly and with pizzazz."
"Very drinkable, and enjoyable as a pint. It is nothing to rant and rave about, but for the price, well worth it on occassion."
"Pours a beautiful clear ruby color with nice off white head. Nose is nice and malty with some slight copper. The taste is superb and to style (as far as american distributed bitters) nice malty taste with smooth mellow golding hop flavors and a nice little hop spice twang. a bit of appley taste (ala SS old brewery pale, but not as strong) Quite dry on the finish, yet still very refreshing. A wonderful session brew, and one I will surely revisit when I get sick of Urban wilderness and the Sam smith pales and organics. Man how I wish we had the bitter selection they have in England, not to mention the cask selection. and for that matter the bitter on cask selection! What perfect session brews. Oh well, someday maybe! Until then, its another excuse to travel. Good beer."
"D- This beer has some malt notes and a faint hint of hops but it is just bland. All the great subtle flavors in a good bitter are absent, and it was actually tough to finish. I hope to try it on cask and see how this beer taste when it is alive."
"D, notes: Nice British hop flavors in this one. British beers are meant to be sessionable. This one is. Good balance."
"drinkability is great. this is a mild and easygoing brew that uses simple flavors and aromas to produce a complete composition that is a delight to drink. cheers, Wells, this one is for you!"
"D: this is a nice english bitter. good hop character throughout and a bit of malty sweetness that doesn't overpower the beer. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. I will buy this beer again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent session beer with some substance that I could drink for a while."
"I wont be getting this one again, thanks."
"Verdict: Pick it up. An underrated style that excels in the area of drinkability."
"Pours a maple syrup colored caraeml and ruby color. Only a one finger head right after the pour,but quickly degrades to a nearly nothing ring of foam. The aroma is a dry pale adcarame malt that gives of hints of whole grain bread. The frst sip is full of minerals and rain. This is the real deal as far as hard water is concerned. Bone dry hops that balance very well with the medium malts. The malts are heavy on the toast and light on the roast, makes me think of toasted whole grain bread. Bone dry palate , but very drinkable. If only this was available on tap tap a bar near me."
"Recommended..."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer. If it were slightly lower in ABV it would be an awesome session beer. Nice for an afternoon where you are feeling like a good English pale beer."
"Tasted 3/18/08."
"D - A very easy drinkin' English ale w/ session strength, for me this is average and could take it or leave it, but it's not a bad English ale by any means. It serves its purpose, but the flavor becomes ordinary after the first pint, just not a fave style-a little too sweet for multiples."
"A higher ABV bitter than the standard bottle on the Tesco shelf. A fairly dark chestnut color which is very attractive, a modest head. Fairly muted aroma, fruity malt notes I thought. At first I thought the taste rather dull; but over time I began to appreciate the details: it's quite a dry bitter hoppiness but with some depth of apple-citrus fruit and malty hues."
"There is a lot happening in this beer and it is all wonderfully subtle. The beer is interesting and comforting all at once; recommended."
"Drinkability/Notes: A really different take on an ESB. More malt pronounced but does have the nice English hop characteristic that you would expect in an ESB. A realy nice take on the style. Would love to try this on cask. A little higher abv than a true session beer but one I could definitely sit back and drink a few. Recommended. Seek and Enjoy."
"Tried this on tap last weekend at Cornwall's in Kenmore Square. Served in a pint glass. The color was a brownish orange, and the smell was slightly hoppy in nature. Not much though in the flavor department. Kind of bland. A gentlemen next to me also remarked (correctly) that it was very watery in texture. I was just thinking too, very thin body. If you are a fan of this type of beer, then you may enjoy this. But it was a bit too bland for me. Fine for a quick pint then I left."
"Overall a tasty ESB. Good drinkability."
"D-As much as I love Fuggle, and I do, it was nice to have a change."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Deliciously drinkable, but at $5 a bottle I better enjoy this one. While this won't knock your socks off it will be good."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable; one of the top English ESBs around (sadly, they are increasingly hard to find)"
"Overall this is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer that is a good representation of the style."
"Very drinkable. I would drink these all night, but may be a little pricey for that -- $5 a bottle. I did not mind paying that much for a beer this good, though."
"Poured out of a big bottle, producing an amber-red brew with a rocky, airy, almost whipped-cream-like light tan head that does not shrink down in the slightest, leaving plenty of lacing. Definitely an inviting looking beer. The nose is a little week -- mostly biscuity malts and some subtle spiciness. Tastes as a strong bitter should -- lots of caramely, cookielike malts with a soft hoppy bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little disappointing -- a pleasant soft smoothness -- almost airiness -- is overtaken by an overall watery feel. Nonetheless, it's interesting and pleasant enough to session with. A few of these would certainly not be a bad way to spend an evening."
"Pours a light copper ...nice head with some lacing. Smell is a nice blend of malt, yeast and citrus. Taste is malty with a nice crispness with a not overly bitter hop presence. Mouthfeel is crisp with a nice dry finish. Drinkability is very good based upon crispness and low abv."
"D - I think this is an easy to drink beer it has a pretty good taste to it worth a try sometime"
"Chestnut color with a thin head. mild aromas of caramel malt and some milder toffee notes. The flavor was quite similar, yet lacking in depth or complexity. Finish was restrained malt and the faintest touch of earthy hops. Not bad, but I was hoping for more from the folks that took over Young's."
"Pours very nice. Clear darker amber with brown hue. Very crème head. Nice size, nice lacing down the side too. Nose is not overly exciting. Slight woody edge. Not much really going on. Flavor is good. Nice malty complexity. Good level of caramel sugary sweetness. Nice wood tones. Feel is silky with carbonation and a good liquid body. Very drinkable. I am sure there are more exciting examples of the style, but this one goes down smooth and has a nice level of flavor character. A pleasure to drink. I wonder what this would be like on cask..."
"Poured from a 586ml bottle into a wasted Guinness glass, this beer immediately strikes me as something I'm probably going to like just from the dark amber colour topped with a good head that takes a long time to subside. Neither too hoppy nor too malty, but subtle and delicate fruitiness comes to my nose from the glass. From a purely personal perspective I'd prefer a little more bitterness - I find Bombardier just a bit too bland, but very drinkable all the same. A very nice beer indeed."
"Was able to give this brew a try the other night while at Mahar's. Brew had a nice color, kind of a copper tone with red highlights. Had a good sized light tan head that had some good legs and left nice lacing rings down the side of the glass. The aroma was very inviting, with a fruit like smell mixed with a night toasted scent. The flavors are similar to the aromas but seem to bring them out more as the malts seem to really be alive with a biscuit flavor, the fruit highlights pear and apple. The hop flavor really seems to be fresh as it has a nice bittering effect. This is a highly drinkable brew that has very nice flavor and feel with a lower ABV, exceptional drinkability."
"Flavor of apple, toasted malt, grassy & mildly bitter Challenger hops. Bitterness is subtle in the finish. Very even, rounded mouthfeel that is clean and doesn't hang on the palate too much. Had to have two in a row, so it gets my strong vote as a highly drinkable English Ale."
"D: Bland, low ABV, and not much character. Not a brew I would get excited about beyond this sample...wouldn't turn it away but I doubt my dollars would find there way back to jolly old England."
"D - A totally sessionable brew..in fact, I sat down and told the bartender at Brick Store I wanted a sessionable ale because I was getting ready to go to the Beerfest and this was what he brought me..very good..and I think my first intro to ESB's...a good beer"
"I wouldn't mind trying this one on cask, to see if that smooths out the carbonation. This could make a very nice pub ale."
"Tasty ale but it loses some drinkability point on the basis of the price of this stuff. Other than that this is a good ESB on the herbal and bitter end of the ESB scale. Recommended to try at least once."
"The beer came in a sturdy looking 500 ml. Bottle, and I chose to warm it up close to cask temperature before opening it. The beer looked very good in the pint glass, as the copper colored body was absolutely clear, and the head atop was nearly two finger thick and sticky. I know my bottle was fresh, because the store owner had cut open a newly arrive case and handed it to me, but I did not realize how fresh until the hoppy aroma hit my nose. Quite a bit more aromatic than most other English bitters I've sampled so far. The earthy pungent hop smell was quite detectable, even at an arm's length. The taste was where the Englishness of the beer started to make itself known. The bitter-spicy, mineralized, dry, and musty taste was typical handiwork of an English yeast strain. Not much citric brightness was seen here, like that typical in the American interpretations of the style. The mouthfeel disappointed me a little, as it was tinny and marred by an almost metallic aftertaste. Not as good as Fuller's version from what I recall, but it's been a while."
"Taste begins with a herbal bitterness, followed by a mineral-like flavour that most likely comes from the water source. Earth, grass, caramel, light fruitiness (apple, raisin), and some black pepper. Tasty and very much what the style calls for. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a higher carbonation than I expected from an actual English bitter. Pretty dry in the finish with sweeter notes coming out in the aftertaste. This is a simple and well executed beer that would be a great session ale, especially on cask."
"A very sessionable ABV which is appreciated, but i found the mouthfeel of this beer so offputting that I have no desire to try it again anytime soon"
"Pours transparent copper with slow carbonation and a thin but very rich tan head. Sticky lace abounds. The nose is a little weak, suggesting nutty biscuit malts with a slightly smoky and herbal edge. Flavor is more forthright; plenty of toasty biscuit-like grains with a balance of herbal and leafy hop overtones. Finishes slightly dry, peppery with dried fruit notes. Body is thicker than you'd expect; creamy, rich, and filling. I prefer the Fuller's bitters, but this one definitely redeems Charles Wells' after my poor experience with their banana bread beer."
"Drinkability: Fair enough. A decent, if not standard English bitter."
"This beer had a hard to describe sensation to it. A kind of twang to the lips and tongue tip but not attributable to carbonation, I don't believe. Like I had an electric razor to them."
"smooth, tasty and drinkable. too bad we got just one."
"Not much to this one at all in flavor or aroma...easy to drink but why,when there's so much flavorsome beers out there.I'll pass on this one for the next round."
"Mouthfeel gave a mild sizzle on the tongue with a medium body and a somewhat zesty carbonation level. Overall a nice bitter, but not as good bottled as it was on cask at the GBBF 2007."
"Overall a nice, quality bitter. Probably one of the better offerings from this brewery. Worth a try for sure."
"This beer seems to get decent ratings but i really disliked this beer .. First off, not to bitch about price but this really is to expensive, Especially for this kind of brew .. Medium sized head for a bitter .. Smells of used socks and old biscuits .. Taste is just a muddled mess, quite disgusting actually! .. Avoid at all costs!!"
"A nice ESB - malty, but with just enough bitter balance to keep it in style and interesting. A nice one to have on its own, but cherry like sweetness and bready notes make it a nice one to pair with warm cherry pie. A classic ESB that I would love to try on cask."
"Opinion: Overall this beer is pretty drinkeable for an English Bitter...ESB...whatever. I am not a huge fan of the Bitters, but this is one of the better balanced ones I have tried in recent times. Though it is not a huge beer, there is plenty of flavor here, and it doesn't leave your palate wanting for more. The dryness on the back of the throat is a bit like roast to me though I know it isn't. After about half the glass though...you don't really notice it anymore...imagine that!"
"Pours a nice reddish brown. The head is well retained with some good looking lacing. Smells of fruits, malt and toast with some butter. The taste has hints of biscuits, hops and a dry finish the malt is quite pronounced as well. A good session beer. Paired well with some Triscuits with melted old cheddar and salsa."
"Pours a clean deep amber with an off white head. Bigger carbonation than expected. It had a very faint sweet smell, but really not much at all. In the taste a very small caramel malty sweetness and small bitterness, but not too big. It s a smooth English beer, very session-ish, but not much in the aroma and taste to write home about."
"Extremely drinkable, one of my Benchmark English beers which all others are judged against. Always has a place in my fridge."
"Pours a deep copper with a very nice off-white head that lasts quite well and leaves some decent lacing. Smell is quite malty, with a bit of nuttiness coming through on top of nice caramels and a hint of butter. Some grains. As such the taste comes out of left field with some nice citrusy hops. Spicy Goldings give some nice bitterness to the ale, with the malts complex enough to lend it good character. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and has good body, and drinkability is stellar. Great bitter, and a wonderful drinking beer for just about any time."
"D - Not bad, a bit too sweet overall. If I am in the mood for a mild English bitter, I might have this one again."
"Drinkability - Amazing...I could sessions this until the cows came home."
"This is truly one of the best beers I have ever sampled, a true classic and one that should be in every cupboard throughout the global market."
"Clear mahogany body is topped by a one finger beige head. Good retention and some sheets of lacing on the glass. Aroma of toasty bready crystal malts and floral and spicy hops. Light medium body, medium carbonation, and some mineral on the palate. Taste is very much like the aroma. Bready and toasty malt, bitter unripe pears, slight nuttiness, and a pervasive floral and spicy hop bitterness. A pretty good English Bitter here."
"This is one of the most balanced beers that I have ever tried. The bittering hops only make themselves perceptable against the dark roasted malt flavors. Recommended."
"Medium body, and finishes well. A good, robust session beer. I would like to try the cask variety."
"Taste of raw, resinous, English hops, which also give the beer a good bitter. On top of that is the malt that gives the beer a caramel, candy sugar taste and really balances the bitterness. Every sip the beer seems to show either hops or caramel malts, so every sip is different and highly drinkable. I could drink this all night. Mouthfeel is dry and leaves a nice 'bitter' feeling on my tongue."
"D: Overall, while the tastes were complex and didn't taste nasty or anything, I couldn't figure this one out. I could see this as a summer quencer, light with a sandwhich, but not one I'll get again."
"A rich copper color with an off white head that disapates fairly quickly. Smell was faint at first but more dry fruity, sweeter aromas came later on. Taste is again dry fruits with sweet malts with a medium mouthfeel making for an easy ale to drink, light in aroma and flavor with good carbonation."
"The pint in a bottle is a bit of a novelty but this stuff is the business."
"the label looks like a Steven Spielberg dub of an England WW II propaganda poster ... just cool ... the nose has hints of pink grapefruit, sure more hops then malts ... the rich taste has hints of blood oranges, lychees, roasted macadamia and some toffetype sweetness ... a great english bitter ...definitely premium ..."
"Notes: Nice ESB but not much beyond that. A little watered at times and there is an underlying metallic twinge that is annoying. Overall I'd love to see this while in England."
"This has a fair amount of carbonation in this brew, it probably adds a bit to the lightness of this brew. This is not a bad brew, but I can't help but think that this seems a little thin in the flavor department. I am not looking for bigger, but there is a certain leanness here that I associate with cheap lager, though I am not quite sure why I say this. This does have a nice balance between spicy hop character and malt notes, though it does lean towards the hop side of the spectrum."
"ESBs are not my favorite style, but this one is very good."
"Very drinkable, a good benchmark for anyone who doesn't know what an English Bitter tastes like."
"Good ale to drink on a Fri or Sat night. I can honestly say, I could drink this all night long."
"Cant say i could another pint of this, a poor example of an english bitter, no character at all"
"A good example of the style. light, crisp, and immensely drinkable. Heck of a way to kick off a long weekend. Probably be a lot better drank fresh, though."
"A light brown to dark mahogany ale that pours with a voluminous, rocky off-white head. that falls very slowly. Fruity aroma with hints of caramel. The taste is malty and fruity, with a strong note of minerals.The finish is lightly spiced with hops and just a touch dry, with light bitterness. This beer needs more bitterness to be an ESB, but it's a good session beer which sort of comes across as a darker, fruitier and more complex version of Bass Ale."
"Not sure why its marketed as a premium ale here in Canada. Guess they think it may be more accessible as such versus the ESB."
"Wells Bombardier Ale is miles above many beers, but is still largely nothing special. Worth a try, but not quite ready for the limelight."
"Quite drinkable. Not the most complex beer in the world, but quite pleasing."
"Overall, an above average English bitter."
"Not a bad beer, although it didn't stand up to well in between two much better ones (Younger's Tartan Special on tap, and a Fuller's London Porter)."
"A surprisingly full flavored brew. Interesting, full flavored and complex."
"Nice looking beer in appearance, dark amber with ruby aspects, lovelly large dense creme coloured head. Nice dark fruity, malty aroma, with a hint of hop and mild pipe tobacco. Great balanced flavours, mainlly malty on first taste..dark malts, slightly toffeeish, some dried fruits, slightly prunish, a hint of dried apricot..all vert nice, but the understated English hopping as always supports well and leads to a well balanced beer. Very good mouthfeel, not thick but pleasing..dryish finish. I liked this beer very much , typical English flavours make for a easy going Summer night beer here in Salem"
"The taste follows the exact same path as the nose. Well balanced with a light lingering bitter aftertaste. A very smootyh beer with a moderate mouthfeel that has just the right amount of carbonation....I'm glad there is no widget in this can. A very drinkable beer that is perfect for summer refreshment or washing down a good meal."
"Not a very happy experience To much alcohol to go with too little flavour"
"Served in a pint glass, the Bombardier pours a copper color with a small off-white head. There isn't much of an aroma, but the main smells are hops (fruity) and a bit of caramel. It tastes mainly like hops, spices, bread and caramel. It finished clean, with pretty much no aftertaste at all. The mouthfeel is thin and watery with low carbonation, but it is pretty drinkable. The aroma and flavor weren't too strong with this beer. It's not bad, but it's not something I would want to drink all the time. It would make for a decent occasional session beer. I guess I was just expecting more from the beer, but overall it's average to good."
"Mouth: Has a very light body with strong carbonation. Fruity sweet characters, maybe white grapes, and a strong hop finish with a bit of heat from the alcohol, creating a spicy ensemble. Strawberry notes follow the nose into the mouth. I served this at room temp and I think it may have been a bit better chilled. Would definitely drink again."
"M & D - Medium bodied. Low to mid-level carbonation despite the active carbonation in the appearance. Smooth, easy to drink, session stuff here. Very tasty!!"
"I tried this in bottle a little over a year ago, and was interested to see it in cans at my local, so why not give it a try. All I can say is that either my tastes have changed, or it is far superior in the bottle. This comes out almost flat, with a few large bubbles in my Fuller's imperial pint glass. Minimal aroma is helped by a nice (but very light) hop profile in the flavor. I know English ales are subtle, and that's what there is to love about them, but this is beyond subtle. This is missing in action. Mouthfeel is watery to very watery (if the flavor wasn't better, I'd say it was an American light/lite beer based on mouthfeel alone). It did not grab me at all."
"I like this beer quite a bit. It's really too bad it's not very common where I live."
"Adam"
"Solid drinkability. I could down one after another."
"Popping the cap, this one pours a beautifully clear garnet red, filling an english pint to the brim, I'm almost worried it'll spill over. A whisp of head forms on the hop, with a bubble or two floating up rapidly to feed it. Good head retention, keeping a strong collar throughout. A little island of foam floats in the middle, in the shape of Belgium. Sheeting lacework. Typical light english aroma, what with the lack of head. Fruity and malty. It's still a bit cold. The fruitiness grows as it warms. Ripe brown pear, strawberry, caramel, pale malt and a bit of floral, spicy english hops. Juicyfruit gum fruitiness as it warms to room temperature. A hint of chocolatey roastiness. The flavor opens with grainy caramel, immediately fruity, perfectly balanced by modest floral, earthy hops. Tingling carbonation. Very nice. Somewhat lighter bodied, feeling thinner that american counterparts. Sessionable as hell. Modest hop presence in the finish, with that familiar goldings character. Some spicy hoppiness. Might that be the Challenger? I'm not too familiar with the variety. Very clean feeling, lacking any off flavors. Great session ale. Classic."
"Nice pour was kind of a smokescreen ... the rest of the experience never got any better than the pour. Nose is very weak. I get a tinge of caramel and the barest hint of hops. Taste is bready, a little sweet like caramel, and then a splash of bitterness. All seem as if they have the volume turned down. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Overall I'm not in a hurry to revisit this one. Oh, and I should mention I do enjoy the more subtle brews, but this one begs for something more profound."
"Poured a dark amber colour into the glass. The head was off-white and mediumthick. Had a fruity and slightly malty aroma with some hints of caramel. The flavor is malty and fruity with some bitterness and some hints of caramel. Maybe a little to much CO2. Leaves you with a malty bitter aftertaste."
"Unfortunately we got to the pub 15 minutes before closing so we could only drink one each. I would get it again, but I prefer Fullers ESB flavor over this."
"surely age couldnt have had this much of an effect? only being one month past bb date, i doubt going back one or even two months could cause enough improvement for me to want to seek this out again."
"Lovely red appearence with a bountiful honey-tan head. Nice lace rings. Smelled scotch malty with undertones of hops. A distinct scotch malt flavour with a pleasant mouth feel. There was just a slight grit but it was appropriate to the style and taste. A bit on the sweet side for a pale ale lover like me, but a good quality beer for its style. Presented in a unique and weighty bottle (heavy enough to make a real weapon). Label states an Imperial pint, 568ml."
"D - Very good. Could drink this one all day long (figuratively speaking). Not a huge hoppy/malty brew, but nice and tasty and easy to drink."
"This poured a deep red/brown with a slightly tan head. Smell is of caramel, which is not that bad actually. Taste is reflected as such as well, caramel malts with a bitter bite that finishes off quite smoothly. Pretty easy going and a good beer overall. I've had other Wells offerings that were hardly impressive, this one is not bad at all."
"A very drinkable beer, especially during the colder months. I don't think I would have this in July, but January is a good time for a beer like this."
"Overall: I have tried this one many, many times in the UK on draft and been far from impressed, often finding it thin and metallic. As such I have passed it by in its bottled form in the USA for many months/years. Pity me. Tonight I gave in, in the bottle this one was a real treat; this version is much stronger than the Cask version in the UK which is only 4.3%. Even so, Bombardier is one of the UKs biggest selling Cask beers. For my money the bottled Premium version benefits immeasurably from an extra degree of kick, maybe the Cask version should follow suit!?"
"Drinkability: Definately high in this category, I could drink nemerous pints of this without getting tired of it. A thoroughly enjoyable beer and a fine example of an English ruby red ale."
"D: Good depth of flavour (considering it's weight), awesome session brew."
"Dark amber color, fruity smell. Even though I have seldom seen it mentioned in a review of Bombardier EPB I think there is a surprising bread taste in this beer. It's not really a typical bitter but in my personal taste. But the mark of this beer is its pronounced and lingering bitterness, kicking in as aftertaste. Strong personality, great brew."
"Bombardier is darker and more balanced than the American ESBs I've had, which I think tend to be either barely hoppy or exceedingly so, and it's a very solid beer. Wish I could get this in the States."
"Other comments: This is one of those somewhat mass-produced, not bottle-conditioned beers that surprises you. It's actually a decent beer. Definitely good enough to buy the ""mini-casks"" that it also comes in. Had it on cask at a pub recently, but it had gone off, so..."
"It's medium bodied, with decent carbonation, and a tongue-coating glycerine feel. The nuttiness returns in the aftertaste after it loses it's chill. It does what it does quietly but firmly. Everything is in fine order. This is one I would return to again and again."
"A Big head that fast disapears into some lace, bitter and acidic bite, with some malts and chewy creaminess to offset. Nice dark glass bottle. Drinkable.A somewhat better than average beer, the British present a pint, and that's all I can have of it."
"Clear chestnut brown, a little on the dark side, thin light tan head with good retention. Decent lacing, thin layer of foam down most of the glass. Malty, some caramel, plum fruit, and a light earthy hop aroma. Carbonation is slightly coarse, creamy body and texture. Darker fruit in the flavour, some malt, but bitterness is forward throughout. Finishes on the dry side. Traditional flavours, tasty, definitely would have it again."
"Drinkability: Without question, the most balanced, drinkable ESB I've run across. The color, the feel, the flavor -- I love everything about it. A new favorite, and one I'll be revisting often."
"Bombardier English Premium Bitter has one of the more impressive bottle-label combinations that I've seen in quite some time. It's even more impressive in the glass, which is no small feat. I have a feeling that if I ever have the opportunity to try it on cask, it just might blow me away."
"Cool glass, though, to add to my collection."
"Overall this is just an ok bitter. The malts are a little cloying and the hop character is too meak. Maybe Wells uses extract recipes or something, their beers always taste too sweet. Still, this beer is like Wesvleteren 12 compared to the atrocious Wells IPA."
"I can easly drink two or three of these and still find them enjoyable. Not quite as flavourful as Fuller's ESB, but compares nicely. Personally, I prefer this over Fuller's. A good solid, pint."
"Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights. Small head, but good lacing. Malt in the nose, caramel, toffee also present. Taste is pretty typical for an english ale, malt, caramel, some bitterness to balance. Medium bodied, smooth, creamy. A better than average pint."
"Hmm, good beer. Yeah, nice beer. Bombardier pours from the glass a dark, black and red colour. A thick, two finger head rises and slowly disipates to a few milimetres of foam. Lace sticks to the glass like a thick pudding. Dry, bread and cracker malt smell, with an even dryer hop scent and some nuttiness as well. Hmm, a bit of an earthy taste at first. Kind of like a 'raw' malt. Mellows out to a sweet cracker, then finishes with a dry hop feeling. Aftertaste is a bit grassy and nutty. Mouthfeel is a bit thicker than expected. Not quite thick, definitely not thin. Somewhere a little closer to thickness on the spectrum. A good beer, one that I look forward to again."
"A pretty good ale, poured copper/red with nice tan head that was foamy, thick & lasting. Fair lacing and a really nice caramel aroma. A sweet and somewhat fruity taste but with a bit of harshness at the end. The mouthfeel is ok, but not that great a finish. Lacks the creamyness I like in an English ale."
"A nice little beer"
"Finally a chance to sample Britains ""patron pint"". Came in the impressive embossed 568 ml brown bottle. Poured a deep amber-brown with red tones... a tight, sticky sandy cap that lasts and goes to a real lace....small bubbles and moderate carbonation that are just right so as not to unbalance the tastes. Well articulated aromas of sultana fruits and musty citrus..very nice nose. Starts malty and silky with smoked toffee and licorice tones that go to a more bitter citrus and bread taste....finish is of medium duration with the drying effect of bittering hop oils slicking down the tongue to a final metallic aftertaste...a nice malty bitter...very tasty and satisfying."
"What can I say? This is marvellous ale. But please be aware that there is a less alcoholic version of this beer, sold in cans, that is a good brew but not at all like this one."
"739"
"Drinkability is very high. Excellently quaffable beer."
"Sweet caramel malt first on the nose, a bit biscuity, with juicy fruit tones in the middle, and light herbal hops. The flavour is predominated by sweet malt at first, but this subsides as the beer warms up, where it picks up a more grainy metallic character, settling into herbal hops on the finish with an astringent aftertaste. Kind of reminds me of nettles (anyone else ever had a nettle beer?). The mouthfeel is average, it holds its weight but gets a little caustic towards the finish. This does stay true to form for an English bitter, but after one pint it's not really my cup of tea anymore, I'm ready to move on. I do like that sturdy bottle though, perfect for homebrew."
"Never heard of this beer when I found it at Whole Foods near my London Pride. I figured it might be a crappy imported lager, but it also might be interesting too. I poured the .5L botttle into my tall pint glass. It pours a rich amber red with a tan foamy head. The aroma is lacking in hops but there is a rich nutty malty smell. The taste is definitely British. Nothing like the American ales I've been having lately. There is a ton of rich malt, biscuity, nutty, very refined. The bitterness is strange -- bitter but without any hop flavor. And yet not bitter enough to hold up against the sweetness of the malt, which carries on after the last gulp. Medium bodied. Smooth. The lack of hop character is the main drawback to this pleasantly surprising British ale."
"A dark amber colored liquid with a nice light tan head. Deliciously fruity aroma but not an overpowering one. The taste starts with a grapfruit sweetness. That sweetness slides into a spicey middle with a smooth bitterness on the finish. This was my first English cask ale when I arrived in England. Definitly a good way to start."
"Pours a nice ruby color with a creamy well sestained head that leaves a small amount of lacing,aroma is subtle on the malty side with touch of fruit and biscuit.Taste is mellow but with some nice flavors,malt tilted for sure with some flavors of dried fruit and some metallic notes in the finish.I could drink these all night and it has a pretty cool looking bottle to boot,thank you Liquid Solutions!"
"Catching slightly onto my late tendency to prowl round paris' english pubs, Bombardier at 'the Bombardier' (right off the pantheon) seemed like a fine idea. Pours dark brown with the same pace and head you'd ask for in a stout. The smell and taste, not very complex and oh-god carbonation lacking english beer, are very bitter (er what'd you expect?), overwhelming the rest of the taste itself. It's well above other english products though, and I could certainly have another one."
"Hand-pulled cask at the Bag O' Nails pub near Buckingham Palace in London. Amber/brown color with a medium thin beige head that did not last long. Thin coating of lace throughout the glass. Subtle malt and caramel in the nose. Medium-bodied and smooth like glass with a woody character. Flavors of dark fruit, malt and hops. The finish is smooth and rather creamy. I liked this one pretty well."
"It pours a copper color with a rocky head. The aroma is fruity and there is some caramel as well. The body is creamy and malty with a touch of nuttiness and some caramel. It finishes with a pleasing grassy hop finish and a lingering fruitiness. A very nice session beer."
"What makes it individual, however, is the curious aftertaste  its almost like celery. Another reliable session beer, well worth trying."
"Lingering bitterness is the distnguishing characteristic of this beer. Certainly worth a try."
"Not bad, though probably not something I'd actively seek out. A nice trip into the English ESB, and if I saw it elsewhere, at a reasonable price, I might consider it."
"Beautiful brown/redish brew with a small head reminiscent of the style. Once open, I got an incredible fruity/sweet smell that disapear once the brew was in my glass. Bitter tasting with a sweet aftertaste. One of the best bitter that I had the chance to drink recently. Will try to track more C.Wells product..."
"I ran into the regular tap version of this winner at a newly discovered ""English Bar and Restaurant"" in Moscow. While it is better cask-conditioned, I wasn't disappointed by this pint either. The brew came out a deep burgundy under a creamy tan head wiht good retention and very nice lace down the glass. There was almost no nose whatsoever - just a hint of malt. The mouth was semi-prickly and fairly light. There's nice hoppiness here from the start. Not American IPA hoppiness, mind you, but a good firm bitterness complemented by smooth malts and a touch of sweetness. The finish is bitter and enticing, while the malts mount a comeback in the aftertaste that smoothes out the edges and leaves you wanting yet more."
"Mouthfeel is syrupy and retentive but not unpleasant."
"Dark red hue, thick head, intense lacing. Some biscuity and malts on the nose. A very clean body; medium indeed - hops are detected up front with the bitterness, they go together well in this bad boy. Smooth and carbonated throughout, with some pleasant bitter malt detection. A great ESB!"
"Comments  I tend to like a heavy bitterness to my ESBs, although it is not necessarily a requirement of the style. I wouldnt favor this one from a personal standpoint, but many fans of the style will enjoy The Bombardier. If you like your ESBs smooth, a little on the lighter side, and not overpowering (read, anti-Rogue Brutal Bitter"") then give this a try."
"Draught somewhere in London: This one pours a clear amber color with one finger of a frothy off-white head. There are some caramel malts to the nose, with a faint whiff of some citrus hops. The taste is good. A decent caramel malt body, with no sweetness at all. A touch of citrus and lemony hops. Slightly bitter finish. A nice brew"
"Thick, persistent dense light beige head sits atop a clear, tawny garnet hued brew. Tattered sheets like of foam trail. Notes of sweet biscuit and brown butter upfront in aroma, with understated rounded floral hops. Hints of earth and plum esters add a subtle fruity contrast. Fairly clean and stately aromawise. Hint of roasted grain and biscuit bitterness is perceived initially in flavor, then is ensued by a combination of mellow butterscotch and toffeeish dark caramel. Hop presence darts in mid palate, but integrates well and offsets malt sweetness, lending overall balance slightly skewed towards hop bitterness. Both hop flavor and fruity esters are rather subdued, being comprised of mild, damp flower and fig, respectively. Lightly bodied, but not thin, with a softly dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes with pleasantly lingering notes of bread and butter. A near epitomy of balance, and a very tasty ESB. Bombardier is a brew I would have no qualms with drinking all day long."
"Copper coloured, enormous thick head. Nutty flavour with a distinct but nice bitterness. Most best-selling English ""bitters"" are not bitter at all, but this one is. The first time I tried it I found it too bitter for its relatively light body, second time it was just right, delicious! Great for a hot day too - why stick to lager in the sun when there are decent bitters around? Bombardier may not be a true masterpiece, but it sure is a decent and well made thirstquencher."
"The beer pours a limpid deep ruby color; the head pythonic in size, frothy in texture, and a light tan color, as it dissolves the lace left behind forms a thick sticky sheet. Nose is mostly malt, fresh, crisp and clean, sweet caramel with the start sweet malt, the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish has a perky acidic bite, the hops splendid in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste, quite a quaffable beer in its own right. Been looking for a bitter to have on hand as the temperature climbs here in the desert, by George I think I found one, now I need to get my packy to stock it!"
"Nice clear copper color under a thinnish head that did not leave much lace. Aroma was earthy, healthy, and fruity. Substantial mouthfeel, and a very smooth finish that blended malt and hops efficiently. A good cask ale which checks in at 4.3%. Glad I tried it."
"Pours a deep amber colour topped by a nice creamy head that stays around for a while. Aroma consists of malts and caramel. Flavour is bitter and also moderate caramelly. Average to poor caronation. A very impressive English Bitter"
"I'm definitely taking this one out for a second date!"
"Average at best, not much body, a bit of flavour in there (malty and then kind of hoppy), but its not interesting, and i probably wouldn't recomend it."
