"o: A good ESB, a bit more fruit notes and overall bitterness than I would prefer but the basic malt flavor is fine and becomes more prominent as it warms."

"Beer of the month club. Pours a pretty red color with small quickly receding head. Sweet fruit aroma with lots of malt and a bit of a buttery tone. Flavor is malty sweet up front, followed by buttery floral taste, and ends with some bitter hops, though these are pretty toned down. A little metallic flavor takes away from things. Easy drinking with plenty of carbonation. Ok beer, but nothing I would seek out."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a clear, slightly pale, amber-copper coloring with a steady, fast flow of carbonation throughout and a filmy, foamy, off-white head that settles into a surface coating. Nose of tangy caramel and hints of nut sweetness. Subtle roastiness on an overall subtle aroma. Flavors are roast and rich sweet forward, with nutty and caramel tang in the backbone, and not much to help balance. A bit jumbled and a bit cloying. Light, frothy bodied due to the carbonation, the beer has an overly sweet aftertaste, with a cloying, effervesced, frothy finish. A little too focused on the sweetness for me, with nothing to really balance."

" O: a nice, solid straightforward brew. Highly sessionable and great balance. Perhaps could use this as a gateway brew to newbies."

"Overall - I enjoyed this beer but didn't love it. It's pretty straight-forward - caramel, grain-like taste (tastes like it smells) with a decent hop to it (but not overpowering or too bitter). I would drink this beer again but wouldn't search it out. Pretty good work Woodstock Inn..."

"It's pretty good for the style. There's a nice balance between contasting ingredients. Mostly a session beer and a pretty good one at that."

"This beer pours a clear amber with a thin head and no lace. The aroma is nutty with caramel and fruity notes and a hint of bread. The flavor leads with caramel followed through by grapefruit and bread crust. It's a bit more bitter than most ESBs but still good. The mouthfeel is light-medium. Woodstock Red Rack Ale is a decent brew, crisp, and refreshing. Recommended."
""
"Pours a clear golden garnet color with a huge fluffy off white head that slowly dissipates and laces on the way down. Smells of caramel, mineral, and a bit of earth and spice with a hint of butter. the flavor is quite malty with caramel being the dominant taste. Earth, tart, and butter provide a bit of counter to the malty sweetness, but this one really leans to the malty side. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. A buttery malt bomb how shipyard-ish. OK for what it is, but there are better red ales out there."
""

""
""
"The focus of the taste is on the caramel malts and yeast with a moderate bitterness and a clean finish. Not a bad ESB in the long run."

"O/D-A mellow yet attractive beer that I enjoyed fresh from a growler. I was a fan, but I have had many like this before."

"O: Decent beer, not a ton going on, but nothing wrong with it. An average beer."
"The aroma is fruity, a sign of some good English yeast, with a little bit of diacetyl coming out as the beer warms. The flavor is mildly bitter, and again fruity. However, as this beer reaches cellar temp, the nose and flavor are there-abouts of a tub of move theater popcorn butter. Holy crap. This is the second Woodstock Inn beer that I have had, and they were both diacetyl bombs. Needless to say, they have to get their processes under control to fix this. Otherwise, it is a fairly solid beer. Drink this cold(er) if you have it. It's a shame I didn't."

"O: Too much diacetyl for my tastes."
"Not half bad, I'd love to try the non-contract brewed version of this. Good use of malts, perhaps a more defined hop flavor would help here?"
"Overall: Nothing special in terms of a red ale. The lack of any prominent aromas is horribly disappointing but the rest is nice. If I was a local of this brewery I would drink plenty but I am not so I won't be going out of my way for it."
"Overall: A nice surprise. Certainly worth a second glance."
"Overall a simple solid example of a sessionable enjoyable amber."
" the yeast works with this brew pretty well, but it's not like the woodstock flavor of old."
"D - not for me -- butterscotch bomb; still, it's easy-drinking, but I can't handle that much diacetyl"
"DB- Feels all over the place, not much balance of flavor and could use some hops. Doesn't drink ad smoothly as many ambers."
"This is a fairly tasty amber ale but really leans towards a scottish ale. Loads of buttery notes in the finish."
"TASTE: Near identical to the smell, but dryer. Not over the top, but noticeable buttery, sweet caramel flavor while still being clean and refreshing. A very pleasant combination. Flavorful, but finishes easy. Sharp carbonation is a bit too powerful (creates a metallic like experience) but does add an interesting ka-pow. Barely noticeable hoppy bitterness lingers at the very end."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. It pours reddish, brown with a medium white head. The aroma is sweet, cloying fruity. The beer is sweet and fruity, midway it is nice and biscuity. It has a lingering sweetish finish. The beer has medium body, kind of a sticky mouthfeel that doesn't work for me. Not terrible, but not my kind of brew."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the butter with some sugar notes. The combination makes the beer smell like circus peanuts. Unfortunately, the flavor is not much better. There is a little bit of grass, sugar and toffee, but once again there is a lot of butter in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Woodstock Inn Brewery--Red Rack Ale--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV. 23 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Amber Ale? Big fluffy lacy lasting orange white head. No sediment. Fizzy foamy bright rich ocher amber color. Malty mild toasted mild hop toffee fruit hint front. Creamy biscuity toasted caramel fruit mild sweet fruit malty Amber / Red body. Mild hop breadfruit doughy end. Odd English flavor. Over carbonated with mild hops. Sampled 12/30/2010. Malt of the Earth Beer of the Month Club Selection December, 2010 received 12/21/2010."
"D: Quite drinkable. This is not a complex beer, but it is a good, tasty session ale that works well if you like them on the maltier side. Overall, pretty good beer."
"D - goes down easy enough."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a solid pale and crystal malt scent along with a touch of fruity yeast esters. The taste is good. It has a smooth crystal malt sweetness that goes down with little effort and finishes dry with some light esters. This is a pretty good beer. It's not loaded with complexity, but it does have a solid malt bill. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking amber ale. I love the caramel malt character as well as the light esters. It's just the right amount of fruitiness to compliment the malts and hops."
"A hazy orange amber color with a decent off-white head and very nice lacing. I pick up tangy yeast malt and a little herbal hop in the aroma. Decent enough. The taste brings leafy citrus hops and nutty toffee malt. Almost a touch of roasted coffee bean. There's lemon highlights in a medium-light bodied brew. It has a bit of a resinous feel with fine carbonation that refreshes. Pretty drinkable but not greatly attractive for a session in my book. The hops are nice but the blend doesn't quite work for me. It's alright, maybe worth a try but not one to search out."
"Clear reddish-copper brew with a thin off-white head. Nose is a thick syrupy sweetness and dark fruits, like a mix of maraschino cherries and caramel. Taste is not as sweet. Dry, muddy, indistinguishable hops and malt. Fizzy carbonation with a soapy finish. Nothing interesting going on, pretty bland and unremarkable. Saving grace is that there's nothing particularly offensive. Meh."
"D: Can put a couple back, no problem."
"D - Looks good and feels good, but many other American Amber or Red ales out there. Just doesn't feel to style to me, but is more of a Scottish ale."
"D-wasn't sure if I would enjoy this, but I was pleasantly surprised. A perfect beer after a long day of work before drinking some of the heavier higher grav stuff."
"d - Overall this beer wasn't that great. I thought they smell and taste were kind of bland and lacking, but at least it was smooth and easy to drink. Would not look for again but since it came with the AC gift this month, an ok beer."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This one I find to be OK for the style. I do not get the same balance here that I get with other ambers. Not overly distinguishable taste wise or smell wise. This is an OK beer that I will most likely not be revisiting."
"Poured from the bottle to a hazy orange red with thin skim of a tan head that lingered well and okay lacing. Nose is malty citrus fruit with a hint of roasted nuts. Mouthfeel is thin, with just a hint of a tingle. Taste starts out okay, by picking up the flavors of the nose, but quickly urns grainy and skunky. Finish is no better, as the sweet malty fruit is quickly overtaken by a dry, cottony taste. Unfortunately, the finish outweighs the nice start on this one, and I'll avoid in the future."
"pours a medium copper color quarter inch off white head that quickly fades to beer and a light wispy lace. smells of sweet malt and slight metalic note. taste about the same. mouthfeel light, carbonation held well even with a strong pour. average at best not worth the price. keep looking."
"I would and will buy this again."
"Medium body, medium-to-high carbonation. Carbonation is a little bright, and would make this more enjoyable if it was turned down a notch. I honestly can't get any real feel for the finish, due to the prickly nature of this beer. Not likely to have again."
"Sweet orange citrus malt with faint citrus hop balanced by toasty malt. Not that bitter, bitter hop in back. Smooth, juice-like mouthfeel although it is accompanied by mild a syrupy astringency usually seen in higher abv beers. Overall, a pleasantly balanced amber with high drinkability."
"D- Decent, not bad, just kind of bland."
"12oz bottle from Barb's Beer Emporium in Concord. Pours a slightly hazy copper body with a half inch of off-white head. Aroma is very very subdued, but hints of hops and malt make it out. Caramel malt with some herbal hops in the flavor. Medium in both mouthfeel and carbonation, with moderate drinkability. I wonder if I may have a slightly less than fresh bottle, which would be more the fault of where I got it than the brewer, but all I can see here is a fairly standard middle of the road American Amber."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy orange/amber color with lots and lots of rising carbonation. The head was two fingers of Dijon-tan foam that retained beautifully as a cap and the lacing was also quite good. The aroma was toasted malt with a slight mustiness, floral hops and a light mineral-like quality. The flavors were les than impressive, citrus hops and hints of caramel malt amongst cereal grains and a slight earthiness. Not bad, but rather washed out and ill-defined. The carbonation was a little too high which roughed up the mouthfeel and the body was medium. Just ok."
"Amber colored pour with a thin white head that quickly fades. Aroma of sweet malt. Taste of caramel malt and sugar. Sharp mouthfeel, though not overpowering. Sweet malt flavor gradually blends with a subtle hop finish with a dirty citrus tang to it. Nice for a session, very drinkable."
"Mouth feel was medium/light and it was very drinkable. A nice Amber... I've grown partial to the more hoppy of this style, but this certainly with well within style guidelines and a good representation."
"Poured a brownish-red color that looked better up against the light. Had a thin, fizzy head that faded fairly quickly. The smell was dominated by hops: a little floral, but mostly a strong, spicy, tangy hop smell. There was also plenty of a sweet, caramel maltiness in there too. It was an interesting mix. The taste combined these two flavors as well: one one hand, there were bready, buttery, tasted malts that ended with a touch of caramel. On the other hand, there was dry, bitter hop flavor. But to me, unlike the smell, the taste did not work out. The mixture sounds nice, and should have produced a beer that I enjoyed. But the taste was just a little off to me, and the bitterness and sweetness seemed contrary to one another, as opposed to complimentary. I think that the flavors were a bit too strong, and the beer could have benefitted from some more subtle tastes. I ended up finishing the beer, but I didn't really want to."
"Pours to a clear reddish brown, with very little head and no lace. Rich Aroma, very pleasant. This is my second red amber over the past few days, and this is definitely a style I enjoy. A Bold flavor, yet not a heavy beer at all. I expected it to be heavier, but it does not detract one bit from the flavor. Mild to light carbonation (seems to work well with this beer). I can see having a few of these at a sitting, great flavor and drinkability. I would definitely buy this if available in a local beverage center."
"D - A very drinkable, pretty good representation of the amber style."
"This is a fine medium balanced brew that really hits the spot. The hop profile is just big enough to be tasted but doesn't take away from the malts. I like the slight twinge of sourness that bites the sides of your tongue. Well done."
"Drinkability: I like this beer a lot. I had it for the first time with a dinner of fish and vegetables, and it went great. It's not overly heavy or filling, so it won't make you feel weighed down. A great beer which is delicious when cold."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and a great tasting beer that would not overpower the taste buds or be so dominant as to distract from what you are doing."
"D - This is a decent sessionable amber ale; not very complex, but tasty enough."
"D- Average. I could sit down and drink this all day at a pub, should the opportunity arise. It's not too filling to not want to drink more."
"Another selection from the BOTMC. Smells Oktoberfest-like malty with earthy centennial-like hopping. Pours to a dark golden color with a decent clingy head. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Carbonation well done, not too much nor too little. Good body. This is a very well balanced ale. Reminds me alot of a Sam's but with a bit more bitterness. For the style this hits the mark. Refreshing and balanced from start to finish. Nothing complex but a good down to earth ale. I would return to this brew."
"Drinkability: Nothing to write home about. There's not much good beer flavor, even once you strip away the banana esters."
"It's not a world beater, but it's multi-purpose, tasty, and makes for a pretty solid pairing with foods tomato-based foods."
"Solid carbonation, a little thin. Very easy to have a number of these."
"Medium-bodied amber color with a medium head and just a little bit of lace. Rich, malty flavor with some spices mixed in there. Slightly bitter in the finish and aftertaste. Malty aroma too with malts overall dominating this one. All around pretty average."
"Pours a vibrant amber oaky hue. Nice, buck hide colored head rises up and then falls to a nice thick 1/2"" tightly held head. Smell begins with a nice caramel covered red apple, a touch of pine resin, hints of hay and fresh cut grass. Taste is rounded out with a balance between the caramel, sweet apple, touch of dark wheat bread, some pined up earthy notes and a nice refreshing finish. Great gulper! Easy to drink."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is just an ordinary beer overall, but it's still worth drinking for a while."
"Taste is mostly malty with some burnt bitterness to it, hard to describe but it's not entirely pleasant or off-putting though, just indifferent."
"best drunk dancing at Woodstock."
"This was nice, easy to drink and could be sessioned, but to be honest if you've tried the Pig's Ear there is no need to try this. Its a little different (slightly more bitter & drier) but there is no mistaking the same qualities it shares with the Pig's Ear. I would think there would be a noticeable difference - IMHO there is not a significant one. Could see this working well with simple bar food, cheddar or just enjoying. A nice, easy to drink ale."
"drinkability - I think it was the best one of of the case. Enjoyed this one. I am adding Amber Ales to my list now."
"This beer pours a mild amber color with a thin head. Aroma stands out as being big and malty. Taste is much of the same with a nice biscuity malt flavor that becomes thin and somewhat buttery at the back of the mouth. Interesting taste. Not too impressive but a solid beer altogether."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, resulting in beer with little to no head. The color is bright red, whose nose is slightly sweet but very faint. The resulting beer is a very drinkable red that is a big malty, big mouth feel. The mouthfeel comes from a very carbonated beer, not in a bad way but the bubbles do dance on your tongue, and from a appearance look like a glass of soda with a constant trail of tiny bubbles rising form the bottom of the glass to the surface. The finish is a mix of the malt fading into a dry finish that has a subtle alcohol flavor. Depending on the abv, I could see this beer a as session beer, not great, but not bad either. Worth a try!"
"Pours a red brown amber with a short off-white headskie. Sweet, but not too too sweet. A real basic red ale. Good, but not great. I'm stoked to see Woodstock Inn beers at the store, but they should really bottle their better ones. Still, worth snagging at a good price."
"A 12oz bottle, with best by June 2007 on the label. It was a dark amber color with a small white head. It had a sweet, caramel aroma. Maybe a little malt. Fruity taste, like cherries. Some hops. I thought this beer was a little too fruity, but still enjoyable to drink."
"Light to medium mouthfeel a bit watery with a bit of grainyness.Good drinkability the best beer of the sample pack I had from Woodstock Inn."
"Easily drinkable, this makes for a nice ""session"" beer. Light and refreshing with a good flavor. I can see pairing this with the doughiness and spiciness of a brick-oven pizza."
"this beer is pleasant in it's simplicity, but it is cleary a one trick pony."
"D - a decent session brew, but I couldn't get past the caramel sweetness."
"D: Drinkable beer. Glad i enjoyed this in the bottle. Will be looking forward to visiting the Inn this winter"
"Pours with a thin head that disappates quickly. Aroma is not strong but the maltiness comes through. The first taste is definitely more malt than hops but a slightly bitter finish brings the hops. I'm a fan of a strong malt/hop balance and this brew fits the bill. Mouthfeel is a little thin but overall a good beer. I would buy this one again."
"Flavor is toffee and roasted malt with some grassy hops on the finish. Very easy drinker and nice well crafted brew overall. I would buy this one again."
"Purs a very nice color with a very fruity smell. Tastes of caramel and other fruit flavors that leave a very good taste in your mouth. Doesnt put much head in the glass and it is really not that hoppy however there is a little sour taste in the back of yout mouth. otherwise it is a very good ale."
"Despite a fairly aggressive pour, not much head to be seen. Dissapates quickly to a thin border or foam. Lots of maltiness in the aroma. Upon tasting, it's an onslaught of maltiness with a caramel taste and a hint of fruitiness. There's an odd underlying sourness in the taste as well. Hops are very subdued. All in all, not a bad brew, but I don't think I'd seek it out in the future."
"D - Not bad at all but it doesn't leave you absolutely craving more like some of the really fine beers. Aoso, as it warms a grainy comes out a bit too much. However, overall it's not a bad ale. I'd take this over a macro and some other micro ales IU've tried any day."
"""Worth a try"" is fairly accurate. No real faults with this, but no ohmigod you must try it touches either."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Copper amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium body. Slight malty nose. Starts on the sweeet side , then some hops, finish has some bitterness. $6.99 for a six pack from Market Basket Concord, NH. Brewed for Woodstock Inn by Shipyard Brewery."
"I received a bottle of this in a trade from Pete (ppoitras).This poured with a slight haze and was a bright orangey copper color. The head was firm and had a tint of almond in it. The smell is sweet with buttery caramel malts. Rich and a bit solvent like. Bold and assertive. The taste is rich, bitter and nutty. This seems to have some Doppelbock characteristics with the Vienna or Victory malts coming through. Theres a nice roasted almond nuttiness and a pretty solid body of malt underneath. Overall, a very nice ale and one I would seek out again. Thanks, P!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head over the clear coppery amber brew. Head is frothy and lasts well, with good lacing. Aroma is slightly sweet, with buttery and fruity notes. Taste starts with grain husks, which carry all the way through, with some light bitterness in the middle, and closing with a tinge of butteriness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good. Enjoyable representative of the style."
"The only offering I didn't have on tap while staying at the Inn, I figured I'd take their ""most popular"" brew home in a growler. Its a decent looking beer with a darkish amber body with a reddish tint. The head was thin but finely beaded and well proportioned. Very malty and somewhat floral and breadlike nose. Enticing to say the least. Really a full bodied, well incorporated mouthfeel. Its crisp, malty with a tremendous sense of freshness to the brew. There's a nice breadlike quality that serves the beer well. The finish comes off balanced with a true mellon-like flavor. Really impeccably crisp and quenching, this is a great sociable beer."
"Very tasty, yet another surprise from the basket of goodies brought back by my parents. A no brainer really, this is an easy, tasty brew."
"Light to medium bodied, a good solid average red."
"Wyll-"
"A surprising bottled offering. This brew is bottled by Shipyard. Shipyard brews generally are aok, so an endorsement of this product by their willingness to bottle it, I knew it would be better than ok, and it was, The appearance was a nice amber red with a very nice off white head. The smell was a hoppy, fruity combination. An initial malt taste lasted to mid-palate, then the citrus hops expressed themselves and the brew had a light hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was light to medium and very smooth. This is an extremely drinkable brew..very smooth and easy on the palate."
"I mean, heck, I bet it would be great on cask or something like that, but, again, NOT as an amber - more as an Old-Thumper wanna-be."
"This is a good flavored drinkable beer, but I was disappointed that the head faded so quickly to never be seen again."
"Found this on a sales trip to NH. Pours a deep amber mahogany color with a thin almond colored head. Nice and clear. Aroma is vaguely roasty, sweet, somewhat nutty and bready. Nice. Flavor is much the same, with a nice pale malt sweetness, touched with a bit of roasty bittersweetness and breadiness. Hops are mild, balance the malts nicely and really only lend bitterness at the very end of the sip. Slight pear esters, mostly in the back end and in the finish. I'd have another."
"cheers"
