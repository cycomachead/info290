"Good beer great food you can cook on a hot stone"
"Eh. Tastes kind of dirty. Not earthy. Dirty. Kind of like dirty water. With some amber tones thrown in. (This is an ESB? Or, supposedly one? Really?) I don't get it."

"Average amber, not great but could find worse"
"I remember really liking The Elevator when we lived in Columbus. Unfortunately, this beer doesn't live up to memory."

"Copper amber body with a cream colored off white head, forms nice speckled lacing. Aromatics carry a grainy, husk filled nutty character pretty generic Red Ale qualities, cereal grains minimal to absent hop notes comes off as an herbal earthy character if I had to pick a hop profile. Flavor has cereal grain sweetness, a hint of honey malts, even a Wheaties character...earthy herbal hops in the finish still a bit too sweet for my tastes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied texture wise with carbonation ample a bit of residual sugars cling to the palate after each sip. Overall, many more beers I'd rather consume especially considering I'm not the typical Bleeding Buckeye."

"Holy carbonation! Normal pour with an overflowing head. Poured a copper color with a khaki colored head; quite a bit of lacing is retained on the glass. Head lingers for quite some time too. Smells of bready malts and some caramel sweetness. Maybe some butterscotch too. The taste is very similar but it has a off-putting metallic taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation too. Not really bitter either. Not a huge fan of this one."

"Well....This is dissapointing. I grabbed one of these on a whim during an Ohio buying trip bur kinda wish I hadn't. This offering pours a very dark mahogany color with almost no head. The aroma is slightly funky with Lots of malt and a very slight hop aroma. The flavor is all roasted malts and a little hops but they seem very stale. This is dissapointing and I hope just a little old. I'd try again if I knew this was fresh."

"O: This beer tastes a little lighter in body compared to other beers in the style and tastes a little like a hybrid between an ESB and an Irish Red Ale."

"Mouthfeel: Bleeding buckeye is a light bodied red ale with a tasty blend of malt and hops and a nice clean finish."

"This is a fairly well- balanced beer, medium in body and pleasant overall. Even if youâ€™re not a diehard Buckeye fan, you will find many things to like about this beer. It may not rank in your all- time top ten for its style, but there is certainly enough quality here to recommend a sample or two."

"Pours medium amber with a 1 inch khaki head. The head stays longer than I expected, over a minute. Sweet malty aroma which turns a little hoppy at the end. The hop bitterness seems to be equally matched with the malt here. Very balanced, and very easy to drink. I'm quite impressed with this one. Not every beer needs to knock your socks of with hops and strong ABV. This is just a plain, down and dirty beer. On a side note, I do think the name is kinda lame."
""

"The mouthfeel is almost as balanced as the rest, though I can see where someone might prefer to go a touch creamier and drop off a little bit of the thickness on the palate. It's not slick, but it comes close. The medium body holds it together well."
""
""
""
"If you're not a hop fiend or simply want a change of pace, this should do the trick. Not exceptional, but not at all bad."
""
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable ESB. Kind takes some of the best of an Irish red and combines it with a regular red ale. I like the mix of sweetness and bitterness here. Certainly a beer I would do a six of if I was in the area."
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small earthiness and notes of spice. In the taste, a caramel like roast, and somewhat spicy, yet a bit thin. A spice like bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry spice like aftertaste. Hint of earth and some spice, decent and average."
""
"Medium body, with some soft carbonation. A simple beer here, nothing outstanding in either direction."

"O- A very drinkable beer. Does not taste like any ESB I have ever had, but it is pretty good."
"One of my hophead friends really likes this so I was wary..he loves IPA and I don't. This beer looks good, smells good, and is a pleasure to the mouth and tongue. It has a great balance between malt and hops..both can be enjoyed. The finish is clean and refreshing..not as neat as Pilsner Urquell or as malty as Paulaner Oktoberfest, but a harmonious blend of hops and malt. I am excited because it is also made right down the road in Columbus. I will make a trip there soon."

"D - at first was a bit put off by the brew as I was expecting something different, after I adjusted my expectation not a bad beer, nicely balanced, crisp finish, a beer you can easily drink."
"O - This is a decent, easy drinking beer. Based on the packaging I thought they were going for more of an irish red, but apparently this is supposed to be an ESB ... I'd prefer they were a bit more forward with the style instead of leaning heavily on the status of The Ohio State University to sell this beer."
"Overall impression: Nothing wrong with an decent easy-drinking brew, and this one fits the bill."
"D: A fairly priced red ale that goes down smooth, pretty darn drinkable"
"D: Although i got a bit of a metallic taste, it is a pretty drinkable. Definitely worth a try for the style."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper/red color with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is all toasted and caramel malt. The taste is mostly like the aroma, but there's also a weird metallic taste that I don't care for. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium with good carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but would be better if that metallic taste wasn't there. Overall it's not a bad beer, but it's not something I'd drink very often."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is well balanced and fairly drinkable with the mineral quality being the only thing that is a bit off-putting. I notice this is listed as an ESB which conflicts with the new style label that advertises this as a Red Ale. Regardless it was decent and worth a try if you dig the style(s)."
"M- Dryer than a sun-bleached bone. All of the effervescent is an indication of what this beer might feel like. Its quite prickly, overly so. This beer would be right in line with its English kin if it weren't for this."
"Drinkability is good. A rich, tasty malty beer. I could see this in someones rotation in areas where this beer is sold."
"D - This is a solid beer. If I could get this distributed to my area I would be a six pack regular."
"Pours a copper color with ruby highlights and a one finger head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of caramel malts and some pale malts with hints of citrus hops. The taste has a nice caramel malt backbone along with some pale malt. At the backend is a slight citrus and pine hop bite with a little hint of sweetness in the middle to backend. The mouthfeel is moderate to heavy carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer, nice flavor, a little weak aroma. The sweetness and hop bite bring the middle and end through nicely. An easy drink."
"Reasonably good drinkability. It's nothing special but not bad. I much prefer their Horus."
"This was a fun beer to drink and good for a style that you don't see much"
"Cheers!!!!"
"In the end, it's a nice beer but the qualities that make Irish Reds great has a hard time showing here."
"Bizarre carmelly citrus taste with a thinner than average finnish. Reminds me of a very heavy and less bright Killians. Pours much thicker but head has no retention whatsoever, at least not on my glass. Mouthfeel is thinner than average as well, for some reason I expected more of a candy-bar feel. Drinkability is simply average; this is an above average beer but they themselves can do much better."
"Drinkability: A good beer with solid yet tame flavors. By far the best beer at the restaurant I was in. My wife had a Killian's Irish Red and it tasted like water next to this one."
"Drinkability is outstanding. I'll probably have to get growlers of this since that's the only way I know of apart from on-tap that they sell it in."
"Drinkability- Quite smooth and drinkable for the swilling needs. Well worth a revisit one day."
"I had a pint of this beer at Lucky's on Court Street in Downtown Athens, OH. It pours a nice scarlet red with a good head. It tasted like a fresh microbrew should. It was hoppy but not so overpowering. It was smooth with a lasting tang then a quick finish. It was a great accompaniment to the Italian sub it was served with. What a great paring! If you are ever in Athens stop by and grab a bite and a Buckeye Red!"
"Overall, I'd gladly pick this one up again, although I've tasted stronger ales, and have other favorites at the Elevator."
"D: Very drinkable beer."
"Well, being a PSU fan in Columbus, was hoping for the Buckeyes to bleed a bit, but wasn't the case that day, but an apropos name nonetheless. A solid beer, and one that I'd probably have again should I be in the neighborhood."
"Elevator changed the name on this one from Bott Brothers ESB in an attempt to avoid scaring customers away with the word ""bitter"" and to cash in on OSU. Whatever. On draught at Players Sports Bar in the Adam's Mark hotel in downtown Columbus. Pours a rich amber color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is fairly hoppy with malt undertones. Medium-bodied and really not all that bitter after all. Slightly sweet finish after you get through the initial hops aftertaste. Not a great beer but I wish every hotel bar had an option like this."
"This is a new name for the former ESB. The publican, Rita, told me that they had to change the name because too many people would not try something with the name Extra Special Bitter. Bitter this is not, in fact, it tends more to its malt side than the bittering hops. It has a good flavor indeed and is quite drinkable. The look is of clear amber under an ivory head. It shows good lacing effect and is smooth on the palate. A good, refreshing beer that is none the less for its name."
"This beer poured out a medium amber color.  Formed a white head with a decent lace, even if the head subsided more than I would like.  Light aroma of hops and malt.  Slightly sweet, with a nice body for an ESB.  I would consider it too sweet for an ESB, but not bad.  As a side note, they offered to make it a Sour Apple ESB by adding the necessary liqour.  If you look at an earlier Beerfly review of flavored beer here, I am not happy with this trend.  As I said before, last I checked, that was not how it's done"
