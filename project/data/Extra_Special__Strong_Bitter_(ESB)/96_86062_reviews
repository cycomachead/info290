"Overall, this is nothing worth mentioning. An overall light profile leaves me bored."

"Boorrriing."

"If you have the opportunity, give it a try. I wouldn't run out to the store specifically looking for it, but it's a nice seasonal beer with a unique twist."
"There is a little dry herbal spruce spice in the aftertaste, but it's masked by a general watery soggy grain flavor. As it warms there's some low level crackery malt, but it's pretty mild overall. Light bodied, a little thin. Nothing special, but if you love spruce beers give it a try."

"Pours a light orange with and off white head that fades fast. Smell is not very strong but it is mainly the spruce and a sweet malt. The taste starts with the spruce, not overpowering, but still the main focus to the beer. A nice sweet malt starts, but a bitter finish with a dry aftertaste with not much spruce. A nice smooth medium mouthfeel, an easy drinker if you are a fan of the taste. Not something I could have many of, but still a nice beer. Overall a good beer, not overpowering, mostly focuses on the spruce, but a good flavor."

"Overall: Recently picked this up in a variety pack, and easily the weakest one of the group. I don't hate it but it's easily specially acquired taste. Have one on me...Salud!"
"Not as complex as I though it would have been, a little out of balance but since the spruce is not that agressive the dryness actually helps in the area ... sadly it leaves the beer a in a lackluster state. A good stepping stone for anyone that has not had a spruced beer before and perhaps even an extreme beer."

"OK...took it to my qualified beer taster and she said, toilet bowl cleaner. Now, friends, I'm not agreeing with that, but, it shows lack of great taste. Really, this is not what I would crave to quaff after work, or before...or during work, unless it was really bad work but hey, that's a 4 letter word and I'll conclude by saying, flavorful, but not in the combination I think accurate for the label ESB = Extra Special Bitter, or for anything fully satisfying in a beer. I feel bad to say this as I don't regularly rate beers in this category, but knowing this category, this is off and not especially tasty."
"The taste has a very light citrus hop flavor with a malt backbone coming in on the finish. the mouth feel is nice, a little after taste on the back of the tonuge, overall it is a nice,easy drinking beer."

"o-I like this...def good...will look for this in the spring. I think it will be nicer in the spring or summer."

"O- it's pretty clean and easy to drink (except for the high carbonation), but doesn't really drink like an ESB."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into narrow pint glass. Crystal clear gold with a thick foamy head that shrunk to half its size and then stuck around for a bit, leaving some sticky lacing. Smells hoppy and sour. Taste is crisp and clean up front, with a nice pinch finish of hops. Upon exhaling through my nose after my first sip, a faint essence of spruce or pine is noticed. Not outstanding, but easy to drink and tasty."
"Color was great at the first pour, but as it sat it became almost mudded in appearance. the smell was good, but uneventful. No indication of the flavor to come.... or was it? smooth feel on the tounge and has an almost cleansing feel and a tast was taste leaving you wanting anouther sip. But alas the flavor was not what i wanted it to be. I see a beer with a spruce mention in the flavor and i do get a hint but not the kick that i was wanting, neh NEEDING, Over all it makes me want anouther beer but this one will not quench the thirst."

"Overall: Without the spruce, standing alone as an ESB, it doesn't fare too well, really. Add the spruce gimmick, it's not much better. Lackluster offering."
""
"OK; NOTHING SPECIAL!"
""
""

"Overall the beer fits the ESB character, it is a good enjoyable brew!"

"this wooly esb from magic hat is a milder take on the esb style. the look of this beer is golden with a slight haze. the smell is earthy with a little bit of piney citrus. wooly is hoppy with a bitter kick at the end. i do however, feel like it is milder than others esb's that i have had, which isnt a bad thing. it is a lot more drinkable than some others. so i guess it all depends on if you want a really hearty esb, or if you want something that you can drink and enjoy while you watch the game or just fat-around. i like this one ok over all."
"O- The thought was there, but it doesn't taste like beer. It's just a collection of strange flavors."
"O: Nothing wrong with this at all. There's no wow factor or 'zing', but I can't find anything bad with this. I wouldn't purchase this again, but I'd never refuse one."
"O: Way too much spruce to be enjoyable. It wouldn't be half bad if the spruce was just a compliment to the base, but it really overpowers the beer. I respect what MH was going for here, but again, just way too much spruce"

"Thanks, acurtis, for the opportunity"

"O: I really enjoyed this beer, very unique in the aroma and taste. The spruce is nice and sweet, where I thought it would be a little over the top or to uncharacteristic of a beer. Quite simply, the best ESB I have ever drank."
""
""
"O - A solid beer, but seems to be something."
""
"This is an interesting brew, but not something that I'd find myself craving again. Really could use a touch more sweetness to round things out."

"Overall, interesting one-dimensional spruce beer."
""

"overall: clean and crisp, smooth, slightly malty but not too sweet, easy to drink"
""
"Overall an easy drinking, clean ale."
"I'll have to taste the Alaskan winter beer again, which is flavored with spruce that I remember more fondly than this. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Grapevine Liquors in Denver."
""
"Clear honey amber with a frothy beige head that lingers long. Low aroma of corn. Flavors of honey malt, subtle floral hops, sharp bitterness, metallic notes, evenly balanced, piney spruce notes, somewhat subtle but noticeable and a bit reminiscent of cleaning solution. Crisp and dry mouthfeel, somewhat thin. Average beer."
"forget what everyone says, this is absolutely delicious. it is an elglish style bitter, a mild one at that, but that is the base upon which a generous spruce addition is infused, resulting in a full bodied, seasonally perfect, refreshingly yummy winter ale. the nose is really piney, both oily and sappy, which could also be aided by the strong hop presence for the style. rich but not sweet malts, bordering on amber in color and taste temper the intensity of the spruce, but they work well in tandem. finish is crisp and akin to a christmas tree. my brother said its like drinking a hippie, but i didnt think so (who am i to say?). the low alcohol and fuler body make this a nice winter session beer, and the carbonation is upbeat too, which helps the cause. overall i like this a lot better than the winter seasonals that came before it, i think it shows a nice inventive side on the heels of the dandelion summer brew. top quality i thought."

"Overall a curiosity. My favorite spruce beer was made by the late Siletz Brewing Co. in Oregon with fresh spruce tips."
"while not the best ESB out there, its certainly different and drinkable."

"Light and almost bubbly in the mouth, very smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad beer overall, but the flavor, while good, does not assert itself enough. Nice addition to the Magic Hat Winter variety pack with room for improvement though."
""
""
"Overall: A very unimpressive beer. A really sub-par ESB any day, plus the fact that it doesn't really deliver on the promised spruce flavors and aromas. Skip this one."
""
""
"This beer has a almost burnt dark malt taste that is just a bit over the top for me, and as it sits it seems to become more prominent and to me less desirable."
"Not very ESB-like but good."
""
"Wooly has a great pour, a crystal-clear red-orange with a sizable head. The aroma is good, but seems a bit two faced. I'll stick my nose to the glass and get beautiful caramel malts with a big spruce hit, then I'll go back for another whiff and get sweet grains and wheat. It might be the spruce messing with me, because the spruce comes on strong right away. The spruce is backed up by some caramel and pale malts, and rounded out by some herbal hops. A little odd, just like Pistil was, but still very nice. The mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, Wooly is another unique, odd, and still drinkable beer from Magic Hat."

"Can a brother get some Sam the Sham up in here?? This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises puffed rice, funky wheat, and old greens. The hell? There's spruce in this? This isn't a year old? Hmm... The taste brings the spruce into reality, though unfortunately by drowning it in dry-tasting caramel bespackled with old leaves. Dammit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a bone dry finish. Overall, this was just odd and sad. There's pretty much no ESB character, and whatever else is there doesn't come through as well-melded."
"Pours a clear amber color with a large white head. Excellent retention and cling. Medium to high in carbonation. Smell is similar to #9, slightly fruity, a little malty and a hint of citrus. Taste is very similar to #9 without the over the top fruit flavor. In wooly, the fruit is more subtle, there is a spiciness and citrus character to the hops that balance well with the big malty character of this beer. Overall very nicely done beer, I will be having more probably. I would call this #9's older more manly, less fruity brother."

"Overall a good ESB but I'm not sure the spruce makes it better than it would be without."
