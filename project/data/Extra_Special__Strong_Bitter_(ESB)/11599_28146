Nose of roasted caramel and toffee, with hints of coffee in the backbone, too. Flavors are a toffee and coffee blend forward, with a bittersweet balance throughout. Smooth and light bodied, with a richly sweet and roasted aftertaste. The flavor is smooth and sweet. Solid, simple, balanced, well crafted brew.","GarthDanielson","Jul 26, 2014"

Balanced flavor of biscuity malts, chocolaty sweetness, toasted caramel, and some grassy, floral hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a creamy feel thanks to a lower amount of carbonation. Pretty nice little easy drinker here. I've come to appreciate Green Man more over the last couple of years.","wedge","Feb 15, 2014"

3.31,-10.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"I had this on draft at Twelve Bones in Asheville, NC. Nice beer, with a great brown color and decent head. Not as much on the aroma side of things as I would expect, but that could have been part of sitting outside. I got a malty backbone to this, and not so much of the hoppiness that I would have expected out of an ESB. Tasty beer, just not what I had expected.","Fulkrum78","Aug 25, 2011"
4.08,10.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a reddish amber with little head. Nose detects caramel and nutty malts. Taste is robust offering caramel and nutty malts but a clean hop bitterness to finish. Clean and well balanced. Medium to full bodied. A nice first introduction to Green Man.","tdm168","Jul 19, 2011"

3.92,6.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Rock solid ESB. From the growler to the pint glass. Pours a light amber with thin whitish head. Green man malts are easily identifiable and this makes for a very distinctive taste, the malt is very similar to their IPA, but tones of caramel, distinct bitterness but reduced hoppiness provides the distinction. This is a very easy drinking brew and one of my favorite ESBs.","raszputini","Mar 21, 2011"
3.34,-9.5,4,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"On-tap at Jack of the Wood in a shaker pint. A hazy aged copper with a quarter inch of off-white head that stuck around and deposited a thin sheet of lace down the glass. Smell: really sparse -- toffee, minerally. Taste: toffee, decently fruity, apricot, mildly nutty, with an earthy and herbal bitterness. Finishes earthy and a little nutty, drying. Decent.","babaracas","Mar 20, 2011"
3.66,-0.8,4,3,4,3,4,"It's funny, at first I was not impressed with this ESB, HOWEVER, through finishing the glass casually I learned to enjoy it. Maybe it was the brewmaster giving the history of ESBs or just grew to liking the beer, but I believe I could enjoy a few more of these. It's a nice caremely color, like a golden amber if that makes any sense. Mouth-feel is about what I expected from a beer of it's stature, but after a few sips/gulps I really liked it.","dmbdusty41","Feb 25, 2011"
4.2,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I've been excited to try this beer for a few reasons: One, it's a local place and I appreciate that. Two, it comes recommended by a friend. This beer was good. I thoroughly enjoyed the intense hoppy flavor, which I was not expecting. It had a robust, natural element. I enjoyed the ""rawness"" and heaviness despite the fact that it is only 5.3%. Maybe there is power of suggestion in the name, but earthy and organic came to mind as well. I could have a few of these in a row and am looking forward to trying Green Man's other beers.","beerdown77","Jan 14, 2011"
4.39,19,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability was fantastic - this beer had more flavor than some beers I've tried twice its size. Fantastic beer.","JohnQVegas","Oct 31, 2010"
3.85,4.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Served on tap at the brewery into an Aviator shaker. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, and subtle roasted malt. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice ESB. The flavor was nicely balanced with the sweet and roasted malts. The aroma was a little lacking as far as intensity, but still wasn't bad. Worth trying for an ESB fan out there.","thagr81us","Oct 18, 2010"

3.63,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"On cask at Jack of the Wood.Poured a clear rich bronze with a thin soapy-like head atop,fruity malt notes in the nose with light toast,and lingering leafy hop although light.A tad thin in the feel with malt tilted fruit on the palate,some biscuit and caramel sweetness as well makes it more malt tilted,a leafy hop smack comes in the finish.A decent ESB but I have had better.","oberon","Apr 19, 2010"
3.95,7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D-A very well done American version of this English classic. The cask delivery is iconic and makes this quite the session brew.","Deuane","Jan 10, 2010"

3.62,-1.9,3,3.5,4,4,3,"Copper brown color and kind of hazy. There was almost no head, and I believe this was the last of the cask left, which may have contributed to the low carbonation. The smell is wonderful, at least to me. Smells kind of like 'raw' beer, like boiled wort. Very sweet smell, and a bit estery, kind of like a tea smell. The taste is a bit woody, you can tell its from a cask. Tastes very sweet, without a whole lot of bitterness, but it balanced out the beer to keep the sweetness from being cloying. Tastes a bit like sweet tea, from the floral esters in the beer. The mouthfeel is nice and full. Though there was almost no carbonation. I actually started to like this beer once I got into it. There was good balance and drinkability, and I may have a second one or revisit it, but not something I'd want all the time. The esters were just a bit too dominant for me.","taylorhamrick","Jan 10, 2009"

3.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Deep amber with a somewhat fizzy head and fading pretty quick. Nice lacing down the glass. Good smell of grain, lightly toasted bread, caramel, and earthy hops. Taste is a bit more expansive than the smell, which was a somewhat muted. Lots of roast flavor, more than I expected form the nose or a beer of this type. Some chocolate and caramel. Toasted bread. Finishes fairly bitter with a crisp hop bite. In the mouth it's fairly smooth but a chalky bitterness from the hops takes away from that at times. Very easy to drink. I enjoyed the entire growler, simply because this stuff is hard to put down. Tasty enough and while there's not much to it, this helps drinkability. One that you can figure out pretty quickly and then sit back and enjoy. Glad I grabbed it.","ncvbc","Oct 11, 2008"

3.45,-6.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"It's a fine beer, however there are a few things about it that offsets the style. A good firm malt base seems to headge on sweet barley grains with a bit of astringency (husks) in the mouthfeel. The hops also seem a bit high, citrus / pine, and bite-ey. But the beer comes together nicely with a cleanly brewed taste of fermentation and attenuation. Nearly mint-y in the finish. Body could be maltier with a higher gravity (use English malts) would have sweetened the beer and rounded out the (American) hop abrasion. Call it beer, and it's pretty tasty stuff. Call it an ESB, and it stumbles a bit.","BEERchitect","Sep 12, 2007"
4,8.4,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer was a bit lighter than most ESB's. The smell was bitter. The taste was bitter with a sweet ending. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth. The drinkability was good. I could drink these again. I was going to get this in my growler but the Oatmeal Stout was awfully good.","Enola","May 08, 2006"
