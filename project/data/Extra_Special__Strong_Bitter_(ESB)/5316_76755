Nose of is subtle with hints of caramel malts, light herbal hops, and some light bread qualities. Flavor is mild caramel malts with light hops bitterness to the back, mellowed out by the malt. Very nice mouth feel with light bittering hops on the aftertaste. Nice all around session beer for the more novice beer nut or a good one for large get-togethers.","Brutaltruth","Jul 25, 2014"

And though faint in aroma, bitterness comes through well to taste, providing a good offset to the strong malt flavor. It's too bad hop flavor is a bit lacking. This feels more like a generic amber American ale than an ESB. It's drinkable enough, but not worth a special release.","allengarvin","Jul 03, 2014"

I've been a homebrewer since 1992, so, I can tell when something has gone wrong in the brewing process, The beer starts out well enough, fairly malty and dry. But, then, uh oh. What is that WEIRD after taste, that lingers and lingers? I can only figure the brew was fermented at too warm a temperature, or something is not right with the yeast strain. I was hoping for an English style (Fullers') or American (Anderson Valley) ESB taste. Not even close. Please reformulate your recipe.","thebeergeek","Apr 06, 2014"

There's a mix of sweet toasted bread with mild cherry and a touch of strawberry. Then a mild lemon spice hop character kicks up as the beer finishes to give a lovely balance to the fruit and barley. Very nice beer overall. Fruitier than other ESBs I've enjoyed, but well balanced, if a touch thick. I'd love to try it from a cask.","tempest","May 31, 2013"

Not a bad choice for a good session beer.","coldriver","Mar 25, 2012"

3.95,8.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Pours a medium copper amber, nice two finger very light tan head with good retention and lacing. Looks good. Aroma dominated by bready malt with surprising faint hop and Belgian spices. Flavor also full bready and biscuity malt with slightly citrus hops and light fruit. Finishes with malt, a nice hop kick and a bit of drying citrus. Nice mellow flavor progression and finish. Medium bodied with some creaminess. I really enjoyed this take on a ESB.","LiquidAmber","Mar 05, 2012"

The smell is a little malty, some bread and caramel malts, with a little hop presence. The feel is medium. The taste has a little bit of hop bite, the taste is of bread and caramel malts, a little citrus, some more bitterness on the way down, light bitterness though.","DavidST","Mar 04, 2012"

3.86,5.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"O: This is my first Full Sail brew, and I enjoyed it. I like the ideas of single-hop beers for educational purposes, and the label indicated Challenger (UK) hops with 5 malts. Worth a try.","videofrog","Feb 26, 2012"
3.75,2.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Strong aroma is malty with fruity, earthy and woody notes. It pours a clear coppery with a pale yellow-tan head of about average thickness and persistence. Flavor has a woody core with a fairly, but not fiercely, bitter overtone and hints of caramel, grass and horehound. Smooth, firm texture is quite fizzy and lively. This "initial pub offering" is worth an investment!","Cyberkedi","Feb 26, 2012"

Solid balance, flavor, and sweetness, and doesn't contain Full Sail's flagship yeast character that so many of their other beers have. Certainly a nice change for them.","Docer","Jan 30, 2012"

Also proceeds go to educational charity Dark amber/red ale with a very nice looking thick,creamy eggshell white head. Nice aromas of resiny and floral hops..balanced by caramel malts. Taste is very balanced between the hops and the extra chewy caramel/toffee malts..slight bitter after taste. Nice The mouthfeel is were ,for me,this really gets great..its so balanced ,yet so smotth,carbonation just right..slips over the tongue yet still leaves great sensation .Excellent. A tasty well balanced beer very English in its palate that i could drink a few of without doubt","Reidrover","Jan 08, 2012"
