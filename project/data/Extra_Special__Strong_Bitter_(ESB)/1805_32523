3.75,-0.8,,,,,,"a colossal esb, as hoppy as any ipa, but still very much done in the English tradition. bronze in color, mostly clear, and holding a white head for quite awhile. also a real affordable bomber around 5 bucks, super fair here. an aroma of grassy bittering hops in aggressive proportion, and enough carbonation to tickle my nostrils as I sniff. malt is big too, some probably 60 crystal, as well as some maris otter or the like, its bready and fat I the middle, and a higher gravity English ale yeast dries it up pretty good. the hops are center stage throughout though, and the balance that the style usually demonstrates is ignored. that's okay through, the magnum is a fun varietal not often used in such hefty doses and I think the result is good. rock art has evolved nicely over the years, and this extreme series is all worth checking out. love the hoppy Vermont stuff, and rock art deserves more attention for its hoppy beers. top quality.","StonedTrippin","Jul 30, 2014"

The smell of this beer was definitely dry hopped and gives off plenty of floral hop aromas in the nose. The taste of the beer was nice but again not a traditional ESB flavor. Big amounts of bitter flavors dominate the maltiness of this brew. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a nice smooth texture with a sharp crisp finish to it. Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit but if you're expecting a true ESB style beer look elsewhere because this one is more like an IPA.","Knapp85","Aug 03, 2012"

Taste is better, a good amount of grapefruit in the finish, some carmel in the beginning to go with the flavors detected in the nose.

Judging from the aroma this isn't like an ESB I've had before. Taste is malty up front for a couple of milliseconds before the hops assault my palette with all they've got. Bitter herbal resinous citrus hop bite infused with pale and maybe a hint of toffee. Bitter dry finish. Medium body, bitter resinous mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. Pretty good Ipa, but it could probably use a bit more malt backbone. I'm not sure I would ever attach a British style designation to a clearly American take on a beer.

3.47,-8.2,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"D - A pretty drinkable ale, however I could probably find many that are more drinkable in this category - I consider this less and ESB and more in the strong ale vein. It probably has a couple months age on it, but it didn't really hinder the hop flavor that much and I do think it is a relatively easy quaff for the 8% it packs - a nice balance compared to others of its ilk.","Slatetank","Mar 31, 2010"
3.85,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a nonic pint. Amber color and slightly hazy with a nice rocky, white head. Aromas of toasted malt, nuts and a bit of hop.

It's sweet smelling with some mild bready notes. The hops are present, but take a back seat to the malts. The taste is good as well. It has a solid malt bill that's big on caramel and bisquit malts. It's bitter, but not overly so; at least it's balanced. It goes down easy with a piney hop finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I'm not sure it's the best ESB, but it's complex, bitter, and quite enjoyable.","WesWes","Jan 17, 2010"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours hazy deep copper with a dense cream colored head that rises an inch above the beer. Smell is dense and hoppy with pine and grapefuit and a thick caramel malt backbone.

4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This one had been aging for the better part of a year before I finally tapped it. It's a cloudy amber color with a modest off-white head that quickly fades to a ring with a modicum of random lacing. The aroma is a thick piney hops and licorice alcohol, grapey malt, beautiful. The flavor is malt-wheat, along the lines of a barleywine with a mellow herbal hop bitter edge and some nutty warmth. It really improves as it warms. Smooth and viscous, mildly carbonated. Very good overall, especially for a barleywine guy like me. Fair drinkability at the least, depending upon your alcohol criteria.","Durge","Mar 31, 2009"

Wafting this one, I get some big toasty and earthy British malt tones with a very solid earthy British hop behind it. There is a light alcohol puff in there that accentuates the earthy notes, and brings out some pine and woodsy notes in the hop. It is enjoyable. The flavor is right on line with the aroma, giving me a blast that combines peppery, earthy and woodsy hop that are accentuated by an alcohol kick and spiceyness. It moves to a more toasted breadyness from the malt, and finishes with a solid resinous woody hop with a moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick, with a mild carbonation.

The MET ESB3 pours a rich amber color, almost honey gold in it's hues, with a nice frothy head (alpha acids working their magic?). The nose on this beer is very spicy and hoppy, with almost no detection of malts which maybe is due to late addition hops coupled with dry-hopping (I'm guessing). The first taste is full of peppery citrusy hop bite and a crisp dry finish, but after a few more sips the hops balance out and there is a very nice malt sweetness that blends with the strong hop bitterness to offer a very tangy yet still dry finish. This is a very very hoppy and well balanced ale, and the malt flavors I would expect from an ESB are definitely present, but the hops take over very quickly with big grapfruity piney flavors. This is an excellent brew, but I need to do further research with it to see if I can fully appreciate the idea that this is a double (or as the brewer seems to imply triple) ESb. A very good selection, and highly endorsed.","miskatonic","Nov 26, 2006"

On the palate, sweet caramel malts with an orange tinge give way to hop bitterness at the mid-palate and a dry finish. The hops are rather piney, but they also have a funk that fits in well with the malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a bit of alcoholic hotness, and brash-but-not-overdone hop oils.

Has a wonderfully crisp mouthfeel, finishing long and then clean.","dherling","Nov 16, 2006"
4.17,10.3,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This came with a fluffy, light-tan head. The color was a very cloudy (unfiltered, I was told) deep-amber. The nose was rich with hops, accompanied by a lightly malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was medium, with a piney, sticky, resinous (hey, what am I reviewing here?) hop presence. This is the type of beer that will remind even a novice as to which family of plants from which the hop is derived. I was further told that you have to like Tomahawk hops, or you will be sucking wind before your first sip. The disclaimer on the bottle said it all. Yes, I had it on tap, but I also looked at the bottle. The finish was where the malt really came in. Tasty? Oh, yeah, for a hophead. More? Well, at 8% ABV, I had to go easy.","woodychandler","Nov 14, 2006"
3.79,0.3,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Not extraordinary, but very good, and something I'd buy again. This is nice, since I've been underwhelmed by some of their other offerings, including Ridge Runner and the IPA. This beer will make be keep trying them.","warmstorage","Nov 10, 2006"

4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy amber brew. Head holds acceptably, with coating lace. Aroma is nutty malt with a light piney hop note. Flavor shows the same ample nutty grains upfront, and balancing and more so hoppy bitterness to follow, with some citrus as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft, and drinkability is great. Nice one here from Rock Art, hope it becomes a more regular offering.","ppoitras","0"
3.88,2.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear eddish gold with a large white foamy head. It's a nice looking beer with good lacing and a lasting head. The taste is a malty hop bitter explosion. The intial sip is sweet malt then bitter hops with alcohol. A pretty good Bitter. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well making this a very good beer that should not be missed and one of Rock Art's better beers.","jmz62565","Oct 10, 2006"

3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours cloudy with minimal head. Golden to light amber color. Highly carbonated. Very strong attractive aroma of malt and English hops. Very pleasant maltiness upon tasting that fades to a nice blend of malt, hops and alcohol. Doesn't taste 'extreme', despite its name. Doesn't knock my socks off but very drinkable. An 8% session ale??!","skivtjerry","Aug 28, 2006"
3.43,-9.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Mouthfeel is bready, medium bodied, yeasty, with floral, and spicy earth notes running along the palate.","weeare138","Beers"
4.6,21.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Wow! Pours an amber with a white headskie. Wow! So crisp, so smooth, so mouthsmacking good with all the salvation anyone would ever need to know about. This beer kinda just jumped out of the ground and said it was the new thing to drink in our land of Vermont. Yum! Yum! Yum!","scottum","0"
