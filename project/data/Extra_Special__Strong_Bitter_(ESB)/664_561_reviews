"O: I do like this one but not very drinkable. Not outstanding."
"SPOT ON, TRY THIS BREW!"
"Had this one on cask from Local 44. Pours a light amberish color with nice off-white frothy, milky had about a finger width high. Looks as if it would be served from over in the U.K. Smells of delicate noble hops. Besides that, some light pale malt character. Tastes of pale malts and somewhat bready. Thought it was a little bland as I was expecting more pronounced malt character. Mouthfeel was the best thing about this beer. Creamy, cask flavored English ale. A great session beer to chat over with some friends. Overall, I was disappointed as I was expecting more from the malts & normally characterful English yeast."
"Didn't really taste that bitter, nor was it strong. I enjoyed it, but the label seemed to mislead me, but its probably just the traditional vs. the last 15 years digression."
"Cheers!"
"d) Easy drinking, interesting flavours, best fresh I expect."
"D = A very drinkable beer."
"It poured from a 500 mL bottle copper with a small white head that quickly dwindled to a ring. Caramel malts mingled with some fruity esters, mainly apple and pear. Most of the malt taste has a caramel quality to it, with a slight roasted and/or burnt quality. It sat in good balance with the bitter hops, and the smooth medium body seemed right for the style."
"This is an easy drinking ESB, and the perfect beer to introduce the style to some one. I can recommend this one."
"I would call this one medium-bodied. There is a good level of carbonation. All around a good mouthfeel. This beer has a very nice balance of flavors. Nothing is overpowering, and easy to drink."
"A good old-fashioned English ESP with a distinct flair. This is how a picture a steady, session style English brew. I like it and pretty good considering how old this beer is. I'll have to try a fresher sample soon."
"Overall, Otter Maris pale malt stays only slightly ahead of the East Kent Golding hops. Tasty and easy-to-drink. I have only found in singles, but this one should be in 12 oz. 6-packs, as it makes for a nice ""sessionable"" beer."
"Drinkability: An extremely drinkable brew , i could quaff this baby all night long. The flavors are very pleasant , yet mellow ; begging for another BIG sip."
"M&D: to me the texture is more fizzy than necessary, making this med.-full flavoured ale slightly off-balance on the palate. It reminds me of plenty of Young's ales, all well-crafted, sharing the fruity yeastiness and solid, flavoursome hop-mix using nothing but Fuggles, Sussex Goldings, and Styrian Goldings. A solid premium ale this is, I wish it won't be discontinued with the Ram's moving north..."
"Overall, this is a good ESB. It's best strength is definitely its balance. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I could definitely commit myself to a night of these. Very pleasant taste, nice mouthfeel, and it's not too filling. In fact, after having one, I want a second right now..."
"An OK sessionable ESB. Could be worse, but could be alot better."
"I really liked this from the first sip the initial sweet flavor is VERY gradually replaced by a little hop bitterness but not overpowering. This one is more subtle...which makes it pretty easy drinking, really. All in all I liked it. Would I buy it again? Only after I try it on cask... if they even it put it on cask anywhere..."
"A nice english bitter. Pours a bronzed copper with an off white head that is a pleasure to look at. Smell is of buttery toffee and light caramel malts, a nice floral hop nose. The taste is smooth and delightful, a creamy taste of milk and caramel with a buttered toast, hops are light but pleasant. Enjoyable."
"Drinkability is high. I like this style a lot for a session beer. As with other ESBs, if they were more available/cheaper here in the US, I would drink them more. As it is, I find it hard to come back from the beer store without at least one."
"After being somewhat turned off by this beer, I looked at the best before date...and I'm drinking this 5 months too late. I don't know the magnitude of the change in taste, but I'll give this one another chance later."
"note: this makes me think of super troopers. why? well asifr from the quote, they're both awesome!"
"500 ml bottle best by August 2005. Poured into an imperial pint glass, this is a crystal clear copper with a big head that billows up slightly over the top of the glass, nice retention, moderate amount of lacing. Smell is a little musty, with some light floral notes and an underlying malt with a slight apple fruitiness. Taste is very mellow--a slightly buttery malt, a gentle leafy hoppiness, and an underlying apple/tropical fruit presence. Everything's nicely melded togather--lingering finish is slightly bitter, slightly caramelly. Medium bodied with a gentle carbonation and a silky smooth feel. This is a real solid ESB, easily a sessionable beer."
"The taste can be described as a slightly above average taste, and has a definite fruity tone. One interesting characteristic I noticed is that after about 10 seconds you get a taste on your palate that feels and tastes kind of like mango. WACK! It should be noted that the date on the bottle says ""best before March 05."" I'm going to review this one again when I get a fresher bottle, though I don't think this one tasted old. Recommended."
"So this is a traditional English bitter? Would love to try on tap. Easy to drink would make a great session brew. An above-average brew that, like I said, would be great to have a session with. Not as tasty or complex as its ESB cousins, but then again, thats why they are ESB's and this is not. Glad I gave it a try, but will probably opt for the ESB next time or the Young's Special London Ale."
"5% makes for a good session  I would not classify this one as an ESB"
"Ram Rod is copper colored with plenty of tiny bubbles for carbonation. The good-sized head is creamy and off white. The aroma is an inviting combination of English malts and fruity hops. The taste has plenty of English malt flavor, somewhat earthy, with notes of caramel. Hops provide a moderate bitterness and some dry, fruity flavor. The finish leaves a lingering caramel sweeetness. This is definently an ale I could use as a session beer, there are plenty of very good flavors, but nothing here blows my mind."
"Pours a rich copper color with two fingers of foamy tan head. Really attractive beer. Smell is of sweet, caramel malt, with a bit of herbal character. Big caramel malt sweetness up front, with a little bit of fruity and buttery characteristics. Hop bite is strong and herbal, but not unbalanced or unpleasant in the least. Some have called the hop flavor tea-like, and I can definitely see that. Mouthfeel is slightly metallic at the finish. Really delicious English ale, fully deserving of its reputation. A quintessential bitter and a good session beer."
"An amber-orange ale with a nice cap and modest carbonation. Nose carries notes of sweet ripe fruit and a musty earthy tone. Sweet chewy malt up front, subdued hops add tartness to sweet cidery tastes in the middle and the finish gets slightly dry with the bittering coming in and leaving a metalic after taste....Well crafted...a sweet but mellow ""bitter"" for those who really dont like bitter ales."
"Drinkability: Good session bitter."
"Excellent mid-strength ale from Youngs, and definitely one I'll drink again."
"Light bodied, assertive carbonation. Not as good as I expected, but a reliable basic British ale."
"Pours a golden butterscotch with a thick, frothy head. (*Not* an inuendo.) Sweet to the smell--very rich with a little citrus. Nice hops/malts blend in the nose. Wow! Very nice beer! The sweetness is in the taste as well. This beer is much thicker than I would think. This is a damn good beer. Really. Try it."
"Lightly carbonated and easy-drinking. A bit restrained in aroma and not the most complex beer, but a nice session bitter regardless."
"Larger bottle sampled, with freshness dating notched on the rear of the label. Pours light slightly orangy amber. White head, minimal lacing. Nose is slightly musty/funky and also has hints of malt. This is a nicely balanced ale, try to get a fresh sample and enjoy its understated Britishness. Notes of caramel, bready/yeasty malt, minerally and smooth in the lingering finish. Wont do much for over hopped beer lovers (as I consider myself) but its a pleasant respite and a quaffable enjoyable brew."
"After stumbling across Young's Dirty Dicks which I liked, I picked up a bottle of this. I was disappointed. Pours a dark brown, maybe a hint of red. Not much head to speak of. The taste was overpowering, and not a good taste at that. Everyone has different tastes, so I am sure others may like this. I did not find this as something I could drink many of at a sitting, in fact I found that I had to force myself to finish it instead of grabbing something else."
"Medium brown-amber body, topped by a thick, creamy head. Aroma of bourbon malts accented by a slight fruitiness. Flavor is rather aggressive, with a strong wood component. A decent amount of bitterness and hop flavor is also present up front. The finish has a lingering earthiness. Slight amount of higher alcohols present in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, Im not thrilled with this beer."
"Another value pick-up. I consider myself a Young's appreciater and this does not leave me wanting more. Pours a light orange with a slight tinge of gold. A 2 finger head subsides to a small foam cap. Pleasant albeit weak aromas of toffee and caramel provide a sweet nose. Taste is well balanced starting off with toffee notes before fading into the slightest hop bitterness. Nice and malty this one is. Superbly drinkable and enjoyable. Will be picking this one up again."
"Nicely hopped, honey and fruity and peppermint and grapefruit. A nice mead-like dark golden colour. Went well with my crew's fish and veggie stew. Smooth and a pleasant drink, bitterness there but understated and sweetened down. Unusual and something we could have again frequently."
"Maybe not Young's best but a very nice beer."
"Decent amber color-touch of orange. Low carbonation level. No head. Slight malt aroma. Somewhat metallic. Malty enough flavor-slight hop bitterness. Really average flavor wise. Slight sweetness but the ho hum overall flavor slightly detracts from the finish. Decent body. Really just a ""plain Jane"" sort of beer. Id try some of the other Youngs products first."
"Copper color - reddish and very clear in a pint glass. Pours a deep orange with a quickly dissipating white head. Slighty hoppy aroma carrying into a caramel malt aftertaste. Overall taste is apricot and wheat. Finish is nice and bitter like it should be. Pretty straightforward with nothing exceptional about it."
"An OK bitter."
"Very good session beer! When I'm in London, I always make a trip to one of the Young's pubs, which have excellent, quite affordable food, and you can get both this and their ordinary bitter in cask. Few things are better."
"The beer upon its release from the 500ml brown bottle pours a clarion copper color with a moderate sized semi-creamy light tan head and the resultant lace a concealing sheet. Nose is sweet malt, hints of yeast, clean and fresh to the senses, start is sweet with a full malt profile, top feel light to moderate. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops pleasantly spicy and the aftertaste quite dry, a fine ESB in its own right and a style I find pleasing"
"Time to start the new year off with watching a little football and drinking some beers. This one begins my day. Pours a yellow orange color with a small fizzy head. Smell is kinda sweet and earthy. Taste begins really nice and reminds me a little of Fuller's ESB but after a few sips it really falls apart. There's a bready flavor and some earthy, spicy hops but both are overshadowed by this candy corn tasting sweetness that really gets cloying. There's seems to be some diacetyl here as well. Shit, this was good at first but now I can barely finish it! I think 12 oz would have been enough."
"Drinkability: which is the perfect segue into this characteristic. Easy enough to drink. I drank the pint in little to no time whatsoever. If you like English Pub Ale's, this is a must try. Solid offering from Young's."
"Really good beer, perfect for sitting down and putting a few away. Sweet, fruity aroma with bready malts. Carmel flavors with a sweet buttery note. Solid mouthfeel without being heavy. Carbonation was low, but enough to provide a healthy cap of white foam over the clear copper body. Great drinkability, one of the few English ales I really enjoy."
"Ideal for a session ale, and a topnotch English bitter."
"This is a very drinkable ESB given the abv and how smooth it goes down. Nothing to really seek out in terms of the style, but you won't be disappointed if you order a pint."
"This poured an orangey amber color. Huge and hefty head of tan creamy foam. Nice intricate lacing on the glass. Low amount of carbonation. The aroma is bitter, tannic and has some slightly metallic and fruity notes, along with some sharp graininess. Actually, this has the pungent aroma of old wet cardboard. Interesting. The taste is bittersweet with dry and fruity malt base. As the beer warms to room temperature it becomes increasing more flavorful. Solid malt body and a nice dryness emerges in the finish. A nicely pleasant English ale and one that I like to revisit once in awhile."
"Blood red color with highlights of orange in the glass. Poured with a small white head, and did not leave much lacing. Smells of butterscotch discs, toffee, and something lightly soapy. Taste is dry, with strong butterscotch, grassy malt, and light hops. Mouthfeel is buttery slick, moderate carbonation. A different and delicious ale."
"Doesn't taste quite as good as it smells, though. Smooth and caramel sweet upfront followed by a nice hoppy bitterness--really a nice balance between the two flavors. Fizzy carbonation but with a full body, this is a nice beer to drink at just a little bit below room temp."
"This would be a great food beer."
"Ram Rod is a quality ESB even if it doesn't overly impress. It doesn't hit you over the head with flavor, but that's all right sometimes. On occasion we all need a beer that we can settle into like an old pair of slippers and enjoy for its simple, pleasant drinkability. This is just such a beer."
"Pouring from the 500ml a transparent coppery honey, a little brown and a little red. Just what is expected, colour-wise. Brilliant and clear. The head was a healthy size, and has ample duration, churning from two-fingers down to a thin (1 cm) but creamy and complete covering of cream- coloured foam. After pouring it formed quite large bubbles on top. The lacing is screen-like, full, immediately after tilting, then it patches and runs the glass quite quickly. Definitely a better than average appearance. Perfect amount of fruit on the nose, with subtle sweet-honey smells, some dusty smells, caramel, but with subtle but well-balanced hop. The fruitiness is hard to pinpoint--subtle apple, plum, perhaps, and sweeter fruits such as peach. There are also some definite yeast characteristics revealed by the somewhat dusty earthy aromas. I immediately taste the dusty quality too on my first sip, both from the generous hop and the yeast. The finish is exceptional hop flavour--not overdone, but definitely the defining feel in the aftertaste. Three cheers for balance here: the crystal malt leaves the tongue just sweet enough to counterbalance the dryness left by the hops, whilst not supressing the full and robust hoppiness. On the middle of the tongue is the sweetness and myriad fruits, as well as some sugary butterscotch. A dryer mouthfeel, but not so dry that it inhibits further drinking, and all this combines for first-rate drinkability, for hopheads OR maltheads. This would be perfect over a good ploughman's lunch; and it goes extraordinarily well with smoked Jarlsberg cheese, I might add."
"Overall, not too bad. I feel obligated to re-review this one, making sure to find a bottle that hasn't passed its expiration date."
"500 ml bottle, served just under room temperature. Large, fish-eye bubbles compose the off-white head. Large tufts of foam cling to the side of the glass. The color on this brew is a light, dark wheat-chestnut color (woody). Relatively low carbonation. Im into the aroma, but the beer has to be warm for the smells to come out: English hops, malt, and a yeasty-breadiness. The taste is nutty, with butterscotch and caramel notes. Its not really a sweet beer, but has a malt and dough like flavor. Finish is clean and a little flowery. No complaints with this beer."
"The top of the foamy light tan colored head pocks as it fades to a thin film. Clear, liquid copper colored beer with no sign of carbonation. Aroma of crisp grassy hops and a pinch of grain. Light bodied, easy drinking beer. Mild flavored beer, fresh grasyy hops, caramel malt, smooth bitterness takes over into the finish. An easy drinking ESB, nothing else really stands out."
"D&N: My thanks again to Max at D's Six Packs for being my beer Guru, this one was purely at his recommendation, and as always, he leadeth me to good beer. Nice flavors, nice aromas, very drinkable."
"Drinkability - pretty tasty, a nice beer for the macro swillers wanting something to bridge them to better beers."
"This brew is a clear, dark gold colored drink, with a big, bubbly white head. Bitter hops and dark malts on the nose. As for the taste, it starts off with a nice delicious whack! of bitter english hops. Sweet malt, med to full mouth. All you need to know is english and ESB, and excellent brew. One you could drink till the sun come up."
"Good, no-frills ESB."
"Overall- a decent Ale that wasn't quite up to par with Young's other offerings. My bottle DID say best before end of Jan. 2004. So this could have handicapped it slightly. Regardless Young's makes awesome beers!!!"
"Brew poured to a nice clear amber color with a thin head that disappeared quickly with hardly any lacing. The smell of this brew is of hay/buttery like malt, a floral hop and a fruit sweetness that I think I am picking up. Not a bad smelling brew. It has just enough carbonation and tastes of the malt and fruit sweetness that push through nicely with a good hop bite that brings this brew together. Nice brew, not a favorite but is would be one that I could have a nice evening with!"
"A drinkable brew, but not a big beer. I like more tastes than are present here."
"The beer poured a crystal clear amber gold with a thin white head. It had a straight up smell of malt and hops, just a good beer semll. The taste was sharp and hoppy. It was light, clean, and just slightly oily. This beer had a distinct quality about it. The bitterness let you know you were experiencing a classic British Bitter. This was the first I really tried and will have to explore some more. The high amount of hops is not high on my list so I don't see me becoming a regular consumer, but definately a beer I will try again."
"Is Red Hook ESB to much for you, try this one. Atruly great beer!"
"I absolutely love this beer. I rarely order the same beer twice, especially with a selection of 30 craft beers, but I drank this all night. One pint is not nearly enough for me. Every sip is amazing, just savoring the perfect flavor. I really can't think of a flaw with this stuff, but I reserve my perfect score for the cask conditioned version."
" Finish is a long and mellow hop bitter; dry and satisfying, encouraging another. IMHO one of the best session beers available."
"Excellent Youngs beer. Pours a very nice head that slowys dissapates and laces quite well. A very clear amber color. Smell is malty and of carmel and a hint of butterscotch. Mild bitterness goes very well with malty taste. At the end of the taste is a warmimg note."
"Amber color with an orange, hazy tinge. The head was light beige and dissipated to lacing very quickly. The smell was dry and bitter with slight notes of fruit and malt sweetness. The taste was light and very dry all the way through. In the beginning there is a splash of fruitiness that quickly gives way to malt and a little hops but very, very dry. The mouthfeel was crisp and bitter and lingered on way after the glass was done. Overall this beer was very drinkable and I liked the 500ml bottle serving (cool looking bottles) --- like to try this on tap some day. I'm beginning to rediscover English brew and this one's a winner."
"Pours a nice orange amber color. Head that leaves some lace to the very end. This beer has a nose of malt, grass. Taste is mostly malty and somewhat dry on the finish. I don't know where the ""bitter"" comes from. Very drinkable."
"The beer pours a clear amber color with a 1/4"" frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is dry, bitter, malty, and fruity from the English ale yeast. The taste is slightly malty. It has a dry finish. The taste is weak and musty. This is similar to most English-style ales. The mouthfeel is good. It is a light bodied beer with good carbonation. It is a good drinking beer. Young's beers are all pretty decent. You almost can't go wrong."
"Notes: Excellent ESB."
"This is a nice representation of a special bitter, though the massive carbonation reminds me of how much I miss the myriad of cask-conditioned ales I could get in the UK. The hop character is very pronounced throughout, more so than most traditional English bitters I have come across. The overt hop presence keeps this 5.0% alcohol beer from being feeling too sweet, making it a very nice session beer."
"Pours a nice clear amber with a 1 finger thick, off-white head which diminishes rather quickly to a thin layer of medium to fine bubbles. Has a mild sweet and slightly hoppy smell. So far not a particularly impressive beer, although this begins to change a bit with the first sip, which tastes initially of sweet malt and ends nicely with a dry/bitter finish. Somewhat smooth and fairly drinkable. Nothing particularly special but a nice session beer."
"I passed this one up many times, but my wife brought a bottle home from the store. It looks nice enough: light copper with an intially foamy white head that dimishes quite quickly. The smell is on the light side. It's a bit sweet smelling and the hops are discreet. Waiting for more hop bite left me a bit disappointed. For no good reason, I tend to compare Young's beers to Fuller's and this one doesn't quite hold to good old Fuller's ESB."
"A good beer from Young's. Certainly a beer that I'd have a few more of , from one of the best breweries in England."
"Good stuff."
"Thick white head subsided quickly atop a light amber ale. Aroma of esters and swee light malt. Taste is nice and hoppy at first which moves into a sweet maltyness and it then impeded by a harsh iron water flavor. It reminds me of blood a little bit and it detracts from the enjoyment of this beer a lot. Finish is very clean with no hops in the finish. I have had many better english ales though maybe i am biased towards a liking of less authentic english ales."
"Appearance: Forms with a copper orange body and a frivilous fluffy cream tinted thicket of foam on top that begins to dwindle leaving even specks of lace as it empties. Aroma: Caramel sweetness with floral hops in the aroma very nice not in your face or anything just completely harmonizes is so nice. Taste: Upfront the creamy sweet malt profile is entwined with the hop bitterness, definitely one of the better English ales I have had in awhile blends flavors so well. Mouthfeel: Medium a little on the lighter side of the spectrum but carbonation is dead on making each sip nice as the next. Drinkability: Overall I enjoy this beer but again I wanna try these samplings on cask that would be an experience I'm sure."
"Also: This is listed as an Extra Special/Strong Bitter (ESB), which is not incorrect, but, maybe slightly misleading & may lead one to think of Fullers ESB. Ram Rod is actually more of a Pale Ale / Strong Bitter rather than an ESB."
"Comments  I thought this was well done, but off the ESB style."
"Pours to a copper-orangish color with a chill haze. It forms a tan head that quickly diminishes. The aroma is wonderful with a malty, floral fruitiness. The flavor is of English malts, caramel, with the floral hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. It is a very well balanced beer that is highly drinkable. I really enjoyed this brew."
"F"
"""Best before October 2003"""
"drinkability isn't high. too much body to really be a great session ale, but lots of flavor, nonetheless."
"Not quite so sour and bready as some other English ESBs. Very drinkable."
"Pours out browish red with a small head. Taste is slightly sour, a little metallic feel to it. Some hop bitterness, but well rounded. Body is not that complex, but it remains quite drinkable. This is a once in a while beer for me; not something that I will likely keep in the fridge."
"I enjoyed this ale. It is not one I will purchase frequently though. I do have a friend who I am going to recommend this ale to."
"Overall, not too bad for the style. Easily drinkable and pretty tasty."
"This brew has a nice aroma and when poured yields a medium white head of medium bubbles and an amber color with a slight cloudiness. It has a pleasant smooth taste with only a slight after bite. It leaves a nice lacing on the side of the glass as it goes down. All-in-all, it was a very smooth and a nice brew to sit and drink all night long."
"pours out a quite hazy deep copper colour. foamy head appears...and doesn't want to die down any time soon. fair amount of lace. oh i like the aroma....lots of fresh fruit smells coming forth from my glass...very enticing! lots of ripe fruit flavours in the taste department. quite layered and complex in the amounts of different flavours shining through. damn tasty! medium mouthfeel props up the malt load...hard to discern the bittering hops, but there is some balance to the malt sweetness. it's pretty smooth and creamy and quite the tasty and refreshing ale. certainly, this is no monster...but a perfectly crafted, balanced easy drinking ale with plenty of flavour to keep my taste buds interested. this is my idea of the perfect session brew. i could drink this all day and night."
"Very malty on the palate, where some crystal joins the Maris Otter. Lots of earthy hop here, as well as decent bitterness. Could use a touch more bitterness for my taste. Nice chalky mineral taste on the finish. An excellent bottled best bitter. Bottle condition it, and I'd be a real fan."
"A pleasant light copper hue, it has a medium sized head that dissipates a little too soon, although it does leave a ring that follows through. Nose is light all the way, light floral hops, light spices, light hay and herbs, light citrus. Perhaps mild would be a better term. Flavour is mild for a bitter as well, and very drinkable. Floral hops, grapefruit and herbage found in the taste. An impressive ale, but not exceptional, although looking back now, with the well blended mild characteristics I should have scored this higher. Just not bold enough for me to up the ante."
"This beer poured a clear deep copper. The head was off white but thinned rather quickly. While the head lasted, there was a little lace. The aroma was muted with little hops in the nose. The taste was also evenly balanced with the slight maltiness winning out. There was no hop bitterness. The beer tingled the tongue with just a litte bit of carbonation. The mouthfeel was medium light. All and all this would make an excellent session beer."
"I was hesitant about trying this ale but after a good outing with the Double Chocolate Stout, I thought I'd give it a try. Poured brown with a tightly compacted head wich laced the glass a little. Great english tasting ale and surprisingly well balanced. Good malt flavor and only a slight bitterness. Decidedly English in flavor and a good selection of an ale."
"Started with a crisp but mellow malt that led to a creamy brown sugar. There was light minerals and wood with a slight hop finish that was very pleasant. The body was medium to medium-full in texture with a smooth and creamy finish. A great beer and I can never pass up a cask-conditioned ale."
"It's been some time since I've had this one, and now that we've been reacquainted, it won't be long again."
"Cherry-tinted bronze hue, very small and underdeveloped white head, spare bubbly retention, no lace. A crisp malty nose, notes of hops, slight fruitiness a clean aroma with minimal depth, but it is still inviting. Any of the afore mentioned flaws are all forget upon the first sip oh yeah, lovely palate surprisingly sharp bitterness that slices quickly through the tongue, the gash is quickly engulfed with a lightly caramel malt and fruity hints, sweetness. Faintly earthy. Pleasant finish, the excellent balance continues, nice lingering hoppy influence. Superbly drinkable, it is easy to see why this beer is a classic. Ram Rod is a damn nice ESB, recommended."
"Had this from a 16.9oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The color was dark copper, with about 2 fingers of an off-white head. Smell is a deep nutty aroma, but not as strong as a brown ale. The taste is a sweet, nutty flavor, not very high in hops. Almost a hint of ginger in the taste. The mouthfeel is good and heavy. My favorite part of this beer is the lace! Large rings were left all the way down the side of the glass, very impressive."
"Drinkability: Quite wonderful, find a comfortable chair, a glass of Ram Rod, and a volume of Dickens and pay a visit to the 19th century."
"Everything I have sampled from this brewery and Young's in general have been superb and Ram Rod Famous Ale is no exception. I love the rich amber color and the full caramel sweet malt body. Pour 1/2 the glass at a tilt then let the last 1/2 pour straight down to create a full, lustrous head. The sweet malty aroma has hints of pears and tea. The complex hops have tea-like, citrus and some fruity esters. The velvety smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel is a pleasure. Balanced yet complex with hints and traces of banana, milk chocolate, pears, limes and cherries. This is a MUST TRY!"
"Had this at just a random Philadelphia bar. Pours with a copper color with a white head that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Aroma of Kent Golding hops. Taste is hoppy with a fair amount of astringency. The sweetness of the malts come through as well. Overall, a very solid beer and a good representation of the style."
"This beer has supremely well balanced malt and hops flavours, nothing really leaps out and grabs me particularily but if this stuff was cheaper or somewhere near me on tap I could sink this stuff like nobodys business. Many other reviewers have complained about a lack of bitterness, I really don't know enough about beer styles to comment on this but drinking it as a person inexperienced with british ales its probably the best i've had so far."
"It's fairly clear, copper in color, close to burnt orange even. Mellow is the aroma....a little malty. I enjoy the flavor lots. It's a little malty and a little more hoppy. Nothing is overpowering. I almost think of it as a reserved Fuller's ESB in way. Great beer."
"Pours a dark orange/copper color with a nice 1/2-inch white head. The froth dissipates slowly leaving a thick sticky lace. Nose has surprisingly mild hops aromas intermixed with some fruit aromas and subtle malts. The taste is mildly hoppy with light malts. The mouthfeel is well balanced and smooth. This is a very easy drinking beer, very enjoyable."
"Nice complex hoppy aroma. Amber off-white healthy head, lightly cloudy body. Astringent hoppy flavor and bitterness on a broad rich malty body. Long nice caramel/hoppy aftertaste. Broad medium rich Mouthfeel. Extremely high drinkability despite its robust aftertaste. Very smooth despite amount of hops."
"Besides supporting the enviroment with the brewery contributing a portion of the proceeds to a worthy conservation trust, it was also quite drinkable!"
"Wow! Fresh bread in the nose, anyone? Sweet, toffee, some licorice. Very British. The front is sweet caramel malt, toffee. Caramel dominates the middle, but there's definitely some fruit in there. The finish is fresh with licorice and a nice, clean hoppy bitterness (or bitter hoppiness). I really like it. Balance, complexity, a story-telling beer."
"This beer pours a clear copper color with a massive cream-colored head. The aromas of light malt, grain, and hops are a little on the faint side but still extremely pleasant. The taste is smooth malt and fades into a warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, yet has a creamy feel to it and it finishes dry. Decent brew, but not great. Definitely not up to par with Fuller's version. Cheers!"
"Best before: 11/02 Tasted: 01/26/03"
"Poured a cloudy, orange with a very thin head. The smell was transparent and hard to define. The initial taste was of slight citrus, woody and had a full flavored pale ale throughout. After several sips, a nice bitter feel. A very drinkable beer, somewhat of a classic English Pale Ale. I will look for 6 packs of this in the larger markets."
"It was a nice amber/orange color with very little foam. The smell was of a malty/hoppy aroma. The first couple of sip's brought a malty caramel flavor, but after the first couple of sip's, I couldn't taste the malty caramel or spicies. The sweet/bitter flavor was well balanced. The beer failed to turn me on after the first couple of sip's. What a let down!"
"Brew is characterized by a rich copper-reddish hue, complete with a very even, creamy complexion, mid-sized head that leaves consistent lacing along the glass. Aroma is very enjoyable but lends itself much closer to a mild ale than that of bitter. Taste too is quite mild and lacks the hoppy kick expected"
"Pours a somewhat hazy orange copper color with a creamy and sticky white head that dissipates into a nice lace. Aromas of ripe fruit with notes of malt, grains, and dried grass are present. Flavor is a mix of fresh fruit, sweet malt, and green tea with a dry, slightly buttery finish. Very nice brew and at $2.19 for a 500ml bottle, this is a good buy."
"Hazy amber with a pale 1/2 inch head that leaves some nice lacy bits after a minute.  A little sweetened orange to the rather subdued aroma, could have been sassier but this is a mild ESB at 5 % ABV...Malt dominates but hops are distinct enough to lend prickliness to the tongue and close.  Light-bodied but a nice sense of light brown sugar and a candied fruit sense mid-mouth.  Not a huge flavor statement in this one, but good balance, pouring qualitities, and taste profile.  Solid, but not spectacular, for style."
"This beer pours with a nice beige colored head over deep golden liquid, very clear too. The nose is lightly malty, with some grassy hop aroma smelled. The taste is biscuity malt, Maris Otter, the back label states. Some caramel like sweetness also, followed by mildly bitter hoppiness. Finishes on the dry side with hop bitterness lasting til the end. A very easy to drink bitter."
"Fairly clear, deep-amber body capped by a dense & creamy, very light-tan head that holds well and leaves some thin lace. The aroma is gently malty, softly fruity and lightly hoppy without being real specific about anything. The body is light with a gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor, like the aroma, offers broad strokes rather than detail with a somewhat rich malt that's only lightly caramel in character, a supple fruitiness, some woody notes and a leafy hop flavor that's backed by solidly supportive bitterness. Finishes with a short lingering composite of the above characteristics. Nicely balanced! The great thing about this beer is that it pack so much into so little - light but compelling. Highly drinkable! Best served at cellar temperature (or just below) to reveal its complete character. An excellent English session beer althought the alcohol is just slightly high at 5.0%. Recommended."
"A damn fine ale and I am very glad to find a place that has it on tap."
"A tasty and traditional bitter that would also make for a nice session beer. Nice find on tap."
"Cloudy tan color with decent head and excellent lacing.  The aroma was big on malt with slight hop undertones.  The hops came through in the flavor however, but they were well balanced by the malt.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and this is an excellent beer.  It is only slightly beat out by Fullers ESB, but a damn good beer in its own right."
"Another pretty good beer from Young's."
"Slightly spicy/herbal hops were in complete balance.  I liked this brew a lot, but for the price, a would go with a Fuller's ESB over this since I think it is a superior beer and costs about the same in my area."
"16 oz bottle...Very eye catching copper/orange color that glows in the light. Rich, puffy head that settles quickly but, hints of it last all the way down. Big bitter hop nose, that initially set me back, not pleasing at all. As the beer warmed the smell eased. Nice rich hop tastes dominated. A bit piney on the finish, not much malt noticable at all. More of a slow sipper, I definitly had it too cold, it got mucher better as it warmed in the glass. IMO, this one would be great on tap."
"What a great smooth ale,very traditional.Just so easy to drink.Youngs is a great traditional ale brewer one of the best in the world."
"Very appealing slight hazy copper hue topped by a thin but tight creamy white head. Floral, slightly earthy EKG nose accompanied by caramel malt & fruity esters from the yeast. Classic Young's nose. Ram Rod has incredibly balanced hop and malt character. Bitterness from the EKG's and the rich, nutty Maris Otter malt profile coalesce perfectly. Very smooth, soft mouthfeel, but it's not a rich beer-- VERY drinkable. It finishes with a very clean hop bitterness & slight sweetness from residual sugars not metabolized by the yeast. This is an excellent ESB. Good thing it comes in a 18.6 oz bottle. 12 oz just wouldn't cut it."
"My favorite ale with the exception of Youngs bitter cask conditioned in the U.K. very smooth and drinkable. I encourage all you fellow beer lovers out there to try this fine breweries products. I just had a very fresh bottle that I brought home from The Shrine. A beautiful deep amber / copper, nice head and great lacing. Very toasted freah malts and perfect hopping to create that Young's smoothness. A total classic!"
"Delicious. Sooo smooth. All the classic English ale characteristics."
"Notes: An really nice bitter. True to style ... we almost forgot what a real English bitter tasted like."
