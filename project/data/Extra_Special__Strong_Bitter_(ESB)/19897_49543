4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy copper body with a good amount of carbonation supporting its foamy head. Enticingly rich malty aromas of caramel and toffee hit me right off the bat, along with a subtle earthiness that's very appealing. The caramel notes are extremely prominent, and the overall impression is that of a very sweet beer. Toasty malts take a backseat to the more sugary and fruity notes. The hops are more complex on the palate than the nose would suggest, with herbaceous and faintly citrusy notes coming in, but never quite balancing out the malts. This is certainly one heck of a tasty beer, but it's lacks the balance that esbs supposedly aspire to. Overall, as long as I ignore its supposed style, I like this quite a lot. It's extremely flavorful and as pleasurable to drink on its own as with food.","droomyster","Sep 15, 2011"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"eep orange amber. A very dark color which took me a little by surprise to be honest. A very nice three inches of head formed on the top in a good light tan to off white color. Great retention had this thing hanging around for what seemed like forever. Some sediment actually poured out of the bottom and graced over the top of the foam at the end. A very hazy and cloudy brownish amber this was and it had a very full look to it. A very nice aroma of deep caramel malts was the first thing I noticed. A nice subtle hoppiness as well, though sweet. The flavor was very full, almost a hoppy scotch ale of sorts. Very big with a grainy and chewy kind of feel to it. Medium body with ample carbonation led to a great rich feel and this was just a superb drinker","mikesgroove","Sep 08, 2011"

There was some bitterness, but not enough to overwhelm the malt. Finish was likewise pleasant, slightly bitter initially, then allowing the malt a chance on the extreme finish.","woodychandler","Mar 13, 2011"

3.27,-9.4,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, some malts. Taste is dominated by hops, no malt at all, considerable bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew.","tone77","Feb 27, 2011"
3.47,-3.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, it's a fairly decent beer in terms of its sum parts, but production problems leave it sloppy and unfocused with a limited drinkability.","NeroFiddled","Feb 07, 2011"
4.82,33.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This is certainly one of my favorite session beers. It is a beautifully done recreation of this classic style. It is no more or less than a perfectly brewed extra special bitter. While it is difficult to find, State Line Liquors in Elkton Maryland almost always has it in stock.","daudette","Feb 05, 2011"
3.15,-12.7,4,4,3,2.5,2.5,"D - I love the ESB style, but this one misses the mark for me... After a strong start in terms of appearance and aroma, this one quickly drops off... Not an offering I would drink again, let alone recommend...","philbe311","Feb 03, 2011"
4.03,11.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"DRINKABILITY: The more I drank, the more I enjoyed. The thick foamy head gave it a nice old fashioned feel. After each sip from my snifter, I was able to lick away my foam mustache and enjoy another taste of this fine ale.","danriverbrew","Jan 29, 2011"
2.54,-29.6,4.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Poured a nice pumpkin orange with a big frothy white head that left spots of lacing here and there. Very clear with bubbles streaming from the apex of the glass. Very fruity with hints of lychee, pears, and white grapes. Touch of metallicness and honey. Flavor is highly fruit-forward, with the aforementioned flavors highly pronounced. Not much malt detectable except more clover honey and bitterness is clean in the finish. Dry and well carbonated. Alcohol warmth is slightly noticeable, odd for a beer less than 6% drinking like it's 8-9%.","DmanGTR","Jan 16, 2011"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"D- Very enjoyable and easy to drink. This is the second beer I have had from Evolution and I am impressed with what they are doing.","larryi86","Dec 23, 2010"

3.78,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep amber with a small off-white cap. Good clarity. Caramel, light cherries and a touch of breadiness in the nose. Light to medium body with adequate carbonation for the style. The malt stands tall throughout. A touch of biscuity sweetness, fruit and a mild bitterness in the finish. They found a nice balance of hops and malt with just the right amount of bitterness and fruity sweetness left lingering behind.","ColForbinBC","Nov 19, 2010"
4.3,19.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5," The flavor is rich with malt and has accents of toasted grain w/ light cocoa and biscuit sweetness. The hop flavor is pleasant and accents the taste of the malt with a gentle pine quality. There is a mild tinge of yeast which brings to mind orange rind and subtle apple notes w/ a dry nutty flavor following it up. I enjoy how the malt flavor becomes more pronounced as it warms w/ a mild dark sugar taste and hint of wood in the hop flavor to keep pace. There is gentle stone fruit elements faintly in the taste w/ a light coffee tinge. This is a seriously good ESB a complex well brewed ale w/ high drinkability-a taste I could enjoy many of. I wish this were brewed closer to me.","Slatetank","Oct 21, 2010"
3.98,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Exile ESB, bright orange amber, seems to be paler in color than the Fuller's version and without the exploding fruitiness that is characteristic of that London beer. The pour garnered a little bit of head that quickly fell off. The beer has a rounded earthy malt aroma that is spiked with a little red apple. The beer is bready sweet with ripe fruit that gives way to a balanced, minty, hop bitterness in the finish. The beer has a chewy mouthfeel with some contributions from tannins from the grain husk and hops.","Soonami","Sep 13, 2010"
4.35,20.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"mouthfeel matches taste perfectly with the slight carbo and creaminess making this a(nother) quite drinkable brew from the First State! easy to session in a nice pub in New Castle (i wonder if any carry this on draft?) i imagine...:)","mempath","Jul 26, 2010"

4.12,14.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The taste was an even balance between understated hops and rich toasty malt. The hops were rather delicate with floral and phenolic notes but little lasting bitterness. The mouthfeel included a little sourness and tang but was overall pleasant. Overall, pretty delicious.","dickroop","Jul 17, 2010"
3.93,8.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall, I enjoy this beer. I could see a sixer make its way into my fridge if I could find one and I'm not the type that has the patience for a sixer of the same thing.","RomaniIteDomum","Jul 09, 2010"

3.82,5.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"D= probably rather drinkable if it's what is being served or on-tap, worth the try in the bottled version.","therica","May 12, 2010"
3.78,4.7,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a beautiful amber color with a lot of carbonation and leaves a one finger white head that left behind a lot of lacing. The nose is malt upfront, with noticeable citrus and caramel with a some hops. The taste is much more hoppy than the smell, as well it has noticeable malt and caramel in the nose, but much harder to detect the citrus. Its balanced out pretty well, not overly bitter or overly sweet. Decent mouthfeel and good drinkability.","mjw2808","Apr 14, 2010"

4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours deep amberish with nice fluffy, slick looking head. Smell is malty and deep, with a firm but subtle leafy hop aroma. Flavor is bready, toasty, a little caramel, with a leafy, herbaceous, piny hop character. Nice round bitterness on the end. Slightly sprightly mouthfeel. Tasty.","Seanibus","Jan 30, 2010"
3.47,-3.9,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,"I had high hopes for this one. Decent ratings on BA, but I figure the beer lost something in the bottle. Light brown (muddy water) in the glass with a subtle head, light body and somewhat spritzy carbonation. Nothing really in the nose and a somewhat one-dimensional taste profile. Definitely drinkable, but nothing to write home about. I'll have to try it on tap.","tugdriver7","Jan 27, 2010"
3.48,-3.6,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Had this beer as part of a tasting at the brewery. The 5oz glass I tried had nice carbonation, head retention, and color. The aroma was good with malt and hops that were present, but not too strong for an English style beer. I did think that the mouthfeel and flavor were a little too malty even for an English style beer. It was on its way to having the maltiness of a bock. A little more attenuation would make it a very good ESB.","JimmyK77","Oct 13, 2009"
4.15,15,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: this was a very easy drinking beer with some bolder than normal flavors for the style. Worth giving this one a try.","Gavage","Sep 10, 2009"
4.1,13.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very Sierra Nevada like, crisply bitter with a lingering mixture of sweetness and hoppiness in the finish. Medium bodied brew that was incredibly drinkable and tasty.","Umbra","Jun 30, 2009"
4.1,13.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very nice coppery color. A nice sized, tight, off white head. Floral aroma-quite hoppy-dry hopped with Cascades? Solid malt flavor with a great bitterness against it. Pleasantly hoppy though not overly bitter. Nice balance between the 2. Trace of lingering sweetness. Good body. I find this dangerously drinkable. The whole package is quite well done. Quite refreshing too.","lackenhauser","May 02, 2009"
