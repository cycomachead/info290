"Much rich brown color with great clarity.  There's a half inch of khaki colored head with tightly packed foam.  Brussels lacing.  Aroma is of caramel scented light malt and copper tinged British hops.  The taste is a nice caramel malt flavor with just a kiss of British copper tinged hops.  The mouth is dry and a bit chalky."

"Taste of caramel, wild berries, floral hops. Very tasty and refreshing."

"Very creamy medium body and medium very finely bubbled carbonation"
""
"Overall:  I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, this is a damn near perfect English ESB, and fans of ESBs should definitely give it a try.  I’m certainly going to get some more of this!"

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Really pretty beer when it arrived. Luxurious head that left a reasonable lacing. Great copper color. Really nice balance.And at a polite 5.5% I'm in."

"Swung by local bbq and craft beer joint, bobbique, for some lunch and a pint. Served in a glass mug. Brew is transparent brown w a thin creamy almost tan head. Nose is malt forward with a really nice crystallized malt caramel thing going on in the taste. A bit toasted. Easy drinker really nice example of the style, but on the earthier side of the spectrum. I wouldn't expected less earth and more hop from alesmith."

"a fine esb, which has the odd misnomer of being called bitter, when in fact these are sweeter, grain driven beers. perhaps in my case bitter has a very different, more diabolical meaning. it was brew that started as a celebration of a big win in the stanley cup playoffs last night, guzzling the sweet copper colored liquid right from the bottle in jovial preparation for what was sure to be a winnable game 7 forthcoming. to me it was a beer that would taste awful good out of the cup itself in a few more months. however, as the aromas of burnt sugar, english toffee, and old world ale yeast moved into flavors of maple syrup, candied apples, and werthers candies, the unthinkable happened. the home team gives up two goals in the final two minutes, and lost early in overtime, a situation that had less than a 0.4% chance of occurring. as jubilation turned to head in hands curses to the powers that be, and soft goaltending, anvil esb went from a celebratory quaff to a sorrow drowning full bodied sweet beer i almost resented as much as i liked it to start. and as a playoff beard that began on game 1 of 82 way back in early october fell hair by hair into an already dirty white sink and razor burn irritation set in, the final lukewarm dregs of this beer were of little comfort. this beer, like the play of my team, was good for some 95% of its performance, but it ends up middling by the end. an all too frequent collapse not only for my team, but for this underwhelming style. the parallels are too many to name. 22 ounces never experienced to much emotion, from the summit of the greatest mount, to hopeless dejection that will span the entire summer..."

"Overall a tasty beer. Not as drinkable as other ESBs though."

"D - Insanely quaffable... A very nice ESB and another solid offering from Alesmith... There is a reason I consider them to be one of the top breweries going... Solid for the style... Solid regardless of style... Just a solid enjoyable brew... There's a lot going on here with a low 5.5% ABV... Good stuff..."
""
""
"If there's one thing I find about bitters is they usually have a good malt presence and this one while relishing some great herbal presences is really missing some malt depth. Some depth or crackery or biscuit and caramel oomph to this would really set this beer on fire."
"EXCELLENT; TREAT YOURSELF!"
""
""
"Overall - AleSmith knocked this one out of the park! In my previous review, I damned AleSmith's IPA with faint praise. This beer, however, is a wonderful interpretation of an ESB. Watch out Fuller's."

"22 oz bomber. Bottled-on date reads 6/25/2013. Drinking today, 1/17/14. More carbonation than expected for the style. Lots of lacing. Ruby-colored beer, very clear. Aroma is very biscuity, has a ""tang"" to it that I would describe as faintly metallic. Sweet and fruity in the mouth. British malts are fairly subtle, lending some caramel and slight breadiness. Lots of fruitiness from the yeast, seems to be the dominant set of flavors here. Oily texture that coats the tongue. Some slight hop bitterness on the finish but they don't show up strong in the aroma or flavor profile. I'd like it better with more malt character, less carbonation, and maybe even a little more hop bitterness. Your mileage may vary."
""

"Pours a very nice looking reddish amber, very clear and bright with off-white to straw colored head that is thick and clingy. Some subtle effervescing of bubbles. Smell is caramel, apples, black tea and yeast. I get very pronounced tea character in the taste as well with hints of lemon and some thick bready malts to finish it off. Has a character reminiscent to me a bit of a Wee Heavy. Mouthfeel was much to thick and syrupy for me and did not suit the style well. Mild carbonation and my mouth was left feeling sticky."
""
""
""
""
"o: Odd for an ESB, like a cross between an English porter and a Belgian dubbel. The smoky porter taste which dominates later is pleasant enough, but lacks the malt dominance one might expect from an ESB. Probably the issue is a combination of bottle conditioning and age on the bottle, where the remaining yeast eventually bore some unintended fruity esters. I'll try to find a fresh bottle and give this another whirl."

"The beer appeared a nice darker amber color accompanied by a small, off-white head, maybe 1 finger, which was not well retained. The beer gave off a nice, sweet toasted malt aroma that was balanced nicely with some earthy hops...very nice. If only the taste followed the aroma; the beer was much maltier than expected...I expected much more balance, but it was a nice bready malt, with hints of biscuit and toasted malt. The beer did have a really nice feel, medium body, smooth, creamy and very drinkable. Overall, I think that I need to give this one a shot again, but from this tasting, it was not bad."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with slightly below normal carbonation. There is a toasted malt and caramel aftertaste. This is a well made beer, as all Alesmith beers are, and I would buy this again. I just wish there was more complexity."
""
""
"Poured a nice deep amber with a one finger off-white head that receded to a nice ring off-white that left good lacing. Quite nice. Scents of sweet caramel malt, honey, light toasty notes and hints of grassy hops. Simple, appealing aroma. Flavor is toasty malt, a light sweet malt flavor, nutty flavors, earthy hops, moderate floral hop bitterness, slight toffee on the finish and aftertaste, also some grain husk on the aftertaste. A very good flavor, with a bit going on, but not too much that the beer is overwhelming. It remains extremely drinkable while having a pleasant flavor. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with moderate carbonation, fitting an English pub ale. Overall it's an excellent session beer, with a good aroma, flavor and drinkability and an excellent example of a classic British style."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, muddled, slightly hazed, ruby-highlighted amber coloring with a frothy, filmy, off-white head that settles into a thin surface coating. Aromas of sugary sweetness in front, with toffee and caramel notes abound, highlighted by hints of chocolate and an almost egg nog like character. Very rich and sweet. Flavors of roast forward, with a strong nutty character blending with a rich milk chocolate profile. Very interesting, very sweet and bitter, balanced, and a touch earthy. An overall roasted character prevails, with a bitter build towards the end of the palate, combining with a tangy caramel highlight. The body is thin, but robust and supportive of all the flavors. Aftertaste of tangy sweet and bitter, with a more toffee feel to it. Thin, slightly cloying and lingering finish, with a touch of dry at the end. Pretty solid brew, with very robust and bold flavors."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid English style Bitter. Good biscuity caramel malt taste with a solid American hop balance."
"Bottle from trade. Thanks brutha! Bottle date is rubbed and cant really see it. Pours a deep dark red amber with big frothy off white head. Aroma of lots sweet malts, fruit, some dry yeast, and a bit of earthy hops. Flavor is a big biscuity malt profile with slight bitter. A nice molasses presence but not sweet. Lingering maltiness on the aftertaste. Slightly resiny but overall light medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Pretty easy drinking brew that finishes clean. Not overly exciting but nicely executed."
""
""
"Anvil is an effortless ale that's well suited for near sessionable quality, but is sturdy enough for that decadent plate of bangers & mash."
""
"O - Anvil ESB is an interesting take on the style from AleSmith, incorporating a complex English malt profile with subtle but clearly American hops. Nice and drinkable, Anvil ESB finishes smooth!"
""
""
""
""
""
"An instant favorite, this beer keeps all it's qualities in balance so that none boast of themselves above the others. It's big hearted and natural with a mild flavor that makes it easy to drink all day."
""
""
""
"D= Super drinkable and well made ale. While this is really drinkable and tasty, it is not particularly ""Englishy"" in character. I am guessing this wasn't made with an English yeast strain and the toasty character is a bit much. That being said though, this is highly drinkable and enjoyable."

"O: a fantastic beer that perfectly illustrates the style. I recently had a homebrew from a friend that was close to this, so I was looking for a sessionable beer that fit that mold. Very easy drinking beer. Def check it out."
""
""
""
"I've been avoiding reviewing this beer for years and tonight I figured let's give it a shot. I guess the fact that AleSmith is finally putting a date on the bottle is why I was willing to pick it up. I could trust it wasn't like 2 years old or something like that. In the end I wasn't too impressed. The vegetal notes are a bit off-putting, and overall it's just not well rounded enough to score highly. Considering this is $5 a bomber I would much rather get a sixer of GI Honker's or something like that. Worth a try..."

"O- The nice clean easy drinking session beer has a good hop profile and a nice fresh dry malt character to boot. Even though it was a large bottle it didn’t last long."
""
""
"O - a malt forward, bready beer with a mild bitterness. It lacks the English funky yeast, but it is a good American interpretation of the style."
"A well done ESB. Enjoyable, though fairly standard flavor profile for the style."
""
""
"22oz bomber, pours a deep amber as the bottle describes, topped with a tall frothy ivory head that holds excellent retention. Aromas are sweet and a little earthy/musty with toasted grain, caramel, very faint grassy citric hop in the background. Tastes are full of sweet toasted grain, caramel, toffee, oats, and very well balanced with a pleasant earthy hop profile. Creamy medium body is complemented with perfect carbonation. Overall, excellent representation of the style! I'm super excited that Alesmith is now available ~30mins from home! Last time I had one from this brewery, I ordered it online (their IPA)."

"Crisp, clean, very drinkable. It is watery refreshing up front with a bitter bite in the back that leaves your mouth tingling for more. As it warms some toffee sweet malt notes come out to give a little balance to the bitter dominance. The pine, lemon, and bitter herb hit simultaneously with one punch. A very interesting beer, fun to drink. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy."

"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This beer is wonderful, all round rich complex flavor that are well developed. I really wish I had more of these beer in my fridge, because I could see me drinking more of this on a regular bases."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating, purchased recently. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, pine, toast, raisin, caramel, molasses, floral, grass, biscuit, light nuttiness, and herbal. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of grapefruit, caramel, toast, orange, bread, light nuttiness, grass, tea, floral, toffee, and herbal. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, grass, tea, caramel, toast, nuttiness, floral, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice flavor balance with good complexity; nice bitterness/sweetness balance; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an damn nice ESB. Well balanced flavors with good complexity; extremely smooth to drink. No complaints at all, a very enjoyable offering as expected."
""
""
"O: Solid stuff. Doesn't blow me away - there is something odd about the nose and it's not exactly balanced like I think an ESB should be - but it's good."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with a white-tan head. Had dissipates relatively quickly. Nutty, carrot cake, chocolate, and coffee aromas emerge. Mouthfeel is smooth, wet, and light- to medium-bodied. Green vegetables, yams, and faint horehound flavors. Finishes a little bitter and sour. Very interesting."
""
""
"I'm so glad I ordered 3 AleSmith beers from LetsPour. This is just outstanding."
""
""
"C"
"I haven't had an ESB in a while so this is a treat to behold. No-frills, easy drinking. Not too high in ABV either."
"The flavor mimics the taste incredibly well with big emphases on toasted almonds and cashews. Smooth and surprising light, with a medium carbonation level, this beer is easy to drink, refreshing, and completely satisfying."
""
"This is a pretty good ale, better its counterfactual as a lager."
"Overall: I had high hopes for this beer. Its quality doesn't disappoint at all, but I'm really not a fan of this really biscuity malt bill."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid ESB. Fullers and Hobglobin I have had a lot, but happy to add this one to the mix."
""
""
""
""
"Overal, an enjoyable if not exception ESB. There's a decent chance I'll buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- A nice ESB, very tasty and extremely drinkable."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark copper with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some earthy and herbal hop aromas. Taste is of toasted malt and some nice earthy, herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O: This beer seems more flavorful and fuller-bodied compared to other ESBs but it is still very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied brew. Low ABV I assume."
""
""
""
"Anvil Ale ESB is a really nice release from Alesmith Brewing Company. It really is a tasty representation of the style. If it has any shortcomings, the nose could use a little more strength. That’s about it. It’s impressive otherwise. Definitely worth checking out."
"DOA"
""
""
""
"While the aroma and taste are not overwhelmingly exciting, this beer is absurdly quaffable, especially for the style. I was not necessarily planning on drinking this bomber in one sitting, but it's definitely going to happen."
""
"Mouthfeel is great- medium body with moderate carbonation. This is an exceptionally crafted beer and great complexity of flavor for such a drinkable, low ABV beer. Buy it if you see it!"
""
"Overall not bad, better than I expected, I kinda put this one off for a little while as I was afraid it would have that herbal U.K. like hop that I don't like in most ESBs. Decent grainy malts, nice grassy hops, a bit floral, earthy, and tasty, without too much bitterness or sweetness."
"Overall: Nice, complex, and malty ESB. I scored this according to style and this is probably my favorite in the style. If nothing else it is my favorite bottle from AleSmith in this bottle size. I will get this again. If not marking to style, this would probably be about a 3.8."
""
""
"Overall is very good. Quaffable and tasty. Another solid brew from Alesmith."
"""Yep. That's a bitter."" That's what struck my mind at the very start with this beer. And it's a pretty good one at that. Decent citrus and woody/leafy tones. I'll say that it seems mildly clogged and almost too thick on the body, but the whole thing does work. Can't really say it isn't worth trying. Naturally, I'd be interested to try this on cask."
""
""
""
""
"Since visiting the Alesmith brewery back in summer of '11, I am hooked to this brewery. Every beer is amazing."
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, a little chewy and sticky on the tongue. A pretty drinkable, tasty beer, although I probably wouldn't have this too often."
"Overall: A solid take on the style to say the least. The fact that it's American brewed is even better. Enough flavor to keep it interesting over the course of the 22, but it's never tedious. Drinks like a champ and then some."
"Here is an ESB with a touch of Porter. Lots cocoa and spicy hop bitterness. The body is as one should expect for the style."
"O: Nice ESB, perhaps the best one I've had. Nutty and toasty like a brown, hoppy like an EPA, all while coming in at only 5.5%."
""
""
""
"This is pretty enjoyable. I like the great malty flavor."
"The body is light with somewhat prickly carbonation. Overall a pretty tasty one. Real enjoyable."
""
""
"O/D-Anything I have tried by Alesmith is a blast for me. Speedway Stout and their IPA are among the peaks of their respective styles in my opinion. This is an exceptional ESB. And $6 for a bomber is not a ludicrous price either. Success."
""
"O- a very tasty very drinkable brew, I really enjoyed this."
""
"Overall: Really tasty example of a style I used to drink a lot of but barely consider these days in the world of hyper-hopping. A nice change of pace, really well made, as, it seems, is everything Alesmith does."
""
""
"Overall, nice ESB, but too carbonated in the bottle, which threw things off a bit and added unnecessary carbonic prickliness and bite. Another bottle properly conditioned could change my mind. Enjoyable ESB nonetheless."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into tulip glass. Pours bcopper color, sparkling clarity, and good foam retention throughout. Deep toasty/caramelly malt balanced by spicy/fruity hop flavors accented by fruit esters resulting. The aroma is subtle and reflects the flavor with malt, hop and fruit (ester)/fermentation characteristics. Smooth, medium-bodied. There were some harsh or astringent sensations with the finish. But, again, this is an ESB. With respect to one of my favorite breweries, this is not my choice of beer."
""
"Pours a moderate brown-amber color with a good off-white head and a nice bit of lacing on the way down. Collar throughout. The nose brings some light floral and earthy hops. A bit of bready malt. Flavor has a nice bitterness mixed with light hop flavor and bready malt through the background. Really excellent balance. Light-medium body and a semi-dry finish. Really nicely done ESB."
""
""
""
"Pretty good, and still able to be purchased for $5-6 a 22oz, decent."
"Everyday is the day that I want this beer. Sweet Wheaties upon sniffing, and do I smell a hop? I do! Lovely that the hop pushes through. Super bubbles, bottle-conditioned. A bit estery but, ""It feels right, Brian. It feels right."" Bitterness is the perfect counterpoint to the sweetness. Everyday I want this. Every-freakin-day."

"Tastes like a very dilute amber ale. I get too much of the dishwater taste for this to be enjoyable."
"O: Middle of the road bitter that doesn't have enough malt or balance for my taste. Too bitter and dry for me. Also lacks depth."
"Overall I enjoyed the doughy, fruitiness this beer offered. Really solid ESB in my opinion but more of a heavy Americanized version than a crisp bitter traditional English version. Good but not monumental. Worth a go if you stumble across it but my favorite domestic ESB is still the Tallgrass version."
"A good beer overall, and one I could keep going back to over an evening."
"A good ESB but far from AleSmith’s best offering. Dark amber color with a nice off-white head. Aroma is floral hops and sweet malt. Flavor is well-balanced but not incredibly interesting. Caramel malt and a sour/bitter finish with some citrusy hops. Smooth palate, medium body."
"O: Like most Alesmith beers, really solid stuff. I could have used a little less sweetness, but the beer was still enjoyable."
"From notes 2/10/09. Good except for a sweet, medicinal off note. Caramel malt dominates the flavor. Hops are evident and chime in with floral-metallic-earthy aromas and flavors. More refined and British than any other San Diego area beer that I’ve tried. The bitterness is excellent, but the medicinal note just makes it difficult for me to enjoy the beer fully. I might try to grab a second bottle to see if I got an off example. Pours a deep reddish brown with a decent white head. Feel is smooth and fairly round."
"T: Pretty interesting. Very mellow but good. The taste starts with some hop bitterness, but before the bitterness can peak, some malts come in with some toffee and rye bread. The carbonation is really interesting. I wouldn't call it prickly, more like tingly. The mouthfeel was light but amazing."
"Anvil ESB certainly drops a ton of flavour considering it's a beer designed with quaffability in mind. Indeed, rather than rush through it, I actually took my time with the bottle and savored each and every one of the 22 ounces, growing more and more enamored with it as the glass emptied. Although more bitter than most, it is still as pleasant a beer than any other."
"O: Overall, not at all what I expected of this beer, though I have only had a couple of other ESB's so perhaps this is what they should be like? Definitely unique, but a little too astringent and fruity for me and not something I would seek out (acidic beverages don't sit well in my stomach). Perhaps I'm just not in the mood for this one."
"Moouthfeel: Relatively thin, but intense hops require a break for air between sips."
"O - Very good...not especially exciting, but very solid, rich and creamy. Very easy to have a few of these in a session."
"Yields about a finger of deep tan foam, high percentage of larger bubbles results in a swift dissipation to scattered islands across the surface, the lacing too slick and crystalline to cling to the glass walls. Deep bronzed color reddish-brown until a bright orange develops at the glass bottom, trim with a mild translucent blurring, rivulets of tiny active bubbles along the insides. The nose barely betrays any bitterness, a novice would be confused by the category name, all softer malts and caramel, butterscotch, heavy cream, milk chocolate, buttermilk biscuits and nuts, nearer to room temperature you get peat and earth accents and a lifting florality. Medium-bodied, the carbonation works hard to prevent things from congealing and, for the most part, succeeds. That said, it is not a thirst quenching, refreshing quaff. The sweetness of the caramel, chocolate, butterscotch joined here by fig, raisin, cherry, apricot fruit flavors. The nuttiness likewise has more of a candied than roasted nature. The floral notes swell in the middle then segue into mineral water, earth, grass. Still, no sense waiting on any bitterness as it’s not really coming. As a quality beer it’s tasty enough, does wear you down some through the second pint. Not sure it’s a “classic” ESB."
"I love when an American brewer nails a foreign style, and this is just what Alesmith did. A perfect example of an ESB."
"D/O: Fresh Anvil is not extreme, but it is a real treat because it is a relatively rare style of pale ale that is done well and even bottled. There is no attempt to adapt or spin it into being some bastardized California-version of the style; this is a dark and traditional rendition, featuring the best that the English ingredients have to offer. Careful craftsmanship is also evident in the general cleanliness of the sensory profile, particularly the lack of diacetyl and also little in the way of esters. It strikes a favorable balance often missed by the finest of American ales, being a natural compliment to a wide variety of foods (yet still hoppy enough to keep things interesting.) I only review it now because I am tired of waiting and hoping to encounter it on cask."
"Another brewery ive never tried before anyway with a very gentle pour it pours a cherry red,light mahogany hue with average carbonation that doesnt really leave a head at all its more one frothy island right in the middle and no lacing,the smell is very sweet with hints of cherry,caramel,light toffee and medicinal hops,it has a light-medium bodied nicely carbonated mouthfeel but in my mind lacks a little backbone and has tastes of dark cherries,caramel fudge,sticky toffee,light liquorice and finishes with a medicinal,herbal hoppy bitterness and overall its a nice enterpretation of an english ESB but to be honest i was expecting just abit more from this brew cheers."
"I admittedly don't have much experience with this style. The restrained flavors are a nice change to the over-hopped west coast beers I'm used to. The minerality gives this a unique twist. Not great, but doesn't disappoint."
"Overall an easy drinking ESB that is well made, but not something I would go for that often."
"I would love to see a bit more hoppiness to balance out the nice malt character."
"D- Overall, AleSmith Anvil ESB is a solid beer that is worth a shot. Recommended."
"Overall - A very good ESB that was highly drinkable. The mouth feel was lacking something; I couldn't my finger on it. But it was still an above average beer. If you're a fan of ESB's, seek this one out."
"Simple, direct, tasty, ridiculously easy to drink, pretty sure I could put this entire bomber down in under ten minutes. Very good beer."
"D: Good beer if was served around here I would drink."
"Honestly, I could session this beer all day. Smooth and easy drinking, with just enough complexity to keep your interest."
"Overall: Not really a fan of this style so not one I regularly drink, but I did like the all English version of this they did."
"D - At this abv and no palate killers in the mix, a very easy to drink brew."
"D: An easy drinking, quaffable beer."
"3.5 D: A while ago I made the mistake of comparing every bitter to East End's Bitter End (the 2nd running of Gratitude) and so very few have been able to meet the complexity and straight up great taste. This is no different. Anvil is a pedestrian attempt at a pedestrian style."
"d - A pretty good ESB, but not my favorite. Had some nice caramel and bready malts in the smell and taste and a nice smooth mouthfeel. Would try again."
"Alesmith is one of my favorite breweries by far and Im glad to get around to rate some of their beers!"
"Can barely put a pint of this down. Not very exciting."
"Grabbed a bomber from BevMo in West Hollywood for $4 or $5. The beer looks slightly hazy and amber-red with a tall head and lacing. Honestly, I can't get much aroma from this most of the time, but as it warms I get hints of pine, sweet cherries and toast. The flavor is a little more robust. There's a bready caramel malt backbone with drier toffee notes on top and mild, spicy hop finish. This is a great session beer. Unlike most American red or American-made ESBs, the body is light while it still packs a flavorful punch."
"M & D - Very crisp and refreshing and smooth. Nice light body that is easy to drink and delicious as well. A great drinkable brew."
"Overall, more hop-centric than I expected, and as a result, nothing special."
"D- This may be authentic, but it is not very memorable. A good beer and it drinks decently well for the style."
"I have been wanting to try this for going on three or four years now,after having it I feel maybe a little underwhelmed.Poured into a imperial nonic a slight hazed copper/bronze with a creamy-like light tan colored one finger head that left broken rings of lace as it settled into a creamy mass.Aromas are the best trait of the beer,the sweet caramel really burst out at ya,juicy fruitiness,and leafy hop provide the other elements.Seemed just a tad watery in the mouth,not earth shattering but it wasnt quite as rich as some others of the style in my opinion.Nice flavors but it seemed to miss a punch in the finish,starts out fruity and deeply caramelly,a pretty good shot of leafy hop rides thru the finish,the water gives that certain sulpheric element that Iam not overly fond of.Its a good ESB, but there are better American versions,I like a big bready malt character to mine."
"D - Overall this is an enjoyable beer it has a good taste making it easy to drink I could drink a few of these in a sitting worth trying sometime"
"A supremely drinkable beer that keeps you guessing. An IPA without the heavy oils? An herbal stout? A cooling, anti-Belgian? This is a super piece of work under the radar. Looking forward to more from the brewers and of this style."
"Drinkability: While I generally like the ESB style, I am not a fan of the Burton beers and I am afraid this one reminds me too much of its antecedents; well-crafted, just not to my taste"
"D: Flavorful enough to need only one, yet it was very easy to drink. Overall, it was a quite delicious beer. Since it's relatively local, I would certainly have it again to support the Southern California brewers."
"Chewy full malty body with a prominent caramel malt presence that is slightly roasty as well as some toffee, rye and milk chocolate character. It's also pretty hop forward with a strong citrus peel presence and some earthy pine notes. This is quickly countered by the prominent malt profile but it lingers throughout into a sweet and slightly bitter dry finish. Pretty well balanced with a slightly more prominent hop profile. Kind of like a roided up American version of an English ESB."
"22oz bottle. Clear red/brown with a medium, rocky off-white head that laces a little. The aroma hit me as a little off a first, with a definite lemon iced tea character. I think its was the yeast. Kinda cool, but strange. The flavor had a little of the same, with subtle hops that balanced it out nicely. Some grape tartness too. medium body with ample but soft carbonation. An odd ESB, but very drinkable and interesting at the same time. I'll definitely get another the next time I'm down in SD."
"Overall, a very good ESB that I recommend if you like the style or are looking to try one in it. For me, it's good but not something I'd seek out that often. Rotation - not avail in TX so had shipped. Would try again during the brewery tour but no more bottles or tap at bar."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Dogfish shaped pint glass. Pours a dark brown slightly red color with a huge off-white head. Very nice head retention and excellent lacing. Aroma is a nice mix of the sweet malts and the English hops. Taste is nicely balanced with the bitterness of the hops and sweetness of the malt. There is some nice roastedness and chocolate flavore to the malt to the malts as well. I'm also getting some slight fruit characteristics, maybe some apple. Enjoyable beer from Alesmith as usual."
"Thank you, Alesmith!"
"However, drink this warmer, cellar temperature preferably. It is an ESB and like most good ESB loses much of its character when colder than that."
"D- Another good showing from Alesmith. ESB is not my cup of tea generaly but this is a good daily drinker."
"Drinkability: A decent, but not great ESB."
"22 oz. Amber pour, fluffy white head. Spicy citrus nose, some malt. Surprisingly creamy mouth feel. Citrus with some malt and caramel apple. A little acidic. Pretty clean finish with some hop bite. Drinkable, overall not bad for the style. Would have liked a little more maltiness and tea/tobacco. Worth trying, unique bottle art also."
"Drinkability: Quality and flavorful ESB. Something I'd easily go back to. I want AleSmith, since I'm not sure how to gauge them yet."
"Mouthfeel is light. Weirdness of the taste (to me) detracts from its drinkability. Maybe a few of these spread out over a couple weeks would help acquire a taste for it, but I don't have that taste yet."
"Bottle from Monument Liquors in Concord, purchased today. Pours a ruby red with a tall (3-4 inch) puffy light brown head. Sticky lacing. A couple of yeast cake chunks floating around but otherwise gleaming and spotless. Smells of malt, bread and green grass. Flavor is richly malty with a lemony, zesty tang to it. Some nice bitterness complements the graham cracker malt. I get a hint of peat in there too. Medium bodied. Lots of flavor...an ESB for maltheads."
"This is a very good ESB to my mind - an English style the English would be proud of, if they'd brewed it. I think it's particularly good that the rowdy extreme-beer culture of American craft brewing takes a deep breath now and again and brews something like this."
"Quality ESB from Alesmith, that while it took a bit to warm up, this offered some solid flavors and stayed easy drinking. Nice."
"Thanks go out to jgap for sending this one to PA and to psycohops for sharing this bomber with me. We still had a good amount of sharp cheddar left after we finished a barley wine, so we figured we'd see how it fared up against an ESB. Poured into an Adnams Imperial pint glass, the bitter appears a hazed golden copper color with at least three full fingers of fluffy, cloud - like off white foam. Nose is really heavy on the stone fruit notes - peaches, nectarines, and apricots. Tastes of peaches, light malt, grassy bitter hops. Light bodied, yet rather highly carbonated."
"Pours a clear coppery amber color with nice foamy off-white head. Good retention and some decent lacing. Smells of caramel, brown sugar, buttered bread, grain, grass, and spicy hops. Tastes of earth, toasted grain, caramel, a touch of spice, orange zest, and grass. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth, earthy and malty sweet with a nice bitter finish. Easy to drink, definitely gets better as it warms."
"Need to try another one, hopefully it will not be so high carbonated."
"Mouthfeel is sticky, soft and prickley, near perfect."
"Drinkability is good, a tasty beer if you like sweet English style ales. I do, and haven't had a sweet brown ale in a while, they're just not to common here, but I really dig this one. Luckily for this American glutton, the ABV doesn't reflect their goofy tax system - or wait, they make weak beer for the nuance, yea right! Still, there's no reason to but this in an overpriced bomber, a 6 pack beer if I ever saw one...so minus .5 for value."
"D/O: A perfect blend of caramel malt and herbal hops. The balance and back-and-forth of flavors are what kept me coming back. A highly quaffable beer that gets better as it warms. I'd love to try this cask-conditioned. The rollicking pour did hurt the overall score here. Nice to see an even, balanced beer from a brewery known for it's more over-the-top offerings."
"Overall another solid offering from Alesmith. Only had two of their beers so far, but I'm extremely impressed. Would definitely have again"
"Pours clear dark amber with a one finger off white head. Fair amount of lacings. Aroma is fruity almost perfume like. Fruity taste with very mild amount of hop bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel perhaps a bit under carbonated. Since there is no date on this bottle that I can decipher and given the good reviews that most Alesmith products recieve, I can only assume this is an old bottle. Overall fairly sweet, fruity, and just a touch of hops."
"Great beer, I enjoyed this."
"The smell was that unique esb smell with an American hop profile. The taste was well balanced between the malt and hops. It was juicy in the mouth and had a good hop aroma on the finish. Well crafted brew."
"What I came home to is an extremely well balanced, refreshing beer. I've been drinking an awful lot of IPA lately and the break from the extreme hops was lovely. And yet the beer is bold flavorful. Memorable to me as a beer that could define what it is to be an ESB."
"I could drink this beer very very regularly. Its a perfect balance of the flavors that make beer great. Maybe it's been having so many IPA's, Russian Imperial Stouts, and a few smoked porters that really feature individual aspects of the beer. And it was incredibly refreshing to have an incredibly well rounded, flavorful, full bodied ale, that I picked for primarily for being a Southern California brewer that I had not tried before. I will definitely buy AleSmith the next time I see it for sale."
"Not my favorite style, but a tasty brew I'd gladly have again."
"Extremely easy to drink, great mouthfeel, a great offering by Alesmith."
"M/D - nicely done brew, evenly mixed hops and malts to make a well balanced esb. Mine left way too much foam and took several pours just to fill a glass."
"What a left field beer! Quite out of the ordinary, I really enjoyed it for being so weird, but probably wouldn't seek it out again."
"An enjoyable glass o' brew"
"Another solid beer from Anvil. To me it isn't quite as impressive as its IPA brothers, but still one that I'd buy again."
"Taste follows the nose. Touch of fruit and with a nice malt finish. Firm carbonation and a good malt balance yield a solid medium feel to the brew, yet it doesn't have the slick syrupy finish that often deters me from the style. Perhaps there is hope for me and the style after a few Redhook ESB's sent me running for a glucose meter in the past. Quite drinkable and another fine brew from Alesmith."
"Pours a darker copper with a frothy cream-colored head. Aroma of malts and yeast. Taste is a lighter ESB, with a pleasant bitterness. Stong malt and yeast make for a crisp bite with an easy aftertaste. Doubles as a great marinade for streaks and brats."
"D - hell yeah."
"A nice, hoppy American ESB."
"This is a standout brew."
"All around a very good beer. Not quite knocking my socks off, but I'm certainly happy to have tried it."
"Notes from 3/26/05"
"Drinkability is fairly high. This is a tasty ESB and certain sessionable as well as enjoyable."
"This poured a copper-brown with a fat tan head and very rich lacing. The mouthfeel is very rich and slick, and it goes down very smoothly. Nose is of malts and some pine hops. Very well balanced brew. Flavor is not complex but enjoyable. The most remarkable thing about thie beer is how drinkable it is. It gets even better as it warms up. Don't drink this one too cold."
"Pours a light reddish brown body. Small light tannish head, quickly diminishing. Hoppy aroma, somewhat piney, somewhat maty, but not too strong. Malty, piney, acrid taste. Almost dusty taste. Maybe some banana. Watery & drinkable. MaltIness. More hops as it warms up. Too malty for my taste, but very drinkable."
"Dark copper brown in color, one finger head. Good retention and lacing on the glass. Light aroma of hops, but nothing is standing out and in your face. On my second pour from the bottle, first time down had the bittering hops, either they killed my palette of I needed to drink so water, not getting them anymore. Really smooth beer, medium carbonation, easy to drink without over complicating it. A good esb."
"Pours a hazy dark chestnut with an orange tinge and a nice tightly beaded head that fades to a thin cap. Nice gentle aroma of biscuity malt, soft minerality, and light citrus flavors. The taste is similar and pretty soft. There is also a bit of slightly grainy sourness on the end. Mellow and correctly carbonated, this is decent for the style, but not anything special."
"Pours clear amber with a hint of red with a small off-white head that dissipates quickly to a ring with little lacing. The smell has citrus hops up front with a bready malt background and some fruity sweetness in there as well. The taste really caught me off guard with an immediate tongue-tingling bitterness that actually has a noticeable lemon tartness to it. There is a strong spiciness toward the finish as well with only a hint of the bread behiind the massive bitter kick. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a strong carbonation that accentuates the tartness. The drinkability is limited a little by the bitterness, but this is a decent bitter and a very unique offering from AleSmith."
"Nice full flavor with some bready malts and a decent bite on the finish. Good session beer."
"D- Overall, AleSmith Anvil ESB is a solid beer that is worth a shot. Recommended."
"I love ESB's and I love Alesmith so I figured the Anvil ESB would be amazing. I was sort of let down I guess. Poured from a 22oz into an imperial pint glass. the bitterness was well hidden and I really never found it. Most domestic ESB's rival their English counterparts. This was very light, in flavor, and in body. No real hop presence for me, very little malt. Overall, I was not impressed really."
"Cask at Ritual in SD, fantastic brew out of Cask. Was at the brewery picking up some 08 Summer Yules and learned a bit more on how they prepare a beer for cask conditioning, thanks for that info Alesmith! Must like the bottle but better texture, head was solid and a bit tan. Very very easy to drink."
"There are many good ESBs out there and unfortunately this outstanding brewery doesn't make one of them."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, scant layer of swirly small bubbles over the slightly cloudy reddish amber brew. What head there is remains, with sticky, lasting lace. Aroma is grain husks, which flow right into the flavor, with the maltiness being balanced in the middle by a sedate hopping. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and drinkability is very easy. Another nice offering from Alesmith."
"D: very drinkable. And a solid effort at a real ESB from a non-british brewery. As with most beer it goes better with food. Happy drinking!"
"I will say that I bought 2 bottles of this and the first bottle was not sealed correctly and had gone flat, but the flavor was fine. I've noticed other reviews talking of off flavors, etc. Alesmith may need to work on some quality control."
"The taste(of the actual beer) is a lot like what I tasted in the foam. Surprise. Citrus that goes from tart to just plain sour and I'm not getting a whole lot of malt here at all. Hey I love sour ales but in a brew that's supposed to be an ESB? I don't think so. Perhaps this is a bad bottle. Yeah, that must be it as I couldn't fathom this being what the brewer intended. Not being locally available, a revisit may be a long time coming...I'm pouring the rest down the drain."
"This beauty pours a huge head that laces all the way down the glass. The nose had a large fresh caramel apple scent mixed with a floral hoppy note. The taste: Starts with silky caramel that fades into a fresh apple rhine mixed with a spicy hop accent. The mouthfeel is med. body that leaves a long finish on the tongue. The drinkabillity is great low alcohol with a smooth malt driiven finish that leaves you thirstin for more. I can see why this brew is there flagship beer. There IPA has more complexety but for a ESB this a world class winner!"
"Bubbles look heavy in this, but carbonation is pretty balanced on the palate. Nice finish, no aftertaste. I'll take another."
"Lots of bubbly carbonation, tingly on the tongue. This a very drinkable brew."
"D: this one is really easy to drink. it was gone before i knew it. i'll definitely look forward to trying it again."
"Rich amber to maroon color with a light beige head. Smell was sweet caramel malt, BIG floral notes, fruitiness, hibiscus, and tea like flavors. Almost no noticeable bitterness, and flavors of hibiscus, tea, and some mild light malt. Interesting mouthfeel and flavor, and a great ESB overall. I like this, and it's very unique."
"I love this beer."
"Another fine AleSmith brew. Would love to have more of these - perfect session beer if only a little bland. Very Americanized version."
"I was expecting big things from this one. I have never had any Alesmith products and I have heard/read great things. ESB is one of my favorite style so I was a little disappointed with this one. Glad I tried it but I wont have it again."
"Served in a dimpled Pilsner glass, cause that is the only thing I had around at the time. Aroma is bready malts and lemonny hops. Some cinnamon too. Color is a slightly hazy light amber-brown. Lacing was excellent; the glass was a history of every sip taken. Inital flavor is a touch salty and then lightly sour at the finish. After taste is a bit prunny. Light to medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Mighty refreshing!"
"M/D: Very easy on the palate, medium to light bodied, carbonation serves to present a creamy texture. Good drinkability, really nothing to complain about. Another winner from AleSmith."
"Pours a hazy, amber color with yeast sediment floating around. Anvil has a big tan head with lots of little bubbles and effervescence. The head shrinks to a substantial covering on the surface. A nice lacing down the glass is present as the head stays on top of the beer all the way to the bottom. The smell is sweet with a pleasant yeasty sourness. Notes of caramel and roasted malts are present too. A nice hop aroma is there as well. The taste is sweet with a slight bitterness that balances well. A fruity taste is apparent with cherries being the one that comes to mind. This medium bodied beer fills the mouth and tickles the tongue with mini bubbles and a perfect carbonation level. Roasted flavors on the back of the tongue give Anvil a pleasant smokey/bitter aftertaste. This is one I'll be drinking again."
"Drinks okay, I like my ESBs maltier, this one is just okay-good. I'm shocked, Ale Smith has made at least one beer that I'm not crazy about!"
"Medium body, with soft carbonation. Very nice. I could drink this all day."
"Spicey herbal tea flavors really stand out and is quite enjoyable. A lightly sweetened bready malt rounds out the middle and finishes with a persistent bitterness that accents and balances nearly perfectly. Some fruity aspects come thru on the finish as well. Refreshing carbonated mouthfeel and highly sessionable."
"What a great thing to be trying a new Alesmith brew! This one poured a very vigorous deep orange amber. A very dark color which took me a little by surprise to be honest. A very nice three inches of head formed on the top in a good light tan to off white color. Great retention had this thing hanging around for what seemed like forever. Some sediment actually poured out of the bottom and graced over the top of the foam at the end. A very hazy and cloudy brownish amber this was and it had a very full look to it. A very nice aroma of deep caramel malts was the first thing I noticed. A nice subtle hoppiness as well, though sweet. The flavor was very full, almost a hoppy scotch ale of sorts. Very big with a grainy and chewy kind of feel to it. Medium body with ample carbonation led to a great rich feel and this was just a superb drinker. Overall I really liked this one. Much more full bodied then some of the ESBs I have had in the past, this one really had a body on it and was very filling. Great hoppy finish and a very well rounded feel. A great ESB and a great addition to the Alesmith lineup, this one was definitely a keeper."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a forced 1½ inch head comprised of tiny bubbles. It reduces quickly leaving behind a solid coat of lacing. The aroma is very nice. The malts waft out and present themselves in the form of molasses, vanilla, wood and earth. The hops bring floral and fruity notes to the table. I can also smell the yeast. The taste isn't very bitter at all. Quite balanced, but probably leaning more on the malt. In addition to the characteristics previously mentioned, there is also a sweetness resembling orange honey. The mouthfeel is very soft with very little carbonation bite. Overall, this is a solid beer that I'm glad to have tried."
"Could not drink too many of these, pretty heavy and sweet, not a session beer for sure"
"Drinkability is good. A nice ESB, worth a try, and would be a nice sessionable beer. Six packs please?"
"D: A good English-style Bitter, I enjoyed this experience thouroughly, it's nice to see a West Coast brewery not make a giant monster ale every time, and instead concentrate on the subtle, fragrant wonders and complexities of a sessionable style like English Bitter, though I do like those big monster ales."
"Good beer, but not up to what I expect from Alesmith."
"Beautiful color, perhaps a one fingered head that quickly dissipates. Good, could drink all day, but not overly striking."
"Bottle courtesy of Naven: Poured a medium brown color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some good lacing as well. Aroma of dry malt with some fresh lightly bitter hops. Taste is also well balance between dry malt with some very light sweet notes and a dry light bitter finish. Average body with medium carbonation. Overall, I thought this was simple without much complexity but well made to quench thirst."
"A medium bodied ale which was sweet and malty. Drinkability was good. I would most definately recommend this ale to anyone looking for an enjoyable ESB."
"Pours a dark rich copper hue with a huge two finger light khaki colored head. Head dies down a bit after pour to a nice lacing throughout tasting with good stickiness. Smell is very nutty with a nice caramel malt. Fresh fruity hop odor is present as well. Flavor is extremely crisp with a nice woody hop flavor. Sweet nutty malt flavors balances out the initial hop bite extremely well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of bubbles. Really enjoy this brew, can't say I've had an ESB quite like this. Alesmith amazes everytime, pick this one up for sure."
"This isn't so bad if you keep it very cold. Not what I was expecting from a giant like AleSmith."
"A co-worker brought some Alesmith bombers back from CA for me (very cool dude) and this was one of them. The beer poured a nice dark orange which was almost brown. The head was large, white and rocky. The bottle conditioning really carbonates this beer as I got way too much foam even though I poured slowly and gently. The smell was a little malty and caramel but not much in the way of hop aromas. The taste was good with caramel coming into play and maybe it was citrus I was detecting. The drinkability was very good as my pint was gone fast. Mouthfeel really benefits from the bottle conditioning as the beer feels creamy in the mouth."
"Light-to-medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance seems good. The metallic finish is a little oftputting. It's not there constantly, but when it sneaks through it kind of overwhelms the rest of the flavors. Factoring that in, that pulls down the score. Drinkability is good, and I'd be interested in trying out another example to see if the metallic characteristic is always this evident."
"It's a reddish orange in color, but the head is barely adequate. Enjoyable smell of crisp, fresh hops and a bit of chocolate and caramel are picked up by the nose. Taste is both fruity and hoppy, but more bitter than hoppy. Peach flavor can be traced, and has a yeasty finish. By the feel of the beer, I would have guessed it was English, so props to AleSmith for that. Pretty good stuff, though the style doesn't blow me away."
"D- Rather easy to drink ESB, but the high level of carbonation (almost foamy in mouth) detracts from the overall taste. I am a big fan of Alesmith, but this beer lacks overall character that would warrant repeat performances given other options in the ESB category (as well as other more desirable Alesmith choices)."
"Thinner medium body with very active carbonation. Almost a little too active. This bomber will be finished off rather easily. Very sessionable brew."
"D: This is a very sessionable beer. It goes down very easy. Part of that is because it's a rather bland beer. All in all, it's rather unmemorable. Probably not something I'll be picking up in the future."
"Pours a dark coppery orange, slight sediment makes it hazy, with a good sized tan head that slowly recedes. Nice light sweet malty aroma. Musk melon fruity and candy sweetness, nice and light, also some citrus notes, but definitely more melon-y sweetness. Taste is more of the melon and fruity sweetness, a little candy like, some slight peppery and dry bitterness balances very nicely. Low level of carbonation with a light to medium and creamy body is balanced by a peppery tingle on the tongue from the hops and what carbonation is present. Very nice, highly sessionable beer."
"A very nice ESB. Not my favorite style of beer, but I enjoy this one and it's rather refreshing too. I'll likely get this again, and it leaves me curious about the other AleSmith beers as well."
"This arrived at my table basically lacking a head. This could have been due to a wait time, but it detracted from the overall look of the beer. There really wasnt much smell to speak of, slight malt, but really dull in the aroma area. As you sip in the malt provides you with the first note, followed by some citrusy hops. The taste is subtle like a good English ESB. There also was not much carbonation to this brew, even for an ESB. This could be the reault of a poor keg/tap but the Liars Club is usually on point. Still at $2.50 a pint I could knock back a few of these."
"Not hard to drink, but not something I'd reach for."
"Drinkability: Definitely sessionable and worthy of a session too."
"Many thanks to IntriqKen for this 22 oz bottle. Pours a hazed copper amber body with a small beige head. Scattered lacing left behind. Aroma is malty caramel and toffee, floral hops, appleskins and some orange esters. Velvety medium body with an English feel from the conditioned water. Taste is malty with toffee and caramel, balanced well with an English style floral hop bitterness. The apple skin presence from the aroma shows up in the taste, as well, joined by some pear. Slight metallic note from the water lends a Burton-On-Trent feel. Very nice! A very well constructed, California brewed ESB in the best English tradition. Very sessionable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"A great ESB, but not my favorite beer since I am a bit of a hop head. Scores are more reflective of stylistic accuracy rather than my personal preference. Easy to drink, would session quite well."
"Very pleasant english ESB, true to style and a very nice product indeed."
"Medium body with a light tingle of carbonation. Lingering caramel malt flavor with some fuggley bitterness as well."
"Mouth: Excellent. Sweet honey flavor up front with a bitter, grassy finish. The hops are really herby and fresh from front to back. Tastes kind of like tea and honey, with a bitter roasted finish. Mouthfeel is superb, running enjoyable carbonation from front to back, as well."
"This beer is insanely drinkable and refreshing... I could drink this one all day and it's so flavorful I am very tempted to. This is a great beer from Alesmith and I will seek it out again. If you're looking for a nice mellow change of pace from those hop bombs, look no further... this is one tasty easy drinking beer!!"
"D- mellow, well crafted. This would go well with a cheese and cracker snack or at a relaxing dinner. This brew now has me wanting to dig into this ESB style some more. Delightful."
"D - This is one of the easiest drinking beers I have had. If only the aroma, taste and mouthfeel stood out a little more this would be very impressive."
"D: Not a bad ESB but certainly not my favorite style or Alesmith beer. The ESB probably would have been my least choice to throw on cask but who am I to complain :)"
"Overall, very drinkable and a great session beer!!"
"I've only had a couple of ESBs and they are more watery than I like. This one is very drinkable, but the mouthfeel is not reallly what I prefer. The taste is well-balanced. The color is nice. It poured with literally no head at all. I don't know if that is normal for an ESB or not, but I was a bit surprised by it. There's not doubt that this is a quality beer, but it just isn't my favorite style. Still, since the taste is good and it is very drinkable, it would make a good session beer."
"Also want to say thanks to Peter for running a great company (AleSmith)."
"."
"Drinkability was just great- A very solid beer by Alesmith. Best ESB i've had."
"A damn fine ale. I've only had a few ESB's, and this one is great. Very easy to drink."
"Very light, with a bit of flavor. Easy to drink, but I can't really see why I'd want to. Next time I have a craving for an ESB I'll go for a Fuller's or Young's."
"Tastes williamette hoppy. Very dirty earthy hops with an underlying malt sweet. There is a bitterness I'm not fond of. I can't tell if the bitter is from hops or failed malt. Malt tastes like rancid caramel and leaves a plastic aftertaste in my mouth. Some dry chocolate and biscuit qualities now that I'm giving a more detailed examination. Dry finish is grassy from hops without hop bitter. Very weedy rough. Toasted grain finish comes across almost as burned. This was not an enjoyable beer, IMO. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet md-light. Carbonation is mild and a thin layer of head hung around until the bottom of the glass."
"Beer is good. Happy beeing."
"Beer pours a cloudy amber color that indicates it could be dry hopped. Also, it has a small head despite an agressive pour. Head goes down fairly quickly leaving a bit of lacing in its wake. Smell is suprisingly light. Some malts and a citris hop profile, but not in big quantities. Taste, wow, I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Tastes like a well hopped brown ale. Smoky malts make the first impression, followed by a nice hop profile, but not over the top. Very smooth and well balanced. Mouthfeel is pretty full despite the low abv, and the drinkability is also nice. I wouldn't mind having another. Not at all."
"Drinkability was fairly good with a little more body and some heft in the bittering department it would be excellent. As is it is a very drinkalbe brew but not a full-on ESB for me."
"Delightful summer ale....so fresh tasting and very quenching."
"Mild ale sweetness amd wholesome bready notes in the aroma. Orange/amber body with a wispy oil slick of a head. Grain-tinged fore is mild on the tongue with an equally mild hop profile. very grainy feeling and tasting and that invokes bread some biscuit and a general heartiness to the beer. Thicker feel than many ESBs Ive had and good overall flavor intensity."
"22oz. Pours a clear amber with not much head. Very little carbonation. Scents of apples and hops on the nose. Roasted, carmelized, slightly coffee flavors mixed in with bitter notes that continue into the finish. Thought the roasted flavors overwhelmed the fruit and predominated the taste buds. Bottle courtesy of Zorro."
"OVerall a very nicely balanced beer that is easy to drink and well crafted. I would enjoy drinking a few of these in a sitting."
"When poured, it was a medium orange brown in color with no foam or lace. The smell was of lightly roasted malts and mild hops. The taste was the same a the smell, but lacking any quality of taste. Like I said, a weak and flat taste of malts and hops, with a hint of spice and fruit. This is not what I expected with Alesmith. So far, this is the worst beer that I've tasted from Alesmith. Not impressed."
"Give it a try, I was plesantly suprised by this ""not one of their bigger beers"" from AleSmith...cheers."
"Quite a drinkable number, though it might be a little too sweet for some."
"Cheers."
"Picked up this gem at Wild Oats in Scottsdale, AZ. what a rare treat this was. I was out hiking in the desert all day and got back to the hotel in time to order room service. They asked if I needed anything to drink with my meal and I said no thanks...I was already supplied with some of this brew and some Alaskan Smoked Porter. Great brew this one. Nicely balanced, clean on the palate deep chestnut and faint carbonation. A great session brew."
"D - A very drinkable beer. Session beer for sure. I'd buy this again."
"22oz bomber that I purchased on my trip to SoCal a few weeks back. Pours a deep clear copper; frothy head that dies slowly and leaves lace in its wake as I drain the glass. Sweet malt and hazelnut in the nose, and subtle smattering of hops. Flavor yields one of the most balanced brews I've ever sampled. Dry, toasted biscuity malt up front, balanced perfectly with a very mild bitter finish...orange peel and blueberry linger in the aftertaste, ever so sweet. Carbonation is very light and tingling and the beer manages to be quite smooth on the palate, though has enough before it gets anywhere near ""creamy."" Relatively low ABV plus the aforementioned balance and deliciousness make this one hell of a session beer. Alesmith, please send kegs to PA."
"Bomber with a silk screen label, poured into a 0.5L stein. This is a bottled conditioned beer so I left about ½ at the bottom to keep the sentiment out of my glass. This ESB is a rich caramel color with medium white head made of small bubbles that dissipated but kept a nice thing rim of foam around the side. Understated aroma with notes of maple syrup, plumb, and faint hints of bitter citrus. The flavor is a rich bled of caramel and bread crust, apples and leaf tea which finishes with a medium bettering hop-profile. It is very well balanced and a very good American example of this classic British style. The mouthfeel is soft and full, almost creamy but not too viscous. Good drinkability, consistent with the style; a good session beer."
"Taste is very simple, just swirling sweet mid-spectrum malt with a citrusy hop bitterness, and slight yeast near the finish. This is a good ESB, but too sweet. Mouthfeel is right on if it had just a touch more carbonation."
"Pours a hazy copper colour, with a wonderful creamy white head. Toasty, sweet and very fresh. Very fruity and herbal. Medium bodied, nice fluffy mouthfeel, muted carbonation and great drinkability. Very smooth and extremely drinkable. Very nice and flavourful ESB."
"The carbonation almost stings my tongue, which is good, because the slightly hoppy aftertaste brings out the best of the sugary malts and rounds out the flavor with flying colors. Drinkable, you bet! Viva la ESB!"
"Just a joy to drink. This would easily be a favorite around my place were it more easily available. As is, it's something to look forward to when travelling through those areas where it is available. Great beer!"
"ESBs are evidently not my preference although I like the option I would opt for something else."
"Being unfamiliar with the ESB style, I really have nothing to compare this to but my own tastebuds. From that, I can say Anvil is a smooth, crisp drinker with loads of hop and malt character."
"Bright amber color, very clear, this beer came from the bottle with a thin tan head. Wonderfully complex nose. Fruity with green apples, figs and light toffee. The flavor a light caramel note, followed by more of the fruit, red delicious rather than green apples. Silky, light mouth feel is a huge surprise. This beer would be incredible on a warm summer day."
"Thankfully I know a place where I can get a bunch of these guys and I can only hope to see it on tap anywhere I go."
"I would buy this again, I respect Alesmith for perfectly replicating a British ESB with no compromises, no ""Americanization"" etc. Definitely an amazing brew, by virtue of the skill of it's crafters."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable, and nicely reminsecent of cask conditioned beers. Very well done - wish I could get it locally."
"Drinkability: So damn smooth, I could drink this every day. Anvil has become the ESB to top in my book, and holds its own against pretty much anything else as well. In my top 5, easily."
"Orangey-amber color with a fine, sticky off-white head. Aromas of candied citrus fruit and lightly toasted caramel. Soft, mellow nose with a slightly juicy, ripe citrus/orange blossom hoppiness on an estery caramel malt frame. Mouthfeel is excellent. Supple, spicy, very light spiced bread sweetness towards the back, with a fresh, cleansing finish. Maybe just a bit watery. Nicely integrated flavors, true to the English style, and very quaffable. Its reminiscent of Stoudt's Scarlet Lady with its mellow orange spicyness. Excellent ESB, one of my favorites."
"Orange/amber in colour with a slightly lower than average carbonation level. Aromas are quite fruity from both the yeast and the fruity-floral English (maybe Goldings) hops. Theres a good balance between the caramel malt and hop flavors, and some additional mineral and yeast notes too. The mouth feel is quite unusual: very smooth and rounded... almost salty, but not overly heavy. Doesn't quite pack the same flavor punch as the best ESBs that I've had, but this is still highly drinkable stuff. It was great with steak."
"Another awesome brew for AleSmith. Pours a dark golden color with a small head, but leaves some nice lacing through out. Nice scents of hops, malt, and some sweetness. This ESB tastes quite a bit different than other ESBs I've had, but it's still very good. What's missing is the bitterness and bite at the end. This ESB is sweet and light, dry. Like I said this is an awesome brew from AleSmith give it a try, just to be different, LOL"
"Slightly disappointed by this one. I was expecting more but it is still very good. Again, something I can't quite put my finger on is preventing this ESB from breaking through into the upper tier of beers. Maybe that aforementioned butter aftertaste is too strong. Maybe the hops need to be more noticeable."
"This beer is extremely drinkable, with an incredible flavour and in my opinion, perfect alcohol level. Will definitely be having more of this one!"
"After the incredibly wonderful, delightfully delicious AleSmith IPA and YuleSmith DIPA, my expectations for Anvil Ale were sky high. Although it failed to meet those expectations, it's far from disappointing beer. In the final reckoning, it's a good example of the American ESB style and should appeal to a wide range of people."
"Drinkability- Bar none the best of a lone few ESB's I have ever had. Still new to this style, but this was very flavorful and easy to drink."
"Clear, warm amber with one finger of eggshell head. Anvil has a light fruity nose melded to a cidery smell and a strange taste thats too fruity to be traditional yet too quirky to appease innovative artistry. The flavor tilts towards apricot with a bittering element sharper than historic trends. Anvil tastes like an American pale with over-conditioned water and left me in no hurry for another."
"The smell is dominated by malts. In the taste, this one starts to shine, with a great balance between malts and hops. Light hints of fruitiness come though with hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is solid and pleasing while the drinkability is very high."
"Notes: Almost average across the board. I think I rank the beers low compared to others but I like to think i'm consisten so it doesn't matter. I enjoyed the malty/hop contrast and it has a nice lingering aftertaste. They hide the alcohol well and a decent appearance. Incredibly smooth and refreshing."
"against: perhaps lacking slightly in character/complexity"
"Nice beer."
"The taste is benevolent with its flavors. Sweet malts finish in a toffee and caramel kiss. The mouth is left immediately wanting. It takes a second sip to realize that the flavor wants to hide, but can't quite fully. What's amazing is this beer is so uniuqe - not only as an ESB but as any beer, and it emplores you to pay it all the attention it deserves."
"Slightly hazy, deep amber colour topped by a thin lace of off-white head. Even with the minimal head from the pour, the retention was excellent and resulted in lace all the way down the sides of the glass. The aroma had a little bit of caramel sweetness along with a complex hop profile consisting of floral, pine, citrus and a bit of spiciness. The flavour was very nicely balanced between malt and hop character. Nice base of malt sweetness with caramel and biscuit evident. Bitterness was assertive, but without any resinous quality, and a nice piney/floral flavour. The finish was short, but maintained its balance. Body was medium/light and carbonation was moderate. Smooth texture. Overall, a really nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel: All around this is a truly remarkable beer. The flavors are well crafted and balanced to provide a wonderful drinking experience. Nothing is overdone while nothing is also under represented. Excellent in the true sense of the word. This beer excels in flavor where others simply cannot."
"Brown body with reddish reflects. Dull short-lasting off-white head. Fairly typical nose, an average blend of malt and hops. Slightly floral and stale goldings while the malts come out earthy, rather husky and almost grainy. Pretty dry on the tongue, almost sandy. Feels oxidized to me, husky malts and orangey hops providing a toothpaste reminiscent grassy/minty/soapy hop profile. Dull palate, light-medium body, lightly oily. Huh.. Wheres the rich Alesmith malt?"
"I am surprised I was able to finish a 750 over lunch, but I did. It is nicely done, somewhat bitter and not complex. But went well with various lunch dishes. Rather mild Malty and floral and understated fruitiness. Thanks Don for bringing back fresh from San Diego!"
"Major props to drewbage for this hand trade, giving me a chance to experience some West Coast brews not always accessible in these parts."
"Appearance is a solid copper color that is leaving little lacing behind. Nose is subtle, of malts, hops, and a light wiff of fruits. Taste is of caramelly malts, slight bittering hops, and a light fruity finish. Mouth feel is full and lively. Overall drinkability is near perfect as the ABV is quite harmless, the beer is flawlessly smooth, and my palate has lots to contemplate with this complex well brewed beer!"
"As ESB's go, this is a very enjoyable brew..."
"This beer pours an amber color with a small head that doesn't stick around long and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has some light floral hopping as well as a toasty malt. The flavor is very dry and somewhat mild. Toasty malts and a light hopping make it easy to drink, but it's lacking some flavors. Very enjoyable, but it could use something to kick it up."
"This beer pours a nice deep rubied amber color with a small head that nicely coats the top of the beer. The nose is nice. Lots of sweet caramel balanced out with a light bitter from the hop. The flavor is somewhat light for my liking. The caramel and hops are there, but feel rather distant, and not quite as brilliant as I would like them to be. The feel is moderate and nice, with a very light carb. Drinkability is very nice as well. The beer is very smooth, not too filling and very easy to put away. Again, another great showing from Alesmith."
"Clear copper-amber with tangerine edges. Small, light-khaki head. Smells of toasted caramelly malt, with sweetish minerals and floral, perfumey hops. Nice. Toasted biscuit malt flavors up front. Not much sweetness at all. Dry. Subtle fruits come out, before the perfumey/floral, yet bitter, hops come in. Finish is dry, bitter (kind of astringent actually), with traces of fruit. Medium-bodied, dry, and minerally. Not bad, but certainly nothing special."
"3. finishes sweet"
"My first beer whilst visiting San Diego for the first time. The convenient store near my hotel had a few AleSmiths. The ESB is a nice copper color with a very thin head, relatively low carbonation. The smell is pleasant, nothing mind-blowing, just some sweet malt with the faintest grassy hops background. This drinks like an ESB that has been brewed with some brown sugar or molasses or something like that. It has that slightest cloying flavor that goes away just before it becomes too much. As it warms, this is accentuated, and the hops profile drops significantly. There are definitely some toffee notes here. Overall, a nice session beer this would make, with some fish and chips. It reminded me of Old Peculiar, but slightly lighter and less cloying."
"Drinkability  This is a great session beer that came across as a bit bockish but went down well."
"Absolutely wonderful. The only more I would ask for is some additional yeast character. Maybe hints of phenolics or diacetyl even could bring this beer over the edge. As it is, though, it is something I really wish I could have all the time."
"Sampled on tap at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Appeared a deep copper with a sticky white head that converted to a creamy ring & left an intricate web of lacing down the pint glass. Earthy hops, caramel malt, & sweet fruit in the nose. Rich malts everywhere...loads more caramel with toasted almonds & toffee. Fantastically balanced by spicy, peppery, in-the-ground floral hops. Beautifully balanced, seriously complex ale (especially for a fairly low gravity brew). Medium to light bodied, almost airy in the mouth. It was tough for me to have just one of these, what a treat. Without a doubt, one of the best ESB's I've had."
"This poured out a clear amber color with a slight of white head that left virtually no lacing around the glass. The aroma smell of sweet caramel with a bit of earthy toned hops peaking every now and then. The flavor was very mild with caramel malt and balancing earthy hops that added a nice bitterness. The mouthfeel was about light-medium with a super creaminess about it that allowed it to go down of so smoothly. Very light refreshing sessionable brew here that can be put down all night."
"Pours a nice golden orange with a very fine head that leaves nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Nose is of slight hops. Taste is kind of like the malt backbone of a pale ale, that almost sour wateriness with hints of slight citrus. But then...you get the hop aftertaste. It isn't aggressive, and it isn't sharp, but it's definitely bitter. Not in your face bitter, but a slight earthy bitter that acts as a nice counterpoint. The carbonation is low. Nice and smooth, but maybe I'd want more. Intensely quaffable, though, and if I were out in California, I'd drink this as a session brew."
"Overall, I'm kinda on the fence about Alesmith's take on the ESB. It seemed so low in carbonation that it had me thinking it was cask-conditioned. The flavors struck me as being backward from how I normally taste beer. That said, I'd probably look elsewhere for my next ESB."
"Brown 22 oz. bomber with a bit of information about the beer on the back side. The pour into a standard pint glass is deep reddish amber in color, and clear in texture with a light carbonation level forming a small head. The aroma is malty with notes of honey, and a delicate flowery hoppyness. The taste is very mild with sweet caramel malts, a decent dose of bittering citric English hops, and a touch of roasted nuts. Smooth and soothing on the palette with a medium creamy thick body that has a dry aftertaste. Very sessionable beer that I wish I could get my hands on more often."
"A great beer. Easily the best of the style I have ever had."
"A tasty brew highly recommended."
"Thanks to xlperro for the bomber!"
"My 2nd Alesmith, and a solid style of a small beer. Though I'm not a huge ESB fan, I still like this beer, and I'd have it again, especially if Alesmith shipped west (we can dream, can't we?)"
"I could drink a keg in one sitting and still be thirsty. For reals."
"Appearance: Poured into my Aventinus glass after sitting out of the fridge for awhile allowing it to warm up a bit, forms a nice caramel tan head that compliments the deep plum ruby tone of the body nice and cloudy some yeasties floating around. Lacing chunky patches spread unevenly with each sip not bad. Aroma: Hops have a very herbal tone with some caramel malts seeking through and a mineral note to add as well a bit metallic but not in an off way. Taste: Fair mix of big flavors with a great amount of hoppiness that is almost tame due to the amount of malts used here perfect sparring match between the caramel malts and piney hops great balance is where this beer got it's reputation, not in your face flavor. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied mellow carbonation nice texture going down. Drinkability: The balance of flavors is what makes this beer great overall ESB fits the style while still adding it's own flavor."
"This was an extraordinarily nutty beer, and otherwise reminded me of Fullers ESB. Amber copper opaque body with a thin head and amazing lace. Hop flavor is to complementary to the nut-bread malt back bone and not as bracing as many other reviewers state. The thin creamy carbonation was delightful. This was a great brew, had at fathers office in Santa Monica. Went wonderfully with food, but had enough personality to love on its own."
"A lightly chill-hazed ruby-amber-copper color that is topped by a tan head. Aromas of caramel malt and subtle hop aromas. Perfectly carbonated for a beer called ESB, nice and light. Malty with some toasted malt/ biscuit notes. Lightly sweet in the finish, accompanied by a pleasing bitter hop finish. Pretty well balanced leaning perhaps a bit more to the hop side of the spectrum. A nice session beer, that I would love to sample from the cask. There is a very nice pleasing fruitiness that expresses itself as the beer warms up. I was very impressed by this beer, shows a sense of balance & subtlety that is too often overlooked by many American micros."
"This nice ESB pours a cloudy amber, head retention is excellent, and lacing is beautiful. Aroma is pretty mellow, with malt dominating. Very smooth malty taste profile with a touch of hop, very grainy too. Ultra-drinkable ESB from a brewer whose beers I have been very curious about. Very nice beer. Thanks to rkhaze who is a part of some great guys at the Whole Foods meat department I shop at."
"A decent appearance with a tawny amber body and a nice cream head and nice lace. The nose is light and gives off malt with light floral hops in the background. Mild flavoring with a decent balance but little bittering. The feel is fairly creamy with little crispness in the finish. Easily drinkable session brew as the ""Liar's Brew"" at the Liar's Club."
"Drinkability: A poor showing IMO from Alesmith, but I wonder if I got a bad bottle. There is no ""born on"" or ""drink by"" date, so maybe it sat too long on somebody's shelf. Might try again, but not likey."
"mouthfeel is lush and well rounded. great balance here and just a perfect beer for a hop head."
"This ale drinks well and would be a fine session beer. I feel this ale could be a nice crossover ale for macro drinkers because it is smooth and not too strong. It does not overwhelm the palate."
"I originally sampled this beer on 27 May 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This pours a nice copper color. It is smooth on the palate. In my opinion, this would be a very good session beer. It's nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. Given that other Alesmith beers are world class, this one isn't worth seeking out"
"Sweet, fruity taste rings through and through the length of the large bottle's contents. A surprising treat, though I've heard so many good things about Alesmith, I shouldn''t have been shocked. One of the best ESBs to have met my lips! Big thanks to BierRiese for providing!"
"-F"
"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is brown sugar and malts. A lighter bodied ESB. Malty and slightly hoppy. Well balance. Very tasty. More in the English style of bitter. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This is one classy brew! It's almost casky. Creamy, smooth, beautiful."
"Not much of a head on this one with only slight lacing in the glass which sems typical of an ESB. Reminds me alot like Fullers ESB. Has that English thing going on just not as bitter as an English ESB. Overall nice tasting beer and another great ale from Alesmith."
"Copper in color, with a frothy, lacy, off-white head. Aroma is pretty mild, though with a bit of honey sweetness and herbal hops. Flavor is much the same, surprisingly sweet mid-palate for an ESB, though the hop finish balances things off nicely. I haven't much to say about this beer, really. It's tasty and very drinkable, but not as impressive and deep as I would expect from Alesmith."
"Well done Alesmith! I wish this was available in the Midwest. More please..."
"Very nice looking beer here. Dark reddish brown with a nicely sized off-white head. Leaves lots of lace, and head retention is pretty decent. The aroma features floral hops galore along with a healthy dose of biscuity and grainy malt. Quite nice. The flavors are even more impressive. Starts off with just a little bitterness, then goes to a nice biscuity maltiness. In the middle, the bitterness returns, showing more hop character. It's oily/resiny and slightly leafy. The leafiness increases in the back and in the aftertaste. Malt is a little sweet and grainy in places. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth. Finishes with a final stroke of bitterness. One excellent ESB right here! Grab it if you can!"
"orange in color, poured very not agressive, this beer still came out with a gigantic thick white, big bubbled head. suprisingly their was no sediment in the bottle, which from previous reviews i thought there would be. the aroma was alright, the head bubbles, kind of hid it, but what i got from it with a slightly fruity hop and rust mixture, it was in a clean glass. the taste itself was pretty good, malty with a nice hop bitter. highly carbonated, maybe too much even. fruity, little citrus, orange-ish. super creamy in mouth feel. still it had a slight metallic taste. the body was medium and left a nice aftertaste."
"Carefully poured off of the yeast sediment it's only slightly hazy. The body is a standard amber color and the head is a short, creamy, light tan cap that holds well, keeping a thin and creamy 1/4"" surface covering throughout the pint. Very nice appearance! The aroma comes on strong. It's sharply fruity and citrusy (orange, apricot, some lemon) over a sweet caramel and honey-ish malt - definitely attention getting! The body is medium with a lightly zesty carbonation that tickles the tongue. The flavor is a combination of fruity, citrusy (orange, grapefruit) and floral flavors from yeast and hops, married with a softly sweet and lightly toasty malt that's backed by a supportive bitterness. It finishes fruity but drying with some residual toffee-ish malt and swirling hop flavors. Very nicely balanced. Quite supple, and alive with bold flavors! Very clean and clearly well brewed. It's a bit of an American interperetation, and dare I say it, a touch one-sided (although that goes partly to the style)... but also highly drinkable. Well worth seeking out."
"Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with a perfect 1/2"" tan head that sloslw sinks down to a nice film. Slightly bitter, earthy hops dominate the aroma with a nice backdrop of sweet malt. Sweet toasty malt is the first to land on the tongue as it smooths over the interior of the mouth and slides down the throat in all its silkiness. As the sweetness of the malt descends a bit the subtle hops emerge and provide just the right dose of bitterness through the slightly bitter lingering finish. This brew has a great balance and excellent medium body. Although no single characteristic stands out as being amazing or remarkably memorable the balance and drinkability of this brew make it special for its overall qualities."
"Nice copper color with a small but appropriate head for the style. The smell is malty with a nice hop background. Everything comes together nicely in the taste, which has currents of toasted bread and just a bit of fruity flavor. The malt flavor is well balanced when the hops hit the back of the tongue on the way down. It has a wonderful creamy feel and is profoundly drinkable. Who'd have thought that guys out of San Diego would be able to hold their own with the boys from Fuller's?"
"The pour a quite deep crystal clear deep amber to almost brown color, the head monumental in size, creamy in texture, the lace in thick glutinous sheets that cling snuggly to the glass. Malt dominates the nose, some yeast and light floral tones also noticed. Start is malt sweet, the top is middling, snappily hopped, droughty aftertaste."
"Hail-Smith!!"
"nice copper color...bubbly creamy head..english malts on nose and buds...flatish/sweet mouthfeel with malt dominate..very slight smokiness on the nose..spicy..lovely soft, sweet, grainy taste...This is really something..an outstanding ESB..."
"This is a light copper color, but there are very fine particles in suspension.  Unlike I've seen before.  Not a lot of head.  There's some raw-hide hop aroma in this one.  I like it.  I really like this taste.  Husky, grainy and a bit raw, but also smooth.  There is a really mellow bitterness.  This beer is really nice and easily drinkable.  One of the best ESBs I've had."
"Notes: Do this beer some justice, serve it at cellar temp and in a big mug to give nice firm pouring. Highly drinkable with back and forth flavours from the malt and hops. Right on target for the style, back and forth of hops and malt … this one is a keeper."
