"a colossal esb, as hoppy as any ipa, but still very much done in the English tradition. bronze in color, mostly clear, and holding a white head for quite awhile. also a real affordable bomber around 5 bucks, super fair here. an aroma of grassy bittering hops in aggressive proportion, and enough carbonation to tickle my nostrils as I sniff. malt is big too, some probably 60 crystal, as well as some maris otter or the like, its bready and fat I the middle, and a higher gravity English ale yeast dries it up pretty good. the hops are center stage throughout though, and the balance that the style usually demonstrates is ignored. that's okay through, the magnum is a fun varietal not often used in such hefty doses and I think the result is good. rock art has evolved nicely over the years, and this extreme series is all worth checking out. love the hoppy Vermont stuff, and rock art deserves more attention for its hoppy beers. top quality."

"appears a clear bright copper color with bright white head that fades. smells earthy, grassy hops and oxidized malt. taste is biscuity malt, bitter finish. herbal flavors. medium body, moderate carbonation. oily mouthfeel. overall a bit disappointing in the flavors."

"Sorry Rock Art, but I won't be buying anything from you anytime soon. I almost wonder why this beer made the list. Some might like this style, but I ain't one of them! (I used ain't twice in this blog post.) The best thing about this beer is the name. Might be the longest beer name out there."
"The nose and flavors/aftertaste very much remind me of Gigantic IPA from Oregon, but this is a Vermont product and a decent one at that. A good value and worth a try."

"(4.0) D: Not quite up there with Vermonster, but an excellent Rock Art offering that I always try and grab when I’m in the area. Worth a try."

"O - This is a really bold flavored and hop forward ESB, not like any other I've had. It was well done and had a good layering of flavors with a sweet bitterness on the end. Good beer, glad to have tried it!"
"Not your typical ESB, This one poured out with a nice deep orange color with a cream colored head on top. The smell of this beer was definitely dry hopped and gives off plenty of floral hop aromas in the nose. The taste of the beer was nice but again not a traditional ESB flavor. Big amounts of bitter flavors dominate the maltiness of this brew. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a nice smooth texture with a sharp crisp finish to it. Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit but if you're expecting a true ESB style beer look elsewhere because this one is more like an IPA."
""
"Overall: It is what I expected from an ESB, I enjoyed this brew from begining to end. I would buy again if I was in the mood."
""
"O: The saying on the bottle says it all, ""this ain't for no mama's boy or daddy's girl"". This is my first Rock Art and I am a bit impressed by the complexity of this beer. Not something I would seek out again, but good to experience at least once."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a dark orange, with a one inch white with some floaties, leaves some lacing. Smell is pear, pine, hard candy, and some grass. Taste is better, a good amount of grapefruit in the finish, some carmel in the beginning to go with the flavors detected in the nose. Body medium large, plenty of life, not dry, and for a hop lover very drinkable. Not really sure what style this reminds me most of, but a nice somewhat different beer."
""
"Tastes like copius amounts of pale malt extract. Nose is the same. Very litter carbonation borderlining on none. Body is big up front but thundering out big time on the swallow. Earthy English hops provide some fleeting bitterness but there's no malt sweetness to balance it just malt blandness. Seriously tastes like unfermented home brew. Probably not finishing this bottle. I had high hopes for this beer getting mostly good beer from these guys but this and infusco are gross."
"Really enjoyed this brew though, great take on an ESB, definitely ""Extreme"" as the label promises. Dial up some English Malt flavor and you've got a serious winner here."
"Overall – very decent brew. Interesting to think about and good-tasting."

"I will try to braise a little bottom round roast and create a Beef Carbonade with it. Maybe add some root veggies and wild mushrooms into the mix."

"O- Although I am a HUGE fan of Rock Art (check out my other reviews), I just don't think the ESB style (especially this hyped-up interpretation) is pleasing to my palate. However, I encourage fans of ESB's to give this one a try and rate it for yourselves...you just might find something wonderful in this brew. However, I will stick with other offerings from Rock Art."

"D: A very well done job of pushing the envelope. You can definitely see the IPA comparisons with the significant hop punch. However, I feel that this one demonstrates the style differences quite well. An IPA this size would be more flabby – more lip coating sugar tack, more sweetness, more caramel – and hopefully with a more forward hop nose. ESB2 is still robust, but more taut and less decadent."
"Is this an ESB, I don't know. The hoppiness is right in your face. It is however a very good beer."
"First of all, it's not esb^3 it's esb^2. Second of all, this may be the best of the best in bottled VT bombers. Nothing McNeils produces can touch the flavor this beer leaves on the palate. Anything from Long Trail, Magic Hat & Wolaver's (Otter Creek), simply don't compare, and should all bow to this absolute monster. All in all a great beer, and vastly overlooked. (Hill Farmstead not included, as, they don't really bottle yet)"
"This extreme beer is well made and highly drinkable and is a fine example of an esb be it amped up that is. I wonder how this would be on cask."
"Picked this and few other Rock Art beers up in VT for the Phish Phlood benefit show. Glad I got this one for sure. Get it if you can."
"VERY GOOD, SEEK IT OUT!"
"O-Another one of those answers to a question that nobody asked. I dig extreme beers, but this one just didn't have any reason to make me want to try this again."
"Overall: Reminiscent of a barleywine, but more complex than some. A really nice beverage. I had to re-review because my palate was off the first time, and I'm glad I did."
"Good refreshing brew after a long ride on Kingdom Trails in East Burke. It was great to walk in to a gas station market and snag a local beer in a 22-ounce bottle. Highly recommended -- strong enough to mellow me out after logging miles. Best part - solid flavor from start to finish. Worst part - I split the bottle with a friend and only had half."
"Overall, this is a very good beer that I could enjoy in just about any context."
"Overall - I liked this beer and could easily drink more than one in a session."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with a slightly cream texture and helps mask the 8% abv well. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying this IPA... of wait no, I mean ESB, it just not quite as malty or balanced as I would have thought for the style."
"Not a bad brew overall. The aroma is the highlight here. The taste is not bad, I like bitter but it's not as balanced as it should be, leaving with a metalic taste."
"D - Drinkability is moderately low. Much too bitter in the taste without extracting much flavor from the loads of hops in this. The flavor is uninspired and not overly pleasant to drink."
"O- Overall a pretty decent brew that definitely MUCH hoppier than other more traditional ESBs."
"I want another bottle of this stuff."
"Drinkability: A very interesting take on the ESB style, if the nose were better on this, it'd give Three Floyd's Lord Admiral Nelson a run for the title of my favorite of the style. Might pick up again."
"An OK beer. I might drink it again but there are better ESBs out there - I like ESBs."
"Notes: This is my first offering from Rock Art a good find and a good one pick up again. Cheers."
"drinks average at best. kind of like a light barelywine meets an esb, meets an english IPA. not my thing. I will pass next time."
"D-interesting beer, seems quite big almost american barley wine style. very balanced and interesting, huge flavors and hides the alcohol quite well. tasty treat."
"Impression: One of the better ESB's out there, get this if you can, you won't be disappointed."
"Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and slightly oily, no hint of alcohol. Drinkability is very good considering the abv. I sipped the whole bottle myself and enjoyed every drop. Another winner from Rock ARt!!"
"Pours a hazy dark amber color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly to a ring. Smells of earthy herbal resinous hops with a twinge of buttery pale malt. Judging from the aroma this isn't like an ESB I've had before. Taste is malty up front for a couple of milliseconds before the hops assault my palette with all they've got. Bitter herbal resinous citrus hop bite infused with pale and maybe a hint of toffee. Bitter dry finish. Medium body, bitter resinous mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. Pretty good Ipa, but it could probably use a bit more malt backbone. I'm not sure I would ever attach a British style designation to a clearly American take on a beer. I enjoyed it."
"Overall, not like any other ESB I've ever had...the hoppiness is distinctly American. I am not complaining. A very enjoyable beer. I will probably drink this again this summer, especially since it's $3.99 a bomber."
"drinkability- one is enough for me. i struggled to finsih the one i was on"
"D - Will definately have again. Not a bad price for a bomber either."
"Overall, I got a 12 oz. single, and that was enough. This was an enjoyable beer, and it fell o a weaker American Strong Ale than ESB. Not sessionable at all. Very good, but another example of extreme beer that is beginning to bore me. I'd definitely have this again, but my guess is that I just ...won't."
"D - A pretty drinkable ale, however I could probably find many that are more drinkable in this category - I consider this less and ESB and more in the strong ale vein. It probably has a couple months age on it, but it didn't really hinder the hop flavor that much and I do think it is a relatively easy quaff for the 8% it packs - a nice balance compared to others of its ilk."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a nonic pint. Amber color and slightly hazy with a nice rocky, white head. Aromas of toasted malt, nuts and a bit of hop. The hops really come through on the palate, along with biscuity malt and a bit of citrus. Full-bodied, with some good bitterness on the finish. Not my favorite style by any means, but a pretty solid beer."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale and bisquit malt scent. It's sweet smelling with some mild bready notes. The hops are present, but take a back seat to the malts. The taste is good as well. It has a solid malt bill that's big on caramel and bisquit malts. It's bitter, but not overly so; at least it's balanced. It goes down easy with a piney hop finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. I'm not sure it's the best ESB, but it's complex, bitter, and quite enjoyable."
"Pours hazy deep copper with a dense cream colored head that rises an inch above the beer. Smell is dense and hoppy with pine and grapefuit and a thick caramel malt backbone. The flavor is spicy and hoppy, with piles of caramel and thick grapefruity hops. There is a rich peppery bitterness that clings to the back of the throat, but the overall mouthfeel is thin in the middle, with a surprising tea-like quality."
"D- Overall a beer that does nothing to offend but also doesn't do too much to step away from the pack. Good balance but doesn't come off as smooth as many other top ESBs."
"Pours a very nice hazy golden orange color, nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy two-finger off-white head, which leaves some very nice thick/creamy sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, with a nice malt note, nice little citrus note. The taste is sweet, malty, with a nice hop note, citrus, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice brew. My bottle has a 2 on it."
"Taste is extremely bitter...this one lives up to it's reputation. Not really enough juicy hop flavor to go along with it though, so it becomes a somewhat empty bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation levels. A very interesting beer. I wish there was some more depth and complexity to keep the bitterness from completely taking over. Definitely a beer worth checking out though. A true extreme ESB."
"D- Moderate, but enjoyable. I think this is one 'ell of a beer, with major points for style and originality. Rock Art has really started to impress me. Not sure if I'd call it a triple bitter, but it's a malty DIPA with some fantastic hops. I'll be buying this one again."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a good stronger than average beer with some good substance to it that makes it worth drinking for a long time."
"D) A decent ESB. I'd drink another."
"Overall - Not what I was expecting but very, very solid. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again any day, this was one of the highlights of the weekend for me"
"Overall- Smoother than I was expecting and too easy to drink. Awesome beer, and my favorite from Rock Art!"
"Notes: The drinkability is not for session. I like big beers and I love beers that are between 8 and 9% and have the booze well masked,but two of these would be fine for me. Not hard to drink,not a sipper yet this could sneak up on you. A fine beer."
"Update: I did a better pour on the next bottle clear of all yeast, it looks great! A nice deep amber with quite a bit of carbonation! Just be careful when you pour from a 12oz bottle!"
"This one had been aging for the better part of a year before I finally tapped it. It's a cloudy amber color with a modest off-white head that quickly fades to a ring with a modicum of random lacing. The aroma is a thick piney hops and licorice alcohol, grapey malt, beautiful. The flavor is malt-wheat, along the lines of a barleywine with a mellow herbal hop bitter edge and some nutty warmth. It really improves as it warms. Smooth and viscous, mildly carbonated. Very good overall, especially for a barleywine guy like me. Fair drinkability at the least, depending upon your alcohol criteria."
"BA Pamola gets a nod for the intro to this VT brewer, a first taste for me...thanks, Kyle!"
"This is a very respectable brew, not for the faint-hearted or for everyday. But certainly interesting and pleasant enough for sipping. It falls slightly short of greatness."
"D: Average. It's a big beer but it doesn't really feel it. If it actually is 8%, and I doubt it, it will slow you down without giving you a real run for your money."
"Thick, pineapple birthday cake malt hits first then gives rise to a springy floral hop bouquet with honey and jasmine. Very balanced and very refreshing for something so strong (both abv and ibu). Mouthfeel is thick and relaxing, I almost want to just hold it in my mouth for awhile. Aftertaste lingers just long enough to beg for another sip. Overall this beer rocks my socks."
"The feel is thick and creamy with a bitter bite on the way down. It's a little too bitter with no balance as a respite. Good taste but a tad too much."
"If this was labeled ""IPA," I probably would have believed it more than it being labeled an ESB. So in that respect it was a let down for a Bitter fan like myself. Hop fans will love it."
"The drinkability of this makes it dangerous. I will probably be getting a couple more bottles of this on my next visit to break up the stranglehold that the dark heavies seem to have on the winter months. Highly recommended."
"Pours a clear amber color with a thick, foamy beige head. Aroma mostly consist of floral hops with a very slight malt presence. Flavor is once again dominated by hops, but not too bitter. Slightly sweet with a dry hoppy finish."
"Unfortunately, a pretty typical ""Extreme Series"" offering from Rock Art: bulky and over-the-top just for the sake of reaching the previous VT maximum ABV. This one demonstrates an inability to brew a well-crafted, balanced big ESB/IPA. I get it: sometimes you have to take risks to succeed, this one just isn't a success."
"Pretty solid offering, not the best but an interesting take on the style."
"Drinkability: goes down well for being pretty high in alcohol....could do two glasses of this in a night"
"Caramel, toffee, bitter chalky hops, hints of acidity, pine, grassy spicey character, moderate spice character with an almost belgian approach."
"FWIW this is now only ESB squared and not ESB cubed."
"What a name! Good thing this one lives up to that mouthful. A cloudy (unfiltered) straw gold Extra Special Bitter with orange hues. Developed a creamy, glass-crawling white head with good retention that left some nice lacing. Strong, hoppy aroma with a medium-heavy body. Malty bread, apricots, butterscotch, citrus notes. Yum. A great example of their Extreme series, bold and complex."
"drinkability is decent. i think the bitterness level is maybe a touch too high for this one, really clinging and not letting you forget it's there. that's kept mostly in check by the malt and alcohol, but not quite. still, if they were aiming for extreme then they've hit the mark. i wouldn't say no to another."
"Slightly hazed light orange/gold colour with a finger of fine, off-white foam. Plenty of fine lacing as the bubbles settled, good retention. Heavy floral and grapefruit in the aroma, quite juicy, reminiscent of citrus pith. Solid bitterness with a sharp citrus bite, plenty of fruity grapefruit throughout, lingering long into the finish. Biscuity malt and caramel appeared towards the end, but stayed in the background. Light alcohol and mild hop spice in the finish too. Mild warmth, medium body with moderate carbonation, maybe a little on the high side. Creamy texture. Really quite good. Easy drinking for the abv with lots of hop flavour."
"D - I found this smooth, refreshing and very easy to drink."
"Pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a two finger white head with good retention. Sweet fruit aromas couple nicely with the citrus hop aromas of orange. Pine and grapefruit hop flavor up front followed by some light malt and alcohol with a bitter dry finish. Creamy mouthfeel, medium body, light carbonation. Very hoppy and high alcohol for an ESB which explains the ESB cubed in the title. Not a session beer but worth a try."
"D: My favorite ESB to date.... being a hophead I think it has a bit to do with the hops."
"from ppoitras in No BS 3"
"Great beer, but you'd be hard pressed to drink more than one or two. Nice for now though, very robust."
"I loved where this beer was going, but not thrilled where it ended. The alcohol was covered (esp. after the start)- nice hoppiness, but a bit more body and a tie-in between spaces, would go a long way."
"Shortbread cookie and butterscotch malts lead off the palate. Boozy fruits fill-in as big hop bitterness closes in and takes over. Resinous, herbal, minty, and quite bitter. Malt gets a bit stronger as the glass warms. Tongue-numbing finish. Soft, creamy, minerally feel in a medium-full body. Not bad, especially if you like hops!"
"Very fresh from the factory. A bit of cloudy medium yellow, with perpetual white head. Hop aroma is significant. Medium plus mouthfeel, a dangerous drinker and good and full IBU.suitable carbation. A paradigm shift for Rock Art and unique.Double ESB."
"A great ESB, but the ABV limits the drinkability just a bit, especially when putting back a bomber by oneself."
"Very good, not great - solid brew and an interesting take on the style. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinability is good, this strong beer is awesome, goes down well and is very enjoyable."
"An average sample to say the least, and for the fair price I paid, certainly worth a shot..."
"It smelled of citrus and hops. The taste wasn't all that great, it was a mix of orange, lemons, and grapefruit with a hoppy kick. The mouthfeel wasn't anything to write home about and it was easy to drink just not a beer for me."
"D: And down the drain it went."
"Drinkability: not a session beer, but an enjoyable one. One bomber was easy to quaff and enjoy. Worth a try."
"Well, I guess it's possible that the actual IBU's aren't really out of whack, but the perceived bitterness is, and after all, perception is reality, or so they say. It alludes to a balance and then tips brashly to a bitter bias. The ABV is out there a ways, solid and bold, and it works with the blossoming acridity against being especially drinkable. I'm not impressed, but hey, maybe next time."
"Pours a foggy orange brown with a crème head. Nose is hopped. Comes off as a resin-like and very mildly citric edge. Flavor is like a mix of Double IPA and ESB. Hearty hops with a perfume like edge to it. A noticeable bitter tone hits on the end as well. Pretty full carbonation and a well bodied liquid aspect make it nice to drink. I have to agree with Ding on this one and say that this really does seem more IPA-ish that ESB-ish. It's nice-ish to drink-ish, but the whole ESB cubed-ish thing just doesn't really work out."
"Pours a shade lighter than amber with a huge stiff foamy straw colored head that fades in a rocky pattern to gobs of 3D lacing. The smell is first an aggressive toasted lager malt with a flowery pine resin aroma . The back half is slightly clouded and notably fragrant. Medium-full bodied, the mouth feel is nice. A constant stream of effervescence in this SA Perfect Pint, its adequately carbonated and there is a nice creamy texture offset by a warming hoppy character. Full flavored, the toasted malty taste laced with a bitter resin flavor lingers appropriately. Didn't know what to expect, but its a nice drinker. The 8% ABV is warming, but not the least bit distracting. Really glad that i had the opportunity to sample this one. Looking forward to visiting Morrisville, VT."
"I'm not really sure what to think of this ""ESB Squared"" experiment from Rock Art. The thick body and in your face hops and malt definitely made for a tough drinking experience at times. A lot tougher anyway than most of the Double IPAs that this seems to be trying to imitate. Maybe a little more balance would have helped make this a more enjoyable encounter."
"Drinkability: OK, but I will not be buying a third."
"Too much of a good thing? Although I love hops, I also like to have some balance. This is a bold beer."
"Final Note: after reading some of the reviews of this beer, maybe I was the lucky guy who got a really fresh bottle of this stuff? I thought it was delicious and I highly recommend it."
"Citrus and pine in the aroma  quaff had these also, but with a bit a sharp bite. Orange and grapefruit also make an appearance. Even after 9 months of cellering the alcohol has a bit, not bad, of a burn  but it does smooth out towards mid-bottle. But maybe Im just getting a buzz, either way this beer works for me  a good drinker and sippin beer."
"D-this is delicious. A hopheads treat"
"A solid pale ale ? Sure. A triple ESB ? Maybe an ESB-and-a-half. An EESB. Unfortunately though, the label hype had me looking for something bigger and better than Troegs HopBack Amber and this isn't in that league. Needs a bigger beer or a less boastful label."
"Drinkability is pretty good, deceptive alcohol, no heat evident at 8%. Recommended. Reminds me very much of Bell's Two Hearted."
"D-Wonderful aftertaste. The strawberry-kiwi flavor and aroma is so unique I can't get enough. A well crafted, big american ESB of balanced complexity. One of my alltime favorites."
"All in all, this is a pretty good and drinkable beer. An interesting take on the ESB style, certainly worth a try."
"1.6 pint bottle into a Trappist glass....hops cubed indeed noted as the beer is poured, aggressive yet respectful...consistent head on a dense orange body--look of a solid ESB...slick, straight-to-back of mouth push; aftertaste sidles over tongues edges...a complex beer, demanding a full drink...too much hops for an ESB?....a bit of citrus flourish... leery of anything labeled extreme--most of all, beer--and likewise leery of these Vermont brewers (i.e. Magic Hat) who cant confidently categorize their own brews, I still am impressed with an 8% ABV that offers NO hint in the tasting whatever...this beer was a pleasant surprise, and provokes me to seek other Rock Art work..."
"Rock Art Magnumus ete Tomahawkus ESB3 poured a great amber color with a little haze indicative of the bottle conditioned beer. The beer poured with an off-white head that had great lacing and stayed for the duration of the beer. The smell was nice and hoppy with floral and citrus notes giving the greatest bouquet. The taste was exceptional; the floral hops hit the front of the tongue with a pleasant hop bite that mellowed in to a citrusy aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth but not heavy. The alcohol was not detectable in the taste of this strong ESB making it very drinkable."
"Overal a tasty ESB. Impressive, yet hidden ABV."
"A nice big off white head foams up with a strong pour. Clear copper color. Sticky lacing coats the glass as you drink it and it dosn't move. A wiff of citrus hops hits me when i pop open the bottle. At first taste though i get all piney resinous hops. The ABV tells me that there must be some sugar sweetness in this thing but it's hard to find through the pine. Some biscuit malt eventually shows through but just faintly. Mouthfeel is oily. I love pine but this one just dosn't have enough balance. The alcohol shows itself toward the end. Worth a try, but nothing great."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Hazy orange color with a medium head that was very sticky. Mostly a pine aroma, a little bit of floral presence. The taste was mostly all piney hops, a little late bitterness. It had an oily, not altogether pleasant mouthfeel. Not an enjoyable beer."
"Bottle is labeled ""EXTREME"" and then in small print ""This Ain't For No Mama's Boy or Daddy's Girl", and at 8% ABV and 80 IBU's, I was expecting a bold, in your face brew.	 The floral and pine hops are fairly muted, though their hop oils provide a nice slickness to the mouthfeel. Flowery esters dominate the flavor up front, but are soon joined by a caramel sweetness that balances things out. Alcohol is apparent, though not in a bad way towards the finish, which has a tea-like sweetness and astringency. The IBU's creep up on you in this one, and as I near the bottom of my pint, I'm realizing that this isn't as balanced as I first surmised.	For $3.25, this was worth the purchase, if only to have said I tried it, though I don't think I'll be doing so again."
"Not very drinkable for me, lacks depth."
"D - Given things like the word ""Extreme"" and ""ESB3", I was expecting to be blasted with a crazy, uber hop beer like everybody and their mother seems to be creating nowadays, precariously balanced on the brink of a gustatory cliff. Instead, I was presented with a genuinely tasty and super enjoyable ESB that, even though it uses a heavy-handed dose of hops, allows the malts to have a say in it's direction and character. My suggestion? Next time, let the ""super-colossal, big, bold, and brash, you're-not-worthy, crazy and kooky"" marketing bandwagon pass you up by creating a not-so-misleading label and let this well-crafted beer speak for itself."
"This 'Extreme' beer is the best of the three Rock Art offerings that I've had so far. I'm sure that has a lot to do with the fact that I love me some hops. If you're a bona fide hophead who's a quart low on alpha acids, give Magnumus ete Tomahawkus ESB a whirl. It's pretty damn close to pretty good beer."
"989"
"Cloudy golden yellow body with a off white head.Some nice lacing is left on the glass.Smell is pine and grapfruity and some buscuity malt tied in there for good measure.Grapefruit up front and there is a bitter hop in the aftertaste.Mouthful seams a bit thin and like dishwater but enjoyable with a good amount of carbonation.This stuff aint bad but its 80 ibu's and it dont seem that high.I would give it a higher drinkability but its 8% and that may get to you sooner then later.Good stuff but not somthing I will have again for a while."
"Drinkability- It's definitely not a session ale. Drinkability is average at best and if you are going to down a bottle of this, you should have some decent food pairings to keep the alcohol content (8.0% ABV) in check."
"Pours a cloudy coppery-orange color. Fingernail-length head forms on top. Lots of lacing on remains on glass. Smells and tastes rather hoppy, very much like a strong IPA, with a bitter bite on the mouthfeel. Although at 8% you probably couldn't go too far with this one as a session, you will feel satisfied at the end of the bottle. Definitely a winner from Rock Art"
"I liked this one. I was expecting it to be a bit more mellow than it was (although I don't know why as the word extreme is plainly plastered across the front of the bottle) but was not disappointed at all for a bit of a jacked up brew. I'd say it needs an ever so slight tweaking in the balance department to keep the malt more in line with the hops, but it's current makeup is still quite nice and I really have no complaints about it. Recommended."
"Nice balance all around to this beer. Malts were sweet and even had a slight breadiness to the. Hops were a blend of spruce and evergreen and came out more as the beer warmed. I have a hunch this would be a copmpletely different beer if served out of a bottle. Medium body that filled out a bit as moved through the pint glass."
"I love the ESB. It is right up their in my own personal trinity of beer styles, along with the weissbeir and english ale. I certainly give rock art credit for creativity, but this one is just a little over the top. It has a great appearance and excellent mouthfeel, but the extra extra hops and apricotish flavor were a bit of a turnoff. But maybe that's just me..."
"This is an interesting brew, everything it said it was on the bottle. Not that I would drink this with any regularity but it does have a quaffable quality to it indeed, and at 8% that is trouble. I would, however, much prefer a nice sessionable bitter."
"Pours a slightly hazy copperish gold under a one finger white head that fades fairly quickly to thick bubbly film and thin collar, leaving just a couple drops on the glass. The nose is strong of citrus and pine, with a touch of sweet caramel lurking in the back. The mouth is well-carbonated and fairly light. Not much balance here, as the 80 IBUs kick in from the start, opening with a citrus inclination, then quickly moving through coniferous to espresso bitter. The aftertaste is strongly dry and bitter, less like espresso than like chewing on a coffee bean (or a hops pellet). The bitterness lasts and lasts. I'm enjoying it, but it definitely is extreme."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber bottle into a shaker glass. Appears a hazy amber with a finger of white head that leaves a nice lacing as I make my way to the bottom of the glass. Smells of sweet citrus fruits like orange and also a slight raisin note. Tastes of ripe fruit, sweet caramel malt, and bitter hops. Finishes dry and peppery. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The high alcohol precludes this one as a session beer for me, but I had no problem going through the bomber by the time I finished a few slices of pizza."
"This beer could use a bit more malt to balance out the hops. Otherwise it's a very tasty beer that hides it's 8% alcohol well."
"A pretty heavy beer, definitely not a session beer, but very good."
"nice show, like to se some more ""high caliber"" brews from rock art"
"I think that Rock Art is onto something here- an interesting twist in the way that this brew is marketed as opposed to their normal offerings, and a bigger and bolder taste to match."
"M&D - dry and light bodied, not much of a mouthfeel, decent flavors and brew, i was just rather unimpressed, especially for such a pretentious label, latin words and and extreme labels, a decent brew though, not bad"
"22 ounce bomber, no freshness dating, pours lightish, washed out amber, cloudy, with a nice looking, tiny bubble, egg shell head, leaving plenty o' fine, scattered lacing. Nose is of boldly mild British style hops. Flavorful, hoppy Brit style creation, interesting, complex, quite dry stuff. Nice job here by Rock Art. Probably the best one of theirs I've tried. Not quite a double IPA, as others have suggested, more of a double ESB. What ever you want to call it, I like it."
"DA: 8.0 % ABV hits pretty hard after the second 20 oz'er!"
"22 oz bottle. This beer is a true copper color with a half finger of head that settles to a patchy coat. There is a constant and moderate carbonation working up, and the clarity is fantastic. Wafting this one, I get some big toasty and earthy British malt tones with a very solid earthy British hop behind it. There is a light alcohol puff in there that accentuates the earthy notes, and brings out some pine and woodsy notes in the hop. It is enjoyable. The flavor is right on line with the aroma, giving me a blast that combines peppery, earthy and woodsy hop that are accentuated by an alcohol kick and spiceyness. It moves to a more toasted breadyness from the malt, and finishes with a solid resinous woody hop with a moderate bitterness. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick, with a mild carbonation. This one is extremely drying to me. I think this one is a nice brew. Even though the alcohol is apparent, it does not detract. It has a ton of earthyness that really keeps me interested here. I like it."
"Pours a light brown, golden and slightly foggy in appearance that leaves a thick frothy white head that disappears pretty quickly. The aroma is strong molasses, hop citrus, pine, caramel, sugary sweetness. The taste starts bitter upfront with a citrus rind bitterness, followed by a spicy honey flavor on the palate which is smooth but the bitterness is again strong upfront. Overall this is a good beer easily the best Rock Art beer I've tried but not so extreme but quality and worth trying."
"Had this beer on draught here in Manhattan, and boy was I surprised. I've always been fond of drinking beers from this brewery while making visits to family in Vermont, but I was surprised to start seeing the beers available in NYC, and very surprised to see this beer, which is brand new and a very unexpected style to come from a brewery that regularly offers much more mild, and easy drinking session beers (and this is no session beer). The MET ESB3 pours a rich amber color, almost honey gold in it's hues, with a nice frothy head (alpha acids working their magic?). The nose on this beer is very spicy and hoppy, with almost no detection of malts which maybe is due to late addition hops coupled with dry-hopping (I'm guessing). The first taste is full of peppery citrusy hop bite and a crisp dry finish, but after a few more sips the hops balance out and there is a very nice malt sweetness that blends with the strong hop bitterness to offer a very tangy yet still dry finish. This is a very very hoppy and well balanced ale, and the malt flavors I would expect from an ESB are definitely present, but the hops take over very quickly with big grapfruity piney flavors. This is an excellent brew, but I need to do further research with it to see if I can fully appreciate the idea that this is a double (or as the brewer seems to imply triple) ESb. A very good selection, and highly endorsed."
"Pours a darkish, cloudy amber with a decent sized head that fades to a collar with a bit of dusting. The nose is full of earthy English hops, alongside some cinnamon spice and zesty caramel malts. The overall aromatic impression is one of dryness. On the palate, sweet caramel malts with an orange tinge give way to hop bitterness at the mid-palate and a dry finish. The hops are rather piney, but they also have a funk that fits in well with the malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a bit of alcoholic hotness, and brash-but-not-overdone hop oils. This is a fair interpretation of an ""double"" ESB -- hoppy and malty at the same time, but retaining drinkability. One of the better Rock Art brews."
"Poured out light brown with an inner glow, topped by a frothy off white head that dissolves into a thin film. Very minimal amount of lacing. Great nose, balanced if not particularly complex. Big hops and malt balance out and hide the alcohol well. The taste goes more towards the hops side on balance, herbal, but there is still good malt sweetness holding up the other end. Has a wonderfully crisp mouthfeel, finishing long and then clean."
"This came with a fluffy, light-tan head. The color was a very cloudy (unfiltered, I was told) deep-amber. The nose was rich with hops, accompanied by a lightly malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was medium, with a piney, sticky, resinous (hey, what am I reviewing here?) hop presence. This is the type of beer that will remind even a novice as to which family of plants from which the hop is derived. I was further told that you have to like Tomahawk hops, or you will be sucking wind before your first sip. The disclaimer on the bottle said it all. Yes, I had it on tap, but I also looked at the bottle. The finish was where the malt really came in. Tasty? Oh, yeah, for a hophead. More? Well, at 8% ABV, I had to go easy."
"Not extraordinary, but very good, and something I'd buy again. This is nice, since I've been underwhelmed by some of their other offerings, including Ridge Runner and the IPA. This beer will make be keep trying them."
"This is a fine hoppy beer and a steal at $3 for a 22-ounce bottle I bought in Waterbury, Vt."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy amber brew. Head holds acceptably, with coating lace. Aroma is nutty malt with a light piney hop note. Flavor shows the same ample nutty grains upfront, and balancing and more so hoppy bitterness to follow, with some citrus as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft, and drinkability is great. Nice one here from Rock Art, hope it becomes a more regular offering."
"Pours a clear eddish gold with a large white foamy head. It's a nice looking beer with good lacing and a lasting head. The taste is a malty hop bitter explosion. The intial sip is sweet malt then bitter hops with alcohol. A pretty good Bitter. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well making this a very good beer that should not be missed and one of Rock Art's better beers."
"I like this beer a lot. Try it if you get the chance."
"Pours cloudy with minimal head. Golden to light amber color. Highly carbonated. Very strong attractive aroma of malt and English hops. Very pleasant maltiness upon tasting that fades to a nice blend of malt, hops and alcohol. Doesn't taste 'extreme', despite its name. Doesn't knock my socks off but very drinkable. An 8% session ale??!"
"Mouthfeel is bready, medium bodied, yeasty, with floral, and spicy earth notes running along the palate."
"Wow! Pours an amber with a white headskie. Wow! So crisp, so smooth, so mouthsmacking good with all the salvation anyone would ever need to know about. This beer kinda just jumped out of the ground and said it was the new thing to drink in our land of Vermont. Yum! Yum! Yum!"
