1.42,-62.3,3,1,1,3,1.5,"I was surprised by this beer considering the great balance and flavor of Schlafly's Kolsch style ale (one of the best American Kolsch-styles I've tasted).  I've come to expect at least a touch of diacetyl in an ESB (and a bit more than a touch is acceptable in the style), but there is none here.  What IS in this brew is a huge mouthful of hops - way more hops than belong in any low gravity english style ale.    This is not an ESB; it's an an american ""IPA"" posturing with a fake accent.  If you tried to drink this beer at cellar temps, the hops would saturate your palate so you couldn't taste any malt at all.  That's not to say others won't like it.  If your idea of craft beer is yet another IPA, you'll probably like this, too.  Considering the shelves in my area are overflowing with IPA's, my opinion of this beer is almost definitely in the minority.","onansalad","Jan 26, 2015"

Taste is a well balanced caramel malt, with a nice zesty kick of spice, some piney hop is still there too. A pleasant light, creamy mouthfeel. A nice well balanced beer, I guess the spice is what makes it a Winter ESB, as it is summer, and I enjoyed this thoroughly.","bhalter8","Apr 25, 2009"

Taste is kind of bitter but won't turn you away from this beer and has a sweet taste to it as well. Not very hoppy but you can taste them sneaking out a bit. Really don't know what to say about the taste of this one, but all I can say is it's not bad at all. Like most Schlafly beers I've had it's not amazing but it's not bad or even average, it's good and worth trying.

The flavor profile is not nearly as bitter as I had expected,nor that flavorful either. It is good and not offensive in any manor of the word,I just expected something a little bolder in flavor. Subtle caramel and rye offset one another in a sweet and salty sort of way. Not a lot of hop,but just a touch of citrus keeps this interesting.An odd subtle spinach tang on the finish is unique and enjoyable,something I've never tasted before in a beer.

The taste starts with a mild malt flavor, with a touch of sweetness. Then halfway across the palate, a mild citrus bitterness takes over, but does not overwhelm the palate. A medium bodied feel at the start, and gains weight as it crosses the palate, finishing much heavier than one would expect.

Medium carbonation supports the light medium body. Taste is ruled by a floral hop bitterness that is complimented by toasty toffee maltiness, some citrus, and a welcome bite of spicy rye. Nice!

I was waiting for a hoptastic, rye-filled experience that never really materialized. Adding twice as many hops and twice as much rye would be a great place to start and would turn this beer into something to be reckoned with. Thanks jpm30.","BuckeyeNation","Jan 07, 2007"

3.82,1.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Good beer. Better than most American attemps at this English classic style. The beer begins with moderate, yet pronounced bready, malty-sweet, lightly syrup aromas and flavors. Soon followed up with a light nutty character; soon giving way to solid, but not over-bearing piney hops. Hops offset the malts well, while contributing a defined bitterness that cleanses the palate and contributes a light dryness. Though moderate flavors, the body seems to fall apart a little too quickly, leaving a sticky feel and a 'cola-like' finish. Though a bit less than clean in the end, its certainly a beer worth trying.","BEERchitect","Dec 10, 2006"

3.68,-2.4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This ESB poured a clear, light copper color with creamy foam with a hint of yellow that persisted and clung to the glass. There was good carbonation. The smell was hoppy and biscuity malty. The taste was good and hoppy with a touch of grain in the malt flavors and a hint of tangy sweetness, almost like a lager. The mouthfeel was a bit coarse with medium body and good carbonation. The moderate hoppiness persisted in the finish together with a light biscuity malt. This was a decently drinkable ESB, though not as good in the bottle as on-tap.","UncleJimbo","Jun 12, 2006"
3.38,-10.3,4,3.5,3,3,4,"12 oz bottle pured into an Imperial pint glass. Massive chunky off white head. Had to wait a moment for the head to go down to finish the pour. Head receded to a light lace. Clear amber color. Sweet malt smell with a bit of hops bitterness. Taste is mildly bitter, mostly in the back. A little floral. Mouthfeel is very mild. No real carbonation bite, more of a creaminess. This is a nicely refreshing beer. It doesn't really seem like a winter beer to me though.","bort11","May 12, 2006"
3.63,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer makes the grade a nice amber hue from the bottle with an off white head that caps the beer and a thin lace that follows the beer all the way down the glass. The smell is faint a bit metallic sugary plums, sweet brown sugar/cocoa. An interesting aroma for this beer. The taste still has the powdery sweet malt flavoring the copper metallic is still present in the aftertaste but there is an endearing presence of full malts and some light hops. The finish is where this one dissapoints....there is nothing there watery and bland the finish is distant. This one is decent at best. My first from Schlafly....it is enough to keep me coming back...The age has to be a factor here...cellared at around 65 degrees and subject to constantc light I am sure that it had been on the shelf for a while. If I could find more Schlafly in NE. I would definately drink more Schlafly in NE.","hoffman","Jan 11, 2006"
4.05,7.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"It's probably a little heavy on the rye to make it a quaffer, but then, it is a winter beer, meant to be sipped on cold nights. For what it is, it would seem to work perfectly. While I couldn't kill a sixer in a sitting, I'd pony up for this one again. Another good beer from Schlafly.","jokelahoma","Jan 10, 2006"
3.97,5.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours an amber color with some ruby and golden hues. Fluffy cream colored lasting head that rises 1/4 "". Smell is a nice balance of hops and sweetness. Taste is very balanced the hops nor malts are overpowering. It's sweet yet nicely bitter. Feels good in the mouth. It's a very filling beer. The most drinkable ESB I've had.

As far as ESB's go, this is among the better ones I've had. The mouthfeel is lacking any harshness. The drinkability is good as well with one exception. This is the last one I got.

The aroma is mostly malt in the form of caramel and just a little apple. The flavor is light caramel, apple, and just a little tangy citrus to wake up the flavor. The mouth feel is slightly slick, but rich, and it is very drinkable. Nice interpretation of this style.","carln26","Jan 31, 2005"

Seemed very dry with a strong hop bite - the orange / vanilla spices still pulled through in both the taste and aroma. The hop bite eased on the next few, and the drinkablity increased dramatically. Another fine frosty from Schlafly (maybe Im a little jaded since Im in the STL area).","Vancer","Beers"

4.11,9,3,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Reviewed from notes taken on 1/12/05 from a 12oz bottle dated 10/27/04. Appears a fairly clear copper with about a half-inch of cream colored lace. Head dies down quickly leave minimal scatterings of lace. Aroma is full of sweet caramel malt and a good dose of earthy hops. Notes of pine and grain, probably the rye, mingle about. Quite a great smelling ESB. Sweet caramel malt gets the taste started before the hoppiness kicks in. Great bitter floral and earthy notes help tame the malt here. Citric notes are present as is the rye flavor. Ends with a bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy, overall a lot better than expected. For the style I cant think of one I have enjoyed this much. Very good stuff you should give a try, thanks nogoodreason for this treat.","meathookjones","Feb 16, 2004"
4,6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Medium copper with a soft, light tan head. Good hop aromas with some mild malts sneaking in. Good and bitter palate, with malt and hops offering great balance. Rich mouthfeel.

Aroma is mostly floral hops, some sweet malt, and some honey. Flavor is hoppy, a bit tart and tingly. Some light malts shine through, followed by a citrusy pine finish, tinged with alcohol warmth. Bitter piney hops linger. Thanks to MJR for sharing.","far333","Oct 26, 2003"
4.02,6.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"A dull orange hue, with a huge two-finger head, incredible retentiont! A malty and sweet aroma, some hops and fresh fruit detection, reminding me more of an APA. Up front, the sweet malts are followed by a definite hop presence. An underlying bitterness, with each sip. The Schlafly malts are brilliant as she warms, in fact, this brew is overall better as she warms; a tender dry hop finish. Questionable style, but another superb product from the folks right down the road, a beer to be added to the winter list for sure!","GeoffRizzo","May 22, 2003"
3.5,-7.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As it sets in the glass a deep and limpid amber color with a portly head that is frothy in consistency and light tan in color, after depletion the lace is a fine sheet. Nose is malt sweet, fresh and pleasant to the schnozzle; start is overly sweet, full of malt and the top medium in feel. Finish has a crisp acidity and the hops spicy in their bite; also you get a hint of the rye bitterness in the aftertaste, a good drinking beer.","Gusler","Apr 14, 2003"

Lots of flavor, but quite drinkable.","jcalabre","Jan 23, 2003"
3.32,-11.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Nose is intense sharp hops and it shines through on the palate. Syruppy, sharp hoppyness, and a bit one dimensional, not really elegant or rounded or anything, just a bunch of phat, syruppy, cloying hops that kick you in the face. Let down by the lack of balance and complexity, there is lots of flavour there, but its a bit ugly, not too bad though.","rastaman","Jan 13, 2003"
3.81,1.1,4.5,3.5,4,3,4,"A lingering sticky cream-colored head tops a clear, bright deep amber body. The aroma is mellow malts, toffee and maple. The Hops offer up a slightly piney character. The flavor is sweet but not cloying. Reminds me of toast or biscuits with maple syrup or maybe just pancakes. The bittering hops balance the beer nicely. This is a great well-made beer but doesn't provide the chewy maltiness of the Fuller's.","aracauna","Dec 12, 2002"
