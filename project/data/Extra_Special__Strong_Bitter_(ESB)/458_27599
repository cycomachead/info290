I really like the idea, though, of making an ESB that's thick and sugary. I guess that's what makes it ""double.""

It's got something of the ""imported English-y"" character, but I would expect a fresher/domestically produced beer to taste... well... fresher. It's certainly a good beer, and I hate to knock it, but it seems like (from my perspective) they are attempting to mimic the ""spent three months in an unrefrigerated cargo container"" flavor common to most import beers- I'm sure it comes down to customer expectations. That being said, it's very reasonably priced, pretty darn good, and I'll certainly pick it up again.","Lawl3ss","Jun 20, 2012"

2.73,-27.4,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"The extra X means this stuff means business. It pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises toffee and grass. That is all. The taste holds notes of caramel, burnt grass, musty wheat, and a kinda meek snap of orange-peel bitterness. Ask m'lady sitting next to me while drinking this: my face went negative pretty quickly after this stuff was put on my tongue. Now, I don't wanna exaggerate: It wasn't god-awful, just unpleasant. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somehow nearly chewy feel. Overall, I did not have a good experience with this beer. The flavors seemed rather sideways, and everything was just too...I guess big would be the word here.","TMoney2591","Jun 26, 2011"

Big dose of crystal malt in the nose, fruity, tropical hops, some bready malts for dryness. Taste mirrors nose, though the alcohol is quite prevalent. Medium-light mouthfeel, fairly dry finish for style. Too boozy for the style and my liking, unless you are a fan of Double ESBs (not sure if such a style exists or will in the future) a novelty worth trying once, but I won't be having this again any time soon.","jdense","Beers"

3.77,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Found this at the Whole Foods here in Austin whilst visiting on business. Pours a clear dark copper/amber with a thin creamy head that left sparse lacing. To all appearance a classic English bitter. The aroma is caramel and sweet malt with a whiff of alcohol. The taste is quite unexpected the blast of hops seems to utterly overwhelm whatever malty notes one would expect based upon the aroma. The taste is cracker up front with a strong floral/vegetal hop bitterness that fades into a long dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with gentle carbonation that is barely noticable. Overall a good find and a nice way to round out the night.","Citadel82","Mar 20, 2011"

In the smell there is a grapefruit bitterness along with some slightly toasted caramel malts to sweeten it up a bit. Ends pretty clean with nothing lingering. Taste is sweeter than the nose suggest. There is still the grapefruit bitterness but the toasty caramel notes come through a lot more with even more sweetness. Taste almost like an America Strong Ale just with a more toasted quality. Mouth feel is medium to full bodied with medium to high carbonation. Its a little up there but not quite. Feels good though. Not bad. Good flavors however pretty strong and with a substantial amount of alcohol. This is one that I will be picking up again next year.","depechemode1983","Mar 17, 2011"

The flavor has a little more depth with the strong caramel malt sweetness gaining balance from a dry graininess and toasty malt. The alcohol is pretty well-hidden. Not a whole lot going on here. Medium-bodied with a creamy texture. Finish is moderately sweet with only a hint of alcohol warming. Lack of complexity or anything really interesting keeps this from a high drinkability score.

Copper in color, with about a half inch of white heading, this looks like a rustic type. Nice hop profile comes through in the nose, along with some sweet grains and light fruit. The malt is more forward in the taste, and steps forward to overpower the hops a bit. Besides that, there is some good biscuit like flavors, and a bit of pear too. Mouthfeel is on the medium side, and really does not taste boozy at all.

Grassy and citric, as lime peel and wheatgrass juice come to mind. There are some chalky, mineral flavors as well as a light fruitiness that give it a bit of British feel to it, but the hops seem to be copiously added in true American spirit. The bitterness on the finish is particularly bold...resinous and long-lasting. A bit over-the-top compared to most ESBs, but I guess that what they were aiming for with the 'double'.

3.75,-0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"decently balanced big esb. give it a try","jasonjlewis","Feb 25, 2009"
3.56,-5.3,5,4,3,4,3.5,"Pours a medium brown colored body, clearish with a big creamy off-white head. Hoppy grapefruity aroma, very bitter and dry smelling. Creamy, hoppy bitter dry taste. Some strawberry maltiness too. Letting it warm up a bit for some more flavor...Some more flavor. Not too bad. Much more flavor. No aftertaste, it just fades.","jujubeast6000","Apr 18, 2008"
4.28,13.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A very good ESB in my opinion and something I'd order several pints of in an evening.","omnigrits","Mar 24, 2008"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, exactly as advertised. An ESB with more malt and hops but still within the style. Real Ale, you've made another excellent beer.","JonathanL7890","Mar 13, 2008"
3.7,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3,4,"On tap at the draught house. Pours a dark maroon color with a medium beige lasting head. Nice looking beer. Smell is fruity, hoppy, gummy, with big hop presence for the style. Not what I expected from something called an ESB or labeled as an ESA. Either way, extremely drinkable, fruity and hoppy but smooth with alcohol hidden well. Very nice beer.","JDV","May 09, 2007"
3.95,5.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I went to the brewery and tried all the beers. This one stuck out the most from my trip. It had a wonderful hop infused taste. It wasn't hoppy enough to blow my socks off, but the blend of hops and amber malts was great. The aroma had a hop and carmel smell. Overall, I would not hesitate to buy the Phoenix again or order it at a pub. I even bought a T-shirt of the beer after the tour!","Norsebrew","Jan 23, 2007"
3.41,-9.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not impressed at the start, but it improved considerably as the temperature increased. Nice balance, would drink again.","","Sep 27, 2006"
4.12,9.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours an orange copper color with a creamy white head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is dominated by fresh grassy hops along with a bit of a sweet nuttiness. Taste begins with some toasted malts, but the hops are the key players. However, the hops present themselves in a very earthy mannermore so than in just about any beer I can remember trying. This beer definitely improves as it warmsin fact, near room-temperature is ideal.","Morris729","Beers"

3.46,-8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Had this one on tap at the Flying Saucer in Fort Worth. Poured a murky brown into a 22 oz glass with a tenacious 1.5 finger head. The aroma was mainly of the hops, with some undertones of hazelnut and caramel. Taste was nice and bitter, heavy on the hops, with a malty toffee-like sweetness balancing the bitter, floral hops. There was some hint of a roasted-nut twinge to it. Mouthfeel was a bit phenolic, with a little bit of bite from the alcohol. Drinkability was average, meaning that it was worth a try, but not worth another round.","kosmoraios","Jan 17, 2006"
3.18,-15.4,4,3.5,3,4,2.5,"Mouthfeel is medium, clean with a bitter hop aftertaste. Good, if you like this style, but too dry to really session and strays far from a traditional ESB drinkability. Labeled as a ""Double ESB," whatever that may mean.","assurbanipaul","Jan 06, 2006"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Served on-tap at the Addison Flying Saucer. Dark copper pour with a sturdy beige head that lasted throughout the pint and left a little lace. Smell is light hops with a smidge of sugars and alcohol peeking through. Starts off malty and goes right into a gentle hop bitterness that lasts through a sufficiently extended finish. Medium body and a very drinkable ESB. One of the few of this style that I would gladly return to. This has some character.","pentathlete","Dec 30, 2005"
3,-20.2,3,3,3,3,3,"The lastest offering from Real Ale and a new selection on-tap at the Gingerman in Houston. Not sure what a ""Double"" ESB is. It was an amber colour in the glass and rather cloudy. Thick, sandy coloured head that lasted a long a long time and left a lot of lacing in the glass. Aroma was light, but grassy and floral. The flavour was very earthy, it reminded me of wet cork. The finish was dry and bitter, but those earthy tones carried over into a lingering aftertaste.","Xadoor","Beers"
3.8,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This is one for hopheads that aren't too concerned about balance between the hops and the malt. The bitterness overtakes the beer, but it is satisfying, nonetheless. The grassy and floral characteristics carry through from the first sip and into the long finish.","TPoling","0"
