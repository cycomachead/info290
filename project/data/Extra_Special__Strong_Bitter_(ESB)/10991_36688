Hints of citrus are hiding, overall smell leans toward bready side. Right off the bat this tastes boozy. It's not at 6.0 ABV, but somehow it feels more. This is very different beer then most pale ales I've had. It's darker than most pale ales as well, Three Floyd's Alpha King shares the darkness. It's a lot heavier to drink than it should be, but this brew just has a special place in my heart.","screamking","0"

Not overly sweet like basically all of the other offerings. Just a touch of hops with biscuit, caramel malts. I actually had no idea this was a Pale Ale when I tried it. Mouthfeel is medium with a light-medium carbonation. Overall, I did say this was my favorite, but this is not a great beer by any means. Not sure why they feel like these beers need to be so sweet. This is not like most Pale Ales that I have had. Style is either wrong or brewed poorly.","seeswo","May 21, 2011"

2.4,-34.2,3.5,3.5,2,1.5,2,"Appears a clear copper hue with a light off white khaki head. Forms fine speckled lacing evenly up the sides of my glass. Aroma is very tame with a mild herbal/citric hop accent and light caramel maltiness. Flavor is dominated by sticky sweet carmamelized sugars that simply coat the palate in a very much ovebearingly unbalanced way. The hop bite really doesn't make it across because of the extent of the sweetness of the sticky sweet caramelized malts, maybe in the back end there's a touch of herbal citric hop character but nothing pungently bitter. Mouthfeel may be the worst part it almosts gags me to gulp this down very harsh sticky unrefined caramelized malts on the palate make the whole experience unbearable. Overall this is a really mediocre example of an APA and I question that style branding for a beer called Over the Rhine.","WVbeergeek","May 01, 2011"

I can now see the rising bubbles reach the surface and pop. The aroma is sweet and oak-like. There is also an aspect to it that reminds me of cookie dough. The beer is light and malty at first, with a big sweet, finish. It reminds me of melted chocolate chips. I'm not sure the beer is supposed to taste like this...I'm afraid the bottle may have turned. The beer has a lighter body and an average amount of carbonation. There is a little bit of coating, but nothing significant.

I guess I'm probably pushing the limits on the the freshness of this bottle (as spring-releases are probably released in the winter), so I could expect the hops to fade.

The dominant taste was the malty flavor, which was bready, buttery, and sweet. And there was a hop presence as well, which had piney and citrus taste to is, and left a pinch of bitterness in the aftertaste (along with a spicey linger).

The bitterness is not sharp but earthy. Not much cascade like taste as anticipated from the smell. Very different. I don't really think it is balanced as they state, it is more complex.

The sweet malty nose carries this brew onto the palate, where the full-bodied malt is joined and balanced by a complex hoppy note that carries all the way beyond the finish into a pleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is exceptional -- unusually thick (almost jammy) and smooth for an APA. It is a nice beer in warmer weather, but will be even more drinkable in those early autumn days when the warming character of it's 6% ABV and somewhat higher gravity would perfectly balance its modestly carbonated hoppy overtones.

Flavor prove that maltiness prevails, but with a crisp (Northern Brewer) hop flavor, which proved to be very fresh and palate cleansing. The beer's flavor never reached compexity, but stays pure, clean, and crisp. Nothing to fault here. Only a mild astringency could play a part in lower ratings.

I love drinking ales, and I really loved drinking this one. The taste was so smooth, a nice balance. A treat I hope all will be able to enjoy.","Gator1107","May 11, 2007"
4.06,11.2,5,4,3.5,5,4.5,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Creamy and full bodied, they don't get much better than this. Carbonation is in check, lower levels with finer bubbles don't get in the way of the flavor and feel of this brew. This is a brew I'd definitely buy again, however, I'm always looking for something new so it might be awhile.","becktone","May 07, 2007"

Not quite as hoppy, but a little maltier and considerably darker than I imagined it would be, it's probably my new favorite pale ale. A nice addition to the Christian Moerlein line.","schwabpg","May 05, 2007"

It was very malty in my opinion and that is a good thing. It has a nice aroma and a lasting aftertaste. My wife did not like it much but what does she know abour beer anyway hehe. Overall, a welcome beer to the Christian Moerlein stable.","pumarocks","Beers"

Impressive offering from CM, their 'craftiest' beer yet, the folks at Oktoberfest will love this in the fall.","brewdlyhooked13","0"
