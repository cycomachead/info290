"I was surprised by this beer considering the great balance and flavor of Schlafly's Kolsch style ale (one of the best American Kolsch-styles I've tasted).  I've come to expect at least a touch of diacetyl in an ESB (and a bit more than a touch is acceptable in the style), but there is none here.  What IS in this brew is a huge mouthful of hops - way more hops than belong in any low gravity english style ale.    This is not an ESB; it's an an american ""IPA"" posturing with a fake accent.  If you tried to drink this beer at cellar temps, the hops would saturate your palate so you couldn't taste any malt at all.  That's not to say others won't like it.  If your idea of craft beer is yet another IPA, you'll probably like this, too.  Considering the shelves in my area are overflowing with IPA's, my opinion of this beer is almost definitely in the minority."

"This was a very pleasant surprise! The flavor is different than anything I've tasted before. Best way I can describe this excellent ESB is: crisp with light fruit aromas and floral apricot finish."
"Overall: slightly lighter, more fruity than most ESBs with a lighter roasted malt flavor. Very drinkable and nice, but not really a typical ESB."
" 5.8% abv."
"This is apparently an Americanized version of this style. I will say this is the only brew of this style that I have had but I would bet a weeks pay that I would find a better one pretty easily."
"Not into this one very much at all. I have had better esbs"
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent ESB and great for the price. I really do recommend getting his beer at least once just to contrast with the Fuller's ESB."
""
"I remember this beer being a lot more bitter last year and having a much better overall flavor.  I'm not sure if they changed up the recipe or what but it was definitely better last year.  Not much flavor, disappointed."

"O: An interesting ESB. The mixture of American and British hops in this ale is pretty unique. I especially appreciate what Pilgrim brings to the table. This is very much worth a try for those who enjoy British-style ales and/or unique hop varietals."
"O: This winter ESB Schlafly Winter ESB is lighter than your average Winter Warmer, providing another good choice for the holidays. If found it to be enjoyable on a hot Spring day as well."
""
""
"Overall, this one just doesn't do it for me. Too much fruit and overly sticky make this a bit of a mess. Drinkability is very limited and it just doesn't seem that well put together. I'll pass next time."
""
""
""
""

"Light brown hued with a good half inch head of khaki colored foam. Brussels lacing. I get a bit of biscuity malt and faint pine like hops in the nose. I get some dark malt on the front of the palate and it is quickly followed by sharp bittering hops. I get a bit of a dry chalky mouth. I get more hops and a copper penny like malt fade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The level of fruity flavor really caught me off guard. Was expecting a maltier beer but the fruit flavors were rather nice."
""
"Overall: I don't think I'd buy this personally, but then again, I'm not really into highly-hopped beers. This one was very drinkable, just not really my cup of tea."
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty decent and quite drinkable. Seems to the fit the style well."
"O- not a terrible beer, in and of itself, but lacking in the malt richness of a traditional ESB."
""
""
""
""

"I love ESBs and most “winter beers” in general. This sounds and looks great. I was really looking forward to trying this. I’m from Missouri and I like to support the locals. BUT…. This is Awful, syrupy sweet and undrinkable for me. It seems purposely aggressively flavored to cover up any redeeming qualities. It reminds me of their Christmas Ale. They are both way too flavored and they both taste like how a cheap Christmas candle smells."
""
"I’m a schalfly fan boy, but  have to say, this was disappointing.  A rich translucent brown with a thin cap, this beers smells sweet and bready.  The flavor is somewhat off….there is almost a buttery characteristic to this beer midpalate that I can’t seem to shake.  Sweeness starts, but the buttery note cuts right through.  Finish is caramel with a touch of hop bitterness, but the butteriness just lingers forever.  Can’t say I’d pick this up again. "

"Overall, I just love this beer. Lots of variety in the palate, and not overloaded. Still a good ESB regardless of the month. Maybe my favorite Schlafly offering ever."

"This is an all around well crafted beer. It has a rich doughy character with a bright fruity side as well. I would enjoy this anytime of the year."
""
"This beer is labeled at an extra special bitter, but it is actually quite well balanced for the style. It also is not what I would expect in any beer that claims to be a winter seasonal. The taste is not spicy like other winter brews and it is actually more indicative of an everyday session type of beer. So, this is one of those beers that demands you leave your preconceived notions behind. It isn’t what you think it will be, but the results are still satisfying."
""
"O- A nice brew. The aroma was probably the highlight for me. It was a smooth beer that was easy to drink. Would be nice to put a few glasses of these back while hanging with good company at a pub. It gets the job done for sure. Nothing i would insist other must try, but i wouldn't mind drinking again."
""
"Overall- This is a tasty beer. It's not not what I expected from this style, but it is still a good brew."
"This ESB poures from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poures a hazy golden color, produced a average white head, decent retention and it left behind a very nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma of the ale contains malted grain and caramel. Medium bodied, foundation of malted grain, sweet caramel and citrus/herbal bitterness. Well balanced in my opinion, a nice session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was a perfect winter variety. Cinnamon and nutmeg with a sweet malt backdrop the taste was well placed and well balanced. Very nice subtle tones this drank easy with little heaviness in the finish."

"O - A tasty brew but the flavor didn't quite match up to the aroma. Would definitely get again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: malt forward for the style by my tastes and definitely full flavored whereas many of these are watery."
""
""
""
""

"Poured from cask into nonic pint at the taproom in stl. Pours a murky burnt orange with thick white foamy head. Really sweet malt and lots of hop aroma. Taste is citrusy hop with sweet malts. Bready and mild. Smooth as silk. Really great brew and im sure cask makes this a bit smoother than bottle."

"O: A very enjoyable beer, and a nice representative of the ESB style. I'll be picking this up again next winter as it is readily available locally."
""
""
"This pours a hazy golden color with not much head. Some lacing is on the glass. Some visibility through the pour. Smells of lemons, soap, some hops as well as floral notes. Not overpowering but enjoyable. Taste is pretty smooth. Nice hop presence with lemons and doughs up front. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with mediocre carbonation from the tap. Overall this is a decent brew. Definitely sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nice and malty with some sweetness. Also some kind of a blend between orange and dark fruit for lack of better words. Very crisp and refreshing. A nice beer and very easy to drink."
""
""
"Very delicious overall. The breadiness, fruitiness, earthy hoppiness and touch of booze near the end make this seem, to me, pretty damn spot-on for the style."
""
"Pours a moderate caramel-copper color with a good white head and some nice lacing on the way down. The nose carries a nice bit of floral and earthy hops with some light breadiness behind that. Flavor was nice and hoppy and had a good backbone, though the latter wasn't too heavy. Light-medium body with a semi-dry finish. Quite good."
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer does match it's style well. The only problem is that I am not a big fan of the style, at least in the ESB's I have drank so far. I thought the fruit flavor was a little overpowering, although I am sure some find this to be a redeeming quality. Enjoy it for what it's worth, it's not bad."
""
"All in all, solid microbrew. Think I'll have another."
""
""
""
"Overall- With this beer, it is good that the flavors are the most impressive part. It makes for a much more enjoyable experience."
"M - thin to medium body with good drinkability. They hit the right level of carbonation for this brew too."
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good brew, one of many from this fine brewer."
""
"Overall I actually really like this, but it's sort of not what I expect in this style. It's an excellent beer no question and I'll have it again someday."
""
""
""
"Again, this is a very drinkable brew. Just not quite hearty enough for me. More like a summer drink as i could see myself drinking four or five of these pretty easily. 6.2% abv is a bit deceptive. I'd have guessed 5% or less."
""
""
"I will get definitely get pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is light to medium in body, mildly sweet, a little spice perhaps, mild hops, not bitter at all, an interesting little beer, I may have it again but I won't go far for it."
""
""
""
"color is hazy, orange to amber, minimal head, white foam; very light mild aroma bread, citrus, dough; complex taste light sweetness, medium bitterness, lightly sour; light to medium body, thin feel, creamy, soft carbonation, bitter, long finish, excellent on the palate with lots of flavor in the finish. This beer gets better with warmth."
"Body is light and crispy with plenty of tangy carbonation. Easy to drink, leaves you wanting another."
"amber in color with a smooth, even, head of white on top that faded off after a couple of moments. Light lacing was left by the side. Aroma is bready, hints of caramel and grassy notes and warming brought out tons of grains. Light, crisp and clean taste, light grassy hops and a smooth even caramel malt base made up the bulk of the profile. Light body, nice carbonation and a smooth even and clean finish"
"Medium mouthfeel and very enjoyable. Another great beer from Schlafly."
"D- Very drinkable , each sip brings something new either malty, sweet, or bitter."
"Drinkability - This is a nice little beer I think. Easily drinkable and solid. I could handle a few of these with ease. Like most, this brew really shows its characteristics after it warms a bit. Could be enjoyed both in the Fall and in the Winter."
"Drinkability- Once again, wondering why this is a Winter ESB Ale? It should be their Pale Ale and I would drink this weekly! Such a great beer. I split all six with a friend in two hours and will have again at the Wolf Public House in Ballwin, MO."
"D - Great ESB. The rye comes through nicely and spices it up almost perfectly."
"Make this your first if you are going to try a large hop beer at the same sitting."
"D: A very nice beer, it sort of works as a ""winter"" beer. Not huge like a RIS, but feels very season appropriate if you are in the mood for a pale ale. Definitely worth trying."
"An enjoyable winter ale. I don't really see how this is an ESB, but it is still good. This reminds me of New Belgium 2° Below with the cinnamon and vanilla. Which is a good thing, but not really to style. Still I really enjoy it, and something I would recommend."
"Overall/notes: The brew is well constructed, and pretty much straightforward. It's far from my favorite Schlafly beer, though. The tartness of the whole drink was really surprising. It felt kind of rough around the edges, but it's still appealing enough for me to go through a couple without complaining... Which is exactly what I did."
"This brew feels medium in body, and has a good smooth crispness. Very satisfying to the palate, which is left refreshed."
"Poured from the bottle a coppery amber hue with a tight white rocky head that subsided into lacing for much of the beer.The smell was dominated by the smell of wet sweet malt and a small amount of floral hops. Taste is dominated by the sweet malt and to be honest there isn't as much hop as I was expecting for the ESB from Schlafly. Mouthfeel is smooth and quite not overly carbonated a tad on the slick side. Drinkability is very good for this beer it is a very easily sessionable beer."
"Beer pours a reddish-copper color with a decent head that fades to lacing It has a pleasant grain aroma mixed with light caramel. Taste is slightly sweet with just enough bitterness. It has a medium body with a dry finish. This is a well balanced brew that does not overpower. It goes down very smooth and is easy to have more than one without even thinking about it"
"Would get this again to try fresher, but not bad even with the age."
"Drinkability is high with this one due to the drying effect it has as well as the conservative amount of hops. Quite an impressive ale with lots of interesting flavors going on. Very refreshing during the winter months (or any time of year for that matter.) Well done!"
"Drinkability: More of a Winter Warmer than an ESB; I might have rated it higher as a Winter Warmer but I was really looking for the bitter balance of an ESB that just wasn't there"
"Overall, an unoffensive and fairly easy drinking beer. Not my favorite ESB however, and I would have hoped for more in the flavor. Nonetheless, nothing really off about this one."
"D: Drinkability is good for this beer. Good flavor with a dry ending that makes you want to keep drinking more."
"Overall, this is a highly drinkable beer and a good way to warm up with friends on a winter night."
"Mouthfeel, begins to take on tobacco notes with the dark, almost doppelbock light feel to it. Remains drinkable, doesn't overwhelm the palate with a negative heavy effect."
"Thanks to Rob for bringing this up from St. Lous. I am not normally an ESB fan but this is an easy to drink beer and have good things from this brewery."
"This was nice and fairly straightforward. Would buy again."
"Overall, a really easy drinker from Schlafly. Good complexity with a good balance."
"D - Higher than some other ESB."
"I could drink this all day long. Glad that my timing was right to catch it on cask."
"drinkability is good - while not very bitter this beer is very tasty"
"The aroma is very mild with hints of caramel and toffee. Maybe some hops. It has a hazy brown body with lots of tiny bubbles and sediment. It had a rocky head at first that settled nicely and quickly. Overall, I would say this is a mediocre beer. It has a bitter taste that is more in the aftertaste than the primary flavoring. Nice malt flavor with some spiciness! The mouthfeel is smooth and pretty slick."
"Pours a copper color with a slight haze to it (I know its not carbonation I see in there). About a one finger foamy, white head that leaves a bit of lacing around the glass. The nose is rather faint, hops may have faded a bit, as all I am left with is a bit of spice and malt. Taste is a well balanced caramel malt, with a nice zesty kick of spice, some piney hop is still there too. A pleasant light, creamy mouthfeel. A nice well balanced beer, I guess the spice is what makes it a Winter ESB, as it is summer, and I enjoyed this thoroughly."
"Appearance is a orange/really light copper color and has a nice white head that has nice retention. Leaves lots of lacing down the glass. I can't quite put my finger on what the smell is. At first I wasn't impressed but after smelling it a few more times it smells not bad. Hint of spices, kind of bready? Taste is kind of bitter but won't turn you away from this beer and has a sweet taste to it as well. Not very hoppy but you can taste them sneaking out a bit. Really don't know what to say about the taste of this one, but all I can say is it's not bad at all. Like most Schlafly beers I've had it's not amazing but it's not bad or even average, it's good and worth trying. Also bottled on date was 8 months ago, don't know how well this ages but I would like to have tried it more fresh. None the less I still enjoyed it."
"Taste is similar to most bitters, but the rye element adds a little something. Like all bitters, I could drink and enjoy one, but no more than one in an evening."
"D: Quality across the board. From the first pour to the last sip this was an enjoyable beer to consume. I consider myself a fan of The Saint Louis Brewery, and this is one of my favorites from them. I particularly like the balance in the ingredients. At 6.2% it's a little strong to be considered a session beer, but the drinkability is certainly high. I look forward to picking these up every winter."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable and I definitely enjoyed the beer. Didn't discern any spices, but that may have faded over time. Good beer, but I also have trouble with ESB's because I really enjoy some Goose Island Harvest Ale."
"This beer was served a burnt orange/copper, slightly hazy. There is a nice pillowy white one finger head that retains well. Nice wispy lacing the whole way down. Nose is of sweet caramels, some roasted malts, and a bit of spice. Taste is fantastic. Malted backbone on this beer gives is a nice strong feel - pretty full bodied. There are definite spices and hops present. Slightly hoppier than I anticipated but was so well balanced with the malts! Mouthfeel is outstanding, smooth with a good kick, full bodied - perfect amount of carbonation. This is a great beer!"
"Overall, a solid, but kinda forgetful esb. As it warms, i get more of a fruitiness in it. A good one to try, and one i wouldnt mind having again, but i will not seek out for it, and would pick others ahead of it. Maybe the 4 months have worn out the hops in it, but i was just hoping for something just a little more hoppy."
"Conclusion: This reminds me of England and all those English beers (I was something of a novice and not a true BA at that time) that I couldn't remember the names of once I got home, but the impression of which I'll never forget. This beer is like a trip to a Yorkshire pub...classic English ESB...I know this is utter blasphemy, but I like it better than Fuller's by a wide margin"
"Pours a clear amber color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, grass, slight fruit, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of an Extra Special / Bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a low carbonation level. Bitterness in noticeable. Tastes of sweet malt up front, then strong grass flavors, then there are nice floral hops with a slight fruit finish. Overall, well balanced beer that was easy to drink and full on the palate."
"Easy to drink, to a fault."
"When I had this, I felt that it smelled and tasted somewhat like Schlafly's Kolsch, just a tad maltier and darker in color. I don't think that's too far off. I expected some spice and malt heft with the moniker ""Winter"" preceding ESB. The ESB part I get and it isn't bad. The Winter part mystifies and disappoints me. I'd beef up the malt and spice considerably. That would get it rocking. As it stands, it's just OK."
"D-Nice and easy to drink this is one i'll look forward to grabbing a 6 of at least once a year"
"mouth is medium and smooth, crisp. Highly drinkable, just a very enjoyable beer."
"drinkability: this is one of my stand-by session brews when available. i can easily put back a few and not get tired of it. too bad the abv isn't posted..."
"D_Very hoppy and flowery, slow drinker"
"Drinks easy enough, nice intro to the style"
"D: this beer is a great session beer. One can drink a few of these and not get tired of it. Very enjoyable."
"No fancy labels, no clever names, just good beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: To look at and smell its nothing special but once in the mouth its not bad."
"D - This is a decent ESB and very sessionable - another fine beer from Schlafly."
"Pours a bright copper with some light golden accents around the edge. The bone colored cap is light and fluffy and leaves some nice even lacing marking my pace with each sip. The nose is rye bread lightly toasted and buttery,with some light hoppy esters. The flavor profile is not nearly as bitter as I had expected,nor that flavorful either. It is good and not offensive in any manor of the word,I just expected something a little bolder in flavor. Subtle caramel and rye offset one another in a sweet and salty sort of way. Not a lot of hop,but just a touch of citrus keeps this interesting.An odd subtle spinach tang on the finish is unique and enjoyable,something I've never tasted before in a beer. The mouthfeel is velvety and course at the same time and is really where I think this deserves its highest marks. Not what I expected,yet very interesting and enjoyable."
"Definately a beer that can be imbibed on a regular basis, although I would hesitate to drink to many in one night based on the 6.2% ABV."
"Served in a standard pint glass out of a bottle. Temperature was a little warmer than fridge temp."
"Pours a clear red color body. Creamy white head, some lacing, lasting. Effervescent, malty aroma, some bitterness. Not a strong aroma. Grainy taste, sweet, with a sweet aftertaste. Fresh maybe rye-like. Watery palate. A nice hoppy taste. More like an IPA."
"D- Great session beer. I wish it was around all year long."
"Drinkability: A enjoyable, refreshing Winter ESB for the middle of summer."
"Poured a very nice amber/copper color with some wonderful head and excellent lacing. Excellent scent, very deep with both nice attributes of malt and hops, a little sweetness and a little bitterness. Great taste, a well made bitter, the initial flavor is a good hoppy (English style) bitter that finished fairly sweet. It goes down quite well."
"Pours a nice orangish color, mostly transparent with a lasting smallish offwhite head. Smell is fruity malt, sweet yet balanced and hearty nose. Taste is sweet and fruity flavor at first and then crisp, dry malt and light hoppiness to mostly balance. Very drinkable, mild and sessionable with a pleasant malt flavor and balanced well. Great session beer. Toasty, bittersweet, slightly tart."
"D- I always loved drinking this during cold St. Louis winters. It's not the same in the hot desert of southern california, but it does bring back friendly memories. A great drink, I'd have another anytime."
"D - very alluring ale, nice nod to the English flavor. I could enjoy one after another"
"Prosit, MK"
"Tasted on 3/9/08"
"This was a comfortable beer with a good marriage of the hops and malt. It is smooth and easy to drink but could sneak up on you at 6.2%."
"Poured a clear light orange yellowish color. Decent carbonation. Thin one finger egg shell white color head that dissipated rather quickly. No real solid retention. Smell was rather light and malty slight hint of rye in the back ground. Mile scent of hop oil and a slight citrus touch. Hints of dough and a mild fold of caramel. Decent taste. Upfront caramel malt flavor followed by a nice hint of rye with a strong dry hop finish. Leaves a nice hop essence in the back of the mouth. Rather light bodied but also makes up for that in the nice after taste. Over all a very drinkable brew."
"I expected a darker, more robust ESB as this was a ""winter"" ESB; but I was certainly not disappointed as this would make an excellent year round bitter. This brewery makes very solid beers."
"Thanks, Will!"
"D - An average ESB. It makes a nice session brew."
"12 ounce bottle. The beer pours an amber/orange color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like citrusy hops, toasted malt, honey and grain/bread. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of pine and butterscotch. Mouthfeel/body is medium, slightly creamy with medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, the beer is nice and smooth and easy to drink. It has a good mixture of bitter and sweet, and decent balance too. Overall I think this is a good all-around beer. I'd buy Schlafly products more often, too bad they don't distribute to Ohio yet."
"All in all, a good beer to have."
"A light amber color with slight signs of carbonation in the glass. a small white head forms, but quickly dissolves away. A cracked roasted fragrance of barley comes out at first. That is followed by bread and biscuity scents anf finishing off with light cirusy and pine fragrances. The taste starts with a mild malt flavor, with a touch of sweetness. Then halfway across the palate, a mild citrus bitterness takes over, but does not overwhelm the palate. A medium bodied feel at the start, and gains weight as it crosses the palate, finishing much heavier than one would expect. This is a very good beer, the aroma and flavor are strong qualities in a bitter. Which makes this an excellent selection as session beer."
"It isn't the most exciting brew, but it's really enjoyable and very drinkable. One of those that you could enjoy all night."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It is a drinkable ESB session-ale that would be enjoyable sitting by the fire or watching a bowl/playoff game."
"D - A very average and uninspired brew IMO. Nothing really wrong with that, but I don't really see why it's considered a Christmas beer."
"pours a light copper color with a medium sized head. has a hoppy scent to it with malt undertoes. taste is really damn good. has a pleasent mixture of bitterness as well as a sweet maltiness to it. easy to drink, mouthfeel is nice and full and drinkability is high, one of my favorite winter beers"
"12oz. Brown bottle poured into a shaker pint. Dark gold with a thick, white head. Fine bubbles. Lightly hopped aroma with some malt. Nice malty mouthfeel with a little caramel malt. A little tanginess from the rye. Subdued hop finish. Very easy drinking."
"I like this beer. It's very sessionable and quite enjoyable."
"D- This beer has some nice malt flavors but not much depth. This is a nice ESP that is very drinkable and there is no palate fatigue even after a few pints."
"D - Of the ones I've been able to sample from this brewery this is my favorite."
"Found a sixpack of this at a Schnuck's(St Louis based) grocery in Evansville. Bottled Dec 14 2006, according to a stamp on the label. Pours a lightly hazed amber body with a small offwhite head. Very good retention with some spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma is toasty malts, citrusy and floral hops, and a hint of spicy rye. Medium carbonation supports the light medium body. Taste is ruled by a floral hop bitterness that is complimented by toasty toffee maltiness, some citrus, and a welcome bite of spicy rye. Nice! Not exactly an English style ESB but very nicely done and highly drinkable."
"I'd definitely have this again, and several if possible...but evidently not until late fall. Bummer."
"This was a good beer, although I struggle to call it either a winter beer or a bitter."
"I'm not sure what makes Winter ESB a 'winter' ESB, other than the fact that it was brewed in late October and was released in time for the season. I was waiting for a hoptastic, rye-filled experience that never really materialized. Adding twice as many hops and twice as much rye would be a great place to start and would turn this beer into something to be reckoned with. Thanks jpm30."
"D: The bitter roastiness of this beer might prevent it from being an all-day drinker, but I could easily put back a few of these. Quite a nice beer."
"D: Could easily drink several of these."
"Good beer. Better than most American attemps at this English classic style. The beer begins with moderate, yet pronounced bready, malty-sweet, lightly syrup aromas and flavors. Soon followed up with a light nutty character; soon giving way to solid, but not over-bearing piney hops. Hops offset the malts well, while contributing a defined bitterness that cleanses the palate and contributes a light dryness. Though moderate flavors, the body seems to fall apart a little too quickly, leaving a sticky feel and a 'cola-like' finish. Though a bit less than clean in the end, its certainly a beer worth trying."
"Bottles with love on October 24, 2006."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with zesty carbonation. Smooth finish. I will return to this one."
"Thanks jpm30 for this wonderful example of an American ESB"
"*edit* as beer warms, taste of alcohol is definitely present. Still stick by my initial review."
"This ESB poured a clear, light copper color with creamy foam with a hint of yellow that persisted and clung to the glass. There was good carbonation. The smell was hoppy and biscuity malty. The taste was good and hoppy with a touch of grain in the malt flavors and a hint of tangy sweetness, almost like a lager. The mouthfeel was a bit coarse with medium body and good carbonation. The moderate hoppiness persisted in the finish together with a light biscuity malt. This was a decently drinkable ESB, though not as good in the bottle as on-tap."
"12 oz bottle pured into an Imperial pint glass. Massive chunky off white head. Had to wait a moment for the head to go down to finish the pour. Head receded to a light lace. Clear amber color. Sweet malt smell with a bit of hops bitterness. Taste is mildly bitter, mostly in the back. A little floral. Mouthfeel is very mild. No real carbonation bite, more of a creaminess. This is a nicely refreshing beer. It doesn't really seem like a winter beer to me though."
"This beer makes the grade a nice amber hue from the bottle with an off white head that caps the beer and a thin lace that follows the beer all the way down the glass. The smell is faint a bit metallic sugary plums, sweet brown sugar/cocoa. An interesting aroma for this beer. The taste still has the powdery sweet malt flavoring the copper metallic is still present in the aftertaste but there is an endearing presence of full malts and some light hops. The finish is where this one dissapoints....there is nothing there watery and bland the finish is distant. This one is decent at best. My first from Schlafly....it is enough to keep me coming back...The age has to be a factor here...cellared at around 65 degrees and subject to constantc light I am sure that it had been on the shelf for a while. If I could find more Schlafly in NE. I would definately drink more Schlafly in NE."
"It's probably a little heavy on the rye to make it a quaffer, but then, it is a winter beer, meant to be sipped on cold nights. For what it is, it would seem to work perfectly. While I couldn't kill a sixer in a sitting, I'd pony up for this one again. Another good beer from Schlafly."
"Pours an amber color with some ruby and golden hues. Fluffy cream colored lasting head that rises 1/4 "". Smell is a nice balance of hops and sweetness. Taste is very balanced the hops nor malts are overpowering. It's sweet yet nicely bitter. Feels good in the mouth. It's a very filling beer. The most drinkable ESB I've had. This is a fine offering from Schlafly, one of the best ESB's that I've had; and I have Dertbert to thank for it."
"Thanks for the ESB MarkJR."
"The beer poured with minimal head. The color is a light reddish amber. The smell is fairly bitter. The taste reveals hops. Lots of 'em. As far as ESB's go, this is among the better ones I've had. The mouthfeel is lacking any harshness. The drinkability is good as well with one exception. This is the last one I got. Without driving to St. Louis. I could drink more if they were more readilly available. I would like to explore this brewer better."
"Full bodied and smooth, very drinkable."
"Great alternative after being disappointed with the IPA. This beer is a very clear copper color with a fluffy off-white head. The aroma is mostly malt in the form of caramel and just a little apple. The flavor is light caramel, apple, and just a little tangy citrus to wake up the flavor. The mouth feel is slightly slick, but rich, and it is very drinkable. Nice interpretation of this style."
"Medium bodied. Mouthfeel medium. Although labeled as a Winter ESB ale makes a nice summer session beer as well."
"Number 1 of the six-pack was Bottled With Luv on 12/8/04. Very nice clear amber/orange pour with a good whitish head that left nice laces. Seemed very dry with a strong hop bite - the orange / vanilla spices still pulled through in both the taste and aroma. The hop bite eased on the next few, and the drinkablity increased dramatically. Another fine frosty from Schlafly (maybe Im a little jaded since Im in the STL area)."
"An excellent brew."
"Reviewed from notes taken on 1/12/05 from a 12oz bottle dated 10/27/04. Appears a fairly clear copper with about a half-inch of cream colored lace. Head dies down quickly leave minimal scatterings of lace. Aroma is full of sweet caramel malt and a good dose of earthy hops. Notes of pine and grain, probably the rye, mingle about. Quite a great smelling ESB. Sweet caramel malt gets the taste started before the hoppiness kicks in. Great bitter floral and earthy notes help tame the malt here. Citric notes are present as is the rye flavor. Ends with a bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy, overall a lot better than expected. For the style I cant think of one I have enjoyed this much. Very good stuff you should give a try, thanks nogoodreason for this treat."
"Medium copper with a soft, light tan head. Good hop aromas with some mild malts sneaking in. Good and bitter palate, with malt and hops offering great balance. Rich mouthfeel. On of my favorite Schlafly offerings; even better on tap than in bottles. A great berr, IMO. Try this one without hesitation."
"Drinkability is very high, great session beer. Bro-in-law and I polished of the growler VERY quickly and were fighting for the last pint."
"Thanks to winomark for this offering."
"Light apricot color with a thick and frothy head that sits atop the glass, and creates deep craters as it sloooowly sinks. It leaves foamy webs of lace around the glass. Aroma is mostly floral hops, some sweet malt, and some honey. Flavor is hoppy, a bit tart and tingly. Some light malts shine through, followed by a citrusy pine finish, tinged with alcohol warmth. Bitter piney hops linger. Thanks to MJR for sharing."
"A dull orange hue, with a huge two-finger head, incredible retentiont! A malty and sweet aroma, some hops and fresh fruit detection, reminding me more of an APA. Up front, the sweet malts are followed by a definite hop presence. An underlying bitterness, with each sip. The Schlafly malts are brilliant as she warms, in fact, this brew is overall better as she warms; a tender dry hop finish. Questionable style, but another superb product from the folks right down the road, a beer to be added to the winter list for sure!"
"As it sets in the glass a deep and limpid amber color with a portly head that is frothy in consistency and light tan in color, after depletion the lace is a fine sheet. Nose is malt sweet, fresh and pleasant to the schnozzle; start is overly sweet, full of malt and the top medium in feel. Finish has a crisp acidity and the hops spicy in their bite; also you get a hint of the rye bitterness in the aftertaste, a good drinking beer."
"Originally sampled 4 January 2003. Exquisite clear amber color w/ a long lasting off white head. Slightly sweet nose, the flavor begins malty & finishes w/ a nice balance of hops. This is an excellent ESB; it's a great example of the style. Lots of flavor, but quite drinkable."
"Nose is intense sharp hops and it shines through on the palate. Syruppy, sharp hoppyness, and a bit one dimensional, not really elegant or rounded or anything, just a bunch of phat, syruppy, cloying hops that kick you in the face. Let down by the lack of balance and complexity, there is lots of flavour there, but its a bit ugly, not too bad though."
"A lingering sticky cream-colored head tops a clear, bright deep amber body. The aroma is mellow malts, toffee and maple. The Hops offer up a slightly piney character. The flavor is sweet but not cloying. Reminds me of toast or biscuits with maple syrup or maybe just pancakes. The bittering hops balance the beer nicely. This is a great well-made beer but doesn't provide the chewy maltiness of the Fuller's."
"Pours a clear copper with a 2 finger off-white head. The smell consists of faint aromas of caramel and light roasted malts. The taste consists of diacetyl (but not too much), caramel, and citrusy hops. This is a light to medium bodied brew and finishes with a light dry hop. Not overly complex, but fairly tasty. Thanks to budgood1 for sending this brew! Cheers!"
"pours out a clear dark amber. a big fine foamed head leaves a great deal of lace. aroma of citrus hops and earthy, smoky caramel malts makes for a wonderful nose. full bodied. big tastes of malt and juicy hop... the touch of rye adding a nice complexity. finishes hoppy, leaving lots of juicy bitterness dancing in the mouth. this is a damn fine brew. balanced. unbelieveably drinkable. the level of hops pleasantly surprised me. a beer worth seeking out!"
"Man this is it, orange-amber color, fluffy white head that leaves a nice lasting lace. Sweet malt aroma, soft and creamy mouthfeel. Medium-Full bodied, very balanced with a taste of rye and caremel. The hops really stand out in the end. This is best one this brewery has to offer."
