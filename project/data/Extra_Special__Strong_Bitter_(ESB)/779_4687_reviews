"Pint bottle purchased from Lifesource Natural Grocer Salem OR $4.99 Dark amber coloured ale with a small,bubbly tan head. Great typical English malt and hop aromas. Hay,nuts,leafy and earthy very nice. Balanced taste..interesting and with a strong light chocolate finish. Great smooth mouthfeel. Good traditional ale...excellent stuff."

"I like this quite a bit, but I am a fan of the English styled brews. There are others that are better but the distribution here in the U.S. is pretty thin at the moment. This is one of the best available from my perspective."

"Great toffee, caramel malts with dark but easy drinking fruits. Banana also makes an appearance. Just delicious"

"Overall: one of the better beers I have had to date, and certainly one of the best English Bitters. Generally I find English Bitters way over-priced and pretty boring, but this one is full on flavour and a very decent price. An equivalent price of 24 x 330mL case for AU$55 (2014) is almost unheard of for something this good. Surely this must be an introductory price, as this is a new ale to Queensland..."

"I will likely pick up a couple more soon."

"O: Outstanding example of how great English bitters can be. Along with Fuller's ESB, this is one of my favorite examples."

"500ml bottle. BB 28/02/15. Batch A4044. Pours a deep, dark, ruby colour with a generous beige head. It looks very inviting. Stewed fruit, golden syrup and moderate hop aroma but it’s all very subtle and in no way overpowering. Hints of nuts. Light to medium sweetness is balanced by an earthy, medium bitterness which lingers. Medium body which finishes in a semi-dry manner. Decent enough but it didn’t quite knock my socks off."
"taste: dark fruit/fruit cake, candy, treacle/brown sugar, raisins, currents with slight vanilla bean and toffee and a touch of spice/pepper. rich malt and fruit cake combined - very tasty!"
""
"O - Not a bad beer ale but lacks a real punch to bring you back for more"
"O- nice bitter. Just like on tap, the warming abv and choppy bitterness puts this beer ahead of other bitters"

"I popped the cap and began with a heavy-handed pour that netted me two dense fingers of tawny head head with great retention, slowly falling to create some marvelous lacing. ADM Montagu nodded in approval as I directed the helmsman to bring us alee, starboard of those Dutch bastiges. Color was a deep amber with ruby highlights (SRM = > 17, < 22) and NE-quality clarity. Truth-in-advertising time! The nose was, indeed, quite malty and fruity and the descriptor of ""fruitcake"" definitely applied to both myself and the beer. The order to ""Release batteries!"" was given and the ship rocked sideways in the water as I hefted the glass to my lips and let fly. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was semi-sweet, at most, with the malt having done its thing and the yeast having had a field day. The taste was very biscuity and fruity and I could think of nothing but fruitcake. Deelish! In the meantime, we had the bloody Dutch on their heels. Our double-crack'd CANnons left those clog-wearing punks on their heels and they had no choice but to tack away and northward from whence they came. One of our lads incurred a splinter which will almost assuredly cost him his arm, though. The finish was fittingly dry and as we headed for safe harbour, I toasted our brave lads in a job well done."

"Overall: a very good, but not outstanding beer. I would not consider this beer sessionable as it is quite filling. It would be best served as a dessert beer or paired with proper food (such as strong cheese or roast beef)."
""
"Smells fantastic, and like the bottle says - of fruitcake with no real hop aroma to speak off. Pours with a nice white head that dissipates reasonably quickly , and is a dark rich brown with a tinge of red to it. Nice and malty, with a lingering bitterness. Overall a very nice drop."

"oh my.... as advertised... ruby with a tan head and smells like a stinkin' fruitcake. well, if we here in America don't like fruitcakes, what makes 'em think we wanna drink something that tastes like a fruitcake?? the cool thing is they did NOT ADD the flavors (I think) but, rather, it comes from the malts they use which is forgivable, original, and almost commendable. cherry, fig, sticky sugar-y lickable fruitiness on the nose and palate. leave it to the Brits . . . . kind of wish I had opened the Mango Magnifico instead of this one now . . . . typical british tangy malts, sweet yet bitter, fruity and rich. some metallic aftertaste...."
""
""
""
""
"All in all a drinkable, although quite filling, ale. Could be better, but it could be much worse."
"Served at Hunger & Thirst in Lancaster PA. This was an excellent presentation of a classic beer. Very pretty dark brown and heady in the glass. Malty but not sweet, also caramel flavors but not sweet; very well balanced. I almost thought I was drinking a heavy lager, this beer was so smooth."
""
""
"O- this is an excellent representation of the English bitter. A great pint."
""
""
""

"Poured into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Pours a medium to dark ruddy brown amber with a fine one finger light tan head with great retention and good lacing. Great aroma of sweet bready caramel malt, plum and dark fruit, toffee. Flavor follows with semi-sweet caramel malt, dark and dried fruit, nuts and slowly revealed earthy hops, finishing with a nice malty, mildly grassy hop finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A tasty ESB with great malt and nicely balanced hops. I don't know this Gold hop variant, but it is very subtle at first, but reveals itself nicely in the finish and there is great malt support for it. I liked this quite a bit and will buy it again. Nicely done."

"O: A solid bottled ESB that is almost certainly superior on cask."
"Served up this lovely full-pint ale in a pub glass. The color is an intensely clear red-brown, with plenty of visible carbonation and a light tan head that fades away quickly. The nose offers up caramel malts and sweet berry notes. There is more of the same as you take that first taste, although these flavors quickly fade to a drying moderate bitterness revealing a respectable underlying hoppiness. The feel is light and refreshing, and the overall result is a decently complex, nicely enjoyable semi-bitter ale. Absolutely worth trying."
""
"500ml bottle. Pours a reddish brown amber with a small quickly fading beige head. Aroma is of toasted caramel malt, very fruity and yeasty. Taste of toasted caramel malt, fruity, yeast, breads, some toffee flavor and mild earthy hops bitterness. Palate is a medium body, crisp with good carbonation. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt, yeast, fruity, bready with some earthy hops bitterness, ending has a lingering caramel malt and toffee aftertaste. Overall a good, flavorful and pleasant drinking brew."

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"

"A hefty beer with great flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice ESB with plenty of aromas and flavors running around in it. It is a bit too thick and chewy for me to want to drink more than one, but it's a nice sipper."
""
""
"I've not had Fullers ESB for a while, and that might just be better; this is a moreish beer I'd definately buy again."
""
""
"I am self-confessed big fan of the ESB style. I find it to be a highly underrated style, with balanced and, I dare say, often nuanced flavor profile. This beer presents as a clear ruby-tinged brown brew with an off-white head that quickly retreats, leaving a billowy island in the center of my tulip glass I utilize for evaluation. Sweet malts, very subtle dark fruit, and a hint of breadiness commands me to take a sip. Malt sweetness, a hint of hop spice, and candied fruits abound in the palate, with a finish a touch dryer than anticipated. Medium mouthfeel, no obvious flaws, and the desire to have another (which really is the hallmark of a good beer). Well done."
"O: Overall I really enjoyed this beer and would recommend it as a solid session ale."
""
"(EDIT: 26 Mar 2014 - I'm wondering now if this cask was a mislabeled Southwold Bitter - having had Broadside earlier in the month on draft, it tasted quite a bit different than what I've described above... the Southwold bottle I just drank was much more similar to my description above)"
""
""
""
"Sweet and bitter aftertaste, a bit dry."
""
"O=Great all around beer, and one definitely worth trying"
""
""
""
"Pours an ruby-brown - a really nice color. Head is decent at pour but disappates somewhat quickly - somewhat expected with this style of beer. Smell is bready malt and spices. Mouthfeel is good for this traditional English beer but from a bottle. Taste is like a English bitter but with a deeper depth of flavor - stronger malts, some mild hoping and in addition to the notes picked up on aroma the taste adds a bitter/sweet finish - a honey or a nice dark sugar. Good beer."
"Not bad. I don't hate this, and the brew isn't flawed with a bad decision...just too many elements. As rich as this is, the entire fruit basket kinda kills this, even with the bitter at the end. Decent beer, but not the best ESB I've had."
"Beautiful polished amber color, topped with fine head and retention on top. The nose is fruity, nutty, and has some ""raw"" malt sweetness. That leads to a flavor which is dominate of a duet of malty and fruity notes. Accents of pineapple work into the profile. Some butterscotch and toffee crisp appear as the beer warms. The flavor is a little raw at first, eventually smoothing out to become more pleasant and and more fun to drink. Overall, it's a fine choice to drink broadside."
""

"Drinkability: A very good brew. British bitters are not my specialty and I would much rather have it from the cask. But I suppose this will do across the pond."
"Sweet grainy flavors with a hint of hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Some light fruitiness, apricot and melon rind notes. Supple feel, mellow and smooth, not too sweet. Simple but well put together and enjoyable. Overall a solid ESB, lives up to it's benchmark reputation."
"Nothing stands out in this beer. It's balanced, but it has nothing to hang its hat on. Needs some spice and maybe steer it back towards the style a bit."
"Overall, this is a great beer. A perfect example of an English ESB, with true to style flavors and a time tested recipe. Broadside is one of the best English ales that comes to the states, and honestly can be enjoyed for almost any occasion. Top notch."
""
""
"O: Crazy. This was so much better than I thought it would be. Honestly I saw the labeling about world's best brewery so I assumed it wouldn't be great... but it is. This (for me) constitutes a pretty perfect afternoon drinking beer. Rich, but not heavy, with a good kick and easily quaffed. Love it"
"A real pleasant beer, I've been wanting this for awhile and glad to have finally tried it. Fantastic."
"O: It was great to revisit this legendary effort. Still just as good as I remember it, well worth the $4 for a pickup, glad they came back to the States."
"The flavor is an improvement with some darker malt elements. There's not much hop in the finish and the aftertaste is short lived. The body is above average like a typical British ale."
"Although this ale is a bit toastier and richer in malt character than I'm used to in most ESBs, especially my benchmark- Fuller's ESB, this beer seems of a stronger mild ale or a hoppy and soft brown ale of England."
"Overall / Drinkability: I suspect the simplicity of the one malt, one hop combination here would really stick out if this was on cask. Don't let it get too warm though - gets flat and a little too sweet towards the end. So with a full pint, I think one is enough to savor and call it done. Worth revisiting though."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and is quite malty and flavorful for the style."
""
"Note: Labeled as 5.1%"
""
"Mouthfeel is medium-full mouthfeel that makes the beer a pleasure to drink. Hops add a nice drying finish. Overall this is definitely one of the better English Strong Ales I have had in recently memory. ABV is well masked and the flavors and pleasant bitter finish make up for the average aromas. Recommended over the ESB from Adanams; both are good, but not revolutionary, but that is not their purpose."
""
"cheers!"
"It's a decent ESB, but something isn't quite clicking for me. The fruitiness is a bit too all over the place, and the sweetness needs a creamier mouthfeel."
""
"Notes: tastes as much like a Strong Ale as an ESB. The bitterness, while not overpowering, clearly dominates this beer. It is a satisfying sipper."
""
"Overall: Fairly nice, balanced ale."
"A rich, fruity good tasting beer."
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced, no surprises."
"I had this one on tap at The Plough in London. This is a fairly average ESB. It has a decent aroma of hops and fruit. The mouthfeel is light. Tangy taste but not much body there. More to the aroma than the flavor, but it was also served pretty cold. It did go pretty well with the fish and chips."
"Perfectly complemented the fish and chips I also had. Will definitely order again."
"Could go a few of these in one sitting. The malts are really quite nice as the beer progresses."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear mahogany, ruby red pour with two finger head, nice lacing and decent retention. Strong fruity, malty nose overpowers any hint of hops. The taste is much the same. Dark fruit dominates along with molasses and maple syrup with hints of nuts, vanilla, cherries, rasins, and just a touch of chocolate. I get a little hop bitterness on the finish, but overall it's a bit too sweet for my tastes which really hurts the drinkability. Not a bad beer, just not my cup of tea..."
"D - Quite easy to knock back. Nice on a winter's eve."
"This is an excellent ESB. The ABV of this on cask is much lower than the bottle. The bartender, and brewery clip said 4.7. Still far outside the traditional session beer range, but much more managable than what is listed here. Overall, just a wonderful beer, and a perfect example of an ESB."
"Smooth rich body with low creamy carbonation."
"I had this on tap at the White Horse in London. The beer was bright copper colored with a thin head that laced all over the glass as it emptied. The aroma was nice, difficult to compete with my benchmark for the style (Fullers ESB) but still very nice. Some fresh hops on top with a toasted malt background. The taste was similar, with some sweet and dark fruits (apples, plums, raisins) providing complement to the hops. The creamy mouthfeel from the cask completes the experience, a strong contender in the style."
"D- A moreish malty ale. Lovely toasted malt backbone would go delicious with chocolate. Flavours remind me of a dunkel but with the british velvety texture of a creamy ale. Delicous!"
"This is very refreshing. A clean representation of the style and I'd love to try this cask conditioned. All n' all: a great bitter."
"D - Enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Served with a small cream colored soap bubble head and some lace. Color is a very clear mahoganey. Mild hop, malt nose. Flaors about the same with some toffee and good bittersweet balance. Chewy. Very easy drinking. Great body. Ditto carbonation. Session brew."
"Drinkable? Sure. I didn't really toss my pint out the door or anything. Went well with my fish and chips. But compared to other brews I had on my trip, it didn't stand out in the least."
"Overall a decent enough beer. That I probably won't get again."
"Bottle from the LCBO- Deep chestnut pour unleashed a frothy mocha cap leaving pretty spiderweb lace. The aroma that I was first greeted with was caramel and then molasses. Dark fruits (plum, prune) follow with a bit of char and fruitcake. Tastes of sweet fruitcake and sugary nutty malts. Prune and dark plum come in and add more sweetness which is semi balanced by some metallic hops. Problem is, I hate the taste of fruitcake. This is not really good."
"Looks fantastic; tawny with ruby highlights topped with a massive creamy, off-white head. Left a great lacing all the way to end. Chocolate mixed with some raisin like fruitcake notes. A bit of old hop action going on. Palate-wise it jumps out with a strong malt backbone, flecking chico and coffe and chocolate-cherry ripe. Long finish with a rounded bitterness. Wish I had some chocolate truffles to go with it."
"Overall Broadside is pretty enjoyable stuff that I could drink on the regular with no hesitation."
"The aroma was a little subdued. Smelled like fruit. The taste was sweet malty goodness with a bitterness that came on down the finish line. In the mouth it was pretty well carbonated and this would be a brew if I lived in England I would sessionize."
"Good drinkable brew"
"Overall, this one looks like apple cider, and doesn't taste far from it. This may be your style, but it didn't do it for me."
"Well worth a try"
"I had this from a bottle which was slightly larger than a 12 oz. and smaller than a bomber. Cost about $3 US. If this was a bit less expensive I would drink a lot of this beer. Well recommended. Would really like to try the on-tap version sometime."
"Drinkability: High! What a great, enjoyable beer."
"a bit like the 2eme or 3eme GC Bordeaux .... everything is perfectly balanced and smooth ... no rough edges no lumps and bumps ... if you are looking for a perfectly executed, medium bodied, fruity ale ... this one might be just as good as it gets ..."
"Drinkability: Too much body for a session beer, heaviness hurts its quaffability"
"Walnut brown, clear with nice sudsy head in the glass. Tasted side-by-side with a London Pride (the quintessence of English bitter) the extra body and content of this beer was very evident. Nice balance of malty fruitiness and hop. On draft it slips down with unreal ease. Very high marks for this. Of course, I have long had a soft spot for Adnams."
"It could make a good session ale, like most British browns, but I much prefer Young's or Samuel Smith, which go down smoother with a bit more flavor."
"Overall, a decent brew. Definitely sessionable. Worth a try."
"D - Nice flavourful beer that I could easily drink a few pints of."
"This is really unlike anything I've ever had before, but I love it. One of the finest ESBs I've ever had, although I'm not sure I would lump this beer into the ESB category so hastily. It is really a strange cross between a hoppy brown ale and a dopplebock, in my opinion. Very tasty. I will go back for more."
"Taste is very malty...lots of dark toasted malts that are moderately sweet. Break to a drying hop on the finish but never enough to overpower the wonderful toasty malts that are the base of this beer."
"Not a session beer, but i do like a couple of this one on a cold Queensland night (18c or 64f)"
"B+"
"Looking forward to visiting Southwold. Seems this beer would be great from a cask."
"Hazy dark copper-brown hue. A large beige head is initially produced which settles to a light frothy layer that produces some good lacing. Aromas of sweet vinous dark fruits and toffee. Flavours are rich with dark fruits and apples, alcohol noticeable. The bitterness is fairly restrained, produces a clean finish, with some lingering bitter notes. Full creamy mouthfeel with great fine carbonation, which creates just enough liveliness on the tongue."
"It sounds like a normal bitter but there is something different that I couldn't put my finger on. The beer boasts plenty of body, but I have a feeling that this was designed for the cask. The bottled edition boasts a very bitter and sharp aftertaste that actually spoils the enjoyment."
"Overall strong and warming yet very pleasant drinking. Perfect for a session beer on a cold day. A strong beer with the caramelly maltiness either barely dominating or holding the assertive bitterness in check."
"Adnams are pushing their beers into the 'Free Trade' more and more at the moment and are expanding. Their beers are now available all over the UK. I have not detected any lowering of standards or tastes of any of their beers. I try them whenever I come across them, Broadside at its best, is a very very good beer."
"Simply English Premium Cask Bitter at its best. Spicy notes of Challenger (?) hops. Malty and rich but not overpowering. After the first pint the second is enevitable. If you find it on a bar in England it would be rude not to try it! Think warm summer evening in a English country pub garden after a hard game of tennis. Broadside is a drink to sip gently, talk about, then finish off in large mouthfuls. Adnams have acheived a perfect balance of robust and 'easy to drink'. Don't buy the bottled version thinking it's the same drink, it is very different, very good indeed, but very different."
"Okay, I have had the cask version (a number of times!) in April 2007 while visiting London. I found it to be an excellent ""session"" ale, so my ""drinkability"" score would be a 4."
"Oh my! What a terrific ale! I must say, this poured much darker than I was anticipating. A dark cloudy bronze / red colour with a lovely khaki coloured head. It looked wonderful! The smell is delicious with loads of caramel and other sweet, candy-like nuances. There is also a pleasant measure of hops detectable, as well. The taste is a magnificent balace of caramel and hops, as both the sweetness and the hops' bitterness seem to manifest themselves at the same time. The mouthfeel is very smooth, making this easy to drink. A perfect measure of carbonation in a truly wonderful English ESB!! Smashing!! ..and a special thanks to BA Ding for being kind enough to provide me the opportunity to taste this lovely treat!"
"Poured a nice crimson color with an eggshell colored head that left behind some lacing and contained a medium level of carbonation. Aromas of sugar, plums, roasted malt, and sea salt seemed apparent. The taste was somewhat smokey with strong malt flavors. The beer was engaging with a bitterness that grows with each sip and dominates the finish. Slightly chewy texture with a smooth and refreshing. Good flavors and low alcohol content make this an easy drinking beer."
"All in all this is OK, but I'm not terribly impressed. This just doesn't strike me as very English."
"I hadn't had an English beer in a long time. Adnams Broadside is a good way to get reacquainted."
"Drinkability - a great beer at a great price. 99 cents a bottle on sale at Jungle Jim's. Woo Hoo!"
"M&D: medium-bodied and lively at the same time, the mouthfeel is rounder than round and softer than soft, with a touch of oil against its well-balanced flavour profile. It's simply a bliss as far as a draught ale is concerned... After having tried this fantastic draught version of Broadside five years ago in a Sussex village, this is my first time to bump into the same ale in such perfect condtion. A distinctive ale (IMO) from its own stronger cousin, and equally impressive!"
"It's mild easy to drink one or two but I wouldn't finish the case with this one. Not a party beer."
"Overall - Well worth a try. Very drinkable..."
"Cask conditioned at The Tottenham, London. Deep amber/copper colour, minimal head. Aroma of nuts and red fruits. Flavour is a bit alcoholic with a substantial hoppy bitterness, which leaves a nice aftertaste."
"Cheers..."
"This beer reminds me why I love a good, solid English ESB. Its a mahogany color with a rocky, stable tan head. The aroma is very malt and fruity. Faint butterscotch in the smell as well, and hint of ethanol. Sweet malt tastes, caramel, lightly toasted malts, and a medium hop balance combine in the flavor. Relatively low carbonation gives the beer a creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. Its substantial, and very satisfying. Its not the kind of beer that wows you, but it is thoroughly compelling and would be a hell of a session brew."
"Very well executed English Bitter. Though past the freshness date, it has been stored well and exhibits no hint of oxidation. Wonderful brew from the ""Sunrise Coast"" of England."
"this is something that should not be missed if it is available in your area. i'm not the biggest fan of cask conditioned beers, but this was a pleasant way to finish off a night of good beer consumption."
"This ESB poured a clear, deep amber color with white foam that settled. The smell was lightly malty with a touch of hops. The taste was flavorful: malty with moderate bitter hops. A very pleasant flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and low carbonation feel. This was a very nice pint of bitter."
"This beer is a dark brown, hazy concoction, with a bubbly tan head topping it off. Thick caramel malt scent, with a touch of hops. Nice does of bitter hops with a touch of floral, nice caramel malt front. Bits of yeast and fruit tones show as well. Pretty creamy mouthfeel. Pretty tasty treat from england, give it a shot."
"Adnams continue to create great english ales"
"The red-amber English strong ale has a malty, complex-fruit aroma. Complex malt (biscuit, caramel) and fruit (plum, raisin) flavor. Somewhat sweet, but a suprisingly clean finish, which made this fuller-bodied ale fairly easy drinking. Low carbonation and warming. A good English ale."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head above a deeply reddish-brown brew. Dense head hung around for quite some time, and laced well. Aroma is sweetly malty. Taste is also sweetly malty, but not overly so, and a bit of hops bitterness cuts through the flavor at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very good. Wish I had a chance to catch this on cask like Craig did..."
"Drinkability - I have a bias for Adnam's but this was a really exceptional pint, kudos to the cellarman at The Castle in Cambridge, England. Great pint."
"I will definitely look for this one again."
"This English ESB pours a rich, dark reddish brown with a thin eggshell colored head. There is a slightly metallic initial aroma to the nose, augmented by an underside of maple, ginger, and lemon. The taste is stronger in the malts, frankly more sweet than bitter, and there is a caramel texture to the mouthfeel, supported by strong carbonation."
"Nice mouthfeel, good drinkability."
"Tasted at Max's on Broadway, Baltimore, 30 March 2004."
"On cask at the Old Toad in Rochester, NY. Poured a chocolate brown colour with a thick frothy white head. The aosma was faint. I caught little more than floral hints. The taste was more malty than anythong. Roasted barley. A bit of a smoked taste. A hoppy finish. I feel that it;s too dry for my taste. I don't think it waas worth the investment, but I would buy it if it was a little cheaper."
"Pours a medium brown color with a white foamy/fluffy head. Not much lacing on the glass throughout. Not a strong smell of anything in particular. Faint floral smell, and a little astringent. Taste has a hint of a toasted flavor, with a smooth dry hop finish. Mouthfeel was nice, as this is cask-conditioned, somewhat creamy and medium-bodied. All in all, a good cask brew. I would have another, seems to be a good session beer. Nothing really stood out, rather a smooth experience."
"Poured a reddish brown with a nice frothy head with more lacing that I expected, which coated the inside of the glas. I could have sworn I smelled a bit of maple coming from my glass as the sweet ale arrived to my lips. Smooth, sweet and very easy to drink, a fine product from Sole Bay Brewery."
"16.9 oz bottle, fresness date of 03 Feb 05, pours nice dark almond with some reddish hues. Tan head leaves medium lacing. Tasty, malty British style ale. Medium body, smooth creamy mouthfeel. Balanced and understated, a nice warming everyday ale, fine session quaffer."
"Pours a deep ruby with a thin but persistent white head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is a nice mix of caramel and bread-like malts and some herbal hoppiness. Flavor begins sweet with caramel and dried fruit flavors, then finishes with a nice herbal bitterness. Somewhat acidic, with a smooth medium to full body. Alcohol is somewhat more noticeable than it should be, but all in all this is a very fine beer."
"Deep copper in color, deecent while minimal head/lace. Aromas are a treat: Warm/yeasty bread, shortbread, fruity hop, malt extract. A treat to taste as well. The mouthfeel is full, round and silky. Flavors are bready/ doughy, quite malty with a decidedly fruity hop bitter that lingers deliciously. This is one solid ale, that is so easy to enjoy, and welcome addition to the marketplace here in Chicago. Welcome back Adnams, and thanks again to Shelton Bro's for the sample!!"
"Had this on cask at Redbones last night, and it was a very pleasant find. Root beer color when poured, it had this great frothy tan head that covered the inside of my glass during drinking. It had a wonderful fresh bready aroma. I found the taste mild, biscuity, and astringent in the finish. Very enjoyable, and nice to see on cask."
"This amber-red beer some muted hop character with an aroma of caramel. The medium body is nutty and tastes of cherry fruitiness and is quite malty. It finishes dry with tastes of mint and hay, which balances the malty body. This would be a nice session beer because it is quite appetizing and easy on the palate."
"Excellent bitter on cask at Monty's Korner. Pored a hazy copper color with a nice off-white-ish head that receded into some elegant lace. Smell was wonderfully full of raisins and biscuity maltiness. Taste was much more distinctly bitter with a goof hop presence despite the cask effect and a good full bodied flavor that was ripe and estery, but by no means over the top. A wonderful session brew that is worthy of several pints that I sadly did not have time for. Hopefully it will be there still on sunday night."
" Flavor is some caramel with almost a buttery toffee flavor and texture. A light piney hop finish at the end. A very nice beer that is incredibly smooth and easy to drink. A good choice for a session beer. I enjoyed this one."
" Great drinkability and a perfect English session beer with a bit more malt going on than most ordinary or special Bitters."
"A nice surprise at Monty's Korner last evening...and cask conditioned to boot! Impressive and rich in appearance with a deep caramel and ruby colour. Incredibly creamy head that decorates the sides as I quaff my 20oz. pint from the Adnams logo glass. The nose is bready sweet, suggesting the grains and steaming hot wort from which the brew originated. Also evident is a fruity aroma with notes of grape and plum. Hops take a back seat here. The taste is a delicate mix of the intricate aromas and a surprising warming for a brew at 4.7% abv. Hops provide balance only, exhibiting a subtle pine hint here and there. The ease of drinkability is scary. Cheers to Publican William Taggert for this gem and often having the knack for providing something different and interesting. I really dug this beer."
"I must say that this beer makes me a little disappointed: I expected a well-crafted, complex and generous strong ale, but what I got was just an aggressive yet plain bitterness with a taste of alcohol that belongs to much cheaper beers."
"(6.0% ABV bottle)"
"The Broadside pours a slightly hazy, deep copper body beneath a creamy head of off-white foam that holds well and slowly drops to a wide collar and whispy surface covering, all the while leaving some very nice lace about the glass. The nose delivers earthy, leafy, and grassy hops over a caramelish malt. It's full bodied and creamy in the mouth with a very fine and natural (bottle-conditioned), moderate carbonation that gently caresses the tongue and rouses the tastebuds. Caramel/toffee/nutty malt dominates the flavor, accented by a thin thread of yeasty fruitiness (cherries) and earthy, woody, and grassy hops. It's really well-balanced by a solid bitterness that never steps beyond its supporting role, but anchors the entire production. It finishes dry with some subtle alcohol, a note of yeasty fruitiness, and a residual bitterness that leaves the palate refreshed and ready for food or more beer. Quite tasty!!! And a surprisingly drinkable ale considering it's 6% abv (the draft version is 4.7% abv)! The alcohol remains almost completely cloaked throughout. A bit strong for an all night session ale, but maybe one to get you started! Well worth trying."
"Thick foamy, light brownish tan colored head, that leaves a little lacing. The beer is syrupy brown in color, almost like cola. The aroma is a little bit chocolately mixed with lightly sweet malt. Caramel and sweet malt dominate the initial flavor. I think there's some hops in there that cut the initial sweetness, but they never make themselves fully known. A good, flavorful beer, a bit on the sweetside, but not too much."
"Drinkablity: Very solid English ale, good everyday brew."
"On cask at the famous White Horse in Parsons Green. This stuff rocks! A dark amber coloured brew with a white cap of foam. The aromas are very hoppy, fruity, and very, very, well-balanced. The taste is hoppy and fruity with a nice malt backbone and the mouthfeel is creamy and oh-so smooth. The drinkability you may ask? Wonderful!"
"i really never notice that its quite strong, even for a traditional english ale, but that is yet another thing about broadside that makes me give it consideration every time im in the mood for a top quality beer from the u.k. i cant wait to head over there next year and get into some of this from the keg!"
"The beer is a brown color with a hint of amber to it. I had to try real hard to get some head out of it, and it dissapated right away. Maybe some fruitiness to the nose. Not much else. The taste is mostly a medium maly sweetness. I also get the taste of alcohol: suprising since the beer is only 6.3%. Maybe some bitterness at the end. It is almost trying to be a barleywine, but it doesn't really impress at all."
"This totally British Ale is dull gold in color and possesses a moderately smooth, herbal malt with woody notes. Amply hopped with a complex blend providing some tea, citrus and hints of metallic bitterness. The aroma is fresh and pleasantly malty. This is a mild ale, well balanced with nothing jumping out. The head bubbles are larger than expected and dissipate rapidly. A well-made ale."
"Pretty good. Quiet smooth malty flavour, quite a nice caramelly roasty flavour, a bit sweet, but balanced by a decent bitter finish, i kn dof like it, quite smoooth aswell, decent."
"I tried this at the famous Whitehorse pub in London. A mid-brown beer that was very very smooth. Hops were on the restrained side and there was hint of fruitiness. I found the flavor lacked distinction but it was very very drinkable. Lace was non-existent which accounts for the lower appearance ranking."
