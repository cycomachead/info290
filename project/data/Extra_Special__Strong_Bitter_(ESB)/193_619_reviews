"Unbalanced. Too sweety-malty. Leads too sweet, becomes cloying by halfway through the pint. Wouldn't order again."

"Overall: This is not an ESB. This is an IPA without aroma hops. I cannot imagine drinking more than one of these. Out of balance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I recommend everyone to sample this. Others may really like it. I enjoyed it but probably won't buy too often due to competition."
"Overall: this is the second beer I have had from Anderson Valley (the first being their Amber Ale), and neither are even a decent beer, let alone worth the top-end boutique price. One brewery to scratch off the list."

"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium goblet. Thin head but nice lacing. Coppery amber color, and hazy. Aroma is citrus and malt. I don't quite get the floral notes in aroma and flavor thAt are advertised on the label. The flavor is delightfully bitter, grapefruit with pine and malt. Mouthfeel is medium, with a fair amount if carbonation. Overall this is a very good to outstanding bitter ale, and one of my favorite styles. This brewery makes several styles that I really like."

"Anderson Valley still remains one sneaky brewery....they are producing some good stuff. The ESB....while not my favorite style is quite taste. The beer poured a slightly hazy copper with 1/2 finger thick head that is leaving a lace. The scent is slightly sweet with bitter hops present. The taste is bitter at the front then smooths with a sweet malt. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer and glad I tried it."

"Golden color. Lots of white lacing but could be due to that fact I used a narrow glass. Disappeared quickly. The nose of the beer is hoppy, floral, the bottle describes it as lilacs, white pepper, and Bartlett pears with blueberry honey and roses. Not sure if I get all that but can believe the floral as it is flavorful but dry. Spicy but mild in my opinionCrisp finish slightly hops."

"Fairly standard stuff overall. Tasty, but nothing really intriguing going on."
""
""
"O: Good beer. I like the black pepper notes a lot- that's not something I've really tasted in beer before. I really enjoy the spicy tingle in the mouthfeel, and I'd love to try more beers with similar characteristics."

"O: A delicious and authentic ESB. Great to see a US company do this so well. I like the additional citrus hoppyness. Makes it slightly American, slightly modern. Would go well with British pub foods."
"Amber orange color with a two finger head with medium retention and leaving some laces. Delicious citric aroma of grapefruit, oranges and slightly toasted malts. Nice bitter and citric taste. Flavor of grapefruit, sweet malt with hints of peppery yeast, earthy hops and burnt italian bread crust. Dry with a long last bitter aftertaste. Light body with perfect carbonation. 6.8% ABV is completely hidden. This Belk's ESB version gave me the impression to be better than the previously named Boont ESB, probably due to the fact this is much fresher. Anyway, not sure I was lucky, but I tasted an excellent beer, flavorful, balanced, quite assertive and pleasant to drink. An American interpretation of an English ESB, and in my opinion, very well done."

"Aroma is mellow, you pick up the grains and some hop, but not a lot. This is also the case with the taste; smooth, malty, grainy with a solid bitterness but not a lot of floral or citrus hop character. This is a heavier beer than I expected with significant body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a big fan of many ESB's or english beers in general unless they are firkin (cask, real ale, etc). This one was a bit harsh and I think it had an oxidation problem. If that was fixed I might have scored it higher, but for now... meh"
""
""
"One of these days, I'm gonna suggest to one of my linguistics contacts that a paper on Boontling is a good idea... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden-amber topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises mild orange zest, buttery caramel, and soft grass (think the lush hills of rolling verdance in the general Northumberland area...yeah...). The taste brings in more of the same, though the grass now clearly overshadows the even-milder-than-before citrus character. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a solid ESB, one of the better ones coming from the States."
""
""
""
"More bitter than my palate cares for, and the minerally character was overwhelming. Malt flavor was pretty understated."
""
"Notes: Very drinkable quite good for a warm day or even a cool night. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"A rather enjoyable little experiment, this forcing a West Coast idealism down a traditional English bitter's trusting throat. Anyways, the extra oomph here ensures that this particular ESB doesn't fall prey to the corner cutting prevalent in such offerings of late, from both sides of the Atlantic. Session worthy? Errrr, maybe, but by the third round or so, one might come to disagree, even if the robust flavour seems to indicate otherwise."

"This is a very good, somewhat robust example of the style. Overall, it quite quaffable despite the high ABV."

"The head poured a finger full of pure white head that dissipated slowly and left some lacing on the glass. The body was a hazy orange color with light carbonation. The brew looked a little more like a wheat beer to me than an ESB. The nose had a bit of malt and some orange notes as well. This definitely didn’t smell like a typical ESB to me. The taste had some bitter and grassy hops followed up with some biscuit and malty sweetness. The nose wasn’t my favorite of the style, but the taste was pretty good. The body was on the thicker side with low carbonation. The finish was relatively quick. This wasn’t the best ESB that I’ve ever had, but I’d have it again. Worth a shot."
""
"Overall - Complex, it is not. It is, however, a highly drinkable and very tasty beer. It's a beer for any occasion simply because of it's simple yet rich flavor."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice copper hue with a froffy white head, about 2 fingers. Smells of grain and very light hops, not very pronounced. Tastes of nice grain and hop balance, with earth hop tones dominating in a very tasty combination. Light bodied beer is perfectly carbonated and goes down very smooth. Overall, a very good beer."
"I expected a bit more. Not terribly complex, at the same time, not much wrong with it. A standardized ESB, for reference sake."

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth pounding for a long time."
"OVERALL: Excellent balance and execution. Definitely the best ESB I've had. Anderson Valley continues to impress me..."
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy orange with a long lasting, foamy, white head. Aroma is of spicy hops, bready malt and ripe fruit. Medium, crisp body. Piney, spicy hops up front, followed by bready malt, caramel and hints of ripe fruit. Finish is long and bitter. Nice, flavorful brew."
"O: quite bitter, yet it doesn't stay true to the style."
""
""
""
"this one pours i golden orange hint with a creamy head. the smell is definatly hinting at what's to come. the taste is carmely malt and a smoothing out of hops. it is an extremely well balanced brew. is leaves a smooth mix of hops and malt. it is a sticky and bubbly brew. overall i like this one. it is very well balanced leaning towards the malty side. try it out if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Pretty full on but unbalanced. Got acid reflux written all over it."
"O- A pretty nice beer, maybe not the best ESB but it's very enjoyable and fun to drink nevertheless."
"Very drinkable but a little lighter in body than I would like."
""
"Pours an amber with a finger of light cream foam. This falls in a couple minutes to a beer with moderate lace. Smells of malts (english tone) with a bit of a hit of bitter, burnt caramel. This is the nose I generally look for in an ESB, but this is a little too subdued. Flavor is of malts and a weird, over powering flavor I place akin to sushi wrap (seaweed). Really this flavor is overpowering anything else I am tasting, unfortunately. The body is a bit thin with high carb and a semi dry finish. I'm a bit disappointed by this and would not likely order again on my own buck."
"This pours an enticing crystal-clear golden copper color with an amber hue and a nice layer of foam. There’s a pleasing biscuity malt aroma with a hoppy kick at the end. On the flavor I find a sharp hop bitterness up front with a pleasing toasted biscuit malt backbone that comes through on the finish. There’s an underlying honey biscuit flavor, but ultimately it feels more muddled than crisp for the style."
"Clear medium amber orange golden color with a average, frothy - creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, caramel - toffee notes, moderate hoppy, grapefruit, orange. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and bitter with a average duration. Body is medium"
""

"Creamy microfoam head of eggshell white, doesn’t dimple as much as form rolling hills across the surface, excellent retention with thick and sticky lacing as well. The liquid is hazy and opaque, a glowing orange to yellow color, a few trace loose bubbles discernible within. The nose features honey, bread, cocoa dust, malts with some peat moss, dried lemons, coal tar, matted meadow grasses, some peach to apricot fruit, it’s not really that funky but by the same token the word “clean” does not leap into your mind either. Full-bodied, creamy attack which segues into a bitter finish with a light metal to iodine ring to it. All the apricot, peach, yellow apple, pear fruit as well as white grapefruit to lemon citrus feels pressed, ripe but all the juice forced out. Honey, maple syrup and cocoa fill in some blank spots, buttered biscuit more burnt than undercooked. The carbonation is perhaps too fluffed up to keep the whole clear and linear. It’s interesting at times but not the sort of brew you really want to invest a lot of time or gullet space to."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A thick curtain of lace forms on the glass during the drink down. Smell is of malt and herbal and citrus zest hop aromas. Taste is of malt and herbal and floral hops. There is an almost medicinal bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but not something I would probably get again."

"O- Received for Christmas in a gift pack with a few good beers, but a 60 Min IPA that was a year old, so this beer is at least that. But considering the age, not too bad except for the slight skunkiness and the malt being so forward."
""
""
"O: I like it. it feels like I could drink quite a few of these. at 6.8%, I don't think there is enough flavor to enjoy responsibly."
""
""
""
""
""
"PS - I don't know if it's a joke, or a label misprint, but on the label it reads ""Extra Special Beer"" rather than ""Extra Special Bitter"". Interesting..."

"O- I like this overall. Pretty easy to drink, and I kinda like the dryness of it."
"O: nice drinking, well balanced, tasty beer. If your a fan of the style then your a fan of this beer."
"O: Very enjoyable, good beer to relax with."
"Pours a hazy orange,copper hue which leaves a two finger head that stays and leaves clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is boiled candy,grapefruit,toffee and citrus,the mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with medium carbonation and has tastes of grapefruit,paw-paw,boiled candy,toffee and finished with spicy,herbal hop bitterness and overall its a very nice ESB and would drink again cheers."
"Really good for the style. Glad I got this before AV sold out."
"Pours a cloudy orange/amber with a medium white head. Aroma of sweet malt, earthy piney hops. Taste is spicy earthy floral hops with some sweet malt and light fruity. Palate is a nicely balanced medium body with good carbonation. Finish is floral earthy piney lightly spiced hops ending with some nice caramel malt with some light sweet bitterness. Overall a very nicely balanced brew."
"T: The maltiness hits first. Sweet flavors of caramel and a little peach. Citrus hops come in towards the finish and have a little spiciness to them. The mouthfeel is a touch heavy and wears you down a bit the more you drink. This was a tasty beer though. I'd definitely do another."
"vThis beer poured out as a brownish amber color with a light tan head on top. The lacing was scattered on the glass. The smell of the beer has a nice sweet malt character to it, with a bit of floral hops on the nose as well. The taste of the beer reminded me a bit more of an IPA than an ESB in my opinion. The flavors were a little sweet upfront with a touch of caramel that faded into a strong bitter finish. The mouthfeel I found to be pretty good with a nice easy going drinkability to it. Overall I like the beer, I would drink it again for sure. I wouldn't run out to buy a case though."
"Overall: Quite a hefty beer here. Alcohol comes through rather strong along with some phenolic flavors which makes it slightly resemble something of the Belgian variety. Could be more balanced though."
"Overall, it’s relatively bland."
"O- Really good ESB but its most definitely a west coast interpretation. Heavy on the hops for this style, but still really nice beer."
"O: A great drinking beer that I ended up having a few of, although not my favorite. I love this brewery though, and while none of their beers blow my socks off, they are constantly one of my go to breweries because everything they make is so drinkable."
"A good hop composition, nearly an English character, but more floral notes."
"Poured out with an instant accumulation of frothy head. Vibrant orange in color. The aroma has a lot of sun burnt grass and some bready notes. Some small amounts of earthy hops. A ton of malt on the palette. A darker malt but not chocolate. Roasted but not too much.There are other burnt caramel and toffee notes. A medium/full body and an assertive, bitter, hop dryness for a finish. A roasted/earthy finish that is very smooth and drinkable."
"Overall - This is a very good ESB. It's up there was one of the best I've ever had. The alcohol is well hidden and it is very drinkable. A must try for fans of ESB's."
"Unique brew to say the least. Not really my style but worth trying."
"Overall Drinkability (ha)- An interesting and enjoyable beer. I'm still learning about this style (this is my very first) so I'm not sure how much of a go-to ESB it is."
"Everything is balanced well. Body is clean and smooth and a touch sudsy, alcohol hidden well as well. A good drinking beer. Has its place and time."
"Drinkability - This beer is pretty good. Honestly, I thought it might be a little bit better. It's nothing bad. Decently solid. Worth a try I guess to change things up. I could have a few no problem."
"D - Pretty drinkable, though fairly full bodied."
"Quite mild for an ESB, and smooth! You get the initial slap of sour, but it mellows quickly. It has high carbonation with caramel undertones to smooth out the hops. A solid offering for any IPA or PA lover."
"D-Okay. It doesn't stand out in any way."
"**This is the 1st ESB I've ever had, and it wasn't as bitter as i expected... a little too sweet for my liking."
"Overall: I really enjoyed it. I think IPA's should be more like this, not so strong on the hops, but nice balance of strong malt and hops. The malt just has a familiar taste that I can't put my finger on."
"drinkability Major. You could spend time with a few of these. This has a special touch of ""beerness",has a nice showcase of distinctive hops,but has a quality sort of like a top lager (Elliot Ness) where the malts ,grain,yeast,add depth and the malt side tempers the bitterness enough to allow loading up hop flavors while the whole keeps some balance."
"Notes: This is definitely a bigger beer for it's style. Full bodied, and very flavorful. The 6.8% ABV definitely shows itself, with a warming sensation as it goes down. Boont ESB is easy to drink, and a solid examole of this style."
"Deep yellow color with a good, but not perfect clarity. Poured with a rocky white head. Good head retention and lots of sticky lacings on the glass. Light toasted malt and herbal hop aromas with hint of citrus orange. Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation and a buttery smoothness. A good balance of toasted malt and hop character in the beginning. Hop flavors are spicey with a bit of tangy citrus. Finishes a bit dry with a lingering herbal hop bitterness."
"Pours a caramel color with a nice off white head. Nose brings forward some bread, caramel, fresh biscuits, and some herbal and pine hops. Taste brings a good deal of lighter malt flavors forward and is backed by a good amount of bitterness, but isn't as pleasurable as the nose. The mouthfeel is good, although a bit heavy for the style. Drinks really well and is one of their better standard offerings."
"ESB's are all about balance between hops and malt and this beer tends to lean more toward and IPA style. Not a bad beer but I won't go out of my way to try it again."
"D: Pronounced flavors, bordering on pungent, make this beer a wonderful showcase for the classic qualities of English-style pale ale--however, it is not to be mistaken for a session beer. That said, it is equally capable of entertaining the palate when featured in a solo performance, or as part of an ensemble cast of food and drink. The archetypal qualities and the complexity of this beer demand return visits by the drinker."
"Final Notes: Think of Sam Boston Lager with a slightly richer feel and a bit more hop kick. If you like that beer you'll definitely like this one. Delicious, well-rounded, and sessionable."
"It had some metallic notes at the beginning but faded. The herbal hops lowered the drinkability for me."
"A decent beer but it doesn't entirely do it for me."
"A classic beer color. A simple light brownish tan. It has a slight orange tint when the light hits it just right. The head is ok. It's not real thick but it is lacing the glass really well. The nose is very quiet. There is some hops and a little citrus. A very unique taste. It has an earthy, grassy taste that scratches the roof of my mouth and the bitter hops put a lemon bite on the back of my throat. The bitterness lingers for a short time but the citrus hangs out a long while. I would say this is a good beer worth trying."
"D - Don't usually see my self drinking a bunch of beers like this that are somewhat hoppy and bitter, but this one I could."
"D - Exceptionally drinkable; a very fine brew."
"I like the flavor, though it's not really traditional for the style. A little fruit snack flavor, notes of toasted malt, some floral hops. Very smooth mouthfeel, approachable...I like it. Better enter this review before the battery in my notebook dies!"
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer pretty drinkable. A pretty, well-balanced beer that is crisp and slightly refreshing makes this beer drinkable, especially during the warmer months."
"D - This ESB was a little too sweet for my liking, I like hops to dominate rather than the malts, or at least a fresher hop flavor. That being said, I like it, not my favorite but I could definitely have a couple pints when in the mood. I recommend it. Cheers!"
"Great ESB but i almost think this could edge its way into the IPA category. Two or three of these would suite me well, not anymore than that though."
"Pours a clear golden orange with a small tan head. Smells of tart malt. Taste is citrusy sweet up front, with a caramel malt middle, and a grapefruit rind, grassy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is quite luscious, medium carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, the 6.8% ABV is a bit high for an ESB, but it is still a good example of an Americanized ESB."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"T-- The after taste, which is quite bitter, jumps out at me first. Nice. It's very refreshing. Floral, malty taste to start. Sweet hops, citrusy."
"This beer was very easy to drink, but really most of them are. It had plenty of bite from the hops, which I enjoyed, but it was very well balanced by the sweetness of the malt. I am definitely going to grab a few more. It is worth getting your hands on."
"Very easy drinking, smooth, and decent complexity. Some ESB's try too hard to stand out. This one just tries to be good beer. This as about $14 for a 6, so I probably won't go this route again, but that is my only drawback."
"Mouthfeel lingers with some of the aforementioned characteristics, it is a beer that would be proper with a some meat or spicy thai food. All in all, this is a great beer and a really nice ESB from here in the United States."
"D. Its almost 7% so a bit strong, and the flavors are pretty robust. I'd probably only have a few before I would want something a little milder."
"It's a pretty good beer but i don't think i could drink too many of them in a day."
"An easy drinker. Good for relaxing and enjoying a sunny Saturday afternoon."
"It has a creamy head, medium carbonation and is very smooth to drink, leaving a clean bitterness with a little bite but not too much. Definitely worth trying."
"A solid, hop-forward ESB - very enjoyable."
"A solid ale overall. It has some components that put it outside of the ESB category. Namely, the alcohol notes, the ultra-dry finish, and the higher level of carbonation."
"golden orange like the sun out over us in the middle of the disc golf course in boonville. pines, a bit of citrus, some faint esb-like esters, freshly cut grass, a sexy birdie that just barely chained out. there is just the slightest funk to it, but the hops try the their best to reign it in. a nice bitter maybe a little too much cascade. overall, a pretty solid drink from a pretty cool part of the world."
"Taste was, in my opinion, too much for this style. Slightly piney but a little apricote/clove notes, malt halfway through with a lingering bitterness. To me, this beer seems more to style as an american pale bordering a *balanced* ipa."
"I gotta say, I got two bottles of this from Fred Meyer for the price and the ABV. The smell reminds one of normal American beer, and my first bottle seemed to be hard to drink. It has a strong malt flavor mixed with a reasonable hop flavor, but I couldn't get behind it. Today I knocked off a bottle of Eel River IPA and and Old Rasputin, then drank the second bottle. Now it comes across as a competent but not exciting stronger beer. If anyone can remember Rainier's old Not So Light variety, this is reminiscent of that with more malt flavor. I would say recommended for a fun evening of microbrew binge drinking, but take it after something more distinctive."
""
"Slainte!"
"Overall a very tasty beer that I will be returning to soon."
"D - I had a whole 6 pack in one sitting so I liked the drinkability. May be more bitter than most people like though."
"A pleasant blend of American and British flavours."
"12 oz brown bottle to glass. Light honey color. Smells like sweet American hops. Taste has a lot of sweet malty body with an American hop pine/citrus taste and somewhat bitter finish. Pretty much like an American Pale Ale or IPA, not sure why they are calling this an ESB."
"Overall, very tasty without trying to hard with great drinkability. My only problem would be letting the 6.8% catch up with me as it's not noticeable in the flavor."
"Appearance, looks like a decent English ESB. Nothing coming across aroma wise, taste, sweet and tasty, a little thin, doesn't last, but doesn't disappoint and devolve to something lesser. Drinkable, if not for the other (and better) Anderson Valley brews, like the IPA, Oatmeal Stout. . ."
"D - A really nice full West Coast style ESB. A good drink."
"D: There is a pleasant balance of carbonation and thickness to the beer, drinkable."
"This brew was a hazy amber pour into my pint glass carrying a frothy head with visibly active carbonation. The muted floral notes on the nose and pallet are very nice. There is a good amount of fruit presence, again, both in the nose and pallet. This ESB is top end with with a great crispness and sticky feel as it is drank. This is a wonderfully drinkable ESB."
"D - This is a very good ESB. Yet another good one from Anderson Valley."
"This beer is very drinkable to me. The flavors are so strong that after a few it is still obvious that I'm drinking a delicious, flavorfull beer."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability: This is an amazingly drinkable ESB, a very pleasant surprise. Worth a purchase for fans of the style."
"Overall a good ESB. Not mind blowing but decent. Glad I picked it up on sale, but for the normal price tag I could find many other better beers."
"D - The malt character in the aroma is very nice, but the flavor does not quite live up to the promise. The flavor lacks complexity and though the sweetness is not excessive, it is a bit medicinal for some reason. Not bad, but for some reason it doesn't really come together in the end."
"Highly recommended."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a orangey amber with a thing white head that left about 1 finger of residue on the glass. Small amounts of carbonation were seen rising from the bottom. Smelled sweet, slightly fruity, with a bit of hops. Taste was hoppy bitter, with a small bit of sweetness. Felt right in the mouth, tingled a bit. More of a sipper than a beer to session."
"Boont ESB pours an orange color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is pretty hoppy. The flavor is also very hoppy and there is a nice backbone of toasted malt. A very drinkable, hoppy ESB. This beer is new to Florida, I liked it when I lived up north, good to see it here. Recommended."
"Overall impression- Disappointing ESB."
"overall an average ESB in taste."
"Its not a terrible beer, but I couldn't help but walk away from it slightly disappointed. I feel like ESB should be a little more balanced; and this particular beer seems to suffer a couple of miscues."
"An American classic since this beer introduced a lot of people to the American take on ESBs. An almost hazy mid gold colour with a big head the nose is hoppy yet almost British in profile. The beer has a full mouthfeel with a goodly amount of hops and a fruity midbody that dries off in the finish. This is a drinking beer that never wears out its welcome ( though it is fairly high in alcohol) . Nice to see this in BC in six packs and bombers"
"Pours a bark gold, almost orange with two-finger head that dies slowly and leaves lace down the glass. Soapy, citric hop smell with hints of sweet and bread malt. Medium-bodied w/ plenty of hops and malt but finishes clean and goes down smooth. Has a citric hop taste that is balanced with bread and caramel malt, for a really dry beer, yet like stated above it just passes over smooth w/o ruining the tastebuds. Some herbal and floral hops in there as well lead to some of that dryness, although there are some minor fruit notes as well. Good beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint. Nice dark golden color. Lots of haze. Thin head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves some nice lacing. Very malty and strangely fruity smell, almost like apple cider? Upon first sip I am really impressed. This has alot of balance for an ESB. Not overly bitter and nice and sweet. Lots of carbonation and great session potential. I really liked this one and at the price its a great deal!"
"D - I don't know about this one. I seems like somebody mixed an ESB with a hoppy IPA. Weird, seems like a wild pitch to use a baseball analogy for me."
"D- Very drinkable, could easily session on this."
"D: The bitterness really lingers with this beer. I foresee myself finishing 5 more of these before bed time. Or lights out. We'll see which comes first."
"D: Drinkable, certainly, but not in preference to lots of other highly drinkable beers of the same type."
"(3.7/5)"
"A very good session ESB, consistent with a mild blend of hop bitterness and sweetness."
"When poured in a glass, the color was a slightly hazy medium deep golden yellow, with a fair amount of foam and nice lace on the side of the glass. The smell of hop's and whatever else their was is the weakest point of this ESP. Now, the taste was better than the aroma. I could taste mild bitter hop's. A touch of malt's and citrus. Nice balance of bitterness, not over powering, but, just suttle enough to bring out the flavor."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, a bit sticky, moderate carbonation. Very nice American take on an ESB."
"Overall: An astringent mouth feel with a small amount of carbonation. The finish is bitter and it linger on the palate, begging you take another sip. I like this ESB over the UK version that I have tried. There is a nice balance with a good amount of hops."
"Anderson Valley have redefined ESB as ""Extra Special Beer", and i see how they have redefined its ESB cousins back across the Atlantic. it's like an IPA with an extra helping of malt. and a nice balance, in my opinion."
"Brandon, having prior knowledge, and enjoyment from, Anderson Valley Brewing Company's delicious beers, once stated that ""this beer might be the best ever sold at Trader Joes. I personally enjoy almost every AV Brewing Co release, and this is among my favorites - in fact, a Trader Joes employee once said 'this is the best beer we sell.' Great beer, great evening, happy Tofurkey Day."""
"Good brew."
"Notes from 6/13/04."
"I big beer in taste and heft. The smell is pleasant and inviting with caramelized malt leading the way with a slight hop note. The taste is smooth, slightly sweet, and slightly bitter. It's definitely a big beer, therefore, not one that I can drink in great numbers. Very enjoyable and worth the buy."
"Overall I think this is on the heavy side of an ESB. Very malty with a resinous and floral hoppy finish. I like it and the quality is unmistakable, but it is too strong compared to what I expect from and ESB and I don't think it is as drinkable as an ESB is intended to be."
"D: Yep."
"The taste is caramelly, bready, and fruity up front - fairly, tasty, and interesting - with clear sweetness that is a little too thick and unbalanced but then an overly strong bitterness of grapefruit-pulp flavour, takes over. This bitterness loses some of its flavour but becomes more sharp and lasts through the fairly quick finish of cracker and bread to leave a lingering, overly bitter, almost acrid, aftertaste. The worst part is this overly bitter, sharp, grapefruit-pulp end. It also lacks balance in that it is simply sweet up front and bitter in the end, without the two meshing. This is too bad becomes it has some nice flavours and zestiness up front, has a promising start, and has enough bitterness and sweetness to be interesting. They just need to blend and balance these better and tone down the sharpness of the bitterness."
"Unlike any other ESB I've ever had. Certainly a California version of the style and it is brilliantly executed by AVBC."
"D: I like this one a lot and can recommend it to both existing ESB lovers as well as those looking to try the style. I believe this is a very fine example of an American ESB."
"D- Pretty drinkable but needs a little more balance in order to receive a higher mark."
"Good carbonation, a little fizzy. A bit on the strong side to be sessionable, but very enjoyable."
"Altough on the fizzy side, its a pretty solid ESB. I felt a little special at least."
"Not a bad tasting beer but way outside of what an ESB is. I would put this under the American IPA category."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Diminished by noticeable sweetness for style."
"Quite hoppy for the style. In England, this would be considered an IPA or even more, with perhaps too little maltiness. In sum, this beer is too hoppy for my girlie-man taste buds."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, but not what I was expecting from this ESB by AV."
"Very smooth and medium in body, Anderson Valley's ESB is a fine and refreshing drink."
"Very drinkable and could be a session if it was about 1% less alcohol. A good 4 seasons beer."
"M/D - Crisp, medium bodied beer. Very drinkable."
"I was suprised by the hoppiness, although the more more you drink, the more it is like an ESB. Delicious and worth a try!"
"The drink settled with a murky orange appearance with a thin head but some good lacing. Malty aromas were decently high but nothing else seemed to be on the radar. I was surprised by the taste of this ESB, much more of a IPA almost. Bittersweet hops were prevalent in the taste department. A pretty good carbonation helped make this a nice and crisp beer. Overall, a good beer, but it really deviated from an ESB."
"D: Not a bad beer at all, but not something I would get all the time. Might be better with a meal."
"I may be way off base, but this reminds me more of an arrogant bastard than a traditional ESB. I like it, I like it a lot."
"Pours a hazy light golden amber color with a thick billowy head leaving nice lacing. Smells of toasted grains, spicy hops, caramel, lemon citrus and alcohol. The spicy hops hit the tongue first followed by a deliciously balanced bitterness and malt sweetness. Finishes very dry. At first sip, this seemed overpowered by bitterness, but as I drink more it developes great balance. The malt character intensifies with each sip and I love the complexity of flavors. Two big thumbs up here for this brew and Anderson Valley. It's bahl hornin'!"
"Nicely balanced. Not to sweet and lets the hops do their thing."
"Not a bad ESB, quite traditional in many ways. The beer is copper colored with a nice creamy head, lacing, retention, and modest carbonation. The beer has a nice creaminess to it in the mouthfeel, and has some biscuity and bready malt aromas and tastes. The hops are a bit biting, a bit musty, a bit tea like in their harshness. The beer has some floral notes in the aroma, a definite sweetness comes through as well. The taste is fairly well balanced, a little on the musty side, the acerbic hop and the biscuity malt do blend quite well. The beer could benefit by being more crisp, and it does have a taste as though it may have been sitting around a bit too long. There is a slight spiciness to the beer, perhaps it is a peppery flavor that comes through in the finish. The aftertaste maybe lingers a bit longer than wanted, but this isn't a bad beer, just not exceptional."
"a decent ESB, has a distinct English malt character. Certainly damp kilned malts and a soft carbonation and quite clear copper brew. Nice spicy hop character with a fair amount of bitterness, pretty decent. As far as American ESB's go, really can't complain"
"A good representation for an ESB, with good hop balance. Definitely worth a try!"
"I'd call this a cool American interpretation of the ESB. The appearance is pretty much normal, amber with an off-white head. The aroma is a mix of sweet and dry biscuit malts with peppery and herbal hops. A big spicy hops flavor dominates the palate and develops into the aftertaste. The biscuit notes from the aroma come out under the hops with a bread, multigrain-like taste. All together, this is a pretty nice beer. Worth a try for a different sort of ESB."
"Clear caramel color appearance with a little under 2 fingers worth of white foamy head. It could be the change in temperatures are messing with my sinuses because I couldn't smell much from this beer aside something a hint of something sugary sweet followed by the aroma of hops. Tastes quite good, you get hit first with a little sweetness followed by a a blast of bitter hops. Not too hoppy, but don't drink with something light because it will just get overpowered."
"M/D: Very drinkable and the mouth feel is very good with the sweet touch as well as the bitterness that goes with any ESB."
"D: Decent drinkability, though nothing to exciting and wasn't as bitter as I expected leading to a only moderate enjoyability."
"An okay ESB, and very close to the traditional english version. Good."
"I enjoyed this one a lot. Its tasty and easy on the way down, but that 6.8 will catch up with you eventually."
"D - This is a killer session brew, despite the 6.8 ABV. In fact, I was pretty surprised to see such a high level of booze in what is usually a lighter sessioning-type beer style, and I didn't detect any alcohol in the flavor or feel either. Well done!"
"Definitely recommended..."
"The taste is of molasses with a bitter end. The horehound hard candy comes to mind. The bitterness is not overwhelming and adds a good balance to the sweetness. This had good drinkability, not my style but it had no off flavors.."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass; I think this is the first Anderson Valley brew I've ever had, although I've seen them around for quite some time. Beer is a slightly hazy, golden-orange color with small chunks of sediment floating throughout the beer like a snow globe. The head is white and foamy, but not very active. The smell that comes to mind right away is green tea, but there is also toasted notes and a slight unidentifiable hop presence. The taste also reminds me to a lesser degree of green tea, there is also a definite hop bitterness - slightly grassy and floral - that balances pretty nicely with the toasted malty backbone. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a foamy/creamy carbonation. This is a decently drinkable beer, better than average but not my favorite beer by any means."
"P.S. As others have mentioned, this beer is actually named Belk's ESB and not Boont which is AV's amber. It has been reported."
"D: Tart grapefruit. That's the flavor that dominated the experience for me. Quite enjoyable. I could easily drink another."
"A very enjoyable beer"
"For such a large West Coast ESB, I always expect a quite a bit more hoppiness out of this one... If you're using English hops, then let me taste them! That being said, the above negatives are only suggestions... this beer is very drinkable with a great body... I would not suggest making it a session, lest the alcohol smacks you right in the motor skills."
"This beer poured a yellowy amber with a two-finger off-white head. The smell is a little malty. The taste is pleasantly hoppy with some floral and piney notes with a not unpleasant bitter hop bite toward the end. The mouthfeel is crisp, and I would consider this to be a fairly drinkable beer."
"Amazing orangey head in my anti-gravity glass. Aroma C-hop, amarillo hop? Blind tasting English style ESB, orangey taste, drying and satisfying sweetish aftertaste. Great, an IPA addict's take on an ESB. Good carbonation and medium smooth mouthfeel."
"D - Overall, this is quite a tasty ESB that focuses a bit more on the ""bitter"" than most other ESB offerings I've had. Nice floral/citrus hop aroma and bitterness with sweet malts. Nice mouthfeel with a classic, clean bitter finish. Very enjoyable!"
"What an unusual brewery... Slightly hazy golden color with a very dense head, stacked. Smell is dominated by sweet malt, specifically vanilla. Vanilla is also the cheif trait of the flavor which ends with a firm, zippy Saaz finish. Very creamy and fat throughout, puckers up nice at the end. I would love to know where AV gets this vanilla characteristic from, as it is a recurrent theme in their beers. Strange, but nice."
"This is a very drinkable beer. It is a little strong for the style but still tasty and good! Have a few!"
"dark golden with a white head. dissipates relatively quickly but never dissapears and leaves some nice lace. smell is biscuity malt and some hop in the background. it seems pretty balanced to me. good malt character and not to strong on the hops although there is a nice citrusy, piney, herbal, flowery and just a bit bitter taste in the finish. nice medium body on the light side of medium. a great choice for my session beer at a bbq, although it may be a little strong for most."
"12 oz bottle obtained from Half Time Distributer Poughkeepsie NY. A nice,refreshing thirst quencher. Pours a cloudy iced tea color with a big white head. Head retention is excellent and there is a fair amount of scattered lacing on the glass. Aroma is pretty good, mostly malts. Good taste, crisp malty up front with a mild hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel was ok, rich enough with nothing unpleasant in the aftertaste. Drinkability is good, an excellent thirst quencher, but 6.8 abv is pretty high for something I would want in a session beer. If I was served this in a group drinking pitchers, I would probably be wasted before I found out the real octane level. All in all a very nice beer. I would certainly try it again."
"Could not drink too many of these, maybe another bottle max"
"Interesting interpretation here - an American twist to a classic English style. Malty with a touch of Pacific NW hops. The metallic tinges do not help it. Overall - it's okay but doesn't stand up to others of the style, or other offerings I've had from this brewery."
"Overall, an interesting zesty-flavored hoppy beer that would certainly fit nicely with some spicy food or hors doeuvres. By itself, though, the aftertaste is too dry and cottony to have more than one."
"Pours a clean orange-ish copper color with a white head. Aroma of a mild grapefruit hop. Taste of bitterness, dry end, and a small hint of fruit. Clean and a dry end, but not overly bitter. A very nice bitter, easy drinking, with a nice hop presence. I think it might be good for newbies that what to try hops."
"Not an ESB I'll be revisiting, but an alright beer."
"A clear orange hue was the first to make its appearance. Clear with a sudsy head. The smell was not all that great. The taste was okay but a little flat which seems to be a characteristic for esb's at least for me. Mouthfeel was good and it lasted quite a while. I will try again to compare."
"D: Good drinkability for its heft, another winner from Anderson Valley."
"D: An enjoyable well balanced beer. The alcohol in this is pretty well masked so be careful if you are planning on drinking a load of these."
"D- another great brew from Anderson Valley, great ESB, highly recommended, great drinkability, delicious"
"Overall a decent malty ESB. I orefer my ESBs a bit hoppier and the diacytl didn't help out either."
"Pours a slightly amber copper coor, a little foggy, with a finger of white head on top that dissolves fairly quickly. Nose is balanced; hops and malt both show up, and a hint of saltiness in the background. Definitely bready as well. Nose is good, but mild. Taste is solid ESB ish. Salt is what hits you immediately, and then again in the fairly salty hop aftertaste. In the middle there is that slightly sweeter toffee malt flavor. Not bad. Feel is standard; medium body with solid carbonation. Overall, this is a good one, although the saltiness (kind of a staple for the style, I realize), might limit the drinkability a little."
"Medium-bodied and pretty complex, going from bright on the front palate, to a sweet middle act, but the hops are present throughout, yet provide different sensations on the way. Dense but drinkable and unlike any ESB I've had."
"Overall, a nice entry into this style. I like the balance. And the appearance is superior."
"Pours a deep golden color with a decent head and medium to lower carbonation. Smell is of sugary caramel malts and citrus hops. Taste is balanced with malts and a little hop bite. Mouthfeel seems good to me. Crisp and smooth at the same time. Medium. Drinkability is good as well. I like Anderson Valley's beers greatly. This one isn't necessarily the best that they have to offer but it's a good ESB."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a deep brown color ale with a big nice foamy head with good retention. Aroma of PNW hops is well balance with caramel malt. Taste is a well balance mix between some caramel malt with light toffee and some great hops presence with provide mild bitterness and a great floral aspect to this beer. Great carbonation with a full body which really fit the style. I really like and enjoy the balance in the beers from this brewery."
"Notes: My first try of an Anderson Valley brew and a solid ESB with some great unexpected flavor characteristics. I'll definitely check out their other two brews that became available in my local store recently."
"Dry finish, but a ""wet"" drink. Very clean, no film. Overall, very dry, biscuity and balanced. Bitter/dry malt, sweet hops. Quite good. Really the defnition of what an ESB should be."
"DA: This is not my favorite ESB, but it's not very hard to drink either."
"The is not the most drinkable ESB in my book. It's a bit heavy on the alcohol, even if it is totally hidden, and not so tasty that I just couldn't get enough. Although it's a smooth and easy drinker, the bittering hops build on the tongue, and could have used more aroma to balance them out. All and all, not bad, but not one I'll be buying again most likely."
"All in all, a very good beer"
"Drinkability: Not particularly well-balanced for an ESB; rather disappointing, in fact; I like many of Anderson Valley's beers - this one and the Belgians are not at the top, however"
"Appearance is a cloudy burnt orange with a generous khaki head. Lacing is quite sticking and remains well throughout tasting. Very clean scent, a little weak but has mild hop aroma with a buttery undertone. Taste was much different than expected. Hops appear powerful in smell, but weak in taste. Malt seems to overpower the flavor of this ESB with a fair hop bite to the aftertaste that remains well after swallow. Carbonation is quite mild throughout tasting. To me, this is a very drinkable ESB at 6.8%. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming. Very smooth, enjoyable beer. My first brew from Anderson Valley, and I now look forward to trying more in their lineup."
"this is avery nice esb, i think i will buy it again."
"Taste is interesting, with subtle notes of eggplant, metallic hops, and wheat. A tough one to pin down. Mouthfeel is acidic and well-carbonated with an immensely bitter aftetaste (some may go so far as to call it especially ""extra"" bitter). Bottom line: I'll have this one again at some point in time, but I'm not enamorated with it. Give it a try, it won't disappoint."
"update: less complex than i remember, buttery, bready malts in the aroma and taste with a gingery bitterness balancing out the light to moderate malt sweetness. simple but sessionable other than that i'd expect more from a beer of this abv."
"Big thanks to Wasatch for this one as well!"
"Much stronger than what I expect from an ESB--actually stronger than their APA! A wonderfully Americanized version of the classic UK style."
"Another brew obtained via Wasatch; thanks bud!"
"Mouthfeel was stylewise appropriate with mild carbonation. Not a standout in any characteristic but drinkable."
"I've had a couple Anderson Valley's and haven't been let down yet. This is a really nice looking beer, great lacing and a head that never dies down. Has a slight oft-red color with nice caramel malts to it that are heavy. Full-bodied flavor with some Northern Brewer Hops kicking in at the end to balance this beer out. A great price, a malty/hoppy nose and a malty/hoppy taste. Great offering!"
"I'm finding that ESBs are slowy going the way of the IPA here in the states and it was refreshing to see this beer not only be good but rather true to it's roots. Another fine beer from Anderson Valley."
"The drinkability is ok, a hard beer to brew and keep my attention. MK"
"Poured out a cloudy orange golden color topped by a thin white lacey head. Not much in the nose, some slight hop bitterness, a tiny bit of malt. The taste echoes the nose, little bit of malt, some hop bitterness, spicy to some degree, but not much else. A fairly crisp dry mouthfeel. Good pleasent beer, but nothing special."
"Overall impression: Definitely bigger than your average ESB - the alcohol is just a bit to prevalent for this to be highly drinkable for me."
"Pours dark amber with a decent sized off white head and sticky lacing. Relatively faint aromas for the style, with little in the way of hop aromatics. On the palate, quite grainy first off, with hop bitterness at the mid-palate and slight ale sourness at the finish. Full, dextrine mouthfeel. This is a bit out of character from Anderson Valley's other offerings, as the ESB is perfectly solid but lacks depth, which I see as one of the house characteristics of theirs. Not a bad beer at all. In some ways, it's quite decent. But I see no reason to pick this beer over some of the other AV staples."
"Syrupy and juicy flavors take over the palate with hints of toasted grains. Black pepper spice, caramel swirls and a freshly peeled orange blend together. Heavy presence on hops of this brew that supply a biting snap finish."
"This beer pours a real beautiful cloudy amber gold with a huge 2 finger white foamy head. The smell is very pungent with high aromas of citrus hops along with a bready ""bisquity' aroma. The taste is very much like an IPA with a big hop presence. Citrus hops really dominate this beer with, grapefruit, and a buttery creamy sweet malt. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing very well. This is a very drinkable beer,one that could be an everyday session beer."
"Pours a bright golden-amber color topped by a creamy stark white head that recedes to a thin ring in a minute's time. Nice, balanced aroma of sweet, fruity hops and sweet caramel malt. Palate is again well-balanced, with tangy, fruity hops blending with the mellow caramel malt to create a smooth, enjoyable flavor. A bit of biscuity character is evident on the smooth finish. Medium body is creamy and velvety, great for an ESB. I'm a big fan of this one - a great session beer, albeit just a tad strong to drink a lot of in a night."
"D: Very tasty and smooth to drink. Recommended."
"This is a pretty tasty Americanized version of an ESB. Flavors are bold, but balanced and harmonized. Good job."
"Tasty and easily drinkable, very nicely done."
"Anderson Valley's ESB is quite unique in their line-up. It lacks the rich caramel maltiness that the pale, amber, and IPA have; it's more bitter; the alcohol shows at just 6.8%; and it's drier than most. There's a harshness to it that I can't quite put my finger on. It's heavy handed with bitterness, but lacks hop flavor and aroma; and it's not nearly as balanced as their other beers. That said, it's still pretty decent, just not up to their normally spectacular level."
"This was my favorite ESB of the day. Anderson Valley is a great brewery imo and I will definitely be getting some more of this."
"12 oz single. Nice looking ale here. Dark golden, hazy with a large rocky/creamy off white head. Good hoppy aroma but balanced with maltiness. smooth well balanced flavour to this one its hard to really untangle the spicy hop from the toffeeish/caramel style malts they sort of intertwine each others like two rather slippery snakes. in the end the hops do peek out and leave a nice long lasting bitter afterglow. Nice mouthfeel well done. Quite a nice beer and very drinkable..well balanced indeed"
"Poured a light copper color with a soft, white colored head. Moderate level of carbonation was present. A bit of lacing could be seen in my pint glass. Aromas of roasted malt, dried fruit (apricot), and mead/honey seemed to come out nicely. The taste was that of malt with a subtle hop presence that grows over time. Quite dry and a bit over carbonated in my mouth, but still good. The smoked/burnt flavors also gained strength as I continued to drink this beer. Overall, an good beer, but one that I would not have several of."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Great carbonation... active, yet it subsides elegantly in the mouth. Easy and refreshing, a bit too strong to session but great alone or with pub fare."
"drinkability: above average"
"Poured a medium copper color with a magnificient white puffy head. Head was extremely long-lasting and left great lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is sweet summer fruity with peach and apricot notes present. Taste is sweet malt, more summer fruit, and a progressive hop bitterness that slowly takes over. Nice complex taste. Mouthfeel is creamy with the pleasant sweetness giving way to the hops. An extremely nice drinking beer."
"I found it creamy with delicate blending of flavors and very satisfying. I think I could session this or at least go through a picher with no problem"
"Pours a dark copper tone with a creamy head that settles to a sticky white cap. Aroma is a nice mix of malt and grain notes, with a slight hop aroma as well. Taste is hoppier then anticipated, but malts come through and balance things out nicely, also noticed a slight alcohol bite at the finish. This one sticks to your palate after the finish, and actually gets better as it warms. Don't know if I'd drink more then 2 or 3 in a sitting, but I guess I shouldn't rule it out either. Only downfall for this brew is that it may be a bit pricey in some opinions, but still worth a try."
"O--Top notch bitter in my book. Gonna be in my rotation right next to the Younger's Special and the Sawtooth. Excellent beer for an excellent price. Well worth a try."
"Must have a name change on this one, as my bottle says Boont ESB, not Belk's. Pours a light copper color with a light coating of head over top and moderate clarity. Nose is moderately toasty and lightly earthy from British hop, lightly biscuit. Flavor is more aggressive. Hops are earthy, with a light kiss of citrus playing over a very strong toasty and biscuit malt with just a touch of caramel behind it. Feel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation. Not a bad brew at all. I'd like to see the malt character be a little more reserved, as its really aggressive, with a bit more hop carry through."
"Amber in color. Fair-sized head dissipates quickly to not much. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Smells like cheese, a little pungent. Taste is well balanced, with caramel malt and bitter hops. All around nice and very drinkable, but I don't know that I would seek it out."
"Pours hazy golden,with a nice foamy head. Good retention and lacing. Aroma was of carmels, hops,and a hint of citrus.Body is medium,and slightly carbonated. Taste is a decent balance of malt and hops,with a bitter edge. Finish is smooth,but leaves a bit of a after taste. Not a beer of choice for me,but worth a try."
"Drinkability- Seems balanced at first, but a bit too much on the hop side of things. Tastes OK and drinks fairly well, just wouldn't be my top choice or top ten for thius style for that matter."
"Quaff was malty and earthy with a spicy hop backbone, finished with a vine aftertaste. Tangy, acidic on the tongue. Not quite as ES as I anticipated, but still a sturdy and drinkable."
"drinkability: huh, 6.8 is a bit high for an ESB, but i'm not complaining. This stuff is gonna go down great. Not many breweries do an ESB, but I for one can enjoy a nice extra special bitter as a nice change of pace."
"Good ESB. Very drinkable, though probably a bit too strong to be a session beer."
"still maintains a nice, clean balance, lighter body, and through the roof drinkability. while this is not the jesus christ of esb's, it's a good find and worth a buy. certainly must be smokin hot on tap."
"I think I got an old bottle, and perhaps I should try another one before deciding that this is not a particularly good ESB, but the beer is whats in the bottle and I will review it as such. If I try another sometime and see a difference, I will update this review. For now, not a particularly good example of an ESB other than the appearance."
"If you ignore the style this is a somewhat drinkable IPA, but out of whack for an ESB IMHO"
"Overall- a decent ESB unfortunately the sweetness practically ruins it."
"You can drink this on a hot day or when ever will drink again."
"I would drink this again if it were more available in my area. Are all Anderson Valleys this good?"
"Pours a little hazy deep golden color, some carbonation, small head which dissapates quickly. There is some nice lacing through out the drink. Scents of hops and malts. Very nice taste for the style, very malty with a bit of a bitter bite at the end. Medium body. Another excellent brew from Anderson Valley, do they even make a bad brew, if so, I've not had one yet. This is very drinkable at 6.8% ABV, I would highly recommend this one."
"This is a nice twist on a style that I enjoy. Simple and flavourful. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall = Definitely recommended if you happen to see it at your store. I wouldn't necessarily go and seek it out as it's not that unique and you can find several other high quality beers of similar nature. Still this one is right up with the best."
"This ESB pours a cloudy amber/copper color with only a slight head. The head stays around for a little while, but there is very little lacing. The aroma is sweet and citrusy. The flavor has a bite. There is a solid finish which stays with you for a while. Nice hops blend with the sweetness. The bite of the hops with the scent and flavor of the alcohol are quite noticable. Nice ESB."
"Overall, a nice representation of the style...glad to try this one."
"Not your typical English ESB but still most drinkable. Must try."
"A little more agressive that the average ESB. Look is fine, just a little lighter rust color than most. Low carbonation, dainty head, fair lacing. Smells malty sweet and biscuity. Light caramel tones. Good hop spiciness and bittering. Tastes lightly malty, caramelly, and a little toasty. Good dosage of spicy and bitter hops against light grain bill lends to agressive hopping for style, maybe American hop varieties...I like it. Warming alcohol rides from sip to swallow. Finishes crisply bitter, lightly sweet and alcoholic, and slick like buttered popcorn. A little less dry than expected. Alochol becomes a little medicinal in the aftertaste."
"D: Very good ESB, nice and strong."
"Anderson Valley's ESB pours golden in color with some head that dissapates fairly quickly. Very minimal lacing. Balanced between solid malt flavor and strong hop bitterness. Nice crisp bitter finish. This is my first ESB, so I will have to try more to compare. But to me, it is like a light IPA with little hop oil flavor and more full malt flavor. This is a drinkable beer and I enjoy it paired with Jarlsberg cheese."
"Taste: The bitterness really grabs the top of the palate. The aftertaste lingers a bit but it sharpens into some hoppiness. This is a solid beer and the drinkability is off the charts. mouthfeel is a bit creamy , fine carbonation means it probably was not forced or at least it feels that way which is fine with me."
"This is quite drinkable - the next time I'm hankering for a good dose of Euro style hops and there's not a high quality Pils nearby I'll most likely reach for a Belk's."
"Overall - Great drinkable brew, very complex with several distinct flavor layers are succesfully intigrated into a smooth unifiyng drink. Great balance and a great ESB."
"The first sip eliminates any doubt that this will be a boring beer as a full mouthfeel and a wonderful dry malt profile mixes with hints of nuts and fruity sweetness. The finish commences with a floral hop bite and a long, slow Euro-hop fade."
"Nice clear amber color with a giant white head that sticks all over the glass. Smells rich with spicy hops, bready grains, and alcohol. Tastes very hoppy. Citrus and piney hops dominate at first but are soon balance by a big biscuity malt. The body is meduim and the drinkablity is great! What a beefy ESB! At 6.8% (and I do not know how I even found this in NC) it gets you buzzed really quick."
"Pours a light golden color with a big white head that leaves nice lacing down the glass. The aroma is caramel malt with a hop background that smells citrusy. The taste begins with a sweet molasses malt followed by an herbal and citrusy hops bitterness that lingers throughout the taste. The hops flavor has hints of grapefruit, pine sap and lemon rind. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a warming effect. The drinkability is good but not great with an almost 7% abv."
"An orange /amber beer with just a slight haze. Has a small creamy off white head, with a small amount of lace. The aroma has strong vanilla and fruit notes with a hint of citrusy hops in the background. The flavor starts out with a blast of hoppy bitterness followed by a nice caramel malty sweetness and finishing off with a smooth tea like bitterness."
"There's somewhat of an accumulating effect by the hops though that dries the mouth out a little much by the end of the glass, so you're ready to move on. Delightful though."
"Poured a nice deep orange with a strong head that is leaving a nice lacing behind. Nose is of bread at of floral hops. Taste is a great representation of an American ESB. Starts with an extreme amount of malts and finishes with a generous amount of floral hops with a hint of citrus. Most extreme sampling of this style to date. Nice full mouthfeel. This is a very nice drinkable beer. It gets better the more it warms up. Anderson Valley has yet to dissapoint me!"
"Overall this is a fantastic ESB. Yet again Anderson Valley has ""wow""ed me."
"Quite sweet, grainy. Rough & raw hops. Medium-full bodied, moderate carbonation. Alcohol comes right through. A brash American interpretation of an ESB, that leaves me wanting."
"Gave this brew a try last evening. Poured to a clear golden color with orange highlights. Had a smallish off white head that had some retention but left a fair amount of lacing. The aromas of this brew seem to be buttery, sweet malt and a touch of alcohol. The taste seems to have very similar characteristics to the aromas, definite sweet malt tastes. Nice spicy hop taste that seems to help this brew out quite a bit. Also can really notice a strong alcohol taste as it finishes. Not my favorite brew but is pretty solid, not sure if I would get it again."
"I had tried this on tap over a year ago and wasnt really all that impressed with it but I have to say I like it alot better out of the bottle.Poures a burnt orange color with a nice almost creamy-like head head that leaves a nice sheet of lace behind as it settles,some citrus and piney hop really come thru in the nose with some light caramel as well.Taste seems to be more well balanced out of the bottle there is still a big west coast hop profile pine and grapefruit but thereis a nice big firm slighty sweet maltiness to it that makes it a very solid well rounded ale.Glad to not only try the bottled version but to find it here in Greensboro."
"Pours an orangy amber color with a rocky beige head. Butterscotchy malt profile with a moderate amount of hops in the aroma. Light floral fruitiness as well. Lots of caramel and crystal malts in the flavor with a transition towards a soft, fruitier, spicy hop finish with some citrus suggestions. Carbonation is average to above average, but good for its style. It's a bit big for its style, too, but pretty drinkable. Not my favorite, but not bad by any means."
"Bottle. Pretty tasty ESb. Firm mouthfeel, bready, citric, tangy, resiny hops. Failry english in style. An averagely drinkable, and well made ESB, slightly aromatic American style ale, but true to the style it is generally pretty English in taste, drinkable stuff in the end."
"Light orange in hue, some sediment lurking slowly; thin, yet bubbly white head. A spicy and hop based nose. A hop blast up front, delicate malt based body, a bit carbonated. Grainy notes with some alcohol offerings, finishes a bit dry, a pretty decent stab at the style, just nothin to write mama bout."
"Heavy duty ESB, nearly as big as Rogue's Brutal Bitter but in a much different way."
"Drinkability: The harsh bitternes brings this beer down a notch and draws it out fo style."
"This one definately pushes the boundaries of an ESB. Pours a medium amber color with a creamy little head on top. Smells of hop oil and nutty malts, grassy at times and with a doughy bready hint in there. It's pretty malty on the palate although the bitter hops are definately there. Nutty flavor malt blends well with the floral and also citrussy hops. Also has that classic English ESB buttery toffee taste to it, which creates and interesting balance. The one thing I think is the most strange is that the %6.8 percent alcohol, not particularly high, seemed very noticable to me. I usually like that in a beer but it seemed a bit odd here. And believe me, I really like beers where you can taste a kick of alcohol. This really is a pretty big honkin ESB in my opinion. Definately unique and pushes the envelope of this traditional style. I like that in a beer. Go git some."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy, orange/amber color. Huge thick white fluffy head. The head on this lasted the entire beer, and left a great amount of lace. Slightly grainy nose, with notes of both citrusy hops, and piney hops. Taste has some biscuity maly, but the hops seem to take over quickly. Spicy, and slightly grapefruit like hop flavor, with a good amount of bitterness. Not the ESB I was expecting, but Anderson Valley seems to be all about the hops. Medium body, maybe a bit too carbonated. Overall, a very different ESB than what I was expecting, but it sure was pretty tasty. I didn't think it was as balanced as the label says, but no matter. This is a solid beer."
"The ESB poured a light, and completely clear copper color with a frothy, pinky thick head with a just a bit of lacing to complete the package. The nose was dry smelling with notes of grapes, butterscotch and english hops. The taste was sharp up front with some metallic hoppiness that faded slowly into a more traditional, buttery flavored English ESB. The mouthfeel was properly carbonated without being everly so. Good interpretation of an ESB."
"I am an admitted ESB lover. this is a striking attempt by an american brew at an english favorite (fullers, adnams anyone?). The difference here is the hops and carbonation signature. Where a lot of ESBs may seem ""flat"" to a lot of people this one certainly is not. It has the classic ESB flavour but more bite on nose and pallate, more american I suppose. Excellent lace of head on the glass, smells like it tastes and yet after leaving it out for awhile smells like a clasic brit ESB. Beautiful color, amber/brown mixed hue, though very clear. This is an american take on an english standard. The english types tend to lack the bite this does.. so imagine your sierra nevada pale crashed a fullers party.. and you have this brew. If you leave it out to breathe (for 15 min at least) it settles more into a traditional ESB all around but still has a better hop signature than most ESBs. Hop lovers will love this out of the 12 oz typical bottle as is and immediate, ESB lovers/traditionalists should let it sit for a while in a snifter before imbibing to enjoy it fully. Recommended. (note this is a 6.8% brew... barely noticeable in the taste)"
"This is THE best looking beer I have ever seen since I began reviewing. The carbonation's like champagne, the bubbles flowed to the top of the glass for the twenty minutes that I slowly consumed. The head also stayed a perfect quater inch until it rested on the bottom of the glass. The smell had a wonderful aroma of fresh hops. After that, everything else could have improved. A little too bitter, even for an ESB. A little flat in term so fo mouthfeel and due to the time it took me to finish, I would have to say the drinkability was below average."
"Moderately good ESB."
"ng"
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very pleasant malty scent that boasts of pale and light crystal or carapils malts. It is sweet with a bit of hops as well. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop flavor layed over a complex malt arrangement. It seems a bit citrusy, but goes down easy. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good ESB. It drinks well although I prefer more malts and less hops for this particular style."
"Debatable if it's a true ESB, but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability  A pleasant surprise. Ive avoided this one for a while because of the cheesy label (Gold Medal Winner) but this is a quality Americanized ESB."
"This beer, however, is now on my list for something to try again and may change my mind about ESBs."
"Overall, a nice experience and I easily slid into another. Will be a staple in my fridge."
"I like Boont ESB quite a bit. I don't have a whole lot of experience with the style, but this one is solid across the board and is better than most. I could see it in my regular rotation if it was available locally."
"I really though this brew had alot of promise...it looked great, it smelled good, the carbonation level was spot-on for the style, and then....the alcohol, metallic finish, and overwhelmingly herbal, albeit mild bitterness in the finish ruined it for me. This is a wierd brew. Still, I think ESB lovers would probably really get into this. In general, I don't like ESB's, but this is probably the best one I've had so far. Change the yeast, and they may have a winner."
"Light-medium body, oily bitterness."
"This is a very good beer that I could see myself drinking more often."
"Belk's ESB was served from a 22 oz. bottle, with a message under the cap: ""call you mother, she misses you"". In a pint glass, the beer was an attractive hazy orange-metallic copper hue, and was topped by an ample off-white head. The nose was vibrant and bright, presenting a nice array of resiny and tingly citric hop notes and an underlying warm maltiness. The taste was suprisingly robust, with a lightly tart toffee-ish malt body that opened up with citric hoppy bitterness, which increased significantly in intenisity as the maltiness decreased, ending up with a big and aromatic bitter finish that left lingering resinaceous hop notes. I felt a warming sensation in the tummy as a drank, which suprised me coming from an ESB. The body was very full and rich as well. I found this ESB to be very tasty and full in every regard...quite enjoyable."
"pours out a hazy deep copper/orange with a nice thick rocky head. lacing is somewhat sticky yet sparse. aromas of grapes (juice), tea, green olives, sweet malt and a light floral hoppiness. in the mouth it is at first dense and heavy but seems to lighten out a bit and goes down rather smooth. flavors of green apple skins and a sweet malt backbone dominate with a tart bitter hoppiness jabbing in and out. alcohol is evident and adds a bit of character versus making it hard to drink. overall a good beer, strong and flavorful."
"Notes: A true California great. This beer should be more well known, especially to my BA brethren. Just an excellent all around beer that seems to score a bit too low around here..."
"Very drinkable brew ends with a very palette cleaning quality. Really more of a complex ale than an ESB."
"This ESB poured a hazy, amber color with white foam that persisted and clung to the glass. The smell was very minimal (light malt). The taste was fruity (hops) and sharp up front, then came the malt, and then a fruity hops finish. There was a touch of oak in the flavor. The mouthfeel was sharp and crisp with medium body and good carbonation. The fruity hop flavor lingered in the aftertaste. This was a pretty good ESB, though a bit more fruity than commonly found in an ESB."
"This tastes just like a pale ale, and if that is what you are in the mood for, this could be a great session beer. I was expecting something closer to a classic Fuller's ESB. I mean, hell, the whole style is based on Fullers. Therefore, I graded down on drinkability. Also, the 6.8%abv is a little high for sustained consumption."
"This is an all-around fine example of the ESB style. Hearty and well balanced."
"This was a pleasant beer enjoyed on tap at Redbones last week. Pour was a slightly cloudy deep golden. I thought it had a clean, sweet aroma. The mouthfeel was medium, and I thought the taste was based on a piney hop note. The carbonation was slightly prickly. I did not realise that the alcohol was that high. Decent beer, but not overwhelmingly wow."
"The mouthfeel was very tingling as the carbonation level seemed high. Bitterness lasts long into the finish. I felt the bitterness got stronger after the swallow than during the initial taste. The is on the lighter side of a medium bodied beer. Nicely drinkable for flavor, but the mouthfeel was not as smooth as others in the ESB category."
"Belk's ESB was a cloudy gold color with a very substantial head that was a little soapy. There was a lot of clumpy lace.The aroma was floral and citrusy with a hint of maltiness. Tastewise it was bitter, citrusy (lemon and orange peels), yeasty, and a bit sour. There was also some caramel and sweetness. The finish was dry and a tad sour. An all right beer."
"Pours a hazy, burnt-orange, amber color with a two finger beige head. Leaves patchy rings of lacing all down the glass. Aroma is initially of toffee and butterscotch, then comes an assault of westcoast hops with pine and lemony citrus. Mouthfeel is creamy, tart, and medium bodied. Plenty of carbonation here. Taste has a few complexities. Toffee and lots of bittering hops up front. Sweet caramel malts fight a losing battle with the big hop profile. Some buttery and nutty flavors seem to be present, but are, unfortunately, subdued by the massive hops. Finishes dry and very bitter. This could use a better malt profile to balance the hoppiness and come closer to matching the style."
"."
"Sampler-sized taste from bottle. First of several bitters sampled at our homebrew club meeting, so my notes are not copious: Light brown color with thin head. Bitterness is more ""straight," like a traditional bitter, with less of a hoppy nose, at least IMHO."
"This is the last pair of a ""sampler"" case of ESB's and Pale Ales that I bought in PA (12 different brews in one). Every one was good, but I am glad I saved this one to the last. I really, really think this was the best of the bunch. It had a very ""American"" Character --- much different from the Fuller's ESB or Young's RamRod but just as enjoyable. I've noticed in DE that the Anderson Valley beers are quite a bit more expensive than most other micro's but I won't pass them up next time around."
"A very nice beer. This one poured out an orangey gold color and the thin foamy head laced the glass nicely. The aroma gives off a sweet grainy, almost fruity malt aroma. Theres a nice balance of light and fruity sweet malt in the taste along with a dry and grassy bitterness. Detected a bit of alcohol peeking through, along with some woody and earthy notes. Finishes with a perfect bitterness. A very nice ESB."
"overall, a great beer, not what i traditionally expect though from esb, this is a more crisp, clean, american take on the style."
"To sum up, this isn't that bad. But don't go out of your way to get this."
"Not a total failure, but a bit tedious given the excess ABV and lack of malt backing."
"Bottom line: Quite a nice west coast ESB."
"A strong bitter hop flavor is king in this beer, along with tasty pale malts, make this a well balanced brew. Tingle of carbonation on the tongue make for a very refreshing beer."
"Hazy orangey color with big brown flecks of something or other floating around in it. Big beige foamy head about an inch high just sitting there and not moving. Lots of spider web oily lacing all around the glass. Aroma is sweet malt and hops and citrus and pine. Flavor is hoppy and piney and citrusy and has an odd malt flavor to it, like it's spoiled. The malt is a bit off. Not at all what I think of in an ESB. More hoppy and citrusy and lighter colored."
"Notes: Big and tasty."
"Overall, not too bad of a brew. In fact, I rather enjoyed this even though I'm not a big fan of well-hopped beers. This is a nicely balanced beer."
"Golden in color with some orange hues and a thin, well-retained, off-white head. The aroma makes it obvious that hops are present. Lime and floral flavors show through with only the slightest hint of sweet maltiness. The hops really cover up much of the malt character, but a good ESB for the hopheads."
"Pours a light copper color with an off-white head (not too big). Smell low key evergreen hops (they kind of reminded me of Scotch Tape--weird), and subtle malts. Delicate, flowery malts up front, quickly eclipsed by huge, spicy Anderson Valley hops. Almost as big (hopwise) as Hop Ottin'. The similarities stop there, however. Doesn't have the sweet malt presence that Hop Ottin' does. Adequately balanced, but not exceptional."
"Mmmm...I must have caught a good batch of this brew. The dark golden yellow color was enhanced by a nice light hoppy and fruity smell. The head was beautiful and the lace stayed around the glass all the way down. Taste was tart initially with a great hop presence with a flowery characteristic. The tartness stayed just the right amount of time with a light malt presence, ending in a very crisp finish. Maybe it's just me, but when a super hopped presence ends with a nice clean finish I will go back for more. Needless to say, I thought the drinkability was good."
"A nice deep copper color, pours with a cream colored head. There is a slight amount of chill haze present. Smells malty with a bit of sourness to it, maybe some sort of musty character as well. There is lots of caramel malt character in this beer. It ends with nice amount of bitterness, and there is a sharp bitterness at the beginning to. There is not too much hop flavor or aroma in this beer. Though as it warms up a definite hop flavor starts to assert itself. This is a nice solid beer, but it could use a few more dimension to it. I expected a bit more hop flavor from this brewery. There is a bit of grassy - hoppy notes to it though. Some biscuity flavors to this beer as well."
"A white, fresh whip-cream head tops a light copper clear body. Nice lacing. The aroma is a burst of hops in both citrus and floral. The taste opens with a rich, deep caramelly malt foundation, and then the hops rise to first balance, and finally overtake then malt in the finish. Not as citrusy as most west coasters, the hops have some appropriate English qualities. This is hoppier than the typical English ESB though. This is another wonderfully solid beer from one of America's premier breweries."
"Slightly chill-hazed orange-colored brown, it offers a nose of minty, juniper-fleshed pinecone and caramel apples. On the palate it lounges about with downy richness while delivering stern, chipped-slate bitterness. The bubbles are so fine that it is impossible to register them individually, instead they pixillate to create images of whipped cream and roasted baba ganoush."
"Dayton, OH AleFest:This beer consisted of a small sized tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that quickly diminished.The body of this beer was clear and its hue was orange.The nose was very hoppy and malty.It had a very heavy bitter flavor to it that lingered for quite some time.The palate was tingly on my tongue and medium bodied.This beer was just too bitter for my taste."
"A cloudy, dull orange in color. Thick and creamy white head distinctly laces the glass. Aroma was of....sweet iced tea. Call me crazy but that's what I smelled. Taste was sweet at the start. Finished delightfully dry with a very noticable and pleasing bitterness. Alcohol well-hidden (6.8%) but peeks through from time to time. Medium-bodied with a very crisp and dry finish. A ""right tasty"" ESB (thanks to AKSmokedPorter for his eloquence). Good combination of flavors and the finish make for a much better-than-average ESB."
"Poured a very light orange color. Had a big frothy head that exploded quickly and fell in caverns and an uneven surface, and had some stain left behind. Smelled of nuts, wonderful fruity hops, some florals, and scents of bitterness. Had some woody notes and roasted flavors deep and cutting in scent. A fantastic smelling ESB. Taste was a wonderful bitter, fruity and firm-bodied and strongly bitter, with some good amber malt behind it all. Had some very strong earthy flavors - too strong? Hop oil flavors became a little noxious when it mixesd with these earthy and biting flavors. Not very drying but quite dis-tasting flavors in the finish. A smooth and firm ale mouthfeel unfortunately turned into an oily covering on my tongue. Regardless, a damn fine ESB."
"Pours with a cascading, sticky & lacey white head that settles over cloudy amber liquid. The nose is bready, malty and slightly spicy/sweet. Taste is of malt given a beat down by an ugly stick full of fresh flowery hop bitterness, with the malt becoming subservient to the mightily powerful flower. Finishes wonderfully bittersweet...a top American ESB, if not THE best!"
"Orange-amber color, frothy off-white head that leaves a nice sticky lace in my glass. Bready and citrusy aromas, bready caremel flavors, medium to full bodied with a somewhat rough mouthfeel, a bit unbalanced yet tasty. The hops really stand out in the end with a bitter finish, not bad."
"I liked this overall, pretty strong bitter and alcohol tastes, not a standout but very drinkable."
"It was recommended to me from a great source and one who likes big beers and hop head IPA's. He didn't disappoint. At first sip I realized what he meant when he said hoppy. It had a huge hop character of grapefruit rind that lasted well into the next sip. Body was good and did have a malt presence with some buttery caramel undertones. The color was great as well as the head. You could feel the alcohol after one so not a session beer for me and I'm sure many but definitely one to try if you like hops."
"Poured from a bomer, it's a good looking golden-orange with a fairly billowy white head. It smells more hoppy than most ESBs from the ""home country"" and also has nice note of biscuit. The taste is pleasant but not spectacular. The hops tend to dominate, though a nice yeasty flavor makes its presence known. The mouthfeel is creamy and it's quite drinkable."
"Medium Brown color, medium head. Aroma is malty, citrusy and buttery. A medium bodied ESB. Nice bitterness in this beer. Its not very malty, but its well balanced. Kind of what an ESB should be, kind of hoppy and bitter and juicy, Mouthfeel is full and round, Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is bitter"
"Not as caramelly as most ESBs, this one leads more toward the hop end of the spectrum. Appears a slightly hazed copper amber tone with an off white lucious two fingered head leaving lace as it settles a magnificant looking brew. Aroma consists of floral hops combined with a decent amount of balancing malt. Taste is piney with hop resin yet a contrasting bitterness balances out the brew almost perfectly, not completely characteristic of an ESB, but I love this beer a great counterpart to most any food the hops complement so much. The mouthfeel is medium bodied fluffy with some oily resins sliding on the tongue this beer is seductive. The drinkability for me well if I found it on tap at the right place this could be dangerous for me, but either way this is a great beer."
"Copper/ orange in color with a off-white head. Leaves an excellent amount of lacing. It has fruity, caramel malt and toasty aromas. The flavor is sweet, caramel malty and toasty, which flows to a fruity hop bitterness. A medium-full bodied beer that is easy drinking despite its size."
"Belk's is a very good bitter -- Bahl Steinber!"
"Good beer. Off white head and orangish brown w/ paler colored hues. Aroma is forceful--sweet, floral, and a touch of spices. Flavor is very bitter and very 'flowery' tasting...it has a nice aftertaste of alcohol and puckering bitters. Drinkable, but just eat something if your going to have more than one or two of these, the sourness might get to ya."
"Pours an awesome orangey cloudy amber, but because the head is overly active with large and small sudsy bubbles (couldn't pour it slow enough) I had to mark it down a notch. Nice floral hop aroma with a trace of yeasty clove. Medium malt body with bright and lively citrus hop bitterness. A hint of orange peel mixed with grapefruit seems to increase in potency throughout the glass. Alcohol becomes more pronounced later."
"Hazy golden orange color, topped with a finger's worth of nearly white foam that breaks down quickly into a sticky lace. Smell is not as strong as one might expect, though floral hops are predictably present as is an interesting spiciness. Taste is characterized by an immediate rush of floral hops that grow in bitterness before a dry warmth that fades very gradually. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. This is not a great ESB, but it's certainly a good one. Could use more balance and subtlety."
"The label claims ""Belk's stands as a perfectly balanced ESB"" and I definitely concur. I cannot understand the many reviews here that refer to this beer as just too hoppy. This beer should be sampled as a corrective to the brewers of so many hoppy American ales I've tasted that totally lack the malty/earthy/fruity balance that this beer showcases. Having said that, this beer certainly has big hops, just not to the exclusion of all other possible elements in the flavor profile. It puts the American west coast stamp on the English ESB, but with great success. Pardon my Boontling, but ""it's aplenty Bahl Steinber Horn."""
"Overall good but nothing too special, very drinkeable and a high abv."
"Fine ambery color, white head. Aroma? not much, really... a touch of citrus, and not much more. Taste is good, however, nice and smooth, and sweet and highly drinkable. We get some hoppy notes on the palate, some touches of grapefruit and ...it drinks well. Sorry, ESB is far from my favorite style, does very little for me, but for those who do like them, here it is..."
"$8.09 / 6-pack (a bit overpriced in my book - I only buy once a year for a Valentine's Day tradition)."
"Bright amber with full head that leaves lace. Mellow nose with some pleasant mustiness and good, grainy malts. Flavor is much too hoppy. If this was an IPA I could understand the bitterness, not to mention the alcoholic strength. I guess AV already has their IPA (and what a huge one it is) and this so-called ""bitter"" is just a step down from it. Doesn't qualify as a bitter, though, even though it is very bitter. A true English bitter is more balanced, with the malt playing perhaps the dominant role. Here, it takes a back seat to sharp spiky hops that are grassily pungent. Small sips as the beer mellows and warms give evidence to a nicely diverse malt profile, but you have to dig down deep to get past the blatant hops. Not being one who loves hops just for the sake of hops, I can't say I'm crazy about this. A true hophead may appreciate it much more."
"Backwash: In my opinion, a crude attempt at a true ESB. Sort of like a gangly man-child that isnt completely filled-out. Doesnt hold a candle to Fullers ESB, much less Youngs Ram Rod or SLA."
"Pours nice translucent amber to light copper color with a masterful head, creamy in its consistency and as it evanesces, the resultant lace fine clinging sheets to seal off the glass. A pleasant citrus crisp and clean start to the nose with just a hint of butter, malt sweet and a real treat to the senses. Start is ambrosial and the top middling in its feel to the palate, finish is generous in its hop spicy bite, the carbonation moderate and the aftertaste dry and lingering quite a pleasure to drink."
" If I had only 1 beer to drink, this one would be in the running. But what a horrible thought that is!"
"I don't think this was as good as Fuller's ESB, and it didn't come close to the Crooked River version, but it was still a decent beer. Amber/orange color with a thin head. Big hops aroma with faint citrus as well. Bitter flavor with a dry finish, hops was prevalent throughout which is a must in any ESB if you ask me. Worth getting again some day."
"It will take a good beer for me to commit Adultery."
"Well, the main reason I gave this beer a low mark on drinkabilty has to relate to the appearance. On the pour, there was an excessive amount of head. WAYYYY too much head. A very thick head, much like visiting inlaws, over stayed it's visit. When you have a good inch or two of thick head in your glass, it makes it near imposible to drink without having to clean your face off. Aside from that, it wasn't that bad. The 10-15 minutes it took when the head finally evapoarated (I'm not kidding) I was impressed with the great hop flavor and it's somewhat cloudy amber color. But the wait was just too unsatisfactory. If you want the 'got beer?' mustache, this is your brew, but other then that....I wouldn't waste much time to search this one out."
"This beer poured a slightly couldy golden color with very small bits of sediment present.  It formed a huge, nice white head that left some nice lace.  An aroma of malt, hop and caramel.  The flavor was of malt and caramel with a slight hint of hops.  A medium body finish that had elements of the caramel.  A good beer, it a tad sweet for my ESB tastes."
"Fresh as a daisy.  Handsome orange, amber, copper hues with a sturdy frothy white head.  Citrus peels, sappy hops, and a whisper of caramel sweetness in the background.  Another fabulously crafted beer from Anderson Valley Brewing."
"Cloudy, dark amber/orange color.  Big, white, lasting head.  Aroma is mildly floral and fruity.  This beer is full-force bitter; more than expected.  A very, very good, drinkable ESB."
"Slightly hazy orange brew topped by a billowy, dense and attractive head.  Big, earthy hop nose is followed by sweet caramel malt and fruity, licorice - like notes.  Hop bitterness is very assertive for style but quite enjoyable.  Hop flavor is surprisingly mellow, but can b discerned amongst the biscuit & crystal malt flavors.  Moderate to full in body for style, but just a touch overcarbonated.  Finishes w/ Willamette hop earthiness & hop bitterness of course.  This the the most bitter ESB I've had, perhaps even a bit rough, but is one very flavorful brew.  A nice American bastardization of the style."
"Belk’s ESB:  Very nice looking amber beer with an off-white head.  Very little aroma.  Surprisingly mild taste, not as much hops bite as I’d expected at all.  Some alcohol warmth, but this was not a lively or flavorful beer by my book."
"128"
"Yet another good offering from Anderson Valley.  Pours a nice orangey gold color with a small head that dissipated quickly.  Smells of hop bitterness and slight malt aroma.  Taste starts off as quite bitter but works its way to a nice balance with the malt as it warms.  Clean, smooth and crisp mouthfeel and highly drinkable.  Man, this is a real nice beer.  Great for some session drinking."
"No question this is an ESB, strong, hoppy after taste.  Very little aroma its all in the taste.  Alcohol not noticable even though it's on the high side.  Low carbonation.  If you like a bitter this one is for you but it is not my style."
"Notes: Big beefy American Style ESB these guys have dished out. Close to a strong ale in my opinion, alcohol is very noticeable. Certainly one of the biggest ESBs I have ever had the pleasure to try."
"Slightly hazy, amber/brown.  Big bubble, thin head that lasts.  Robust impact taster, hop bitterness, quite alcoholic.  Lots of flavor front to back but a little on the ""too bitter"" side and needing some balance to me. Real sticker of a mouthfeel, a little overdone, almost as if Anderson Valley is showing off too much."
"A assertive highly hopped ale. Not anything like English ale, but then what is. This is one of my favorite domestic breweries and this ale one of my  favorites.  I don't sound as enthused as I should because I don't think our micro brewers put out a real smooth ale on par with the British.  does anyone else feel this way?"
"A big, but very smooth, drinkable ESB. A nice interpretation of the style. Another solid offering from AV."
"One of the best bitters."
"Very sweet aroma, almost like cotton candy, but the sweetness was not carried in the flavor, which had a citrus finish.  Very assertive."
