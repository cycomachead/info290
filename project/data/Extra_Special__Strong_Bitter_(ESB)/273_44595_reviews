"This beer was a really good beer. I enjoyed this beer. I liked the cream color, and the fluffy amber color head that it has. I enjoyed the pine citrus hops smell that it had. It had a dry finish with this beer. I could taste the pine, citrus, floral, earthy hops that it has. It also had a caramel sweetness to it that I liked a lot as well."

"Quite bitter & hoppy with a nice balance of hops & malts. Pine & grass w/ grapefruit flavors. The usual good quality from Sweetwater. This would be a decent occasional brew when a better selection is not available."

"Overall, a very nice beer from Sweetwater. Really fits the fall season and a nice alternative to pumpkin brews and Oktoberfests."

"The feel is a bit bubbly but smooth, nicely crisp but a touch light."

"The Motor Boat...love motor boating...is a great beer. It poured a rich clear amber with thin white head that is leaving some lace. The scent is fresh bitter hop with a touch of sweetness...not sure if its of caramel or citrus nature....perhaps a combo of both. The taste starts and finishes with a very nice sweetness....the middle is a punch of bitterness that is lovely. There is a presence of caramel, biscuit and pine. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall....I really like this one...its bitter yet sweet...much like my wife."

"Overall: Haven't really had too many ESBs but this one is okay. Not something I'd want a 6 pack of but worth a try if you like ESBs..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I enjoy this more than any other ESB I've ever had but I think that's due to the overly hoppy take on the style. Although the word ""bitter"" is part of the acronym, ESBs are generally not this bitter. This is more of a dark pale ale (if that makes any sense) IMO but, regardless of what Sweetwater wants to call it, it's very good. I admit, when I bought this variety 12-pack, the ESB was what I was desiring the least but now I know I'm thoroughly enjoying every beer in the box."

"This offering pours a slightly hazy amber with a one finger off white head, decent retention, and excellent lacing. The nose is primarily citrus, especially oranges with some pine, and resin there too. Taste delivers the bitterness upfront and the sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel is good with no aftertaste to speak of. A pretty decent beer."
"O: Enjoyable and well balanced, pairs well with many different foods. While it has an American twist with the use of the pine and citrus hops, this still keeps a somewhat authentic British feel to it. Definitely worth trying."

"O= This is a solid beer from a style I don't think is done enough. An easy drinking ESB is the cure for whatever ales ya. This baby is the cure that's for sure. Makes me wanna go motor boat."
""

"O: Overall a nice well-balanced fall beer. Always look forward to this one."

"Had while out and about at my buddy’s bachelor party! Tick all day, every day! Served from tap into a Samuel Adams sampler shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spice, earth, earth hop, spicy hop, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, spice, earth, spicy hop, earth hop, bread, and floral hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I have to say that I was quite surprised that I have not reviewed this one yet. There was a really nice few things going on in the flavor of this one with the bread and floral hop notes that kept my palate looking for what was going to happen next. This fact definitely made it rather easy to drink and enjoyable throughout. Definitely worth your time trying if you get the chance."

"O. Very well balanced. Smooth but refreshing. Not over the top with hops. Mild acidic aftertaste is only drawback."

"12 oz bottle poured into a glass mug initially produced a good 3 finger light tan colored head that slowly dissipated to 1 finger head and left plenty of lacing. The color is a dark amber that is not quite clear and somewhat cloudy. There was slight carbonation and fine bubbles. The taste is a definitive ESB with a slight bitter aftertaste. I my opinon, not as good as the Red Hook ESB, but still a good ESB. Worth another try."

"D: Decent drinking, but not exactly what I think of for the style. Seems more like a pale ale to me"
"Georgeous copper colored beer with a massive, lasting lightly tanned colored head. Subtle aromas of caramel, biscuit, herbal and just a touch of grass. The flavor follows the aroma in it's subtleness but is a bit more complex. Caramel and sweet with just enough spicy herbal hops to make it interesting. Light mouthfeel yet crisp and slick. This is a flavorful beer and an easy drinker. I wish I had more."
"Overall Impression- First of all, what style is this? The sweetness is way to strong and way to overpowering... Needed to be more balanced with hop. I probably won't be even giving this one another chance and not sure if you should either... Sorry Curtis but this one wasn't my favorite."
"D: This is one of the better Sweetwater beers that I've had to date.  Well balanced and tasty from start to finish.  Not overly bitter at all, and possibly a bit out of style, but really an easy drinking beer that I'd love to get more of.  "
"O: Over all a pretty solid ESB here. Wouldn't mind visiting this one again."
"Probably not as bitter as the style would suggest, but it nice just to have a well crafted balanced ale. I am happy I picked this brew up."
"The beer pours a hazy amber color with a foamy tan head. The nose gives a piney hop profile. As to flavor, it really is an ESB as the label suggests, but with the hop character of an American IPA. It has a medium body that originally covers the tongue with malt sweetness before changing to a bitter and dry hop finish. The bitterness lingers nicely for quite a while."
"Very drinkable. Doesn't explode with flavor, but a decent option when I am looking for something sessionable and malty thats not a malt bomb"
"O: I enjoyed this beer. Well crafted and easy to drink."
"Overall: I really enjoyed the citrus notes in this one. More hops than I expected from an ESB. I would have another."
"O: Good beer; recommended. Drinkable despite the bitterness. Refreshing."
"Interesting combo of leafy, bittering hops and rich malty flavors. Very drinkable, goes down almost too easy. Toffee is practically burnt in its lingering toastiness. Interesting take on a summer seasonal, certainly not floating the mainstream. Its tasty, but different than most ESB's. Kinda like an ESB meets a Marzen. I could see myself buying a sixer of this each year, but certainly no more than that."
"This is really a nice beer. A nice change of pace from other ESBs and other fall offerings."
"Alright beer. I wouldn't buy it again personally, but I wouldn't refuse one if offered."
"O: Nice straightforward bitter, a little on the sweeter side. This is an easygoing everyday beer for me."
"O - A fairly good ESB. Nothing outstanding, but good for the price"
"O: Dudes are right round the bend, did a solid on this."
"Overall: This one feel a little short for me because of the flavor but with that being said it is definately worth a try."
"all in all, a fair ESB. a bit hoppy for my liking - or rather - lacking in malt, but it's certainly tasty and an enjoyable brew."
"Overall: I haven't figured sweetwater out yet. I feel like the are sort of middle of the road but I really like this brew."
"Prickly as it enters, watery mid body, and an oily finish. Not that impressed by this one."
"D - It starts out strong with an unusually nice appearance and an aroma that is encouragingly close to spot-on for a traditional ESB. Things kind of fall apart in the finish as the malt is too dark and lacking in subtly, while the hops are mostly bitterness with an oddly woody note. Not bad for an American ESB, but in the grand scheme of things it really doesn't hold a candle to the proper, British versions of the style."
"O- A really nice seasonal from Sweetwater. Tasty, affordable, easy drinking, and a style that you don't see a ton of from American breweries."
"O: I was surprised how much I liked this beer (normally I consider ESBs an inferior style). It was definitely easy to drink and had a surprising complexity to it."
"Overall, this is an extremely drinkable ale. Fruity, sweet, and bitter. Now it's time to pour another."
"Notes: A good, solid beer from Sweetwater. Thanks to Steven and Allison for bringing it along!"
"Overall a decent try, misses some of the yeast esters typical of an english yeast strain."
"overall a very solid ale and one that could be drank over and over with much ease. no trouble here at all."
"Smells bready and tangy, with toasted, nutty and leafy notes as well. Rather hoppy for the style, with a fair amount of citrus and pine flavors, plus a distinct leafy bitterness. All this hoppy business distracts from the bready and nutty malts. A tasty beer, although one that frankly tastes more like an east coast IPA than an ESB, and I'm docking points accordingly."
"This beer is a tarnished copper color with a head to be proud of. It has a toasty, sweet malt aroma with a healthy herbal hop twang in the back. It's sublimely smooth and perhaps a tad slick. With toasted grain all around, there are quick flashes of caramel sweetness and more of a dried grassiness in the end. The tamed hops add some spiciness and a mildly bitter, herbal flavor. There's also vague fruitiness within the folds. It finishes relatively dry, with that dried grass, toasted grain flavor. This is an off-base seasonal. We love it because the norm doesn't need to be the path for everyone."
"Pours a deep russet brown color with a thick white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells of bitter citrus hops and some large amounts of orange. Tastes bitter from the hops, a little sweet from the malts, and a little biscuit and some hidden citrus. Mouthfeel is medium and there is plenty of carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"D: Very drinkable, good flavor and hop presence."
"A well-executed placement within the style, perhaps leaning just a bit toward an Americanized hoppyness. Pleasant moderately roasted caramel malt, quickly followed by firm, slightly resinous hops flavor. Quite smooth and a good session ale candidate."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is toffee with some orange citrus hops. I also get a little bit of chocolate, which I was not expecting. The flavor is heavy on the toffee malt but there are some citrus hops to keep the beer nice and balanced. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"An appealing first mouthful, and lots of flavors. Settles down to an astringent bitterness that keeps it from being really likable."
"M- Vastly overcarbonated. This beer is sharp and painful on the tongue. It has a slick finish."
"D= They go down pretty easy and have a lower ABV than I'm use to so decent beer for not being to strong."
"OVERALL: If the smell of beer was equivalent to the cover of a book, this would be the gold standard in not judging a book (or a beer) by its cover. The taste turns out to be far different from the smell and unlike some other ESBs, the Motorboat is genuinely bitter. Although, the bitterness does level out at the end of each sip. At 5.6% it might be a bit much to be considered a true session beer, but it is easy to imagine a hot summer evening in the southeast with a six-pack of Motorboats."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid beer from a local brewery that I've come to love. I'm happy to be one of the first 100 to review this, and I'm even happier that my local store has a steady supply of it. While I may not buy a six pack of it, I'll definitely revisit it in a mixer every now and then. Another good offering from Sweetwater."
"This is a very pleasant blend of caramel-like malt with a flowery hop smell. This continues through the taste, although the hops are more prickly. The aftertaste is bitter but doesn't last forever Rich mouthfeel with a light spritz in the carbonation. A wonderfully blended beer."
"Very good effort from Sweetwater"
"D - This is a pretty good beer but not outstanding."
"This is a pretty colored brew, pouring a thick, light brown head of fluff. Took a good two minutes until I could see the top of the beer. Color rates a great 22 on the SRM scale. Smell of caramel, spice, apple, malt, and hops. Good rich, bold taste of citrus, caramelized wheat, sweet malt, and a bitter hop finish. Lots of rich feel across my tongue and the back of my throat. This is a good bitter ale, lots of flavor and body, give me another. Got it in the Sweetwater tackle box, so I have two more. Yea!!!"
"Went to my local brew-spot and had a pint or three of this Sweetwater Original. Color was dark red. I couldn't see through it but I don't know the significance of that in this style of beer. Good inch and a quarter thick head. Smell was somewhat dull, not a lot there. Not a heavy beer, sat on the stomach like a light beer (didn't feel like I had eaten a meal). New experience for me, the second gulp was significantly better than the first one. Had me ready for another sip. The only major downer I could recognize was when I burped it released this awful smelling fume (kinda like rotten vegetables). Lacing was weak, and I believe I definitely have this one a time or two more."
"This isn't a bad beer by any means, but it's overpowering in the carbonation department. A couple good swirls has forced it to calm down a bit & I'm liking it more. The taste is pretty quite good."
"There was a nice bitter flavor followed up with some sweet malts. This to me would be more hop forward than most ESB I have drank. It had good carbonation and I enjoyed drinking it. The problem I have with this brew was it meddled for the style. I just don't think it that true to a ESB. I guess that's why I don't judge at the GABF."
"All in all, this is not a very good brew. It's a bitter, yet, it's not bitter. Kind of defeats the purpose of the style IMO. Don't worry about this one."
"Overall, a nice little beer.. I could drink several of these and be ok.."
"Mouthfeel ws somewhat dry and easy to drink. This was a solid ESB."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is subtle bitter hops in front of mild sweet malts. The taste is eathy hops just overpowering mild sweet caramel malts. The beer is light, crisp and refreshing. This is a decent ESB, but not one I would likely pick that often."
"D- Without a very complex taste, against that nose, it loses drinkability points for me"
"D: Very drinkable, good flavor and hop presence."
"D-Really nice easy drinking beer. I really like this as a ""summer beer"" and could see it being a nice fishing beer."
"My keg fridge is about 20% for me and 80% for making my friends who visit happy and festive. This beer was a huge hit with guests last night when tapped. I loved it last night and even more today. Its flavorful and smooth with a great pour into ceramic mug. I don't want it to run out which is always the best quality a home keg beer can have."
"Really enjoying this one, kudos Sweetwater!"
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1 3/4"" beige head above the slightly cloudy copper brew. Super-dense head is going nowhere fast at all, with coating, sticky lacing. Aroma is fruity and lightly sweet. Taste starts where the nose left off, sweet and citrus, with a lightly earthy hops close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Nice one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, very easy drinking and tasty ESB."
"Pours a slightly hazy red orange color with a two finger fluffy beige head that persists forever. Smells of citrus right off, I'm thinking grapefruit, but that aroma disappeared quickly. Some caramel and a bit of spicy, minerally esters waft up towards my nostrils as well. At first smell it was a dead ringer for an American IPA, but as it sat the nose definitely morphed into a more English bitter leaning animal. Taste is malty with caramel and brown bread, minerally with that English hop flair but an almost citrusy hop bite in there as well. Medium to high carbonation, medium body with a watery/syrupy mouthfeel. This is a weird little beer that I really enjoyed. It's like an Americanized version of an esb that is still true to its English roots."
"The good balance here is what made it work for me, with a healthy dose of spicy bitterness that kept things interesting and just enough malts and citrus flavor to keep it in check. Nice little take on the style."
"My first tasting from Sweetwater, and definitely not disappointed. Not the best one I've ever had, but a very drinkable ESB."
"This is a very nice beer. The big smell is not too hoppy in the taste."
"Silky smooth mouth with nice midlevel carbonation. Super session beer and very easy to drink. Well Done!"
"Very easy to drink. Stronger than expected body brings it down just a tad."
"This is one I could drink more than my share in one seating."
"Reddish copper hue under a fat, sturdy head. Smells pretty green with a toasted grainy sweetness underneath citrus and grass. Sweet malt flavor balanced with tea-like and juicy citrus hops. Not really something to compare to authentic ESBs, this is more like a solid amber ale to me. The mouthfeel is gritty and creamy thanks to the low carbonation, finishing dry and bitter. Again, there's way too much green, hoppy bitterness for this to be a good ESB - this is American-style stuff - but it's pretty tasty whatever it is, so I have trouble faulting it..."
"Pours a hazy copper with two finger cream colored head, nice lacing. Smell: citrus and earthy hops, mostly citrus, backed by caramel sweetness. Taste: grapefruit, pineapple, toffee, leafy, earthy. A nice hoppy esb, but with the citrus it feels more like a caramel heavy ipa."
"I think this is my first ESB, so I can't judge according to the style. From what I gather from most of the reviews this is not at all your typical ESB, so I'll have to sample some others. Whether or not to style, it's a tasty brew!"
"Quite tasty if a bit hoppier than I expected. I don't know a lot about ESBs but you could easily drink a few of these beers. I think a bit more malt in the bill might make it a bit more to my liking but Southern beers tend to, perhaps understandably, be somewhat on the light side in body."
"Man I like a good ESB and there just isnt enough around!This poured into a standard pint glass a clear bronze color with a tight formed one finger white head that settled into a soapy-like mass,aromas were malt tilted with caramel/biscuit,brown sugar, and juicy fruit malt notes,only a slight ""green"" herbal hop presence is felt.Flavors start out with dark""ish"" fruit and caramle with a slight toastiness,a srying leafy hop presence comes thru late.A solid ESB more malt driven, but it does have a hop presence,well done."
"This brewery-fresh ale is extremely well balanced and contains enough flavor to appeal to staunch beer enthusiasts, but refined enough to win over the swill swiggers as well. With a blend of American and English malt and hops, it easily appeals to a large audience."
"An okay ESB, although I would prefer the version from England. This one had a good amount of hops, with a decent amount of malts, but not enough balance in my opinion."
"Overall the wet-hopping influenced this beer more than the cask conditioning as the carbonation levels were almost identical to the draught version. Regardless, this beer was hoppy already but the extra Chinook pushed it to a new level. I can't wait to try Wet Dream after tasting this."
"D: I would like to have one or three of these a night. Not something to drink a 6 pack of in one sitting but very enjoyable."
"Drinkability- Tasty brew that I did enjoy quite a bit. I do like ESB's quite a bit and although maybe it's not prototypical, it is tasty. I'm also bumping the score a half a point for the awesome name and hilarious quote on the side. Thanks much Marc you motor boatin son a'bitch!"
"Notes: Only my second English Bitter and what can I say, this must be one of my more favorite styles. This beer tastes very nicely balanced and very good overall."
"The smell is reminiscent of all of the other Sweetwater Pale ale varieties that I have had the pleasure to try. Very noticable citrus hop scent, backed by a lightly roasted caramel sweetness. All of this is mirrored in the taste. A nice roastiness to it, but the flavor falls short. I understand that this style is not meant to be a hop bomb but I wish there was less balance in this area. That's not to underplay this beer because the lemon and light grapefruit comes out really nicely in the taste, I just wish there was more there. Another decent offering from Sweetwater."
"Drinkability: A bit too sweet to be a classic but rather enjoyable"
"Misses the boat as an ESB. No malt character or no apple or pear notes that I look for in a good ESB. Way too hoppy for style."
"Overall, this beer is a little over-hopped, and leaves something to be desired on the malt side of things. It is a tasty beer, but not really what I would prefer in an ESB."
"M/D: A nice sessionable ESB that I wouldn't mind having again. A solid beer."
"Pretty good, but not as bitter as it could be. Overall, very drinkable. The texture is full as well."
"D: Very smooth for craft drinkers but novices may have a problem with the thickness."
"Future outlook: For a beer that is past it's prime, this has held up pretty well, with no off or offensive flavors. I'd love to try it fresh to see if the sweetness is met with more balance. All things considered, a solid showing, and one that leaves me interested in trying more Sweetwater product should it become available to me."
"This one pours out like Lipton Raspberry iced tea. Brown/red and mostly clear. Not much carbonation, but it has a 1/2"" bubbly light tan head. Nose is mild bitter hops, and a slight almond spiciness. Taste is gentle bitterness, leafy green dry hops, mild fruit up front with some lingering hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice on this one, despite undercarbonation."
"This is quite a good session effort - goes down easy but with enough heft to keep y'all honest. A perfect ESB for hop whores. Bring it on!"
"D: very nice, I did expect a little more out of this though. A good ESB but nothing fantastic."
"M/D - While I think this one is easily drinkable and not bad, nothing really stands out and seem awfully light for an ESB"
"3.5/3.5/4/3.5/3.5"
"Good effort Sweetwater!"
"Perfectly balanced. Another nice beer. I'd put this in the live-well of my Crestliner any day of the week. Like to try their barleywine next time it arrives on the scene."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Good amount of carbonation and a slightly thin medium body makes this one go back like water."
"Drinkability is pretty good. A decent sessionable beer. This tastes a little more like a American Pale, than an ESB. But it's still tasty enough to be worth trying. Nothing special... but a solid ""B"."
"Overall, I cannot comment on how the beer might be true to style. ESB is just not a style I can say that I am very familiar with. However, Sweetwater does not seem to be going for that here. Instead they are going for a very Americanized strong ale somewhat inspired by the British ESB. The beer is certainly easy considering its higher ABV (somewhere around 7), but in the end it just seems to lack a defining characteristic to make it stand out as a truly great beer."
"D: It drinks fairly easily, but is a bit too confused to be great. I appreciate Sweetwater trying to branch out and create something different, but I think the idea of a super-hopped ESB was doomed to fail from the start. The hop-tastic start gives way to a really weak attempt at a good ESB's balance and nuance. It's still not a bad beer, and I'd drink it for a change of pace every once in a while. It's a nice option for a time when I don't want to full-on commit to their IPA, but still want enough hops to whet my whistle."
"Aroma is strong and malty with a firm hoppy undertone and a decided hint of molasses. Color is a beautiful, clear, appetizing copper with an off-white and fairly persistent head. Mouth-filling flavor is fairly but not fiercely bitter, and has just a whisper of sweetness as well as a nutty undertone. Texture is exceptionally smooth so it goes down very nicely."
"Overall: thanks ding"
"Burnt orange color was nice to look at, and the body was mostly clear with some lingering haze. The head was thin, like a rim of bubbles mostly. The smell was sweet and citric, and nothing like any ESB. It was too fruity and perfumey to be considered even close. The taste was spicy, earthy, honey sweet, and slightly soured. The mouthfeel was very chalky and a bit harsh. Not a bad beer per se, but way off target for the style, and not very sessionable."
"Drinkability: An E.S.B. this is. It's very balanced, perhaps even on the malty side of the E.S.B. nation, and though I have no clue what the abv% is, I'd guess it's not higher than 6.5%, which isn't eminently unreasonable. That being said, it's not my favorite E.S.B., nor is it one of Sweetwater's best brews, though it is respectable."
"Pours a clear amber with reddish hues. Steady carbonation and a great head that keeps its retention and leaves steady lacing down the glass. Smell is nothing like an ESB to me but I still enjoy it. Some citrus hops similar to what you'd find in their IPA. It reminds me more of a harvest ale or hoppy amber than what it is. Still, I'm a fool for the hops. I feel like there is some Centennial in here, which is always a good thing. Taste is just the same. More hoppy than anything. Big and citrusy with a light caramel and biscuity touch. I like it but can't give it much credit for the style. Good crisp mouthfeel, basically on the light side with a minor bitterness. This is close to session material in my book, though as said not exactly your standard ESB. Sweetwater does this from time to time and I don't really mind. The bottom line is they make some quality brews, whatever style they may or may not be. Glad I bought a sixer, that's for sure."
"Not the best example of the suggested style, but an all-around great beer nevertheless. Very drinkable and highly recommended."
"D- Great beer, would be a great session brew. Solid all around beer."
