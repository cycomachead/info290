"My favorite esb."
""
""
"Not a bad brew, in taste or in presentation, but I'm not getting enough crisp, biscuity notes, or heightened noble hops, to take this one at its word.  More of a typical (if still well-made) American-style amber ale - something I'd like in my corner when taking down a pile o' hot wings."

"Malty but plenty of hops to balance it and at times the hops take over. A nice interpretation of the style with ample malt flavor lacking an overriding sweetness."

"An appreciable ESB, even if It is more or less an Americanized version of the style (think a slightly more biscuity and buttery APA with less sweetness and way less hop aroma). This beer is hop forward on the tongue but still balanced. The aroma is to style but a little faint. Color is thinner and lighter than a classic ESB but still a nice hue. The carbonation is nice and bright. I like the beer enough to enjoy it occasionally."

"Mouth: Thin and a little under carbonated. Swallows dry, but leaves a lingering astringency on the tongue."

"A well-balanced, very drinkable beer. Malts and hops mingle well together and offer a delightful, well-rounded beer for those looking for a fuller bodied ale."
"Pours a light copper color with a white cap. Aroma of stewed hops, mineral and wet dog. In the taste, toffee, herbal hops, butterscotch. Mild but persuasive bitterness adds a good character to the taste. Medium to light bodied, medium carbonation with good retention. Overall, this is a nice little esb, that actually packs more of a punch than most."

"Overall Drinkability: I didn't expect a whole lot out of this, since ESBs normally don't wow me, but I would drink a few of these with no problem."
""
"I've come to really love this brewery and this was no disappointment at all, given the subdued nature of this style. They totally pulled it off as far as I'm concerned - it tastes very refreshing and very British from start to finish. I could easily drink this one all day given the desire. I don't understand the low marks on this one, frankly, unless people were just expecting something other than an ESB."
""
"Pours an orange golden with a nice foamy cream colored head and decent lacing. Aroma is floral, doughy, caramel, light toffee,a little lemon and a kiss of some grassy hops. Flavor is bready and caramel along with some mildly bitter grassiness and maybe a littler herbal. A crisp, somewhat creamy, medium bodied. Overall, surprised I hadn't rated this prior but at least finally getting around to it. Definitely a solid brew by Ska one of my favorite of their regular offerings."
""
""
""
"O: An enjoyable can of English-style ale, packing a ton of flavor into just 12 oz. of low-alcohol product. If getting a six-pack didn’t involve crossing state lines, I’d have no qualms about buying a good bit of this."
""
""
""
"A solid all around ESB. Hops are more pronounced than it's English counterparts. The citrus plays off the malt well and makes for a hopped up bready ESB."
""
"a clean copper pour with a finger of bright white head which left behind some nice lacing and a nice white foamy ring around the rim of the glass. the smell is of malt mostly, tea leaves, slight bitterness reminiscent of grapefruit peel. the flavor, again is mostly malt, not getting much of the bitterness until the aftertaste, but it isn't of grapefruits this time around it is subtle and almost grassy herbal like from the hops. medium in body with mid carbonation. this is a decent esb from ska, i can see this honestly being excellent on cask, however out of a can (which i think is a bit too cold) is not as great as it probably could be."

"A solid brew that goes down nicely. The aroma and flavour are primarily malt-driven, though a hint of hoppy pine makes itself known. The body is lovely and velvety-smooth. It doesn't quite fit the profile of an English ESB - the malt character is less fruity and complex than it should be and the aromatic hops don't match the style either. However, it is certainly very drinkable and well worth sampling if you should come across it."

"Overall, this has grown on me. I'd like to give a shake on tap sometime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing really special here, but if the Floral Hops and flavor overall had been more balanced out this could've been a really good ESB."
""
"I grabbed one of their mixed 12 packs yesterday: first crack at this beer. As this beer is pretty straightforward, I'll keep my review pretty simple. It represents the style well. There is a mild, lingering bitterness that balances bready malts. This is a respectable session ale."
"Part of a mixed 12 pack enjoyed on the beach in the Outer Banks. A nice solid, all around beer. Medium bodied with some caramel notes and malty sweetness, some decent hop presence upfront with a nice clean finish. Not particularly my favorite style, but this one was pretty well done and well balanced and I would try it again for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall, a deliciously well balanced brew. Maybe the best brew Ska makes. Maybe ..."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is an interesting ESB. It has a rather bready, bold, forward malt character. It has a very citrusy hop character. It's also a bit sweet and not bitter at all. It's incredibly drinkable and incredibly refreshing. This could probably pass for an APA for most breweries. It's worth looking into."
""
"A nice ESB, definitely Americanized with more aggressive hops a less of the subtle malt depth of the British variety. Pours deep Amber with an off-white head. Big herbal hoppiness, grassy with an earthy note. Nice thick caramel and biscuit malt backbone. Bitter edge on the finish. Another good beer from a can at an even better bar. Star Bar Denver, CO."

"nice beer from ska, pours a really nice caramel color, clear as day, with a one inch thick white head that has some moderate retention ability. looks great in a schooner at euclid hall denver. smells off, kind of vinegary or something, definitely a malty beer, but does not smell too appetizing. flavor is much much better, nice english malt profile, caramel notes and the flavors even of a brown ale, roasty and sweet a little bit. finishes clean. feel was nice, medium bodied with relaxed carbonation. an excellent session ale. overall nice brew, not a huge esb guy, but this was really enjoyable."
"A very solid ESB, it could stand to be more hoppy, but very refreshing and enjoyable nonetheless."

"Poured into DFH pint glass. Appears a clear orange with 1 cm of white head that dissipates quickly. Decent lacing left behind. The aroma is heavy with earthy hops along with notes of pine and cedar. The taste is somewhat subdued with mild earthy bitterness followed by caramel malts and a bit of sweetness on the finish. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. Overall, there is a decent amount of flavor in this brew but it does not stand out as being particularly tasty."
""
"From a can to a duvel tulip. Pours a clear caramel with an inch thick off white head. Average lacing. Aroma is biscuit, malt, and light citrus. Flavor is bitter up front and moves to a bready malty taste. There's some toffee and caramel there as well. Mouthfeel is thin and slightly sticky. Not a bad esb."
""
"Overall - The B in this one is definitely for balanced. There are some really nice crisp and refreshing flavors going on here. Looks nice in a glass too, a very good session beer. Get the 12pk can sampler and also enjoy their killer APA, Modus Hoperandi."
""

""
"Thanks Gawnphishin!!!"
"The ESB from SKA is a true English Bitter. The beer pours a orange copper with thin white head that leaves a spotty lace. The smell is english bittering hops. The taste is a light malt trying to balance against a english hops. The mouthfeel is a medium body with good carbonation. Overall it is a taste beer."
""
"O. Overall, a solid beer and a nice example of the style. I could throw back a few more of these."
"This is a good beer, definitely enjoyable."

"O- Good example of a english esb. but others are better. i recommend trying if you like the syle. 5.7% abv hides good. good price too at $8 a sixer. Another solid offer from ska brewing."

"Great every day beer for fall, spring temperatures when you're not in the mood for strong IPA. Really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - Middle of the road. Doesn't shine. Off-characters aren't dominating, but are definitely annoying."
"Of course, there is plenty of bitterness with a good tingling sensation on the tongue and a great clean finish."
"Oh, bother."
"I really enjoyed this beer for some reason, even though I kinda been taught that bottle beer is better, I can honestly argue that with beers like this coming out of a can."
"O: Solid beer, that didn't impress me at first, but the longer I sip it the more I like it."
"D - Not being a real fan of ESB's to begin with, I found that I enjoyed this one more than most. Having said that, the hops just didnt seem to be present in this one, tasting more like an amber ale than anything. I'll have to come back to this as I explore the style more."
"Good beer and a great style. I feel the average B rating is partially because craft drinkers expect more than the bitter style delivers. What do I know though..."
"OVERALL: This has got to be one of the strongest flagship beers out there. Well, that is, if Modus isn’t now considered their flagship beer. Either way, this is a strong, readily available beer. If I am having a hard time deciding what to get at a bar I almost always go for either the Modus or the ESB, they are excellent beers, particularly for the price point. At $8.99 a 6-pack and usually $5 or less at the bar (in Chicago) you could do a lot worse for your money."
"Very easy to drink with no trace of alcohol. I enjoyed this one."
"Second tasting of the day from Ska. Overall this is a decent brewry (the other beer was the motis hop...). They seem spot on with their own take on this ESB and the american IPA. The look is pretty standard ESB golden brown with creamy head that dissapates. The smell is grainy funky although I prefer more fruit in the ESB's (yes a flaw!). There is also a faint whiff of alcohol. I'm not sure why at this ABV. The taste is malt butter with a different hoppiness than an ESB like Fullers. Not bad. Great value for the 12 pack I bought. I don't mind the cans, but check out PBR and go back to the drawing board on the graphics."
"Appearance is amber with a one finger beige head. The smell has bread, caramel, malts, and faint hops. Ska`s esb tastes fairly sweet, with more of that caramel from the nose, also some light tropical fruit. Its` bitterness is fairly subdued, and a body that leans towards thin. This is a decent ESB and it would quench you thirst on a summer day."
"Overall Impression- Brews from Ska are always above average but this one was right around the average ESB... Nothing really grabbed my attention but wasn't necessarily a bad brew.. I would definitely grab 1 or 2 of these when going on a float trip or camping but would rather have the canned Modus Hoperandi!"
"Ugh, the bitterness was there but not accompanied by any balance or pleasant flavors, I would contend that the malt is here due to the color and sweetness but there's no real mesh with the herbal hop flavors and odd citric notes."
"Taste, pretty good, some bitter and hops, really couldn't differentiate this between an esp and a pale ale. Citrus hop, pale and caramel malt flavor, seems like a pale to me. Very well carbonated. A decent brew, nothing groundbreaking, maybe not dry enough to be a true esb, but I've always found esb's to be like pales with less hops."
"A splendid British ESB with an very gentle American twist!"
"O. Well, I've downed one of them far more quickly than I probably should and I'm about to open another. Very easy to drink."
"D - this British inspired ale would be just the thing on a cool Fall evening. has enough flavor to be an interesting beer but has a low enough alcohol content to enjoy more than one."
"The beer was a copper color with a thin off-white, soapy looking head. It smells a bit sour with hints of lemon and caramel. The taste has a lemony bitterness up front followed by a sweetness that is washed over by a biscuit flavor. There is a pleasant lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. It feels a little watery, the carbonation's ok and the finish is dry. This is an easy drinking beer with lots of flavor. I enjoyed it and would drink it again, it's well balanced and very drinkable."
"Drinkable, but not something I'm going to search for in the future, not because this beer is off-putting, but because ESBs are not a beer I typically enjoy. This particular ESB is moderately above average for an ESB; while it fits the style, it doesn't offer any new take and it doesn't distinguish itself from the others."
"Can into a snifter...an ESB it's not, but it's a decent beer, better than indicated by the rating. Decent head on it on top of the right color body for the style. However, it's not nearly dry enough or bitter enough. This would be more properly called a pale ale"
"D) An alright brew. I don't think I'd have another one."
"3/3"
"Pours dark burnt orange with a slightly off-white head. Head is average sized but dissipates slowly and leaves some chunky lacing. Scent, honestly, there's not a whole lot there, some murky malts but that's all I'm getting. Taste is nicely balanced, pleasantly subtle is how I would describe it. Earthy malt profile with some nice citrusy hop tones up front. On the light side of medium with a clean finish. ESB was a style I never understood, and then it clicked today as to what exactly it was supposed to be and I felt stupid. With my new found understanding of the style this seems to be a good example. Goes down easy and I'm happy to keep throwing them back. Got this in a variety pack and definitely could have gone for more than the four that were in there."
"Notes: Would buy again in a single can, not in a 6er. Not bad, but not in my top picks in its style."
"if this was on tap at the local pub I would have it, it isn't the greatest beer in the world but man sitting around shootin the shite drinking this and BSing with buds ? this works."
"Pours a golden amber color as the scent of hops erupt from pouring into a chilled pint glass. Drinking past the decent head there is a semi-mild bitter taste to it. No where near as bitter as an IPA however. A nice hoppy taste that makes this beer fairly decent."
"Thanks to tr4nc3d for this one as an extra in a past trade. Served from can into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Poured hazy yellow orange with a minimal white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, hops, and a slightly nutty note. The flavor was of only sweet malt and hops. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice ESB. Had a very well balanced flavor and nice aroma. However I feel the flavor and aroma was a little simple and not very complex. If there would have been more complexity to this one it could have been something quite special. Still a nice brew that I am glad I got the opportunity to try."
"D - this is a pretty good ESB. I don't know if I would particularly seek this one out, but I know I will buy it again at some point."
"drinkability: fine"
"This ""Four Corners"" brew poured a clear medium amber from a 12oz can with a two fingered off white head with some light lacing. Aromas of malt and grains with a touch of hops. A malty citrus on the palette with a bitter metallic finish, good carbonation in a medium body that paired well with a smoked trout pate on whole wheat toast. Yeah right! Decent enuf brew for more than one."
"D - A good drinkable beer and glad it is in cans. Good Pairing with saltier foods."
"While this isn't the most mind-blowing ESB I've ever had, it's certainly serviceable and gets bonus points for being canned. If you're determined to try one of Ska's beers, I'd point you towards the Modus Hoperandi, though you could certainly do worse than this beer. It won't blow your socks off by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a serviceable entry into the ESB category."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops and grains. Taste is a good balance of malts and hops, some grains. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality beer."
"Golden to slightly amber in color. Dense head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is lightly toasted bread with some lactose sweetness. Toasted grain front with light carbonation tingle. Maltly middle with bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a tad chewy, consistent with style. Very drinkable in anything but very hot weather."
"Very, very easy to drink."
"D: This is a nice beer overall. Not the best ESB out there, but a very easy drinking beer that was quite refreshing after a long mountain hike."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of pale malt, pale hops, citrus hops, slight sweet malt, hint of wheat, and hint of spice. Fits the style of an Extra Special / Strong Bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale hops, citrus hops, sweet malt, pale malt, and hint of wheat. Overall, good complexity and blend."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. Not quite what I was expecting from an ESB. The flavor is toffee malt with some earthy hops mixed in. The flavor is grassy hops, earthy hops and some bready malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: A solid bitter, pretty much an American Red Ale, OK, but not approaching Fuller's."
"Pours a clear amber with two fingers of white head that had good retention. Not as dark as I would associate with an ESB. The head settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The first thing I noticed about the aroma is the mint. I did not know Galena hops had that characteristic. I also noted some earthiness, citrus, and caramel as well. The flavor is really earthy and bitter. The malt does not give enough input into the flavor. Any sweetness is quickly overpowered by the hops. Not that good of a flavor for an ESB. Not a fan of the single hop profile here either. Good body and a nice soft carbonation that seems really good for the style. This beer nees some tweaking to take into the good category. Still worth a try plus it comes in cans."
"Eminently quaffable. A great session beer."
"Can from Chip's in Kill Devil Hills, NC. Pours to a very hazy rusty orange with a quickly dissipating one finger, beige head, Nose is buttery toffee. Weird. While ESB is one of my favorite styles of beer, I can't say that I'm looking forward to drinking this after that smell - there isn't even a hint of hop presence. The hop selection is too citrusy for this style and malt profile. It starts out with a nice bitterness, but finishes too dry for an ESB and has a very watery feel to it. This beer is a mess. From the bizarre nose to downright poor ingredient selection, I would honestly drink BMC over this. It reminds me of my first homebrew. I would not recommend this to a friend."
"Picked up a can at Chip's Wine and Beer in Kill Devil Hills. I like a good ESB, but this came off more like a smooth Americn amber. In fact, it reminds me of New England Brewing's Atlantic Amber which is also from a can. It's basically a smooth caramel malt beer that finishes dry and with a moderate spicy hop kick. Nothing really stands out here, but it's certainly not a bad beer."
"Serving type: can"
"M & D - Mouthfeel is very creamy and crisp at the same time with good CO2. The body is light-medium with very nice balance in the flavors. Very drinkable."
"Medium body, lower carbonation. I really like this malt character. Nice beer."
"Poured from the can into a shaker pint. When I popped the tab the beer rushed out of the top and down the sides; WOW, a gusher. Medium gold color with some off-white foam. Somewhat bready and sweet, with no real hop character. Pretty disappointing actually, after some of the beers I've had from Ska."
"overall: an american bitter should be more bold with hops I did not like this, I sort of think I am being generous with my scores, maybe because I do like this brewery but this beer I wont have again unless they change the recipe, I hope they do!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, while there are better beers in the style this beer is still worth sessionning with for an evening"
"D: This one seems like it did not reach its full potential. I would probably drink it over a few other beers I know of, but I will definitely not be seeking it out."
"Overall though, a middling beer. Not great for the style. Drinkable at least."
"D: Goes down easily, decent representation of the style, not a blow your mind away beer, but a nice one to sit with for a bit."
"A little hop bite in the finish with some malty sweetness. Fairly easy drinking."
"This solid ESB from Ska Brewing pours a nice amber with a nice cap of creamy off-white foam that leaves a nice amount of lace. The nose has some caramel sweetness along with some light grassy hop aromas. As you sip this there is a big upfront bitterness that is followed by a strong caramel and roasted backbone. This beer drinks really easily and is nice and sessionable with a respectable 5.8% abv."
"i enjoyed this up and down. easy to drink, delicious, and there are just not enough bitters these days. i cannot wait until this comes to MO."
"Would I buy more of it? - this can came into my hands through a friend in North Carolina. They are yet to distribute their beers up here in Massachusetts. But, if I could buy it I'd probably go with their other canned offering first."
"D. Pretty drinkable beer. I think it is somewhat off style, but still good."
"Overall, a decent ESB, and nice to see a canned version of it. But unless I need a can, I'll stick with the local (STL) versions."
"The appearance is on the lighter side of pale amber with a shallow loose white foam head that leaves negligible lacing behind. If your a fan of bitters you'll like this one. It's got the classic ultra buttery big rich caramel malt thing going on. The mouth feel is nicely carbonated, smooth yet on the lighter side of a medium bodied. The flavors mirror the sweetness from the nose and linger appropriately. A real nice drinker and very sessionable at 5.7% ABV. Big thanks to Pops for the opportunity!"
"12 oz can to glass. Orange-copper color, off-white head. Malty nose. Taste wise, it seems to hit the malt and mineral notes of English ESB, but the hops stick out as American style pale ale, it seemed to overpower the mix for me. Fairly drinkable but left thinking there are better alternatives."
"Conclusion: Nothing crazy-incredible, but one of the best beers I've ever had out of a can, and a pretty good take on the style to boot."
"I'm not a huge ESB fan but I like SKA products and it was worth a try. I hate breaking it down to the Nth degree, but this is a very solid English style ESB. Looks pretty good, malty nose more so than hops, nicely bitter without stepping up and out of class with the hops. Very drinkable at a sane ABV level, and enjoyable at gatherings where you don't want a mouth slam of hops, and perhaps have to drive and have 3-4 safely. This would make a great beach pool brew IMO. Not being an ESB man I wasn't sure how to rate it at much above average in any category, but I don't believe even beer snobs could really low rate this brew. My preference is for more hops so my prejudice probably shows, perhaps unfairly."
"Drinkability is just above average."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is a moderate thickness with the perfect level of carbonation for style. The easy drinking flavor of this beer really is the highlight. This is a perfect beer when you want a simple and solid beer that is good tasting and you can keep enjoying over and over again."
"D=great drinking beer, very enjoyable, not too stout."
"A decent ESB from Ska but nothing very special IMO."
"Way bummed out. At 8.50 a 6 pack I was expecting way more, and I passed over Avery's 14'er for this mess."
"Overall, a decent bitter with good balance of sweetness and bitterness. I don't normally care for the toasted/nutty notes but this one was better than I remember."
"D - Easy to drink other than it just tastes bad."
" "
"The taste is really bad, all bitter, like a scotch ale with some very weird aftertastes. Mouthfeel is heavy but not drinkable."
"Had this ay Sticks and Stones last night.Poured a hazed peach-like color with a tight 1/2 finger white head that held well.Aromas of caramel and fruity malt,just a hint herbal,grassy hop.Well rounded on the palate starting out with caramel/biscuit malt with some fruity esters,the hops come through in the finish giving off some citric and herbal qualities.This is very much an American version of the style with a decent hop profile in the finish,very nice."
"Drinkable, but not really my style."
"I've had this beer in previous years and really liked the smoothness and drinkability. I was a little surprised at the level of hop bitterness that met my mouth, as I have had the impression, in the past, that this beer leaned more towards a English ESB. My mistake."
"This is super drinkable, wow, really nice. I am hooked, a great US interpretation of an English classic, well done and I enjoy this more than the original style."
"Nicely put together and spot on for style. Very sessionable."
"Overall impression: This is a nice camping beer - plenty drinkable, available in cans, but enough flavor to keep it from being boring."
"Very balanced and drinkable great session beer. Nothing that will blow the beer world away, but a classic stand by that will appeal to everyone."
"D - This is a pretty good ESB and yet another great canned craft beer."
"D-A beer for any place you want the ease of cans. Camping, Ball games, etc. But there are also a lot better beers in cans these days so?"
"Overall, not a very big fan of this esp. Reminded me more of a pale ale. Not something I would buy on a regular basis, but not something I would completely ignore."
"Good color that is a shade under orange, with a chunky head that leaves intermittent lacing. More floral hops in the nose than there are in the taste. It set me up for a hoppy brew that turned out to be malt dominated. Bready and sweet notes throughout, with a roasted malt type of residual aftertaste. Its good though. Carbonation leads to a silky smooth mouthfeel that I really enjoyed. Drinkable enough, I like the style and thought this was a good representation. Pick it up if you get a chance."
"Easy to drink this beer, went down quicker than I expected. This beer is a sessionable one."
"Drinkability= Super tasty ESB in a can? Hell yea mang! Love this beer. Extremely drinkable. This is it."
"drinkability: Good. Smooth drinking beer. Dangerously sessionable."
"drinkability is so so - i only picked up a single but the beer has a good full flavor just wish it had a little more life - i will check this out again"
"Overall: Good drinkability, nice sweet flavors balanced with bitterness and roasted malt/biscuit flavors. Nice and tame flavors that all combine well together."
"Overall a tasty and certainly hop forward ESB."
"Future outlook: Not available here, so moot..."
"Poured into tulip out of the fridge produced a shortlived small head over clouded gold color. Smell was hop, mild malt maybe a bit of citrus in the end. Taste was similar, bitterness came toward the later third of the tasting, not overpowering, decently balanced. Overall mouthfeel was good and at a lower ABV, it's quite drinkable. Maybe not my favorite but would have it again."
"Ska's ESB Special Ale was America's second canned microbrew (Oskar Blues Dale's Pale Ale was the first). It isn't as good as that hoppy treat, but it's no slouch either. Changes in the grain bill and the hop bill would probably put it right in my wheelhouse."
"d: good to see more breweries canning, but this beer is average at best. A very soft take on a great style of beer. Very easy drinking, sessionable if not boring."
"Along with 90 Shilling and Laughing Lab, this is one of the best session brews in the state."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Easily sessionable with presumeably low ABV and a nice flavor profile."
"When poured into a glass, the foam was light wheat in color, somewhat thick and lacey. The color was a nice honey and gold in the light. The smell was very fruity and had a bit tartness to it. The taste had a blandish fruity overtone with a nice hops undertone and a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel - clean and smooth. Drinkability - went down the gullet well and had a good session."
"this brew pours up an apricot color with a quickly fading white head. the nose is a total fruit basket composed of overripe peach, pineapple, tangerine, honeydew, kiwi, sweet pale malts, very floral. the taste is fairly sweet, more malt than hops but a subtle hop finish. It needs more hops to be an ESB in my opinion. It tastes more like a traditional English Bitter. medium body, low carbo. Not too shabby"
"After dissapointments with my first two Ska offerings, their Special ESB delivers. It must be the cans."
"The flavor is similarly light and pleasant. Sweet overall with enough berry and citric fruit to make it interesting. Good use of a British yeast to add a little complexity, but overall it's pretty middle of the road. Not a bad session beer."
"Overall this is a solid beer, though it's nothing to write home about. Still, it's worth picking up if you see it around."
"D: A good beer to drink a few of, nice flavors, and not overwhelming. Good beer all around. I enjoy it more out of the can than pouring it into a glass though. I'd recommend it."
"Possible a good gateway beer because you have a bit of complexity without the fear (for some) of a heavy, high alcohol, possibly too dark, craft beer, that may turn away your neighbor, wife, long lost friend (fill in the person that you desperately want to share good beer with.)"
"Thanks for the recommendation Travis!"
"The can poured deep amber orange with a moderate amount of sticky orange hued head. It smells of juicy citrus and caramel. I would not peg this as ESB. It's fairly sweet with barely detectable hops. I don't see a date on the can anywhere, but I would like to think that other samples are better. I love other brews from Ska."
"The mouthfeel is what I would expect from the genre. Full but not so much as to be a distraction from the flavors. This is an easy beer to sit for a session with."
"Pours a very nice cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slightly bitter, with some slight spice. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, with some slight spice. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew."
"Mouthfeel is light side of medium with carbonation also on the light side."
"Beach/Shore: Bet!"
"It is nice to see something different in a can. Well done: Another good beer from SKA (and I didn't get a glass full of wax as often happens with the bombers)."
"brillantly clear copper poured into a nonic. creamy, quickly dimishing white head. subtle aromas of toffee, buttered bread, and a hint of vague fruit and nuts. taste was spot-on for an esb with a bit of caramel sweetness and a moderate bitterness. creamy, light-bodied, with a drying finish. not too watery but still just a bit thin, but fine for the style. quite sessionable."
"Hardly any bubbling, light head, but a little sticky lacing on my glass. A preety average looking English ale. The aroma is a light bread carame and pale malt ith some subtle hops. The taste is just as Engihy subtle. You can taste the malts the best, but their not heay or bland. Just enough to notice the malts and hops. So you can keep driniking this beer over and over again. Smooth malt and hops, with a tangy and sticky finish that tays on the tongue fr quite some time."
"Ska's now holds claim to producing one of the better ESBs I've had, and certainly the finest canned version of the style to date. Recommended for camping trips and hot summer days when a pilsner just won't cut it."
"D- one of ska's better brews (IMHO) but still just decent, not as balanced as im used to ESB's being"
"Sweet and nutty aroma, it reminds me a little of Thai peanut sauce. Light bitterness and nutty malt in the flavor. Light-bodied and clean, it would probably be easy to have a couple. Lower carbonation, with a nutty residual aftertaste. Aroma was a little metallic at first, but it blew off quickly. It's not bad, but i'm not sure that this is one i'd go for again."
"D - I'm in awe of this brew...and it's in a can! A kick ass session brew, and one of the best ESBs I've ever had! Honestly, this may be my favorite session beer of all time...other than Dead Guy."
"Nice flavors. Caramelly and creamy. Good hop bitterness. Overall, pleasing taste. This is certainly a stellar beer but nothing out of the park or mind blowing. This would be a great beer to take camping in the summer since it is canned and pretty damn tasty."
"Beer pours a honey amber color with a nice two finger white head that has sustained well. Nose is malty with hints of sweet fruit. Taste is of caramel malts with a hint of sweet fruit lingering in the background finishing with a very light hop. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, nicely carbonated and somewhat smooth. Drinkability is good. I am glad i recently picked up a sixer for my next tailgate. This makes for a nice session beer!"
"Mouthfeel-Oh yes this is going to be good! Light hoppy flavor with a subtle citrus note and a creamy mouthfeel. Finishes with a sharp bitterness. The malt profile is perfect for an ESB. Not too sweet but its there with a crisp hop bitterness that is not over-bearing. THIS, is Ale! I'm rating this high becuase it smelled and tasted great and is very quaffable! one of the best ESB's I have tried in a good while and Cheers to Ska for canning it!"
"An overall good experience from a beer I didn't expect much from. A dark amber in color with a nice head and good carbonation leaving some lacing. Smell was of caramel malts and a slight hop presence. Slightly fruity also. Taste was solid all around. Caramel is again present with a biscuity flavor that is well pronounced. A little bitter hop bite does well to provide good balance. Close to a medium mouthfeel and very good drinkability. I could definitely have a few cans of this one."
"D- Quite quaffable. You could drink a LOT of this and still enjoy it. An above average ESB that's recommended. There are much better ESB's out there, but few that are this drinkable."
"Ska's ESB pours a handsome amber robe beneath a short head of creamy off-white foam that holds well and leaves some nice patches of lace at the outset of the glass. It's hoppy and malty in the nose with a bit of caramel and some leafy/grassiness, followed by some very pleasant berry-like fruitiness. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they were using the Fuller's yeast strain (White labs WLP002?). In the mouth it's medium-bodied and lightly crisp with a moderate, fine bubbled carbonation (at around 2.38 volumes CO2). The flavor is round, and very well-balanced between delicate English hops and softly caramelish and biscuity malt. But there's also a delicate note of chocolate that gives it quite a bit of charm. It's moderately bitter, and finishes fairly quick and dry with just a bit of leafy, spicy, floral and grassy hops left behind. Very nicely done, and quite drinkable!"
"Poured from a 12oz. can into my nonic pint glass. Appears a beautiful golden amber color with about two fingers of off-white foam. The head leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. Smells of sweet caramel malts, followed by biscuit and fruit (apple) notes. Taste is malty at first, followed by a nice dose of hops, more malts, and maybe some tropical fruit. Medium in both body and carbonation. Thanks to limesmut for this fine beer. It's not too often you see an ESB in a can. I would certainly drink this one again if I have the chance."
"Thanks to bitterbill for including this one!"
"The flavor is balanced and drinkable with nice hop and malt flavors. A well made and drinkable beer."
"Edit: A bought another 6er recently and there's some nice fruity tones I did not notice during my original review. I'm guessing that these are fresher samples and man, the fruitiness combined with the delicious maltiness and just a slight bitterness near the finish makes this much more tasty. New scores implemented."
"12 oz can that I poured into a pint glass. Dark orange color and cloudy. Smell was malty. The taste was metallic, yeasty and not pleasant. The mouthfeel had a grittiness to it that I did not like. I hope this was an old one or something cause it was not good at all."
"Peachy copper body with a thick, creamy, off-white head that crawls up the glass. Mildly buttery biscuit malt, light apple, and citrusy (orange, lemon) hops. Orange hoppy bitter (marmalade) on toasted bread malts. Pineapple. Slightly chalky and minerally. Some yeasty bread twang going on as well. Finish is drier and tinny with orangy hops and traces of toffee malt. Not bad. Moderate body with a soft feel."
"This beer is a little weak for the style but still a very drinkable beer overall. The beer is a lighter orange with a fair head and a good amount of lacing. The smell is hoppy and sweet. The taste is subdued hops, as in the bitterness is not overwhelming. A good beer that is quite drinkable. I would have no problem putting back a sixer of these. And come Sunday at the Food City 500 I will likely do just that. It is nice to see some craft beer in cans for sporting events and the like."
"Poured from the can a cloudy copper brew with a mid sized off white head. Aroma was mild with caramel malt and earthy hops. Taste was also caramel malts and earthy hops, decent balance. The beer is light on the palate with decent carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but far from the best."
"Good carbonation. slight oil coats the mouth, but is barely noticeable. Goes down easy. This could become a fall back beer for me since it's becoming more prevalent around here. Definitely a good drinking beer."
"Very nice drinkability goes down very smooth and definately a good session beer. This is the kind of thing I wouldnt mind taking camping and sitting around the fire with."
"12 oz. can received from Zorro in BCG BIF. I wish more micros around here would can a beer for us outdoorsmen."
"Cloudy dark orange with a rocky white head that falls to a contoured table of bubbles. Some columns of big bubble carbonation rise slowly up. Smell is a raw perfumey hops, not overpowering, but present before any malts. Smell is initially sweet then gives way immediately to astringent hops. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Expecting a little more from this, maybe a maltier character to match the vinous hoppiness, yet this is not a hop monster by any means."
"Not a bad drinker here and one of the few micro-brews that comes in cans especially for camping and the outdoors."
"What would have made this a better brew? ESBs are a style about which I feel rather flexible, but I think that the biggest issue here is the lack of balance between hops and carmel malts. A nice ESB should have a good, sweet body matched with a nice dose of hoppiness: a yin and yang of style that, unfortunately, isn't to be found in this can."
"Clear copper. Thin, receding whitish head. Sticky lacing. Malty aroma, with caramel and some biscuity graininess. Woody, nutty, floral hops, with a touch of pear. Nicely balanced. The flavor opens with nutty maltiness, kinda biscuity and grainy. Mild pear esters, with a sharp, wooden feel throughout. Woody, floral hops in the finish, nicely balanced with the malt. Some caramel sweetness, although the woody, nutty flavor seems to dominate. Nice stuff, well balanced, but I could stand for a bit more ale-like fruitiness. I usually like that in ESB, which is one of my favorite styles. Cool to see good beer in a can."
"looking forward to trying more of these ska beers (and lucky me, i've got a boxfull!)"
"Head drops off quickly, but nice prickly hop taste and malts curl around your tounge, Some citrus hint,but mostly tangy bitterness. Nice tan coloration; some cloudiness, Has a great finshI will happily take cans of this in to the woods & save some weight!"
"Pours a brilliantly clear red-copper color with a frothy light tan colored head. The aroma is light and spicy with notes of caramel and a bit of herbal/ citrusy hops. The taste is lightly sweet up front, and finishes with a mellow bitterness. This beer is quite light on the palate with a nice balance between a caramel grain note and a bit of spicy hops. As it warms and sits on my palate a hint of toasty malt character begins to develop. This beer is quite the quaffer, and is definitely a session type brew, though I would like to see a just a hint more hop character to balance the malt and a bit more fruity yeast character. Though this is certainly in line with a British Special Bitter."
"Carbonation level was a bit high for the style but nice for a summer canned beer, would probbly be wonderful in a cask. I will definitely stock up on these cans for the beach trip this summer."
"The disembarks the 12-ounce can a cloudless amber with a portly light tan head that is frothy in texture, after its eventual demise the lace forms an obfuscating sheet upon the glass. Nose is fresh fruit, sweet malt, crisp and clean with the start sweet and the malt profile adequate, the top is middling in feel. Finish is mildly acidic and the hops personable in their spiciness, aftertaste is quite dry and long lasting, a decent drinking beer and would make a fine session beer."
"I like this one."
