" Very good session ale with a dry finish that make you want to take another sip."
""
""
""
"This beer is good and clean. Smells amazing!But wasn't the best beer I've ever had. Not even e n the best beer i had tonight"
""
""
"Love it. Great flavor. Dry, hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very nice; would have liked a touch more bitterness;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid representation of the style; a great introductory craft brew."
"I like the sweetness of the flavor with a brown sugar characteristic, caramel, and bread and a muted but dry hop bitterness.  Nicely balanced."
""
""
""
"O: [3.50] I love Left Hand Milk Stout.  This is my second offering from Left Hand and it is no where near the Milk Stout.  The flavors are muted - the aroma is even more muted."
"A recent reviewer wondered if he stumbled upon a bad batch, I think we got the same one.  No flavor at all.  Thankfully I just purchased a single.  Drain pour."
"Not sure if I had a bad batch but it tastes like dirty river water"
""
"Smelled sweet and doughy. Tasted smooth, and a little on the stout/porter side. Finished thin and easy. Very good. Would buy this one again."
"Smell and taste are bland"
""
""
""
"One of all time favorites from a brewery I'm dying to get to!"
""
""
"Overall:  What a delicious, English-style ESB!  Malty and slightly sweet, it’s a malt-bomb for sure!  It’s another excellent beer from Colorado, and another excellent beer from Left Hand, which is fastley becoming one of my favorite Colorado breweries."
""
""
""
"Beer very smooth on nitro"
"Pours hazy with little head. Malty fruity aroma with bread yeast note. Malt and biscuit, but a bit one dimensional. Slight lingering bitterness."

"Excellent example of an ESB, as far as I'm concerned. Delicate, malty, with a hint of floral and piney hops to balance. Would buy six packs of this for the fall."

"Overall- A sessionable ESB/Amber Ale that will not provide a lot of punch with maltiness or hoppiness, but is very well balanced and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours nicely, with a decent head. Nice honey color. Subtle, biscuity nose. Slight carbonation and caramel in the front, but then nothing much. Disappointing finish.  Nothing offensive but rather a boring beer.  Won't buy again but will save to serve to friends who don't like beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a huge ESB guy, but this one's pretty good.  It's not overwhelmingly bitter, and it is very drinkable on its own.  This is another beer that Left Hand has made as a nitro, so I'd like to give that a shot to see how different it tastes.  I like other brews from this brewery more, but I'm ok with this one if I'm in the mood for something beyond my usual."

"Enjoyable, same basic flavor as the nitro - but the nitro is so,so much better!"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice clear amber with a short-lasting creamy white head that still managed to leave some little lacing. The aroma is pretty bland, with just a faint hint of malt sweetness. The taste is equally lifeless. It doesn't quite qualify for OK, based on the flavor/aroma profile. If it doesn't taste good, what's the point?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was truly a treat. Not at all what I thought it would be like from the bottle description or what I know about ESBs. I've had Redhook beforeand I expected a Pacific Northwest/West Coast hop slam to my mouth but this was so malty and well rounded that I'm going to have to pick up some more. Try this beer."

"Flavors of bisucit malt, some nuttiness, but herbal and spicy hops emerge. Some lemon notes, mild peppery bite. Well balance, not individual flavor dominates. Even mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, good beer."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 8/26/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pine, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes or orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good ESB style. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: It's a strong beer that has a pretty bold mouthfeel as well. Creamy, smooth, carbonated; it may all be a bit too much, but I'll give credit for going big."

""

"Brilliant copper with minimal ivory head. Very sweet caramel malt aroma, slightly nutty. Flavor is overly sweet, very malty, with a fairly bitter and resiny finish. There's a bit of a minerally note. Hop character is bitter dominant. Didn't expect as much malt character, which is pleasant, but the rest is somewhat nondescript."

"This is my absolute favorite American style ESB. The balance between the malt & hops is perfection. It's complex but definitely sessionable. I had one one draft and have also tried it on nitro...I think I prefer the co2 version for this one. Very sessionable. A must-try beer!!"

"BBD 6/4/14. Pours a clear amber with a good head. Lacing and retention are normal. Nice subtle nose of orange, caramel malt and spice over a nice subdued mineral note. Magnificent heavy medium body that is creamy and better than many stouts. Above average carbonation with a nice effervescent finish. Well balanced and somewhat complex flavor profile. It begins with an orange and spice note which then flows into a moderate bitterness. Towards the end, the sweet caramel malt shines. It finishes with an effervescent burst that is slightly citric and tart, leaving you with a nice lingering low level bitterness over a mineral note. Not as bitter as I expected, it is; however, quite outstanding."

"DATE REVIEWED: June 5, 2014... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... OCCASION: last ""1" day of the year--close to the end... APPEARANCE: nice brownish amber body with slow, subtle effervescence; white tow-finger, pillowy head is uneven; a good cloudy haze... AROMA: caramel malts and some more subtle West Coast hops generate a soft, slightly nondescript experience... PALATE: good, substantial mouthfeel with a balanced attack--teeth are active while the throat feels smoothly engaged--a pleasure to hold... TASTE: malty--mostly caramel--and some lagerish notes; likewise, hops are agreeable and aromatic; this beer has sessionable written all over it--and literally, written on the label ... OVERALLL: an overly agreeable pale ale that is balanced enough to make friends of democrats and republicans, Yanks/Sox fans, and ale/lager drinkers...."
""
"Something of an underrated beer, although it does need to sit in your glass and open up a bit first."
""
""
"This was a really good beer I enjoyed it a lot. I enjoyed the taste a lot. It was very refreshing. It had a really good taste, I enjoyed the extra strong bitter taste that it had. I wish that they did not retore this beer. The hazy brown color was a nice color as well. The head of this beer was not that bad as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter, at first, with some lingering earthy pine hop and light roast. A touch of toffee and chocolate to define the malts as British. Sessionably approachable, with no real heat to speak of. Has that odd English fruitiness that you get from a pub ale, but almost drowned out by rugged malty grain. The body is slick, but not oily. Carbonation levels are desirable. All is well, but not awesome, in Sawtooth land."

"O-I think this beer was great I liked the balance and nothing was over the top"

"A nice, easy drinking ESB with a nitro twist that gives it the feel of a Guinness. Never had a nitro beer that wasn't a dark stout ale or porter, so this was a new experience for me. I liked it, and would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Obviously I enjoyed this one. It's so well balanced and very true to the style."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with cascading bubbles and creamy nitro head. The nose is mild with rich caramel malts and deep grainy notes. Some herbal hop component comes in as well but is very restrained. The taste is somewhat muted. Bready malts, light herbal hops, some rich caramel notes all present. The balance is nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Not really sure if the nitro treatment improves this beer. It's an easy drinker and probably makes for a nice approachable beer for people just getting in craft."

"Excellent variation of a classic, English ESB. Great partner for fish n' chips, lovely on its own."

"O- Fine drinking but I won't be seeking it out"
"Great: Top ESB. Easy to session."
"As a fan of Left Hand Milk Stout, I was hoping Sawtooth Ale would at least be a decent example of an English Bitter / Pale ale. Nope."
""
""
""
""
"Had high hopes for this, especially since I like LH's nitro stout so much. but the flavors and feel just weren't there for me. Not a drain pour, but lacking in robustness. Could use more citrus, carbonation, body. Maybe this is a style I just haven't learned to appreciate fully yet. (Although there's Fuller's.) Disappointing but I guess I'll soldier on."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into pint glass. Delicious foamy head, mostly cloudy and a gorgeous rusty caramely color. What you might think of when you think of a good beer. Plus, I'm left handed and a trail worker or ""volunteer lumberjack"" and appreciated the art work on the bottle. Lovely all around."

""

"I really like nitro milk stout so I had to grab this one. I can't even remember having teh regular bottles of sawtooth. Appearance is great, bright amber with a creamy head, good lacing. Aroma is faint grainy malts, nothing special. Flavor is a bit of mineral and nuts, slightly chewy toffee flavor. Mouthfeel is great of course but overall this beer probably just wasn't that great to start with."
"o - Overall an okay beer; the only thing that made it very good was the mouthfeel thanks to the nitro-tap. A little bland overall, not something I'd probably seek out again."
""
"Overall, a rather bland and uninspiring beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours copper with a thick white head. Aroma is nutty, floral, earthy, caramel. Flavor followed suit; quite nutty, floral, earthy hops, and some caramel and cream. A medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, solid brew from Lefthand here. Would drink again."

"Bottle date is about 7 months old, so I'd like to try this again fresher, to maybe pick up a bit more of the hops. But regardless, it's a very nice, super refreshing ESB that goes down easy but has a good amount of complexity and is really tasty."
""
""
"Pours deep copper amber with a good head of fine foam that fell lazily to some sticky lace. Perfect clarity and some bubbles on their way up from the bottom of the glass. Nose is gentle. Good bit of yeast to kick start it then lots of bready malt. Doughy, biscuit, and toasted. Mellow floral hops, grass, some fruits, a little dank. Taste is excellent. Traditional. Malty with plenty of biscuit. Thin and a little watery at first then smooth and not chewy. Perfectly balanced. The chocolate in this beer is an airy dusting of cocoa powder that is light, easy and so well done. Hops are nice and floral, a touch fruity & grassy - but the malt stays up throughout the drink and the feel of it is flowing. It has some mineral qualities and a very nice malt sweetness takes it into the finish with some oil and hop bitterness for an unmarred aftertaste. Pleasant, drinkable and a great example of the style. Positively dapper."

"Overall: This one kinda blew me away. I really enjoyed it. This is almost exactly what I want out of an ESB and certainly the best american version I have had by far. I want to try it bottled and see how it compares."

""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very nice ESB. Will have more."
""
""

"O-This is a pretty middle-of-the-road brew. I found the hops a little too strong for the style, which also affected the feel, but the flavor was decent and drinkability was good. This beer is pretty ubiquitous around my neck of the woods, and while there are better choices, I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is very very well balanced. Just enough hop to even out with the malt. Refreshing as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: an oddly flavored beer that would be better without the cream of wheat taste"
"Overall - Sessionable but nothing special. Forgettable. Doubt I'll buy again."
"Overall, it was an ok beer with a smooth consistency and flavor. However, it just seemed to lack much character. Simply, nothing very impressive about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was fairly unimpressed with this beer as I think the nitro pour takes away too many subtleties that are very important in a fairly lighter beer such as this one. I would like to try it again sometime in a different format."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my new go-to beer when I'm not enjoying the stouts. It is very complex, in my opinion, and goes down very well. I would not consider it a ""strong bitter"" at all, for I am not a fan of hoppy beers. I've never even been able to stomach most bitters, or hoppy beer, such as IPA's, etc, but I really like this beer."
""
""
"Overall a seemingly Goid ale that is restrained unfortunately on nitro."
""
""
""
" Overall- A well balanced and drinkable beer. While it is not the best ESB I have had, it is worth trying."

"Overall - Very enjoyable session beer. One of the more balanced beers I have had in a long time (I'm a hophead). This will definitely be added to my session beer go-to list."
""
""
""
""

"O - Malty and bready. Not much of a hop presence."

""
""
"Overall, Sawtooth Ale is an extremely well balanced session beer that I'd definitely drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Wasn't expecting much from this one so it basically met my expectations. A decent ESB. Would I drink it again? Eh, probably not. Although, I have seen friends session this beer."
"O - An average ale in my opinion. Left Hand has much better ones in my opinion"
"O- Pretty true to style with maybe slightly more hop presence than there should be.  Either way, it's sessionable if not kind of boring."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would commit to a six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is easy to drink, tastes good but not complex enough to make it great."
""
""
""
"Left Hand's Sawtooth initially pours fairly turbid, but it clears nicely to a translucenr copper. The head starts off as two fingers of tightly packed white foam. I'm typing this more than halfway through the glass and the head still hasn't dissipated, and it's doing a fairly good job of coating the glass with lacing. The nose is very, very mild, with aromas of toast and tea barely escaping out of the glass. The toasted bread and biscuit maltiness pops a little bit more on my palate. It's followed by a gentle suggestion bitterness, and closed out with an herbal English tea hop presence. The body is a little bit sturdy, and paired with a subtle carbonation that prickles your tongue just a little bit. Left Hand's Sawtooth is a good re-creation of a classic English style by an American brewery."
""
""
""
""
"all around, a great beer. I would have given it even higher overall, if I would have gotten more aroma.(edit: upped the rating by 1/2 point due to the presence of a better aroma)"
""
""
"Being a Pale Ale and IPA fan this was a contrast but pleasant surprise to my palate and a beer i will reach for again ."
""
""
"0- A solid, tasty ESB that I wouldn't mind revisiting."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not loving this - its character and flavour just seem muddled. Distinctly malty, with plenty of earthy yeast and a notable wheat presence. The hops don't come across well and the bitterness seems lacklustre. I reckon the wheat is adding something unusual that doesn't belong with the style. Odd spicy hints in the background - similar to coriander. It seems well made but it just doesn't work; not a great ESB. I would expect an English example to be cleaner and boozier. No need to seek it out."
""
""
"Overall, I like the balance in this. It's very straight-forward and simply in construction, and not at all bad to have a few."
"This one is billed as an ESB. I've only had a few. Pours a dark, coppery, almost brown color, with little light reflecting. Head is low and rapidly fades. A bit hazy/cloudy, but nearing clear. Smells malty and fruity, with little hoppiness at all about, what you'd expect for an extra special bitter. Sweetness is low, and so is the bitterness which is present, and actually pronounced, but not nearly shouting. Carbonation is also in line with the style: low but fussy. Mouthfeel is wet, refreshing, and not as chewy as it is dark. Overall a solid offering."
""
"Very well crafted beer here for those looking for something a little outside the norm of IPAs and stouts."

"Left Hand Brewing Company's Sawtooth is a balanced Extra Strong Bitter that compares favorably with the best representatives of the style. It offers a delicious, easy-drinking beer that is also sophisticated. The word ""balance"" describes this beer well. I'll be drinking this again."

"Amber brown with a beautiful creamy head. The head sticks to the side of the glass as the beer is emptied. The nose is subtle - to be expected with ESB. Mouthfeel is silky smooth. Hops are present on the tongue and some caramel or sugar that give it a sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall – A quite delicious, easy drinking, and smooth beer. Very nice for the style."
"O - So happy they put this one in nitro bottles - does beautiful things to the beer."

"Overall - A good summer beer, not sure if I would like this style on a cold night, but for a 100 evening it works"

"Cloudy opaque medium amber in color with a flash head that lasts for less than a minute, minimal lacing. Medium levels of caramel apple aroma, and a whiff of floral notes, but not much else to the nose. However, the flavor had a nice mix of dry biscuit and caramel malt. I don't know why the biscuit didn't come through on the aroma for me... it's a mystery. Medium body and carbonation levels....nice gentle boiled bitter hop sustain on the finish with some 'hard water' mineral tones."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very drinkable beer, almost like a lawnmower lager beer. Goes down easy and smooth. Not too impressed though."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is pretty good stuff from the nitro tap, making it creamy and smooth. Would make a good session ale as well."
"O: My first ESB brew, it wasn't as bitter as I expected. Malt and sweetness is noticeable, but I've come to expect this from the folks at Left Hand Brewing. They do a great job with all their beers."
""
""

"Overall – This is a really good brew! I would highly recommend it, especially for fans of the style. I do not drink a whole lot of ESB, but it is a solid style that I like. The unique thing is this can be drank in basically hot or cold weather, inside or maybe even outside, at least in my opinion. Well-balanced, easily sessionable, and tasty, this is a brew you need to get ahold of."
"This is a nicely flavored, malty, quaffable beer. It has a nice hop character for balance. It's definitely worth a try."

"O:  Mellow and well mixed this ESB brings it home. Refreshing with great drinkability. I could knock several of these out without in a hurry. Highly recommend "
"Smooth mouth feel with the right amount of bubbles. Invites you to drink more and enjoy. If you haven't you should"
"I really like this beer. It's sweet and hoppy at the same time. Very flavorfull. I'll be drinking this from time to time."

"This beer has a nice copper body with just a thin lace around the top of the body. The smell is floral hops with some malt coming through also. The taste is very well balanced with hops and malts, a little more hops i get. Also has a toffee sweetness to it also. The mouth feel is very nice and overall a really good beer."
"OVERALL: An awesome example of an ESB. Perfect balance, tasty malt body and has enough hop character to please a hop head as well as real ale enthusiast."

"Has a smooth and creamy mouth feel. The maltiness tickles the pallate after it has gone down just like an IPA would. Overall not a bad beer... Fairly decent actually but far from most beers in the lefthand line-up."
"Overall this is just not a very exciting beer. It has very little going on and the aftertaste is very off putting."

"Overall it's not bad, it just doesn't really jump out at me. I was surprised to find it was my fourth favourite beer out of the four flavour Mountain Mixer/sampler pack. Left Hand are a very talented brewery, and this is a well made beer, it just left me underwhelmed."
""
"Poured from a nitro tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, pale, yellow coloring that has a surprisingly impressive cascade from the pour. I wasn't expecting much from it being on nitro, but so far so good. Healthy, thick, 2 inch foamy, dense, white head. Good looking brew. It seriously looks like you could carve the head with an ice cream scoop. Subtle, creamy aromas of nutty and toffee sweetness, with a touch of hops. Flavors are smooth and rich, with a toasted toffee backbone and some peppery spicing, with a subtle hop presence that cleans the palate nicely. Smooth, sweet, and subtle richness overall. The aftertaste is light and smooth, with a nutty richness. The finish is smooth and clean, leaving the palate almost completely clean. Tasty on nitro."
""
"Overall this was a very nice beer. It was a little older than I expected and I'm looking forward to finding this with a fresher brew date. This one was 7 months old. The upside is they do date the bottles. Now if I can find it when it is less than 4 months old I will revisit my review. Even at this age it was quite good."

"Poured from a bottle into a chilled pint glass. Quarter inch foamy head dissipated in a few minutes leaving some lingering lacing. The color is a coppery/gold, not quite amber. Very minimal perceivable smell. Not sure about that one. Medium body, very nice feel in the mouth; a bit creamy. Very easy drinking beer. Malty flavor with no extreme overtones. Just a hint of citrus. Overall very nicely balanced ale."
""
""
""
"Poured a slightly hazy copper color with very little head to speak of. Fruity pleasant aroma. Nice mouthfeel, but seemed to be more carbonated than it looked if that makes any sense. Very easy to drink, slightly bitter but overly hoppy. Would definitely get it again, especially in the summer months as I think it is refreshing and is a good thirst quencher."

"O: Had to try this after seeing people drink this non-stop off tap the other night at the bar. Not a huge fan of ESB's, but this is definitely one I'll have again in the future."

""
""
""
""
"Appearance is copper with a finger of head that had no retention. There is a mild herbal nose to this offering. There is a classic malty flavor upfront with a distinct transition to dry hoppiness on the finish. This is an excellent example of an ESB."
"love this one. smells well balanced but no descript, hints of english malts and a gentle sweetness. flavor has a lot of interesting subtleties, complex malts but maintains a light and refreshing mouthfeel. its crisp and clear and easy drinking. an excellent session beer, and just enough abv to warm you up on a cold day. this is one of my favorite left hand brews i have tried."

"O: Not a bad beer at all. This is the first beer I've tried from this brewery, coming from a sampler pack with 4 styles in total. A solid ESB for sure, and hopheads will love it, so it definitely fits in that niche nicely. I don't think I'd seek this beer out myself, but I am going to enjoy all 3 bottles of it with pleasure."

"Opens malty with hints of sweet caramel and toasted biscuit. Rather thin mouthfeel with low carbonation. Mild hop bitterness followed by subtle fruit accents. Nicely balanced. Finishes dry and smooth with a nod to butter. A good representation of an ESB, Sawtooth is a refreshing ale with superior drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"Nose had good defined bread and yeast characteristics. Tastes of sweet bread, oranges, orange peel and a slight bitterness that offsets the sweet at the end. Good complexity with a refreshing mouthfeel. Good carbonation balances this all out for an overall drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale pours out a lovely copper color with a touch of orange. The aroma subtly reveals apricot and orange peel with touchess of rosemary and caramel. I really like the flavor of this ale. Its got a great toasty cracker flavor upfront that rolls into a clean hop and stone fruit finish. Mostly dry, but not disappearing on the palate. Overall a really nice easy drinking ale, not to much to think about, but very well made."
""
""
""
"Christmas Eve and I am trying the Sawtooth from Left Hand. The beer pours a brillant clear copper with thin white head that is lacing. The smell is common of ESBs, bitter hops being prsent. The taste is a good balance between the bitter hops and malt. The mouthfeel is medium body with good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."
""
"O: This would be an outstanding session beer."

"This beer pours a dark brown color, that has some ruby hues to it. there is a 2-finger off-white head on it that looks really creamy. The head has awesome retention, and it leaves a bit sheet of thick lace behind. The nose was pretty faint overall. there were some toasted malt and toffee aromas. Also, there is a little bit of hop presence. The taste starts off with some toasted malt, toffee, and a bit of caramel. Those flavors are there, but they seem a bit watered down and there is a weird metallic flavor that I'm getting every now and then. There is also a mild hop flavor here. The finish leaves some lingering toasted malt and caramel sweetness. This has a medium body and smooth creamy carbonation. It goes down easy and has a really smooth feel to it. There is some toasted malt bitterness, and some dryness on the back end. This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is nice. overall, I think it is an alright beer. I would drink it again, but I don't know if I would pay for it. It's worth trying though. I'd like to try it regular instead of on nitro."
"Bought a sixer at the local stop-n-steal for 10.49. After trying the Left Hand Milk Stout, I have very high expectations. Pours a deep copper, with thick cream colored head. Tremendous retention and lacing. Malty flavor, but balanced by citrusy hop finish. Not real biscuity like a Fat Tire. Overall a pretty good beer, but next time I'll grab the Milk Stout instead."

"Poured a brilliant copper color with orange tints, a slight chill haze, and an overflowing mound of white froth from the nitro tap. The head stayed creamy and left a bit of soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet malts, toffee, and mild subdued hops. Someone else described it as smelled like wort, and as a homebrewer, I must say that's pretty apt, though it wasn't quite as aromatically full or concentrated as a steamy pot of fresh brew, obviously. Sweet taste, toffee and caramel malts, hints of vanilla, toasted bread, gently hopped for a mild bitterness, that perhaps just puts this on the cusp of being an ESB. Nice and flavorful, which is good, though maybe not always expected for this style. (But then I find most English beers and English-style beers drab and watery, so...) Medium-bodied and easily drinkable, though not quite interesting enough for me to have repeated sessions. In one night anyway."
"Bitters tend to make for decent session beers and this is not an exception to that rule. Thankfully, the alcohol couldn't be detected here and if possible, I could have had more than one in a sitting. Everything could have been amped up a notch or two here but on its own, this wasn't bad and anyone new to the style could easily start off with this offering."
"Pours a yellow orange with a frothy white head. Smell is almost buttery, with malt and subtle hops. The taste bitter, with the buttery flavor coming through. A very smooth mouthfeel, the nitro is always nice for this reason. Overall not one that I am impressed by, not something I would get again."
"Taste is solid for an ESB. Dry with some bitterness, but not offensive at all. The nitro helps create a texture that I find comparable to Boddingtons. Finishes quite dry. Very creamy and smooth... So very, very smooth. Just covers the mouth with creamy goodness. Taste lingers. I've found that this beer accompanies spicey foods very well. Probably my favorite pub ale."
"3.5 D: Not a bad beer, I just wish the malts popped a bit more. The mouthfeel is awesome and brought the overall score up another half point."
"O - really great!"
"A pretty good ESB. You might not go out of your way to get one, but you certainly wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, lots of carbonation. Very sharp bite from the carbonation. Not too easy to drink, but that's from the flavorless bitterness. Overall, disappointing. Not a lot of flavor, aroma or complexity. Just straight bitterness, as it is supposed to be, but let's accomplish this using more interesting ways."
"Conclusion: I love this style and thus I am quick to judge American interpretations harshly, especially when they are over-hopped and essentially APAs. This is a refreshingly authentic example, and one that is as worthy as any English offering of the title of Extra Special Bitter. Balance, flavor, and smooth finish. Excellent!"
"Overall: Would drink again, but wouldn't seek out."
"Drink- Overall, not that bad, not that good. Pretty average. Its called an ESB but I don’t feel this qualifies. Since the date was off, could be old? Could be someone on here labeled it ESB and not an IPA?"
"O- Nice easy drinking beer. Although this is not a session beer, still a nice one to sit around with and relax when you don't want anything too big."
"Overall: Not a true ESB from what I have experienced. Overall a little medicore."
"Overall Drinkability - A thoroughly unimposing and unimpressive beer. I think the best case for drinking this it is ""It's not Budweiser""."
"O: a good beer in its style. It doesn't have anything special that makes it stand out but it's a very decent choice."
"O - A good brew. Drinkable. For me a bit different and therefore fun."
"Didn't set my world on fire, but it's a nice and sessionable example of the style."
"O - Not a bad beer, but not one for me. I'd have it again if on tap."
"Pours a clean amber to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small maltiness. In the taste, gingerbread like maltiness and a hint of citrus. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, hint of citrus in the aftertaste. A small citrus presence, and, well, I feel this would be better not on a nitro pour."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. The beer was a copper color with a minimal head. There was a bare tracing of lace in the glass. The aroma was strong with a sweet malt. The taste was very sweetly malt with a little hint of brown sugar, raisin, and mild roast. I enjoy this style and this beer. I will drink this again given the chance."
"O- A good American interpretation of the style. Solid offering here, I will buy again if the mood strikes."
"Sawtooth ale pours a cloudy copper. It took me a bit to pick up on the flavors. I got the grain, a hint of caramel, and a little bit of hops. It has a late and dry, yet subtle, bitterness. No flavor was really prominent, but I'm OK with that. Everything was kind of middle of the road. Decent head and lacing, medium body, but not watery."
"The nose, the hops are present but obviously it did not smell the drug - as in some India Pale Ale - but a pleasant floral scent. Hops in the mouth is not intrusive, far from it. A slight taste of cooked fruit (apples baked in particular) is felt and supports, in the finish, but contained a persistent bitterness. A beer with a very good balance."
"Overall - Pretty good, not overpowering in any flavor. Very easy to drink but nothing about this beer is top notch or special. Soild but theres better esb's out there."
"Overall this is a decent beer but not a standout. I would like to see more aroma and flavor in entry and body. This is a beer that won't insult anyone's taste-buds."
"O: Just sweet, one-note, and bland. Not something I'd care to have again."
"This beer has a bronze colored body with an amber hue. The off white head is thick even after a soft pour. It was rocky and thick. The flavor and aroma are full of fruity hops. Even though this is not an IPA the hoppiness will sort of remind you of one. The body has some small carbonation bubbles to it."
"Lighter body, moderate carbonation. Very refreshing. Good session beer candidate."
"Pours an amber color with nice, fluffy white one finger head. Nice carbonation. Smells very earthy with a nice soft malt aroma. Malts are breadlike. A little lemony citrus aroma also. The taste is malt forward with a tad sweet taste kissed by some lemon like flavor hops. Feel is a litte more than medium bodied perhaps due to perceived sweetness. Has a nice bitter bite to it. Imagine this beer would be excellent on cask. Overall, a nice English styled ale."
"O: Very drinkable; will probably become one of my go-to “session” brews; really good stuff... simple, yet tasty and satisfying. I’m starting to get more into ESB’s and other lower abv beers... this one is top notch."
"After having my first beer request rejected (didn't have any left!) the waitress recommended this as a ""similar style"". Well, it wasn't all that similar but it was decent. The smell and taste is very biscuity and bready. The hops in the background I could have done without, but overall I think this was well balanced. Color was dark red/amberish; very little head even with a horrid pour by myself."
"O: very easy drinking ESB, sessionable"
"O - a good ESB (not a favorite style), but promising aroma is not matched by the flavor."
"O: This beer goes down very easily and is very sessionable."
"O: A really tasty ESB"
"What do the kids say about something like this? ""Meh""? Yeah, meh. Left Hand continues to underwhelm."
"A very easy to drink medium bodied beer, goods down good, maybe to good. I kind of wished the taste was just a little stronger with the same proportions of roasted caramel to the other added tastes, but maybe this way it'll be a better gateway beer for those starting to be adventuresome in their beer tastes."
"O - Overall this brew is damn tasty, simple but delicious"
"overall, this is a decent brew, not one ill get again though"
"Very enjoyable brew, after a while. Thankfully the flavors got more entertaining as I went along because both bottles I've had in the last few days started bland in every respect but came together quite well about a quarter of the way through."
"I'd love to try this on a regular CO2 tap or from the bottle. I think this beer doesn't really benefit from the nitro but it was different and fun to try. I could easily see this being a beer you could drink a few of on a summer day. But, like I said the nitro was fun but I can't see it helping the delivery or flavors any."
"Nice little beer..."
"A very enjoyable beer - I've had this one a few times and I think it's one of my favorite examples of the style."
"O- Everything is better on nitro. I'm not sure whether I would like this out of the bottle or not, but it was a pretty good beer when I had it. Overall I feel it may have been light on aroma and flavor, but was an overall pleasurable experience."
"O: Wish it tasted like it smelled. I think it's kind of hard to call this an ESB"
"This pours copper and has a nice head with excellent retention. The smell is malty, but not overly strong. The taste has a lot more dark fruit flavors than I was expecting, but the body is light and sessionable. The complexity is there without the sticky sweetness. This beer is fantastically smooth and delicious. I could have a few of these when I’m not craving a hop punch."
"overall - its a good thing i am already hooked on craft beer because this would not be reeling anyone in"
"Drinkability: A good representation of the ESB style. Well balanced with malts and hops, and easy drinking. A good session beer for ESB fans. Not my favorite style, but Left Hand does it well."
"This was one good-tasting beer! At first, the maltiness I look for in an ESB simply wasn't there and I didn't think it was very well-balanced in this respect. However, as the beer sat at room temperature for a while and ``warmed up'', the flavors came nicely into balance (note to self: don't serve this beer too cold). Again, this beer has a very nice flavor. In addition to a nice hoppy kick, the beer has a delightful tartness to it and I caught distinct notes of sour fruit. This is a beer I could really enjoy if I stuck it between myself and a ball game."
"D-Overall this was a drinkable brew. But notmuch going on in it to bring me back. Ive had better ESB's and worse ESB's so this is middle of the road for me."
"This is a nice and pleasant brew. It has plenty of flavor and is not powerful. It has a smoothness I expect from a draft brew."
"very light grain and wheat with a slight hint of earthy grass. This was your average ESB. And I mean average. The flavor was rather bland and non descript with really no defining characteristic to it. Some light cereal grain, and a touch of earthy grass again, but nothing really sticking out in any way. Almost forgotten as soon as it was sipped. It had a very nice amount of carbonation which was the only thing really keeping my intrest at that point"
"O: I hate to sound like a beer judge, but I feel there are some style inconsistencies with this beer. It is certainly drinkable, but not exceptional in any way."
"It was easy drinking, somewhat low carbonation, and medium mouth-feel."
"D ~ Uber drinkable. Talk about Session city."
"Overall-My buddy claimed this was one of hte worst beers he's purchased, but it wasn't horrible. However, I would not buy a 6 pack of this, but would drink it again(I drank a second one)."
"Overall: Outstanding beer, it doesn't look the part...but the rest more than makes up for it."
"Overall a pleasant drinking ale, nice bitterness and mellow malt. I'd like to try it on tap!"
"D - Very drinkable. Very well balanced between the hops and the malts. Nothing mind blowing, but a really nice beer."
"Pours transparent light copper in body with white frothy head on top that leaves lacing. Pleasant aroma of subtle citrus notes, orange peel, biscuit upfront, slight toffee undertone. Balanced flavors of subtle citrus, biscuit, toffee, hop presence towards the finish to really round things out. The coating mouthfeel of an ESB is there as expected. Light bodied with light carbonation. What a session is all about. A pleasure to drink again and again."
"Overall, I give this beer an A for living up to the 'premium bitter' style while giving it a distinctively American twist. As they did with 400 Pound Monkey, Left Hand has brewed a stellar traditional ale."
"There are some good flavors in this however it’s not quite enough to really turn my head. There was no date printed under the bottled on mark on the label so I don’t know how old it really is. I’ll have to look for it fresh somewhere."
"A solid as can be brew; good flavors, great drinkability. Case worthy sessionable stuff here. Good stuff."
"Flavor echoes this sentiment....biscuits and yeast. Overall, a pretty typical amber ale (though here it's labeled as an ESB?). More than session-worthy, but not one I'd pursue again, either."
"O--This is an ok beer for me. It is pleasant enough to drink, but that's all I can say about it--it's a middle of the road beer. Not great, not bad. Just refreshing and pleasant."
"Medium bodied, medium effervescence. Just a hint of warming with a slight drying finish. A good beer overall but not their best effort."
"O - This was just what I was in the mood for. VERY drinkable and I was left wishing I had another one. I’ll see you again, soon."
"Overall- What a great ESB! Left Hand has always brewed great ""go-to"" ales and am excited for many more to enjoy. This one's drinkability was decent but am switching to another Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale from Stone Brewing."
"the sawtooth ale from left hand brewing is pretty different. I have to say, I have never had a beer quite like this. It pours a crystal coppery brown. The look makes me think of a strong brown ale but the oppistie is more the reality of this ale. It's very mild and drinkable with a nice earthy bitter flavor. It's kind of a trick beer in the sense that it looks pretty tough but you could get away with drinking a few at a time."
"O: Average....tasty...drinkable...nothing memorable. Not a Fullers for sure."
"T - Really balanced tasting beer. Not as bitter and flavorful as you might expect though. Exceptional drinkability and good taste though and it could easily be a session beer."
"On nitro tap this past Monday at the Other Side Cafe near Newbury St for $5 pint. Served in a standard pint glass. Color was shoe leather brown, with a marshmallow colored head. Almost looked like a whipped coffee drink. Smell was brown sugar and molasses. Really enjoyed the flavor. Great tastes of malt balanced with a subtle bit of hops. The nitro aspect really made this beer shine, as an ESB is not a style I see often on nitro. I thought an ESB as easy to drink before, but nitro made it practically gulpable. The abv was non existent, and I could have had a few of these no problem. A great beer that I've always wanted to try, in a format that I love."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. It is a bit of a stretch to be a British ESB, but looking on their site, it calls it an ""American"" ESB. OK, so they are making the style up. That's cool, and I would say that it is the best ""American"" ESB I have ever had as it is the only one I have had. Either way, I am glad that I got a 6-pack of this beer as I will surely drink it all with pleasure."
"This beer looks a beautiful dark amber color in my imperial pint glass. With a heavy handed pour I get a head of about 2 fingers high. The smell was mostly malty, but had a touch of hops. Upony first taste I decide this would be a good beer to share with my Fat Tire friends, as the taste is good, bit not overly complicated or too strong. The bready malts hit first, which are tasty, but not a punch in the mouth, then the finish brings out the earthy hops. Mouthfeel is good, not too heavy with nice carbonation. Overall, a good beer, I think I'll take some of this to a family gathering."
"D- Its a good beer but there are some weird things that make me not enjoy it as much. First left hand beer and wont be the last."
"A soft, drinkable beer, possibly lacking some hops, or bite."
"O: Good. Nice creaminess and generally light - makes this an easy drinker."
"The beer pours out as a reddish brown color with a foamy cream colored head that has some good retention. The carbonation is light, the mouthfeel is smooth and not overly thick. The flavor is like a traditional ESB but not quite as good as the real thing from England but damn close. The flavor is bitter with a dry aftertaste, kinda musty. It's worth trying."
"Pours an amber reddish. A good amount of white head that dissiates quickly dissapointing for a beer on nitro tap. Smells malty and sweet. Almost no hops. A touch of bitterness. Tastes sweet with a touch of bitterness. Honestly doesn't taste much like an esb. Very smooth and creamy but the taste is lacking."
"Overall, as I mentioned above, I think this is the best way to drink this beer. All the best nuances shine through and it just seems right. Well worth a shot however you can get it."
"Goods carbonation though a little light on the mouthfeel. Overall a good if not great session beer, flavor and presentation are simple yet very drinkable. I wish there were a distinguished hop character to this one instead of gravitating towards being fat tire light."
"Had the nitro-tap version of this. Served with a very thick, luscious, thick, creamy, & cream colored head and good lace. Color was a clear, dark yellow. Aroma wasn't so good- funky, goaty, hop and malt. Flavor was a very good blend of hop, malt, grain, fresh bread, and caramel. Body was mouth filling, finely carbonated, very round and satisfying. Finish is like flavor and body combined and of medium length. Session beer."
"The Sawtooth is another beer I like to have around when I feel like drinking 3 or 8. It's incredibly smooth but somehow has this winter feel to it. I don't like it quite as much in the summer."
"Very nice, drinkable beer. I would prefer a bit more body to my bitter, but it's got a very pleasant, not-too-bitter flavor that makes it an easy beer to drink."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability is par for the course. A decent session beer at 5.3% if the flavor is your thing."
" I really enjoy the light body because it brings the focus more on the flavor which is very good, lots of toasted and gently biscuit-like malt flavors and subtle fruity yeast blends well and makes for a pretty decent take on the style with moderately bitter slightly lemony hop flavors - the dry aspect in the finish is very pleasant. I would definitely go for this again, a prety solid beer and the flavor is very good for a beer bottled about 6 wks ago"
"D - Drinkable. Not a great beer but pretty good overall."
"This beer is my go to. It has a great taste and is easy to get anywhere for the reasonable price. I have had this on draught as well and its even better. If you are an ale fan this is one to try or retry. I would like to try and make my own personal brew similar to this one. But and easy top 10 of mine."
"Fairly drinkable, though I find it hard to believe this is supposed to be an ESB. Bitter is not how I would describe this sweet, almost honey-like beer. I'd peg its presentation more as an amber than ESB. Nonetheless, is it not a bad-tasting beer, and it is one I've had before and would enjoy again."
"Overall: Overall the beer was decent. I definitly didnt get the bitter flavor in it though; much sweeter than I expected. Reminded me more of amber ale than an ESB."
"All in all, a good ale, and is definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability is good. Not the sort of thing that sits low in your stomach, I could probably have another one of these without any problem."
"M/D: Brisk carbonation and mild flavors make this beer sessionable. A good ESB worthy of purchase."
"D: I expected more balance from this beer and slightly less bitterness. I would also have liked more carbonation. I really just didn't love the beer overall, and probably will not be picking it up again; however, I would not say it is outright bad."
"D - One of the hardest to put down... I could drink it all night and just did, tried to save one for tomorrow - oops"
"Drinkability - This would be a great beer for Spring and Summer. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Nothing overly complicated. Nice and solid. A great little session beer for when the BBQ is going."
"The M&D is much different than i expected from the smell. It does give a much fuller feeling than most of the lighter beers which this one tastes so similar to. Its does make this extremely drinkable though. I would recommend this beer for a nice session, it is extremely drinkable."
"This is a great example of an ESB and a solid go-to for the style as I understand it's intended."
"Poured into pint glass a rich honey color with a slight hop scent and very lil head. A decent hoppy ESB w/a clean finish and a mild hop kickback. Mild enough for me to enjoy more than one @ a sitting. Would recommend this beer to those looking for a good beer w/a meal or over the course of a night"
"D: Would go great with anything."
"The mouth feel was thin or light with a tingling on my tongue. It's light enough you could drink a few of these easily. With the low ABV this is a session beer."
"Poured this ESB Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It started off with about one finger width of white foamy head but head retention was poor. The ale has a slightly hazy amber color. The ale has a nice malty bite that you would come to expect from a ESB. The maltiness gives way to fruity notes of citrus, I can best describe as grapefruit. There is a hint of mild hops, but this balances very well with the malty flavor. Overall this ESB feels and tastes a lot better then it looks and smells. At the end of the day that is what should matter, so hats off to Left Hand Brewery for Sawtooth Ale. Prost!"
"Pours a slightly hazy dark gold, small off-white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is malty, with a perfumy sweetness. First taste is a bit dry, on a butternut end. Kinda smooth, kinda toasty, like a white wine. Good. Possibly a bit flat as far as the finish goes. A litter bitter on the end, but drinks good. I want to re-try this one."
"Pours a deep clear orange yellow color with a thick white head and tons of lacing. Smells of citrus, malts, and piney hops. Tastes of tons of hops, malts, and a little citrus background. Mouthfeel is medium and has a little carbonation. Drinkability is medium. Not a bad beer."
"Nice orange color with minimal foam. Fairly clear, not too much lacing but it is very fine. Decent appearance I guess. Smell is a rich citrus coupled with some sweet malty smells. It has a very peculiar and nice smell. Taste begins with a short, bitter citrus that eases into a prolonged sweet malt taste. Aftertaste is pretty good and definitely adds to the drink. Full of taste and flavor, I'm really glad I picked it up. Medium carbonation but light bodied. Pretty easy to drink and full of life and flavor. It is well worth the purchase."
"Taste-Toasted malt, biscuit,nice finishing hop note, Nicely balanced and very easy to drink. Would make a fine session brew and/or a good craft ""gateway"" beer for a craft beer newbie."
"This one is a staple in my office, since both the boss and I went to school in Boulder, and my boss just built an award-winning house in ""Sawtooth Harbor"" - this ale just fit right into our Friday close of business routine."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation seemed a bit lacking. Overall, pretty good, the low carbonation takes away a bit, but I like the sweetness."
"This beer pours a clear copper color with a tall, fluffy, white head. It's aroma is essentially composed of caramel and pale malt scents. Some herbal hop components are also in the smell, but they take a backseat to the caramel scents. Nice. The taste is nicely balanced. Semi-dry, with a big malt flavor. Bittering kicks in during the mid-taste, but it's well placed. Short finish, but solid and malty. Medium body. It's a nice drinking beer, but not anything particularly special."
"The body was medium and quite creamy, the carbonation was mild but kept the viscous body crisp. The finish was clean and just slightly dry, with a bit of stickiness. Sessionable for sure, especially for the malt lover. Complex and enjoyable."
"Pours a really nice copper color that is a bit bright. Really nice white head and quite a bit of lacing. The nose brings some light pine and earthy hops and also has a good dose of some caramel backing. The taste is focused more on some bready caramel with only faint hops in the background. Good feel that is a bit malty and slightly bitter. Good body, especially with the cask. Drinks quite well and goes down really smoothly."
"D- the balanced malts and hops make this a very drinkable brew."
"Tastes like beer, drinks like beer, great for packing 'em in. Not to be savored."
"D - Drinkability is the hallmark of ESB, and this one is sure drinkable."
"Drinkability -- Aside from the nitro-tap mouthfeel, this beer wasn't very thrilling. Pretty ho-hum."
"A forgettable brew that does its best to be completely non-offensive."
"This ale from Left Hand Brewery is a little darker and slightly more bitter than a standard ale. It pours a dark amber color, with a slight hint of wheat. It has a very smooth texture and luckily a full taste otherwise I would drink this beer much too fast. A good find and a must try for any ale lovers."
"D- The nutty malts make this cool and interesting and easy to revisit"
"O: Simple yet solid beer that I wouldn't mind having around the house on a regular basis."
"Overall a very solid beer and one that deserves a second try if you weren't impressed the first time. Have one fresh and enjoy the new look!"
"This is a great esb and I will buy this again. A great beer to share with friends who do not like very bitter beers."
"I appreciate what they were trying to do here (make an American ESB) but this falls kinds short in my opinion. Drinkability is very high because of how light and watery this brew is in my opinion. This is a beer that you could be a 6 pack deep and not realize it, a good and a bad thing, but not a good thing in my opinion for and ESB."
"Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Not too rich....perfect for a hot day. First taste from Left Hand Brewing Co....good thing i bought the variety pack!"
"Left Hand Brewing Company--Sawtooth Ale--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.30% ABV. 27 IBU's. (3.75+ / 5.0) ESB--Mild lace off white light head. Clear thin bright dark amber color. Toasted mild hop caramel fruit hint front. Dry sweet crisp slightly earthy toasted biscuit caramel toffee herbal hint ripe crisp ESB body. Clean dry tangy hop hint toasted end. Light bodied rich flavored ESB. Sampled 9/8/2010. 6-Pack $7.79 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard--9/8/2010."
"The mouth was firm, with a good amount of carbonation. Flavor was bitter and dry, par for the style. Some sawdust, mild caramel notes, and hints of hops on the finish. Not a bad beer by any means, but not one I'd seek out often."
"This goes down pretty well. As it warms, there is some sourness, but overall, it's a good drinking ale."
"D: Pretty good beer that I probably won't very often. Ideally, I would order this beer by pints in a pub and have it served to me in somewhat dubious, sturdy mugs by a taciturn, portly bartender. In this setting, I would consume Sawtooth Ale to glorious excess. Otherwise, I'll grab something else."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Great appearance, nice foamy head. Nose has a really solid combo of components. Flavor is malty and hoppy, but too bitter or shocking. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Value: Decent."
" Highly recommendable for a summer evening or a fall afternoon."
"Pours a clear reddish copper with a thin off-white head. Smells of soapy, lemony hops. Taste is light malt sweetness up front, followed by an herbal woody hop flavor. A hint of dark caramel in there too. Good hop bitterness levels. Mouthfeel is rich for the gravity, and nice low carbonation levels too. Drinkability is quite good, low alcohol, and no extreme malt or hops make this a fine daily drinker. I would certainly get this again."
"The body was medium and quite creamy, the carbonation was mild but kept the viscous body crisp. The finish was clean and just slightly dry, with a bit of stickiness. Sessionable for sure, especially for the malt lover. Complex and enjoyable."
"This is a good beer in a style that I'm not always a big fan of. I could have a few."
"way too dry for an ESB, and generally"
"D: A real good beer from Left Hand, one of the better made domestic ESBs I've had, well worth a pickup."
"Found this on tap at terminal C in Denver airport (The Timberline Grill & Steakhouse). It shows a slightly hazy golden amber color with a decent off-white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is very mild, wheaty grass hop, nothing much to go on. The flavor makes a nice statement however, with bright grass and citrus hop highlights. There's some earthy yeastiness with lots of crisp carbonation to refresh the tongue. Maybe some hints of toffee malt down deep, finishing with some dryness. It's medium light bodied with a crisp, refreshing feel that's highly drinkable. It offers a nice taste for sessioning."
"* 3 out of 3 agree, it smells like a wet dog. We just got a sixer and we're all having one for the first time. I think I'm liking it the least out of the three."
"The beer pours a hazy orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is not very strong. I get some notes of toffee as well as some earthy hops. The flavor is much more complex. I get toffee, tea, grapes, apples, earthy hops and bready malt. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very drinkable."
"D-Drinking one left me with no desire to have another."
"D: Extremely enjoyable, low alcohol= set'em up!"
"Enjoyable brew for sure. Nice and balanced as the goal of a true ESB. A tad more hoppy than malty, in a good way, reminds me of an Anchor Steam. I would order this one for a balanced pale brew."
"In terms of bitter beers, it's really drinkable and taste worthy. But personally, I probably would drink it one beer per sitting."
"Pours a light hazy reddish amber, half fingered but substantial head leaving lacing. Smell is honey sweet. Taste is complex, an almost milky creaminess underneath with a modest bite of spice, hops, and carbonation on top. The mouthfeel (and aftertaste) of this beer is well balanced, substantial yet not heavy, a really complex beer that's still highly drinkable. Yum."
"Every once in awhile the appearance of a beer accurately depicts what that beer will taste like. Thats what happened when I tried Sawtooth. It had a packed creamy head that would eventually speak to the amazing mouthfeel that protected and cradled the taste for optimum enjoyability. The dark golden color, with transparency that was right in between clear and hazy, spoke to the balance of toasty hops and bitters that would soon meet my palate. This was great, and really opened me up to the ESB style that I had only tried once before and was turned off by."
"Drinkability: Great everyday beer, and a fine example of an ESB."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability. Refreshing enough, and full enough, just not the best beer from Left Hand."
"The added zing through me off a little, but at least this beer had some decent flavor considering the constitution. Overall, I thought it went well. The thing has potential, however, next time I think I'd rather do a full pint and/or regular draft/cask."
"Easy to drink a few of these thanks to the balance and refreshing feel. Not overly robust flavors but still a solid ale."
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable."
"A very nice flavorful session beer. I like the transition from sweet/malty to mild hoppiness - just the right balance. The subtle spiciness adds a extra layer of flavor."
"What took me so long to try this?"
"Pours a hazy copper color with spare head, spare lacing and soft carbonation. some floral piney hints in the smell and taste, also a bit carmel and nutty. light body with short flavor duration. thin oily texture. finishes lightly bitter. average beer, nothing really special here."
"Overall very drinkable, and good take on a British style without attempt to ""Americanize"" it. Still, not particularly distinguished other than being a good almost-session beer."
"Has aromas of hops and some spice. The head retention is disappointing but the flavor is rather interesting. It tastes of carmel, some spices and a little hoppy. When I had this, I didn't really care for it...the flavors just didn't meld to well. It's mildly complex, but nothing terrific."
"D: This left me unsatisfied, it wasn't very hoppy and the malt profile seemed a little bland to me. Hard time putting away a full pint glass of this and was eager to switch to something else."
"M & D - Very nice medium body beer that is still refreshing and drinkable. Sooth but with nice carbonation."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. I might have to go out onto the patio and enjoy it in the sun."
"Notes - Not exactly what I expected from a ESB."
"Yes, I would have guessed Amber ale for sure on this one...caramely sweet malts are only lightly balanced by some leafy hops. Gotta be some crystal malt in here. There is a touch of burnt toast bitterness but it is too little too late. Not that I mind drinking this beer, it is easy to drink and enjoyable, but I dont get much in the way of an ESB. Has a pretty full body and plenty of flavor for a sub-5% brew. Good enough to session on every once and a while."
"All in all a solid, very flavorful, and highly quaffable ale. The biggest drawback is the carbonation overload that I find quite distracting in this style of beer, actually in many styles."
"goes down pretty easily. nothing offensive nor remarkable here."
"Drinkability is very nice when of those brews that empty themselves you could be 4-5 deep in this before you even realized that you almost drank a six pack of the same beer. This is an element that has been missing in many extreme craft beers, nice to see a flavorful session ale to fill the void."
"Overall Impression: A pretty straightforward ESB. Not complex, with mellow flavor and aroma. The low abv allows for extended session. It would be a great beer for Newbeez to check out"
"Herbal hop bitterness up front, along with some toasted malt. Cookie sweetness comes in as spicy, peppery hop bitterness swells. Malt turns fruitier near the finish with notes of strawberry and apple. Minty, herbal hop finish with a crisp mineral-y edge. Medium-bodied with a slightly creamy feel. Nice and drinkable. Yum!"
"Tastes like beer aged in wood. Not bland, but not anywhere near aggressive in any sense. Doesn't seem bitter. Kind of thick. Not eager to get it over with, but not eager for another."
"My first beer from Left Hand, and based on this, I'll be trying to find others."
"d- very easy to session this one, this is the only nice thing i have ever had to say about ESB's ever. this one is a treat for sure."
"D-Really easy drinking, and sessionable. I could see myself being able to drink these all day."
"The body was average for the style. Drinkability was very good, having several of these would be easy. Overall a decent enough beer that's worth a shot."
"Overall this is a nice and sessionable ESB from Left Hand, but nothing I would seek out. Worth a look."
"The feel of this bitter is a good medium bodied flavor and is pretty easy drinking."
"Taste: Malty, with a hint of caramel, light chocolate, and some toastyness flavours. Medium-bodied and a little on the sweet side. Hop bitterness is mild, but balances the malt. Finishes a bit dry."
"Drinkability is pretty high on this one. While it's not one of my personal favorites I do think it is a very sessionable beer."
"07-08-2011 I am having another of these and though not funk and skunky, it is a bit wimpy. I have noticed than nothing smells good today - it is summer, the windows are open, and for some reason everything has a wet - sea pier - smell that ruins it. It's not just me! It's definitely better than the sample that was too old, though."
"Pours a clear copper with a big fluffy head. The aroma is malty with some floral hops and a tinge of honey. The flavor is malty, a bit bready, with a little light caramel. There are soem light floral hops and a slight woody bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is clean."
"Poured this lighter amber beer into a pint glass. The head that appeared with the pour was a depth of a half inch. Which reduced slowly to a faint wisps of lacing. The aroma of a sweat grass greeted the nose and mouth. Yet the after taste is that of a dryer amount of grass tasting. Overall a decent beer to pass the time with."
"-p"
"After mowing the lawn, I would probably give this beer an A. But, after a day at work when I wanted something to knock my socks off, it didn't even untie my shoes."
"Overall, a decent beer but nothing special. I liked it with my food because of the light and easy drinkability."
"D - A nice drinkable ale. Nicely sessionable and not overwhelming with flavor or alcohol."
"Overall a decent beer. Nothing stands out as extraordinary about it, but if you're in the mood for a smooth ESB, this one should do the trick."
"D - Nicely drinkable ESB, hitting the right notes with flavor but subdued enough to be an easily sessionable ale."
"Medium body, low carb makes this beer quiet easy to drink."
"D= Good beer. Really nothing crazy or exciting about this beer. It's just a good ol' APA labeled on the site as an ESB. Great flavors coming from it I really dig the bready biscuityness of this beer. Great complement to the hops. My score is based on rating this as an ESB."
"Notes: good ESB. maybe a little light on the bittering hops. good balance between malt and hops with superb drinkability"
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a 12oz 'pint' glass. The beer has a light brown color with hints of copper. There is a small head of tiny bubbles. Visible in this clear beer are many carbonation bubbles streaming to the top of the glass. While pouring the beer, I could smell some caramel sweetness. Once I bring the glass up to my nose, I get a robust, woodsy, sweet aroma. It is very pleasing and makes me excited to take my first sip. The main taste characteristic is of toffee, but there is also a pine-like hop flavor in the finish. There is a mild bitterness in the aftertaste, but nothing too sensational. This beer tastes more like a brown to me. It has a light body, which suits it well. There is plenty of carbonation and not much coating. I find this beer to be very drinkable. I could have a number of these in a row without growing tired of it. Too bad this is my last bottle!"
"I will be drinkig more of this one in the future."
"D: Wow, I think I may have found my next favorite session beer with this stuff. Great flavors, but not overbearing in any way. Very balanced and multi dimensional. Nice beer. Will definitely be keeping this one on hand!"
"D- I was impressed, pretty damn good ale. Not something that you'll see me drink often, bit on the light side for my taste but a welcome change."
"Eminently drinkable due to the perfectly balanced flavor and nice balnce of body and carbonation"
"D- I would love to have a few of these around to drink when I need a dose of fresh beer that isn't chalked with alcohol."
"This is a beer with absolutely no character; tastes and smells like a lightly bitter water. Just my opinion or a really bad batch."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a medium-light body and has a dry finish."
"D: Absolutely. I could drink this all night long and be happy as a clam. The sweet malty goodness meeting hoppy afterbite is incredible, and I could go for this beer anytime, anywhere."
"Poured a clear amber-tinted brown with a quickly dying head and some lace patches. A mix of caramel malt and citric hops. A light to medium beer that contains both sweet malts like caramel and bready/biscuit malts that along with a light citric hop bitterness, balances well for a drink that is both sweet and crisp while retaining a dry finish. Beers like this are made to just sit and relax with at a bar and this one is no exception."
"On to the taste scene. Mouthfeel is medium to light, carbination is nice and bubbly. There are still bubbles chasing to reach the surface. Taking a deep gulp you have initial hop sweetness and malty sweetness with a little followup of hop bitterness. Finish is quite crisp. I am not as excited about this as compared to other ESB's. It's not bad and I would definatley drink it again but its not something I would go out of my way for."
"Bomber into a Sam. Smith's Imperial pint glass. Pours a clear, ruddy amber with a dense, two-finger, off-white head that leaves lots of lacing. The smell is clover, whole grain, mineral tang. The taste is grain, sweet mild floral notes, mineral sharpness, and a not-too bitter finish with a hefty malt backbone. There are some faint buttery notes deep in the mix. It's well carbonated, though not too spritzy, and medium in body. Easy to down, and not too boozy for a small session. Glad I got two. A nice example of the style."
"An overall solid, decent brew."
"Drinkability: This beer is quite easy to drink and I could easily have more than one. I'll certainly look to have this one again sometime."
"Not too impressed with this brew. It was a little under-hopped for my taste. Not much of a foam head to speak of and it what did foam up didn't stick around for long. Color was a bit dark and kinda reminded me of a bad version of Killians. Not much to say here it's just not any good. Will not be buying this brew again."
"Not sure what that sweet taste is, but it's different and I like it."
"pours a copper color with a small off white head. smells malty with fruits and bread. fruity taste with a balance of hops. not much else to say. Enjoyed the beer, but not much better then average. still ok, nice and balanced."
"Great session beer."
"The look is a nice amber color that is not filmy. The smell smells of fresh fruit, but not to the point of excess. The taste is a nice taste of fruit, but not to much and rather easy to drink. One drawback is that there is a real after taste that anyone would notice. For the most part, I good beer. Verdict: try it."
"Drinkability: Not too bad. I don't know if the bitterness would lend itself to a session, but it's a solid beer for sure."
"D - Easy enough! I could drink a 6 of these pretty quick."
" A nice bright copper color body with a thick lasting off-white head leaving some lacing. Aroma is slightly malty,a bit bready,hints of floral hops,slightly sweet. Flavor is malty up front some nice caramel,a touch of bread dough, a little spicy hops and hints of lemon at the finish,lightly bitter,medium body and lively carbonation, grainy,malty aftertaste. Quite drinkable."
"Pair this with duck breast, or penut dusted scallops with an earthy farro or creamy risotto to offset the bitterness."
"D- Exceptional brew even for people who only drink BMC."
"D - Low ABV makes it a drinkable beer. Too bad I don't want any more of it."
"Likely won't take me long to finish the rest of the pack, but I can't say just yet if i'll be goin' back for more. It's a decent beer, and a great ESB. That is all."
"Pours a nice copper color with 1-2 fingers of fizzy head, not much lacing but good carbonation. Nose is very weak, light fruity malts and a little floral hoppiness. Taste is rather balanced, light malts and good hops marry well but overall not very strong flavors. Even though it is an ESB I find it a rather light and refreshing example, good for the heat."
"Overall this isn't a bad beer. Very drinkable on a warm summer day."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability- Thin bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Finishes crisp with no aftertaste to speak of. The low ABV and well balnced flavors make this a highly drinkable offering from left hand."
"I was just lamenting how few good beers I've reviewed and how many I've enjoyed when this Sawtooth Ale, what I've been drinking now for the past couple of weeks, beside me on the end table wryly remarked ""And whose fault is that?"" Thus have I been moved by the spirit to report that these past two weeks have been utmost pleasurable. This ale looks and smells like an English pale ale (in the American microbrew style, not truly English pale), amber/rusty color and hop perky scent following a whiff of unsweet malt/caramel scent. Pours into glass leaving a nice but short lived 1 1/2 head. The taste will please pale ale, amber ale, and even IPA lovers because the Sawtooth seems to straddle all three of these, making it an easy drinking but lively and interesting bev. On the one hand, you taste hops from start to finish, but the hoppiness of an IPA remains just beyond your grasp. On the other, the tease of amber maltiness (again, more in mouth feel and scent than sweetness or flavor) never quite congeals. Once down the gullet, bitter and herby remainders on the tongue.It's Left Hand's genius that such an interesting bev can be undemanding and low maintenance at the same time."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a pale orange with a sticky, long lasting, white head. The aroma is bready. The flavor is slightly bitter, with diacytle notes, and a lingering finish. The brew has a light to medium body, average carbonation and goes down easy. Even though I am not really into the style, I could session with this one."
"Bottle Pours a hazy golden with a good off white head. The head is airy and last okay. Has a good mixed aroma. Hops and malts seem to balance each other out. Has an oily texture. Good carbination. A pretty good mouthfeel. The flavors are very well balanced. A light body. A very drinkable beer. I like it."
"D - Extremely sessionable... Nothing overly complicated, but nothing detracts from this beer either... Average, solid, and respectable are the three adjectives that I associate with this brew..."
"Left Hand's Sawtooth pours a partly cloudy golden brown, accompanied with a tall three finger smooth slick head. The taste is faintly malty, and barely hopy. A very light flavored beer. The aroma is the pretty much the same, slightly malty. It has a medium carbonation which is perfect for the style. Light body with only 4.75% abv. Overall this beer has a good drinkability, and in my opinion makes a great session beer."
"A creamy, bubbly one inch head forms on top this semi-hazy, orange colored beer. The aroma is tame, it has some buttery and pine character hitting my nose. Taste is similar to the aroma. A little grain and malt to start things off, but a light buttery character and piney hop flavor emerge. Hints of peach flavor. Mouthfeel is light, and a little watery for my liking. Still, it is a solid offering that's worth sampling."
"Not a lot going on here. It's malty but also quite watery in taste."
"D- A very bland beer. But, it is easy going at that. Still this really isn't my thing."
"Pours a very clear brownish red body, some white creamy head, diminishing. Bitter malty aroma, hoppy. Musty and somewhat dusty. Malty sweet taste. very drinkable. Somewhat dusty. some bitterness, vegetableness. Drying on the aftertaste. Sweet and dry taste. Some spices."
"Overall, not good, not bad, just ultra-bland."
"D: An exceptionally drinkable ESB. I really enjoyed this. Low ABV makes this a great session beer. Pairs nicely with traditional pub fare."
"Poured into a chilled stemless wine glass. It pours virtually no head with a vigorous pour. Settles kind of flat and lifeless. The deep color is pretty cool. Has a good first pale bite but putters out into a sorta syrupy mix. The flavor is pretty good after it resonates for a while. Don't think it has the pale bite I've grown to like."
"D - This is a drinkable amber ale with good caramel aroma. A bit bland overall, and more of and American Amber than an ESB, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Pours a clear copper/amber color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells bread strongly up front, slight hops, and some earthy malt background. Fits the style of an ESB. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with low carbonation level. Tastes of bread, earthy malt, and slight hops. An overall dryness is present, but a pretty decent beer."
"Drinkability: I love sweet malt, I love this beer. Left Hand is slowly becoming a favorite of mine and this beer is excellent...I will session this. Wow another great offering."
"Very unique beer, and though I would certainly drink it again, it might be a very ""occassional"" thing."
"Pours a dark amber copper with a little head, not much lacing to speak of. Smells malty with a hint of sweet caramel. Tastes malty and bitter, light mouthfeel, finishes pretty smooth. Pretty drinkable for its style. This is a few people I know's favorite beer and they always have some, but otherwise I would not go out of my way to find this."
"Overall a good drinking beer. A lighter ale that is satisfying and refreshing."
"Overall a pretty enjoyable ESB and even better for the price. I bought this as a single bottle for just a bit over a dollar so I'll pick up some more for sure. Very drinkable and very crisp."
"Notes - Tasty, very drinkable and refreshing. Should pick this one up again in the summer."
"Date consumed: 11 September 2008"
"Pours a deep golden light brown translucent color with a finger of head. Some lacing on glass. Smell is like caramel malt. Taste is very malty. Light mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable, a little malty for my taste. Wish it had more alcohol to it. Not a bad beer by any means but will probably not buy again."
"D - Really easy drinker here... sweet malt bomb with some bite. Nothing special, but a great brew to keep in the fridge."
"Poured a rich amber color with a thin white lacing. The first thing that really stood out to me in both the flavor and the aroma was the nice, round bitterness of the hops, along with some light fruity notes. This had a very nice bitterness with a nice, clean finish, and was surprisingly drinkable for a beer with this kind of hops profile. Not bad at all."
"Pours an orange brown color with a small off white head and some light sticking. Roasted malt in the nose, hints at chocolate malt as well even some whiffs of coffee, interesting. Nice flavor, subtle bitter hops, stale grainy malt, medium bodied. Nothing that will really 'wow' you but it drinks pretty well."
"Conclusion: I tried, but I didn't really like this one all that much. Maybe I got an ""off"" bottle? Everything just seems kind of out of balance and the various flavor components don't mesh well together."
"A fairly standard ESB. Aroma was light...hints of caramel malt. Pour was a light copper with a thin white ring for a head. Taste was very malty and thin..caramel and pale malts with just a hint of hops in the aftertaste after the swallow. Not very strong in any category."
"Future outlook: Situationally likely to purchase again. Not the most complex, flavorful, or interesting beer IMO, but a damn good drink nonetheless."
"D - Very drinkable. Fairly light in alcohol and with the slight hoppiness makes this a beer you can have more then one of."
"I was not that impressed wit this. It does not measure up to Fuller's, Youngs, or Bombardier IMO."
"Bottle bought at College Liquors in Grand Junction. Pours a clear amber color with a large white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is mostly rich caramel malts and some citrus hops. The taste is very nice; sweet and rich caramel malts, some pine and citrus hops in the finish. A clean and easygoing brew. Pretty nice."
"It pours the an amber color, and has a thick frothy head. It smells pleasantly musty and has a low hop, high malt flavor. A little hint of peat. I get the feeling I could drink and enjoy a large quantity of this beer."
"Left Hand continues to impress me. I need to make a trip to the brewery soon. Try this beer, it is a great session beer that you won't regret trying."
"Left Hand Brewing Company Sawtooth Ale pours a dark amberish orange with a nice froathy head that stands the test of time. The smell is light and pleasant of a citrus like hops. Taste is lacking a bit. Its light, smooth, with a slight bitter hop background. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side of a medium density. There is also a nice medium to low carbonation that fits this brew nicely. Overall I'd say the feel was the best quality of this beer. It definitely gave it a nice drinkable despite its mellow taste. A good beer worth trying and reasonably priced too."
"Pours a nice copper amber with a medium white head and good lacing. Smell is light and fragrant of citrus hops and light malt. Some caramel and toffee. Seems more like an Amber or Pale but whatever. Taste is much of the same. Seems a little hoppy for an ESB but not too bad. A good caramel malt backbone and some citrus hops. Not much for a biscuity or bready flavor, either. Notes of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is just a touch bitter to me. I mean, it's not drying or IPA like but it doesn't seem like an ESB. Still, I'm a hop head. This happens quite often with me. Somebody will overhop a particular style and while it doesn't necessarily match, I'll give it praise in the drinkability department. Sure, it didn't seem completely like an ESB should. The point is I could drink this pretty easy and would probably have another. To be honest, it makes me long for Blue Point ESB more than ever..."
"Mmm, I love a good session beer like this. The malts are a crisp combination of caramel and light toffee with a touch of fruit punh, while grassy, earthy hops finish the beer up and leave a mellow, but tasty aftertaste. Thin enough and certainly worth a few pints, this a pretty good, yet not great ESB."
"Pours a deep copper colour with a brewery malty type nose with is kinda nice.The malts are the mainstay with some hops on the followup which bring to mind Fullsail Amber in flavour profile. Very drinkable and food friendly this is a decent beer from a brewery that I have not tried before."
"This is a medium bodied beer with a lasting aftertaste. The carbonation is felt on the tongue. There is a short malt taste at the start with a heavy and long lasting hop finish."
"Thick feel in a cream ale sort of way. A little chewy and bubbly. It's a pretty good pub ale. Might be a tad old but still worthy nonetheless."
"D-Decent I could have a few of these in a setting not one you want to let warm up on you though"
"drinkable for a while but becomes heavy, but overall very enjoyable."
"D: Overall, this beer did nothing for me. While it was not without its strong points, I found the taste a little watery and uninteresting."
"Very recommended. Now, if we could only get full 6/12 packs of this in GA, life would be good. For now, we can only get this in the brewer's mixed 12 pack."
"D: Good. Not quite a session beer"
"mouthfeel is full but the flavor is a little lacking. Would like more of an up front hoppiness. The residual bitterness is nice though."
"While mouthfeel is clean the problem is with it being way too much clean. Not enough punch in this ESB for my tastes."
"Average drinkability, I would say."
"Crisp, mellow, and medium-bodied, Sawtooth Ale is a tasty and nicely balanced ESB with sessionable drinkability."
"D- interesting and tasty, sessionable, solid ESB, good choice"
"This poured a slightly hazy amber with off-white head. It smelled like a blend of earthy and caramel malts with some copper hops. It tasted like light but sweet caramel malt with some mild copper hops. It was watery with no carbonation, and had a very mild aftertaste. Overall this was not a very flavorful beer, but it was clean and easy to drink. Good traditional ESB that's nice to relax with."
"Overall, not bad -- just not doing it for me. So many times people say that there are bette things out ther. I agree. I gues taste is all in the mouth. I need something more out of this style."
"D-Very nice brew, could easily see having this again."
"Nice ale and am looking forward to the next one."
"On-tap at the Saucer, served a crisp dark red with a decent frothy head that leaves decent lacing. Aroma was very much on the weak side, some fruits, but not much. The taste was sweet fruits and slight carmel with undertoned citrus hops. The beer was very light crisp and refreshing. This one would make a decent session beer."
"Drinkability: Solid APA...I could drink and few and plan on doing it again"
"D - I COULD DRINK THIS 4 A LONG TIME. VERY GOOD BREW!"
"Drinkability is major. You can kick back with a six-pack of these and feel recharged, as these bring on a nice buzz in the late hours of the night."
"D: A good pub or everyday drinking ale, fruity and spicy hopwise"
"Eric"
"I would drink this again, as its a great craft style epa. This has been done before and originality is not present, but its a damn fine beer. I'd take this over alot of other epa's any day."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but at the same time, average overall. It won't knock you out but it leaves more to be desired from the style. Worth a shot though."
"D - I love bitters nearly as much as I love IPAs. This one is a low enough alcohol level I could drink all night. It's not quite everything I'd want in an ESB, but it's pretty darn good. I'll have no problem finishing the rest of these ESBs from the mix pack."
"D: A solid ESB, not my favorites because I could use a little more bitter in place of the spice but still a good drink needing just some extra bitterness. I do recommend."
"Taste is very bitter hops, very little malts, just enough to provide a little backbone for the hops. Feels biting and just a little thin but a very nice hot day beer."
"good carbonation. mid to full body. i really enjoyed the mouth feel. nice lace. i dig this beer. i could do a session. i will probably pick up a six in the near future. very good esb."
"Drinkability: Fine, flavorful ESB from Left Hand."
"One of my favorite session brews for a long time now. A brownish pour is topped off by a one-finger tan head which recedes fairly quickly and leaves some streaks of lacing behind. Smells and tastes sweet and malty with some hops and tea thrown in to balance things out. Fairly light bodied and drinkable, yet quite tasty. While the Sawtooth is not the highest rated beer, there's something about it I can get to again and again."
"Pours a clear copper color with a medium head. Nice lacing down the glass. Aroma is mild herbal hops with a bit of toastiness. Taste is hoppy. Low sweetness. Toasty malt. Bitter in the finish. Light to medium bodied. Pretty drinkable. Overall a decent American ESB. It lacking the pleasant malty complexity of many English versions but it's nice anyway."
"Poured a nice amber in color with a big head that fades to a thin layer of bubbles. Lots of malty sweetness in the nose. Medium hoppyness. Dry and slightly bitter with slight coffee notes. Finish has just enough bitterness. This is an average ESB at best."
"Poured a beautiful amber straight into the glass with a 2-finger fluffy head. This beer smelled of delicious spicy hops. The taste was great; nice foral notes with a bit of sweet malt and a good hop punch. A great West coast style ale. Overall, you can't go wrong with this one."
"This is a beer I could drink all night. I really have to find this one on tap somewhere."
"The taste is sharp, with quite a bite to it. I wasn't expecting the bite but after a few sips, it went down quite nicely. This is nice beer that you could sit and have a few."
"Poured a nice dark golden copper color with a nice 2 finger, off white head. Lacing is present throughout whole beer drinking experience. Aroma was minimal. Had a nice bready yeastiness to it with a citrus hint. Also a hint of chocolate in the nose. The taste was very nice. A good bitterness balanced perfectly with the hops. Chocolate also present. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall anice drinkable beer. Something I could sit and drink a lot of."
"I think this should really be categorized as an American Pale Ale rather than an ESB as it is a bit unbalanced and what little malty character exists shortly gives way to hops rather quickly. Technicality aside, this is an easy drinking session beer with some pretty nice hoppy notes."
"Pours a light brown with golden hues. Big head, good retention, nice lacing. Aroma is of caramel, honey, raisins, and fruit. Taste is pretty sweet upfront with more caramel, toasted malt, finish is of bitter, citrusy hops. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty easy drinker."
"M&D: Mostly lighter flavors of malt but it has a heavier weight to it in the mouth. Carbonation is fine but abundant and somehow seems to bring out the malt nicely. I can really taste the barley in this one and for the most part, it is pretty good. It's almost reminiscent of a lighter bock style."
"Overall this is a decent beer. I don't know that I would have it again, but I'm willing to try any beer once."
"O- A good sessionable beer. A solid choice. Plenty of flavor"
"Aroma is strong and richly malty with some fruity undertones. It pours a dark golden brown with a thick, fluffy head that sticks around for a bit. Flavor has a good balance of malt and hops, and the hop bitterness is not overwhelming, but it is not subtle either. This ale is lively in one's mouth and smooth going down the hatch."
"Bottled on 12/12/2007. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent reddish-copper color; excellent clarity. Two finger rocky, white head with decent retention eventually dissipates into some foamy residue. Sticky webs of lacing adhered to the glass during and after the session. Aromas of hops, citrus and bread. Flavors of grain and some fruity esters and a slight hoppy bitterness at the finish. Some carbonation, but slightly subdued; not at all unpleasant however. Very drinkable session brew, but a little subdued for the style due to the minimal hops presence. However, very well balanced from start to finish."
"D: A nice, drinkable ESB. A crisp, bitter taste with a nice, dry finish. Pretty smooth drinking going down. Overall, a nice beer."
"i haven't had many ESB's, but here it is ; pours a clear med. copper color w/ a thin off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving some decent broken lacing down my glass ; not a strong smell, piney grapefruitish hop and grainy, nutty caramel mostly ; a bit astringent, lightly toasted malts, nuts, darker fruit and a grassy hop presence as well, almost tastes like tea, but better ; a light, dry, yet creamy mouthfeel, not too carbonated though ; a fine brew, very drinkable, i think i'll have to try more ESB's this summer..."
"The perfect session beer; great for the style; my favorite so far from Left Hand"
"Again would go great with Mexican spice dishes to play off the malts. By itself you could have a few but when properly paired with food you have a great session beer."
"D: An alright beer..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, crisp, and very well carbonated. Smooth and very drinkable. Almost goes down too easy. Overall, this is a pretty solid beer. Definitely one I'd drink again."
"d: Seems pretty average to me. I would classify it more as an amber ale than an ESB, but what do I know? More like a Fat Tire. A decent beer, sessionable, but nothing out of the ordinary, pretty forgettable in my opinion."
"D - This is a good beer that is sessionable this would be good while playing some darts this is worth trying sometime"
"A quality American ESB. Very drinkable and definate session beer. I'd have another."
"D - Very tasty ESB that's well balanced and easy to drink. Nice session beer."
"D: Very good session ESB."
"This beer's appearance was amber and copper with a thick, foamy head. Nice lacing, remnants of it remained on the glass all the way down. It had a great nose, smelled of deep caramel and grain, notes of citrus too. Taste was great, bold and complex with primary notes of toasty malt flavors and caramel. Great mouthfeel, had a nice presence, definitely not forgettable! This beer finishes with a nice dry note. One of my favorite ESB's and I look forward to trying more from this brewery."
"Recommended."
"I'm a big hop head so this isn't entirely my style of beer. Still, it does have a hoppy bite after the initial taste, but it is dominated by a carmelly, nutty flavor -- sort of a reduced Newcastle. Very frothy head that persists a long time. Yeah, I'd drink this again but not as beer of first choice."
"D: This could be a great stepping stone beer for that special someone who is reluctant to try micros. And, dare I say, session beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"Pours a hazy light amber color with a pretty nice head, and some big lacing for a sub 5% beer. The smell is sweat with a big whiff of graham crackers. The taste is light and refreshing with a mild malt flavoring with some sweet honey and floral hops finishing it off. The mouthfeel is good for a session brew. This would be a very good beer for a hot day"
"Tasted 1/23/08"
"On-tap pours a brown hue with nice white head. Smell is full of sweet hops. Taste brings in honey tones with hops over malt. Slight caramel note too. Finishes with satisfying dry hop taste leaving you wanting for more...and you want more. Definitely drinkable...very good sessionability. A fine brew."
"D- as a fan of ESB's i had no problem with this what-so-evaaaa"
"i could go through a ton of these. Not too high in alcohol, nor too bold in flavor. The flavor has enough going on though not to bore me. Good beer!"
"Not what I would call a complex brew, but flavorful none the less. I'm looking forward to breaking out it's big brother, Chainsaw Ale Double Sawtooth, that I have tucked away."
"D - The hops finish builds up over time, otherwise a drinkable beer."
"At 4.75 % ABV, this is an almost perfect session bitter. It would be even better if served on cask."
"A 12oz bottle, with bottled on 12/12/07 stamped on the label. Poured into a pint glass, it was a golden color with a fairly thick head. Little aroma, bread and slightly sweet. It had a sweet taste, could almost taste chocolate. Some peppery spice in there also. Pretty pleasant beer, would consider this a good session beer."
"Pours a little pale for the style, a light copper color with almost no head. Smells somewhat sweet and malty, but leans toward the dry side. There is also a nice nutty aroma as well as a touch of metal on the finish that is not unusual for the style. The taste is also quite nutty and their is a somewhite bacony flavor mixed in there as well. Medium bitterness, also maybe a touch high for the style and dryer than the nose suggested. Pretty decent. Mouthfeel is squeeky clean and a litttle light. There is a residual roastiness that cobines with some of the nutty flavors to leave a pleasant aftertaste that makes this nicely drinkable. Not bad at all."
"[1] I don't have a decent pint glass right now. I'm working on that. I tried the ABC I bought this beer at to no avail."
" A good bodied ale with enough carbonation to wet your thirst. I had to have a second immediately."
"From a typical 12oz bottle copped singly from total wine and more in union, this is my second brew from Left Hand... their Milk Stout was one of my all-time favorite stouts, so had high hopes for this ESB... didn't disappoint... great stuff... pours a copper color with a frothy head, which leads to a bready and enticing aroma... flavor is full of caramel, slight vanilla, and a bread and butter taste that is easily drinkable and not at all too bitter... easy drinkability and a modest alcohol percentage make this a good, sociable, session beer... recommended... good stuff..."
"D: Enjoyable but nothing super special. Needs a little more punch."
"Not a bad esb at all, I just want more from it. I can't explain why, but I just want MORE."
"Drinkability - this is a decent beer, but it is marred by the metallic taste and the metallic mouthfeel, so to me it is not sessionable because I'd want a different taste after two or so of these."
"T: I looked up this style to see where it should hit, and after reading the description i was surprised how well it describes this beer. its an esb, which isnt really about being bitter but being balanced. that is the best way to describe this beer, is balanced. it combined some maltyness and hop kick in an all around package that doesn't allow one aspect to outshine another"
"Overall this beer very solid style wise, it would make a good session beer, but I was turned off by the high carbonation and thin mouthfeel."
"D: This would make for a great drinking session."
"Final thoughts  Although the brew is smooth it lacks depth and complexity. One is enough for me."
"Reddish to light brown colored beer with a sweet caramel aroma.Taste is the same sweet with decent caramel flavor and a sweet aftertaste.Very smooth beer enjoyable from first to last sip.I will buy this again and also recommend to anyone who will listen to me."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, decent kick, not too filling, decent representation of style, I could drink a few of these and it’s not a bad beer, but it wouldn’t be my first choice."
"The drinkability is ok an easy drinking beer but nothing to get you attention. MK"
"M/D - A medium flavor and a medium body. A well-rounded beer that I would love to drink again."
"D- Although the tastes are watery, that makes it a more drinkable beer. It is not too much for you to handle, so a sixer would go down easier of this stuff. Not my thing, but not bad either."
"Oh well, not every brew is gonna be a winner."
"solid via bottle as well."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a copper color with an off-white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is very malty with some biscuit and hops. The taste much like the aroma features a good amount of malt with a dry and bitter finish from the hops. Overall, this is a pretty good brew that I enjoyed. Something was a little bit ""off"" in the taste that prevented it from getting a ""4". Reminds me more of an American Amber than a ESB. Recommended."
"Drinkability: It's easy enough to quaff a few, but there's not much exciting about it."
"Hazy amber going toward orange. Tight honey yellow head. Aroma of an IPA. Head retained and laced all the way down. Bitter, with caramel malts. Low alcohol. This is the biggest tasting small beer I've ever had. Flavorful character. Light a maibock with a lot of hops added. Slight conditioning sting; but not bloating. Thin mouthfeel. Leaves a resinous palate. Solid brew."
"I would say highly drinkable if you are a malt-mouth like myself. Refreshing enough to be enjoyed after one is too drunk to care about flavor as much (sorry BAs, but it happens when one goes out drinking and you know it) but flavorful enough that you keep coming back to the taste no matter how many you have. Nice brew."
"High drinkability and a good session ale. One more please!"
"This one is a bit of a disappointment. The pour is amber, more on the light side of the spectrum as far as ambers go. The beer pours a slightly frothy head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is minimal. The smell is malty, sweet, cloying, ehhh, nothing great. The taste is definitely sweet, there is a bready feel to this one. There is a dryness that complements the sweetness and rounds things out a bit. There is some hop on the back end, but you need to really search for it. This beer is medium bodied and very average. Quite frankly, I was disappointed, thinking this was so much more. In part this is due to the ubiquitous availability of Left Hand, which seems to be on the shelves everywhere. As the beer warms, I'm getting a goodly dose of caramel and leather. This one is a one and done for me."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a 1"" head that reduced into a very thin collar. Big bubbles eat up little bubbles and yield tight lacing around the glass. Aroma is of floral hops, toast, and citrus bitterness. Taste is biscuity and sweet with grassy hop notes in the finish. Fruit flavors like pear and citrus are present. Medium bodied. A fine beer. Tasty without being overpowering."
"Anyways, the Sawtooth has a inviting orange/tawny color but the head is small and fizzles out quick. The CO2 fizzle also made the mouthfeel less pleasurable but still good. This beer on Nitro or hand pull would be outstanding. The aroma is malt balanced with caramel and light roast type notes. The hops are subdued and there is a light fruitiness in the aroma that follows throught in to the flavor. I like this beer alot and find it quite easy to drink."
"The colour was amber and it poured with a centimeter of creamy foam. My first impression of the smell was how much like an IPA it was with that sticky citric and yeast whiff as well as notes of plums and licorice/toffee. The taste had a kind of lemon note to it with a bitter bite at the end. The weak point was the lack of body which allowed for a certain amount of bad and flat mineral water character. Maybe fixable through a more generous dose of malts?"
"a fine sessionbrew. Nice try but no cigar."
"A highly drinkable and very American ale."
"This takes like an american pale ale to me - a decent beer."
"This is a good interpretation of an ESB. Well-balanced and on the spot for flavor."
"A tame ESB with a rather flavorless hop profile, despite the obligatory spice for the style. Nothing memorable."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied with lower levels of very fine carbonation bubbles. Goes down easily and well. This is one that is easy to drink, makes a great session brew. However, I think that there are better examples out there. Definitely won't be purchasing this one again until I've tried other brews of the same style. In my opinion Moondog from GLBC is better. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with this beer, yet there is nothing that makes me go ""Wow!"" either."
"Overall, an easy drinker that makes for a good long session."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, it's become my 'standard', replacing Rogue's Dead Guy Ale for a 'daily drinker'. Not outstanind in any single way, but overall a very nice beer. Cheers!"
"A nice brew, not spectacular but certainly worthwhile."
"For a lower alcohol brew this ain't a bad choice."
"Malt is big here, slightly sweet and toasted. Fruit and biscuit, some hops but not very powerful. Okay balance, a little watery in the mouthfeel, and the finish is dry with a diacetyl note. Good bitter."
"This is a very well balanced beer in terms of flavor, with the hops and malt both getting equal billing. It reminded me of a cleaner version of their pale ale, to be honest. Somewhat fruity in spots, and caramel-sweet in others. Overall a well-balanced and solid ESB."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. An ABV less than 5 with good taste makes this one very sessionable as well. I am definistely happy to see this in Nebraska and will have to make a 6 pack purchase next time."
"D - A very nice ESB. One of the better beers from Left Hand."
"Easy on the tongue, not too sweet, good hop bittering balance."
"Drinkability is quite high."
"The beer is light-bodied but shows some complexity with the contrast of the caramel, sweet malt, and floral hops. Very drinkable and overall a solid brew."
"Poured a dark orange copper colour with a nice looking pillowy head. Nice head retention on this one with that good looking foamy cap hanging around for several minutes. Smell was both a floral hoppy, as well as some definite sweet malt making for a well balanced smelling brew. Taste, too, was very well balanced with a pronounced, but not too assertive hoppy profile up front with a pleasant bitterness, and a nice subtle sweet malt turning to dry biscuity malt on the finish. I was rather impressed with this offering, and I must admit, I went into this thinking I wasn't going to care much for it. Shame on me, as this turned out to be a good beer, as well as a good representation of the style."
"Overall, this is an excellent ESB; very tasty and enjoyable."
"D- A satisfying, no-frills all. A fair example of the style that Id probably get again."
"This is also very much true of the taste but it is followed by a nice but mild bitterness. It all balances out very well. It's light to medium bodied and quite smooth. Never a bad decision."
"Drinkability is good."
"Nice brew although not 100% inline with the style is represents."
"poured medium amber color three finger light tan head held very well with lots of lacing. aromas of citrus, grapefruit, and pine hops. tasted more like a ipa than a esb. some sweet caramel and bready malts with some hop balance. mouthfeel light to medium and carbonation ok. didn't like the fact i thought i was buying a esb and got something else, don't think i'll buy it again."
"Pours a nice red/orange, with a lively light beige head. Carbonation was good, and those nice streams of tiny bubbles persisted until all the drink had been drunk. Dissipated head left a sticky ring of lace on the inside of the glass. Hoppiness is nice and round, not crisp, and contain hints of citrus. Overall, a very balanced beer, sure to please many a palate."
"Pours with a surprisingly thick 2 finger head, and leaves lots of lace on the glass. It is a light amber with lots of carbonation. The smell is mostly malts and that is what comes though in the mouth, I would like a little more hops. This is a little on the light side, there are good flavors, but something seems to be lacking. I suspect that I could give this to my father in law (the wine drinker) and I don't think he would have a problem. I could see drinking this at a baseball game or some other hot day. A nice beer, and worth trying, but not one I will buy again."
"The beer is ok, but I wouldn't want to drink it all night."
"The body is medium with a very gentle carbonation. Only 4.75% ABV, but not something I could session on."
"D- I really like it and could easily have a few of these."
"I've tasted Left Hand's imperial stout and I know they can craft a decent brew, but a for-profit brewery should not be letting this kind of thing happen."
"Drinkability - A very mellow and easy drinking amber ale. A descent amount of complexity allows for an interesting evening, while it retains enough simplicity to be quaffed with a few friends over dinner."
"This brew pours to a slightly hazy dull amber color with a nice sized head that has pretty good retention and left a nice amount of lacing at the top pf the glass. The aroma is very nice, lots of malt come through with biscuit and caramel scents. Also I am picking up a nice hop aroma that while subtle is there and mixes very nicely. This is a very good aromatic brew, very inviting. The taste while very nice seems to be missing my expectation. From the aromas I was expecting a more robust flavor but is seems somewhat dull. While this being said it is a nice tasting brew just does not live up to my expectations. Some hop taste up front is noticeable but does not live up to the smell, agree that for this style that they should not be overwhelming but should have a little better punch IMO. Also the malts seem to be somewhat bland and I feel that this is what is causing my thoughts on this brew to be so-so. Somewhat sweet flavor but very plain to almost feeling watery. I would say that this brew is fair, nothing to write home about but a fair choice for a sessional brew."
"A middle of the road ESB from Left Hand. Not one of my favorite styles, but I enjoyed it just the same."
"Overall, this seems to be a very smooth, east to drink, ESB. Not as harsh as others of this style that I've experienced. I could see having a few of these during a session."
"Overall: This one was kind of a surprise, but the kind of good surprise Im experiencing more and more lately. A good, from left field (no pun intended) solid pale ale that definitely worth your time."
"This beer poured a clear brown with a decent, persistent head. The smell is quite malty with a touch of bitter notes. The taste is malty and bitter. It is a good balance between the two. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is noticeable. The balance of this beer along with its body makes this a nice drinking beer."
"Overall, I'm impressed with this beer and would like to try it again."
"This beer was a nice surprise. Not very familiar with ESB's but I found this very drinkable. The copper color had a big tan head with a bit of lacing. Head settled down to a half inch or less. This beer had a light hop and faint fruit and red grapefruit. I found this beer to finish nicely and while this may be considered average I enjoyed the brew. Nothing necessarily memorable but a good solid beer and very drinkable. Not overbearing. Enjoyed it and a fun change of pace."
"Pours a nicel clear amber color, nice carbonation, nice one finger foamy tannish head, which then leaves some nice sticky lacying afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, and nice touch of caramel. The taste is sweet malty, slightly hoppy, and a nice undertone of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice ESB, glad to have a chance to try it out."
"Taste seems a bit thin, but it's nothing to sneeze at (I was coming off a sample of Rogue's Brutal Bitter). Hops are prominent, but not super-sharp. They retreat quickly, settling *way* in the the back of the mouth. malts are mild and there's a decent balance between hops and malt."
"Drinkability: Good. Great ball game beer or if you live in Colorado, Great snow shoveling beer!"
"Pours a copper-amber color with a foamy off-white head that coats the sides of the glass with curtains of sticky lace as it recedes. Nose is sweet and malty with some fruity citrusy hops. Taste is toasted malt blended with an earthy and herbal hop bitterness along with a bit of dry grain. Moderate in body and easy-drinking. A good session beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass. The 'bottled on' date is 06/16/06."
"volume 4.8%. A really competent brew!"
"Mouthfeel was very light, but unremarkable."
"Md body and a touch overcarbonated for my liking, and way overcarbonated for the style."
"Unfortunately I found another beer that has the tea-like metallic bitterness that I just don't like. I usually find these flavors in English ales and many US ambers. Don't know if it's the hops or the malt that gives it the flavor that I don't like."
"Drinkability is pretty good on this one, it is tasty, low in ABV, and could be very session worthy."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with a brewed on date on the front label into a pint glass. The color was a clear cooper. It had a average head that dissipated into a permanent thin head. Mild carbonation. Got this as part of a sampler and I know that 2 of the others had something off in the smell department so guessing this one is off a little as well. As a result, nothing really stands out but good background aromas - will rerate flavor after better sample. The mouthfeel was pretty standard. The taste was really good and improved as it warmed up (started too cold - damn mini fridge). ESB's traditionally haven't been my favorites but I've been tasting a lot of them lately and they are growing on me. This one rates up their with the best I've had so far. Not a surprise since it's from Left Hand which is vaulting to the top of my favorite breweries list. Going for a tour in Feb and can't wait. Highly recommend. (4, RR, T,Y)"
"Overall Impression: A fair beer. Not a style that I get too excited about, but this is a good representation in my book."
"Into a pint glass, pours a light clear copper, with good head for a while, pretty nice lacing. Aroma is subtle, but nicely fruity with pale malt. Taste is nicely bitter, floral and fruity and pale malts, some grapefruit. Good body I guess, and overall, just a pretty good beer."
"Beer poured an amber color with a nice strong white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is heavily perfumed with sweet malts. Taste leans more toward the malty side than the bitter side although there is a decent hop finish left lingering. Mouthfeel is resonably full for the style and it is fresh and lively on the palate. Drinkability is good. The lower abv makes this an interesting sessionable beer. Recommended to ESB fans."
"Da pretty good ESB, glad I had the opportunity to try it and would have it again."
"Drinkability: Would be a great session beer, but for the astringency..."
"The beer has a slightly slick and thick mouth. This is a session beer for sure. Easy drinking, enjoyable beer could be divine on cask."
"Not as good as I remember it being, but decent."
"Drinkability: Would seem to be a good session beer...slides down easy...nice dose of flavor but highly quaffable...perhaps a bit too dry on the finish for my taste for an ESB but I'm getting picky....very nicely done beer overall"
"Different from other ESB,s I've tried, but nonetheless nice and enjoyable."
"This is the first beer that the fellas at Left Hand ever brewed, and IMO it's their best offering by far."
"It's a good beer, but I have concerns whether it will be memorable enough. My bottle came out of Left Hand's Mixer, and according to the stamp on the bottle, it's only a month old."
"D-very nice for a light session"
"Pretty tasty and really easy to drink."
"Strong malty base with spicy understones. Hops aroma and presence is good, fills the nose when held there for a bit, but understated compared to the malt, giving a slightly sweet taste The light golden colored ale is also a bit light in the mouth, but not bad. Front end carbonation bite that goes flat off the back of the tongue. Good taste to the beer, but not multidimensional, and a beer to get when it pops up but don't hunt it down."
"A very easy-drinking beer, I'm thinking this would be very good for sessioning: not so much flavor that your palate gets tired, but enough there to keep your tastebuds interested, with a low enoug ABV that you could still stand after a few."
"It looks nice enough, and smells even better, but the flavor is a disappointment. It's a shame it doesn't deliver more. The disconnect from smelling to drinking causes a stark drop-off, and such a let down is hard to get past. Still, it's not totally devoid of drinkability. It's just that you come away thinking it could have been so much more."
"This beer actually suprised me a little as I was expecting something average to mediocre. It is a great example of the style without being too over the top in any area as some brewers attempt. It has a great drinkability and is something I would pick up in a heartbeat for a good malty session beer. Would love to find it on draft."
"Poured into a pint glass, nice amber color with one inch white head that leaves little lace. Smell is of malted barley with hint of some citrus smells. Taste is of a bitter malt with hints with some wheat in the background, very good flavor and easy to drink, leaves a good aftertaste as well. Another good brew from Left Hand Brewing company."
"D- It is so balanced and uncomplicated it seems over before it began. I was done before I could really decide if it compared with some of the other ESB's out there. That could be a good thing. I'd grab it again but I think I prefer Redhook more."
"Citrus hops and chalky/doughy malts. Thought throughout the drinking experience that it was rather uneventful. Nice and goes down smooth and drinkable enough. Just not something I'd knock anyone over to try again."
"This was a weird beer to drink. I have never been into esb's, and this came in a sampl pack so i'm giving it a try. Purs an amber color into my glass with a sligh head that has decent retention and lacing. Small is of slight pine, more bread/ chalky malts, smells ok, but something is off. The taste was of a nutty, slightly hoppy and sweet flavor. Some kinda buttery caramel was the main flavors. I think i might have gotten an old batch of this. The mouth feel is medium bodied with decent coating and weight. The drinkablity is average right now, im going to have to review this beer again for a full picture. Now overall it is an easy drinking esb though. with the nutty and maybe a slight spice being the main flavors."
"Comments: A very good bitter in it's own right but I am partial to the draft version of this beer."
"Dark gold or copper colour in the glass. Off-white head that settled quickly. A strange aroma, sort of grassy and earthy. Flavour is a little odd as well, I opened a couple of them to see if they all tasted like that. My first impression was that it tasted a lot like iced tea. Sweet biscuity malt flavours to start with some light pine and fruitiness. It finishes quite dry, but with only a light hoppiness. Thin to medium mouthfeel. Its not a bad beer, but I just can't get rid of that tea-like flavour that I seem to get from it. Maybe I'll give it a try again if the opportunity presents itself."
"12 oz. bottle. Beer was a dark gold color, crystal clear. Moderate size head, off white in color. Aroma was malt on top, with some citrus style of hops coming through as well. As I inhaled, I also picked up a vinegar smell - made me wonder about the beer. I pushed on to tasting, where the hops outweighed the malt quite a bit. Sweetness only came through towards the end for me, primarily in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was fairly drying, and the carbonation seemed rather high. Body was light and it was fairly refreshing. Overall, an OK beer, but I wasn't that impressed, and the smell was rather off-putting. I will probably try again in case this one was damaged in some way."
"Poured from 12 0z. bottle. Reddish apearance, true to style, but little head and no lacing. Bitter throughout, as expected, with a very dry palate to begin with, that but became less so near the end...left a good finish. Not my favorite beer, but at 4.5% abv, a good one to have if drinking several."
"Drinakability was average. Just a rather bland brew. Nothing offensive just not one that captures your imagination or leaves you wanting another."
"Very much recommend this beer for a nice balance and fresh flavor."
"I don't know how I really feel about this one, I guess it is ok, it's not a bad beer, it just doesn't really shine in any areas."
"-UF"
"12 oz., bottled on 3/1/06 - served in a nonic. It pours a solid chestnut hue with a finger of khaki head that doesn't leave much lacing, but retains a 1/4"" cap of bubbles throughout. The aroma is of citric/piney/floral hops, sweet/buttery malts, dark fruits?, and roasted/chocolate malts. The taste is about the same with the addition of tropical (grapefruit, orange, faint mango) hops that contribute a mild to medium bitterness on top of a medium body that is crisp and refreshing. Overall it is a more-than-adequate ESB that is quite balanced in both scent and flavor. Definitely worth the price and I'm sure it would make a great session brew."
"Mouthfeel was a full medium body, probably due to the lack of carbonation. Flavor really lingered. Good drinkability overall. A fairly solid ESB that was nonoffensive in the taste department but still went down easy."
"Bottom line: Above average American take on a classic English style."
"Mouthfeel- A little tart mixed with sweaty socks. Yet I still gave it a ""3" cause I have a bias for bitters."
"D: Overall fairly drinkable, would make a good sessioner."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Dark copper color with light tan head. Smell of biscuits with a toasted note. Taste is very malty but there is a piney hop note that just sneeks through. Very smooth finish with little to no aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer that i could see having around. Pleasantly surprised by this one."
"Flavor is excellent. Well balanced biscuity-malty-roasty goodness tempered with the right amount of hops (cascade tastes like). The hop level hangs around a mild IPA while the taste and mouthfeel harken to a softer, rounder ale (though of a fat tire for a second; definately biscuit malt in there). I enjoyed the beer thoroughly; give it a try."
"Notes: Its enjoyable and easily consumed but below average in my opinion. As it warmed up the mouth got heavier and more of raw mash type taste came out. Decent."
"Pours solid deep copper color with a finger of head that falls to a patchy, but healthy covering over top. Clarity is very good with just random bubbles coming from the bottom. Nose is all about toastyness from the malt and lightly earthy character from the British hop. The hop is very mild, with the toastyness playing a huge role in this brew. Very enticing beer. Flavor is nice and toasty, with a lighter sweet caramel that comes through on the finish. Bitterness is very mild on the finish, just breaking up the toasty and caramel malt enough. I like it. Feel is a very solid moderate with a light, but appropriate, carbonation. It breaks up the feel just enough to keep it from being too much. I think this is a very nice example of an ESB. Good use of British malt and hop. Moutfeel is very nice as well. I'd have this one again for sure."
"Congrats Left Hand. Glad we now have you in the Ham. This one will go into my regular rotation."
"mouthfeel is nice and crisp, pretty dry. easily drinkable and delicious."
"Overall--I won't be running back to this beer. It was a good try. Maybe if I'm looking for a beer I can drink all day this Spring at a family event I'll pick up a 6'er. I was hoping for more just couldn't find it in this brew."
"Pours a pale amber with decent clarity. The head is a creamy one and a half fingers of light tan foam that will retain very well and coat the glass with lace. Crystal and amber malts in the nose, with some fruit esters like peaches and some suspect dextrins, fairly weak. Sweet flavor, caramel and dextrins, with lots of fruit sweetness and immediately apparent butterscotch. So much about this malty brew hangs on it's balnce; which I felt was executed well with a mild english hop aftertaste. The carbonation is low and the body medium like an ESB should be, but I must say the diacetyl is pushed to the limit. The finish is fruity and slick, but appropriately so, and the drinkability remains relatively good."
"A decent ESB with some flaws that make it a worthwhile, though not essential brew to try."
"12 oz bottle pours a hazy orange copper color, decent off white creamy head that leaves some lacing in the glass, light nutty caramel aroma. Light body and has a crisp carbonated mouthfeel, balanced sweet apple, caramel flavors, nice clean bitterness, finishes dry. Great session brew, very tasty and drinkable."
"Poured a light amber color with a off white color head of foam that left some lace and rings in the glass. It had a light aroma of bitter hops and sweet malts. A little lacking in the aroma department, but good none the less . The taste was sweet malts up front that finished well with some spicy bitter hops. A nice balance of malts and hops. The mouthfeel was light but not watery at all. Very nice! Overall a nice affordable ESB session beer."
"Well done, was itching for a porter, only had this chilled, completely different styles but great after work satisfaction. What I liked was the blend of all elements in this beer. Just a single in a mixed sixer, next time I'll need all six. The way its put together, a refill makes sense."
"I found this to be an easy drinking beer. It definitely got better as it warmed. This would be a good choice as a crossover beer."
"Drinkability is decent, but nothing to right home about."
"The taste is good, a nice blend of malts and hops give it both a sweet caramel taste mixed with some spiciness. There is medium to high concentrations of carbonation. Overall, a good brew that I would visit over again."
"M & D: Very smooth and left a tad of bitterness but overall, very tasty. I could definately drink a few of these. Emma gave it a thumbs up also!"
"12 ounce bottle. Sawtooth ale pours out a partially hazy amber color with half an inch of head. Caramel malt aroma with some fruit and fresh hops. Biscuit malt flavor with mild fruitiness, some caramel, and crisp, fresh hops. Just a little bit of nut flavor too. Well balanced. This beer has a freshness that makes it a real pleasure to drink. Mouthfeel is medium. Good drinkability. This is a surpisingly good example of the ESB style."
"A medium-sized, tan, bumpy, active head. A deep copper clear beer. Candy floss nose, grape juice, some cheesy hops. Fruity and nutty in front. Fairly full in the middle. Some deep malt hints at chocolate. Grapey finish! Quite bitter. Some roasted nuts. A touch of sour grossness. A decent session ale."
"This brew pours a clear light amber color. Its head is large white and fluffy, and sticks around forever. The aroma is nice and hoppy with some fruity notes. The taste is as hoppy as the aroma. Not overpowering, but still strong. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a great brew."
"Poured a hazy brown/amber color with a 1 finger head and good lace. Smells of a nicely roasted malt with caramel, nut and some coffee smells. Good taste of a roasted malt with some hop bitterness but not as much as I expect in an ESB. Caramel, nuts and minor coffee roasted flavors as well. Not a lot of hop flavor but the cause could be that this particular bottle was bottled on 1/5/05 and today is 10/17/05. Medium carbonation and good drinkability. Not a great ESB but a fine beer none the less"
"Overall: Another nice, but not complex beer from this brewery. If the taste rose to the level of some of the other characteristics this could be an exemplary beer. Worth picking up a six pack for sure."
"ESBs are amognst my favorite styles and this is in my personnal upper tier, yum, great finish..."
"The color is a lightly hazy caramel-tinted copper with plenty of carbonation. Head is creamy, off-white, and small. The aroma initially hits with a burst of moderately citrissy hops, but soon gives way to a pleasent caramel malt aroma. The taste is of caramel and bisquity malts with dashes of fruity flavors. Citrissy hops come into play towards the finish and add an assertive bitterness. Hop flavor seems to play a bigger role in this beer than the few English ESBs I've sampled. I'm not complaining though, this has a nice complexity that is enhanced by an ease of drinkability. I could see this being a regular in my fridge rotation."
"I'm more impressed with this beer than I thought I'd be. This is one of those styles that American Micros usually butcher. Pours a nice light copper to straw color. Higher carbonated that expected. Decent head retention. Smells malty, caramelly and nutty. Light hop detection. Tastes are similar to aromas throw in more breadyness, yeastyness, earthyness. Nuttiness reminds me of pecans, nice on top of caramel and toffee flavors. No flavor is dominating. The beer is smooth in its flavors, the carbonation may be a distraction. Mouthfeel is round and just shy of medium. Finishes fairly airy and crisp. Nice subtle hop bittering; not too sweet. A very easily drinkable beer."
"This one poured a darkish amber with a nice frothy foamy head. It smelled great it had hints of toffee or carmel, fruits, cirtusy hops and malt. A very nice tasting beer with some nice bitterness to it and some sweet caramel malts and hints of biscuit character, dark chocolate. This was definatly a try."
"Pours a clear, dark amber, with scant head and little lacing. Mostly lacks a discernible smell, but does possess a modicum of both maltiness and hoppiness. Tastes surprisingly good, malty upfront with a nice dry bitterness following. Well-balanced. Appropriate mouthfeel. A modest, easily enjoyable ESB."
"Drinkability - Not a bad drinking beer, but not a great one either."
"Mouthfeel is quite excellent at first, but declines after that. Still good, just not as good."
"Drinkability is good. This is a mild ale with no flavor that abuses your taste buds. Good tongue cleaning qualities make this a great choice for foods where you want the beer to play a role."
"Paid $1.59 for a 12 oz. single. Looks nice, transparent brown/tan color with little red. Heavy head with lace. Taste is heavy English malts dominating with light bitter hops in the background, again English-like. Aftertaste is all hops and alcohol. Odd for the low ABV. There is also a chemical taste present that I don't care for much at all. Phenol? Kind of mediciney."
"Great biscuit chewiness is nudged aside slowly be a twisted stick of dried herbs (oregano, catnip, epazote). A little peach juice floats by leaving the tongue coated with peach fuzz. Very nice bitter."
"Copper brown and clear in color. The cream colored foam disappeared within a minute, leaving a little lacing. Malt present in the aroma, and few hops. Doughy, initial taste with nutty caramel, mild carbonation and some resin in the finish. A great session beer that goes well with food."
"A clean cooper/amber colored beer. Has a big creamy dark beige head and a nice bit of lace. The aroma is a sweet malt with a hint of caramel. There is also a light floral hop note in the background. The flavor starts with a light sweet malt character which dominates the taste until the finish. In which a smooth hop bitterness sits gentley on the back of your tongue."
"Fairly average amber ale."
"sonofDon"
"PS: It's really hard getting through a six pack of this beer, it's just so bland. Almost like drinking apple cider. I've got two bottles left that are going to be used for cooking."
"Never really heard anything about this brewery before, and I know that it's bad to ""judge a book by its cover"" but I always see this in the stores and think it looks good, so I finally picked up a sixer tonight. Appears a reddish amber color with a pretty decent head, decent retention. Smell is lighty malty and a bit buttery with some nice spicy hops to back it up. Taste isn't bad, isn't excellent. A decent pale malty palate, and more buttery creamy notes, leads to a decent bitter bite at the end, nice and dry, which is pretty good actually. Just not a ton of flavor up front. Bitterness is good though. This beer does have a very redeemingly smooth mouthfeel, light and airy, leading to a high drinkabilty score. It would probably make a great session beer, if it could keep your interest a little more."
"Taste notes:cedar and woody nose, spicy and cidery -all elements are present palate-wise too and there is a peppery finish."
"Overall = I definitely recommend this beer. I could drink several in one sitting. Another fine crafted brew from Left Hand."
"D - Once you get going on this (and the metallic taste subsides) it's a fairly easy drinker."
"Overall: eh. Plenty better ESB's out there."
"Fairly boring but drinkable enough due to its creamy smoothness and slippery soft carbonation. Passable in most regards though; this ESB just doesn't have anything special about it."
"When I saw the name sawtooth I was expecting some king of pine sappy beer. Instead I got a great ale. I feel this beer is way under rated and have turned it on to many of my friends. The pour is amber but tastes much darker. The head was thick and the lace was impressive leaving quite a line. As a whole the beer had a pine nut taste like an IPA but the well cooked backwash of great pale ale. When I recommend this overlooked beer to fat tire drinkers, they switch over right away. Im not a huge fan of all of the left hand six packs but this one tops them all. It tasted as if you biting in to a freshly cut forest tree. If you are in town and have to drink one for the left hand company, this is it."
"Medium bodied."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that soon goes leaving traces of lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts with a mix of hops and malts with the malts dominating, some sweetness, very drinkable different from a lot of ESBs that are hoppy. $1.70 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Pours a light copper/amber color with no real head, but there was lacy evidence that there was once one. Light grassy tones and a bit of tea-like maltiness. Lightly malty and a bit herbal in the hop flavor, with mild blueberry-like fruity esters. Very drinkable and satisfying, especially for being in the lighter spectrum of an ale."
"Overall- very delicious and too easy to drink. A beer I'll look for again."
"Very smooth, rich body align with light carbonation to make for one supreme session ale."
"Drinkability: Easy and boring. Well done but nothing to write home about."
"Pours to an amber-caramel color and sparse white head. Aroma is malty-caramel and citrus. Flavor is a very smoothly-executed British bitter consisting of a moderate hoppiness and caramel malt character. Very quenching and tasty. Not too intense nor insipid. A solid choice if you want a fresher, more local British ESB/pale ale in the States."
"Beer is good. Happy mixed ESB/Pale beering."
"This is a really good ESB. In my opinion, one of the better that I have tried. I recommend trying it."
"This is a must do situation!!!!"
"This beer surprised me in a major way. I wasn't expecting something quite so malty (not because I knew anything about this beer, I just don't tend to drink malty beers). The sweet malty-caramel smell and taste hit the spot and put a smile on my face. I definitely could have had a few more of these bad boys. Give it a try if you can find it, nice alternative to the norm."
"This appeared a clear amber color with about 2 fingers worth of frothy white head. The head quickly died down to a cap of bubbles leaving sparse lacing around the glass. All I can pick up in the nose is the sweet caramel malt. The taste was similar with caramel malt dominating and a slightly fruity sweetness joining it. Even though the finish is slightly bitter the sweetness is still a little excessive. This is about a medium body brew with good carbonation. I easily finished this and could have had another if not for the eventually overbearing sweetness. Overall a decent ESB but there are better choices available."
"I find this beer a bit above average in its drinkability. Very refreshing!"
"This beer poured with a nice deep amber color with a large fluffy head that subsided gradually and left nice lacing on the way down. This is more of a traditional English Bitter very dominated by the malts (a little fruit taste in there as well?) with very little in the hops. It is a little shock to my system moving away from the American hops, but very good. This was an old favorite of mine when I lived in Colorado, and it is nice to see that it is still solid."
"Pours out a hazy copper color with a nice head that goes away to lacing. Smell consisted of malts mostly with a fruity backround, but malts were way stronger than the fruity tones. Taste was ok. Malts show up quickly but then mix in with some fruit notes and then the hops take over everything. Blends in quite nicely though. Mouthfeel was medium with a good enough carbonation in this thing. A decent ESB to say the least."
"The mouthfeel is smooth at the start with a short caramel dry finish. Medium bodied. Overall drinkability is good as this has a nice flavor and seems light in alcohol."
"A bit too sweet for my bitter tastes, but still a nice brew and one I'd recommend for what it's worth."
"12 ounce bottle, W/ bottled on dating, FRESH. Found this stuff, down in NJ, never seen it before in NY state. Pours a mid auburn, honeyish color, low carbonation and head, tiny bit of lacing. Nice grainy, bready nose. Mild sweet malt notes, soft on the old palate for this mellow Brit style ale. A wee bit lacking in the flavor department for my tastes, but what remains is a drinkable, balanced session brew. Worth a try."
"An easily quaffable brew."
"Drinkability - Pleasant enough but certainly unusual for the style"
"Pours a nice copper color, with a nice amber tint to it. Very sweet malty nose. Sweetly malty, but a bit watery with a tiny touch of the hops as it rushes down your gullet. Just the slightest tangy finish doesn't prevent a very this overall mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, mellow, easy drinking, but somewhat indistinct."
"White 1/2"" head over a copper brew, with nice lacing. Slight ""beery"" aroma, nothing stands out much. Taste is very well balanced, not as much bitterness as I would expect in an ESB. Mouthfeel and drinkability were great. Big time sessionability with this one."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mildly malty scent with a good hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a pale malt flavor with a nice floral hop finish. It goes down easy with a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine extra special ale. It has good flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"In the tasting, the bittering hops really stand out. This is a dry beer with a light malt presence. After the swallow, the hop lingers. Moderate body with a high level of carbonation. A fairly typical, but tasty, APA worthy of another."
"Pours a clear light copper color, with a white foamy head that disappeared quickly. From the looks, it seems almost watery. There was some good lacing, and no apparent carbonation problems. Smells slightly of citrus, and not much else that I could identify. Tastes astringent slightly sweet malt, with a dry finish. There was a slight hop presence in the finish, but it seemed to lack character. I found this to be thin, however the carbonation was right. I didn't think it seemed very drinakble. I don't know if this one was just off, or what. I am usually fond of Left Hand, but this one was not one that I would care to have again."
"Quite a bit of body for such a low abv. Great appearance... medium to dark amber with a chunky head and decent lacing. Smell was sweet and malty. Taste was sweet, smooth and ended in a nice light bitter quality. Some fruity notes with a nice finishing hop flavor. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and a pleasant surprise. Very drinkable and smooth. A definite recommendation."
"This is an interesting brew, similar to a fresh Young's ESB on tap, mixed 70/30 with a Lagunitas or Stone Pale Ale. Satisfying in many aspects, very refreshing, and easy to drink. A very enjoyable brew. Recommended."
"Whew. This is an ESB for sure. Very sweet, very much malt flavor, again: sweet carmel / diluted molasses. Pours a nice deep reddish brown with an avearge little head. Smell is very smooth and rich, lets you know you're in for a Bitter. Tiny little hops kick up mid-taste, but subside to the sweet malted grains. I've always found it funny that bitters aren't really very bitter at all. This one is smooth and slippery like maple syrup. It's good and has a nice thick mouth on it. Very unassuming, and yet addictive. A great example, and much better than other offerings I've tried."
"Would make a good changeup session ale."
"Overall, a solid ESB. Nothing exciting, but no big negatives either."
"If Left Hand Brewing would beef up the flavor and the body they'd have a much better beer. It improves somewhat as it warms, but I can't pull the trigger on the next highest taste score. Cliff Notes review: Sawtooth Ale is a decent, drinkable ESB and is a definite improvement on this brewery's Milk Stout."
"Just a touch too watery of a thin mouthfeel. Is it better in a bottle? In my experience, it doesnt seem to sit well in kegs, yet it seems like others have problems with bottles. Who knows.... for me this beer is excessively drinkable, a great ESB I wont forget. Cheers to a good session beer."
"Not even knowing this was an ESB, but I thought it would be a well hopped ale, I enjoyed this very drinkable ESB. It poured a nice clear amber with a soft white head that laced fair. The nose was caramel, dark fruit and citrus hop. The taste had a caramelized malt, biscuit bread flavor, with a fairly good dose of floral and citric hop. The mouth is left with a hoppy aftertaste while the drinkability is aided by the sweeter than expected malt flavor. A very drinkable busy ale. Thanks Celina wine staff for the recommend."
"One of the first beers in a long, long time that I couldn't even finish. I won't be trying this brewery again."
"Pours a light amber out of the bottle with hardly any head or carbonation. Slightly sweet, slightly nutty nose. Hints of caramel, nuts, and pine on the palate, with a bit of astringency. Finishes smooth and sweet. Not a remarkable beer, but good enough for one without high expectations."
"12 oz bottle, ""Bottled on 05 20 03"" stamped on bottom right of label. Pours a clear copper amber, essentially no head, and minimal lacing. Not much of an aroma, maybe some candied caramel apple and piney hops. Mouthfeel feels a lot more carbonated than it looks. Taste is somewhat putrid. I'm beginning to think I got a skunky bottle that got lightstruck sitting on the shelf as a single. English ESBs are my favorite style but I can't even finish this glass. I'll give Sawtooth Ale another try somewhere down the line and see if this was just a bad bottle."
"Poured a rich amber color with a thin white lacing. The first thing that really stood out to me in both the flavor and the aroma was the nice, round bitterness of the hops, along with some light fruity notes. This had a very nice bitterness with a nice, clean finish, and was surprisingly drinkable for a beer with this kind of hops profile. Not bad at all."
"Clear copper appearance with a frothy white head. Strong fruit smell with malt sweetness and a bit of hops. The taste was light, clean and bitter, but some fruit was just taking over (in a good way) and I could not pick out what it was... I really, really liked it because it was definitely NOT syrupy or overbearing. It just kind of hung in the air. The mouthfeel was crisp but not as bitter and dry as most of the other ESB's I have been drinking. This was pretty drinkable and that fruit overtone did not get in the way. This may be worth a case sometime in the future."
"This is a really nice English-style ESB. It pours our a nice light copper colour with a small off white head. Aromas are very hoppy, slightly malty, and quite balanced. The taste is very balanced as well with a nice hop bite on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is very good. A good session beer option"
"Tasted: 03/30/04 (lowered Mouthfeel from 4.5 to 4)"
"Bravo for Left Hand. This is an excellent mellow ale, perfect for everyday drinking, but still full of character and charm."
"I like the earthy, buttery English mix when in the right context. This is close. Nose of toffee dropped into a basket of flour and leaves then pulled out and left on the dashboard in August. Flavor runs malt heavy though the tinny hops keep it from tilting too far. Fluent through the pipes. Not bad, yet not really something I would keep on hand."
"Not one of my favorite beer styles.When poured, this beer had a small sized ivory head with fine sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was clear with some carbonation observed and the hue was amber.The nose was definitely malty, malty and malty.The flavor was sweet tasting along with some hops.It had a smooth and tingly mouthfeel and this beer left a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass."
"Medium copper color. Large head. Aroma is malty. A medium bodied bitter. Malts are nutty and sweet. Hops are piney and they tend to linger a little and finish kind of sweet. A nice very drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet"
"This beer poured a dark amber color with an average head and little lacing on the glass. The aroma was hoppy and malty, but I couldn't find anything else. The flavor was dominated by the malts, but there were hints of caramel. Fairly smooth and enjoyable. I would have it again."
"Lefthand Sawtooth Ale: from a bottle dated June 24, 2003. That is what I call a fresh bottle. Poured a deep amber, nicely colored and fairly clear. Nice dense head, dissipating down to nice coverage. The aroma was fairly hoppy, floral. As I had anticipated from the aroma, this brew was nicely hopped, but equally well balanced by the almost caramel malts. Nice lingering malty aftertaste. Very nice."
"My left hand gives this one a thumbs-up! Recommended."
"An ESB? Wow, I was way off. My single bottle did not give any indication of the style, and I was guessing a light Scottish Ale. Well, style aside, it was a nicely crafted beer. Nice, sweet malt backbone. As it warmed, the aroma was something of cotton candy. Brisk hopping with a finish that just faintly hinted of some fruit I could not quite identify. Quite clean at the end."
"Deep amber color,slight and dissipating head. Aroma was malty and pleasantly hopped. Taste had a balanced malt hop flavor and finish faded rather quickly. Overall impression is that this is a solid sturdy pale ale but not exceptional. A good session beer and would go well with food."
"Its a nice copper color with a slight cream colored head. Smells like caramel, with a slight citrus odor as well. These are also present in the taste. Its not a bad beer at all, but not one of my favorites of this style. Something i would take if i was offered it, but not something i would seek out in the future."
"Nice deep copper color. Very clear with a thick creamy head. Aroma was mild and malty, somewhat fruity and earthy. Taste was very pleasant. Initial taste was light sweetness with flavors of carmel and sweet malt, with a hint of roast. Fruit flavors developed in the middle, and finished with a nice floral bitterness. Could use a bit more bittering hops, but a very drinkable ESB."
"An easy drinker. Lighter in body than I was expecting and appropriately carbonated. If my packy decides to carry this I will drink it again."
"A good looking ale of clear amber/copper that has a huge white head. The head lingers well and creates generous lacing. Nose of malt, bread, and grain. Sweet starting flavor from the malt with a bit of hops to add great balance. This is a nicely crafted ale that is just a bit light on body, but is very drinkable. Worth a pint or two."
"As it slips from the bottle into my glass a glistening copper color, the head median in size, spumescent in texture and the color a winsome light tan. All malt is the nose, crisp, clean and fresh with the start somewhat sweet, the top light to medium in feel. Finish has specific acidic bite, the hops lenient in their spiciness, quite dry and a decent beer for the forth coming hot summer afternoons."
"A sweet and sour mix of malt and hops in the aroma, and blended pretty well. Very smallish head, that goes to only a ring around the top. Amber and clear. Flavor is similar to aroma, a sweet and sour mix. Seems a little watery to me. Fairly soft mouthfeel with a well balanced carbonation. Pretty average ale to me. It took me a bit, but it finely dawned on me that there was a flavor I didn't like. It's the hops flavor that is too similar to tea. Sam Adams lager has the same quality. Not appealing to me. I've liked the other beers I sampled from this brewery better."
"Nice rich copper color with not much head but kept a nice lace down the glass.Smell was very malty and fruity with some dough-like aromas.Taste is very fruity with good balance of hops thrown in but it did leave an odd aftertaste.Seems to be quaffable Iam on my first with five more to go."
"Ah, great beer. Id gladly do an English-style session with pints of these. I can only dream of this beer on caskthe fruitiness must be overwhelming"
"Normally I turn my nose at ESBs, but this one has style, body, and taste that many lack."
"(12oz bottle-Bottled on 12-17-02)-- Pours a nice clear copperish color and the decent thick, creamy head and very good retention. On the nose the aroma of grains, citrus hop, hints of caramel and very light fruity esters. On the palate the flavors consisted of caramel, some biscuit malt, citrus hop flavors, mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is slightly tingly and smooth; medium bodied... tasty brew."
"Bronze in color with a chill haze. Off-white head with good lacing. Aroma is malty with a citric, lemon zest aroma. The flavor is somewhat biscuity, with sweet caramel malts, balanced by the citric hop bitterness. Overall, a well-balanced tasty ale. I really enjoyed this one."
"Orange-amber color. Thin, sticky beige head with some retention. Lacework is pleasing to the eye. The aroma is fruity, malty, caramely and sugary. The taste is subdued hops, fruity esters and a small bitter after bite. Hop tones are herbal. Body is better than medium, but not full. Better than average ESB here."
"This brew pours with a light copper color and a foamy white head. The aroma is metallic and malty. Smooth body with a heavy malt roast flavor and an oppressive sharp bitterness. Not well balanced, not at all a favorite."
"Not too bitter, but has a nice strong hops presence. Maple syrup colored with a medium thick off-white head. Based on recommendations from other drinkers I let it warm up a little before trying and I was glad I did. Clean flavored with citrusy aftertaste. I have enjoyed all of Left Hand's offerings so far (the Deep Cover and JuJu Ginger are good too) and look forward to the next."
"Not very hoppy for an ale, very subtle, but good mouth feel. A fairly good head, little retention, little lace. Kind of average finish, not bad, but nothing to scream about. I guess I was expecting a little more. Just slightly above average. I wouldn't seek it out, but if I saw it in a bucket of ice at a party..."
"Clear caramel color, moderate small bubbles.  Tan head settles at 1/4 of an inch.  Sweet toffee aroma, touch of citrus.  Quite malty in flavor, big first impact.  Slight touch of breadiness, a little cinnamon mixed in.  Hops are calm.  Well balanced and good taste but not a lot of memorable flavor.  Finishes a bit flat.  I was looking for more in an ESB.  Like but don't love."
"Again, nothing to shout about, but decent in all aspects."
"Great beer! Spot on for the style. Thanks to Arctic Liquors for the sample."
