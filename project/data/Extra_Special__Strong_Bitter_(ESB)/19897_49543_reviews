"Very light body for an ESB.  Have definitely had better."

"Nice bready malts with just enough hop balance.   A nice, lighter version of the style that is good for warm weather.  I have had better in the style, but this is certainly enjoyable."

"A very good esb. It lacks in hops, but decent flavor."

"O: I was torn trying this beer: I like Evolution, but then I realized ""lol, ESB"" and passed it up time after time. Well, after finally giving this a chance, I can now say that this is an okay example of an ESB - that fact I actually half-like this is a minor miracle (take note, I *don't* like ESBs). Still, there's a good chance I'm going to forget about this beer a month from now."

"O) A bit too malty for an ESB. The body is fine, but the taste is a bit thin."

"O: the beer starts off strong with straightforward aroma and a nice pour, but just doesn't deliver. The overall impression is that the beer is unfinished."
""
""
""
""
"O: worth a try, its attributes come together rather well, but overall it could come off as subdued for some."

"Overall: This ESB is surprising in how much like an ESB it’s not. That being said, it’s a tasty beer. Very sessionable, and pleasant, but nothing special either."

"Very drinkable every day beer!"
""
""
""

"Moderate carbonation and a body on the thicker side of medium with a dry finish. Overall this beer is good, nothing stands out about it being great though. Its my first Evolution beer and I've heard good things, maybe I just chose the wrong beer for my first one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing really great here. It has a flavor profile that I'm not in love with but I could drink a few none the less."
""
""
""
""
"O: Its ok. Nothing great, but something that might be sessionable if it were at your local bar. I think the cidery flavor really is a little too pronounced for me to enjoy it fully."
""
"I'd have this ESB again but probably not on a regular basis."
"Pouring this into a pint glass reveals a surprisingly murky, darker amber colored liquid, topped with a 1/2 inch cap of creamy, off-white head that sinks to a thin layer, but still retains well; a bit of soapy lacing. Aroma of grains and pretty much straight up homebrew wort. Taste of bready grains, caramel, with a touch of citrus pith, and some nice herbal hoppage. Pretty light and easy-drinkin', light-medium mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter in the aftertaste. Nothing spectacular, but still pretty nice overall."
""
""
"Overall: Pleasant beer, but not a benchmark for the style. Didn't make me vomit after playing in a soccer game, good sign."
"Decent offering, but not one I'd get again."
""

"O - I found Evo's Exile ESB to be a drinkable and enjoyable beer. It doesn't really taste like a traditional ESB, but definitely has some of the characteristics of the style."

"I had this one down in Rehoboth on a vacation that I was on there. I hadn't ever heard of the brewery so I figured I'd give them a try. This was the only brew I could get at the time from EVO so I ordered one up. The beer poured out as a copperish gold color with a thin white head on top. The smell was malty and had some sweetness of caramel to it also. The taste of the beer was malty, dry and bitter in the finish. The mouthfeel was on the lighter side, nothing too impressive. Overall this brew was decent, I didn't hate or love it but I would probably drink it again."
"Had this on tap at buckley's, deep copper pour, 2"" white head, good lacing. The aroma is bready, malty, nutty and a good amount of sweetness. The taste follows the nose, lingering bitter finish. The body is light medium, good carbonation. I really enjoyed it, it was easy drinking and it went well with my steak."
""

"O- When thinking of a bitter beer, I typically think of hop heavy in flavor. This was heavy in the malts and light in hops. Not my cup of tea. Still not bad, just wouldn't drink it again... unless someone sent it to me!"
"Thanks, smokeypeat, for the opportunity"
"Pours a hazy copper body with a good amount of carbonation supporting its foamy head. Enticingly rich malty aromas of caramel and toffee hit me right off the bat, along with a subtle earthiness that's very appealing. The caramel notes are extremely prominent, and the overall impression is that of a very sweet beer. Toasty malts take a backseat to the more sugary and fruity notes. The hops are more complex on the palate than the nose would suggest, with herbaceous and faintly citrusy notes coming in, but never quite balancing out the malts. This is certainly one heck of a tasty beer, but it's lacks the balance that esbs supposedly aspire to. Overall, as long as I ignore its supposed style, I like this quite a lot. It's extremely flavorful and as pleasurable to drink on its own as with food."
"eep orange amber. A very dark color which took me a little by surprise to be honest. A very nice three inches of head formed on the top in a good light tan to off white color. Great retention had this thing hanging around for what seemed like forever. Some sediment actually poured out of the bottom and graced over the top of the foam at the end. A very hazy and cloudy brownish amber this was and it had a very full look to it. A very nice aroma of deep caramel malts was the first thing I noticed. A nice subtle hoppiness as well, though sweet. The flavor was very full, almost a hoppy scotch ale of sorts. Very big with a grainy and chewy kind of feel to it. Medium body with ample carbonation led to a great rich feel and this was just a superb drinker"
"O - A middle of the road ESB...I like Evolution's Lot 3 so I will be giving these guys another shot"
"The beer appeared a nice clear copper color with a nice creamy white head that faded too quickly, but did leave a little lacing. The aroma, was as expected, a nice caramel and biscuit flavor with a nice hint of citrus hops that ultimately ended in a nice balanced finish. The taste was good, well balanced, a nice malt body, biscuit with a light hop. The beer had a medium mouth feel, I found it very easy to drink. Overall, a nice beer, nothing special, not complex by any means, but a well done beer."
"Overall an ok beer but not a great esb. Would certainly drink over others if the choice was limited. But can drink far better beer also than this."
"Overal, a nicely balanced and drinkable beer. Nothing complex. Simple and slightly boring."
"O: High-quality ESB. Good balance and flavor"
"Not that great, incredibly thin mouthfeel, nice aroma, but fails in the taste. Quite disappointed."
"O - A little on the malty side, but still comes out fairly balanced. Its ok, nothing mind-blowing about it."
"O - Not bad but it never really blew me away. It was easy drinking but I am not sure if it was an old keg or not but it could have used a bit more hops."
"O: Very drinkable and would have several others if I had them. Sadley I only brought one home from DE with some others from their brewery...mmm."
"Overall kinda meh, yeasty doesn't go well with an ESB, and it wasnt very bitter, the hops also didn't seem to mesh well with teh overall beer and style, although the malts weren't bad."
"D - not as bossy as other ESBs, but not a bad entry. definitely gives the general mindset of drinking in an old English pub"
"Overall a great tasting brew! With better head retention and aroma characteristics this could be world class."
"This is a pretty nice beer, tasty and very solid. I like a nice ESB and this fits in that category. I'd definitely like to have one of these on tap."
"Nice amber color. Head doesn't stickl around for long. Nice bready sweetness from the malts on the nose followed by a little hop profile. Taste resembles the smell but the hops are a little more prominent this time around. Overall a decent brew fro evolution."
"O - Very easy drinking and balanced, I could session a Sixer of this over the course of an afternoon."
"Very good or excellent? Your mileage may vary. It's damn good & easy to sip. Amazing that more brewers can't get down into the low ABV numbers & brew beer this good. Kudos to Evo, again."
"The beer poured a beautiful cloudy caramel color with a nice tan head. The aroma was of caramel and light floral hops. The taste had a nice biscuity sweetness with caramel undertones with a nice floral hoppy finish. The feel was light and dry. What a great beer! I have found this scattered about throughout Maryland, and everytime it's the same wonderful experience. Hopefully the availability will stay up as I can't get enough of this fine ESB."
"D - Long time to pour but eventually settled down. This one needs some work but the potential is there."
"O- A good ESB to add to the regulars. It is an easy drinker with all the correct flavors. If there is one complaint, the beer might be a little green. Still one that I would accept without hesitation."
"My eventual pour created a finger of thick ecru head with decent retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a grassy hop bitterness up front, with a slightly malty sweetness underlying. Mouthfeel was medium and it was a really well-balanced ESB in terms of flavor on the tongue. There was some bitterness, but not enough to overwhelm the malt. Finish was likewise pleasant, slightly bitter initially, then allowing the malt a chance on the extreme finish."
"drinkable - yep."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, some malts. Taste is dominated by hops, no malt at all, considerable bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew."
"Overall, it's a fairly decent beer in terms of its sum parts, but production problems leave it sloppy and unfocused with a limited drinkability."
"This is certainly one of my favorite session beers. It is a beautifully done recreation of this classic style. It is no more or less than a perfectly brewed extra special bitter. While it is difficult to find, State Line Liquors in Elkton Maryland almost always has it in stock."
"D - I love the ESB style, but this one misses the mark for me... After a strong start in terms of appearance and aroma, this one quickly drops off... Not an offering I would drink again, let alone recommend..."
"DRINKABILITY: The more I drank, the more I enjoyed. The thick foamy head gave it a nice old fashioned feel. After each sip from my snifter, I was able to lick away my foam mustache and enjoy another taste of this fine ale."
"Poured a nice pumpkin orange with a big frothy white head that left spots of lacing here and there. Very clear with bubbles streaming from the apex of the glass. Very fruity with hints of lychee, pears, and white grapes. Touch of metallicness and honey. Flavor is highly fruit-forward, with the aforementioned flavors highly pronounced. Not much malt detectable except more clover honey and bitterness is clean in the finish. Dry and well carbonated. Alcohol warmth is slightly noticeable, odd for a beer less than 6% drinking like it's 8-9%."
"D- Very enjoyable and easy to drink. This is the second beer I have had from Evolution and I am impressed with what they are doing."
"D: Easy to drink, could definitely down a lot of these"
"Pours a deep amber with a small off-white cap. Good clarity. Caramel, light cherries and a touch of breadiness in the nose. Light to medium body with adequate carbonation for the style. The malt stands tall throughout. A touch of biscuity sweetness, fruit and a mild bitterness in the finish. They found a nice balance of hops and malt with just the right amount of bitterness and fruity sweetness left lingering behind."
" The flavor is rich with malt and has accents of toasted grain w/ light cocoa and biscuit sweetness. The hop flavor is pleasant and accents the taste of the malt with a gentle pine quality. There is a mild tinge of yeast which brings to mind orange rind and subtle apple notes w/ a dry nutty flavor following it up. I enjoy how the malt flavor becomes more pronounced as it warms w/ a mild dark sugar taste and hint of wood in the hop flavor to keep pace. There is gentle stone fruit elements faintly in the taste w/ a light coffee tinge. This is a seriously good ESB a complex well brewed ale w/ high drinkability-a taste I could enjoy many of. I wish this were brewed closer to me."
"Exile ESB, bright orange amber, seems to be paler in color than the Fuller's version and without the exploding fruitiness that is characteristic of that London beer. The pour garnered a little bit of head that quickly fell off. The beer has a rounded earthy malt aroma that is spiked with a little red apple. The beer is bready sweet with ripe fruit that gives way to a balanced, minty, hop bitterness in the finish. The beer has a chewy mouthfeel with some contributions from tannins from the grain husk and hops."
"mouthfeel matches taste perfectly with the slight carbo and creaminess making this a(nother) quite drinkable brew from the First State! easy to session in a nice pub in New Castle (i wonder if any carry this on draft?) i imagine...:)"
"Mouth and drink is on for an American ESB, so even carbonation with an APA and able to drink a few,"
"The taste was an even balance between understated hops and rich toasty malt. The hops were rather delicate with floral and phenolic notes but little lasting bitterness. The mouthfeel included a little sourness and tang but was overall pleasant. Overall, pretty delicious."
"Overall, I enjoy this beer. I could see a sixer make its way into my fridge if I could find one and I'm not the type that has the patience for a sixer of the same thing."
"Very simple and very tasty a good beer from EVO. I look forward to tasting some of there other beers."
"Drinkability? This isn't a tough bird to drink....just needs a bit of a flavour boost in the right direction to make things more interesting."
"M/D - good carbonation and mouthfeel, alot of flavor that I wasn't expecting"
"A pretty solid offering from Evolution resulting in a toasty bitter beer."
"A: Small dose of tightly packed hear with significant lacing, medium copper in color - 4.00, S: Caramel and biscuit aromas pervade, subtle doughy sweetness on the nose as well as a slight earthy hop aroma - 4.00, T: Medium to high bitterness, quite earthy hop profile, nutty and with a strong caramel base - 3.50, M: Medium bodied and with a noticeable alcohol warming - 3.50, D: Overall a solid representation of an ESB, hop bitterness tends to play a larger role than most ESBs - 3.50"
"D= probably rather drinkable if it's what is being served or on-tap, worth the try in the bottled version."
"Pours a beautiful amber color with a lot of carbonation and leaves a one finger white head that left behind a lot of lacing. The nose is malt upfront, with noticeable citrus and caramel with a some hops. The taste is much more hoppy than the smell, as well it has noticeable malt and caramel in the nose, but much harder to detect the citrus. Its balanced out pretty well, not overly bitter or overly sweet. Decent mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"A very easy drinking balanced toasty ESB, Evolution hit the target here."
"Pours deep amberish with nice fluffy, slick looking head. Smell is malty and deep, with a firm but subtle leafy hop aroma. Flavor is bready, toasty, a little caramel, with a leafy, herbaceous, piny hop character. Nice round bitterness on the end. Slightly sprightly mouthfeel. Tasty."
"I had high hopes for this one. Decent ratings on BA, but I figure the beer lost something in the bottle. Light brown (muddy water) in the glass with a subtle head, light body and somewhat spritzy carbonation. Nothing really in the nose and a somewhat one-dimensional taste profile. Definitely drinkable, but nothing to write home about. I'll have to try it on tap."
"Had this beer as part of a tasting at the brewery. The 5oz glass I tried had nice carbonation, head retention, and color. The aroma was good with malt and hops that were present, but not too strong for an English style beer. I did think that the mouthfeel and flavor were a little too malty even for an English style beer. It was on its way to having the maltiness of a bock. A little more attenuation would make it a very good ESB."
"Drinkability: this was a very easy drinking beer with some bolder than normal flavors for the style. Worth giving this one a try."
"Very Sierra Nevada like, crisply bitter with a lingering mixture of sweetness and hoppiness in the finish. Medium bodied brew that was incredibly drinkable and tasty."
"Very nice coppery color. A nice sized, tight, off white head. Floral aroma-quite hoppy-dry hopped with Cascades? Solid malt flavor with a great bitterness against it. Pleasantly hoppy though not overly bitter. Nice balance between the 2. Trace of lingering sweetness. Good body. I find this dangerously drinkable. The whole package is quite well done. Quite refreshing too."
