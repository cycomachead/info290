3.73,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This isn’t going to blow you away flavor-wise but it’s definitely flavored enough, and the cask conditioning nicely melds the flavor here and just gives this an all around kick-ass drinkability. I’d always be good for a pint of this if I saw it here on cask. Nice stuff.","Kegatron","Sep 21, 2011"
3.48,-10.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O: Good, but not great. Pretty decent. And likely a bit of Homer in my grading as Deschutes is one of my favorites.","harrymel","Jul 27, 2011"
3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O: Not as hop forward or bitter as I remember, but still a tasty malt-forward beer. I don't quite know how it holds the line to the style though.","Scotchboy","Jul 23, 2011"
3.41,-12.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"What we have here, seemingly, is a decent amber ale. It needs a fair bit more biscuit edge and noble hop bitterness to slide into the ESB zone.","biboergosum","Jul 15, 2011"
4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is the kind of beer I could enjoy many of in one sitting. Thanks for reading, and Cheers!","Dunkelhund","Jun 15, 2011"
3.5,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a standard one finger head in length, the head is slightly off white, but just barely. Mostly big bubbles in the head, but there are a fair amount of small bubbles underneath that. Decent lacing throughout the glass. The head isn't hanging around too long, but it's not going away completely, something that I have found common in Deschutes beers. The body is a cloudy dark orange color, very little visibility through this beer. The color is unique, a little dark for the style, but I don't really care. The carbonation looks just about right. Overall the look is pretty impressive. On the smell, it's pretty malt based, very small hop note in there, but that works for the style. Does it smell good? Yeah, great? Not at all, pretty standard. You can tell the malts will taste good, but still, not an amazing smell. Maybe it's just the style I'm not a fan of, but the smell is only ok for me. I expect this to be a solid beer, just not my thing, but I'll give it a fair chance. Yeah, not my kind of beer here, I have had better ESB's though, so I'm a little confused here, overall it's not bad, but not too great either. The alcohol is a little too prominent in this beer for only 5.3%, the hops are very minute and the malt is just not the type I like. All over it's just not very balanced, and it's kinda all over the place. The alcohol is probably the most dominant factor really, which is never good. Then after the alcohol it's just a random mixture of malts and small hops. I'm trying to rate this beer in terms of the style and I think that it's just messing with my head. As far as a beer goes - it's just not that great for me. A little sour, which is unwanted, and the carbonation adds to the weirdness. Despite all these flavors it does have some watery characteristics to it. It kind of tastes like a mix between a scotch ale and a IPA. It's a very weird beer, and perhaps it's just the style, but like I said I have had better ESB's, so I dunno. Mouthfeel is decent, it's big enough to support the style, and the carbonation is right. Drinkability is ok, but these weird flavors for sure don't help. Overall I'm very confused with this beer, and I'm sure I'm just over thinking things and confusing myself, but only to some extent, it's a very weird beer. With all that being said, it's still not a terrible beer, I'd drink it again, but only if nothing else was available. Strange beer.","MaltsOfGlory","May 30, 2011"
3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The aroma was light, lots of grain and light spice with a smooth, mellow and light fruity hint that popped up toward the finish. Smooth mellow flavor with a n even cosistency. My only knock is it came off as more of a mild ale to me as the hop flavor was not really too high and not much in the way of bitter flavor. Easily drinkable though as no real heavy feeling or flavor.","mikesgroove","May 22, 2011"
3.53,-9.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Another addition from one of the old notebooks. Brought back to us from Oregon by my (ex-)wife's uncle. Poured a nice amber color with a little light tan head. Aromas of light hops, sweet malt and caramel. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with citric hops, caramel and sweet malt.","emmasdad","May 11, 2011"
3.41,-12.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O- I'm dissapointed I have to say. Deschutes normally crafts devine brews, but this comes up short. Its above average, but not to the level I expect from Deschutes, I love a good ESB too, it may be my favorite style. Needs a little punching up. Since I can't find this locally and there are some other good local ESB's around it might not be a bad thing.","HugePlume","May 11, 2011"

3.55,-9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Had this on tap at the Deschutes brewpub in Portland. Pours a copper colour with thin white head, leaving small patches of lacing. Smells of earthy hops and caramel malt. Flavour has very mild bitterness. Nice carbonation level on this. An easy drinking beer, but no where near the level of many of the other beers on tap at Deschutes.","kwjd","Dec 22, 2010"

4.05,3.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a moderate orange-copper color with a nice white head and a pretty good amount of lacing. The nose has some light malt as well as some floral and earthy hops. The taste strikes a nice balance between the hops and malt, with the mouthfeel surrendering to a bit of bitterness. Drinks quite well and this would be one nice brew to have locally.","Thorpe429","Nov 09, 2010"

3.68,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Do they make Married Man DESB? (Do they even make double ESBs?) Regardless, this brew pours a mostly clear reddish-amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grass, flowers, light orange peel, and light slightly blackened biscuits (they were only left in the oven a few seconds too long). The taste is very similar, though the bitterness (mostly from citrus hops eliciting a sensation of orange peel) is stepped up to a greater degree. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, wet feel. Overall, a nice ESB that lives up to its third letter.","TMoney2591","Sep 12, 2010"
3.64,-6.7,4.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Bachelor ESB poured an impressive dark amber with significant red undertones from the bottle that I purchased at a local Portland store. The head was modest, but present, with good lacing. I was somewhat less drawn to the scent of this one when compared to many of the other reviewers -- it seemed a bit flat for my tastes, with an acetic, lemon smell accompanied by faint pine and other resins. The mouthfeel and taste are much more rewarding with a bold, yet balanced carbonation, and predominant flavors of grapefruit, dry herbs, and malts.","sdawson","Jul 28, 2010"
4.07,4.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D - Very good drinkability, at 5.3% this is a nice beer to go through a few of in a sitting. Will definitely get again.","GarrettMD","Jul 09, 2010"

3.73,-4.4,4.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Pleasant citrus and floral aromas. Fairly thin in the mouth, not overly carbonated. Some distinct malty bite at first. This quickly faded into a deceptively watery finish that expanded into a lingering grapefruity bitterness. Pretty drinkable, although the bitterness on the finish might grow to be a bit much after a pint or so.","grittybrews","May 04, 2010"
4.05,3.8,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"One finger white small-bubbled head, medium dissipation with significant lacing. Clear copper body with significant carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Caramel malts dominate the nose balanced by floral hops. Malt forward taste profile, some breadiness, a bit sweet, with a bit of hop bitterness on the back end, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, decent effervescence. Really drinkable at this ABV, very sessionable, tasty, worth a try. Another winner from Deschutes.","jdense","Apr 18, 2010"
3.93,0.8,4.5,4,4,3,4,"M/D - The taste doesn't cloy or stick to your mouth, it goes down well and stays like that. The drinkability is above average. Perhaps it's just the style, but I would have enjoyed more kick to the hop taste.","ThirdGen","Apr 08, 2010"

3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Appearance has a roasted amber color to it with a thin head and less than fair lace. Smell of rich malts of caramel with some citrus fruits. Taste has a nice malty caramel citrus flavor with a nice hop that come from behind. Mouthfeel is medium with good body and carbonation. Overall this is a nice solid ESB.","Bookseeb","Jan 26, 2010"
4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Classic English style ESB. Doesn't try to be something it's not (i.e. stray from the malt-hop balance). In a context of 2010 (or 2009) where hoppiness seems to be a primary virtue, this brew may not measure up. It's not ""exciting"". But, in a context of perfect hop/malt balance this offering from Deschutes is near perfection. Easy to drink, very easy to enjoy. I could drink it all spring-summer-fall.","ricke49","Jan 17, 2010"
3.37,-13.6,4.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: Emphasis on bittering hop, moderately strong ale. The caramel malt bite lowers the drinkability for me.","GreatWeisseHope","Dec 30, 2009"

3.73,-4.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Nice amber color with a small amount of head. Smells of bread, slightly piny hop scent, malts. Tastes bready with a nice hop flavor, hops are more piney than citrus.

A pretty, dark orange/light brown color. Very nice malt foundation in the aroma, with a hint of hop spice. A smooth balanced flavor with just a touch of hop bittering on the back of the tongue. Great body, smooth, balanced and full.

4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is fine with a certain crispness from the hop bitterness. Drinkability is good due in part to the relatively low abv of 5.3%. Somewhat hard to find unless your beer store carries the full line of Deschutes standard beers. Well recommended.","Spikester","Sep 21, 2008"

Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery at first, but the hop bitterness that rides the back of the tongue makes up for it. All in all, this wasn't bad, but I'd be keen to reach for other Deschutes brews first (e.g. Obsidian Stout, Mirror Pond Pale, Inversion IPA, to name a few...).","wagenvolks","Jul 18, 2008"
4.33,11,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12oz bottle. Pours a beautiful copper colored amber with an extremely sticky off-white head that possesses excellent lacing and retention. The aroma is sweet biscuity malt with some caramel, hints of dark fruits and hops. The taste is incredibly smooth with some sweet biscuity malt, caramel and citrusy hops. An extremely well crafted beer that I would drink all the time if was available here in FL.

4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a rich amber hue with a nice one finger fluffy white head that slowly dies down to a thin layer. Lacing is pretty good for the style. Smell is pretty damn citrusy for this style, you can tell it's a west coast brewery. Under the initial hoppy burst follows a sweet caramel malt. Taste is amazing. Such a complete balance all around. The caramel malt is more present on the tongue than I had expected after giving this one a whiff. Starts off sweet, but not bitter. Towards the end a bit of a hoppy dryness emerges leaving a somewhat citrus like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of bubbles. Pretty creamy overall. At 5.2% abv. I could easily put these away one after another.","BeerTruth","Sep 06, 2007"

3.3,-15.4,4,4,3,3,3,"Not what I really expected in an ESB. The color of it when poured was an hazy golden amber with a reddish hue. The smell of hops, with a hint of spice and fruity was just sitting there. When poured, it had very little foam and while drinking, no lace what so ever. The taste was not as good as the aroma. Bitter hoppy flavor with not spice or fruit flavor that was evident. I really expect more out of the ESB. A little dissapointed, but, I guess that's how it goes!","BeerManDan","Aug 18, 2007"
3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Rich amber color with a good head of white suds. Mostly clear with a filtered polish. Smell was gently malty and fruity with a good measure of bright floral hops though not as much hop aroma as you'd expect form a pale or IPA. The bittering was nicely balanced and allowd this beer to hold onto a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel was pretty normal, not really too chewy. I drank three bottles and enjoyed all of them from start to finish, so I'd say the drinkability is ideal.","IceEyes","Aug 07, 2007"
4.25,9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Rich, amber copper body with glowing edges and a soft, fluffy cushion of light khaki head. Great lacing. Nose is ripe with chewy butterscotch and caramel. Fresh, strong hop aroma of pine and tea leaves cuts through. This ESB has some definite PNW influence and it works well. Taste starts with toasted malts and rounded hop bitterness. Light pine and citrus. Toffee and fruity malts in the middle. Nice. Finish shows a hint of spice before juicy hop bitterness takes over. Medium-bodied with a gently carbonated feel. Would love to have this on cask. A very nice ESB.","alexgash","Jul 11, 2007"
4.08,4.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The finish is very dry and the mouthfeel, for me, is spot on for the style. This is a very good ESB and I'm glad that it's back in town after being absent for many years.

4.15,6.4,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a slightly cloudy amber hue with golden highlights, topped by a good inch of creamy off-white head. Nice aroma of floral noble hops and mellow, slightly sweet malt. Palate is well-balanced between assertively bitter noble hops, mildly sweet malt, and a lightly fruity undertone. A lingering bitterness follows the finish. Body is smooth and creamy, very nice for an ESB. A very drinkable ale, and one that is overlooked in the Deschutes lineup.","ElGordo","Apr 18, 2007"

Aroma with a splash of hop bitterness, nothing overly lively or present. Pleasant, but slightly timid. More assertiveness on the mouthfeel, an interrupting bitterness upfront. Might interrupt the flavour except there isn't much. Very aggressive bitterness that abrupts the drinkablility - no need for such hops. The malt is nice, I wish it was showcased a little more. I think for this style my first choice would be the British brewer. I think this could be more if tried to be less.","biegaman","Oct 17, 2006"

The nose was a doughy malt character with some citrus as well. The taste was super balanced: caramel and floral hops. The beer just bettered as it warmed, and I'll admit to finishing one from this six pack earlier in the week at room temperature.

It has a floral hop flavor that adds quite a bit of bitterness, but nothing over the top. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a fine ESB.

4.38,12.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mmmm, a fine ESB from one of the nation's finest breweries. It pours a rich glowing amber with large fluffy head and tons of beautiful lacing. Sweet aroma of caramel malts and a light hop twinge. The beer is hugely flavorful, with lots of strong tasty malts, and a crisp hoppiness that is just about perfectly balanced. Both elements are forceful, but that is the Northwest way. The malts put forth bready flavors that are reminiscent of English ales, but a bit more in your face. Hops linger on the tongue for a great aftertaste. Mouthfeel perfectly soft and smooth. The beer is nourishing and very drinkable.

4.15,6.4,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours dark amber with some orange tint. Thick, fine white head boils down to a little cap. Got a bit of citrus and pepper from hops, and pleasing sweet, worty, malt scent. Hop flavor first on tongue, a hint of bitterness, strong malt counters into the middle and through aftertaste. Malt is nicely roasted nuttiness and some fruity sweetness as well. Balance is superb, aftertaste is smooth and a bit creamy. Some moderate lacing. Very good and incredibly easy to drink - but rather unexciting, making it a bit boring for my tastes.","BrewMan82","May 25, 2004"
4.02,3.1,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a hazed copper and burnt orange with a very nice frothy cream-colored head with a mix of small dense areas and large massive bubbles making it obvious this one has body. The smell consists of nice caramel, floral and citrus hops, biscuity malt, and a dry bitterness. The taste consists of a hop bite with smooth toasty malts and caramel with some citrus notes tapering into a thin but dry finish. This is a medium bodied beer and it finshes slightly dry. This is a nice brew, however, this one did not make me crave another. Maybe too satisfying or it becomes less complex as I work my way through. Still good! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Apr 16, 2004"

4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A hazy, deep amber/reddish copper body is topped by a long-standing, frothy ivory head. It holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace at the offset. The nose is fresh and inviting with floral/grassy Goldings and a mild yeasty fruitiness over a lightly sweet and biscuity malt. The body is medium/full and it's quite creamy in the mouth, no doubt due in part to it's very fine and moderate carbonation. The flavor is as the aroma suggests it may be, with a dryish biscuity malt that's laced with fruitiness (soft berries, some cherry) and infused with floral/grassy hop flavors. A firm bitterness backs it, and ushers in a dry finish that lingers shortly with a dollop of gently caramelish malt. Quite nice, and surprisingly authentic ""English"" in character. A flavorful beer that doesn't step over the edge, and thus retains a great deal of drinkability. Sometimes a little restraint goes a long way!","NeroFiddled","Apr 21, 2003"

Start has malt sweetness with the top slender in its feel, perkily acidic, the hops forthright in their spicy bite, aftertaste dry and lingering. Bitters as a style, I think overlooked and underrated, I for one like the style and wish more were brewed and easily available.","Gusler","Feb 11, 2003"
