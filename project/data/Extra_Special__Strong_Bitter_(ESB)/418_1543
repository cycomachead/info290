3.78,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 8/26/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pine, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes or orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, floral, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good ESB style. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

Magnificent heavy medium body that is creamy and better than many stouts. Above average carbonation with a nice effervescent finish. Well balanced and somewhat complex flavor profile. It begins with an orange and spice note which then flows into a moderate bitterness. Towards the end, the sweet caramel malt shines. It finishes with an effervescent burst that is slightly citric and tart, leaving you with a nice lingering low level bitterness over a mineral note. Not as bitter as I expected, it is; however, quite outstanding.","tillmac62","Jul 03, 2014"

APPEARANCE: nice brownish amber body with slow, subtle effervescence; white tow-finger, pillowy head is uneven; a good cloudy haze... AROMA: caramel malts and some more subtle West Coast hops generate a soft, slightly nondescript experience... PALATE: good, substantial mouthfeel with a balanced attack--teeth are active while the throat feels smoothly engaged--a pleasure to hold... TASTE: malty--mostly caramel--and some lagerish notes; likewise, hops are agreeable and aromatic; this beer has sessionable written all over it--and literally, written on the label ... OVERALLL: an overly agreeable pale ale that is balanced enough to make friends of democrats and republicans, Yanks/Sox fans, and ale/lager drinkers....","dacrza1","Jun 06, 2014"

Some herbal hop component comes in as well but is very restrained. The taste is somewhat muted. Bready malts, light herbal hops, some rich caramel notes all present. The balance is nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Not really sure if the nitro treatment improves this beer.

3.83,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Pours deep copper amber with a good head of fine foam that fell lazily to some sticky lace. Perfect clarity and some bubbles on their way up from the bottom of the glass. Nose is gentle. Good bit of yeast to kick start it then lots of bready malt. Doughy, biscuit, and toasted. Mellow floral hops, grass, some fruits, a little dank. Taste is excellent. Traditional. Malty with plenty of biscuit. Thin and a little watery at first then smooth and not chewy. Perfectly balanced. The chocolate in this beer is an airy dusting of cocoa powder that is light, easy and so well done. Hops are nice and floral, a touch fruity & grassy - but the malt stays up throughout the drink and the feel of it is flowing. It has some mineral qualities and a very nice malt sweetness takes it into the finish with some oil and hop bitterness for an unmarred aftertaste. Pleasant, drinkable and a great example of the style. Positively dapper.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

3.91,5.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Left Hand's Sawtooth initially pours fairly turbid, but it clears nicely to a translucenr copper. The head starts off as two fingers of tightly packed white foam. I'm typing this more than halfway through the glass and the head still hasn't dissipated, and it's doing a fairly good job of coating the glass with lacing. The nose is very, very mild, with aromas of toast and tea barely escaping out of the glass. The toasted bread and biscuit maltiness pops a little bit more on my palate. It's followed by a gentle suggestion bitterness, and closed out with an herbal English tea hop presence. The body is a little bit sturdy, and paired with a subtle carbonation that prickles your tongue just a little bit. Left Hand's Sawtooth is a good re-creation of a classic English style by an American brewery.","axeman9182","Nov 20, 2012"

The hops don't come across well and the bitterness seems lacklustre. I reckon the wheat is adding something unusual that doesn't belong with the style. Odd spicy hints in the background - similar to coriander. It seems well made but it just doesn't work; not a great ESB. I would expect an English example to be cleaner and boozier.

A bit hazy/cloudy, but nearing clear. Smells malty and fruity, with little hoppiness at all about, what you'd expect for an extra special bitter. Sweetness is low, and so is the bitterness which is present, and actually pronounced, but not nearly shouting. Carbonation is also in line with the style: low but fussy.

I wasn't expecting much from it being on nitro, but so far so good. Healthy, thick, 2 inch foamy, dense, white head. Good looking brew. It seriously looks like you could carve the head with an ice cream scoop. Subtle, creamy aromas of nutty and toffee sweetness, with a touch of hops. Flavors are smooth and rich, with a toasted toffee backbone and some peppery spicing, with a subtle hop presence that cleans the palate nicely. Smooth, sweet, and subtle richness overall. The aftertaste is light and smooth, with a nutty richness. The finish is smooth and clean, leaving the palate almost completely clean. Tasty on nitro.","GarthDanielson","Mar 22, 2012"

The head has awesome retention, and it leaves a bit sheet of thick lace behind. The nose was pretty faint overall. there were some toasted malt and toffee aromas. Also, there is a little bit of hop presence. The taste starts off with some toasted malt, toffee, and a bit of caramel. Those flavors are there, but they seem a bit watered down and there is a weird metallic flavor that I'm getting every now and then. There is also a mild hop flavor here. The finish leaves some lingering toasted malt and caramel sweetness. This has a medium body and smooth creamy carbonation. It goes down easy and has a really smooth feel to it. There is some toasted malt bitterness, and some dryness on the back end. This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is nice. overall, I think it is an alright beer. I would drink it again, but I don't know if I would pay for it. It's worth trying though. I'd like to try it regular instead of on nitro.","JizackFH","Nov 22, 2011"

3.83,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a brilliant copper color with orange tints, a slight chill haze, and an overflowing mound of white froth from the nitro tap. The head stayed creamy and left a bit of soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet malts, toffee, and mild subdued hops. Someone else described it as smelled like wort, and as a homebrewer, I must say that's pretty apt, though it wasn't quite as aromatically full or concentrated as a steamy pot of fresh brew, obviously. Sweet taste, toffee and caramel malts, hints of vanilla, toasted bread, gently hopped for a mild bitterness, that perhaps just puts this on the cusp of being an ESB. Nice and flavorful, which is good, though maybe not always expected for this style. (But then I find most English beers and English-style beers drab and watery, so...) Medium-bodied and easily drinkable, though not quite interesting enough for me to have repeated sessions. In one night anyway.","Rifugium","Nov 13, 2011"

Color was shoe leather brown, with a marshmallow colored head. Almost looked like a whipped coffee drink. Smell was brown sugar and molasses. Really enjoyed the flavor. Great tastes of malt balanced with a subtle bit of hops. The nitro aspect really made this beer shine, as an ESB is not a style I see often on nitro. I thought an ESB as easy to drink before, but nitro made it practically gulpable. The abv was non existent, and I could have had a few of these no problem.

OK, so they are making the style up. That's cool, and I would say that it is the best ""American"" ESB I have ever had as it is the only one I have had.

There is a hint of mild hops, but this balances very well with the malty flavor. Overall this ESB feels and tastes a lot better then it looks and smells.

Thus have I been moved by the spirit to report that these past two weeks have been utmost pleasurable. This ale looks and smells like an English pale ale (in the American microbrew style, not truly English pale), amber/rusty color and hop perky scent following a whiff of unsweet malt/caramel scent. Pours into glass leaving a nice but short lived 1 1/2 head. The taste will please pale ale, amber ale, and even IPA lovers because the Sawtooth seems to straddle all three of these, making it an easy drinking but lively and interesting bev. On the one hand, you taste hops from start to finish, but the hoppiness of an IPA remains just beyond your grasp. On the other, the tease of amber maltiness (again, more in mouth feel and scent than sweetness or flavor) never quite congeals. Once down the gullet, bitter and herby remainders on the tongue.It's Left Hand's genius that such an interesting bev can be undemanding and low maintenance at the same time.","marcellaproust","Apr 16, 2009"

There is also a nice medium to low carbonation that fits this brew nicely. Overall I'd say the feel was the best quality of this beer. It definitely gave it a nice drinkable despite its mellow taste.

Not much for a biscuity or bready flavor, either. Notes of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is just a touch bitter to me. I mean, it's not drying or IPA like but it doesn't seem like an ESB. Still, I'm a hop head. This happens quite often with me. Somebody will overhop a particular style and while it doesn't necessarily match, I'll give it praise in the drinkability department. Sure, it didn't seem completely like an ESB should. The point is I could drink this pretty easy and would probably have another.

There is also a nice nutty aroma as well as a touch of metal on the finish that is not unusual for the style. The taste is also quite nutty and their is a somewhite bacony flavor mixed in there as well. Medium bitterness, also maybe a touch high for the style and dryer than the nose suggested. Pretty decent. Mouthfeel is squeeky clean and a litttle light. There is a residual roastiness that cobines with some of the nutty flavors to leave a pleasant aftertaste that makes this nicely drinkable.

There is some hop on the back end, but you need to really search for it. This beer is medium bodied and very average. Quite frankly, I was disappointed, thinking this was so much more. In part this is due to the ubiquitous availability of Left Hand, which seems to be on the shelves everywhere. As the beer warms, I'm getting a goodly dose of caramel and leather.

Sweet biscuity malt flavours to start with some light pine and fruitiness. It finishes quite dry, but with only a light hoppiness. Thin to medium mouthfeel. Its not a bad beer, but I just can't get rid of that tea-like flavour that I seem to get from it. Maybe I'll give it a try again if the opportunity presents itself.","Xadoor","Jul 12, 2006"

Aroma was malt on top, with some citrus style of hops coming through as well. As I inhaled, I also picked up a vinegar smell - made me wonder about the beer. I pushed on to tasting, where the hops outweighed the malt quite a bit. Sweetness only came through towards the end for me, primarily in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was fairly drying, and the carbonation seemed rather high. Body was light and it was fairly refreshing. Overall, an OK beer, but I wasn't that impressed, and the smell was rather off-putting. I will probably try again in case this one was damaged in some way.","","Jul 12, 2006"

It pours a solid chestnut hue with a finger of khaki head that doesn't leave much lacing, but retains a 1/4"" cap of bubbles throughout. The aroma is of citric/piney/floral hops, sweet/buttery malts, dark fruits?, and roasted/chocolate malts. The taste is about the same with the addition of tropical (grapefruit, orange, faint mango) hops that contribute a mild to medium bitterness on top of a medium body that is crisp and refreshing. Overall it is a more-than-adequate ESB that is quite balanced in both scent and flavor. Definitely worth the price and I'm sure it would make a great session brew.","mmmbeer","May 21, 2006"

Nose is all about toastyness from the malt and lightly earthy character from the British hop. The hop is very mild, with the toastyness playing a huge role in this brew. Very enticing beer. Flavor is nice and toasty, with a lighter sweet caramel that comes through on the finish. Bitterness is very mild on the finish, just breaking up the toasty and caramel malt enough. I like it. Feel is a very solid moderate with a light, but appropriate, carbonation. It breaks up the feel just enough to keep it from being too much. I think this is a very nice example of an ESB. Good use of British malt and hop. Moutfeel is very nice as well. I'd have this one again for sure.","kmpitz2","Mar 15, 2006"

Sweet flavor, caramel and dextrins, with lots of fruit sweetness and immediately apparent butterscotch. So much about this malty brew hangs on it's balnce; which I felt was executed well with a mild english hop aftertaste. The carbonation is low and the body medium like an ESB should be, but I must say the diacetyl is pushed to the limit.

Citrissy hops come into play towards the finish and add an assertive bitterness. Hop flavor seems to play a bigger role in this beer than the few English ESBs I've sampled.

Nuttiness reminds me of pecans, nice on top of caramel and toffee flavors. No flavor is dominating. The beer is smooth in its flavors, the carbonation may be a distraction.

A decent pale malty palate, and more buttery creamy notes, leads to a decent bitter bite at the end, nice and dry, which is pretty good actually. Just not a ton of flavor up front.

All I can pick up in the nose is the sweet caramel malt. The taste was similar with caramel malt dominating and a slightly fruity sweetness joining it. Even though the finish is slightly bitter the sweetness is still a little excessive. This is about a medium body brew with good carbonation. I easily finished this and could have had another if not for the eventually overbearing sweetness. Overall a decent ESB but there are better choices available.","meathookjones","Aug 26, 2004"

There was a slight hop presence in the finish, but it seemed to lack character. I found this to be thin, however the carbonation was right. I didn't think it seemed very drinakble.

Smell is very smooth and rich, lets you know you're in for a Bitter. Tiny little hops kick up mid-taste, but subside to the sweet malted grains. I've always found it funny that bitters aren't really very bitter at all. This one is smooth and slippery like maple syrup. It's good and has a nice thick mouth on it.

The taste had a caramelized malt, biscuit bread flavor, with a fairly good dose of floral and citric hop.

I'm beginning to think I got a skunky bottle that got lightstruck sitting on the shelf as a single. English ESBs are my favorite style but I can't even finish this glass.

I really, really liked it because it was definitely NOT syrupy or overbearing. It just kind of hung in the air. The mouthfeel was crisp but not as bitter and dry as most of the other ESB's I have been drinking. This was pretty drinkable and that fruit overtone did not get in the way.
