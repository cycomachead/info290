4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"It smelled of caramel and a slight hoppiness. The taste reminded me of a Scotch ale which has that unique taste to it. It had a nice bitterness on the finish which rounded it out nicely to me. Overall a good ESB and I would recommend it.","cswhitehorse","Feb 08, 2009"
3.56,-7.8,2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Conclusion: Not bad, not great. It's pretty on target for a Special Bitter, but it's a little TART and aggressively bitter (without much hop flavor for my taste).

4.1,6.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A mix bag here - there is some tartness and fruit notes from the hops, yet this fuller-bodied beer goes down smooth and creamy, and has some sweet malt taste to it. Finishes with a dry backbite. A great beer that I'm glad I got to try.","clayrock81","Oct 08, 2008"
4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice slightly clear ruby red/deep orange amber color with a nice frothy white head that leaves good lace. Nose is mostly malty. Taste has a good malt profile with some decent british hop presence. Almost some toffee or caramel hints in here. Mouthfeel is nice, but a bit thick. Nice dry finish. Drinkability is good but not the best. Overall a good english bitter and a fair representation of the style. Im not that crazy about it, but it is a good representation. I think this bottle may be a bit old. A good brew, but there are enough better bitters available that I probably wont be purchasing this one again, except maybe at a bar.","AKBelgianBeast","Aug 21, 2008"

Smell is quite buttery with a nice toffee undertone. I also detect some pepper/spice in the nose as well. Taste is a nice nutty malt with a unique pear/mango flavoring as well. There seems to be a tiny bit of hop that tries to surface, but the malt pushes it back down. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation, could use a few m ore bubbles. Drinkability is scary good, could easily drink this as a session beer...hmmmm, note to self...","BeerTruth","May 16, 2007"
3.95,2.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"16.9oz brown bottle from Florian's. Hazy red/orange body with a quarter inch of off-white head that leaves some good lacing. Caramel malt and diacetyl characterize the aroma. Tastes like grassy hops and caramel malt with a hint of diacetyl to make a butterscotch-like flavor. Medium bodied, somewhat aqueous. Not a lot of carbonation in this one. Other than being slightly astringent, it's fairly drinkable and a pretty solid English ale.","MrHurmateeowish","Apr 26, 2007"

4.4,14,4,4,4.5,4,5,"I reviewed this one the day after reviewing the Broadside Strong Ale, and while it's similar in some regards (from it's coloration to its generous tan head and lacing) it differs in many others. The nose is different for one, exhibiting a pronounced hop bitterness and restrained malt profile. The mouthfeel? WOW! Seriously, this is one ofthe most complex and generous tipples I've had for a while in this regard, so soft and easy-drinking you'd swear it was nitro-pushed, it's also one of the creamiest beers I've ever put my lips to! More biscuity malt in the profile as it warms, making for a sweet/sour and tangy (but not really so sweet) ale, light in body, much more of a snack than a meal, and plenty refreshing all the way to its dry, bitterness-lingering finish. Bitter is in the name and this ale is true to style, and as with the Brakspear's I reviewed a few days ago, I really wish there were more well-made Bitters produced domestically on the micro front, because it's a wonderful style when executed properly, and by `properly' I mean everything from nose and mouthfeel to bitter hop/restrained malt balance AND low alcohol . . . from my experience a good bitter doesn't usually top 5%, and some of the better ones I've downed barely hit 4%. Now this sort of admiration of a `low-alcohol' brew might sound strange coming from a guy who likes his big beers once in a while, but the term "Session Beer" originated with the British practice of quaffing just such low-alcohol pints of ale for long afternoons in a pub, a practice almost unthinkable to young American drinkers weaned on Keg Stands, 40s, and Natty Ice. America -as we all know by now- tends to be the land of More and Faster, and this holds true to our partying tactics, as we typically try to liven things up by consuming more alcohol, faster, than other cultures. But don't worry, the British bitters I'm raving about here are imports and on the expensive side, their low-alcohol kin will never appeal to Joe Sixpack, nor will they supplant the American Premium and "Popular" brands out there complete with their high-gravity brewing methods, adjuncts, and 6% ABV to get you fooked up in the back seat of yer Chevy.","Chaz","Jan 12, 2007"
4.1,6.2,4,4,4.5,3,4,"Deep copper coloured, very slightly cloudy, with a large fluffy head that retains well throughout and produces some lacing. The aroma does not seem particularly strong at first but later livens up with caramel malt, herbal hops and some fruit aromas. The taste is superb, good malt and hops flavours, well balanced, with a very pleasing long bitterness on swallowing. Moderately carbonation a bit too strong for my taste - better on tap. A very enjoyable ale us East Anglians should be very proud of. I can't wait to go home and go to Southwold.","norwichboy","Nov 28, 2006"

The taste was a good blend of malts and english hops with some fruity and toasted flavors. The finish was dry and slightly bitter.

4.22,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a wonderful amber-rust color with a thick, firm white head. The liquid is slightly hazy, and the lace is fantastic. Toasted malts and caramel are the center of the aroma. Theyre met with a slight and fitting butterscotch smell and a little hops. The aroma is solidly malty, however, and very enticing. The taste is moderately sweet, with a buiscuit and toffee character. Theres a slight bitterness that doesnt come into its own until the finish, giving the beer a nice balance. On the whole, the beer is slanted toward the sweet side of things. Full body, with relatively low carbonation. This brew is essentially right on target. Its got a lot of character, and is delicious.","Suds","Aug 15, 2006"
4.38,13.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouth: Enters with a prickly mouthfeel that mellows out to a smooth finish in the back. It's a dry finish with a bitterness that takes over the whole mouth. Grassy flavors abound, bringing some feelings of a hay field in the summer. The roasty flavors of the malts add a taste of banana and good balance mid-mount through the finish. The swallow mixes earthy mint and chocolate flavors.","clickpush","Jul 26, 2006"

4.42,14.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"The taste is, well, bitter. Great hops and a lovely toasted maltiness. Caramel, while very muted, is certainly present if you're looking for it. The mouthfeel is very smooth indeed, with a fantastic level of carbonation. This is very easy to drink and finishes very gently without any sort of powerful (or otherwise offensive) flavour or carbonation "sting". I think this is a fabulous example of the style. I am glad I revisited it.","SilentSabre","Jun 26, 2006"
4.05,4.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a deep cloudy amber with a starkingly white head. It has a immediate hoppy and malty aroma when poured. Very drinkable and pleasurable. The definition of a special bitter. Decent hops, good malt, low carbonation. The carbonation is obviously more than if it was on cask. I could easily see myself having more than a few on England's east shore.","jvdineen","May 16, 2006"
4.08,5.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"When I have drunk other beers from Admans, I have often found an odd funny chemical hoppy taste that I didnt like at all. But in this one, the powerful malt balanced that flavour. A nice special bitter.","bark","Apr 23, 2006"

The mouthfeel was medium, bordering on creamy. I got a great nutty flavor, like almonds, in the mouth and the finish had a lemony tartness to it. A really wonderful beer.","woodychandler","Apr 16, 2006"

4.64,20.2,4,5,4.5,4,5,"This wonderful bitter pours rather dark, with a cherry wood color and an appealing head. The nose is a nice balance between sweet malts and floral, nectary hops.

3.85,-0.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew pours out a dark copper tone. The head's a beaut/ nice and frothy while slowly settling away and leaving a white lace on the glass. First smell is sweet malts with a hint of hops coming through in the background. This is am awesome bitter that has nice malt flavors that eventually dissipate to hoppy fun!

Taste is nice with an initial hop dryness/bitterness up front which transitions to a bit of butter. Finishes malty sweet. Im really digging the mouthfeel on this one, not really thin at all and actually a bit creamy. Drinkability is good as well. A nice light flavor with a full mouthfeel that goes down easy.

The aftertaste is what this style is all about, and Admans produces. I agree with the comment about Rogue, I "like" thier bitter but it doesnt compare to this. You smell nothing, but get a great overall taste of the right hops for ESB. This is a very well crafted brew, subtle in appearance, right in the categories that matter.

The taste is of biscuits, spicey herbal hops, and buttery diacytl. The diacytl is quite evident, though its not overpowering. The carbonation is very vigorous but leaves a subtle almost creamy mouthfeel. This beer is definitely better than Adnam's Broadside, perhaps because of the higher level of hops making a more balanced beer. A good english bitter.","CAMRAhardliner","Sep 18, 2004"

Pours a beautiful red-copper color like brewed tea....tight fluffy off white cap...medium carbonation. Lots to fill the olfactory senses here...complex...nutty yeasts over buttered-biscuit malts and lemon-peppered grassy hopping...wild complexity. The front of this ale carries itself well with a pronounced smooth buttery, buscuity malt tone with the hops showing up mid way to give good balance with a citusy twang that drys out the smooth finish...the bittering only comes in at the very end in the after taste. A wonerfully buttery smooth malt pronounced "bitter" that is not really "bitter" but drying in its finish. Its satisfying without being heavy...a very well crafted English ale.","pootz","Sep 16, 2004"

Not alot imparted to the beer from the hops except the biting bitterness. Lightly metallic in the finish. Crisp and dry. Lingering hoppiness in the aftertaste.

Pours out a dark copper/amber color with some nice carbonation visible that stays with you the entire time. Smell consists of roasted malts mostly with some nutty aromas and some spiciness as well which was interesting. Taste consists of malts upfront and stays with you into the aftertaste. But some caramel, nutty flavors, and some slight fruit notes also ride along the palate. This is pretty balanced. Aftertaste had some hop kick to it which seemed to belong in this brew. And at the very end some peppery flavors show up and last for a long time. This is a good example of ESB and do pick some up when you see this brew.","necoadam","Jul 24, 2004"

The aroma was very mild and unremarkable with mostly fruity smelling malt and little to no hops. The taste was also pretty sweet, with cherries and plums. There was also quite a bit of roasted nutty background to the taste. The mouthfeel was a bit creamy at the start of the sip, with a sticky feel mid palette, but the finish was quite watery and weak.

Aroma is slightly malty, backed with a minimal but sharp hops scent. Taste is initially of the grains, but the hops chime in and provide a crisp end to the experience. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very good. This brew is representative of what I would expect a standard bitter in the UK would be like, hunkered down at a dark pub in front of the fire, possibly watching some sports. Sessionability is superb.","ppoitras","Jun 20, 2004"

The nose delivers earthy, leafy, and grassy hops (Fuggles? and probably some Goldings) with a pinch of yeasty sulphur thrown in over a caramelish malt. It's firm bodied and creamy in the mouth with a very fine and natural (bottle-conditioned), moderate carbonation that gently caresses the tongue and rouses the tastebuds. Some yeasty fruitiness that wasn't noticed in the aroma makes an appearance in the flavor; followed by a mellow toffee-ish/caramel/biscuity malt that's backed by a solid bitterness and peppered with a leafy hop flavor. It finishes dry with some residual bitterness that leaves the palate refreshed and ready for food or more beer. Simple. Satisfying. Refreshing. An excellent session ale!","NeroFiddled","Dec 20, 2003"
