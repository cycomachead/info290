I don't quite get the floral notes in aroma and flavor thAt are advertised on the label. The flavor is delightfully bitter, grapefruit with pine and malt.

Nice bitter and citric taste. Flavor of grapefruit, sweet malt with hints of peppery yeast, earthy hops and burnt italian bread crust. Dry with a long last bitter aftertaste. Light body with perfect carbonation. 6.8% ABV is completely hidden. This Belk's ESB version gave me the impression to be better than the previously named Boont ESB, probably due to the fact this is much fresher. Anyway, not sure I was lucky, but I tasted an excellent beer, flavorful, balanced, quite assertive and pleasant to drink. An American interpretation of an English ESB, and in my opinion, very well done.","FLima","Jul 17, 2013"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear golden-amber topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises mild orange zest, buttery caramel, and soft grass (think the lush hills of rolling verdance in the general Northumberland area...yeah...). The taste brings in more of the same, though the grass now clearly overshadows the even-milder-than-before citrus character. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a solid ESB, one of the better ones coming from the States.","TMoney2591","May 30, 2013"

The taste had some bitter and grassy hops followed up with some biscuit and malty sweetness. The nose wasn’t my favorite of the style, but the taste was pretty good.

The nose features honey, bread, cocoa dust, malts with some peat moss, dried lemons, coal tar, matted meadow grasses, some peach to apricot fruit, it’s not really that funky but by the same token the word “clean” does not leap into your mind either. Full-bodied, creamy attack which segues into a bitter finish with a light metal to iodine ring to it. All the apricot, peach, yellow apple, pear fruit as well as white grapefruit to lemon citrus feels pressed, ripe but all the juice forced out. Honey, maple syrup and cocoa fill in some blank spots, buttered biscuit more burnt than undercooked. The carbonation is perhaps too fluffed up to keep the whole clear and linear. It’s interesting at times but not the sort of brew you really want to invest a lot of time or gullet space to.","farrago","Feb 17, 2012"

Medium-bodied w/ plenty of hops and malt but finishes clean and goes down smooth. Has a citric hop taste that is balanced with bread and caramel malt, for a really dry beer, yet like stated above it just passes over smooth w/o ruining the tastebuds.

This bitterness loses some of its flavour but becomes more sharp and lasts through the fairly quick finish of cracker and bread to leave a lingering, overly bitter, almost acrid, aftertaste. The worst part is this overly bitter, sharp, grapefruit-pulp end. It also lacks balance in that it is simply sweet up front and bitter in the end, without the two meshing. This is too bad becomes it has some nice flavours and zestiness up front, has a promising start, and has enough bitterness and sweetness to be interesting.

The beer has some floral notes in the aroma, a definite sweetness comes through as well. The taste is fairly well balanced, a little on the musty side, the acerbic hop and the biscuity malt do blend quite well. The beer could benefit by being more crisp, and it does have a taste as though it may have been sitting around a bit too long. There is a slight spiciness to the beer, perhaps it is a peppery flavor that comes through in the finish.

The smell that comes to mind right away is green tea, but there is also toasted notes and a slight unidentifiable hop presence. The taste also reminds me to a lesser degree of green tea, there is also a definite hop bitterness - slightly grassy and floral - that balances pretty nicely with the toasted malty backbone.

Malt seems to overpower the flavor of this ESB with a fair hop bite to the aftertaste that remains well after swallow. Carbonation is quite mild throughout tasting. To me, this is a very drinkable ESB at 6.8%. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming. Very smooth, enjoyable beer.

On the palate, quite grainy first off, with hop bitterness at the mid-palate and slight ale sourness at the finish. Full, dextrine mouthfeel. This is a bit out of character from Anderson Valley's other offerings, as the ESB is perfectly solid but lacks depth, which I see as one of the house characteristics of theirs. Not a bad beer at all. In some ways, it's quite decent. But I see no reason to pick this beer over some of the other AV staples.","geexploitation","Oct 02, 2006"

It lacks the rich caramel maltiness that the pale, amber, and IPA have; it's more bitter; the alcohol shows at just 6.8%; and it's drier than most. There's a harshness to it that I can't quite put my finger on. It's heavy handed with bitterness, but lacks hop flavor and aroma; and it's not nearly as balanced as their other beers.

This one sticks to your palate after the finish, and actually gets better as it warms. Don't know if I'd drink more then 2 or 3 in a sitting, but I guess I shouldn't rule it out either.

Hops are earthy, with a light kiss of citrus playing over a very strong toasty and biscuit malt with just a touch of caramel behind it. Feel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation.

Nutty flavor malt blends well with the floral and also citrussy hops. Also has that classic English ESB buttery toffee taste to it, which creates and interesting balance. The one thing I think is the most strange is that the %6.8 percent alcohol, not particularly high, seemed very noticable to me. I usually like that in a beer but it seemed a bit odd here. And believe me, I really like beers where you can taste a kick of alcohol. This really is a pretty big honkin ESB in my opinion. Definately unique and pushes the envelope of this traditional style.

4.68,23.8,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"I am an admitted ESB lover. this is a striking attempt by an american brew at an english favorite (fullers, adnams anyone?). The difference here is the hops and carbonation signature. Where a lot of ESBs may seem ""flat"" to a lot of people this one certainly is not. It has the classic ESB flavour but more bite on nose and pallate, more american I suppose. Excellent lace of head on the glass, smells like it tastes and yet after leaving it out for awhile smells like a clasic brit ESB. Beautiful color, amber/brown mixed hue, though very clear. This is an american take on an english standard. The english types tend to lack the bite this does.. so imagine your sierra nevada pale crashed a fullers party.. and you have this brew. If you leave it out to breathe (for 15 min at least) it settles more into a traditional ESB all around but still has a better hop signature than most ESBs. Hop lovers will love this out of the 12 oz typical bottle as is and immediate, ESB lovers/traditionalists should let it sit for a while in a snifter before imbibing to enjoy it fully. Recommended.

In a pint glass, the beer was an attractive hazy orange-metallic copper hue, and was topped by an ample off-white head. The nose was vibrant and bright, presenting a nice array of resiny and tingly citric hop notes and an underlying warm maltiness. The taste was suprisingly robust, with a lightly tart toffee-ish malt body that opened up with citric hoppy bitterness, which increased significantly in intenisity as the maltiness decreased, ending up with a big and aromatic bitter finish that left lingering resinaceous hop notes. I felt a warming sensation in the tummy as a drank, which suprised me coming from an ESB. The body was very full and rich as well.

Taste has a few complexities. Toffee and lots of bittering hops up front. Sweet caramel malts fight a losing battle with the big hop profile. Some buttery and nutty flavors seem to be present, but are, unfortunately, subdued by the massive hops. Finishes dry and very bitter.

I guess AV already has their IPA (and what a huge one it is) and this so-called ""bitter"" is just a step down from it. Doesn't qualify as a bitter, though, even though it is very bitter. A true English bitter is more balanced, with the malt playing perhaps the dominant role. Here, it takes a back seat to sharp spiky hops that are grassily pungent. Small sips as the beer mellows and warms give evidence to a nicely diverse malt profile, but you have to dig down deep to get past the blatant hops.

3.46,-8.5,2,3.5,4,4,2.5,"Well, the main reason I gave this beer a low mark on drinkabilty has to relate to the appearance. On the pour, there was an excessive amount of head. WAYYYY too much head. A very thick head, much like visiting inlaws, over stayed it's visit. When you have a good inch or two of thick head in your glass, it makes it near imposible to drink without having to clean your face off. Aside from that, it wasn't that bad. The 10-15 minutes it took when the head finally evapoarated (I'm not kidding) I was impressed with the great hop flavor and it's somewhat cloudy amber color. But the wait was just too unsatisfactory. If you want the 'got beer?' mustache, this is your brew, but other then that....I wouldn't waste much time to search this one out.","sinistersteve","Sep 13, 2002"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a slightly couldy golden color with very small bits of sediment present.  It formed a huge, nice white head that left some nice lace.  An aroma of malt, hop and caramel.  The flavor was of malt and caramel with a slight hint of hops.  A medium body finish that had elements of the caramel.  A good beer, it a tad sweet for my ESB tastes.","Wildman","Jul 27, 2002"
4.31,14,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Fresh as a daisy.  Handsome orange, amber, copper hues with a sturdy frothy white head.  Citrus peels, sappy hops, and a whisper of caramel sweetness in the background.  Another fabulously crafted beer from Anderson Valley Brewing.","Jordan","Jul 23, 2002"
3.97,5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Cloudy, dark amber/orange color.  Big, white, lasting head.  Aroma is mildly floral and fruity.  This beer is full-force bitter; more than expected.  A very, very good, drinkable ESB.","Suds","Jun 22, 2002"
3.85,1.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Slightly hazy orange brew topped by a billowy, dense and attractive head.  Big, earthy hop nose is followed by sweet caramel malt and fruity, licorice - like notes.  Hop bitterness is very assertive for style but quite enjoyable.  Hop flavor is surprisingly mellow, but can b discerned amongst the biscuit & crystal malt flavors.  Moderate to full in body for style, but just a touch overcarbonated.  Finishes w/ Willamette hop earthiness & hop bitterness of course.  This the the most bitter ESB I've had, perhaps even a bit rough, but is one very flavorful brew.  A nice American bastardization of the style.","marc77","May 22, 2002"
3.01,-20.4,4,3,3,2.5,3,"Belk’s ESB:  Very nice looking amber beer with an off-white head.  Very little aroma.  Surprisingly mild taste, not as much hops bite as I’d expected at all.  Some alcohol warmth, but this was not a lively or flavorful beer by my book.","jackndan","May 11, 2002"

4.07,7.7,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Yet another good offering from Anderson Valley.  Pours a nice orangey gold color with a small head that dissipated quickly.  Smells of hop bitterness and slight malt aroma.  Taste starts off as quite bitter but works its way to a nice balance with the malt as it warms.  Clean, smooth and crisp mouthfeel and highly drinkable.  Man, this is a real nice beer.  Great for some session drinking.","Murph","Mar 18, 2002"
1.83,-51.6,2.5,2,1.5,2,2,"No question this is an ESB, strong, hoppy after taste.  Very little aroma its all in the taste.  Alcohol not noticable even though it's on the high side.  Low carbonation.  If you like a bitter this one is for you but it is not my style.","jdhilt","Mar 15, 2002"
3.91,3.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Big beefy American Style ESB these guys have dished out. Close to a strong ale in my opinion, alcohol is very noticeable. Certainly one of the biggest ESBs I have ever had the pleasure to try.","Jason","Mar 11, 2002"
3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Slightly hazy, amber/brown.  Big bubble, thin head that lasts.  Robust impact taster, hop bitterness, quite alcoholic.  Lots of flavor front to back but a little on the ""too bitter"" side and needing some balance to me. Real sticker of a mouthfeel, a little overdone, almost as if Anderson Valley is showing off too much.","ADR","Mar 11, 2002"
4.38,15.9,5,4.5,4,4,5,"A assertive highly hopped ale. Not anything like English ale, but then what is. This is one of my favorite domestic breweries and this ale one of my  favorites.  I don't sound as enthused as I should because I don't think our micro brewers put out a real smooth ale on par with the British.  does anyone else feel this way?","Mark","Feb 11, 2002"
