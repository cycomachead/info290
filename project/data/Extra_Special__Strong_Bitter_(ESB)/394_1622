There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like tart apples, herbal/floral hops and some caramel malt. It tastes like herbal/floral hops, toasted and bready malt, tart apples, and some nuts and tea. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation.

Aromas of caramel, orange, biscuit, nuttiness, toast, herbal, grass, and light earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, orange, herbal, floral, grapefruit, grass, and light earth. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, and citrus on the finish for a good bit. Very well balanced with nice amount of toasty flavors. No cloying flavors on the finish at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a damn nice ESB! Very flavorful and well balanced; very smooth and drinkable. No complaints at all, really enjoyed this.","superspak","Oct 10, 2012"

The taste of the beer is a little sweet with some caramel malts upfront that fade into a much more bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is crisp and sharp on the tongue.

3.48,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Have had this one plenty of times over the years but am finally getting to the review. Would like to add that I think the recipe has changed a little from recent memory. Poured a 12 oz bottle vigorously into a pint glass. Pours a clear amber color with nice white head and good carbonation. Head sticks around a good bit before finally fading. Smells of caramel malts with a bready/toasty aroma. Faint hop aroma is there, but you really have to look for it. Slight chocolate aroma too. Tastes a little more sweet than dry. Again, the caramel malts dominate for me. Not a hoppy beer, but is bitter. The hop presence isn't a dominating factor. A solid beer, but a little one dimensional. An average mouthfeel. In getting a variety case from Stoudts, this is now my least favorite. From what I remember, this one used to be a lot richer and tastier from a few years ago. Recipe could use a tweak or two.","jwhancher","Jun 23, 2010"

Alot of reviews that I have read here say this is not a true to style ESB. I haven't had enough ESBs to really have an opinion in this regard but, to me, it tastes similiar to alot of brown ales that I've had. Slighty sweet and malt forward with toasty and nutty notes. Maybe a little buttery too. Dark brown and gold in color. Nice head but no lacing and minimal retention. Pretty good mouthfeel. Not too slick, not too heavy.

Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is full of crystal malt. The hops linger in the background but do give herbal, earthy hints. The flavor does not suit me. A lot of crystal malt, low hop flavor, and mild bitterness. Somewhat sweet overall. A bit medicinal. Has a nice body for an ESB. Carbonation is lively without being harsh.

Slight more hoppiness than an amber ale. Hint of fruit on the palate. At only 5% abv and with a deceivingly good drinkability, it was a very nice beer to start the night off with.

I was smitten with the fact I could taste the hops and that beer didnt need that funny aftertaste (that I eventually found to be corn). Even so, the beer was very good and very clean. I am sorry to say that the last two cases I have had have some bottling issue. The Scarlet Lady is a little metallic from the bottle. I stopped by Stoudt's over the summer (about 4 months ago) and the beer from the tap did not have this taste. I fear Stoudt's is trying to bottle more beer than their line can handle. Alas, I shall re-0review the old girl. The bottle pours a nice red color with a white head, about one finger deep. The smell is light and floral but has a hint of a metallic edge in it. The taste is great up front, it hits with a floral hop taste and aroma that is pleasant and not overbearing. The malt begins to work its way through on the back of the tongue and it finishes clean. Unfortunately, just as you are enjoying the taste of he sip, alight metallic taste disrupts the experience. The mouthfeel is light and this beer is super drinkable! Even with the off aftertaste, Scarlet Lady is one of my favorite ESB's. I simply hope Stoudt's clears out their bottling lines soon. Cheers!","DevilDogBeer","Jan 16, 2008"

Similarly, the taste is both malty and heavy, but the mouthfeel, while not light, is crisp and balanced. The density of the malt is cut by the slightly hoppy flavor that is present. This beer skirts the line of a heavy malty beer and a lighter ale and is a nicely put together ESB. It is definitely full bodied and nicely nuanced. In my experience, it is probably on the heavier side of ESB's, but I really like it. A good beer from a very good brewer.","Abita45","Jan 13, 2008"

A very drinkable ESB...I'm a little torn on how to review it, though. If reviewing as an ESB, I wouldn't score it very high as the bitterness just isn't there. But if I never read the label, and assumed it was a red ale, I'd score it appropriately. So I decided to review it based purely on it's characteristics and not it's style (whew! hope that makes sense).

Stoudt's makes some great beers, but this one is unique in their lineup--at least among those commony found. Nice red/amber color with decent head of foam; hops in the nose, but the taste is at first malt--flavorful, carmel malt--and then the hops hits you. Like a mild chili sauce that keeps delivering a punch, the hops stays with you for awhile. But it's definitely not overpowering and very drinkable. Very good.","tugdriver7","Aug 23, 2006"

Aromas of caramel maltiness and spicy hops that are a touch with a bit of fruit fill the nose. A brief spicy hop flavor leads into an ample malt body before reverting back to a slightly fruity/spicy lemony hop bite. The finish is short and only moderately crisp with a light edge that is also a bit drying. Medium-light body with fine carbonation and a non-offensive mouthfeel.

Taste is a lot like honey, with an all-encompassing mouthfeel of sweetness. A touch of brown sugar as well. There is a strange other taste about 3/4 of the way through that makes it a bit sour, almost like there was something wrong with the yeast, or it was contaminated.

Aromas of burnt wood, hops, citrus, and roasted malts. Together, these scents seemed to suggest a cross between an IPA and Doppelbock. It seemed interesting at first, but quickly became somewhat repugnant and unappealing. The taste, however, is enjoyable and smooth with a refreshing citrus character that works very well with the roasted malt flavors; adding depth and wonderful texture to the beer. The aftertaste is bitter with a lingering sensation in my throat. Good drinkabilty due to the flavors and lower ABV, but the aromas given off by the beer can be a big distraction, it was for me.","jaluria","Jan 11, 2006"

Opps, I poured the sediment into the glass, so it's faily cloudy. Smells quite hoppy with woody and citrus notes (KGoldings?). Some fruity esters carry the hops and I think I get some vienna malt, too. Tastes mild malt sweet witha mild tang in the middle. After the swallow, a fantastic fruity malt rises up my throat and hangs on the back part of my tongue. Wow, that was a neat experience. It's got some rougher hop character. Citrus and grassy. Not grapefruit like american hops...woody citrus and sour piney. THe bitter is more than I like in an ESB, but I'm a ho-head. It adds an interesting dimesnion. Mouthfeel is creamy and light. Not macro-swill light. It's soft with mild carbonation lifint any viscosity so the beer doesn't coat the tongue. Very nice. With searching, I guess it's medium-bodied, but appears less because of the creamy and carbonation gives it the experience of lightness.","mentor","Mar 20, 2005"

More of an amber really, but I'll review it anyway. Reddish amber copper color with a decent head on it (actually it fizzed right out of the bottle). Smell is pretty light but there's some nice doughy malty notes and some prescence of herbal hops, and a bit dusty. The taste is very mellow. Much as it smells, but the hops are even more subdued. Nice warm wheaty and barlyish flavor with a soft malty palate but not at all normal for the ESB style. A little toffee maybe, reminiscent of the English style ESBs.

Taste is smooth and mild, more grainy than hoppy, but it has a nice crisp but short finish with a little bit of bitterness. Mouthfeel is very good, slightly oily maybe, medium body, soft carbonation, surprisingly good though.

The Scarlet Lady has a good consistency but is a little too bubbly, I like a woman who is a bit more reserved. This could be due to the bottle.

Taste was ok. Malts, toffee, and toasted flavors show up with some hops kicking in the middle and finishes on the dry side.

Excellent toffee malt sweetness, nutty walnut, superb mild hops bitterness. Perhaps a bit of ""watered down"" effect midway through, but this doesn't distract from the exceptional flavors going on here. I've not been impressed with many North American ESBs, but this one reminds of the topnotch Propeller ESB from Nova Scotia.

I'd guess more like a bitter than an ESB though.","Bighuge","Dec 12, 2003"
3.83,6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer has a bit of a reddish color to it, with a slight haze. There is a small head with a little bit of lacing down the glass. The aroma is mostly that of malts, with a little bit of hops to it. There is a good malty taste, with a bit of a bitter finish. A pretty decent ESB. No appreciable difference from the draught version.","Boto","Dec 12, 2003"
3.73,3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours medium amber with a medium white head that barely lasts, but laces very nicely. Aroma is floral, citric, piney, with some caramel and a sweet graininess. Flavor is sweet, lightly fruity, ending with a medium hop bitterness and some floral character. Medium body, slight sourness comes in near the end. It's much better on tap than it is in the 12oz bottle.","goz","Dec 07, 2003"
3.67,1.7,4,4.5,3,3.5,4,"Very nice color and head. The nose had a really nice sweet biscuity smell with a real nice malty base and floural hop hint. Taste seemed a bit subdued on the hop side for an ESB. Nice malty flavors but nothing jumped ouit at me. Hop flavors were very tame with some mild floural undertones. There were tiny particulates sitting in suspension in the entire beer, not sure what that was all about. Overall not very complex and I was hopping to have more of a hop element.","OatmattStout","Dec 05, 2003"

3.5,-3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5," A medium bodied brew with sufficient flavoring and great drinkability. The bitterness of the hops is well under control for those non-hopheads out there. The sweet flavors from the malts balances very well. There is certainly nothing amazing about this beer, but it is definitely a solid brew. It is above average in every aspect, and it is therefore a good one to drink.","ElGuapo","Nov 10, 2003"
4.14,14.7,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Sometimes I really don't know what to expect from ESBs. Just inconsitence in taste I suppose. Pours nicely, looks like yuengling lager (don't ask), oddly enough. It has a crisp clean taste, with more malts then hops present, IMO. It has a very clean and easy drinking flavor, very crisp through and through. It is not a bad beer to sit down with and relax. need to try some more","PSUDREW","Nov 09, 2003"

3.93,8.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Brown 12oz bottle, colorful with no born on dating. The color poured out a cloudy, deep amber with a reddish hue. The 1/8 inch head dissipated almost immediately (maybe a bad pour the first time, but after the 6th one still nothing noteworthy). The scent was of light hops with a very slight fruit accent. The taste was bitter with a nice bite but a very smooth finish. The mouthfeel was bright and crisp with a nice tingle. I really enjoyed this beer, my first real ESB (I think I had a Pete's ESB before I really started ""tasting"" beer). It was just bitter enough, very crisp and clean and nice and smooth at the tail end. I'm very interested in sampling some of the other Stoudt's creations soon --- this one is a keeper and I will continue to explore ESB's.","Gasp100","Oct 27, 2003"

3.68,1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Well...a little confusing. I think this beer may be mislabeled, but I still enjoyed it. Color was a nice light amber with a decent head. The smell was a bit odd. Oily perhaps, I couldn't pinpoint it. Taste was a bit on the light side with no hop burst or maltiness. Somewhat neutral (but not balanceddue to lack of hoppiness or maltiness) Mouthfeel was good...smooth. Drinkability was ok...no pronounced aftertaste...smooth. Once again, not a bad brew, but as others have said, not an ESB.","edchicma","Sep 10, 2003"

4.03,11.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep amber color with an impressive head. The aroma is distinctly of sweet chocolate malt. The initial glug settles a smooth medium body along the palate with a mellow malty character. The mild bitterness is very mellow and pairs nicely with the malt presence and a floral hop spice. The brew stays smooth right through a sweet flush toward the last few sips and a nice clean finish.","beernut7","Aug 31, 2003"
3.88,7.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This ale poured a clear, dark red-amber color with white foam that settled but clung to the glass. The smell was caramel malt. Odd for an ""ESB"". The taste was slightly sweet with caramel malt a dominant flavor, but balanced with a good shot of bitter hops and some floral hops. The mouthfeel was dry and a bit ""chalky"" from the hops, with otherwise smooth, with medium body and low carbonation feel. The aftertaste was dry and hoppy. This was a very good beer but more like a red/amber ale than an ESB.","UncleJimbo","Aug 30, 2003"

3.73,3.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a crystal clear golden red color that had some light orange tones to it when held to the light. The beer was well carbonated from opening to last pour. It produced a light beige/off white head that started off fairly thick then fell to a small layer and a ring on the inside of the glass that lasted o the last sip, and produced a somewhat watery lace in parts of the glass. The aromas were on the light side but were noticeable, I nosed sweet malt, flowers, hops, light fruit in parts, grains, and bread. The flavors were a little more pronounced then the aromas, tastes of hops, flowers, sweet malt, caramel, barley grain, light fruits and bread were all present and became more noticeable as it warmed. It left a light hop aftertaste in the first few sips, then it became more bread like as it warmed. It was light to medium bodied. A slightly bitter, slightly hoppy, slightly sweet and creamy beer, all these were evident from the opening of the cap to the last sip in the bottle. Was not the kind of beer to get if you were looking for tons of flavors, but not a bad representative of the style and a drinkable beer.","Jarod","Jun 24, 2003"
3.63,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Had a thin body but a true nut core to it, as a good ESB should. Due to the lack of carbonation, it tasted and felt like a true English ale, cask and all. But, it did feel like it was coming close to the end of its quick half-life. I applaud Stoudt's effort at an ESB, casking, and making something special for Monk's Cafe (PA).","nomad","Jun 18, 2003"
4.03,11.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Wow, first I must say that this beer on cask improves it so much. I have had in the bottle on tap, but on cask this is a different animal alltogether. Appears copper amber with an off white toffee toned head leaving full even wonderful rings of lace around my pint. Aroma is heavenly with buttered kent goldings the mixture of the malts they use with the English hops in this English style ale blend to form one full inviting aroma. The tste is mellow with hops and rich with mallt yet it remains hoppy just not to hoppy, very balanced session brew that I is a treat to all. Very creamy silky texture to it with the oily resins trickling lightly on the palate giving this medium bodied true to the style ESB one amazing mouthfeel. Wow I could have easily had at least three of these wonderful creations, great representation of an awesome style thanks Carol.","WVbeergeek","Jun 05, 2003"
4.22,16.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I was impressed with the APA, so I figured I'd give the Scarlet Lady a try, and I wasn't disappointed. The beer pours a dark amber color with a fair bit of head. The smell is a nice mix of wheat and flower and simply smells wonderful. Fortunately, the taste of the beer doesn't disappoint either. The original taste fades into a lovely bitter, wheat aftertaste. I could certainly have more than one of these if I wasn't testing, as it seems to overwhelm the pallette with flavor. I'd buy another of these any day!","beergeek279","May 10, 2003"

3.83,6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Quite a handsome brew. Dark amber to copper that is quite hazy or lightly cloudy, and capped by a very nice golden tan head. The head diminishes fairly slowly and leaves nice deposits of lace. The nose starts quite caramel malty from the robust head, but hops poke through as the head weakens. The flavor is nicely balanced between the malt sweetness and the hop bitterness. A pleasant, refreshing brew that starts well and ends well. Just a tad thin on the body, but still crisp enough. Good for a go or two.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 25, 2003"
3.75,3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a nice amber/copper in color with a fair amount of white head. Aroma of caramel, fruit, and lighlty toasted malt. Flavor was that of caramel malt with a nice bitterness, but not as strong as I would have liked. Mouthfeel was a little too watery for my liking but was not too far off. Very enjoyable and an interesting label to boot.","jreitman","Mar 14, 2003"

4.09,13.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The aroma is a perfect balance of malts and hops. I got a mild floral aroma upon sniffing this one, along with a fruity, raspberry aroma. The taste initially is nearly sweet, with a bit of a caramel malt flavor, as well as some mild fruit flavoring which is delicious. The hops dont seem to hit until after I swallow, then they seem to bite down nicely on the back of the tongue. A very nice balanced brew.","IrishRedRock","Jan 09, 2003"
3.48,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pretty amber color with a thin but creamy off-white head and minimal lace. Mildly bitter hops aroma. The flavor was not as bitter as some but does have a nicely sweet malt presence. An interesting ESB to say the least.","Dogbrick","Dec 11, 2002"

Not as strong aromas as some ales, but it's a very nice perfume the lady wears.   She plays somewhat hard-to get with the flavor.  I can taste some nice hops, and then a bit of malt jumps in.   Some mouthfuls are sweeter than others, but I would not call this a sweet beer.  She has a wonderful bitter finish, and a nice crisp mouthfeel.  Stoudt's produces yet another good beer.  Definitely a nice lady to spend an evening with.","aaronh","Oct 07, 2002"

A lively free form off white head, which settles down. Fine carbonation. A very strong, fruity nose highlighted by apples and pears. Taste is mostly malt, with some butter, and just enough hops to give it balance. Wonderful full, rich body. Very British. Could easily do another bomber of this in a sitting. Extra Special Indeed. She is quite a lady.","RonfromJersey","Aug 02, 2002"
3.24,-10.2,4.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark copper with a thick, creamy tan head that leaves a nice lace all the way down the glass.  Smell is of sweet caramel malts and some buttery diacetyl with absolutely no hops.  The brew start off sweet and creamy and then goes into a buttery flavor but never manages to show me even one hop flower.  The lack of bitterness kills the balance of this brew.  Smooth and chewy, the lack of any bitterness makes the mouthfeel a bit sticky and cloying as well and brings down the drinkability some as well.  Not a bad beer but it definitely needs to find some balance.  After the good reviews this ESB had received I was somewhat excited to try it and to be honest, it let me down.  I will probably try it again, but not for quite some time.","Murph","Jul 28, 2002"

Aromas of biscuity goodness with a solid hop twinge. A good balance of malt and hops in flavor. One of the best domestic ESBs I have had. A session brew for me if there ever was one. Well worth the try.","goindownsouth","Jul 10, 2002"

4.48,24.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Watch out, this Scarlet Lady is a temptress! A superb English-style bitter, especially notable in that it comes from an American micro whose specialty is German-style beers. Thick layered head over a clear amber body; good malt foundation if a little horsey and woody. No matter; the rawness adds to the overall appeal. Hops give just the right twist of freshness, amplifying the terrific, medium-thick quality of the liquor (water). Very drinkable, excellent finish, and seemingly thirst-quenching - except that you're never satisfied! This can go head to head with the best of the UK but is distinctly American, perhaps primarily because of the water. I only bought one bottle and now I am very sad.","Thrasher","May 30, 2002"
