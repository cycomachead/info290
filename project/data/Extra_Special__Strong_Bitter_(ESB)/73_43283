3.3,-16.2,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours gold in color with a white ring around the top of the glass. Smell is subtle hops and nothing else. Very bitter in the taste. Lots of bittering hops in this beer. Bubbly, almost a heavy carbonated feel due to the hops. It's that bitter. Not a whole lotta flavor, just a very bitter beer. Easy drinking. Very good web, lacing on the side of the glass. After a few sips, this is a highly hopped beer. It really is noticeable.","FtownThrowDown","Jul 27, 2008"
3.92,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a pint glass and later into a pils glass, the pils is the way to go. Dark bronze color with a thin white head, tons of sticky lacing and bountiful carbonation. This is a nice looking beer. The aroma is favored by a sharp hop scent backed by some subtle malts, nice scent but it should be more abundant. Mouthfeel is also sharp and crisp with an ample fullness. The flavor is real nice, generous amounts of flowery hops are present. The malts are subtle and there are tiny overtones of citrus hop flavors. Somewhat similar to their Dortmunder Gold this is an enjoyable ale.","kinger","Jul 26, 2008"

4.07,3.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Golden amber body with creamy white head that falls somewhat quickly, leaving random spots of lacing down the glass. Nice fresh nose with floral, perfume, and light citrus notes. A biscuity essence and hints of caramel are underneath. Taste is nice and well balanced. Moderate bitterness up front followed by the malts which keep it in check. It ends with a slightly drying finish. Mouthfeel is nice with a good carbonation to it and slides down quite easy.

However, after many sixes of this, it's getting old for me. Very much a session beer, for a short while every season, it becomes my favorite, then fades.

Twelve ounce bottle pours a clear amber body with a small offwhite head that leaves a bit of patchy lace. Aroma is toasted malt, peppery hops, and a hint of florals. Light medium body is well carbonated. Taste has some caramel sweetness, toasted bread, peppery hops, and some fruity pear. Bitterness is tame but assertive. Very nicely balanced and highly drinkable. One of the better American stabs at an ESB.","merlin48","Jul 01, 2008"

Stale hops, corn and pale malts make up the nose. Very punchy and bright tasting. The hops are in great balance with the malts and it is not that bitter, faint hints of fruit and bread, it leaves a slight sweetness on the tongue. Its very seltzer-like in body and mouth feel. Very refreshing. Zingy beer.","ATPete","Jun 30, 2008"

3.95,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear light copper hue with a big bubbled one finger head that remains for a quite sometime. Stickiness is pretty hit or miss, but it's there. A whole bunch of bubbles race to the top of the glass as well. Smell is very GLBCesque. Peanut butter in the nose Yes, peanut butter! Just like the Burning River Pale. Mild malts and just a hint of sweet citrus malts tingle the nose as well. Very subtle overall aroma with this one, nicey. Flavor begins with a sweet nutty taste followed by a bit of grapefruit and pine. Caramel malts midway through leading to a lemongrass aftertaste with a hint of pepper and spice. Light to medium body with a sharp feel. Carbonation is a bit strong, but doesn't take away from the overall quality of this brew. Another solid drinkable beer from GLBC. I look forward to the day when their beers are available in NY, let's hope it's sooner rather than later.","BeerTruth","Apr 27, 2008"
3.58,-9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured a clear amber with 1 inch of frothy off-white head, good retention, some lacing. Smells of floral hops, a bit of malty biscuit, and honey, not a lot of aroma though, had to dig deep. Tastes of honey, toasted grain, and floral hops. Medium light in body with good carbonation. Not too bitter and has a crisp finish, but all the flavors seem a little muted. Easy to drink and sessionable, but needs a little more oomph in the flavor department.","HopDerek","Apr 26, 2008"
4.24,7.6,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,5,"MF & D- at first effervescent and thin bodied, but as the fizz quickly fades on the tongue, a slight thickness is revealed as this suddenly medium bodied ale coats the palate with a drying hop film. the pros and cons for me here are kinda tough to distinguish, since they're not really good or bad. from 2007 memories, i remember a slightly thicker body that was not quite syrupy, but i could possibly be getting that mixed in with memories of the feel of the several other traditional esb's i've had, and a slightly thicker less carbonated brew is somewhat desired. on the flip-side, this relatively highly carbonated beer keeps my attention, and is much more crisp and quenching than those from the past. maybe this batch is a little different, or maybe i'm just a scatterbrain. great lakes is pretty much my favorite brewery, and they've never presented me with a drink not to my liking (with the exception of christmas ale due to my personal preferences), but in the end 2008 moondog still feels like pale ale to me. its D is incredible however, and what it may lack in style, it more than makes up for in enjoyment.","hustlesworth","Apr 25, 2008"

It smells like grain, toasted malt, caramel and some butterscotch/diacetyl. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some earthy/herbal hops in the taste too. There's also a good long lasting bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth, clean and a bit slick. Drinkability is good too, it goes down easy and with a 5% ABV it's a good choice as a session beer. I think this is a good beer, it's nice and refreshing.

The floral hoppiness gives way to some slight fruit flavors and malty sweetness. As far a mouthfeel is concerned, the carbonation is perfect and it's a little thin as it rolls around my mouth.

4.43,12.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Poured (2) 12 oz bottles into my 1L glass. The off-white head nearly filled the glass as it formed above the brilliant copper body. This beer displays striking clarity, like looking into a perfect topaz gemstone. The head lasts a long time, with a thin layer of foam persisting for most of the glass. A mild maltiness supports a smooth hop prescence on the nose. The aroma doesn't reach out and grab you; rather it gently seduces you, taking you delicately by the hand and making you yearn for this beer. The taste is a buttery caramel experience that is fairly fruity, but develops a very pronounced bitterness that keeps the taste buds from getting too mellow on the malt without getting punishing. Every once in a while, a little bit of floral hoppiness shows up. The aftetaste is pretty clean for a flavorful ale, with a touch of buttered biscuits and just a hint of soapy bitterness. This is session city, man. Mouthfeel is solidly built on a good malt background, with the carbonation playing it's part without bringing any attention to itself. The drinkability is terrific. Sweetness, bitterness, smooth and enjoybale with a lower ABV. This beer is just about everything I hoped it would be. And a little more. A case of this may not be enough.","aaronh","Jul 15, 2003"
