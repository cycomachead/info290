Nice appearance with a clear amber body and small, whitish head which left some nice lacing in the glass. Just a bit of hop bitterness (kind of generic hop bitterness) on the nose. It also had a bit of the wet cardboard funk on the nose as well... glad it didn't show up in the taste. They definitely hit the bitterness just right (I like bitter), and the overall taste was just a bit grassy and light. Nice, light, easy-drinking mouthfeel. Quite refreshing to the palate on a hot afternoon. Bit lacking in flavor overall, though I am not sure if this is the style or the Fuller'. From my understanding ESB should be a little lighter and straightforward... what can I say, I am a big IPA fan! This was an ok beer. Probably a nice beer to offer to someone who is not a craft drinker who wants to try something a little different from their everyday BMC beers.","Mikus","Jul 27, 2014"

4.1,1,4,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours some light creamy light tan head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a dark copper brown that is clear. The beer leaves very little, if any, lacing. The beer has a deep luxurious caramel smell with some light hop pine backbone to take the edge off a little and vanilla notes to mix things up. The taste is similar to the smell but with a weaker vanilla profile and stronger hop profile. The hop is bitter and the caramel malt dulls the hops a bit. Low carbonation with a creamy finish. Overall, a great bitter and worth getting again. Very few bitters compare to this one.","HattedClassic","Jun 16, 2014"

The malt profile is bright and distinct with a well balanced bitterness that tingles the back of the tongue as it finishes. The complexity of this beer allows you to pick out the different ingredients which present themselves in a layered fashion. The low carbonation that is the hallmark of English ales allows you to pick up the complex flavors easily. This is indeed a perfect example of an English session ale.

I was fortunate to drink it on tap in England at least once a week when I lived there, but I find that even the bottled versions exported to the U.S. retain most of the complex character that makes this beer so great. I marvel when folks in the U.S. tell me that they have had a better version made here. Each time I try their favorites, I cannot help but think it is national bias or perhaps that this beer is so famous and there is some kind of reaction to that. It is pretty affordable, too, so I would highly encourage people to give it a shot (and try not to serve it too cold).","Wobbly","Oct 12, 2013"

Taste is nicely complex, starting with sour apples, raisin, black current, medlar, a little lemon and maybe orange, a whole array of fruits followed by a little hazelnut, toasted malt, caramel sweetness, and an earthy hop bitterness but little resin. Nice English tea bitter/currant hop finish along with a sweet syrupy persistence. Body thinnish as per the style but flavor robust, distinctive, and salient. Some dry yeast on the palate to close.

A slightly alcoholic warmth is detected. Carbonation feels very appropriate and pleasant in the mouth, the mouthfeel is medium-thin and slightly dry.

Pours fairly crystal clear orange amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of raisin, apple, caramel, biscuit, toffee, brown sugar, light nuttiness, and light floral hops. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and fruity ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of golden raisin, caramel, biscuit, toffee, apple, brown sugar, light nuttiness, and floral hops. Lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, light fruit, toffee, brown sugar, and light floral on the the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; good robustness and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent ESB. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 09, 2013"

This iconic ESB is quite a drinkable session brew but it's a little steep cost-wise. $12 a 6-er isn't ridiculous, but even in the craft world I find it a bit high. Regardless, Fuller's ESB almost defines the ESB style with it's natural Burton-on-Trent water that really creates a stand-out feel with this beer and ties the malty sweetness with moderate earthy hop bitterness nicely.","BeerFMAndy","Jul 26, 2012"

Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity, the shade that makes me think of some of my former redheaded g/fs. Nose had a buttery/toffee smell, very soft, somewhat sweet. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was definitely toffee-like on the tongue. Finish was mellow, slightly sweet, very satisfying. I must try and find this in a CAN.","woodychandler","Jul 17, 2012"

Smells is slightly faint of roasty caramel notes, and faint floral, earthy, grassy hops. Taste is more dark toffee, and some citric bitter hops. I always think English hops have a more earthy taste than most, with a slight lemon citrus aftertaste. It is a nice balance between the malty backbone and the cleansing hops. The mouthfeel, like a lot of Fuller's, is extremely smooth. In Chicago, there is a really good clone of this beer called Honker's Ale, but this beer, complete with the soft English water and the original yeast is to be sought out if you want to find the standard ESB.

Fruity and pale on the palate with an emphasis on the hops and creamy feel. Like the smell the peach and apricots are really noticeable. Leaves a metallic lingering aftertaste. The feel is furry and very smooth. This thing just feels great. Hard to describe, but very unique. This is a classic. From the pour to the bottom of the glass it is always enjoyable.

Up front is a strong english yeast presence, mixed nuts, caramel malts that leads way to a drying floral hop finish with a slight metallic aftertaste. Soft feel and slightly drying out back, just very drinkable. This is my idea of a perfect session beer, even though it is 5.9%abv, I could definitely drink 4-5 of these in a sit in.

The palate centers on the English malts with that faint bitterness that is well integrated, nice red fruit and caramel notes. Texture is great, with nice thickness without being weighty and fat.

Nose expresses light toasted malts, a trace of caramel and a suggestion of honey. Taste consistent with nose; however, a distinct albeit not overpowering, noble hops presence is detected at the finish.

Color is a lovely medium dark amber with good bubble trails. Aroma is very malty, caramel, toffee, a bit of hops and fruit. Flavor is similar and has this thing where I almost think it's sweet, but not really, and ah, there it is, lurking behind some gentle bitterness and a hint of tang to keep it lively. Body is great and so is carbonation, especially for the style, although again, much better via cask. Finish is like flavor and tapers quickly but actually hangs around for a while.

It isn't the most complex beer out there, yet it doesn't taste simple either.

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, wheat, subtle sweet hop, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, banana, and subtle sweet hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice ESB. The flavor was very mild and enjoyable. Definitely didn't have the dropkick of hops that I'm used to and I was quite thankful for that fact. This really made this one easy drinking and would be friendly for all beer drinkers of any palate design. I actually picked up on a Belgian influence in this one which surprised me.

Some fruit and citrus hops getting along quite nicely and a bit of that citrusy hops bitterness lingering at the end. Very smooth which may (DEF) have something to do with drinking it off the Cask.

The aromas from the beer noted while pouring were caramel, toffee, a slight sour tone, and some hops. The caramel malt flavor is first on the tongue, with a subtle hoppy background to help balance it. Some toasted flavor characters, also. The beer is slick and smooth in mouth, with a crisp and light finish. The bitterness from the hops disappears once the beer clears your mouth, and you are left with a balance of sweet and sour on the aftertaste, which is extremely pleasant. This is one easy brew to consume. Goes well with anything from grilled meat dinners to pizza.","GarthDanielson","Feb 14, 2011"

4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"11.2 ounce bottle. Pours a bright orange, sort of the color of fresh rust, with a sturdy foam head that pocks the longer it sits there. Lacing can best be described as average. Doesn't stick around long. Aroma catches you off guard - it's almost sweet. Smells a bit like freshly baked french bread. Malt, followed up by an interesting green apple / apple cider type character. Huh. Wasn't expecting that at all. Medium body, heavier than the aroma would lead you to believe, with a good level of bitterness in the finish. Guess they don't call it an ESB for nothing. Flavor is pretty damn impressive. Complex malt washes over the mouth first before giving way to a refreshing green apple (looks like that's what I was smelling) hop finish. Malt character makes the beer almost sweet, but it never heads into that syrupy area so many others find themselves. Further drinking yields this pleasant earthiness. Mouthfeel is thick and bready. Wow. After just a few tastes I can appreciate why this brew is considered the prototype against which all other ESBs are measured. My only regret is not trying it sooner.","eclaycamp","Sep 06, 2010"

The taste is perfectly balanced and complex with malty caramel, butterscotch, brown sugar, nuts and biscuit, combined with a nice subtle hop bitter bite on the finish.

Smell is a nice caramel malt smell with a bit of laid back hops in the background. The malts are not overly caramel in aroma like some other beers I have had. There is also a bit of a nutty and bready characteristic to the smell. Taste is nice. The malts shine through very, very well, and they should. The caramel stays behind a bit and lets some fruity/citrus and earthy hops shine through. The bitterness is low and is expected to be in the misleadingly named style. The nutty and bready plays a minor role in the taste also. I think this beer has one of the best malt/hop balances ever, very nice. The caramel starts to take a front seat but never kills the beer. Mouthfeel is great for the flavor. The body is light-moderate and the carbs are moderately high. The only thing I would add here is a bit more creaminess and it would be perfect. I would love to session this beer. The price and taste make for a very highly drinkable beer. I am mad that my first bottle was old or just went bad during shipping.

The hops show through with an earthiness and a twist of an off-bitter citrus. Nice creamy mouthfeel that goes down smooth and adds a bit of warmth. Overall it's not bad, but not the best around.

It finishes with grassy and tobacco flavors and those flavors linger for some time. The feel is a tad watery at the front, growing to medium bodied feel, it thickens even more as it reaches the back of the palate.

The taste is neither as rich nor sweet as the aroma implies. It's amply malty, but balanced by a big hop bitterness. There's a hint of buttery diacetyl up front, but it's quickly overwhelmed by flavors of roasted malt, earthy hops, toasted nuts and fruitcake.

The aroma was fantastic, notes of malt sweetness with a hop aroma that was gone before you could put your finger on it. Taste is full but not heavy, delicate flavors of the English hops surround the tongue as the malt complexities become more apparent. Starts with the toffee, caramel malted flavorings and finishes slightly sweet with a mellow honey note that was delicious. Finishes a bit full in combination with a slightly less carbonation left the beer feeling richer and more complex. This still is a classic among English beers.

The taste comes on big and malty, moves into nice raw sugar notes, then grain, with orange-peel tang and more sweet malt in the finish. It's highly carbonated, light in body, refreshing but rich.

Carbonation is vigorous, with slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is very floral, with fruity hop character and a sweet malt backbone. This is a very balanced beer. Sweet and malty with toast and caramel notes, followed by a nice dry hop finish. It's a medium to full bodied brew, and the flavors remain on the palate for a good amount of time.

A medium-boded beer that is smooth and a little creamy with a fruity taste; picked up something akin to apples/pears.

3.7,-8.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Granted it is a nice bitter, but surely not my favourite and calling it the ""Extra Special Champion Ale"" is exaggerating a little, in my opinion. Perhaps it'll take a trip to England to convince me otherwise, and I likely will continue to revisit the ESB every so often to be sure, but I wouldn't consider this even the 'champion' of the Fuller's lineup. Either Fuller's Chiswick and/or the Fuller's 1845 are far, far more deserving of that title.","biegaman","Jun 18, 2009"

3.98,-2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Bright copper orange in the glass, mostly clear with a bit of an off white head, it stays thin but laces a bit. The smell is good caramel grain and toasted buttery biscuit and coarse hops with a touch of metallic sharpness. The taste is solid malt with a good deal of sweet grain perfectly balanced with just the right amount of hops. It's never really bitter but shows a great malt presence throughout which is accented by just enough English hop to make it really pleasant. The low carbonation in this beer gives it a great level of smoothness throughout that stays sweet until the finish which is fairly dry and slightly bitter. Maybe I'm just a sucker for old school British beer and styles but I really like this one it really doesn't stand out in any one category but when all put together it's a pretty good beer.","fank2788","Jun 09, 2009"

Smell is malt, mild floral hops. Taste is malt, dry mouthfeel with a long bitter finish. Balance is just about right. I've never had this out of the bottle so I can't comment on whether the can or the trip overseas diminished it. By the 15 minutes mark, it was quite flat but the taste got only better.

Immediately after the pour, I smelled a terrific breadiness, but after a minute, I only smell a hint of minerals. The taste blows away any blandness of smell, however; a buttery, toffee flavor is perfectly balanced by a light hop note. Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth with just a slight hop note.

With that hops explosion the finish is still decidedly smooth. I had the opportune or misfortune (depending on your perspective) to not only sample this for review in a glass, but also to pull a bottle from the cooler at a barbeque and I am able to comment that this beer is far better when allowed to breath in a glass than when sucked out of the bottle.","Ragingbull","May 05, 2009"

There is a hint of bitter behind the flavor, and the aftertaste is somewhat bitter, but It definitely is not the bitterness I expected. The mouth is quite nice. There is little carbonation, but still there is a tart feeling to this beer. It's quite drinkable, though with the 6% and the size of the bottle, one is enough for me.

Pours a clear amber color with a small white head that settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Sublime ale aroma. Carmelized malt at first with some mineral qualities until the wonderful floral and herbal hop aroma takes over. I love the aroma of English hops. The flavor does not disapoint either. Herbal hop flavor from the get go but there is a solid malt backbone that lends a sweetness throughout. Even some fruity esters near the end. Definate bitter finish. Nice carbonation that compliments the body. The texture is not perfect but very good for a session beer. I think this is as good as it gets for an ESB.

There's plenty of malt in the aroma with some peaches and raisins, but what's really present in the nose is alcohol. The same is true for the taste: while I was not disappointed in the strong malt content and the balanced hops hit, the alcohol overshadowed much of the flavor. For a 5.9% beer, I was surprised. Overall, this had the boozy feel of a Belgian quad, with a malty intensity that came close to matching that style. Not quite what I expected, but not bad. Frankly, I expected something a bit less dense. Still, since I bought two bottles, I'll have to give this one another swing soon.","gfreed","Feb 08, 2009"

Caramel, toffee, nut, chocolate, and coffee all jump out initially, with a good amount of herbal, floral grassy hops with just the slightest hints of licorice, banana, and butterscotch. Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. Super drinkable. One of the best - if not the best - ESB I have ever had. Flavor is so complex and yet complimentary and balanced.

Medium to full-bodied, level of carbonation matches the weight and allows the beer to pause in the mouth for consideration. Here, there's more of a dry chocolate powder and malt thing going on than sweeter caramel. Maybe raw coffee beans. Fruitcake kind of flavoring, neither fully candied nor fresh, the fruit does feel formed. Presence extends from tongue to mouth roof. More hops present as mouth residue.

A good dark amber colour. Plenty of malt in the nose with a promise of hops to come. A good balance of both in the taste, tending towards the malty sweetness. I'd have preferred it to go the other way, in the direction of the hops, but that's merely a personal preference and I'm not going to mark it down for that - this is a very well-brewed beer. I do have to take off half a point for the mouthfeel though which I find a bit on the thin side.

This beer is incredibly more refined and well-rounded than any American ESB I've ever had, all of which usually seem (by comparison) to be overly hoppy and bitter simply for the sake of the hops and bitterness. Fuller's, on the other hand, utilises the hops and bitterness to a complete-picture end: it gives them a purpose, and a meaning, and has something to say with them.

Light caramel and a hint of hops with breadiness and nuts. A hint of light fruits and berries. Taste is more of the same, malty at first. The toffee and butter come first and lead into a dry nuttiness. Hops aren't assertive, but they're ever-present and provide the lightest spicy/citrus backdrop to everything. Finish is nice and long.

The smell reminds me of Newcastle, but it is a much better variation overall. The taste is widely complex. It begins with a toasted maltiness, bready sweet caramel, and some interesting sweet malts. The taste segues into a more burnt caramel taste, more dryish on the palate, more firm bodied. It finishes being much hoppier, bitter, more a traditional style British ale. The aftertaste does linger quite awhile. The beer is pretty substantial, medium bodied, moderately carbonated, and quite heavy on the tongue in parts.

The aroma is nice, malt is the first thing that I notice which seem to give of a scent of caramel while also having a pretty clear hop smell that seems to catch up. The hop aroma really makes you think that this is a classic English beer with the Challenger, Northdown and Golding hops. This is a very nice beer as it has a very smooth feel with taste highlights of caramel, nuts, and additional malt flavors noticeable upfront and carrying through to the end.

The first whiff is dried fruit with a very subtle tartness and astringency. These aromas subside as a complex maltiness reveals itself on the back half of my tongue. Lightly roasted malt is complimented by a sweet, earthy flavor, and the understated hops are obviously doing quite a balancing act.

The beer itself was a fantastic amber, refreshing, the color of fresh apple juice. The flavor has a wonderful maltiness about it with slight hints of fruit. This easily drinkable beer gets some of its complexity due to the marriage of four different hops (Target, Challenger, Northdown, and the famous Goldings to be exact), and ends with slightly bitter, lemony undertones.

I have found that once I note this taste in a beer it is something I just can't get past. It becomes the dominant taste and it just overpowers everything else on my palate. In this case it wasn't as overpowering as i've noted in the past but it was still there and I can never quite get it out of my mind as I drink this one. Some malt flavors and spicyness do break through. Overall an OK beer but not one that I will return to often.

Very fine carbon dioxide bubbles can be seen making their way toward the unknown reaches of their small galaxy. The nose is richly bready. Somewhat of a lightly toasted sourdough appeal. There seems to be a pinch of ginger and some old fruit and caramel scents as well. The taste is extremely well proportioned. The bitterness is not much more than a namesake here as was expected. It is vaguely bitter, with most of the accent falling into the malt arena. Ginger impressions dot the bready malt and there is a pleasant brown sugar feel in the finish. Hopping seems subdued in the nose and citrus and dry qualities are nonexistant here. This is very pleasant and well rounded. I can understand why it is recommended as an initiation into the style.

The aroma is spicy and herbal with notes of caramel and toffee. The taste is lightly sweet up front with a toffee maltiness to it. Interestingly enough this beer seems to be more balanced towards the malt than the London Pride I just had (perhaps this is palate fatigue). There is a nice fruitiness that compliments the toffee & caramel maltiness; much of the fruitiness is from the slightly citrusy, lemon-like hops with perhaps some hints of currants. The beers finish is nicely bitter with a lingering herbal hop note. This is quite tasty, but not as flavorful and hoppy as I remember it being.","Gueuzedude","Jul 11, 2005"

The taste consists of a strong caramelized malt flavor with flavorful, drying hops making their appearance towards the end of a sip. Bitterness is relatively mild. A touch of fruitness is also detected. A sip is concluded with a sustained malt finish. This is far from my favorite style and one that I don't have too much experience with, but I found this to be a great beer, driven by it's malt character, with really high drinkability.

Smell was also a bit better than one might expect from an ESB, including the trademark bouquet of bitters plus a gentler almost toffee undertone. Starts malty smooth and quite heavy, resting on the tongue with a notable full-bodied feel and a gradually more complex array of bitter flavors. I couldn't exactly detect a specific flavor, but I can say that this beer was a good representative of the sorts of tastes that an ESB should have. Mouthfeel a bit more dry than I'd expected and the brew leaves one with that ESB tail of sharp aftertastes that a drinker of heavier beers will certainly find familiar.

The taste is a very balanced one, that leans towards the sweeter side of the spectrum. This stuff is very malty but the hop balance is there as well. The mouthfeel is creamy and good and the drinkability is classic. I find the bottled versions of this beer, and the London Pride, to be much sweeter than their cask cousins.

They understand their beer and want the best for the drinker. Cleverly they have upped the strength 0.4% to 5.9% Alc.

Poured from a hefty 500ml brown bottle, it had a foamy off white head that left a lot of lace, and receded to a thick ring. Very rich, intense copper hue, makes me wonder if I have a fetish for copper (perhaps I should change my favorite style....). Nose is primarily hops, some caramel malt, a touch metallic, very faint spice. Flavour is a whirlwind of hops and malt, very nice blend, although the hops stand out far more. Thick buttery mouthfeel, but goes down very easy. The aftertaste lingers long after the glass has been emptied.","IronDjinn","Jul 09, 2003"
4.03,-0.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Appearance a nice coppery gold color with minimal carbonation. Smell suggests alcohol with slight malt aroma. This tasted like it has more than 5.9% alcohol.

4.4,8.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,5,"This is a superior ale that has been in my opinion a most consistent one. I used to drink this one hand-pulled in an English pub years ago, and the bottled version is nearly as good. Super clear amber with a frothy head and light lacing. Aroma is outstanding, sweet, hoppy and malty all at once. Boy is this ale balanced! Smooth and full bodied with an incredible mixture of English hops that bitter so tenderly. Malt is sweet and fresh providing a perfect counter to all of the different English hops used. The original and in my opinion the best ESB out there.","BierReise","Jul 04, 2003"

Taste is wonderful with a hint of sweetness and a hoppy bitterness that is very refreshing. There is a distinct maltyness as well. Give it a try, you'll like it. Very smooth if on tap but you don't want it to cold. This keeps the full flavor from comming out.","mapman97","Jul 01, 2003"

The rich amber color of the brew is quite inviting and is accompanied but a nice sort of malty aroma and a thick head for an ESB. The head continues quite well through the finish.

Foam never completely disappeared as the beer retreated down the inside of my glass. Wonderful aroma of malt and honey that I have never smelled before. Beautifully balanced tast of honey and malt, with a hop bite that adds citrus to the background yet doesn't intrude. Very creamy & thick mouthfeel, better than some beers with ""cream"" in the title.Drinkability? ""Oh, no! I only bought one!"" I'll be buying more of these very soon.

A very nice smell of malt and something sweet--possibly honey, is present. The taste is also of malt, some sweetness is present as well. A bit of fruity hops make themselves known in the finish. Overall a very nicely balanced taste--not overpowering in any one aspect, and very pleasant.

While they all were good, this is the first one that really stood out! Poured a slightly reddish brown. Fair amount of head to it: it really depends on how it is pulled. Fairly good aroma of malts and hops. The taste actually has some hop bite to it, with maybe a hint of chocolate? Very smooth.

There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell seems to be a mix of caramel, pine, and hops. The taste is a good bite of hops, but not so much as an IPA, with a mixture of sweetness and spicy flavors together. The mouthfeel is a little weak, but this is still a smooth ale with a good drinkability.","SheepNutz","May 23, 2003"
4.52,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Amber in color with a mild aroma, Fuller's ESB is deceptive in appearance. Like most ESB's, Fullers hits you with an initial blush of bitterness. Surprisingly, this ESB quickly backs off and finishes smooth and lets you appreciate its complex character more than most ESBs. This smoothness lends to an immensely drinkable beer. An ardent fan of ESBs, I often have a hard time winning my freinds over. Fullers is the first bitter I've found that even non-ESB drinkers can appreciate.","wyllder","May 19, 2003"

Head retention is moderate, leaving thick, foamy patches of lace on the glass. Wonderful base of lightly bready caramel malt with spicy and floral/herbal hop notes in the smell. Bready caramel malt flavor, with a bigger presence of hops than in the aroma. Hops are herbal, slightly spicy, and fairly bitter. Aftertaste is hoppy, spicy and piney. Moderate bodied beer, and pretty smooth. Leaves a thick oily hop coating on the tongue.

It seems to have been somewhat overshadowed by some of the more hopped American micros, and some have stated that it is superior in the U.K. If so, I would love to try it, because I love this beer as is. The smoothness is unmatched in an ale, and the wonderful, wine-like flavor stands out. Just bitter enough without over-doing it. I have never once been disappointed when I've bought ESB.

The full of complex blend of English hops provide ample bitterness and a hint mellow apples. Very balanced, rich and smooth.

Also has a honeyish note and yeast-like notes. The taste is a nice bitter hop, very crisp and sharp, somewhat citrusy and a light yeasty malt that rounds out with a small honey-like hint finishing a mostly medium to light bodied feel and a tight dryness. There's alot of bitterness to this and alot of punch. Very indicitive to the style. This can be a very drinkable beer but the 5.9% sneaks up on you soon after taking many swigs. Which is easy to do, cuz this stuff is pretty darn smooth for being pretty darn bitter.","tavernjef","Apr 02, 2003"

A mellow hoppy aroma is a wonderful greeting. Fuller's beer always has the best aromas. The hops come through in the flavor of course, kind of similar to the London Pride in a way, but also unique. The maltiness comes first, then a hoppy finish and a bitter aftertaste. The bitterness isn't overpowering but definitely solid, much to my liking since I'm not much for over-the-top hops. Fuller's is one awesome brewery, all of their beers are amazing. Try them all and expect your senses to be treated like royalty.","AudioGilz","Mar 24, 2003"

I thought it would be a bit more bitter and spicy. The aftertaste brings in a bit of that bitterness I was looking for, but not at a huge level. The balance in this beer is near perfect. The flavors don't blend, but perform more of a kamaeleon (sp) like act, changing from malts to hops. The body is medium, with a pretty hearty flavor. Complexity is at a decent level. It is very drinkable and overall very enjoyable. Fuller's has done a great job on every brew I have had from them including this one.","ElGuapo","Mar 18, 2003"

Extremely rich aroma of caramel, fruit, spices, hops, and slight alcohol. Taste begins with caramel, dark fruit, and a rather full, slightly toasty malt, with very little overt sweetness. Towards the end of the taste, earthy hop bitterness appears, both full and lingering, but neither harsh nor overpowering. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth. It is difficult to overpraise Fuller's ESB, this is what beer is meant to be.","Pegasus","Mar 01, 2003"

Classically English, this brew evidences the reverse of the American pale ales, where the hops dominate. This, to my mind, results in a more comforting, mellow ale, great for a session beer. A world classic that we should all return to if we've been away sampling newer brews with more bells and whistles. Excellent brewing.","Riggo","Feb 16, 2003"

Especially on Nitro, this beer pours cream toned head that along with the deep ruby amber hue looked magnificant in the Fuller's Imperial pint glass. This beer had a really smooth hop character that blends perfectly with the sweetness it offers the drinker. A creamy full mouthfeel forms with each sip, and the flavors are full of hop bittering maybe Kent Goldings.

Finish is dry with a pleasant bitterness which lingers on into the aftertaste. Very slight alcohol warming as the beer goes down, completely unobtrusive.

The head settles, but leaves some nice ""British"" lace. Great complex malty aroma! Caramel, nut, cherry, and then just a little leafy hop character. Hops aren't so noticeable until it hits your palate. Speaking of which, the flavor does not fail to completely impress! Grainy sweet malt blends perfectly with bittering hops to create one of the best, most classic flavors in English beer history! Hop character is a bit earthy, leafy, and oily, and a bit of cherry is present once again as well. Dry, hoppy finish. Hop spiciness and malt sweetness are left on the tongue afterwards. Medium to full body. What a classic brew this is! One of my favorites. This one is a 12 oz., which is not enough, I prefer the 18.7 oz. bottles. However, this time I'm not complaining, I got this in the Fuller's gift pack, which contains 2 bottles each of 4 of their beers, plus a nonik pint glass. Great deal.

The Fuller's yeast is quite clear in the aroma that expresses a mineral/iron note, a touch of diacetyl, some light fruit and very mild hops over a distinctly caramel maltiness. The body is medium, and combines with an exceptionally fine (very tiny bubbles), low level carbonation to create an astonishingly smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel. Very nice. The flavor starts with light soft fruit and a mild mineral / iron component (ie. not nearly as ""bloody"" as Bateman's XXXB) atop it's rich caramel maltiness and then slowly falls away to a dry, bitter and hoppy finish that showcases the earthy, grassy, and leafy hop character that runs throughout.

4.21,3.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This copper colored ale shows nice clarity and pours with a strong head with excellent retention and develops a nice rocky quality as it subsides.  The lace clings to the glass and refuses to slide down, content to stay put throughout the entire glass.  The aroma is almost all sweetness, with a hint of hops to lend a spicy note.  The taste is exquisite, with a very pronounced caramel sweetness like I have never tasted before.   There is some nice hop spice in the finish.  The aftertaste is lingering but very pleasant.   The mouthfeel is somewhat thick, but it matches the flavor profile.  This would be an excellent session beer, as this glass went down very quickly and left me craving more.","aaronh","Nov 09, 2002"
3.68,-9.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This beer pours a deep clear amber with a thick white head, which quickly settles.  The carbonation is somewhat mild.  Very malty in aroma and flavor... some sweetness with mostly carmel malt, but some toasted malt flavor also sneaks through.  Floral hops in the aroma, and some floral notes in the flavor as well.  Not very bitter for an ESB... but smooth, and very drinkable.","zerk","Nov 07, 2002"
3.6,-11.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"I was lucky to get the draught version. Dark amber with a decent off-white head. Hops aroma very conspicuous. On the scale of ESB's I have had, this was better than average but it doesn't beat the Crooked River I had not too long ago. It just didn't have the bitterness I was expecting. As a matter of fact I think the London Pride has more bite. There is more malt in the mix here, which doesn't make it a bad beer, just less ""ESB"" than I was expecting. All that aside this is still a good beer.","Dogbrick","Nov 05, 2002"
3.6,-11.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The pour a deep amber too almost brown color, the head is massive, creamy with thick glutinous lace that clings to the glass. Nose is light malt, caramel, and a hint of citrus. Start is malt, lightly sweet, the top flimsy, and the finish pleasantly hopped, mildly acidic, with a long lasting malt dry aftertaste. Quite drinkable and well worth a sample, and a beer I sample often","Gusler","Nov 04, 2002"
4.77,17.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"The ESB has a bit more sting than Fuller's London Pride which is nice, but it covers up some of the more subtle notes of the London Pride too. I simply love this beer.","zakery","Oct 04, 2002"
3.75,-7.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Better cask conditioned than from the bottle, but have had good samples on cask and have had bad ones, at its best, its quite resiny, bittersweet, with a bitter hop finish, medium to full bodied, quite good, but perhaps a touch overated.","rastaman","Sep 29, 2002"
4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer seemed to pour a little flat but still left a bit of head. Outstanding amber color. Excellent full, well bablanced flavor. For a person who is not big on English style beers, I was quite impressed with the taste of this one. For a company whose botle mentions that Fuller's ESB is the world's original ESB, they certainly have it done right.","sinistersteve","Sep 15, 2002"
4.15,2.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours to a nice clear amber color with an off-white head that seemed to disappear rather quickly. I noticed that biscuity/malty aroma that others described. The taste is well-balanced between a mild hop flavor and some caramel malt flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a little carbonation. It's easily drinkable, and I don't know who could resist a second offering of this. This is a classic ESB.","Jon","Aug 22, 2002"
3.85,-5.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours with an off-white head, clear golden liquid with highlights of red. Nose is of very biscuity malt, clean too. Taste is a bit of butterscotch diacetyl, with great hoppy dryness taking it all the way to the finish which is pleasantly bitter and long. This original E.S.B. still stands above all others, I.M.O.","beerluvr","Aug 17, 2002"
3.95,-2.7,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Served a clear amber color with a tiny, creamy white head and minimal lacing.  Great smooth biscuity malt aroma but not much else leaving the aroma with a little to be desired.  The biscuity malt opens up the brew and carries it most of the way as their is a subtle hop bitterness that holds up the brew well.  Very smooth but slightly overcarbonated, none the less this is one awesomely drinkable brew and one that I would love to try on cask.","Murph","Aug 17, 2002"
4,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Clear amber with thin, short lasting, off-white head.  Smell was a nice hoppy bitterness with delicate malt undertones.  The flavor was more of the same, which became less bitter as it warmed, more balanced.  There was a nice degree of carbonation and long-lasting flavor.  Good drinkability as I could drink a couple per night.","ryanocerus","Aug 14, 2002"
4.55,12.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"A rich and tasty ESB.  Medium amber with thick lace and head. Aroma balanced between sweet carmel and floral hops.  Taste is rich and complex with a sweet carmel malt sweetness. Almost a trace of what to me tastes like a tootsie roll.  Strong hop presence backs up with full floral bite.  Very drinkable and a my session brew for the other day.","psugrad98","Jul 21, 2002"
3.38,-16.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a nice copper amber color and formed a nice bubbley off white head that left some lace. It had an aroma of hops, malt and caramel. The flavor was a taste of hops, malt, caramel. Lighter than some of the other ESBs I have tried. A slightly bittersweet aftertaste to it. Not as sweet as some of the others, which I prefer.","Wildman","Jul 10, 2002"
4.3,5.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Another picnic choice - 22 oz bottle. Had to be the best I had today. Amberish-red (making up words here), dry and hoppy from start to finish. And to me, the perfect refreshing and still dry taste. Not as hoppy as I would have expected but for today's outing it was perfect. Moving right up to the top of the list for a summer quaff. There was definitely no metallic taste that some others have mentioned.","MTMugs","Jun 30, 2002"
4.38,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On first taste you get a hint of malt followed by lively mouth and bitter smooth finish.  The aftertaste is mellowed by a smooth coated tongue with hints of fruit.  This is the standard english bitter.","frank4sail","Jun 21, 2002"
4.35,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It's copper with a trace of red and a healthy head.  The smell is caramel with a little spice and a nice hop aroma.  The flavor is well-balanced, with a strong malt flavor, notes of caramel and fruit, and a healthy hop kick.  Fuller's is surprisingly easy going down.  This is a fine beer.","mickeymac","Jun 14, 2002"
4.55,12.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"Pours a clear copper color, with a firm foamy head that dies pretty quicklyleaves a nice ring of lace. On the nose is hops, and slight caramel aroma. Mouth feel is fairly smooth but a bit tingly. On the palate slightly sweet, bitterness, some fruitiness, earthy graininess, and caramel and roasted malt in the background. Very enjoyable brew, I like it a lotvery flavorful!","WilliamPhilaPa","Jun 11, 2002"
3.96,-2.5,4,3,4.5,4,4,"""The World's Original Extra Special Bitter"" ... perhaps, but there's better interpretations of the style in my opinion. Still, the quintessential ESB and a beer everyone should try -- at the very least for the sturdy, impressive bottle.","Todd","Jun 07, 2002"
4.38,7.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear darker amber, approaching ruby.  Head is big-bubbled and about 1/4 of an inch after a minute.  Slightly spicy aroma, a little nutmeg.  Nice medium mouthfeel and restrained carbonation.  Flavors are pretty complex and range from allspice through traces of chocolate.  Nice floral bittering.  Really nice, but not overblown ESB -- may be my favorite.  Fine brew, as if Fuller's would do anything else.  Balance is great.  Very subtle compared to many American renditions.","ADR","Jun 04, 2002"
4.33,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Another sentimental favorite, one of the first good beers I stumbled accross. Very appealing copper color, I thought the head left too quickly. Smell was nice and bitter, big hops. Just a very hop full bitter, as expected.(read the label)  Easy to drink several at a time, and goes with chicken very well. I think the six pack bottles are little overpriced about $9-10 here. There is usually something different to try for a better price, but I think it is a very good beer.","StevieW","Jun 01, 2002"
3.09,-23.9,4,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This is a great beer but unfortunately, it depends on when you have it. I have had it on tap and it was superb and then when I went back, it tasted and smelled of metal. I have a feeling it depends on the water used. If you get it when it's good, you're in for a good beer. Not too hoppy, good balance.","Jdiddy","May 27, 2002"
4.05,-0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Very well balanced malt/hop tones. Mouthfeel was excellent. Thin head dissipated quickly. Pleasant copper color. This is a good beer, but rather pricey at $10 a six pack. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one. I don't know if this is the average price for this brew or not.","LarryV","May 25, 2002"
3.03,-25.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"This beer's a clear copper with a very slight head.  Carbonation is evident as a small quantity of bubbles surface.  A small herbal aroma mixed with a slight perfume smell.  You can tell this is an English brew.  There's quite the stinging hop presence.  Almost annoying, but not quite.  Some decent malt tones, but nothing stands out to me with this one.  It's not ""extra special"" in my opinion.  It may be the original ESB, but certainly is not the best ESB (as Rogue's Brutal Bitter and Alesmith's Anvil ESB are much better.","Bighuge","May 21, 2002"
3.88,-4.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Really an attractive looking beer with nice clear red-gold-brown color and good full head.  Aroma is rather light overall and largely malt without much hint of hops.  Full malt flavor but hops stronger than I expected and maybe a little out of balance for my tastes. I do like the dry finish.  Medium mouthfeel with some carbonation perceptible.  Can note the alcohol in warming and a bit in taste too.  I'd like to try this again, especially on tap if I can find it.","garymuchow","May 17, 2002"
4.01,-1.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Fuller’s ESB:  Had a great week, found and enjoyed several Fuller’s beer.  ESB in Imperial Pint Brown Bottle.  Big malt and big hop tastes, strong aromas, rich (huge) body.  Bit of bitter (hops) bite at the end.  Fuller’s brews very, very good beers.  Very highly recommended.","jackndan","May 14, 2002"
4.08,0.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"First beer that I've ever had that I could see someone describing it as having a chewy maltiness. Definite malt presence, but you don't really notice that until after a few sips as the bitterness hits you first and as you get used to it the malt starts rearing it's lovely head. Very nicely balanced despite the bitterness. It's interesting to see what the different hops do in beers. The hops in this beer offer little to the flavor of the beer except bitterness while in Victory's HopDevil they give it a very floral/perfumey smell and taste and in most APAs they lend a grapefruity taste.","aracauna","May 03, 2002"
4.3,5.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Man, do I ever like this stuff.  Nice clear amber color with an ample head.  Smells great with its malty carmel aroma.  When I tasted it the first thing I thought of was carmel apples.  Very well balanced with a slight hop bitterness than carries into the aftertaste.  Great beer!  I highly recommend it.","DrewS","May 02, 2002"
4.65,14.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"The entire line of Fullers beers are incredible, especially the ESB. This beer has wonderful balance between the aroma to the final taste. For me all other ESB beers fail to measure up to the Fullers.","Reverand","Apr 26, 2002"
4.05,-0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Appealing both visually and olfactorily (is that a word?) with a pleasing earthy scent. Superb mouthfeel and wonderful, firm malt flavor that is hearty and rousing. Finish is perfectly balanced with a rounded bready dryness (Kent Goldings?), does not linger long on the palate. The metallic undertaste does get to me though, and it is the one stumbling block of this beer. Some may not mind it; I do. Perhaps it is a symptom of adjuncts. At any rate, this is otherwise a splendid beer; each sip is a slightly different experience and that is always the sign of a very good beer.","Thrasher","Apr 25, 2002"
4.25,4.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The head dissapates quickly into a thin layer that leaves a sparse web down the glass.  Perfectly bronze in color exhibiting excellent clarity.  Lots of fruity and bready esters hit the nose at first, but are then followed by a earthy Fuggles hop nose.  As the beer warms, an almost licorice note can be perceived.  The moderate carbonation seems to lighten the body at first, but as CO2 escapes the body seems to increase. The hop bitterness is quite mild and clean, serving to balance the very pleasant maltiness.  Hop flavor is signature British, and is characterized by rustic, earthy, leafy, and slightly floral components.  Quite complex.  Toasted malt flavors round out the finish.  This very well crafted and highly drinkable ESB is another quality Fullers beer.  I'll place this just a notch below Youngs SLA and London Pride, since it's more subdued in yeast fruity esters, something I love in a bitter or English pale.","marc77","Apr 03, 2002"
4.35,7.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A very complex beer.  this is not just a bitter but a flavorful bitter.  the flavor hops were a bit flowery, like saaz, i believe, but i know that fullers does not use saaz.  this has a great lingering finish.  the malt and hop balance is superb.","canoehornpoint","Mar 31, 2002"

Now I love it.  Very smooth!  Makes you want to roll it around before you send it down the hatch.  It has a nice head that leaves traces of it down the side of the glass all the way to the bottom.  It has a brilliant medium amber color and clarity.  The taste is almost buttery and is very smooth and creamy.  The mouthfeel is by far the best I've had from any beer, period.  This is the beer I claim as my ""fallback"" beer...and I mean that with the greatest of compliments.","BeerAngel","Mar 29, 2002"

There isn't an off balanced feature in this brew, including the hop/malt balance.  If there was a perfect marriage between these contrasts, Fuller's ESB has succeded.
