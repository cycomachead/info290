"Nicely balanced and very drinkable, I'll have to remember this one."
""
"Overall:  Wow!  What a difference a year makes!  Either Southern Tier has changed the recipe for this beer and amped up the malt presence while dialing down the hops, which I doubt, or my palate has really grown over the past year to be much more tolerant of hops, as I found this yearâ€™s edition to be really, really tasty!"
"bitter and hoppy with a clean and dry finish. Very enjoyable"
""
""
"I picked up this beer because I saw in some random Internet article that this was one of ""10 beers you need to have this fall"". Well, that article was totally wrong. There is nothing special about this beer. It tastes just like a standard IPA, even though I don't think it's classified as such. I was disappointed by this beer."

"Hop-forward ale with just enough toasted malt with touches of caramel in the back-end to give it some foundation.  Drinks like an IPA."

"Nice dark copper clear body with small head.  Very sweet and hoppy scents.  Not of the citrus variety though.  Taste is very flavorful and give quite a pow.  Nice sweet malt balance to the hop flavorings.  Hops lean towards pine. Slight bitter finish but really fairly subtle and ok by my preference.  Very high ABV for an ESP variety beer but this works just fine.  Definitely would revisit if presented opportunity."

"Harvest Ale is my favorite of all of the autumn beers.  It is not too spicey, and is quite refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear medium amber pour coupled with a dash of dark ruby and with a good head.  Retention is normal, lacing is above normal.  Very nice nose of blended hops (citric, tropical and a touch of dank pine) over a light biscuit.  Light medium body with a smooth texture.  Slightly above normal carbonation with a nice effervescent finish.  Very nice balanced flavor profile that is complex.  It begins with a rush of hop flavor - the citric and tropicals lead then flow into a dank note that is much more prevalent than suggested in the nose. The middle is a mild bitterness over biscuit, with a touch of caramel, light sweetness.  The finish somewhat dry, but leaves you with the classic English ESB flavors and bitterness over a fading light biscuit.  The 6.7% alcohol is completely hidden in this outstanding ESB."
"This was a surprisingly good beer, expecting a malty harvest brew, but got a nicely balanced hoppy beer.  Very drinkable and satisfiying"
""
""
""
"This is a disappointment by Southern Tier standards.  It's just not as good as a lot of their other stuff.  That said, it's still Southern Tier, so it's still very good and definitely worth trying.  It's just not on par with their admittedly high standards."
"Bitter and juicy yet well malted. A strange but good ""ESB."""
""
""
"T: Pale malts, biscuity flavor second to citrus flavors of grapefruit and orange. Grassy and hop forward with moderate pine bitterness (4/5)."

"Clear orange copper pour with a small and airy white head. Really nice citrusy aroma. Very light flavor that has piney hops balanced out by a nice grainy caramel malt."
""
""
"O:  This is definitely on the higher end of ABV for an ESB, which helps the flavors out a lot.  Good, but I went in with wrong expectations (pumpkin beer).  That is why they need to label a style outside of Harvest, Special Ale and Seasonal."

"3.75 really good beer lovers beer.  Nothing showy but the mouthfeel, but i would have another"
"I think this is a great. It has a nice, subtle sweetness to the smell which is then complemented by a good, bitter piney taste. A very nice seasonal offering indeed. I would get this again."

"Overall - A decent excellent example of an ESB although my bottle wasn't too fresh... would like to try a fresher bottle as this would be a good sessionable ale"
""
""
""
"O-Overall a well-made beer again by Southern Tier"
""
""
""
""

"Fairly moderate in aroma and flavor, with nice citrus underpinnings. Not the best of the fresh hopped beers, but a decent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light copper colored, very fine carbonation, minimal bubbles on top. There's a heavy citrus and pine smell, sharp but pleasing. A dry tasting beer, bitter but with just enough malty sweetness not to make you pucker. Not overly complex in terms of its flavors. There's a grassy/vegetable flavor, and some caramel notes, too. For an ESB, it is light in its body. Very drinkable, especially late in the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pungent citrus hoppy resinous tones permeate throughout this beer. It is tremendously hop forward. The smell reminds me of opening a hop bag before I pour the contents into boiling wort. This is very crisp but not too dry. The hops linger on the tongue for a good while. Substantially bitter and very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not a bad ESB...I have had a few and this is just above average. good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Good seasonal warmer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a near-iridescent coppered amber with limited white head that disappears fairly quickly. Aroma is primarily of caramelized malts. The flavour starts with the sweet caramelization but transitions into a pleasant bitterness in the body and finish. Although I can't pick out specific varietals, pleased this is an ESB that has met more than just bittering hops."
""
""
""
"O- Very solid beer. Great, fitting aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I guess I had something else in mind when I saw ""Harvest Ale"" written on the six pack. Reminded me of a run-of-the-mill IPA. Similar to Harpoon IPA. However, the strong alcohol bite turned me off. I like Southern Tier's other offering but I can not recommend this."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad stab at the style. Hops have a little more bite than I'd expect, and the malt base stays a little safe and simple. They're well in the ballpark of what the style should be though, and it's still enjoyable to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Liking hop flavor makes me like this one. its close to an IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O- it's not really an ESB in the English beer sense but it is quite good and well worth trying as a seasonal."

"Souther tier brewery has another wonderful beer on tap. Nice grapefruit hoppiness that seems to make for a wonderful fall beer. I actually thought it would be a little more bitter than what it was, maybe just because of the food I was eating with it. It is a great go to beer for the fall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it doesn't really remind me of a bitter, but it's still an ok brew for drinking."
"Pours a copper color with a very carbonated off white head, leaving a slight amount of lacing along the glass. Smell is probably this beer's best feature -- just that typical great fall hoppy aroma with a nice grapefruit twist. I didn't think the taste was all that bitter for an ESB; this was actually very easy to drink. Very well balanced. In addition to the citrus-y taste, I also detected a sweet caramel undertone. Think this would be a great Thanksgiving Day session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of mild hops, some malts. Taste is well balanced hops and malts, some bitterness, a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a very drinkable, and solid beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very well done strong bitter style ale; the scent is subtle and flavors are pleasant and easy drinking; nice fall/winter style ale."
""
"Overall, I always seem to like what Southern Tier is doing and this is another example of a well made and well balanced ale."
""

"Overall: Yet another good beer from Southern Tier. Haven't had anything from these guys that I don't like!"

"Good stuff, I like ESB with a bit more kick and this has it now."
"O: Americanized ESB anyone? On the high end for both hoppiness and alcohol in terms of the style, but it works very well in the context of the beer. It makes for a great fall seasonal brew, as it has the slightly higher abv and the maltiness to go with it. ST does a great job ""imperializing"" some regular styles, and this is no exception"

"OVERALL- LIKE THIS BEER. THE HOP AFTERTASTE TURN TO A DRY NO TASTE AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE"
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear amber with foamy, white head. Aroma is of caramel malt, citrusy and herbal hops, some fruit and spices. Body is medium and tangy. Fresh herbal hops dominate the palate with bready and caramel malts provide some balance. Finish is long and bitter. Very nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Psyched to see this one is out. One of my favorite fall seasonals. Looks the color of autumn. Don't get a huge smell but it could be my dry nostrils. Anyway, I love the taste of this ESB. It's definitely hop forward for an ESB, and that makes it stand out. It's not an IPA, but the hops and light malt flavor really work here. Getting an earthy flavor along with slight citrus hops. I'm loving Southern Tier's six packs lately."
"This is true to the ESB style, just a more hop forward representation - as is customary for American beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ample, amenable, friendly, tasty, and fat. This is a great ESB that you could sip all day and never tire of the immense flavor. Southern Tier has done a good thing here. You could have a few of these."

"A most excellent seasonal from Southern Tier."
""
"O - A fall seasonal favorite, excellent brew, though its shelf life is extremely short, found that out last year, so if you dont plan on drinking what you have of it fast, stick to a smaller quantity."

""
""
""

""
""

"Light copper. Nice hoppy nose. The flavor profile and body are a bit thin, however.  This is very sessionable but the key to an ESB for me is the mutual co-existence between the malt and hop flavors.  There is not enough of a malt backbone here to make me happy."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very odd beer for me. Not sure really what style to compare it to. There is a lot going on. Very complex beer."

"Southern Tier Harvest Ale ---3.5/5"
"Overall- A great ESB which will please hopheads, but is balanced an smooth. A well blended beer. I'd pick it up again."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a beer I would take to a fire on a cool evening and totally enjoyâ€¦the malt and hops balance each other very well creating a flavorful beer without being too robust and only for the microbrew loverâ€¦a good tasting, commercial beerâ€¦(3/5)"
""
"I rather enjoyed this beer, it was surprisingly light (for better or for worse, in this instance I actually preferred it light but I could see it being a put off) and pretty well balanced. This was a presumably slightly older bottle as ""Harvest"" is pretty out now but it was still good. Was surprised to see that this was an ESB for a Fall seasonal calling itself Harvest. Guess I missed that ""Special Ale"" above."
""
""
"An easy drinking beer as a wind-down from a day of work. This one is just right for a cool, wet autumn evening."
"This is definitely a quality beer, but the powerful and distinct flavor is ALMOST too much for my pallet. The flavor doesnâ€™t seem quite in line with what I would expect from the name. Rather than being a fall/seasonal beer, it has more of a spring or summer vibe. It is quite refreshing which would make it a great beer for a warm summer night. That said, I bought a six pack and took weeks to get through it because it just wasnâ€™t something I wanted to taste regularly. Skirts the novelty realm a little too closely to make it something I would want to revisit often, but it is definitely worth picking up a bottle."
""
""
"Overall- The cloying smoke flavor is not for me, but it is an average to above average beer depending on how much you like some smoke in your beer."
""

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 7/17/2012. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with excellent retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, grass, and light herbal spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, pine, floral, grass, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, pine, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor complexity and balance; with a great malt/hop bitterness balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent ESB! Great malt/hop flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink for the ABV level. Definitely one of the best ESBs I have had. Highly enjoyable offering."
""
""
"i reckon this is far better on tap than in the bottle, but nevertheless, it pours a mostly clear pumpkin ale color with a khaki head thick as hell and about an inch tall. the nose is a little bland, maybe my bottle is a little older than is optimal, but it smells like wheat and pale malt, with fresh hops on the floral side. the flavor is a little sweet, caramely from the malt but still a little bitter and fruity from some generous hop additions. a little light on the carbonation i thought, but with a nice round medium body and a smooth feel from start to finish. this is a highly drinkable fall beer, despite its higer abv, id gladly down a 6er. its somehow filling and refreshing at the same time, everything a fall beer should be, and nothing that it shouldnt. much prefered on tap though."
""
""
""
""
"O- this one had some great balance and was very drinkable, just solid overall"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- No complaints here, this is a good one. Subtle differences make this a distinct ESB for me."
""
""
""
"Overall: This one is really easy to drink. The balance between the malt and hops is very well done. I'd definitely have more in the future."

"O: Goes down easy, tasty, somewhat filling, nice kick, ok representation of style. I could easily enjoy a few pints of this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice off-twist on a seasonal beer, was expecting this to be a brown ale or pumpkin type, but definitely comes off like an IPA. During a season of pumpkin beers, this fall IPA takes the cake as innovators of its class!"
""
""
""
"O: An clearly American take on the ESB while staying fairly true to style. A bit more malt flavor would be needed for the style but I don't care I like it just the way it is."
""
"A tarnished gold body with very little white, bubbly head. Not a whole lot of retention or lacing, and somewhat uninteresting. Aroma is of earthen hops (even a few months out), caramel malt, and a hint of allspice. Some other muddled grain and a bit of lemon citrus in there as well. Tastes of lemon, orange, a bit of corriander, caramel, cardamom, allspice, wheat, and some earthen hops. Theres a strange, almost gritty bitterness to it that resembles unintegrated spices more than alpha acids. Mouthfeel is relatively crisp and finishes clean save for some lingering flavors (mostly the cardamom). Overall, a decent beer that's refreshing enough. I'd drink more of it, but wouldn't exactly seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"D: diverse flavors and aromas makes this pretty enjoyable. nice to have a fall seasonal that isnt an oktoberfest. the hop presence is significant, as is the malt diversity."
""
""
""
"This is a very good, hoppy, sessionable brew here. A perfect brew to have on a fall evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, this is a well-brewed beer, but it's not an ESB. It's more like an IPA for all practical purposes. Quite a bit different than what I was expecting. Not good enough for me to buy again."
""
""
""
""
"The body was crisp and smooth with the hops lingering on the back for bit. Drinkability was good, you could too easily drink several of these. Overall, a pretty good brew, certainly worth trying if you see it."
"This beer is a clear golden color with a white-ish head. It's a malty, lightly hopped smell, with some fresh earth, grain, and fruit (peach and apricot, maybe). The taste is very well balanced. Some toasted sweetness in the front, followed by a hop bitterness...some herbal flavors. Interesting beer, very drinkable and full in flavor."
""
"The appearance is an amber color with very little head.The aroma precedes the taste with a bunch of dark hops and maltiness. After that, the dark bitter hops won't quit. This is an amazing value - such a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid good beer for a harvest ale. The hops taste so fresh and crisp and the malted barley seems like it just came from the malt house too. Happy to have picked up this single at the store the other day."
""
"An enjoyable beer, a bit hop-forward for the style, but still well balanced overall."

"Overall â€“ Really not the best ESB out there, but not bad either. It has a decent flavor profile with some nice flavors. It is well worth a try if you have the chance."
""
"I was getting a bit tired of Marzens this fall, and Harvest provides a really nice alternative for the season. Another good one from Southern Tier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste has some pine hop flavors with herbs and slight grassy tinges with a light dried fruit element from the yeast. The malt flavor is mostly dry with slight toastiness you may expect in a pale beer with some nice caramel accents and the hops become citrus as the finish arrives with some light lemon and possibly a hint of grapefruit. The malt and yeast anchor the beer with some very gentle pear and pine returns in the hop flavor as it warms. The overall take is a good Pale ale or ESB as it is listed here with plenty of drinkability a very quaffable brew to my taste."
""
""
"Overall, a good seasonal beer that really comes across as different than most you might get in the fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good mix of decently balanced flavors that come together for a good autumn taste. I found hints of a pumpkin ale, slighter hints of an IPA, and even a brown ale. Interesting profile, even if it might be a bit all over the place. For me, it's not quite there but it's close."
""
"O - I really like this as a fall beer, especially as a more simple alternative to a pumpkin ale or similar spiced beer. Crisp and refreshing, nice flavor and smell. Has a little too much of a leaning towards an IPA though. Another good beer from Southern Tier."
""
"O: This beer is very enjoyable and is very easy to drink - slightly too strong to be sessionable but from a taste/smell perspective I want to have several of these. For some reason, this seems like a great beer for an early fall cool evening."
""
"Very loose foam, rises quickly to around a finger and falls back just the same, very little retention, off-white color, close to no lacing as well. The liquid is crystal clear and sparkles like freshly cleaned glass, for as fast as the head rises, close to zero visible bubbles inside the glass, light amber orange in hue. The nose features orange peel, ginger root, scones and baked bread, hoppy in an herbaceous way, not much sweetness here, black tea leaves, more metallic than earthy. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation is average at best, while clean thereâ€™s little life and spring to its step. Malty with cocoa, coffee bean, toffee accents, the orange to lemon citrus noticeable, more pine here as well as peach, apricot, cherry fruit. About half and half grains versus full-on bread, lacks honey or bread glaze. Finishes with an increase in florality and blanched nuttiness, that metallic edge about as close to bitter as it gets. Flat mouth presence contributes to its inability to interest you. Still, no real annoying flaws just the absence of any superlative element."
""
"O- Wonderful beer that is the last ESB/IPA summer season. Perfect beer to sit on the back porch watching the leaves turn colors and enjoy some last rays of light before winter gets in full swing."
"This beer really does remind me of fall. The subtle smokiness along with the aroma given off by the hops is kind of like autumn in a glass. A really wonderful seasonal beer and one I would really like to have again."
""
"Harvest is a bit more bitter than expected, which I like. Toffee coats the palate with brown sugar and a kind of pine-like mixed with herbs aftertaste. Medium carbonation and body bring this one home and make it smooth and very drinkable. I kinda wish I bought more than one bottle."
"O - This is a nice hoppy beer that is pleasant but it does not go out the way to impress me. It is definitely worth a try but will not be one I seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Small head quickly dissipates with minimal lacing. Golden amber color. Beer has a nice earthy taste to it with some hopiness reminiscent of a pale ale. Definitely a different option from many of the other fall beers available. In my opinion a good fall option for fans of ESBs and pale ales."
""
""
""
"I enjoyed the hop flavor in this beer - I thought the pine and woody and earthy characteristics blended very well together. Bit too bitter for me though and wish their was more malt backbone."
""
"A very drinkable and refreshing bitter!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good bitter, and a reminder that it's a great style to drink in the fall. 4.0"
"O - Decent, and an interesting fall seasonal. But I would take Pumking over this anytime. This is a decent pub beer on a cool autumn night."
""
""
"O- A tasty and well rounded beer. Definitely one to keep on my seasonal radar."
""
"O: This is a fantastic autumn ale to break up my pumpkin and oktoberfest binge. Definitely on the verge of being an IPA, but who cares about the style if it's a good beer?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a well balanced beer that can surprise you when you notice a different taste hiding amongst the others."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was the fresh aroma. The hops were beautiful and the malts crisp and unique. This showed great complexity, preparing us for a lighter beer than what was delivered. It was pretty heavy, and appropriate for an autumn evening, but certainly not after a hearty meal, as you might be too full to move."

"I don't expect a powerhouse of flavor with this style. All I look for is balance and this beer definitely has that. It is a good example of the style, though I probably wouldn't buy it again simply because ESBs are not a style I enjoy regularly."

"O - Great brew! Going to session this during Week 1 of the 2012 NFL season! In fact, I'm ready for another..."

"O â€“ This is a really tasty beer. It has a nice malt and hop profile that is suited for a fall day â€“ earthy and floral aromas and flavors rather than tons of tropical fruits. I think the apple esters also add a nice touch to the flavor. Another drinkable and tasty brew from Southern Tier."

"Flavorful pale ale at a pretty reasonable price. Will get again!"

"When poured into a pint glass, it has a nice amber color body with a small 1"" white head that layed down quickly to a thin lace. The smell has some pine notes. The taste has a nice pine/hop taste up front then finishes with a bitter taste. The hop and the malt are well balanced in this one. This has a great mouth feel, and overall is pretty good beer. Very nice fall beer."

"355ml bottle. Â½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on aprÂ´12. Deep golden color & crystal clear appearance. White, small bubbled, froth. Head texture is close with good retention. Caramel malts, fruits â€“ apricots-, slightly piney & floral aromas to the nose. Sweet malty upfront. Dry bitterness & resins linger into the finish. Medium body, soft carbonation. Gentle astringency. Easy drinkability."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal glass. Pours a medium orange amber. Thin fine off-white head dissipated rather quickly leaving a ring around the glass and a hint of lacing. Aroma of citrus hops and light sweet malt. Flavor is citrus hops and sweet malt. Slight nut and slight wheat elements, Finishes hoppy with nice neutral malt support. This is a hop forward ESB that approaches a IPA. Somewhat muted for an IPA, but liked this quite a bit as a ESB. Light to medium bodied. Interesting domestic variant on the style."

"Funny, this one pleases on every level although falls behind just a couple steps where Southern Tier usually excels: taste. Just a little too one-dimensional. And who the hell called this an ESB? Someone at Southern Tier? Really? Do I need to crawl to their website to find out? Nah, I won't bother, but it's not an ESB even though it's bitter. But quite good for what it is, whatever it is. (Somewhere between an American west coast amber and pale ale hybrid? Far away from England, that's for sure.)"
"The beer had a medium feel, it was smooth and the beer seemed a bit under carbonated, but I suppose that is more typical of the style. Overall, a pretty good beer."

"Had a decent bitter taste. Not overly bitter but a nice balance of grassy, floral hops with a bit of caramel, pale biscuity malts to help add a little bit of sweetness on the palate. I actually really enjoyed this beer. Smooth, drinkable, Medium carbonation. Dry finish. A nice hoppier/bitter offering as opposed to most other Autumn beers."
""
"Overall: Subtle flavours and good balance make this brew tasty and smooth. A solid American recreation of an often overlooked British classic."
"Drink- Tasty, but not wowing! I like this in 12oz format. Easy drinking and flavorful. 6.7% is well hidden making a potent beer but smooth none the less."
"Overall a very drinkable beer that goes down fast. Not a lot going on, it's a pretty simple brew. That said, what is there is done well. If you're looking for a straight forward, no-frills ESB, then you will enjoy this beer. But in my opinion, it is not really up to the standard I've come to expect from Southern Tier."
"Not much experienice in tasting ESBs but found this brew to be pretty nice. Better than some of the pumpkin flavoured harvest beers that seem to fall off the shelf this time of year. Disappointed I only purchase a single bottle."
"I recommend this beer for the style."
"A Nice alternative to the myriad of fall browns and pumpkins. a clear pale orange with a white head that fades to a thin covering and light lacing. Smell is rich with bready malt, light fruitiness and and earthy hoppiness. Taste is smooth and full of bread and toasted grains. Finish is clean and dry with crisp hops that yield a bit of grapefruit and mild brown bread. Not overly hopped and well balanced. As it warms the flavors get bigger and the malt blossoms. Feel is a light crisp signature with a smooth carbonation and medium weight. A nice fall beer with wonderful drinkability and character."
"O-Dissapointing."
"Southern Tier makes another good beer."
"D: Not sure if Southern Tier changed the recipe on this, but the bottle I had was grossly unbalanced. They have plenty of better beers to choose from in my opinion."
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a light carbonation and some alcohol sizzle. Easy to drink despite the ABV (for an ESB)."
"Overall: A very interesting and tasty brew. Starts like a traditional English Bitter and finishes like an American IPA. It almost is like a Mimosa with a IPA replacing the champagne."
"Not bad at all. Quite enjoyable. I'd had this before in a bottle but it must not have been as fresh as this because a fresh hop aroma really shined in the draft version."
"Not bad, missing that depth in ESB's and a bit too hoppy, but not bad."
"Overall, this is one of the best US-style ESBs that Iâ€™ve sampled. While it's not quite up there with Lord Admiral Nelson, it's certainly comparable to Goose Island Harvest Ale, Charlevoix Vache Folle ESB, and Câ€™est What? Alâ€™s Cask Ale. A fantastic drinker."
"O: Not bad, very unique for sure. I could drink this again, just nothing TOO special."
"Overall, an easy drinking, good tasting, balanced beer."
"Pretty tasty. I wouldn't say it's as outstanding as others from Southern Tier like Pumking and Creme Brulee Stout, though"
"O: a nice drinking beer, alcohol hardly noticeable. Nothing stands out here especially, and here this is a strength."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This beer is a bit more hoppy on-tap and I like it just a bit better than this year's bottles. Very nice."
"Pours a darker orange with yellow highlights and a small off white head. Smell is mostly citrus hops and sweet notes, some malty tones in there as well. Taste starts with the hops up front the malt comes through in the middle and a semi sweet citrus comes in at the end with the hops lingering in the aftertaste. Not much bitter going on, but nice flavor overall. A nice medium body, good carbonation, always nice to get one fresh off the tap. Overall a good beer, good flavor that won't overpower, could easily have a few of these in one sitting."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I'd drink it again. If I didn't have better options, I might even buy it again. There are almost always better options, though."
"O - Overall, a decent beer, but could use more in the taste department other than the bitterness."
"Unique and great, makes me think of a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale combined with an Oktoberfest."
"O: for what it is, this beer is one of my favorites, great balance of malt and hops. If this was a year round beer, it would be in my fridge all the time. Recommend picking it up of you haven't had it."
"O - a decent malty beer. Nothing to write home about, but worth a try."
"O: not a particularly interesting beer, and having one doesn't interest me in another. The abv doesn't come through, but the flavor doesn't at all justify the abv either. I expect a 6.7% beer to have a much more robust flavor."
"O - Very good beer. This is a beer I could see myself drinking a few of at a party or ballgame."
"It's partly the style, but I find this beer to be rather, well, meh. It's balanced, and it tastes fine, but nothing's jumping out at me. It's not super flavorful, or full of subtle complexity, or refreshing, or anything else."
"Overall, I think this is a decent beer, but one that I don't need to revisit. The flavor just didn't do a whole lot for me, but it wasn't bad by any means."
"Hoppy aroma brings to mind an American pale ale; not sure I understand the ESB classification here. Taste is Cascade-y hops with the requisite amount of sweetness from a Southern Tier beer. Carbonation was a little low for my liking. This is very drinkable and a refreshingly flavorful alternative to Oktoberfests. I'm sure it's even better fresh."
"O- not a bad beer. Nice and light with a great flavor. I would definitely purchase again."
"Taste follows nose: pale try malt balanced by some hop bitterness. Nice balance, and the water in this beer is a key ingredient too."
"Super drinkable beer. An excellent session beer for fall. I'd seriously have considered sticking with this for happy hour if there hadn't been so many other choices to try."
"O- this won't pass my favorite esb (beast bitter), however, this is way more unique. Seems like harvest is a ""mad scientist"" type brew with all the flavors going on. I will come back to this every single fall!"
"Very lively in the mouth the hops are forward, awake, fresh, alive. Taste buds dance with sweet and bitter orange, grapefruit, balanced by lively sweet - bitter floral taste. Taste fresh and lively like a fall harvest. Very interesting in the hops not being overly bitter, yet very prominent."
"Pours a pale, yellow amber with a slight white head. A citrus kick of an aroma. Lemon peel, orange and grapefruit. Hints of spicy hops too. Flavor begins with crisp, bitter kick of earthy and pine hops. Transforms into a sweeter citrus blend. A more traditional fall malt comes next. Mostly caramel and some toasted grain and then some spicy hops and a bit more citrus bring it home."
"Flavah!: Similar spice character of some marzens, but has an interesting tussle with the hops and loses. Decent malting balances well with inoffensive bitter hops- gives a wee bit of the toasty warmth I would expect from the nose, but I don't think it can compete with the hopping and carbonation . . . until it warms up, then the toasty comes through more, with a hint of caramel. Feels like an American Ale take on an Oktoberfest, which is what I think they were gong for."
"Pretty good fall seasonal offering, taking a different angle than most breweries."
"Overall: Not a true ""Fall"" beer, but a decent offering. Warming enough for the cooler months in fall, but the citrus was a bit overwhelming and kind of gave me sour stomach after two. If you want a true harvest-style beer, pass this one up. Better suited for the summer IMO. Cheers!"
"Not my favorite wet hop ale but still a solid offering that I try to knock back every year."
"O: Probably my favorite beer of the season. Absolutely easy to down with a wonderfully balanced taste and pleasant aroma."
"O: Easy drinker, tasty beer. A good seasonal beer. Another solid beer from Southern Tier."
"Pours a nice, bold gold. Very few carb trailers, but a whitish head rears back to a ring and sticks. Smell is a sweet, floral hop and good bread. Taste is very good - a good mixture of jagged hops with a nicely toasted malt backing. Effervescent & lively. Drinks well, a keeper. Very similar to GI's harvest offering."
"Decent head retention. Light hop aroma. Nice hop presence with just enough malt to balance. Light to medium in body. Smooth carbonation. Overall, not the best example of a 'harvest ale'. it is quite quaffable. Nice as a palate break in between darker maltier beers."
"Medium body and carbonation, sticky, a little chewy and drinkable. Solid fall beer which strikes a balance between the seasonal element and the style."
"The smell and taste are both decent but simple. It's a good representation for the style and an easy drinker."
"The Rest: A great interpretation of an ESB. The combination of a tradational English hop profile with a more assertive American profile is a nice take on the style. Quite tasty!"
"Overall: A very impressive Americanized ESB overall. Definitely one of the better ones around."
"Notes: Very nice seasonal surprise from ST, I should have picked up this one last year..."
"Overall - A decent bitter beer, but would like to see a more assertive malt presence."
"Transparent orange in body with bubbly white head. Smells of grains, corn, and slight honey. Tastes of grains, slight honey, sone malt sweetness, grass, and hop resin. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A pleasant autumn beer but a terrible aroma and cheap malt taste make for an average experience."
"A highly drinkable easy going brew. Nice sessionable brew - easily accessable for parties."
"Overall a very tasty beer that went down smooth, easy and is quite session-able. Not a fall or harvest beer in the typical sense, this breaks the mold and to me was a great surprise and extremely drinkable. Another nice product by Southern Tier which I recommend."
"Bottle. Poured a deep clear burnt orange. A small fizzy head did not hang around long, but good lacing on the glass. Aromas of green hops are dominating with some nice floral notes. A hint of sweet malt in the aroma as well. Taste is also hoppy but they taste more like noble hops. A grainy backbone asserts itself rapidly, battling with the hoppy bitterness. Almost no hint of the maltiness I detected on the nose. Instead a delicious spiciness adds a wonderful new element to this ESB. Texture is medium. Medium-high carbonation. Very lively on the tongue. Texture is somewhat oily. A wonderfully different beer. very tasty"
"Overall - a very smooth, drinkable beer - and a great fall seasonal. Southern Tier has another hit!"
"o - impressed. a nice, refreshing and very drinkable beer that i will be getting again. the southern tier beers have always impressed me with their interesting, big flavored beers coming with an affordable price tag. this is a nice and welcome change from the seasonal pumpkin ales"
"O-A decent fall beer but there seemed too much malt and not enough bitterness."
"This so much beer then one fall beer that is equal in style. Enjoy!"
"Easy to drink harvest ale, which is not the best ESB, but is worth a try."
"O-an interesting tasty ale for harvest time"
"drinkability: I really lie kthis beer and it was a pleasant suprise. not extreme, just well done."
"O: Good, easy to drink"
"Poured dark golden with some reddish hue and moderate head retention. Great lacing and carbonation that sticks around as a ring of foam around the pint glass. Agitating the brew kicks up a nice, creamy head and aromas of piney, floral and citrusy hops. Great malt backbone lends a toasty, biscuity flavor. Becomes a little boozey as it warms. ABV definitely detectable here. The hop profile follows through to the palate where piney and resiny flavors are present. Moderate bitterness in a finish that lingers for a good amount of time. Medium-full bodied; chewy for this style of beer. Carbonation is low and leaves the brew slick and syrupy. Drank more like a well-hoped pale ale rather than a bitter. Still a good, sturdy brew for celebrating the harvest season."
"O - A pretty decent harvest ale. Has some nice flavors and is a well balanced beer."
"D - Insanely quaffable... I was shocked to notice the 6.7% ABV... I could drink several in a sitting while enjoying each and every sip along the way... This is a quality offering from Southern Tier..."
" nice color, clear efferensence with good glass lacing. color a honeyed amber. The smell speaks hops- beer listed as an esb but description focuses on the hops and the hops I would say is the defining characteristic of this beer. Not an esb per say, but a hop forward ale. I really liked this beer. Great mouthfeel and a subtle complex flavor profile. The malt is there but the hops is the lingering taste, still does not dominate, like the balance and the body of this beer. I would agree, hoppy enought to satisfy and stand up to spicy(mexican) but with a deep enough body to speak of fall. First harvest of the season and a good one. 3rd favorite ST so far after Pumking and Chokolat."
"O: This is a good beer, I was impressed by it"
"First time having this one, and I enjoyed it. There's not much to complain about, enojoyable for the style, but the aromas take this one to another level, IMO. Recommended."
"O- another ""tweener"" beer from Southern Tier. I much prefer when they stay true to style (their IPA's, Stouts) than hop up an existing style. Good, but not great."
"Not really an ESB IMO but it's all good by me, hoppy pale ale with English malt is what im thinking. Glad I found this within a month of bottling as it's quite delicious and flavorful in it's own Southern Tier way without all the alcohol. I would do a sixer of this on a Sunday in a second."
"Hop intensity allows for an extended finish, and carrying only the most modest hint of caramel into aftertaste. A highly drinkable beer that whets the whistle on these hot autumn days, but satisfying for cooler nights as well."
"This is a nice alternative to the pumpkin and marzen soaked market that fall brings. It's definitely a hop heads fall beer."
"O - Pretty good, honestly wasn't expecting much with this but surprised"
"This is a great IPA...if that is what it were. Tastes great...off on style. Oh well...."
"Pours a clear copper orange with a 1 inch puffy bone colored head that settles to a thin cap. Very thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down in a very tight pattern. Smell is of fresh herbal and citrus zest hops with some caramel malt/biscuit notes. Taste is of herbal and citrus zest hops with a solid sweet malt backbone. Mild hop bitterness quickly fades after each sip. A lower level of carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good ESB from Southern Tier. I am glad I got to try this one."
"o: My bad for ordering this, I was hoping for a hopped to hell harvest ale. This wasn't bad, just more balanced the the name led me to believe."
"i expected a bit more out of this brew. there's no bottle date anywhere to be seen on the packaging, but it's relatively fresh. i've had better ESBs."
"Pours a solid clear, clean copper with a 2 finger head that fades to a 1/4 inch tight bubbled head. The smell has a buttery malt tone, bready, with a hint of spice, followed by a big piny hop presence, very floral. The taste has also has a buttery malt taste, buscuity, spice, floral hops, and ends on a bitter finish. The mouth feel is a light to medium feel, creamy and smooth going down, crisp and bitter going down. All in all this beer is great, lots of nice hop flavors with a solid malt back solid Bitter from ST."
"O: Was looking for a good fall seasonal and chose this because I was a big fan of Souther Tierâ€™s 2X IPA. Definitely not â€˜badâ€˜ by any means, however it left a little to be desired- just didnâ€™t have as much of the autumn tones and feel I was expecting. Would definitely recommend to a non-craft drinker, however."
"Overall - I thought it was a decent beer. There was nothing remarkable about it, but it felt like it was right on the verge of being a very good beer. But quite quaffable and refreshing"
"This beer poured a nice creamy head, kinda white, lasting a long time covering an orange-brown bright brew that looked so good. Kudos to the brewer for that head which holds out. Beautiful aroma big time hop fruit tropical citrus pine totally west coast so to speak. Flavor has a huge hop presence that easily stomps out the malt. Get more balance in the finish as some specialty malts bust through. Lots of hops went into making this beer. Ah, cool idea although it was different from what I usually look for in my autumn beer. Enjoying this anyway!"
"A bit early for a harvest ale. Supposed fresh English hops. Not likely. Nice fall look and color. Nose is the first give away that something is missing first taste confirms. Metallic pineapple juice finish. A decent beer. But not a stand out in the harvest category."
"Overall: Harvest Ale is an enjoyable, quaffable brew for early Sunday morning drinking."
"O: Would have loved to have this one fresh. I'll probably pick up more this coming fall. 4-5 of these in one sitting easy. Very easy to drink, not too hard on the wallet, good representative of the style, and easy to find."
"The Harvest ale pours out as a deep amber color with a yellowish colored head on top. The heads a little foamy and kind of leaves a little lacing. The smell of the beer is a little sweet and has a decent amount of caramel on the nose. Theres a little bit of hops in there too to counter the sweetness. The taste is also a little sweet but has a good backbone of malts and some spices also. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth and has a medium body. Overall it's a nice drinkable brew that I'd probably drink again."
"Overall a great beer. It is smooth and flavorful."
"From fall tasting notes (2010): Clear, amber body with a frothy, white head, rapidly diminishing. Aroma like a pale ale with light caramel and more hops than malts. Notes of resein, flowers, pine and bread. A hint of dough. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture and lively carbonation. Lingering bitterness in the finish. A little too heavy on the hops, but overall a good beer. Not for the seeker for autumn style however."
"Tasty, balanced, smooth and easy drinking. ST gets it done again!"
"D: I'd drink it again. It went down quite smoothly, and I kind of want another one already."
"Notes: Ho-hum version of the style from Southern Tier. In their defense, this style does not often inspire much from me."
"Southern Tier Brewing Company--HARVEST Seasonal Special Ale--Brewed with 4 Varieties of Hops and 2 Types of Malts--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.40% ABV. 35 IBU's? (3.5 / 5.0) Big foamy thin fizzy lacy off white head. Clear pretty thin bright copper amber color. Crisp toasted mild hop front. Thin textured light sweet toasted caramel biscuit fruit hint body. Clean crisp mild hop spice refreshing smooth slightly bland Harvest end. Sampled 12/4/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $9.99 @ Mr. J's Deli Mart on 12/4/2010."
"Drinkability -- Wow. Quite good. I'm a fan. I liken it to the pantheon of what I can AIPA's (Almost IPA's): the malt base is still where much of the flavor is derived, but the hop profile is noteworthy. Really good stuff. I'll be keeping an eye out for this next Fall."
"Pours an orange/amber with a small short lived head. Aroma of sweet malt, floral earthy hops, sweet spices. Taste of sweet caramel malts, some slight tones of grapefruit sweet spices and bitter hops. Palate is nice med body, good carbonation, smooth mouth feel. Finish is hoppy bitter hops, sweet malts, some grapefruit and other sweet spices, ends with some sweet bitter maltiness. Overall a very nice flavorfull, tasty and well balanced brew."
"D: The beer is extremely easy to drink and goes down very smoothly."
"D - Wow it seems that ST has got it right on this one. With a nice malt backing the hops it almost makes it as drinkable as 2XIPA but not as much since it is old. Will have to try next years fresh batch."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer- well-rounded hop and malt flavors and, while this one may lean more toward the hops, it has a unique flavor that doesn't smack you with bitterness."
"D: Very drinkable; this one really hits the spot... probably the hoppiest ESB I've ever had, though. But, good - I think I'd rank it as my favorite ST beer so far (up there with Unearthly as one of their most enjoyable, in my opinion)."
"D: A very balanced brew and easy enough to drink. Mouth was a just a tad over oily for my liking, but not bad. Thanks again Michael for sending me these!"
"D - I'm definitely a hop head and this has a great hop flavor without being overpowering. With the light body and moderate flavor i could drink a 6 pack easily."
"D - A solid esb."
"Pours a light amber with some copper highlights, and a fairly thin head. Smells somewhat grainy and a touch buttery. Some clean malt and some light earthy hops rounds it out. Tastes pretty similar, with buttery overtones and a firm malt and grain base. Somewhat savory as well, almost like salted caramel, but not all that sweet. Smooth, somewhat chewy, and with a nice salty sweet finish interlaced with some bitterness. I like it, and it seems appropriate for the fall."
"D: This is a pretty high octane ESB by any standard, but I certainly didn't detect any of that. Good stuff!"
"D: Very high. I sought out a case of this after enjoying a single, but all I could turn up was two six-packs..."
"This is a solid, easy-drinking brew that is well worth a try in the fall. It has some interesting hop flavors and you won't be disappointed. My only disappointment is that I didn't buy more."
"Overall-I enjoyed the beer, a different kind of ESB than I've had, a lot more fruit and spice character, but it pulls it off. Worth your time."
"This is an interesting fall seasonal. It's not my personal favourite, but I can't really see too much to fault with it. Give it a shot."
"A tasty, refreshing, and delicious ESB!"
"Fruity, citrus aroma with light grainy malt. Clear, bright, golden-yellow pour with a thick white head and some lacing. Light and fresh on the palate, Mellow and easy going, it's a real drinkable beer. Flavor of pine with With a mild bite. Fresh hop taste with a mild malt backbone. Sort of has a dry grassy/wheat quality as well. Another good one from Southern Tier, I have to admit, after my first tasting a few yrs. ago, RT has totally changed my mind. They really produce some World class brew."
"Pours a nice golden copper color with a white head and some good ringy lacing on the way down. The nose brings a good amount of hops forward with some earth, pine, and herbal notes coming through. Slight caramel and toffee in there as well. Hops take center stage in the flavor as well, though not to the extent that they had in the nose. Really nice body and carbonation well nice bitterness. Really smooth and a great fall beer."
"I wish I had more of this brew over the summer- lighter wheat beers are not my preferred style, but this fills the gap between those and a medium bodied IPA."
"Drinkability: Wow very surprised when I first researched this beer after drinking it a few nights ago. Goes down deliciously and effortlessly but is also delicious and not very offensive if you enjoy roasted, but sweet beers. I will drink this beer again if I can get a hold of it before fall is over. Cheers!"
"Thanks again, Joe..."
"Light side of medium bodied...really slides down with enjoyment. Similar to the Goose Harvest Ale but this has more flavor..."
"Drinkability is great. This is my favorite fall beer. It's got a lot of hop flavor but is way easier to drink a bunch of than most IPAs."
"Drinkability goes down a but with that lingering astringent bitterness and cotton mouth finish. Other than the finish it goes down smoothly and drinks pretty well."
"D- Overall, Southern Tier Harvest is a wonderful fall seasonal that is definitely worth a try. This comes out the right time of year because it is a perfect football beer. Recommended!"
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of pine resin, and fresh grapefruit. It is so fresh smelling it makes me feel as though I am actually in a forest of pine and grapefruit trees. The taste is similar in character, but not as strong as the aroma. There is also a hint of orange in the finish. Bitterness is well integrated. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that I would surely drink again."
"A real aggressive pour yielded about three inches of fluffy off-white head atop a clear honey colored brew. The smell is fantastic. There's a big pine hit followed by tropical fruits and a hint of caramel. Taste is really crisp and refreshing. I know this is a fall seasonal, but I'd love to have this in the dog days of summer. Citrus up front followed by a slightly sweet mango note and a lingering bitterness fused with pine. Little to no alcohol presence. All in all, I really liked the crisp feel and refreshing flavors despite the typical fall seasonal most expect. I'd like to see this around all the time."
"Pours a clear coppery amber with a fine-bubbled off-white head. Aroma is seriously hoppy with evergreen and yeasty hints. Hoppy flavor is evergreen but not too bitter and has hints of fruit and even coffee. Tingly, fizzy texture fairly dances on the tongue."
"This is my second ""harvest"" ale in the last few weeks - the other being from Goose Island. While I prefer the Goose Island ale, this is well worth trying."
"This one is well balanced for me. Yum"
"D - Decent American ESB, a lighter drinker that isn't overly exciting."
"D - At 6.4% it ain't quite session-able, but I can see myself (happily) trying anyway."
"The taste is delicious. It is a wonderful fall beer that keeps the hops at the forefront. This is not often done or at least I haven't found this happening often will the harvest beers. Mouth feel is definitely creamy and smooth. If I had more to drink I would drink a few more of these tonight. Very drinkable and will be bought again."
"Copper in color with an amber hue. Poured with excellent clarity and a strong white head that reduced to a thick white cap. Sweet biscuity malt and grapefruit hop aromas. Smooth buttery feel with healthy carbonation. Nice balance of light toasted malt and grapefruit/orange hop flavors with a grapfruit hop finish. wnet down smooth and quickly. Southern Tier never disappoints. IF you didn;t tell me this was an ESB I would have classified it as an APA. Either way, this quickly became one of my favorites."
"Drink well my friends."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and clean with an adequate amount of carbonation."
"D - Very nice, this ESB manages to hit all the right notes and it remains quite drinkable despite being a significantly stronger than average example of the style. Interestingly it has a somewhat American hop aroma, but the hops turn a bit more musty and British in the flavor. The malt character is well done as well; there is a huge note of toasted malt with just the right amount of sweetness to keep it form becoming burnt tasting and cloying in the finish as it has a tendency to do in some drier beers. I would happily recommend this beer and drink it again."
"Pours a clear light orange with quick fading white head, couple blobs of lace. Ha, this is an obnoxiously hoppy ESB, excellent. Smell: orange citrus, a hint of pineapple, leafy, a little nutty. Taste: citrus and earthy hops, toasty, toffee, lingering hoppy and toasted finish. Mouthfeel: carbonation is good but it thins out pretty fast. Hoppy with a musty, nutty note... works as a fall seasonal (aug rel.)"
"D - This is a wee bit about average ale. The mouth feel is really the only thing that suffers but at the same time it makes this category suffer slightly also."
"D-great, truly drinkable to the last drop and i drank it rather quickly. its gone now and i'm sad, i could drink a lot of these."
"Drink - Another above average beer by Southern Tier. Worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is good. A very pleasant experience (especially for a hophead)."
"Mostly clear; coppery and slightly amber color. Thinnish white head that sticks around. Refreshing, floral hops aroma - sweet-smelling with a bit of citrus. Roasted, slightly nutty malt aromas. Sweet caramel malt flavor, some roasted malt as well. Plenty of sweetness mixes well with floral hops. Medium bodied with a slightly-too crisp mouthfeel but refreshing nonetheless. Overall a nice, warming brew for the season."
"Overall this beer is very easy drinking and well balanced once it warms. I enjoyed drinking this and I would drink it again."
"D: this is something I could go with all night"
"Overall, a very nice offering from ST. Pretty drinkable. I really like the fruit flavors in this one."
"Poured this into a tulip. Slightly hazy amber body with a frothy off white head with nice sticky lacing. The smell is full of floral hops and is slightly citrusy. Mostly hops though with nice bitterness and a slight malt aroma kicking around the background. The taste is upfront with grassy hops and a bit of citrus. The finish is bitter and rather earthy. Good mouthfeel on this one. With a medium body and good carbonation I'll pick up more of these."
"D - A good ESP, in fact, one of my favorites of the style I'd say, it's a nice drinking fall beer that has good balance and a harmonious flavor profile."
"D= The drinkability is decent. I could drink a lot of them but I dunno how interested it would keep me. Good beer but a one and done for me."
"D- Wonderful. This is one of my favourite seasonal's. So much flavour it fits the time of year so perfectly. The perfect beer to have on the patio with a nice sweater on, a cool breeze in the air and the leaves all changed."
"D- its an interesting take on a harvest...would have liked more than the pine to come through, but oh well. Still a solid beer"
"This is a repeat performer, for sure -- flavor, not too big, & refreshing enough to come back for more. If I can wax poetic for a minute...It's great to see fall evoked in a different way from the pumpkin ales & Oktoberfests, both of which I also love. This brings to mind the crinkle of fallen leaves, the crispness of autumn evening air, the fading daylight. More of ""farewell to summer"" beer, I appreciate that this is reminiscent of the season actually changing. I'd like to say more, but I've gotta finish savoring this beer."
"Drink-This brew taste alot like Troegs Nugget Nectar I thought with a bitter and somewhat sweet delivery. Would not consider this to be a session beer due to the odd balance it has."
"m+d- soft on the tongue. basically an ""India Brown Ale"" not to infringe on anyones copyrights. Good beer, I'll gladly drink it tonight."
"Overall: From the appearance and aroma I expected good things. The taste and mouthfeel were a let down. I would drink again if offered but wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"Very good ESB and it works as a fall beer too. Nicely balanced with surprising complexity both in the hop and malt tastes."
"Fall nights are looking better already"
"D- Good drinkable beer, nothing super special but not bad."
"D- Nothing outstanding here but a good beer"
"D- This was a good harvest beer but one that is a little lower on my list. Good for what it is. Very drinkable that's for sure. Not much going for it I would say...although I've had a lot of harvest beers."
" D- This beer has a big spicy hop flavor that is supported by some interesting pale malt flavors. The green bean flavor is a bit odd. The hops and malt just don't seem to work together but on their own they are not bad."
"A great earthy heartiness to this beer. Floral aroma transcends into sweet backbone. Very good harvest ale, nice and hoppy."
"D - I shall look forward to this release for years to come. Damn nifty, if I do say so myself!"
"D: A solid, drinkable version of an ESB."
"This beer is great alternative to the more malty altbiers that are typically offered in the autumn, but one or two should suffice on a nice autumn afternoon."
"Highly drnikable, one of my favorites thus far this fall."
"Very good entry as an ESB: Lots of bitterness, good starting malt flavors. Spot on body but with a lower level of a carbonation. Long lasting aftertaste of peppery hop bitterness."
"As mentioned several times above, very light in its characteristics. Certainly more could have been done with this recipe. An unfortunately average offering from an otherwise excellent brewery."
"Great beer to drink, very pleasant flavors, nice body and just all around enjoyable. Tough to judge in the ESB category, but great in general."
"D - This is an interesting brew. Again, it tastes like an IPA but by the end it tastes like an ESB."
"This is a very good beer and a great effort by Southern Tier. I don't really know anything about this beer, I just saw it at Total Wine and figured I'd pick it up. It's extremely flavorful and a nice showcase for some tasty hops. Recommended."
"Overall a delicious surprise from an otherwise dull and uninviting style. ST - yet another great brew!"
"D: Good flavor with no alcohol noticeable. Pretty light on tongue, but refreshing."
"Overall I was impressed with this beer and this leads me to believe the bottle I had earlier was not all that fresh or the batch variations are quite large. Either way, this is definitely worth a shot if you see it on-tap or in the bottle near the release date, a very nice beer."
"Pours a clear copper with a small head that smells quite hoppy. Zesty aromas are stronger than the toasty malt aromas, but the taste is more balanced. Citrusy and earthy hops dominate the front palate and finish, but toasty and lightly sweet malts shine through on the middle and make the overall experience much rounder. A pleasantly bold seasonal."
"Prost!!!"
"M/D: Carbonation is slightly prickly, medium bodied. Drinkability is very good. A very balanced beer, very easy to drink."
"Pours a clear, copper color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and slight lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, hops, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of an Extra Special / Strong Bitter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, slight yeast, and a hint of spice. Overall, decent aroma, body, and blend."
"- Overall this is a killer brew... a fresh hop brew? Or just a killer amber with some bad ass hops? I don't know... but it is full of hop flavors... and I like them."
"Edit: I just came across some notes from a previous tasting (likely last fall), and had very similar comments. However my scores were a little lower A-3-3.5, S-4, T-3.5, M-3.5, D-3.5-4"
"D - 6.4% isn't all that high, but I wouldn't have guessed it. I would love to have this beer around all the time. Easy drinking and flat out delicious. My favorite beer from Southern Tier. If you can find this while it's in season, don't pass it up."
"D-I can see this being very drinkable, not my favorite style, but not bad either"
"This is surprisingly drinkable, I have to say, even for someone who doesn't particularly care for hops. Thanks to the balanced taste and pleasing mouthfeel, my first ESB experience was an enjoyable one. Might actually have to give some more of these a shot!"
"Mouthfeel is generously carbonated and light-bodied, with the drinkability being deservingly high. Basically, this beer is not as bitter as one might expect and fulfills the flavor responsibility quite nicely. Bravo Southern Tier!"
"M & D - Nice and light-medium body with a good tasty and spicy mouthfeel that is very appropriate for the season yet not bad for warmer hours of the day. Drinkability is very high. Delicious."
"T - I was expecting more ""Harvest"" taste from this, whatever that means, but overall it's a pleasant beer. Balanced hops with some roasted malt undertone, it's certainly appropriate for fall weather. Not getting the spices on the tongue that I was able to smell."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: session-ing is possible, very good overall."
"an drinking easy drinking ESB."
"A very golden color with a sexy pure white head. Smells likes autumn, I feel like I'm stepping out of my warm apartment into the crisp October morning air. Very up front hoppy taste which gives way to a more traditional ocktoberfest brew with a hint of spice. Very thick when swooshing it around the mouth, but I think I could drink quite a few of these."
"A solid contender for the style, definatly fit my hop needs well and is balanced to boot."
"Pale and hazy golden. Light and fluffy white head. Lacing is pretty full. Cascade like grapefruit aroma mixed in with some light toffeeish malt. Firm malt base of toffee and caramel. Bright and exuberant hop flavor. Resiny and spicy and a little of that garlic/onion character. Medium bodied at best and creamy. Solid beer."
"drinks well. a bit too strong ABV-wise to have many in a sitting, but I want to."
"Tastes like a good harvest this year."
"A really nice option when you want something with lots of hops without the serving being too heavy. There's a refreshing quality to Southern Tier's Harvest Ale. It's a bit of a shame that this isn't available year round but it's something to look forward to at the end of summer. It's also a nice reminder that Pumking is just around the corner! Mmmmm...Pumking."
"I needed another bottle to finish my mixed sixer at Rick's, so I picked this guy. Exciting, I know. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, cotton, flowers, and buttery biscuits. The taste holds notes of banana, orange peel, hoppy bitterness, and wheat. The body is light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a solid offering, one to grab again if I ever need to finish another mixed sixer."
"D: easy drinking, could throw back a few of these."
"D: Incredibly high. Thought I might get sick of it, but it's a delicious beer with an ABV below 7%."
"Great beer, a must try."
"Taste: More pine and resiny flavors coming through than I got in the smell. Still pretty fruity. I expected higher bitterness. Bitterness seems kinda mild."
"Highly drinakable. A great refreshing hoppy harvest brew. A great hoppy yet balanced APA/ESB."
"D - a pleasure to drink. excellent. 4.5"
"Overall, I've had better from Southern Tier. Maybe I had a bad batch (or the guys at Mugs use dish soap to clean their glasses!) or maybe ESB is just not their thing."
"My sister sent me some Harvest from my hometown brewery. Clear golden yellow pour with a nice thick white head and great lacing. Really big nose for an ESB. Lots of pine, grapefruit and grass with just a touch of bread dough. Taste is quite like the nose, with lots of bitterness from the hops to nicely compliment the biscuity malt. Fruitier than most ESB's with a hint of tea also. Nice dry finish and a mouthfeel that reminds me of a cask ale. A very unique and drinkable ESB."
"Brilliant glimmering golden, white head fizzes a bit but settles nicely,a ring and some stringy horizontal strands of lace appear with a wispy centre. Nose is sweet tangerine, mango, peach, tropical fruit marmalade. The big smell is impressive - wow! Taste is citrus rind with big hoppy first impressions, bold yet very drinkable. This tastes like a stone fruit orchard passed through it, with a dash of spice. Mouthfeel is sharp, earthy malty edges, bitter aftertaste is dry. Very pleasant interesting presentation but again there's a spicy backdrop I'm getting that I can't quite put my finger on, not quite nutmeg or cinammon but moving in that direction. Another fine brew from Southern Tier, you really can't go wrong with this brewery."
"Picked up as a single in WI. Pours a pale, clear golden color with two inches of white head that had good retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. I have noticed that most of these harvest ales are very pale and this one is no exception. Nice hoppy aroma of pine, grass, and citrus. A touch of graininess as well. The flavor is likewise hopcentric. Bitterness is a bit high for an ESB, I would put it at APA levels. There is a bit of bready malt that helps balance the pine and citrus flavors. Nice smooth body and carbonation. Nicely compliments the flavors in this beer. I would consider this one of my favorites when it comes to these harvest ales. Slightly more balanced and drinkable."
"As mentioned several times above, very light in its characteristics. Certainly more could have been done with this recipe. An unfortunately average offering from an otherwise excellent brewery."
"Pours a light pale straw color with no carbonation activity after the pour. I am not getting any head or cling to the glass after the pour. I am getting subtle alcohols notes in the smell. There is a good hoppy bitterness that is backed by a citrus, orange maybe, note to finish. It has a nice mouthfeel if you like the bitterness that is associated with ESB's. Overall an average beer, probably something I wouldn't get again but it was nice to have an opportunity to drink it. Received this as an extra from billab914 and I am thankful to try any Sothern Tier offerings."
"12oz bottle poured into a dogfish pint glass, the weird shaped one with the truck on it from the midwest destruction tour last summer. 1/2"" white head settles down to a tight ring of suds, leaving no lace. Bright rich golden color, very clear, with a scattering of lazy bubbles rising. The aroma is a bit mild, fresh hops and a light orangey citrus, no real malt character coming through. The taste hits me with tangerine hops, lightly sweet, kinda reminds me of those little orange bubble gums that came in those mini juice cartons. Good sturdy bitterness to balance out the sweetness. The alcohol is actually a little noticeable, which isn't the best quality in a smaller session beer... Finishes with a good juicy bitterness and a faintly grainy toastiness. Mouthfeel is nice and clean, with a deep lingering bitterness. This beer drinks nice and easy, a little shallow though. 9.99 a sixer is a dollar fifty high, but whatev."
"Drinkability- Off the hook. This is a super tasty 'fresh hop' or 'wet hop' and done really well. It's not brashly bitter but it has a nice fruity hoppiness that is really tasty. I feel that a lot of ST's beers have taken a turn for the worse lately but this one is still good (or got better maybe, this is my first time trying this). Thanks much Adam!"
"Pours a light gold color with a modest amount of head. Good clarity and overall a very nice looking beer. Hop aroma is fantastic, I love the smell of this beer. A lot of sweet citrus aroma that is very appealing. Taste is also very good, lots of sweet citrus hops up front with some bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly creamy finish. Very drinkable, I could drink this beer all night."
"I'd like to try a bottle of this that isn't compromised by a carbonation bomb; I think I could get a better handle on it. Still, there's enough here to let me know that this is a beer I'd have again. Recommend."
"An excellent session beer, without having to sacrifice flavor. Reminds me a little of their Hop Sun. This one took me by surprise, I'm a fan."
"poured way to light it was a pale yellow color like a pils with a small white head it all dissipated and left just a flat yellow liquid in the glass ..not impressed the smell was faint in all areas faint hops and malt no real aroma here just plain..the taste was more of the same not a strong or bitter brew not hoppy or malty pretty much tasted like a budwieser ..just awful..do not recommend this one at all"
"Poured this one into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Comes out a very pale yellow gold color with a slight haze to it. I was actually really dissapointed on first glance till I took a 2nd look at it. There was a really thick frothy head to it with lots of different sized bubbles, almost a creamy frothy look. A good chunk of the froth goes away about a fourth of the way through the drink and a ring stays on the edges with a skim of froth across the surface. You get a little bit of lacing that sticks in small patches all over the glass. You can also see in the haze what looks like citrus zest floating around all over. The smell is great. Hops dominate the smell here. Primarily citrus hops smell, dry hopped, much like the famous ""hazed and infused"" by Boulder. The taste is also phenomenal. Still pleasantly hoppy with again primary citrus hops. Likely some pine hops but I'm thinking mostly citrus dry hops. The malts are clearly present, but the taste is dominated by the hops. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I expected, it strikes me more like an IPA than an ESB, it has some bitter bite to it from the hops, but all in all pretty darn good. This one extremely drinkable beer, willing to go with flawless for drinkablity. Very little to pick on about this beer, maybe it could have been a little maltier and heavier but overall it's a pretty well thought out brew. This could easily be a year round beer. I like Southern Tier going hoppy for their fall seasonal, good idea on their part."
"Na Zdravje!"
"When I poured this beer I was a little disappointed, I expected more. The head was almost nonexistant and the color as very light -- almost orange. I really expected something more golden with a more pronounced head. With that said, it does leave a nice lacing in the glass. The aromoa is very pleasing and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste, and after all that is really what's most important. The taste of hops really came through and the finish very pleasant. This beer is easy to drink and I am looking forward to drinking another tomorrow with the fried turkey dinner I am preparing."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is a lot bigger than the color suggests. Carbonation is nice and light. This is made to be a sessionable beer, and I drank both of my bottles consecutively. I wish there was a bit less bitterness, as that would really put this beer over the top."
"Feel and Drinkabilty: Light on the palate with lower levels of carbonation. This is one incredibly drinkable beer. Not sure of the alochol here, but I feel that this one would make a good session. This almost drinks like an American macro, its that easy to drink, its much tastier and all the more drinkable than that swill. The carbonation isn't obnoxious as in BMC brews. This is a nice beer to just sit back and enjoy or have with food, or just to session. Light and refreshing, can't beat that."
"Pours a clear gold color with a thin off white head with lots of little bubbles rising up the glass. Very floral and citrus hop aromas. Flavors of sweet citrus-grapefruit and orange- honey and apricot with a lemon rind bitterness in the finish. Medium carbonation and body, a clean, crisp and dry beer."
"Overall- one of the best harvest's i've ever had. suprised it's not a marzan but for an ESB and specially hopped pretty good. definitely worth a try. if you can get this grab it before it runs out."
"Overall - Very enjoyable, flavorful beer. I could drink this one quite steadily."
"D - This is definitely a late summer early fall beer...I wouldn't label it as an ESB but rather a pale ale almost...anyways...a very easy drinking beer that favors the hops and has a dash of sweetness"
"D - drinkable, but not that fun to drink. Too low in body, makes me feel like I'm drinking water or Budweiser."
"Overall, I was thoroughly impressed, and will have this again."
"This beer just feels so good, with a creamy texture and inoffensive carbonation, the hop is the highlight of the beer, but the bitterness is kept in check. An amazing beer, that I would not hesitate to drink again!"
"D: A really good APA and a decent value with a bright, spicy hops flavor."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a pale, clear amber with a stciky white head. The aroma is full of citrus and pine. The taste follows, more heavy on pine, the finish is slightly bitter and lingers. The brew is medium bodied, decent carbonation and oh so drinkable. The beer has the aroma of a DIPA and it taste like a bigger beer. IMO a real good harvest style beer."
"Mini growler pour from DeCicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours glowing golden lighter amber. Clear in the glass under a frothy off white nose that stays around and leaves a thick collar and copious spotted lace. Bright citrus nose, highlighted by notes of oranges. Nice looking and smelling brew. Healthily hopped with citrus infused hops. Flavorful and quite tasty ale, bright hop notes supported and balanced by a more then ample malt under caraige.. More high quality and well worth trying beer from NY states S.T."
"2"" dense white head with long lasting retention sits on a glodan beer with great clarity. Plenty of fresh lace down the sides of the glass. Very nice, soft aroma. Very balanced between light, citrusy hops and a nose full of caramel and toasty grain. More of the same in the flavor - citrus hops, some pine flavor - and a very nice light malt backing. Medium bodied, soft mouthfeel with a decent amount of carbonation. This beer is hitting me just right at the moment - it is delicious - I could drink this all day. Great job."
"I normally prefer a heavier mouthfeel, but this light mouthfeel suits me just fine. Drinkability is as good as it gets. I've had 2 six packs and a few bar pints of this in the past month, which is probably more of any single beer in a month period than any other beer over the past 10 years."
"Not a bad beer - just not what I expected it to be. I'd like a little more out of my beer on a chilly fall evening."
"Pervasive hop taste throughout mixed with mild sweetness. Bitterness lingers long after the finish. Modestly carbonated in the mouth. Taste is good, but the close if difficult, making this not quite as drinkable as other ESBs out there - for example a Red Hook. But a well made beer."
"overall a great refreshing session beer, not overly complicated but well done."
"D- A nice take on the style and this drinks really nicely. I am beginning to notice that I enjoy Southern Tier's more basic offerings over their Imperial Series."
"It's a decent beer, but with less of a malt backbone than I like in an ESB."
"If Southern Tier wants us to understand one thing about themselves it's that they can brew fantastic beers tremendously well. Apart from a couple lackluster offerings in their year-round lineup - which is to be expected - this brewery is responsible for a number of my favourite stouts and hop bombs. If they keep slugging out more of these first-rate ales I'm going to be needing more fingers (and maybe toes) to count all of my favourites on."
"D: A much lighter beer than I was expecting. I am even more surprised to see this one listed as an ESB given how light it is. Never the less for being on the lighter side, this beer does have a good bit of flavor, but is not overly aggressive. An easy drinker and a good session beer."
"Very tasty for a lighter ale. I was expecting a more spicy taste like the other fall styles. A pleasant, hoppy ale for autumn."
"Mouthfeel is a little watery upfront, finishes crisp and tingly. Tasty beer, pretty drinkable. Not quite on the style."
"I had to go back and change everything about this review. I don't know why I didn't like this one the first time around. Bad bottle? Bad timing? Bad food pairing? Who knows. I LOVED this beer tonight, and I really enjoy ESB's in general as a food/session beer. This is a winner for sure."
"Drinkable..flavor profiles balance well, mouthfeel is good."
"D - this is a pretty solid ale. I was very impressed at first, but found that as it continued to warm some weird flavors came out (the cookie-tasting malts). However, the hops are more bold in their presence than their malt counterparts. Good beer - I would definitely purchase again."
"Very nice for the style and easy to drink on a cold fall day. Certainly worth a try."
"Certainly a pleasure to drink, this would make a perfect beer to sip on while sitting outside and watching the leaves fall, and with the hot Georgia summer lingering well into autumn, it is a great thirst-quencher as well. A great beer to straddle the seasons."
"D - This is one flavorful Harvest Ale, especially fresh on tap. It also produced some tasty hop burps. One of the best of its kind for sure."
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability: Great drinkability thanks to the 5.7 percent ABV."
"Moderate abv and good taste makes this brew very drinkable."
"mouthfeel is medium bodied,very easy drinking.really nice fall release that strays from the pumpkin ale/oktoberfest norm."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with a wispy pure white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of nice juicy hops, nice citrus profile, very fresh aroma. Pretty much all hops. The taste is more of the same. A good grapefruit citrus hop flavor, some lemon and pine, and a barely noticable malt body however it does a good job balancing out the hops. The brew has a moderate feel, tingly carbonation and only finishes slightly bitter which is surprising considering all of the hop flavor. This is a very enjoyable brew, probably a bit hoppy for the style but it works well. Recommended."
"This beer is a little one noted for my taste. It lacks some complexity. It would make for a very nice session beer."
"If I had to describe this beer in one word it would be ""bright."" That may make you think it is light on flavor but that would be far from the truth. This will sound silly but the mouthfeel on this just makes you happy. There are strong hop flavors but they are balanced out by a crisp, clean flavor that makes this a superior beer. Once you drink it you will know exactly what I mean. Try it for sure."
"edit: upon reading other's reviews, I must say I'm a bit confused - but I stick to my review (it's the last of a sixer, and all have tasted the same, so no palette-problems on this one). I'll have to check this out again sometime to see if it's the batch or if my taste buds really are that different from others!"
"This is an excellent beer. It is super citrusy hoppy. It is slightly cloudy. It has a great hop aroma. It has a nice 2 finger head with nice lacing. It is nice and sweet to balance the hoppy overtones. This is a wonderful beer for any hop head. It focuses on my favorite aspect of the hop,flavor and aroma. If you come across this beer, pick it up."
"Taste: In spite of what you saw and smelled, this beer has an awesome balance. It's wicked hoppy but not over the top. I want to make this."
"A damn nice beer from Southern Tier, but it's sure an interesting take on an ESB. Styles be damned though, this is a nice beer and worth trying for sure."
"Drinkability: Really high. I've been looking for a good ESB to replace a discontinued favorite, and this one could be a decent stand-in. It is bright, refreshing and flavorfully balanced. I really enjoy Southern Tier's seasonals, and this is great transition from Hop Sun in the summer to the fall."
"I would 100% recommend this to anyone, even non-hopheads."
"I think my first words were, ""Oh, man that's good!"" This is one crazy drinkable beer. I could easily have three without blinking. I have no idea where they get off classifying it as an ESB, because it's nothing like any ESB I've ever had. It's more like a pale ale or even IPA. The hops are so floral and citrusy- a nice hint of clementine. But there's also this sweetness that is what makes it so drinkable. It is in no way overpowering, but it's what makes it a bit harder to categorize. I'm not sure if they changed the recipe from last year, but judging by the comments, it seems a lot of people like this season's batch."
"D-Without a doubt my most favorite harvest ale out there. Fairly low ABV and that sharp citrus hop zing that I love. There must be Amarillo hops in here....my number one hop variety! Simply outstanding and a brew I look forward to enjoying every fall!"
"D: Pretty good, one of the easier-to-drink bitters out there."
"This isn't too bad, and a nice change of pace from the oktoberfests that dominate the fall scene. It's a solid ESB, although it's somewhat unique for that style, as well. Not a bad brew. Worth picking up."
"Excellent fall beer.Never had a esb quite like this one.Taste like amarillo hops,which I love, mixed with the taste of fall.This is my favorite fall beer.Better than any pumpkin or oktoberfest for my taste.Don't expect a esb when you try it.Nothing like an esb I have tasted.Much better."
"Drinkability: Moderately high - the bitterness is nice and it's fairly refreshing; the ABV doesn't feel too high and this would be a nice warm weather beer."
"Yummm-ooo!!! Wow, great beer! Poured with a big, foamy, frothy, thick, white head and good lace. Color is 18 k yellow gold. Aroma is very fresh, citrus hop. Flavor is super fresh hop but not so citrus, more earthy & chewy hop, some malt, and bread. Body is good, a little soft. Carbonation is good. Finish is excellent. Satisfying yet leaves me with a yearning for more, and more, and...."
"Thank you Southern Tier."
"Drinkability: I found myself liking this beer more and more after the initial shock of the hops. I do like the hoppiness and the slight fruit taste. I could have two or so but certainly not a six. Very enjoyable for the style."
"Harvest is fresh and clean on the whole, and a beer I'll gladly pick up again."
"drinkability is outstanding - i will be going back to the store for more"
"D- I could definitley have a few of these. Nice and refreshing for what it is. Most definitely worth a try. Not a bad beer at all."
"Another stellar beer from the ST.... Cheers!"
"First, with a name like Harvest Ale you are expecting some type of Oktoberfest. Which this is not. However what you will get is a really nice Pale Ale. Very hoppy and smooth. A great hop bite with a nice bitter spicy finish. Just another fine offering from Southern Tier!!"
"D: It's hard not to want to gulp this beer down. It is refreshing, hoppy, and quite delicious. I'm glad I bought a 6er, but it definitely won't last long."
"Nice hoppy beer to enjoy as the days become cooler. I'll be looking for this beer again next year."
"A ""harvest"" ale should be bready and complex; howerver, Southern Tier's is pale."
"This was a very good beer. I was told by the bartender that it was a wheat ale but I assumed, by the name harvest, that it was a fresh hop pale ale. although this is called an esb this is really like a pale ale. Great hop aroma, great bitterness and all around very good beer. A nice change from a brewery with so many extreme beers."
"m&d: light to medium bodied, a very drinkable beer and something different than an APA."
"D - Verydrinkable and a nice change compared to most other fall seasonals"
"really enjoyed this beer for what it is, which isnt much of an esb, more like a light ipa. very sessionable and easy drinking, nice for watching the bills kick some ass this year."
"Harvest. This is my favorite time of year. The northeast weather is starting to cool, leaves gaining the fall colors, football season about to begin and Southern Tier releases the Harvest Ale. This is an exceptional brew. A light golden color that surprisingly sits a bit heavy in mouthfeel. The floral hops create an amazing smell which complements this brews extraordinary taste. You can't just enjoy one, as each after the first just exponentially get better. This brew awakens taste buds that have laid dorment since last fall's Harvest. The only thing better than enjoying a Harvest is enjoying it off a tap with friends. Cheers!"
"D-This is a quite drinkable effort from Southern Tier, and probably the best beer that I have had from them. There is not much that says autumn here for me, but a solid beer to enjoy any time."
"A bright golden orange pour with a lasting foamy white head , lost of lacing left , medium carbonation . Aroma of citrus zest and light floral notes, with a hint of pine . Flavor of light toasted caramel malt , orange and citrus , with some piny resin , nice level of bitterness . Medium body with a clean mouthfeel . Nice hoppy finish . Very good and sessionable . A very good brew from Southern Tier ."
"Had a rich golden apperance, some what standard. Had a very unique smell to my nose. Reminds me of mango sherbert. It had a very complex taste with a multitude of flavors. Sweet, bitter, fruity were the main tastes. Nice bubbly mouthfeel. This was a solid beer, would drink again."
"Mouth is crisp and perfectly carbonated with a slight oily finish. Drinksincredibly easy. One word to describe this beer is: suprising."
"4.5 D: Very drinkable. Easy to put down. I probably should have given a bigger penalty for the lack of body, but this is so damn drinkable."
"Mouthfeel medium bodied. Drinkable? Sessionable. Overall a good brew. Nice to see another good interpretation of the style."
"D- Oh, so drinkable! I am astounded by the big aromas and flavors packed into such a low-alcohol beer!"
"I picked up two 6-packs of this in Columbus, $9.99 each. First off it must be said that this is not an ESB (the style currently entered on BA). This strikes me as an APA or something of that ilk. The beer is crystal clear, golden colored, with a thin 1-finger head that laces onto the glass. The aroma is all amarillo hops, at least as far as I can tell. Based on smell alone I don't think I could distinguish this from Gumballhead (which is not a bad thing). I'm getting lots of citrus like grapefruit, orange, and maybe some non-citrus mango. The taste is nearly equal to the smell, and again it reminds me a lot of Gumballhead. Lots of sweetness from the hops and abundant malt based on mouthfeel, slightly bitter aftertaste which seems to come from the hops again. The body is on the thicker side for such a light looking and smelling beer. This is a big winner from Southern Tier, definitely worth a repeat."
"Oh, it's an ESB. Regardless, it poured a golden straw color lighter than I expected. With the modest white head it looks like a pils. Plenty of citrus/pine hops and stone fruits in the aroma. Same goes for the flavor, with earthy hops dominating. Malts give it balance and there is a touch of banana. With a medium body and oily mouthfeel, this is a great way to ease into fall as this one reminded me of my favorite summer APA's. I'm always glad to see this one on the shelves. Get it while it's available."
"Super session beer."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful hop scent that balances the malt aroma nicely. It boasts of pale, crystal, and bisquit malts. The taste is good. It has a bitter and earthy flavor that goes down smooth and finishes dry and bisquity. It has a nice breadlike quality. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a really good seasonal. I've heard of it mentioned the last couple of years, but could never get any. This is a fine drinker."
"D: Smooth, refreshing."
"D: I could easily session with this one. I don't think ESB is an appropriate title for this beer, but I can't think of anything else. This is a really great beer all around. I'd love to find more of this. Thanks John!"
"Fantastic sessionability, light, but delicious."
"Pours a pale, seethru gold body that is gives off a little head that dies quickly. A mild fruit aroma of apple and pear along with some citric, tealike hop notes. Smooth and medium-bodied with fruit notes ranging from pear to citric (orange, banana (lightly)). Contains some graininess and sweet malt sensations that are balanced for a pleasant drinking experience as it passes the tongue and contains a grat, prickly dry backbite. I must say that this didn't remind me of an ESB at all as the hops are much more dominant than anything else (a mislabeled IPA?). Still, another good beer from Southern Tier."
"Taste is primarily bitter, with some orange flavor and a fair amount of malt backbone. Mouthfeel is relatively light despite the bitterness due to the moderately high carbonation."
"(rated Oct 30, 2007)"
"Easily sessionable. A breeze to drink."
"Drinkability: This is quenching with a dry finish. Malt and hops are balanced but this is way off it's supposed style. I will revisit this one."
"A very American interpreatation of an ESB (I'd call this an IPA for sure). Pours a radiant burnished gold with a large sticky white head that laced prodigiously. Stunning looks. Huge hoppy aroma - all sorts of citrus in abundance. The flavour revelaed much of the same... lots of citrus going on and lending an impressive bitterness. Some solid malts to back it up, and balance everything. Sticky mouthfeel with light carbonation. This is another excellent offering from Southern Tier and sure to satisfy all you hopheads. Thanks for sharing, Shawn!"
"D/O: This has ST's distinctive hop presence cranked up a notch or two, though not overly so. Drinkability is high if you're a hophead, and even if you're not, there's plenty to appreciate in this brew. I struggle with reviewing this as an ESB though, as the malt backbone (or lack thereof, really) remind me more of an American Pale Ale. The hops are there, as you would expect, but I think a bit more malt character would make them really stand out in the taste like the do on the nose."
"Overall this was a very, very good beer. Rich and loaded with hoppy goodness. Easy to session and a joy to drink, I will most certainly have this one again."
"D- I really like this beer. I could session this one all day long with ease."
"This is my introduction to southern tier, and I hope the other 5 styles I have in the fridge will be just as good!"
"D - Pretty decent and enjoyable"
" Even though it's freezing outside right now, this is a pretty good beer for this time of the year. I could easily see myself downing a few of these in a given night, and there aren't any spices or terribly complex flavors to interrupt things here. This does remind me of the Hop Sun in more than one way, but nevertheless, this is a fine brew to grab when transitioning from the fall into the winter. I only wish it was a bit darker and fuller!"
"A nicely refreshing take on the ESB. Doesn't seem very authentic, at least compared to Fullers, but a good beer nevertheless."
"3.8/5"
"Very good beer, just slightly disappointed with the lack of hops in the taste. Excellent job Southern Tier!"
"D - Not bad but not very exciting either. Simple and easy enough to drink though."
"This was an easy drinking and affordable Southern Tier hoppy Ale. It wasn't overly hopped up, but it was getting there. It would be a pleasure to drink this Southern Tier beer again."
"Medium-to-full body, easy to drink, glad to have these at the local beer store!"
"I don't think of a Harvest Ale being an ESB but this is a good beer that is also sessionable."
"Sometimes average is good and sometimes one expects more for the style/Brewery. Decent,but better finds in this style are available.(Fullers ESB)"
"M/D - I really enjoy this one and could get myself into trouble drinking many of these in a night."
"Notes: I wasn't expecting a ESB for a harvest beer but it was very enjoyable."
"Another very fine brew from Southern Tier."
"Once again, for a Harvest Ale this beer seems to be just too light. There is a very smooth and flowing mouth feel to the beer that holds true throughout. The high level of carbonation upon the pour carries its way throughout the offering and perhaps if the carbonation was toned down a bit this beer would have been a bit better of a story to tell."
"Drinkability: A perfectly decent and drinkable harvest ale with a surprisingly low level of alcohol, a good array of fresh, oily hop notes, a pleasant aroma and mouthfeel ... yep, not Southern Tier's best, but definitely a good beer."
"A: Pale yellow, almost the color of a light honey, thin layer of foam across the beer - 3.50, S: Some very earthy and musty aromas which I can assume are largely the result of the 'fresh' hops used for dry hopping, quite citrusy, possibly some grapefruit and pineapple - 3.75, T: A touch more bitterness than I'd expect from an ESB, grapefruit, nice balance of caramel and malt, the back of the tongue really jumps alive which again points to the bitterness - 4.25, M: Quite smooth - 4.25, D: If I wasn't going to grab an IPA and wanted to take in some hops, this may well be the beer I'd grab - 4.00"
"I gave this all 3's because this really wasnt an ESB (in my humble opinion). Perhaps I am wrong, but based on the other 15 or so examples of ESB I have had, this one is nowhere close to the others. Too light in color, lots of fresh hop aroma, light bitterness, light body. If this were an APA, I would give around 4.2. But, with style in consideration, I dont think this fits at all, but I really enjoyed the beer."
"This poured a clear gold with a bit of white head. It smelled like apricot and orange hops with light yeast and a bit of malt. It tasted like bittersweet citrus hops with a bit of floral hops and honey malt. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, an a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a pretty good, clean flavor and nice body. It was more of an IPA than an Octoberfest, and there wasn't anything terribly unique about it. But it was still easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little foamy/fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, hoppy, with some spices. The taste is bitter, malty/hoppy, with some slight spicyness. Medium body. Very drinkable, I really like this one, very nice."
"D: A pretty decent mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer pretty easy going down. The lacing is nice and the flavor of the beer seems to come out more as you drink it. A decent brew definitely worth a go."
"Poured into my Blue Point shaker glass from a 12oz. bottle. Appears a clear golden yellow color with about two fingers of thick white foam. Aroma is dominated by fresh hops with lightly toasted grains present as well. Very nice. Tastes of bitter, piney hops, citrus fruits such as lemon, and mild bready grains. medium in both body and carbonation. Body is fuller than the color of this beer would lead you to believe. Finish is crisp and slightly dry with a pleasant lingering bitterness. A very well done beer that has session written all over it. Don't pass this one by."
"Highly sessionable for me. Try this one if you get the chance!"
"Medium bodied, and somewhat thick in the mouth. All adding to the experience. This is an interesting beer to drink. I'm glad to have the chance to try it."
"Bottom line: Yum! I had my doubts when I took my first whiff but my first taste *told* me that this is a well crafted ESB. Look, my glass is empty already. Bummer."
"Pours a slightly orange-ish gold with a medium sized, sudsy head (that dies back fairly quickly.) Aromas are fairly crisp... pine and citrus, but they are kind of subdued. While those hops dominate the nose and would make you think you were headed down the IPA path, flavor is more consistent with an English ESB... kind of a sweet honey and bread malt body with a bitter hops to hold it in check... it stays nice and crisp throughout and is pleasant enough."
"I was surprised when I poured this beer out because I was expecting some sort of Oktoberfest or something really malty. Instead I got a really nicely yellow beer with some fragrant white head that dies down quickly. I definitely like the color for this style, a lot more Pilsnerlike but with a slightly unique touch of amber too it. Smells hoppy like a west coast IPA with good balance. The taste is rich and hoppy but well balanced by the malt. Grassy hops that finish very clean. I'm usually not a huge fan of overly bitter beers, but this is so clean and full of flavor. A little watery towards the finish, I'd like some more malt there to really get the full experience. Mouthfeel is a perfect balance of carbonation on a medium body. I want some more."
"Just keep me away from that spicy pumpkin flavored shit people call beer."
"Happy Birthday Hyland! I bet it's good with Chinese delivery food Hammer."
"The beer poured a clear, honey-amber with a thin white head into a pint glass. The aroma was of fresh, piney hops - so far so good for an ESB. The taste was very clean and crisp, with a nice balance between the malt sweetness, hop flavor, and hop bitterness. It would be very easy to drink a lot of these."
"Drinkability: This is a decent beer to drink with a snack, or while sitting back relaxing. I wouldn't drink this with dinner, but maybe beforehand to get my taste buds rocking. Not my favorite ESB, but not the worst I've had either."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter and more drinkable side with a really nice creaminess that goes all the way through each sip. Overall, a refreshing brew with a nice hoppy bite that goes down easy. I could see a six pack of this going very well with a crisp fall evening. Thanks to afterexile for the chance to sample this one."
"Pours an unimpressive yellow color with a good head that leaves a little lace. The appearance is easily the weakest point. The aroma is heavily of hops. The taste is the same; dominated by hops with a great bitterness to it. Pretty good beer, definitely happy I was able to try it."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer. On the hoppy/bitter side but has a wonderful citrus smell and graoefruit taste. I liked it and would drink it again."
"A fall seasonal beer that's more or less a tweaked IPA, and not a spectacular one at that. I'd be reluctant to get this one again, just because there are far better year-round IPAs available out there."
"Southern Tier's crafted a rather unique ""harvest"" ale. It's not exactly what you'd expect from a release this time of year. I question the style classification here. This is much more of an APA than an ESB. In any event, it's a really good beer that's worth checking out."
"MF&D - Good carbonation and a slick oily mouthfeel. Although I would hardly consider this ale an ESB, I really enjoyed it. Reminded me a litte of Nugget Nectar."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, there are better hoppy beers out there but this is still a decent beer to drink for a while."
"D: Overall a light bodied but heavily hopped beer that be limited in multiples unless you are a major hophead. Liked it, but not one I would consider session material."
"Drinkability: Seemed almost more like a Pale Ale than an ESB, but I could easily put down a few of these, as the freshness of the hops are pretty striking. Southern Tier's climbing their way out of a hole they'd dug for me after the last few brews I've had from them."
"This drinks like a lighter IPA. Powerful and fulfilling yet extremely clean. Awesome stuff!"
"This just didn't ""do it"" for me. I was left with an almost aspirin-y bitterness without much else. The flavor started out fine but slipped to almost soap-ish and aspiriny."
"D: I was pleasantly surprised by this one... I don't know if I would say it makes me think of Oktoberfest, but that's quite alright. A very tasty brew that I'll be sure to pick up more of."
"One very drinkable beer."
"Their is a nice creaminess to this beer with moderate carbonation that helps makes this beer a decent session beer. This is not my favorite beer style but this is a nice ESB."
"D: What a nice surprise. The listed style of ESB had me expecting one thing and this delivered something completely different. I like surprises!"
"Drinkability is great at the begining of this Ale. As the beer warms the flavours lack and become even more unbalanced. Overall a fine Harvest Ale to drink on any given day."
"Mouthfeel is creamy yet sharp of medium build. As noted above the feel does seem to thin out midway through. Makes for an enjoyable and very quaffable beer."
"Pours a very clear light copper color with a small white head. Aroma is medium sweet, light grapefruit and malty. Flavor is grapefruit, light caramel, light spice and bready. Medium dry finish. Light-medium body, light sticky texture. A very nice ESB with American hops."
"Served at 50F into a Dogfish off-centered pint glass. A very clear light golden color in the glass with an airy white head of about two fingers after a vigorous pour. Foam clings to the side of the glass as it settles down. Smell is of sweet taffey, light toast, and pungeant earthy hops with some citrus mixed in. Flavors start of with a pithy, citrus bitterness along with some sweetness - maybe candied orange peel, and remain on the sweet side until the finish. It ends with a subdued grapefruit bitterness coupled with a very delicate grainy touch. Mouthfeel is quite full and sticky with a relaxed carbonation. Drinkability is very good with a great balance between malt and hops and a moderate abv. A very nice fall brew from Southern Tier that displays very fresh ingredients from the recent harvest."
"Unfortunately this one sample beer I was provided with is the last of it breed at the bottle shop. Seek out, very nice."
"This is a damn solid beer. One of the best non-imperial offering's I've had from ST."
"A golden brew whose light color took me by surprise as I had expected something amber/orange-ish. Thin white head but with decent structure and lace. There is a distinct yet mild hop aroma - a bit citrusy, and a bit tea-like by turns. I also catch a faint and pleasant whiff of autumn leaves, perhaps just a fancy. The flavors are much the same with a nice creamy mouth feel and light-to-medium body. This beer has October written all over it - September if you live up north."
"Great stuff... Recommended..."
"Edit from 9/7/12. Tried again, and was reminded quite vividly that this beer differs from year to year. The current version is decent, but pales in comparison to the beer I sampled back in 2008 (unfortunately)."
"Pours a clear, golden amber hue with some small yet steady bubble. Very faint foam that sticks around for just a little bit . The aroma is a mix of herbal and citrus hops and some toasted caramel breads. The taste starts with lots of orange zest that slowly gives way to soft English caramels and toffee. Just o be overtaken by the herbal and orange hoppy finish. The start is hoppy, then mixes a little with the malt bill. Then finishes hoppy again. The hops are a little too bright, almost metallic tasting. But still a nice Amrican version of an ESB."
"Poured into a standard shaker pint glass. Color was a light golden amber with a white one finger head. Aroma was slightly sweet, but yet bitter. Sometimes I could smell creamy or vanilla, and sometimes a bit of berry fruit, but usually bitterness. Taste was bitter, reminded me of pine but not over poweringly so. Felt reasonably good in the mouth, coated nicely and not excess carbonation to deal with. Very easy to drink, could do a few in a sitting."
"I should have bought a case of this, when I was at the brewery..."
"D- A nice hoppy brew and enjoyable to drink."
"Pours a mostly-clear golden/yellow color, smallish soapy white head fades out really quickly, leaves a ring of various sized bubbles around the glass, a few patches of lacing. Smell is wayyyy hoppy! Juicy grapefruit on the nose, some pineapple, and a soft doughy sweetness. Very hop-forward taste, but it isn't quite as explosive as the nose would suggest, and that's a good thing. Slight piney taste, and all very expertly balanced with the sweet malt. Medium-bodied, slightly creamy, and a just-right amount of lingering hop bitterness. 5.20 ABV?!! Fantastic drinkability here. I'm picking up a case of this, without a doubt. This is the kind of beer you'd want to drink outside, leaves burning, with the hot and sticky summer just a distant memory. Love this!"
"D: This beer is great. Tons of taste and low ABV. This is the kind of beer I want to have a keg of. Really well done by southern tier. I know they have a reputation for their big beers but this one is worth trying."
"Hazy deep golden yellow color. The aroma is something I wouldn't normally expect from a beer dubbed ""harvest ale""... it is very hop forward. True to style it is not, but I love the nose on this beer. Some mild spice is hidden beneath the hop characteristics. A huge hop pungency hits at the onset of the taste followed by a very smooth malt sweetness across the middle. The hops finish on the tail end with the bitterness. Some good spice characteristics are also mixed subtly throughout. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with an easy drinkability and it feels like it would fill me up after a few of them."
"I have to say i really enjoy this beer and would recommend it to others. I would describe it as medium hoped refreshing and easy drinking beer."
"M&D: Light body. High amount of carbonation makes for a tingley mouthfeel. 5.2% ABV and the light nature of the beer make for a good drinkability. Overall, I could have a few of these out in the yard, but just ok for the style. Skal."
"straw colored with a nice think head that just floats on top with ring around the glass that firmly hangs on. smells fruity; apple, pineapple, orange & papaya with a hint of pine. grapefruit citrusy and very smooth. there's some kind of malty sweetness that gives it a nice, well-rounded body. some nice bitterness that lingers momentarily. i've had this on tap and it was much more bitter. surprisingly flavorful and hoppy for the light color. proof that you can't judge a beer by it's appearance."
"Pours yellowish gold with a lasting white head. Lighter than expected and looks much like a lager. Smell is grassy, earthy hoppiness, and mildly so. Taste is somewhat mild, and not very ""green"" or spicy like I like fresh hop beers. Melon and tea flavored hops mostly with some earthiness and mild bitterness. A bit watery and muted flavorwise, but this is very drinkable with no offensive qualities. Decent Pale."
"The hops are piney and citrusy, and go very well will the light esb features of this beer. A great beer overall to bad it is a seasonal thing."
"Nice clear, golden yellow color with a decent stark-white head. Flowery hop aromas and then a floral taste as well. Some maltiness in the back, bitterness, nice beer. I wouldn't have suspected this is an ESB. Thanks to vwcraig for including this on a recent trade."
"Bitter yes, though I'm not sure I'd call this an ESB. IPA aspects as well. Possibly akin to Troegs Hopback Amber ? Whatever, ST Harvest Ale made a solid everyday beer for me between the Octoberfests of Sept. and Oct. and Thanksgiving (when SNCA took over)."
"Bottle courtesy of Jerc: Poured a deep hazy dirty yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aromas of green hops are dominating with some nice floral notes. Taste is also dominated by some bitter green hops with some floral notes. Body is full with some limited filtration and great carbonation. Very well done for the style and something that I wish was available more readily around me."
"Pours a crystal clear straw gold with a nice white head that has some staying power. Nose is perfumed floral hops in abundance, but not shoving it all down, errr...up your nose. Flavor has a nice balance to it, though it is a bit hop forward. Mild bitter tone there. More than mild, but not overly pronounced leafy character as well. Feel has a pretty full carbonation to it and a decent liquid body. A definite fall time brew. Even though it is still summer weather, I drink this on and feel like fall is almost on me. Another good one by ST."
"I have a feeling this one might not age or travel well. But here in Upstate NY it tastes really good."
"Overall-An apa that drinks like a little America ipa. Fantastic freah hops throughout. Top nothc brew"
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. Aromas that are hoppy, with a small grapefruity presence. In the taste, a fresh hop taste, and a nice malty backing. A smooth mouthfeel and a dry, hoppy aftertaste. Nice fresh hop, yet looks like a pilsner. A good crossover from summer to fall."
"Light body, carbonation seems low. Pretty tame at both ends. Not as juicy as I was expecting. Worth trying."
"D: Excellent. I find it difficult to put the glass down. A thirst quencher that doubles up as a sipper, depending on what you are in the mood for."
"I got about a finger of bone-white head with low retention from the pour. The color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow. The nose was spicy and citrusy, specifically, cinnamon and orange zest and I was put in mind of potpourri, plus my mouth started watering. The mouthfeel was medium, approaching full and I got a really tangy orange flavor in the mouth. The finish was more piney and lingeringly hoppy. Shazam! Boy, was this a good beer. I really recommend it."
"Excellent drinkability - just sharp enough to make this beer refreshing AND fulfilling at the same time. Could easily work through a few of these in a night."
"Pours a golden yellow color with 2 finger white head, and some of that lacing really sticks around. Smell is of amazing hops and sweet citrus. Taste is of a crisp hop juice. I really liked this one!"
"Overall- A total session beer. Easy to drink and a pleasant flavor. Tasty stuff!"
"Definitely recommended. Highly ""unique," but not in a challenging way."
"Actually, this was sweet and bitter. Started sweet like lemonheads candy and finished like I'd eaten said candy but the hops grapefruit taste in the middle filled this with grapefruit flavor. Yes, it is a bit on the malty side and more subdued in flavor compared with thier other APAs, but this is better than the aforementioned ales. I'd get this again."
"The feel is watery but with a minor bitter bite. Smooth finish, buttery but not oily. Overall it's very bitter, yet flowery. Incredibly drinkable. A fine, fine autumnal harvest ale."
"Notes: Not sure about the style on this one. BA lists it as an APA; Southern Tier's website calls it a ""Classic English style Extra Special Bitter of the highest order"" (I think it's too hopped up to be called ""English style," however); and it reminded me in many ways of a pilsner (not sure whether that's a German or Czech pilsner). Whatever it is, I like it. Could make a great Fall session beer for hopheads. Another success story from Southern Tier. . . ."
"Edit: I am really noticing more of a citrus hop taste and scent than the pine I originally experienced with an earlier beer from the pack I picked up. Also when I first poured this last beer I noticed a clear pineapple smell which was a little difficult to pinpoint, I just could not figure it out. Not sure why I am picking up the different flavors and scents now. Still a very interesting brew in my book!"
"Drinkability - a tasty ale, a little much for extended sessions but worth a sixer."
"Don't put too much emphasis on the label's claim of ""quadrupulus humulus lupulus", that isn't what it's about. Fans of Amarillos, (as this instantly reminds of Tyranena's Bitter Woman), or hoppy session brews (like Rogue's Youngers Special Bitter or FFF Pride and Joy) will find a kindred spirit here."
"This one took me by surprise. I was expecting an Oktober fest brew of sorts. This one, however was packed full of delicious hops, mostly of the citrus variety. The harvest element of this brew comes through in a spicy malt character that follows the hop bitterness. Not an overly complex brew, which is not always a bad thing. Overall a great harvest brew that I will definitely get again."
"M&D - drinkable a bit colder than i tried it at, just too non-hoppy bitter for me, i love southern tier stuff, to me this is just a miss, not bad flavors, just to bitter for me, esp for a harvest ale"
"Overall, a nice rendition of an APA that drinks with ease. The hop profile actually reminds me of Hop Wallop, just on a lesser scale. Recommended."
"I can see knocking about about 12 of these without much problem."
"As far as APAs go, this one's a beauty."
"Bravo ST, for going above and beyond what you would expect a beer to be."
"I must admit..I found this in my fridge and it had been there awhile. I guessed that because it was refrigerated, I would give it a try. It poured a dark lemon with a small head. The smell was a burst of citrus hops, with a faint malt undertone. Taste was more that of an IPA with a very strong citrus hop presence with a decnt enough malt backbone. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice bitter aftertaste from the hops. OK on drinkability but a couple would be my max."
"I'm not normally a fan of Autumn seasonals, but I'm not really sure if this would fall into that category. Harvest Ale pours a rich copper color with a pale white head that dies down within minutes. Smell is zesty/citrusy/piney all together with a mild hop taste with a malted barley background that balances well. Very drinkable brew and probably one of my favorite ""Autumn Seasonals""."
"Drinkability: Tasty, hoppy and well-balanced."
"Basically the same flavors as are aromas. The lemon is has more of a fresh zest quality, hops aren't overwhelming but blend with the malt without a hitch. Fruity finish and light mouthfeel with good carbonation make this a session beer worth sessioning."
"there are some things here that could use improvement, and i would prefer that this beer be a bit more subtle and fresher than their p&m and ipa, but its a bit too similar for me to absolutely LOVE. the real achievement here is the way they've balanced that trademark ST hoppiness with a smooth texture."
"Prosit MK"
"D: Another winner from Southern TierÂ—seemed bitterer than the IPAÂ—must be those fresh harvested hops. IÂ’d purchase this again if I saw it at the store. Great example of a hopped up pale ale."
"Pours a clear golden, small off white head forms, goes pretty quick but leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell is apples and pears, some pine, spices, alcohol, little bit of caramel. Taste is sweet, almost cidery, caramel and pine, some funk, strange. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, has a little bit of warmth to it. Very odd, wasn't quite sure what to think. Thanks for sharing biegaman!"
"Will be looking for this one again."
"This is a decent beer. The one thing I don't like about it is the long bitter finish, which doesn't bring along the fresh, flowery hop flavor- It just carries the bitterness."
"This beer is all hops, all the time. Its light-gold color looks almost macro-like and while there isnt much head, there is some lacing. Strong earthy and floral aroma that matches the taste. Not too much bitterness in the bite, but enough for a dry, grassy finish. Reminds me a bit of a lighter Hazed and Infuzed with a different hop profile. Not a heavy beer, but all the hops kind of get to you. The easiest way to describe this beer is as ""hop-juice."""
"Southern Tier continues to impress."
"This is a very interesting beer. On first glance, it looks no different than most mainstream, boring offerings. Pours light, almost no head, seems like there's not much to it. At first sniff, it almost seems like it might be a bit skunked. Fellow Advocate williamherbert, whom I greatly respect, recommended it with some reservation. I've worked my way (with some help) through two six packs now, and I only realized how much I enjoyed it when I was craving hops and was overjoyed to find this among the choices available. A very different pale that works for me. In between a pale and an IPA, with a very dry, almost grassy finish."
"It is great finding these seasonal beers in your local store. You know you are getting a fresh beer, and with the harvest type ales, that is paramount. The beer poured with a full head, more than most APAs. Lighter in color than the typical pale ale. It was hoppy in aroma, but subtle. The taste was full flavored hops. A stong pine taste dominated the hop flavor profile, with fruity hints. The malt presence was stong with a slight nutty taste. A great tasting beer that was easy to drink, with its mellower APA hop character, rather than an overwhelming hoppy IPA. But as a harvest ale... it had plenty of hops. A must buy when you see it available."
"Tasty yet not over-the-top in any direction, this is a nice seasonal alternative."
"D: In a blind taste test, I'd say this was an IPA. Certainly from the aroma, but this has a load of citric hoppiness in the flavor as well. A perfect way to spend a cool evening on the deck while dinner is simmering and I wait for my wife to come home from work."
"Overall an excellent fall beer. A nice change of pace from the many Oktoberfest offerings. Very drinkable."
"Drinikability is high for the hopheads, but might came across a bit bitter for those looking for a balanced apa."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is superior. I am thoroughly impressed with this beer. I love their IPA and Porter but IMHO this beer is their best."
"D: this the kind of beer that is worthy of buying a case of."
"Pours light golden. Much lighter than I expected. Thin white head, with very nice lacing. Aroma is strong, gassy,earthy hops. Very nice. Body is light, with some carbionation. Taste is of hops, and fruit. Very refreshing, and full flavored. This brewery continues to impress!"
"Yep, this one surprised me. I thought I was getting some type of Oktoberfest. But I will say, this fruity, hoppy beer is a damn good one. Pretty nice lacing, decent head. Esthery fruits in this one, especially grapefruit and nice hoppy finish. I think this is more of an IPA than an APA. Reminds me of Sierra's Celebration Ale. A pleasant treat, wish I could get this terrific session brew year round."
"Sample at AleFest Dayton: Bright golden color with a thin white head and minimal lacing. Citrusy hops aroma with roasted malt in the background. Light-bodied with a zesty character of herbs and spices and citrus. Nicely hopped but has good malt balance. The finish is hoppy yet sweet at times. Pretty good stuff."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable, modest ABV and very hoppy -- great beer!"
"Golden, leaning toward amber, topped with a fluffy white head. Resinous Cascade aromas: scents of sugared grapefruit sections and warm pine sap. Sweet grapefruit flavor at first -- bitter piney hop blast immediately thereafter. Mellows slightly at finish with toasty malt -- but very little at that. Stinging Cascade burps. Light to medium body and juicy mouthfeel. Super easy to drink, but I usually like a bit more malt balance in my APAs. Decent offering nonetheless."
"Drinkability: great drinkability as a few of these can be quaffed in a single session."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful hop scent that balances the malt aroma nicely. It boasts of pale, crystal, and bisquit malts. The taste is good. It has a bitter and earthy flavor that goes down smooth and finishes dry and bisquity. It has a nice breadlike quality. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a really good seasonal. I've heard of it mentioned the last couple of years, but could never get any. This is a fine drinker."
"Has a nice gold color with an orange hue and a pure white head on top that stays. The smell is deliciously earthy. Lots of piney hops with a bit of citrus hidden in there. And it tastes just like it smells. That piney hop flavor is everywhere, but balanced well enough with the malt so that its not overpowering. The mouth feel is good and full, with just the right amount of carbonation. It finishes with a pleasant, bitter aftertaste that lasts. Excellent beer for the fall."
"Weighs in on the side of an IPA."
"This pale ale is on the verge of an IPA"
"Good APA lacking only in the mouthfeel."
"Thanks to shippos for sending this one along. Pours an orange color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of citrus in it as well as a little bit of malty goodness. The flavor is hoppy but there is a malt presence. Something about the hop used in the flavoring of this one didn't catch me the right way. Not sure what it is. Good beer though."
"From shippos to clvand0 to my glass. This beer pours a hazy orange/peach color wtih a small head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is actually rather nice, with a good bit of citrusy hop and caramel malt. It is a good combination together. The flavor is a little more in the dirty hop. The flavors are not overly strong, but they melt together very well. The feel is a little creamy smooth, with a minimal carbonation. This would be a refereshing beer on a warm summer say. Worth a look in my book."
"very similar to phin&matts extraordinary but this has a bit less hop character, either boecause of it's freshness or changes in the beer? grassy and resiny with a grainy aroma. again very similar to P&M, but not as hoppy or fresh. worth a shot, but I think this is a hit and miss as far as the bottles go."
"Bottle two and a third years later, decent aroma, taste, appearance. Hoppy, like a pale with more on the wheat side."
"Harvest Ale is another winner from Southern Tier. Given the name and the autumnal color scheme on the label, I thought I was popping open an Oktoberfest. What a great surprise; hops are always welcome. This is an excellent APA and is yet another beer that I'd love to have access to. A big Thank You to HappyHourHero for the bottle."
"Hazy copper. Firm off-white 1cm head. Interesting hop dominated aroma with underlying earthy and cookie-ish malt. Hops come in orangey and rather floral. It has pretty much everything for me to enjoy it, tastes very fresh. Perhaps just a tad too bitter/tart for my tastes. Still, nice overall balance I must admit, but I kept thinking (dreaming) of sierra nevadaÂ’s version IÂ’ve had recently and it would annihilate this otherwise very fine example. STÂ’s example has a good classic highly carbonated medium mouthfeel, but it doesnÂ’t have the multiple layers of silkiness that sierra nevada has."
" Light in body - at least as an ESB - more of an Extra Pale Ale to me - the extra part being the IBU's not the alc/vol. Almost Pilsner like in character but with IPA bittering. A very tasty glass - hope I find it on tap somewhere before its all gone."
"Had this at Macgregor's in Canadaigua,poured a deep gold with moderate head that didnt stay around to quickly aromas of pine and some citruisy (mainly lemon) notes as well.Taste up front was very piney and resiny but as I drank more the biscuity malt backbone showed itself more really balancing this one out lightly sweet just enough to tame the hops a little.Seemed a tad thin at first not sure if its just me that picked that up,anyways a very good beer from Southern Tier."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 3/4"" off-white head, which laces quite well. A cloudy (poured in the whole thing) slightly orangey amber brew, with a reasonably balanced aroma tending toward the hops side just a tad. Taste has a good malt base, and plenty of hops bitterness, although not very delicate in that aspect. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, and could improve if the bitterness was a bit more artistic and not as much head-on bitter. An enjoyable brew, for sure."
"Huge thanks to Shippos for this offering from the Empire State."
"Not as punishing as it sounds, though it is quite bitter, this beer settles in surprisingly well after the first pint. The worst part of this beer was knowing I had to go home to a world without it. I'd love to sniff and chew this prim rose again. A bountiful harvest of hops balanced by a deft show of malt. Well-done!"
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a large fluffy eggshell colored head. Smells strongly of hops. Literally busting out of the glass with them. Not suprisingly, it is a hop dominated pale ale, and a darn good one. Just a small hint of pale malt with an immediate assault of (cascade?) hop. Finishes very piney and dry. Moderate in body and high in drinkability."
"Pours a clear light amber, with a big fluffy white head that mostly lasts, leaved great lace on the glass. Aroma is biscuity malts, with lots of fresh floral and pine from the abundant hops. Flavor starts with some good biscuit and caramel maltiness, ends with a huge fresh tasting hoppy goodness. Medium-full bodied, extremely good stuff. Thanks to jah noth for this fine ale."
"Poured a lucious autumn yellow like a slowly changing oak leaf and had a nice thick white head that laced up as the beer slowly moved down the glass. The smell had thick resinous pine cone hoppiness abounding. This was a strong smelling pale ale and for a second thought they may have screwed up my order and poured me a Southern Tier IPA. But upon taste bud inspection I quickly learned this was not the case. The first 1/3 of the glass was still all hops, but as I drank further some serious malts began to show up first in the finish and then throughout a sip. This was great biscuity malts that held their own against the judicious hops, but not overpowering in any way. This was a perfect warming beer for that nip in the air."
"Wow, another godsend from NY, this beer is just as tasty and possibly more balanced as their IPA. These guys are doing some things right I am by far more impressed with their beers than anything out of the Matt Brewing Co. (Saranac). Appearance: Copper orange body nice white head with evenly disributed lacing, perfect. Aroma: Nice full pine cone and citrus scented hops plentiful hop aroma, with a lucious malt backbone. Taste: Well balanced with an overall excellent snappy hop bite to it, awesome caramel tinged malts very very good. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied smooth carbonation no complaints. Drinkability: A go to for myself hits my beer soul just right, so easy drinking and flavorful at the same time ideal session brew in my eyes."
"It poured golden orange, had a nice off white head that slowly faded away. The smell is great, big juicy hops. The taste is just frickin awesome. Its still got the hoppyness to it, but instead of taking your tongue and beating the hell out of it, it rubs your tongue until you're one happy camper. TRY THIS BEER! Yum, yum, yum, happy, happy, happy. Lot's of tasty hops, yet well balanced, just damn tasty. I haven't tried enough fall seasonals to tell you its the best out there, but this one single beer is the most impressive beer I've had in recent memory. Maybe its because I wasn't expecting much, but I am totally blown away. Time to drink the rest, woohoo!!!"
"Sampled on tap at MacGregor's 18 Oct 2003. Two Imperial pints on special for $2.25ea. Hell yeah! Another fine offering from Southern Tier. Their fall seasonal is an immediate classic brew in a class all it's own. Clear copper, steady off-white head. A tad lighter than the ST IPA. A brew that begs to be drunk...with an irresistable drinkability. A perfect combination of solid malt and precise hop balance combining Cascade and Styrian Goldings. That combo lends an awesome hop profile thats blends classic oily/piney Goldings with citrus/fruity Cascade. A sought after fall seasonal worth its weight."
