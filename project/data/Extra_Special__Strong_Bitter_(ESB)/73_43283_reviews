"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall It was a pretty solid beer of the style. It was flavorful, easy drinking and well balanced."

"D: At 5%, this is a quaffable ale. The hop profile will keep the hophead happy while the low alcohol pleases the sessioners."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Very bready and yeasty. Slightly bitter on the tongue but not as bitter as expected. This brew is light bodied and crisp on the finish. Many floral notes accompany rich, caramelized breads. Very refreshing to have on a spring afternoon."
"D- This beer was really really good. ESB's are interesting to me in either they are good or else they terrible. ABV on this makes it a easy drinker for the night which I had no problem drinking a couple pints of this."
"This is a classic Great Lakes beer.. Moondog is king.. I still haven't come across a tastier and more enjoyable ESB. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability isn't even debatable. Goes down so easy and makes me want more. Read the description of an ESB, give this a try, and I'm sure you will find this beer better than average and expected."
"Drinkability was about perfect the on distraction may be that it's a bit on the hoppy side for my tastes for the style but is a wonderful session type brew and it's sad that this has been taken out of the rotating bottle releases."
"On tap of the brewpub. Tons of off-white head on copper-orange colour beer with nice head retention and lacing. Smells of floral english hops and bready malt. Has a very nice floral bitterness to it. Quite smooth carbonation makes this an awesome beer to drink on the patio."
"D. Quite high, very sessionable and I wish I had another. Moondog is a fine Americanized ESB that drinks Real Good."
"Golden-orange color with great lacing and a small head of about one finger. A clean flowery hop aroma is heavy in the nose. Tastes of munich and crystal malts; semi sweet with a slightly citrus hop kick and a thin body. Overall, very drinkable but very underwhelming after hearing so many good things about this brew."
"Notes: Interesting to have on tap at the brewery. Others have lamented the brewery's decision to discontinue bottling of this beer. I can see why. It is very drinkable and delicious."
"Drinkability: Downright quaffable! A pleasant, refreshing ale I could drink all damn day."
"I'm reviewing and grading based on what I experience. While I'd like ""more"" to this beer, the taste and drinkability are both good. Like all Great Lakes beers, it's very well done. This one happens to be on the bottom end of my style preference."
"Drinkability: Much lighter in color than I would expect from an ESB, but is does deliver in flavor. If this were a little darker and a little less carbonated, it would be spot on. As it is, it is still pretty good."
"D - goes down easy."
"Notes: Wow, I really enjoyed this easy drinking and refreshing ESB!!!"
"It's nowhere near a Fuller's but it still makes me feel Extra Special."
"Drinkability is huge, I could down a 6 of this over the course of a vacation day and only feel a little guilty. Very more-ish."
"This ale pours a clear golden with thick, clingy white head. The aroma is moderately hoppy with medium-low sweetness. The flavor is moderately hoppy but balanced by a moderate biscuity malt flavor. The swallow is smooth and fruity esters emerge. The carbonation is medium-high with a medium-thin body. Overall a very tasty brew with extraordinary drinkability - I could drink gallons of this stuff."
"D: This is a delicious beer that I'll drink if i see again"
"D- A very nice play on the style definitely a perfect summer beer for those hot and muggy days. I strongly reccommend trying this."
"mouthfeel is slightly creamy, good carbonation and hop resins, slightly sweet and super easy to drink, amazing, wish we had easier access to it over here, i would buy it more often!!"
"D: At 5%, this is a quaffable ale. The hop profile will keep the hophead happy while the low alcohol pleases the sessioners."
"D- Highly drinkable. I really loved this."
"A very drinkable ESB. In fact, when on tap, Moondog is probably my favorite ESB."
"D - First go with an ESB and it was nice, but not nearly as good as some other beers I've had. Not a bad beer for $8.50 a six, just not all that memorable overall... Not one of my favorites from Great Lakes - I think I would take Burning River any day over this brew"
"This to me is a solid version of a uniquely American session ale. Easy to drink yet has serviceable complexity and hop presence."
"D, notes: this is a very solid and drinkable take on a British ESB."
"Moondog's a very solid ESB. I'm not traditionally a huge fan of ESBs, but this is a good one. Frankly, it's pretty impressive save for the nose. It's just too weak to really impress in that department. Otherwise, very solid beer."
"Pours gold in color with a white ring around the top of the glass. Smell is subtle hops and nothing else. Very bitter in the taste. Lots of bittering hops in this beer. Bubbly, almost a heavy carbonated feel due to the hops. It's that bitter. Not a whole lotta flavor, just a very bitter beer. Easy drinking. Very good web, lacing on the side of the glass. After a few sips, this is a highly hopped beer. It really is noticeable."
"Poured into a pint glass and later into a pils glass, the pils is the way to go. Dark bronze color with a thin white head, tons of sticky lacing and bountiful carbonation. This is a nice looking beer. The aroma is favored by a sharp hop scent backed by some subtle malts, nice scent but it should be more abundant. Mouthfeel is also sharp and crisp with an ample fullness. The flavor is real nice, generous amounts of flowery hops are present. The malts are subtle and there are tiny overtones of citrus hop flavors. Somewhat similar to their Dortmunder Gold this is an enjoyable ale."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time."
"Eric"
"Drinkability is outstanding. It's probably the first beer I've ever had that I wished I had gotten a case of instead of a single. Now I've got to go buy more of it before they pull it off the shelves due to the season changing."
"Golden amber body with creamy white head that falls somewhat quickly, leaving random spots of lacing down the glass. Nice fresh nose with floral, perfume, and light citrus notes. A biscuity essence and hints of caramel are underneath. Taste is nice and well balanced. Moderate bitterness up front followed by the malts which keep it in check. It ends with a slightly drying finish. Mouthfeel is nice with a good carbonation to it and slides down quite easy. Overall, this is quite the session brew. I would love to have this available at all times, quality ESB."
"Light mouthfeel,peppery,with a mouthwatering drying finish making for an exceptional drinker. Not a huge ESB fan,this ESB makes my feel different about that. I'll be looking for this one next year,as soon as it comes out."
"MF: Creamy goodness.... nice mouth coating. appropriately carbonated."
"D- Very easy to drink. Nothing should stop you from putting a few of these away. Overall a very nice brew."
"This is the bang-for-the-buck beer, and is my daily beer in the early summer months. It would be year 'round if only they made it. However, after many sixes of this, it's getting old for me. Very much a session beer, for a short while every season, it becomes my favorite, then fades. Maybe that's why it's limited release."
"---wish i could have this on cask, would be outstanding"
"Overal experience is, like every other GLBC product I've had, excellent. A well-crafted session ESB. Can't wait to try this with food."
"T: Dry, biscuit like background with a strong grassy, floral hop bite. Much drier and hoppy than malty and sweet. Relatively light body with active carbonation and very strong lingering malty, biscuit flavor. Very drinkable, a nice ESB, but not my favorite of the style and probably my least favorite GLBC bottled beer that I've had so far."
"Overall a pretty good session ESB from Great Lakes."
"I'm thinking that this is the same as their Moondog Ale, just renamed. Twelve ounce bottle pours a clear amber body with a small offwhite head that leaves a bit of patchy lace. Aroma is toasted malt, peppery hops, and a hint of florals. Light medium body is well carbonated. Taste has some caramel sweetness, toasted bread, peppery hops, and some fruity pear. Bitterness is tame but assertive. Very nicely balanced and highly drinkable. One of the better American stabs at an ESB."
"The mouth is tart and slightly thick. Could be a session beer if you wanted to go very easy."
"Moondog pours a bright yellow/orange color with lots of visible, active soda-like carbonation and a big 2 finger dense white head. Stale hops, corn and pale malts make up the nose. Very punchy and bright tasting. The hops are in great balance with the malts and it is not that bitter, faint hints of fruit and bread, it leaves a slight sweetness on the tongue. Its very seltzer-like in body and mouth feel. Very refreshing. Zingy beer."
"D: Tasty and clean. A great beer to kick back with on a hot day. A nice treat."
"certainly one of the more refreshing beers I have had this year. good for the summer."
"Another quality Great Lakes brew. I could drink this ESB all day."
"Overall, I would have to say ""meh"". Maybe it would shine on cask, maybe."
"D - I really like this beer. It's just another good beer from the guy's at Great Lakes."
"Nice beer, but not a typical ESB flavor. Glad to have the opportunity to try but wouldn't seek it out."
"A warm-weather ale which goes easy but is not particularly interesting. I may purchase this again if I see it on tap, otherwise it's one of the lesser productions from the Great Lakes camp."
"Excellent ESB. I love Great Lakes Beers and it was awesome to try them on tap."
"D : This would be an excellent session beer. It's exactly what I expect from an ESB with the right balance and not a lot of bitterness."
"But nevertheless... a great, very balanced, drinkable beer. I could (And did) drink these all night."
"I have yet to try anything from Great Lakes I haven't liked, and here the streak continues. Highly recommended."
"Classic Great Lakes excellence at work in a very fine and unique ESB. Will kick back and probably over-eagerly enjoy the rest of this sixer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Good feel to this beer, I will drink it again."
"Poured a gold color with a generous amount of white head that fizzles and leaves some lacing around. Aroma is very crisp with some light grain build. PLenty of lacing for this. Taste is very hop filled with a grassy/floral back drop. Mouth feel is very clean and crisp. I think I have found a new fave session beer. Might have to pickup some more of this one."
"I could drink this all day long. This is a great session or lawn mower beer. Goes great with the Ohio spring weather."
"This is probably one of the best session beers that Great Lakes brews. Like most of GLBC brews, this is beer is very appealing to the eye. Poors a nice golden color with many bubbles. The smell does seems a bit off, almost grassy - not to bad though. The taste exemplifies a solid a ESB. Great brew GLBC!"
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a big bubbled one finger head that remains for a quite sometime. Stickiness is pretty hit or miss, but it's there. A whole bunch of bubbles race to the top of the glass as well. Smell is very GLBCesque. Peanut butter in the nose Yes, peanut butter! Just like the Burning River Pale. Mild malts and just a hint of sweet citrus malts tingle the nose as well. Very subtle overall aroma with this one, nicey. Flavor begins with a sweet nutty taste followed by a bit of grapefruit and pine. Caramel malts midway through leading to a lemongrass aftertaste with a hint of pepper and spice. Light to medium body with a sharp feel. Carbonation is a bit strong, but doesn't take away from the overall quality of this brew. Another solid drinkable beer from GLBC. I look forward to the day when their beers are available in NY, let's hope it's sooner rather than later."
"Poured a clear amber with 1 inch of frothy off-white head, good retention, some lacing. Smells of floral hops, a bit of malty biscuit, and honey, not a lot of aroma though, had to dig deep. Tastes of honey, toasted grain, and floral hops. Medium light in body with good carbonation. Not too bitter and has a crisp finish, but all the flavors seem a little muted. Easy to drink and sessionable, but needs a little more oomph in the flavor department."
"MF & D- at first effervescent and thin bodied, but as the fizz quickly fades on the tongue, a slight thickness is revealed as this suddenly medium bodied ale coats the palate with a drying hop film. the pros and cons for me here are kinda tough to distinguish, since they're not really good or bad. from 2007 memories, i remember a slightly thicker body that was not quite syrupy, but i could possibly be getting that mixed in with memories of the feel of the several other traditional esb's i've had, and a slightly thicker less carbonated brew is somewhat desired. on the flip-side, this relatively highly carbonated beer keeps my attention, and is much more crisp and quenching than those from the past. maybe this batch is a little different, or maybe i'm just a scatterbrain. great lakes is pretty much my favorite brewery, and they've never presented me with a drink not to my liking (with the exception of christmas ale due to my personal preferences), but in the end 2008 moondog still feels like pale ale to me. its D is incredible however, and what it may lack in style, it more than makes up for in enjoyment."
"An extremely sessionable brew and one I will certainly seek out as the months grow warmer. Just another solid offering from the people at GLBC."
"12 ounce bottle, best before 7/30/08. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a gold/orange colot with an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like grain, toasted malt, caramel and some butterscotch/diacetyl. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some earthy/herbal hops in the taste too. There's also a good long lasting bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth, clean and a bit slick. Drinkability is good too, it goes down easy and with a 5% ABV it's a good choice as a session beer. I think this is a good beer, it's nice and refreshing. I'd definitely pick up some of this again."
"D: Very crisp and refreshing. Perfect for summer, sessions, and converting :)"
"True to some lighter Bristish versions with an American twist. Very floral finish."
""
"Drinkability - this is very good, goes down well, and is very sessionable."
"I don't necessarily want lots of these but it's pretty refreshing and a nice balance of malt and hop. Recommended."
"Not bad, an enjoyable easy drinking session beer."
"Pours golden. Thin white head,not much retention, and just a bit of lace. Smell is mostly malt, with some piney spice,and hops. Body is light with a good amount of carbionation. Taste is good, but not a extra strong bitter. Up front mostly malt, with some spicy hops in the finish. Worth a try."
"Crisp, tangy and dry. Medium bodied, I would go for this one again, and as a session brew with the 5% not overpowering by any means."
"Drinkability: I found myself drinking this pretty quickly. And sans the carbonation, this beer is lacking any flaws."
"The malt profile in this beer is excellent. Easy drinking, balanced session brew. Great beer if you're in the mood for something mild but flavorful."
"Worth the wait {for me} indeed."
"Slàinte!"
"Light amber with an absolutely massive off-white head. Primarily fruity nose with scents of fresh melon, strawberries, apples, caramel and brown sugar malts, and a distinctly floral hop aroma. The taste is much like the nose, although the carmelly malts and floral hops are more prominent; many fruits abound as well. Light body and lively but not overbearing carbonation. Great, authentic rendition of a classic style. I bet this stuff is superb on cask (if it ever is presented that way)."
"Notes: Very solid beer from Great Lakes. Not my favorite but still nothing I would be embaressed to serve to my beer loving friends."
"Drinkability: Goes down fairly easily, average alcohol content and light body makes it a decent session beer."
"D- This beer has some nice big hops with Noble and American qualities but the great malt flavors are lost to quickly in the hops."
"Final Thought: A subtle flavored ESB that has session written all over it, a great brew by Great Lakes!"
"Medium bodied and light and delicate carbonation give this beer a great mouthfeel. This is a beer that is a great canidate to be a session beer. This is one that I will definitely comeback to in the future, perhaps in a few weeks or next year when the next batch comes out. Either way, I can see myself buying more of this in the future. Its a great beer to enojy on warm spring/summer nights."
"Last swigs: Where this is not a plae ale is quite a trick. Just enough bready malt to keep it in check. A decent American example of an English classic."
"Exceptionally clean refreshing mouthfeel. Big invigorating carbonation, with a perfect blend of malt and hop. Some lemon rind, orange, and flowers round out the taste. I can't say enough about how wonderful this beer is to drink all day."
"Bottom line: another success from Great Lakes. I suppose that someday I'll run across something of theirs I don't like, but not today. Apparently it's a spring release, so get it now while you can. Highly recommended."
"it's a good ESB. the malt is nice and hops let it stand out. great aroma"
"Like many bitters you could drink these forever and a day."
"I don't know if this is a true ESB, it's almost like a Vienna lager, but nonetheless, it is very good. Very well balanced between the malt and slight hoppiness. Caramel leads the malts initially, followed by extreme smoothness and a nice refreshing finish. I must say, I've been in the Cleveland area 2 months, have tried about 6 styles of GLBC, and haven't been disappointed in one."
"This is a nice looking dark gold beer with an almost white head. The smell is subtle but good. It has an almost German Lager type malty smell, mixed with the aroma of English hops. At first there is very little taste, then there is a slightly dry hoppy taste that gets a bit more bitter in the aftertaste. It is never truely bitter in the pale ale sense. The mouthfeel is fine, very smooth and easy to drink. The drinkability is very good."
"Quite pleasant, albeit, ordinary. Very pilsner like with other attributes. Golden / yellow color with very nice head retention. Flowery and lightly spicy aroma with an underlying sweetness and hop character. Tastes moderately malty, bready, and a little grainy with a honey-suckle like sweetness. A light hop flavor and bitterness substantiate this brew, becomming a very balanced pleasant brew. Finishes very clean and crisp despite the light powdery sweetness."
"Very smooth crisp finish leaves as good as it starts. I'll definitely have this again. Score another for The GLBC!"
"This is one of the best I have enjoyed in this style...very drinkable."
"Pours a transparent copper color with a nice sized white foamy layer on the top. The nose is of fruits and has a slightly sweet malty presence. It tastes good. Strong of fruits and hops, maybe a little malty in the finish. The mouthfeel is a little shy of medium-bodied, and has the perfect amount of carbonation and feels just right. Drinkability is good. I wish I had several of these to enjoy tonight. Good beer here, I'd have a hard time finding anything wrong with this one. Cheers!"
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a mostly clear amber color with an inch of white head. The aroma is toffee, hops, and a little fruit. Toasted malt flavor. A little buttery. Hops come in midway and provide a solid flavor and bitterness. Fruit flavor comes in the finish. Not overly bitter. Drinkability is good. This is yet another solid offering from GLBC."
"Drinkability: You could drink a couple of these in a sitting. This would also make a good choice for a ESB session drink if you can find it."
"Drinkability: Moondog is pretty easy to drink, but is only mildly bitter. Its aroma also gets noticeably worse as it warms. Still, it's pretty good, and you could session several of these easily."
"Very nice cross-style. A yeasty delight with a supporting bitterness and well malted. Initially large head that evaporated to a crown of yeast. Nice yeast aroma and creaminess. Easy satisfying drink at the end of another hot summer day. Malted milk aftertaste. Second botle on incredible hot day a year later and agree with everything. Very drying aftertaste."
"Moderate, tingly mouthfeel. Another great session brew from GLBC."
"Drinkability: A good session beer and another solid brew from my, for the moment, Great Lakes Brewing Company. I have yet to have anything they don't talk down."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Goes down smooth. I could drink this brew all night. A nice deep mix of flavors that keeps me coming back for more. Yet another winner from Great Lakes!"
"Drinkability: I'm not blown away by this one, but it could be a good session beer, as it is easy going down."
"D&N: I feel a fool for thinking this would be too bitter (not had too many ESB's yet). I was expecting a lemon, I got a surprisingly delicate beer with great balance. Aromas could be kicked up a notch or two, but otherwise this is another highly drinkable beer from a rock solid brewery. Man I love GLBC stuff!"
"Drinkability is good easy drinking style good flavors very smooth and easy to drink ESB."
"Least memorable beer of all the ones I tried, for some reason. Does have a kick on the tongue and loos nice, but everything else was just above average. Relatively speaking, my least favorite Great Lakes brew, but this is coming from a great brewery. My 5 ounce taster was enough for me."
"The beer slides uphill initially, mild and smooth on the tongue, then slowly peaks to a nice, rich crescendo and finish on the throat. There are not a lot of peaks and valleys, but still an enjoyable ride and a nice beer. Definitely worth a try."
"This brew has a hazy oragne body topped by a big, bubbly white head. Excellent bitter hop aroma BOING. Sweet malt front, coupled by a nice bitter hop backbone. Bits of flower hops as well. Citrus tones from the hops. Hints of fruit.Smooth mouthfeel. Nice ESB."
"Drinkability - very tasty beverage, above average."
"poured golden orange with a small white head. aroma fruity, orange, floral hints of malts. flavor and lemony orange, sugar, hints of hops and malt. I wish this beer was here in mich. sooner I would like to have had this for the summer to have on those hot days and when BBQing a very drinkable beer"
"Moondog Ale may not be a world-class version, but it's next to impossible for a brewery to nail each and every style they choose to brew. It is, however, a rock solid, tasty as hell ESB that maintains Great Lakes's place as a shining star in the brewing firmament. Thanks Mom (a BA in spirit) for bringing me a sixer on your most recent trip west."
"Pours a golden color with a short head that dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is hoppy and citrus-like. Very pleasant. The orange character is quite noticeable in the flavor. Dry finish. Nice body on this one. Interesting brew and good to drink, but nothing spectacular."
"This beer pours a nice golden color with a finger of head that falls to a half an inch. Wow, the nose is very orange and fruity. The flavor is good. There is a nice fruity sweetness in there and a subtle hop that comes through on the finish. I don't think this is an ESB, but I think its good. Mouthfeel is very thick and a bit creamy. I do like it. Drinkability is high. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall a good offering."
"This has some very good hop aroma with a nice balance of caramel malt peeking through. For those interested in specific styles, it could probably pass-off as an APA even though it's supposed to be a Bitter. Flavor has a great balance of bitterness and caramel malt. The noticeable presence of Northern Brewer hops makes this a nice example of Northern Brewer's versatility for both bitterness and flavor. Mouthfeel is moderate with a smooth balance making this an easy brew to drink."
"This is another quality beer from Great Lakes. This is a good session beer. A very well crafted and smooth beverage."
"ng"
"Mouth is very smooth and medium bodied. This beer was gone before I even realized it. Very clean and refreshing."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a nice fluffy head. Small bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Nice amount of lace on the glass throughout. Smells like bread with some flowery hops. Taste begins with a sweet bready malt, followed by a dough-like center. The finish is a flowery, slightly herbal hop flavor with a modest amount of bitterness. Finish is pretty dry. Medium body with appropriate carbonation. This beer is extremely drinkable. What a session beer! Nothing overwhelming makes this perfect to drink all evening. Another quality beer from GLBC."
"This pours a nice copper color with a slight orange hue. Nice white head that disappears to a ring around the edge with nice white carbonation atolls. The smell is kinda flowery and caramel sweet. The hop presence in the flavor is very subtle, very relaxed as it moves across the pallet. The floral hoppiness gives way to some slight fruit flavors and malty sweetness. As far a mouthfeel is concerned, the carbonation is perfect and it's a little thin as it rolls around my mouth. The mouthfeel and the mildness of the flavor make this very drinkable, easily looking for more to enjoy when the six-pack is empty. Well done as usual by Great Lakes Brewing Company..."
"Very nice ESB. The sugar cookie finish and floral hops really do it for me. Very easy to drink. Would be more drinkable with a little less bitterness. Still, this is an awesome brew. Reminds me a little bit of Dead Guy Ale or Boston Ale. Recommended."
"Pours a brilliantly clear copper color and is topped by a dark cream colored head. A fairly clean aroma that has a faint citrus aroma with a bit of grassiness as well. As the aroma suggests there is not a whole lot of hop flavor here, but there is a nice bitterness in the finish. Lightly sweet up front with hint of toasty malt flavor in the middle. Tastes a bit on the thin side, this is a rather plain, almost boring beer."
"I had reviewed this when I was starting my journey as a BA and recently had this again and well, 4 years and 500+ beers later makes a difference. I was only comparing this with two-three ESBs, and Fullers and the Broad Ripple were two of the few. So now with an update May 2008, I'll say this is a very good example of an ESB, but still does not match the best."
"I think I just found my ""light"" beer for my dream tap line...this is a dandy in its own way from Great Lakes...."
"Hey cokes, thanks for setting up the Huge Dog with the Moon Dog."
"Drinkability is very solid and very refreshing. Nice summer beer, not sure I agree on the ESB designation but very nice beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a medium amber color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on this one. The smell is grassy and hoppy, with a little sweet malt present. It really smells more like an amber lager than an ale. The taste starts with sweet caramel malt, little bits of cherry and citrus present. The finish has a good little dose of hops. The mouthfeel is fairly thick, and very very smooth. The drinkability is fantastic, and I could down many of these on this cold winters night."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden, with a medium creamy head tat somewhat lasts, leaves some lacing. Aroma is ""fresh", floral, peppery, with some earthiness in there. Flavor is lightly sweet caramel, earthiness, with a peppery hop finish. The medium body is easy drinking, quite good stuff."
"Appearance: A copper blazoned hue with a resilient white colored head, leaving nice rings of scattered lacing a wonderful presentation from this great brewery. Aroma: Sweet honey like tones blended with full floral hop bouquets what a well balanced beer, brown sugar like sharp malted barley tones very nice solid all around aroma. Taste: Probably the most favorable attribute of this brew not over the top in anyway perfectly awesome at the same time due to it's subtle flowery hops and light refreshing yet packed full of flavor malt profile with fruity tones in the finish making for one excellent session beer. Mouthfeel: Has a creeping carbonation slightly silky smooth mouthfeel with a lighter medium body that paris well with the flavors. Drinkability: Just mindblowingly quaffable enticingly good, and easily one of my favorites from the lineup from the brewers of Cleveland's Great Lakes."
"Seems a hair thin, but solid session stuff. One doesn't do this justice."
"Want great beer? GLBC. 'Nuf said."
"Thanks to aaronh for providing this quality beer. Another great offering from Great Lakes.....hey, something good has to come from Cleveland!!!!"
"Pours a nice copper color with a light but sticky head,tje aroma ia malty bisciut like aromas.Nice malty beginning to this brew with some underlying fruitiness finish with a nice crisp hopsmack.My favorite style of beer cuzz of brews like this.I would love to have this from a beer engine."
"Clear amber color with a medium creamy off-white head. Thin and sticky slow lacing. Both hops and malt in the aroma. Medium bodied, with a rather light hops load in the flavor. Kind of mild for a Bitter, there is a definite malt backbone along with some fruit. The finish is a little on the sweet side. A good session beer."
"Once again, thank-you GLBC. This is an excellent summertime ale, Pours a nice copperish sort of color, nice sweet biscuit aroma. Biscuity malty flavor with some hops thrown in for good measure. I like everything I have ever tried from these guys, and this is no exception."
"Poured (2) 12 oz bottles into my 1L glass. The off-white head nearly filled the glass as it formed above the brilliant copper body. This beer displays striking clarity, like looking into a perfect topaz gemstone. The head lasts a long time, with a thin layer of foam persisting for most of the glass. A mild maltiness supports a smooth hop prescence on the nose. The aroma doesn't reach out and grab you; rather it gently seduces you, taking you delicately by the hand and making you yearn for this beer. The taste is a buttery caramel experience that is fairly fruity, but develops a very pronounced bitterness that keeps the taste buds from getting too mellow on the malt without getting punishing. Every once in a while, a little bit of floral hoppiness shows up. The aftetaste is pretty clean for a flavorful ale, with a touch of buttered biscuits and just a hint of soapy bitterness. This is session city, man. Mouthfeel is solidly built on a good malt background, with the carbonation playing it's part without bringing any attention to itself. The drinkability is terrific. Sweetness, bitterness, smooth and enjoybale with a lower ABV. This beer is just about everything I hoped it would be. And a little more. A case of this may not be enough."
"Overall, a good best bitter."
"This beer poured a copper gold color and formed an off white bubbly head that left circular trace lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An generous aroma of hops and some malt. A flavor of hops, malt and some buttery aspect to it. A nice slightly bittersweet crisp finish to it. Like the bottle said, it is a nice session beer. Great Lakes does it again."
"I found this at Wild Oats in Cincinnati and no other outlet in SW Ohio seems to have it. I wonder why? This is another good beer from GLBC that demonstrates the qualities one expects from GLBC. Good rich coloration, nice head development, decent lacing and a full nose. Once again, GLBC does not disappoint. Amber to copper body with a creamy buttery head. A good full body with decent ending crispness and moderate ABV make this an eminently drinkable session beer. Flowery hop nose with fruity overlays. Does this brewery do any beer that is not topnotch? This is not Fuller's, but it is very good."
