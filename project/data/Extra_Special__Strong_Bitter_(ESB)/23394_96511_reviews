"Drinkable. Amber in color. Little bit of hop profile to it. Goldings and Cascade hop variety. I like it."
"Nice Amber color, thin thick head, mild nose of malt with a touch of hops. Taste  is average. A hint of bread on the front with hops finishing this off. Overall an O.K brew"
""
"I'm guessing this sells more because of the label than the beer.  Its ok.  The beer pours a clear amber with white head that is leaving a spotty lace.  The smell is bicuity...and the taste is a lil sour/bitter.  The mouthfeel is lighter in body with poor carbonation.  Overall....its ok."
"Pours a medium amber producing 2 fingers off-white, shortlived head that leave a flecks & wash of filmy lacing. Aroma is thin; malty (caramel), faintly fruity & mildly acetic, with earthy & herbal notes (burley tobacco). Taste is watery malt, tart candied apple, with a hoppy bitter character up front that rapidly balances with the malt. Malt dissipates in the finish to a dry mildly bitter/astringent, lightly metallic aftertaste.  All of the British ESB I\'ve ever encountered are watery & thin. Muted aroma & flavor might best described my experience with this one."

"O: Overall this beer falls short of the mark..  you are paying for a label, not the beer inside. I heard good things about this one, so it's totally bummertown."

"Poured from a can, tastes like Old Style, even leaves a bad aftertaste."
"Overall pretty good, typical British ale style beer, nice malt profile, typical yeast profile, decent hops, although wish the hops came through a bit more, but pretty much right where it should be. nothing too special going on either though, just average ale."
""
""
"The pour was a murky chestnut brown with a light orange hue and a frothy off white head. It possesses notes of toasted malts, caramel, a hint of dried fruit and a light floral hop. This brew starts with a nice malty caramel flavor and a touch of fruity sweetness that lessens slightly, giving way to a mild hop backbone. A smooth, tasty and easy to drink brew... https://www.facebook.com/KAJIIsBeerReview"
"Definitely has the feel of a decent bitter although the yeast isnt all that clean for me. I like the idea but some slight refinement would go a long way."
""
""
""
"Eh. Really only worth it for the sweet-ass label. Big time Maiden fans would be wise to buy a bottle and just leave it. May I suggest they throw their name behind something wicked and bitter, as opposed to droll and tastless?"
""
"English style session ale, first class"
""
""
"Wasn't expecting much with all of the low ratings. However I really enjoyed this beer as it tasted almost like an amber ale which are among my favorites. Would definitely drink this beer again. Plus it's Iron Maide, come on!"
""
"I love this British Beer!"
"I'm a big Maiden fan so I was drawn to the bottle. Too bad what's inside didn't match the awesomeness of the outside. Muddy color, terrible head (giggity), not crazy about the honey taste even though I dig honey. Bummer."
""
""
"Exactly this: The body is watery with low carbonation.  Was hoping for more a more aggressive taste.  Not bad at all, just nothing memorable about this $5.99 pint.  Was surprisingly mellow and tame - best part was the artwork and history lesson on the back."
""
""
"really good casual drinking lager, plus its Iron Maiden inspired"
"O: I was very disappointed with this beer, you expect something aggressive or strong with a Strong Bitter style of beer, this one isn´t strong nor bitter."
""
""
"O: [2.75] This is just a timid beer.  The nose delivers the hope of something good but it ends there.  No real flavor or feel on the palate."

" The mouthfeel wasn't as nice as I hoped. It was pretty odd as it was both light and coarse. Overall, I don't think I'll buy it again but would be greatly appreciated as a gift."
""
""
""
""

"This isn't a beer that's trying to offer an intense experience or change your life, it's simply a traditional British bitter, and a very decent one at that. Definitely recommended whether you're a fan of Iron Maiden or not!"

"Nicely balanced a hint of toffee maltiness that finishes with a mild hop bitterness"

"Smells of caramel and citrus. Has a smooth taste with a hint of hops."
"The Bugle sounds, the charge begins! As a mop-headed teenager, I was a HUGE Iron Maiden fan, so I could not resist the opportunity to try this beer. I purchase one from time to time when I have a hankering for simpler times. Really, this is a decent British bitter. Nothing special, just a good pint like you would find on tap at any pub. I find the malt/hop balance quite pleasant, and the finish is nice and dry. This beer is best suited to cranking up some British metal, throwing on the 1980s concert shirt, and letting 'er rip with your mates."

"Overall - not a bit bitter, it's just missing some of the depth and complexity of others in the style. Worth a shot and has awesome iron maiden artwork to boot."

"While wearing a Trooper (beer) T-shirt.  While listening to ""The Trooper"".  Hellz yes.  Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber topped by a couple fingers of creamy light-khaki foam.  The nose comprises sweet berries, light green apple, mild biscuit, and flowers.  The taste holds notes of biscuit malt, mild grass, flowers, light stonefruits, and a twinge of green apple.  The body is a light medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.  Overall, a pretty damn solid brew.  I'm not entirely sure it lives up to the bombast of its same-titled song, but it certainly provides an enjoyable experience."

"First off, bought this as a novelty because I love me some Maiden!   Kept the bottle around a while, so I was not sure if the taste would be totally fresh or not.  What I will say is that all novelty factor aside, this beer rocks!  It is extremely smooth.  The right mix of carbonation, foam and lace mixed with a soft, aroma of hops.  Very well pleased and totally surprised by how good this beer is!  The taste is very crisp and clean and not bitter at all.  This is definitely one of the better surprises I have tried in a long while.  Hope to find more soon!"

"Pours a clear golden amber with a medium white head, moderate lacing. Aroma and Taste is grass with grain undertones, citrus and fruity notes upfront, yeast, bready and lightly toasted biscuit malt. A medium body, crisp with moderate carbonation. Finish same as taste with some mild hops bitterness on the end for balance. Not the best ESB but it slowly gets better as it warms up a bit. Overall still crisp and slightly refreshing, an ok brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is an OK ESB, but it doesn't really blow me away.  It's got a bit of a generic character and is just a bit too sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty decent beer. Love the label, too. The main problem is that it is all hop and no mid-palate. There should be more maltiness to fatten out the flavour but the hops are too dominant and the bitterness is a bit too much. It drinks well, though, and isn't a bad beer just not balanced well enough. Keeping the bottle."

"Pretty Decent beer even though label is way way better than the beer."

"Tastes better while listening to Iron Maiden."

"Dark Color.  Was hoping for more with this brew.  But hey, it's a band's beer."
""
""
""
""
"I expected a rather disappointing beer while looking through the other reviews. Well, it wasn't too disappointing, but it's a shame the flavor and mouthfeel didn't live up to what the appearance and aroma suggested. Okay for what it is, which seems to me more of a marketing thing with its Iron Maiden label theme rather than a really good beer for the style. Strong presentation but weak flavored."

"Appearance is crystal clear amber, with an appropriate head. Smell is nothing special, but for this style I don't expect it to be. This is an easy-drinking, well balanced British ale that tastes like a British ale should. An excellent example of the style, marred only by the high price tag."

"Overall an okay beer that is really easy to drink and even enjoyable on this hot summer day. Just so much better stuff out there. Really cool bottle and band nostalgia if your into 'Iron Maiden' even remotely I would definitely grab it~"

"Iron Maiden, will it have me screaming for vengeance? Let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a very bready malt smell. Pours to a deep golden brown with a three finger head that has a creamy top. On the taste I get a nice balanced slightly bitter solid brew that is common but tasty. Mouthfeel is solid. If any beer is a sessioner, it's this one. Nice ABV @ 4.7 and good ordinary but inoffensive taste. For an everyday drinker this one is a winner."
""
"Appearance is amber and the aroma is of malt and with a hint of lemon. Taste is bitter, and has a light aftertaste to it. Iron Maiden Trooper is a good beer, has plenty of character, but I found the aftertaste a bit underwhelming. I would say that Trooper is a type of beer that takes its time to get used to. In other words, the more you have have it, the more you'll enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by decent flavors and aromas."
"Ferocious brand and label, but a very mild and inoffensive beer."
""
"Poured from 500 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted June 2014."
""
""
""
"Overall: being a big Iron Maiden fan, I wanted this to be a great beer, but it is only a so-so ESB. At least the bottle will make the display in the music room..."
""
""
""
"O: okay beer, but not something I will revisit"
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of sweetness. Taste is kind of mild, malts, some citrus, very light hops, refreshing. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a decent warm weather beer."
"But it gets a full extra .5 points BECAUSE IT HAS FRICKIN' EDDIE ON THE BOTTLE!!!!"

"Tastes more like a Euro Pale Lager than anything else. I'm not crazy about it, but it would probably be better on a hot summer day on a deck. Worth a try."
""
""
"Half pint at 'spoons as part of their latest real ale festival. A dark amber colour with a nose which reminds me of peach but is also floral. An overly negative spin on it would say it sounded like an old lady's bathroom. The taste is rather a let down after that: rather soapy, reminding me of apples.The only plus point is a hint of nuttiness."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is rich. Overall quite a good beer, though its quite expensive for what you get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall fairly clean malt profile, lightly dry, flowery, easy drinkability, though not neccessarily exciting, can be a respectable light lager style drink with some hop appeal, but hard to imagine this as as an ESB."
"And yes, I'm going to keep the bottle. It's gonna be displayed on a shelf in the man-cave/brewhaus."
""
"Not bad, but not great. I'm not particularly experienced with many English style ales, so I can only speak to the overall taste and experience, rather than putting it in context against style. It's certainly not bad; I have no idea how it has been received in the UK. At 4.7%, I could drink this frequently if it were on draft, but I won't again shell out $5 a bottle stateside."
""
"a beer that is probably selling so well more because of its label and tribute to iron maiden than because of the beer inside the bottle, but the beer itself isn't at all bad, and is in fact a nice example of the english bitter or pale ale style. coppery in color with great carbonation and a sudsy white head. the grains come in ahead of the hops in both nose and taste, but this is a display of balance. mineral heavy on the grain front, copper and tin as it swallows, but the hops brighten it up and actually put a lot more fruity flavors into this beer than most of the traditional english buttering hop types. i most enjoy the feel though, which is robustly carbonated and creamy on the palate, very hearty and satisfying, and while the flavors aren't my favorite, i appreciate the session ability of this english pale. at under 5% its on i could drink quite a few of. still medium buried at least, and long finishing. good not great all up."
""
"Pours a bright, brassy color with a loose head of sticky white bubbles. Sweet, toasty toffee, biscuit, honey, cherry, and fruity yeast aromas with a bit of hops. Toasted grain, lemon tea, nuts, and a floral, earthy hop bitterness. Medium-light and dry, a little watery in the finish. Not bad...pretty simple and could use a better malt profile, but a solid little mellow ESB. I wouldn't mind trying it on cask."
"Scream for...beer!"
"I had high hopes for Trooper and had been looking forward to trying it (both as a devout metal head and a fan of the British brewing tradition), unfortunately I found it to be highly unremarkable and in general, highly disappointing. Will have to buy another bottle from a different source as I suspect this one was mishandled, the flavor was not consistent at all with a ""premium"" British beer, vague, watery, more aftertaste than flavor, closer to budwieser than beer with none of the complexity and well defined flavor reported in other reviews."
""
""
"O: An enjoyable session beer. Nothing offensive but nothing that stands out. lots of malt with just enough a woody, spicy english hop. /75"
"Overall: A bit watery with some less than appealing flavors in the finish"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

"Really could use a fair bit more carbonation."
""
""
"This is a really nice beer, but there's now way I'm going to pay $5.50/bottle when I can get a 6'er of Fullers for $10. Recommended if cost is not a factor."
"Flavorful, easy drinking, tasty, and refreshing. Ignore the ratings. This is a damn good ESB."
"The flavors are somewhat subdued but, that helps make this brew smooth and sessionable."
"Pours a clear copper color with foamy white head and plenty of lace. Aroma of butterscotch and toffee with an herbal element. In the taste, sweet toffee and caramel give way to a lemony citrus, lingering into a woody dryness. Lemon citrus, toffee, and wood. Dry tannic finish on a smooth medium bodied beer. Overall, this is a nice beer."
""
"UP THE IRONS!!! (and the beers pretty decent)"
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but there are better options within the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear copper-amber pour with a two finger off-white head with minimal retention with decent lacing. The nose is pretty typical for the style with lots of bready malt and caramel along with hints of butterscotch, apple, and subtle herbal hops. The taste is bready and malty with hints of butter, tea, apples, caramel, toffee, biscuit, and mild hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and buttery with nice carbonation and a subtly bitter finish. Overall, the label is definitely better than the beer, but it's a solid, sessionable interpretation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Just okay... and definitely not worth the price. Perhaps a decent beer to get macro drinkers away from budweiser etc."
"Trooper Ale isn't bad enough to have you for the hills but, like so much heavy metal, is something you grow out of pretty quickly. The odd surge of lemony, floral hops doesn't make up for the austere maltiness. The only head banging this tedious ale induces is against a wall."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer didn't try to be that. It wasn't the boozy, metal tasting dreg it could have been. Instead, it is subtle in all respects. Not over the top in any area. Just a nice beer to enjoy while telling your kids how the bands in concert today simply can't equal the days when big hair ruled the world."
"Bottle: Poured a light copper color ale with a medium size foamy head with light retention with limited lacing. Aroma of grainy malt notes with stales hops is not the most enticing. Taste is also dominated by unrefined grainy notes with some stale hops is not the most pleasant. Body is light with medium carbonation. Never been a fan of the music and it appears I am not a fan of their beers either."

"DATE TASTED: January 31, 2014... GLASSWARE: HopDevil nonick...OCCASION: a good week ends, and Shark Tank begins!... APPEARANCE: hazy whiskey-copper body; pure white, steady head; slight effervescence; intricate lacing... AROMA: smooth and malty, with wafting caramel; bright, punchy hops are less citric than expected ... PALATE: smooth, buttery and swift a Steve Harris bass line; a pleasantly drinkable pub ale...TASTE: sweet, nutty finish; subtle hops that fit into a British ale profile; soft lemon, chestnut and rum--complex enough to keep my attention throughout the glass... OVERALL: Not ""Powerslave"" in its power or ""Seventh Son"" in its complexity, this beer nonetheless rates somewhere in the area of ""Fear of the Dark"" or something more recent--a nice take on a classic style; the glass drained quickly...considering the middle-of-the-road price, I would revisit Trooper in the future regardless of the season--a good all-around ale...."

"Overall its just one of those beers with a kick ass cover art that draws fans of the band to try craft beer. Even though it does lack flavor it is not watery or metallic so points for that."

"Well, I'm a big fan of Iron Maiden, and that was enough for me to want to taste this beer, and for my big surprise it is fucking outstanding! I mean, it comes in a very cool bottle and all, but it actually tastes really good! It is kinda sweet, very smooth, and although the alcohol percentage is quite high, you can't get easily drunk with this one. Totally recommend it."
""
"Pours lightly hazy deep golden color with a good sized long lasting beige head the sticks a moderate amount of lace on the sides. Aromas of toffee and caramel with hints of butterscotch, a bit of light fruit and a touch of mineral and sulfur. The flavor is rich and malty with lots of darker sugars. Earthy and citrus hop flavor with a firm hop bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet mouthfeel. Decent English ale, I could drink this without too much of a problem."
"This is a light bodied ale and overall it’s ok, nothing seems to stand out but it does go down easy, a bit more flavor would be nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Ah well, I'll always have the bottle to remember this beer by. No seriously though, at $5, it's a terrible value. But if these were $2-$3 or so, I'd have one every now & again. Probably should have let it warm a bit more to get that ""British mild"" feel, but otherwise, a very, very average beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a light, copper-gold coloring with a filmy, sparse, white surface coat of head. Aromas of toffee sweet, tangy caramel, toasted notes, and floral highlights. Very sweet nose. Flavors are toffee rich and sweet forward, with a roasted backbone, some bitter undertones, and a very mild hops presence. There are hints of citrus notes at the very end of the brew, but more acidic than anything. Mid-bodied, but slightly effervesced by the slow carbonation, giving it a sharp, filmy feel at times. The aftertaste is more of the sweet and roasted malt notes. The finish is crisp, clean, and fairly unremarkable."
"I'll start by saying, being a huge Maiden fan that I bought this for the bottle. It could have Eddie's piss in it and I still would have bought it. Pours a brown copper color not much head. Smell is bread and malt, faint smell of hops. Smells like Boddington's to me. Taste is typical English ale. Biscuits, malt, not much hop. Kinda tangy, which is odd. Not a bad beer but not great either. Not sure Eddie would drink it. Up the irons!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty average brew - some diacetyl would have been nice as would have been the advertised lemon hints. It is nice to see Eddie's branching out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Not bad. Not great. Again, a decent session. The name makes it attractive enough."
""
""
"I guess this beer probably put Robinsons/Unicorn on the map and introduced them to a wider audience. Too bad the beer wasn't better."
""
""
"Overall: as expected, a very average / passable English ale that proves that one should avoid any beer endorsed by musicians. Not bad stuff, but certainly not brilliant, and the incredibly high price is simply laughable. All things considered, one to avoid."
""
"o: wasn't sure what to expect from this one, and i gotta say theres not much to it. there is absolutely nothing offensive in here, but it tastes like a pretty standard - if not weaker - ESB. cool label art, but nothing special inside"
""
""
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 40 degrees hoping I had something great. Uhhh, no. Not really at all. The beer was amber in color looked okay except for the fact it had noo head at all. The headless beer. The beer was flat tasting with a little bit of a malty taste. Nope not going to buy again."
""
""
""
"O -- A good example of the ESB that isn't Fuller's -- that is, fruitier and hoppier, not malt-forward. Also a good example because it's definitely the English brand of the style; no extra-added hops or Americanized alpha acid kick, very traditional and worth trying."
""
"3.16/5.00"
"3.75/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Deep hue, continually rising effervescence, slight head, and some solid spiderweb lacing. Nose is sourdough bread with a piney hop, and a woody component. Hops, bitter fruit pith, and dish soap all culminates in a steely shallow end. Overall, this is an okay quaff."
""
""
""
""
" The flavor of this ale is more of an ordinary bitter, not a lot of malt in the taste up front. The malt adds a sweetness to balance the slight piney herbal hops in the mix, but the yeast is the main flavor giving the bitter more of a mineral aspect and some spiciness but mild fruitiness. Overall this is a pretty traditional take on an English style, drinkable but more of a novelty with the Iron Maiden label. There are others that may be just as good or better. I found the use of Bobec hops interesting but there is limited citrus from the cascades."
"Taste-Toasted malt, faint mineral and citrus note, subtle hop presence to the finish. Pleasant, subtle and sessionable. Classic English brew, kick-ass label on the bottle."
""
"Overall- A good example of an ESB and a good session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Although i always considered ESBs a great session type of beer, there are many examples out there that ""spoil the fun"". I thought Trooper only had a pretty label, but it wasn't the case. More than decent ESB, great example."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As with so many great beers, if you try drinking this beer super cold, you'll miss out. Not sure this beer should be classified as an ESB; its flavor profile is more like a Pale Ale. Still, it's a solid rocker and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not the biggest fan of English ales but this is a good example of one. I can see this flying off the shelves here in Alberta with all the closet Maiden fans, that reminds me watch Flight 666 it's one of the greatest Rock Doc's ever."
"Was hoping for a lot more in an Iron Maiden beer. Good for the lovers of English ale that cannot get it close to the source."
"For an ESB, this does well not to embarrass itself, bringing the biscuit, and wielding the hops like a musket. Maybe a tad sweet for the style, and more generally for extended sessions, but agreeable enough as a one-fer, in the world of promotional or pop-cultural tie-ins...and, fade out with 'To Tame a Land'."
"Simply an average brew."
"Overall: Simple but sufficient if a bit pricey."
""
"Overall this what I expected: a solid English ale meant for drinking in mass quantity at a pub. Bruce would not put out a shit product and this was a solid English brew – not sure why it’s listed under ESB in BA as it seems more like an ale or rich lager to me, but either way it tastes and drinks very British. Nothing exciting, but easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: This required a double-check of the label. It clearly says ale, but this really drinks more like a lager. As an ESB (as listed here, I don't see that indicated on the label) it's even less appealing. It really isn't particularly good. Nothing I'd say you need to avoid, but nothing to even consider going out of your way for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a serviceable drink for sure, but probably not one that draws notice, save for by virtue of the label and name. A decent representative of the style, but not exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*Good overall British beer. Nothing that wowed me, but it is real nice and easy to drink! I'd love to see some metalheads at a Maiden show drink this beer, I just don't know if the price put on it would justify drinking it. In my necks of the woods in the US it was a little over $5.00. So in that sense, not good for what you get. But nothing wrong with the beer overall. It just was mostly like an ESB and not unique enough to stand apart from the rest."
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled on 7/9/2013. Pours slightly cloudy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of raisin, apple, caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and yeast notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, apple, caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast, floral, grass, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nicely balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with solid robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a nice ESB style. Well balanced malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
""
"Overall this one is drinkable and would likely go well with either fried food or sausages, perhaps a soft baked pretzel as well."

"Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson did, in fact, have input on this ESB. Clear and light orange color. Classic English hard water is immediately noticeable. A hint of sweet bread, then earthy hops bitterness. Nice mouthfeel and it goes down very easily. At only 4.7% ABV, you could easily knock down a couple of these during a show! Fantastic label with Eddie, as well. Perhaps I’m caught up in the novelty a little, but I’m a fan!"
"500 ml. bottle, amber colour and a good head that doesn't hold for too long, but leaves a good lace. Smell of caramel, grains and malt. Medium body that sticks to the tongue. Taste of caramel, the usual mineral hops of some english beers, and some bitterness in the end. Not bad, but very one-dimensional, maybe to please everyone, but a beer you drink easily."
""

"O: Definitely on the British side of an ESB. Drinking this more for the novelty of the Iron Maiden part, but it's actually a pretty decent ESB. $5 isn't too bad (at all) to get a sweet bottle containing some brew, regardless of how good or bad it is. If you're a fan of Iron Maiden, it's a good purchase"

"The reminds me of the Bristish Ales served in every little pub throughout London. Weak in body and flavor but with an easiness that serves a day of drinking."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer that was very true to style, it reminded me of some of the better English beers I've had with that really malty flavor and signature English Ale yeast. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth and the taste did an ok job at holding my attention, I think one or two would be enough for me, I think more than that and I would start to get bored with it. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it's just a good example of the style. What I liked the least about this beer was how one dimensional it was, I think a little more hops would add some balance and more complexity to this brew, I might buy this beer again, but I don't think I would get it often and I would recommend it to people who like the style. All in all I thought this was a nice beer, it simple and malty. I would think a darker more extreme beer would better suit the persona of this band, but this is probably the style they enjoy drinking so I can't knock them for that, This made for a decent first impression for this brewery and I'll be interested to see if they put out anymore Iron Maiden beers."

"For a bottled English ESB, this one is quite decent."
"O_Reminds me of one of my first attempts at home brewing. Pretty displeased with this offering."
"O- Not bad. A drinkable effort for sure. Maybe a bitt too sweet and light bodied, though."

"O: An ESB isn't exactly a complex style to begin with and Trooper isn't a super example of it. There are worse beers out there, but this one isn't very exceptional. Kind of a novelty. Presumably if you're an Iron Maiden fan you'll have a different opinion of it."
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a clear medium coppery amber with a half-finger fine white head with good retention and light lacing. Nice aroma of bready, lightly biscuit malt, light caramel and light citrus, a hint of hops. Flavor follows, milder than the aroma, with biscuit malt, lightly grainy, mild grassy hops, light citrus. Finishes with a brief amount of stone fruit and citrus, with light lingering grassy hops. Light bodied. A fairly standard light ESB with perhaps a bit more fruit juice flavor, but mild hops and malt. A bit too lightly flavored to be very interesting. A satisfactory light ESB that would not stand out without the Iron Maiden backstory. Kind of odd for me to have a heavy metal band naming a light, almost bland ESB, but I guess those guys are old enough to settle down and yell at kids in their yard. Just a little incongruous."

"Not even as good as the opening riff but not many things are."

"I almost ignore the ""Trooper"" moniker as all I can think is, ""Eddie's back!"". With his abrasive and ""in your face"" attitude, I was looking for a beer to suit. Instead we are merely rewarded by a pleasant and highly rewarding, crisp and refreshing ale. No wonder Eddie looks so pissed off."

"Drinkability- very good! I thought the fruit zest was quite refreshing plus Iron Maiden is one of my favorite bands! Great beer!"

"O: Nothing outrageous but nothing offensive. A decent drinking brew, but I really just bought it for the gimmick. If I was forced to drink this again I wouldn’t be unhappy."

"A bit of a novelty beer for those metal enthusiasts out there, you would think this beer would have been an aggressive imperial stout or something more extreme for a bottle donning an Iron Maiden Union Jack touting zombie Trooper. It's labeled as a premium British beer abv 4.7% abv. Nothing wrong with this beer, filtered bright copper ale with a nice light khaki head, leaves behind layered speckled lacing on the sides of my chalice. Aromatics are nice earthy cereal malts, with hints of pine and citrus from the hop additions. The fruity esters bring out hints of cherry, with caramelized sugars bringing some perceived sweetness as well. Flavor is okay a nice solid British ale, fruit adds some complexity a zing of hops but seems less cohesive and flavor forward than I enjoy. It's hard to knock it, but it doesn't excite me at all. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied a bit of slick hop oils left on the palate, but clean flowing carbonation washes most of any residual oils left on the palate away. Overall a beer I can't picture purchasing unless it was for my old roommate from Bangalore, India...he love British metal from this era...I miss Chaitanya Harimohan due to drinking this beer."

"16.9 ounce (500 ml) bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like bready malt, toffee, and some diacetyl. It tastes like toffee, bready malt, and some tea and fruityness. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a solid ESB. A little pricey at $4.99 a bottle, but it was still nice to try this one."

"O: Nothing special about the beer, but man, the label kicks ass! This one is going on the shelf."
"This ESB from Robinsons was alright at best. Nothing memorable about the beer except for the label."
"Overall a very good bitter, and it was fun reminiscing about my old metal days from the 80s whilst enjoying this one. You'll take my life but I'll take yours too!"

"Lively and almost interesting."

"An OK best bitter/ESB, reminding me of my 90's pub crawls. The harsh husk-like pulls down the rating a bit."

"Love me some Maiden.Poured into an imperial pint glass a clear rich golden with a thin wispy head that was gone in a flash,great color,dissapointing head.Aromas of deep caramel biscuit and hint of brown sugar,a faint green apple-like sourness as well.A light mouthfeel near being watery but not quite.Nice flavors for what it is,a subtle English ESB,caramel and buttery tones with a tinge of iron,the green apple notes come through again in the finish along with a light smattering of leafy hops.The beer is eh...ok,the band kicks ass and the charge of the light brigade was very heroic."
""
"O: This beer is really easy to drink, sessionable and has an excellent balance between the malts and hops. It is a good representation of the style."
"Up the Irons!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a classic example of an ESB - nice fruity malt flavors and aromas with just a light hint of hops. Easy to drink and enjoyable - I bet this would be really nice on cask...wish I was over in the UK getting this at a pub but alas I'm sitting at home drinking it from a bottle. I had to pick this up as I was huge Iron Maiden fan in the late 1980s and still listen to them when doing yard work."
""
"Bottom Line: Cool bottle! if your a Maiden fan this is a must have!!!"
""
"Overall - Garbage, flavorless, sucks. I bought this cause its a iron maiden beer but Jesus Christ did the band drink this first then agree on it or was it just them saying they can use our name and that's all they had in it. ALmost 5$ for one of the lightest/flavorless beers outside a American macro ive ever had. This beer sucks and F you robinson brewing for associating this beer with iron maiden."
""
""
""

"Okay, so I admit it. I bought this beer because of the Iron Maiden art on the bottle. ESBs are not my favorite style (I prefer American IPAs) and I do not have a lot of experience with them, but I found this one to be enjoyable and refreshing. I'm not sure it's meant to be anything more than that."
""
"I like to combine my favorite things in life, and I cannot wait to open this on the finish of my next ice-climb in New Hampshire. The next time I drink this, I'll be listening to Piece of Mind on vinyl."
""
"O: Ok drinkability but very far from the classic and original songs of Iron Maiden"
"Meh - a disappointment. Looks OK, but the aroma/flavour are dull and uninspired while the body doesn't offer much to sink your teeth into. Coming from Robinson's I suppose I should have expected this, but I was hoping that the Iron Maiden connection might make for a more uncompromising brew. Oh well. No need to rush out and buy it."

"This beer didn't really offer much out of the ordinary. It was pleasant enough but nothing stuck out and both the smell and the taste where pretty light and hard to detect."
