"This beer is not THAT bad."
"Foster's Premium Ale brewed by Foster's Group Limited, with an ABV of 5.50%  This brew pours out a deep amber color with a nice white head. I like the color of this brew.  The smell is rich with grains , malts, and sweetness. You pick up on a hit of hops at the end. Now for the taste it is bold, but rich with flavor. Foster's Premium Ale, has a nice sweetness to it. There is a lot going on in this brew.  I think this is one of the better Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB). Foster's Group Limited did a nice job with this one. There is nothing overpowering in Foster's Premium Ale. This brew has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice rich and bold. I like how this brew goes down smooth.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again."

"Ehh.  More like motor oil than beer.  Looks great in a glass, though."
"I actually am enjoying this beer. It poured a nice Amber color with a thick head that left lacing in the glass. The smell was average and the taste was better than average in my opinion. I tasted a little dirty grain hiding behind the malt and hops. Other than that, I'd gladly drink a few of these at the beach!"
"I honestly didn't expect this to be even worse than the lager. Utterly putrid macro swill. Fosters, Australian for ass."

"Overall: decent, but certainly not outstanding."
"Overall, this isn't anything bad. I'd rather drink a pale lager or some of the malt liquors out there than this. It is 5.5%, so it'll get the job done after 3 cans. But, I think some lagers and malt liquors have more consistency throughout a can/bottle. This one just had the weirdest bitter, grainy, yeasty flavor. It got better as it warmed, but I'd just rather drink the Foster's Lager. Foster's Premium Ale gets a 79/100 for me. It's not terrible."
""
"Aroma is a bit funky and grainy. Pour is nice clear light Amber with a full white head. Head dissipated quickly, but left attractive lacing on the glass. The taste is better than the smell, however, it is bitey and grainy. Best drunk ice cold, it becomes more bitter and less fulsome as it warms."

"This beer is purely a novelty. I picked one up at the store with that in mind, no high expectations. It looks amazing, has a nice, dark amber color. Everything else went downhill- smells like a 40 of malt liquor, tastes kind of like one as well, im not going to get into detail its just not worth it. Mouthfeel is a bit better than the taste, overall, I give this a 2.5 below average."

"I haven't tried Fosters before this ""oil can"". I was told this tastes just like VB (Victoria Bitter) another Australian beer that's hard to find in the US. I didn't like it. Too sour, too flat, no smell... I did not enjoy. Perhaps, I would like regular Fosters in the blue can. I don't think I am going to be trying that out anytime soon."
"O: I am really surprised by this one. Didn't think Foster's had it in them. At two dollars it's a good bargain. Might buy this again."
"Pours a deep copper gold with a thin beige head. Some spotty lacing was seen but just near the top of the brew when sipped. The aroma is of malts with some hops. Nothing special. The taste is the same with the malts right up from followed by a hint of corn sweetness and a slightly dry finish that was a little 'hoppy'. Overall, not a big deal."
"O - Got this for $2. Beats the snot out of the bland Heineken that costs a buck more. If you enjoy a pleasant, hoppy brew like me, kick back and enjoy!"

"Overall: The beer looks decent, but not much of a flavor profile."
"This is so not a Fair dinkum ""Premium"" and I bought 5 cans of this stuff."
"Like another reviewer said, this is better than their lager. I like the appearance; but the smell, oh my God! It smelled like the Florida Everglades after a rainy day, the taste was ok, mouthfeel a bit grassy and skunky. Yeah, overall; I will drink it again....nice lawnmower beer. And remember folks....keep drinking beer and support your local brewery. HOG"

"Overall: This beer is on the verge of being a really good tasting ale. It’s definitely better than the Foster’s Lager."
""
"This pours a dark amber color with a slight beige head. There is a slightly bitter/yeasty aroma. The taste is malty with a slightly bitter finish. The body was pretty average but the overall taste was pretty good given the rating. Quite a bit better tasting than regular Foster's."

"O: Worth a try.  Actually fits well within the style of ESB for what I know.  Premium Ale tries to be something more significant and meaningful but takes the fun out of the refreshing and mostly-mindless Foster's Lager.  I will say the alcohol warming was neat and memorable.  Perhaps St. Bernard dogs can replace their brandy casks with this cheaper alternative?"
""
"This beer is a cheap macrobrew import. Please keep that in mind as you buy it. If you go in expecting craft/microbrew quality, you are going to be disappointed. That being said, I was rather surprised at how drinkable and even enjoyable this beer is. It's basically an ESB, with a bitter but not too aggressive hop bite and some nice malty flavors. The smell is not so good, but everything else is rather better than I would have expected from the price ($2.50 for an oilcan where I live, and that's from a grocery store). If you're feeling a bit pinched in the wallet and can't afford anything better, consider giving this a try. It's miles ahead of the regular Foster's lager and no more expensive."

"Drinkability – As far as macros go this is a good deal. it’s totally quaffable, bitter without being overpoering, and very smooth."
""
"Oil Can from Spec's in Houston. This was brewed in Fort Worth, Texas under contract from Fosters. Pours out to a decent 1 inch head that falls to a permanent yet thin head with minimal lacing. Color is admittedly artificial caramel color added to give this ersatz ESB a golden-amber hue. Aroma is classic Foster's lager with bready notes and grassy hops and loud grains. Flavor is musty, crackery, and strangely boozy with a dry, honey graham cracker finish (don't ask me to explain). Mouthfeel is light. It appears they took a higher gravity, warmer fermented Foster's lager and doctored the flavor and appearance up a bit."
""
"After a long day of stress, anxiety, problem solving and working for the man I arrive home and crack open a 25.4oz can of Fosters Premium Ale. WOW.Life is good again. I'm not a connoisseur of beer but man o man I do like this stuff. After a can of Foster's Premium Ale I've got a nice buzz on and no harm done. Perfect taste. Perfect size. Perfect buzz. Perfect!"
"Overall I would recommend this beer for times when you don't want a super complex beer, but still want something you can actually taste. It's above quite a few other beers in it's respective price point, and I enjoyed it."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light-medium body. It leaves the tongue dry, especially in the center."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light body, medium effervescence. Nothing to really recommend this beer. At best it's ""lawnmower beer"". Their lager is better and I am not a lager fan."
""
"Overall, this is not an ESB. I think this fits more into the cream ale category with its low bitterness, light flavors, and light body. Not impressed, but I think it's better than regular Foster's."

"O: This beers seems a little more bitter compared to other beers in the style, but this isn't necessarily bad as it helps to mask the adjunct aromas and flavors."
"An okay yet spotty beer. The strange aroma really detracts from an otherwise great looking and decently drinkable brew. The pluses still outweigh the negatives, and for the price ($2.19 for the oil can), this is still a good bargain for a brew."
"O: I still love the fact that Foster's sells their beers in the oil cans - one of my favorite formats for beer even if the actual brew that comes in them is not great. I much prefer this to the traditional blue and gold can version of Foster's and it is easy to drink. Not a great beer but not as bad as I expected."

"Foster's Premium Ale (2013) - It simply cannot be Summer unless I have a Foster's. That's just the way it is for me. Though no longer brewed in Australia and imported (a few years back they switched to ""inspired"" breweries in Georgia and Texas) the taste is more or less the same. Thick creamy head mellows to good lacing. Straw colored with a hint of ruby. Light airy aroma. Barely there. Soft smooth mouthfeel. Caramel front taste. Malty bread. Wafts into coppery ale midtaste and then finished with a bitter ale finish. Sour and bitter notes linger. Slight copper and just a hint of hops spice. Very drinkable. Good hot day, hot night drink. Clean Aussie ale taste. It's Lager cousin comes in the blue can (this is green). The ""oil can"" supersized beer makes you feel manly. It's a marketing ploy, but I'll bite into it-- just has that feel or ""real beer"" though it is arguably the Budweiser of Australia. Either way, as a commodity drink it is enjoyable and just right for this time of year despite its middle of the road quality. 3.25 out of 5. Good."
""
""
"Yeah, not the best. But, I could imagine quite good on a HOT day and served ICED cold. Mine was cold, but it could have used another hour in the freezer... But, at $3/25.4oz can you really complain?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad for what it is. (I don""t take the ""bitter ale"" label/designation very seriously. This is an adjunct lager with a bit more flavor and color than usual). However, I would take it over any typical watery adjunct beer."
"Overall, this is not a truly offensive beer. It's quite light and drinkable, and for its flaws, it ends up being pretty alright actually. Struth."
""
""
"O/D - Bought this one for the novelty. Wasn't appalled, but definitely wasn't impressed and didn't find this one memborable. Didn't finish the can."
""
""
"O: alcoholic water anyone? This is actually 5.5 ABV.But none in the taste . Always give points for above average ABV. A tiny little bit bitter. Guess this was considered an ESB before the rise of the craft brew scene. A bit more malty breadyness and this would be a keeper. Not bad for a adjunct . The appearance was nice. The taste did not mach it.You need to be a beers beer drinker to like it in any way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer is somewhat refreshing, but it just seems a bit artificial. I won't seek this out again."
"Premium my ass!!!"
""
""
"Final Thoughts: If you want to know what a macro-ale tastes like, look no further than Foster's Premium Ale. Would I drink it again? Unlikely."
"the taste is perfect. lower appearance score is because of the can. I just phoned the company and asked for bottles. the rep sounded excited at the thought. could happen with some help. this is my first posting ever on this site. i am looking forward to that first bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
" It's light and not very pale. I am not a fan of IPA, but I do like Bitter Ales, and this ale holds up to my standards. Cool and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, pretty bad. Not horrendous though."
"I'll pass on having this one again."
""
"Overall: Foster's Premium Ale is an average beer. There is light carbonation with Foster's Premium Ale. The carbonation does not diminish with time. The alcohol content was not very strong. People who enjoy beers that conatain low alcohol should try Foster's Premium Ale."

"Drink- Meh, I know why I didnt review it before last night. I forgot I didnt want to drink it again. At least it was free. Hope the blue can is MAYBE a bit better."
"Overall – OK. If it wasn’t for the paper taste that comes to the tongue at the end it would actually be a beer I would go to on more occasion as a session, but since the taste is there, I would likely take something else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't great but its probably the best beer produced by this brewery. Not a bad deal at 1.99 at the supermarket."
"Taste: This is better then the smell for sure. It starts with that alcohol type taste but it changes to a slight malty sweetness that ends with a slight bitterness with not very much aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Overall, not the best ale in the world, but certainly drinkable and goes good with a nice Partagas or Cohiba. I enjoyed it."
""
"Overall - Geez, I haven't had a Fosters ""Green Can"" in well over two years, and now I know I've graduated into ""full-on beer snob"". I could smell the cheap ingredients from a mile away, and the taste was no different. Once upon a time I thought this beer had a nice, distinct bitterness; now I find it disappointing at best, laughable at worst. Overall, it's certainly drinkable, and has a good body and a decent sweetness, but if my review were a few years ago, I probably would've rated this higher, and I was drinking great beer at the time... which begs the question, has this beer gone downhill, or has my palate taken a considerable leap?"
""

"25.4 oz ""oil can"". Pours a really nice copper color along the lines of a microbrewed pale ale. I was going to rate this higher in appearance until I saw the words ""caramel color added"" on the side of the can. Kinda like cheating IMHO. I'm not getting much of an aroma at all on this brew, but there is some rather lively carbonation. First sip brings a sharp metallic bitterness, almost Saaz hops like, with a mild malty backbone, and a strong bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent, not heavy or watery. Overall, for a mass produced beer, this is well...decent. Not up to the standards of SNPA or Dale's Pale Ale, but I could see myself being quite content being at a cookout & washing down some grilled food with these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, it is simple and doesn't hurt to drink. Had it after a meal because didn't want anything too strong. Salud!"
""
"O: well, I've actually had this beer a fair amount of times throughout my lifetime and recently saw it for a $1.35 for a 25.4 oz can and thought, well I've never reviewed this beer, might as well sit down and see how she does. Not a bad beer, but not something I could have all of the time. However, I'm only wondering why this is an ESB, because it just seems more of an adjunct."
""
""
""
"O - Honestly for $1.50 a 25.4 oz can there are many, many worse options. Very easy drinking as a kicking around a BBQ or couch. Not exactly stunning but not bad."
"All things considered, I wouldn't rank it that much higher in drinkability than other beers...tastewise its just confusing. If you need to get drunk, its servicable with its 5.5% ABV. Drink ice cold and with something salty, like pretzels to work out a balance in taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer looks great when it's poured, but doesn't have anywhere near the character you'd expect. There's almost no smell, and other than a hint of malt, there's no taste. It's a heavy beer. It's not a thirst quencher, and it's too heavy to drink much, but having one or two with a friend would be nice."
""
""
"Nothing to brag home about though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Foster's Premium Ale pours a nice amber color, although it is aided by caramel color being added, as noted on the can. The head is pillowy off white, and actually sticks around for a while. There is a fair amount of lacing on the glass as I drink this further. This medium bodied brew has a nice malty taste, and a clean, crisp finish. A mild hop bitterness rounds out this solid offering. This is certainly one to try, and the oil can is a nice touch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes light and pretty bland, some crackers and bread, vague apple from the yeast. Seems more like an oktoberfest or Vienna lager. Dry aftertaste, sort of a foamy, thin feel. Overall it's not terrible, seems free of adjuncts, but it's nothing unique or flavorful either. No off flavors, just pure and simple beer. Likely an easy match with most foods. Not something i'd go for again."
""
""
""
"This brew poured out as a clear golden color with a fizzy white head on top. The beer doesn't have any lacing or anything to it. The smell of the beer is a little malty but nothing much else really stands out. The taste of the beer is slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is light and carbonated. Overall I wasn't too impressed with this brew all that much."
""
""
"goes down pretty good. probably one of the best beer i can find in my grocery store"
""
""
""
"O - I don't know why I chose to pick this up tonight, but I did. Kinda glad too. This isn't that darn bad for an ""over-marketed with a gimmicky campaign intended to appeal to off center hipsters that don't want to commit to actual good imports and micros"" beer."
"Not a great ESB but definitely better than your regular Foster's. It's enjoyable and drinkable plus it's in an oil can which can really add some manliness to a tailgate."
"O: Just average. Not bad, not great. Much better than their lager."
"Appears a pale copper color with a light white head forming thick and sticking around for quite awhile. Fine loosely formed speckled lacing around the sides of my glass. Aroma has cereal grains with some cooked vegetable notes with hints of caramel. Flavor pretty harsh flavor a bit of grainy sweetness filtered through some dirty husky malts. Probably a better idea to serve this cold out of the oil can than drinking it from a glass. More harsness cooked vegetables and everything unenjoyable in beer. Mouthfeel is thin bodied highly carbonated quite a boring experience. Overall not well made beer in any regards why drink this with so many craft options out there."
"Bought a 25 ounce can at the local gas station and poured into a pilsner glass. This is definately a better beer than the adjunct mainstream Fosters but I can't get past the smell of this one. Everytime I take a sip from the glass I get a mild fart smell. Otherwise the color, head, texture and taste is acceptable."
"Nice oil-can packaging. Pours nicely to an amber color with good head. Nice. Nose has some grains and cooked vegetable, perhaps cabbage. Tingly herbal hops mingle with sweet grain flavors on the palate. Some fruity flavors too. Wish I had left beer in can so it would feel cooler drinking this."
"I don't drink many ESBs so it's tough to describe, but when this is fresh, it's a great beer with bolder bitter flavors that can be had alone or to follow heavier IPAs. A big can of this is a great counterpart to a powerful IPA where most regular beers wouldn't hold up flavor-wise."
"An above average outing for Fosters, I will take this one over their regular lager any day. Nice pour with a light amber color and respectable lace that hung around for awhile. Smell was of grain and sweetness but a touch of caramel malt as well. Flavor is smoothe yet not too complex with a touch of caramel malt in the front and your standard astringency in the middle. Decent clean finish and balanced carbonation round out this brew. A simple and effective brew, nothing more, nothing less."
"Overall offers a good taste, not a deep beer in respect to is flavor profile but more than I was expecting which is nice"
"O: Good beer that goes down easy on a hot summer day. Much better than I remember or expected. When you need a manly beer to impress your buddies, this is it. The artificial coloring added does tarnish the image a bit but, no one reads the labels anyhow."
"O –Right on the can “ale with caramel color added”… well there goes the appearance, decent drinkability, do I think this really should be in the ESB style… probably not, I’ll place this a notch above BMC macros, decent flavor with decent drinkability, if nothing I preferred was available I would drink this again 3.5"
"O - not very good at all."
"Thanks, but I'll buy a beer that is ""colored"" through the brewing process. I should have read the label BEFORE purchasing it, as I never would have then purchased it."
"Pours a clear copper orange with a 2 inch off-white head that fades to a thin film. Random patterns and legs of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of grains, light fruit aromas, and a metallic essence. Taste is the same as the smell with the metallic flavor lingering on the aftertaste. This beer has a very low level of carbonation with a flat and astringent mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer but now I can finally say that I tried Foster's finally. I would not buy this one again."
"I think this is a great easy-drinking ale. I know most say it’s another crappy macro. Hey, I love a pungent and hoppy brew as much as anyone else, but occasionally it is nice to enjoy a simple beer without a flavor overload."
"The third entry in SwillFest 2011. It pours a clear amber topped by plenty of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises mud, bad hops, wallaby sweat, soap, and stale biscuits. The taste holds notes of toffee, dirt, greens, balsa, egg white, grass, and flowers. It's not as bad as the smell let on, but it sure as hell ain't very good, either. The body is a medium-light, with a light moderate carbonation and a an almost grainy feel. Overall, not a good beer all around, especially if you really consider this an ESB."
"This beer looks golden amber with some white foam that l think is deceptive because as I go to smell it the aroma reminds me of rotting kangaroo. This is not that great on the front. I'm scared that I actually taste hops in here. Though there is some biscuit. The rotten hops are getting progressively worse. I don't like drinking this beer. It's a bad example of the style...a very bad example."
"For those of you who haven't had this beer, you should definitely try it. I, for one, am not a big fan of overbearing hops. But while this brew is heavy on hops, it's also perfectly balanced with malts and sweetness. This is definitely one beer to try if you haven't had it. I really think BeerAdvocate gives it a worser rating than it's due. I mean, I know this isn't the place for macros - and I like macros - but this is the most full-flavored macro beer I've ever had."
"Simple, cheap and enjoyable. The oversized can makes it hard to get a good pour, but it is still a pretty good looking beer considering the price (about equivalent to bud here at $2 for the can) with a tastes that puts our macros to shame. An all around average ESB, but it might be nice to pick up a can to sip on while watching a movie with some popcorn or something..."
"Overall - I figured i would try this. Ive never had this before and have always wanted to since i was younger due to those commercials. Well if Fosters is actually Australian for beer, I feel bad for the Aussies. This un-enjoyable cheap brew leaves nothing to say except ""no thanks"". This beer feels its only made for college frat boys who want to get drunk. The flavor is generic and sour, not smooth one bit. I probably wont get this again. Also, the can has too big of a mouth hole. It's sure to cause drunkard sloppy spillage."
"D-Pretty easy drinking but not complex in the least bit. Reminds me more of an amber lager than an ESB."
"the bitterness leaves a taste in the back of your mouth, that is not interesting. in short its a bland beer....with no exceptional qualities that can be worth discussion!! out with the bad in with the good, its taste maybe be bland but leaves one with a buzz that makes on efeel on top of the world...."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied and briskly carbonated, and the drinkability is alright. Overall, not the best brew. I'd take a Foster's Lager over this any day, this is just too sweet."
"RJT"
"I love these gigantor CANs 'cause The Crack is massive, like racking a shell into a shotgun in a dark alley. The Glug CAN be problematic, however, due to the positioning of the opening a little further back than on smaller CANs. Sure, enough, I had some minor spillage along with a massive two-plus fingers of thick, tawny head. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was slightly sulfurous with some faint malt underlying. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a pleasant admixture of hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness on the tongue. It was not quite as balanced as the Wells ESB I had last night, but it was not bad, either. Finish was tending more toward sweet than bitter and I quickly realized that one of these at a sitting would be plenty. I might have a cooler full of Fosters Premium Ale if I wanted to stand out from the crowd, but otherwise, I am not devoting a whole lot of space to it."
"Not too bad for a $2.75 oilcan. I've had far worse, although I'd have trouble identifying this as an ESB."
"Update: I've gone back after over a year of further beer drinking experience and had to lower my score a bit. It is still a surprising gem considering the presentation. In my area, it is sold only in 25.4 oz single cans alongside budget beers and malt liquors, though for a slightly higher price tag. I've still never seen it available in 6-packs. It is many many times better than Foster's Lager could ever hope to be as well. However, it does have shortcomings. It tastes very very fake. While the astringency may taste perfect, it doesn't taste like it's necessarily imparted by hops. It could just as well be some artificial chemical bittering agent. I'm really picky about hops getting too up-front with their own flavour (and masking the beer's), so this doesn't bother me too much. The malt flavour is sort of oddly fake too, though. The sweetness, while once again in the perfect amount tastes oddly of red grapes just a wee bit, which makes no sense in a beer. I still don't find that offensive, but both of those things combined just makes this beer reek of fake flavours and a lack of freshness. However, I stand by my original proclamation that this is by no means a bad beer and for the price, is totally worth it every time. It is really a gem in the budget beer isle. I challenge you to give it a try."
"overall; a good drink but nothing special, a so so session beer but rather boring."
"Pours a nice clean/clear yellow color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger fizzy/foamy white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is grainy, ricy, with some malt notes. The taste is sweet, kinda malty, grainy. Light/Medium Body. Not a bad brew, but still would not try again."
"I drank this right from the can, so cannot comment on its appearance...the taste reminded me more of an American Malt Liquor more than anything else, with a strong hop presence. Not one I will go out of my way to find anymore--I was able to finish the can over an hour's time, but would not want a second one in one sitting."
"Overall it seems like they wanted to make an ale but ended up with a mediocre tasting Vienna Lager or something. I didn't hate it but not sure why they'd mass produce this stuff. At least it was cheap!"
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, although there are several other beers in the style that are better this beer isn't as bad as I had anticipated and would be an acceptable alternative if I were in a situation where this beer was one of a few limited choices."
"I think this beer isn't a very accurate type of ESB, but it wasn't as bad as I expected for a cheap beer, and from the reviews it seems to be better than Fosters Lager."
"This beer would be good if they didn't use the caramel color. You can see they use it and taste they use it. It pretty much tastes fake. Maybe if I never had a good beer before and didn't know they used caramel color additive I would think this is good but really its not. It tries to be something its not. It smells grainy with a hint of floral. The taste is just this oily fake caramel taste with the sharp hops. It tastes like a fake Boston Lager.... but in no way does this compare to that quality beer. I would rate this double if it weren't for this odd taste that beer shouldn't have. It has a mouthfeel that you can tell is off. I bought an oil can of this and finished the first glass but now that I have the rest of the can poured I'm thinking of not even finishing it and just grabbing another beer that's in the fridge. This is probably my least favorite beer I've had because of this odd additive."
"Not a bad version of an ESB. Nice fluffy white head on the glass with a very clear amber fluid. Decent lace and no real carbonation evident. Smell is light malt and floral hops. Not much presence. Taste has a bigger malt presence with a toasted grainy quality. A touch of metallic sourness that works here. Sweet roll breadiness flowing into floral hops. A bit of earth and a clean finish with a light bread and hop linger. Pretty well balanced with a tilt toward the english hoppy side. Feel is a bit light but nicely carbonated. Pretty drinkable and it gets better as it warms. A decent brew and reasonably priced."
"* sidenote: I don't read the reviews on here before or when I'm reviewing a beer, but I swear I thought this beer was a bit ""fake"" while I was sampling it. I come to find that there is ""caramel color added."" LOL!"
"Overall, this is probably one of the best attempts i've seen at an ESB from the ""big guys."" I just don't think that macro breweries do ales all that well... and this isn't much of an exception. I would, however, take this over regular Fosters lager any day of the week... or any other macro import lager, for that matter."
"drinkability: I could drink another. It's pretty good. After I drink one I always feel like I conquered a mountain. :)"
"D: Not very good. The weird bitterness doesn't do it for me."
"M & D - drinkable for the price. Not a typical ale. Someone mentioned that the color is due to added coloration but I missed that if it was in fact mentioned on the can. If so, maybe that would be the reason for the sweetness as well."
"EDIT: Immediately after reviewing this beer, I checked out the can and found the description, ""Ale with caramel color added."" In my eyes, this is cheating. Since this copper color was based on lies, rather than malt, I am deducting 2.5 points from the appearance score, bringing it from a 4.5 to a 2."
"This is the first and last of these I will be drinking. Not recommended."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a thick off white head and a little lacing. Smells of booze and maybe some barley. Maybe a little sweet. Tastes bitter and sweet. Really malty and very one note. Quite terrible a lot like piss. Mouthfeel is less than desirable. Drinkability is poor."
"This is a good beer, very surprising."
"Taste is sweet, malty and a bit watery. It's light and easy drinking. Overall it's a decent macro beer. It's refreshing though."
"D-Not very drinkable. I would never purchase this again."
"The taste was not very good. On the can it reads, ""Carmel color added."" To me that said it all. The taste was not genuine and like the smell it tasted manufactured. I did not taste the ESB quality in this at all. I would never under any circumstance purchase this again nor would I encourage others to try it. There are better tasting mass produced beers out there, skip this one because it is trying to hard to be premium."
"Drinkability- I could drink 1 or 2 in a sitting before tiring of it. Probably won't buy it again."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is slightly over medium. This beer is way off course for a good ESB. The hops are muddled, the inital flavor is odd, and there is a funky taste. There is no distinction in the beer and the odd aftertaste gives the beer bad vibes,dude."
"D. I kinda wish that I grabbed the Special Bitter but overall for this ""style"" its not half bad"
"Drinkability: Not a terrible beer, but nothing I would get too excited about. Maybe worth a taste, but not a second look."
"Not bad at all, good price at $2.50 for this oil can. I know I'll have another, somewhere down the road."
"Taste is better than expected, little malt, corn possibly with the type of sweetness, works, ok but a good bitter twang to it. All bittering hops feel to the beer. Little to evaluate mouthfeel wise, its a one trick pony, for better and/or worse. Cheap, but you get what you pay for to a degree."
"SkÅL"
"overall: a crappy beer trying to look like a craft beer but it fails hard. buy this again? hell no! I was coming into this with a memory of the beer being great this is no esb bitch creek is the way to go!"
"D: This is quite a good value at $2 for a 750, a beer to pick up on the cheap for sure."
"D: A perfect Session Ale that has a nice ABV to it. IF I had to drink a sub par beer this one would fit the bill."
"Kinda hard to pour out of this big ol' 25.5 oz. can slow from the start. Appearance has a nice amber glow with a thick slowly dissapating head and surprising lace. Smell of malty bitter graininess with a faint caramel note. Taste of thin watered down malts that brings out more of the hop that linger a bit. Mouthfeel has almost a medium body with good carbonation. Not bad or great, but a fairly easy drinker."
"This is a fairly tame ESB. It's watery with a sweet malt. I don't find it to be very bitter at all though. It doesn't taste like it has enough hops in it to get a proper bitter flavor. Overall this this ale is a let down. I doubt most who'd drink this would know it's supposed to be in the ESB style."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"What we have here is another beer that tastes great, is inexpensive and rewards me well at the end of a hard days' worth of work in the field."
"Pours out a dark honey color with a sticky 3 finger+ head of foam that sticks around awhile. Thick gooey lacing. Smelled like lightly smoked malt. Tasted watered down with a faint hop-malt tone. Not impressed with this beer. Drinkability was good with low carbonation and a slightly dry finish. If this is their premium ale, i will pass on the midgrade."
"Drinkability- This beer goes down easy. Mostly very boring and disappointing for this ale to be so light and similar to it's Lager sister. Never again, but everything gets a chance."
"Drinkable but sort of average. It has a lot of lager qualities, particularly the smell and taste. It is a lot better that the Foster's Lager."
"D: rather easy, putting the can down faster than expected."
"It is naturally dark in color is medium in carbonation. The smell is nice at firt with a nice smell of hops which finised to a metallic smell. It taste pretty decent it has a good mouth feel and finishes clean. Which makes it a very drinkable beer! As long it was on sale I would buy but not at full price."
"Cheers."
"From can no. JAN1810-E07020058. Sampled on January 9, 2010. The color of the pour is honey-copper with a very bubbly beige had that pops and fizzles and slowly fades away. Lively carbonation. The aroma has comfortable aura of sweet malts but also an off-putting corny and grassy scent. The mouthfeel is about medium. The taste is slightly bitter with a slight dry mild hop finish. I used to love this beer a long time ago before I got into the world of crafts. I am less awestruck now than I was then."
"Drinkability: Not as bad as it could've been but certainly nothing special. I'll have to try some other ESBs as I'm sure that this isn't a very representative sample."
"This beer was a surprise. Love the regular Foster's on tap and the oil can isn't a bad way to drink it (at least when poured into a glass), so I figured I'd try the Ale that apparently is only sold (in our area) in the oil can. I expected something less than I got. Nice color (amber with a lot of foam) in the glass, subtle malt smell. Taste was one dimensional bready malt with a hint of bitterness at the end. Surprisingly moderate mouthfeel and nice carbonation. All in all, a refreshing if somewhat boring beer. I finished the glass but didn't finish the can. One was enough and it was time to try something with a little more interesting flavor profile."
"D: If it weren't for that metallic note, this would be extremely drinkable. With the metallic taste, it still does all right. Would probably session it, though it is a bit on the strong side for that."
"Notes - OK mouthfeel but really just a plain old dumb beer."
"When I stopped for some brew, these baby's where $1.79 per oil can at the local mercado. So lets give it a whirl. Can is big, impressive. Bright red opener as to quickly identify where to open. Pours into a pint with a huge foamy head with nice pillow top. Colour is a light brown or a yellow with a brown twinge. Glass is too small. But then again it is Foster's. Smell is malty but macro-malty. Taste is malty but with a hint of bitters off the bat. It builds to a more bitter finish but is not overly bitter. The head on this brew is to be commended, it sticks to the end. The lacing is a work of art. Overall for this being a macro ale it is palatable and not too bad. I would drink again. Who else has a 25.4 oz can? The novelty won me over."
"Poured from a 25.4 oz. can. Has an amber color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is, well, missing for the most part. Some very mild malts. Taste is also a bit light, some malts, not a lot of flavor. Feels light in the mouth and has so-so drinkability. Overall a fairly average beer."
"Now if I could only have some more of those Emus and Swans from Down Under!"
"Cheers"
"This beer has a light amber color is clear and has light to medium carbonation. There is a slight head. As far as aroma goes I'm getting nuttiness, a bit malty and Carmel/ earthy ness. The body's light to medium and bears the flavor of slight Carmel blending nicely into a rounded hop taste that finishes in a marrying blend of hops and a hint of alcohol. A decent session sipper."
"Taste is very grape juice-like with a dry kind of sweetness, not unlike champagne. The hops provide some bitterness, but not really any flavor or presence at all. This is not a good ESB at all, hell, it's not even a decent beer. As much as I hate to say it, I would rather have a Foster's Lager than this foul concoction. I wonder if I can finish the whole can?..."
"Feel and Drink as expected. Nice flavor but atypical for the style. Tastes like a modified Foster's lager."
"Not a great brew. For some reason, though, I am sucker for the oil can."
"The mouth is thin and watery. Hints of caramel, but very subtle. Finishes bitter and drying. Not a whole lot in the flavor department. Pretty average beer that I will most likely never get again."
"D- the price was right, but i could have gone to trader joes with 2$ and come back happier. i hope that people starting to get into craft beers dont try this and get turned off to ESBs, its a horrendous representation of the style. my can looks different than the one in the picture."
"Ok - final summary; I'd take another if offered for free, or over an American macro lager, but that's as far as it would go. You're hurting if you have to add caramel color to a beer."
"D- Its OK. I don't know if I would buy it again or not. Its worth the money however."
"For $2.99 for 25 oz, this is a really nice beer when compared to other things in the price rang (BMC), yet overall all average."
"A barely adequate beer. Not much flavor, and the crappy mouthfeel makes drinking a can this big a chore. Maybe it wouldn't seem so bad in a 12oz can, I don't know, but there's no reason in terms of flavor to try one should I see one."
"Poured from the oil can, a messy pour, maybe it's meant to be drunk from the can. Looks really good, deep darkish amber with fluffy head that reduces to lace. Smells metallic and tastes the same, almost a sink pour here. I'll not seek this out, the last style I'd have guessed this was an ESB, usually balanced style."
"Oil can. Poured into a tulip glass because I wanted to. Not badlooking at all, medium amber body, large, three finger white head that fell relatively quickly but left some suprisingly decent lacing. Aroma is a bit of cookie dough, some light caramel, and a hint of floral hops. Smells pretty good actually. Flavor is where this one loses me. It's bone dry, bready, lightly toasted malts in the background and a small amount of herbal hop bitterness. Not bad, though. Medium-light bodied, average carbonation. This is definitely a very easy drinking beer. It's not a knock-out in the flavor department, and I wasn't expecting it to be so, but it's smooth and easy to drink."
"M-D- Just a beer. Foamy, regular old beer. Not to bad on the taste buds...but not a regular. Finished can but would go any further."
"Eh, I've had better. At least it's more drinkable than their flagship beer but not by much."
"A clear copper/amber color pour with a thick offwhite head that actually left a little lacing as it diminished.Aroma is grainy,a touch of corn a bit of hops and a slight fruit character I can't quite put my finger on. Flavor is suprisingly slightly hoppy,a touch of malt and an odd metallic note. Typical pale lager body,clean mouthfeel,short crisp finish,quite quaffable. Not a bad beer,had much better but not bad overall."
"Drinkable, but uninspiring. There are too many great ESB's out there to pick this one up again."
"The drinkability is ok, and a slight improvement over the blue can, but pales in comparison to a typical english ESB."
"Gotta drink the bad to appreciate the good, right? I dont know why but I saw this and thought, ""what the heck?"" Oops! This wasnt terrible but it was a slightly tastier macro, thats all. Appearance was copper with fluffy white head. No retention, little lacing. Smell wasnt terrible. Lots of straw, grass, and/or grain with some malt. Taste was pretty bad. Again, some malt, slightly biscuity, with some grain as well. Actually a bit of a ceral taste (dont think I've experienced that yet!). Mouthfeel was thin and light, but not as a light as many American macros. Overall drinkable if you have to. Nothing great but at least its not Corona!"
"Australia's version of a BMC product, mate"
"Good crisp malt taste. Very easy to drink, no real kick to it, nothing special but decent. Mild, sour aftertaste and very smooth."
"d 3.5 had very low expectations but rather pleasantly surprised. drank the whole 24 oz. can."
"D: another travesty in a fat can....sorry, I will take a different ESB. This guy felt like a heavy macro"
"D 2.0 - would drink it for free or it it's my only beer choice, that's about it."
"cheers"
"750ml can from the local Hannaford. Pours a crystal-clear light amber body with an impressive inch and a half of off-white head that persists much longer than expected and leaves some decent lacing. Biscuit and caramel malt sweetness with hints of citrus hops characterize the aroma. Tastes like caramel and biscuit malts, kind of a simple sugary malty sweetness. Flavor and body hint at adjunct use, but I can't put my finger on specific taste. Fairly light in body with nothing really offensive or challenging in the flavor make this a very quaffable beer. For the style, this is definitely about the most pedestrian and simple you can get, but as a beer, it's not a bad drinker and I wouldn't mind getting it again."
"mouthfeel is bitter, sweet malt, adjuncts add more sweetness, dry, crisp, slight creaminess - not bad overall but not amazing"
"MF&D - Pretty much what you would expect."
"Drinkability is low to moderate. It's not terribly offensive, but it's really not too good."
"This beer fails bad at being an ESB but I don't think it was the intention of the brewer to make an ESB so I'll be lenient with it."
"Overall not a very good example of the style. All I get is bad macro lager."
"Worth the price, which isn't much."
"This was a very disappointing beer, not only as an ale but also as a beer. The only taste was metallic there were no hops or anything close to making it an ESB. Definetly not recommended as a session beer or as a kick-around beverage."
"D: Not something I'd go out of my way for"
"Not bad..."
"Aroma is fine. Sweet bread pudding upfront, ever so slight tinge of hops at the end. Flavor at first was reviling! It was a bit strange to me. A light bitter hop that hits and dies instantly followed by a ton of maltiness. It's not overly complex, but I can taste some bit of fruitiness in the middle. Finishes very sweet, almost cloying. Mouthfeel is a bit off. Sort of a strange aftertaste that lingers after the sip. I don't think this beer is very drinkable. There is no way I could drink more that one of these things."
"Medium-bodied and refreshing, Foster's Premium is inoffensive, lacking distinction, and a very drinkable brew."
"The mouthfeel is kind of interesting. There is a moderate bitterness with a slightly numbing quality to it. Despite the poor scent and questionable additions, this beer is not impossible to drink. In fact it gets easier as you get closer to the bottom of the glass. Combine that with a low price and this is a great beer to get the party started."
"Overall, an OK beer. It has more flavor than the big-name American brews, but there is so much better beer out there. Go for one of the English or American ESBs instead."
"D- there are already 2 beers called ""foster's special bitter"" and although this is definitely a bitter, the can is different from the other pics and the abv is way higher. this can says premium ale AND special bitter, and the reviews from the others do not do this beer justice, therefore leading me to believe this is a different beer and that's why i'm adding it. just seems strange that foster's would brew 3 different ESBs but at 2.5%, 3.5%, and 5.5%, i suppose i could see the sense in that. or the session, so to speak. all in all a very surprising brew from a big ass can that quenched my thirst and left me wishing this was on tap at a local bar. IMO the only thing lacking is the aroma."
