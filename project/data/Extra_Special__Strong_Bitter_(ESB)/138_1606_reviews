"My absolute favorite! I used to buy the Bishop for $5.00 a pint when I lived in Japan. Can't seem to find it here in the US though :("

"Overall – This one is an absolute beast of a bitter! The sweet fruity front is balanced perfectly by the dark bitter back end and there is some depth to this I did not expect from a beer in a clear glass bottle. Sheperd Meame continue to surprise me."

"An execellent british ale with a relatively strong bitter and full of flavours"
""
""
""
"O. Really tasty beer, I'm impressed how much the bottled version tastes like on tap. Rich in malts and bitterness, yet very session able."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Very pleasant and easydrinking British Ale"
""
"Can. This fine beer has the typical Kentish Ale-look with the golden/red-brown color. It’s quite easy to drink even though there is a lot of bitterness in it. Slight taste of some tangy butterscotch and toffee in the aftertaste makes the beer more pleasant to drink."

"I loved it."
""

"Food match: Traditional English fare: shepherds pie and a Friday night biff-up followed by some hard slapper shagging/snogging... and crumpets."

"Overall a really good example of the style that differs from the Fuller's ESB by the flowery hops. It seems I love this style."
""
"Feel: Feels both smooth and fizzy at the same time when held in the mouth. My tongue started to tingle."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
"Very flavorful beer, balancing malt sweetness with a pleasant bitterness. Not overly complex, but it is assertive."
"O: Misses something in aroma and taste/mouthfeel could be fuller."
""

""
""
" Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
""
"O: Fairly wintery, not a bad ESB but not the best."
"O - Above average,fine ale."
""
"O - A forgettable beer. Other than appearance, I don't think anything about it stands out from the crowd."

"Typical english ale, similar style and feel to other Shepard Neame beers. Would be best enjoyed on a cold pommy day served slightly chilled to bring out the flavour of the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Okay mouthfeel and good carbonation makes an easy drinking beer that's easy to find though a little dull but decent."
""

"Overall a nice ESB with a fairly simple but well done malt bill balanced by the right amount of hops. It does lack more depth in the malt department and the carbonation could be lower to enhance the other flavors."
""
""
"D- definitely doesnt have enough sweeter richer malts on the palate to balance the toastier malts and hop bitterness and therefore be a top ESB. Carbonation also just a bit too high and that takes away from the smooth feel you want from the style."
"O: Very drinkable."
"A nice, easy to drink, standard issue British ale. The rich toffee note adds a unique depth."
"Easy drinking, with lots of earthy-spicy English hops character. Thoroughly decent for a mass market ale. But don't let it get too warm, because that's when the nasty off flavours come out..."
"Rerate: 500 ml clear bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.4%. Golden brown colour, big to moderate off-white head. The aroma has loads of toffee and caramel, also notes of malts, fruits and bakery. The flavour is nutty with plenty of caramel, some fruity sweetness, and a distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is noticeable. Original rating: (500 ml bottle). Kentish strong ale of golden brown colour, good head, malty aroma with caramel and oak. Nutty flavour, well hopped, ""raw"" in the edges (which I like). Would love to try this one cask conditioned!"
"Highly drinkable. This is probably my favourite ale from Shepherd Neame, and is the beer that springs to mind when someone mentions strong English ale. A good flavour makes it an drink for all seasons. Worth seeking out."
"Note also the harshness increases as the beer warms up."
"D - A solid ale that goes well with English food. Try it if you're in the area."
"Stay away from this one, regardless of what beer style you like. This is best reserved for Altar Boys, because they're known for enjoying Bishops Fingers - if you know what I mean."
"D - This is a top ranking English ale of the highest order, it has everything that you could need."
"Notes: Lots of tea, floral, herbal flavors. Very balanced flavors. Nothing overpowers and it is a little thin for me, but a good all around everyday beer."
"A good solid typical English brew."
"Pours as a deep red colour with a thick creamy white head and good carbonation. There is a quite sharp nose to it, with a hint of sugary sweet toffee beneath, and a noticeable yeast aroma. The flavours are quite fruity upfront, lots of sour berries. There is lots of bitterness in the flavours, a dry hoppiness and a carbonic texture. Nothing special, very average, and slightly underwhelming beer."
"Loved it in the glass and on the nose but not as convinced when I put it in my mouth. I think it's well made but just not what I like."
"A good solid beer, wish it was bottled in a brown or coloured glass though, it might help to keep it in good nick longer."
"This is a household beer at my house."
"A good English ale and mild hops character keeps this beer interesting. Even with the dry finish, it's still refreshing."
"D - 500ml seems like an appropriate serving. Goes down pretty easy. Low ABV, decent taste, inoffensive texture."
"M&D: despite the filtered & pasteurised form presented in a clear bottle (ouch!), the true quality of this famous fruity bitter ale has not been compromised greatly, fortunately. The body is full and the taste is well structured, and it still tastes absolutely light and refreshing. The only thing I don't like about the texture, of course, is the (relatively) high level of fizziness - a ""problem"" SN seems unable to address for a long long time now... Nevertheless, honestly, I'm biased for Shepherd Neame's ales, particularly this one!"
"Thin, mild, but pleasant."
"Overall, not a bad example of the style and definitely more of a traditional English take. Not bad stuff, and pick it up only if it's easy to find."
"Overall this is one of the better ESBs I've had. It is rich yet drinkable, fresh, clean, and perfectly balanced. There is a slight aftertaste well after the bottle I cannot place, but not unpleasant. Would go well with most foods I think... perhaps especially crumpets."
"Would drink again, but only after I try everything else . . ."
"I wouldn't make this and everyday beer but it was a nice change of pace from what i usually drink."
"Overall: interesting beer dominated by the bitter flavour. Too focused on the bitter side and not as well balanced as I could expect from earlier reviews."
"I drank this straight from the fridge, and it was only in the second half of the glass I could truly appreciate what a good beer it is. Not cheap, but certainly worth it for the quality."
"An excellent parting shot."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style ESB"
"I had a pint of this on cask during a recent trip to London. It's a beautiful rich amber colored brew with a thin dense head. The aroma is great...a nice malt backbone, a little toasted qualities, crackers, bread, and very, very slight herbal hops (if you search for them). The taste is equally satisfying: moderately dry, but with plenty of malt goodness in the flavor. There's a steady bitterness that settles in a quarter of the way through the mid-taste. Very little hop taste. Smooth, very smooth. Wonderfully fresh and drinkable. I could have many of these."
"I am convinced!"
"In my haste to get into this I overchilled it and lost the initial impression. The colour, though, is beautiful clear, clean copper with a creamy head that hung around leaving fine lacing. I must be olfactorily challenged because I am weak on aromas so I didn't get what other reviewers said. It's toasty and malty with a hoppy lift but I just can't pick any more detail than that. On the flavour side I found a perfectly balanced malt and hop; toasty again and a bit metallic back of the palate. I love the bitterness. Just right and great length with a lip-smacking finish. I must confess to being an ESB noob so I can't really compare with many others but I like this a lot."
"This is an English bitter with some attitude and unconventional hopping. This clear coppery ale maintains a white head that leaves lace behind. The hops are rather interesting, going beyond the usual Fuggles and Goldings into some more mineral-like notes. The yeast has a decided fruity flavor to it that carries into the aroma as well. The taste is quite heavy with biscuity malt and hop flavors. For only 5+% ABV, it is quite full-bodied. A second or third bottle would be most welcome, but it does not fall into the realm of the truly sessionable."
"A solid if unspectacular beer. Would definitely be interested in trying a cask version."
"Had this beer at my reliable Lord Moon pub in London. bishops Finger is a clear deep amber topped by a dense off white head that leaves excellent patterns of lace. Aroma is very mild but inviting. Very very smooth on the palate with subtle hopping over a solid malt base. touch of fruit typical of the brewer is present. Easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Tastes malty with a very pleasant dry bitter aftertaste. I really enjoyed this nice full-bodied beer. Could definitely have a few more of this, but since I live in Queensland I'll have to wait until winter."
"I wish LAX had places like this to grab a pint."
"O: Good, hearty ale. Big profile. Probably leave it at one I think."
"For me an average bitter, just decent stuff."
"Overall - I love the UK. We just don't get to see brews like this unless we go on a weekend cask expedition in the US. I could drink these all day and night. I do love the little bit of extra alcohol in this too!"
"That last bottle I had must have been a bad one, but this one was great. I'm sure i'll be greeting my fridge with another one of these sometime soon."
"D - Much better than I remember. A good solid session beer."
"The pint was very disapointing and seriously lacked any body. It had a very bland taste, with only a hint of fruity aftertaste that gave it any note. This was a very disapointing, watery beer. The fact that it did lack any body may result in this being a decent all night beer, but not for me, I didn't even finish the bottle."
"Appearence well intact: nice looking bottle, good colour and proper head. Foam stuck around and would leave good lacing. Shinning ruby-brown colour. Aroma is Kent hops. Could be stronger, especially considering the lovely scent these hops lend. Mouthfeel in the same manner, that is to say, developed and good character but somewhat restrained. Like it's trying to be too well mannered. Flavour is light buttery texture, some nutty notes. High-Medium bodied, some bitterness. The Kent malt makes up the majority of flavour. Tasty with satisfying finish. However, flavours seem to trail off. Taste kinda falls apart and really wears thin near the end. Carbonation is decent, but I think this would be better on tap. This is very much within the British manner, a beer full of character but still mild mannered and more concerned with being quaffable than bold or distinct."
"It's drinkable, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Clear golden orange color with a larger off white head thats compact but dwindles down after a few minutes. Tons of lacing along the glass. Aroma has an earthy base to it with a floral edge and caramel maltiness. Seems quite balanced and quite nice. Taste follows suit but adds more of a fruity character, apples and bananas. A slight buttery flavor comes with the earthyness from the yeast. There is a slight mineral flavor which rides along the whole time. The hops are always there, floral and fragrant, but they never really come out and shine. Finish is drying, a bit citric, with a slight english toffee sweetness. Well balanced and smooth. The hops and malts and yeast work nicely here. Enjoyable but not the most complex or intriguing beer out there. Still, I definitely recommend trying it."
"A wonderful pour gives a firm long lasting head (almost as in a belgian abbey brew) ... smell is exceptional well matured hops with hints of banana ... the taste is matching the expectations of the bouquet, offering some charcoal grilled tomatos paired with mango chutney and rye bread in the palate ... quite exotic ... a very interesting example of a strong ale ..."
"The best thing about this beer is it's appearence, an attractive gold and ruby colour. It had a nice fluffy head and a smooth lace most of the way down. However the smell and taste was less impressive. Had a sweet malty flavour. My associate said it was quite plain. It lacked a range of flavours. it would go well with sweeter foods like a tomato based pasta. Nothing special in the taste department but what the heck. It's a beer. nothing more nothing less."
"M - Smooth and mild carbonation."
"Had this on cask at a pub in Bath. It was a solid ale but a little on the uninspired side. It had a dark reddish color with an off-white head. It's smell packed way more of a wallop that the taste as it was rather full-bodied. Overall, the is a good bitter and very easy to drink. If I ever see it on cask in America, I'll definitely have this again!"
"The mouthfeel is very smooth, which is part of what makes this so easy to drink. Taste is a little bitter up front, with some plants, earth, and pepper. Very little aftertaste, and what's there is not bitter at all."
"Her taste is very alcoholic, roasted malt flavours, shy bitter, hoppy, malt is dominant in this beer and the finish is very dry. Some floral notes are present from the hops, but the malt take much more of the taste. A Piney taste is present and very oily brew."
"Bishops Finger is a good ESB. It's plenty flavorful and was a joy to consume. I picked up the only bottle that I've ever seen. I just wish I could remember where that was. I'm sure it's even better fresh and on-cask."
"This is a very tastey ESB that I highly recommend if you like English ales. Its maltier than most, but not underhopped. Unfortunately its in a clear bottle, fortunately theres lots of brewery and beer info on it."
"Bottle: Poured a clear red/brown color ale with a huge foamy head with great retention which is quite a surprise since all my previous bitter had no head really. Aroma of floral malt with some nut. Taste is quite enjoyable and refreshing with some robust malt, floral hops and some nice nutty and subtle bitterness at the end. Overall, this is an above average bitter."
"Golding hops, great hoppy aroma. Some barley initially. Pale copper colour with lace and aestheticly pleasant transparent bottle (keep out of sunshine!) Drying, tad metallic. Understated carbonation. Drinkable but a 500 ml. for 3 is more than enough."
"Not a bad British ESB, but nothing particularly stands out either."
"500 mL clear bottle, no best before date that I could spot."
"Good session beer. I'll buy a few cases of it next time. Bishops Finger pours a dark, wooden red colour. Stained mahogany? A huge, fluffy head appears that slowly disipated to about a half finger thickness. Still, thick and creamy, leaving lace down the sides of the glass. The smell, at first, is awful. Clear bottle, skunked beer. And this was a terribly skunked beer. However, after a few minutes of air, the skunk smell died down(or my nose grew accustomed), and I could smell the beer. Caramel, toffee, malts, sugar and flowery, herbal hops. The skunk smell was still their, but not nearly as dominant as that first initial sniff. The smell is probably worthy of a higher score, but because of the skunk smell, I must take it down a point. The taste is excellent! Light, nicely balanced, and a perfect blend of sweet and dryness. It almost tastes like caramel and honey spread over whole grain toast. Their is also a dry, herbal and flower taste in the end. And, because of it's light taste, I'd consider it a perfect session beer. Lightly carbonated, smooth mouthfeel. Definitely drinkable. As stated above, I must buy this by the case."
"Nice fancy 500ml clear bottle put a Dark copper-brown ale in My pint glass. Modest head but good lacing...fairly pungent aromas of fruit ( apricot) over a musty burlap undertone. Good malt spine of caramel malts upfront but it is quickly ballanced off by resinous pine-like hops that continue to get increasingly bitter until the finish where they leave a lasting metalic after taste....this is a quality bitter but these styles of ale are not my favorite so that bias may explain my overall rating....it reflects my impression that this brew has nothing unique to distinguish itself in this style."
"Overall: Not the kind of beer that I would normally go for but a pleasant experience none the less."
"Pretty good, this is the 2nd time i've had it and reviewed it and it wasnt bad i must say"
"ng"
"Got a bottle at the cafe in the Tower of London. Brown color with a thin beige head. Little lacing to be had. Very sweet aroma of malt, along with a hint of sourness. Medium body with an odd flavoring. It is mostly sweet caramel malt, with an underlying sour fruit and smoke character. The finish is on the thin side. Overall this beer is lacking in many areas but it is not terrible."
"Overall Impression: Dinged this one on the aroma for the inexcusable skunkiness. When will they ever learn? Brown bottles! An OK beer which is probably a delight on cask."
"Its aftertaste is quite simple at first, but grows into a large amount of bitterness."
"Well, this review should probably be taken in the context of the three pretty horrible Russian beers I had before finally cracking this open. My, what a refreshing change! Even the clear glass bottle didn't seem to effect the situation as I poured this beautiful clear copper liquid into my pint glass. A nice off-white contoured head built to just a bit more than a finger before settling at about one centimeter, which deposited some nice lace rings as the liquid descended. There's a nice strong malty nose with an enticing touch of flowery hops. The mouth is prickly and heavy. There's a good crisp malty opening, followed by a full hoppy bitterness that leaves a nice fresh aftertaste. Thanks, I needed that!"
"Not bad, a bit too dry and bitter for my taste, however."
"Impressive."
"It appears this beer comes from an interesting yeast, because there are little esters in the nose but some great flavors. But the point is that this is a tasty bitter/ale. Unfortunately watch out for it skunking before it gets to America, due to their use of clear glass. Must be unbelievable on draught in England."
"A stylistic mid-point between London Pride and Anchor Liberty perhaps."
"From Englands oldest brewery poured a bownish color with minimal head,kind of a funky smell almost skunked and a little musty.Taste is slightly fruity with some dryness in the finish,pretty drinkable but nothing spectacular.It's still nice to find ales from the island across the pond."
"Pours a deep copper color with a nice fluffy off-white head. Some trails and some spotty sticky lace. Medium sweet caramel maltiness. Sharp bitter and tea-like hops. Balanced, smooth, sweet and very drinkable. Nicely blended towards the end. Nice beer!"
"I drank this one in the The Wilton Arms pub in Westminster. It is a great ale but found it to be a little bland. It probably would have gone better with my fish and chips than what I did have. It had a deep ruby-brown color with some creamy head. It smelled very full bodied. And as I said i found the taste a little lacking but overall it was a good bitter and quite drinkable. I hope to have it again in the future."
"Looks very docile in the bottle. Pours a a nice, clear, dark amber color with a nice frothy white head which disapates somewhat quickly. While I did not get te same smell noted in other reviews, it was not overly very impressive and inviting as other beers. Very dry taste with a hint of chocolate. Overall, a mild bitter worth a taste, but not much more. I must admit, the name of the beer is more intriguing than the beer itself. I just hope it was not a Catholic Bishop."
"The nun's delight! Clear, bright amber with a reddish tint and a creamy head. (The aroma is slightly skunky). The body is moderately light with a gentle carbonation. The flavor is assertive with a strong malt presence and an assault of hops. The hops win out in the finish, leaving it dry and long lasting. Though it's not a very complex ale, it is full of bold malt and hop. An excellent beer to pair with English cheeses."
"Pretty nasty stuff. I drank it in England and it was still bad. Does not look appealing at all, no head and looks like shit. Bitter aftertaste, and smells like someone pulled the bishops finger. Yuuuuuuuck"
"Pours an appealing dark amber color nice pillow head that lingers for a bit then leaves a nice ring of lace. There are nice fruity aromas on the nose as well as caramel and or vanilla. On the palate the flavors really come through towards the middle, bold malt flavors, fruitiness, hints of vanilla, caramel notes, and maybe raisins too. Nice sweetness to it, excellent flavor, and really smooth mouth feel. This stuff is good, weird mixed reviewsIMO a good brew!"
"I think its Ok, but its a bit smelly. The body is thin, but theres some nice flavours of citrus, roasty chocolate in there, i think its OK, but theres better stuff from the mother country."
"Descent, but nothing special.  Slight maltiness, slight bitterness and a unsweet cider quality.  Overall,I thought is was a bit light.  I found nothing offensive about this beer, but nothing really impressed me either.  The best thing it had going for it was it was easy to drink, and the bottle is kinda cool.  Does not live up to the price though, that's for sure."
"Absolutely a classic English ale. Beautifully balanced malt and hop profile with a bit of an alcohol nip."
