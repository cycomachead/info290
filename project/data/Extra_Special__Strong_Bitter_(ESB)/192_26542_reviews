"Used to drinking this in my college town basement bar whenever it would drop into town."

"This beer has got the flavors I love in a beer, it has the toastiness  of fat tire and the hop flavor of an APA, I wish I could get it year around!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Clear amber nice head, weird malt flavors like fat tire and dirty earthy hops."

"Interestingly, it seems like every time I have this beer I notice more going on than I did the previous time--the first time I enjoyed it but I had difficulty distinguishing different flavors; the second time I could tell there was both a nutty taste and a vague ""something else... must be hops"" going on; and now, on my third bottle, I'm noticing all kinds of smaller details I never really did before.  It's so odd how this one didn't really stand out to me much on my first bottle, but by the third bottle it might just be my second-favorite beer from the variety pack.  I'm hoping that trend continues, as I still have one more left in the fridge!"

"A 12 oz bottle. A light terracotta liquid with a Creme fresh head. Light toasted biscuits and mild Belgo-funk fruitiness. Toffee tinged sweetness, herbaceous hops. Taste follows like a winters Fat Tire. Well balanced malt body with a dry graininess. Light caramel sweetness. Herbal earthiness with a light hop bitterness clinging to my palate. Feel is nicely weighted for winter with a light creaminess'. Smooth and drinkable it is a satisfying and delicious brew."

"One of my favorite seasonals."
"Pours a bright, shiny gold that is so clear!!!!!!. Head is real nice and marshmallowy, lacing is some of the best I have ever seen. Hops hit the nose first followed by some sweet malts. Taste hits first with the malt of a bitter , then finishes real nice with the Sterling and Liberty hops, creating a beautifully balanced beer. Not quite like any other ESB I have had, but still a very nice beer !"

"Not sure what is really ""winter"" about it, but it's a decent enough brew.  It has an ESB/Bitter character about it (and on the hoppy side), but it just didn't ""mesh"" well together enough to be anything great, in my opinion. Still in all, glad enough it was in the winter variety pack and to have had four bottles of it."

"This isn't my favorite winter warmer, simply because it's kind of light but still somehow too bitter for my taste.  If you like that, then give it a shot, but I prefer other winter seasonals more."

"Overall - For whatever reason, I just personally like alot of the ""typical new belgian"" flavors that I find from the similar yeast and malt profiles used in their beers - at least it certainly tastes like it. This in many ways is like an amped up Fat Tire, and that's not a bad thing in my book. I believe this is a seasonal release, check it out if you get the chance."
""
"An excellent bitter. Perfect for the winter with  solid malt bill"

"New Belgium 2° Below Winter Ale ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"O - A good beer, but a little disappointing to me when billed as a winter warmer/ESB. I think it could use more malt presence to provide balance and complexity. Still, it is clean, well-made and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- One of the less impressive ESBs I've had. It really is a difficult style to nail properly and bring out the subtle nuances. Nothing offensive going on though, so it doesn't lose out on too many points."
""
"If handed this at a party, I wouldn't turn it down, but I would not pay money for it a second time."

"Overall - i love that NB is bringing back their seasonals and this beer had a special place for me before every winter. Not a horrible beer, but there are lots of better winter beers."
""
""
"This beer was all over the place. I originally dug it, but it became too much like a toned-down Rampant Imperial Ale. I settled on a 3.75 overall rating, but it probably should have been a 3.50."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"I like this. Looks bland, but surprises you after every sip. A good bitter beer. Bready (did I already say that?) I like the apple notes. I could drink a few of these and be happy."
""
"Overall 3.75: Very good beer. New Belgium is a brewery that is hot and cold with me, but with this beer it is running hot (in spite of its name). Great blending of hops and malt and just a drinkable and sessionable beer. I would buy this again and would love to find it on tap."
""
"O: Enjoyable and a nice beer for a cold winter evening - reminds me of a slightly stronger version of the beers I would drink on cask in the UK when I was getting something stronger. Nice flavors."
"I don't see this as a particularly ""wintery"" seasonal beer, but it is a solid, tasty ESB. Happy to have a few bottles of it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, its ok, but nothing special. I'll have no trouble finishing the other 3 that were in the sampler, but I dont think Id but it again."
""
""
""
"Pours out a nice dark orange with a one finger white head with fairly good retention. Smells of fruit. I get some pineapple and orange when I think of what sticks out. Actually smells fairly nice. Taste is pretty mellow and turned down. Definitely a session beer as I bought it for that. Not very hoppy at all. I definitely get more from the malt bill here. Taste is hard for me to pin down but malt forward and not very hoppy. It's very drinkable. Wish I could get more out of this but it's not a big beer like I'm used to. Mouthfeel is pretty thin but it seems well for the style. Overall a better beer than I was expecting. Basically a good session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent approximation to a bitter, or ESB, or whatever New Belgium is marketing this as. I would classify it as a more hop-forward version of Fat Tire, which is difficult enough to classify by itself! I might have this again, but with Bass being so cheap, I'd probably stick to the authentic English pub beers."
""
""
"O- This winter ale has a ton of hop character and big malt backbone that really balance each other out well. Reminded me a little bit of a much maltier version of Celebration Ale, it seemed like the hop profile and hop bite was pretty similar."
""
""
"O: Again, this reminded me of Fat Tire but perhaps a lighter version. I do enjoy Fat Tire but I think I prefer the original to this version. I got this as part of the NB Winter 12 pack."

"Foam was white in color, thin and a little lacey. It had a dominate hops and citrus aroma with hints of anise and wheat. The color was a beautiful orange amber. The taste was a complete translation of the smell, a complete balance of hops and citrus with spices. Mouthfeel - medium bodied and crisp. Drinkability - not to bad. To me a simple balance of hops and citrus with some added flavors. Ok session."

"Friend walks in with a growler of this fresh from the Mountains. I jumps up and downs und serve it in my 2 pinter that looketh like the one pinter. Beer has traveled 15 hours and 3 finger head with a shit ton of lacing that lasts the whole day through. I mean the whole glass through. Nice copper body with perfect clarity. Sterling and Liberty hops with nice roasted malty warmth fill the nostril-domis. I predict this motherfucker is gonna taste yummier than chuck. It does, the hops and malts are balanced pretty near perfectly. Enough dry hopping that brings the horse-hoofed malt taste away and finishes with a super nice bright and dry Christmas green hop gremlin. Mouthfeel is light and very nicely carbonated, again balancing the malt hop bitterness. A great present from a special fwend!"

"This pleases the pale ale/IPA lover in me, but my taste buds are yearning for darker malts when you say ""winter ale."" However, as I strive to judge beers on their own, versus what I wish they were, it's hard to really complain."

"Overall I didn't like very much, but didn't hate either. It's one of those."
"In general not a bad beer from a good brewer but not something I would seek out again."
"FINE, BUT NO NEED TO SEEK IT OUT!"
"Nothing sectacular but still a very good. I would recommend trying this if the chance arises."
"A fairly decent drinker but probably not one I will await with bated breath next winter..."
"D. Very easy to drink because it isn't too sweet."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and rich. Overall a well made beer...a lawnmower beer for the wintertime!!!"
"My guess is that this one will be a love it of hate it for BAs. It had me at hello and then lost me in too many competing flavors."
"Overall this is an excellent winter seasonal and it took me many trips to the store before I finally picked up a six pack. Needless to say I drank the whole thing without any difficulty and was very glad to have finally tried 2 below out."
"Drink this beer."
"Good bitter ale, not great but very good, worth trying. Sort of mild."
"C"
"Good ESB!"
"D: The aforementioned body does not serve it well here. As it sits on the stomach strange. Could only have two."
"Overall - Hoppy Winter Warmer. Interesting beer. It's a beer that I look forward to having in the winter. In a sampler pack of winter beers, it will stand out and add to the batch. Don't know is I would classify this as an Extra-Special or Strong Bitter."
" Give it a try."
"Orange in color, pretty clear with some bubbling. The head is sticky and fairly tall for its style, with a pleasant craggy recession. Glass lacing is minimal. Aromatic with the nose deep in the glass, somewhat toasted barley note with an herbal hop character. The flavor is pretty mild, lead by a toasted barley and general earthiness. Hopping is quite faint, and somewhat herbal. A little too faint in the mouth and light overall to make a good impression."
"Well balanced, enjoyed this one, very drinkable."
"Overall this beer looks great, smells good, and drinks very easy."
"D: this is a very nice ESB, and one that I will seek out again."
"This beer I have seen on tap but never tried it. I went to the beer store and saw that it was available in bottles and decided to pick it up. The semell is fairly hoppy an to my surprise is pretty drinkalbe. It leave no aftertaste and is has a really good moutjfeel. This is a light but not to light beer that is easily drinkable. I highly recommend this beer."
"I had some of these during Christmas and was blown away. Nice hop flavor and use of light spices. I then saved a bottle for now, (About 2 1/2 Months Later). Im not sure if it went bad, despite the bottle's date being fresh. I really did like it which is why my review is above average. I felt like it was a lighter bodied, more hoppy Fat Tire. I'll be sure to buy it again next year, and also compare it to this batch. Like I said the last ones I had weren't watery at all. For those who say: ""Hoppy Winter Beer?"" Try Sierra Nevada Celebration."
"Very roasty malty flavor, finishes with a light dryness. Clean and smooth going down, not chalky at all. Notes of subtle spice, hard for me to distinguish any real predominant flavor, maybe its to well balanced?"
"D - A nice winter beer, as advertised. I would gladly enjoy another bottle, although it is not spectacular."
"Appearance is pretty awful for a winter beer. It's almost transparent, not much going on in the look. It is a dark orange color, nice head though, the head is the only redeeming quality. The head is fading quickly however, looks like it might be leaving good lacing. The smell is hoppy, hoppier than I would expect a winter beer to be. In the back end of the smell you get a tiny tiny bit of malt sweetness, not a bad smell though, pretty good actually. Wow, the taste is interesting, it tastes a little watery, with the hops trying to cover it up, I know that doesn't make much sense but bare with me. Like, the body is really thin and watery, and the taste is a little watery too, but at the same time there is a very present hop bite. Not much malt at all, you get a tiny tiny bit, but not nearly as much as I would expect in a winter beer. You do however get some of that winter warmer warmth from this beer, which is nice, you also get a taste of spices. Drinkability is average, nothing special there. Overall an average beer."
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter glass. Poured a clear dark amber color with rocky white head. Picked up aroma of floral citrus and and toasted white bread. Starts out with a dominant toasted malt bread bisquit and maybe wild flower caramel flavor. Has a medium bodied mouthfeel and will continue throughout, with that trademark toasted bread malt backbone. Nice dry hopped aroma of orange, but flat finish."
"Not something i would pick up often but i was a good break from my stout and porter stint."
"Very drinkable winter warmer, with an american hop touch. Good to sip next to a fire on a cold winter night."
"A great mix that amply combines the best attributes of a pale ale with a Belgian seasonal. Lovely and delicious!"
"FourthBeer potential: AVERAGE, as there are other good ESBs, but this is worthy of the New Belgium name."
"D: A mediocre pale ale from New Belgium, this beer exchanges some of the more assertive hop flavors present in their other seasonals for a double-dose of fermentation--from mixed fruit to detectable alcohol. The final product isn't really remarkable, coming across as a fruity version of Boston Lager, but it might make a good cooking ingredient."
"This is actually a pretty good beer, more of a higher end abv sessionish beer for me, not something I would savor of course, more something me and my friends might share a case of at a winter bbq"
"The malt is super complex with variations of breads, cracker, and simple caramel to make this beer a standout. The hops play their role but don't get in the way of the excellent malts. This is a must try if you like ESB's!...or any beer. I can't say enough about the malt profile."
"Had this one at happy hour at a BBQ spot in the Northwest Denver recently, and thought it was pretty solid. Poured a medium amber color with a somewhat rocky white head. Aromas of citrus, floral hops and caramel. Medium bodied, somewhat hoppy, with toffee and caramel on the finish."
"D: This is a very sessionable brew for the ABV content and the light bodied taste. I find this one to clear out of my fridge quick, that says something about drinkability."
"Foam was white in color, thin and a little lacey. It had a dominate hops and citrus aroma with hints of anise and wheat. The color was a beautiful orange amber. The taste was a complete translation of the smell, a complete balance of hops and citrus with spices. Mouthfeel - medium bodied and crisp. Drinkability - not to bad. To me a simple balance of hops and citrus with some added flavors. Ok session."
"D - It is very well balanced. Reminds me of an APA."
"D: Nice for a Winter session."
"A very smooth and surprisingly noy bitter for a bitter style beer. Great lacing, color is amber/light copper. some good grain, mild hops. flavor is noy unlike a regular amber ale, with less spice a bit less hop punch. Good body and carbonation. Quite tasty, but not a spectacular example."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer and would suggest it if you like a fairly strong hoppiness. It's nothing compared to some hop bomb IPA's or Double IPA's, but it's an enjoyable brew that accents one of beers great ingredients."
"D: Very drinkable, with its pleasant taste and fair crispness. The ABV might keep it lower."
"d - would not want to have more than one"
"D. Good, but not great. Another ESB that just doesn't live up to the bar Fullers has set. This oddly reminds me a lot of Southern Tier Phin and Matt's Extraordinary Ale..."
"D. Drinkable. Easy to have a few of these. Nothing amazing, but a solid offering. I remember it being more bitter in years past, as this bottle seemed a bit sweeter than in years past. Im not really a fan of the biscuity malt flavor that most of New Belgium's beers have."
"D) A Good example of the style."
"Overall, this was very good on tap and I would definitely drink it again."
"Overall, not a *bad* beer per se, just not up to par with what I hold NB to. Doesn't taste like a winter warmer, to me, at all. Go for it if it's at a party or you're really curious, but definitely no reason to go out of your way to get some."
"This is not a winter warmer. Some may be expecting that but it is in fact a very nice winter ale devoid of many of the spices some might expect...no cloves, no nutmeg, and an ABV south of 7%. This is a very drinkable beer that I will revisit next winter."
"Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation. Nothing to special here. I will not seek this out again."
"It is a good session beer that is not particularly strong or bitter at all."
"Orange-amber with a white head. The aroma is fairly hoppy. I get some pine and grassy hops as well as some toffee malt. The flavor is much maltier than the aroma. I get a bunch of toffee and some nuttyness, as well as some grassy hops. Very low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice, malt Extra Special Bitter that is very easy to drink. Nice to see a winter ale that isn't full of spices."
"D: overall underwhelming. The nose was very muted, the hops I didn't dig, and it had an odd mouthfeel."
"Orange color, pale white head, good lacing. Smell: sweet, honey, malts, slight hops. Taste is smooth, more sweet than bitter, but there are a some hops to compliment the malts. The mouthfeel is about right - smooth, enough fullness to keep things interesting, not overly carbonated. It's a very drinkable beer."
"Best before February 2011. Pours out a deep copper gold with frothy head, lots of effervescence. The smell is vaguely hoppy with some strong biscuity maltiness. Taste is dominated by malts and some crisp hop aftertastes. I would agree with some other reviewers that the hop profile is more ""grassy", than your usual citrusy or piney, and some alcohol is meddling in the background. The beer is a different sort of balance than usual, it could be throwing me off that this is an ESB rather than a winter warmer or IPA. Mouthfeel is full but not too rich. Hmm, not a bad beer but nothing knocks you except for the high ABV."
"The first thing that hit me at first gulp was the maltyness...almost to the point of tasting like chocolate. Thankfully, there is no flavor of clove. I'm totally in love with this beer and am very glad to add it to my list of daily options"
"Pours a clear golden/copper color with a medium white head that diminishes rather quickly. Aroma is grassy with hops and light malt. Taste is initially malty, then gets followed by some sweet hoppiness with grassy notes and citrus. Mouthfeel is very nice. Very full and crisp at the same time. Drinkability is high."
"I don't understand why New Belgium is calling this a winter seasonal.  It's not especially malty, and it doesn't have an unusual twist like most holiday brews.  However,  it's a good beer.  If you're throwing a holiday party, this would be a good beer to include as it should appeal to those who don't want a big malty or spiced beer."
"Served from bottle to beer mug, The appearance and color was clean and clear medium amber. For a head , well there was not one, plenty of carbonation though. The taste was good not great, you can really taste the hops a plus, and for drinkability I could drink one after another."
"D: Really good. I am a little hesitant with New Belgium beers but this one really delivers. Way better than most of their line. Worth checking out if you can."
"It's a light copper color, producing a boat load of foam that leaves prominent lacing. The aroma is of light hops and a touch of wheat, not too much else. The taste had some hops that seemed strong but didn't have much punch to them, like only a very small amount were used. The body is ok, the aftertaste is decent, it just seems a tad passive. It could appeal to non-BAs because it isn't overly complex. Overall, nice"
"Overall this beer is definitely a drinkable beer. Very smooth on the palette and not to one-sided on any aspect. It's not an amazing beer to me but one I would drink again. Great beer New Belgium Brewing!"
"Pours a nice deep but clear amber color, but only a thin, foamy head forms on top. The aroma is subtle, with only a faint bready malt profile and the slightest hint of a spicy hop presence. The flavor is more defined, with the bready malts again being the primary character with a seemingly light (but still noticeable) addition of hops coming in on the finish. Maybe it's my imagination because this is marketed as a winter warmer, but the character of the hops makes this beer drink as if this was a (mildly) spiced beer. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but otherwise fine. Overall, this is a fine beer, but it doesn't do much to stand out against other winter seasonals."
"After shoveling that driveway, you would really enjoy this beer."
"Overall, it's pretty average. Not the first thing I would go for on a winter evening but it is drinkable."
"D-wish the nose was how the beer tasted. not my favorite"
"As far a seasonal ales go, I will probably look for other, more interesting beers."
"I liked the New Belgium beers that I had tried in the past, so I expected this beer to be good; however, it was MUCH better than I could have ever fathomed. The complex flavors, excellent balance, and adequate body make this an outstanding beer to enjoy during the coldest months of the year. As the style suggests, this beer is both ""extra special"" and ""bitter"" - I urge you to try this if you haven't done so already."
"It is a pretty good winter seasonal. A solid ESB here. The creamy nature of the beer is awesome and while I'm not sure if it is the signature diacytl of an ESB, it's delicious."
"I've been on a New Belgium kick for the past couple of days since I picked up a Holiday sampler for a party and no one drank it. I am not overly impressed so far - decent enough stuff but nothing really stands out. I still have a couple more to try - maybe I will be surprised."
"Bottle poured into a mug. A beautiful medium amber color with a generous head. Lots of lacing. Smell is hoppy with a nice spicy undertone. Smells a bit like cloves. I could smell this all day! Taste is also really good. Hoppy, but balanced, and with a nice warm spicy finish. Reminds me a little of Great Lakes Burning River pale ale, except this has way more spice in the taste. Interesting brew, and very drinkable. Mouthfeel is just right...not to light, not too heavy. Even with a little higher alcohol content, I could easily have several of these. Nice winter brew. I would definitely recommend!"
"Drinkability: Enjoyed this 6-pack with a friend, won't be going to buy for a very long time but am always a fan of New Belgium and all they have to brew."
"This isn't bad, but fulfills my expectations of New Belgium's mainstream grabs. I don't have a problem with them making accessible beer, but I know to grab something else."
"Overall, I don't think I'd have more than one of these. Unless the alternative was water."
"D: The light carbonation and good flavor make this a very drinkable beer."
"Overall: I thought I might like this better than original Fat Tire. However, this does not have the same depth. It is good though."
"Nice light amber color with a full, white head that recedes to only a minimal lacing within about 5 minutes. Alcohol in the nose, with strong, pungent hops, some cinammon and nutmeg spiciness as well. Taste is quite dry, with a leafy hoppiness, slight earthy and bready taste, and some definite yeast character. Not much spiciness in the taste, as compared to the smell, nice malt/hop balance going on and some alcohol in the aftertaste. Very light, watery mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is quite high due to the overall light nature of this brew, the alcohol seems a bit overpowering at times though. Interesting beer overall, nice change of pace considering the other winter concoctions out there."
"D: Too much emphasis on the yeast for me and a touch too sweet. Probably won't be seeking this out in the future..."
"Had this on-tap at the New Belgium location in the Denver airport. Pours a golden orange colour with small white head. Caramel and biscuit malt with some some very mild herbal hop aroma. A fairly sweet beer. Big carbonation made this a little bit harder to chug the 2nd half of the beer as I had to run to catch my flight. I didn't realize this was an ESB until going on here to post the review, but that makes sense for the beer."
"NOTE: This beer is very mellow and subtle, but carries lots of good character. It is NOT the sensory overloader like many craft beers out there. It has nice flavors and smell that interplay well together."
"Drinkabaility: I gave it a 4 for a great beer that just has a few too many flaws to be a 5."
"Tawny colored with a fine white head. Toasty, biscuit malt aroma with a little citrus. Flavor is toasty and bready, almost doughy, with a light toffee sweetness and hints of maple and vanilla. Slick mouthfeel with fine carbonation. Hops are unobtrusive and lend balance and a hint of herbal tea. Smooth, complex, and highly drinkable. A really finessed, well crafted beer--whatever the style-- and fairly underrated in my opinion."
"Overall, a very easy drinking winter warmer, with some very nice hop character. I could have used a little more from the malt, but this is still pretty yummy."
"Good stuff. Poured into a mug. The aroma is medium, and of a typical ale, but with a piny hops note. The head was only 1 finger, and dissipated quickly. It was a medium gold color. The taste starts out with a good ale flavor, and then a few extra spices thrown in, followed by a medium piny taste. The hops, although, obviously present in a good portion, did not produce much bitterness. This is a very drinkable beer. Think Fat Tire with less malt, and mor hops."
"Finger plus of heavily whipped up and dimpled foam, cream white in color, almost all medium to larger bubbles, wispy traces of lacing streaks here and there. Transparent, completely see-through liquid of yellow gold to flat amber hue, close to complete absence of bubbles within. Bakery-like nose of honey, brown sugar, pastry flakes, nutmeg and cinnamon, orange extract, even something like cola, some yeast but no funk, the yellow apple, pear, peach, white grape fruit fit into the whole unassumingly, suggestion of bitter grasses before finally dissolving. Medium-bodied, most of the weight front-loaded, there's sweet granola, cereal, bread grains plus the honey and molasses, cinnamon and nutmeg. The orange citrus slightly candied without being a big factor. The carbonation too fine, foams to no specific purpose. Solid core of peach, pear, apple fruit, maybe seems fruity because there's nothing especially ""bitter"" about this beer. The finish isn't weak per se, more like the flavors and textures just lose whatever unifying force they had at the start. Nothing wrong with its drinkability if you want to pound uninteresting beer."
"I liked the single bottle I had well enough, but I don't think I'd order any more."
"My first impression was...tastes like a ""fat tire", But, this has more hops and bite and spice to go with the sweet malts...a very good brew!"
"It's cold out, but I doubt it's that cold. Still, this guy pours a clear copper topped by a nice finger of light off-ecru foam. The nose comprises flowers, light grapefruit, white grapes, light lemon zest, and a touch of sugary caramel. The taste doesn't deviate too far from this appointed route, though the caramel is stronger, acting as a nice chassis for the fruitier notes, and the flowers also accentuate themselves. The body is fairly light, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a nice brew, nothing quite special, but very easy to drink."
"D: Easy to drink, whether it's cold or warm outside. Light and refreshing."
"Notes - Although a decent beer I couldnt see myself drinking more than a few of these. It taste good but not enough to keep me wanting more. Worth a try if you come across it"
"D: Good drinkability. I got this in there winter mix 12 pack and the 2 Below is always the first to go. One my favorite New Belgium beers, probably behind Abbey."
"This is a really solid beer that I could probably drink 5 or 6 of and forget that it was 6.6% I sure wish New Belgium distributed to Pennsylvania."
"M/D: Not sure about this beer being an ESB. There isnt much fruity flavors to justify that label. Still, this is a beer worth trying once for the unique hop flavors."
"Nice beer. Good brewery. Some seem to shine on drinkable, others on big beers. New Belgium seems strong on the former."
"D- I'm a fan of this beer, definitely a decent ESB. Perhaps a bit light in body though."
"D - This is an interesting beer to be sure. It's not really marketed as an ESB, more like session ice beer. However, the ESB style seems to fit. It is quite tasty regardless of the context and it does go down easy. It perhaps lacks a little complexity to be truly outstanding but it is well done."
"Not bad, not great. To me, lacks the body of a true esb, although the flavor profile is pretty close. Served with a nice, foamy, frothy, off white head that lasts a while and good lacing. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is malt, a bit nutty, toffee, & caramel. Flavor is like aroma. Body is good, ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of short to medium length. Better review for closer to style."
"very nice session beer....with all the right bitterness that you'd like to see out of an esb....all around well done!"
"This is a nice variation within the brand and of similar consistency and quality based on the ones I have had so far. I would order this before some of the other NB brews, but I still liked the Hoptoberfest from NB more...I think...we can't find any more so it must be the season has ended for NB Hoptoberfest this year."
"D - Initially enjoyed the hops and bitterness on the way in, regretted the thick and sticky aftertaste. Overall it had the look and smell of a good esb and enough abv to do some damage, but just a tad sweet to really go nuts on."
"Drinkability - quite decent brew. Not terribly complex, but a good taste in general."
"Clear copper with a thin, bone colored head. The aroma is spicy and herbal hops with some bready malt notes. Caramel and bread crusty malt flavors with some nice earthy hop spice to keep it interesting. Medium light bodied with aggressive carbonation. A different brew but not bad at all."
"Pours a light amber in color. The initial aroma is pleasant but soon generates a bitter smell. The first taste goes down well and the mouthfeel is not bad at all. Then, it almost develops a bitter taste with each taste after that. It is a well-bodied beer but it is not one high on my list. The finish was good but not anything to write home about."
"Pours a bit thin in color for a typical winter warmer, but not a bad light copper color; huge and wonderful head with great lacing throughout. Nice malty aroma with hints of orange peel and nutmeg in the nose. Very nice flavor, a great sweet maltiness with wonderful citrus and spices (orange, nutmeg, a bit of cinnamon is mostly what I'm getting, and maybe mace). Goes down very smoothly, but with a bit of a funky aftertaste, although I can't tell if it's from hops or a spice."
"Crisp but medium in body, and a little tart for an ESB but not sour."
"description but I don't get any of that at all, mostly a lot of roastiness and a little bit of metallic taste as well. Just another below average that was a freebie from my N. Belgium rep, thank goodness"
"Pretty decent beer, out of New Belgiums winter pack it and 1554 are probably my favorite. Definitely some better ESBs out there that are in the same price range though. So not sure I'd try to buy a six pack of it, but it was nice to have in the winter pack."
"BTW: PROPS to my BROTHER Pat in California for letting me know this is a GREAT beer that packs a whollop. BRO-HEM!!!"
"Overall, this is what i might consider the perfect winter/holiday beer to session."
"This was my first ESB. This beer is even more indicative of winter than Magic Hat's Howl. It was smooth and easy drinking. Since I drank it straight from the bottle, I do not have much to say about the appearance. I will be buying a six pack of this seasonal gem before the winter is over."
"D- Two sips and it's already hitting me as a bloat beer. The flavor and experience isn't pulling me to withstand the bloat that I am envisioning."
"D- Very nice and complex. Mellow and nutty throughout with a slight sweetness. The sweet and hoppiness are very nicely balanced. Very good winter beer."
"Although not very complex, 2 below provide the drinker with an enjoyable session due mostly to its impeccable balance and drink ability. Definitely a great choice for fall and winter nights."
"This beer pours a light and bright copper in color with three-quarters inch of head which laces the glass. The aroma is hoppy, brassy, strangely almost a hint of fishiness. The flavor is hoppy, firmly founded on a nice malt, and follows the aroma. Flavorful, yet light and brassy. This beer is intriguing. I am interested to try it again on another day and double check my impressions."
"nice flavor, starts with a crisp bitter, mellowed by a sweetness before some grapefruit and spicy hops roll in, followed quickly by the earthiness from the yeast (i believe). the hops linger on through the end, the toasty malt character staying true, too. lots of flavor going on, mostly working well together. it actually might be better a month from now with the hops mellowed a bit into the beer, perhaps better integrated."
"drinkability is so so - with so many other great seasonal beers out this time of year it would too easy to pass this over"
"But the joy quickly fades. Aftertaste is bitter and the overall effect is a very mild, unimpressive drink. I'll put away a couple of these with dinner, but they aren't a beer to sit back and enjoy."
"Pours a very transparent brown color with a one finger white head that leaves a little lacing. Smells of malted caramel and a little of hops. Taste reflects the smell, but has a little bit of a coffee bitterness in the middle and end that surprised me, . Has a medium body and medium carbonation. I am still unsure what style this beer is, but people who enjoy a winter beer with a bitter finish should give it a try."
"D- This beer is drinkable...and I mean very drinkable. The ABV on the beer is well hidden with the alcohol coming through more as beer warms. I am very impressed with this beer...very impressed."
"drinkability good. this is a very nice beer."
"2010 12 oz. Bottle. ""Dry hopping during fermentation creates a bright hoppy palate and a cherry warm afterglow"". 6.60% ABV. 32 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Alt Winter IPA? Dense lacy lasting off white head. Clear rich bright dark gold color. Delicate floral hoppy mild fruit front. Crisp tangy dry sweet rich Golden Ale mild caramel doughy hint Winter IPA flavor. Clean mildly earthy bitter hot hop end. Subtle Winter Ale notes. Sampled 10/14/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $7.00 @ PCC--Fremont on 10/14/2010."
"My initial drink was biscuity, with light caramel notes. Leaves somewhat of a hop finish. Somewhat floral. But not much lingers on the tongue after its down . Its not a bad beer, just expected a bit more. Drinkability is above average especially @6.6% abv."
"Is it a winter warmer is the classic sense? No. Is it good? Yes. Is it a good beer for winter to my tastes? Borderline but definitely unique and worth a try."
"D - Overall this was a pretty good beer I enjoyed the taste and it was pretty easy to drink worth getting to try sometime"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid beer that is worth pounding down for a long period of time."
"D: Ok, what is this beer? It is pretty good, but what is it? BA says ESB. NB says winter warmer. Neither of these really seems to be spot on. To me it seems more like an Oktoberfest done in a big bad way. Malt profile seems to have good does of munich and to be germanesque overall. The hops are Liberty and Sterling - Hallertau hybrids. The bottle label describes a lagering process. Both quite malty and quite bitter, and bit toward the hefty side. An Ofest for the after, after, after, after Party?"
"Notes: It doesn't have nearly the amount of flavor that I was expecting. I love ESB's but this one falls a little short. It is better than average, but nothing great."
"Medium-bodied with a fairly smooth mouthfeel. Overall this is not really an exciting beer, but it's well-balanced and enjoyable. Drinkability is good."
"This used to be one of my favorite winter beers. It seems less malty and more harsh than past years."
"D- Not bad. A unique beer, interesting combination of characteristics. Nutty, bitter and stronger than most session beers."
"O- I'm not sure if this is not the best stored bottle or not, but I'm not a big fan of this beer (could be the style too)"
"The mouthfeel is definitely oily and leaves a slight cling."
"D= very drinkable, would be great for session especially if a tap was flowing."
"Brownish-orange color with a decent amount of rocky, white head. The aroma isn't offensive but not all that great either. Not much complexity. All I really get is a bit of hops and a fruity, almost raspberry quality. They lost me on the first sip. The hops come through in unpleasant ways as far as I'm concerned as there's an almost metallic bitterness. Needs a lot more malt to balance things out. The fruitiness from the aroma is still there but it tastes like watered down berries. Light body, pretty unremarkable mouthfeel overall. In general, this one was very forgettable and not one that I'd recommend. I think even Fat Tire is better than this one and I'm no fan of FT. Pick something else."
"I do like the dry finish and nutty aftertaste, which atones slightly for a flavor that leaves me wanting. In all, it's a nice accessible beer, on the sweet end of ESB and really more of a nice, comfortable warmer. But among Winter seasonals, there are far better. It would add considerably to 2 Below if New Belgium were to shovel in some more malt and hops, to boldly go where NB had only safely gone before with 2 Below."
"I could drink this all winter- as the mild hoppiness suites my palate."
"As I drink it the hoppiness is starting to grow on me some but this still isn't hitting the spot for me. Better than I initially though but still pretty average, and I love a good bitter or ESB."
"Tastes like - like an Amber ale with more hops. What more can I say? Nothing spectacular about this. Interesting to drink seasonally."
"D: Very easy to down several of these. It had a good clean and dry aftertaste. I guess my biggest surprise was that this beer was an ESB (one of my favorite styles) because I thought I was buying a more ""traditional"" winter warmer. Even after reading the label I still didn't know this was an ESB. After my first taste I realized I really liked this beer. Then it dawned on me that...wait where's the cinnamon and spice? This ain't no WINTER WARMER! IT'S AN ESB...SWEET! Hey, New Belgium, this needs to be one of your regular offerings. I think I'll grab a case or 2 before this is gone."
"Drinkability: Interesting hybrid type beer. I am going to steal the ""German ESB"" term from BuckeyeNation (although I like it better than him), as it seems to have Marzen qualities to it. It also really seems as if they add Heather to it. Good, not great, beer overall. If it wasn't for the aftertaste, it would have been better."
"Onto the next beers in the Folly Pack from NB"
"D: The alcohol is moderate, which makes it easy to drink. It's just not a terribly complex beer, but certainly not bad."
"Would love some more if it were more readily available in Ohio. A greatly balanced session beer."
""
"Overall, this is a easy drinking beer, which I would expect from an ESB, but come on - where are the hops man! Hop bill needs to be reworked to get more Bitterness, Aroma, and Flavor. Malt although tastes good, needs to be punched up a bit more, they have a good base, but there needs to be more of it. But I could easily throw back 4 of these while watching a game or something."
"D. It hides the alcohol well but too average to drink too many."
"D: A drinkable beer, if you're into ESBs. Not a particularly complex brew, but good enough."
"drinkability: I was very suprised and really enjoyed this beer. Not a hoerum but fefinitly a solid selection."
"D - I've had this a number of times and it's never received that well by others. All cause of the hops. The makings of a good winter brew but overshadowed by grass clippings. My opinion...this will probably be my last encounter with the 2 Below."
"Well, it was definitely nice to sit down and review a beer again after a week's worth of sickness. And even nicer to start off with a fine beer such as this one. I look forward to the days when New Belgium finally enters the Philadelphia market (the day will come eventually). This one may well find its way onto my shopping list when the weather starts getting cold."
"D- Pretty drinkable. Maybe the most refreshing beer I've ever had. The powerful citrus combine with the bitter hoppy kick quenches a thirst like none other."
"[Drinkability]: Very drinkable."
"Poured into a snifter, left 1/2"" off-white head. Pretty nice lacing going down. Smell is very nice, like fresh bread, grains and a good amount of maltiness w/o being sweet. Taste is a little surprising, there's an unavoidable artificial spiciness that I guess is supposed to be wintery. Not really my bag. The more I drink it the more it becomes evident in the smell. I read another review that described the taste as being like redhots candy. That is EXACTLY what this tastes like. Eh. Mouthfeel is medium, typical carbonation. Drinkability is so-so; if you like this taste you would want to drink more I guess. I'm not a fan."
"had on tap at burger jones in a 12 0z NB goblet..the pour was a clear copper color with a medium fresh head and clinging lace..the smell is malt toast caramel and hops.the taste is hops in the mouth with some citrus some nice malts with bread and toffee in the background very crisp and fresh ..this is one good winter seasonal (ESB) it is on the lighter side both in color and taste... none the less is was very good..recommended"
"Drinkability is moderate. The flavor profile is a bit uninticing at times which doesn't bring me back for another sip. The ABV is moderate, but well incorporated so it doesn't sway me either way. Just a ""meh"" beer for me."
"Drink ability was good. Pretty sessionable beer with a nice alcohol kick. Pretty odd choice for a winter beer but its a good substitute for all the dark ales that pop up this time of the year."
"The palate opens mildly bitter with a combination of hop and burnt whole wheat toast bitterness before the brown sugar and a light molasses character come in. Mildly spicy, I swear I taste nutmeg, but it could be the combination of the alcohol and the bitterness. Drying on the finish with a grainy astringency, this medium-light bodied beer has a high level of carbonation . Solid stuff, I'm not sure I'd drink an awful lot, though."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0910-TimL"
"Not bad, rather easy drinking beer."
"Quite drinkable. A bit boozy. One or two of these on a chilly night would be just right. I'm a poet and I don't even no it. It's been a while since I've had an ESB and this one makes me want to seek out more. Very nice beer."
"Drinkability is decent, but flavor could be better."
"d- i was very much looking forward to tasting this beer, but it didn't live up to my standard at all, the redhot - fake cinnamon flavor was offputting, which is odd because not many of the reviews for this beer mention cinnamon, but thats definately what i got out of this, kinf of a let down unfortunately."
"Pours a fairly orange-amber color with a moderate white head that doesn't stick around too long. No or minimal lacing. Aroma has that roasty malty note typical of New Belgium's offerings. Taste is of roasted malts, caramel, and a slightly bready or woody taste. It's decent, but not really exceptional - the interesting notes of this brew can all be found in Fat Tire, which is a better beer all around, IMO. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin for the style, but medium overall. Appropriate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but could be better."
"Looks more like an amber ale. Dark amber. Good carbonation making champagne like tiny bubbles. Aroma is woody. Taste, malt predominance, a little hop presence that can't resonate on the palate because of the assertiveness of the roasted malt. Wood flavored almost to the point you would think there was minimal aging inside such a vessel."
"O: Not my favorite from NB but it's harmless and enjoyable, especially if you're a fan of malt-forward or Scots styles (I still don't get the ESB labeling). Try this one with roasted almonds or maybe good Mexican food."
"Got this on draft at the Mellow Mushroom in Columbia, SC. Pours a clear amber with a 2-finger light beige head. Medium lacing. Smell is caramel malts with some grassy hints. The taste a mix of honey, caramel malts, and grassy hops. Not that bitter. Mouthfeel is crisp, medium-bodied. This is OK in the drinkability dept. Not as spicy as I would have expected."
"single from Whole Foods Cary"
"If I was not on a mission of trying as many bars as possible, I would have had another. But, alas..."
" Not to knock New Belgium too hard; their Mothership Wit is pretty tasty. Keep at it fellas; you're showing improvement."
"Pours a clear coppery amber with a fine-bubbled, slightly orangy off-white head. Aroma is malty, fruity and slightly spicy. Lively, mouth-filling flavor is spicy with woody and hoppy undertones. Texture is tingly, fizzy and sassy. Definitely worth at least a try."
"Not sure what I would compare this beer to in terms of style, but man, it goes down smoothly and tastes good. That's what the majority of beer drinkers are looking for, isn't it?"
"Pours a high clarity golden yellow maybe a hint of amber. The head is tight and foamy, nice lacing down the glass as well. Nose is very sweet and fruity, the hops are intermingled with the sweetness which is a nice effect. Taste is also pretty sweet and sticky hoppy. Not too bitter, but bitter enough. Malt backdrop is nice as well."
"Serving type: bottle"
"a seasonal ESB, eh? not bad but unremarkable. solid contribution to the ESB discussion"
"Poured into pint glass. Amber colored and very clear with a short white head. Teh head fell away quickly. Smells of biscuity malt and lemony floral hops. Tastes of bready malt with strong hop finish. Well balances. Mouthfeel is medium with good level of carbonation. Drinkability pretty good."
"Mouthfeel is ok, it's light bodied and has an ok bitterness and carbonated bite. That being said it's only slightly above average and doesn't really shine with true character. It is what it is, and that's a solid pleasing beer but nothing special. Worth trying but I won't be buying again."
"D- Easy to drink, not heavy like you would expect from something designated as a winter beer."
"Overall, this is a easily drinkable beer. The ABV is hidden and the flavors balance nicely. It is something I will enjoy a few times but would get tired of it until the next year comes."
"D: Very easy to sip on and goes down quite fast"
"D: good clean brew. Nicely balanced and something i could drink all night. Good, not great, but good."
"D: No great drinkability I would probably look for something else."
"New Belgium's release in the Myrtle Beach area has been marketed towards gateway craft beer drinkers. You don't expect any extreme hop blasts or malt bombs or alcohol kicks with their beers so I wasn't expecting anything other than a nice holiday beer. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with the hops up front with the sweet malt body followed by a nice clean finish. Definately more character than I expected. Not too heavy, and has kind of a belgian trippel vibe to it. Gets better as it warms and is very drinkable. All in all, a very decent offering."
"I actually thought it was 2 below at some point when i was drinking this. Yes it was cold outside. Actually I wasn't surprised when I read the alcohol content on the side being at 6.6% I could really taste it at one point and was getting a little worried but it got a little smoother as I drank more.."
"Very nice brew! If you are fan of hops but don't like to 'chew' them through your beer experience, give this a shot. Very enjoyable and recommended."
"I prefer IPA's over this, so I probably wouldn't buy it again. But the sixer I have is going to be a pleasant experience, regardless."
"Another strong brew from New Belgium. Good for the winter season. It warms up the gut!"
"This is worth trying as a seasonal. It would not make my regular rotation. It drinks easily for 6.6 ABV."
"Notes - Much closer to an IPA than I expected. It's similar to Sierra Nevada Celebration, but doesn't seem quite as balanced to me."
"The mouthfeel was smooth with medium bitterness and high carbonation. The hoppyness limits this one for a session beer, one glass was just fine with me."
"Medium-bodied with med-high carbonation. Not my favorite of the style, but an OK offering. It is one of my favorites from New Belgium."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a Unibroue tulip. Best by March 26, 2010. One inch of soapy, fluffy white head rests for quite a while atop a golden body. Aroma is of of fresh piney hops and some light sweet malts. Taste has some nice hoppy bitterness in the front and a touch of sweet malts with some light spicing. ABV is not noticeable whatsoever in this extremely pleasing winter ale. Extremely thick mouthfeel, kinda strange in a clear beer but noticeably thick. Pretty nice beer across the board."
"Pours a dark yellow, light orange from the bottle. No haze at all in the glass. Foamy head disappears fairly quickly. Smell is sweet malt and light hops. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and bubbly. There's something interesting up front in the taste that I'm not sure how to describe--it's pleasantly earth, almost pungent. This is a very drinkable beer. If you're looking for a winter session beer, this would make a good choice, I think."
"d - not too harsh on the palate, but pretty boring taste that could use some kind of a hop presence to balance out the maltiness and breadiness a bit"
"12 oz. Fairly bright orange pour, some white head. Nice malty aroma, some citrus and christmas cookie. Taste has some malt herbal tones, but an overwhelming cardboard and metallic flavor. Finish kind of blah, some fading maltyness. Body is fairly light, nice carbonation though. The cardboard/grass like flavors are really hard to get by."
"Drinkability- Tasty and overall nice. But, in my mind more of a spring of fall brew. Not enough body and too much hop for winter style. Like a hoppy Fat Tire."
"Overall I was surprised by this beer even being an ESB when I ordered it and more surprised at the hop levels. A solid, if nontraditional, ESB."
"Drink is OK. Not a fave, so I wish I could have bought a single instead of a 6. I remember having this on tap a year ago March, and I thought it was MUCH hoppier and smooth. Just an average offering and the weird flavors make this sub-standard IMO."
"Not bad, but not particularly interesting either."
"This is a great beer for winter, not too hoppy like the widmer, but not quite as dark as I like for Christmas. Even still a great winter beer."
"D: Pretty high. At 6.6% this isn't exactly a session beer, but it's a refreshing alternative to the malt bombs everyone seems to put out this time of year. The carbonation is the only sore spot for me - it's high enough to be a bit unpleasant in my book."
"I like Two Below, one of the lighter drinking, more hoppy winter efforts you'll find."
"Overall, this is the best New Belgian bier I have had to date. This was very enjoyable and one I recommend strongly. Prosit."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp orange with a thin diminishing off-white head. Aroma is bitter hops and caramel malts. The taste is a nice balance of bitter Earthy hops and sweet caramel malts that maintains its balance all the way to the finish. The beer is on the light side of medium with it's 6.6% well hidden. This one is an enjoyable beer for a cold night."
"Overall, this beer is the perfect winter seasonal. A little bite with some equal sweetness. Definitely conjures up some feelings of warmth and happiness."
"drinkability: the price is right on this beer and it is very sessionable. i think even alot of non-beer folk could enjoy this one."
"D- Nice easy flavor that was quite different than I was expecting."
"D: No bitterness, mild sweetness, good mouthfeel, pleasent aroma and flavors all add up to an easy drinking beer."
"D - this brew continues to be a winter warmer favorite of mine. exceptional balance and flavor make this a no-brainer winter season session brew!"
"drinkability: good"
"Other comments: This is kind of a ""sleeper hit"" of a beer. Looking at it you don't expect much, but then you're treated to a nice flavor complexity and a really palatable beer."
"I drink a lot of Fat Tire and enjoy the New Belgium products. Will try it again when the snow flies to see if my opinion changes."
"Drinkability: One of those odd ales that falls between the cracks -- it's not a great representation of an ESB and doesn't perform too well as a Winter Warmer. Though, as just a pleasant, easy-drinking beer, it's alright."
"Very tasty beer that I will be getting more of. Thanks Fugazme."
"Poured a crystal clear copper color, white head settling fairly quickly. Nose is less fruity, caramel malt, spice, nutmeg and very tasty A nice malty brew, with just enough hops to balance everything out. Mouthfeel is fairly mild, not too complex. Drinkability is high due to its taste and smoothness."
"Fairly easy to drink and quite unique,and I feel that it is very well balanced. This is not a bad choice and overall it tastes pretty good."
"D: This is a winter seasonal that is hopped up! I think this is one of NB's stronger offerings as it provides that hop craving one may have during the winter months. The drinkability isn't the best as it is a bit sharp and hot. Nice warming beer though!"
"I will probably buy it again but it definitely won't be something that I seek out."
"T: Hops aren't as in your face in the flavor. More of a tangy maltiness with just faint traces of mildly bitter pine hops in the background. The flavor doesn't overwhelm or fill the palate. It seems half absent, you kind of have to work for it. This, however, creates an easy, more drinkable sensation."
"Anyway, cheers. 2 left in my 6 pack and then it's off to bed."
"Not the best, but decent IMO."
"Drinkable> not to shabs"
"Mouthfeel had a distinctive pucker to it, medium bodied, some malt stickiness, and definite alcohol warming in the mix. It made for a drinkable beer, but a mysterious experience overall. I'd have it again, but it makes me yearn for more hops."
"serving temp.- 38.1 degrees"
"D:I could polish of a sixer with no problem."
"Overall it's a really nicely done malty beer that never gets sweet, and isn't too bitter. Additionally, it's really pretty unique in that it kind of suggests spices where there are none. Quite nice!"
"D: A very average beer, wouldn't buy again."
"Drinkability-The nose gives an english pale ale type aroma as the glass comes to you but then a weird mixture of beer ingredients hits the taste buds in well... a different way. It tastes like somebody threw a mystery recipe together and this is what came out."
"The first thing I noticed was the amazing off-white almost tan head. The head poured about two fingers and was almost perfectly level. This smooth and frothy beer has a red amber body. It has a piney and inviting aroma. There are also some spice and bean esters. There is definitely clove and malt tones. The taste is also piney, clove like and herbal. There is sort of a vegetable aftertaste. It is a medium bodied beer with a bit of carbonation bite which is weird because you do not see the bubbles."
"Hazy scarlet red. Thin off white head. Lacing is thin. Grassy hop nose with a toffee like malt aroma too. Snappy hop presence gives this ESB some character. English malt backbone is sufficient lending toffee notes to the flavor profile. Dry and grassy finish. Easy drinking ESB. Nice stuff."
"Overall: I like this one. I think I would pick up some for my friends. at 9 bucks a six pack, it's a bit pricey. But it is a nice Ale."
"pours a really great looking reddish amber color with a big white head on it. has a wonderful mixture of hops and biscuity maltiness to it, really looks and smells great. taste is just as impressive, the hops and malt conteract eachother wonderfully. has a rich full flavor to it, just awesome all around. mouthfeel and drinkability are great too"
"My favorite offering from New Belgium, and something to which I'll return each winter to come."
"I love New Belgium brewery and this is a fine release from them once again."
"D: Easy to drink more than one. However, I'm not sure this is a good example of an ESB."
"This beer was served a light clear copper color with a 2 finger of white rocky head - thick sticky lacing was left on the side of the glass. Nose is of yeast and breadiness with some citrusy hops. Taste starts with the hops spiciness and kick and then leads in to tastes of bread and yeast. Mouthfeel is rather light. I expected a bit heavier feel to it. It was almost watery but not quite watery. Overall a decent beer that went down smoothly, and could sit with for an evening."
"Stylistically, I think this beer misses. However, I do find this a very interesting try."
"This comes poured in a pint glass at the airport brewpub in Denver as a clear bright light amber with a fair fuzzy off-white head and very good lacing. The aroma is a pleasant toasted floral hops with some rye bread thrown in. The flavor brings out more of the hops, almost more of an orange citrus with a floral finish, sweet and nice. There is a goodly peppery accent throughout, very refreshing with a decent creamy feel that brings a subtle touch of clove nutmeg but is entirely drinkable. This could fit in with some folks idea of an IPA and I did like it. Very much recommended."
"Thank you New Belgium!"
"This brew pours a clean golden amber with about about a finger of head in my pilz glass and is inviting. Nose is malty with some must hop backing. On my tongue the malts flavors come out first followed by the musty, earthy hopyness that I'm not altogether sure about. In the mouth the body is medium but finishes with a bit of a zingy after taste. All in all this beer is just ok to good for me."
"Pretty much the same as all the other new belgium beers (not counting Erics or La Folie)."
"All in all a solid, if not spectacular offering from New Belgium."
"A winter ale? I don't see how. More like a hoppy belgian blonde, IMHO."
"Pours a straight up orange peeko tea copper, hardly any bubbling. Film of foam head. Slightly funky hop and toasty, dry bisuit malt aroma. Well hopped, but somewhat dry on the palate. A little off putting. Plus the hopping delves into the skunky bitter of hops that I don't really care for. The finish is smooth, but don't let this beer get to warm unless you like funky hops."
"It is now my favorite New Belgium!"
"The taste is bitter, citrusy a bit on the hop. The taste then is of malt. Definite alcohol taste, making this I suppose a bit of a winter warmer. The taste finishes with a bitter cleansing hoppiness. Overall, this tastes very fresh and great, I think this is a highly drinkable beer. Enjoy it while it lasts, another quality product from New Belgium."
"Overall a nice change of pace beer. I would suggest a try if you get the chance, worth the time/dollars. Different from the mountains of Colorado."
"D: Drinkable."
"Was given a six-pack as a gift though I will not be buying this on my own."
"Another beer I would not have sought out, but was on sale so I grabbed it. An example of a beer that may advertise as ""ESB"" but isn't overwhelming like some. Similar in that regard to New Glarus' American Pale Ale ""Organic Revolution"""
"Grassy and citrus hop flavor comes out on top in the taste, but very nice sweet malt presence balances things out quite well. Gets lost in the shuffle of winter warmers, but really is a great brew...easily my favorite New Belgian beer that they put in 12 oz bottles. Taste is very fresh and crisp with a mellow, creamy carbonation feel to it. Definitely an every-year purchase for me."
"Served chilled straight from fridge. Pours a good big head. Foamy, good lacing. Malty brownish reddish color. Very hoppy aroma, some malty aroma. Somewhat spicy, malty taste. Good taste, but not much unlike other malty beers like fat tire. Just a little spicier."
"Pours a dark orange/amber with a thin off white head that dissipated quickly into a nice collar. Slight laciness and moderate clarity. Aroma is very piney mixed with a slight maltiness. Taste is hoppy with a slight bitterness. Their is a rough unfinished taste that adds an interesting flavor to the beer. Good body with a good (not heavy) texture. I enjoyed this beer, an excellent and interesting flavor. Light body and texture that make it a good session beer."
"I think this beer is quite quaffable. The well balanced flavor and thinner mouthfeel gives this a better than average drinkability. Usually I like a dry finish, but it didn't seem to fit with the overall concept this beer was going for."
"D- well, last time I had this, I had 3, and I really liked it. I enjoyed the hoppiness. But this batch I don't like as much. Possibly just a slight variation? or age? I'm not sure. Or maybe it was what I was eating at the time."
"I gave it another shot (actually, this is it's other shot) while warmer, and, well, the sweet corn taste finally gives way to some bitterness, but I can still pick up a faint whiff of the aroma, and I know it's there in the taste, and it's distracting to me. Definitely don't drink this below cellar temp, but if you do, I would drink it close to freezing (as it suggests on the label...shoulda known)."
"A friend turned me on to this beer and I was happy he did. This beer pour very clear with a light amber color. It has a very bold but clean hop aroma and flavor. Malts are also in ballance. Although a winter Ale I could see this beer being very refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Good take on a Strong Bitter here, with more of an assertive hoppiness than I would have thought and I actually didn't mind the beefier feel, as it added some warmth to the glass and made for some good winter drinking. Solid."
"D - fairly easy to drink."
"$6.50 a six in Oregon"
"Nice orange-red color with a foamy, thick white head. Smells alright, hmm. Tastes liek a little hops then some maltiness, good and seems hoppy for an ESB which is just fine with me. Overall quite easy to drink and a nice beer to drink while shooting a game of pool which is exactly what I did."
"drinkability: in one sense good light on the mouth, but after a while the taste is just too weak"
"Palate offers a nice balance with malt and hops, again the cherry citrus flavors come through, nicely rounded, and it ends on a slightly sweet finish. Exceptionally drinkable, and quite refreshing. Very approachable too for those not fully invested in craft ales."
"D: not all that bad. It seems that New Belgium specializes solely in toasted attributes in their beers, or at least what I have sampled from the collection they offer. I find that the seasonal release of 2 below is somewhat strange for a winter warmer style type beer. But with all that aside this beer is tasty"
"OK, but not great."
"Well, I tried it warmer, but I didn't like it that way either. This just isn't my favorite beer. Sorry if you really love it, but it's just not my thing."
"Mouthfeel a bit thin, but very drinkable nonetheless."
"D-This beer is very drinkable. It's a well-balanced brew, good flavors and a great feel. Flavors are appropriate and smooth, though perhaps not very complex."
"Pours a clear red with a tall off-white head and lacing. Looking good. I like this beer. The aroma and malt background have a chocolate biscuit character while juicy citrus hops run throughout the beer. It finishes with a mild rind bitterness. The hops are pretty big for an ESB, or whatever this is, but they're wonderfully balanced. This is a fine winter ale."
"D: Though I could probably put down a few of these, it's a bit underwhelming, and I wouldn't really want to. Not a bad beer; just not a great one."
"Cheers and Hoppy Holidays!"
"my overall impressions are mixed. good (almost overwhelming) hop bitterness but the malt profile was lacking in stature. definitely a winter warmer type of ESB. recommended if you like boozy bitterness."
"D: This beer didn't do much for me. Certainly good as a session beer, but nothing about it stood out to me. Very middle of the road."
"Jk"
"Conclusion: Definitely one of the better brews I've had from NB. It's definitely a different take on a winter beer and has a very nice balance of malt and hop flavors...to me (it seems, unfortunately that lots of NB beers taste pretty similar) this is a richer/hoppier version of a Fat Tire."
"Overall: The mouth feel is a spicy alcohol warming. The finish is bitter but pleasant. It leaves a nice lasting wonderful note on the palate. I don't really like ESB's but this is one I particularly enjoyed. It is nice for a cold winter day."
"D - Highly drinkable. Flavorful but not as heavy as other winter beers. This combined with the low ABV makes this a good one to have a couple of or to share pitchers with friends."
"Not a bad brew, not really impressed though. Just an average ESB with an American twist. Not sure if i enjoyed it that much."
"D: A solid beer. Nothing too special about it, but it's a pleasurable drink."
"D: Very nicely done mnalt and hop balance makes for a fine beer. ABV is limiting."
"Another thank you to flexabull for the chance to try this via Secret Santa."
"This is a fine beer. Pours a very thin head and a bright orange color. The hops power through the taste, and hints of spices come through as well. Very easy to drink, and though it doesn't have as thick a mouthfeel as many winter ales, it is certainly still full of bright citrusy and spicy flavor."
"D - I'm moving on!"
"A very drinkable, quenchable brew to have a few of while in need of something favorably sessionable for winter, or really whenever..."
"12 oz bottle. Poured into a nonic. Kind of an apple juice/golden amber color. Eggshell head that leaves some nice lacing. Earthy and somewhat vegetal malt aroma with an herbal, spicy hop profile. Toasty bready malt flavor with a very English hoppiness. Caramel sweetness and nice subtle balance. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry. Really, extremely easy to drink. Not bad, and not off the mark stylistically, but I have to ask, why the hell would you make your winter beer an ESB? It's not hearty, full-bodied, or especially strong."
"This one pours a clear dark amber color with rocky white head. The nose is floral citrus, notes of milk chocolate and toasted white bread. Comes across the palate with a dominant toasted malt bread biscuit and wild flower flavor. This has a medium bodied mouth feel and continues throughout."
"Still haven't had anything bad from new belgium. Great winter seasonal."
"D: This is probably one of New Belgium's best beers. While it probably wouldn't be great for a session beer at 6.6% ABV, it tastes good enough you'll never want to use it as one anyway."
"Someone below commented that this beer ""doesn't know what it wants to be"" because it doesn't fit neatly into one particular style. I hope that was a joke. Thank G-d some breweries out there are still pushing the envelope and breaking the rules."
"Overall, this beer is decent, but nothing that I plan on reaching for again. If I had bought a six pack of this I would be thrusting them into the hands of friends."
"Overall a drinkable bitter but not a resounding winner for a seasonal offering."
"Pours orange with a thin head. Faint nose with slight hints of hops that get stronger as the beer warms. Tastes more like a winter warmer to me than anything else, but with twinges of a pale ale at times. Finishes malty at first and then the hops kick in. Very drinkable for a beer over 6%."
"M/D - very drinkable light bodied beer with a nice hoppness at the finish. Highly recommended."
"Over all, this is a decent brew. Probably a one and done for me, however."
"D- Fairly drinkable. I think some people wouldn't have more than 2-3 in a sitting, but you could definitely have more."
"I had this as part of the Old Chicago winter beer tour. I have been eyeing this for a while and was glad to have the opportunity to try it. I found it to be quite a drinkable brew. Although I am not a fan of hops, this was nicely balanced with just enough hops to cut through the sausage pasta I was eating. Very good."
"Pours light orange, just as the bottle says. Grass, pepper, and hops in the nose. Smooth flavor, though the flavors seem to compete. Good malt character you expect from an ESB, but a lot of hops that you expect from a west coast IPA. Its like the beer doesn't know what it shoud be. When cool, its a malty IPA. As it warms, the ESB qualities emerge. Doesn't really matter, its still a pretty good beer."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Pours a nice, clear amber with fluffy white head. Retention and lacing were minimal. Smell is nice. At first sniff I detect a good amount of hops with a bit of a biscuity malt backbone. The hops did smell nice and fresh I thought. The taste was good but something seemed a little out of place. There were some hops at first but it finished with a caramel malt taste which is weird, it seems like most beers you get the malt first and then the hops. Mouthfeel was light, a little too thin I thought. Overall a very good beer."
"Drinkability: My favorite beer from New Belgium thus far. Still, all of their beers are over-yeasted IMHO. There's better winter beers out there, but a solid offering from the New Belgium staff. Give it a try."
"The base is in place for a solid, rotund, ESB-type ale. But I question the hop varieties that are used."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a surprisingly bright, rich gold color. The head was white, retained well as a collar and left solid lacing all the way down. The aroma was nice blend of grapefruit and citrus hops plus caramel malt. The flavors were also mostly hoppy, but it started with a flash of biscuit-like malt and some hints of caramel followed by the crisp citrus hop presence. Some brown sugar showed up as it warmed but it generally remained rather acidic. An odd combination. The body was medium and the carbonation the same. An interesting beer but not what I think of when I go looking for winter brews and it never really came together for me."
"A good offering from New Belgium, good drinkability, a good choice for a session beer."
"I have mixed feelings about this beer. At first I really was impressed with it. It had a great taste to it, one that would go good with a nice thanksgiving meal, but after having the 1554, it just felt weak. I felt cheated with the 2 below, it seemed like the half way point of a great beer. Loved it, don't get me wrong new belgium still is doing good. but I just felt like I was hanging there. Should remain a seasonal."
"D- Drinks great for me, but hops might be a bit much for some folks."
"This is a very nice beer from New Belgium, it's the first one I've had from them where the hops take on a prominent role. Very good aroma and quite tasty."
"D- an esb is a pretty unique choice for a winter seasonal. its a nice change of pace. this one i could have a couple of in a sitting, and id like to have it a few times before its gone for the year."
"This stuff was pretty decent, kind of like Fat Tire. Would be a decent session beer for some but it's not really to my tastes."
"For me, a difficult beer to put into words, but I enjoyed it. I've noticed a few times that people think it's really similar to Fat Tire. To my tastes, it's a pretty big departure, with much more hops. A good thing, in my book."
"A: Dark pumpkin, ring of foam along the edges - 3.50, S: Bready and grainy, the aroma definitely favors the malt though there is a noticeable hop bite - 3.50, T: The palate is quite a bit more bitter than the nose led me to believe, strong bitterness, some dark cherries and slightly medicinal - 3.25, M: Light to medium bodied - 3.50, D: A very non-confrontational beer, decent but nothing to rant and rave about - 3.50"
"D&Notes: To be honest, I actually bought a six pack of this thinking it would be different than Fat Tire, as I am really not a big of it. Before I even had a chance to try it, I was hearing it was similar to Fat Tire, and I almost fell into the trap of judging it before I tried it for myself. Come to find out, it is somewhat like Fat Tire, but unlike the flagship brew, this winter release has ample hops to balance out the excessive biscuit like malt flavor I don't care for in Fat Tire. This is overall a very good winter beer, perfectly balanced, and has enough ABV to be warming, but two or three of these for most beer lovers shouldn't be too much either. Can't wait to visit Colorado for the first time this December, as I plan to try this on tap close to where it brewed."
"Pours a clear copper orange color with a huge three finger off-white head that recedes slowly, becoming rocky and leaving some nice sheets of lacing. Well rounded aroma of bitter hops and sweet malt. Certainly balanced in the nose. Taste is quite sweet, a bit of caramel and toasty malts, and the hopping seems to be a bit light with casual flavors of citrus and light pine. Fairly well balanced but could have used a bit more hop bitterness. Smooth and creamy, light carbonation. A nice winter ale but doesn't taste much like an ESB. Too much caramel malt and too little hop bitterness to be considered such, but still tasty."
"Overall this wasn't a particularly memorable brew. I bought a six pack of this, and when it's gone that will be all I'd really care to have of this. Not a beer which beckoned me back for more."
"This beer pours a clear ruby color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is a nice balance between caramel malt, and citrus hops. The taste leans a little more toward the malty side, but there is still a nice hop presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is one of the nicer New Belgium beers I have tasted. I could happily drink this beer again."
"D: If you're craving a dumbed-down Fat Tire, this beer's for you."
"I really like this bitter, a smooth lightly malty and sharp hop bite at the end that is really delicious. a great sipper that i wish was more available around here. a definite huge winner from new belgium. crisp hop presence gives a really nice lingering character."
"With a lovely view of the Rocky Mountains, and the terminal with the white peaks that emulates said mountains, I ordered a 2 Degrees Below. This beer appeared a medium copper, with a white head, and lots of lacing. The smell was of muted floral hops. The taste showed caramel malt, and more floral hops. The beer had a mild carbonation, with a medium weight body. This reminded me of Brewster's beer style, only a little bit hoppier. It was a nice quaff, I could drink a few of these while waiting for a connection, flight or otherwise..."
"D= This ale is no doubt very similar to Fat Tire, but I have to say I liked this one more. The toasted nut flavor is found in both, but this ale had a delicious little hop bite that was just right. Very drinkable, very sessionable."
"My fav NB Brew is still the 1554 & the new abby."
"Pours a crisp copper color, not exactly what I was expecting. Fluffy white head that lasts. It smells almost like a crisp winter morning with a fresh layer of snow. Reminds me of outdoor hockey games. Tastes like a wonderful simple bitter with a well balanced flavor. Im not really sure why its a winter beer, but its good."
"D: Not terribly complex; a good winter seasonal."
"I'm not a huge New Belgium fan, but this one definitely shines. A solid winter brew, I think the malt character, shop hopping, and spiciness make it a perfect winter brew. Definitely fits the bill and worth warming up to this winter."
"A nice ESB and a bit different, but just a bit thin and the ABV is too high for sessionability. I would drink this again."
"This is my favorite of the New Belgium current seasonals. Beautiful hop smell and taste. Not over the top, but a strong, malt balance. Good color. Only problem was the tap was over carbonated and the resulting pour was poor. Not the beers fault but the pub."
"I'm not sure why this doesn't score better on BA but I think it's an idea winter warmer."
"It looks good with an attractive amber-orange color, whispy lacing on the glass as it's consumed. I found the aroma to be clean with some citrus and toffee. The taste is a hybrid of American and English charactersits. It starts clean with some bready malts. Caramel come in, then diacetyl. The hop flowers provide clean hop bitterness. The tail-end of the journey leaves a buttery feel and taste in the mouth. Don't worry, there's none of that buttered popcorn taste. Right on target."
"Overall, a great beer and a must try. Cheers to New Belgium! For how cheap this is, I enjoy picking this up in the winter. An easy drinking beer."
"Poured with a good finger width head reducing down to a light lacing of foam. Good deep amber. Great smelling hops beer and barley odor. The beer tastes of fresh hops with hints of rye. This is a great seasonal beer that New Belguim pumps out each and every year that I cannot wait till it comes out."
"Sixer from the Vacaville Nugget. Pours a glimmering amber/brown, not really much of a head...a little white lace on top. Mildly toasted barley odor, hint of rye, green hops. Taste is also very bisctuiy, like a Digestive biscuit (for those of you who grew up in England). Hint of grassy hop, finish is reminiscent of eating some dry whole wheat toast. Medium bodied and fairly easy to drink. I want to say its interesting, but only marginally. I dont know if i'd but this again, but ill enjoy the rest of the sixer."
"I'd rather drink it on a summer evening on the porch. Its more of an ipa then anything else."
"D. The first half of the beer tasted pretty good then from there on it went downhill. Wont get this again"
"Worth trying, just don't expect this to be a big winter beer."
"A friend brought me some New Belgium Brewery's 2 Below, which was really quite tasty. It was my first beer of the night, and I dug it a lot. Since this is an ESB, I expected it to be a little more aggressive than your average beer in terms of hops and alcohol content, but nothing overpowering. It is really not bitter at all, but balanced between hops and malts. I drank it right out of the bottle, like a classy broad, so I didn't really look at color or head, but it is a basic copper colored ale, and it was quite quite tasty."
"A coppersih body with a tan head. Lots of carbonation. The smell is basic with light hops and faint smalts. No big flavors here either. Slight hoppy bitterness. Pretty light body. A good session beer I suppose, but nothing special. How can they sell this for the same price as 1554?"
"Seeing that it is classed as an ESB here makes sense to me: it's got a robust body with plenty of flavour and both malt and hops, sweet and bitter, with great balance."
"D: It isn't an offensive beer, and by no means is it undrinkable, but this beer falls a little short for me. This is my least favorite New Belgium beer by far."
"The drinkability is good, I would try this again. Prosit, MK"
"I don't get the typical winter warmer feel from this beer but it is an ESB. Typical German hops add a spice that isn't usually in an ESB but it is still a good balance and has a good body. Slight warming as I drink but 6.6% seems to hide well."
"Pours a five finger rocky cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor is not as hoppy as brewer says, not the usual ESB, hints of sweetness, very drinkable. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"Smells of malts and very light herbaceous smell. Taste is sweet, but hoppy. Nice smooth finish, but nothing worth waking the kids or calling the neighbors over. Is a very easy drinker. Not a bad brew, but nothing major."
"D: It started out strong, leaving a great first impression. However, it was down hill from there. It lacked a bitter profile but was creamy and smooth. It was interesting but not worth a long session."
"The aroma didn't do much for me as I only seemed to get a strong maltiness to it. The flavor was malt dominated crisp on the finish and gave a slight hop taste that lingered as the brew went down. It was nicely carbonated and overall a nice average winter warmer."
"overall would make for a good session beer given the ease of the drink and moderate alc at 6.6%, glad I was able to try it but if this was available to me 365 I wouldnt go out of my way to keep it stocked in my collection"
"Mouthfeel-it is surprising, with a hoppy nose it immediately gives way to a healthy malty body that tastes richer and darker than it looks. A froth on the palate livens up the hops and leaves a lingering bitterness on the finish. Very tasty and quaffable. Solid!"
"transluscent amber pour with a medium sudsy white head. Smell is metallic and subtle toasty toffee like malt, with a nice bright hop presence as well. Body is surprisingly fuller than expected, and perfectly carbonated. Nice toffee maltiness, faint tartness, then a very light lingering bitter-sweetness in the finish. A pretty nice ESB, and better and hoppier than expected."
"Notes: This beer seems very similar to Fat Tire. That same biscuit flavor is very apparent. Tasted like a heartier version of the New Belguim classic."
"Drinkability - This was like velvet liquid. It was stiff enough to earn the ESB moniker yet easy enough to go down freely. It's probably one of the best-drinking ESBs that I've ever had."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It poured an amber color with a white 2-finger head that left a nice amount of laceing all the way down. The smell was very malty, And the taste was slightly hoppy and bitter. The overall mouthfeel was watery and light, not really much carbonation detected either. Overall this beer was decent. I expected more from New Belgium."
"Fairly drinkable. It's not my favorite style on the planet, but I do enjoy an ESB from time to time. This one fits the style pretty well, minus just a bit more bitterness that would help it I think. Maybe some golding hops would help it?"
"I purchased a six pack for my super bowl viewing beer. Poured into a pint glass, nice and dark looks nice. The nose is malty with nice hoppy background notes and some faint cinnamon, nutmeg or something, it is hard to put my finger on. The taste is a bit strange, out of balance in my opinion, first hit with strong malt and then over the top hoppiness and a strong alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is initial creamy, then very carbonated. I only drank 4 of the six pack and it was enough. This beer is probably better on tap, but in over the top and out of balance in my opinion."
"This is a refreshing change of pace for most winter brews out there. The Malt flavor is awesome, it's clean but has plenty of flavor. Good balance of toastiness and sweetness. Just enough hops for me, perhaps a little low for the style, but I think that's what the beer is going for."
"Excepting rabid hopheads, an interesting brew that should satisify most hop cravings....fine for mine."
"Drinkability: New Belgium has put forth a very enjoyable ESB. Sitting here in my cosy condo while it's snowing outside, enjoying a 2 below, couldn't get any better. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy with a sharp prickly carbonation. Goes down pretty easy. Overall a pretty good brew but it doesn't really end up wowing me."
"I'd have little trouble drinking another, but have no desire to do so. Pretty average."
"Bad bottle? Damaged in transit? Who knows. This wasn't good. I'll try it again if possible cause I know New Belgium can do better than this."
"Overall a nice little dry hopped winter beer. Not my favorite, but I pick up a six-pack every year. Drinkability would be better if it had a little bolder aromas and flavors."
"Overall: I credit them for trying something a little different, but it just came out weird to me. Wouldn't buy again."
"D- It's alright, but not one I'll go for again. The flaws seem to outweigh the good parts of this beer, sadly."
"Overall, this is a nice winter warmer."
"A clean yellow/orange colored beer. Has a nice smooth creamy white head and lacing that looks like a milk mustache . The aroma has a strong spicy hop character and an light biscuit malt note with a hint of clove in the background. The start of the taste begins with a light biscuit malt note on the front of your tongue. Followed by that nice spicy hop character on the back edges of your tongue and mouth. That leads to a crisp and refreshing finish."
"The taste is similar. If I were to describe it in 3 words or less, I'd say Fat Tire Light. A nice beer, but I was expecting something a bit more hoppy based on the blurb on the label. I used a bit of this to baste and steam the inside of a roasted chicken, and it provided a perfect complement to the bird. Overall, an enjoyable beer that I won't necessarily look forward to each year. Great option to match with poultry."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Clear, light bronze appearance with thin white head. Smells like what I remember fat tire tasting like, very distinguishable yeast flavor. Tastes much the same, a bit hoppier perhaps. I don't care much for the flavor, definitely too similar to fat tire, which I am not particularly fond of either. Not a bad beer, but not one I would probably pay money for."
"Drinkability - I could drink these all night. I would buy it again. Not really a session beer though. Pretty high alcohol content for an E.S.B. All in all I was not too impressed with fat tire or New Belgium brewing after all the craze, but this beer changed my mind."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear amber body with a tiny offwhite head that quickly drops into some patchy lacing. Aroma is toasty caramel and earthy hops. Light medium body is well carbonated. Tase has lots of earthy hops bitterness with a toasted caramel malt presence underneath. A hint of pear fails to fully emerge. Nicely drinkable but pedestrian."
"I served this beer right at the recommended temp of 38 degrees. I think for this medium bodied ale, a warmer temp allows more flavor to come out. After the initial sip I let mine sit for 15 minutes, allowing the spiced flavor to become more complex. 2 Below pours out of the bottle a very clear, amber color with a full, off white head. The head lingers just on the surface as the beer becomes less and leaves a nice lacing on the inside of the glass. The aroma is sweet, reminiscent of homemade pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving Day. There is also a noticable smell of pears and earthiness that I just can't ignore. No real hop presence in the smell, but the spices noted, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves, are pleasant. The taste is good with a sweetness similar to spiced rum. The hops create a bitterness that balances, but there is not a noticable hop flavor. The 6.6% ABV bites just after the swallow. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but thicker than you would think for such a clear beer. It floats around the cheeks and dances over the tongue, warming the throat as it is swallowed. I really enjoyed this beer on a chilly desert night, surrounded by good friends."
"Pours pale amber with little head. Aromas of apricot with a bit of funk and a little Christmas spiciness, thought this is quite restrained. Tastes of mandarin oranges, apricots, and a bit of metal. Slightly sweet, but not overly so. Light, crisp mouthfeel makes this somewhat refreshing, but the spice and sweetness less so. Not bad, but I've enjoyed a number of other winter ales more."
"Bright copper apricot body with a thick finger of marshmallowy, light beige head. Terrific lacing up the glass! Vibrantly green hop nose: mint, pine needles, and herbal tea. Doughy biscuit malt background with light fruits. Nutty malt and floral hop flavors up front. Marmalade and honeydew melon follow. Toffee edges. Herbal, minty hop bitterness is a tad underwhelming in the finish. Moderate body with a watery, flat feel. A little off."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into biere du boucanier snifter. Poured a clear copper with a thick white head classic ESB apperance. However the smell was off with a musty malt smell mixed with a slight citrus hp aroma. Taste is really earthy with little hop flavor but with a slight mushroom and chalky flavor. Mouthfeel is medium body with a good level of carbonation. I cant saw for me this beer is a good match. I like ESB and funk but just not funky ESB. Although my friend loves this beer, to each his own."
"It pours a remarkably clear copper color. The head is pretty nice to begin with, leaving some lacing on the glass, but it doesn't last long. Smell is of bready malts, molasses, faint earthy and piney hops. Somewhat unusual; somewhat appetizing (if sweet). I find this to be a pretty well balanced beer, flavorwise. The label says that it contains ""a bright, warming blast of Sterling and Liberty hops along with tawny-roasted malts""; I'm not sure if it's the wintery packaging, but I taste some spices in here. While other reviewers draw comparisons to Fat Tire, this tastes to me more like something from the Anchor catalog. A higher ABV offering from New Belgium that is both sessionable and fairly tasty."
"One of these was more then enough and I don't plan to ever order it again. I was trying to choose between the trippel (in bottle) and something on draft at the airport, and made the mistake of going with this. Ho hum...."
"So here it says it's an ESB but you can see form the name/image that NB is marketing this as some kind of winter warmer. Well... I guess ESB is probably pretty close. Other than the too-pale color and the too-bitter mouth. This might make a decent brew for a hot summer day - a lawnmower beer - but it's way not enough anything for a day below 50F for me. Ah, right, other than bitter. But I'd definitely say that the bitterness was all of of proportion - unless, again, this is for the sweaty hot days of summer. Just change the label and marketing and you'll be all set."
"D - What a nice winter brew! I've always felt that ESBs are some of the most sessionable, if not the most complex or mind-boggling beers and this one is an above average example of the style, with the added bonus of come really nice mellow spices."
"I had this at my parent's house over the holidays. The label states this is a winter warmer, and BA lists it as an ESB, but I think it's more of a pale ale. It smells nicely hopped (sterling and liberty apparently) but the malt backbone adds some sweetness to the taste as well. Easily drinkable as an APA in my opinion."
"Pours crystal clear with an amber color with a ruby touch to it. Decent sized head. Nose is extremely heavy on the hops. Just overpowering almost. Flavor is even and smooth, but I get something odd on there. I just cant place it (inexperience), but its almost like a port like character that peeks out at you. At the start you get an almost thin layer of pine which fades to what I think is an alcohol tone after some time. Feel is a little thinner than I would think would be appropriate, but it is pretty drinkable, though not the greatest example of the style by any means."
"Beautiful beer, a must for hop heads. Sneak a little more malt in the taste and you've got an A"
"I don't think a lot of breweries make a winter seasonal out of an ESB. New Belgium did and I think it worked great. This is a wonderful beer that I would recommend."
"Amber in color with a slight white head. Smells of sweet tarts. A slight hint of hops and flowery notes last. First taste is not as tart as one would seem, but the bite of hops is there. This beer warms the belly. A highly drinkable offering from New Belgium that changes with each taste. As the beer gets warmer and is exposed to more air, the more it develops or becomes more complex. 3rd taste. It's starting to settle down. Not as much of a bite. This year's version is better than last year. Much better. This time of year in FC, this beer is a great choice."
"D: It took me some getting use to before really liking it but it definitely grew on me."
"i like this beer. could drink a few too many. the 6.6% ABV could creep up on you. maybe a little off for an ESB . . . but i dig it."
"D- Oh yes its drinkable in fact I'm going to be a scrooge and not share. HAHAHAHA, I'm not sorry..."
"Drinkability - this is a decent ale. Unfortunately, the metallic burnt maltbread taste diminishes my enjoyment of this, so I'd want a change of taste after two or so, and even then I'd only be having this once in a while in the first place."
"12 oz bottle. The beer pours a solid copper color with a finger of white head that falls to a full coat over top. The clarity on this is fantastic and there are large bubbles forming at the bottom of my glass and cascading up to the top. The aroma is very earthy, with a strong toasted German malt character along with some biscuit-like qualities that I associate with other beers from this brewery. The hop only comes through to me in the earthy character. The flavor accentuates the toasted and biscuity malt character. There is a mild earthy hop in there that comes through on the finish. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and a little herbal character as well from the hop. I find as a I drink this, the malt seems to diminish and the hop seems a bit more upfront. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation of fine bubbles. Overall, this one is not bad. The malt character is and never will be my favorite, but I think it is what the brewer wants, so I can take that as it is. I don't think I would drink more than one in a night, but the 6 I got will be consumed without much worry."
"this is one of the better winter brews i've had, only because it tastes like christmas! it really does have a feeling of having a spruce or pine in your mouth. totally weird, but true! pours a nice caramel with a little bubblely head and fair lace. head dissipates rapidly. smells of light floral hops, nothing impressive here. tastes the way christmas trees smell. odd, but interesting nonetheless."
"Pours copper / brilliant orange; flecks of vermilion. Foamy and bubbly blonde-white head, medium in size. Lacing forms two wide, intricately drippy arcs. Frosty looking. Aroma is warm and lightly hoppy with a spicy sweet touch: toast, suds, apples, caramel, sweet grass, liquor. Mouthfeel is not quite juicy with a very light carbonation. Flavor is dominated by a subtle bread malt woodiness with overtones of peach, citrus, flour, and dust. Earthy for sure. Malts and hops are balanced in pretty good stride here. A touch of bitter cinnamon spice comes in at the finish. Aftertaste is light and a touch syrupy, with a gentle bitterness."
"M/D: Medium body, carbonation is a little hight but not bad. Drinkability is a little low due to taste being off balance but the beer still maintains a good amount of drinkability."
"Slowly I finish my second one of the night and decide to head for a Fat Tire...You know how animals grow a heavy, Winter coat...well this beer is Fat Tire before the Spring molt..Our cows used to get frisky too with the onset of Winter...this beer is a bit wild..."
"Drinkability - Just okay, easy to drink, reminded me a lot of a slightly hoppy Fat Tire."
"Overall, not the best among New Belgium's many excellent labels. Skip this one and go for one of the others."
"D - Nice to drink and has exceeded my expectations (I had set them low this time around, not really knowing too much about the beer). I may be back at the liquor store for this one; this time more than 1 bottle."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color, white head settling fairly quickly. Some lacing. Aroma is less fruity than i remember from last year, a bit heavier on the malt. A nice malty brew, with just enough hops to balance everything out. Mouthfeel is fairly mild, not too complex. Drinkability is high, flavor is easy on the palate. Would definetly buy this again,(and again)."
"All in all, I will buy it again...passes the ""session"" test and a good addition to my upcoming winter options."
"D - This is a very good ESB. It almost tastes more like an IPA it is some hoppy."
"This was had on a trip to Colorado, very near Fort Collins. Exceptional hop malt combination with caramel and coffee. Balanced wonderfully with the alcohol . This dubbel has eluded me in my area. I've found other brews from New Belgium brewery.Buy some today.."
"D - A little forward to drink much of but nice if you want something different."
"Someone suggested that this is just a heavier Fat Tire. Not to me. It is its own fine self, and a good warmer to keep around all winter."
"Taste is mild and grassy, with a brief hop bitterness on the finish. This tasted a little thin to me for something advertised as a ""winter ale"" - more of a boozy Fat Tire to enjoy at an after-sunset cookout. Mild flavor and low carbonation makes this an easy drinking beer; I'm not sure if this is accurately categorized as an Extra Special/Strong Bitter, but it's a decent beer nonetheless."
"Basically this is a heavier version of Fat Tire. Very nice in appearance, but in no way remarkable. Smell and taste are biscuity, as is the Tire, but with a little more spice. A little bit of fennel and some grassiness. Mouthfeel is round but hollow. This isn't bad, I just fail to see how it qualifies as a winter warmer. A lazy, ill-conceived offering from an otherwise fine brewery."
"Smell was malt, and a little yeast. Tastes is malty and hoppy, a little fruit. A nice beer and a good seasonal choice. I like to have some of this in my fridge for the holiday season."
"Drinks pretty easy, the boozey warmth does slow you down a bit. A fair ESB that is much better on tap IMO"
"The ESB offering from New Belgium poured a radiant clear copper. A fluffy head leaves a decent amount of lacing as I consume. Smell is typical malty biscuit that NB is known for. An additional amount of subdued fruity hops. Taste is essentially Fat Tire with a fair amount of bittering hops. The fruitiness apparent in the nose is lost on me here. Mouthfeel is clean and fresh, and I found the brew to be drinkable tho a bit boring."
"d: its smooth. Not overly hoppy or sweet, goes down pretty easy. Wouldn't have guessed its ABV: 6.60 %. Not too filling, I could definitely put down several in one sitting, but the alcohol does creep up on you."
"D: Overall drinkable and you could taste the alcohol in the beer but a good version of a 'winter warmer' . Maltiness could make it difficult to put down too many, but overall drinkable."
"The beer pours forth from the 12 ounce bottle a shimmering gold with a prestigious bright white creamy head, after its evaporation, the lace forms an encircling sheet to cover the glass. Sweet malt dominates the nose, citrus like crispness with a nice hop aroma, start has a pleasing malt presents, somewhat sweet, and bit of bite at the back, top is light to medium in feel. Finish has an authoritarian acidity, the hops vigorous in their acidity, dry aftertaste ends it all, and a drinkable beer, but I look for more in a Winter Ale."
"Smells like fat tire with a citrus edge. Taste is dominated by citrus flavors for me, with some spices and hops, but seems to lack complexity. It's hard to put my finger on, sort of unusual, not bad, but not extremely appealing to me. Mouthfeel is adequate. There's a citrusy aftertaste for me that is reminiscent of watered-down orange juice that detracts from its positives. Maybe it's just because I'm coming off NB's Abbey, which I was quite impressed with, but I'm not quite feeling this one. Not bad or anything, but nothing I'll seek out."
"Mouthfeel has a crisp medium body. This seems to be lighter fare than most winter seasonals."
"For an ABV of 6.6 you cant really tell... i think i could drink a six of this with no problems.... no wonder everyone wants to get their hands on it... i am glad i can get this beer locally, ill be stockin up on this for sure!"
"D- With a name like 2 below I was expecting a nice big barlywine to take the chill of the day but I was let down at first. This beer grew on me and has some nice fresh hops flavors that are really crisp, but the biscuit malt is a bit too much."
"Thanks, brandoman63, for the opportunity"
"D- Very smooth and drinkable ""winter ale", the alcohol is well-masked and the malts are well balanced with the hops, this is a nice offering and is distinctly NB, but I was expecting a bit more weight/complexity/warmth from a self-proclaimed winter ale"
"Anyway, New Belgium is making some lovely beers, and this is certainly one of them!"
"Did not find it very bitter like its description, probably would have enjoyed it more it the winter time rather than summer"
"D: A pretty good beer from New Belgium, I enjoyed it, would probably try again this winter."
" Overall this was an excellent beer. I really enjoyed the flavor profile and the the great finish. I do not know so much about a winter beer as this was totally light enough to drink now. I just wish we could get new belgium around here and I would be set!"
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, pears, spicy, and some caramel. The taste is malty, fruity, slightly spicy, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a different ESB in my book, but drinkable."
"Poured a clear, pinkish copper color. Little carbonation or head. Aroma was raspberry, earthy, malty, with some Belgian character. Very nice. Medium body. Flavor was toasty with some late dry fruit. Well balanced. Exotic but not bizarre. Some late bitterness as well. Hop flavor was significant."
"Mouthfeel very good. Overall a very nice and drinkable brew, and not too heavyweight at 6.6%."
"Overall a nice and easy drinking ESB. I would have prefered a bit more of a hop profile, but regardless I like the concept of an ESB winter beer offering."
"Hi TTU94"
"Poured from the bottle - A nice amber-brown color with decent lacing. The aroma was sweet and malty and with light hops. The flavor was slighty malty with some citrus tastes going on. I liked it and would buy it again next winter if I came across it."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on the label. Had a clear, light copper color. It had a good head that slowly dissipated and left some good lacing. The smell was earthy malts and floral hops. Taste was pretty good with no bitter aftertaste. Overall, a good ESB and worth a try. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"Drinkability: Good, I found this to be a pretty tasty brew. Heavy on the hops and the alcohol. Great on a freezing, 2 below day!"
"Obtained in a trade awhile back. I have been waiting to try more of this since I sampled some at the GABF in 2006 but not enough to review at that time. The beer poured a brilliant amber color into my Duvel glass, very clear with a slight white ring around the edge of the glass. The nose was hoppy, citrus, pleasing. The taste was a good combination of malty sweetness, a hoppy and peppery taste that rounded out with some citrus. Medium body and solid mouthfeel."
"Poured into a kitchen glass. Nice medium amber color, with a frothy head. Most of the head quickly dissapated, but a little lacing was left. Smelt bitter, almost sour lemons, hard to describe. Flavor was nicely spiced, with a hint of lemon. First sip warmed the body nicely. Tounge tingled, not necessarily unpleasantly, but it detracted slightly from enjoying the beer. Reasonable winter warmer, but I have enjoyed others more."
"Beer poured an amber-orange color with a well sustained white head. Nose was initially heavy on citrusy hops but after being aired out for awhile there is the familiar malty nutty nose. Taste is unique to say the least, not quite what I was expecting from the declared ESB style. The balance is leaning heavier on the nutty malt side. The initial finish was of citrusy hops but that has been reduced to be predominately a malty beverage as I continue to sample. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Overall drinkability is pretty good. This is not a bad beer to try, i hope that New Belgium tweaks the recipe to bring more of a balance if they truly are aiming for an ESB."
"Even though I have a fairly high opinion of this brewery (why, I'm not exactly sure), the only NB offering that I thought was exceptional was their dubbel, which they call Abbey Belgian Style Ale. 2 Below Winter Ale isn't at all what I expected and has to qualify as a major disappointment. I'd suggest giving it a complete overhaul from stem to stern."
"D: during the winter time, I could see cuddling up to this to get the internal organs warmed up. Hell, even in the summertime I would take this out for a bottle or two."
"Thick white head never really fades away; it just becomes a whisp. Amber pour and body. Crisp, strong, and complex smell includes roasted oats and wheat. I find it to be slightly sweet and simply mouth-watering. Starts deliciously sharp but very smooth. Settles full-bodied with a surgary caramel flavor. Finish is strong but without a lasting aftertaste. It is a bold mix of hop bitters that leaves you wishing for the next sip."
"An ok beer, but the taste is a bit odd. Maybe an ESB meets an IPA with a bit of extra sugar thrown in. I was expecting something that was more of a traditional winter ale. One-time buy for curiosity's sake."
"The body has a light to mid feel. The carbonation is a bit high and sorry to repeat myself but the ever so New Belgium feel to it. Overall this just doesnt feel like an English beer let a lone ESB. But thats half the fun with this game. Its nice to see NB finally experiment with some hops."
"M&D - thin, light on the tongue, very easy down, and easy palatable, a nice brew, you cold easy make a session beer, even in the summer"
"I didnt review 2° Below last year as it was tap only. I thought it was decent, a more robust version of Fat Tire. When I heard it was going to be bottled I was happy. I bought a six-pack. Well, it is February now and I have one bottle left. I guess I better review it because I am not sure Ill bother drinking it next year. I do like certain aspects but I cant get past the nose. The palate is good. Drinkability is high. Aw hell, I bet I quaff a few more next winter. IMO, it tastes like Winterhook. Purchased in Omaha; best by: 04MAY07."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my DFH shaker pint glass. Appears a very clear golden amber color with a finger of off white head. Minimal lacing sticks to the glass with each sip. Smells of yeasty bread and sweet malt. Tastes of mildly bitter hops, bready grain and a touch of citrus. Medium bodied with medium to moderate carbonation. Finish is dry, but not as bitter as I thought it would be. I would seek this out again next winter."
"Overall I found this a unique, somewhat perplexing, but generally very enjoyable beer. However, if this is the replacement for my beloved Frambrozen, then this is a signifigant downgrade."
"This beer was poured from a 12oz. bottle, the color was a light copper with a thin head. The aroma is very unique, i don't really have a good word to describe it, so I will just say it is different and I like it. I would describe the taste of this beer as having all treble and no bass (to misuse some musical terms). Plenty of hop flavor, but no real malt flavor, which works out fine for this beer. I must say, when I bought my six-pack of this I wasn't all that fond of the flavor, but now on my last bottle (a couple weeks later) I find that I really like it. Nice beer, and definitely a unique flavor."
"I really enjoy New Belgium's products, they make some good beer. This was a mediun copper color with a nice head and some decent lacing. It has an awesome aroma to it, very fruity, slighty malty and is really refreshing. It has a mildly crisp taste that really hits your tongue and then spreads out to the rest of your mouth and has a weak alcoholic aftertaste. This is a really good ale over all, but this is not one of their best."
"Overall, OK. Probably not something I would seek out again. There are better winter beers out there."
"yellow body with cream, and good lace all the way down. A cross style attempt. Not complex as a winter ale, more of a hoppy ale more than a bitter. Carbonation on the high side. Balance like an English IPA, with some citrus and other fruit. I like English IPAs-the real thing."
"D=I could drink a fw of these but I couldn't say that I would go out of my way to seek this out."
"D: Not too bad.. Not too bad at all. It is a nice change from all the citrus hop dominated IPAs I have had recently. Definitely worth a buy."
"Cheers2Beers"
"I like my winter ales more malty and darker."
"An excellent, very well balanced beer."
"D- It is a very interesting brew. I don't think it is amazing but it is tasty. I am glad I decided to pick up a 6 pack of this. I don't think I will do another this year though."
"I will be heading back to the store for another, for sure. Nice work, New Belgium!"
"Looks a lot like a Fat Tire when poured into a pint glass. The aroma was great at first, a nice bright fresh hop aroma, bready grainyness. After about 5 minutes the hop aroma dissapated almost completely and leaves just the familiar earthy Fat Tire aroma. The hop bitterness is nice and the piney hop flavor sticks around much longer than the aroma. A little fizzy but not too crazy. 3 word review: Hoppy Fat Tire"
"Served up a nice clear copper with a slight orange hue, with a nice head that had moderate length, with some lacing apparent as dissipation occurred. Aroma of hops, with a nice citrus tone, and a biscuit undertone. Flavors of malt, citrus, slight sweetness with a nice hop bitterness in the end. Mouth feel is a nicely carbonated with a low medium body, that lends itself to a nice hop bitterness. Nicely balanced, good flavor and very drinkable. Well done. Every one should try this one."
"Tawny copper, thick and well-maintained light brown head with bubble bath sticky patching. Sinus cleansing nose of fruity hops, sweet citrus and freshly picked blueberries. Massive biscuit malts that are present throughout, and upon the first sips open to crisp nutty grains, woody hops and dusty malts. Turns a bit grainy, dry with offerings of day old grapefruit. Sweet floral hops and tender cherries left pasted on the palate. An ESB...hmmm...kick up the IBU's and you're there. Decent winter offering."
"This beer is an excellent Winter ale. The color is rich and when you smell the beer it is like someone dropped a Christmas tree into your glass. The taste is smooth, and there is an aftertaste of pine that makes you think the beer is nothing more than liquid pine cones. It must be made from delicious pine cones, though. The only problem I had with the beer is that it seemed to sit a bit heavy, and drinking a whole lot of these was hard to do."
"D: The ale is a good drink, I'd gladly have another."
"Mouthfeel is lovely, with a modest amount of carbonation, which is how I like them. Perilously drinkable, and a welcome companion on a cool winter night. I'll be very much looking forward to this one next year. Well done, NBB! Best before date of April 6, 2007."
"Drinkability/notes: Simple, but well-made and quite drinkable."
"The body was a little on the thin side with a fairly crisp carbonation. Not bad in that regard, but the finish lingered for what seemed like eternity, and it was not pleasant. I am glad I didn't end up buying a sixer of this, because I wouldn't know what to do with the remaining five. I can't wait to redeem New Belgium with the delicious bottle of La Folie I DID end up buying earlier today."
"This beer reminds me of stone and ale smith with the use of centennial hops. The nose is nice, but nothing but centennial hops come out. Head is decent and sticks around for a while and retention is decent. Taste is centennial hops and thin malts, but some nice spicing. A good amount of flavors going on. lingering nice hop bitterness. I appreciate what's going on in this brew, but the flavors don't blend for me personally in a wowing way. I'd like a bit more balance in an ESB. Stone drinkers and alesmith drinkers will like this beer. I could drink this beer easily. A nice brew. All year beer."
"Drinkability is high here. Such a nice winter session beer."
"2 below pours a nice amber color with a full finger of pure white head that falls within half a minute or so. In hind sight I don't know what I was thinking, but when I saw a winter label with the name 2 below, i expected a spiced ale. Clearly I forgot that Peter runs things over there and there is no such thing as style or expectations. Even before I get the beer to my nose I can smell the pungent piney aroma of hops. I was surprised by the taste though. I expected it to be all hops, but it was actually more balanced than I would have expected. The taste of hops were there, but it was more the floral taste and aroma than the regular bite of the bitterness of hops. There is a sweet matliness that attempts to balance the hops and only falls a little short. Personally, I think that this is labeled incorrectly as a ESB and I think Peter would agree, although he would disagree with the labeling in general and I would disagree with only the specific label applied. If you enjoy the flavor of hops, you're gonna want to drink this beer. I just might do the same again."
"A very light colored ale, almost clear. Overall the nose is faint, but the beer is cold, as recommended by the brewer (37°F), and features hops and an alcohol kick. Very smooth and mellow; although I taste the hops, there is very little bitterness. Unique malt profile, British styled, but still very different from, and much less sweet than, the typical Fuller's ESB or Young's SLA type I've had before. Soft seltzer water mouthfeel. Sun-dried mango without the sugar, avocado, and spinach are notable notes, as is fresh baked beer bread and biscuits. It's a hearty, yet civilized, ale. I like it much better at 50°F, as the flavors are (obviously) more pronounced. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: this comes in as a nice session brew in my opinion, not a heavy winter ale expected when I purchased it. Tasty and worth a try."
"I like it- another New Belgium winner!"
"A pretty solid effort from New Belgium. A bit different than other's they have made. It's certainly one of the better ESBs I have tasted in a while. Quite drinkable, and enjoyable."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep amber, with a slight head, that quickly faded, but leaving light lacing along the glass. The aroma is sweet fruit, with the slight aroma of alcohol. The taste is very much the same. A little fruity citrus flavor, but with a more pornounced alcohol presence. This reminds me of a weak version of a barley wine. Though very interesting, I couldnt drink more than one of these at a time. However, this being a winter release, I would recommend trying this at least once."
"Poured a deep rich golden with a touch of amber tint a tight one finger head set atop leaving a broken ring of lace behind as it settled pretty slowly.Like the hop spike in the aroma like grapefruit rind sitting over top a hefty caramelly malt base,the flavors dont quite match the nose but its well balanced between a brown sugar-like biscuity malt base and earthy,citrusy hop just neither really stand out enough on their own.Not a bad cold weather beer nicely balanced and a nice aroma."
"Poured into a shaker at the Granfalloon in KC, MO. The beer put up a bit of off-white surface lacing, over a very light tawny body, with broad-spaced bubbling. The nose was full of floral, piney, but primarily citric hops, with a bit of malt sweetness behind. The taste was led by hop power - citrus and pine, but balanced well with the honey and caramel flavors of the malt. The high bitterness only grew with more sipping. The mouth was medium, with tingly but fine carbonation on the palette. Overall, a great beer, with exceptional balance and great hop flavor. I had this pegged as some sort of pale ale at first, but it does just fine as an ESB."
"This beer poured out a nice amber color with a minimal half inch head. The smell was pleasant -- spicey, a little fruity, and sweet. The flavor was nice and blanced, but subtle, with nothing dominating or overpowering. My biggest complaint was the complete lack of aftertaste. Once it was down, the flavor was gone -- nothing in my mouth to remind me of what I just drank. I was disappointed by this, but it's still an enjoyable brew, and certainly light enough that you could easily drink a few of these in an evening. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's just my preference to have bigger, bolder flavors."
"The taste was still of an evergreen flavor, along with roasted malts and hints of sweet fruits and spices. This was not an overpowering winter ale, very enjoyable. The hop's were not super bitter or tart. I really enjoy this winter ale."
"The beer has a very nice, medium body with a fairly malty flavor. The initial taste is sweet and caramelly, but seemlessly transitions to an earthy hoppiness that gives this a nice dry finish. This one will be finding its way to my fridge again before the winter season is over."
"This is a unique beer, a rendetion that you don't see much off. Roasty and Hoppy, with some nice flavor depth. I recommend this one."
"Solid."
"Unlike most winter ales I have tried, this beer does not beat you over the head with strong spices or hoppiness. Smells sweet with a light hoppy background. The flavor of malt is almost carmalized, but not overly malty. Again, the hoppy flavor is there, but in the background. No harsh hoppy aftertaste. Very drinkable, which might be dangerous considering the winter ale ABV. Overall, a pleasent change from what I'm used to seeing out of winter offerings."
"This is a good one - not great, but good. The best part of the appearance is the label on the bottle, sadly. I'm a huge New Belgium fan, but I thought this needed something more. The smell of the malt is great, but the taste doesn't finish with a bang. I'd drink this anytime, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it..."
"Thanks to both BA Erica for allowing me to borrow one of BA UncleJimbos recently gifted bottles from the Pizza Port Strong Ale Festival."
"Welp, this was certainly different, and enjoyable. As noted in other reviews, the hoppy burps come forth by mid-bottle."
"A good tasty and hoppy winter ale. This is a very good choice for the time after you have had your fill of too much sweet from you usual winter warmers. Hoppier than you would think, you burp after one of these and you will know it!"
"Overall: I will look forward to this each winter. One of my favorite winter brews. Highly recommend, every one had one of these at the table, and we all liked it."
"Drinkability: A good beer to have with a meal, I like it with chicken or fish. As I said before, a bit lighter feel than other winter brews, but the muted flavor compliments the food and doesn't overpower it."
"An ESB seems an odd style choice for a winter seasonal but it works out well."
"A truly interesting winter ale heavy on unusual hops... it stands apart from most other winter seasonals and is certainly worth a try."
"Beautiful pour. Thick two finger head. Golden light copper color, bright and clear. Well balanced malt and hops on the nose. I like this beer a lot. Crisp and refreshing up front with a steady malt presence. Flowery hops kick in nicely on the back end. Perhaps my favorite New Belgium offering. Definitely need to pick up some more."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a creamy white head. Nose is herbal and grassy hops at first, but as the beer warms, aromas of chocolaty caramel malts become more pronounced. Quite nice, actually. Taste is toasted malt and toffee with a touch of fruitiness followed by a hop bitterness. A decent brew with the aroma being the highlight."
"Notes: I've made no bones about it that I can't get into brews from this brewery. This one stands out as the ""best"" offering I've had to date from New Belgium. It left behind that musky malt presence I find in its Fat Tire etc....Reccomended"
"Not bad, but I have had better ESB's. Worth a try."
"Poured into a standard goblet, the body is translucent deep amber with a slight cherry aura; the head is a sturdy three quarters of an inch tall and deflates quickly leaving a soapy ring of lace. Nose: A thorough prickle of hops upfront, some sweetness slides in quickly -- candied cherries, oranges, orange zest, solid hint of caramel -- while the hops continue to hold center-court. Taste: Starts from the back with a blunt yet subtle grate of crusty hops, and moves forward with a very round sweetness -- melons and most definitely apricot come to mind. The aftertaste is a twang of lemon zest, as the hops ascend even further, even a little peppery, leaving more fully fledged malt sweetness. Mouthfeel: A little lighter than I expected it to be, but passable. An interesting choice of style for a winter seasonal."
"A very, very nice beer. It is going to be one my favorites."
"Toasty malt notes with a buttery undercurrent round out the flavor. The hops peek through at the very end along with some faint fruit notes. Medium body with alcohol warming finish. Alcohol becomes more evident as the brew warms. Finishes relatively balanced and clean. Not my favorite style, but this is respectable."
"Drinkability is a no-brainer. I could have downed the whole glass in a matter of minutes, but what a waste that would be. Flavorful, soothing, and refreshing, this brew could just as easily serve as a summer ale as a winter ale. Unfortunately, it's seasonal, which means I should probably go back for more before it runs out."
"A small, odd beer. Maybe worth trying for the unusual hops, although they're not very strong."
"The taste and aroma of this ale is perplexing, but I find that all in all I like it. Maybe not the best winter offering out there, but its drinkable."
"Overall, this was OK - not something I would search out. It tasted like a minty Fat Tire."
"Overall Impression: If you like Fat Tire, youll like this; its a close cousin. I found it interesting that the cold serving temp muted then released hop in the taste and malt in the nose as it warmed. The two main flavors (grassy hop, grainy roasted malt) compliment each other nicely. Well done!"
"Mouthfeel is light and thin but holds up very well. Very clean, sharp, an excellent palette upon which to paint these hop varieties (Sterling and Liberty, as per the label). A welcome hoppy mid-winter seasonal light IPA, although it's clearly too hoppy to be called an ESB."
"D: This beer really grew on me. First sip and I prepared myself for some boring malt bomb with no depth. This beer actually has a lot going on. I can confidently say this is my favorite New Belgium beer to date."
"Overall: A nice, easy drinking session beer. Not extraordinary, but worth aq try."
"Note: Unless you plan on serving it as a smoothie, don't serve at the recommended 37 degrees."
"Not a complex beer, and remarkably similar to Fat Tire, but still quite tasty and quite quaffable. Really, this is kind of like the classic English winter beer, which in most breweries was a stronger version of their basic beers. Very nice, and worth buying again."
"Pours a copper amber body with rather active carbonation and a thick off white head that settles down to some peaks and plateaus along with lacing all over the place. Hops hit me in the nose first off. Lots of grassy, herbal, and floral aromas. Following that is a whiff of butter followed by smells of bread, both fresh and toasted. Flavor is big on herbal hops up front, with an underlying fruity ester quality. Something about the mix of the hops and malt flavors remind me of watermelon bubblegum just for a second. Follows through with some bready malts and toasted notes. Finishes dry, slightly bitter, with a little alcohol kick and slight astringency. Herbal hop flavor sticks through the entire way. Mouthfeel is amazing. Smooth and of moderate body. This is dangerously drinkable, especially at its alcohol level."
"The taste is the same. Grassey-piney-dandelion green taste. I assume there is malt in this beer since it is a winter ale but I can't taste it because of the dominance of the oily vegetable drawer hop taste. No balance to the taste at all. Although it gets more tolerable towards the end and there are some pleasant spicy notes I can't say I am happy I bought 6 of these. Maybe if your a serious hop head you'll disagree but I am wishing I had tried another brewers winter offering. It looks good. I'll give it that."
"D - not a good representation of the style BUT mighty tasty so its worth a try. I won't have a problem drinking the rest of the sixer."
"Drinking 2° Below is like drinking the nectar of some plant, some wonderful tasty plant. The flavors complement each other almost perfectly. Extremely refreshing. This is a jewel of a beer. I could drink it all day. Well done New Belgium."
"Medium bodied, smooth and easy enough to drink with just a touch of alcohol warmth for the fall/winter season, although this wouldn't be bad year round."
"Not sure what expected out of this beer. Copper colored body topped by an off-white head. Aroma of malt and a bit of funk. Flavor was OK, but a bit thin and dry on the finish. Very reminiscent of Fat tire with a bit more malt and peppery hops. Body is fairly solid, but the carbonation was aggressive and the finish was dry. Drinkability is OK, but not very enjoyable, unless you're a big fan of Fat Tire."
"Overall, not a winter warmer, but I like it. Nothing spectacular. Almost sessionable in taste, but not in ABV. Worth a try."
"Medium body with a good level of carbonation. Slick, creamy feel on the tongue. This brew is one ""winter warmer"" I could drink all year long. New Belgium, when are you coming east?"
"D: Basically tastes like a hopped up Fat Tire in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing. In my opinion you can't really go wrong with anything New Belgium puts out. Would for sure buy this again."
"Overall: As with most New Belgium beers, I think they used a little too much biscuit malts. If they toned it down a bit, and maybe hopped it up slightly, it might be better. I doubt I will buy it again, with all the great beer I can get anywhere down here."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Fairly drinkable, though more body would help those bitter hops down the gullet! I think the fair carbonation lends itself to colder service, so perhaps not the best winter brew."
"Ah well."
"Mouthfeel's fine and I'm sure if you like the flavor profile this would be a fine brew. In my case, it just wasn't my cup of tea."
"Similar to fat tire, but in my opinion better. The strong pine pressence makes this stand out. Pretty decent."
"Overall this beer works for me. It's nothing unique but is definitely drinkable. There's a reason why they recommend you to drink it at three degrees celsius though, because it certainly didn't get any better as it warmed. Give it a shot, I think it's a step up from their fall seasonal..."
"Overall impression: Nice beer from NBB, I'm glad to see this one bottled this year. This doesn't fit the standard template for winter beers - it could easily be a year round."
"Felt smooth and warm, enough alcohol to notice it. A good seasonal if you do not like the darker stuff."
"Glad to see New Belgium come out with a tasty, hoppy ale."
"This is a very drinkable beer. They say it has a warming aftertaste, and is a winter ale, but it would be good year around. This is a nice easy drinking, full flavored, hopped up brew. I will definitely be having more of this beer."
"The overall impression is that of a competent brew, though the bright aromas of the bouquet got me excited for a more assertive and bitter flavor. It's drinkable and, for a winter release, light enough to serve before, during, and after dinner. It's not my favorite offering from New Belgium (another reason that I wish Saison would stick around longer), but it's interesting and worth a look nonetheless."
"But definitely a wonderfully quenching brew...sort of a cross between an ESB and a warmer. I like it."
"At the lower temp the carbonation is slower, the body is a bit thicker, and the piney flavor is more pronounced, but not dramatically improved. Let it warm."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, big and dry. Drinkability is ok, I could drink a few of these, but I think I'd want to switch to something else before too long. This beer's ok, but however you want to classify it there's better out there."
"D: Pretty good beer all-around. Nice flavors and aromas, well-crafted, easy to drink. I'm sure I'll have more this fall and winter - very worthy of a try."
"Nice burnt orange beer with a small off white head, pretty clear, no carbonation visible. Lovelly aroma piney,resinous hops with a good spiced background Taste is nice also , quite malty to start then a great hoppy , dry bitterness takes over and is only broken by peppery spice then a great after taste. Quite good on the palate, does not get boring, semi-dry finish. A nice simple winter warmer type beer in the English style IMO."
"Extremely smooth and super drinkable."
"Clear amber color with a fluffy white head. Caramel and toffee aroma, slight citrus hop on the finish. Taste has a lot of caramel. Not too sweet, just a pleasant mouth feel. The bitterness of a light citrus hop balances the sweetness. Nice full mouth feel very drinkable. The seasonals from New Belgium continue to impress."
"Mouthfeel is thick but has some carbonation and is approprite. Very good, very different beer, but I would really struggle to get more than one of these down in a night. Its kind of exhausting. This is a beer I like to revisit year-to-year. It is so unique and it is actually an effective winter brew despite staying just on the light side of the style spectrum."
"Very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability- Very nice fruity flavor, almost tastes like a fruit beer more than a winter warmer. Very tasty for whatever it is though."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D - Good. Unique flavor, mix of Fat Tire and an IPA. Lucky enough to obtain a bottled sample for this review. The classification of this beer seems a little off to me, although I can't come up with a better one."
"That makes only 2 brews from New Belgium that I'm not really pleased with.(the other is the Loft)"
"Overall, not a bad effort by the folks at New Belgium. Definitely not your ""normal"" winter seasonal."
"This beer poured to a transparent tennessee burnt orange with a fuzzy off white head about 2 fingers deep. A very visually pleasing beer with a lasting head that sticks around and pretty bubbles of corbonation that keep on rising. Unfortunately appearance is really this beer's strongest point. nose is plain and uninteresting with some mildly fruity notes. taste is almost exactly like a mack and jacks african amber for those who have tried it. puckers the mouth, a light mouthfeel and inoffensive taste brings up the drinkability score, overall not a beer I would drink again."
"This is definitely one of the best tasting winter seasonals that I've tried so far this season. Aroma is lightly sweet and a little floral and fruity. Roasted caramel malt flavours to start but the bitterness from the hops slowly takes over. Finishes slightly dry. Higher alcohol is certainly noticeable in the affects, but not too detectable in the taste. Very well balanced. Certainly a beer that I could drink all night (and did). Definitely a must try if you haven't already."
"Drinkability  This is a Winter Warmer, but is very light for the style. I think it should be tried once even if only for comparison against some of the best of the style such as Deschutes Jubelale and Bridgeports Ebenezer Ale."
"Wanted another but had promises to keep and 100 miles to go before I sleep."
"Appearance was a fairly clear, brown-amber. Nice subtle floral-hop on the nose. After a few swallows it reminded me of the textbook ESB style. The hops are plentiful but do not overpower; it's more of a strong bitterness rather than the citusy hop punch paramount in many Pacific Northwest winter seasonals. It finishes dry with mild lingering spiciness. 2° Below is one of the lighter winter seasonals available in mouthfeel and helps it to be quite drinkable, so it's surprising to learn the ABV is 6.6%. A dandy winter warmer."
"Drinkability: I only had one, but I probably could have quaffed these all afternoon/night, but I would have had to walk home. Solid must try IMO."
"edit: website says it's 6.6, about what I expected. also Sterling and Liberty hops."
