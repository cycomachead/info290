Flavor is malty sweet up front, followed by buttery floral taste, and ends with some bitter hops, though these are pretty toned down. A little metallic flavor takes away from things.

Nose of tangy caramel and hints of nut sweetness. Subtle roastiness on an overall subtle aroma. Flavors are roast and rich sweet forward, with nutty and caramel tang in the backbone, and not much to help balance. A bit jumbled and a bit cloying. Light, frothy bodied due to the carbonation, the beer has an overly sweet aftertaste, with a cloying, effervesced, frothy finish. A little too focused on the sweetness for me, with nothing to really balance.","GarthDanielson","Sep 27, 2013"

This is the second Woodstock Inn beer that I have had, and they were both diacetyl bombs. Needless to say, they have to get their processes under control to fix this.

The flavors were les than impressive, citrus hops and hints of caramel malt amongst cereal grains and a slight earthiness. Not bad, but rather washed out and ill-defined.

The smell was dominated by hops: a little floral, but mostly a strong, spicy, tangy hop smell. There was also plenty of a sweet, caramel maltiness in there too. It was an interesting mix. The taste combined these two flavors as well: one one hand, there were bready, buttery, tasted malts that ended with a touch of caramel. On the other hand, there was dry, bitter hop flavor. But to me, unlike the smell, the taste did not work out. The mixture sounds nice, and should have produced a beer that I enjoyed. But the taste was just a little off to me, and the bitterness and sweetness seemed contrary to one another, as opposed to complimentary. I think that the flavors were a bit too strong, and the beer could have benefitted from some more subtle tastes.

3.7,8.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Another selection from the BOTMC. Smells Oktoberfest-like malty with earthy centennial-like hopping. Pours to a dark golden color with a decent clingy head. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Carbonation well done, not too much nor too little. Good body. This is a very well balanced ale. Reminds me alot of a Sam's but with a bit more bitterness. For the style this hits the mark. Refreshing and balanced from start to finish. Nothing complex but a good down to earth ale. I would return to this brew.","mooseisloose","Oct 02, 2008"

Smell begins with a nice caramel covered red apple, a touch of pine resin, hints of hay and fresh cut grass. Taste is rounded out with a balance between the caramel, sweet apple, touch of dark wheat bread, some pined up earthy notes and a nice refreshing finish. Great gulper!

Its a little different (slightly more bitter & drier) but there is no mistaking the same qualities it shares with the Pig's Ear. I would think there would be a noticeable difference - IMHO there is not a significant one. Could see this working well with simple bar food, cheddar or just enjoying.

Not too impressive but a solid beer altogether.","Brad007","Jul 07, 2007"
3.85,12.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a standard pint glass, resulting in beer with little to no head. The color is bright red, whose nose is slightly sweet but very faint. The resulting beer is a very drinkable red that is a big malty, big mouth feel. The mouthfeel comes from a very carbonated beer, not in a bad way but the bubbles do dance on your tongue, and from a appearance look like a glass of soda with a constant trail of tiny bubbles rising form the bottom of the glass to the surface. The finish is a mix of the malt fading into a dry finish that has a subtle alcohol flavor. Depending on the abv, I could see this beer a as session beer, not great, but not bad either. Worth a try!","NJBeerguy","Jun 02, 2007"

4.08,19.6,4,3.5,4.5,3,4.5,"Pours with a thin head that disappates quickly. Aroma is not strong but the maltiness comes through. The first taste is definitely more malt than hops but a slightly bitter finish brings the hops. I'm a fan of a strong malt/hop balance and this brew fits the bill. Mouthfeel is a little thin but overall a good beer. I would buy this one again.","cwachtel","Jun 07, 2006"

Upon tasting, it's an onslaught of maltiness with a caramel taste and a hint of fruitiness. There's an odd underlying sourness in the taste as well. Hops are very subdued. All in all, not a bad brew, but I don't think I'd seek it out in the future.","LarryV","Mar 17, 2006"

The head was firm and had a tint of almond in it. The smell is sweet with buttery caramel malts. Rich and a bit solvent like. Bold and assertive. The taste is rich, bitter and nutty. This seems to have some Doppelbock characteristics with the Vienna or Victory malts coming through. Theres a nice roasted almond nuttiness and a pretty solid body of malt underneath. Overall, a very nice ale and one I would seek out again. Thanks, P!","pezoids","Jun 15, 2005"
3.63,6.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head over the clear coppery amber brew. Head is frothy and lasts well, with good lacing. Aroma is slightly sweet, with buttery and fruity notes. Taste starts with grain husks, which carry all the way through, with some light bitterness in the middle, and closing with a tinge of butteriness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good. Enjoyable representative of the style.","ppoitras","Apr 04, 2005"

Its a decent looking beer with a darkish amber body with a reddish tint. The head was thin but finely beaded and well proportioned. Very malty and somewhat floral and breadlike nose. Enticing to say the least. Really a full bodied, well incorporated mouthfeel. Its crisp, malty with a tremendous sense of freshness to the brew. There's a nice breadlike quality that serves the beer well. The finish comes off balanced with a true mellon-like flavor. Really impeccably crisp and quenching, this is a great sociable beer.","Hhawk06","Feb 25, 2005"

Shipyard brews generally are aok, so an endorsement of this product by their willingness to bottle it, I knew it would be better than ok, and it was, The appearance was a nice amber red with a very nice off white head. The smell was a hoppy, fruity combination. An initial malt taste lasted to mid-palate, then the citrus hops expressed themselves and the brew had a light hoppy finish.

Aroma is vaguely roasty, sweet, somewhat nutty and bready. Nice. Flavor is much the same, with a nice pale malt sweetness, touched with a bit of roasty bittersweetness and breadiness. Hops are mild, balance the malts nicely and really only lend bitterness at the very end of the sip. Slight pear esters, mostly in the back end and in the finish.
