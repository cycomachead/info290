"I had a review. It was pretty good. Somehow it did not upload despite hitting ""Review"". The beer is amber and has a white head. Smells mildly of malt. Tastes about the same with a nutty quality to the finish. Nice body weight and feel. Decent but nothing exciting."

"8/10 review....Pours amber medium dark, light layer of white. Light malty nose, caramel hints. Toffee sweet, quite toasty. Slight spices in there too. Very light carbonation and a mild hop burn. Starts strong, bitter a little too pushy."

"Great, easy to drink, crisp. Bitter, but not overly so.  Great with a burger or sub. One of the better ones from full sail, comparable in quality to the Amber I think."
"Funny...I find myself thinking this is just short of great, but only because it's so solid in appeal. Nothing sharpish or spiky. Solid is what I'm left with & there's nothing wrong with that."

"Good session ESB from Full Sail. Pour a reddish amber with medium white head that dies down to thin clinging lacing. Nose of is subtle with hints of caramel malts, light herbal hops, and some light bread qualities. Flavor is mild caramel malts with light hops bitterness to the back, mellowed out by the malt. Very nice mouth feel with light bittering hops on the aftertaste. Nice all around session beer for the more novice beer nut or a good one for large get-togethers."

"This pours out a clear walnut amber color with a small very white head. The nose offers a moderate malt scent, a little grainy, with a faint hop presence. And though faint in aroma, bitterness comes through well to taste, providing a good offset to the strong malt flavor. It's too bad hop flavor is a bit lacking. This feels more like a generic amber American ale than an ESB. It's drinkable enough, but not worth a special release."

"This is a typical example of the style with a good grain profile it simply does not set itself apart from say a Fullers ESB."
""
"Quite enjoyable."
"Overall this is pretty tasty, I will have to get another six pack of this for the weekend."

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting, white, fluffy head. Aroma is of piney hops and caramel malt. Body is medium and smooth. Piney, earthy hops dominate the flavor, with caramel malt and some fruity esters in the background. Finish is long and hoppy. Overall it is good session brew."

"Wow, Full Sail. What went wrong here? I am a fan of your ""amber ale", so, I was expecting something good with your ESB. I've been a homebrewer since 1992, so, I can tell when something has gone wrong in the brewing process, The beer starts out well enough, fairly malty and dry. But, then, uh oh. What is that WEIRD after taste, that lingers and lingers? I can only figure the brew was fermented at too warm a temperature, or something is not right with the yeast strain. I was hoping for an English style (Fullers') or American (Anderson Valley) ESB taste. Not even close. Please reformulate your recipe."

"Overall this is a really smackable beer despite it's age. Ages well LOL! The brewers at Full Sail nailed the style on this one. Definitely worthy of a shot and I will look for this next spring!"

"Great stab at the style. Nice homey caramel malts that showed grain notes with some fruit notions. Everything worked except for the hints of artificial flavors that faintly showed up. Very good but not quite what you'd find in the UK. I would pick up a six of this anytime."
""
"The taste most definitely begins sweet and malty and ends nice and bitter with a quick lingering finish. At the same time it seems to be missing something that I like about ESB's but I can't pin my finger on it."

"Overall - I'm not an expert on ESB as a style, but I tend to rate beers on how they taste, not if they have held to tradition for the style. FS ESB is a good beer that is easy to drink and definitely can have more than one without feeling bombed, boozed and busted. Buy it, drink it, share it."
""
""
""
""
"I have had a couple of six packs so far and have a few conclusions to pass along. Tasty beer though a bit on the sweet end of the ESB spectrum. Hops are a bit less prominent than I would have expected. Since Deschutes and Bridgeport have quit bottling ESB's this will have to suffice for now. Always on the lookout for this style of beer."
""
""
"O - Very nice ESB, Would definitely enjoy this again."
"Overall - A commendable ESB from Full Sail. Nothing special, but its full flavor and ease of drink makes this a beer I wouldn't mind having again. The kind of beer you'd drink and watch baseball with, or maybe that's just me."
"Overall, this is easily one of my favorite Bitter styles. It's robust roasted malts and lack of over-the-top sweetness make it manly as hell. This concoction reminds me of unfinished wood, tough leather, and black iron. WARNING: This beer may accelerate mustache and/or beard growth."
"The Verdict: Not bad. Taken on it's own merits as a fairly balanced brew it's just fine, but compared to a quality ESB it falls short."
""
""
"Either way, it was pleasant."

"Label says, ""Enjoy by 7/20/13," and ""available for 90 days."" That's a shame (about the availability). Mmm. Big malty aroma that's rich enough to remind me of a maibock. There's a mix of sweet toasted bread with mild cherry and a touch of strawberry. Then a mild lemon spice hop character kicks up as the beer finishes to give a lovely balance to the fruit and barley. Very nice beer overall. Fruitier than other ESBs I've enjoyed, but well balanced, if a touch thick. I'd love to try it from a cask."
"Overall- I'd say a solid 7/10. For the most part, I feel Full Sail offers a good quality for a good price. THis beer is just that. It follows the style, is a good beer, but I prefer to drink ESBs in either early Spring or Autumn. I think for the rest of the public, this beer's idea to offer for the summer months may not be as profitable as possible."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, grain, and nutty aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells slightly better than it tastes."
"O- A great ESB that is paired nicely with the hops. The sweet toffee and carmel balance the orange citrus bite of the hops."
""
""
"Pretty big for and ESB, but coming from and American brewer it is nothing new. Balance is this beers most noticeable trait and it works from start to end."
""
"solid beer, but nothing to write home about"
""

"D - Very drinkable. Nice ESB with a bit of extra hops flavor."
""

"4.0 D: Well made beer. No faults and great flavors."
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is full of biscuit malt, with a hint of pine and earth from the hops. The flavor is very similar. There is a good dose of sweet biscuit malt, as well as some toffee, earth, grass and a hint of pine. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: This is a great beer, and a very good representation of the style. Very tasty, and high marks for drinkability. This is an absolute steal at $3 a bomber. Now I wish I'd bought a case. I'd love to see this in regular production someday."
"Medium bodied and much more flavorful and interesting that the aroma suggests.  Surprisingly hop forward providing a nice dry bitterness that counters the strong malt sweetness. Resinous with a grassy/piny flavor along with a slight citrus character.  This is countered mid-palate by sweet malt with hints of caramel and toffee.  As in the nose, the fruit notes become more apparent in the finish as it warms.  Decently balanced and easy to drink with a slightly dry finish.  "

"Pours a very nice hazy dark golden amberish color, nice carbonation, with a little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is mostly malty, with a hint of hops, with a nice touch of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, a touch of hops, bready. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall a nice brew for a HOT day."
"The taste was not quite what I wanted. It's more bitter than I'd like for an ESB. I prefer more balance. The variety of hops is not one I'm particularly fond of either. However, given some breathing time, I got a bit more malt flavour out of it. It went well with pork. So, it wasn't at all a bad experience. I just wasn't particularly impressed with it either. It's just got that typical American craft hoppiness to it that annoys me."
""
"Very good session beer. Very approachable and good to meet the range of a broad beer audience. It went over well, and now there are a few more people who declare themselves interested in ESB's. My job as a BA was done."
"Taste shows none of the astringency I was smelling...just a nice, toasty bread-biscuit malt with a nice sidecar of hop flavor. Finishes balanced and mild. Mouthfeel might be the best part of this beer; Full Sail nailed it. Its full-bodied but not sweet and has a awesome creamy mouthfeel. I really like this one. It is one of my favorite beers in the ESB category and also one of the better Full Sail offerings I have had. Good price as well...I'll have another please, sir!"
""
"Overall, this is a very good ESB from an American brewery. It doesn't stray too far from the style guidelens while still throwing it's own twist into the mix. It also donates some proceeds to charity! Check it out if you see it, it really is quite good."
""
"Overall not bad, better than a lot of other esb beers, decent copper reddish malts, toffee and caramel, and decent earthy hops, fairly drinkable with interesting hop characteristics that get a bit interesting and weird and a bit bitter."
"O- A very nice and easy drinking beer. Will pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
"CHEERS!"
""
""
"O- This is a good tasting beer and very enjoyable."
""
"Anyhow, I loved this take on ESB. A bit Brit with a slight American/West Coast twist. All Challenger hops brought out some sweet earthiness, and added to the authenticity. Mild orange and creamy feel/flavors, lovely malt presence. Beautifully balanced, a bit more bite on the hop end than I would expect, but still just so smooth and drinkable. I do wish these were available in 6 packs . . . or on cask??? Heheheh."
"Kudos and slainte!"
"Good drinking with simple complexity (oxymoron?). It’s really a deceptively simple beer that can be an easy drinking spring day beer or a good sipping, clear flavored beer to be enjoyed slowly. Nothing gets lost or muddied and is enjoyable form beginning to end."
"All in all a good brew. Caramel sweet with a mild hop flavor. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This one is good...Although ESB is not my fav (IPA,Porters, & Browns are) this one works out well, comparable to well know Bass, or Red Hook ESBs/Bitters, but hard to compete with 'true' UK Bitters like Flowers, or perhaps Boddingtons...Probably 'WON'T' be looking for this one again, but not bad...Chasing-Cheers :~)"

"22 oz bomber pours a cloudy deep amber with adequate head and lacing. Aroma is rich toffee malt with light floral and spicy hops. Taste is caramel and bready malt, spicy and grassy hops. Nice smooth clean mouthfeel. Nothing real special here but certainly nothing offensive. Not a bad choice for a good session beer."
""
""
"Overall: an easy to drink beer that leans a bit on the sweeter side, but is brought a bit into check with the bitterness. Sessionable beer."
""
""
"The drinkability was pretty, I like a nice ESB and I'd happily drink a couple of these. Overall, a pretty nice brew. Full Sail isn't among my personal favorite breweries, but every so often they put out a brew I really like a lot. This is one of those brews. Try it when you see it."
"Overall - actually a pretty interesting beer to consider. Not a bad taste either."

"Poured into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Pours a medium copper amber, nice two finger very light tan head with good retention and lacing. Looks good. Aroma dominated by bready malt with surprising faint hop and Belgian spices. Flavor also full bready and biscuity malt with slightly citrus hops and light fruit. Finishes with malt, a nice hop kick and a bit of drying citrus. Nice mellow flavor progression and finish. Medium bodied with some creaminess. I really enjoyed this take on a ESB."
""
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a copper color with a nice off white head. The smell is a little malty, some bread and caramel malts, with a little hop presence. The feel is medium. The taste has a little bit of hop bite, the taste is of bread and caramel malts, a little citrus, some more bitterness on the way down, light bitterness though."
"OVERALL: This is a very easy-going, exceptionally well-balanced E.S.B. It is the strongest offering I have tasted from Full Sail so far."
""
"Some toffee and caramel malt flavors. Definitely not a flavor bomb type of beer, should be very pleasing to old timers who like tradition and mild flavors."
"O: This is my first Full Sail brew, and I enjoyed it. I like the ideas of single-hop beers for educational purposes, and the label indicated Challenger (UK) hops with 5 malts. Worth a try."
"Strong aroma is malty with fruity, earthy and woody notes. It pours a clear coppery with a pale yellow-tan head of about average thickness and persistence. Flavor has a woody core with a fairly, but not fiercely, bitter overtone and hints of caramel, grass and horehound. Smooth, firm texture is quite fizzy and lively. This ""initial pub offering"" is worth an investment!"
""
""
""
"O- Well executed, nice to see an ESB as a special edition."
""
"Overall: It's just a nice, balanced, tasty beer. Sometimes, it's a long, wearying road to finish off a bomber, but not the case here, as it was gone before I knew it."
"O- A lovely pint at the pub. A bit heavy to be a session beer, but a very approachable easy drinking ESB. A wonderfully consistent producer."
"Nice blend of bitter and sweet -- very tasty and easy-drinking."
"Good beer but this is something I would prefer in a 6 pack rather than a bomber size. Something I could put back a few of. Session worthy without the session availability unfortunately."
""
"Overall, a good , well-rounded beer...not a bad E.S.B at all."
"- This beer is solid and is something I will certainly be buying more of while I can. I would recommend you do the same. Solid balance, flavor, and sweetness, and doesn't contain Full Sail's flagship yeast character that so many of their other beers have. Certainly a nice change for them."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great ESB, perhaps the best I've ever had. Nice and bitter but not overly powerful. The beer is strong at 6.5% yet still feels very light and easy to drink. I would highly recommend this anyone who otherwise enjoys a strong pale ale or IPA."
""
"O - Hard for me to place, but it tastes pretty good."
"22 oz bottle from Lamb’s Thriftway in Wilsonville OR. $4.49 Love the label ..with the share motif, very nice. Also proceeds go to educational charity Dark amber/red ale with a very nice looking thick,creamy eggshell white head. Nice aromas of resiny and floral hops..balanced by caramel malts. Taste is very balanced between the hops and the extra chewy caramel/toffee malts..slight bitter after taste. Nice The mouthfeel is were ,for me,this really gets great..its so balanced ,yet so smotth,carbonation just right..slips over the tongue yet still leaves great sensation .Excellent. A tasty well balanced beer very English in its palate that i could drink a few of without doubt"
"(PS The other two previous griped mildly about price. $4.19 at our neighborhood Fred Meyer is completely reasonable to me)"
"The taste could have been a bit stronger, and the mouthfeel finished a bit watery for my liking. Not worth the price, nor do I want 22 ounces of it."
"All 4's."
