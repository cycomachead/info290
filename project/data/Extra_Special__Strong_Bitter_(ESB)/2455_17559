3.75,6.5,,,,,,"This was an interesting beer. I don't think this tastes like other ESBs that I've tried. It pours nicely into a SA Perfect Pint and displays some head and lacing but when I tried it with a Nonic there was virtually no head and no lacing, The color is amber with a hint of orange. The taste and aroma are hard to describe but I would lean toward earthy. I will say that I enjoyed the beer. It seems to be a nice transition to the fall for me although I would prefer a slightly darker color.","JimKal","Nov 09, 2014"

4.5,27.8,,,,,,"I would love to know the story behind both the beer’s name and its label, but it was time for more important things, like the Crack! I love a brimful CAN and when this one revealed itself, I was ready to go. I initiated an inverted Glug, leading to a near-rebellious two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention. I sat back as the battle raged, sticky lacing appearing in the wake of the fighting. Rebellion should not be without casualties. The first rule of The CANQuest ™ is to talk about The CANQuest ™. Color was a slightly hazy Amber (SRM = 7.3, thanks to the brewery for providing that bit of 411). Nose had a grassy honey-sweetness that really put me more in mind of a lager. Mouthfeel was medium and although I was still getting that honey flavor, it was accompanied by an earthy maltiness and an intensely grassy hoppiness (IBU = 42). Holy rebelliousness! I CAN drink this all day!  The grassy bitterness was offset nicely by the biscuit maltiness on the tongue. It was on the finish that it really came together, though. It was like summer in the country with biscuits and honey after mowing the grass. I really am a fan of this one and wish that it were more widely available.","woodychandler","Aug 19, 2014"
3.53,0.3,,,,,,"A big shout out to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is bready, a bit of hops. Taste is also bready, some caramel sweetness, a touch of hops is present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while I am not a big fan of this style, this beer was tasty and enjoyable.","tone77","Aug 12, 2014"

Moderately soapy, intensely earthy, almost mineral-like, this is very, very green. Bitterness is on the lower side of medium, there's an almost resiny hop character here. Grain and yeast are secondary here, especially the latter. Medium-light in body with fairly high carbonation, this finishes with plenty of hop flavor on the finish. Decent, though not particularly enjoyable.","DefenCorps","Nov 25, 2010"
3.63,3.1,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"22oz. bottle courtesy of BucketBoy. Pours a translucent copper with a quarter inch, loose, cream-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head eventually dissipates into a cluster of foam around the edges of the glass. Thick slashes of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose suggests toasted, light malt with a trace of fruit. Taste expresses quite a but of grain - somewhat close to a sour mash flavor, but not quite. It's also slightly tart with perhaps a trace of caramel malt and a light lingering bitterness between quaffs. The mouthfeel is the best aspect of this beer. Consistency is medium-light with a pleasant carbonation and a semi-dry finish. A decent ESB. Not my favorite example of the style, but quite respectable nonetheless.","Jwale73","Nov 21, 2010"

Smells faintly like sweet malt and caramel. Earthy flavors from the hops are very prominent with a warming sweetness and mild alcohol. Fairly malt forward and really on target for the style I think. I feel like a lot of other breweries overhop their bitters, which doesn't really make sense to me. This ones an exception.","drunkboxer1","Sep 21, 2009"

3.85,9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Hmmm. Well, this is definitely an American style ESB. There is the typical nuttiness and dry biscuity malt, but also far more hoppiness than usual for the style. That being said, it works here. Unlike Ding, I won't be hung up on the style parameters here and simply enjoy the beer for what it is. Pouurs a nice coppery color, but the head fades a little too quickly. Nice slightly nutty aromas with some of that biscuity malt and some earthy/spicy hops. The taste, to my mind, nicely balances the classic ESB flavors with a nice, and surprising, jolt of hops. They by no means dominate the beer, but merely add another dimension and take the beer into a more indeterminate style. Good carbonation, and a very nice drink.","Georgiabeer","Feb 22, 2009"

There is some decent retention and lacing, but it looks just about right. It smells of sweet malts, but lacks a real hop aroma. There is a bit of earthiness, and a tiny bit of a floral character. The taste is nice and sweet, like golden raisins. A bit of toffee and caramel but not overpowering. Not much in terms of buscuity flavors. Minimal bitterness, with an earthy spiciness. Nice and balanced without a hint of alcohol. No estery flavors. Good burst of carbonation, but not incredibly full. Very easy drinker.

Some grainy, breaded malts and a mineral note reminiscent of sourdough give way to a bit of sweet fruity esthers from the yeast that add pear and mango. Finishes very dry and bitter.

Slightly bready, more toasty though, with an earthy quality. Medium bodied, average carbonation, decent texture with a bit of pop from the CO2 but not enough to overpower the mouthfeel. Good stuff overall, quite drinkable and nicely balanced.","DrJay","Aug 11, 2008"

It poured a light golden body with no head to speak of. It did, however, leave good lacing about the glass. The smell was of honey and possibly some hops but everything was very muted and mild. The taste was extreme on the hops, both bittering and floral up front. Honey, some malts and alcohol followed which faded into a pleasant semi-sweet finish. The mouthfeel was bitter at first with a very smooth aftertaste, mild carbonation and a good round semi-sweetness that tied things together well.

Feels very good in the mouth with a very nice mild burn and bite on the palate. It's a very drinkable ESB. ESB is not one of my prefered styles, but I could drink a few of these.
