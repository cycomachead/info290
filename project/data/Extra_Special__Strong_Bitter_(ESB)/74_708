Toasted malt flavors up front quickly followed by dark malt with chocolate notes. Earthy floral hop flavors emerge through the middle to the end with buttery and toasted malt character.

I ha this one as my opened on 1-4-11 and to be honest I wasn't sure that I believed I got the right beer. I asked the bar tender about it and they assured me it was the right one. The color was a nice reddish tone, that works for me. The smell was a little spicy but nothing at all strong. And the flavor was just not there. Rather upsetting.","Knapp85","Mar 24, 2011"

3.51,-7.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured from bottle with freshness date Nov 2010 into tulip glass. Chestnut copper color opaque at top and clears towards the bottom. Sweet caramel smell, but not too strong.

4.3,13.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a clear dark amber with reddish highlights with a small thick head that slowly goes into a film with very good lacing.

Could drink a few of these in a sitting.","bob3701","Mar 02, 2010"
4.7,23.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"There was only a trace of foam laying across the top of the beer when it was brought to me. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity and ruby highlights. Nose was much spicier than I anticipated. I liked the intermingling of the cinnamon with some sort of mint, spearmint, perhaps. Definitely not peppermint. Mouthfeel was full with a taste like a chocolate candy cane. Maybe I was wrong about it not being peppermint. It had a minty flavor on the tongue, at any rate. Finish had a breathtakingly minty quality. Damn, was this tasty! Do they bottle this one? Or better yet, put it in a CAN? Very refreshing, in a minty sort of way.","woodychandler","Jan 02, 2010"
3.97,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A dark mahogany color, relatively clear with a fair off-white head and little sign of lacing. The aroma offers deep malt and light peach hops and juniper. The flavor brings malty licorice evergreen, slightly resinous but generally on the light side and fairly drinkable. The hop goodness is sweet and there's a bready barley-malt base with a touch of licorice. Though slightly different from the bottle version, still a very solid holiday brew.","Durge","Dec 29, 2009"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Last time I had this it was perfectly balanced between malt and hops. Good butter flavor from the Ringwood yeast. Biscuity malt flavor.

3.87,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"This is one of the December craft beers of the month at West on Centre, a local restaurant in West Roxbury. Served in the bottle and poured into a pilsner style glass. Dark brown color with a medium sized head. Smelled of cinnamon and pine trees. Taste was perfect for this time of year: nutmeg, brown sugar, and other Christmas spices. Much heartier mouthfeel than other Xmas ales on the market. Due to its rich body and robust flavor, it may not be the best beer to pair with dinner. More of a dessert beer. A great cold weather, holiday brew. I just wish I could find more of it.","morebeergood","Dec 21, 2009"
3.7,-2.6,3,3,4,4,4,"The feel of this beer is just right got this time of year. It has a bit more of a body than a fall of summer beer. It's something to have during the holiday season that is a bit more filling but drinks really well.","Duhast500","Dec 20, 2009"
3.66,-3.7,4,3,4,3,4,"It is very drinkable and smooth for the amount of bitterness. I have had more unique winter ales, but this one has a strong sense of completion and flavor character which is memorable.","Minotaur","Dec 20, 2009"
4.12,8.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A really nice beer. Heavy on the caramel for an ESB, but the hops provide a nice balance. Not sure if i love the dark fruits, presumably from high lovibond crystal, but overall a solid beer.","bum732","Dec 17, 2009"
4.13,8.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked November 2010. Sampled on December 10, 2009. The pour is an attractive ruby red with excellent clarity and ab out a quarter inch light tan head that fizzles after a couple moments. The aroma is moderately hopped with a variety of bitter scents along with caramel malts. A mouthfeel that can be characterized as medium to heavy and maybe a tad creamy. The taste is more like a stong ale and less like a spicy Christmas ale but it is likeable. Gritty McDuff's makes a decent bitter ale and this is a slightly more pungent variation on their most recognized recipe.","puboflyons","Dec 10, 2009"
3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"12 oz. bottle with November '09 notched; sampled March '09. Brewed with UK pale and crystal malts, roasted barley, Cluster, Styrian and Yakima Goldings, and Saaz hops. OG 1.064, FG 1.016, 28.5 IBUs. The beer is a crystal-clear dark ruby, with low carbonation and a finger of tan head. Little sweet in the nose, malty, with fruity alcohol, floral hops and dark crystal malts. Similar on the palate, with leafy/floral, almost spicy hops, sweet crystal malts, a hint of roast and a sturdy bitterness. Flashes of alcohol here and there. It has a medium body with medium carbonation and a dry finish. This beer is a nice blend of ESB and winter warmer characteristics that, while not a quaffer, is definitely not a sipper either. A tasty winter ale.","mmmbeer","Dec 08, 2009"
3.38,-11.1,3,2.5,3.5,4,4,"A little round in the mouth, balanced by a wheat-like taste and some crispness in the carbonation. Finishes pretty well. Again, like an IPA with winter spices. Hard to argue with a few of these.","TLove","Dec 02, 2009"

2.93,-22.9,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Pours a deep amber-red with nary a head to be found. Carbonation is very subdued. Malty aroma with little hops detected. Taste is on the malty side, hops are way in the background. A somewhat cloying sweetness, diacetyl seems a little out of control resulting in a butterscotch aftertaste. I don't really care much for this beer and would not purchase it again.","LarryV","Nov 22, 2009"
3.71,-2.4,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Served on-tap at the Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine. The beer is a clear brown color with hints of ruby. Almost no head, just a skim of bubbles on top. The aroma isn't anything significant, just some maltiness and a few spices, but nothing strong enough to identify. The flavor is driven by the malts. It has a molasses sweetness present throughout. There are some bitter spices the make their way forward in the flavor near the end (although they are present as soon as you taste the beer, they aren't as strong). There is a crisp clarity to the flavor that also has some esters. It has a fairly light body and maybe a slightly above medium amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer; there is nothing about it that you could grow tired of. I feel that the Gritty's Christmas is a pretty unique winter beer in the Portland microbrew landscape. It isn't strong like the Shipyard Prelude or Geary's HSA, nor is it full of winter spices like the Geary's and Shipyard's standard winter ales. And for that, it is a recommendable session beer for those cold Maine nights.","ToasterChef","Nov 21, 2009"

A sweet nutty aroma with a good amount of earth in the nose as well. Taste starts with some spicy hops, toffee, and tart apples. Midway some roasted malts and biscuits emerge.

The nose is sweet nickel, caramel malts and a light, seemingly Ringwood note. On the palate, dry malts play with sour English ale notes. There is a bit of malt bitterness (roasted malts?) in the back. Hops come out toward the end, but never achieve any really juicy, tasty volume levels. Mouthfeel is a touch acidic (in a good way), but the malts are not fleshed out very well and the carbonation is just medium -- which in this case seems either too weak or too strong, but not just right.

3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Picked up a sixpack of this yesterday, and decided I'd try it on tap at Cole's to see what it's like "fresh" and "as intended" before opening a bottle. The pint arrived dark -- darker than expected for a purported ESB, at least -- a ruddy bronze witha yellowed-parchment, creamy-dense foam cap. Aromas of candied orange peel and buttermints, some caramel maltiness, and a whiff of bergamot-infused tea leaves. Sturdy flavor, with mild citric and leafy-spice hops, candied citrus fruit rinds, and just a dash of butterscotch/caramel. This seems pretty typically "English," except there's just a bit too much spicy bite to the hops. Also, the mouthfeel is far too heavy to be mistaken for anything other than an American craft beer. It's big, imposing, and slick -- almost syrupy. Much bigger mouthfeel than most ESBs I've tried. This is not actually a bad thing for a winter seasonal, but it would be a bit thick for any other time of year (I noticed the bottles I bought are supposed to hold up through September 2007). But since the timing is right, I call this one suitably and seasonably drinkable right now.","orfeu","Dec 21, 2006"

The taste isn't really bitter but the after-taste has a lingering bitterness in the throat. This is somewhat drinkable, although I probally wouldnt buy it again. It is very average and just about straight 4's. A bit watery on the mouthfeel and looks thicker than it is. Has a very light fizzy texture in the mouth and goes down smooth.
