"Pours a deep copper color with a nice tan head.  Scents of roasted chestnuts on the nose with a floral hop note.  Lacing with every sip.  Huge hop flavor for an ESB.  A bit out of balance for the style.  Toasted, nutty, with a hint of hazelnuts on the front with an explosion of citrusy hops on the back.  Very sessionable  beer an especially nice in the fall.  Yard's English style ales stand up to the big ones from Great Britain."

"Cask offering at O’Neal’s Pub. The cask variety adds an element of sourness to the normally bitter nature of this beer. Nice woody, dried fruit aroma, more dried fruit in the taste. This is more of a sipper, bringing to mind dubbels and sours. Nicely done!"

"Pours a deep, rich, clear brown. Like nice, handmade antique furniture brown. Has a good cap of creamy off-white head that just sits there throughout and provides a lot of sticky lacing. The aroma is dark bread malt and dark fruit sweetness. The taste starts with the malt sweetness and transitions into the nice hops bitterness. There's a great weight to the body and a silky mouthfeel. This is a great ESB."

"O: Not a world-class brew, but a damn good offering from fellow Philly locals. This one would truly shine in a bar setting, or even at a dinner table. On its own, there's better choices, but this definitely isn't disappointing. Worth a shot."

" The flavor has a subtle toffee and toasted malt presence with yeast bringing out a woody hop flavor near the middle with a slight alcohol warmth in the taste with slight spice and creamy caramel. Overall not a bad beer, pretty malty example of the style and on the high end of the alcohol for and ESB, but pretty tasty I would enjoy this on draft if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very enjoyable, as part of the yards variety pack I enjoy it as often as all the others in the pack (except the brawler). A good but not great beer."
""
""
"o: A very good American representation of an English style ESB. Not as malty sweet as it might be, or rather more bitter than it might be, but that may be the result of the American influence. I would buy this again next time I'm in the Philadelphia area, since although it is highly a regarded brewery in the eastern PA/NJ area, it is not widely distributed."

"Overall: This is a pretty good beer, but not one of my favorite beers from yards. I much prefer the Tavern Ale, Tavern Spruce and George Washington Tavern Porter over this ESA."
""
""
""
""
"OverallI may get this again, or the IPA but most likely the DIPA. Damn tasty!"

"Overall, I am not too happy with this beer. It's good, don't get me wrong, but don't think I will seek this out in bottle again. I have had this on tap and it was a different experience. A much better one. The corn aroma and the Band_Aid flavours really put me off as well as it was a bit too bitter for my taste and, I feel, the style if indeed it is an Extra Special/Strong Ale. I will still give it a mid to high 3's out of five. It's not crap, but it's just not for me."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit of malts. Taste is well balanced malts an hops, a bit light, easy drinking but just seems to be lacking any punch. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, but nothing great."
""
""
"O - This is a nice beer full of malty goodness. A slight bitter hop character tames the sweetness. Very soft mouthfeel. A good beer to sit back and relax with. It would be easy to drink a few of these in one sitting."
""
""
"Served in a big English imperial pint nonic. Pulled from the fake hand pump. Plenty of carbonation and a nice sudsy foam, with lots of lacing in the glass. No aroma to speak of. Winey and tastes like some new kind of Long Island Iced Tea. On the cask at Local 44 in Philadelphia. Interesting but I don't get it. [Transcribed from notes written on 05/30/2012 visit.]"
"O - Nicely brewed to style, easily drinkable, pleasant flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smell is strong noble hop and nice sweet malt. Taste is smooth easy hop and malt. So smooth and drinkable. Really nice brew on cask. Just not sure how it would translate to bottle...very worth it from cask."
""
""
""
""
"Toffee malt and fruity esters on the palate. Hops contribute a a pronounced bitterness, but one that's well below IPA levels. A slight solvent presence on the finish detracts from the experience. I think I'd pay a little extra and pick up some Fuller's ESB over this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fairly solid ESA/B but the dark fruit seems to get a bit more medicinal feeling than I would like it to be towards the end of the experience. Still another addition to a solid Yards lineup from what I have tasted."
""
""
"O: Pretty good ESB. Looks nice in the glass and has the right flavor. A bit mild though."
"Kind of an odd combination, with fruity esters and floral hops really dominating. Don't think I've had a beer with more floral hop flavor. The minerally quality and pretty bitter finish make things even weirder."
""
"Honestly, all of there beers were steller including this one. Colour, taste, smell, and mouth feel I wouldn't put at a traditional ESB (British), but for a American take, 'pretty spot on eh'. This had a great balance of the malt and hops as per par, and for most British ESB's in the 5% - 3.5% range, at 6%, they hid this very well!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A hint of staleness, but the flavor grows on you. There's an interesting tangy-ness. In the first one I drank, it seemed stronger. Maybe it's what I was eating. Airy bitterness on the finish. Lingers nicely. Tangy-ness yes, but very little sweetness - which is something I like. First drinks felt flat, but then it got a bit more body. Do beers change like wine after they're open?"

"O - If I had the option of Yards on Long Island I'd be happy. A nice craft beer that could eaily lure the BMC crowd."
"Substantial brew but not my favorite from Yards."
"O- A solid beer that I would love to try on cask. I am really starting to try ESB and I am really enjoying this. Definitely will be pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Flavorful ESB, true to the style for sure."
""
""
"Paired well with my dinner of pork, mashed potatoes and gravy."
"O = Now that I verified it is an ESB, I'm quite impressed."
"Overall – Easy drinking and a pretty good taste. A brew and one to try if you get a chance."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A pretty good attempt of the style, but hop character was a bit withdrawn and the malt sweetness was big. Almost could be considered a dessert beer, this would pair best with sweet and savory dishes."

"The beer pours a rich and deep caramel/reddish brown with a tiny head that lingers for quite a while. It left some lacing on the glass. The aroma is rich with candy sweet malts with just a touch of hops noticeable. The flavor is very well balanced between bold and robust malt sweetness with flavors of molasses and twizzlers noticeable that is very balanced with a delicate and lingering hop bitterness. The hops taste earthy and grassy but are mostly just noticeable through the bitterness. The MF is medium bodied and very smooth. Overall this is a decent ""E.S.A"" and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Very nice attempt at the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Tasty and drinkable. I'm glad that I have some bottles left."
""
"O - It was never gonna be stellar; however, this beer lost its opportunity to be my go-to-beer with the lousy finish. I'll try it again, but I suspect the bittering hops had a lot to do with that fresh-cut-lawn taste. gag."
""
"Clean and dry, just that damn overbearing fruit."
"Overall, this is fairly well balanced. Yards claims this is their first ale and it is a good start."
""

"Extra Special Ale came to me looking real nice out of the firkin. The color is a bold brown with light golden hues towards the sides up to the light. Rising bubbles with a off white dense head that stuck around. Smell is on the malty side with caramel and some faint pale malt. This fresh version brings out nice earthy hoppy appeal with some citrus. I've never had this as fresh before and it shows. Taste hits the spot, refreshing with a mix of malt a apparent English yeast strain, some nutty appeal and some earthy hops towards the end. It all melds nicely leaving me sipping more. Feel is mediumish with some bright bubbles felt on the tounge. After all the hubbub, the aftertaste is earthy and fresh and nice. I was pleasantly surprised in this one. A beer I always thought was sub par actually has class, it all depends on the serving type and freshness. Bottles of this would be a no go for me, as they degrade quickly."

"Yards ESA is a Philly classic, one of the beers that got Philly on the map....The beer pours medium amber, topped with a modest white head. The head diminishes somewhat, yet retains throughout the entire pint. The aroma is perfectly malty, with some bready toastiness and some caramel notes. Tastes initially malty, toasted caramel with some biscuit notes - basically a classic bitter. A must have, especially in Philly. It is simply the beer that made Yards and Tom Kehoe famous."

"Overall: A very good ale that I'd undoubtedly have again. Dark and robust in flavor, it's definitely a beer that I'll continue to enjoy throughout the holiday season."
""
""
""
"The flavor begins quite malty, with lots of toasted bread and sweet caramel, but finishes with a surprising dose of bitterness. Hops are mostly of the grassy, herbal variety, and are very much in a traditional English style to my palette. This beer has a particularly long and lingering aftertaste with strong bitterness and herbal flavors hanging around for some time. Carbonation and body and both moderate; making this an easy one to drink; although it's a bit higher on the abv scale than its counterparts. Booze is not noticed in the nose or taste."

"Fresh bottle from Super Buy Right. Extremely generous off white head on a golden body. Creamy, yeasty on English hops. Great drinkability. Drying finish. Not the style bang on, but a good Englished up ale.Above average mouthfeel. Satisfying, and good by itself or with food."
""
""
""
""
"VERY NICE, WORTH PICKING UP!"
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer from the bottle is made much better from the cask."
"Brown in color with a nice head. Smells malty and delicious. A little bready and sweet. Palate is sharper than expected with a noticeable hop presence. Sweet, malty and earthy. Pretty nice flavor profile overall. Mouthfeel is mildly creamy with adequate body. A solid brew from Yards."

"Great representation of an english ESB... all i'll say is: seek it out on cask or hand pump (always available @ the abbaye in my 'hood) - its a different experience from the bottled version and the result is much more enhanced. I overlook this brew at the abbaye due to excellent rotating taps and when I come back to this favorite standby... I ask myself 'why the separation?'"
"overall = This style of beer might not be my cup of tea, but I feel as if it still could have been done better. I'm definitely not disappointed, but due to the B+ rating here, and the packaging of the beer, my hopes were kind of high. Slightly above average beer."
"but overall drinkability is outstanding... 6% - have a few enjoy the Phils and stay taught."
"Surprisingly, I don't see this one available much on tap or single bottles for take out. Oh well. Pours a slightly hazed amber with a good-sized fluff of white head that recedes a bit, leaving some moderate lacing behind. Nice smell, basic, caramel malts and a good balance of non-threatening hops. Good caramel hops on the tongue, earthy and herbal hops, giving a great mild bitterness to balance the malty sweetness. I really like this beer. Medium body and quite good for a relaxing session."
"Overall: A decent ESB. Probably nothing i would search out again."
"O- Overall it’s a decent beer, easy drinking and tasty, nothing amazing or unique, simply a well-made easy drinking beer."
"O: I think this is a great example of an ESB. I would totally order this in a bar. I wish this was distributed here in CA>"
"Final Thoughts: A very nice Extra Special. The nose was ever changing on me. Enjoy this one with a nice English dinner. Worth the buy."
"Ovrerall, solid. Sexy looking and tastes great."
"o: Not a bad brew from Yards, the lightness of this beer is good to go with bolder foods such as BBQ. This beer tends to be right on as far as mixing the bitterness and the rich maltiness. The brew also tends to be lighter on the pallet as well. The only downfall was the fact that you couldn't get a good aroma to sway the sweetness or bitterness of the beer."
"I just wish that there was more to the smell, but I feel that this is a good, true to style ESB."
"Poured this beer into my new Palm tulip. It has little bit of head which leaves a film on the beer and a bit of lacing. The beer has a nice nutty mildly roasty aroma with a bit of caramel. The taste is similar, light yet substantial, nutty and mildly roasty. There is a bit of bitterness as well, but it seems to be mostly for balance, which it does very well. It has a medium, to medium heavy mouthfeel and good carbonation. It is a very refreshing well made ESB. Great beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, although there are better beers in the style, this is still a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"Overall this is a very solid and enjoyable beer, I haven't experienced many ESB's. hopefully others are similar to this one."
"The extra alcohol doesn't detract either and can barely be felt in this beer. This is about as well balanced as an ESB gets and would be a great choice for someone trying this style for the first time. All of the flavors may not mesh well together but the earthy hops that softly linger in the aftertaste serve as a reminder of what this beer is. I certainly look forward to trying this again in the near future."
"Pours a deep red-amber color with a thick, dense, creamy off-white head. The aroma is fruity without being overly sweet, with a combination of dried strawberries, toffee, and caramel. The flavor is much more balanced if not a little hop-heavy, with characteristics of pine and earth being contrasted by malty notes of burnt caramel, toffee, and some berry sweetness. The beer has a nice medium body that stands up against the blend of flavors, but the fine, prickly carbonation (at least in this bottle) detracts somewhat. Overall, though, this one is a satisfying, hop-forward bitter that drinks like a light barleywine."
"A good example of the E.S.B. style for sure. A more aggressive bitter."
"I am really enjoying the less appreciated style quest though."
"O: solid beer and my first yards and ES."
"O - A great mixture of flavor and texture. Nice chewy grains and a slick ride."
"This beer pours out as a brownish copper color that looks quite nice in the glass. The head in pretty good too, it kinda shrinks down to a thin film that lays on top of the beer as you drink. The aroma wasn't too bad. I found it to be pretty good on the nose. The flavor kinda disappointed me a bit. I felt that the bitterness of the beer wasn't all there. I feel that it was kind of avoided or forgotten. To me this just didn't taste much like an ESB. The mouthfeel is pretty good, it's a medium body with some light carbonation."
"Appearance is an amber tone with little head. Its` smell has caramel, fruit, grass and pleasant in general. For the taste, I noted roasted malts, some hops, more sweetness. MF is a bit silky with bitterness in the finish. This ESB from Yards is a good representation of the style and was happy with it."
"This was easy and flavorful drinking here on the cask (especially for the size) and I'm glad that I gave this Yards take on an ESB a shot. I think that I could have put a couple of these down easily."
"D/o: Not too overpowering to the palate but does have a decent aftertaste. Decent alcohol content that doesn't really come over the top. Very Drinkable which pairs well with the other beers from this brewery."
"Pours a nice golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop note, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, nice little hop note, and caramel. Medium Body, nice little bitter/dry finich. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"A great sipper to enjoy while contemplating the days events. Some time in a cellar would round out its rough edges."
"D: There's a lot going on with this beer, most of which I find enjoyable. It's definitely malty and sticky, with some moderate sweetness. There's also a nice, medium hop profile, along with some yeasty esters. It manages good balance without necessarily being overly smooth or subtle."
"Medium bodied with a very good balance of earthy and citrus hops countered by a sweet malt backbone. Again, this beer is hoppier than anticipated with a nice blast of bitter earthy pine needle flavor as well as some subtle citrus rind flavor. This is quickly countered by a sweet caramel malt presence with hints of toffee, biscuit and hazelnut."
"d - Easily could have several, very drinkable."
"Classic tasting beer that's loaded with style."
"This is one of my favorite beers. Ever. At least on cask..."
"Yards Extra Special Ale, is the original beer that Yards made in 1994, so it has a special significance to Philadelphia and the drinkers that call the city of Brotherly Love home. It was one of the instrumental beers that kicked off the craft beer movement here. This is a classic beer. It has a deep reddish-amber color with a long-lasting film of white foam that sticks around. The beer smells like rich caramelized malt with a earthy woody hop aroma. There is a hint of browned apple skins and lightly toasted bread. The beer tastes malty with a graininess in the front with a slightly molassess sweetness, hints of apple cider, bruised pears and then finishes a little sticky with residual sweetness and a nice herbal hop bitterness. This beer is nice and soft and with a medium-full body. I feel like there are a few defects compared to the bet ESB examples. First, the fruit quality of this beer is a bit too subdued me, and tastes slightly oxidized. The beer is probably also a little too bitter, and the bitterness is too harsh and lingers on your tongue too long, leaving weird, almost metallic aftertaste. This is a solid beer, but I can only imagine drinking this after having only light american lagers to drink for decades and then trying this!"
"D - a nice easy drinking ale. Balanced flavors is where this beer really shines."
"Deep copper in color with a dense, brown head that settles to a thick cap leaving some lacing, this looks great. The nose has caramel, toast, light leafy hops. As it warms up, some cocoa appears. The palate opens moderate sweet, with some caramel, toasted white bread and light coffee. A little bet of mineral character seems to be present as well. Hops are present on the finish, lending a green flavor and bitterness. Medium in body, great finish with mild hops and sweetness, this beer is well-balanced and is quite enjoyable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, although there are better beers in the style, this is still a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"Drinkability: A good beer that tastes like a hearty dubbel. A sipper for a cool night. Maybe one or two per session."
"Pours a nice dark amber that looks thick, with a nice two finger head that has excellent retention. Smells like hops that seamlessly blends with caramel smoothness and breadiness. Tastes bready, with caramel maltness, a bit of fruit in the middle, and hops bitterness coming in in the end. Feels very full bodied and nicely carbonated, with the taste lingering on the tongue long after the beer is empty."
"Overall this beer is on the higher end of the ABV spectrum for an ESB but at least it leads to a robust and full-flavored beer for the style. Worth a shot."
"Pours a medium copper color with an off who're head. The nose is good yet fragile with some light caramel and some herbal and pine hops. The taste brings some slight bitterness to a toasted body with caramel and toffee. Light to medium body with flood drinkability."
"Only had a chance to drink one of these but I very much enjoyed it. It is generously hopped and has a very nice balance of malt. I would prefer a bit creamier of a finish but it does have a a hint of a creamy taste. I think a good creamy finish makes an ESB perfect. The bear laces very nicely in the glass has a fine deep amber color. I hope to make to the brewery sometime while visiting Philly. If this one is as good and drinkable as it was then I'm confident they have some other keepers."
"D: High ABV makes this one a good drinker but not a session beer."
"Worth the trip to Yards and having to share with friends."
"Bottle. Pours a very deep reddish rust mahagony color with surprisingly a very small head of slight tan that collars around the glass. Lots of wheat in the nose but thats really all I am getting. No real hops aroma. Sweet malty taste with a hop and wheat flavored after taste. Lingering bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. Not terrible but not great either. Kind of just ok."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Pretty smooth going down, nothing fancy but pretty drinkable."
"drinkability is nice. alcohol is a touch high for an ESB, and not entirely balanced. nice malt character."
"D: Not a bad little beer, ABV is pretty good, a 1 a session beer for me. Worth looking up.... I'll try some of their other stuff."
"D-overall a solid showing. A good beer to drink whenever. Went down smooth and easy and I enjoyed the flavors. Will definitely order again."
"Enjoying this beer with a plate of bangers. Pours a dark reddish brown with a head the color of white cheddar. Sweet aromas are big on molasses and garden soil, with lighter, spicy notes coming through as well. Taste of big, toasted and sweet malts intermingled with hops that are initially earthy and then linger like orange zest on the finish. Very interesting. Hefty body is perfectly suited to a beer of its flavor profile and taste amplitude. A beer whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
"Into an American pint glass; poured amber/brown with one finger of off-white head and decent lacing. Smelled of molasses, honey, and malt. The taste revealed caramel apple, maple syrup, honey, and maltiness; dissolving to a sweet finish. Creamy, medium-bodied, modestly-carbonated texture. Good session beer. Couldn't help but wonder how this would taste on cask."
"One of the most drinkable domestic ESBs I've come across, and if it weren't for the fact that it packs a little more of everything - that is: hops, malt, and alcohol - I wouldn't hesitate to give this a 5 on drinkability. It starts to wear thin after 4-5 pints - but I strongly endorse, nonetheless."
"Poured dark amber, maple syrup color with a thin, off white cap. Spotty lacing, but quite clear. Nice biscuity and bready aroma with a pinch of roast and clean herbal hops, maybe a slight citrus twang. Light bodied and slick, crisp, almost biting carbonation. A decent drinker for a hot day."
"pours a cloudy dark brown color with spare off white and and spare lacing. lively fizzy carbonation. light piney hop smell and taste that finishes slightly bitter. some light charcoal like hints. light body, and thin slick texture. average flavor duration. great session beer."
"Quite dark for an ale, but nonetheless tasty if consumed properly. Wont go out of my way to attempt again."
"This is a very good brew, has a very nice flavor and mouthfeel. It also looks good. Very good drinkability as well, would be good any time of year. Another fine brew from yards. This may be my favorite one I have tried from them so far."
"Certainly not the light drinker I was expecting but a good beer nonetheless. Thanks Vince!"
"Poured from a brown bottle into a pint glass. No identification as to the freshness. It appears a somewhat clear amber color that has some noticeable small particles stuck in suspension keeping it from being totally clear. Presents 2 fingers of slightly tanned fluffy head with fair retension that leaves a sticky about of lace clinging to the glassware in patches. Aroma is quite malty, grainy and has a little bit of mineral character to it before the hops come into play. Taste is slightly bitter upfront with a nice malt presence and again some mineral flavors come into play along with the flavors of the hops. This beer leaves a lingering hop flavor in your mouth without having much bitterness. Hops are somewhat spicy and herbal which exaggerates the mineral flavor in this beer. Light feel with moderate amount of carbonation. Nothing overly exciting about this beer but nothing to complain about either. As it warms the 6% alcohol starts to come through a bit."
"12 oz bottle in a pint glass. Pours a rich opaque brown with 1.5 fingers of head. Not very much in the aroma, maybe a little burnt sugar. The first taste is toasted malt character. The rest of the sips, I get only bitterness. Nothing too complex but probably as it should be for the style."
"Poured a dark orange to brown with beautiful clarity. Nice head retention and foam lacings on the edge of the glass. Not very aromatic, no hop aromas, but experienced light coffee and caramel scents. Coffee flavors up front that taper to pleasant carmel flavors and finish. Faint licorice undertones and the end as well. Lazy carbonation. A smooth bodied feel in the beginning with a mild hoppy finish. Could definitely have a few of these at one sitting."
"D: Nice tame, drinkable beer with good taste. Makes a very good session beer."
"D: Not bad but pretty mundane. I wish the flavor matched the nice mouthfeel with something more interesting in either the hops or the malt department."
"D-Despite my lower rating for this-I found this to be a pretty good, enjoyable beer. To me-it seems to be more of a novelty beer than anything else but its still something I'd like to revisit. Its nice to see Yard's beers around again!"
"On my next trip to PA or NJ, I'll definitely be purchasing this ESA again."
"Very drinkable, my type of stronger than normal session ale, session ale."
"Drinkability: From the second you open one of these up it begs you to drink it. Very inviting disposition both in taste and smoothness. I could drink a few of these in a night. Overall, this ale is deserving of its ""extra specialness""."
"light enough to session, but by no means light. Nice big flavors..."
"Medium body, mixed fruit and bittering hop finish. It aint bad, but if I was at a bar and ordered a pint of this, I'd be bummed."
"Ooh. That was unexpected. Modest carbonation gives way to a well-concocted balance of hops and malt, with a roasty, earthy finish. The aftertaste is almost like a coffee or espresso. I really don't get a lot of bitterness from it, but that may be my mind playing tricks on me as a result of the lasting impression of the caramel and coffee flavors. Overall, the beer is smooth with a moderate body. I could drink several of these in a sitting."
" D- This beer is a smooth drink with nice but soft flavors. The tart hops come through as the beer warms but the malt stays soft."
"D: Extra Special (as in ESA) sounds promising as if this combination of words shouldn't be thrown around. Honestly, I feel like they could have left the 'ES' out of the name and simply called it an ale. Overall, a pretty average brew. Maybe it doesn't really belong on cask as the result seemed underwhelming and contrived."
"I must say that this is a ton better than I remember it from my previous sampling. Lots of flavor and very well balanced and smooth. This is an outstanding ESB and I would actually buy a case of this, which is saying something because there are very few beers I'd want a whole case of at a time. Great session beer. Worth seeking out."
"A dark chestnut color, slightly cloudly with a mellow orange glow. The head is a modest off-white cover with decent lacing. The aroma is a nutty malt with a pleasant floral hops. Nice. The flavor brings a great paradox of bitter granny apple and orange blended with sweet caramel malt. The bitterness is clear and prominent yet there is plenty of mellow grain. Medium bodied but a slight resinous feel. Quite right for the style in my book. Plenty drinkable but it has good personality."
"Spot on for an english ESB. A very nice tasting beer to enjoy. I feel as though I should be in an Olde Tavern enjoying this."
"Thanks to edbeer for the opportunity to try this one. Served in a standard pint. Poured a deep, translucent mahogany with a half inch loose, off-white head that reduced its volume in seconds before settling into a fairly consistent skim; some slashes of lacing revealed during the tasting. Mild nose - aromatic hops on a malt backbone. Taste was caramel malts interspersed with some bittering hops that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel was light-medium with a consistent background effervescence. Not my favorite style per se, but this is a solid example of an ESB. Well worth seeking out - I'd love to try this one on cask."
"D: Manageable ABV and tasty. Definitely some odd flavors for the style... pretty dark, lower hop profile, lower than average carbonation(for a bottled ES bitter), and the sweetness is a bit deep for the style, even though it's not overly sweet. It kind of sucks to take points off a tasty beer because it's too far out of style."
"A pretty good selection in the class of moderately dark ales, my first in the ESB style. Easy to drink and easy to like."
"Pours a copper brown color with a nice slight off white frothy head that is around one finger in size. The aroma is of roasted malt and a little sweet malt with some floral hops. Taste has a roasted and caramel malt backbone which mid way through gives way to the bitterness of floral hops. The hop bite is subtle and slightly sweet. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall it is a good drinkable beer, the taste isn't exceptional but there is also nothing to make you dislike the beer and it looks very nice."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A pleasent surprise! Very well crafted ale. Highly recommend for fans of Red Ales (this beer is just as much a Red as it is an ESB)."
"Don't drink and review."
"Definitely a very sessionable brew despite the abv"
"The feel of this beer is pretty mellow. Is medium bodied and is just the right amount of carbonation."
"Personally: The beer that made Yards famous for me....a long time ago I had one of these at O'Neals on South Street and was instantly hooked. ESA is a consistent beer in my fridge."
"The gravity pour created only thin wisps of head. Color was a hazy amber, kind of like weak tea. The nose was lightly malty, definitely on the sweet side. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild bitterness on the tongue. Finish had a mild bitterness, but mothing worth getting excited about. Personally, I felt it was the least of the three, to include Brawler and PHL PA, on that particular Cask Night."
"Note: Hand pumped is the way to go on this one, but the bottles, although slightly more mild, are still very good in their own right."
"A nice amber color. Not much head to it. The aroma was very faint, but I picked up some hops and something else, raisin-like. I couldn't be sure what it was. The beer a nice light roasted taste. Easy on the mouth, and easy to drink. I noticed a slight warm feeling from the alcohol, but nothing overwhelming."
"Poured with a light head that didn't stick around with a little aroma. I really liked the first sip on this one. The carbonation strikes the tongue just right that the sweet malts mix wonderfully with the hop bite. The carbonation I have noticed on these Yards brews is a bit more than expected but it seems just right here. Enjoyable."
"Fresh 12oz bottle. Pours with a hazy amber body with a large, sticky off white head. Like an English mild should. Strong caramel malt aromas; biscuity with grassy hop character in the background. Good toasty malt flavors with plenty of caramel. Somewhat earthy, with a nice, palatable amount of bittering hops. Full body and lowish carbonation give it a nice feel. Overall, it drank pretty good. Probably one of the nicer takes on an ESB to come from the States. A cask version with lower ABV and a bit less hopping would be phenomenal."
"Very interesting and well done for the style."
"Coppery brown in color with a nice white head and light carbonation. Head dissipates fairly quickly. Smells of grassy hops and toasty malt with some yeast evident as well. Taste is toasty and malty with plenty of grassy floral hops and a firm bitterness at the end. Some caramel taste as well. Fairly well balanced with a medium body and pleasant mouthfeel. Not too sticky but with a nice malty finish. The only problem with this beer is that I just know it is ten times better on cask. Will have to head into Philly sometime and get it the way it is meant to be."
"This is just an all around well made beer."
"D - Average drinkability. The Carbonation and bite make it a slower drink."
"D - Everything an ESB should be... Really fantastic brew... There's nothing exotic about this, it's just a solid through and through... I could drink this all night long year round... Simple and well executed can be a wonderful thing..."
"The taste is of strong malt and alcohol with a light hop finish. Goes down very well and tastes great. This is Yards first beer and its a great amber ale."
"I was disappointed with this beer I had high hopes going in but a big letdown in the end."
"Poured from the bottle right down the center. Frothy head disappeared too quickly. It did leave a nice ring around the outside but very little to no lacing. A nice coppery amber color that is very clear with a smattering of little bubbles of carbonation. The aroma is a complex mix of fruit, highlighted by a bit of citrus and a hint of souring or bitterness. A smooth, but thin feel, with slightly sweet malts and a crisp bitter dry finish. There is very slight to no noticeable alcohol, even though this is an Extra Special. An excellent American version of a great English style. I'm glad they're located so close by. This is a tasty brew."
"D - Highly drinkable and tasty. Makes a decent session beer, but I think I'll stick with their Brawler for that."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and I could easily could have a few of these, but given a choice I think I'd pick a one or two beers from Yards over this one if I were buying a case with only one style of beer in it."
"Poured hard into an imperial pint glass, this beer leaves a modest, but creamy tan head. Aroma is grainy, tannic, with hints of grapes, figs, dark fruit. The taste: starts out with the smooth round fruit up front, accented by a very slight hint of roasted malts that cuts through it. The finish is crisp with a firm hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is pleasant, with medium carbonation that turns a bit creamy in the mouth. Drinkability is pretty good for this beer, could easily have a few, though there are plenty of other session beers I'd go to before this. Well worth trying though."
"Pours a crystal clear, I say it even tho itis generic, amber color with a 3'4: white head that afte a bit drops to a 1'4"". Aroma is malt and some spice. Taste is malt, toast, some hop bitterness, dry on the finish.Body and mouthfeel is fine. Would like to try this in the cask condition style"
"(3.1/5)"
"Pours a deep brown with a big fluffy head and good lacing. The smell is malty and slight sour. The flavor is a big slap of amber malt, deliciously bready, with bitter hop backbone. The finish is thin and bitter. Good."
"D: a safe moderate beer that strives to be middle of the road."
"This beer has a mild but pleasant nose, mostly caramel malt and floral hops, with notes of raisin and grain. It has a terrific malt flavor punctuated with some fruity notes (plum?), which is immediately smacked down by some wicked (as in wicked good) bitterness. Medium bodied and smooth, easy to drink. This is a solid, enjoyable ESB."
"Pours a hazy dirty brown color with an over active light brown head that left some nice foamy lacing on the glass. The aroma is of rust, minerals, perhaps some fig or light brown sugar. The taste is a strong metallic/rust flavor, earthy; must have some hard-ass water in Philly. Some light honeysuckel and brown sugar notes followed by a bittering hop flavor, typical of an ESB. The feel is fairly light with very fizzy carbonation. Has a very airy feel to it. The finish is on the slightly bitter side of the spectrum. The metallic flavor is probably a bit strong but resembles the true English ales. A very solid offering, worth a try."
"A little tough because of the carbonation, but a very smooth and solid beer."
"I had some Yards ESA today hand pumped at Standard Tap. It had a solid finger plus head and a clean red amber color. The first taste was good but the last was exceptional. Lots of malt beautifully complements the tangy hops. I am definitely going back for more."
"D: Easy to enjoy anytime. I like me some hops."
"D - I like this one. Nice depth. Complex but easy drinking. If I could get this where I lived, I would buy more."
"D - Quite enjoyable, spices make it a little strong for multiple servings"
"D: I like the taste and look of this beer but something just seems a little out of whack in the body. All of the appropriate flavors are there but the sweetness and bitterness seem to be fighting each other."
"Dark amber colored ale with a thin foam that is quickly gone.Sweet smelling aroma and taste of toasted malt with a mildly bitter aftertaste.All around decent beer,would recommend to anybody.I am eager to sample other beers from this brewery,i've heard good things about them!!"
"Pours a clouded amber that has strong orange tones and a bit of brown in the mix as well. Nose is a slight sugary leaf. Flavor is pretty smooth with a staying power that holds a mildly mature sweet woody tone. Very slight bitter edge on the end. Feel is smooth on liquid and pretty standard on the carbonation. This is a very drinkable brew. Nothing wild or crazy, but it is fairly even and smooth. Would probably be interesting on cask."
"Really disappointed with this one. I have had their IPA before and i remember enjoying it, but this beer was a mess. Way too carbonated and not balanced at all. The hops and carbonation drown out any malt character. I also got a metallic taste to this one that stayed for some time. Not an enjoyable beer."
"Medium body with a light, dry finish. Refreshing with a lingering hop bitterness."
"Final Thought: Cool brew! I like everything that is going on, and it gets higher grades for originality (4.5/5.0), but there is no voting option for that!?!"
"Pretty nice and drinkable beer. But I like others in the style better..."
"D: Nothing special, but solid."
"Now this is beer I could buy again. Oh wait. The brewery is splitting up. Here's hoping the next incarnation of Yards can make this beer just as delicious."
"Nice looking almost bourbon colored ale with modest slightly off-white head. All slightly obscured by condensation on my glass. Subtle smell that starts with hops, and as I inhale aroma turns to malt and perhaps slight alcohol note. Nothing over powering, all pretty subtle. Nice smooth taste dominated by the malt, again nothing really jumps out. Very smooth very drinkable beer with good mouthfeel. All in all this is a solid ale. However, nothing dominates or emphasizing any aspect of the beer. I'm guessing Yards designed this ale to be their standard gateway ale. It seems as though they were less interested in making a quality ESB, but instead were trying to turn an ESB into an American amber ale. The results are good, but not by any means spectacular."
"Other info: As with many Yards brews I've had in the past, at least one beer out of every 6'er appears to have some sort of quality related problem. I really like the beers when good, but won't be hashing out big bucks for this micro when I can trust some others (which also detracts from drinkability)"
"Overall: I would definitely pick up a six pack of this on the way home from work. This is a very nice tasting ESB and it has a great drinkable quality as well."
"Appearance is amber color, solid white head (one finger) with a little very mild lacing. Nose is fairly mild, although not bad. A little malt and that standard ESB scent. Taste is good; good amount of malt, saltiness, and then some hops in the background. Stronger than the nose suggested. Tasty. Feel is medium, good, good carbonation. Overall, a tasty, smooth, drinkable beer."
"Bottle at my personal mecca, Brickskeller, Washington. Dark copper with a thin head. Metallic caramel aroma. Thin body. Bit grainy, gristy and carameled, but overall the thinness detracts far too much. Gets a bit better as it warms with more malt bases, boosting my impression. (#2775, 4/6/2007)"
"D: Highly balanced makes this ESB easy to drink. Not too high ABV either to have a couple. Easy to understand why there is so many reviews on this one, compared to some of the others."
"D: The alcohol is creeping upward with the ale, limiting the drinkability. The strange spicy body would most likely cause me to pass on a 2nd pint."
"Pours a solid copper with a thin head and bunches of lacing. Aroma is faint, but grassy hops and vague malts it is. Taste is better, grassy, grainy hops and pale malts, a bit yeasty maybe, solid bitterness, I can imagine this being phenominal on cask. The mouth is solid, good body and carbonation, a very, very easy drinker and impressive for a style that doesn't get me all that excited."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this beer. It's firing on all cylinders and has great drinkability. It has quickly become a year round resident in my refrigerator. Buy, pour, and enjoy. Also, if by chance you can find this beer on cask, do yourself a favor and have a pint. Cheers!"
"Poured a cloudy dark burnet amber, almost brown in color. No real head, but there were some visible chains of bubbles streaming up the sides. No lace present on the glass, although there was a decent film left on top for a little while. Smell was a little light, but what was there was not too bad. Breads and grains predominated, as it warmed a slight caramel sweetness started to come out, as well as some hints of spices, maybe a little cinnamon, overall not bad. First impression of the taste was a bit slick,oily, and somewhat watery and thin. Aside from that which would be more of a mouthfeel observation, there is a decently bitter hoppiness to be found here, albeit a bit muted. Bread flavors as well come into the fold, and it did leave a slightly lingering aftertaste which was nice. Again though the feel fell a bit flat, with no real carbonation, and the slick feeling, was a bit of a let down. Overall I could see this as a sessionable brew, though a little flat for me."
"Nice pour. Thick rich head and lots of lace. Not much going on in the nose.Very faint caramel and not much else. Taste is pretty nice, with rich caramel, some toffee and some hops. It's 6.5 abv, which is a bit high for the style but you'd never know taste wise. I'd buy this every now and then for sure if I could."
"Overall a good, standard ESB. Or at least it tastes like the other ESBs, like MA's Old Macus, I've tried. Mildly fruity malts with herbal hops. A very smooth mouthfeel, if you're in a british sort of mood, this is a good go-to beer. Another fine beer from Pennslyvania."
"Drinks pretty easy, a nice english-influnced ESB. This would be easy to session on if the 6.3% abv doesn't sneak up on you!"
"A bit thin, but a nice drinkable beer."
"($5.00 / Pint)"
"This one is very flavorful and quite different from the cask version."
"We visited the Yards brewery the day before I had this, and the brewer, Josh, being a huge fan of low alcohol English session beers, named the ESA and the Jefferson Tavern Ale as his personal favorites of the fine Yards pantheon. He said that he had tried producing real English-style session ales (at 3.5% ABV or so) but there just isn't a market for them in the US. While I sometimes appreciate a hugely hopped IPA, it's really not the style I favor so I am with Josh in finding the ESA really nice, and the Jefferson even better despite its 8% ABV."
"Overall a good ESB with a nice ABV. Very drinkable. The ABV distinguishes it from other versions."
"Overall- Man, this was good. I drank it in 7 or 8 gulps! This goes into my top 10 easily!!"
"On tap at Cole's. Coppered orange with a dense, creamy off-white head. The aroma is subtle: soapy EKG hops and a slightly buttery toasted biscuit scent predominate. The buttery diacetyl flavor emerges right away, assertive, but quite enjoyable given the style. Then soapy-leafy-earthy hops come in almost immediately followed by a wonderful biscuity malt middle and slightly mineral finish. Smooth mouthfeel, moderately prickly carbonation and medium body. All around, a great beer experience that warranted a second and third round. I ordered this expecting something enjoyable but middle-of-the-road all the same, but it turned out to be a real knockout. Extremely drinkable (perhaps only when fresh?) ESB. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I could drink a number of these easily. However, they're not my favorite. I would probably reach for something else over this, mostly because of the bitter aftertaste."
"flavor is similarly complex with caramel malts washed away with a nice, Cascade-like hoppiness in the finish. medium-heavy body with a perfectly complementing medium carbonation. drinkable, complex, and a lovely mix of aromas and flavors."
"Drinkability...what can I say other than I would have this as a steady sessioner. Oh yeah..."
"This would do well in session, and also with novice beer drinkers. It has everything in it but is not overpowering. I wish more bars around here would have it on tap because I really think it would catch on with everyone."
"Medium bodied, with a chewy, creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Very difficult for me to finish due to the unpleasant bitterness, which doesn't happen too often."
"This reminds me of Samual Smith's Organic Ale. Not a fav. This is very drinkable and enjoyable. If this had less alcohol it would be a nice session beer."
"Cheers!"
"D - At 6.3% abv and with such a strong burnt taste this might not be the best session beer, but it will certianly go along well with strongly flavored foods. I can see this riding high with some barbecue or some really spicy wings."
"Drinkability: Well-balanced example of the style; a great session beer"
"Light fruity? scent. I definatley detect malts, but not too much roasting going on. The most nocticable thing is a lingering bitterness, but it's well balanced I would say. I can readily call this a smooth and sessionable brew."
"This pours a reddish coppery color with a two finger off-white head.The smell is pretty strong with a 'bisquity' aroma and some fruit,apples? The taste has a definite hop feel that mellows the malt,but leaves a nice sweetness.The m/f is light and very well balanced. This is a very good beer. I was once down on Yards,but I've changed my mind.Good job."
"Overall, the Yards ESA is to me, a good, solid beer and is very drinkable for leisurely, slightly detached enjoyment. In the end, this offering is certainly above average but nothing about it really jumps out and grabs you."
"The taste follows through and is nice and malty with the perfect amount of hops to balance it out. Not too bitter and not too sweet. The carbonation makes it feel wonderful in the mouth too. The six pack of this disappeared very quickly."
"Slight medium tan head settles over clear amber tinged reddish liquid. Excellent classic ESB nose: biscuity/sweet malt and fresh hoppiness balanced to perfection. The taste was more hoppy than malty sweet, the dryness of the hops really compliments the malt base. The complex flavors were all the more complex on this cask version. Finished long and bittersweet."
"poured a murky reddish-copper color with moderate, yet oong lasting tannish head. Smell seems to be a combination of malts, caramel and hops, with none dominating the other. Good Blend. Taste starts with toasty malt, but slowly evolves into a strong hop bitterness. Finishes very, hoppy and bitter. Nice easy drinking beer."
"Pours a dark reddish copper with a finger of loose head which sticks around as a ring all the way through the beer. Aroma is a little caramel, a little floral hops, and unforunately a little soy sauce. This is the second ESB I've tried where I smelled soy sauce, so it might be something with me, but it's definitely offputting. Luckily, the smell doesn't carry over to the taste. The taste is a caramel malt with a slight buttery flavor and a fairly strong floral hop finish leaving some lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little too carbonated and prickly on the tongue. The smell ruins this beer for me, but even without it I'd say it's only an average brew."
"Too bad the wait is so long, because the airy foam head has a nice, casky look to it, and heavy sticky foam is the rule, not the exception here. Aroma is fruity hops, with a malty undercurrent. Taste is smooth malt, with fruity hops adding character, but not dissolving your tongue. More cask-like attributes here. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Drinkability is where I had to ding this one, as I want more, but just can't wait that long."
"When i could finally get it in the glass this beer had a cloudy gold color. The head was just huge and frothy. I'm about 1/2 way through a case and they have all been this way so it isn't just an isolated bottle. Very pungent grapefruity/piney hops smell. The grapefruit is the primary taste. The bitterness gives it a dry finish that puckers your cheeks. Slightly above average beer that is ok but nothing special. From reading other reviews it seems to have a lot of variability."
"I could drink this all day, if asked to. It's crisp and refreshing, with a nice hop bite. A good ""session"" beer."
"The smell is very good, with hefty malt content and great smoothness. Some of that smoothness is lost in the taste and mouthfeel, but good flavors remain. The taste adds caramel and a light hint of nuts to the malt. Hop content is mild and pleasing."
"It pours a murky muddy color with a rather large head of foam; definitely an enticing sight. Solid hop aromas permeate the nostrils, a bit fruity, with some slight sweet maltness. Same goes for the flavors, solid hop character, a pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste, but not overly so. It doesn't knock my socks off, but the enjoyment factor is solidly there. I'm sure it's quite a treat on cask."
"Pours out a dark amber brewski with a 2 finger head.Smells sweet with a nice hop aroma.Tastes a bit dry with bitter hops thrown in,,not horrible but could be rounded out a little bit better.Mouthfeel is ok. A drinkable beer,but i expected better ,,maybe another one of their styles ill try a few more yards."
"I think more subtlety and complexity will be shown on the cask versions of this beer, which can be found all over Philly. But for some reason I've not partaked of those yet."
"Overall-a passable bitter, better as it warms, very malty as it should be, nothing of the style that leaps out and wows me but a very solid attempt at the style, another solid part of the variety pack."
"Bittering hops dominate the palate. There's a touch of dark caramel and fruit as well. Finish is crisp and the bitterness lingers. Not particularly bad, but kinda boring. A good fallback option."
"Yards ESA shines on draft, and a fresh cask or keg can can deliver a marvelous pint that draws you back again and again! This dark amber/copper ale reveals slightly-hazy orange highlights when held to the light, and a creamy dollop of short but long-lasting off-white froth atop. Bright, grassy, leafy, and floral hops greet you in the nose along with the signature Yards fruit and mineral yeastiness and wafts of hop-laced, caramel-accented malt. It's smooth across the palate with a medium body and a delicately zesty, gently restrained carbonation. Fruitiness and malt combine upfront in the flavor before it becomes a bit more complex as the leafy/grassy/floral hop flavors and a solid bitterness arrive to dry things out. It's not overly complex, but this is not a one-sided beer by any means, and that leads to a great drinkability. When it's on, it's on! And it's always worth the price of admission to see if you've found your pint for the night! Always delicious and sometimes brilliant, this is a slightly strong session-ale that's not to be missed!"
"Edit: Wow, this beer received the lowest score I've ever given. I've only reviewed craft beers up to this point...time for me to dig into some macro-swill."
"On cask at several Philly bars over the past few months (Standard Tap, McMenamins, Etc...). Dark amber and slightly muddy in appearance with an unusually fluffy head for a cask brew. The aromas are all sweet UK bready malts and some nice UK hopping is in use here as well. The taste is lovely with a sweet maltiness in the foreground and a slightly nutty hopiness in the background. The mouthfeel is cask greatness and the drinkability is great as well. One of the best non-UK sessions beers I have ever tasted!"
"Poured a lot darker than I was expecting, with just enough of a head to create a half-way decent lace around the edges of the glass. After I learned it was an ESB and not an ale or amber, I said, ""Aaah!"" The aroma is strong in yeast and slightly old, blackened bananas. The yeast follows through into the tongue of the beer, and is quickly replaced by a wood varnish flavor. The hops are quite pleasantly bitter and they hang around the back of the mouth well after I was finished. Kind of like sucking on orange peels. Unless one likes ESB, you may be turned off by the hop kick, but this would be a good beer for a tasting to introduce someone to a bitter without it being too over the top."
"Drinkability and Overall: A strong, solid beer that has a flavor that is purely American. But that flavor is nothing special. The mouthfeel is good. But other than that this beer doesn't stand out in any way. The drinkability is held down by the lack of a really good taste. My first offering from Yard's, and I must say I'm a bit dissapointed."
"I note that this is classified as a strong bitter, and that, it is. I don't find it to be in the English style, but it's worth a try."
"Super heads tops a light murky brown appearance. Floral citrus hop on the nose....very inviting. Light initial sweetness is followed by a hoppy, tasty bitter flavor...finishes dry. Mouthefeel is dominated by hops and dryness...I like both. Easy to drink....smooth enough to have another."
"Soft dry foam head that seemed to dry up more and more against the glass. Sharp malts smell, deep on flavor, of spicy molassas and low sweetness. Taste held a medium malts flavor without too much flair. Something of bitter oranges and citrus, but not too much. Touches of bitter, earthy hops arrive late. Medium to heavy body, a solid ESB, but nothing too exciting bringing me back for more."
"Pours orange amber with some haziness and a few floaties. Foamy tan head that leaves some nice lace. Nose is of apples, bubblegum, and malt, that Yards house character that sometimes gets out of control. Slight (this time) tartness dulls the sweet malt. Moderate British malt flavor through and through, a little bready, and spicy hops on the finish. There are slight hints of the phenolic funkiness that is rampant in the bottles of ESA and TJ Ale that were oh so bad. Carbonation is light and prickly, and the body is light as well. This is a very good beer that I can image being wonderful if cask conditioned (as I have heard from schoolteacher). If somehow I can be assured that the beer isnt going to be one of the woeful ones I have come across several times, I would certainly get this again."
"12 ounce bottle. 5.5% ABV on bottle."
"pours a beautiful, dark mahagony color. Two inches of creamy, beige colored foam settle into the glass. Aroma of blanched cashews and fresh-baked bread. Nutty flavor permeates throughout the th first sips. Beer strikes a really fine balance between hoppy and sweet. Mouthfeel is tremendous, very full on the tongue and threough the taste and lingers and lingers on the palate. Exceptional balance for this beer. A perfect summer/fall beer and better from the cask."
"I missed the chance to have this on cask in Philadelphia, so I brought home a bottle of it to try later. Tasting this makes me wish I had gone to the Standard Tap and dared the hangover gods. This is good. Heavily hazed brown-amber with a big airy head that fades slowly. The aroma is heavily fruity with apricots, grapefruits and plums riding over the malt. The flavor turns maltier with a strong toasty presence supported by a mild bitterness and that great fruitiness. Tasty beer."
"Interesting ale. Unique and drinkable. Yeast flavors may be excessive for some."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability: A classic. Quite satisfying as it is not overly heavy, but not thin in anyway. If there wasnt another beer I wanted to try, Id drink these all evening long and be content. However, Im usually inclined to switch things up given the chance. Excellent as a session beer though."
"this brew from yards starts out wonderfully by building expectations with a stellar appearance, but tanks back into the land of average thereafter. pours a great looking cloudy amber colour with a big creamy off-white head. nice stickiness and great overall appearance. smells of malt, hop, and a bit of fruit sweetness (plum or grape, perhaps). the taste is average at best, much like the smell. there's a bit of a hop kick in here along with a bitter malt finish that is on the dry side. again, this one's nothing special, but it's not bad either. there's nothing striking that would warrant my seeking this one out on a regular basis, but i certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered to me."
"Thanks to beerluvr for another Yards creation."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a 1/4"" off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a creamy malt scent with a dry bitter aroma that lingers. The taste is good. It has a smooth, complex malt makeup that goes down easy and finishes bitter and dry. It has tremendous mouthfeel. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine ESA. It is really smooth and flavorful."
"First sip reveals mild carbonation and an thicker than average body. The flavor is slight hit of caramel and then a rush of piney/grassy hops. Not overwhelming but definitely the strongest flavor I get. The hops leave a lingering bitter coat in my mouth and urge me to quest for the hit of sweetness at the front of this beer. The beer is very drinkable and I get no hint of the 6.3% abv. Quite a tasty beverage. Thanks beerluvr!!"
"Zum wohl!"
"Pours a darkish amber-hued haze, with a HUGE, creamy off-white head -- lots of sediment in the bottle. Smelled of sweet hay with pumpkin spice and just a hint of hops -- an oddly pleasant combination. The mouthfeel was thick -- like molassas but not quite as syrupy. It felt very good on the palate and allowed the flavor to coat. The taste was spicy -- I detected orange, clove, and some floral characteristics -- quite complex, actually, with a complimentary level of bitterness in the aftertaste. A bit too heavy to be a session brew, perhaps, but very drinkable none-the-less. I enjoyed this one."
"unfiltered and cloudy color of old pennies. creamy eggshell colored head, that sticks around somewhat. interesting aroma that seems kind of schizophrenic. weird. medium chewy body, sort of slick in the mouth. fruity malt flavors are all over the place, very english esb in character. finishes with a decent hop-leaf twang that tied this beer together. interesting to say the least, i didn't know what to make of this brew at first, but it grew on me. an old english style ale with character. try it."
"I first had this on the hand-pump at Standard Tap in Philly. The hand-pump seems to make everything taste better. I originally gave it a 5 for drinkability, but have since edited it to 4.5 after having the beer on ordinary taps. Still a great beer, but the hand-pump gave it a sweetness and drinkability that made the beer a little better overall."
"This was a damn good ESB if I have ever had one. Poured a dark cloudy mixture of brown and copper hues with an off-white head that was not overly large. Smelled wonderful with heavenly notes of dried raisins, mollassas and sweet esters. Taste was biscuity with a firm hop bite coming out towards the middle a slight sweetness and a buttery finish. The mouthfeel was full bodied and smooth. If I ever find this on cask it may be the best bitter I try. danke nomad."
"A rare item: a regularly available real ale patterned after the originators in England. If you don't understand it, well, that's a shame. If you'd like to, go to Fergie's Pub at 13th and Sansom in Philadelphia, PA where its the cheapest and best beer on draught. Well-appreciated."
"A deep cloudy amber ale with a fluffy head that vanishes a little too quickly but with nice traces of lace along the walls of the glass. The smell was decently hoppy with scents of fruit. The taste was a nice blend of fruits obscured by hops and finishing off with a dry taste. The hops were not overpowering but still gave your taste buds a nice jolt. A nice beer by any means and one that screams to be enjoyed by all."
"Deep dark amber with a nice fluffy tan head. The lace clung to the glass heavy all the way down. The smell was slightly fruity with an earthy quality. The taste was of carmel, malt and slight hops with a clean, bitter finish. The mouthfeel was bright, crisp and very smooth on the tongue. This was a very enjoyable ESB style, not too sharp and extremely drinkable. I was very impressed with this one and hope to find it on tap soon."
"Appearance: It pours murky brown, with a bullwinkle sized off white head. It has a little bit of tingle on the roof of your mouth. It starts out wanting to be hoppy, but finishes crisp. It went very well w/ the lamb stew I'd made. This is a nice ESB."
"A traditional english ale with complexity and flavor that really stands out from the crowd. One of the best versions of an ESB made in the US, I think. I can't begin to imagine how good this beer would be when served cask conditioned."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a creamy head. A heavy yeast aroma is predominant and hints at improper storage before purchase. The brew is overly hoppy with a harsh mouthfeel and minimum malt presence. A floral hop spice starts to work it way though toward the bottom of the glass. I have a feeling this is an old bottle that has been stored at a to-high temperature. The whole brew hints at a great beer, but the flaws of this bottle eclipse the goodness."
"Reddish, tawny-bronze tint hazy (the yeast was swirled). Modest beige head, a wispy residue had excellent retention thick, broken rings of lace. Very inviting nose, loads of toasty, caramel malt. Distant hops influence adds depth. Pleasant palate, lovely blend of toasty, caramel malts, moderate bitterness, floral hops at first the warmer it became, the hoppier it got (piney). High carbonation, very tight bubbles, a little too effervescent. Cleansing. Minimal aftertaste, light maltiness and soft piney hops. Perfect abv, the alcohol is just barely noticeable at the finish. Nice touch. Well balanced. Medium-light body. Very quaffable. Recommended."
"I reviewed this in the bottle and finally tried this out of the machine,very very nice.Poured a amber color with nice medium sticky head the aroma was nice and fruity with a chocolate background.The taste shines in this form very sweet and chocolaty up front with that fruitiness in the rear and the hop dryeness in the wonderful finish.A definent malt based beer just 10 times better on cask a great experience for a beer geek."
"The Yards beers are likely better served on cask, but this ESA is a fairly good taste even within the bottle, and may well be my favorite beer out of the variety case."
"I've had this from the bottle, and it's much much better on cask. Huge thick frothy head retains all the way to the bottom of the pint. Floral hop nose, smooth, creamy mouthfeel. This is quite a well balanced brew on cask...its that way in the bottle as well, but so much more flavorful this way. Fruity malty start gives way to a nice bitter hoppy finish. This one rates high on drinkability...the pint I had was gone much quicker than usual. Definitely recommended, especially on tap or on cask."
"Pours a deep copper color with a slight head. The term ESA is a bit confusing to me. I'm assuming they just don't want to use the word bitter. The aroma is malty with little hops at all. There is bitterness from the hops in the taste, but I would have like to have a little more hop flavor and aroma rather than just the bitterness."
"Appears amber ruby brown with a vibrant fluffy copper white head and I must note the marathon head retention leaves a nice trickled lace. Aroma is a full bouquet of pine cone scented hops along with tones of caramel malt underneath the hops. Taste is predominantly hops of earthy, pine cone variety with a trace of buttery caramel malt to complement the bitterness. A little off balanced just way too much hop bitterness in my book. Mouthfeel is medium bodied fluffy textured with hop resins creating a slightly oily texture in each sip. The drinkability is kicked down a notch due to the fact that the hops a tad overbearing, but overall this beer should be experienced."
"This one has little head and had a lot of chunky setiment on the bottom (for this reason i think it may have turned). Flavor wasn't horrible though. Tasted much like an English ESB and works well within that style which, really, isn't one of my favorites. Anyways, a fairly easy drinking beer. One that I WILL try again."
"This is a good brew. The head is quite creamy and full. The nose is a complex balance of malt and hops. The taste is quite unique. Definitely ""extra special"". I think this is probably my favorite ESB I have ever had. Although it is called ESA. Definitely a good example of the style. The hops are present and quite dominant but there is still a strong malt backround to balance the bitterness. This gem is bottle-conditioned and that brings in some other tastes that are not common to ESBs but adds a nice touch. The beer is definately worth seeking out."
" Very British,Old Ale style in charactor, tho hoppier, and worth seeking out if you find yourself in its limited distribution range."
"This beer poured into the glass a dark straw color that had hues of amber. The head was creamy and beige in color, fairly thick as well. There was lace present as well. The aroma was semi sweet malt (dark) caramel, citrus and floral hops, sugar coated almonds, bread and yeast. The flavors that hit my tongue were of dandelions, hops, fruit, roasted nuts and semi-sweet dark malt. It had a semi-dry finish and a hoppy after taste, not strong but present. A pretty decent beer, not the best example of the style, but absolutely drinkable."
"Taste was bready, doughy with a hearty yeast flavor tossed in. The tea characteristic found its way into the flavor as well. Also present was a touch of roasted malt and some biscuit. The beer starts bitter, then a little malt sweetness and ends bitter and dry with the herbal hops coming forth once more. I thought the beer was just a bit sharp overall and could have used a bit more roundness. I bit rough around the edges but solid as a rock, like the City in which it is brewed."
"The flavor is a tad thin, but I can't complain because there is are a few good things going on. The hops are nice and spicy that could have used a little more help from the carbonation to make this brew even more crisp. I did not find this beer to be really bitter. Maybe the malts balanced out the bitter flavors, but it is not a bad thing. As you get right down to the end of a swallow, then the bitterness comes in. It adds some needed complexity to the brew. I was also picking up a bit of alcohol in the aftertaste of this one. I don't know the abv, but I would hope it is pretty high since the alcohol comes through."
"thanks to frank4sail for the sample!"
"Acquired this fine ESB via trade. This one has all of the good attributes any decent ESB should have. Pours a rich amber color with a somewhat foamy off-white head. Thin lacing. Sharp hops aroma. Nicely austere flavor that is both crisp and gratifying. Bitterness is not too harsh but it is definitely there. More complex that a lot of ESBs and I appreciated that."
"Fresh, clean grapefruity aroma. Pours a hazy copper with a lacy, off-white head that tastes lsightly sweet with a good bitterness to it. Nice malty backbone (the style of ESB I like) forms what is at it's core a hop-dominated brew. Citrusy flavors give way to a dry biting hoppiness at the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel was quite nice. A pretty good brew. Thanks Nero."
"Pours out a murky brownish colour - some amberish accents but it was mostly brown, with a fluffy head. Nose betrays hop presence, not exceptionally flowery, though. My palate is growing enough that I'll make a guess that these are noble hops, and not North American varieties. Taste is again hoppy, with a bitter finish. Malt presence is good and evident. Tasty."
"Huge fluffy dirty brown white head on top of dark colored amber brown-transparent body. Head seems like its never going to fade away. Carbonation appears to be slightly heavy. Flavor reminds me of a weaker barleywine--hoppy and bitter but dry. Fragerant spicy aromas tickle the nose. Mouthfeel is entertaining--balanced and full."
"This dark amber beer pours with a huge loose head and a slight haziness. The head slowly fades and leaves a decent lacing behind. The aroma immediately brings bubble gum to mind, with cherries and citurs notes evident. A hint of hops may be detectable behind the overall sweet, fruity nose. The first sip is more bitter than the aroma would have led me to believe. The wonderful bitterness is lightly supported by some malt in the background. The finish is a little dry, and some metallic aftertastes are present. Also a bit of a medicinal note lingering on the palate. A bit a fruitiness shows through the flavors a subsequent drinks are taken. The beer feels thin on the tongue, but itfeels like it is trying to hold on to the back of your tongue as it gradually fades down your throat. A little distracting when combined with the odd aftertastes. A bit of a disaapointment from Yards."
"Thanks Frank!"
"On the pour a quite murky yellow-orange color, the head impressive, and the residual lace nice thick sheets to cover the glass. Dominated by the malt, citrus crisp, lightly sweet and a nice nose to treat the senses. Sweet at the start, the top skimpy and the finish perkily acidic, the hops spicy and biting as a Bitter should be, quite a quaffable brew."
"Slightly cloudy dark amber, with a finger-thick, off-white creamy head. Aroma dominated by caramel malt, moderate hops, some fruity boquet and a hint of diacetyl. Taste is quite malty sweet, with decent hop flavor throughout and a quite strong bitter finish. Crystal malt also gives off some butterscotch, caramel flavors. Medium bodied with a dry finish. A decent beer, though nothing terribly impressive. Definitely best at cellar temperature -- keep it away from your fridge lest you wind up with a fairly bland beer."
"This is a nice ESB, I would drink it again given the chance, I think it may be a bit underrated on the site."
"This is definitely a very special ale."
"Clean sweet nose.  Dark unfiltered red color with chunks of yeast suspended.  Pours with a thick rich white head.  Off white sheen and lace on the pint glass.  Smooth mouth.  Bitter hop original taste followed by a slightly fruity (grapefruit)/flowery finish.  Quite balenced..  If lots of sediment turnds you off decant or pour the beer gently!"
"Pours a deep bright orange color with a head sticky, frothy, creamy head. On the nose is a slight fruity. On the palate, slightly sweet, slightly acidic, nicely hopped, slightly malted, fruitiness, hints of caramel, slighty biscuity, and nice bitterness. This stuff is great. I would have to guesstimate that this (ESA) is their biggest seller."
"A special ale, yes.  An extra special ale, no.  This is a very drinkable ale & certainly nothing to complain about, however it's not top-shelf!  Don't pass on one if it's offered, but don't go too far out of your way to buy it."
