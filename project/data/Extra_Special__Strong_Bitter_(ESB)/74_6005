3.5,-6.4,,,,,,"Pours a deep amber/copper color with a good sized off white head that persists for quite a while. Aromas of rich caramel malt with a bit of a mineral/sulfur edge, light earthy hop aroma. The flavor is rich caramelized malt sugars with lots of toffee. Light fruit, earthy hop, light mineral flavor. Medium body moderate carbonation. Decent brew.","johnnnniee","Dec 12, 2014"

Aroma was primarily malts, a small bit of smokey sweetness. Also able to pick up a bit of sour, something like a lime. Flavor was a slightly bitter tangey malt. Nicely developed to want one to keep drinking. Felt good in the mouth, well coated and nicely carbonated.

3.55,-5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Initially confused by the name Halloween Ale and subsequently confused by its listing as an ESB... Pours a rusty amber color with minimal head and lacing. Scent is a light touch of buttery caramel, earthy and herbally hop notes, light musty and damp earth, a bit of watery fruit and a faint kiss of peppery spice. Taste follows scent, faintly bitter with a definite presence of english hops its star attraction, the apple fruitiness throws the taste off a touch.

The nose is rich with crystal malt, and there is a slight grain richness to it, also. The beer is light and crisp in mouth, and the flavors are a roasted caramel sweetness and bitter bite of hops at the end. The light body and increased carbonation makes the end flavors sharp and clean, leaving an aftertaste of rich nut and caramel. The finish is neat and quick, with a slight tang left bouncing around the palate. Decent brew.","GarthDanielson","Oct 06, 2011"

The taste has nuts, bread and caramel in it with a slight alcohol finish (not unpleasant or cidery at all).

I have no idea where the ""special spices"" (phrase used in the description on the beer menu) came into play. This drank like a straight-up bitter. Nothing fancy, without any subtle unique twist. Pours with an excellent thick creamy head, leaving picture-perfect sheets of lacing. The color is a blandish coppery hue - which I suppose is dead-on with a real English bitter from my experience. Round fruitiness and a touch of hoppy bitterness in the aroma. Delicious fruity, moderately malty flavor. In the immediate background, a wonderfully balanced bitterness against the other flavors. Drinks a little thicker than a real low gravity session ale, but to my American palette, it was superb. If it's 6%, I'd be hard-pressed to notice. I hope this is around Philly more often - really enjoyed it.","Bouleboubier","Nov 03, 2010"

I would drink a few of these in a night, but probably only if it was all that's available in my fridge. Otherwise, I think I would mix it up with some of Gritty's other beers if I were at one of their pubs (Halloween, stout, bitter, Halloween, etc.). I do think it would be quite good on cask. All in all, worth trying if you are not a drinker who immediately writes off all Ringwood beers.","ToasterChef","Sep 20, 2010"

The head is thin but the overall appearance is of great clarity. Sweet malts and fresher hops balance out the aroma but they balance each other quite well. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy and full of substance. The taste sports a bit of caramel along with bitterness, roasted malts, and hops.

It has a nice but subtle malt-brown sugar aroma with spicey hints. Although this is not supposed to be anything to do with pumpkin, I still get a bitter pumpkin spice taste mixed with a little citrus hop and malt. This is very crisply carbonated and brings a black pepper taste. There is a dry breadiness at the finish.

The aroma is lightly sweet, yet light and crisp. There seems to be some subtle spicing going on here. Most notably I get some astringency towards the end and in the finish. Perhaps I get some notes of nutmeg. This beer is quite light on the palate. I am not quite sure what to think about this beer. It is quite light and does not have as much flavor as I was expecting. I think that the spices have died down quite a bit, and all that is left is a bit of spicy astringency in the finish.","Gueuzedude","Dec 10, 2004"

4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep reddish-brown color with two fingers of head. There is a good deal of lacing. The smell is fairly sweet and malty. Some caramel flavors, a slight nuttiness, and a touch of sweet cherry. A little bit of hops to boot. The taste is malty up front. Some caramel flavors and biscuit malt. Sweet and toasty. Lots of hop bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is great. A nice seasonal brew.","SheepNutz","Nov 11, 2004"

It is pretty carbonated, but the hoppy flavor I thought I would get, is not really all that heavy. I can taste the spice sitting at the back of my tongue as I let it sit longer and longer. Mouthfeel is a light bodied ale that tends to drop off...very little flavor at the end or aftertaste. Overall, I'd say give it a try for somethin' new and since it is that time of year, ya gotta try the fun fall seasonals, but overall, I was kinda hopin for more.

4,7,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured a clear amber-red color with a medium sized head that had medium retention. Aroma was pretty hoppy with sweet fruity smells, almost like raspberry or cherry. The taste is what makes this beer (and, I suppose, EVERY other beer out there). The flavor is surprisingly complex - very fruity and light off the line, then featuring a dark chocolate malt sensation, and finishing very dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Despite the fact that ESBs are probably my least sampled style, I have tried them, and am usually not too impressed. However (and as far as I am concerned), this was very unique and offered a relatively high hop characteristic as well as a rich maltiness, making it rather appealing and special. I was definetely satisfied and would have to recommend this to absolutely anyone.","nixhecks","Sep 17, 2004"
4.18,11.8,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a deep, rich copper/mahogany color. It was fairly clear. There wasn't too much head, but there was still some lacing. Some sweetness, including fruit and caramel to the nose. Hops are fairly subdued, but are balancing the sweetness well. Slightly dry finish. This went down far too easy. Can't seem to find any real difference with the draught version.","Boto","Sep 02, 2004"
4.17,11.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Copper colored with a beige foamy head that rises only to a quarter inch, but haaaangs in there atop the glass leaving a fine coating of bubbles. Aroma is very inviting, and smells of light roasted malts, some caramel and toffee, perhaps a bit of cinammon. Flavor is initially malty, not much hops, followed directly by orange peel and an alcohol tingle in the finish. A bit of pine, and some spice. Excellent smooth and round mouthfeel, with a bit of carbonation dancing on the tongue. Damn good beer, but could use just a little more depth.","far333","Aug 31, 2004"

4.05,8.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured into a pint mug, a dense head was quickly formed on top of the swirling orange-y colored contents of this bottle. The head was not terribly long-lived, but did leave it's mark in the presence of extensive lace all the way up the glass sides.

Sweet malt is the major player in the nose, crisp, fresh and pleasing to the senses, I also detect a bit of vanilla, and a bit of Black Walnut, interesting to say the least, start is pleasingly sweet, decent malt profile with a touch of tartness, top is full in its feel to the palate,. Finish is amaroidal, hops definitive in their spiciness, dry, nay I say desert dry and the hops stick on your Buds to the very end, a nice drinking beer and a pleasure to sample, thank you bennybrew and Gritty McDuffs," your both a Hoot!","Gusler","Dec 20, 2003"

To my tastes, this beer got better as it warmed as it helped smooth some of the upfront bite. Maybe that's why this is a Halloween brew - seems scary at first, but not so bad afterall and quite drinkable.

From the dark, ruby-mahogany body to the fine, silky head, it's just plain beautiful. The nutty-molases taste characteristic of most of Gritty's beers is there as expected, this time with it's bitter yet welcomed guest, Señor Aftertaste.

Earthy hops, a little sugary malt, and a touch of fruit (? cherry) in the aroma. The flavor is malty and grainy with a toasted malt finish at the first half glass with the mellow bitterness coming out much later as the glass empties. The texture is medium/light and the ESB flavors are there but the hops are a bit muted in this bottle. It definitely grew on me over the whole bottle.

3.73,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Intrigued by the name, I had to purchase this beer. It poured a ruby brown color with a faint hoppy smell. The taste consists of a pale dry bitterness spiked with portions of spiced pumpkin. Fortunately, Gritty's does not go overboard on the pumpkin flavor, as it stays low key throughout the session. Hoppiness is prevalent and I would say that this brew is fairly comparable to an octoberfest. Overall, this was a pleasurable experience.","Hhawk06","Mar 17, 2003"

4.3,15,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear mahogany body topped by a frothy ivory head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace. The aroma is of a lightly roasty and caramel tinged malt with some herbal and mildly spicy character that does not appear to be from hops (but might be). The body is medium with a fine and moderate carbonation that's crisp in the mouth. The flavor is surprisingly complex with a sweet apple-like fruitiness (that later combines with the spiciness to really tie this beer together and make it interesting), a rich honeyish, lightly buttery and softly caramel-tinged maltiness, what appears to be nutmeg, and a spicy bitterness that allows the flavors to come through before appearing more solidly in the long lasting finish. Very nicely done. Exceptionally well balanced. Really full of flavor and character for a beer with such a light body and (I'm guessing) median alcohol content. Definitely worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Nov 13, 2002"

Murky amber to light brown color, with a full thick bubbly beige head. Head laced down the glass nicely. Aromas full of spices and slightly fruity. Definite nutmeg and cinnamon noticable. Tastes were sublte but very present. Murky earthy combination of nutmeg, spiced apples, and noticable hop presence. A rich, full bodied ESB, with an extra special blend of autumnal spices.
