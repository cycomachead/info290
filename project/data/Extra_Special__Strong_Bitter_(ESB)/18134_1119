While the bitterness is in line with standard ESB, it lacks the malty backbone that makes me love Fuller's and other standout beers of this variety. It is definitely a sessionable beer--nothing offensive here, but a chalky aftertaste persists and can only be alleviated by drinking more. I suppose that's the idea. Light to moderate mouthfeel, with minimal carbonation. Not bad, not excellent, but I wouldn't be turning my nose up at this in a pinch.","takusan1000","Mar 14, 2015"

And to think the brewery (then) was a few blocks from my grandmother's house in Ballard area was so cool....especially compared to the other local choices in town (Rainier, Oly, Lucky, Henry's, Killian's) at the time.  This has been my standard baseline taste profile by which other IPA/DIPA/ESB's are judged in my experience.   Really not too bitter for regular IPA drinkers (maybe for lager-hounds), but I believe it is perfectly balanced... really close in profile to Sierra Nevada and Schubros 680... oh...and Go Cougs!","DoctorEvil","Jan 20, 2015"

It's a more modest ESB, but it still defines the genre in its principle tastes, yet I've never had a beer quite like it.

I really like the EBS By Redhook. Nice beer to sip and relax, I buy them in pints and will go through the pint in about 35 to 40 mins. It has a warm bitter taste with just the right amount of boldness. A very smooth beer but not creamy. I highly recommend this beer.

The nose emanated a definite malty sweetness with an underlying pine-like hoppiness and it occurred to me that this could be fun. Mouthfeel was medium and the malt and the hops seemed to be having a wrestling match on my tongue to see which would emerge dominant. I am going to declare it a pleasant draw. I could not discern between one or the other, especially on the finish. I would totally enjoy this if they put it in a CAN. I liked it from the bottle, but I would be hard-pressed to choose it for away from home in this format.","woodychandler","May 27, 2013"

The aroma is subdued, but toasty grains and a faint tea-like hop presence emerge. The beer tastes of toasted grains, biscuits, and caramel malt sweetness up front. Some floral and citrusy hops bring in balance on the finish. The mouthfeel is medium to light.

Pours a nice copper with a nice head that quickly recedes to a finger. Smells of malt with a bit of spice and toffee. Crisp and refreshing feel to it. A tasty malt character with hops and caramel in the background. This isn't an exciting beer but for it's style, it's a good beer. A good session beer.","JesseMurdock","Apr 14, 2013"

Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising up from the bottom of the glass, indicating abundant carbonation in this beer. I pick up sweet malts and some citrusy hops in the aroma. The flavor is very malty with some hop bitterness in the back end. It's quite bready and the citrus from the aroma comes through in the taste. The body is medium to full with abundant carbonation. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer that hits the right notes. What it lacks is the wow factor, but it indeed worth a try if you want a malty beer.","acevenom","May 28, 2012"

Aroma and flavor has some medium levels of floral and citric hopping on top of a biscuit malt with some mineral aspects, the diacetyl levels are stronger in the flavor than they seem in the aroma. Still, the butter doesn't get nearly as overwhelming as I've experienced in other beers and in this case is actually appropriate to the style. I just wish that the malt bill was more interesting than the ambiguous 'bread feel' I am presented with. Medium-light body but not quite as well carbonated as I would have liked, feels thin on the tongue.","WastingFreetime","Mar 16, 2012"

I remember back when I first got into craft, and I thought this was a good beer, nowadays, this thin bodied, hi carbed sweet beer is mediocre for me.

Some fruitiness and sweetness on the swallow from the yeast. Goes down easy alongside a medium-rare ribeye and plate of french fries. Sure, Redhook may only be pseudo-craft, but now that it has shown up in Oklahoma I'm thankful for an easy-drinking, flavorful ale that shows up at even the most Lite Lager laden bars, and at $3 a pint the price is about right.","bump8628","Nov 06, 2011"

The flavor is round and muddled, on a watery body, with characters of caramel and chocolate coming forward, and a very subtle hops undertone remaining slightly underbalanced. The aftertaste is a nutty caramel/chocolate blend, with continues to remain smooth, with a lingering, slightly sour and citrus character. The beer's finish is bitter, and a little tart.

The nose comprises biscuits, orange peel, flowers, buttery caramel, and grass. The taste holds notes of orange flesh, light grass, light buttery biscuits, and honey. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta chunky feel (if that makes any sense).

It tastes similar but has too much hop and too much carbonation, which makes it not a smooth as the ESB I had in the UK.

Continuing in the trend of moulded glass, the bottle shows wheat in relief, along with what I have to assume are mountains from their logo. The beer is the colour of clear honey, with a light beige head that stretches tall after even the lightest agitation. The beer smells strongly of hops, and little else. Sipping it, this beer personifies the trend towards a strong hops flavour, with a background of grains. It's very dry in the mouth, and the bitter qualities seem to leave the palate more bereft of moisture after drinking than it had before.

Very nice upfront malt profile, with just a bit of hops in the background. Slight caramel flavor also noticed. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side, but it helped this beer to be very drinkable.

Poured a slightly hazy, light copper with a loose, fizzy, one inch off-white head that quickly dispersed into a fairly consistent skim before settling into a swirl and a thin band around the shoulders. Some spots of lacing, but no legs. Nose reveals caramel malt up front with a suggestion of aromatic hops in the background, with the addition of some light, fruity esters dispersed in the mix. Taste consistent with nose - much maltier than I anticipated for the style. Starts out sweet upfront with some bitterness coming out towards the finish. Fruity quality reveals itself as the brew begins to warm, but is overshadowed by the malt. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation that does a nice job of adding some crispness and breaking up the maltiness in the flavor profile. I was anticipating a less malty, more subdued brew with a little more hops presence; however, this was a fairly decent brew. Maybe not spot on for the style in my opinion, but not bad. Carbonation and malty backbone make it a little difficult to session though.","Jwale73","Apr 01, 2010"

Little smell that dissipates as quickly as the head. Rich maltiness accompanied immediately by the bite from the hops. The thing I love about this beer is the great balance between malt and hops.

Served at the right temperature, however, it is rather sessionable, and a perfect beer in the Pacific Northwest.","BDJake","Oct 16, 2009"

The smell is good, not great, but does give a pleasant hint of the hops. The taste is wonderful! It goes down smooth, has an excellent hoppy flavor without being overly bitter.

Caramel malt, some light saltiness, and then very mild hop character at the back. Feel is medium bodied, with solid carbonation.

About the only thing that I can figure is that there is a lot of flavoring hops here to give the impression of an ESB while the bittering hops are lessened to accentuate the alcohol and malt. Other than this, about the only time I have drunk this beer is at a renaissance festival. Judging from my impression now...it is better than most of the rot-gut beers they have there, but this isn't one that I will be drinking outside of the $20-30 a ticket confines.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 15, 2006"

Nice light amber color and large white head and some lacing in the glass. Smells slight caramel malt with a metallic twist in with a hop citrus splash. The taste is not too metallic but there is more in here than I care for I am guessing to help with the dryness. Still it is a good solid ESB all way round.

Flavor shows a moderate toasty bread quality on the start, moving to a light caramel, moderate citrusy orange hop, finishing again with the toastyness and a very mild bitter. Also on the finish, the hopping gives this one a slight metallic tinge that I'm not enjoying all that much. The feel is on the light end of moderate, with a light carbonaiton. I'd like to see a touch more body and a touch more carbonation. It's not as lively as I would like it to be. Overall, this one isn't bad, but its not doing anything to make a major impression for me.

A little bit of sweet malt without much hops. Taste was pretty good. Sweet and slightly malty, with floral maybe fruity hops. Its hard to get more specific than that, I'm not really sure what kind of friut the hops suggest maybe a green apples- very vaguely. Though the sweet aspect definately tasted like honey. The finish, and only the finish is bitter. That bitterness does linger, but its not sharp and its balanced by the sweetness which lingers as well. Mouthfeel is ok. Not too heavy, not too light. Drinkability is good. It goes down easy and the first sip is as good as the last (better actually, I thought the head tasted a little wierd). The reason why I rated it only a little above average in this area is beause its kind of high on alcohol, and I think the otherwise easy drinking nature of this beer could ambush you. By all means if you have a driver and don't have to get up in the morning, then drink up. But otherwise I reccomend switching to something else after one to avoid adverse consequences. But alcohol content aside this was definately a good beer. Sort of like an ale version of Killian's. Oh, since this is the first beer labeled ""ESB"" that I've ever had, and its an American craft type brew, I have no idea how well this fits the style. I can tell you its a decent beer, but I have no clue if fans of ESB will like it.

There also seems to be some sort of chemical aftertaste... it only lasts for a second, but it finds its way into every sip... hmmm. The mouthfeel is definitly thin and light-bodied.

I'm surprised to discover it as satisying as I am right now. Super-clear with decent head and lace, a citrus-y, buttery, thirst-quenching brew; certainly one of Redhook's better beers (too bad that the Rye is no longer available - now that's one beer that didn't often fall by the wayside!). Lots of lemon flavors, bolstered by diacetyl (butter), quite sweet from malts and some tartness at finish which becomes obliterated by lingering caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel smooth and persuasive, perhaps the high point of the brew. Drinkability good too; now that I think about it, I remember this is my go-to beer at Mustang Harry's whenever I'm in the neighborhood of Madison Square Garden for a game or a concert (although I really should try to squeeze in a visit to the Gingerman if I'm in that area).

3.48,2.1,4,3.5,3,4,4,"This beer is clear amber with orange tinting.  A nice head tops the brew and dwindles to a slight film that stays around for awhile.  The aroma is English malt with some slight flowery hop tones spattered about. The body of this beer is at least medium and has a nice carbonated mouthfeel.  This would be a good session beer, even if I don't think it would be the tastiest one around.  There's a nice malt backbone to the badboy.  And the hops aren't overdone.  They are kept in check nicely.  They add a nice herbalness to the beer.  Not a bad beer here, but I won't seek it out again anytime soon.","Bighuge","Aug 07, 2002"
4.08,19.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Rich amber brown color, foamy fluffy thick tan head. Hop bubbles bust through, makes an inviting pour. Nice rich cascade smell. Taste was perfectly balanced and smooth, very bitter and nice malty background. Very drinkable, more right with this beer than wrong. A very pleasant surprise for me.","StevieW","Aug 06, 2002"
3.84,12.6,3,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer was much better than I expected.  Pours with a light color with an attractive white head.  Smell is fruity, slight citrus, and a bit of floral hoppiness.  Well balanced with a nice hop finish.  I really enjoyed the beer.","Suds","Aug 03, 2002"
3.47,1.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"not bitter at all on draught. after a horrible experience with flying fish esb, i was a bit scared, but this one did just fine. smooth and crispy. nice and clean","ElGuapo","Jul 22, 2002"
4.22,23.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A really nice English-style ale. Many American brewers take it too far. This beer is right where it should be; offering some really nice characteristics but maintaining a high level of drinkability. The beers pours an orange-tinted amber with a nice, but somewhat short lived, head. The aroma has an extremely nice, soft fruity character. A creamy mouthfeel and well rounded lightly caramel malt flavor is backed by an expansive but restrained bitterness. Again, this is very English in character. The finish is lightly dry; and will probably leave you with a nice hop burp! A very nice, restrained English-style ale.","NeroFiddled","Jul 21, 2002"
3.48,2.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This was pretty good I guess...I don't know. I was drunk at this point, but I will see what I can remember. Copper color, short white head. Not any bitter flavor at all. Slight breadiness, went down very easy.","IrishRedRock","Jul 21, 2002"
4.17,22.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Medium copper with thick off white head. Strong floral hop aroma with trace of roasted malt.  Very strong and flavorful with moderate carbonation.  Chewey mouthfeel with slight apple like character.  A good ESB","psugrad98","Jul 01, 2002"
3.88,13.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The clear, amber hued brew is topped by a moderate white head that leaves a respectable lace.  Diacetyl butterscotch and light caramel malt dominate the aroma, but a lightly floral Kent Goldings hop nose is there as well.  Lots of biscuit and toasted malt flavors w/ mellow caramel malt sweetness.  Hop bitterness is a bit mild for an ESB, and falls a bit short for adequate balance, and this brew is thus rendered sweet and malty.  Butterscotch is present in flavor as well, but isn't as strong as the aroma would indicate. The body is quite dextrinous and enjoyable.  The finish is a bittersweet mix of crystal malt sweetness and mellow hop bitterness.  While not an outstanding ESB, Redhook ESB straddles the boundary between an American Amber and an ESB.  The diacetyl is quite high, and if you find it objectionable you might not like this brew.  I thought it complemented the caramel malt notes.","marc77","Jun 08, 2002"
3.2,-6.2,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Not a bad beer. Easily drinkable and if you pay enough attention, you start to notice the esters you expect in a hefe. Still too american to be a good hefe.","aracauna","May 16, 2002"
3.88,13.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Peach colored, not a really full head but lace does exist. Very hoppy with a high IBU finish. More hoppy and less rich for an ESB.. but I love hops..  Very drinkable, and very available through out the Country.  A good ""staple"" type of beer.","frank4sail","Apr 16, 2002"
4.1,20.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I think this one gets a bad rap from the A-B connection.  When consumed at a decent ale serving temperature, it is a very well-balanced, rich tasting brew.  While it may be lacking in complexity or any particular signature, it is very drinkable, highly available, and sports a 'bottled on' date so you can be sure of the product's freshness.","jermar","Apr 09, 2002"
3.68,7.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Decently balanced ESB, leaning slightly hop. Mildly astringent nose and a bit grainy, but otherwise a fine brew. If in the mood for an ESB I would seek others but Redhook would do in a pinch.","inebrius","Apr 06, 2002"
3.45,1.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a solid, widely available ESB.  Its lack of complexity makes it a fine beer to have many of on a warm summer afternoon.","pbrian","Apr 01, 2002"
3.58,5,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Very clean and easy, finishes with a lemon-apple taste, a bit tart. An easy approachable beer, no real faults at all. Redhooks flagship beer, one that gets panned a bit, I think unfairly.","bmills1608","Mar 11, 2002"
3.68,7.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Nice hop smell, relatively sweet taste with a balanced malt approach...finishes without extraneous tastes but with good body...color is a light ruby amber that gives another reason to pour the bottles into a pint glass...always good to taste an ESB...","ADR","Feb 27, 2002"
3.5,2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a nice ESB. Not as good as Fuller's ESB, but very drinkable nonetheless. Pours to a nice amber color. Definite malt presence, with hop bitterness that takes over in the end. It is very widely available, with its AB distribution network, which is a good thing IMO. I pick this up from time to time.","proc","Feb 19, 2002"
4.34,27.3,3,4,5,4,4,"Rich and creamy.  Have not tasted a barely wine, but when I imagine one, I imagine it must taste very similar to Redhook ESB.  Malty, very low profile bitterneness.  The appearance isn't top notch, but the taste is.  Fruity notes on the palate and the nose.  Delicious brew!","Jordan","Oct 26, 2001"
3.06,-10.3,4,3,3,3,3,"A light weight ESB. Maybe a notch above an ordianry bitter.","John","Oct 18, 2001"

2.87,-15.8,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Notes: The diacetyl in this beer is more than what you might expect, and can sometimes become too powerful for the style. The aftertaste is also a bit harsh on the palate.","Todd","Aug 25, 2001"
4,17.3,4,4,4,4,4,"A very pleasant brew.  No particular notes at the front, but it has a broad, mildly malty middle and a restrained hop finish.  Good selection for a session beer.","Brent","Jul 30, 2001"
