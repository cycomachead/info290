It's so odd how this one didn't really stand out to me much on my first bottle, but by the third bottle it might just be my second-favorite beer from the variety pack.  I'm hoping that trend continues, as I still have one more left in the fridge!","Pantalones","Jan 02, 2015"

I get some pineapple and orange when I think of what sticks out. Actually smells fairly nice. Taste is pretty mellow and turned down. Definitely a session beer as I bought it for that. Not very hoppy at all. I definitely get more from the malt bill here. Taste is hard for me to pin down but malt forward and not very hoppy. It's very drinkable. Wish I could get more out of this but it's not a big beer like I'm used to. Mouthfeel is pretty thin but it seems well for the style. Overall a better beer than I was expecting. Basically a good session beer.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 05, 2013"

Beer has traveled 15 hours and 3 finger head with a shit ton of lacing that lasts the whole day through. I mean the whole glass through. Nice copper body with perfect clarity. Sterling and Liberty hops with nice roasted malty warmth fill the nostril-domis. I predict this motherfucker is gonna taste yummier than chuck. It does, the hops and malts are balanced pretty near perfectly. Enough dry hopping that brings the horse-hoofed malt taste away and finishes with a super nice bright and dry Christmas green hop gremlin. Mouthfeel is light and very nicely carbonated, again balancing the malt hop bitterness. A great present from a special fwend!","baos","Nov 11, 2012"

Aromatic with the nose deep in the glass, somewhat toasted barley note with an herbal hop character. The flavor is pretty mild, lead by a toasted barley and general earthiness.

I highly recommend this beer.","bastardface","Jan 24, 2011"
3.87,6.3,3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"I had some of these during Christmas and was blown away. Nice hop flavor and use of light spices. I then saved a bottle for now, (About 2 1/2 Months Later). Im not sure if it went bad, despite the bottle's date being fresh. I really did like it which is why my review is above average. I felt like it was a lighter bodied, more hoppy Fat Tire. I'll be sure to buy it again next year, and also compare it to this batch. Like I said the last ones I had weren't watery at all. For those who say: ""Hoppy Winter Beer?"" Try Sierra Nevada Celebration.","NickRivers","Jan 24, 2011"

3.04,-16.5,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Appearance is pretty awful for a winter beer. It's almost transparent, not much going on in the look. It is a dark orange color, nice head though, the head is the only redeeming quality. The head is fading quickly however, looks like it might be leaving good lacing. The smell is hoppy, hoppier than I would expect a winter beer to be. In the back end of the smell you get a tiny tiny bit of malt sweetness, not a bad smell though, pretty good actually. Wow, the taste is interesting, it tastes a little watery, with the hops trying to cover it up, I know that doesn't make much sense but bare with me. Like, the body is really thin and watery, and the taste is a little watery too, but at the same time there is a very present hop bite. Not much malt at all, you get a tiny tiny bit, but not nearly as much as I would expect in a winter beer. You do however get some of that winter warmer warmth from this beer, which is nice, you also get a taste of spices. Drinkability is average, nothing special there. Overall an average beer.","MaltsOfGlory","0"
3.08,-15.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter glass. Poured a clear dark amber color with rocky white head. Picked up aroma of floral citrus and and toasted white bread. Starts out with a dominant toasted malt bread bisquit and maybe wild flower caramel flavor. Has a medium bodied mouthfeel and will continue throughout, with that trademark toasted bread malt backbone. Nice dry hopped aroma of orange, but flat finish.","CuriousMonk","Jan 21, 2011"

3.14,-13.7,4.5,3,3,3.5,3,"D: A mediocre pale ale from New Belgium, this beer exchanges some of the more assertive hop flavors present in their other seasonals for a double-dose of fermentation--from mixed fruit to detectable alcohol. The final product isn't really remarkable, coming across as a fruity version of Boston Lager, but it might make a good cooking ingredient.","beagle75","Jan 14, 2011"

Taste is dominated by malts and some crisp hop aftertastes. I would agree with some other reviewers that the hop profile is more ""grassy", than your usual citrusy or piney, and some alcohol is meddling in the background. The beer is a different sort of balance than usual, it could be throwing me off that this is an ESB rather than a winter warmer or IPA. Mouthfeel is full but not too rich.

The flavor is more defined, with the bready malts again being the primary character with a seemingly light (but still noticeable) addition of hops coming in on the finish. Maybe it's my imagination because this is marketed as a winter warmer, but the character of the hops makes this beer drink as if this was a (mildly) spiced beer.

Not much spiciness in the taste, as compared to the smell, nice malt/hop balance going on and some alcohol in the aftertaste. Very light, watery mouthfeel with minimal carbonation.

It was a medium gold color. The taste starts out with a good ale flavor, and then a few extra spices thrown in, followed by a medium piny taste. The hops, although, obviously present in a good portion, did not produce much bitterness. This is a very drinkable beer. Think Fat Tire with less malt, and mor hops.","TCMike","Dec 06, 2010"

Transparent, completely see-through liquid of yellow gold to flat amber hue, close to complete absence of bubbles within. Bakery-like nose of honey, brown sugar, pastry flakes, nutmeg and cinnamon, orange extract, even something like cola, some yeast but no funk, the yellow apple, pear, peach, white grape fruit fit into the whole unassumingly, suggestion of bitter grasses before finally dissolving. Medium-bodied, most of the weight front-loaded, there's sweet granola, cereal, bread grains plus the honey and molasses, cinnamon and nutmeg. The orange citrus slightly candied without being a big factor. The carbonation too fine, foams to no specific purpose. Solid core of peach, pear, apple fruit, maybe seems fruity because there's nothing especially ""bitter"" about this beer.

The hops come through in unpleasant ways as far as I'm concerned as there's an almost metallic bitterness. Needs a lot more malt to balance things out. The fruitiness from the aroma is still there but it tastes like watered down berries. Light body, pretty unremarkable mouthfeel overall.

Before I even had a chance to try it, I was hearing it was similar to Fat Tire, and I almost fell into the trap of judging it before I tried it for myself. Come to find out, it is somewhat like Fat Tire, but unlike the flagship brew, this winter release has ample hops to balance out the excessive biscuit like malt flavor I don't care for in Fat Tire. This is overall a very good winter beer, perfectly balanced, and has enough ABV to be warming, but two or three of these for most beer lovers shouldn't be too much either.

Taste is quite sweet, a bit of caramel and toasty malts, and the hopping seems to be a bit light with casual flavors of citrus and light pine. Fairly well balanced but could have used a bit more hop bitterness. Smooth and creamy, light carbonation. A nice winter ale but doesn't taste much like an ESB.

The head lingers just on the surface as the beer becomes less and leaves a nice lacing on the inside of the glass. The aroma is sweet, reminiscent of homemade pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving Day. There is also a noticable smell of pears and earthiness that I just can't ignore. No real hop presence in the smell, but the spices noted, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves, are pleasant. The taste is good with a sweetness similar to spiced rum. The hops create a bitterness that balances, but there is not a noticable hop flavor. The 6.6% ABV bites just after the swallow. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but thicker than you would think for such a clear beer. It floats around the cheeks and dances over the tongue, warming the throat as it is swallowed.

The label says that it contains ""a bright, warming blast of Sterling and Liberty hops along with tawny-roasted malts""; I'm not sure if it's the wintery packaging, but I taste some spices in here.

Flavor is even and smooth, but I get something odd on there. I just cant place it (inexperience), but its almost like a port like character that peeks out at you. At the start you get an almost thin layer of pine which fades to what I think is an alcohol tone after some time.

As the beer gets warmer and is exposed to more air, the more it develops or becomes more complex. 3rd taste. It's starting to settle down. Not as much of a bite. This year's version is better than last year. Much better. This time of year in FC, this beer is a great choice.","johnyeast","0"

The clarity on this is fantastic and there are large bubbles forming at the bottom of my glass and cascading up to the top. The aroma is very earthy, with a strong toasted German malt character along with some biscuit-like qualities that I associate with other beers from this brewery. The hop only comes through to me in the earthy character. The flavor accentuates the toasted and biscuity malt character. There is a mild earthy hop in there that comes through on the finish. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and a little herbal character as well from the hop. I find as a I drink this, the malt seems to diminish and the hop seems a bit more upfront. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation of fine bubbles. Overall, this one is not bad. The malt character is and never will be my favorite, but I think it is what the brewer wants, so I can take that as it is.

I appreciate what's going on in this brew, but the flavors don't blend for me personally in a wowing way. I'd like a bit more balance in an ESB.

In hind sight I don't know what I was thinking, but when I saw a winter label with the name 2 below, i expected a spiced ale. Clearly I forgot that Peter runs things over there and there is no such thing as style or expectations. Even before I get the beer to my nose I can smell the pungent piney aroma of hops. I was surprised by the taste though. I expected it to be all hops, but it was actually more balanced than I would have expected. The taste of hops were there, but it was more the floral taste and aroma than the regular bite of the bitterness of hops. There is a sweet matliness that attempts to balance the hops and only falls a little short. Personally, I think that this is labeled incorrectly as a ESB and I think Peter would agree, although he would disagree with the labeling in general and I would disagree with only the specific label applied. If you enjoy the flavor of hops, you're gonna want to drink this beer. I just might do the same again.","drseamus","Dec 19, 2006"
3.53,-3,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"A very light colored ale, almost clear. Overall the nose is faint, but the beer is cold, as recommended by the brewer (37°F), and features hops and an alcohol kick. Very smooth and mellow; although I taste the hops, there is very little bitterness. Unique malt profile, British styled, but still very different from, and much less sweet than, the typical Fuller's ESB or Young's SLA type I've had before. Soft seltzer water mouthfeel. Sun-dried mango without the sugar, avocado, and spinach are notable notes, as is fresh baked beer bread and biscuits. It's a hearty, yet civilized, ale. I like it much better at 50°F, as the flavors are (obviously) more pronounced. Cheers!","rayjay","Dec 18, 2006"

The aroma is sweet fruit, with the slight aroma of alcohol. The taste is very much the same. A little fruity citrus flavor, but with a more pornounced alcohol presence. This reminds me of a weak version of a barley wine. Though very interesting, I couldnt drink more than one of these at a time.

The nose was full of floral, piney, but primarily citric hops, with a bit of malt sweetness behind. The taste was led by hop power - citrus and pine, but balanced well with the honey and caramel flavors of the malt. The high bitterness only grew with more sipping. The mouth was medium, with tingly but fine carbonation on the palette. Overall, a great beer, with exceptional balance and great hop flavor. I had this pegged as some sort of pale ale at first, but it does just fine as an ESB.","mjc410","Dec 14, 2006"

The flavor was nice and blanced, but subtle, with nothing dominating or overpowering. My biggest complaint was the complete lack of aftertaste. Once it was down, the flavor was gone -- nothing in my mouth to remind me of what I just drank. I was disappointed by this, but it's still an enjoyable brew, and certainly light enough that you could easily drink a few of these in an evening.

Nose: A thorough prickle of hops upfront, some sweetness slides in quickly -- candied cherries, oranges, orange zest, solid hint of caramel -- while the hops continue to hold center-court. Taste: Starts from the back with a blunt yet subtle grate of crusty hops, and moves forward with a very round sweetness -- melons and most definitely apricot come to mind. The aftertaste is a twang of lemon zest, as the hops ascend even further, even a little peppery, leaving more fully fledged malt sweetness.

Flavor is big on herbal hops up front, with an underlying fruity ester quality. Something about the mix of the hops and malt flavors remind me of watermelon bubblegum just for a second. Follows through with some bready malts and toasted notes. Finishes dry, slightly bitter, with a little alcohol kick and slight astringency. Herbal hop flavor sticks through the entire way.

3.64,0,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Appearance was a fairly clear, brown-amber. Nice subtle floral-hop on the nose. After a few swallows it reminded me of the textbook ESB style. The hops are plentiful but do not overpower; it's more of a strong bitterness rather than the citusy hop punch paramount in many Pacific Northwest winter seasonals. It finishes dry with mild lingering spiciness. 2° Below is one of the lighter winter seasonals available in mouthfeel and helps it to be quite drinkable, so it's surprising to learn the ABV is 6.6%. A dandy winter warmer.","Gruntlumber","Nov 09, 2005"
