"Flavor is herbal and floral hop dominant, almost tea-like, with muddled citrus and tropical fruit accents throughout. Reminds me of a faint Flintstone vitamin character. Very different, and complex. The finish is moderately bitter and resiny, but fades to toasted malt."
""
"Had this on tap at the Pint Room. Color was beautiful, a very light copper. Bitter wet hops flavor..:awesome. Strong mouthfeel, a little harsh but ok for the genre. Good stuff."

"O: FFF has proven to be a world class brewery that can master any style while at the same time adding their own touch that makes it a truly unique drinking experience.  World class."

"Verdict: A very nice ESB from Three Floyds, pleasantly bitter and big. Lots of malt, plenty of underlying hops, a nice balance is struck. I appreciate that the traditional malty ESB backbone is still in the forefront when it comes to a Three Floyds beer, perhaps one of their least ""not normal"" beers, but it makes this a success."

"O - Lord Rear Admiral is hands down the greatest ESB in the world. It combines brewing talent and creativity in a bottle and provides a lovely experience. I have a soft spot for the English esb style and this just blows it wide open. So tasty and thick. I was excited to see bottles heading my way, so I hope to get more in the future. If I could pick a beer to drink every day with any meal it would be this one. A complex yet balanced masterpiece from Three Floyds."
"Tasted from a 1 pt 12 oz bottle on April 3, 2015."

"Lord Horatio Nelson (after whom this beer takes its name) is celebrated as one of Britain's most heroic naval figures and has monuments all over the country, including Trafalgar Square in London. I'm not sure what the Munster, Indiana equivalent would be - the parking lot of the Hilton off the brewery's industrial strip? - but this Lord Admiral is deserving of a statue too."

"Overall - A nice bitter ale that goes down extremely smooth. Another winner for FFF! Looking forward to having more of this. Can't go wrong with an $8 bomber of this if you like a nice bitter ale."
""
""
"Overall: Solid, but I don't really think this is my style, even with a nice citrusy hop profile."

"Deep, golden almost amber color with fluffy white head that delivers excellent lacing throughout the drinking experience. The smell jumps out of the bottle as soon as you pop the cap. Big bright hop punch that has some fruitiness and bitterness that hits hard then fades away. This beer was even better than I remember it from last year. Hop forward like many 3 Floyd's but there is balance with the malt. An ESB that would satisfy hop heads for sure."

"Overall: Although I like the ESB style, I found this way too hoppy and bitter compared to English versions like Fuller's; I wouldn't have expected any less from Three Floyds and while I like hops as much as the next guy, this beer didn't quite do it for me"
""
""

"Pours a nice copper/burnt orange color, fluffy slightly off white head, good retention. Great whiffs of bready, nutty, toasty, biscuity, caramely malts blend whith whiffs of orange and light berry. Taste brings above notes together in a fantasticly balanced blend, wonderful malt base with fruity notes throughout. Medium bodied, a touch more heft would be welcome. Fantastic, unique, flavorful ESB."
"O - A solid bitter from FFF that is really easy to drink but brings a lot of flavor. Worth getting a bottle if you are near when they have it out, especially if you are a fan of the style."

"Copper brown, offwhite head with dense, creamy retention and webbed lace. Nose has an abundance of caramel, sweet and bready. A good dose of citrus hops, but some earthier and spicier notes too. Light on the palate, citrusy and rind-y. Still an abundace of caramel and toasty biscuit. Medium feel, quite low carb. This is very drinkable - cask treatment would be awesome."
"O: very flavorful and great balance. this is my first beer from three Floyd's and it is very good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: decent, but not particularly memorable. Glad that I tried it, but not rushing out to pick itup agin. Tastes like an IPA past its prime."

"O- I was expecting something good but I got something great, a unique ESB and an amazing beer all around. Thank the gods I took that trip to the brew pub."
""
""
"Overall. Not being the biggest esb fan (""No no, Not ESB, I said IPA! I only drink hoppy beer.""), I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did. Awesome beer."
"O: Winner here, definitely a great bitter beer that is not over the top by any means."
"As FFF does they didi a greta job with this brew. Giving a slight American twist to a English import style. Very nice job."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy medium brown color with a fluffy cream colored head. The scent lives up to its name as it has a strong bitter scent of hops. Starts off with a refreshing wet taste that is bready and malty. It moves into a crisp bitter finish that is dry and complex. Like other 3 Floyds beers that I have had, this one is blended nicely together that is makes it hard to pick out individual attributes as they compliment each other very well. Only complaint is this was a little more watery then I was expecting, but the dry finish makes up for it."
"Fresh bottle in a duvel tulip. Pours a nice clear amber with an inch thick off white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is light citrus, toffee, and malt. Flavor is excellent. A nice cutting piney hop blends with a smooth malt and caramel and toffee notes. Mouthfeel is medium to light and it lingers. It sort of makes you salivate for another. Very very good beer."
"O - Delicious and a bit hard to place. Fruity and malty goodness."
""
""
""
"O: A very tasty well-balanced ESB with a FFF twist. One of several brews that proves that FFF is a very solid brewery adept at creating exceptional brews in a variety of styles."
""
"Overall, I just can't find anything wrong with this brew. I think it has great characteristics all around with nice balance included."

"O: Another good, well made beer from 3 Floyds that paired quite nicely with homemade carnitas tacos."

"Would be a tough one to have more than a bottle of in one sitting (especially considering this bottle is bomber size), because of the up-front bitter/tart/tangy element...but damn, it's a good one and surely one of Three Floyds' more interesting and nonconformist brews, for sure."
"A good beer, something different than I am used to from FFF."
"Thanks to a buddy for sharing this with me. Pours a hazy reddish orange into a snifter glass. Has a mellow citrus/floral taste up front, with a bready malt background at the finish. Could be insanely sessionable as its so easy to drink. Interesting american take on a ESB. Love how hazy 3F's beers are."
"Overall, Admiral Lord Nelson is an excellent North American interpretation of an Extra Special Bitter. It combines many standard ESB qualities with an over-the-top hoppiness and insanely robust aromas. A complete joy to drink, I would recommend this to hop heads and English ale lovers alike."
"O: A pretty good offering from the Three Floyds line-up, this one has the characteristic Three Floyds hop touch, but is still utterly drinkable and reasonably faithful to the style. Perhaps a bit expensive for what it is, I still happily gulp this stuff down."
"O: A solid, hoppy bitter. Clean and easy drinking with a solid malty base. I'd definitely buy more of this for Spring/Fall if it was locally available."
"Overall I am a big fan of this beer, and will definitely be picking myself up some next time I can make it to 3F."
"O - A really good IPA, a really ""off"" ESB, but damn good nonetheless!"
"Heavy side of light bodied. Lively carbonation. One of the better American versions I've had of this style. Falls right into 3F's wheelhouse."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink a few of these bitter, malt bombs!"
"Definitely the most impressive offering from FFF for me because I wasnt expecting it to be as good as it was. Definitely the best ESB I've had. And a great introduction to the style if you're looking."
"I think this is a good beer and a good ESB, even if it is a bit ""Americanized."" We are seeing exactly what the Brits had intended with this beer: something on the left side of malty and smooth, with excellent ale characteristics, like fruitiness from the esters and a bitterness that pushes back! Great American craft beer...would completely recommend this beer."
"Drink- It was a tasty ESB. It has been a while since I had an ESB and this was pretty money on flavor and balance. I've liked a lot of the three floyds stuff I have had. This was a nice simple clean beer for me."
"O: Not a style I drink a lot of, but this one is fantastic. A hopped up ESB, another job well done by Three Floyds. Would be a nice beer to drink all the time."
"Lord Admiral Nelson pours a roasted chestnut color, a bit dark for the style, and lightens to amber when heldo to light. The off white foam that caps the beer approaches three fingers in height, has displays decent retention, and is nice and sticky. The nose has some crisp biscuity and caramel malty notes, as well as some herbal hop notes. A light citric aroma enters the picture as well, and serves as a nice accent rather than taking over the whole beer. The nose serves as a pretty good preview of what's to come. The bready and caramel sweetness lead things off, before a modest bitterness lets itself be known mid palate. The balance is superb, I couldn't describe this beer as either overtly hoppy or malty. The same predominantly noble, herbal hop, with a light touch of American citrus blend is on display at the back end of each sip. Props the 3 Floyds for showing restraint and keeping this one essentially British, with just enough American influence to liven things up. The mouthfeel is pretty solid overall. The body is sturdy, relatively full for the ABV, and the carbonation is slightly understated. A great spin on a classic style."
"O - If one of the criteria for this style is balance, this is right on. Hops aren't overbearing, malt isn't overbearing, they just come together to make a tasty medium bodied beer. Little heavy for me on a summer release, but the taste helped me get past that."
"o - overall a very solid offering for an ESB, can certainly hang with the best of them when it comes to ESBs."
"Overall a decent beer. Didn't blow me away but didn't dissapoint. Only thing I don't care much for is the floral hop notes in the flavor. A pretty solid beer though. Easy to drink."
"my onyl drawback was I wanted it to be even more bitter than it was."
"O- This is a good beer...However, it used to be better. I swear this thing is darker and not as dry this year than in years past. In fact, this beer is incredibly similar to Alpha King this year. I'm going to drink and AK after this for comparison. Go back to the old way, FFF."
"Neighbor brougth home a growler of Sir Lord Admiral Nelson from Three Floyds...it was about a day and ahlf old. The appearance was nice, great head and a caramel clear color. The nose offered hop, alcohol, and some malt. The taste was very sweet to me...definitely bitter....and some hops. The bitterness really affected the mouthfeel score....for me at least. Wasn't a big fan of this beer. Not nearly as good as some of 3Fs other offerings."
"O- I have been waiting to try this one, somehow missed last year, despite looking for it. Overall, another nice offering from FFF. Would I consider it 100% ESB...maybe not, but it definitely more English, than the Blackheart English IPA. Both are great beers, that I have no reservations about drinking again. I bought a few bombers of LAN to being home."
"O - Pretty good beer, ESB's are a style I enjoy when there's a good one, and I'd consider this a good one. Will definitely drink when available."
" Medium body with some hop resins present on the palate. Extremely drinkable. Another great one in FFF’s awesome line of hoppy beers."
"I would not have guessed the 6.5% ABV. none detected at all."
"Poured from bomber (no date stamp on bottle) into dimpled mug glass. Pours a nice cloudy orange color with a small and frothy white head. Aroma is of hops, grapefruit, citrus, sweet, bready and caramel malts and some toffee. Flavor is nice picking up juicy hops with flavors of citrus, white grapes, grapefruit, herbs with a tea-like taste, sweet candy type maltiness, caramel and toffee, bready and biscuity malts. The body is medium with a nice silky smooth mouthfeel. Overall a really good ESB, with an American twist to it. Glad to have tried this brew."
"OVERALL: Decent beer with an enjoyable flavor profile, but the look was just too average and the palate was worth forgetting. The taste didn't really match the nose either. It was actually a half-decent dark IPA, but not really good representation of an English ESB. Glad to have tried it, but don't need it again. Thanks again thomashardy!"
"Atmosphere very nice. Great color, and a giant head with some great lacing. Nose is not complex, but has an interesting river water or seawater character that's tough to place, but makes it quite unique. Bitter character but a nice slightly sweet balancing act. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"D - This is a typical FFF hopfest, whereby they take a style and hop the shit out of it to create an awesome beer. Yeah! That's not to say that the beer itself is ""typical"". Quite the contrary. It's also not just a hop bomb, as there is plenty of malt sweetness that is typical of the ESB style. You could call it an EESB, I guess."
"Beer is medium bodied and heavy in the front and thin at the back. There is a lot of piny hop flavor in this beer with only a minimal sweetness up front. The hop flavors fill out the midpalate so thoroughly the beer falls flat on the finish. Pretty good drinking beer. Very enjoyable. Bitterness is minimal but that's OK for the style. I'd have it again. The more I drink the more resiny the beer gets but that's from the high hop presence. It is good!"
"A medium bodied brew with a smooth feel and light level of carbonation. It is very drinkable and a fine example of the style."
"(46)"
"D: A very under the radar offering from FFFs, and I don't know why. To me it's a very enjoyable, and highly drinkable brew. It's probably the most IPA-ish ESB on the planet, and it totally works because of balance. There's a very pleasant flavor that runs through the brew that gives it a great personality. The malts and hop flavors work perfectly together. Hard to find but woth the hunt."
"Pours deep orange w/ a fluffy white head. Smell is sweet clover honey, sharp minerals, autumn leaves. The taste is clean mineral water, herbal honey, tangelo tang, orange skin bitter finish. It's highly carbonated, mid-weight body. Really too easy to drink for a beer this big. Well done."
"D: High. I could drink this all day and be perfectly happy."
"I'd return to this beer gladly at any time."
"D - Very good, clean and refreshing. Quite poundable. This is a great beer for sure."
"Average mouthfeel and decent drinkability. This is an okay beer, I would probably only try it again if I could do so on tap though."
"Got this as an awesome extra in a trade recently with a very generous Midwest BA. Poured this into a pint glass. The beer is a cloudy amber color with a big frothy looking white head that shrinks down to soapy lacing. I'm not really loving the smell on this. Sweet malts are really front runners on this. I get a kind of apple sauce smell, but it seems really out of place. Behind all that is a slight smell of piney hops. I'd really love a bit more of a hoppy smell. Big malts on this with a decent bittering finish of floral piney hops. It's pretty nice drinking, but I overall am a little underwhelmed by this one right now. The mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I would imagine but the carbonation is nice. Overall this beer drinks fair enough, but I'm not in love with it."
"I poured this one into a Guinness pint glass. It poured a watery light amber, very translucent with a frothy white head. The smell is a wonderful mix of floral hops, bitterness, and light dry sweetness. The taste is good but it's not mind blowing by any means. I remember this being better last year. It drinks very thin and isn't as crisp as I'd like it to be. It's very drinkable because it's a very solid beer but this bottle at least disappointed me a little bit. It's good but nothing too crazy."
"overall a great ESB (it doesn't hurt I'm having it extremely fresh as well). Not too sweet...a perfect balance of hops/sweet malts. The first time I reviewed this I wasn't much of a hophead. I preferred stouts and that was about it. My palate has definitely changed and for the better."
"d - A very good beer. Lots of citrus in the nose and taste, and it was very easy to drink. I would definitely like to try this one again."
"Another great 3f that should be sought out."
"D - The beer is very drinkable and is a good representative of the style even if on the high end abv-wise but brings a lot of English character with the ingredients used"
"Love this beer."
"D:A very delicious, easy to drink, and flavorful beer that I could take down all the time no problem (especially with the decent price tag and abv.) Another great brew from FFF as usual, just a lot of pleasant hop action that is very balanced at the same time. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability -- There is a *lot* of overlap in flavor profile between Lord Admiral Nelson and Alpha King. Nelson shares the big hop profile of Alpha King but with more subdued caramel malt sweetness. Not a perfectly dry ESB, but still quite quenching. Love it."
"Overall, this is another extremely fine offering from three floyds. If this became the mold for an american ESB, I would not complain. I am very glad to have had the chance to try this."
"drinkability: great"
"D - A very good brew from FFF. Why am I not shocked?"
"D: Goes down easily, somewhat filling, mild kick. This is one that I would love to have again!"
"A medium amber color is poured in the glass, with a light beige colored head that is about a half inch high. The laces slowly down the glass and settles to a thin layer. Citrus and grass right into the nose at every scent, then gradually fading away slowly. A cracked grain and bready/yeasty flavor attacks the palate come to the front, but is soon overtaken by the hops. The hops bring a strong grapefruit flavor that attacks the palate, that is followed up by a piney resin flavor, that lingers on the palate. A watery thin texture at the front, then gradually gaining weight and becoming more medium bodied, staying that way till the finish. A strong bitter? How about an extreme bitter, this one crosses over into the IPA realm. Everything is very good about this beer though, an inviting look and a fragrant aroma invites one to the glass. The taste just backs up those aspects, with strong hop flavor and intensity. The feel stays consistent all the way through, so hop heads drink up."
"D: very good and drinkable esb from FFF and will definitely seek out another bottle."
"Another good FFF brew that I'm really happy I got to try! I would have loved to sample this fresh."
"I really enjoy this beer. I hope FFF decides to brew this again."
"Overall this was a very nice ESB and another great beer from Three Floyds. If you see this beer grab a bottle or two and enjoy! Recommended."
"Hey, Nick Floyd: if you are reading this, make more of this gem and make it often! Seasonal, springtime six packs of this stuff would be fantastic. Oh, and since I have your ear, distribute to OHIO again! That is all."
"D - This was pretty easy to drink. The 6.5% is well-hidden and the texture and flavors are conducive to multiple pours. Wish I'd found this when it was fresher - I tried it on-tap and the hops really popped back then. Look for a re-review next time this is bottled."
"D - Low enough ABV and not too overbearing, would session."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Not an ESB per se, but taken in context with the 3F pantheon it fits right in. All the malt character of an ESB with some American hopping."
"D- This was a pretty easy drinker, polished off the bomber no problem. I probably wont look to have it again though, just more hoppy than I like in an ESB."
"Medium-bodied with good effervescence. Slightly warming and smoother than expected, though I don't know why I thought that. A decent tasting brew though it needs more body to it."
"D: Phenominal. Not much more I can say about that."
"Thanks Cheezdawg!"
"Drinkability is super high. No alcohol is apparent in the taste of this well-balanced and full-flavored beer."
"It was odd to me, that an ESB had such citrusy hops, but it is an American ESB, just like APAs differ from EPAs."
"D: An all-around good drinker."
"M/D - Not as rough on the palate as appearance shows, medium body and a slight dry finish...not as dry as expected with the gratuitous amount of hops. Super drinkable."
"I have wanted to try this one for a while and was excited to see it at the tasting. The beer pours an orange, iced tea color with a large white head. The aroma is resiny hops, very impressive for a beer of this style. The flavor is caramel malt along with the same resiny hops from the aroma. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This poured a clear copper with a little tan head. It smelled like apricot and papaya and candied grapefruit, with some light caramel and orange. It tasted like orange and apricot, with some grapefruit and papaya and honey. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, with a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was unlike any other ESB I've had, but it was certainly both extra special and bitter. It was also very sweet and hoppy and clean. This is what English IPAs should be (rather than the boring, earthy, under-hopped drinks they tend to be). Great beer."
"Drinkability - no alcohol burn, great hop flavor. nice citrusy zest, very easy to drink, I hope I can obtain this one again!!!!"
"Poured clear copper color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate earthy hop aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy spicy bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable beer."
"D: This is not always my favorite style, but Three Floyds has done well here. A nice hop component which allows a bit of malt to come through, but not all that much in terms of sweetness."
"An amber-copper colour with small head, that leaves some lacing down the glass. The aroma is really strong here - some piney hops and caramel sweetness. The taste is like a classic bitter, just hopped up with the American style hops. I had split this bottle and wish I could have drank more. I really enjoy this."
"Jon's bottle. The aroma is he first to hit, amarillo orange like and then some odd acidity. Beautiful head on cloudy orange. A creamy taste. It is a nice orange tangerine IPA bitterness, unique although nothing I would seek out again. Lacey. Nice orange aftertaste."
"D- Overall is a very good beer. However, is a little hoppier than I typically expect in an ESB. Its not bad, just a general observation."
"Extremely drinkable. Another great one in FFF's awesome line of hoppy beers. What an amazing American style English bitter. Respects the style yet adds a nice twist to it. A great session beer. What, the ABV is 6.5%? Oh really? Well, this is a great session beer still."
"A real soft yeasty start on the lips - I love that feeling: carbonation gases exposing the creamy body, right off the bat. Just beyond it's a cool sweep of breadishly sweet malts keeping things moving on an even keel. The taste sharpens, becoming distinctly Cu metallic. A soft floral note takes hold right as the beer peaks. The sharp copper and the softly bitter hop dance wonderfully towards my throat. A charge of citric sweet lemon spreads quickly, becoming earthy and bitter. Buttery and then more pointedly bitter in the finish. puckering now, with some high notes sticking around the top of my mouth. A fun beer to swirl around. Those full buttery notes take their toll nearing the end of the bomber. My lips are sticky, along with my throat. No denying though that this beer is fun as it looks."
"Pours with a light fluffy head. Just a bit of lace as the head falls. Near crystal clear light gold in color with plenty of fizz. Smells wonderful; lots of tropical fruits (mango, papaya, pineapple, etc.) Whoa...remarkably thin and exceptionally drier than I anticipated. Lots of tropical fruit flavors up front, some malt and then...I dunno...it just sort of evaporates! Extremely drinkable at first, until I get a nasty bit of ""hot"" alcohol (fusels?) in the aftertaste which fortunately dissipates rather quickly. This could be called Alpha King Light."
"World Class."
"(D)- A good ESB with a good maltiness that smoothes out some of the harshness the massive hops might impart. Definitely an easy drinker; the 22oz. bottle didnt last lont."
"I don't know why but when my buddy always recommends a beer from FFF, I always hesitate just a bit. Finally, he gets tired of me doubting and we end up splitting a bomber. I have finally stopped doubting the FFF because this beer is awesome. I like ESB's and their harsh bitter finishes and this one is not a let down. Pours a copper reddish orange with a decent 2 finger head. It start out with a nice caramel malty sweetness then transitions to an intense tart then it takes you back down the mountain and finishes with a long, long harsh bitter ending. Everything one could want in an ESB. I bow to you FFF."
"Admiral Lord Nelson Strong Bitter is yet another winner from one of my favorite American breweries. The hops hit hard, but there's also a more than solid brew supporting them. If you like your ESBs to be extra special and extra bitter, seek this one out. Awesome label art, as always."
"drinkability is good and would be even better if they put it in 6packs"
"A little thin and bubbly in the mouth. This hurts the drinkability a bit."
"D- The lower ABV on this makes it a easy drinker. In fact I cracked open another one after I was done with this one. Good work like usual Three Floyds! If you have the chance to snag this one....do it. You won't regret it at all."
"Drinkability is good--the bitterness is well balanced with the malty finish and the floral hints complement the bitterness nicely."
"I could drink this all night!!!"
"Nicely balanced for a floyds beer. No real malt character just a breadiness. Same nectarine notes with some floral aspects as well. Nothing I'd seek out but definitely glad I tried."
"Mouthfeel is slightly heavy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was very good, I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely buy it again if I could. The sweet citrus flavor of hops was very nice and worked well with the bitter finish."
"Overall one of the best ESB I have ever had. Seriously this is nuts and everyone needs to try this."
"Drinkability? 22oz of this nectar and I'm yearning for more. I'd like to see 3F try doing a regular Bitter(if they haven't already done so). I'd bet London to a brick on that it would be another thing of beauty."
"D - Not really true to style but exactly what I would expect from a 3F ESB."
"I know FFF is all about doing things a little different, and for me, this beer expands my concept of this style. Definitely strong on hops, but with considerable sensitivity to some of the other character of the beer, it varies between full-on strength and finely subtle nuance. Quite worth the try, in my opinion."
"This is nothing far from a amazingly crafted work of art. Easily up there with the dreadnaughts and behemoths. An immediate favorite."
"Pours clear and a dark copper color. The head is thick and creamy with an off white color and emits a big and bold citrus and floral hop aroma. A preview of another deliciously hoppy brew from FFF, the taste is sweet and hoppy. A touch tart and harsh bitterness alongside the mild body and high carbonation make this brew dance on the palate and explode with sweet hoppy flavor. The finish is also tart and bitter but it fades slowly and gently. Great session strength and flavor."
"This is a very flavorful beer. It's definitely a bitter, but not overly bitter to where you can't enjoy the beer. The beer had a nice aroma surrounding it after the pour and it produced very little head. The finish was clean and not overpowering. A great beer by Three Floyds."
"This might be the easiest beer from three floyds to drink. Yes I enjoy the giant hop bombs and the 9+ ABV beers, but this is a hit. At only 6 Percent this is a session beer for me. I hope this is a year long product and not just a seasonal . I will say that my point of view is a little skewed because I only paid 3.99 for the bomber. I don't know if the price was wrong or that3floyds is trying to market this new beer, but at 3.99 I will make this a regular in my rotation if not the only beer I drink."
"I'm re-reviewing this beer. Just had this yesterday at Three Floyds on tap. It's quite different from what I remember. Pours a nice hazy orange-gold with good lacing. Taste is much more mild than I remember, very pleasant and balanced with great malt character. Bitter, but not what I would call hoppy (in a big way). The yeast is awesome in this beer, very biscuity. It really stays with you. This is a great representation of an ESB. Enough to convince me to brew one of these after my Belgian Trappist completes primary!"
"Poured a dark copper with a nice creamy head, although not as much as is normal for the style. The nose is definitely dominated by some great citrus hops atop semi-sweet caramel malt. The taste was very similar to an IPA, but with a decidedly English influence, though still different from an English IPA. Medium body with good carbonation, the drinkability on this was excellent, and I'm really looking forward to being able to try the bottled edition."
"Pours a nice maple syrup brown with two inches of sandy head. Great lacing and retention. Smell is largely grapefruit, big hops, though there is something that's a bit off and I can't put my finger on it. Taste here is great, big piney hops, a bit of weedy hops, finished with some biscuity/bready malt--a hopped-up ESB. Great stuff here, I guess this review is to style, because as a beer overall I would call this an A-, but as an ESB, this is definitely an A. MF is medium, coating, creamy, maybe a tad over-carbonated. Very drinkable, a great session brew, if I had it in me I could easily have three bombers of this. I do not, but that's the kind of drinkability this thing has."
"this was great, one of the highlights of my night. i hope they end up bottling this."
"D - Easy to drink and an awesome brew. I drink this one every time I'm in the BrewPub and never get tired of it!"
"D-very well balanced favoring the hops make this a super tasty beer that is backed by a great mouthfeel"
"Attention Three Floyds! Are you listening? You MUST make as a hand pulled cask ale version of this."
"D: Very good. I'd order another and buy a sixer. I tried to buy a growler, but the batch was too small to allow that they said :-( Bottles are coming out in January apparently."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and slight with a good strong carbonation."
"An easy drinker, I understand that this one will be 'bottle bound' soon. Unique product that I look forward to trying it again once this controversial, potentially notorious, British maritime hero is preserved forever as another 3-Floydian caricature."
"D= A very enjoyable beer that breaks all of the ""rules", but then there aren't a lot of rules for this style. I would have liked to see a bit more caramel sweetness in there but its a good beer for sure."
"Overall, a big dose of hops, and way too much for the style. But gosh o' gosh was this beer tasty. An ESB for the American Hop Head if there ever was one."
"On tap at the Three Floyds Brewpub. Served in an English pint glass. Pours a deep red/amber with a nice tan fluffy head. The head diminishes quickly. Leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is of lighly sweet fruity dry hops. Flavor is all sweet hops with sublte notes of caramel and fruit. Medium creamy body with a lightly bitter finish. This beer is excellent. Very smooth. A nice surprise!"
"have had this several times since it's bomber release and surprisingly i've been even more impressed each time. best esb ever."
"This is one of the better bitters I've had lately (on par with Rogue's Brutal Bitter) and it is very disappointing that they actually stopped serving it while I was at the pub. Nevertheless, I obviously got there just in time to try this stellar offering. Citrusy, but not quite as hoppy as some bitters (rogue), this was just right."
"Great amber, copper hue with very small and slow bubbles heading to the surface. LIght foamy head at time of serving that lasts for a few minutes after the first few sips. The aroma was a piney, floral hop bouquet with some bready mlats lingering here and there. Almost makes me think of candy for some reason. The taste has a great malty sweetness mixed with the complex hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was a little tooo astringent for an English beer. But still syrupy and smooth. Great beer."
