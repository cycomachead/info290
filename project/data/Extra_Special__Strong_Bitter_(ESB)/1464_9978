Aromatics carry a grainy, husk filled nutty character pretty generic Red Ale qualities, cereal grains minimal to absent hop notes comes off as an herbal earthy character if I had to pick a hop profile. Flavor has cereal grain sweetness, a hint of honey malts, even a Wheaties character...earthy herbal hops in the finish still a bit too sweet for my tastes.

Bitter this is not, in fact, it tends more to its malt side than the bittering hops. It has a good flavor indeed and is quite drinkable. The look is of clear amber under an ivory head.
