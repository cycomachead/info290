Aroma is very biscuity, has a ""tang"" to it that I would describe as faintly metallic. Sweet and fruity in the mouth. British malts are fairly subtle, lending some caramel and slight breadiness. Lots of fruitiness from the yeast, seems to be the dominant set of flavors here. Oily texture that coats the tongue. Some slight hop bitterness on the finish but they don't show up strong in the aroma or flavor profile. I'd like it better with more malt character, less carbonation, and maybe even a little more hop bitterness. Your mileage may vary.","anarchia","Jan 17, 2014"

The smoky porter taste which dominates later is pleasant enough, but lacks the malt dominance one might expect from an ESB. Probably the issue is a combination of bottle conditioning and age on the bottle, where the remaining yeast eventually bore some unintended fruity esters. I'll try to find a fresh bottle and give this another whirl.","scotorum","Nov 22, 2013"

Aromas of sugary sweetness in front, with toffee and caramel notes abound, highlighted by hints of chocolate and an almost egg nog like character. Very rich and sweet. Flavors of roast forward, with a strong nutty character blending with a rich milk chocolate profile. Very interesting, very sweet and bitter, balanced, and a touch earthy. An overall roasted character prevails, with a bitter build towards the end of the palate, combining with a tangy caramel highlight. The body is thin, but robust and supportive of all the flavors.

I guess the fact that AleSmith is finally putting a date on the bottle is why I was willing to pick it up. I could trust it wasn't like 2 years old or something like that. In the end I wasn't too impressed. The vegetal notes are a bit off-putting, and overall it's just not well rounded enough to score highly. Considering this is $5 a bomber I would much rather get a sixer of GI Honker's or something like that. Worth a try...","bennetj17","May 16, 2013"

Hops are evident and chime in with floral-metallic-earthy aromas and flavors. More refined and British than any other San Diego area beer that I’ve tried. The bitterness is excellent, but the medicinal note just makes it difficult for me to enjoy the beer fully. I might try to grab a second bottle to see if I got an off example.

Deep bronzed color reddish-brown until a bright orange develops at the glass bottom, trim with a mild translucent blurring, rivulets of tiny active bubbles along the insides. The nose barely betrays any bitterness, a novice would be confused by the category name, all softer malts and caramel, butterscotch, heavy cream, milk chocolate, buttermilk biscuits and nuts, nearer to room temperature you get peat and earth accents and a lifting florality. Medium-bodied, the carbonation works hard to prevent things from congealing and, for the most part, succeeds. That said, it is not a thirst quenching, refreshing quaff. The sweetness of the caramel, chocolate, butterscotch joined here by fig, raisin, cherry, apricot fruit flavors. The nuttiness likewise has more of a candied than roasted nature. The floral notes swell in the middle then segue into mineral water, earth, grass. Still, no sense waiting on any bitterness as it’s not really coming. As a quality beer it’s tasty enough, does wear you down some through the second pint. Not sure it’s a “classic” ESB.","farrago","May 09, 2011"

4.12,6.2,3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D/O: Fresh Anvil is not extreme, but it is a real treat because it is a relatively rare style of pale ale that is done well and even bottled. There is no attempt to adapt or spin it into being some bastardized California-version of the style; this is a dark and traditional rendition, featuring the best that the English ingredients have to offer. Careful craftsmanship is also evident in the general cleanliness of the sensory profile, particularly the lack of diacetyl and also little in the way of esters. It strikes a favorable balance often missed by the finest of American ales, being a natural compliment to a wide variety of foods (yet still hoppy enough to keep things interesting.)

There is a strong spiciness toward the finish as well with only a hint of the bread behiind the massive bitter kick. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with a strong carbonation that accentuates the tartness. The drinkability is limited a little by the bitterness, but this is a decent bitter and a very unique offering from AleSmith.","gford217","Aug 19, 2008"

The smell is sweet with a pleasant yeasty sourness. Notes of caramel and roasted malts are present too. A nice hop aroma is there as well. The taste is sweet with a slight bitterness that balances well. A fruity taste is apparent with cherries being the one that comes to mind. This medium bodied beer fills the mouth and tickles the tongue with mini bubbles and a perfect carbonation level.

4.35,12.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"What a great thing to be trying a new Alesmith brew! This one poured a very vigorous deep orange amber. A very dark color which took me a little by surprise to be honest. A very nice three inches of head formed on the top in a good light tan to off white color. Great retention had this thing hanging around for what seemed like forever. Some sediment actually poured out of the bottom and graced over the top of the foam at the end. A very hazy and cloudy brownish amber this was and it had a very full look to it. A very nice aroma of deep caramel malts was the first thing I noticed. A nice subtle hoppiness as well, though sweet. The flavor was very full, almost a hoppy scotch ale of sorts. Very big with a grainy and chewy kind of feel to it. Medium body with ample carbonation led to a great rich feel and this was just a superb drinker. Overall I really liked this one. Much more full bodied then some of the ESBs I have had in the past, this one really had a body on it and was very filling. Great hoppy finish and a very well rounded feel. A great ESB and a great addition to the Alesmith lineup, this one was definitely a keeper.","mikesgroove","Nov 03, 2007"

The malts waft out and present themselves in the form of molasses, vanilla, wood and earth. The hops bring floral and fruity notes to the table. I can also smell the yeast. The taste isn't very bitter at all. Quite balanced, but probably leaning more on the malt. In addition to the characteristics previously mentioned, there is also a sweetness resembling orange honey. The mouthfeel is very soft with very little carbonation bite. Overall, this is a solid beer that I'm glad to have tried.","jakon","Oct 05, 2007"

The head was large, white and rocky. The bottle conditioning really carbonates this beer as I got way too much foam even though I poured slowly and gently. The smell was a little malty and caramel but not much in the way of hop aromas. The taste was good with caramel coming into play and maybe it was citrus I was detecting. The drinkability was very good as my pint was gone fast. Mouthfeel really benefits from the bottle conditioning as the beer feels creamy in the mouth.","ArrogantB","Apr 12, 2007"

Taste is more of the melon and fruity sweetness, a little candy like, some slight peppery and dry bitterness balances very nicely.

There really wasnt much smell to speak of, slight malt, but really dull in the aroma area. As you sip in the malt provides you with the first note, followed by some citrusy hops. The taste is subtle like a good English ESB. There also was not much carbonation to this brew, even for an ESB. This could be the reault of a poor keg/tap but the Liars Club is usually on point.

Taste is malty with toffee and caramel, balanced well with an English style floral hop bitterness. The apple skin presence from the aroma shows up in the taste, as well, joined by some pear.

Dry finish is grassy from hops without hop bitter. Very weedy rough. Toasted grain finish comes across almost as burned. This was not an enjoyable beer, IMO. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet md-light.

Relatively low ABV plus the aforementioned balance and deliciousness make this one hell of a session beer. Alesmith, please send kegs to PA.","IrishRedRock","Mar 27, 2006"
4.06,4.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Bomber with a silk screen label, poured into a 0.5L stein. This is a bottled conditioned beer so I left about ½ at the bottom to keep the sentiment out of my glass. This ESB is a rich caramel color with medium white head made of small bubbles that dissipated but kept a nice thing rim of foam around the side. Understated aroma with notes of maple syrup, plumb, and faint hints of bitter citrus. The flavor is a rich bled of caramel and bread crust, apples and leaf tea which finishes with a medium bettering hop-profile. It is very well balanced and a very good American example of this classic British style. The mouthfeel is soft and full, almost creamy but not too viscous. Good drinkability, consistent with the style; a good session beer.","Bcant","Jan 27, 2006"

Soft, mellow nose with a slightly juicy, ripe citrus/orange blossom hoppiness on an estery caramel malt frame. Mouthfeel is excellent. Supple, spicy, very light spiced bread sweetness towards the back, with a fresh, cleansing finish. Maybe just a bit watery. Nicely integrated flavors, true to the English style, and very quaffable.

Theres a good balance between the caramel malt and hop flavors, and some additional mineral and yeast notes too. The mouth feel is quite unusual: very smooth and rounded... almost salty, but not overly heavy. Doesn't quite pack the same flavor punch as the best ESBs that I've had, but this is still highly drinkable stuff. It was great with steak.","fisherman34","Sep 29, 2005"

The aroma had a little bit of caramel sweetness along with a complex hop profile consisting of floral, pine, citrus and a bit of spiciness. The flavour was very nicely balanced between malt and hop character. Nice base of malt sweetness with caramel and biscuit evident. Bitterness was assertive, but without any resinous quality, and a nice piney/floral flavour. The finish was short, but maintained its balance. Body was medium/light and carbonation was moderate.

The ESB is a nice copper color with a very thin head, relatively low carbonation. The smell is pleasant, nothing mind-blowing, just some sweet malt with the faintest grassy hops background. This drinks like an ESB that has been brewed with some brown sugar or molasses or something like that. It has that slightest cloying flavor that goes away just before it becomes too much. As it warms, this is accentuated, and the hops profile drops significantly. There are definitely some toffee notes here. Overall, a nice session beer this would make, with some fish and chips.

Rich malts everywhere...loads more caramel with toasted almonds & toffee. Fantastically balanced by spicy, peppery, in-the-ground floral hops. Beautifully balanced, seriously complex ale (especially for a fairly low gravity brew). Medium to light bodied, almost airy in the mouth. It was tough for me to have just one of these, what a treat.

Taste is kind of like the malt backbone of a pale ale, that almost sour wateriness with hints of slight citrus. But then...you get the hop aftertaste. It isn't aggressive, and it isn't sharp, but it's definitely bitter. Not in your face bitter, but a slight earthy bitter that acts as a nice counterpoint. The carbonation is low. Nice and smooth, but maybe I'd want more. Intensely quaffable, though, and if I were out in California, I'd drink this as a session brew.","twilight","Aug 20, 2004"

Pretty well balanced leaning perhaps a bit more to the hop side of the spectrum. A nice session beer, that I would love to sample from the cask.

The aroma comes on strong. It's sharply fruity and citrusy (orange, apricot, some lemon) over a sweet caramel and honey-ish malt - definitely attention getting! The body is medium with a lightly zesty carbonation that tickles the tongue. The flavor is a combination of fruity, citrusy (orange, grapefruit) and floral flavors from yeast and hops, married with a softly sweet and lightly toasty malt that's backed by a supportive bitterness. It finishes fruity but drying with some residual toffee-ish malt and swirling hop flavors. Very nicely balanced. Quite supple, and alive with bold flavors! Very clean and clearly well brewed.

Sweet toasty malt is the first to land on the tongue as it smooths over the interior of the mouth and slides down the throat in all its silkiness. As the sweetness of the malt descends a bit the subtle hops emerge and provide just the right dose of bitterness through the slightly bitter lingering finish. This brew has a great balance and excellent medium body. Although no single characteristic stands out as being amazing or remarkably memorable the balance and drinkability of this brew make it special for its overall qualities.","Murph","Dec 30, 2002"
4.35,12.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Nice copper color with a small but appropriate head for the style. The smell is malty with a nice hop background. Everything comes together nicely in the taste, which has currents of toasted bread and just a bit of fruity flavor. The malt flavor is well balanced when the hops hit the back of the tongue on the way down. It has a wonderful creamy feel and is profoundly drinkable. Who'd have thought that guys out of San Diego would be able to hold their own with the boys from Fuller's?","mickeymac","Dec 06, 2002"
3.55,-8.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The pour a quite deep crystal clear deep amber to almost brown color, the head monumental in size, creamy in texture, the lace in thick glutinous sheets that cling snuggly to the glass. Malt dominates the nose, some yeast and light floral tones also noticed. Start is malt sweet, the top is middling, snappily hopped, droughty aftertaste.","Gusler","Nov 20, 2002"

4.47,15.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a light copper color, but there are very fine particles in suspension.  Unlike I've seen before.  Not a lot of head.  There's some raw-hide hop aroma in this one.  I like it.  I really like this taste.  Husky, grainy and a bit raw, but also smooth.  There is a really mellow bitterness.  This beer is really nice and easily drinkable.  One of the best ESBs I've had.","Bighuge","May 18, 2002"
4.13,6.4,4.5,4,4,5,4,"Notes: Do this beer some justice, serve it at cellar temp and in a big mug to give nice firm pouring. Highly drinkable with back and forth flavours from the malt and hops. Right on target for the style, back and forth of hops and malt … this one is a keeper.","Jason","Mar 09, 2002"
