"Overall this is a delicious brew, one of the best if not the best i have tried in this style. It may be a bit dated now but i hope this is brewed nest spring!"
"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a medium to dark bronze amber with a fine one finger khaki head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel and light biscuit malt, light earthy nuttiness. Flavor is biscuit malt, tea, faint citrus with a light grassy hop finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation. A nice light bitter with traditional tasting malt and a bit more hops than traditional, but without breaking character. A worthy domestic take on this style."

"Overall: a very delicious smelling and tasting beer. Interesting American version of the classic English style."

"A very well done ESB. Delicious, malty base highlighted by a well done hop character."
""
""
"Overall I rate it as good, but not great. I've tried it and can now move on to something else."
""
""
""
"A solid ESB with good balance and intriguing flavor combinations. Definitely malt forward and the hops do their job by nicely counterbalancing the grain sweetness. A solid, satisfying offering."
""
"I am enjoying the beer and find it drinkable. I'd perhaps like a more pronounced aroma and malt presence, but the absence of these doesn't break the beer. It's good."
""
""
"O- A decent beer. Nothing extraordinary, but it's worth trying."

"Poured a clear reddish amber with a thin ring of white that left no lacing. It looks decent, but not spectacular. Scents of caramel, fruity esters, apple, tea and some floral hops. A nice, appealing, pub ale aroma, nothing too complex, but balanced and inviting. Taste begins with some nice caramel malt before moving into floral hop bitterness that is sustained throughout. There is also a distinct herbal hop flavor and some pine resin. A bit of grainy malt on the finish and aftertaste, along with bitter hops. The overall flavor is rather bitter for an ESB, but it's not bad, a little more sweet malt would make it better though. Mouthfeel is light bodied, lightly carbonation and semi-drying, with a bit of a soapy feel. A good session ale mouthfeel that makes you want to another sip. Overall this is a good ESB, with a nice aroma and mouthfeel and a good, albeit bitter flavor. If it was a little less bitter it would be better, but it's not bad."

"12 oz serving from a 6-pack from Fred Meyer in S.Salem. $6.99(6). Clear hazel nut brown colour with a large creamy thick eggshell white head. Hoppy aroma first..citrus,orange.papaya..not expected for style but nice .Slightly caramel malts in the back. Taste is more like style with the caramel malts taking a better place.Hops still there..PNW style. Its fine enough. Mouth feel is fine and the beer is medium carbonated. OK beer but not the best and the hops are not to style."
""
"Wouldn't turn down; worth a try as it is a worthy session beer, good for ESB lovers, and is widely available."
""
""
""
"BUT...still a quality-crafted, tasty beer. Keep rocking Alaska."
""
""
"This pours a clear, dark amber color with a slight beige head. The aroma is slightly malty with a touch of bitter hops. The taste is bold with just the right amount of hops that leaves a dry after taste. This is quite a well made ESB and a very well made beer, it’s well worth giving a try!"

"There is a vague caramel and biscuit malt character in the early sips but the floral and grassy hop bitterness comes pounding in from behind and taking over everything. Hopheads would like it."
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and nut aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, caramel, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice malt forward presence all around."
"Pours a crystal clear deep copper color with a huge bubbly off white head that persists forever. Aromas of brown sugar and caramel with hints of dark dried fruit and bits of sulfur and earth. The flavor is what I expected from the aroma. Light dark sugary malts with bits of earthy hop light fruit and hints of sulfur. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. Nice drinker, not really my favorite style, but this is a well made brew."
"Overall: A very solid take on the ESB style. Good presence of bitter floral hops with some subtle fruit notes."
"It's a world class beer."

"Overall, this is a nice ESB and hits all the notes I want."

"This ESB has a great balance and is quite drinkable."

"This is a really nice beer. It's not big and or bold, but it has very nice balance and subtle complexity. As noted above, it has more and better hop character than that beer they call an IPA."
"The body is odd. Some sweetness up front but finishes dry. Carbonation is light but good for style. Overall I would like a bit more English character in the malt, hops and yeast. But still an easy drinking beer."
"Dark amber or light brown in color. It has an autumn orange type of hue similar to some wood furniture you see. Some prickle and little to no head. Malty nose with a faint hint of hops. The attack is clean, but then the flavor hammers you with a strong bitter nut flavor. The nut and the bitter would be fine in the correct proportions and balance, but it seems that the nut overpowers the bitter and I don't feel that its a good thing. The aftertaste is consistent with the flavor. It sort of reminds me of when you get the nuts in the mixed nuts around Thanksgiving that are dried, or gone bad and they give a huge tart flavor that dries the mouth. I am appreciative that my father hauled this beer to me from Alaska, but its not my favorite of those he brought me."
"D- Very drinkable, definitely one to session on."
"Sample in the Alaskan tap room. This brew is a lightly hazed copper color with a medium thin and foamy off-white head that diminishes steadily. Rings of lacing on the glass. Hops, citrus and earthy malt aroma. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with hops, caramel and biscuity malt flavors. The finish is hoppy and lingering, with a touch of sweetness in the mix. Above average overall."
"Notes from 11/27/05"
"It began with two finger's worth of rocky, medium-tan head with low retention, but a good bit of lacing. Nose had a good bit of caramel accompanied by a mild bitterness. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a bitterness softly tempered by a caramel/malt sweetness. Finish had the same commingling of bitter and sweet that I got on the tongue. In fact, as it warmed, I got a really pronounced biscuitiness on the extreme finish. A very good ESB and a beer that nicely offset their Amber."
"The ESB is crisp and smooth, rich enough mouthfeel for the style. There is a slight bitterness in the finish that balances everything out. Drinkability is really good. This is a good tasting beer that goes down real easy. An ideal session beer and a good transition from swill to a well constructed beer with an actual flavor!!!"
"D: Very nice beer, not overpowering. Thank you, I will have another :)"
"this is an excellent concoction by AK. It has incredible hop flavor, and all the bitterness the hopheads like. Pours dark yet transparent amber, with good carbonation. I like the initial hop taste that really kicks your ass! suprisingly drinkable for an esb, many will mistake it for an IPA aside from the color. The finish shows a little malt but still very hoppy. Great brew."
"The first beer that I had after getting off the plane in Las Vegas. This turned out to be a pure, simple, and very desirable beer. It pours a brilliant, sparkling copper / amber hue with a steady off-white head formation that laced well as the beer line fell. Moderate aromas of caramel malts, and ale-typical fruity esters. Mild fermented flavors swirl around the malts for a rich aroma, flavor, and feel. An herbal, pungent English hop character cleans the beer up a bit, while offering some complexity. The beer is very well balanced, not preferencing the hops nor the malts. The feel is also moderate, not too heavy or thick, but not watering either. Very easy to drink with a mild hop lingering and flavor. I certainly would not hesitate to buy this beer again."
"D- richness of brew my make it hard to session, but absolutely delicious beer and an fine example of an ESB"
"Drinkability: One of my favorite Alaskan brews. Perfect balance of boldness and drinkability. Makes a great beer batter and compliments Alaskan seafood perfectly."
"Overall a nice example of the style, and easily drinkable."
"fizzy carbonation on the tongue, bitter hops up front, a metallic astringent flavor with the the hops there...good malt balance slightly lingers. Not a lot to say about this, it is a good example of the style and certainly a sessionable brew."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D: Light and easy to drink. It would definitely be alright if I had nothing else better. It seemed more like an American amber than a true ESB. Not bad..."
"This one's pretty good."
"Thanks, BeerRun13"
"I must say I was a bit disappointed by this ESB. The smell is very hoppy with a taste to match, with the hops creating a pleasant bitterness with a tangy sour flavor to match. A good taste but one-layered. The bitterness and the sour is all you get and any deeper search for taste yields nothing. The mouthfeel is bubbly, like club soda. Its weak mouthfeel lends itself to being an easy drinker, a positive aspect of this brew. Nothing horrible but you can certainly do better as far as the ESB style is concerned. Worth a try, nothing you'll find in my fridge quite often though."
"This is a very drinkable beer, a full-flavored version of an American macro maybe, but it has a distinct character as well. Its not a super beer, but an above average bitter just the same."
"D - Drinkable. A nice little ESB from Alaskan, would recommend."
"The smell is strong and full of malt. The taste is smooth, starting with amber malts and finishing with just enough hops to pronounce themselves. The mouthfeel is slightly sharp, while drinkability is good."
"All in all, a very nice brew that's getting me excited about what the Northwest has to offer!"
"Small white head, very good grapefruit aroma, bitter more than malty but overall balanced. Decent nicely drinkable bitter, though a bit watery. A few days after expirey, though I wouldn't blame it on that nor on Liquid Solutions who shipped it with just a few weeks to go."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a pretty copper-amber color topped by a half-inch or so of creamy tan head that exhibits some staying power. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, with a bit of tangy, fruity hops that become more assertive as the beer warms from fridge temperature. Palate is dominated by mellow sweet malt, accented slightly by some fruity hops and just a touch of English ale yeast. Body is just rich enough to complement the flavors without being too thick. I can see myself drinking a lot more of this."
"All of the Alaskan Brewing Company beers are solid and drinkable, although with the exception of Smoked Porter and Stout, I've never been overly impressed. It took nearly the entire bottle to come to this conclusion, but Alaskan ESB is my favorite non-dark offering from this brewery. If you're looking for a good ESB with an American citric hop edge, your search ends here."
"I think the lack of head may have been due to the pour coming from an older bottle. The tastes and feel held up wonderfully, though."
"Bottom line: A very solid ESB that I'll gladly drink more of and recommend."
"The beer is very smooth and easy to drink. I imagine this would be great as a session beer or with a nice BBQ dinner or even spicy thai food. Another tasty beer from Alaska!"
"Notes: Hell yes this is an above average ESB, borderline greatness. A bit more depth and this would be 4+. Good stuff."
"The Taste is quite good, with food that Theres a kind of sweet, almost honey like flavor from the malt, that flavor is quickly over ran by the hops, which fill the mouth smoothly. The star here is the delectable smoothness, which is kept interesting by spikes of hops and carbonation. It feels grat on the mouth."
"Poured a light amber color, nice white head and lacing down the glass. Smell is slightly malty with nice hop scent.Taste is sweet/fruity at first with a nice bitter hop aftertaste. This beer goes down very easily. Picked up a six pack of this for $3.99 at Osco Drug in Billings, MT. Not sure why it is so cheap, but I'm going to have to go back and stock up."
"Alaskan's ESB is a well-crafted and finely balanced dark amber ale with a malty, caramelish nose and similar flavor (the malt is a bit more bready than the aroma suggests) that's peppered with piney/leafy/grassy hops and backed by a brisk bitterness. The appearance is quite nice with a clear copper body that reveals gleaming orange and gold highlights beneath a creamy head of antiqued ivory. It's crisp in the mouth with a medium body; and it's balance leaves it nicely drinkable. Well done!"
"Drinkability- Very refreshing brew that I'm sure I will find myself having again in the future. Would be a good summer session beer while enjoying a camping trip."
"Thanks to blitheringidiot for getting me this one."
"Light haze in a rich amber copper body, topped by a pillowy, light sandy head. Great lacing. Nose is minerally, caramel bread malts with light butteriness, and a fragrant, resiny hop bitterness. Minerally-sweet bread malt flavor up front, light fruitiness follows, but big hop bite takes over. Hops are minty, piney, resinous, and bitter. Finish is earthy, bitter, dry, with lingering caramel fruit. Medium-bodied, with a minerally, dry feel. One of the best American ESB's I've ever had."
"Been sitting on this beer for a little bit. Its time to drink it. This beer pours a copper color with a small ring around the top. The nose is slightly citrusy, slightly dirty in the hop with a moderate caramel malty backbone. The flavor is pretty spot on with that nose, though the dirty hop may be a bit more forceful in the flavor. Everything is pretty mellow, not taste taking center stage. The feel is just shy of moderate to moderate, smooth, with a small carbonation. Not a bad beer at all. I would really find it refreshing on a warm summer day."
"Goes down easily but not much here to hold my interest."
"The drinkability is too watery for me and can be a session beer if one likes the watery feel."
"This beer pours a nice amber color with a thin white head that stays around long enough to enjoy the glass. Smell is of hops and yeasty esters. Taste is of hops than a subtle graineness. Aftertaste is all hops and lasts and lasts. A great brew thats interesting enough to keep you drinking. Cheers."
"I consider most ESB's to be food beers. By that I mean that they usually are really good compliments of spicy food but are not the greatest by themselves. This beer provides the example. I had two of these, one by itself and one with some spicy Mexican food. The flavor in this beer matched really well with the spicyness of the Mexican food. There was a spicy hop dominance in the beer which was annoying alone but good with food. The malts play a perfect role in providing flavor and holding bitterness back but yet letting the hops do their thing. The bitterness is on the light side but that only means more hop spicyness. There seems to be a bit on a acidic quality in there as well. The hops linger in here. Lots of earthy flavors underneath. This is a really well made ESB."
"I could drink more than a few of these babies. Another great brew from Alaskan Brewing Co."
"Another pleasant brew from Alaskan, I don't think they know how to make BAD beer."
"Man, I wish I had picked up a six-pack of this ESB a while ago. Alaskan has a quality brew here to go with their Smoked Porter. At least with the ESB I can get it year-round."
"A first class session brew with a dry finish and great quenching qualities. Many thanks to my buddy Pierre Archambault who lugged a 6er of this and the amber back from his expedition on the summit of Mt. McKinley."
"Poured a deep amber, one of the darkest bitter I have evere encountered head was thin but lasted nicely, good lacing was present. Nice malty and subtle hop aroma was apparent, somewhat grainy. Very smooth, nice hop pesence with solid backbone of caramel malts. Alaskan Brewing Co. was always kind of passed over by yours truly, big mistake. These beers have become a real joy to drink. Their trademark is outstanding smoothness and drinkability, and this might be the best domestic ESB out there. Get this fine ber if you ever see it."
"From a 12 ounce bottle, it pours a deep gold with a an off white head that leaves just a bit of lace. Hops dominate the smell. Malt sweetness is just noticeable under a hop bitterness that is especially pronounced at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are more or less par for the course for an ESB. Overall, it's a decent brew but nothing distinguishes it."
"The mouthfeel was slightly thin, but the beer was extremely drinkable. This would be the perfect session beer as the taste is more than interesting enough to hold your attention."
"Alaskan ESB pours a dark amber with streaks of light with really no head to speak of. The smell is a perfect blend of malts and hops and fruit tones. Taste is of fruit and caramel with a perfect balance of both malts and hops. Feels very smooth in the mouth but still doesn't have that pizazz. A very drinkable beer however, Alaskan Brewing has always impressed me."
"Nice hops aroma - floral, herbal, some oil/grapefruit. Orange-amber clear w/off-white small head. Palate is med watery w/med hi carbonation. Starts slightly sweet w/decent malts. Big hops flavor but mostly hi level of bittering. Some alcohol, bland sugar. Bitter finish & after. Refreshing."
"A darkish amber, good head retention and some sudsy lingering lace. Aroma of dark malts. This is a dark beer for a bitter, more aggressively roasty than the traditional examples. Hops are grassy and peppery and creep up on the finish leaving a sparkle in the mouth. Malts are biscuity and sweet and typical of Alaskan brews. Some wood/varnish flavors that are the low points of an otherwise very tasty brew. Mouthfeel is pretty good but maybe a little soapy. Pleasant lemony aftertaste. This isn't initally as easy drinking as some of the best bitters, but the aftertaste is very coaxing. It's a bit raw and unrefined but could be very suitable for warming the bones on a damp muddy spring day."
"Drinkability  This was much better than the Altbier attempt, but average still the same."
"Source: Liquid Solutions"
"Overall, a solid ESB."
"Light brown color, medium head. Aroma is malty and a touch sweet. Roasted malts, medium hops. There is a smokiness to this beer. Nice malty character pervades this beer. Some malt sweetness. Finish is very smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, malty with some sweetness. A very complex flavor to this beer."
"Notes: I love big malty ales with a muscular hop character, this is one of them and a perfect pairing at lunch time would be with a roast beef on rye with horseradish mayo."
"This is really one of the only brews by Alaskan that I didn't enjoy all that much. Color is a lighter amber, thin off-white head faded leaving minimal light spots of lace. Very acidic flavor and bite, bitterness should be sweet and nice, this had a taste of generic aspirin in the finish that I just didn't like. I highly doubt it was a bad batch cuz all the others I had by Alaskan were great. Had a good smell of floral sweetness and light malt but that didn't carry over in the taste department for me. I've diffenately had better ESB. But ESB's are not my forte'."
"The color on the pour is a limpid burnished copper, the head modest, frothy and the color a light beige with the lace a fine covering sheet. Nose is floral, buttery, crisp and clean, a real sniffer with the start sweet and full of malt, top is middling in feel. Finish has a delectable hop presence, acidity moderate and the aftertaste quite dry, and a real credit to the style."
"Orangish, amber in color..creamy white head...very enticing caramel dominated nose..alsso some fruity notes of apples and pears on the nose...medium bodied fruitiness strong on the buds (apples and pears again)..a bit of a spicy hop taste emerges midway through...very good ESB..not exceptional but very good"
"This beer is a nice shade of scarlet red. A small creamy beige head recedes to a thin coating in seconds. Lacing is adequate. The aroma is about half and half between piney hop notes and caramel/biscuity malt tones. This beer displays some nice balance for the style and types of hops utilized (Centennial and Cascade). Hops impart some bitterness, piney tones and some rind qualities to a lesser degree. Malt provides a beautiful underlying and balance in this beer. Although bread like and doughy at times, the malt profile is primarily caramel. And very nice. Beautiful smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is low. Drinkability is high. It's been months since I tried a beverage from Alaskan and they have picked up right where they left off (in my mind). Very good stuff."
"182"
"Another great Alaskan brew.  Hops give a great flowery aroma and extemely smooth finish.  Goes down real easy."
"A good ESB with a nice malt flavor and a flowery, fresh hop finish."
