"I was going to present a very detailed review, but I decided just to say that this is a very tasty beer and I would highly recommend it to any beer lover."

"Overall this is one of the better offerings from Real Ale, which is saying a lot.  Real Ale is an accomplished brewery with some great offerings. I would put this in their top 3."

"Dry and hoppy as heck. That was unexpected!"

"O: Not a huge fan. The smell and taste are very different. That, and it's inconsistent with the style. Better with food."

"O - This beer has an amazingly complex aroma and lots of good elements, but the flavors aren't as complex and somehow it doesn't quite hit it out of the park for me. Still, it is very drinkable and enjoyable and I wouldn't mind having it again."

"This is an updated review from a long time ago. Since then, I have reviewed many more beers, and come to appreciate the ESB style far more. I think my updated numbers reflect a better estimation of this beer. I also have come to appreciate the skill and care that RABC puts into their beers, and the delicious consistency inherent in their regular offerings. Great job RABC."

"O. Not the most unique ESB out there. But it does what it's supposed to and delivers without being overly bitter(which is what I was originally thinking). Real ale does a good job at providing consistency. They have never amazed me, but I can always count on them to always be good at providing something decent that doesn't completely break the bank. Will drink again."

"Color is copperish. This is a really good beer. The more I drink from Real Ale company, the more I am impressed. They really know what they are doing there in Blanco, Texas."
"Definitely a peculiar brew and it's one for the adventure seekers. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Pinkie's in San Angelo."

"The taste also had a lot of sugary raisin-character to it with hop balance taking over the finish. My only problem with this is that the hops taste dry. They give a dry character to an otherwise sweet beer. I like the bitter character, it just brings a little more dryness than I want. I really like the idea, though, of making an ESB that's thick and sugary. I guess that's what makes it ""double."" I was afraid it would be ""doubly"" bitter instead, and it is a little more bitter than other ESBs I've had, but not by a whole lot."

"Overall- It really comes off like an Alt. Well balanced, exceptional drinkability. It's got something of the ""imported English-y"" character, but I would expect a fresher/domestically produced beer to taste... well... fresher. It's certainly a good beer, and I hate to knock it, but it seems like (from my perspective) they are attempting to mimic the ""spent three months in an unrefrigerated cargo container"" flavor common to most import beers- I'm sure it comes down to customer expectations. That being said, it's very reasonably priced, pretty darn good, and I'll certainly pick it up again."
"Big toasted malt on first taste...some dark fruits. Bitterness lingers a bit...a bit dry too. This is certainly not what I would call a refreshing beer. A bit too dry and biscuity. I can see this being a one and done winter warmer type of beer, but not recommended for a hot day."
"Nothing to go out of your way for, but a nice enough brew. It really is like an ESB turned up a notch, though that doesn't automatically make it any better than ""good""."
""
""
""
""
"I wasn't really impressed with this as a double ESB, but what the hell do I Know."
"This was a bit of a toss-up between a 3.5 and a 4.0 overall. As this beer seems to have some decent flavor and aroma, I would imagine drinking this beer again and again would warrant the slightly higher overall score, depending on freshness and serving origin. It also hides its alcohol content nicely. A good, malty, bitter beer. I'd definitely go for some more..."

"This one had some off flavors. Really didn't enjoy it much. A below average beer in just an average style."
"a hybrid style beer from the real ale folks in texas. poured a slightly hazy orange/copper color from the 12 oz bottle. smelled like an esb with clear notes of toffee and caramel greeting the sense first. english hops lend that british fruitiness and a bit of earth rather than the dank pine or citrus from the west coast varietals. i don't detect the over 7% abv on this ale; a touch watery, if anything. finishes with lingering bitterness - a plus in my book. the phoenixx is labeled a seasonal release, but my bottle claims to be good until september of this year."
"Beer is medium in body and creamy, no bitterness but a mild hoppiness on the midpalate, there is a mild oxidation on the finish, a little papery. Interesting but I've had better ESB and don't think this is a repeat."

"O: I have always supported this beer, cause I am partial to ESBs and to beers made in Texas. I have found that if I was going to buy any real ale beer for myself, it would be this one... Fireman's four is over rated."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a nice foamy head. The aroma is sweet, fruity, light fruity hops. The flavor is smooth, spicy and light naturally fruity flavors, earthy, toasted malts, slightly hot. A great example of an English Strong Ale. I have been getting some brews in trades from Real Ale, and I have been pleasantly surprised."
""
""
"O: A semi-big malty brew. Pretty much all malt, no real noticeable hops. Toast and caramel more or less. Not bad, but nothing special either."

"O: I think this is a very solid beer. I wont say that it is an amazing beer by any means, but it is worthy."
"O: this beer seems to fall in a weird spot. there are moments that you feel like you're drinking a bock for the body, darkness, and alcohol but the taste is def. a reference to a bitter. it's worth giving a try but probably not a daily drinker for me."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style with carbonation being below average. Overall a decent beer but not a great one. The flavors just didn't come together that well for me and the malty base just seemed a little overpowering and one dimensional. Decent beer overall."
"The extra X means this stuff means business. It pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises toffee and grass. That is all. The taste holds notes of caramel, burnt grass, musty wheat, and a kinda meek snap of orange-peel bitterness. Ask m'lady sitting next to me while drinking this: my face went negative pretty quickly after this stuff was put on my tongue. Now, I don't wanna exaggerate: It wasn't god-awful, just unpleasant. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somehow nearly chewy feel. Overall, I did not have a good experience with this beer. The flavors seemed rather sideways, and everything was just too...I guess big would be the word here."
"O: Well, I'll give this one points for originality, I've never had a beer quite like this. Unfortunately it kinda ends up tasting like a watered-down porter."
"Overall this is a one and done for me. I like it but when you say double bitter I expect bitter not an IPA."
"O: Soild ESB. Would drink another."
"O: Not a whole lot going on with this one. Nothing bad about it, but for a 7.2% abv ESB, I was hoping for a bit more."
"Pours a warm ruddy brown, with a thin head that quickly recessed. Smell is of dark malts and a hint of hops. Taste starts with smooth dark malts, then in the second half if the taste I get notes of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. This I an interesting take on the ESB, but I am not sure if inwill re-visit it again."
"Overall - Interesting take on an ESB. The flavors are overwhelming in a negative sort of way. Too bitter of a finish and the malts are too burnt tasting. I get that it's a double ESB, I just don't love how it comes together."
"O - Although this is not a style a usually like, this is a great beer. I would buy and drink this again, often, if it was available here in CA."
"O - Ok, but the astringency and firm bitterness are distracting and its kind of a chore to drink this beer when it gets warm."
"The CPJ"
"D - Malty flavor and overall balanced but leaning more towards the malts than hops. Not a bad beer but not really being a fan of ESB's, I didnt have much to compare this with."
"This is an amped up ESB to be sure and I wouldn't call it terribly drinkable for the style but it more complex than most, so I would certainly recommend it."
"Notes: Phoenixx is a stellar beer of this style. Very well-balanced and full-bodied, with a complex flavor profile. I could almost mistake this beer for a session brew, despite it's ABV. A rock-solid brew, and one that I wish I had more of."
"One finger white head, fairly quick dissipation with some lacing. Reddish clear amber body, some dispersed trails of carbonation rising to surface. Big dose of crystal malt in the nose, fruity, tropical hops, some bready malts for dryness. Taste mirrors nose, though the alcohol is quite prevalent. Medium-light mouthfeel, fairly dry finish for style. Too boozy for the style and my liking, unless you are a fan of Double ESBs (not sure if such a style exists or will in the future) a novelty worth trying once, but I won't be having this again any time soon."
"Overall-This beer suprised me. Considering I haven't had an ESB in a long time and was able to really enjoy this one I applaud this beer and Real Ale. Not going to compare this to my ""A" IPAs/IIPAs, but for a reasonable ESB It's great. Nothing from Real Ale has really wowed me, including this beer, but I will absolultely drink a few more of these while they are still around."
"Overall: A pretty good beer. It's rather refreshing and has some bite."
"Drinkability is solid. Nothings bad about this at all. It doesnt wow, but it's a nice brew to sip on!"
"Apple cider in color and clarity. Fair head retention and fair amount of lace. Bready malt aroma. Flavor has elements of apples, bread crust, and hazelnuts. Medium carbonation and body. Strong non aromatic bitter back end."
"The flavors compliment the nose with balanced malts...up front malt sweetness with a balanced middle and pronounced hop bitterness at the end. The aftertaste lasts only about a minute. The carbonation is moderate-low. There is some alcohol warming, but this could be overemphasized by my empty stomach."
"D - Good balance between the hops and malt in this one. I expected less hop bitterness, but I wasn't disappointed that it was there. Only a bit of warmth to indicate its strength, which took me a little by surprise. Overall a very good tasting ESB even if it doesn't really fall inside the style guidelines."
"O: Nothing terribly bad about this beer, it was just a bit too one note for me."
"Found this at the Whole Foods here in Austin whilst visiting on business. Pours a clear dark copper/amber with a thin creamy head that left sparse lacing. To all appearance a classic English bitter. The aroma is caramel and sweet malt with a whiff of alcohol. The taste is quite unexpected the blast of hops seems to utterly overwhelm whatever malty notes one would expect based upon the aroma. The taste is cracker up front with a strong floral/vegetal hop bitterness that fades into a long dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with gentle carbonation that is barely noticable. Overall a good find and a nice way to round out the night."
"The Phoenixx pours a reddish to deeper amber colour with good white head formation. The lacing was minor but sticky. Smells of pine, grapefruit, lemon and some minor herbs. Taste is very good bitterness but not over the top. Piney, grassy, some whole grains are mixed well with the citric aspects (lemon, orange, grapefruit). The mouthfeel is medium and drying, classic ESB. A very drinkable, dry, ESB. Very nice representation of the style."
"The beer is a reddish, brown color with a thin, soapy white head. It smells of roasted caramel malt with some grassy and citrusy hop aromas. The taste is bitter and sweet with flavors of toffee, lemon and grapefruit. Phoenixx is medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation and a pleasant, lingering finish. Real Ale did good with this one, it's very balanced between the malt and hops, I could drink this all the time."
"Dark brown with orange red hues. Very thick foamy head with great retention. Lacing is good as well. In the smell there is a grapefruit bitterness along with some slightly toasted caramel malts to sweeten it up a bit. Ends pretty clean with nothing lingering. Taste is sweeter than the nose suggest. There is still the grapefruit bitterness but the toasty caramel notes come through a lot more with even more sweetness. Taste almost like an America Strong Ale just with a more toasted quality. Mouth feel is medium to full bodied with medium to high carbonation. Its a little up there but not quite. Feels good though. Not bad. Good flavors however pretty strong and with a substantial amount of alcohol. This is one that I will be picking up again next year."
"I had to remind myself that I am not reviewing a Double IPA, but an Amber( well Double Amber). So with my pallet so far to the left I had to reel it back to center and realize how good this beer is to the common non pallet wrecked man (or woman). Thanks to BgThang and turfy for this. Very enjoyable and recommended."
"Flavor wise it starts out mild with an earthy piney note then finishes with a bitter kick. It is light to medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. It has a slick quality to it and goes down easy and smooth. More of a sipper to me though, couldn't session this beer, alcohol is pretty prevalent in the taste for only being 7.2% abv."
"Medium in body, smooth and quite refreshing, I would put the drinkability as high, the alcohol feels nonexistent, pretty tasty brew."
"A totally drinkable beer in my opinion. I'm not entirely sure ESBs are the best beer style to ""double"" but I don't think this is a bad beer at all. I'm a fan of most of the Real Ale brews, and this is another solid outing by the gang in Blanco."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is a bit over medium bodied with a good deal of carbonation. Reasonably smooth drinking. Overall, it's a pretty good representation of the style. Nice herbal qualities, and probably a bit more flavorful than most due to the higher ABV."
"D - Invites for more as long as you're not under some presumption that this is a ""Double ESB""."
"Overall, I'm not a huge fan of Real Ale and this offering didn't help that impression."
"D: Awesome drinkability. Flavorful but not too filling or heavy, so it's refreshing and packs a punch at the same time."
"The body is medium with abundant carbonation. The finish is very dry, thus excellent drinkability. This was drank 3 months after the drink by date, which went against all instructions for this one. Didn't matter, it was still excellent. I would love to try it brewery fresh."
"Very hazy, deep copper color on the pour. A quarter-inch white head dissipates pretty quickly and leaves little to no lacing. Caramel and toffee aromas fill the nose and not much else. The alcohol is barely noticeable in the smell as well. The flavor has a little more depth with the strong caramel malt sweetness gaining balance from a dry graininess and toasty malt. The alcohol is pretty well-hidden. Not a whole lot going on here. Medium-bodied with a creamy texture. Finish is moderately sweet with only a hint of alcohol warming. Lack of complexity or anything really interesting keeps this from a high drinkability score. That said, it is easy on the palate, the alcohol is well-hidden, and there's nothing offensive about it. Overall, just a forgettable beer."
"This was the bartenders favorite beer. Very simlare to Left Hands Chainsaw. This is a winter seasonal so it's nearly 8 months old. Copperish red in color and lots of hop flavors still lingered. nice and balanced. Very nice beer."
"D. Smooth and refreshing. Without knowing the abv, I would definitely consider this a sessionable beer. With the abv, it becomes a refreshing afternoon beer."
"good product this being one of their better ones."
"D - This beer is way better to me on cask over CO2 the flavor profile changes in a way for the better and you just can't beat the mouthfeel that cask conditioning gives a must try if you see it on cask"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a good sessionable beer that is a little stronger than your normal session beer."
"D: Above average considering the ABV. I enjoyed the beer and would certainly be interested in another."
"I do not try ESB very often, but imperial ESB? I will try that. Thanks to Mar for adding this as an extra. Copper in color, with about a half inch of white heading, this looks like a rustic type. Nice hop profile comes through in the nose, along with some sweet grains and light fruit. The malt is more forward in the taste, and steps forward to overpower the hops a bit. Besides that, there is some good biscuit like flavors, and a bit of pear too. Mouthfeel is on the medium side, and really does not taste boozy at all. If you told me that this was a regular ESB alcohol wise, I would have believed you, so kudos to the, for hiding the higher ABV so well. Good stuff here from Real Ale. Cheers"
"D - Like it. I would session this without tiring."
"Decent beer but a little pricey ($9.50/sixer)."
"I thought that this was an amazingly balanced beer."
"D- The drinkability of this is amazing. It went down very smooth and the alcohol was very well hidden drinking like a 4% beer. I would recommend this to everyone to try...as I will be looking for this one again."
"Thanks to Mora2000 for this ""extra special"" brew!"
"drinkability: very refreshing. big crisp hop flavor with a high session abv that is perfectly masked. this beer fits many occasions."
"Poured into a pint glass brownish red with a one finger white head. Good retention and great lacing all the way down the glass. Smells strong of green hops. The taste is much the same as you get a hop bite upfront. It is well balanced and mellows out as other flavors roll over your tounge. The mouthfeel is perfect, making this another Real Ale seasonal that I wish were a year rounder. I can't wait for their next bottled seasonal."
"This is interesting on cask. A little more depth of flavor here than in the bottle or on tap. Though the under carbonation almost kills this beer. Not bad, but Real Ale has much better cask versions."
"Brown pour with a nice finger of persistent head. Aroma is light earthy hops on top of a bed of biscuit maltiness. Some nuttiness and sunflowers are also present. The flavor is bitter nuttiness. I'm not sure on the age of this but the hops are not very well defined right now. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with high levels of soft carbonation. Drinkability is solid if you are wanting to have a lighter beer with a meal, but as a standalone beer there isn't too much interesting going on. Still, a good example of the style."
"Thanks, ericandersnavy, for the opportunity"
"Drinkability: While I'm not sure why Real Ale label it as a ""Double ESB," Phoenixx is solid, friendly, and easily drinkable. I'm looking forward to seeing more of their seasonals show up in bottles."
"Drink ability is good. Semi sessionable, alcohol was hidden nicely. Wouldn't say that this is a run of the mill ESB but its nothing to write home about. Still nice to see more good beer coming out of Texas in bottles. Just wish more breweries would distribute outside the state."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1/4"" beige head above the clear orangey amber brew. Head holds on alright, with average lacing. Aroma is moderately sweet, with a touch of vegetal. Taste starts malty, a peek of citrus in the middle, and then bitterness comes on, and keeps on keeping on. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Wouldn't mind having this one again."
"I am going to have to try another one. I think this was somehow a bad batch. I like Real Ale products, but this was just sub par for them."
"Highly recommend this beer. I'm glad I listened to the clerk at Wheatsville Coop in Austin (where i bought this beer). His recommendation was spot on."
"this is a good beer that i would probably drink again. i wouldn't buy a 6 pack, but i might pick up another single before they stop selling them for the year."
"Overall this is a good beer, not sure I would consider it a Double ESB, nothing seemed amped up to me to warrant that label, but it was a good refreshing drink."
"Taste is similarly hoppy, and I found just a little watery grain in the finish. Phoenixx is medium-bodied, well-carbonated, and dries the mouth in its bitterness. I'm left a little disappointed not because the beer was awful, but because I wanted more caramel-malt goodness from this ESB, and less of an American pale ale."
"Overall I loved this beer and I think Real Ale is putting out some solid brews here in TX."
"Malts come out to play more in the flavor, plenty sweet and somewhat toasty. Still a hop-forward beer though. Grassy and citric, as lime peel and wheatgrass juice come to mind. There are some chalky, mineral flavors as well as a light fruitiness that give it a bit of British feel to it, but the hops seem to be copiously added in true American spirit. The bitterness on the finish is particularly bold...resinous and long-lasting. A bit over-the-top compared to most ESBs, but I guess that what they were aiming for with the 'double'. I prefer mine more on the sessionable side, still a fun beer to try though."
"M/D: Kind of thin and watery. It is unlike any other ESB I've had where I got more of a fruity flavor. A rare 'miss' from Real Ale."
"D - another pretty impressive beer from Real Ale. felt that it needed half a point bonus for great complexity and balance, something a lot of ESB's struggle with. quite enjoyable."
"D - Extremely drinkable, with a nice hoppy finish. This could replace their Rye Pale Ale or the Coffee Porter as my favorite beer."
"Overall it reminded me a lot of an aged big hoppy monster. Just that super sweet, and dripping caramel flavor malt that balances it so well. Would love to have this one again any day."
"D-Very drinkable. I highly recommend this beer. I was suprized and expecting something dissapointing but got a wonderful beer."
"D- Overall this beer underwhelmed me."
"D - Well, I finished the pint fairly quickly and enjoyed it, but I was ready to try something else. The alcohol feels and tastes stronger than it really is. My palate was pretty skewed, which is something to keep in mind if this is not your last drink of the night."
"As far as drinkability goes, I would say this is a sessionable beer, but I would rather have something with a little more ""oomph!"""
"Excellent beer from Real Ale. Too bad it's a limited released. This supplants their Rye as a favorite bottled offering, for me."
"D: A very well done brew and quite drinkable for an ESB. Kudos to Real on this one."
"Dark for an ESB. Nice head, dark malts in the nose with some hop love too. Aroma and taste are very similar, mild chocolate notes with raisins and faint toffee. Worsens as it warms and becomes borderline unpleasant. Average mouthfeel, nothing special or standout. Lacking compared to other fine examples, what do you expect from a mediocre Texas Brewery trying to brew a European classic? Good beer overall, nothing to seek out."
"I've been waiting to try this beer, so I was excited to finally find it at the Central Market in Ft Worth. Pours with a dark amberish color, almost brown. The head was fizzy, very light, and it dissipated quickly.. faster than I expected anyways. It smells nice, a good blend of the hops and malts. Nothing too fancy. At first I wasn't a big fan. I had a few the other night and didn't appreciate the taste, but after giving it a second chance and writing this review it has grown on me. I've always loved supporting Real Ale and I've enjoyed both of their seasonal beers so far. I can't wait to see what is next."
"I cant wait for next years!"
"Pours a copperish color with a white head. The aroma is hops with some toffee and biscuit malt. The flavor is earthy hops along with caramel malt and toffee. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Another good seasonal beer from Real Ale that was recently released in bottles for the first time."
"MF/D: Certainly a ""session"" brew, Phoenixx comes up a bit short on body for me."
"Overall, a decent beer. Not nearly as bitter as some ESBs I've had."
"Good effort, but unfortunately it falls short. Oh well, at least the packaging is kick ass."
"As for the taste, the hops were ripe-tasting and juicy, almost as if this were a fresh hop beer. Nice balance of toasted caramel and toffee malts with fruity yeast esters and a hint of that medicinal-ESB twang that added some pep to the finish. The medium body is perfectly carbonated and quite smooth given the style, making for an easy drinking ESB. Real Ale is churning out some excellent beer these days, and the seasonal offerings (Real Heavy, Lost Gold IPA, and now Dbl Phoenixx) are all worth seeking out."
"D: Happily, this is produced locally. Sadly, it is not bottled and a seasonal effort at that. I like this beer. There are better in the style, to be sure, but still a strong effort."
"decently balanced big esb. give it a try"
"Pours a medium brown colored body, clearish with a big creamy off-white head. Hoppy grapefruity aroma, very bitter and dry smelling. Creamy, hoppy bitter dry taste. Some strawberry maltiness too. Letting it warm up a bit for some more flavor...Some more flavor. Not too bad. Much more flavor. No aftertaste, it just fades."
"A very good ESB in my opinion and something I'd order several pints of in an evening."
"Overall, exactly as advertised. An ESB with more malt and hops but still within the style. Real Ale, you've made another excellent beer."
"On tap at the draught house. Pours a dark maroon color with a medium beige lasting head. Nice looking beer. Smell is fruity, hoppy, gummy, with big hop presence for the style. Not what I expected from something called an ESB or labeled as an ESA. Either way, extremely drinkable, fruity and hoppy but smooth with alcohol hidden well. Very nice beer."
"I went to the brewery and tried all the beers. This one stuck out the most from my trip. It had a wonderful hop infused taste. It wasn't hoppy enough to blow my socks off, but the blend of hops and amber malts was great. The aroma had a hop and carmel smell. Overall, I would not hesitate to buy the Phoenix again or order it at a pub. I even bought a T-shirt of the beer after the tour!"
"Not impressed at the start, but it improved considerably as the temperature increased. Nice balance, would drink again."
"Pours an orange copper color with a creamy white head that fades into a sticky lace. Nose is dominated by fresh grassy hops along with a bit of a sweet nuttiness. Taste begins with some toasted malts, but the hops are the key players. However, the hops present themselves in a very earthy mannermore so than in just about any beer I can remember trying. This beer definitely improves as it warmsin fact, near room-temperature is ideal."
"one you'd repeat in the same night."
"Had this one on tap at the Flying Saucer in Fort Worth. Poured a murky brown into a 22 oz glass with a tenacious 1.5 finger head. The aroma was mainly of the hops, with some undertones of hazelnut and caramel. Taste was nice and bitter, heavy on the hops, with a malty toffee-like sweetness balancing the bitter, floral hops. There was some hint of a roasted-nut twinge to it. Mouthfeel was a bit phenolic, with a little bit of bite from the alcohol. Drinkability was average, meaning that it was worth a try, but not worth another round."
"Mouthfeel is medium, clean with a bitter hop aftertaste. Good, if you like this style, but too dry to really session and strays far from a traditional ESB drinkability. Labeled as a ""Double ESB," whatever that may mean."
"Served on-tap at the Addison Flying Saucer. Dark copper pour with a sturdy beige head that lasted throughout the pint and left a little lace. Smell is light hops with a smidge of sugars and alcohol peeking through. Starts off malty and goes right into a gentle hop bitterness that lasts through a sufficiently extended finish. Medium body and a very drinkable ESB. One of the few of this style that I would gladly return to. This has some character."
"The lastest offering from Real Ale and a new selection on-tap at the Gingerman in Houston. Not sure what a ""Double"" ESB is. It was an amber colour in the glass and rather cloudy. Thick, sandy coloured head that lasted a long a long time and left a lot of lacing in the glass. Aroma was light, but grassy and floral. The flavour was very earthy, it reminded me of wet cork. The finish was dry and bitter, but those earthy tones carried over into a lingering aftertaste."
"This is one for hopheads that aren't too concerned about balance between the hops and the malt. The bitterness overtakes the beer, but it is satisfying, nonetheless. The grassy and floral characteristics carry through from the first sip and into the long finish."
