"Very nice ESB. Pours a copper color. Moderate bitterness with a balanced toasted malt flavor with a hint of citrus. Mildly bitter aftertaste. Pleasant and enjoyable. I will buy it again."

"Best by date was 2 years old, but still not that bad."
"Pours a crystal clear dark amber with a medium beige head with good lacing. Aroma of citrus, orange and floral hops fill the nose. Taste is citrus and orange undertones, with good amount of caramel malt as it warms up followed by floral and earthy hops bitterness on the end for balance, A medium body, smooth with moderate carbonation. The finish slowly mellows out to a flavorful caramel malt, a bit of orange peel, some grains followed by some good floral earthy hops bitterness for balance and a bit of a nutty flavor as well. Overall a good, tasty and enjoyable brew."
"Rating as 3.5 for now, but hope to find a fresh one at some point and do a re-review."

"BOD 9/1/13. Pours a clear medium amber with a slight ruby cast. Very nice well formed head with lacing that retains well. The slight nose is sweet citrus fruit (mango and orange) and caramel over a biscuit sweetness. The body is almost medium with a smooth texture that approaches a slight slickness. Normal carbonation with little effervescence. The flavor profile is well balanced. It begins with slight citrus sweetness, progresses to caramel and biscuit sweetness and finishes with a nice mild bitterness. The finish is more smooth than crisp and leaves a nice herbal bitterness."

"Overall: A really nice, well-balanced ale. I've come to appreciate Goose Island for their balance and subtlety (rather than nailing you over the head with expeditious, overpowered concoctions), and this ale doesn't disappoint. Extremely tasty hop-malt balance, and easy to drink; I could knock these back all night."
"O: This is like an IPA in training. If there was ever a hopheads session beer, this would be it. I like this beer quite a lot for straddling the divide and leaning toward the hoppy end of the ESB/ English pale ale style. Like it a lot."
""
"If it had been labeled as an IPA, that would've been a good description, and I'd say it meets the same chemical after- twinge as the majority of mass-produced average IPAs."
"Easy drinking, spicily hopped. Give it a try."
""
"overall: I thought that this beer was an excellent offering. Lots of good hops aroma, flavor, and with a sweet malty body to keep it all together. A easy 4.25/5, and personally give it a 91/100. Hope that the rest of goose Islands stock beers can come out like this."
"O - I've had Harvest Ale before from Goose Island, but I don't remember it being this good. I really appreciate the classic take on classic styles. While Goose Island can blow you away with some of their more creative ales they also really do extremely well crafting great beer in the somewhat forgotten styles. Harvest Ale is perfect for the Fall season and I am almost greatly appreciative that we get a wider variety of Goose Island brews here at home. Ill buy a pack of this every single Autumn. It's one of the best ESB's ever created. No more to say. Try it"
""
""
"This is a good beer from Goose Island and while not much like other Harvest ales, it is still good in its own way. The body is medium and the beer is easier- drinking than other examples of its style, which are often a little too bitter. Goose Island Harvest succeeded in locating a good balance for this style and it is easily one of the brewery’s better products."

"The Verdict: Not bad. A well balanced beer that goes along well with a crisp fall day. A good solid brew."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 8/2/2013. Bit of a gusher upon opening. Pours lightly cloudy orange copper color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, toast, biscuit, floral, light pine, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with decent strength. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, toast, biscuit, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, floral, toast, biscuit, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt and hop flavors; with a very nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good ESB style. Good balance of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Overall an extremely well-balanced example of the style. Very nice hop profile, slightly atypical of the style, with a great clean malt bill. Wish I had more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a very good beer."
""
""
"Pours out to a rocky head that retains well and leaves some bits of lace; brilliant copper-orange color. Aroma is bread and jam, floral/citrusy hops and caramel malt. Flavor is balanced and refreshing, with toasty, biscuity malts perfectly balanced with citrusy/earthy hops. Pleasant alpha acid finish. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is right for style, but it seems a bit rough on tongue. Good everyday ESB."

"overall; fantastic, tasty, well built, awesome. This is as good a beer as I have ever had."
"It's one of my seasonal favorites because of it's price and accessibility. A verb solid and approachable esb."
""
""
"First time I have seen this out west. Nice clean copper color with less than one finger of white head. Some spots of lace. Spells grainy with a touch of hop aroma. Small amount of malt for an ESB but the hops lean forward in this brew. Medium dry bitter finish. The brewed on date was Sept. 15 so about 7 weeks old. I may change some of the review points when I have finished the sixer. Overall an interesting and tasty brew but lacking in the malt department for the style."
"Overall this is an okay harvest ale, nothing bad but nothing really blows me away."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I will be getting more of this while I can. Again, a really nice ESB."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty decent beer. A little, no, a lot more hoppy than I was expecting, and even prefer. Hop heads should like this beer quite a lot, but I’m not crazy about it. I’m glad I had it, but I probably won’t get it again."

"OVERALL: An average to good harvest ale that provides enough hop flavor to keep things interesting."
""
""
""
"Overall this isn't a bad beer. If I was rating strictly to style, it'd be much worse, so pass if you're looking for a traditional ESB. With that said, it's worth a shot. Very well-balanced and drinkable, but nothing special."
"Overall: I was surprised by the “Very Good” rating, even though I agree it is indeed “Very Good”, because it’s an Anheuser-Busch product produced at their Baldwinsville, NY plant and unfortunately that sometimes skews people ratings. This, however is not an adjunct lager by any means. Its tasty & put together well. Not mind blowing, but decent. You need to try this as proof that a Macro can actually make good beer if they just try. Thanks Mike for the great fall offering."

" The taste is great, lots of herbal, piney hop flavors meld well with the mild caramel from the malt with a nice mild caramel accent lending a balanced quality with the slight grapefruit essencefrom the hops, mild spice and mellow fruitiness from the yeast. I really enjoy this style and even though this may be more intense the usual for the style it is still highly drinkable and enjoyable beyond my expectations."
""

"O- Overall, Goose Island created a great seasonal here. This one screams fall and is a great beer to enjoy as the weather begins to change."

"Pours a dark copper tone with a finger-width beige head. Notes of grains, floral hops, and touch of metallic notes on the finish. Crisp and clean. Easy on the palate, nothing to note really here. Nice dry bittering flavor start this off, typical for the style. Light fruity quality, some semi-sweet grains, with a lingering bitter pull on the palate at its finish. Nice simple beer here, that's a decent break away from the typical Marzens of the fall."

"Brewed and bottled by Goose Island Beer Co. in Baldwinsville, NY??? Okay, I guess they are doing some contract brewing in Baldwinsville, NY or AB is brewing at one of their locations to increase production. Regardless the beer in this bottle is good so far, here's some more details. Beautiful copper bronze body forms thick with a light tan head slightly off white head, fine speckled layered lacing forms on the sides of my nonic pint glass. Aroma has citric, herbal/earthy notes that smell great, along with a crisp malt heavy backbone, giving perfect balance to my first few sniffs. Striking fresh hop flavor flows freely through with each sip leaving a nice smooth level of bitterness on each palate starts citric earthy finishes with a bit of spice/mint combo held together with amber roasted specialty grains. Under 8 bucks a sixer and readily available now due to the AB distribution network. I was nervous to try this seasonal because the 12 packs brewed in NY were not matching up this summer, this however shows promise for future endeavors and specialty releases not brewed in Chicago. The Oktoberfest I get in Ohio says brewed and bottled in Chicago, IL it's stellar this year, I haven't had one brewed in Baldwinsville, NY to compare. Mouthfeel is dead on smooth even carbonation slightly slick hop oils glide across the palate, this pairs well with pizza, meat and cheese trays, steaks, and just about anything a very versatile well brewed Harvest Ale (ESB) that should be sessioned and enjoyed by all. Price point is right, quality is on par it's going to be a great stand by this fall season."
"Great stuff. Passed on the sixer for weeks now, and I'm hoping they still have some left."
""

"Enjoyed this beer but, in my opinion, acts and feels more like an I.P.A."
"Pours out a copper body with not much head. Smell a lot of crystal malt; a lot of toast. Pretty big citrus hit in the nose. Taste is light in the malt flavor but fairly heavy on the sweetness. There's some good balancing bitterness, but the citrus and herbal combination of the hops kind of clashes. Carbonation is pretty prickly. The big sweetness and fairly jarring bitterness doesn't work for me in this."
""
""
""

"Autumn amber in color with a fizzy sticky 2 finger head that settles to a sticky soapy foam on top. Citrus and floral aromas. Wonderful balance between hops and malts in the flavor. I don't know why I love this beer so much. Nothing really stands out but it's the perfect combination of flavors that make this beer great for any season. Nice crisp mouth feel. Overall great beer where one is simply not enough. Great session beer to welcome the fall season."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great fall beer. Definitely would have again."
"Hard to know exactly why, but this beer does remind me of fall. It just has the look and overall character of a fall beer. It does go down pretty easy, although is a little on the hoppy side for my tastes. There is enough balance to keep the hops from overwhelming the taste, reminds me a bit of a toned down IPA. Not a bad beer, but with my personal tastes, would prefer a bit more malt and a little less hops."
""

"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, tea, citrus, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and slight floral flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty and very easy to drink."
""
""
"Not a bad brew to welcome cool autumn with!"
""
""
""
""
"O: A fresh take on autumn brews, and done pretty well. Everything is balanced pretty well, and the that undefinable something in the aroma is both intriguing and intoxicating. Just not sure how well it matches this time of year (I think warm spices/malts, not hops). Maybe pick up a case and age it til mid June??"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale starts out with promise but ultimately falls short. Despite a nice balance of malts and hops, the overall flavor isn't very intriguing and I feel ready to move on to something else before I've even finished the glass."
""
"O: I'd like some more of a malt backbone in this beer. It's comes off as a too light in malt flavor with a little too much hop bitterness because of it. However it is easy drinking. A good beer, it's just not amazing."
""
"O. It tastes very similar to a regular Goose Island IPA, with just a hint of an burnt autumn taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall –Some roast, some sweet and some hop all melding very nicely. A rather enjoyable ESB."
""
""
"A solid harvest ale, although not as hop-centric as I would personally choose. Bottle pours a beautiful clear coppered amber colour that near glows. It has a respectable off-white head that lingers for a respectable length of time. Aroma is malt-forward, as suitable for the listed ESB style, although not what I'd hoped for in an American ""harvest ale"". It has a decent caramelized malt graininess and breadth. The flavour also showcases the malt spectrum with a bittering hop presence that lingers into the finish. Few of the citrus or tropical fruit hop notes for which I'd hoped, but still a decently bitter beer."
""
"o: This is a very enjoyable beer that goes down easy. Worth checking out."
""
"Overall fine for what it is and it is a very light tasting esb which makes for easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A ver nicely balanced mild, wonderful British malt character with a nice splash of American hops. As a prior reviewer says, would go great with a meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This beer is a bold hybrid American amber ale that manages to cultivate some traditional English qualities. Appropriately malt-focused, it is unapologetic in the way it does not try to subdue or conceal the full force of its flavor qualities. While repetitive by itself, this beer would be good company for a savory meal."

"The only knock is in the body. A bit watery before developing a seriously sticky coating of the upper palate and back of the tongue. Medium bodied at best, lightly effervescent, slightly drying with a citrusy note in the aftertaste that is quite appealing. Good stuff."

"O: A really nice Fall seasonal: malty and yet slightly hoppy and crisp and perfect for the changing of the seasons; yet another dandy by GI"

"Goose Island Harvest Ale ---3/5"
""
""

"Would I buy this beer again? Maybe."
""

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a nice frothy head which lasted, was tan in color with good lacing. Color was a clear copper / amber hue and aroma was malty and sweet. Taste was malty and sweet with caramel notes. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with the aftertaste having a hoppy, slightly bitter, character."
""
"O- Its a good beer, but nothing special. I'd pick a lot of other seasonal beers over this."
""
""
""
""
"O/D: Something that can get a nice hop fix with an ABV under 6.00%. For a widely distributed beer, it's a good six pack to pick up and drink for the day/evening."
""
""
""
""
"This Harvest Ale could easily make for a session beer as long as one takes their time. It is also a better alternative during a tailgate party."
""
""
""
"This is a very drinkable beer. You get a decent amount of maltiness in the Harvest. There isn't a lot of complexity going on. This would be a good choice for an Oktoberfest party."
""
"Overall: 2.5/5 I was very unimpressed, maybe I just had an old bottle but the beer was very bitter and was not well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is clear amber orange with a one finger white head. The nose doesnt do much for the beer but does light compliment the taste. The beer is quite hop forward for an ESB. A bit of pine and pineapple. An abundance of lemon and lemongrass flavors from the hops. The malt backbone is non offensive and rather light. Its quite sugary and has a slight bit of grainyness. Overall, this is decent fresh hop ale. Doesnt stick out from the rest but will make for a fine drinking brew for a nice price."
"The beer is transparent and copper hued with a thin, tan head. The aroma brings biscuity malt, caramel, subtle alcohol and spice. The flavor is ok. Some bitterness from the hops, with a sturdy malt bill leading the way. Residual bitterness with a hint of pine. It certainly tastes English in style, but I do prefer most Brit offerings to this. Lacking the delectable character and drinkability I look for in a fairly low abv beer. Overall, this is ok, but I don't see myself having it again."
""
"O: Very easy to drink and sessionable - there are some very enjoyable notes of hops along with the toasted malts. A nice fall seasonal beer."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tall 500ml glass. Pours a nice red amber with a small white head. Smells of dark roasted malt with hints of caramel and choco. Really pleasant taste, a little dark roasted malt but also some nice hop bite. Beer is perfectly carbonated for its light body and finishes really well. Overall an excellent beer."

"Over all, good not great. Easy drinking and would make for a good sixer to drink on a fall day watching football."
""
""
"I wouldn't but this one again, but mainly because I'm not a fan of bitter beers in general. For those of you that are, this is probably a nice, mild one."
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would like to drink it again and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a highly flavorful, highly drinkable fall brew. Superb balance between the hops and malt. Session-able. Pick some up!"
""
""
""
""
"O- I think this is my first ESB and while it isn't a style that blows me away, I could see drinking this offering again."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied, but drinks really easy."
"o: an above average ESB, but I would have liked a bit more body and a smoother finish."
"O) This is a pretty decent brew, but honestly not one I would go out of my way for in the fall. There are just so many excellent brews this time of year, which of course is a good thing. This is kind of middle of the pack."
""
""
""
"A hazy, amber ale that pours with a light, fluffy head. It has fruity nose with some orange in particular and maybe a touch of candied ginger. I love the fresh, leafy Cascade hoppiness of this ale. I love how the candy corn sweetness mixes with fruitiness imparted by the yeast and citrus and pine hoppiness. This beer starts out hoppy and ends hoppy, but with a hard candy dollop of sweetness right at the end. A hoppy ESB, but not that bitter, at just 38 IBUs."
"O: A very well-done harvest ale by Goose Island. I'm looking forward to trying this every year now that DC gets Goose Island distro."
""
"O=One I would drink again, with the proper accompanying food. The more that I drink this, the more that I want pretzels."
"O: I'm taken aback by how sweet this beer is. As an ESB, this is a pretty disappointing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not what I was expecting but overall not a bad beer. Just a little bitter for my tastes but still good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is an excellent fall beer. The slight bitterness adds just the right amount of bite to the malty profile. It is also one of the nicest beers I have seen presentation wise, I am almost finished with the glass and it still has a nice cap. Overall worth at least trying, especially before it gets too cold outside."
""
""
""
"As a session beer, this would easily suffice even though it's a bit strong to be categorized as one. This won't blow anyone over but like so many of Goose Island's other offerings, it's nice to have this available in my neck of the woods. It's a welcome change from the other Fall beers that are currently available."
""
"O: I enjoyed this brew a lot more than I expected to. It combines features of earthy hops, lightly toasted and caramel malts and bready, biscuity flavors in a highly balanced whole. Freshness I'm sure plays a role, but great beer all the same."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to pound down for a long time."
""
""
""
"Overall, not anything that I was expecting, but also, that was part of what made it unique and enjoyable. Lots of other harvest ales I'd rather have, but this one definitely occupies its own place in harvest ale history."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice, tasty ESB. Hits all the marks for the style. A winner from Goose Island, and another one of those beers that amazes me with its availability and consistency. Great choice for a fall seasonal. I love that I can buy it in a 12-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium, smooth, a bit fizzy but nothing to whine about."
"Overall, a little disappointed. Maybe if I had it fresher the hops would be more prominent. Not a terrible beer, but a let down and not really my style."
""
""
"Decent head and pours well. Appearance is nice and taste is good. Hoppy with a fair finish. For an autumn harvest ale it ranks in the middle of the road. The flavor is good and it is not too heavy. A good beer to drink with good barbecue or steak. Goose Island did well with this beer overall"
""
""
""
""
"O-Too malty for my taste, the hops very nice but the malt was too much."
""
"Medium bodied with a decent balance of earthy hops and sweet malt. The hop presence is stronger than the aroma suggests with a crisp, spicy hop bite that provides some lingering dry bitterness. This is countered by caramel malt sweetness and a touch of buttery diacetyl before a slightly dry finish. There's nothing really wrong with this beer but I found if pretty boring and mediocre."
""
"Overall, a decent, if not forgettable harvest beer. It's a good brew to down a sixer of on a late September Friday night on the deck. Nothing to wow me, but nothing offensive."
""
""
"O: it’s a decent brew, nothing to brag about. It has a nice balance of subtle characters in both the nose and the taste so if your looking for something that is more dynamic this might not be the one for you. However, it is a nice introductory brew to the fall-season brews for those who are just staring out in the craft/micro brew world."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite good."
""
""
"O: The ABV keeps it out of sessioning range, but this is a good ""pair with food"" or ""drink a six pack because you have nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon, damnit"" kind of beer. Don't expect anything mindblowing, but it's incredibly solid nonetheless."
""
""
""

""

"QUITE GOOD, WORTH GRABBING SOME!"

"A lot of English maltiness going on. Has a dry hopped sort of taste. Somewhat astringent but not too much. Decent beer but nothing to get excited about."
"A deep burnt copper color with a very sturdy white layer of bubbles on top and respectable lacing. The aroma sends a pleasant malt sweetness, brown bread and mild grass hops. The flavor follows suit with a slightly skunky herbal hopped malt with a nutmeg-turnip spice. It’s medium-light bodied with a smooth yet tingly feel. Finely carbonated and finishing with a delicate hint of dryness, this is a very drinkable spicey sort of ESB with a tasteful hop edge. A great fall treat for the long haul."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Close to two fingers of loose, frothy foam, mild dimpling as it settles down, strong retention across the surface, the lacing is not very broad, however, displays good stickiness. Clear copper brown in color with a few trace bubbles lazily rising, more of a yellow cast around the rims. In the nose you get pretzel dough, salt and miscellaneous bread crust then honey, cocoa malts, peach pits and lemon rinds, oddly neither sweet nor grassy, like it doesn’t want to commit to a specific direction, slightly better than average staying power. Medium-bodied, its firmness creates additional palate presence. Malts, cocoa, caramel, honey yet not that sweet, the carbonation is subtle but effective, scrubs the tongue well. The lemon citrus brings out more earthiness and likely more pit aspect to the apricot, peach, apple, fig fruit. The well baked bread never a major factor, just one of many drying elements. Leaves you wishing it showed more exuberant personality, not that it’s playing it safely but you just sense it could have been more complex with some effort."
""
"O: A good fall beer that falls under the category of an easy fall drinker that isn't either an octoberfest or pumpkin beer. Solid"
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, deep, burnt orange coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white colored head. Aromas of pumpkin sweetness, both rich and creamy, with some very subtle spicing to accent. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg spicing that doesn't come anywhere close to cleaning this thing up. Tangy, bitter overtones throughout, with a touch of hops in the background. This beer is getting more muddled the more I drink. Unbalanced aftertaste, as well, with a roasty, spiced, and cloyingly sweet character. Slick, slightly bitter finish, but there is a filmy sweetness that lingers behind. Not good."
""
"O: A pleasant ESB brewed with citrusy American hops with what was probably fresh, wet hops. The astringency might be avoided by using a high alpha hops. This was brewed by AB because I know Goose Island didn't build a brewery there but it looks like Goose Island still has a good hold on controlling the recipe as it's a pretty good beer but not as good as I'd expect from them."
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, crisp and slick on the tongue. It's nice to see something other than some sort of pale ale during the harvest season, although this was barely above average for me."
""
"This poured out as a clear looking deep orange color, the head was an average size and white in color. The retention was pretty good on this beer as well as the lacing in the beginning, not much nearing the end of the beer. The smell of the beer is nicely balanced between malts and hops. Some caramel notes in there too. The taste of the beer has a moderate roasted sweetness up front that finishes bitter. The mouthfeel of the beer was a little over carbonated I think, the beer was still very drinkable though. Overall I think the bitterness was a little too high but all in all it's still a solid brew."
""
"o: very well balanced, not much for aroma and flavor, but very drinkable none the less."
"Slightly soapy at first. Sour citric fruit on the tip of the tongue. Touch of banana strangely. Cinnamon raised bread with touches of caramel, some toasted grain. Very balanced and smooth but the flavors dont all meld together, layers of strangeness that aren't offensive but just dont seem to work. Full body, interesting but i just feel the flavors aren't melding properly."

"O/D-A bit let down, I think I was expecting too much here. Its very, very solid, but I wanted a bit more hop variety and intensity. Still, I am not upset but my purchase of a 6-pack."

"Neither the malts nor the hops really jumped out, but rather coexisted so that there was a balance of flavors. It was nice, but I would have liked a little more flavor."

"overall: different take on a harvest beer, malt elements are there with the hops and bitters of an ale, well balanced and very drinkable."

"Very good offering."
"Notes: Goose Island's Harvest Ale proves not all fall seasonals are sprinkled with pantry spices."
"Overall: I am a big fan of Goose Island and this one is very good. The beer definitely reminds of autumn and has nice flavors that are balanced well."
"I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. It's a hoppier take on a harvest ale compared to what I've experienced from other breweries. I'd enjoy having this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with high carbonation. A little bite on the tongue with each sip. Overall, a decent brew, fairly drinkable, but nothing that is overly impressive or blows me away."
"Not a bad brew. I was expecting more of the butterscotch and leathery traits I find in most English versions of the ESB genre."
"It is interesting from Goose Island who I find to be right on in specific styles and miss with others. Too bad they are macro now."
"Poured into my new Lagunitas mason jar. Small topping of off-white head fizzles down slowly but sticks on the glass with each sip. Deep copper hues in the body of the ale. Aromas are piney hops, herbal and a far away backdrop of caramel malt. I was hoping the hops would dominate in flavor here, and they most definitely do. Bready malt is present just enough to balance out the herbal smack of hops, and the toasted biscuit really comes out with a bit of warmth. Medium mouthfeel. This is a good beer, and I'd definitely have another. Sometimes, ""less than great"" hits the spot."
"This is a real nice Bitter. Brings some very good depth and flavor on both the aromas and flavors with a nice toffee finish"
"O: Not a bad ESB. The flavor was better than the aroma, however."
"Tastes well-balanced, with a biscuity malt profile at first, followed by a hoppy, sharp bitter finish. Very good, and a welcome break from the usual Fall Marzen/Oktoberfest styles."
"This one reminds me a lot of zombie dust I have to say. Less hops goes without saying but they have similar bodies, mouth feels, and they both have a clean change from the hops to the malt profiles. Certainly different flavors but very similar drinking experiences."
"O: This is a great beer. It is a must-buy for me every season."
"O - This beer is good. Refreshing and tasty. Very simple yet well made."
"O- A decent beer that is drinkable but nothing too great. There are many other fall seasonal beers I prefer."
"*Paired with an Armand's Chicago style, combo pizza"
"The body is medium and the mouthfeel more smooth and creamy than crisp, though there is a touch."
"M/O: Very dark and crisp carbonation. Filling but not overpowering. Great for the time when the temperature lowers and the leaves are falling."
"Pours a nice orange/brown color w/ a two finger off white head. Decent carbonation and good lacing. Nose is malt, hops, bread, caramel. Slightly bitter taste, and the taste goes along with the nose profile. Very nice- especially for the style taste wise. Feel is a little off to me, thus the 3.5.... Overall, this is a beer that knows what it's supposed to be. It's decent, but I probably won't look for this one again."
"Notes: This is another classic example of a traditional English ale by Goose Island. Medium bodied and flavorful, yet well-balanced and quite easy to drink. This is a beer that fits the season."
"Overall: For a fall beer....I was expecting a Marzen. Surprised to get a slap of hop bitterness. I now see this is supposed to be an ESB. It is OK but nowhere near my favored Fullers ESB. I prefer the English version, I suppose."
"O: overall good brew for the style, I like the lower intensity and good drinkability."
"Overall a decent beer. I was disappointed to see it was an ESB and not a wet-hopped pale ale but for the style, it exceeded my expectations. A beer to drink really any time but definitely has me pumped up and wanting ""typical"" harvest ales."
"Cheers, Goose Island (InBev?) you nailed another one."
"Overall a pretty good ESB"
"Poured a hazy amber-brown with a nice off-white head that retained rather well. Toasted, bready malts in the nose mostly. Taste was nice and malty as would be expected. Caramel, some toasted bread, wood, earthiness, and a mildly hoppy finish. Light-medium mouthfeel, and very drinkable, like any good Oktoberfesty beer."
"Sunday Sunday....Da da da da, I dont know...if you can sig the song you will know whee I am coming from. Spring cleaning includes the beer fridge!! And YEAH BABY got some GI Harvest Ale left from teh fall...one of my favorites! It is cloudy amber with nice white head with perfect lacing. The smell is malty with a lil hop! The taste is awesome I love the balance between the malt and hops. Mouthfeel is nice! SESSION....been there done that! This beer is GOOOD!"
"I was a little disappointed with the 'flat' appearance and low aroma, but the flavor made up for it. Very tasty and should be enjoyed year round."
"D: This is very nice on its own and could undoubtedly take on several courses from a fall feast. Bravo Goose Island! I'll be kicking back with this next autumn..."
"Living in Chicago I usually have this as my fall go to beer when I need that seasonal taste."
"Drink is great. I'd happily consume this one any cold autumn or winter day."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Golden copper pour with a loose, white head. Nutty bread aroma with notes of fresh cut wood, allspice, grass, a little sweet caramel, and a bit of spicy hops. The flavor predominantly dry nutty malt with lots of peppery, spicy hops and some grassy bitterness on the finish. I don't really taste any cascade in there. It tastes more like a big dose of hallertau. Medium body, dry, lots of carbonation and a crisp lager style finish. I've had better autumn beers."
"Nice offering from Goose Island, too bad it isn't year-round."
"Smells almost like sawdust. Starts smooth and lightly sweet with a velvety-ness to it. Then, it finishes dry, bitter and lightly chalky. A predominant alcoholic zing to it as well. Medium body that fits the style. The flavors and harshness linger long afterwards."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Rich golden hue and a sharp but malty nose. Flavor is hearty and hoppy, but not overpoweringly so. Great grain combination here. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"This beer pours a orange-amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of floral hops with a nice malt backbone. The taste is hoppy, yet balanced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a good beer that I will drink again."
"Notes: Bottled 09/29/10. Interesting beer. Not what I was expecting from an autumn ESB. The taste was something like mixing an American IPA and an ESB or adding a lot of American hops to an ESB. Not bad and an interesting beer. Probably won't blow you away, but for the price it is an enjoyable beer. Worth a try, but not really an ESB."
"Drinkability: At this stage in my beer-sampling career, Goose's regular offerings, including their seasonals, just don't really make my eyes bulge. They are just could-have-been interesting and drinkable while mindlessly sipping at a BBQ or get together."
"D - Great combination of malts and hops to create a very drinkable beer; not to heavy or light; good combination of flavor and smoothness; I could pair this with a heavy meal and be ready for a few more after"
"D/O- Very drinkable ale right here. From the great lacing to the smell/taste...a wonderful ride for a beer that doesn't boast a huge ABV. Makes these cold-ass Illinois autumns that much more bearable."
"Orange copper in color. Two and a half finger head with excellent retention. Leaves a full film coating on the glass. Spicy and rich hop aroma. Nice citric hop flavor as well. Sweetness of caramel malt in perfect balance with the hops. Smooth and creamy medium body. Good carbonation. Slightly drying. An excellent fall seasonal. The best brew from Goose Island I've tried so far. Delicious, balanced and highly refreshing."
"Bottled on 09/09/10.Poured into a Willie glass a bright copper color with a fluffy one finger white head that left shotty lace as it settled slowly.Definently malt driven in the nose,caramel toffee,and slightly roasted nuts mainly stick out,slight herbal hop that lingers.Flavors are malt driven and have a bit of malt complexity,caramel toffee,light fruit,and toasted nut,the hops are light with a lingering herbal finish.Not like most harvest ales in the fact its mainly malt,the complexity to the malt is nice."
"The taste brings some nice notes of caramel and bready malt underneath the hops, which are there as they were in the nose. Good balance between the two. Nice feel with a bit of sweetness as well as a bit of bitterness for balance. Drinks well and this was always a Fall favorite of mine."
"Notes: The subtle complexity and great drinkability make for a fun rounded drinking session."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable."
"This is an ESB, but I don't really get the typical diacytel that's so pervasive in most. It's drinkable though, and really not all that different than many pale ales out there."
"Taste is a full fresh orange - without any sweetness coming through - followed by a bitter grapefruit taste and finnishing dry. The effect awakens the palate leaving lingering popping flavors, mainly floral and citrus. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"A dry, spritzy beer. Thin bodied. The story here is the bitter swallow and finish. Relatively brief aftertaste."
"Overall: This beer is really growing on me. I'm a big fan of Goose Island, but I'm not crazy about their Honker's Ale so I didn't know what to expect with this one. It was perfectly amped up in all the right places and although it isn't extremely memorable, it certainly isn't forgettable either. At such a great value, its my go-to Autumn session beer."
"such a great and refreshing beer...it has the perfect amount of bitterness. this one is a drinker...it goes down easy and it's satisfying to the very last drop! i had always been weary of goose island but lately they've been changing my mind. from their awesome brewpub on clybourn, to their chef collaboration series [featured at the brewpub] they keep on bringing me back. thank you GI!"
"Good fall beer, I could have quite a few of these and have a great night doing so."
"On the palate, medium-to-light bodied. Nicely done maltiness mixed with hops. Carbonation is spot on. Delicious and super-sessionable. Goose Island really continues to impress me."
"D- Well Balanced. A little on the heavy side, but not in a way that will make you feel stuffed and bloated. A warming beer that will leave you wanting more."
"D: I'm a huge fan of this fall seasonal from Goose Island. Works extremely well as a sessionable fall brew. Simple and straightforward, but in a good way. Simultaneously hoppy and toasty, resulting in excellent balance. A thoroughly enjoyable ale."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A flavorful fall beer to be sure. Reminiscent of Southern Tier Harvest. So much so, that if it was poured into a glass and I was told that's what it was, I wouldn't question it. And I drink ST Harvest fresh every year."
"In my opinion this is a great example of the style it represents. It has the right appearance, malty/hoppy smell and nice clean bitter finish."
"This beer pours dark amber with a little over 2 fingers of white head that has pretty good retention, and good lacing, the only thing that i would knock this beef for in terms of appearance is its haziness. The smell is mostly of citrus hops with a little bit of pine, maybe lacking some of the roasty or malty notes that I would like in an esb. Its taste mirrors more of the piney resiney hops with a bit of citrus and more of a roasty malt presence. This beer seems a bit too carbonated to me, but overall, it just seems too light. This beer does have great drinkability though. thoroughly enjoyable fall harvest beer."
"Really enjoyed this brew and found it to be a wonderful representation of the style. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good fall brew to awaken the soul"
"Overall: Meh, just an okay beer. Nothing remarkable or special about this one"
"Just could not get past the overwhelming grapefruit taste. Hops were there, but the grapefruit was simply too overwhelming for me. Would drink again only if I had too."
"Recommended."
"Poured into a nonic with a 2-finger head, color is clear amber-orange with a hint of ruby, excellent head retention and lacing (both seem typical of Goose Island bottles that I've firmly poured). After a hit of nasal decongestant inhaler (thank you girlfriend for that nose remedy -- I am going to marry the hell out of you) and a few swirls of the glass, I began to smell great big aromas of caramel and oatmeal, and only a hint of hops. The taste of oatmeal is fantastic. It is like eating an oatmeal raisin cookie without the raisins. The bitterness of this beer is pretty good for a session beer, even as it seems to leave a film of malty flavor in my mouth. This beer doesn't zap the tongue and kill the mood, even with the higher-than-usual carbonation."
"A very solid ESB. Quite quenchable and for the style is just Americanized enough by GI to make it worth drinking more then two or so. Sure, its usually a fairly boring style, but sometimes the basics are well worth establishing."
"I love this beer and think if the bitterness intensity would match the nose this would make an incredible American IPA. As this stands as an ESB, very nice option for the style."
"Drinkability: There is not too much going on, but Harvest Ale is probably the most balanced beer I have ever had. The hops, though more noticeable in the scent, are in complete equilibrium with the caramel malts, which offers all the citrus flavors without the explosion of off-putting bitterness."
"DB- Goose Island delivers solid beer for a good price. I am starting to think of them like a Sierra Nevada type brand. The hops in this are very nice and make for an overall good experience. It's almost like a West Coast IPA mixed with an Oktoberfest."
"Medium body, good carbonation. Interesting, as from the nose I expected a big slick, juicy IPA, but the mouth is more like a well hopped ESB. Tasty, and I like the toasty flavors this time of year. Worth a shot."
"Honestly, with a name like ""Harvest Ale"" I wasn't expecting an ESB. Oh well, good times either way. It pours a clear sunrise amber topped by nearly a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises butter, flowers, light citrus, and caramel. The taste follows closely, though adding a decent amount of orange-rind bitterness. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a decent brew, nothing too special but tasty enough for an occasional quaff."
"Pours a copper brown with tan head. I am in the Chicago area and I can get this beer very fresh, and it is. Smells like citrus hops, (Cascade), and some grain from the malt. Now call me crazy, I drank one of these yesterday and I tasted some fresh roasted malts, not sure how the brewery handles this, but it all came together exceptionally fresh and it was very very pleasant. I would say this is certainly an American ESB interpretation, with a strong West coast influence from the choice of hops with their citrus and pineyness. However it is quite nice and fruity tasting and almost kinda refreshing, I would say this one is highly drinkable. Mouthfeel as with almost all standard Goose offering is slightly thin, which could be intentional to increase drinkability. Overall; this is a strong offering from Goose Island. Kinda reminds me of their Midway IPA, but more balanced. This is a really good beer, hats off!"
"This one poors a dark, rich copper in color and had a one finger off white head. It smells very dry and hoppy with good bitterness to it. It drinks very well and is an excellent ESB. It boasts excellent bitterness and has an excellent dry appeal. It's extremely drinkable for an ESB, and probably my favorite. I love it."
"I don't really know much about bitters, but I did like this beer. It's got a lot of toasted bready malt, some caramel, maybe some tea like flavors, with some nice grapefruity hops to bring some bitterness in and make the flavor punch. It's very sweet and malty without ever being heavy, thanks to those hops and a crisp mouthfeel, and very drinkable as a fall beer. Would have again."
"One of Goose Island's best seasonal offerings."
"D: Very drinkable beer. It has more flavor than the Honkers Ale and does not bore me as fast. Also, the ABV is still rather low so you can drink lots of them."
"a really nice beer to session, goes down easy and leaves you longing for another sip. not a whole lot different than the honkers ale. both are nice english styles with a slight american hop twist. id come back to this."
"In the same family of styles I preferred Honker's Ale by a good deal, but once in a while this makes for a good alternative to the tyranny of the pale ale without being on an altogether different planet. A nice beer, not my favorite from Goose Island, but a decent seasonal diversion."
"All in all, this is a great autumn beer. Definitely session worthy."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a creamy off-white head that settles into a light cap. The aroma is of grapefruit hops with a touch of pine. Quite nice but wish it was stronger. The taste is of grapefruit hops which is met with a bready malt that adds some fruity and toasted notes, light lemon twang and finishes with a piney hop. The beer has a moderate feel with tingly carbonation; finishes with a slightly sour feel from the malt and slightly bitter from the hops. Goose Island seems to nail the ESB style with this beer. Some nice american hops with a traditional ESB malt profile; works well."
"This is a refreshing and rather complex ESB that is perfect for the first weekend of October. Goose Island always makes quality products."
"D- This one is ok at best. Seems like a work in progress. Not what I expected at all."
"This is the kind of brew that will taste better with every sip, so drinkg a few is probably a good idea. I can't do that today."
"Overall, I found this beer enjoyable, but not in my mind a true to form ESB. More of a pale ale IMHO. I think this would pair awesome with some excellent wings or barbecue. But hey, I'm pretty new in the game, so don't take my word for it, give her a try."
"Mouthfeel is medium. It's a very drinkable beer. The hops stand out as the dominant flavor, but there's nothing about them to write home about. But still, it's a good seasonal. I always like to see a decent hop profile in a beer that doesn't taste like an APA or IPA."
"pours a beautiful amber/orange slight haze with a fresh beige head.. the smell was hops and caramel with pine and citrus some bread and some sweet malts..taste is much the same pine citrus hops are balanced with sweet malts but it is not the freshest or most explosive harvest ale out there its average ++ but lost IMO in a sea of harvest beers ..its good its drinkable and its recommended but it just a b- b+"
"Pretty drinkable if you like the style, but I don't see myself ordering this again."
"D - This is quite good, and I always love picking up a super-fresh sixer before the hop aroma fades. Strangely, it's hoppier than many of Goose's American Pale Ales."
"Nicely drinkable for an ESB. The bitterness does not overwhelm but it is dominant. However, it doesn't leave you with so much aftertaste as to be unpleasant in anyway."
"D - A good tasting ale makes for an easy drinking one. A good session beer, but not necessarily for Fall."
"Overall, this is my favorite of the large-scale seasonal GI beers. The kolsch is too watery, and the mild winter suffers from the same thin weakness, I think. This is a beer I actually enjoy. Again, there's nothing paradigm-shifting at all about this beer--it's just a bit above average by craft standards. However, it admirably lives up to the ""harvest"" feel of the name, even if it isn't quite a perfect exemplar of the ESB style."
"Thick, fluffy off-white head with very nice retention and lacing throughout. Ultra-clear golden amber/red color, with many carbonation trailers. A pleasant smell greets the nose; almost woody sweetness, both as malt and hops. Very balanced beer, with a great smooth malt balanced with excellent, yet non-demanding hops. Definitely plenty enough of both, though. Overall, very darn tasty. The style almost seems like an amber IPA.. Mouthfeel is medium-thin and nicely carbonated. Finishes dry and begs for another sip. I am very, very impressed with this one in 2010, moreso in any other year that I've had it. An absolute winner."
"D - ETD (easy to drink) is this ESB!"
"This is a damn good tasting ale, but that's about it. If this were sold as a pale ale it would be phenomenal. It is delicately hopped and quite smooth. But it also lacks that oomph I would expect for a harvest ale...just leaving more to be desired. I'd buy it again, but wouldn't be in tears if I couldn't get this."
"D- Highly recommend this one can definitely sip on these all night long. If your watching football on a saturday or sunday I would seek this beer out."
"i would recommend! cheers!"
"It finishes with a little more bitterness than the initial taste, bringing more of the hop oils and resin, more spicy hops, a little bit more of the lemongrass and citrus but not much. A very light sticky sweetness lingering, it dried a bit as well. All the flavors linger for a little while, and the dryness creeps up to get pretty dry, accentuating the bitterness."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good bite of carbonation."
"Overall - Good lacing and very good brew I'd give it a B-"
"Solid drinkability, nice tasty seasonal."
"A great beer from a great company. An appropriate seasonal and fine example of common sense brewing experimentation."
"Overall: Goes well on temperate summer nights as well. Otherwise this is the best fall-themed beer I've tried."
"This is my first G.I. beer. It was on sale being a harvest beer and it's feb, so I gave it a whirl. The initial smell, I know it's going to have a great bitterness/hops taste. I get the smell of toasted malts, maybe a little bit of malts, and caramel. The back end also gives me that citrus smell that intrigues me the most when I smell a beer. The taste doesn't disappoint me. I am not overwhelmed by any one taste. Good carbonation on this beer keeps it fresh during the entire bottle. I enjoyed this beer. Only thing that would've made it better would've been enjoying it on a fall evening at wrigley field watching the cubs sew up the pennant."
"D - good session brew, decent taste and mouthfeel"
"Harvest Ale is a great seasonal, though I'm not sure it's best termed an ESB. If the beer has no English hops in it then there's no reason to call it an ESB. It's clearly a pale ale with American hops and no English yeast I could recognize. The only thing is that its a bit deeper red and more carbonated than a traditional pale ale. I didn't ""take off points"" per se, but if you are looking for an ESB then you might be disappointed in this offering. Enjoy it as a good example of a middle of the road pale American ale."
"D - A terrific bitter... Well rounded with lots of character... I would gladly welcome this offering in my glass on a regular basis - I only wish it was available to me on a regular basis..."
"Slight haze in a medium copper body. Small, persistent, creamy, light beige head. Malty notes of butterscotch and toffee mix with a hint of fruit and herbal, minty hops. Toasted biscuity malt up front. Herbal, vegetal hop bitterness comes in. Butterscotch malt sweetness (slightly buttery) fills up the middle of the palate, but the moderate hop bitterness stays (marmalade and pepper). Finish is bitterer and drying with lingering buttery toffee malt. Moderate body with a slightly mineraly feel. Not bad."
"Definitely surprised by this one. Beautiful amber color that reminds me of fall, nice head and great lacing. Smell is a bit weak, but definitely has some fruity hops and light malt in there. Taste is a bit more robust, a generous portion of citrus hops followed by some sweet malt. A bit thick, although a nice sipper, I could have a few of these. Nice cheap brew to have around."
"12oz. bottle courtesy of jrallen34. Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Bottled on 08/13/2009 indicated on the back label. Poured a hazy amber with a frothy, 1.5 inch off-white head that eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch cap; light strands of lacing were exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals a slightly malty character as well as some light fruity esters intermixed with a mellow hops presence. Taste follows nose - malt up-front; an interplay of caramel/toffee, some light acidity and bitterness in the middle, ending with a slightly resinous hops character. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a sparkling effervescence. I like this beer very much for the style. I have never been a huge fan of ESBs, but I found this brew to be interesting, flavorful and sessionable. I've yet to be disappointed by a GI beer."
"Served in a pint glass with about a 1/2"" of frothy white head. Orange to light brown in color. To me, it looks the color of autumn. Opens with a heavy caramel malt that lingers for a bit before the hops kick in. Not much in the way of bitterness - light to moderate, but the hops definitely take a more predominant spotlight in this beer than I would have expected. On the heavier side of medium with appropriate carbonation level. Overall, a good autumn beer, full of flavor and hops, though I did find the malt sweetness to be a bit distracting and, while I've had this beer on many occasions, I can never seem to drink two in a row."
"A good, highly drinkable, session-worthy beer... Although usually known for their stronger, more extreme beers, Goose Island did surprisingly well at achieving a well-balanced brew that goes extremely with a wide variety of dishes... Would definitely recommend it..."
"D - Easy to drink and enjoyable, could session these and have a great time doing it."
"Overall, a pretty enjoyable brew. Not overly bold or anything, but a really nice drinking beer that I wouldn't mind kicking back and drinking a few of."
"thought this was going to be more of a marzen stlye beer but turned out to be esb. It was pretty refreshing tho. Poured into pilsner glass, copper color, white head tan tinge. Smells bit spicy some hops also get some bready malts along with it. Tastes like bread malts to start and ends on pine hop note. Nice taste me like. Mouth feel is light enough to put down a couple few of these. So that ends up with it nice and drinkable. Good for a fall night."
"D- an extremely drinkable brew, i didn't know how the cascades would play on a classic english style, but it works out quite well in this one, in fact i'm making this my new session brew"
"Poured in a Sam Adams perfect pint. Appearance is a dark copper with some carbonation. Has a small fruity hop aroma with some toasted malt. It taste's very light for an ESB with nothing really popping out at me besides some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was a little lighter then expected. Not hard to drink but doesn't appeal to me very well."
"Drinkability: Like most GI brews, this one is very drinkable and I see myself going back to the fridge repeatedly before the night is over."
"D: Goose Island is a favorite brewery of mine, even better that it's local. Harvest Ale is another fine example from GI. enticing to the eyes and wonderful hop bitterness that lingers but doesn't overpower. I liked it so much I ordered another. this will become one of the first seasonal beers I look for next fall."
"D- Very high, these are pretty easy to drink. This is one I'll definitely return to, and the price point doesn't hurt either."
"Thoroughly enjoyable, I can see myself drinking a lot of this. Well done, GI!"
"Drinkability: Not a favorite and I will be passing on this one in the future. It almost drinks like a pale ale."
"Notes: A good beer,I could have another. I think I will. Captures the ""fall spirit"" without over doing it."
"Overall, I really like this offering from GI. It wasn't what I was expecting, but it was still good and quite drinkable. For what it is, I'd easily have more."
"D. Very drinkable. One of the beers I look forward to during the fall."
"(D)- A very easy drinking beer. Straightforward and simple but enjoyable and great for the fall season."
"Good drinkability, a nice beer overall. Pretty hoppy for a bitter, it's pretty good."
"Not my favorite style but this one gets points for being the best one I have tried from this style."
"Taste: Yum. For my palate, this is a perfectly balanced ale, with the hops dominating the maltiness, but not overwhelming it. I'm so glad I went to that lousy football game! At $11.99 a twelve-pack, this is a tasty bargain."
"drinkability is good - nice low sessionable 5.6abv"
"Probably not the best ESB I've ever had, but certainly a fine example of the style. This beer would go well with a variety of foods, but could get overpowered with highly seasoned fare. It is, however, interesting enough to go solo or with light snacks."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent hop nose that's well balanced with a solid malt aroma. It smells like pale and 40L crystal malts. The taste is good as well. It's nothing spectacular in the malt department (pale and a low lovibond crystal), but the hops are a plenty and really make this beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very drinkable harvest ale. It's a hop lovers beer and I love me some hops."
"One nice sip of this and the adjective machine goes to work. Plenty of toasty/bready malt sweetness that blends well with the hops I smelled. The cascade flavor is a little more subdued than you might expect from the smell but there's a nice citrus bite. If my eyes were closed or there was no label on this beer I'd probably guess it was a pale ale. Still I really enjoyed it and to be honest I don't really care what style category its in."
"I find the smell hoppy, with much more subdues malt and caramel. The taste is very much citrus hops, some light roast, and fairly thin. Seems more like a pale ale to me, and I found it too bitter to enjoy."
"I would have assumed this a pale ale like most harvest ales but i'm not sure how an esb really differs, particularly when made in the us. This was a good beer but nothing too memorable. It was new to the beer bar so i ordered it. Average but good on all accounts: color, carbonation, smell, taste, mouthfeel, everything."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Drinkable, for sure. However, the beer is quite hoppy, and the flavor sticks around a while, leaving little room to taste much else."
"Pours a bright copper color with a one finger kind of frothy head. After a few minutes the head goes down but is still there. Leaves ok lacing. The smell is malty to me at first then the hops come out after. Theres also a bit of caramel in there. Taste is a little hoppy, mainly citrus hops. The caramel is there and ends kind of malty. Bitter but finishes easily. Kind of has that familiar Goose Island taste (at least of the Honkers Ale). Mouthfeel may be a bit thin but it could just be the style, I'm not to sure on these. A lower ABV this one is drinkable. Like I said it reminds me of the Honkers Ale which I love so this one I could do all night. Good stuff from Goose Island again which I've pretty much come to expect."
"Conclusion: Nice, hoppy example of the style; straightforward and tasty."
"Drinks easy, not really buying this as an ESB, but damn tasty"
"Drinkability: Easy drinking Autumn ale. It is a nice alternative to the Marzens, Pumpkins Beers and Brown Ales. Very solid ESB overall."
"Not my favorite ESB/Marzen whatever it is. The odd combo of watery mouthfeel and high bitterness make this a no go in my book."
"D- I will give Goose Island this with thier beers I have tried in that they are very drinkable. Overall this isn't a bad drinker but to me it drinks more like a IPA that is past it's prime but not altogether past it's flavor. Would have liked to see a little more bitterness to this beer and less sweetness. Oh well can't have it all though."
"This is a completely shock from what i expected a harvest ale to be. I thought this would be October fest, but instead I landed in something I'd say is akin to a east coast IPA - booyah!"
"Very surprised by this beer."
"This is a nice fall beer... Crisp and refreshing with a nice, sessionable taste."
"Very drinkable beer."
"D-It's an everyday beer when it's in the ""harvest"" season, not in mid-August... it seems that the distribution & GI are a bit rushed getting the beers out there...I'm pleased because I'm more of a full flavor fan."
"very bitter, but sweet and not overly dry. I don't see how this would be something I reach for on the shelf. just not that much going on."
"Not my favorite interpretation of the style, and not my favorite Goose Island beer, but I always have to give the seasonals a go."
"D - It's a good fall beer that would go down well as you watch the leaves fall. Quenching? Not largely but its not bad at all."
"Another decent offering from Chi-town. Nothing really stood out about this beer, and indeed I've tasted better ESB's. That said, it's fairly enjoyable as long as you're not expecting it to set the world afire. Could be a good stepping-stone beer as well."
"Drinkability: super sessionable beer here. Nice balanced flavor puts a smile on your face."
"Pours a hazy golden/orange color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, some spice (all spice or ginger), and some sweet malt. Fits the style of an Extra Special / Strong Bitter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of hops up front, some all spice next, then some slight tart malt in the background. A general dryness is associated with this brew, but the great mouth feel makes complements the dryness nicely."
"easy to drink, real nice flavors. sampled this fall brewed beer in march and it was a pleasure"
"D- At 5.6% and the flavors representing this style of beer nicely, this would be a go to for sure when it's available but alas, goose island is not distrbuted to PA. This is quite a sessionable ESB & is not overdone like some other attempts at this style."
"This offering pours amber with a rocky two fingered head. There is a slight chill haze but some nice lacing. Emitting an aroma of wet hops honey and grapefruit and sticky sweetness. The malts are strong enough to support the the spice hops. A good bold yet ballenced Harvest Ale. The Fresh hops have a chance to shine but don't steel the show. The sweetness plays well off the citric spicy bitterness of the hops."
"D- This is a really tasty, possibly my favorite, harvest ale, this season. The flavors speak to falling leaves and campfires."
"D- Very drinkable not really the best ESB but not really horribly off like many have been for the style."
"Booyah!!!!"
"Solid stuff here. I was really digging the more earthy edge this had plus the body just felt fantastic in the mouth, really helping bring the flavors up. A really nice fall seasonal from Goose Island."
"Deep copper with a medium off-white head that reduced to a thin cap and left nice lace.Aroma issweet caramel malt up front followed by a citrus fruit hop aroma. Some toffee and dark fruits in the background.Flavor is malt forward for sure and if this is supposed to be an ESB then this is right on. A decent amount of citrus hops and caramel/toffee taste. Medium body with a nice smoothness from the rather soft carbonation. A decent amount of lingering sweetness and mild hop bitterness.Good with plenty of caramel flavour mixing well with just enough of a hop kick to make this one interesting. Very Good ."
"Big ups goes out to BA MacDomer for a great bonus beer!"
"Another great delivery from Chicago's Finest!"
"Drinkability: I am afraid the malt profile is a bit too sweet for my tastes"
"Lacey medium yellow to amber creamy mouthfeel ESB. Good for style, nice understated citrus bitterness. Mild English bitter aroma,nicely malted. Very drinkable. Carbonation was suitable, though a bit prickly.A litle sugar, a little toasted malt, a little wheat."
"Thanks Goose Island."
"This is a good session beer and I will be picking up a sixer in the future"
"mouthfeel is of nice lingering hops, great malt flavors, easy drinking, easy to session and highly delicious.. mmm"
"Like other Goose Island seasonals, best to get your hands on nearer to the begining of the respective season. Late Aug / Early Sept for this one."
"A hidden gem from Goose Island. This beer has a superb taste and no stylistic flaws. Smell consists of strong hops, very much like an IPA. There's a sweet malt flavour with a subtle bitterness, extremely smooth mouthfeel, and a zesty, fruity hop aftertaste. Lacing is solid and clings to the glass in half-inch rings. An impressive American extra special bitter."
"Tastes OK for a fall type seasonal brew. The hops definitely come through and this beer is heavily carbonated. Liked it but not sure the drinkability was very high."
"It smells very hoppy but it is a good hop blend much like the flavor with a little bit of malt sweetness earthiness coming from the background. It has a bronze red hue with a tan almost brown head. There is a lot of head and lace to this beer. I would say about two and a half fingers. The taste is like the aroma but a little earthier but still a good use of hops is very apparent in the flavor. It is almost like an IPA with some bitter citrus tones. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and with that comes a decent amount of burn."
"Cheers to drewbeerme for the bottle. Popped it to celebrate pre-Halloween and bring the harvest spirit to southern California. Pours clear amber/copper with a generous, lasting white frothy head. Hops, citrus (lemon) and pine dominate the aroma with a slight yeastyness and earth when I swirl. It smells better than it tastes, but remains very drinkable. Crisp, slightly malty and a kick of hops for flavor fading quickly to a bit dry and bitter on the after taste. In fact, it leaves my mouth slightly dry, but wanting for more. Not a bad ESB."
"D - Pretty high. Goes down easy. ABV is manageable. Light and refreshing. Great? No. But pretty good."
"I am going to run to the store and try to get another 6-pack of this before it is gone and then I will look forward to autumn 2009 when I can get this beer again."
"Drinkability- Overall this is a pretty solid Harvest Ale. Usually these fresh hop brews smell quite a bit hoppier than they taste but this one manages both. It was a good beer to start the day with and I'm glad it was on special!"
"poured from a bottle. this has my mind blown. color is brown with a hint of amber, light head. smell is malty, light hops. the taste is what throws me off. hoppy up front, light IPA, but the finish is very malty. reminds of an oktoberfest. light carbonation. i must say this caught me off guard. this is very sessionable."
"Harvest Ale is an easy drinker. You could easily put back a handful of this stuff in an evening. It's pleasant, if not overly great. Solid, but that's good enough."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable and enjoyable beer that pairs well with food. Well worth the price."
"I am again very impressed with this offering. I had it at Goose Island Wrigleyville last year on draft and I hope to get back there again to enjoy it. It is almost as good in bottles as it is on draft. Excellent brew!"
"Pours a dark coppery amber with a very light tan head. The hops are definitely apparent from the smell of this one. It is a thick-medium body and seemingly lightly carbonated. The taste is delicious! Very crisp and hoppy with a solid hop aftertaste but not really bitter at all--more of a sweet-hop that lingers. This one I will definitely buy again and recommend to others without a doubt!"
"Creamy and fizzy. Nice rich body. A terrific harvest, balanced and hoppy. Very good example of the Harvest Ale style."
"D-Good with plenty of caramel flavour melding well with just enough of a hop kick to make this one interesting. Not a ""classic"" harvest brew but if this is to be more of a fresh hopped ESB then this hits the mark for sure."
"D - This is a unique harvest ale that really grew on me the more I drank it. While it is quite malty overall, the flavor is complex with plenty going on to hold my interest. This one possessed more of a subtle hop character that was still quite tasty and enjoyable."
"D- Bottom line, could drink all day every day! Respect Beer."
"Nice beer, a very drinkable ale with a nice clean finish."
"I can have a couple of these, but I think its a little bit one-note to have more than two rounds. I ended up using a bottle to cook some bratwurst in because I was bored of the flavor but knew it was good enough to add a little something to the sauasage."
"Drinkability: Pretty high - the stickiness is the only thing that would keep me from calling this session."
"Great hop profile, well balanced. Would prefer a slightly lower ABV for sessions and I am secure in my manhood saying that. Hey Goose Island: I got your ""willi glass"" right here... but this is tasty beer."
"Goose Island Harvest Ale was amber in color with and off-white head. The head had good retention with some lacing. The aroma was citrus hops with a little toasted malt in the background. The taste was sweet toasty malt followed closely by citric hops. It was balanced with a dry finish. The mouthfeel was good, a medium body with soft carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This is a fall seasonal that I will be drinking a lot more of."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (bottled 8/25/08) into my Blue Point shaker glass. Appears a slightly hazy amber color with two fingers of creamy off-white foam. Smells of fresh, citrusy hops and toasted malts. Tastes of lemon, pine, caramel malt as well as a mild floral note. Medium in both body and carbonation. A pretty tasty harvest beer. Try it if you get the chance."
"D- This beer has a nice fresh full hops flavor with good support from toasted malt. A good autumn sipper."
"Goose Island has always been a sentimental favorite - probably one of the first craft outlets I ever encountered, courtesy of my crazy cousin in the far north 'burbs. For all the intense flavor profile and abundance, this drinks quite clean. Extremely clean. One of the most well-balanced offerings I've come across recently. Well done!"
"D: Very easy to drink, good flavor"
"I really enjoy this time of year and all of the seasonal harvest ales that hit the shelves. This is solid release in the bunch. There's a few others I prefer simply due to stylistic differences. But, this one's good. I think the hop and citrus fruit flavors could be amped up a little. But, it's a small complaint. This is a good beer. Definitely recommended."
"It's an ok beer, but nothing I'll probably buy again."
"A pretty decent American version of an ESB. Balanced and smooth with an interesting earthy quality. A good session brew."
"Easy to drink, pretty good job at creating that classic ESB flavor. A nice change of pace fall seasonal."
"This beer is delicious, a great hop finish. I get a little apricot taste on the finish. Great effort by goose island. It pours an amber color and has a great smell. I equate this beer as a mix between 60 Minute, Magic hat #9 and a splash of octoberfest. I love this beer. any hopheads must try this as an Ofest/Autumn beer."
"Light brown color. Great creamy head. Nose is amazing from addition of wet hop cascades; very earthy (musty) and oily. Taste is nothing like I expected. I'm not a big fan of cascade hops but this really grew on me. Spicy, earthy taste that didn't have the intense grapefruit backbone. Doesn't linger on the tongue either which I liked. A bit thin in the finish but all-in-all a very decent beer."
"Pours a very solid amber, and nicely carbonated with a thick two finger head and lacing. Strong whiff of Cascades and Centenial hops dominate the aroma. A firm, smooth body balance the citrus bitterness of the hops. The malt base provided enough balance. The finish was a bit dry and not at all cloying. One of Goose Island's finest. Served at cellar temps (50-55 deg) in pint glass."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a small head on an amber body. Smells very sweet, maple syrup, a touch of citrus, and a bit of hop bite. Although the hoppiness wasn't too overpowering in the taste, none of the other elements could rise to the hops level, much less above it. A bit if a disappointment."
"A medium bodied ESB with a orange color reminiscent of the fall leaves. The brew is more carbonated then other ales I have had and the foamy top dissipating slowly overtime. The taste is rather unique style that is not really an ESB but rather a hoppy orange ale. The malt introduces the beer and the clean hops seem to punctuate the taste. The taste didn't disappoint just a drinkable brew that finishes clean."
"mid body with good carbonation. i like this beer. the hop aroma knocked me down. very fresh smelling. could drink many more. i will try to pick another sixer up before the end of the season. i do not want to wait for my bro-in-law to send more my way."
"Draught @ Old Chicago: This one pours an orangish-amber color that was pretty clear. There was a decent sized white head on it. The aroma was quite nice. Lots of hops to the nose. They are mainly piney, but there is a caramel sweetness comong to the top also. Some spiciness too. The taste is quite good also. A little bit of sweet malts, piney bitterness, some spiciness. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"Easy to drink and easier to love. A perfect beer for the Fall season."
"I actually thought this was a really good ESB, and it's worth saying it's good value for the $$. Picked up a sixer of this for $6.99.. well worth trying, in my book."
"D- another solid beer that i wish goose that i wish was more than a seasonal. easy enough to finish one, maybe even two. thats when i would look to see what else i had in the fridge."
"Highly drinkable in my opinion. I'll definitely be picking this up regularly while it is around. I almost wish I was outside in the cold to enjoy this first bit of seasonal briskness with the Harvest Ale."
"D= This is a great Fall beer and one whose release I look forward to every year. Definitely a fantastic session beer to enjoy on a crisp day."
"Nothing spectacular here, but a solid offering."
"D - this drinks well, it has a good balance and isn't overpowering that it overwhelms after a while. It is a good autumn beer and I will look forward the rest I purchased."
"D: Very drinkable and low ABV. Not a whole shit load going on but it's doing it right."
"12 ouncer, Bottled on dating on the rear label of ""08/12/08", nice gotta love fresh beer and this stuff has been in the bottle for just about 6 weeks....pours typical medium amber, nice soft creamy head/fine bubble film and fine, delicate lacing. Nose is of sweet biscuits and malt. Pleasant, balanced offering. The kind of beer you could drink all night. Crowd pleaser, and a nice entry level beer for newbies to the good beer world."
"I think the Goose Island Oatmeal Stout is ok and so I check this out. Decent - Taste is nothing too special but nothing bad. Carbonation is a bit high. Not much head, either. Still a somewhat enjoyable beer - I'd drink a few if they were given to me. I prefer many others, though, like Sierra Nevada and Rogue."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint glass. Poured a deep amber/orange with a couple of fingers of fine bubbled white head. Really fresh piney hop aroma with a good dose of caramel malt. Medium bodied with a smooth moutfeel. Good caramel malt base, followed by a solid hop bitterness. Very drinkable. This is a great example of why I like fresh, seasonal beer."
"It has a medium body with some strong hops flavors and the caramel again comes through, although it again could compete with the hops a little better. It is reasonably easy to drink overall and has a good amount of bitterness, as well as crisp feel. Overall, this is a good beer but is could be better with a little more balance in the taste."
"An enjoyable beer and a decent representation of an ESB. Not among the upper tier for the style, but if this was all that was around I would be very happy."
"Solid fall-time ESB from the Goose."
"Could drink this often. Just not the spicy, sweet, or malty as the other beers of the fall season."
"The Harvest Ale has an attractive appearance, deep amber fairly clear. Two finger, off white head with decent retention and lacing. There's a grapefruit and pine hop nose, not too overpowering. The taste is typical of an American Pale Ale with a little extra caramel malt. All in all the flavor is pretty well balanced. The body is medium and lightly carbonated. I would say this does not work quite as well as an Oktoberfest for a session beer, however it went well when I alternated it one for one with Sam Adams Oktoberfest last weekend."
"mouth feels medium and crisp, I could drink this all autumn long."
"D-I will enojy this one more before fall lets out and with the suprising warming sensation may save a few for winter."
"The nose on this beer is fucking awesome! It has a nice citrus/spicy hops to it with a slight caramel malt undertone. Absolutely beautiful. The colour of the beer is a dark copper with a good inch head that doesn't have that good of retention or lacing. Looks really good though. The beer has a quite odd taste for an harvest ale. There is almost a bit of a leafy hop flavour and a nice fruit taste to the beer and very little bitterness. The leafy/aroma hops is absolutely beautiful, but the beer really lacks in bitterness (hence the low taste rating). If the beer would give a slight bit of bitterness this would rival Sierra Nevada's Harvest Ale. The beer is slightly cream and incredibly fucking drinkable!"
"D - Overall this is probably one of the best GI beers that I have ever had. It has great flavor, a good mouthfeel and it is super drinkable. I would definitely buy this over and over again. One great beer."
"drinkability is great. this is a solid fall brew, be it an ESB or a marzen. the brew is smooth and rich in profile, with an excellent balance and a very drinkable profile. cheers!"
"This is a beer that works well for a session. It has a pleasant taste that isn't overwhelming and warms me on the inside as I finish the beer."
"D- A very drinkable and sessionable beer. One that might be good for introducing someone into the wonderful world of hoppier beers without being intimidating or overwhelming. I don't know if I would have made this a Fall seasonal, but it's a good beer."
"Very drinkable beer, definitely qualifies as a session ale. I'd recommend trying it."
"Got a 12pack and it took like 6 months for it to go away in my beer fridge, used a couple bottles for cooking. Just totally underwhelming. Malty, but zero hop character, totally out of balance. This beer bored me to death. By far the weakest Goose Island brew I've had. Harvest ale? I was expecting a nice Oktoberfest with this kind of name and this just did not deliver."
"Overall a tasty and easily quaffed ale."
"Deep orange color with a short but dense cream colored head. Foam lasts a long time with thick lace left on the glass. Some floral and earthy hop smell. Taste is a solid malt, biscuit and bready. Nice floral hop bitterness to balance. A bit of grapefruit in the end. I would say medium bodied, smooth, well balanced. A very drinkable ESB, perfect for a cool evening."
"This is another winner from Goose Island, more Special than Strong in the ESB acronym. There's much to enjoy about Harvest Ale. Goose Island proves itself consistent, creative, and delicious. Well done, and well worth trying."
"Dark amber tp a light maroon color and a small whitish head. Light sticky toffee, malt, and a noticeable hope presence on the nose. As it sits the smell turns medicinal, and band-aid like, but then after 10 more minutes becomes pleasant again. Very odd.. Hops are present in the taste initially, are mild, and then the finish kicks in with a light, nutty, toffee like malt flavor. A bit different for the style than what I expected, and quite good because of it. Nice beer."
"drinkability is great. nicely balanced and very enjoyable. i'd happily drink this one all the time if it were available locally."
"Md body and moderate carbonation. Mediocre."
"D: Does the job, and would make a great session beer and sure would be great on tap if we could get out here. I really wish more ESBs were like this one. Thanks jtrockchalk for the trade."
"To me this one is a winner, one I could drink all year."
"Drinkability: Though placed well on the lighter end of harvest-type ales, it was still quite enjoyable."
"Harvest Ale is another solid, drinkable offering from Goose Island. I'm sure it'll never happen, but I'd like to see them switch labels and call this one Honker's Ale. At least then it would be available year-round. Better still, they should just add more hops to both beers and be done with it."
"D - This is a pretty good representation of the style. It is not the best ESB, but it is certainly drinkable/sessionable."
"Pours a mid-dark amber color with better than a full finger stiff light tan head that resists fading and leaving a good amount of lacing behind. The smell is really nice too; seemed to have a hoppy edge when the cap was released. Settles out to a balanced slightly roasted malt caramel. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel has got a lot of texture and it complements the malt flavor well. At 5.6% ABV it's a really nice drinking session beer."
"Ive had many beers over the years including many in the ba top 100 and I have to say that goose islands harvest ale is one of the best beers that I have ever consumed, It pours a copper color with a nice bubbly head,excellent floral ipa smell and a very nice bubbly head.Could drink this all night."
"The beer pours a clear copper color with a white head that leaves a nice lacing. The aroma has a moderate spicy, citrus hop character as well as a medium-low toasted malt aroma. The flavor is moderately malty, some sweetness with a pronounced, moderate spicy hop flavor. The bitterness is moderate. The beer finishes crisp with a lingering hop flavor and slight sweetness. The body is medium-full and carbonation is moderate. Overall a nice brew, an Oktoberfest meets an American Amber Ale. I especially like the balance of very robust hop and malt flavors."
"D - An outstanding session brew. It's got a good dose of hops and a really nice and firm mouthfeel. It's not super-complex, but it's a quality brew for sure, and it fits the style to a T."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. Aromas of sweet maltiness, almost lager like. In the taste, a small sweet malt and just a small bitterness. A small bitter mouthfeel, with a malty sweet to dry aftertaste. Lager-ish more than an ale, but a nice malt presence."
"Drinkability- Very, I could go to town on this beer if necessary. This is a fine beer for the falltime/winter swilling needs."
"This beer would make for a good session. The flavors are clean and pretty cohesive. It's just an easy drinking beer that is well executed."
"The piney, citrusy west coast hops are balanced nicely by a faintly caramel malt profile, but the hops still are the biggest presence in this beer. Not sure I could have ever guessed this was brewed as an ESB -- it's more like a pale ale to me."
"Like an earlier reviewer, I picked this up expecting an Oktoberfest, but was (I admit) pleasantly surprised to detect the flowery odor of an IPA. Brownish hue, substantial 1 1/2 finger off-white head, and (most importantly) the taste followed suit. Dry, resiney, yeasty malt taste with a slightly grainy mouthfeel and a not-too-clean finish. Gosh - all those descriptors don't make it sound like I liked this beer all that much; but I assure you, it was quite to the contrary. Definitely very much like a tasty pale ale, but with just a bit more body to warm the belly on a cold autumn's eve. Another winner from Goose Island!"
"Very nice beer."
"A great beer!"
"Another fine beer from GI. I'd like to try the draught version but unfortunately my car is dead : ("
"I've only had two ESB's, and with this being one of them its great, so far so good on this style."
"This is a nice hearty fall beer. Perfect for pairing with some heartier fare like stews or roasted meats. It would go well with sandwiches on artisinal bread. I'd have to say that this was one of the more enjoyable new offerings from G.I. in the past few years."
"This is a surprise of a harvest ale from Goose Island. Not the resiny one sided hoppiness like you might expect from a harvest ale but more supremely balanced and subtle making it highly drinkable."
"M & D - I would say this is a medium bodied beer that goes down easy. Carbonation is mild but plays off the flavor of the beer nicely."
"pours a beautiful coper color with a fluffy white head that has a nice amount of lacing. has a really nice scent to it, lots of piney hoppiness to it and a little malt undertoe. tastes pretty good, just the right mixture of bitter hopness and sweet maltiness. mouthfeel is really good, thick and rich not watery. very good all around beer."
"Drinkability - this is good and very sessionable. It is listed here as an ESB, but it seems to be to be a hoppy American Amber/Red Ale. Nonetheless, it is a sessionable, hop-centric, and satisfying ale."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. Smooth to drink, crisp and refreshing. Goes good with most if not all tailgate foods."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium. Unpleasant balance. Could use a little caramel malt to add to the body and sweeten it up a bit, thus downplaying some of that nasty toasted biscuit malt. Brewing an English style doesn't mean that you have to toss in a full baking pan of butter and biscuits. If the hops hadn't faded so quickly, this review would probably be a lot more favorable, but what can you do?"
"This scores 4's across the board, a solid ""good"" rating.."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Carbonation is moderately prickly. Body is medium. Good palate cleanser. Solid beer overall."
"I, for some reason, wasn't expecting this to be that good when I bought it. I was pleasantly surprised; and would drink this again...soon."
"a nice beer and a nice switch up from all the o-fests i've been drinking, but this is no substitute for the GI o-fest that was one of my faves. keep this in the lineup and bring back the octoberfest!"
"overall, a good beer to throw in amongst the countless Oktoberfests in autumn, i enjoy this beer quite a bit and would definitely buy again."
"D: Very high"
"Overall, not really what I was expecting, but interesting nonetheless. This came in a sampler of oktoberfest micros, but it technically isn't one, as will become obvious from the first sip. I found the fruit aromas to be quite prevalent in the smell, but nicely understated in the actual taste. I was also pleasantly surprised by the head and lacing. Very solid brew."
"A pleasant surprise to find this on tap at Pazzo's Pizza Pub in Lexington KY. The beer came to the table with a high carbonation rate, slight head retention, and light on lacing. The color takes on deep amber to brown hues with bright clarity. Aromas are faint, but take on deep amber malt / toasted malt character with nuttiness and earthy (English) hop scents. The flavors are also mellow and bring out the same toasted malts found in the nose, along with stronger hop rates, fruityness, and a lightly pungent peat-ey note. The textures are firm, but not heavy or viscous, cleaned up by the hop bittering and dryness. Finishes with a hop flavor, bitterness and a mild toastiness. A good break from all of the sweeter Oktoberfests that I have been drinking lately."
"I was expecting an Octoberfest because the bottle seems to be that way, but as an ESB, this wins on all corners for me. It's something I'd like to have again. Maybe on tap, this is even better."
"drinkability - a nice fall beer with a nice price in the chicago area."
"Drinkability: Very nice drink. This will make a great session beer. The first time I tried this beer I had a few more to follow the fist."
"A nice change of pace from the traditional fall seasonals. True to style, with the possible exception of the higher carbonation. Well balanced and easy drinking, at 5.6 probably on the high end of sessionable, but I could definitely have a few of this one."
"While I will miss the Goose O-Fest, this will help ease the pain. Well done!!"
"in the flavor, brief diacetyl, but not substantial. the hop flavor and bitterness are significant, though allow the malts some playing time. in the end, however the hops are what seem most prevalent. ESB, really? i'm not so sure. it's very drinkable, to be sure, but seems a little flimsy for an ESB. the hop flavor is good, though"
"D - Some earthiness in the flavor fits the harvest name but I was expecting a wet hopped beer. Highly drinkable but I might tire of this one easily."
"Pours a tawny amber hue with copper highlights and decent clarity. Above average retention leaves rings of lace. Toasted and fruity nose, with hints of nut, buscuit and leafy english hops. Light caramel sweetness upfront, followed by a toasted pale malt taste and suspect Marris Otter flavor. Some buscuit notes and faint dextrins further enrich the malt profile, with a mellow english ale ester in the background. The aftertaste shows a flash of fresh tobacco leaf and herbal English hop flavor; a solid bitterness keeps the grain-centric character of this beer in check without pushing the malt out of the spotlight. Medium-light in body with a gentle and light carbonation, the mouthfeel relies heavily on increasing grainy notes and drying hops to provide balance- but manages to do so very effectively. Some faint diacetyl buttery taste slowly becomes evident near the finish, but the bitterness and building tannic grain taste dries the palate enough to fend off any slickness. Finishes mostly clean with soft diacetyl and fruity Ringwood yeast becoming more pronounced but thoroughly covered up by the hop oil and now vaugely astringent grain character. I had expected this to be a slightly altered version of the Goose Island Flagship, but in fact is a unique and satisfying entitiy unto itself."
"D- Could be that earthy aspect to the flavor, but for some reason I picture this being a great beer to enjoy when I'm workin' the fields. Not all that impressive, but better the other Goose Island offerings I have had so far."
"great head retention that holds to keep carbonation in. Copper color very nice. Smell floral scent cascade dry hopping. Taste: Nearly tastes like autumn if that makes sense? WHich is what I look for in a seasonal. Don't taste as much hop bitterness as I smell I taste more malt tones. Most drinkable ESB i have tasted. Great session beer for the College Football season."
"This is a very nice offering from Goose Island. Definitely a cut above the standards you see from them."
"I can drink it, and drink it again...but, I'm not wild about it...good one, though..."
"Overall a very nice, malty, sessionable beer that pairs well with the cooler fall temperatures."
"12 oz bottle. This one pours a deep golden color with a small but full head that falls to a solid coating over top. Clarity is fantastic and there is a light carbonation in the brew. The aroma is a nice malt and hop balance. I get very solid notes of toasted grain with mild breadyness. The hop comes through as a mild earthyness and a moderate citrusy orange as well. I really like the malt character in this one. The flavor is dominated by toasty, light grainyness and a solid earthy hop that pulls the two malt components together very well. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. It keeps the beer from flowing from my glass too quickly, but also keeps it very approachable. I find this one to be incredibly drinkable. The flavors are nice and prevalent without being too much. It has a fairly low ABV keeping it nice and drinkable. I think this one is a winner."
"Overall a very nice brew. If it would have been title 'Oktoberfest', I might frown a bit due to the hoppy profile. This is a perfect beer to help welcome the colder months to soon follow. It's got a little bit of summer charm with a somewhat bolder underbelly. It really works well with my palate and mood right now. Great 'simple' beer with a couple tricks up its sleeve. Bravo!"
"Pours an amber orange with a nice sized white head. The head leaves some decent lacing. Retention is decent as well. Aroma is of pine, citrus, sweet bready malt, and a touch of bubble gum. Taste hoppy up front. The hops are piney, fruity, and spicey. Sweet malt is slightly present in the back. Not really as well balanced as the style generally is, but an easy drinker and a decent brew, though I wouldnt get it if I were looking for a classic example of the style."
"Pour was top-notch; copper amber with a massive foam cap that stuck to the side like gorilla glue."
"served on-tap, this was a clear deep copper with a creamy tan head that quickly diminished to a nice collar. simple but appealing nose of bready caramel and piney hops. taste strikes a nice balance between the light to moderate sweet malts and matching bitterness. this is a nice, sessionable brew."
"Goose Island is very underrated, in my opinion. The Harvest ale being no exception. It pours a beautiful red amber/orangish color. Great head and nice lacing down the glass. Sweet malts kick in on the nose followed by perfect balance and a bit of hoppy goodness. A very clean, smooth, brew and highly sessionable. I enjoyed this one and it will be in my fridge more often."
"I really enjoyed this beer and found it pleasantly surprising. It had a really pleasant citrus-hop aroma, and a light maltiness balanced with a lot of very crisp and pleasant lemon-y hop. Color was a nice amber, with a lot of head. I found the mouthfeel to be just a bit thin and watery, but I would still call this one a winner. I would definitely recommend giving this beer a try."
"Mouthfeel detracts, but an easy drinking beer with distinct hop flavors."
"A good brew but could be better with just a little bit better carbonation. Therefore I don't consider this a good session beer. Just feels a tad heavy."
"Finally found the new fall seasonal from Goose Island. The brew poured a nice clean red with a fluffy thick cap. Decent lacing is left on the glass. Smell is a fruity resin coated hops, a bit of bready malt tempers the aroma. Very nice. Taste has a nice fruity hop start, grapefruit mostly. The piney hops are also very present. Again the over all feel has the malt balancing it out. Easily one of the best tasting G.I. brews I've had. Mouthfeel is a crisp and clean. I found this offering extremely drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: Solid offering, pretty complex with well balanced flavors even though its a bit hoppy initally, good and solid seasonal from Goose Island."
"HeatherAnn and I also drank this, on draft, at the GI sponsored ""Hideout Block Party"" last night (9/07/07). We noticed that the draft version of this that they were serving was even hoppier! We could've sworn that they were pouring their IPA until it warmed slightly and the maltiness came about. Excellent!"
"Mouthfeel is full and in fact borders on creamy which is unusual for an ale not on nitro. I absolutely think this is the most drinkable GI beer I've had in ages and am thrilled that it has replaced the steady but unspectacular Oktoberfest in their bottled line-up."
"I think this is more a of an American Red, but I am reviewing it under the correct spelling. It is a nice deep amber copper color, with an off white head. It is already gone as I look back at the glass but did leave some lace. Aromas of American citrus hops start of the aromas. However I am noticing a sort of phenolic, chemical cleanser smell in there too. Bread like character notes are in the background with caramel and toast. The mouth feel is really light. Makes it very easy to drink. a nice fall afternoon beer, that is very session-able."
"D- perfectly balanced with great hop flavor that isn't overwhelming. totally a session beer. pair it with goose island honkers ale and switch on and off between the two with their relatively low ABV you can have a great night with great beer without getting too hammered."
