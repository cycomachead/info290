I enjoyed the pine citrus hops smell that it had. It had a dry finish with this beer. I could taste the pine, citrus, floral, earthy hops that it has. It also had a caramel sweetness to it that I liked a lot as well.","jaredtp","Jul 19, 2014"

The scent is fresh bitter hop with a touch of sweetness...not sure if its of caramel or citrus nature....perhaps a combo of both. The taste starts and finishes with a very nice sweetness....the middle is a punch of bitterness that is lovely. There is a presence of caramel, biscuit and pine. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall....I really like this one...its bitter yet sweet...much like my wife.","WoodBrew","Sep 23, 2013"

Although the word "bitter" is part of the acronym, ESBs are generally not this bitter. This is more of a dark pale ale (if that makes any sense) IMO but, regardless of what Sweetwater wants to call it, it's very good. I admit, when I bought this variety 12-pack, the ESB was what I was desiring the least but now I know I'm thoroughly enjoying every beer in the box.","Immortale25","Aug 26, 2013"

3.7,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Had while out and about at my buddy’s bachelor party! Tick all day, every day! Served from tap into a Samuel Adams sampler shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spice, earth, earth hop, spicy hop, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, spice, earth, spicy hop, earth hop, bread, and floral hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I have to say that I was quite surprised that I have not reviewed this one yet. There was a really nice few things going on in the flavor of this one with the bread and floral hop notes that kept my palate looking for what was going to happen next. This fact definitely made it rather easy to drink and enjoyable throughout. Definitely worth your time trying if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Sep 14, 2012"

4.25,14.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The beer pours a hazy amber color with a foamy tan head. The nose gives a piney hop profile.

Rather hoppy for the style, with a fair amount of citrus and pine flavors, plus a distinct leafy bitterness. All this hoppy business distracts from the bready and nutty malts.

3.7,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer is a tarnished copper color with a head to be proud of. It has a toasty, sweet malt aroma with a healthy herbal hop twang in the back. It's sublimely smooth and perhaps a tad slick. With toasted grain all around, there are quick flashes of caramel sweetness and more of a dried grassiness in the end. The tamed hops add some spiciness and a mildly bitter, herbal flavor. There's also vague fruitiness within the folds. It finishes relatively dry, with that dried grass, toasted grain flavor. This is an off-base seasonal. We love it because the norm doesn't need to be the path for everyone.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"

3.86,3.8,4,3,4,5,4,"OVERALL: If the smell of beer was equivalent to the cover of a book, this would be the gold standard in not judging a book (or a beer) by its cover. The taste turns out to be far different from the smell and unlike some other ESBs, the Motorboat is genuinely bitter. Although, the bitterness does level out at the end of each sip. At 5.6% it might be a bit much to be considered a true session beer, but it is easy to imagine a hot summer evening in the southeast with a six-pack of Motorboats.","StoneTSR","Oct 27, 2010"

I couldn't see through it but I don't know the significance of that in this style of beer. Good inch and a quarter thick head. Smell was somewhat dull, not a lot there. Not a heavy beer, sat on the stomach like a light beer (didn't feel like I had eaten a meal). New experience for me, the second gulp was significantly better than the first one. Had me ready for another sip. The only major downer I could recognize was when I burped it released this awful smelling fume (kinda like rotten vegetables).

4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy red orange color with a two finger fluffy beige head that persists forever. Smells of citrus right off, I'm thinking grapefruit, but that aroma disappeared quickly. Some caramel and a bit of spicy, minerally esters waft up towards my nostrils as well. At first smell it was a dead ringer for an American IPA, but as it sat the nose definitely morphed into a more English bitter leaning animal. Taste is malty with caramel and brown bread, minerally with that English hop flair but an almost citrusy hop bite in there as well. Medium to high carbonation, medium body with a watery/syrupy mouthfeel. This is a weird little beer that I really enjoyed. It's like an Americanized version of an esb that is still true to its English roots.","johnnnniee","Dec 31, 2009"
3.73,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"The good balance here is what made it work for me, with a healthy dose of spicy bitterness that kept things interesting and just enough malts and citrus flavor to keep it in check. Nice little take on the style.","Kegatron","Dec 29, 2009"

3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reddish copper hue under a fat, sturdy head. Smells pretty green with a toasted grainy sweetness underneath citrus and grass. Sweet malt flavor balanced with tea-like and juicy citrus hops. Not really something to compare to authentic ESBs, this is more like a solid amber ale to me. The mouthfeel is gritty and creamy thanks to the low carbonation, finishing dry and bitter. Again, there's way too much green, hoppy bitterness for this to be a good ESB - this is American-style stuff - but it's pretty tasty whatever it is, so I have trouble faulting it...","wedge","Oct 12, 2009"
4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy copper with two finger cream colored head, nice lacing. Smell: citrus and earthy hops, mostly citrus, backed by caramel sweetness.

4.34,16.7,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Overall the wet-hopping influenced this beer more than the cask conditioning as the carbonation levels were almost identical to the draught version.

Very noticable citrus hop scent, backed by a lightly roasted caramel sweetness. All of this is mirrored in the taste. A nice roastiness to it, but the flavor falls short. I understand that this style is not meant to be a hop bomb but I wish there was less balance in this area. That's not to underplay this beer because the lemon and light grapefruit comes out really nicely in the taste, I just wish there was more there. Another decent offering from Sweetwater.","CoolJosh","Sep 02, 2009"

3.6,-3.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, I cannot comment on how the beer might be true to style. ESB is just not a style I can say that I am very familiar with. However, Sweetwater does not seem to be going for that here. Instead they are going for a very Americanized strong ale somewhat inspired by the British ESB. The beer is certainly easy considering its higher ABV (somewhere around 7), but in the end it just seems to lack a defining characteristic to make it stand out as a truly great beer.","MSchae1017","Nov 03, 2008"
3.72,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: It drinks fairly easily, but is a bit too confused to be great. I appreciate Sweetwater trying to branch out and create something different, but I think the idea of a super-hopped ESB was doomed to fail from the start. The hop-tastic start gives way to a really weak attempt at a good ESB's balance and nuance. It's still not a bad beer, and I'd drink it for a change of pace every once in a while. It's a nice option for a time when I don't want to full-on commit to their IPA, but still want enough hops to whet my whistle.","BamaBeerBuff","Oct 28, 2008"

Color is a beautiful, clear, appetizing copper with an off-white and fairly persistent head. Mouth-filling flavor is fairly but not fiercely bitter, and has just a whisper of sweetness as well as a nutty undertone. Texture is exceptionally smooth so it goes down very nicely.","Cyberkedi","Oct 20, 2008"

3.23,-13.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Burnt orange color was nice to look at, and the body was mostly clear with some lingering haze. The head was thin, like a rim of bubbles mostly. The smell was sweet and citric, and nothing like any ESB. It was too fruity and perfumey to be considered even close. The taste was spicy, earthy, honey sweet, and slightly soured. The mouthfeel was very chalky and a bit harsh. Not a bad beer per se, but way off target for the style, and not very sessionable.","rajendra82","Oct 13, 2008"
3.72,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: An E.S.B. this is. It's very balanced, perhaps even on the malty side of the E.S.B. nation, and though I have no clue what the abv% is, I'd guess it's not higher than 6.5%, which isn't eminently unreasonable. That being said, it's not my favorite E.S.B., nor is it one of Sweetwater's best brews, though it is respectable.","CrellMoset","Oct 10, 2008"
3.78,1.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear amber with reddish hues. Steady carbonation and a great head that keeps its retention and leaves steady lacing down the glass. Smell is nothing like an ESB to me but I still enjoy it. Some citrus hops similar to what you'd find in their IPA. It reminds me more of a harvest ale or hoppy amber than what it is. Still, I'm a fool for the hops. I feel like there is some Centennial in here, which is always a good thing. Taste is just the same. More hoppy than anything. Big and citrusy with a light caramel and biscuity touch. I like it but can't give it much credit for the style. Good crisp mouthfeel, basically on the light side with a minor bitterness. This is close to session material in my book, though as said not exactly your standard ESB. Sweetwater does this from time to time and I don't really mind. The bottom line is they make some quality brews, whatever style they may or may not be. Glad I bought a sixer, that's for sure.","ncvbc","Oct 09, 2008"
