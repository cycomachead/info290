"Bottle. Pours a coppery color. I had no idea what style this beer was. It smells so generic it hurts. Caramel malt, some estery aromas. Yep. The first sip did not do this beer any favors in my eyes. Boring. Fruity, caramelly, estery. There's something just a little odd about the flavor that I can't put my finger on either. Medium bodied. Not much bitterness. This one is hard to remember."

"Mouth feel is light with minimal bitterness."
"A dark horse in the land of over the top ales. Over-The-Rhine takes a step back with the intensity, but come out two steps ahead with overall joy."
""
""
"Pretty good(sure I'd drink it again, you buying?), but nothing to write yo mama about."
"I liked most of this experience. If I could find it locally I would buy more."

"Served up in a Moerlein pint at the tap room in OTR.  A very nice malt to hop balance that places this one pretty high on my list."
""
"Poured into a pint glass with about an inch of white khaki head.  Golden orangish copper color, transparent with slight amount of bobbles.  Slightly yeasty spiced smell without almost any of a hop smell, smells, like an amber.  Taste like a amber with a slight toasty taste.  Medium body wi a solid amount of carbs.  This beer does not taste like a pale ale and instead an amber.  Alright beer but not overly that fantastic, very different and more like an amber beer with a slight different hop taste."

"Good mouthful, with creamy smoothness and soft carbonation that givs the impression of a full bodied beer."

"Pours dark amber, close to copper with a 1 finger off white head. A good amount of carbonation is present in this one. Good mix of malts and hops in the aroma. Hints of citrus are hiding, overall smell leans toward bready side. Right off the bat this tastes boozy. It's not at 6.0 ABV, but somehow it feels more. This is very different beer then most pale ales I've had. It's darker than most pale ales as well, Three Floyd's Alpha King shares the darkness. It's a lot heavier to drink than it should be, but this brew just has a special place in my heart."

"It just wasn't enjoyable."

"A very interesting, slightly different APA to me. Big malt quality with a unique, spicy undertone (something with the hops?). Hey, it's always nice to find something tasty, easily drinkable, and somewhat unique in flavor to tickle the ol' beer taste buds..."
""
"While definitely off the beaten path for an American pale ale, I still think this is good; Moerlein tends to take more of the European route with many of the beers, so the flavor profile of this wasn't a total surprise. (Truth be told, I was expecting more of an English style pale ale anyway.) It's slightly miscategorized as an American pale ale in taste profile, but nonetheless, this is an enjoyable and sessionable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - I do not like this APA compared to all the others I've tried."

"O- A good brew. For a pale ale it has some interesting taste characters. It will sneak up on you."
"O: While this is a very malt-forward pale ale, it is nicely balanced by the hops and quite flavorful for the style."

"The beer has all the notes of a standard APA but all in all I didn't enjoy it as much as most APA's. It's actually kind of hard to pinpoint...though the finish isn't exactly what I wanted."
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious, but not so great for the last few sips."
""
"Just an ok beer that I don't really care about having again."
""
""
""
"Avoid at all cost. I took two sips and poured it out."
"O- worth buying again. I love malty/ ocktoberfest beer, this will now join my usual rotation"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable, although not your typical pale ale."
"O - There is a good reason this is Christian Moerlein's flagship ale. As I said with the smells, the beer seems like a tradition. I think this beer would be more suitably classified under ESB. It is certainly not pale in appearance and in malt bill. In the end it is definitely a great choice from a hometown brewery."
"Pours a light copper with a slightly off-white head. Slight amount of fruity malts in the nose, possibly a touch of hops. The taste is mild, but relatively balanced. Not overly sweet like basically all of the other offerings. Just a touch of hops with biscuit, caramel malts. I actually had no idea this was a Pale Ale when I tried it. Mouthfeel is medium with a light-medium carbonation. Overall, I did say this was my favorite, but this is not a great beer by any means. Not sure why they feel like these beers need to be so sweet. This is not like most Pale Ales that I have had. Style is either wrong or brewed poorly."
"It seems light enough to drink multiples of - that's a plus. I would try this again as an extended tasting - a 12 pack."
"A bold, easy-drinking offering from CM, probably the best I've had from the brewery yet. Nice homage to a neighborhood deep in brewing history."
"Overall - A solid pale ale. Pairs well with a variety of foods and at 6% I can have a few and not be completely knocked off my feet."
"Appears a clear copper hue with a light off white khaki head. Forms fine speckled lacing evenly up the sides of my glass. Aroma is very tame with a mild herbal/citric hop accent and light caramel maltiness. Flavor is dominated by sticky sweet carmamelized sugars that simply coat the palate in a very much ovebearingly unbalanced way. The hop bite really doesn't make it across because of the extent of the sweetness of the sticky sweet caramelized malts, maybe in the back end there's a touch of herbal citric hop character but nothing pungently bitter. Mouthfeel may be the worst part it almosts gags me to gulp this down very harsh sticky unrefined caramelized malts on the palate make the whole experience unbearable. Overall this is a really mediocre example of an APA and I question that style branding for a beer called Over the Rhine."
"Bright copper ale with a finger or so of head that leaves wisps of lacing on the glass as it dissolves. Candied grapefruit dominates the aroma, also notice spices and caramel. Tastes of sweet grapefruit, caramel and bread. The reasons that this ale is a favorite among Cincinnatians are apparent."
"This beer is quaffable, but not many. The sweetness really hits a bit too much. But I recommend."
"Tasty and fairly solid but polar opposite of the APA style that I am used to. Still growing on this beer and trying to give the local guys a shot."
"D- 4 This is a well-rounded ale. Very smooth and a good balanced aroma and taste. It leaves me a tad dryer than I'd prefer but a good offering from Moerlein nonetheless. I could enjoy a few of these for sure. One of the best options available at Great American Ball Park!"
"IF you have not had this beer then TRY IT!!"
"Overall: Balanced towards the malty caramel side, but still a good hop punch. I really like this beer, I always get it when I go to Cincinnati Reds games."
"A well thought out beer with good flavor. Recommend with pork dishes and mellow cheeses."
"The drinkabilty is great on this one. Would have no trouble going through these."
"Poured a delightful bright amber/copper. Sweet malt aroma. Very malt-forward, with moderate roasted notes and a touch of cerial sweetness. Hopping was firm, with a subtle pine note. Nicely drinkable - a worthy effort. Other than Northern Liberties, nothing from Christian Moerlein has knocked my socks off, but they are proving to have a solid line."
"Drinkability - This was a nice little beer!!! I was pleasantly surprised. Wasn't sure what to expct, but I came out satisfied. To me this was closer to an IPA than a regular Pale Ale. It was enjoyable and worth a try. I would be happy to pick this up again."
"This is a good APA - not too sweet and not too dry with a lot of hops, but not much bitterness. The balance leaves you wanting more and more."
"An interesting hop bill, with Fuggles and Cascades, but the malt presence here is a bit overbearing."
"Eric"
"Overall, this beer is easy to drink for APA - the huge malt-backbone lends plenty of sweetness to counter the hop spice, but it isn't the most balanced ale."
"Drinkability: This beer is best when cold, but for me it had a very narrow temperature window, after which I did not care for it. So when cold very drinkable, but past that temperature, it becomes a bit of a chore to finish."
"I recently relocated to Cincinnati and found this as a slightly more expensive alternative to macros at a Reds game. When I saw it in my cheap plastic cup I wasn't overwhelmed but realized lacing and head are not ideally presented in this situation. What did catch my taste buds was the full body and lasting flavor.In subsequent trips I have gone straight to this vendor but unfortunately was not as impressed at home when buying the bottled version"
"Good mouth for the type,carbonation could have a bit more zip,a bit more Cascade would add some finish. Not boozy,or real filling,a good 'workday"" beer"
"The drinkability is good, but not one I could see as a session beer even with its relatively low ABV. If I were drinking APA, I would certainly gravitate tp Sierra Nevada in a heartbeat over this one. Good effort, but not my cup of tea so to speak!"
"Overall, this is a decent beer. Drinkable, for sure. The carbonation is going strong, lending a nice flavor-enhancer across the tongue. This would be a great beer for a cool Fall night, or even one for the campfire in the early summer."
"Over the Rhine isn't at all what you might expect from an APA, so I have to dock some for style. However, it's a good beer nonetheless. The German influence really stands out in this beer, I think. Worth a shot, as long as you aren't expecting an aggressively hopped APA."
"Drinkability: I love this beer and could drink it all day, every day all year long; great flavors and a nice sticky mouthfeel, it can be filling/warming and refreshing all at the same time and the moderate ABV makes it perfect for getting through 2-3 in a night."
"Poured from a chilled bottle into a pint glass. The beer is amber colored. It has a lot of carbonation bubbles clinging to the bottom of the glass; every so often one releases and rises to the surface. Atop the beer is a thin tan foam head that quickly disappeared. I can now see the rising bubbles reach the surface and pop. The aroma is sweet and oak-like. There is also an aspect to it that reminds me of cookie dough. The beer is light and malty at first, with a big sweet, finish. It reminds me of melted chocolate chips. I'm not sure the beer is supposed to taste like this...I'm afraid the bottle may have turned. The beer has a lighter body and an average amount of carbonation. There is a little bit of coating, but nothing significant. I'm finding this one a bit hard to drink, but as I said above, I think this may be a bad bottle. I'll have to try another and modify my review as needed."
"The body on this crisp, but it's a tad heavy. The flavor profile of this beer is much maltier than expected. Lots of caramel sweetness, some tea, and a little charring on the finish. Hop presence is surprisingly absent. Bitterness is moderate. This is odd. I guess I'm probably pushing the limits on the the freshness of this bottle (as spring-releases are probably released in the winter), so I could expect the hops to fade. But upon further inspection of other reviews, this seems to be the norm for this beer. I most likely wouldn't chase this one down, but it still was an ok beer."
"Overall-I was not really pleased with this beer, as it does not (in my opinion) adhere to the pale ale genre of beer...I have had the Moerlein IPA and it is much better."
"Overall, just too damn inconsistent. Loved it half the time I spent drinking it, didn't enjoy it as much the other half..."
"pretty easy to drink, it is a pale ale. nothing really ground breaking but a solid APA all around. i would not say no if i stumbled upon this again."
"Over The Rhine Ale is not Christian Moerlein's most accomplished ale and is pretty far off the beaten path for the APA style. That would be fine if it tasted good, but I'm struggling to find anything that would bring me back for a second bottle."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is actually the high point of this beer. Very smooth and rich, aka; just right. This is reasonably drinkable and easy findable around Cincinnati"
"I'm glad I tried it but with the green apple taste I would not purchase it again. Perhaps my bottle came from a batch with some off flavors."
"Honey amber with a creamy tan head that leaves some decent lace on the glass. This beer smells of toffee and butterscotch with an underlying faint fruity, piney note. Toffee maltiness with a bready quality and some nice floral hop flavors to balance. Decent heft and mild carbonation make for an easy drinking ale but not what I look for in an APA, it's more like an English PA."
"This beer is something different than. Your typical pale ale, i feel it has a flavor closer to an old ale/strong ale but with a lower ABV. It's a good beer worth a shot and favorite of many."
"2.5 D: Not a big fan of breadiness in an APA."
"Overall, very drinkable, would make a fine session beer"
"This is my first from this brewery from my first time in Cincinnati and it was a pretty nice offering."
"Drinkability: A reasonably decent, quaffable ale, though, I will say it's the best of the Moerlein's lot that I've had thus far. I will also say that's not saying much."
"I would consider it an ESB though before labeling it as an APA, but hey, it's a good beer, so who cares."
"Light to medium body. Lower carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Not overly exciting, but not bad."
"I can't find any indication of how old this beer is, and I'd really love to hear that it's way better fresh. If I was grading it as an English-style ale, I'd rank it half a point higher across the board. As is, this is not at the top of my list of beers to revisit."
"D: I'm not sure if this is a good session beer or not. The experienced drinker probably wouldn't have a problem putting away a six pack, but I suspect it would get pretty filling. Overall, a pretty unique interpretation of an APA."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Overall a fairly mild version of an APA. Balance is towards malt, as the hop bitterness seems a little too restrained for a pale. That said, if you judge it strictly as an APA it falls short. Other than that it is a very pleasant, enjoyable beer. Smooth, easy to drink. Certainly sessionable. Needs more hop presence to qualify as a decent APA, but might be a better fit in another category."
"D - I could definately try this beer again but was a little let down in the end."
"A good beer that's very drinkable, but not exciting in the flavor department."
"Thanks, kirok1999, for the opportunity"
"This beer is lack luster and boring. The bitterness has less bite then I would like for an APA. A drying of the palate and mouth hole in general also displeases me. A middle of the road beer that is worth a try but not one of my favorites."
"I would recommend this beer to someone that doesn't really like a strong aftertaste or maybe someone that is trying to develop their taste for ales."
"Deep cherry wood amber underneath a thin yet all encompassing film of foam. Only a few sporadic bubbles rising to the top. Carameled crystal malts with just a dash of citrus. Pretty malty smelling APA. Sweet yet dry caramel malts that have a great toasted character make up the malt bill. The hops give some balance to the sweet bready flavors. Maybe a dash of mint julelp. Very clean, malty palate and one of the best session APA's I've ever had."
"Overall, it was an average beer that is just above a non-light BMC. I'd heard good things about this one from a friend but it missed the mark for me. One and done except that I got 3 in the box (can you say extras for trades). Don't recommend unless you can get a free taste. Just too many other great APA's out there to bother with this one."
"This was a good ale. While it's listed as a pale ale, I would say this is more of a straight malt ale that blended its hops and malt nicely. Very solid beer."
"Over-The-Rhine is an unusual offering, but it's quite solid and by the end of my glass I'm rather wishing this was locally available. A unique take on a Pale Ale; this is good beer."
"Bottle from Party Source. The bottle had some weird crustys around the cap after I removed it so that is not a good sign. The beer pours a slightly luminous orange-amber color with absolutely no head or lacing. Also not a good sign. Light malt and pine in the nose. Medium-bodied and fruity with some toasted malt and piney hops flavor, however the flavors are buried by tartness. The finish is tart fruit with a touch of sweet malt. I have to conclude I got a bad bottle, but will need to try again to be sure."
"Poured an amber color, very clear, with a fluffy cream-colored head. The smell was a nice combination of flavors. It was sweet, piney, and buttery all at once, and overall crisp and refreshing. The taste was excellent, full of flavors but well balanced. The dominant taste was the malty flavor, which was bready, buttery, and sweet. And there was a hop presence as well, which had piney and citrus taste to is, and left a pinch of bitterness in the aftertaste (along with a spicey linger). The beer had a smooth, medium body, with little carbonation. All in all, this was a great beer, one that I could sip and savor, yet still keep drinking plenty of it. Recommended."
"Smell is a deliciously citrusy hop combined with a sweet malt smell underneath. Pours to a bright reddish copper color with a big bubble head that disappears quickly. Taste is very sweet and malty without too much hopping evident at the start then building in the middle to the end where a bullion like bitterness comes through. The bitterness is not sharp but earthy. Not much cascade like taste as anticipated from the smell. Very different. I don't really think it is balanced as they state, it is more complex. Definitely quaffable though, they're on the money with this one."
"D - This is a very drinkable pale ale, although it tastes more like an ESB. It's good though so who's arguing."
"D: A highly drinkable ale although I think it fits a little better into the ESB or English Pale Ale category. A quality brew with an interesting blend of both English (malt) and American (hops) influences."
"12 oz Bottle from Beer of the Month Club. Copper pour with a large off white head. Nose of citrus and malt aroma. Taste of apples, citrus hops, malt and faint spices. Really mild finish, definately one that would pair well with food or for a session brew."
"My only concern is that for a pale ale, I think it should have a stronger hop presence, both in flavor and aroma."
"I could drink anywhere between one and eight of these. One is going great with some indian cuisine right now, but this one could also be a good session beer"
"Pours a dark golden amber in color with a nice inch of head forming on the pour. Really looks good in the glass. A little bit of grassy hops in the nose but mostly bready malts are present. Taste is very biscuity, bready malts. Crisp and tasty on the mouthfeel. This is a very good offering. I could drink quite a bit of this."
"A hazy copper colored body hosts a one inch fuzzy light tan head that fades in minutes leaving almost no lace. Nose is a nice soft mix of sweet malt, marmalade and syrupy maltiness. Thick citrus rind notes enter the mouth with some mineral based maltiness and a healthy dose of woodsy almost piney hops all on first sip. This flavor porfile is very unique as it really shows some complexity and flare. Really dont konw where this falls Rye ale, pale ale, wheat maybe, all in one. Mouthfeel is clean and very pleasant. Would make a very good summer beer. Nicely drinkable."
"D: The amount of caramel/toffee taste has the potential to grow tiresome, but this one is still a pleasure to drink."
"This brownish-red beauty is a great beer for any weather and season. It doesn't form much of a head, or cling to the glass very well, but the distinctive color (especially for an APA) is delightful. The sweet malty nose carries this brew onto the palate, where the full-bodied malt is joined and balanced by a complex hoppy note that carries all the way beyond the finish into a pleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is exceptional -- unusually thick (almost jammy) and smooth for an APA. It is a nice beer in warmer weather, but will be even more drinkable in those early autumn days when the warming character of it's 6% ABV and somewhat higher gravity would perfectly balance its modestly carbonated hoppy overtones. In any season, it would be refreshing and drinkable."
"Here's another interesting and tasty brew from Christian Moerlein. I'm very happy that I decided to seek some out."
"Worth a try. Thanks to Pimpp for the sample."
"Amber color with a frothy head and some prickle. It has a hoppy nose that is very pleasant and I would say ""just about right."" Crisp and clean attack with late presenting hops flavor. The mouthfeel is slightly thick but clean. Slightly bitter aftertaste and some faint lemony notes. I would call it a B."
"Decently quaffable."
"D : Good session beer. Real easy to drink"
"The watchwords are basic, balance, and blending, and the result is very enjoyable, with just enough complexity, but not too much to make it busy. It speaks of care and attention to detail. It's smooth, satisfying, and it goes down especially easily. I drink it and I think of old world brewing pride and passion. It's a session beer that anyone, purist or otherwise, can find pleasing."
"D - A tasty beer, very quaffable, but a bit ordinary. I like the flavor it has, just wish it had more of it - Thanks brewdlyhooked13 for this fine ale"
"I would not have pegged this as a pale ale, but whatever it is it is pretty darn good."
"The flavor is a complete surprise after the fresh, vibrant, hoppy nose. I wish the balance of up front hop and supporting malt had been carried through to the flavor. Instead the flavor is just way unbalanced with this way under-attenuated malt character."
"Thanks to Pimpp for this."
"Thanks to pimpp for letting me get a taste."
"I was happy to see an ale introduced by Moerlein so I had to try this beer. Poured an amber brownish color with a light color head. The smell is of nice with a little bit of citrus. The taste brings much maltiness and not enough hops for my liking for an APA."
"D: enjoyable but not what i would want everyday"
"drinkability - Easy drinking beer, enjoyed. My first by this brewery."
"Overall this was not bad at all. I could have thrown this down all night but I stopped to go upstairs to my room and crack a double bastard. But still this was definite quality and I would pick it up again anyday."
"Nice offering from Cincinnat, having grown up in the town its a pleasure to see this old staple come back. A well-rounded beer and would gladly enjoy again; would a good session choice."
"D: Great tasting and very sessionable. This is one of my go-to beers and I love bringing this to poker games and having other want to try it."
"Overall- Like candy, I could drink and drink this til I got sick."
"Final Thought: This to me was a hybrid APA-doppelbock. The balance of malts and hops were about equal and very complementary, a fantastic brew!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a beer that would be good to drink for the duration of an evening. I could certainly drink several of these."
"A copper color with an off white head that is about a quater inch high, but quickly dissolves away. Carbonation is strongly visible in the glass. The sweet scent of malt comes out, along with bread and fruity esters at the end. That sweetness comes out in the flavor it stays with you till almost the very end, when when a mild smck of bitterness crosses the palate. The medium bodied feel starts at the front of each taste, but thins out as it reaches the back of the palate. A strong offering, not what I was expecting from this brewery. Solid flavor, make this a good go to beer when nothing can be found, plus a good cross over beer to get macro drinkers to try."
"This certainly more complex and full-bodied than I thought it would be. I keep thinking I am drinking a quality, more accented ESB."
"Overall I am really impressed by this ale. Wonderful job, and an excellent value at $5.99 a 6-pack."
"Would never have put this beer in the Pale Ale catagory, but this won't keep me from rating this beer highly; it a good beer. The pour brings a typical Pale Ale look, with a more tightyly knit carbonation; promising creaminess and maltyness. The smells bring out a lot of soft malt aromas with some English hops. Flavor prove that maltiness prevails, but with a crisp (Northern Brewer) hop flavor, which proved to be very fresh and palate cleansing. The beer's flavor never reached compexity, but stays pure, clean, and crisp. Nothing to fault here. Only a mild astringency could play a part in lower ratings. Agreed that this beer resembles ESB proportions and character, this may C. M.'s best brew. A great counterpart to a lot of the Oktoberfest beers comming up. I'll certainly have my share."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a very good medium body. The beer has full flavors and doesnt punk out. This beer was very easy to drink and I could see killing a sixer of this no problem. A dam fine brew from a resurgent Moerlein."
"12 ounce bottle, bought from Belmont Party Supply, Dayton, OH. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an amber/copper color with a thick one inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. A nice aroma, mostly grassy/floral hops with a bit of caramel and sweet malt. It tastes the same way to me, but there's more of a balance between the hops and malt in the taste (not that I'm complaining). Good, full flavor. Mouthfeel is full, rich and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's very easy to drink and would be a great session beer. This is definitely one of the best beers I've had lately. If you're looking for a good, drinkable APA with good balance, Christian Moerlein's Over-The-Rhine Ale is a great choice."
"Drinkability: This is on the short list for constant supply in my fridge. This is my new GO-TO beer."
"Good job CM on the OTR! Get some if you can."
"What a wonderful suprise I had when I opened this beer for the first time. The aroma was perfect and it poured very well with a thin head. I love drinking ales, and I really loved drinking this one. The taste was so smooth, a nice balance. A treat I hope all will be able to enjoy."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Creamy and full bodied, they don't get much better than this. Carbonation is in check, lower levels with finer bubbles don't get in the way of the flavor and feel of this brew. This is a brew I'd definitely buy again, however, I'm always looking for something new so it might be awhile."
"I picked up and split with my brother a 6 of this the weekend after it was released, and now I'm wishing I'd gotten another 6. Not quite as hoppy, but a little maltier and considerably darker than I imagined it would be, it's probably my new favorite pale ale. A nice addition to the Christian Moerlein line."
"I had the chance to try this one out during the official first tapping at the make-shift brewpub Christian Moerlein set up at Findley Market. This was a very tasty adult beverage! It was very malty in my opinion and that is a good thing. It has a nice aroma and a lasting aftertaste. My wife did not like it much but what does she know abour beer anyway hehe. Overall, a welcome beer to the Christian Moerlein stable."
"Drinkability - a fine-flavored brew with plenty of session potential. Went very well with some Chipotle chow, chips & salsa on Cinco de Mayo. Impressive offering from CM, their 'craftiest' beer yet, the folks at Oktoberfest will love this in the fall."
