" I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I will be trying more from this company."
""
"I liked this one alot - lots of flavor and body and goes down super easy. Great brew."
"Deep red in color with a brownish hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet toasted malt aroma with dark malt and buttery notes and touch of floral hops as it warmed. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation and a dry finish. Toasted malt flavors up front quickly followed by dark malt with chocolate notes. Earthy floral hop flavors emerge through the middle to the end with buttery and toasted malt character. Finished crisp and dry with light hop bitterness. This was excellent. It reminded me how much I enjoy this style."

"O: the first couple of sips were pretty good, but it became pretty uninteresting pretty quickly. I much prefer the regular ESB. That said, it's still not a bad beer."
""
"O: A good robust ESB for the winter months. The ringwood yeast makes most of Gritty's beers taste alike, and this one is no different. Worth a shot if you like the brewery or ringwood yeast"
""
""
"This has a hoppy malty mix. Dark brown and foaming in color. It has a robust, full-bodiedness that sits nicely on the tongue. There is a faint hoppy aroma. It is rich but mild for a Christmas beer. It is almost a whisper of a Christmas beer. This is probably a good Christmas beer for people who don't like Christmas beers."
""
""
"Pretty robust beer. I forgot this was an ESB. A really big ESB at that. Prickly carbonation. Nice pale and caramel malts, big nice caramel malts, toffee, sugared biscuit balanced by big earthy hop presence. A really great brew."

"o: A good beer overall. Not a huge Gritty's fan, but this one is pretty darn good. Would recommend."
""
""
""
"O: This is close to a tie. The Heavy Seas looked prettier and smelled nicer, but this beer had a comparable taste and a slightly better mouthfeel."
"Highly drinkable, plus a good value."
""
""
"Overall - Really like this Gritty's offering now the hard part Halloween Ale or Christmas Ale? Better yet keep 6 of each on hand."
"Overall, pretty good. Marketed as a winter warmer but definitely feels ESB like mentioned here on BA. It all makes sense now and feels alright."
"O: average for the style, but acutally I liked it and went nicely with some Christmas cookies"
""
""
"O- When I first started drinking beer, this was my favorite. While not a great beer, the sentimental value makes this one of my favorite beers for the holiday season nowadays."
""
"O. good to the style of esb, not your typical christmas or holiday ale but a nice change of pace away from normal spiced up holiday ales."
"Thought for sure this beer would have been much better. The whole idea of the Christmas beers is to have all these spicy rich flavors mixed with some fruits and alcohol all together for one big bang of flavors! I ha this one as my opened on 1-4-11 and to be honest I wasn't sure that I believed I got the right beer. I asked the bar tender about it and they assured me it was the right one. The color was a nice reddish tone, that works for me. The smell was a little spicy but nothing at all strong. And the flavor was just not there. Rather upsetting."
"D: I could drink a few but I wouldn't really want to."
"DB- Not bad, a bit different from what I am used to for the style bust still within the boundaries for the most part."
"The taste has a toasty malts and some biscuit along with a smooth vanilla, buttery flavor. It finishes with a smooth bitterness. Some good hop balance with a robust base."
"Drinkability - I can see having 2-3 of these in a session but certainly not the whole sixer. This is another solid brew from Gritty's. Reminds me a bit of their Halloween Ale, but it's different enough. Glad I got to try it, I might pick up another sixer!"
"D-This is an exceptionaly drinkable beer, and while not the most complex thing on the shelf, is charming in its quality and its drinkability. This reminds me a bit of their Halloween Ale, although I think this may be a tad bit smoother."
"Poured from bottle with freshness date Nov 2010 into tulip glass. Chestnut copper color opaque at top and clears towards the bottom. Sweet caramel smell, but not too strong. Bready, caramel flavor, with hints of raisin. Unique for christmas ales in that it's not really spicy. Crisp dry feel. Easily drinkable espeicially for christmas ales."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a clear dark amber with reddish highlights with a small thick head that slowly goes into a film with very good lacing. Buttery toffee aroma. Slight malty sweetness mixed with a little citrus with a mild hoppy bitterness finish. Really enjoyed this brew. Could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"There was only a trace of foam laying across the top of the beer when it was brought to me. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity and ruby highlights. Nose was much spicier than I anticipated. I liked the intermingling of the cinnamon with some sort of mint, spearmint, perhaps. Definitely not peppermint. Mouthfeel was full with a taste like a chocolate candy cane. Maybe I was wrong about it not being peppermint. It had a minty flavor on the tongue, at any rate. Finish had a breathtakingly minty quality. Damn, was this tasty! Do they bottle this one? Or better yet, put it in a CAN? Very refreshing, in a minty sort of way."
"A dark mahogany color, relatively clear with a fair off-white head and little sign of lacing. The aroma offers deep malt and light peach hops and juniper. The flavor brings malty licorice evergreen, slightly resinous but generally on the light side and fairly drinkable. The hop goodness is sweet and there's a bready barley-malt base with a touch of licorice. Though slightly different from the bottle version, still a very solid holiday brew."
"d-"
"D- Pleasant, easy to drink, a nice example of an American ESB. There's a tug of war between the tea-like hoppiness and the sweet malt."
"Last time I had this it was perfectly balanced between malt and hops. Good butter flavor from the Ringwood yeast. Biscuity malt flavor. But it seems that the Ringwood yeast in this bottle dominates too much and the balance of the previous bottle I had has been lost."
"This is one of the December craft beers of the month at West on Centre, a local restaurant in West Roxbury. Served in the bottle and poured into a pilsner style glass. Dark brown color with a medium sized head. Smelled of cinnamon and pine trees. Taste was perfect for this time of year: nutmeg, brown sugar, and other Christmas spices. Much heartier mouthfeel than other Xmas ales on the market. Due to its rich body and robust flavor, it may not be the best beer to pair with dinner. More of a dessert beer. A great cold weather, holiday brew. I just wish I could find more of it."
"The feel of this beer is just right got this time of year. It has a bit more of a body than a fall of summer beer. It's something to have during the holiday season that is a bit more filling but drinks really well."
"It is very drinkable and smooth for the amount of bitterness. I have had more unique winter ales, but this one has a strong sense of completion and flavor character which is memorable."
"A really nice beer. Heavy on the caramel for an ESB, but the hops provide a nice balance. Not sure if i love the dark fruits, presumably from high lovibond crystal, but overall a solid beer."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked November 2010. Sampled on December 10, 2009. The pour is an attractive ruby red with excellent clarity and ab out a quarter inch light tan head that fizzles after a couple moments. The aroma is moderately hopped with a variety of bitter scents along with caramel malts. A mouthfeel that can be characterized as medium to heavy and maybe a tad creamy. The taste is more like a stong ale and less like a spicy Christmas ale but it is likeable. Gritty McDuff's makes a decent bitter ale and this is a slightly more pungent variation on their most recognized recipe."
"12 oz. bottle with November '09 notched; sampled March '09. Brewed with UK pale and crystal malts, roasted barley, Cluster, Styrian and Yakima Goldings, and Saaz hops. OG 1.064, FG 1.016, 28.5 IBUs. The beer is a crystal-clear dark ruby, with low carbonation and a finger of tan head. Little sweet in the nose, malty, with fruity alcohol, floral hops and dark crystal malts. Similar on the palate, with leafy/floral, almost spicy hops, sweet crystal malts, a hint of roast and a sturdy bitterness. Flashes of alcohol here and there. It has a medium body with medium carbonation and a dry finish. This beer is a nice blend of ESB and winter warmer characteristics that, while not a quaffer, is definitely not a sipper either. A tasty winter ale."
"A little round in the mouth, balanced by a wheat-like taste and some crispness in the carbonation. Finishes pretty well. Again, like an IPA with winter spices. Hard to argue with a few of these."
"This is definitely one of Gritty's best offerings. Similar to the Halloween Ale, but better, with a different hop profile and more maltiness."
"I think I prefer the Halloween Ale a bit more even though they are quite similar, so if you enjoyed that beer from Gritty's then you'll definitely enjoy this one as well."
"Pours a deep amber-red with nary a head to be found. Carbonation is very subdued. Malty aroma with little hops detected. Taste is on the malty side, hops are way in the background. A somewhat cloying sweetness, diacetyl seems a little out of control resulting in a butterscotch aftertaste. I don't really care much for this beer and would not purchase it again."
"Served on-tap at the Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine. The beer is a clear brown color with hints of ruby. Almost no head, just a skim of bubbles on top. The aroma isn't anything significant, just some maltiness and a few spices, but nothing strong enough to identify. The flavor is driven by the malts. It has a molasses sweetness present throughout. There are some bitter spices the make their way forward in the flavor near the end (although they are present as soon as you taste the beer, they aren't as strong). There is a crisp clarity to the flavor that also has some esters. It has a fairly light body and maybe a slightly above medium amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer; there is nothing about it that you could grow tired of. I feel that the Gritty's Christmas is a pretty unique winter beer in the Portland microbrew landscape. It isn't strong like the Shipyard Prelude or Geary's HSA, nor is it full of winter spices like the Geary's and Shipyard's standard winter ales. And for that, it is a recommendable session beer for those cold Maine nights."
"Cheers!"
"I was absolutely blown away by this seasonal having it off cask. It was an awesome experience, a total flavor explosion that cannot be re-created via a bottle from a 6 pack, although still delicious. When I say it smelled like a bouquet of flowers...dammit, I'm telling you it did!! Always a huge fan of this Gritty's seasonal and probably my favorite with the Halloween Ale a close 2nd."
"M/D - overall not a bad beer, its easy to drink, but I guess I was expecting more in the spice department, something more holiday like."
"I guess this is winter warmer meets esb. Robustly bitter at the end with hints of the spice of a winter warmer. Initial hit is nicely balanced with the malt predominating the taste in the middle. Then the bitters kick in, like a good esb."
"thanks donkeyrunner"
"Off the tap this one was a deep garnet color with a light beige/off white head that left nice lacing of the collar. The aroma was grainy and dry, roasted malt and sweet malt with some general hops. The flavors were similar, lots of caramel malt and roasted malt with a bitter hops finish. Rather standard but pleasant enough. My main complaint was it had nothing particularly Christmas-like about it. The mouthfeel was a little light for the style, the carbonation was good and the body medium/full."
"Drinkability: a decently filling and warming beer for winter, but one that definitely allows for a second pint."
"Not a bad ESB overall. The biggest flaw is the hop flavors for the most part. The citrus flavors are watery and overshadow some of the very pleasantly dry, rich malt flavors. I would order another if I was in the mood for an ESB."
"Enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Very good. I usually don't like winter ales but this one is quite drinkable. Pretty complex and smooth. A beer worth drinking in multiples."
"Heck yes! My girlfriend got this for me along with some other random singles - and I probably never would've ever bought this. This is incredibly drinkable, and is extremely sessionable. If you're looking for a nice candied warmer to drink a few of - reach for this!"
"Very nice, deep bronze color. Fairly decent aroma-malty with a slight metallic odor. Solid malt flavor with an adequete hop bite. Somewhat fruity. Still with the metallic twinge. Lingering bitterness in the finish. Decent enough body, slightly creamy and fairly smooth. Really a notch above average overall."
"Poured like a root beer color with a small white head. Nose was very faint. Taste has maybe some cinnamon or nutmeg with some graininess and a faint metallic twang to it. A little thinner bodied than I expected. Not my first choice for a warmer but worth a shot"
"This beer poured a deep chestnut, with some ruby highlights to it. The is clear throughout with a fine, thin head. There is a slight reminent of lacing. Nose has a touch of caramel-like malt, and spices but hops are more prevalent. Flavor has some caramel aspects, hops, and spices. Medium body with low carbonation. Mouthfeel was great - not too light, not too heavy. This would be an excellent session beer!"
"The taste is nicely balanced. The beer is a bit creamier than crisp, but the traditional malts blend nicely with some spiceness. There is a good amount of caramel, butterscotch, some spices perhaps in the allspice family, some drying hop presence towards the finish. The beer is a traditional interpretation of an English ESB, with a nice efforvesence in the mouthfeel, a nice drying finish, slightly bittering hops coupled with the nice buttery diacetyl. A nice find. L'Chaim"
"Good drinkable beer."
"This is another interesting Christmas ale and a very enjoyable ESB. It's also my first offering from Gritty and I'll definitely be trying to find some others."
"D - This is a great winter beer... Above average in all categories and slightly unique in terms of typical winter beers... Highly drinkable and still sessionable at 6.2% ABV... I had never heard of this beer or brewery prior to receiving this as part of a recent SEPA case split, but am highly impressed with my introduction to Gritty McDuff..."
"D - it went down pretty easy."
"Pours a clear deep amber hue with a thick two finger light khaki colored head that takes a while to die down to a thin layer of foam. A fair amount of sticky lacing remains on the sides of the glass, a nice looking beer for sure. Typical ESB smell with some butter, caramel malts, and floral hops. A sweet nutty aroma with a good amount of earth in the nose as well. Taste starts with some spicy hops, toffee, and tart apples. Midway some roasted malts and biscuits emerge. Aftertaste is slightly metallic with some gritty hops and a sweet nutty flavor. Medium body with a creamy feel and a stronger than needed carbonation. A nice drinking ESB, but I do prefer the Halloween Ale to this."
"D: Pretty drinkable as the malt mixing is really nice."
"D: I was hoping for a touch more hoppiness in the smell and taste, but the lively mouthfeel more than made up for it. Enjoyable."
"The aroma is malty with a toasted malt, caramel, nuts, hops, and yeast. The appearance is amber brown with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma and slightly watery. The flavor is decent but not great. The palate is smooth from the carbonation but too thin. Overall I am not that crazy about it but I can drink it."
"More drinkable than most holiday brews due to subtlty of xmas spices. Good beer."
"D: Good for a try at best as with most xmas beers but not one you want to continually drink. A fair and good drink overall with its warm and toned down nature lets you enjoy this without being assaulted by a barrage of spices that distracts from the flavor."
"This beer is really drinkable, a pretty good ESB. If you've tried the Halloween beer, this one is very similar to it. I liked this one better though."
"pours a reddish brown in color small light tan head and minimal lacing. faint smell mostly of roasted malt and touch of caramel. crisp and dry tasting on the palate with a roasted malt and slightly bitter hop finish. easy to drink and a enjoyable christmas ale."
"This a beautiful beer.. pours a deep red with a nice head to it. Taste is somehow subtle, yet present all the way through the drinking in a good way. No overly abundant tastes that stand out but juts lots of hops and malts shining through making for a great tasting beer. A unique beer and I'm glad I got to try it out.. super drinkable."
"Rich, very thick, creamy, and full-bodied mouthfeel, however drinkability took a slight hit due to the presence of alcohol on the tongue..."
"Drinkability: Nothing bad, but I could definitely stand a bit more -- more of everything. Even if I get my ass thrown onto Santa's Naughty List I just had to speak my mind about it. Perhaps the oil crunch is hitting us, even Jolly Old Saint Nick, in ways we never could have imagined, but I have a sneaky suspicion he's holding back."
"Bee-aye #2800"
"Gritty McDuff's Halloween Ale is good and Gritty McDuff's Christmas Ale is equally tasty. Two beers probably aren't enough for a sweeping generalization to be made, but this brewery appears to be solid. I'd love to see what else they can do."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer, i don't think i am into ESB beers, interesting spice taste to it."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a dark amber color. Voluminous off-white head, settled to a quarter inch and ending in a thin layer of foam. Sticky lacing adhered to side of glass during the tasting. Scent of hops and something sweet; I would have to reiterate the burnt toffee described in previous reviews. Taste similar to nose with perhaps a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon. Very pleasant mouthfeel - a bit of carbonation, but also a smooth, full-bodied feeling. I really like this offering from Gritty's and would definitely consider this an excellent seasonal session brew."
"The beer pours a ruby red/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet, burnt toffee scent along with a light hop aroma. It's dry with a nice roasted character. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth, crystal malt flavor along with a nice bitter hop element. This seems a bit malty for a bitter, but it tastes good. There is a roasted malt element as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer and a fine seasonal, but a marginal ESB at that."
"The taste is toffeeish with an earthy, minty hop background. Near full-bodied, it is a tasty, well-balanced, very easy drinking ale. The alcohol is just enough to give it a nice warming touch without interfering in the taste or drinkability."
"Drinkability: nice beer to drink on a cold day that isn't an alcohol bomb. Definitely enjoyed this one and could drink several of these in a session."
"Not the most full flavored ESB but it seems to be well balanced with a nice assortment of hearty festive flavors for the holidays, plus it drinks pretty well."
"I've been impressed with the few offerings that I've tried from Gritty McDuff's. Their Halloween Ale renewed my interest in ESB's and prompted my renewed interest in balance over extreme. Not being a huge fan of winter warmers, I'm very pleased to see them stick with the ESB style that they do so well."
"Pours a bright, cherry-mahogany brown with a good-sized head that fades to almost nothing quite quickly. The nose is sweet nickel, caramel malts and a light, seemingly Ringwood note. On the palate, dry malts play with sour English ale notes. There is a bit of malt bitterness (roasted malts?) in the back. Hops come out toward the end, but never achieve any really juicy, tasty volume levels. Mouthfeel is a touch acidic (in a good way), but the malts are not fleshed out very well and the carbonation is just medium -- which in this case seems either too weak or too strong, but not just right. Overall, this is an inoffensive beer but also a very mediocre one."
"Drinkability - obviously this was a loser but for the head. A total yawn fest. If I'm offered one gratis I'll review this one again, but c'mon Gritty, you can do much better than this."
"Overall the beer was decent. It is a good beer to sit and enjoy in little Pat's Pizza in Orono Maine on tap."
"There are no flaws in this beer, yet I believe that it is not anything more than middle of the road. I can enjoy it, but am not overjoyed by it."
"Steve"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I had a feeling this was going to taste a lot like their Halloween Ale but while there are some similarities, it's not close to it as I thought it would be. This is a good hearty winter seasonal that's worth drinking for while."
"·	Drinkability: Likely sticking to one of these Grittys. Seems to be fairly consistent with esbs, with which my tasting experience is limited."
"Pours a dark ruby-red color with a one-finger head. Aroma is kind of spicy with a subtle bitterness in the nose. The taste is bitter with some spiciness upfront and fades to a bitterness at the back of the tongue. A second sip confirms many of the same characteristics. It is definitely a bitter but for some reason, I can't really taste much beyond. A decent, drinkable bitter that goes well on a cold winter night."
"Not bad overall. This is an ESB with a bit of a kick to it, but is still fairly tame and simple overall. Well worth a try."
"Drinkability- A delicious brew one I highly recomend."
"Overall- The 2007 batch just hit the stores. Not bad. I'll be drinking this on tap from the brewpub when I go up to Portland."
"D- Can't ask for any better from an ESB for drinkability. Overall a good example of the style."
"Note - This beer seems more belgian dubbel in style to me than ESB. Mabye they change the recipe from year to year - I will have to do some investigating. Not a bad beer if you are into this style, but it doesn't really do it for me tonight. I would probably pass if I came across it again."
"Leftover christmas beer from Jess's Market here in town. Pours quite dark brown. Smells a bit nutty but not very strong. Tastes like sweet malt, a bit of nutty flavor and finishes a little bitter but all very well balanced. A pretty decent beer. If I can find more (which I probably can) I'll get more."
"Notes: If you like ESBs or English Brown Ales, you can't go wrong with this beer. It's not extreme in any way or terribly unique, but it's a decently balanced, malty beer that is pretty drinkable. It seemed to go very well with smoked cheddar cheese."
"Thick and syrupy. Feels like a liqueur or non-beer. Too sweet to have too many of these."
"Picked up a sixpack of this yesterday, and decided I'd try it on tap at Cole's to see what it's like ""fresh"" and ""as intended"" before opening a bottle. The pint arrived dark -- darker than expected for a purported ESB, at least -- a ruddy bronze witha yellowed-parchment, creamy-dense foam cap. Aromas of candied orange peel and buttermints, some caramel maltiness, and a whiff of bergamot-infused tea leaves. Sturdy flavor, with mild citric and leafy-spice hops, candied citrus fruit rinds, and just a dash of butterscotch/caramel. This seems pretty typically ""English," except there's just a bit too much spicy bite to the hops. Also, the mouthfeel is far too heavy to be mistaken for anything other than an American craft beer. It's big, imposing, and slick -- almost syrupy. Much bigger mouthfeel than most ESBs I've tried. This is not actually a bad thing for a winter seasonal, but it would be a bit thick for any other time of year (I noticed the bottles I bought are supposed to hold up through September 2007). But since the timing is right, I call this one suitably and seasonably drinkable right now."
"Poured into a pint glass. Looked like a root beer in color, slightly browner than a cola. Poured a nice 1 finger head that lasted about 1/2 the beer with lacing during the rest of the beer. Had a slight cream aroma to the smell. Nothing really stood out about the taste, either bad or good. Slight undertones of something in the flavor I couldn't place. Felt fine in the mouth, and fairly easy to drink. Not my first choice for a flavorful beer, but no complaints at all."
"A very nice, drinkable christmas beer that doesn't go over the top with spices and the like."
"Cheers!"
"Dark copper body with ruby-red highlights and a little over an inch of offwhite head. Smells roasty with some diacetyl. Scent is not that strong. Tastes roasty, malty, yeasty with hints of spice and diacetyl. Medium in body. Tasty little brew. I like it, though not as much as I like the Halloween ale."
"Great roasted malt with a bitter grainy aroma. Hints of sweet bread-like and slight raisin smell. Has a nice dark clear copper color. Head started off great but fizzled out to almost nothing with half a minute. No real lacing present. Has the typical Gritty's signature of a fizzy carbonation. The taste isn't really bitter but the after-taste has a lingering bitterness in the throat. This is somewhat drinkable, although I probally wouldnt buy it again. It is very average and just about straight 4's. A bit watery on the mouthfeel and looks thicker than it is. Has a very light fizzy texture in the mouth and goes down smooth. The 6.20ABV is well-hidden and might sneek up on you. Overall it is average, but worth a try. I expected something stronger from a winter Christmas Ale."
"Great to see Gritty McDuff brews now available in wny,poured a deep rich bronze with a hefty tight 1 one finger slight off white head.Fruity yeasty aromas along with some caramel and biscuity malt a tad of butter,flavors seem to be malt tilted somewhat buttery and caramelly with some orange-like fruitiness a lighter leafy hop hits in the finish.A sustaining malty brew quite flavorful a few years ago this would have been it for me that is until I found the blessed hop,as is I still really enjoyed this brew."
"Pours a deep rich copper. Thin tan head, with some retention, and just a bit of lacing. Smell is malty,and spicey. Body is medium with some carbionation. Taste is sweet,spicy,and fruity up front.With a decent warming finish,with a bit of hopps. Merry Christmas!"
"Pours a clear deep dark mahogony red with a large tan foamy head. The head leaves just alittle lacing,but otherwise this is a good looking beer. The smell is a little on the slight side with pine, cinnamon,butter,hops, and other Christmas spices. The taste is a mixture of hop pine and bitterness with holiday spices. A very good mixture makes this a nice drinkable beer. A real Holiday treat."
"This is a very easy to drink beer that doesn't over power you with spices like other Christmas beers."
"Pours a dark copper with a nice initial head that dissipates quickly.Smell is butterscotch, grass and a touch of malt. Flavor is initially maltyt, then exapnds in a lightly bitter quality, with a slight butter quality..very nice. Mouthfeel is medium with a dryness on the finish that is very good. Smooth enough to rate higher than average on teh drinkability scale."
"This beer is pretty drinkable. Good session beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head over the clear dark amber/copper brew, which has some leafy floaties in it, not sure what's up there. Dense head lasts nicely, with heavy foamy lacing. Aroma is ample grains, with a bit of butteriness, it would seem. Taste is malty, with some dark fruitiness, medium bitterness, and a bit of a weird aftertaste. Hearty grains, a shot of dark fruits, with a dry finish and lingering warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability fine, just that aftertaste kind of quashes things a bit. Not bad, but frankly on-site is the place to drink Gritty's brews, esp on cask."
"Ya gotta love these combo packs. You get to try three or four beers in one 12 pack. This winter seasonal has a nice red color with a small head. It has a predominately spicy aroma. The taste is a sweet malty flavor, with a little hops thrown in. Nice mouthfeel, only a little carbonation. I liked this beer, but I drank it after Gritty's Scottish ale, and it suffers in comparison."
"Sampled from a 22oz bottle. Dark red colored body with a tall off white fluffy head that gives the glass a decent coating of lace. Aroma is very mild with spice and caramel malts. Light fruit notes as well as some bitterness. The taste was similar with sweet malts and fruits being complemented by a light spiciness. Some chocolate notes were noticeable at times. Finished off caramel fruit with a light spice. Solid body and pretty smooth. Easy enough drinking though the mildness of it could make it a boring drink early in a session. Overall though a decent brew."
"M & D: The mouthfeel is pretty good although its not as bitter as I thought it was going to be, being an ESB. I was hoping for more of a heavier beer with a load more taste. Not a bad one though, probably would have a few of these."
"A clean dark amber beer. Has a big dark beige head. Big malty aroma with strong caramel overtones. The malty sweetness starts at the tip of your tongue the the caramel background hugs the sides of your tongue. The finish is anice smooth and easy bitterness down the back of your throat."
"On cask at the GLB this past weekend...I wonder if the serving style left out out all the holiday spirit? Medium dark amber when served, it came topped with a white frothy head. Aroma was mostly all caramel, with some diacetyl getting through. Tastewise: no spice. Bready malt. Low hops in finish. Lacks pizazz. Is this all I'm going to get from Santa? I must have been real bad this year."
"A very hearty, warming ESB. This is fantastic. I love beer in this style, and this is a great example. Plenty of fruitiness, with a lovely malt character and terrific hop balance. My only complaint is that I only have two bottles. I'm very happy with this beer."
"Drinkability: Very good. Nice and flavorful with a good malt backbone and enough hops to clean the sweetness. Overall a very solid ale."
"The beer pours from the 22 oz. bomber a limpid deep ruby color with the head mountainous in size and semi-creamy in texture, the color a beautiful light tan with the lace a thick and glutinous sheet to meld with the glass. Sweet malt dominates the nose, citrus like crispness with hints of green apples, light floral hop aroma present, start is thickly malt and sweet, top is moderate to full in feel. Finish is quite hop spicy and the carbonation brisk, very dry and the hops stay with you till the very end, quite a quaffable tis true, another great brew from a favorite brewery, I thank the grand old man of Maine bennybrew for this bottle."
"Pours with a two-fingered head and leaving a good lace. Beautiful, clear amber/ruby color. Nose is fruity and slightly sweet. Starts with a sweet mix of hops and malt, finishes hoppy. A different Christmas Ale - no spices. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. The ABV is 6.2%."
"Taste is also fruity followed by strong hops. really fruity sweet malt but nice strident hops to balance it out. Mouthfeel is really sticky witha nice hoppy aftertaste that lingers nicely on the tongue. Not bad for drinkablility but a bit too sweet for a real session brew. I might get this if I was out but probably won't keep it around the house. Too sweet for my liking."
"649"
"Another quality seasonal from Gritty's.  Copper color with a foamy lace around the glass.  The taste is clean and full with a nice bitterness and a spicy hop profile.  Very well brewed and tasty."
"Notes: Sizeable and hearty ESB … full to capacity of malt, yeast and hop flavours. One of the best Gritty brews I have had to date and a great brew to end of the night with."
"This Gritty's brew is a full-sensory stimulant, makes you love the complexity and intricacies of beer.  This onslaught on the senses does wear on you, but must be enjoyed whenever available.  Cheers!"
