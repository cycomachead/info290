3.07,-14.2,3.75,3,3,3.25,3,"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and I thought it was an average example of the style, it really didn't seem to Scotch Ale like, it reminded more of an average English ale, especially with that fruity English ale yeast flavor sticking out the most.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, not too crisp, not too filling, but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and one would be enough for me, the flavors doesn't want to me make drink another one.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance it was a pretty nice looking beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the balance, I wish the caramel malts showed up more and the fruity yeast showed up  less.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, but I wouldn't turn it down, it just isn't something that I'm that into.  I can't say I would recommend this beer, it doesn't have any aspect that makes it stand out.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and in the end I wanted better balance from it.  It's on the lower end for this brewery and it's in the middle for the style.  I appreciate the effort, but this one just isn't for me, better luck next time.","StoutHunter","Jan 28, 2015"

A little tempting sweetness from alcohol on that nose .  Like sticky brown bread.  Caramel, earth and  dark fruits.  Taste is malty and sweet. Dry and with a bit of spice on the finish.  No alcohol on the palate. Mouthfee lis easy going medium.  This drinks so well. The breadiness , the carbonation and the dryness are a delight alongside the fruitiness and the rich malt and   caramel. it's like a nice sweet bread.","utopiajane","Jan 24, 2015"

The beer has a nice balance between malt and hops and sweetness, but it’s pretty forgettable once finished.  As a Brooklyn Brewery fan, I’m glad I tried it, but I probably won’t get it again, as there are much better Brooklyn beers out there as much better winter beers out there as well.  That being said, I’d certainly not turn this beer down if offered and would certainly enjoy it.","Jeffreysan","Jan 14, 2015"

Brooklyn Winter Ale has a rich smell. It is full of  flavors and sweetness. You pick up on some grains and malts in the smell of this brew. The taste is bold with flavor. Also in the taste , you pick up on malts and grains and some hops at the end. The mouthfeel is rich, bold , and smooth.  This brew has a strong,bold aftertaste.  There is a lot going on in this brew, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Brooklyn Brewery did a nice job with this brew.  I would get buy this brew again.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Jan 09, 2015"

Pours fairly crystal clear ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, apple, molasses, brown sugar, light roast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, apple, molasses, brown sugar, light roast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, apple, molasses, brown sugar, light roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/yeast balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Scottish ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 10, 2014"

3.2,-10.6,4.5,3.25,3,3.5,3,"BBD 3/22/14. Pours a clear nice red hued amber with a reasonable head and lacing that fades in 2 minutes. Light nose of molasses over dark fruit - plum with a touch of raisin. The body is medium with good carbonation. The mouthfeel is borderline smooth with a carbonation level above average. The flavor profile is weak - something a Scottish ale should never be. A weak hint of caramel malt and an alcohol presence is all there is over a very light sweetness. The finish is crisp, again, something a Scottish ale shouldn't be.","tillmac62","Feb 06, 2014"

It basically a straight session amber ale. I don't have much experience with Scottish ales, but this one does fulfill the expectation of being malt-forward and not super hopped. I enjoyed having this on tap but I can't say I'd jump at the chance to have it again unless it was the only craft offering at a bar.","illpass78","Jan 22, 2014"

Color was a deep-brown with garnet highlights among the NE-quality clarity. A second pour released some lees hiding at the bottom of the bottle and while I did not mind, it may be something for others to be mindful of. Best Before Date read "4123117080220" but it was indecipherable even to my cryptographic mind. Nose smelled medicinal, like a combination of molasses and anise. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching, but not achieving creaminess. The taste was primarily of molasses, but it was nowhere near as sharp as it was on the nose. Finish was semi-dry, as though the fermentable sugars had been mostly converted, but it was still too sweet for my taste. It kind of reminded me of the finish of a traditional English barleywine.

In the taste, buttery and toffee like. Some grassy hops. Mild scotch style malts, but overall more akin to a uninspired English pale ale than anything. Light to medium bodied. Overactive yeast strain coats the mouth. Overall, a less than average beer with way too much diacetyl and butter to be palatable. Heavily rated scotch ale (over 600 reviews), the recipe must have been better in the past. This is a below average offering in every way. Avoid.","Stinkypuss","Jan 19, 2013"

Consumption of the beer leaves lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is sweet and roasty from the malt. There is an earthy hop aroma as well, but it's not strong. The flavor of this beer displays a strong malt backbone. There's mild caramel sweetness and good roastiness and nuttiness. The earthy hops are there in the back and provide some balance.

5,39.7,5,5,5,5,5,"Comments: Thank you Garrett Oliver! Brooklyn’s Winter Ale is a wonderful example of Scottish ale. The web says this beer is 6.0% abv, however my bottle says 6.1% abv. The nominal strength is half a percent lower than guidelines for a Wee Heavy, but 1% abv more than an 80/- Scottish Export. All things said, Winter Ale taste like a Wee Heavy. Most importantly it avoids the two most common failings of American craft-brewed beer. First, it’s not too hoppy. Most American craft-brewers, especially those on the west coast, use far too many hops, even in beer styles in which it would be inappropriate. Second, Oliver doesn’t use whisky malt in this beer. Almost every other example of American craft-brewery’s Scottish ale uses this peat smoked whisky malt. This is simply inappropriate for a true Scottish ale. It is Scottish ale, not Scotch whisky. I can’t think of a better example of an American craft-brewed Scottish ale.","160Shillings","Mar 02, 2012"

The nose comprises caramel, mandarin orange syrup, light spruce, very light honey, and a particularly small twinge of Laffy Taffy-style strawberry hidden in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch of graham cracker to round things out. I may or may not detect a pinch or two of nutmeg and brown sugar as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very lightly chewy feel.

Light for a winter ale, but not too light. The tastes backup the aroma with bready malt and round rich caramel. The beer finishes with needed and well executed balance provided by the hops in the form of both spice and bitterness.

Taste is spot on for the style and is almost perfect, sweet, then a bit of earthiness and a dry slightly bitter finish. This otherwise very nice beer fails in the mouthfeel and carbonation for me.

Other notes are figs, wheat bread, some sour dark fruits, mild oaky bourbon barrel, and some faint chocolate found way in the back. Really nice velvety mouthfeel and a touch of carbonated crispness.

3.95,10.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours into the glass calmly, not much carbonation. In order to kick the head, the pour needs to be vigorous and down the middle of the beer. A medium caramel colored head appears with smallish bubbles indicating a strong ale. The head falls apart and disappears within two mintues. Swirling the glass brings the head back up. The look of the ale indicates good weight, small bubbles rise slowly and create the head. The ale is a beautiful amber color, very clear with no cloudy notes. The bouquet is mostly hop dominated: some musty wet dog notes, wet stone/concrete and in the background is subtlely sweet caramel malt aromas. In the mouth, the ale is a medium weight ale with great balance between sweet malty notes and bittering hops. Theres not much complexity but the nice hop finish make this a good drink. This is a winter beer that you can have perhaps more than one.","ultrastrong","Dec 30, 2006"

I would not want two back to back, but I find myself liking the faintly metallic aftertaste, the spice, the way that it slowly warms, and changes as it warms.

Very typical to the style, but I prefer Sam Adams my home homebrew a bit better. Hints of coriander, cinnamon, plums? with a bit of hotness to it. A bit of a bitter aftertaste. Not bad, but there's better ones out there in my opinion.","Backer2004","Nov 15, 2006"

3.38,-5.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Light aroma of cinnamon and malt. Smooth and even mouthfeel with moderate to low carbonation leads to flavors of caramel and toasted malt and understated cocoa, some currant and smoke and a bit of hop bitters riding beneath. Finishes a bit tannic and powdery.","far333","Nov 10, 2006"

3.64,1.7,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"I'm not sure this is the same version othere have tried. Mine was 6% abv, and totally new to my local area as of 11/1/06. Purported to be a Scottish style ale, it is dark mahaogany, smells of authentic Maris Otter malts, but the taste backs down where the aroma steps out. Chewy sweet malt, barely balanced by restrained hops as per the style. A little more yeasty/ fermentation complexity would be appreciated by me if the style is a malt-accented ale. Otherwise a solid attempt at a traditional style beer, which is what I understand Garret Oliver's chief aim is with his beers. He is certainly the chap to give it one of the best tries that any Yank can.","dedrinker","Nov 02, 2006"
