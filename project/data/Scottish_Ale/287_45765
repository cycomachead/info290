The beer is fairly dry, so it's gone before you realize it. I'd say get some. It's pretty awesome!","ThomasMetal75","Jan 11, 2015"
3.39,-5.3,4,3,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Pours a clear medium amber producing 2 fingers of beige, frothy, somewhat lasting, head that leaves a super coating of pasty lacing. Aroma is lightly toasted pumpernickel bread, caramel apple with hints of butter, roasted nuts, floral hops & a faint earthiness. Taste is similar to nose with more toast, apple fruitiness & floral hops. Pepper, Graham crackers & dark honey are added. The bitterness is nicely balanced with the toasted maltiness. Finishes wet but faintly dry (if that makes sense) & peppery with toast that becomes a toasty, dark tea like bitterness in the aftertaste. No smoke or burnt notes/hints detectable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied & moderately carbonated & lightly prickly.","mothmanscott","Jan 11, 2015"

Sediment is seen at the bottom of the bottle around the edges. The aroma is of malts for the most part with some spice. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with some hops with a hint of orange also. The finish is slightly dry but not bad. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew.

Popping the top I get a nice deep zesty caramel waft.  Pours to a light root beer color with a thin tan head.  On the taste this brew has good mouthfeel, thick but not syrup tick.  The taste is a consistent slightly spicy, flatly bitter yet with bits of sweet caramel coming through.  Not really dominant in one flavor or another, balanced and contrite.  Would have expected a little darker a little spicier for a Christmas beer along the lines of a winter warmer, but its imbibeable.","mooseisloose","Dec 25, 2014"

Once you settle in with this beer it grows on you.  Good alternative to huge and/or spiced Xmas beers.","BikeChef","Nov 28, 2014"

3.68,2.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 10/22/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, plum, caramel, toasted bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, plum, caramel, toasted bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, plum, caramel, toasted bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant Scottish ale style. All around good robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 15, 2014"

It's a bit of a change of pace from your typical Winter Warmer/Spiced up ales the Christmas season brings us, but there is still a place for Bell's Christmas. It's of the same mold as their Year Round Amber ale, but still different enough to create its own fan base. This is something I could drink any cold evening. Again, a different take, but still very very good.","BradtheGreat7","Nov 28, 2013"

3.71,3.6,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured a cloudy amber orange with a thin ring of white head and a lot of chunks of yeast floating around. Not exactly the best looking beer, kind of homebrew-esque. Scents of sweet malt, grape juice, sugar cookies and some faint floral hops and perfume in the background. This seems like a lot of aromas, but its actually a very subdued scent, and its pleasant in its own way. Flavor begins with dry, cracker-like malt flavors and some toasty malt with a moderate level of hop bitterness, mostly floral, but with some slight bitter citrus zest in the background. Toasty malt becomes more apparent in the middle of the sip, with some yeasty flavors, pine resin and faint apricot towards the end. The finish is semi-dry, with a slight bit of sweet malt. The aftertaste is dry, with floral hops dominating. Its a pretty good flavor profile, though more dry and bitter than the aroma hinted. There is also a bit more toasted malt than sweet malt, which the aroma certainly didn't let on to. Its good though. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, a little chunky from the yeast, but also slightly watery with moderate carbonation and a drying mouthfeel. Its an odd, almost paradoxical combination of feelings, but it works, and the mouthfeel certainly doesn't make it hard to drink. Overall this is a decent beer. Its doesn't have the most complex aroma or flavor out there, but what it does it does pretty well. Its got a nice bitter, dry and toasted flavor which is good for Winter and it doesn't load up on sweetness and spice like a lot of Christmas beers. I enjoyed it for what it is, a good, modestly hoppy and toasty beer.","Auraan","Nov 27, 2013"

Light medium body. Well carbonated. Taste is well balanced with the focus being on spice - nutmeg and ginger - which become more pronounced as the beer warms. Hops are present, but in the background and compliment the spices. Finishes cleanly with a slight hop bitterness that lingers along with the spices - ginger being most prevalent. Addition of dark malt would make this beer outstanding.","tillmac62","Nov 13, 2013"

Just a beautiful smell I really love the smell of this beer. Taste- So I have to be honest. I am from Cleveland Ohio and I am going to college in Michigan and very upset because Great Lakes Brewing Company's Christmas ale just came out in Cleveland and I can't get it in Michigan so I saw this at the store and said I'd give it a try not expecting much. I'm shocked. It's great! It starts with a hoppy like honey taste and finishes with a beautifully smooth yet strong cinnamon taste. I think it competes hard with Great Lakes Christmas Ale the only thing I don't like as much about it as it is only 5.5 abv and Great lakes is 7.5% abv. Other than that I'm loving this beer. This is my second beer by Bell's and I'm loving this brewer. Mouth feel- the moth feel is exactly what it should be for this type of beer. I is easy to drink and smooth but has a perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is great and makes being away from my hometown of Cleveland and away from my Great Lakes Christmas Ale a little bit easier. Just a Great Beer. A Must Try! Just to say though I think my rating might be a bit higher because it totally surpassed my expectations.","smptenor","Nov 09, 2013"

Poured a hazy amber color, produced a thick creamy off white head, nice retention and it left nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted malt, caramel, apple and a slight hint of citrus. Medium bodied, a foundation of malted grain, fresh baked bread and sweet toffee. The flavor profile rounds out with a hint of orange citrus- slightly bitter- Overall it's merely average- a little thin and watery for a "Christmas Ale". Easy to drink- I suppose it's a decent beginner craft beer. Not something I would seek out again.","GossageBrewery","Mar 01, 2013"

I got two-plus fingers of dense tawny head with excellent retention from my nearly-inverted pour. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with malt, giving rise to truth in advertising. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching fullness with respect to its near-creaminess. The interplay between the malt, which was prevalent on the nose, and the hops, which now seemed to take center stage on the tongue, was notable. As the head began to fall, loads of sticky lacing was left behind. I was having a hard time believing that this was a Scottish Ale, but at the same time, I was totally digging it! I just wish that the malt had been more smoky as opposed to outright sweet. Finish was semi-sweet with the hops reigning in what could have been too much.","woodychandler","Dec 02, 2012"

Not this beer; the forward hop notes totally balance this ale and make it quite drinkable.

My first impression was creamy/milky, coppery, dry oatmeal, slight tartness on the finish. Nicely carbonated with a sparkle on the wash-down. When the carbonation dies it leaves a watery aftertaste. A good percentage of the initial flavor dies out quickly, leaving a mild alcohol burn and not much else. Too thin overall for a Scotch ale? I like Bell's in general, but I think they could do better job on this "special" ale. They have done much better on other beers.

My best guess is that the heavy sweet malt odor is combining with some kind of spicy / citric hopping to read as cranberries to my nose. Flavor has a nice full spectrum of overlapping malts on top of each other heavily spiced (for the scotch ale style, that is) with the same kind of hopping flavor as expected from the nose, perhaps I detect some cinnamon elements as well but it is hard to get a bead on it.

This beer poured out as a deep amberish red color with a tan fizzy head on top. So far it looks morel like a winter ale. The smell of the beer has some faint spices on the nose along with hops and malts. The taste seems to have a good amount of caramel sweetness upfront that fades into a spicy sweetness.

The nose comprises caramel, orange peel, light red grapes, and a pinch of nutmeg. The taste follows pretty closely, though with the addition of some mild toffee and some cinnamon.

A spongy head of khaki colored foam settles quickly, leaving a frothy skin on the surface and some jagged flares and spots on the glass. Despite the malty claim on the description, this is one hoppy scotch ale which isn't really true to its style. Notes of pine, grass, and grapefruit come across as a "christmas-y" taste lending bright, bittering notes to the underlying base of toasted bread, honey, and Lightly bronzed sugars. Flavors are similarly structured, striking a nice balance between resinous, citrusy hops, dough, toast, and light toffee-honey sweetness. The palate is medium-plus in stature, lively carbonated, finishing grassy, resinous, and semi-dry. It is a weird and non-traditional scottish ale...","CuriousMonk","Jan 19, 2011"

Probably on the lighter side of the color spectrum for a Scottish Ale. The nose is a mixture of crystal malt, caramel and west coast citrus-y hops. The flavor has a big upfront hoppiness to it (citrus and pine resin) and then mellows into a better balance as the sweeter caramel notes come out; however the brew does lean towards the hoppy side. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, slightly dry with a creamy carbonation.

Truth be told I was expecting more of a winter warmer style which tends to be too over the top spicy with cinnamon and clove and the like but this brew being a scottish ale was nice and balanced.

Clean evanescence to the nose, dried grass and straw, peat moss, pepper and sage, mild caramel and chocolate accents, as it warms you get more apricot, peach, yellow apple scents as well as scone, soda bread and honey. Medium-bodied, here the carbonation too active, prevents many of the flavors from finding a center and then soaking in. Noticeably dry, leads once more with a grassy earthiness, followed on by dry grapefruit, orange pith. The yellow apple, pear, apricot fruit tenuous, in turn not enough honey, toffee to elevate overall sweetness and bolster the fruit.

Smells of some toffee like malts, some mild hop aromas, and a slight soapiness? Smells is not quite as aromatic as I'd hoped. Hmm, taste is kinda weird, almost reminded me of a fruity grape, flavor at first? It is not what I'd expected, not bad, but not necessarily malty. Let me try this again, some roastyness in there, caramel malts, a clean palate cleansing hoppiness. I can see where people are saying this isn't like a scotch ale, not anything like I am expecting from the style. The mouthfeel is kinda thin too. Hmm, not a bad brew, but off in some way. Not smokey, or peat-like in any Scotch Ale sort of way, not spiced like some Christmas beers, and not even necessarily that malty or that hoppy!? WTF? Glad I bought this in a single, and not a six pack. An interesting experiment of a beer, but not a something that great or worth repeating.

Yeasty, bready flavour followed by herbal hops and a spiciness that was just short of acrid. Sort of fruity too. Herbal character lingered, along with a bit of lemon. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, but had a weird dryness in the finish. Drinkability wasn't great, but I was able to finish it without too much trouble.

Earthy aromas with hints of smoke and hops. Lots of pleasant buttery toffee flavors infused with caramel. Taste is definitely malt-forward with a twist of belgian yeast. A touch of ester fruitiness, but just in the background. More smoke in the taste, but very subtle. A little bitterness near the finish helps to balance. I like the Scotch Ale classification on BA, but a bit more light and drinkable than the heavy Wee Heavy ales that I have had. Very solid Christmas ale. Really gives off good holiday vibes.

Had that dry hoppy flavour, along with malt and a slight pine. Left the last ounce in the bottle and swirled it around to get all those nice tastes out of it.

The finish is a spicey herbal note. Hints of cardamon and even a little cinnamon play with the minty hops and bready malts. Pretty hoppy for a Scottish ale. Bready and grist in mouthfeel.

The beer takes on the rich, malty flavors, aromas, and textures that a Scottish Ale should, but it seems too well attenuated and carries very little weight on the tongue. The flavors are very firm through the malt flavor with the caramelized toffee, light pungent earthy character. But the malts never give the phenolic rich, heavy toffee, light smoke character that make Scottish Ales worth it. Still, I cannot detract the creamy, well-attenuated malts and relatively clean flavors and aromas. The beer is lightly hopped, but picks up a lot of bitterness and light astringency from the spice additions. The finish is a bit cola-like, but otherwise both sweet and dry with an evaporative quality. A nice beer, but it's nuances are not kicking it for me.","BEERchitect","Nov 23, 2008"

It's slightly sweet, with a nice bitterness in the middle and slightly dry on the finish. Nice use of hops in this one, but never becomes too bitter for those who like slighyl lower IBU ratings. Caramel coated orange slices is the best way to describe this beer's flavor. It's light-bodied, however, but what it lacks in body is almost made up in the flavor. Slightly creamy, light carbonation. This beer is pretty damn decent but nothing spectacular. I could have gone for a little fuller mouthfeel, but it was tasty and quite drinkable.

It didn't seem "big" enough to be considered a Wee Heavy (though Bell's actually only refers to it as a Scotch Ale). Regardless of Scotch classification, I'd expect some peat-smoked flavor and aroma. That said, it's not a bad beer by any means. It reminded me a lot of their traditional Amber Ale. I give Bell's a lot of credit for going with all Michigan grown grains and at least some Michigan hops. I also like their bucking of tradition with both their Winter White and this beer breaking the mold for Winter/Holiday beers.","GRPunk","Nov 18, 2008"

There's definitely a green wood note, along with some odd floral and confectioner's sugar elements. Some moderate malt character provides some stability, but the palate just seems muddled to me.
