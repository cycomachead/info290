Nose of rich caramel sweetness, with hints of smoke, scotch notes, and floral highlights. Flavors are rich and robust, with a scotch undertone and slight booze warmth supporting a caramel highlight and smoky blend. Smooth and slightly robust body, with a rich, robust, smoked aftertaste. Rich, sweet linger on a slick, slightly cloying finish. Big beer, but solid.","GarthDanielson","Aug 22, 2013"

The nose brings through a moderate amount of bready malt along with some light caramel and a bit of a nutty character. The flavor adds some light smoke, which works well in tandem with a bit of roast and toast. Mild character comes from the heather tips, which dry out the finish.

4.17,5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Has a deep mahogany wood look with a nice reddish hue when held up to the light. Comes with a 1 finger eggshell head that slowly dissolved to a nice ever present lace. Lots of great aroma on this one. Standard toffee, caramel, dark malts present like in all scotch ales, but what makes this unique is the light floral component that is definitely present. On tasting, the floral/heather component was even more pronounced. Very unique compared to other scotch ales I've sampled. It makes the beer extremely drinkable, and it tastes "lighter" than other scotch ales I've tried. In fact I don't really pick up on the alcohol at all which is somewhat surprising considering it comes in just shy of 8% ABV. Nice hint of smoke/peat which is something I want in my scotch ales as well. This stuff is rock solid and I will definitely seek it out again. If you like the style and want to try something a little different give it a try.","smokeypeat","May 23, 2011"

It goes down slow and rich with some light esters and a bone dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average Scottish ale.

Black currants or cranberries seem to be the first noticeable ingredients in the aroma followed by vaguely smoked malts. The mouthfeel tends to be oily and of medium body.

Aroma is peat smoked and roasted malts, a touch of chocolate, and a bit of earthiness. Flavor is roasted malts, smoke, chocolate, raisins, and grapes. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, dry and bitter at the finish. Warms well. Pretty good beer, although a little light for the style, almost quaffable.","mtstatebeer","Oct 29, 2009"

I guess a little quality control is in order...or maybe the bottle was old, but this should age well. Flavor and mouthfeel was thin...like I was drinking a totally different beer.. Not saying it was bad, but it didn't blow me away like the first one. Will give this another try, but my local beer place had some of these in closeout so maybe its retired?

3.85,-3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Out of a bomber picked up at the brewery this ale was a deep, nearly opaque brown color with one-finger of khaki head. The aroma was of roasted malt, sweet malt and peat smoke. The flavors were a little unusual, I kept thinking 'good BBQ sauce'! Roasted malt, peat smoke, caramel malt and a good hoppy bitterness that nipped the very end. Slightly acidic but not unpleasantly so. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation perfect, the body medium/full.

The aroma was malty and smoky and smelled like coffee, dark chocolate, and sawdust. The taste was mellow and the texture silky. The spicy hops (or was it heather) were more noticeable than typical, and a peat smoke dryness was persistent in the aftertaste.

The taste is smokey, chocolate, tangy, a bit bitter with a herbal presence but nicely mouthfeel on the palate. The finsh is fruity sweet with a little acidic feel on the back end of the palate.

Could see this going great with a cheese soup as well. Well done, Atlantic!","BuckSpin","Nov 07, 2006"
3.85,-3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I've tried many Atlantic offerings, with enjoyable results. This is no exception. It was a very dark brown, with a thim tan head. It had a roasted (quite) malt aroma, as well as some floral/grassy hints. Good hoppy taste, a little sweet. I thought I could taste a little honey. Fairly substantial, a beer to savor.","lordofthewiens","Oct 03, 2006"
4.08,2.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Well my 2nd beer from Atlantic Brewing up in Bah Habbah, neat offering and the 1st time I've seen this. Pours nearly black in color, smell of sweet malt. Taste is of malt, roasted (almost burnt) malt and some grassy flavored hops, like mown lawn. Mouthfeel is not thin, very nice. Drinkability? One to savor. I think a lot of people would think this is some kind of stout, but it's a Scottish Ale. It says that it's hopped with heather. I can't taste it but it's still a really nice beer.","Manosbeeroffate","Apr 15, 2006"
4.3,8.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Appears a dark reddish hue with decent sized tan head. Some rings of lacing were left as this was consumed. Sweet malty aroma with some fruits and caramel. Lighter earthy notes mingled about. Sweet fruit blended with a bit of dark chocolate started off the flavor. Light smoky and earthy herbal notes mixed in well. Pretty full and interesting taste. Easy drinking stuff that is smooth going down and the last sip is as tasty as the first.","meathookjones","Jan 31, 2006"

4.05,2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep rich brown with ruby highlights, topped by a small khaki head that vanishes almost instantly. Aroma of roasted caramel malt, some molasses, and a hint of piny hops. Palate is well-balanced and complex: a backbone of sweet roasted caramel malt, accented by slightly spicy and piny hops, with an underlying fruity sweetness. The alcohol provides a nice, warming finish. Body is smooth, but not too rich. Definitely a good Scottish ale, and one of the best offerings from Atlantic.","ElGordo","Jan 03, 2006"

4.58,15.4,5,4.5,5,4,4,"My first impression about this ale was that it would be like most Scottish ale's, with a relatively easy drinkability, but lacking in the over taste and mouthfeel; this was not the case. Atlantic has brought a great beer to my table, with a wonderfully dark, almost pitch-black colouration, and a exceptional aroma of beautifully balanced hops. There was no malt aroma or flavouring, which is a plus. The abv is certainly not a factor, and is not noticed. This ale has a wonderfully smooth feel, and very easy drinkability. Overall, I would most certainly rate this beer as an A.","Bestuurder","May 02, 2005"

4.07,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a cream, one finger-head that goes quickly leaving no lace. Clear deep amber almost black color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is floral - no strong hoppiness. Starts and finishes with a light complex of flavors - peat, malt, bread. Smooth, alcohol is not noticeable. $7.59 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me.","jdhilt","Mar 13, 2005"

4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Cream crenellation of head to start that falls down to just a shawl of all-sized bubbles. Very clear but deep brown hue with burgundy touches and some flitting action. Light peat smokiness on nose with a mossy presence and light floral note, which Id take a stab at as being the heather. Great smoke on mouth right away, malt finagles its way through quite nicely with some caramel, toffee, and Sumatra coffee notes. Well-balanced ale with just the right amount of burn.","Truh","Mar 01, 2005"
4.42,11.3,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Dirty, earthy aromas of peat and grape skin. Alcohol is noticeable but seems to fit in nicely with the cola-like caramel notes that assert themselves. Smooth and, at times, almost oily, this has a chewy malt flavor with a light alcohol astringency that seems to fade as the beer sits or as I adjust to it. Either way, the beer tastes and feels quite natural. The finish isn't quite as distinct or abrupt as some beers. It's much more cohesive and well-rounded, presenting a solid malt flavor throughout and somehow just "feeling" balanced in the end. Must be the heather. Top notch stuff.","marburg","Jan 06, 2005"
4.25,7.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability is very solid. Heather is an acquired taste and sometimes flat out does not work. However, with this beer the combination and transitions are excpetionally well done. Very nice brew.","CRJMellor","Nov 15, 2004"
