3.53,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Quite a nice sweet and milk chocolatey flavour that seemed more like a light milk stout than a Scottish ale but an enjoyable offering regardless and one that I'd have again.","flyingpig","Feb 27, 2013"

3.16,-13.9,4,3,3,4,3,"Flavor has some light sweetness, with more caramel and toffee present. Nothing in the way of peaty or smoky character at all, though. In fact, the maltiness falls far short of what I expect in a scotch ale. Has some subtle intimations of fruitiness with a touch of hopping in the dry finish. Overall, a rather bland representation of the style. Should be called a ""Scottish Light - 20 Shiling Beer"". Prosit!","Bierman9","Jul 04, 2012"

3.9,6.3,4,4,4,3,4,"Pours a very dark brown with a thick fluffy head. Much like the ingredient list on the back, there are scent of malted barley, malted wheat, hops, and yeast which gives it an almost caramel scent. Starts out making you think this will be a heavy tasting beer with its malted ingredients like a stout but instead it finishes rather light. Drinks rather smooth as the malted ingredients really hit the taste buds. Finishes rather clean smooth. A decent beer with a rather interesting drinking experience.","Lemke10","Oct 19, 2011"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"Another Williams Brothers beer which is very likeable and with more potential than the score might indicate.

3.83,4.4,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This one pours an attractive deep brown with a fairly substantial off-white head. The aroma has a lot of sweet caramel with a bit of earthy, peaty malts. Coffee and brown sugar finish off the nose. The taste is a bit watery at first, but pulls through at the finish with nice caramel malts with just a touch of peat, some coffee and chocolate, and a bit of earthy hops and fruits. The mouthfeel is nice, it's coating at first and then finishes drying. The drinkability is very good. Overall, an enjoyable beer that's very drinkable.","shand","May 26, 2011"

3.7,0.8,4,4,3.5,3,4,"This is a lighter ""Heavy"" that is for sure,is this the traditional way of the style?Poured into an imperial nonic a rich mahogany with beige colored 1/2 finger head that faded quickly,the rich color got the high mark.Caramel toffee aromas along with some brown sugar and a slight metallic note.Lighter feel for such a rich looking beer,I know the abv. is low but I was expecting a little more richness and fullness.Very malt accented to be expected,caramel and firm toffee to go along with lightly sweet biscuit malt element.Its not overly sweet and its not smokey like most American versions of the style,but its not nearly as rich and/or complex either.","oberon","Mar 23, 2011"
3.38,-7.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"If this is their heavy, I'm really curious to see what their 60/- offers. It's a real sessionable ale no doubt, but I need a wee more flavour. Perhaps toning down the bubbles and/or roasted barley will do it? Attractive bottle, by the way.","Bouleboubier","Mar 02, 2011"
2.39,-34.9,4,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"I love a good Scottish ale. It's just too bad that this isn't one. It's a beautiful beer, no doubt...deep brown with rich reddish hues and a soapy off-white head. The aroma is lacking...very mild, a touch of malt, and that's about it. The taste is light, drier than expected, and disappointing. There is a little toast-crust flavor, but it's not the rich scotch ale that it could be. A little too much carbonation. Very weak in body. This one is forgettable.","Suds","Feb 19, 2011"
4.76,29.7,5,4,5,5,5,"Pours a wonderful deep copper/burgandy color with excellent head and lacing. Very nice malty scent, hints of peat in the nose. Great flavor! A wonderfully deep and satisfying, thick maltiness with nice caramel and toffee tones and just the slightest hint of peat in the background. Goes down wonderfully well! This has a lot of flavor for a low abv brew. Wonderful stuff!","JamesS","Jan 28, 2011"
3.08,-16.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Not many Eighty Shilling Ales make it to the US ... we have a dark session ale among us. This beer is brownish garnet and crystal clear, with decent lacing that lasts for the duration. Burnt malt aroma of lightly roasted coffee and brown sugar are in the nose. This brew has a lush smoothness with some body. A faintness of toffee with a drawn out, dried- hay graininess and faint dried-plum fruitiness are all present throughout this beer. More watery char flavor shows up in the finish. This is an OK beer that lacks depth. The watery burnt flavor takes away from the drinkability a bit.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"
4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very easy to drink and seems to be a lot stronger than the 4.2% ABV it claims because of its depth of body. An ideal cold weather beer.","BlackHaddock","Oct 19, 2010"
4.31,17.4,5,4,4,4.5,5,"Simply superb microbrewed Scottish ale. Also one of the most flavorful beers I've been able to find in the States in the 4% ABV range.","Natural510","Sep 30, 2010"
4.27,16.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,5,"Taste is lightly sweet-sour fruit strong up front then joined by toasty caramelised bread crust, dry leafy-woody & tea-like hop with hint of pepper. Startig lightly sweet-sour, it becomes balanced and drier. It has some subtle complexity at firts, but this fades and it soon becomes flatter and less multifacted in character, mostly dryish darkly toasty with light caramel, faint hint of winey sweet-sour fruit and faint hint of woody-tea hops. Drinkability is always high.","Offa","Sep 25, 2010"
3.95,7.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear, dark rust color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight dark citrus, hint of roasted malt, and hint of spice. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight yeast, coffee, hops, and slight grain. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend.","Tone","Sep 17, 2010"

3.68,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"From the 500 ml. bottle with an expiration date of July 2011. Sampled on July 17, 2010. The pour is copper-amber with a little red hue held to the light and great clarity. There is lingering lacing on the glass. Malts are the main aroma. Malts and sweetness. The mouthfeel comes in at about medium with a sweet and dry malty taste. It is actually very easy to drink.","puboflyons","Jul 17, 2010"
4.1,11.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear chestnut brown color with a tight khaki colored head, settles into stellar cap. The aroma is of brown bread, light grain, some brown sugar, honey, and some peat. The aromas are not over the top but are very solid. The taste is of a woodsy chestnut brown malt, a touch grainy, some mineral or metallic flavor, and a tea like dry and lemony flavor. There is some light milk chocolate notes as well. I must say for a 4.2ABV brew this has some great flavors. The Scot has a moderate to heavy feel with soft and airy carbonation; starts sweet and finishes a bit astringent. This is an excellent beer considering the ABV, heck it is a good beer not factoring in the ABV. Where can I get a case of this stuff, I can drink it all day during football season.","Gmann","Jul 01, 2010"
3.88,5.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle, best before July 2011, label says ""Scottish Heavy/Eighty Shilling Beer"". Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is toffee, toasted malt, and some butterscotch. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some nuts and dark fruit noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. And with just a 4.2% ABV, it would be a decent choice as a session beer. It certainly wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these at a time. Not a bad overall brew.","bluejacket74","May 29, 2010"
3.56,-3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"The mouthfeel was about right for a beer of this style, decent and above medium in the mouth. At 4.2% it is a good all night beer, but the lack of significant flavours would make me look at another 80/~. William Bros normally produce very good beers, but this is a bit disappointing.","kmacphail","May 28, 2010"
3.37,-8.2,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Drinkability: Very drinkable because of the abv, but I did not feel as though the flavors were as strong here as I have had in other examples of this style. An average beer that I will have again, but nothing to rush for.","tigg924","May 28, 2010"

4.49,22.3,4,5,4,4.5,5,"Teak brown, solid and thick with fiery highlights ranging from blood orange to Meyer lemon, capped with a smooth, cappuccino-beige head. Delightful, beguiling nose floats spicy pine, grass, and citrus notes atop a well of chocolate, Earl Grey tea, caramel, and sweet grape- and strawberry-like fruitiness. There are earthier tinges of resin and roasted peanuts as well. Robust but quick flavor, surging with a rush of coffee, cocoa, nuts, and orange oil before closing with a bittersweet finish that leaves just a shadow of acrid roasted char. Sprightly carbonation works perfectly with a thick, malt-forward mouthfeel to achieve an overall balanced and dry impression. Complex, robust, and at only 4.2%, a wonderful session beer!","soulgrowl","Sep 08, 2009"
3.4,-7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"M&D: effervescent on the carbonation, medium-minus bodied, and pretty light on the palate as far as a malty ale is concerned. Not a bad beer, not even boring if one considers the flavour profile typical for a 80/-, but the quality of malts used in this brew is not impressive enough to result in a remarkably intensive malt feast in the glass like some of its counterparts have managed.","wl0307","Aug 23, 2009"
