4.08,5.2,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy dark amber color with a big frothy head. The smell is pretty malty with hints of fruit and citrus. The taste is predominately sweet caramel malt with a fair share of hops to make this quite an interesting beer. Overall a pretty good, well balanced beer.","Joe_Howard","Friday at 08:17 PM"

4.1,5.7,4,4,4.25,4,4,"I found it interesting this is an interpretation of a toned down iscotch ale. Certainly well balanced as far as hops and malts are concerned. A smoky taste of molasses and malts get a pick me up from the zestiness, and crispiness of the hops. Giving the 90 schilling a refreshing mouth feel. Very enjoyable to drink. I would imagine it pairs very well with many types of food as well as it fits drinking as a session. A nice pick me up of a buzz as well. A good selection to make, especially if you have never had the pleasure.","i_theterrible","Feb 20, 2015"

I expected much more malt sweetness or malt flavor of some kind, but it's mostly corn/grain and rubbing alcohol.  possibly I have a very old six-pack here, but I also figured this malt-forward style would age well.

This beer goes with every food, it's perfectly balanced, and it's a great introduction to craft beer for those who have never seen the light.  It's closer in style to an amber ale, which might bore some people, but don't let a classification determine what you try.  Beautiful color, not too high alcohol content, not super hoppy, not too sweet, just a fantastic beer.  Will have one of these anytime, anywhere.","dcscientist","Sep 25, 2014"

So yes, 90 Shilling is an impressive little beer that would be great with a friend and great for a trial run like what I'm doing here. People go crazy over it but I think it's simply a capable beer. After half the bottle I'm about spent with this one, I don't know if I would actually go out and purchase it again - but it is a good full-flavored beer and crafty too. If you're looking for something to wet your whistle, look elsewhere but if you're looking for a bouquet of interesting flavors that make you raise your eyebrow and say ""hmmm"" or ""mmmm", you should give this one a try.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 22, 2014"

Aroma of some caramel and bready malts dominate, with some light floral notes on the back end. Flavor is mostly caramel malts, bready, much like a scotch ale (this is my first ""Scottish"" ale). Finishes OK, with medium body and a bit of juiciness. Medium carbonation. Overall not my favorite beer but my first of the style and certainly not bad.","BMMillsy","Jul 03, 2014"

3.96,2.1,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured into a standard pint. The beer is a clear medium mahogany color with a good finger's worth of foam, nicely white and leaving excellent lacing. The nose offers pleasant malt aroma, but it's a bit faint. Very nice flavor though! It's pretty much entirely malt-based, as you would expect, nice and bready with a little bit of caramel. Finish is sweet, as there's little hop bitterness. The low strength makes it feel much more like the real ale you get in Scotland, than many American micro's interpretations of a ""strong"" scotch ale. Very good beer.","allengarvin","Jun 21, 2014"

It has a delicate flavor which I think would really shine if paired with the proper food. Because it is delicate it would easily be overpowered by foods that are bold and assertive. I find myself thinking of adventurous pairings such as cinnamon toast, pancakes or waffles with maple syrup and butter, chicken and waffles, sweet barbecue chicken, sweet corn, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, delicate cheeses, etc. Putting this with the right food could really be the right move. I think it would take it from being an interesting beer in its own right to something really stellar.","TangoMike","May 03, 2014"

Flavor is where it falls slightly short for me, crisp apple, malty and medium-hopped, but somehow seems to be some empty spaces in there somewhere. Mouthfeel is lighter than it looks like it's going to be, but nice carbonation and a tight finish. I think Odell achieved what they were going for with their lighter take on a Scotch ale, and definitely a good offering for their flagship beer. I remember drinking this in Fort Collins 15 years ago and liking it, and still like it now.","BeerWizard","Sep 19, 2013"

The lacing is very good on this as well as the retention. It's a great looking brew. The smell of the beer is malty, semi sweet with a nice earthy caramel aroma. The taste of the beer is very mellow, nice malt profile with a subtle bitterness in the late finish, flavors of toast and caramel.

By no means is it a bad brew, it just comes up short in the aroma profile and has a decent, but unmemorable flavor. In fact, if it didn't cost $8.50 a six, this would be an ideal causal beer. At this point in the argument, I still prefer Belhaven if I am going to shell out for a Scottish ale.","Bockrules","May 14, 2012"

Aroma offers a touch of smokiness, nutty, sweet bread and caramel, and a little spiciness and earthiness. Flavor follows suit. A medium bodied, active mouthfeel.

Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like caramel malt, toffee, nuts and some bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and it's also well carbonated. Overall I think it's an OK beer.

I expected something more intense and more alcoholic, given the style, but enjoyed it anyhow. It's a Scottish ale deflated by about one third; still having plenty of caramelly flavor (and that distinct taste of peas) without the burn of the booze that so warms one on a winter evening. A levitated, springtime approach to an otherwise heavy-duty, depths-of-January malty classic. Worth a glass.","gfreed","Nov 14, 2011"

2.68,-30.9,4,3.5,2,3,2.5,"A 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A Hazy amber liquid with golden hues near the edges, this beer evolves about a half inch of head before it fades to a thin foam layer. A grand amount of sticky, white lacing is left behind, enhancing the appearance. It smells of hops, faint citrus, a bit of smooth malt, and even fainter skunky/funky smell; something just seems off. This is reflected in the taste. It tries to find a middle ground between an amber and a scotch ale, but seems to fall short of excelling at either. Hops and very faint caramel lead the way before that odd skunk flavor takes over. Quite unfortunate. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, save a faint burning from the alcohol (which was surprising since there really wasn't a whole lot in there) and the rather unpleasant flavor. I'm a big fan of a number of Odell's products, but I won't be revisiting this one anytime soon. For some reason, it just doesn't do it for me.","eclipse54","Jul 14, 2011"

I am not picking up much aroma. I do detect the caramelized malt and that is about it. Lacks much depth. The flavor also suffers from a lack of depth. Odell 90 Shilling lacks the sweetness that makes a Scottish Ale. A lot of artificial tasting malt with subtle hints of peat and smoke. This sort of malt bill turns me off everytime regardless of style. A nice little grassy hop hit in the finish. Maybe not exactly 90 Shilling worthy but maybe 70 Shilling. Good carbonation and texture. A flagship beer that is not an APA is a nice departure along with the ABV.","morimech","Dec 18, 2010"

I have long copped to not being a sweet beer kind of drinker, preferring palate-ripping AmeriCAN IPAs, but when I am off-reservation, this is the kind of taste that I CAN get behind.

Pours a dark amber color with golden/copper highlights, small white head that has a lasting cap, but no lacing. Nice, lightly sweet nose, some caramel and toffee, virtually no hoppiness. Upon first taste, I thought it seemed a bit light and watery. But the more I sip on it, the more I like this quality. The smooth, balanced bready and toasty malts combine well with the caramel and light hoppiness (piney, but light) to great a refreshing, drinkable red ale. It's bordering on Scottish ale territory.

Pleasing scottish ale, more maple and caramel sensed along with some astringent hops notes in the finish.

This is as fine a Scotch Ale as can be found in the states, but not comparable to the beers from across the pond. This beer has an under-attenuated, wort-y sweet quality, yet a bit light in the body. A pungent earthy note does give a much needed variety, but can't overcome the sugary sweetness. Although the hops are in abundance, they even falter under the sweetness. The body is somehow lacking with true maltiness, giving the beer a dull, sticky texture. Finishes a little sugary.

Taste is much better, though. Starts with a bit of fruit up front, like sour cherries. It gets dry from there. Very dry. Slight hops on the finish, which is a nice balance to the malt. The malt isn't very sweet. At first I would have said it lacked the peat of a scottish ale but as the beer has warmed, i revise that statement. Definite peat and very delicate. A nice feat and it makes for a flavor that addresses the gripe I frequently have of Scottish ales, that they just demand too much of you. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, not so much as to prevent it from being a refreshing drink Nice carbonation. Drinkability? Hard to drink a lot of them with that bone-dry finish.

Many described it as being very smooth. I very much agree. A tremendous session beer. Nice carbonation enhances the sweet caramel notes. After investing so much time in IPA's this drinks like a cola. That is easy drinking at its finest. Odell is steadily making itself one of my favrite breweries. Good show!!!","ChrisA","Jul 08, 2006"

3.31,-14.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"12 oz bottle obtained from Westminster Liquor (Colorado) in Jan 2005 and consumed that same evening. Review from notes. No sediment and a hard pour to get a 3 finger light tan/beige head. Just barely cloudy and light brown. Smells of toffee caramel, chocolate, and a hint of roasted grains. Tastes mild. Not much flavor to start and the ending flavors rise slowly. Late I get chocoalte and tofee with some raisin. Very late I get a hint of chalky from Vienna (or Munich) malt. It has a sourish finish that's kinda dry. not quite a cherry-like sour. Also some acid from the carbonation rising off my tastebuds in the flat of my tongue. Light body. This doesn't do it for me...if they could put a flavor up front when the beer first touches the tongue it would be much more intersting. Decent lacing on the glass.","mentor","Jan 20, 2005"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Odell 90 Shilling Ale is pretty good beer no matter what style one settles on. As noted above, it tastes like a robust amber ale right out of the chute.

Nice earthy/smoky edge to it too. Taste is similar--up front. Malts are lightly sweet, earthy and fruity. Minor hops come in and mostly just add dryness. Lightly bitter and interesting for the style.

The hopping is boorish, and masks what is good about the beer, a nice malting. They call it a cross between an English pale ale and a Scottish ale. Uh, okay. That combination is dumb. Naming this beer ""90 Shilling"" is dumb. It's a drinkable American (""Colorado ale"" as they call it) amber; a bad Scottish ale because of too much boring American hopping; a bad English pale ale because it's too sweet. This is an average micro-beer 10 years beyond deserving recognition. Now it's just a quaint player in a market full of dynamic offerings.","gbontrag","Sep 18, 2004"

As the head dies off rather quickly the glass was left decorated with sparse patches of lace. Caramel sweetness rose from the glass in a pleasant but fairly mild aroma, that also had some fruit notes to it. Flavor had a strong caramel presence with a bit of an earthy hop kick to keep the sweetness in check. There were also notes of fruits and it was a bit doughy at times. The mouthfeel was good but feel a little short of a medium body. This stuff is pretty darn tasty and goes down very easy. I would definitely pick more up if it were available in the area.

The taste was much the same a nice balance of malt that was both sweet, and toasted with a bit of hops to keep things on even ground.

The aroma is really pleasing with a sweet, maltiness that contains caramel, toffee and a touch of fruitiness. Almost like a combination of Munich and Brown malts, but not quite. Rich, but not aggressive. The body and carbonation level are appropriate. The flavor starts malty and fruity, dries a bit at mid swallow, and then gives a spritz of hop flavor before leading into a lightly bitter dryness. Quite Scottish in nature up to a point, but I find the hop flavor unusual. The choice of hops seems a little odd. Still, a good beer.","NeroFiddled","Jul 25, 2002"

A pronouced hop bitterness (for an amber) and flavor is perfectly balanced by a mellow but significant caramel malt profile. With an almost ""chewy"" maltiness and full body to complements the hop profile, 90 Shilling exhibits a rich balance. Lightly earthy hop flavor seems to be combination of Goldings and Willamette. It finishes with a slight toasty caramel sweetness on the back of the tongue. An excellent and highly drinkable amber. It's akin to an ESB minus the fruitiness.","marc77","Mar 18, 2002"
