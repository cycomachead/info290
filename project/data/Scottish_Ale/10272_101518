I&G's Scottish Whisky Porter is a serviceable strong ale, but it's not very porter-like at all - if handed this blindfolded, I'd probably call it a wee heavy, making the BA classification pretty accurate in my view. A little too sweet to be something I'd drink regularly, but still a brew that I could see myself picking up sporadically - which is roughly how I feel about their flagship oaked ale. Fans of that beer (and other I&G products) should find this to be a worthwhile diversion, but if you're not already a member of that group then I can't see this beer changing your opinion of the brewery very much.","thehyperduck","Jan 12, 2015"

The nose comprises dried maple syrup, oak, vanilla bean, light cocoa powder, very light roasted malts, light vague stonefruit, and a hint of booze wafting in the breeze.  The taste is a blast of oak followed by a cigar wrapped in dank greens and dipped in sweet caramel and maple syrup.  Unlike most other I&G offerings, this one falls apart on the tongue, coming across muddled, confused, and leaving us in a similar place.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.  Overall, a definite disappointment here.

The first sip is cloying all day, alcohol burn at only 7.4% that's just sad with a watery beer supposedly aged on oak to ""unlock the flavor"". These guys are brewing half ass beer, so far nothing I've had from them have been nearly acceptable to call this base beer a porter is sacrilege. There's no rounded sweetness this is really harsh on the palate flavor and mouthfeel, watery texture with these big oak character with alcohol levels that are unrelenting for such a modest abv, just unbalanced.

The smell is all sweet molasses which right out of the gate I know this isn't going to work for me since I love true porters and molasses doesn't seem like a good fit. I will say they taste isn't all that bad. The molasses is obviously there with hints of oak and vanilla like there other brews. It does have a small porter bitterness/burnt aftertaste, but you really have to be searching for it. Overall if this was considered a dark ale with molasses I'd think much more of this but since they want it to be a porter I'll rate it as a porter which is maybe a little better than I thought but still nothing I'd buy again.","sjones5045","Oct 28, 2013"
