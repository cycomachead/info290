"Likely some of the same notes/comparisons on this beer as others... poured from a 12oz can into my snifter. Finger of tan head faded fast... however, this beer was a real looker. Deep mahogany tones, blood red shone through when held in the light. Nicest aspect by far. Malt to the nose... and about only that. Some oak to taste, a bit malt-forward, but not heavy. Seemed light for the style. a bit watery, but somewhat redeemed by the crispness. Overall, a bit lacking. In the right situation like a lawnmowing adventure, long day of sessioning (homebrewing, fishing), this might actually hit the spot. On a work night, when I limit myself to one beer, I would rather reach for something a bit more substantial."

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and a pretty standard example of the style, it had some of those nice flavors and aromas that I look for in the style, but it also had some off aspects that held it back from being as good as it could be. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, clean, and not filing, but the carbonation and lack of depth might start to wear on me, but the body does make it more drinkable than most of the style. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, I thought it was pretty nice and true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was just a little thin and it was too crisp for the style. I don't think I would buy this again, if I'm in the mood for the style I would rather have a Dirty Bastard. I don't think I would recommend this beer, since there are many other Scottish Ales that are better. All in all I thought this beer fell right about in the middle, it wasn't a bad beer, but it lacked the mouthfeel and depth that a good Scottish Ale has. I think with a little bit of work this could be a pretty good beer."

"Overall. This is really middle of the road, it easy drinking but just not much flavor."

"This is an okay scotch ale. It certainly hints to the nuances of the style, but keeps it fairly subtle. Smooth and easy drinking beer. This is pretty good, considering the style is one that you don't really see too often; not to mention the quality of the brew."

"Amber pour, thick white head, little lacng. Hops, and citrus smell, vanilla. Tastes oddly hoppy considering the style, slightly sweet, toast, peanut, honey flavors. Less broadly pleasant and balanced than their Widowmaker, still a good beer from a solid brewery."

"On tap at the brewpub - Nov 25, 2007. Aroma comes forth with some light wet graham-cracker crust aroma. Lightly soggy and woody. Pours a rather ruddy stained oak-brown. Burnished and with a quickly fading off-white head. Flavor is a mildly endearing caramel, backed with nibbles of cheap bourbon, and hazlenut, toasted bread. Nutty, but somewhat bland. Above average gravity for this brewery, which is nice. Lightly warming and sugary. Finishes with some highly leafy crispness."
"A bit sweet, but not too much. It unfortunately lacks depth, complexity and body. Passable."
"A big shout out to woodychandler for another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste also has considerable sweetness, lots of malts, some brown sugar maybe. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"P. S. I CAN take great pride in it being a CAN review that propelled me into Pooh-Bah status. Hatas CAN hate, but The CANQuest (TM) rolls on unabated."
"O- This beer is much better when the can hasn't been compromised. Decent overall. I'd like to see some more of the traditional Scottish attributes. While I know this isn't meant to be a Wee Heavy, I think they could still get some more smokey notes."
"NOTE: The bottom of the can is coded with a packaged-on date of 02/23/11."
"It's a nice looking brew. It's red, orange and brown in the middle. Dark and opaque on top and gold on the bottom. Beautiful range of colors. The smell is sweet caramel. It's diverse like the appearance, but not strong enough. Hints of citrus and cinnamon. Crisp apple. The taste is enjoyable. Good candy caramel malts, although a little light. A hint of sour yeast and crisp, sour apple finish round out the taste. Could use more hops. Mouthfeel is the best part of the beer. Fairly thick, but silky smooth and as drinkable as the best of them."
"Overall, this is a failure. It's an average amber -- maybe slightly below average even in that genre. The maker of this beer has no clue."
"My sister brought me this from the Marquette MI. Three finger head of thick light brown foam. Dense lace with little cling. Color is a 25 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of smoke, roasted malt, and oak. Taste of malt, and hops, and smoked oak. Mouthfeel is creamy and quite full with a little drying in the back of my throat. Not bad, quite refreshing, and more flavor as it warms. I would have more, but it is unavailable down in the south."
"I love the red jacket amber ale that is my go to beer."
"A dark amber/copper liquid fills the glass while big, creamy foam perches it's self high above the ale. The head fades quick and leaves little lacing. The nose of this beer is all malt. Nothing in this is too roasty or smokey but a mellow blend of sweetness. Perhaps a touch of honey and the oak is hardly noticeable but present. Not a hop in sight nor peat which is a slight disappointment. Once I start to sip I can detect a slight hop bitterness and a bit of smoke. The flavors in this are quite simple- sweet malts and a touch of butterscotch/caramel. The oak presents itself but if I had not read about it I might not have noticed. The thin body is a turnoff for me but the medium carbonation level saves it from disaster. This is a pretty average example of a wonderful scotch style... better examples exist."
"The taste is nice what you expect from the description. It starts with a light carbonation on the tongue, sweet malty, caramel with an sweet oaky finish. The mouth is very smooth throughout not harsh in the mouth, and the oak sets it apart from other scotch ales"
