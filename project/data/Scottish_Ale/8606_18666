Glad I was able to procure but a single of this, as I don't think I would have much use for the remainder of the 4-pack it is sold in around here.","biboergosum","May 23, 2014"

3.73,3,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"The malt has a touch of smoke to it with some sharp notes. Roasted barley and a fruity flavor. A touch of bitterness but more like some bitter ash or smoky taste. A little bitterness for the finish. The current version of this brew tastes pretty good to me. Quite quaffable. Nice to taste a Scottish Ale in the lower ABV and less sticky style. From the 16 oz can purchased at Market of Choice on 29th in Eugene.","mactrail","Aug 16, 2013"

4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I am an oddity: a pacific NWer who really doesn't like hops. This beer suits my taste perfectly. I actually spend a lot of time in Scotland and Fearless Scotch ale would stand up well to traditional Scottish lager like Belhaven's, which is my choice when there. it has a low carbonation and great malt taste. It's a bit pricey -about $10 for 4 pint cans in Portland.","wetshoes","Jun 08, 2012"

3.45,-4.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a slightly cloudy caramel amber. Thin fine head dissipates quickly to a thin film and ring around the glass, slight lacing. Aroma mostly caramel malt with slight bready malts, sweet. Taste is mild toffee, caramel malt, a bit of bisquity malt in the middle. Finishes mild caramel malt, a bit watery. This has all the right elements for a Scottish ale, but flavors are weak. Could be very nice with more assertive flavors. Light to medium bodied, too light for the style.","LiquidAmber","Nov 20, 2011"

3.61,-0.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, this is pretty good beer. It's pretty tasty, but it comes off as being a little light tasting for the style. This tastes good, but I want a little bit more.","flexabull","Aug 06, 2011"
2.33,-35.6,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"This is not an easy beer to drink, even at 5.3%. It really begins and ends with caramel but the flavors through the middle don’t meld well. It seemed to be an attempt to make a beer taste like a scotch. A noble effort but not quite there. I thought this would be a no brainer to drink with Braveheart. I guess in the sense that both were gritty and lasted too long, then it works.","Bfarr","Jul 16, 2011"
3.38,-6.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Clear amber color with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. The head does recede to a ring, leaving nothing much. The nose does have a rather prominent toasted malt character with a rather strong earthy hop character. Very twiggy. The palate opens with a blend of toasted malt and brown sugar, mildly burnt. However, there isn't enough of a body to carry these flavors. Just a light toast and not a particularly nutty backbone. Decent. Medium-light in.body with a drying, mildly bitter finish, there's some herbal character here. Decent stuff, a little more body would hugely improve things here. I feel like I'm being harsh here, but this beer really has promise to be better","DefenCorps","Jul 11, 2011"

3.41,-5.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A big shout out to woodychandler for providing this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some malts. Taste is also malts up front, a bit nutty, just a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer.","tone77","May 02, 2011"

3.48,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer pours a nice copper, clear with good head formation and retention (slightly off-white). Lacing was minimal but a few strings present. Smell was quite grainy with an infusion of caramel/toffee sweetness. Some bready malts as well. Taste was strong sugars (caramel, chocolate sugar, some brown sugar) but was complemented with some dark fruits. A touch of hazelnut as well. Mouth was a bit thin, slightly metallic. Overall this is a decent canned Scotch. I enjoyed the integration of the sweet sugars as it wasn't overwhelming.","OakedCanuck","Mar 16, 2011"
3.6,-0.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"The Crack and Glug went off unimpeded by any untoward events and I was soon facing a massive two-finger, thick, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with just a hint of haze. Nose had a cereal sweetness to it, very malty with a slight presence of hops underlying. Mouthfeel was medium with a nutty maltiness and a grassy hoppiness on the tongue. Finish was slightly dry with the nutty, bready flavors lingering well after the swallow. It was not a style that I normally truck with, but it seemed okay in sum. I was glad to have had the chance to try it, but it really was not my cup of tea (or glass of beer). Oh well.","woodychandler","Dec 07, 2010"
1.71,-52.8,2.5,1.5,1.5,2,2,"Poured into a tulip glass. head thin and disipated quickly.very little aroma,Not much in the way of either malt or hops the most prevalant flavour being metallic, not sure where that comes from but it is unplessant. i keep wanting to give this beer and brewer a chance, but this being my 4th try at this beer all purchased at differant times and differant locations and all with the same result, I would highly recomend staying away from this beer.","PougeMahone","Sep 23, 2010"
3.49,-3.6,4.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Impressively drinkable. A bit light on aroma and a touch thin, but certainly a nicely drinkable ale, not bad for the style.","djeucalyptus","Beers"
4.2,16,4,4,4,4,5,"Taste is very fruity-malty with firm toastiness and a mellow clear nuttiness. Light spicey-earthy hop joins in before a long caramelly-toasty malt aftertaste. It is very drinkable, not overly complex, but well-rounded and with good, firm character very fitting for a Scottish Ale.","Offa","0"
3.56,-1.7,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Drinks easy, doesn't overwhelm, and even borders on dull, although the ABV (5.3% on the can) makes it a no-brainer for a decent beer to knock back a few of, if you're in that sort of mood. My wife definitely liked it more than I did, and I was happy to share.","Metalmonk","Apr 10, 2010"
4.27,18,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The body was full, without being heavy or sticky. Drinkability was excellent, and this is not one of my favorite styles. Overall, a very good brew, worth seeking out. This is my first beer from this brewery and I will be seeking out more.","beertunes","May 16, 2008"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"1 pint can amazingly! From Capital Market ,Salem Lovelly looking beer here. Clear darkish amber, with a gorgeous ,pilloy ,foamy light tan head. Aroma subdued, but mainlly nutty and malty. Taste again slightly bitter caramel style malts, touch of smoke in the back of the throat, some nuttiness and a ting of hop. Nice palate, smooth and rich yet not overly so. Actually not a bad 90 schilling ale. Real surprise in a can.","Reidrover","Mar 01, 2008"
3.83,5.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: One of the better Scottish Ales (US-made) I've tried; Fearless does well to push this as one of their flagship labels. It's one I'll have again and one I definitely recommend NW beer fans try if they have the chance. At just 5%, this is certainly drinkable beyond only a single serving...","msubulldog25","Jan 06, 2005"
