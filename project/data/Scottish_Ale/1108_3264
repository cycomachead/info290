3.88,3.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"My nephew hooked me up with this beer following a trip to Scotland. Clear copper-amber pour with two finger head with great retention and lacing. Earthy, malty nose with hints of toffee, tea, caramel, brown sugar, and just a touch of metal. The hops that were predominantly absent from the nose, really jump out in the taste in that classic English fashion. Toasty malt, brown bread, tea, caramel, and just a touch of vanilla round out this well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a nice tangy, bitter hop bite on the finish. This, coupled with the low ABV make this highly drinkable. A very solid Scottish Ale. Thanks Kevin!","beerdrifter","Nov 01, 2011"

4.12,9.6,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"One of several birthday presents from my in laws! Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. It wasn't as dark as I expected especially since the label states ""Dark Scottish Ale," but still pretty good looking. It comes out a little bit of an orange brown color, ""rusty"" if you will. Very hazy and a thick creamy white head, very decent lacing. The smell isn't overly strong, but it's got complexity and depth and overall pretty good. A little citrusy and bready. Almost like a orange loaf of pound cake. It's followed by dark sweet malts. Taste is good, malty, but not too aggressive. Caramel and toffee, not too sweet though. There is a good balance between the malt and hop flavor, citrus hops. Not really bready like the smell. Mouthfeel is good, fairly light, almost smooth. A little complex, not as creamy as other Scottish Ales I've had in the past. It's strange, not really like any of this style I've had in the past but really enjoyed this. I like the balance and it's very unique. Good, I'd get it again, but more of a summer Scottish Ale, I like it.","AndyAvalanche","Jun 28, 2010"

I would have preferred something heavier. The taste is nice, but again, too watery. The sweetish malts are pronounced and then it dissipates. You get a bit of a burnt flavor. There is very little carbonation in this beer. There is a smallish bite in the aftertaste where the hoppiness comes out. It is the dissipation in the mid to end of the taste that is the most troubling and which compromises this beer. The mouthfeel is very light. There just isn't enough here to sink into.

3.92,4.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a deep amber colour with a creamy head which dimishes to lacing left all the way down the glass. A good malty nose with some faint hops making themselves known. The citrusy hops were a surprise in the taste for a Scottish beer and the caramel malts balanced out the hops nicely, and the beer finished pleasingly bitter. Slightly thin mouthfeel but nevertheless smooth. A nice ale, although I prefer Inveralmond's Ossians Ale, but certainly a decent offering from the folks in Perth.","foamer","Dec 19, 2004"
3.84,2.1,4.5,3,4,3.5,4.5," A classic example of a Scottish Ale ( 40 Shilling give or take ) and while pricey and not earth shattering, worth checking out.","Shiredave","Dec 11, 2004"
4.1,9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Lia Fail is good beer that makes no missteps during the short journey from bottle to stomach. I would prefer that it have a bit more heft and a more assertive flavor, but then it wasn't designed as that sort of beer. Devotees of the style could do much worse than this fine, representative Scottish Ale.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 02, 2004"

3.65,-2.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a off-white two-fingered head that fades and leaves some lace. Clear, deep amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts with a rich mix of malts and hops, finishes smooth with a trace of hops; good Scottish ale. $4.20 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","Jul 07, 2004"
4.45,18.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"I have to say that when I bought this beer I had no idea what to expect... it comes in an attracttive 1 pint 9 oz bottle that talks about the Stone of Destiny... also called Lia Fail. It states that it has won an award in the Premium Bitter category - this however is not a bitter. It's more of a session scottish ale... maybe what would be called a 60 Shilling Ale in Scottland. Pours a slightly hazy deep amber with a thin but persistent tan head that leaves behind some patches of lace. Aroma is a mix of caramel, toffee, and some light bread notes with a touch of espresso. Flavor begins sweet with malty notes of caramel, and chocolate, finishing with some smokiness, notes of tobacco, and a touch of coffee. Bitterness is low, and mainly just there for balance. Mouthfeel is light with low carbonation. This is a mighty fine Scottish Ale... very easy to drink but quite complex. One hell of a good session ale!","zerk","Jul 01, 2004"

4.5,19.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From the Inveralmond Brewery in Scotland comes an astonishingly full-flavored session ale. Its slightly hazy (it's bottle-conditioned), deep copper colored body borders on chestnut; resting gently geneath a long-lasting head of creamy white foam as its very fine bubbles slowly rise to the surface. The nose displays a distinctly rich, caramel-drenched maltiness. The body is surprisingly full, adding to a fuller perception of malt in the flavour; and its very fine, natural carbonation leaves it exceptionally creamy and smooth across the palate. In the flavor, a hint of some darker malts (perhaps a touch of roasted barley) lend depth to its rich, caramel side; and some subtle, delicately spicy and grassy hops round it out. The maltiness is perfectly balanced by its firm bitterness, and leads to a dry finish (that's again surprising given its full maltiness). A really well brewed beer that shows a clean fermentation and impeccable sense of balance. Quite exceptional, and certainly one of the best Scottish ales available at this time!","NeroFiddled","Jun 19, 2004"
4.22,12.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Medium brown and clear appearance. Sturdy pale yellow head, long lasting and creamy -- settles at under 1/2 an inch. Laces in partial drips. Nice aroma, toffee with jazzy nutmeg and a definite floral hopping showing through. Smooth mouthfeel, a little light but quaffable. Starts with butterscotch and some maple sugar, very nice transition to a cinnamony and prickly hop. Finishes lightly but continuing in the enhanced bittering, like a sound turning up. A thumb's up brew in my book, composed, subtle, but making a point.","ADR","Jun 03, 2004"
