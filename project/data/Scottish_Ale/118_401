By acetic blackcurrant smell and taste it reminds me of Porterhouse Oyster Stout and Sam Smith's Taddy Porter. By bitterness it's untypical Scottish Ale. Very original beer. I suppose it would be even better paired with appropriate food. Skull Splitter is better, though.","hansavijaticar","Jan 13, 2015"

Vey rich complex nose of sweet caramel, hints of dark fruit (plums), pear (as it warms), toffee with light coffee notes and a hint of roast and chocolate.  Very light medium body with just a touch of smoothness.  Average carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is well below average in intensity, complex and well balanced.  It begins rather bland, but comes alive in the middle.  Dark fruits become evident along with the other flavors of the nose except for the caramel - it is totally absent.  The long finish has a hop note.  Perhaps this bottle is old, but since they don't bottle date...","tillmac62","Dec 01, 2014"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/6/2011. Pours lightly cloudy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, toffee, molasses, toast, raisin, plum, pear, apple, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, dark bread, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, pear, light roast, herbal, light pepper, light leather, and toast/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, dark bread, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, pear, light roast, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.6%. Overall this is a damn nice Scottish ale! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

As Scottish ales go, this one is actually a bit thin in the nose, but the taste more than compensates. It's not overpowering, but is a subtle and complex mix of dried fruity things, leather, burlap, rope and a teeny bit of smoke, perhaps? It will require many more bottles to sort it all out. I had this pint with a handful of chocolate-covered espresso beans and, toward the end, a fistful of chocolate jimmies (the cheap, waxy kind from Stop & Shop), neither of which put a dent in the taste of this beer.

The beer could improve with a bit more heft, but that being said, there is a very nice caramel, butterscotch, and smoked peat type flavor to the beer. The sweetish dark malts blend nicely with the caramel flavors to create a nice balanced, although thin, Scottish Ale. I had this with salmon and it was a very nice complement. The aftertaste is very mild as is the beer overall. This is worth seeking out.","albern","Dec 30, 2010"

The taste is pretty good though not up to the standard that the nose set. dark malt, chocolate and some roasty flavors. All flavors are less substantial then the nose as well. Unfortunately there is a metallic taste soon upon first taste. The mouthful is very nice too. Mild carbonation structure makes this beer very smooth and easy drinking. Light/medium body.

4.03,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. It's it's far darker than I expected for a Scotish Ale. It almost pours out black, but it's a bit decieving. When you hold it up to the light it's a deep amber/red/brown mix of colors. THe small parts you can see through actually has a little bit of clarity. A little lacing but not a whole lot. The smell is very unique. It has the major characteristics of both a Scotish Ale and an English Porter. Slight citrus smell, but big dark malt aromas. Toffee, caramelized and chocolate malts. The taste sets itself apart slightly from the smell, and maintains the same complexity. Big dark malt charactheristics. Roasted, chocolate, caramel, and even sligthlty burned malts. A little smokey, maybe peat. There's only a slight hop tates, but you have to look for it. I only noticed it because because my bitter tastebuds are working at the end of each sip. The mouthfeel is good, here's where you can really feel the mix of the two styles. It has the creaminess of a scottish ale and the smokeyness of a porter. Pretty drinkable with all that is going on. All in all a pretty good beer.","AndyAvalanche","Jun 13, 2010"

Slightly buttery smell mixed with chocolate malts and hints of coffee as well as a decent fruit smell (think berries). A sharp, juicy fruit splash on the front of the tongue greets me; akin to cherries or figs. Then a medium-sized smooth and creamy body passes over my tongue with a mix of bitter chocolate, coffee malt and for balance some hop bitterness.

The back label of the bottle describes it in the exact same way, but I thought it before I read it! Taste follows suit - chocolate malts, stronger coffee taste throughout, black cherries. Some astringency. A bit sweet, yet finishes dry, with a long lingering smokiness that I find to be the most pleasant aspect of the beer, being the fan of Islay scotch that I am. It makes me want to drink it slower to savor that, but the light body says keep going. I'm unfamiliar with the scottish ale style, but in terms I understand, this is a porter with less roastiness and more fruitness. Really complex and flavorful for its strength.","redmagik99","Jul 24, 2009"

4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark Island started off great, but ended a little thin. Upon opening, it had a pleasant aroma followed by multiple tastes that rushed through my taste buds. You can taste a subtle hint of chocolate, the roast, and it leaves a long lasting coffee/caramel after taste. I sampled 1 pint/500 ml and it became a little too carbonated and thin about half way through and started reminding me of a Stewart's Root Beer. The color is dark brown but not opaque. It has a medium thickness in pour with a light chocolate colored head that formed nicely in the beginning, however, settled by mid-beer.

Not really what I was expecting here, maybe it is the full body. The feel is very smooth and chewy, quite balanced. The drinkability is fine. No off flavors and good feel.

There are many different flavors to choose from. It has a buttery smooth feel, although a bit flimsy....tastes like toffee, butter, figs, wooden barrel (bourbon?), and a dash of coffee bean.

Intermittent lacing. Big nose of roasted malts and chocolate malts. The flavors were quite enjoyable, roasted malt again up front followed by peat smoke and then a long, distinct milk chocolate finish that coats the tongue. Medium to full bodied and medium carbonation. Though technically a Scottish Ale it drinks more like a Porter and as such is not varietally correct but all the more enjoyable for those like myself who prefer darker brews.

As expected, the appearance is a solid brown color with a tawny tan head that shows a lot of creaminess and lacing. The taste of the beer does a backflip, giving a lot of syrup-sweet maltiness, rich dark figs, dates, plumbs, and grapes. The beer holds firm with woody, earthy, smoky flavors showing midway through the sip and increasing into the finish. Moderately hopped for bitterness but no hop aroma or flavor. Certainly balanced toward the malts. Despite such bold flavors, the feel is lighter than expected, but without thinning or becomming watery; remains creamy throughout.

This is an interesting beer, I was not expecting this at all. The smoke actually adds something like sweetness, which couples with the residual malt sugars.

Distant (at best) Scotch notes but I only say that because its listed as a Scotch ale. Otherwise, as a stout, or just general dark beer this is excellent. Aroma of a deep, British porter (think Fullers). Excellent water with well-rounded finish.

Pours a dark dark brown/black with very little head. Aroma is rich, malty, almost like a toned down JW Lees with a hint of conac. Taste is much of the same... ripe fruits, roasted malt, and a pleasant sweetness. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but I think that is a result of holding on to this one a bit too long.","ChrisBowers","Sep 07, 2004"

Aroma is subdued and has some toffee and peaty smokiness. Mouthfeel has medium carbonation, is rich and slightly creamy, and has a mild hops sting. Sweet toffee and caramel lead the malt dominance. There is a smoky peat taste that echoes the nose, and a hops balance that wavers between fruity and floral. Finish is somewhat bitter, and this ale is well balanced, overall. Distinctively Scottish, and nicely drinkable, but not the best offering from Orkney.","merlin48","Mar 01, 2004"

Ever so slightly toasted, but still much lighter than a Porter or Stout. Exactly the sort of beer I'd want in massive quantities to go with a nice hearty meaty dinner.

Hints of ruby along the edges as it is held to the light. Head is bubbly and light brown. Held up nicely. Faint smells of ovaltine and smoked peat. First taste is toasted malt again, some peat, and hints of chocolate creaminess. Maybe some roasted plums or something in there as well. The taste of this beer is nearly exception to begin with, then it seemed to get a little slick, and watery as the beer warmed a bit. The flavors seemed to drown out, if that's possible. Still very good and exactly the kind of beer I was hoping to find in Scotland. A real treat on tap.","StevieW","Jul 27, 2003"
4.37,10.1,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Very rich and malty in the mouth. Chocolate predominates, but its also a touch winey.

4.1,3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured in the glass a deep chocolate brown color that had ruby red highlights when held to the light. It was crystal clear and few carbonation bubbles were noticed. The foam that sat atop of the beer was a medium to cocoa powder tan that when poured aggressively produced a decent head that was thick but not long lasting. When it subsided it left a thick ring around the edges that helped leave a decent lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were at first big chocolates, followed by sweet and roasted malts, vanilla bean, coffee, light smoke, sweet dark fruit, and licorice. The flavors that rolled across my tongue were of roasted malts, chocolates  bitter and creamy milk -, dark fruit, slight citrus, a dry cocoa powder, tobacco, and some peat. It left a roasted nut feel behind that had a hint of sweetness to it as an aftertaste. This beer was surprisingly smooth and very drinkable. I wish 2 things from it 1) More alcohol, and 2) a bigger bottle. A really good drink.","Jarod","May 21, 2003"

Nose is fruity, vinous, sensations of cherries, grapes, other dark fruits, but mildly, plus some spiciness, cloves, etc. Medium carbonation. Solid malt, and minimal hop presence. Thick and full, a perfect fit for a damp, cold, dark island, an ideal comfort for a gloomy atmosphere.

The finishing taste is nice, dry and fruity, which goes down nice and smooth.I had my girlfriend try it, she likes light beers, and she really liked it. I had to fight her to get it back.

Lighter-bodied than I expected, malt is weighted toward a gingerbread sense with a little impression of coffee.  Then, the flavor thins a lot and gets more candy-like and stifling.  Interesting, but a weak closer in the flavor department, to me.","ADR","Oct 19, 2002"
4.07,2.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"A very complex beer.  Dark brown/ruby color with slight tan head that drops to a collar throughout the drinking session; lacing well.  The smell is a wonderful chocolate and malty nose.  The taste is a bit vinous, very malty sweet, with good notes of bitterness and chocolate and roasted malt blending in.  I understand they use Golden Promise malt as a base malt and Challenger hops, which may account for the fruity undertones.  Overall a nice beer in the bottle that only hints at its full potential as a cask-conditioned ale....","brakspear","Sep 16, 2002"
4.44,11.8,3.5,4.5,5,3.5,4,"Opaque brown in color with a tan head that drops quickly to a decent collar and whispy foam across the surface and leaving just some light lace. The aroma offers a light dark fruit note, a sweet caramel maltiness, and a soft espresso-like roastiness. The body is light, the carbonation limited, and the mouthfeel oily. The flavor, however, is richly malty and quite complex with notes of dark chocolate, burnt caramel, coffee, biscuit, and soft dark fruits. The finish is sweet, even candyish at times, with a light fudge-like note - but always well balanced by an underlying bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. Although this is a Scottish ale, a warmer serving temperature closer to British standards seems to display its character best. Worth trying, but not worth seeking. Probably very nice cask-conditioned.","NeroFiddled","Sep 04, 2002"
4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4,4,5,"Slightly hazy deep garnet hue topped by a light beige head that recedes into a thin but dense lace leaving layer. Treacle and dark fruity esters reminescent of prune dominate the aroma, with dark caramel malt and roasted barley secondary. Very enjoyable aromawise.  Roasted barley and hop bitterness is well offset by a dark caramel sweetness. Slightly tart fruity esters combined w/ residual sweetness lend a subtle sweet/tart note that integrates well with the prominent dark caramel.  Lightly bodied, but not at all weak considering the low gravity.  Finishes abruptly clean and a bit dry, w/ light residual sugars quickly fading.  Dark Island has deep flavor for a beer of low relative strength.  An ideal session brew.","marc77","Aug 13, 2002"
4.03,1.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Wonderfully rich, dark appearance. A nicely pulled pint, with a creamy, dense head. Sweetish, light molasses, raisin bready aroma. Fruitiness, hop and some very mild peat interplay to make this a bittersweet treat. I thought as I quaffed, that this could be catagorized as a dark mild as well. The body is substantial enough without being too heavy. A fine brew.","John","Jun 10, 2002"
