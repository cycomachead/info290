"I am neutral on this beer."
"Interesting beer--good after dinner. I had it in London out of the bottle. I wouldn't want this to be my everyday drink."
"Poured Deep amber with little to no head.Very carbonated. Oak and vanilla notes pull strong through the nose. very satisfying smell. Feels light in the mouth. Starts off slightly sweet then transitions to zesty as it hits the back of your mouth."

"Poured a dark amber with minimal head. Rich aroma, warm tastes. Not very carbonated."

"Classic skunked I&G smell. Taste is sweet, caramel, oak and skunkiness. This is awful, but oddly enough, I will not drain pour this."

"Overall, really nice cold-weather flavors in a relatively low ABV.  Perfect for fall.  Great base beer, and the oak makes it better."

"mouthfeel, with a lot of smooth oak and a hint of vanilla in there.  Nice."

"full bodied with wood great flavor. Vanilla and toffee flavors could only be detected after about 20 seconds. Very slight bitterness and moderate sweetness. Medium carbonation. great taste"

"Taste: Medium bodied with wood a little too prominent in the flavour. Vanilla and toffee flavours could only be detected after about 20 seconds. Very slight bitterness and moderate sweetness. Medium carbonation. Definitely drinkable, but perhaps could be improved with a little less oak."

"Overall... a british ale but malty and sweet. Drinkable."
""
""
""
""

"I for one am very happy for this accident of a beer and glad that many others have enjoyed it as well and made it so widely available. Innis and Gunn have since expanded the brand and made many wonderful variations."

"Picked up a mixed 4 pack of Innis and Gunn because I am Scottish. Good looking and smelling beer with an outstanding flavor. One of better beers for me so far but not a great value overall do to cost versus quality. Probably won't try again but certainly would drink if available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty low key barrel aged beer, probably good for people who want to try the style without diving in too deeply."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: A classic English Sunday roast would sort this ale out quick-time! Don't forget the Yorkshire pudding ;-)"
""
""
""
""
""
"The smooth full body an do skinless of this beer was really different to anything I have tasted. They must really chip this beer to get that oak flavour. But there is a lovely vanilla flavour to it as well which lightens the taste. Nice head held by the wheat. A vey satisfying beer I. A rather small bottle."
""
""
""
""
"o- I couldn't finish the beer. the oak bourbon taste and skunk smell were too much. I was looking for something different and thought I'd give it a try. I won't be returning"

"Had on tap for the purpose of this review but have tried this from the bottle on many prior occasions ... This was one of the brews that first introduced me to a life beyond Molson Pilsener and other industrial lagers. It is widely available and the description on the bottle sparks considerable interest. Whiskey and vanilla eh? Alright. A reddish bronze beer with unassuming white foam, smells like mellow brown sugar or butterscotch, what I would describe as a corn sugar sort of sweetness, hints of floral vanilla and green grass, and a dry oakiness that evokes whiskey. Tastes much like it smells, with the same basic elements just listed except that the taste is much more woody, dry, and somewhat earthy. Less sweet than the aroma would suggest and feels somewhat like a lager: Thinnish body and rather assertive carbonation. Hints of bread crust, tobacco, and some other floral note flit in and out of the whisky-like, woody, semi-sweet murk. Its just OK in my view. I prefer a few other Innis & Gunn offerings. The vanilla is great but I'd tone down the barrel flavor and amp up the caramel, thicken up the body and add a few extra layers of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer really makes me appreciate and recognize the characteristics wood aging can impart. It's a simple beer, with a boost from the oak."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very great tasting beer, feels nice in the mouth, and almost a luxurious taste. A little more sweet than I normally like, but this is not a downfall, as it is pretty balanced. Reminds me of juice or vanilla cake. A little less complex than I imagined but this was brewed very well and there are other beers by Innis & gunn that have darker, more bitter notes. Definitely no hoppy taste in this one. More carbonation would be nice. Very well done and a pleasing beer. I almost drank the whole beer whilst writing this review!"

"This beer has a good body, appropriate for style, an even medium strength with some heft (but not thickness) and brightness, lightly crisp and plenty smooth. It's semi-dry for the entirety of every sip beyond the sweeter opening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, you can't say this beer doesn't showcase the oak aging. Unfortunately, aside from the wood, there just isn't much there."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall a great representation of the style!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice oak aged beer that displays the barrels nicely. Not to much in the way of the barrel, so it really shines through. A good dessert beer because of the sweetness, but not a bad any-time beer either"
""
""
"Overall; Very good, indeed! I'm not a huge fan of Scottish Ales per se, but this one I'd get again without reservation. Very drinkable and complex"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - As my first time trying this, I walked away with a pretty nice impression of it. Although I read a description of the beer before I ordered, the beer just destroyed any expectation I had of it, in a good way. This may not be the best beer to try for those just getting into it, but everyone should try it at least once."
""
"Very pleasant and mellow overall. Sometimes, you just want a mellow beer with the barrel aged characteristics, and Innis & Gunn provides that."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its complex flavoring. While each component was decently represented in quality, the variety of fruits, malts, oak, and liquored flavoring was quite impressive. With each sip you were given all of that European whiskey flavoring, without all of that fusel alcoholic afterpunch. The feel was thin and overly prickled for the style, contributing little, and only minimally enhancing the experience. Otherwise the aroma and the taste were wrought with sweet and bready esters which, by the end, effectively drowned out a lot of those initial intricacies."

"O- great oak aged beer, a real joy to sip on in bad weather"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer. Though sweet with strong vanilla and cherry flavours this beer goes down very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The worst beer that I've ever had."
""
""
"Pours a clear caramel color with a multitude of bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Zero head present along with minimal lacing. The nose has a decidedly lager like character with faint notes of caramel malt and oak. Not really getting any of what I would classify as Scottish character. The taste features plenty of oak, mellow bourbon and vanilla character, and again a dry bready lager yeast character. The taste is rather thin and seems to have more flavor from the oak than from the base beer. Mouthfeel is way over carbonated with a very light body. This one is not working well for me. Kinda reminds me of the AB Winter Cask Ale, bland and watery with some vanilla and oak character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For what it is, a scottish ale that emphasizes oak aging, its a solid beer. Not a lot of bite or umph to it, but has nice flavor and body to it and the oak is balanced in the palate nicely."
""
""
""
"A beer you'd enjoy were it a soft drink. Sweet and natural tasting, it is satisfying, with taste you can't ignore, if you'd even want to. If a bar serves this drink I sincerely recommend you take your opportunity to enjoy a sweet oaky delight even if the price makes you hesitant."

"O - This is definitely a mild beer used to highlight the barrel-aged flavors. I prefer a solid beer with barrel-aged notes. It's not bad, but not worth choosing over the many other barrel-aged beers out there."
"Not a big fan of the Innis and Gunn beers. Seem kind of mellow to me, and a bit bland. Normally I would be more neutral, but this beer had spice notes which put me off."
"This didn't look or smell like much but it was deceptively complex. The typical caramel, apple, and butterscotch notes are there. The oak adds some vanilla and woody, earthy notes as well. It's not great, but it's worth a try."

"To the average, casual lager drinker, Innis and Gunn Original is mind-shattering stuff. To many in the craft beer world, Innis and Gunn is kitschy and underwhelming. I've always felt that the truth lay somewhere in the middle. Regardless of your tastes, this brewery has made a lot of headway in expanding the palates (and minds) of the general public."
"O: A very unique and interesting beer. If you're in the right mood for it, it's an excellent beer."
""
""
"I'd drink again."
"M - Very smooth, little carbonation, medium body. Crisp finish, alcohol not very noticeable."
""
""
"O: Best ale we tried in the UK. Smooth, bourbon-y and delicious. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"DO NOT drink this straight out of the bottle; pour it into a glass. Like any nuanced beer, the aromas bloom when allowed to open up."
""
""
"This beer..you can drink it 10,000 different times and pick up something else that you like about it every time you drink it. I highly suggest drinking this beer if you like a beer that has a hint of Oak and a smooth after taste, also try this with any kind of buttery meal (Ie a steak with butter on it or a pork chop with mash potatoes and butter)...Cheers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin head on a clear bright golden body. Aroma is a touch mild with oak and cedar wood dominating with notes of grain, orange and pale malt. Flavor is very bourbon or whiskey like just less sharp with oak in the finish. Imagine a whiskey that doesn't make take you back that you can take a mouthful of as oppose to sip. Smoothness of a nicely aged bourbon. Light to medium body and light carbonation. As a whiskey drinker this beer is both intriguing, memorable and tasty."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a good beer but considering the price there are better alternatives that are similar and less expensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I feel like this would be better if it came in a darker bottle, shielded from the light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The cask age didn't impart too much of an oak flavor. It would definitely be interesting to try this beer if it was aged a little bit longer."
""
""
"extremely clear yellow orange pour into an innis & gunn glass. small amount of head quickly diminished into a surrounding foam. smells of bourbon, caramel, oak (very boozy smell), smoked. tastes of very light vanilla, smooth bourbon, a semi sweet after taste of caramel and oak. a very nice mellow display of bourbon barrel aging. light bodied, but gives off a warming sensation that makes it a slow drinking beer. this is a great anytimer - i had been meaning to try this beer for a long time but got carried away in domestic craft stuff so i never got around to this. did a trade with someone in TN and they had a 3pack with a glass gift set so he included it in the trade. i'm very glad this happened and i have 2 other versions of this beer to drink still!"

"Scotch Ales have become a wild array of different kinds of beer. To call this one is no longer a stretch. Innis & Gunn sold me on their oak-aged product. I love the brewery backstory and I like the beer. I've got a couple of Rum Casks waiting to be cracked soon from them. Stay tuned for that review. 4.0"
"Overall: A fantastic beer that I shall return to. Maybe try the rum cask one."
"O - Pretty good overall, but not somwthig I would seek out. Despite the slight skunkiness, I feel like I got a goodrepresentation if what this beer is all about. Pretty easy drinking, with sweetness kept in check."

"Pours a clear coppery amber color, little cap of khaki froth, little retention. Scent brings strong vanilla, coconut, toffee notes, light hints of wood and whiskey, some hints of fruit. Taste follows scent, lighter based beer brings strong wood and vanilla notes from the front, settles into a delicious toffee flavor, sweet and nutty, light notes of whiskey and faint faint char, grassy and floral hops, faint off herbal presence. Medium bodied, slightly high in carbonation. Overall, nice scent and tastes, but lacks a touch of subtlety and complexity i'm accustomed to with those flavors. Highly approachable."
""
"Fine carbonation as well serves for a basically perfect beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer. Kinda reminds me of a weird Sam Smith Pale ale, but I prefer Sam Smith to this."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this, though. It's an interesting idea with good flavor notes that goes down very easily."
""
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ap0U9KFLyk"
"Overall a very original and enjoyable beer. Probably the one of the best beers I've had from Edinburgh."
"Overall- A must. This and their rum cask are two must tries. However their rum cask is superior. Don't pass on either, you'll be cheating yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was impressed with this beer. At first, the aroma turned me off a little bit, but the taste and drinkability turned things around. Solid beer oveerall and can't wait to try some of their other brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting effort, but I don't find myself falling in love. It's biggest flaw, in my opinion, is the excess of extraneous flavours rather than an emphesis on the 'beer' character. It has some complexity, but it's too sweet, with too much toffee and vanilla - these flavours dominate everything else. It would be improved by a more robust maltiness that stands up to the oak and creates a better balance. Anyway, try it for interest, once."
""
""
"O/D - Not bad. Tasty. Lacks complexity and is too sweet but a tasty tipple nonetheless. I couldn't have more than one though."
""
"Overall I wasn't expecting much since the clear bottle but I will be damned if this isn't the best Scottish ale I ever drank. Medium sticky body, nice sweet malt flavors, and a low ABV if it was found closer to me I would enjoy a couple a sitting. Great beer!"
""
""
"O: An interesting beer. The vanilla flavor is a little overwhelming. Purely a sweet beer, nothing bitter here at all."
""
""
"The oak flavor intensifies with time as well as a spicy sort of raisin note, maybe a bit too much for me. Always wondered about this beer, decent I suppose, on to the Whiskey version next."
""
"Overall this isn't that great of a beer. It is too sweet without anything to balance it out. Glad I got to try it, though."
"O- The wood is the dominant player but it is not overpowering and gets some very nice subtle support from the malt flavor underneath. I was nervous about the clear bottles but it was tasty and didn't suffer any noticeable change."
""
""
""
""
"A satisfying beer overall that complements meat and potatoes type meals."
""
""
"I want to bet this is skunked in spite of the low IBUs, but I'm going to fault it for that anyway because I didn't leave it out in the sun, and even though I can't speak for how long it may have been out on the shelf in the store, it's irresponsible to put beer in clear bottles, no matter low the hop content is or how nice it looks. (For the record, it does look nice, and I don't like hops anyway). Jury's still out for me-- part skunky macro lager, part Scottish ale, part lovely oak character. The pros and cons balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - While I don’t mind the sweet flavor, an 11.2oz serving of it is a bit much. Like I said, it’s not that the sweetness even needs to be toned down, just balanced a little. It’s good, and I enjoyed it, but it’s not something I’ll go looking for, and it’s not something I could drink more than one of."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is a very nice beer. A very tasty beer. Better then the Christmas ale they make and on par with the Rum Cask Oak aged beer. A must try."
""
"very carbonated and very little head and has a amber color but does not feel like a beer to my taste buds just to fizzy for me."
""
""
""
"This poured out as a amber color with a cream colored foamed head that has a very thin retention on top. The smell of the beer was sweet, a little bit of wood on the nose and some other light earthy notes. The taste of the beer was much different than most Oak aged beers I've had. This one was sweet with some hints of vanilla and caramel. I was expecting a little more of a sour flavor to it but it was way sweeter than expected. The sweetness dies down a bit the more you drink. The finish is grainy and dry with not a lot of bitterness. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, the carbonation was low also. Overall I loved the look of the beer in the bottle but after having it I wasn't overly impressed. I have a bottle of the Rum Barrel version that I'll try one day, I'm hoping that one will have a little more depth to it."
""
"Poured an amber in color. Virtually no lacing with a very slight beige head. Nice smell of vanilla and oak. Very much a sweet smell. First sip offers more carbonation than it looked with the initial pour. Mouthful semi thick, must go with the sweetness of this beer. Nice mixture of oak and vanilla in taste. Neither one overpowering. Overall not a bad beer. Not one that I would have normally have bought. It was recommended by the owner of the local package store. Though I am new to this, I try to rate each beer on kind of beer it is rather than my personal preference. So that being said, this is not a bad beer. If I was into this style I would buy again."
""
"I've had a sample of the Rum Cask before and do remember enjoying that a bit more (I'll have to get some bottles to revisit), but I'm beginning to have a renowned appreciation for this beer. It's subtly complex and flavorful, while retaining an amazing balance. This will not be the last 4-pack of this beer my refrigerator ever sees."
"I hope more of this beer is imported-- in solid boxes to prevent this from being lightstruck!"
"Well balanced and smoky through to the aftertaste. A little lighter in body and mouthfeel than I prefer but definitely complex and interesting. Malt sweetness breaks through for a bit before being overwhelmed in the finish by the wood and burnt. Enjoyable and different, and would look great in a classy brown bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I started with the rum cask ale first which honestly skewered my taste even though it's been a few weeks. This beer by comparison is almost bland. Good, but not as good as the rum!"
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams Glass. Pours a light amber with adequate head and lacing. Light oak aroma predominates. Just like the bottle sez, natural hints of Toffee, Vanilla, and Oak but I also get a slight Scotch flavor. Light mouthfeel. Okay, I'm into hop bombs - this is not at all a beer I should be interested in. But - this is fantastic! A delicate concoction so flavorful and yet so subtle and well-balanced."
"Overall.- A great beer this is one of my favorite."
""
"O: Really good scotch aged on oak. Pretty much a standard to base most oaked scotch ales. It's really mild which I like. Although change the bottle to brown to prevent lightstruck!"
""
"good beer. an a or a- in my book"
""
""
""
"O: Overall a smooth drinker. As a Scottish ale some mixed feelings. The malting seemed a bit thin, and the toffee/caramel notes were exaggerated to the point where it was like a liquid twix candy bar. The oaky vanilla character was a nice twist, but seemed to overtake the malt character of the beer. Color was lighter then most per style, didn’t have the full malt body, and lacked a touch of smokiness. More slick and wet then dry from roasted malting. A neat flavor and twist, a bit deviant by style, but makes for an interesting try and you cant fault that."

"salud..."
"Overall - I was happy to see this one on tap at a local restaurant. It's not a mind blowing beer but the taste is well balanced and it's very drinkable. I could also see this beer working well as a gateway beer to get people into craft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A glass of single malt scotch as a glass of beer. Worth a shot."
""
"Pretty typical Innis & Gunn flavours."
""
""
""
""
""
"-Overall 4.0: Good beer. Whereas the rum cask was a completed puzzle, this beer is a jigsaw with a few pieces missing. Nonetheless, I recommend it, especially to those not spoiled by the rum cask like myself."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Interestingly, taste is unlike the smell ... and that's a good thing. Aroma is typical lager, run-of-the-mill beer. But the taste is anything but typical! There is a sweet, toffeeish taste ... this could be fantasticly refreshing beer for a hot, summer day!"
""
""
"Get the gift pack as the regular 4 packs are probably skunked to high heaven."
"Overall, not bad. I can see why this is the top selling UK-brewed beer in Canada and is starting to gain a reputation a little here in the states. Very hedonistic and so easy drinking. In fact, my biggest flaw with this is how easy-going it is. I could kill a 4pk in about half-an-hour."
"12 oz into a Duvel tulip. Probably not the correct glass. I guess the correct glass came in this gift pack. Oh well, the tulip probably brings out the truer nose anyway. Appearance isn't very exciting. Clean clear body with a moderate head. However, as soon as I take a whiff, this beer gets interesting. Lots of woodiness and a hint of aged whiskey. Perhaps I am imagining that, as I'm not sure they even used whiskey barrels. Mellow hops balance the beer, but it is a little on the sweet side, even for a UK style pale ale. Alcohol content is high and it hides it well. Has a lot of energy in the mouth and is smooth. Not something I'd drink every day, but recommended to try. A good example of how to properly age beer in barrels."
"Received a set of three bottles as a gift with an expiration date only one month away. While the bottle was clear, the set came in a cardboard box, so the contents were kept safe and tasted fresh. Opened a bottle with a pot pie dinner. They color was a bright copper color. I was a little concerned about this being too spicy, but the scent is surprisingly mild. And while it is sweet, the taste is not overpowering. Definitely has an oak aged taste, but it is surprisingly light and drinkable. The mouthfeel was very light, but had an appropriately complex aftertaste. At 6.6 percent there is no strong tinge of alcohol either. It is overall a good beer, but exists in a grey area where I would not want to have 4-6 of them, but it did not feel special enough to be content with just one. Kind of a novelty, but overall well done."
"Overall -- Certainly unique, but those clear bottles are a gamble. Worth a try if you are down to buy the gift pack and avoid skunking."
"I was pleasantry surprised by this brew. Would highly recommend it. I really want to taste the other oak aged brews in the future."
"This tasted a lot strong than it actually was, but that's probably because this is so distinct and didn't seem like beer at all to me. The oak-amber hue and label didn't help either but there's no doubt that a brew like this pushes the boundaries of what's possible with beer. I can't say that I'd always reach for one of these when I'm thirsty but I'm still eager to try the other 2 bottles in the pack that this came with."
"Supposedly this beer originated as flavor fodder for casks that would hold scotch. I'd like to try the scotch."
"Give it a try, it's quite different!"
"QUITE DELIGHTFUL, PICK THIS UP!"
"Overall, this is a decent beer. The same qualities that make it popular also make it less-than-exceptional"
"Overall, I found this to be a complex beer but not muddled -- it all ties together very well."
"Great brew and a real treat to get it on tap"
"Out of a bottle this beer was an orange/amber color with one finger of off-white head. It laced in thin, sliding bands and retained as a collar. The aroma was of oak, dry malt, some nuts and a little cave-aged must. The flavors were delicious! Toasted malt, sweet malt, butter, toffee, vanilla, nuts and caramel. The mouthfeel was frothy, the body medium and the carbonation medium."
"O-its an interesting and enjoyable beer. it has some loose ends to tie up, and it could be completely amazing. unfortunately we all know that recipes in european beers are rarely subject to change. if it tasted more like it smelled, it could be a reoccurring guest to my line up."
"Overall: I really like this beer. It may not be really complex but it has a very unique taste. I have not seen many oak aged beers. I will definitely try this again."
"O: I think this is a pretty solid brew. I could see myself picking up a few bottles at my local bottle shop if I was in the mood for a light, sweet beer with solid flavors."
"I wouldnt have this again, but would not say its a bad beer, just not my cup of tea."
"O - Interesting flavor combination. A pale ale but more like a Scotch ale."
"After so many people raved about it recently, I figured I'd give this brew a shot. It pours a clear sunset amber topped by a half-finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose is kinda weak, comprising light toffee, honey, very light greens, sweet flowers, and a touch of wheat bread. The taste is more robust, with notes of caramel, vanilla, light wet oak, maple syrup, light honey, sweet flowers, and wet heather. It's a unique flavor combination to say the least, but it all ends up making me smile. The body is a light medium, with a mild carbonation and a slickly smooth feel. Overall, an interesting, tasty brew, one that lived up to the praise heaped upon it 'round here."
"O/D-This is a love it or hate it beer. I happen to love whiskey and scotch. I also happen to enjoy this beer. Its all oak. Not much malt, no hops. It interesting and I enjoyed it but would not regularly drink it. They definitely accomplished their goal here. So impressed by the oak."
"Overall this is a rather good beer but it's just not fully top tier to me. I greatly prefer their rum barrel aged. To me that's the step up into the mid to high A range."
"O: Didn't really like the look and feel of the beer. They go together I guess. For me the sweetness and buttery flavor knocked a point or two off the overall beer."
"price point - got this 4pk for $8.99"
"O: A good but not great beer. Enjoyed it but not looking for another anytime soon. It served as a nice nightcap for me."
"I don't think I'll get this again, not bad but not great."
"O: Beer is exactly what is says it is....an Oak Aged Beer, and it tastes just like that...but almost like I have a piece of oak in my mouth and not in my beer...would probably pass on this the next time I come across it....but worth a try.."
"O: I rathered enjoyed thsi beer. Not something I would seek out, but it was good and I would definitely get it again."
"This is more a sipper than a session ale, but regardless it's a tasty beer and a fine Scottish ale. Wasn't sure if I was a fan of oak-aged beer after trying I&G's blonde ale, but I found this stuff quite a bit more enjoyable. Definitely worth a try."
"O - Excellent bee with a unique and wonderfully nutty and caramel flavor, that would take you from wood to caramelized vanilla."
"O: An easy drinker, due to the sweetness I consider this a ""dessert beer"" or a digestif due to its taste profile."
"This cannot be compared to traditional brews of any sort. It has a full mouthfeel and definitely not a session beer. A great beer for one or two on a cold night."
"Poured a 2"" white head which disappeared completely pretty fast. Body is a clear light tea yellow/brown. Smell was the biggest put-off because thanks to the clear glass bottle and time on the shelf it was moderately skunked. Taste surprisingly showed none of the skunking and had very mild toffee and vanilla, like the label advertised but milder than I expected. Body is lighter weight than I'd anticipate from barrel aging, just a step up from water. All in all enjoyable flavor but hardly worth the hype."
"Body is admittedly a bit thin and watery, though not a dealbreaker. Carbonation is light, the flavors carry it basically. Not bad, could easily have a couple. Far better than the ""Rum Cask"" version that we tried recently. Expecting an aged English Pale ale to be hoppy is like expecting a puppy to be well behaved without training."
"I saw that this was being imported into the US. Thought it important to offer my opinion directly and clearly. Avoid this beer."
"O- Not my style. Way too sweet without many true beer attributes... I would not buy this again for myself, though my girlfriend did like it. Really not much to say about this beer"
"O: This is a good beer; it tastes like wood, but none the less it is good. It tastes like it looks, much better than how it smells or feels."
"O: Best beer I've had out of a clear bottle. Wouldn't drink very often personally, but would never refuse if offered."
"Overall - great beer, this is possibly a taste best suited for those who also like whiskey/bourbon but is a brilliant beer all round and i highly recommend picking up a bottle if given the chance, you wont regret it"
"A good brew I have had it in my hands a few time and never pulled the plug on buying it. I will the next time I see it though."
"This beer poured a slighty darker yellow color, with a decent size head that didnt hang around too long. The smell was almost a bit sweet, with a strong toffee aroma. The taste was complex, while on the lighter side for an EPA, there was a strong vanilla and toffee flavor, a bit of the oak from the ageing barrel can be tasted as well. The flavor could be a bit stronger, espically for an EPA, no hops or bitterness was present. Overall a very intresting beer, but very good. It is not what you expect."
"This one pours a clear pale golden color with a nice big loose white foamy head that fades to surface after an enjoyable hang time. Visibly effervescent throughout the entire sample..another big plus. The nose is HUGE!! All about the sweet vanilla malty creme brulee. By far the most distinguishable and prevalent character of this beverage. The texture is light, well carbonated and super creamy. The vanilla flavor from the nose is true to taste along with big rye whiskey character. That's what I'm talking about!! Very nicely done!! The oak aged treatment is really significant and it lingers REALLY NICELY in the aftertaste...adding significant value to the entire experience. Surprisingly low ABV...only 6.6%. All in all, a VERY DRINKABLE ale!! Very nice effort from the folks back in the home country. This one is probably taking hits for the atypical interpretation of the style...but it's a damn fine drinker! Its popularity in these parts and has earned itself permanent cooler real estate at my favorite watering hole."
"I recommend picking up this bottle because it is very original. Have a new experience!"
"Very rich and full flavor in this beer. Sweet with a balanced harsh/bitter component. Will be sampling again very soon."
"Please try this. I love to drink this with a toasted oatmeal raisin muffin with a good knob of grass-fed unsalted sweet cream butter and top it with a tiny sprinkle of Maldon sea salt flakes. I promise you that it's bewilderingly good."
"Decent beer but not as good as I remember it, but that was prior to trying a lot of great beers. I have a bit of a personal aversion to skunkiness in beers and this one triggers it for me for some reason so it's probably a toss up between my taste being more refined and this one being slightly off. I'll have to try another to see which it is!"
"overall; a fantastic beer, my 1# pick for the style."
"This is overall a great beer i think i could have drunken lots of over a session."
"O: A fine ale, somewhat reminiscent of a good scotch: Oaky and peaty, with a strong taste of malts. Although its relatively thin and very drinkable, it's best enjoyed as a sipper, due to the strong sweetness and vanilla flavour."
"O - Some tasty flavours, though the mouthfeel was a bit of a drawback. The peaty oak flavours nicely complemented the ale and the sweetness made for an enjoyable experience."
"Drinkability: A nice light and mild brew with a light and sweet flavour, almost like a nectar."
"abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"O- Decent flavorful beer. Price was great too. May give this another go."
"O - Very pleasant beer. A lower-alcohol sipper, which is interesting. Definitely seems as if it is much more alcoholic (probably due to the liquor-like flavors) than it actually is."
"D-A very nice, easy drinking beer. I wish they came in 6 packs."
"D - so pleasantly surprised, this is like an extremely smooth single malt scotch that somehow became a beer, rich in flavour to the point that you wouldn't want to session it, but could be enjoyed very regularly"
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. It has so many layers of flavor; you get a new one with each drink. There are many pleasant notes of vanilla, maple, and in some instances, chocolate. I could drink this all the time, and I'm sure it would go great with any meal. Perhaps not a good beer for a hot day in the summer, as its full of flavor. The best part is that you get all of the flavor yet it doesn't sit heavily in your stomach, which is a plus. Try this beer, you'll like it."
"Overall a pretty good beer and easy to drink. It is really expensive though, I'd rather spend $10 on a bottle of Trappist Ale, something from Southern Tier, or a 4-6 pack of Founder's something. I'm happy I got to try it though, thanks Scott S!"
"Drinkability: I could probably do two. To Sweet for anymore, still thats more than you can say for many Scot Ales."
"Frothy cream-colored head over a gorgeous wood brown. Aromas are oak, and there's a hint of skunk ... this bottle may have seen a bit of sunshine. The rum flavors are overwhelming, and I guess I'd rather have rum than skunk! Malty sweetness, not much by way of hoppiness. I couldn't have more than one of these beers at a time, but I'm impressed in the sense that I've never had such a low ABV pale ale with such a massive liquor flavor."
"Drinkability: Though the lack of head and lacing was initially off-putting, a few whiffs of the sweet aromas in my glass turned everything in the right direction. The complexity of the taste and smooth mouthfeel gives this beer a nice finish."
"D. When I first had this I was 'wowed' by the whisky character. This time I wasn't impressed, but there again my palate has changed somewhat, still, it's a nice beer to sip on though."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. However, the vanilla could be a factor as in to how many you can drink. Having said that, it's an overall great tasting Ale."
"Gotta wonder if there is some adjunct present, and adding to its girth, but not necessarily the body? and I'd have a helluva time putting it into a style category. No matter, it's uniquely tasty, smooth and complex."
"M - Light to medium body with some chew. Lightly carbonated."
"A 750mL bottle is almost too much to handle in one sitting. The flavor of this beer is truly excellent, but I find the entire experience is a lot like eating homemade fudge - as terrific as it tastes, eventually one wants something else. An absolute must try, something to sip slowly - with friends, if you have a larger bottle. Great stuff."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Although the diacetyl might be off-putting for some, I think it is a unique quality that you dont find too often. I look forward to trying more from I&G."
"Has a good mouthfeel and is overall a good solid beer I enjoyed very much."
"drinkability- Flavors make this one a little harder to drink. wouldn't want more than 2-3 a night especially at the cost per bottle. However those 2-3 would be very much enjoyed"
"Bottom line, I couldnt find one special characteristic of this beer that separated it from others. But I also could not find any faults."
" Mouthfeel: fairly thick texture lends itself to holding the butterscotchy oak."
"This ale is pretty much medium-bodied. Considering the heavy sweetness of this beer, it thankfully isn't too thick. Drinkability is only average for me. The diacetyl and the oak chip wood pulp flavors make for something I'd only want to have one bottle of. It's not unenjoyable, just a sipper."
"D= A nice ale for a cold night by the fire....like I enjoy my scotch. Not an ale that I would go all night on, not the type of beer you would pound with hot dogs at a ball game...it's a beer to enjoy at your leisure. I can't wait to have more!"
"D - I think this one would definitely be a little too heavy on the sweetness and vanilla to make the grade as a session beer."
"Overall, a very flavorful and interesting beer, the combination of tastes go well together. Although the powerful taste and price would prevent you from drinking more then one a night, it is definitely a treat."
"This is some beer, and adventure. A type of a style not seen here in Albany, where American Pale Ales rule. Unfortunately only 11.2 oz bottles."
"Overall, a nice beer. Worth trying if you see it."
"every once and a while I have one of these but I often find myself waiting for special releases opposed to buying the original"
"I am really enjoying this and think it's a very enjoyable beer."
"D: Its not that this beer is undrinkable... rather... its really hard for me to get past the fact that I feel like the brewer is trying to cover up a bad tasting beer with some barrel-aging. Vanilla and woody notes are nice but the metallic and skunky taste in the background is unmistakable and really ruin it for me. I'll pass next time."
"D: This one is a one and done for me. Drainpour. The price of importing beer."
"D- A very good beer, though the power of the vanilla flavor might limit how many of these I could have in a night."
"D: This is the first of 4 that I'll be tasting from Innis & Gunn. This one was dominated by whiskey and vanilla. Not exactly my favorite beer but if you love whiskey or vanilla you'll for sure enjoy this beer."
"O - I like this beer okay and the taste is unique but don't know that I'm blown away with it. The alcohol hint to finish is annoying to me. There's better that costs less."
"Had potential but the skunk got in the way. Would like to try this on tap..."
"Pours a copper-orange colour with thin white head. Head dissipates quick enough with a faint hint of some lacing. Smells of sweet oaky vanilla with butterscotch. No hops or bitterness present in flavour or nose. Very sweet flavour, lots of vanilla. I think this beer is too light to hold up to the oak flavour, but it isn't bad. Ok carbonation."
"D- Such a beautifully balanced beer that gets trashed with skunk. Such complex flavor profiles and subtle notes. I love vanilla so I am very forgiving on this beer, but the skunk it gets from being in a clear bottle just slaps the delicious in the face. Let this one breath for a while as it gets better as it warms. Maybe I'll find one of these that hasn't had so much light exposure, or maybe I'll just try to clone it and put it in a brown bottle."
"Poured from a clear bottle into my room temperature glass, resulting in a one finger head of foam bubbles. Nice clinging lace once the head calmed down. Color is a 9 on the SRM chart. Aromas of caramel, toffee, pear, apple, and some butterscotch. Tastes of toffee, vanilla, pear, apples, and cinnamon. Good body in my mouth, lots of zip. I like the flavor a lot, although a little pricey, I would buy a few for my own enjoyment and maybe some for my closest friends who like beer."
"I have liked this beer since the first time I tried it. I find it quite different from other ales and try to enjoy it on special occasions!"
"This beer is delicious. I would not be able to finish a 40 on my own as it was quite heavy on the stomach. But, this, to me is a dessert beer, something you would have after a good meal, if you have room left. Afterwards, i wanted coffee. This beer isn't going to be for everyone, but it was absolutely worth trying."
"I have to say I'm impressed with this. With how cheesy the bottle looks, and even being called something like ""Innis and Gunn", which sounds like a cheap 40ozer but I found out today is just the middle names of the two brothers that put the beer into the barrels and sell it. On top of that, this may be the cheapest (lowest cost) beer from Scotland, and eventually the barrels feed a single malt scotch so I have to say ""Cheers to that!"""
"d- not great, i wasn't a fan, it was a bit too oaky and sweet for me. i wouldn't grab this one again."
"Beer, should NOT TASTE LIKE THIS, at least imho."
"D= Sort of a strong-ish Scottish ale that gains a lot of flavor and complexity from the oak barrel. I'll admit that when my wife handed this to me in the LCBO I didn;t want to buy it because of the clear bottle. Now that I have had it I am kicking myself for not buying more! Very complex and very well made."
"Drinkability: This will satisfy fans of Scottish ale, and is fairly reasonably priced. I'd certainly buy it again (in fact I intend to). That said, it does lack the creamy head of a beer like Belhaven Scottish Ale (who I believe brew this under contract)."
"Pretty good taste and a nice feel, but a little too sweet to drink more than one or two."
"M: A rare sensation with a good ending but too bitter in the middle not an easy to drink beer but with a complex structure."
"D- Easy to down, well hidden 6.6% ABV. Definitely for somebody with a sweet tooth. I feel like if I drank this as a regular drink, I'd need dental insurance for the cavaties."
"For these reasons and more, I always try to introduce people to this magical beer if they have not yet had the pleasure. People constantly tell me that they don't like beer, or that they haven't found one that they can really enjoy all the time. Well, I have the antithesis for those people, and it's aged in oak barrels!"
"drinkability: Yes, yes. Actually I'd love to try and amped up version of this."
"A friend brought this over to my house yesterday to drink. We split it into two pint glasses. The body was brown but very translucent. There was a nice and creamy head that formed on top. Not a bad looking beer. Smell had prominent notes of oak and vanilla. The taste was probably one of the biggest mysteries I have had in a while. I don't know if I liked it or not. There were huge flavor of oak and toffee candy. So that aspect I liked. But, it almost tasted artificial to me; like an additive. And, it was borderline too pronounced. That was the aspect that I did not like. Mouthfeel was also on the thin side. Would not have guessed 6.6%. Drinkability was on one hand smooth but otherwise this beer was a bit too caramel-like, and it stuck on my palate. An interesting beer to try for a decent price. I can see how this beer is hit-or-miss with other reviewers."
"11.2 oz. for $4.49. Poured into Arrogant Bastard pint. This pours a clear bronze with a miniscule fizzy head (I'm not impressed). The aroma is of chardonnay, vanilla, oak, and prunes. The taste is chardonnay with honey and vanilla, ending with a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is rather light. It's a huge disappointment."
"Poured into a New Holand curved pint glass. Color is a golden amber with a brief head that fully dissipates fairly rapidly. Aroma is of wood and vanilla are the two apparent flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy and slightly crisp, but there is a dryness left on the center of my tongue. The hops have mellowed almost completely out of this beer, but the residual oak and malt flavors are very tasty. If I could get this locally it would be my new session beer."
"D: Very high, very balanced, very sessionable."
"D - A really nice unique beer... Packed with flavor and character for the surprisingly low 6.6% ABV... Smooth and sophisticated... I would gladly drink again and am eager to explore the variations of this brew... Slightly reserved all the way around... I little more intensity in all facets would return exponentially and make this a world class offering..."
"Drinkability is high. The brew goes down smooth and has an appealing flavor high in character."
"its a drinkable beer, overall this is a nicely aged beer."
"D: The beer goes down very smoothly due to the light body."
"D: Excellent, could use a bit more strength for my taste, but light enough so you could drink these all day if you could afford them."
"Perhaps if they gave up the clear bottle experiment and switched to darker glass then I'd be raving. Perhaps due to it's Scotch whisky origins maybe green glass? but overall on this bottle I give a major pass. I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to this beer."
"Notes-Get this beer for yourself on special occasions, the day you get a new job, on your graduation. This is a ""pat yourself on the back"" kind of beer."
"D - It's a very well balanced beer which makes it quite easy to drink. I thoroughly enjoyed this and drank it faster than I probably should have."
"Notes-Wow, I really like this a lot more than I thought I would, I just may get it again."
"I am glad I tried this one, but only because it seems peculiar, not because it was a good brew; it is just much different than what I expected. It is not a bad beer, but I would not consider it again."
"I was expecting something much more exciting than this. I even gave it heaps of time to open up and warm up but nothing special happened."
"D-Has an enduring warmth and character. One bottle may not be enough."
"From the back of the bottle: ""To make Innis & Gunn we hand-select barrels which are packed with the most delicious oak flavours. Over many weeks, our unique maturation slowly unlocks these flavours from deep inside the oak grain, the beer growing in character with every hour that passes. Only when it is matured to perfection do we bottle and release it. The result is a refreshing, honey-hued beer with aromas of vanilla and toffee, and a malty, lightly oaked finish."""
"At only about four dollars for a big bottle, I'm sure it will become one of my regular ""at home"" beers."
"Drinkability- I actually only wish this beer was a bit cheaper cuz I find this to be an amazing session beer though touch strong, its just so smooth and balanced, I really really enjoy the balance in this beer, the oak imparts a very nice smoothness and complexity, a beer I really do enjoy and would recommend as something worth trying for beer fans just out the unique flavor profile alone,"
"Maybe I got a weird bottle, so I'd try this again to see if it came together a bit better. On the other hand, If I tasted the intended flavor of the beer, I don't think I'll pick it up again."
"Ok, I finally got around to tasting this beer. I don't know if it was the clear bottle, or if this just isn't a very good beer, but I swear, it tasted just like malt liquor. I've had some pretty skunked bottles of Newcastle that had a similar flavor. So I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that I probably got a bad bottle--but, I can say for sure I won't ever buy it again, because if they don't respect their beer enough to put it in a brown bottle, I sure as hell ain't gonna pay $5 for another bottle of potential skunk-juice."
"The beer pours a dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is perfect. It has a kick ass oak character along with some pale and light crystal malts. It's creamy and buttery. I don't think I've ever experienced an aroma like this before; AWESOME! The taste is much the same. It's incredibly smooth with a basic pale and crystal malt base. The yeast creates a bit of fruity esters and the oak dominates and creates a wonderfully buttery mouthfeel. It's a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific beer. I've gotta get a case of this stuff soon."
"D: I couldn't see me drinking more than one of these in one sitting, but I think I'd get it again, as, like I said, it was growing on me."
"Drinkability: I see alot of people complaining about skunked beer and the clear bottles, obviously a clear bottle is the worst choice for this beer but the one I had from Smokin' With Chris had no signs at all of skunkiness or being dated. Overall a very interesting beer to say the least, the barrel aging really shows in the aromas and the taste. The kick of honey and light fruit really offset this beer from other EPA's. A great offering!"
"Not a bad beer, though also not fantastic. I wouldn't be opposed to picking up another bottle in the future."
"But I still love this beer, and recommend it to those who like the marriage of the malt and the oak."
"I hope something was wrong with this particular bottle. I can't imagine a beer like this being intended to be this unpleasant to the senses."
"I picked this up at the LCBO on a whim. It pours a clear gold with a thin head. Thanks to the clear bottle, sulfur dominates the aroma. Some sweet malt and oak come through behind the skunkiness. Sweet malt hits the flavor upfront, with tangy, smooth oak flavor. There is a mild bitterness, but the sweet caramel malt is balanced mostly by the oak tannin. The finish is astringent with some nice woody, bourbon flavor that really lingers. The aftertaste is a little rough, and it doesn't lead me to grab another sip, making the beer hard to drink."
"This beer amazed me, looking at it at my store very seldom did I see it sell, but only to the beer geeks and advocates. This encouraged me to give it a go, so I took home two bottles of it. Expecting nothing great, I poured it into a large English Pint, and immediately you see some carbonation, but very little. A nice head arises, with fantastic lacing, that stays even after the beverage is gone. The taste is of wood, obviously from the oak barrels, vanilla, and a nice malty backbone. Sweet, however not a sugar bomb, delicious, and overwhelming. A great beer."
"Drinkability: This sort of thing is - on some level - what I remember beer tasting like. Not, like, a few years ago, but like, when my dad gave it to me as a child. Maybe that's why my dad bought it for me for Christmas? Either way, I wasn't too much a fan of it, though I appreciate it for what it is."
"D - this is a nice mellow beer with a very neutral finish. It would make a good light desert beer (as opposed to porter/stout)."
"The only thins i tasted really good was the honey inside the beer. A very surprising combination."
"Bit of a head spin this one. Looks great, amber/copper with a neat head. The oak is evident on the nose but for some reason I'm getting definte aniseed. Like new oak? There are strong hints of whiskey as well, particularly in the finish. Honestly, there isn't a lot else happening and the oak is kinda distracting rather than enhancing. Still, it's a tidy little beer and well made for sure. A once a year kind of beer for me."
"D- This was the beer that opened my eyes to craft beer. It's not as good as I thought it was back in the day. Amazing how ones palate changes with the more beers and styles you try."
"Drinkability: Easy drinker although I don't dig the taste very much."
"D- A nice malty ale, which would pair well with a strong cheese for me."
"All in all, this one is more like a mainstream bud. This should not be anywhere near some of the craft brews in the fridge because it is not worthy. The brewery needs to rethink this beer."
"All in all, Innis & Gunn is an oustanding beer, giving you quite a unique drinking experience. Highly recommended!"
"Clear light copper pour with minimal head and lacing. Big oaky nose with hints of vanilla and tons of whiskey. Taste is much the same with the whiskey even more prevalent. It's amazing how the aging in bourbon barrels retains so much of the flavor and aroma. Not a whiskey drinker at all but pleasantly surprised by this beer. To sweet and rich for more than one, but enjoyable none the less."
"D: Very smooth and great tasting beer. Easy to drink and enjoy, but the price is a little steep."
"Light flavor and the boldness in the smell doesn't carry over. Vanilla, toffee, hints of wood, light nuttiness, sweet caramel malt. Light hop drying in the finish. Nothing too amazing going on here but not a bad brew. Carbonation is probably spot on."
"Copper color or caramel looking beer, pick the one that fits you more. The head looks nice, however it disappear quite rapidly. The aroma intensity is light. Malty caramel. This is strange on the taste, not used to that taste. Not bad, but the vanilla taste is not for everyone. Vanilla I prefer in darker beer :) Again the taste is light and absolutely not overwhelming. I get some honey too in the taste. Good beer overall, but not my day to day beer."
"330mL bottle."
"Innis & Gunn's beers are interesting and all, but I'm almost inclined to classify this as something other than a beer. They're not really my thing."
"Great beer overall!"
"I have had this a few times and would have it again. It is certainly interesting."
"The LCBO is a mean place for anything in a clear bottle. This is a damned fine beer if you can find it in good condition, but it's not too often you do. I really enjoy this beer in good condition, and a boxed gift set is great at keeping the light out. If only they would ditch the clear bottle; it would make purchasing this less of a crapshoot."
"Since then, I treat myself as often as possible to this sweet nectar. My only complaint is that it is not sold in 6 packs."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"This is a pretty solid brew and a real bargain for something put in oak barrels. If the flavor were a little stronger this would be a great brew, but as it is, it's still definitely worth a try."
"Similar to the other reviewers, the smell was uncannily like a watered down scotch. The bottle label says to serve well chilled but I actually like it when it warmed up a bit - the honey and oak were more prevalent. There was a nice frothy head which didn't stick around for long and there was some nice lacing. The color was a rusty honey hue. The mouthfeel and drinkability were both very good. My bro gave this to me as a birthday gift - I'll have to find out where he found it as I would like to try it again. Highly recommended for those that like scotch."
"Pours a nice honey color with a small head that dissipates relatively quickly. The aroma is the best part of the beer and is very oaky and smells like scotch. I definitely didn't notice any skunkiness that the other reviewers mentioned. The taste is best compared to watered down, lightly carbonated scotch. Drinkability is a bit low because, as it warms up, it becomes increasingly hard to swallow."
"Overall, this is my favorite version of the 3 Innis and Gunn's I've had. Rich creamy mouthfeel of the lightly oaked version paired with a wonderful complex smell and taste the Canada Day Anniversery seemed to lack. At approximately $3.50 a bottle, this is a beer for me to be enjoyed more modestly, but that won't stop me from buying another one down the road."
"Tom and Analise"
"Overall - I just don't know about this one. Really, as I think about it, it wasn't a bad beer, nor was it good. While I wasn't impressed with the taste this time around, I would definitely give it another try sometime."
"Very drinkable, unique in the style as it does the light toffee/vanilla thing well. I would love to have a word with the head brewer and tell him he's a dumb ass for ruining the nose of a beer this good by putting it in clear glass!!!!"
"Altogether a decent, but not mind-blowing brew. If you like oak aged beers, this one is a very good choice. However, its pricey, and in an invisible bottle."
"Drinkability is pretty decent, actually. Tone down the alcohol a touch, and attenuate some of the strength of the flavours and this would make for a decent session beer."
"Not only did I drain pour half of my glass, but did the same with the remainder of the bottle. This flavor is just not me in any way."
"This is one of my favourite beers (if not my most favourite). I love the look, smell, taste, the complexity, and the uniqueness of it. Out of all the different beers I've had, this is one of the very few I re-purchase when I go ""International Beer Shopping"" on the mainland."
"Off the bat, this beer was the first time I considered allowing price to affect my drinkability rating.. I have opted not to really take it into account, though. The pour barely needs to be rated since its a clear bottle and you can see it clear. There is a decent head but it fades. The smell and flavor are whats really important here.. very, very strong vanilla.. its like cream soda, really. caramel, cream soda, and a complexity from the oak are all present. The smell is sweeter than the flavor, though, which doesn't get to the point of, say, a similar beer at a higher ABV (for better or for worse). The mouthfeel and drink are both good, nothing crazy to write home about but its got a full-body and it isn't too heavy at all, drinking quite easily."
"D: I'm having problems with this one. I like whisky and i love beer, but mixed togheter like this - it's an opposite to synergism. Beer and whisky togheter should be the greatest thing ever, but I just can't rate the drinkability higher..."
"This beer is the best beer I have tried so far, and I've tried about 50 kinds. The cashier at the liqour store told me about this kind of beer and that it truly is a cut above most beers - but not because it simply tastes better. It is because it is a completely different class of beer. The whiskey's natural oils present in those oak casks definitely add flavor dimensions that have made me even reconsider the way I do beer tasting from now on. It has simply set the highest standards possible and although a very expensive beer, it is a fantastic example of a truly ""great"" one. The nose is strong and promises what it preaches: vanilla, caramel, whisky-tinged oak cask taste, with a hint of citrus in the undertones of the beer. Taste up-front is harsh and the drinkability is not the best ever, however it gets much more impressive the more you drink it (literally with each sip) and you become more accustomed to the wide palatte of flavors before you. This beer IS finally, truly one to write home about."
"Overall, not bad, it is slightly different from other beers and I always enjoy it."
"330ml bottle into a straight glass. I've had this before, and I still find the toffee sweetness and vanilla whisky overdone. It looks lovely, smells quite nice, but a bit sickly. It has a pleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste. I guess the Scots (and I'm 3/8 jock myself) like their beer sweet, as they are well known for their sweet tooth. I love sweets and cakes, but I'm not a fan of sweet beer."
"A very refreshing beer with great tatste and therefore drinkable"
"Drinkability - I really like this right from the bottle, which is very rare for me. This is pretty potent at 6.6% and it goes down easy. I keep the limit to 2 of these."
"I would recommend trying it."
"A few years ago, I presented this to my dad, a UK whisk(e)y fan who doesn't really do much in the way of beer anymore, and he was impressed with the flavour intensity, but didn't think it would be good for more than a small serving. I still agree with that, as this is a tasty enough, original (at one time) brewing concept, but the flavours from the wood would indeed become cloying after a short exposure. And I suppose it helps if you're an ardent fan of oak-aged spirits in the first place."
"D - Don't go fast."
"BTW The bottle says it should be served well chilled, not how I usually drink my ales and I neither did this time."
"11.2oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass pours a crisp bubbly pale orange with a thin off-white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is an intriguing blend of Earthy hops, sweet malts and oak. The taste is a more muted blend, enjoyable, but not what the aroma promised. The beer is fairly light for 6.6% with decent carbonation. This one is certainly worth trying, but I don't think I'll bother with again."
"Pours a dark orange with decent amount of creamy head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. Very distinguishable scent of the oak casks. Taste is smoky, with some vanilla and oak. The oak aging is very apparent. Smooth overall, with a bit of dry bitterness at the end. This was a surprise find at a local Beerfest several months ago, and I have enjoyed picking up a few bottles every so often."
"Interesting and enjoyable."
"Better than I expected, to be honest. Lots of pleasant whiskey characteristics. And I got it for $.99...I might go back and grab a case for that price."
"The pour was an amber-orange with about a finger of beige head and excellent clarity. The lacing was well dispersed around the glass. The aroma was like a fruity wine with decent malts and hop sensations. The mouthfeel was bold and had great consistency. The taste was like a fine wine with a pleasing chaser of sweet malts and subtle hops. A slightly dry ending and very easy to drink. No aftertaste. A totally satisfying experience and probably one of the best beers I have had in a long while."
"D - I was very surprised with how much I liked this one. It's a different experience than most beers, with the oak and whisky flavors. Let it warm up a bit and enjoy!"
"Golden honey body with a fizzy head that doesn't have much retention. Oak flavors are up front but mellow. Hints of bourbon and subtle crisp lime. Finishes sweet with a toffee maltiness with a bit of butterscotch and a very subtle raw honey. very smooth - coats the tongue in a pleasing way. The main drawback is the signature clear-bottle skunkiness, though it isn't bad in the taste, affecting mainly the aroma. A bit tannic about halfway through. Nice warming sensation from the almost-high ABV."
"a nice ale for certain, but pricey for sure."
"Methinks the clear glass bottle and long shelf times (not many buyers) are to blame for the high rate of skunking of this beer. I really, truly have had a good bottle, and I'm not sure if they turned out a bad lot that hasn't cleared out of local stores or if something more mundane or sinister is afoot. As it is, if you're a gambler or Casey at the Bat, or have six bucks to waste and feel lucky, give it a try."
"Poured into a pint glass, honey like color. Thin white head thta disappeared quickly, little lacing. Smelled nice, almost more like wine than beer, very sweet with hints of vanilla and molasses, slighly reminiscent of lemon and also hint of walnut. Taste is very vanilla, sweet and bitter at same tie like a white wine with a very nice finish like a well aged brandy. Very unique beer, probably too sweet for most but I will definitely have this again."
"A clear bright copper color with a fair off white fuzzy cap and good lacing. The aroma is maple walnut malt, even butterscotch, sweet and distinct. The taste reveals a more obvious oak bourbon flavoring with a nice lightly carbonated midland feel. A tad syrupy perhaps, quite sweet, but drinkable and tastey. It has a complexity with nut and oak, cherry highlights. Overall I would say it is a tasty treat but it could easily be too sweet for many folks."
"Overall: Unique flavor takes away from otherwise decent beer. However, absolutely worth a try - very good brew."
"The taste is not quite as pungent as the aroma, which is probably a good thing. For starters, the beer is definitely low carbonation, very smooth, slightly creamy. This is a light bodied beer as well. The oaky wood so strong in the nose is a few shades toned down in the flavor. More pronounced is a vanilla, almost cream soda syrup sweet malty taste. There is some smoked straw like scotch flavors in the beer and the antique butterscotch is also present throughout. The 6.6% ABV is completely hidden and unnoticeable and I would have expected a much lower ABV beer from the taste. The beer is a touch thin and there really is no residual aftertastes and the mouthfeel is quite slight from a light bodied beer. This is a unique beer worth seeking out for its change of pace character, but not as a steady diet. L'Chaim."
"Final Word - When I picked this up at the store, and saw it was on the shelf, unrefrigerated and unshaded, I really should have known better. I'm pretty sure that this beer wasn't stored properly, as my main problem with it is the skunking, which probably was caused by lack of refrigeration and light damage. However, I'm not 100% sure it was entirely the store's fault, as many people have commented on the skunk. Still, this beer fights through it and was enjoyable. The taste of this beer simply screams Scottish. I would love to try it again, but closer to the source next time."
"Picked up a bottle of this at Green's on Buford highway and cracked it open the same day. Pours a light brown with a big head that dissipates. Not a whole lot of lacing with this one. Smell is mixed with a metallic macro with hints of vanilla and caramel. Taste is predominantly malt characterized by toffee, vanilla, caramel, with the most predominant taste being the vanilla taste. Overall, the beer is very sweet, as expected. Light body in the mouth feel and moderate drinkability. Overalll, this beer is a little sweet for me and doesn't have enough body to support how sweet it is. Average brew. Not my favorite but not bad."
"Did not really like the first few sips of this one, perhaps it was served too cold. I find it is best served a few degrees above the recommended serve temp. At $3.20 for a 330ml bottle from my local LCBO I probably will buy another one, but thats it. With that said, I suggest this beer to anybody who loves white wine with a subtle oak flavour (you know who you are)."
"This beer is quite smooth and easy-drinking. It's something of a different experience; it takes on a lot of the oak barrel characteristics, but I can still tell there's a beer underneath all the vanilla and oak. Tasty stuff."
"Aroma is quite unique with distinct oaky malty Scotch whisky scents. Very nice! On the palate fizzy and smooth...the oak and malt are nicely balanced with lots of apple fruitness. The overall impression of Scotch whisky flavor is quite interesting and fun. In general, a light bodied beer with mild bitterness, fairly refreshing."
"MF&D - Meduim bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Went down well despite the 6.6% ABV. A quality beer that should be sampled by fans of English Ales."
"This is a fickle beer. I've had it before and didn't care for it, but at it's best it is very good, despite the smell."
"Mouthfeel - Smooth and watery to start with a creamy butter finishing residue. Good level of low-medium carbonation."
"This is definitely not your typical Pale Ale - very distinctive aroma of honey, but more honeycomb from a rustic farm in Vermont than honey out of a plastic bottle from the grocery store. Similary distinctive taste - another reviewer described it as ""peat"" - I'll go with that and add floral - again, more wild flowers from the highlands of Scotland than 1800 flowers. There is something about certain beers - English and Scottish beers in particular - where one can almost picture the landscape around where they were brewed, or at least where you would want a beer that tastes this way to be brewed! Definitely give this one a try, too unique not to."
"Drinkability may be limited due to the intense peatiness."
"Drinkability: I think one is my limit because of the sweetness, but it is a very good beer"
"Even so, I'd definitely drink this again as the smell and general taste are so nice."
"LOVE THIS BEER. Great brew smooth and delicious all around, not a high abv. Good and should try."
"This one does well after the initial weak start."
"I won't say that I like the beer, but I will say that it was different, flavorful, and interesting. A good quality beer, just not my favorite."
"This a nice beer that I would love to have again in the future."
"ps im Scottish and I turned out ok, so its no suprise this beer did too."
"Drinkability: I love having 1...Maybe 2 in a sitting but no more than that because by the end you feel like you've had a couple shots of Scotch. Not to mention it makes you smell like you were showered with fine single malt."
"Drinkability: Personally, I hated this beer. I thought the butter flavor in the taste was disgusting, and being combined with the syrup texture made it even worse. I would never buy or drink this beer again, but that's just me. You very well might like it even though I couldn't finish one."
"Overall: interesting beer, but too thin."
"As far as craft beers go i would give it a 6 out of 10."
"I can see this being too sweet for some people's taste, but I find this to be a really well crafted beer."
"A rather nice English Pale Ale to enjoy with a mild cigar. Innis & Gunn Oak Aged Beer is smooth and flavorful on the palate; and the hints of vanilla were pleasing to taste. Overall, this Scottish EPA is a pleasant alternative to the higher gravity ales that I usually enjoy."
"D - It smells great, but the flavor is a severe disappointment. The cloying sweetness is a real turnoff, it could be more drinkable if it was dryer."
"Re-review: This beer needs a hoppier finish. A great taste but the sweetness is over powering."
"Pours a highly filtered amber/golden with fluffy white head. Lacing is minimal. Nose- buttery, wood. Taste- sweet caramel malts, some vanilla oak notes. Body is medium thickness. Finish continues to be just as sweet as initial sip. No hops to speak of. too sweet."
"An interesting brew. Not an everyday choice for me, but well worth a try."
"D: Over time, the big smells and tastes relax quite a bit to makethis more drinakble than you'd think at first quaff."
"A prescedent and reigning champion within the oaked ropes. Aromas of bourbon and natural wood syrups. A well balanced symphony of butterscotch, toffee, vanilla, and needless to say, oak. Intensely flavorful and unique. The well defined maturation process vamps this ale way above other wood aged ales. Always a treat."
"Deep amber looks reminiscent of molasses. Syrup oozing down maple trees scent and my mouth is watering. MMMmmm...oak. Malty sweetness much like honey with some butterscotch and syrupy aftertaste. This beer has autumn bottled up inside of it, I can almost taste the yellowing leaves falling off the trees. A real treat to behold."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer - it leans towards sweet in the flavors, so a little unbalanced, but it's a really nice take on the English pale ale. And I always love something that's barrel-aged!"
"D: This is a great beer. I've only had a few ( Fullers London Pride and Speckled Hen) from this category but I can say without hesistation that this is one of the best Pale Ale's I've ever had the opportunity to put down my stomach. If I had not poured this beauty from a bottle myself, I would have thought it came from a cask."
"Intirgued by the end cap at the Shop Rite Liquors for some time, I figured this kind of brew was perfect for sampling after the 2008 Brew Fest. So in between card plays of Greg Hughes' wildly entertaining game Discombobulation, I jotted down some notes... golden, scotch-like copper pint... white, pencil-thin head that sits on a sparkling body... malt and honey abound with an aggressive weight... bouquet is wildly fragrant... smooth, slick and very drinkable (for a 6.6 ABV!)... uniquely pleasant... tastes begin simply with butter, caramel and toffee... however, those flavors also suggest vanilla and some other flavors I'm not good enough at this time of night to detect... overall, the discussion alone with Ryan, Jer, Cheri, Russ and Amy was worth the purchase-although $4 a bottle is a bit hefty on a weekly wallet--and the beer's finish warmed without rudeness or alcohol..."
"A nice beer with an unusual flavor that I appreciate. Pretty easy drink."
"The scent of wet wood was the first thing I noticed after pouring the bottle into a pint glass. A nice orange color with a thick head greated me from the pour. The head shrank to a layer of lace on the top. Some of the lace sticks to the side on the glass as I taste the beer. The wood's flavor is much more delicate. It does not overpower the beer. It is very smooth. After tasting the beer, I breathe deep into the glass. Now the smell of oak really reaches out. Reminds me of when I bought oak furniture and it arrived at my new place. It is a great scent. I almost can't believe that the liquid in my glass can smell that rich. The beer is slightly sweet with a honey like quality. The beer is two thirds finished and the head remains constant. I finish the beer regretting that I didn't get more bottles for my friends and family to try."
"D: Very smooth beer to drink. Not my all time favorite, but a nice choice if I want to go with something lighter. I'll definitely pick this up again, as well as trying out their new Rum Cask beer."
"The cloyingness of the palate knocks a few points off, but otherwise its a interesting drop."
"Although the Web site says this beer is aged in oak casks previously used to age bourbon, the bottle label says nothing about booze having been present in the barrels. Based on the taste, I'm inclined to believe the bottle-- I detected no trace of whiskey."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"D: I'm enjoying this bottle infinitely, and wish there were a few more in my fridge."
"D- I probably wouldn't make this my choice for an entire evening out but I would definately have this as an after dinner beer....great to relax with. I didn't even notice the 6.6% alcohol and would recommend this beer to someone who has some experience in trying bolder brews. I tried this when I first started venturing out of milder flavors and I admit, I didn't really like this, but now I think this is one of the best beers I've had to date. Will definately pick this one up again to enjoy!"
" I give this appearance a 5 because the color is nice but the packaging enhances it. Looks like a bottle of whiskey."
"The ABV will sneak right up on you but this beer, although very easy to drink isn't a beer I want to keep drinking."
"Great English beer that should not be missed by anyone who can get this fresh. This was the surprise of our BA gathering."
"D- Good flavor and nice aroma. With such little carbonation you could knock back more than a couple but at 6.6% alcohol you might want to go easy."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty/vanilla nose. Flavor is sweet vanilla and oak. Pricey but worth trying at $4.49 for a 330ml bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"This is one fine beer. Maybe one of the most flavorful and smooth beers I have ever tasted. Nice caramel color with white bubbles. Aroma is is like brown sugar- very sweet, with hints of oak and wood. Flavor profile at first was outstanding, sweet, chewy, malty and bready, with molasses and a rich woody aftertaste. The wood aging really seems to mellow this out. My only slightly negative feeling, was that it may have been too sweet- I would like to see a little more balance. But in the end, an experience."
"The flavor is powerful, so I'm not sure that I'd want more than one of these at a go. It's a beer to sip, not one to swig on a hot summer day."
"M/D: The beer was very smooth, creamy and strong. Light level of carbonation. Definitely has a lot of characteristics from the oak barrels and defiantly reminds me of a good scotch. Overall, a very good beer, one that I will have again, but I don't see myself drinking more than one at a time."
"A little on the expensive side, but all in all this is my favorite beer, out of all the beers I have tried. Highly recommended."
"Pours a nice darker amber color with a short medium bodied white head that fades fast to a slight film on top of the beer. It laces some down the glass but not alot. It has a very smokey aroma overall with hints of nice sweet roasted malts and a nice hoppy bitterness underneath the smokey flavor. It tastes of very nicely mixed roasted malts, and then a really smokey flavor from the oak aging. It reminds me of a good whiskey or scotch in the taste which makes this a very nice sipping beer. The mouthfeel is very warming and smooth. The very strong flavoring makes it a bit harder to drink, but it is nice once it's warmed a bit."
"What a fascinating oak aged beer. Hands down, the most unique I've ever tasted. It has this funk to it, like a really good cask cider or a natural lambic, but it completely and totally works. I like it."
"Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and it is very drinkable compared to what I expected. Because of the very oaky aftertaste, I don't see myself drinking too many in a row, but I would definitely recommend giving it a try."
"Enjoy!"
"This beer is still wonderful, but I remember it being much better when I first reviewed it. The last one I had was just too skunky, but still very tasty with the oak and whiskey and vanilla flavours. This is still one of my favourites, because it is so unique to me."
"Recommmended..."
"Shame it's sold in clear glass. I got lucky and it wasn't skunk."
"Overall - Interesting, balanced beer. The whisky flavour provides a strong taste to work against the malt (the way hops do). This gives it a harsh and very woody/earthy feel. Not my personal preference, but I can see why many find this beer irresistable."
"It's interesting and fairly layered, with more than enough character to keep you engaged throughout the glass. And the sweet and then dry and bitter symphony followed by a blast of bitterness and alcohol is certainly entertaining as well... however, I'm not sure it has a real 'overall' drinkability. One is very enjoyable, but that may be my limit for the night. Still, I found it very interesting, and worth seeking out for fans of Scottish ales and whisky."
"Overall a definitely recommended calming soft beer that's got a unique whisky-like aroma to it."
"Best part of this beer is the nose, it is surprisingly complex and enjoyable. Taste and mouthfeel are mediocre. Not an everyday beer but I recommend trying it if you can!"
"D: Definitely a good, drinkable beer. Can definitely pound these back. Crisp and refreshing."
"Drinkability - Quite a different for a pale ale, but I liked it. I would pick it up again."
"Drinkability: this beer is a definite slow sipper for a pale ale since the whiskey tones don't lend itself to be a session ale. Overall an OK beer but not overwhelming."
"Nice fizziness to this beer. Sweetness gives this beer a rich mouthfeel."
"In the end, it doesn't manage to hold up to be more than ""interesting"" to me. The whisky/vanilla dominates just a bit too much to appreciate anything else that could be going on here. Nothing ""off"" or ""bad", certainly. And it is drinkable. Worth checking out, but I don't see myself going back to it with any regularity."
"D - The strong flavours & fairly high ABV% would limit the drinkability of this. But a good one every now and then & I'd recommend trying at least once."
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: This really, really looks like cream soda. Maybe it's the clear glass bottle, but it pours the color of cream soda, maybe a shade more red, with very, very light, bright white head that goes away almost immediately. Hm. S: Really unique smell, much more full and spicy than it looks. There's a definite sweet coffee smell. Very oakey, as expected. T: Sweet up front, really strong coffee flavor, spices, whiskey, wood. Pretty great, actually. Slight hops on the finish. M: Thick, moderate carbonation. D: The appearance doesn't do this beer justice. Pretty delicious. The oak aging gives it a great character, but it's not overwhelming at all. Really solid beer."
"Outside of the appearance, this is a fantastic ale. It poured a crystal clear orange bronze colour with a pretty large white head. I wasn't a fan of the lack of cloudiness or haze. The clarity was a bit of a turn off for me. The smell, however, was stunning! I thought so, anyway. Very oaky, this smell like a damp piece of freshly split oaken fire-wood with a pinch of brown sugar. Woody notes really seem to come through this one on the finish, accompanied by what almost seems to me a very muted whiskey profile. Mouthfeel is very smooth and seems lightly, but pleasantly carbonated. This is simply wonderful!"
"This is a very good beer to sit back and enjoy,very flavorsome but not something you want to drink too much of,good to sip and enjoy the flavors,not to pound back, that's for sure.Will definately buy again just to have for those special occasions or those quiet evening's laying back and enjoying a good flavorsome beer.It's like having a beer and a shot of whiskey at the same time,and oh ya...it's got some punch to this one...6.6 abv...hehe,,,you can feel it."
"I'd have it again, but like scotch, this is a sipping drink, not one you'll hammer back."
"Amber colour, clear; topaz hue in a clear light. Good carbonation, lively and persistent. Generous head that lingered with good lacing and coated the sides of the glass. The smell is like pipe tobacco, a walk in the woods after a good rain, the oak pretty well predominates. Full bodied taste and texture, vanilla, hoppy backdrop. Nice bitterness with a scotch or brandy aftertaste, warm going down. There's a touch of sweet european style dark honey, the kind you might find in a market in Krakow. I found this really satisfying, a wonderfully constucted English Pale Ale with a richness and fullness to savour."
"12oz bottle from LCBO in Ontario. Pours a light straw with some decent lacing. Aroma is faint, but does have a hint of whiskey to it. The taste has more than a hint of the whiskey, although it is still a bit light overall. It does go down quite nicely."
"Drinkability is alright, it's a nice sipping beer, but butter aroma mars the experience. Haven't seen it mentioned in other reviews, so I'm going to try this one again in the future."
"D: Interesting. Not a session beer by any means but one I would eagerly enjoy later in the evening. I find it very drinkable since it has many of the attributes I like in my single malts with the oak, vanilla and smoke."
"I recommend that all beer lover's give this brew a try."
"I tried this after purchasing it at my local LCBO store. It was a nice clear bottle. The beer poured a coppery red colour into the glass with a 1 finger creamy white head that dissipated quickly to leave a little trace on top. The smell was rather foul to say the least....almost sour. The mouthfeel is crisp and slightly thick with an idea level of carbonation. The taste is good with some hints of malt and fruit (although I can't place the sweetness off-hand)."
"The taste was a similar delicate mix of several different flavours, starting herbal and subtly hoppy but yielding to a sweet toffee sensation, vanilla again and a dry finish. A bit rummy, too. Medium-bodied and low carbonation"
"Overall, I am very impressed. I'd be interested in tasting this before it's aged. It seems like it would not be anywhere near as interesting without the aging. I'd imagine it would still be a good beer, but this beer is all about the subtleties found in the aging process. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This is a very different beer and one that took a sip or two to figure out but I must say that if you like the taste of whisky, you are going to like the taste of this one"
"A clear bottle always makes me nervous, and this beer was somewhat skunky. So this review might be considered atypical, but not unfair -- if you use a clear bottle, you take your chances. It had a golden pale caramel color, with some malty aroma finding its way through the skunkiness. There wasn't a lot of flavor -- a little oak up front, but otherwise this struck me as a fairly standard Euro-lager. The finish was smooth and clean. Average at best."
"Color is a beautiful honey-amber, promising a good ale experience. Aroma has strong fruity overtones. Flavor has a brandy-like bite, but is otherwise fairly typical of a good ale, with smoky/burnt undertones and just a hint of apple or pear. Smooth yet edgy, this is a beer made for sipping rather than guzzling."
"Very nice if you like a sweet/malt type of beer. Barrel adds some nice, new dimensions, but doesn't dominate. Very interesting, and very odd for a pale ale."
"Overall I like it, I will drink it again. It goes well with a good traditional turkey dinner with stuffing, sweet potatoes and all."
"Overall a nice change of pace. I liked the oak flavoring."
"good drinkability. not hugely complex, but enough in there to keep you interested. nice to see some barrel aging on a ""regular"" beer."
"Thanks Cypress!"
"carbonation felt slightly harsh on my tongue, but overall it felt full-bodied and enjoyable. Not sure I can drink 4-5 in a session, but definitely a nice treat that I'll be having again"
"I really enjoyed this beer. I might choose other pale ales over it, but would happily drink it anytime."
"Not bad, but I could not drink many at once."
"Really tasty pale ale. I've seen it on tap (nitro not cask) and that was a big disappointment, will not be trying that again. A cask version of this would be great."
"The taste is very reminiscent of whisky, and (again) vanilla, butterscotch, warming alcohol notes (strong ale, after all), and (surprisingly) a hint of dill. The aftertaste is all vanilla and dill. I enjoyed this beer a whole lot and was sad to finish it as it was a gift originating from far, far away."
"d: very drinkable - really enjoyed this beer & look forward to the next one. the whiskey taste really makes this enjoyable."
""
"Good stuff. I like a ""regular strength"" beer with the barrel aging. Typically, you only see 8%+ big beers taking the barrel aged challenge. I'd like to see more of these. The carbonation is a little bit much, but otherwise it's a quality brew. I'd drink this again if the price wasn't so off-putting. I paid $6-something for one 12oz bottle. If the price was marked on the shelf, I probaby would have thought twice."
"For the swedes: think rotmos (mashed turnip) as you drink it. Meal in a drink."
"decent body, with a smooth mouthfeel that isnt too light or heavy. interesting final product makes me wonder what the non-oaked version in like."
"If you're hoping for flavors of a Rauchbier, you'll be disappointed. If you're expecting a boring, one-dimensional English Pale Ale, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"Drinkability: A singularly unique beer that's best enjoyed slowly."
"Drinkability is something else. This is a nice warmer for a nightcap, or to have while sitting in your big chair with a good book and your favourite background music. -Not a session beer. It's quite acceptable, but not my favourite. I would not turn down a free one."
"This is pretty good stuff, but they could be a tad more generous and give it to us in 500ml bottles, and preferably not clear ones."
"A very pleasant drink and worth the extra cash I paid for it!"
"Pours with filtered clarity and a dusting of a head. Typical dark amber English pale ale color. Big vanillin smells on the nose, along with some spicy butter. On the palate, big, plastic-like vanilla flavors pop up first. Mouthfilling carbonation unexpectedly (based on this beer's appearance) forms at the mid-palate. The finish is a bit buttery with hints of diacetyl. Overall, this beer isn't that appealing to me. The vanilla flavors are overpowering and don't taste ""real", that is, they're too bright and big, kind of like how ""blueberry"" artificial flavoring taste more blueberry than actual blueberries. Anyway, not my cup of tea."
"Initial taste is quite sweet but very smooth and complex. I did find however that there was a smokey finish that I didn't mind during the first two sips but was very turned off by the end of the beer. Some people like this I do not so I almost didn't finish it."
"Santé"
"Overall a very nice beer, especially if you like to sample different flavours, worth a try."
"M&D: creamy on the mouthfeel as the fizziness is really well-executed; medium-bodied, flavoursome, yet incredibly easy to drink for a 6.6% beer... Now that I read my previous note about this beer, I'm surprised that I had so little to say about it--maybe due to the mood, the condition and serving condition of the beer, or simply my lack of experience. But now I could say this really is some fine beer. It gets 4 on taste only because its ""off-springs"" perform even better. All in all, a well-crafted and subtle beer best enjoyed cool like a real ale, NOT chilled as the bottle wrongly suggests."
"No effervescence in the mouth, touch cloying."
"All in all, Innis & Gunn Oak Aged Beer is an excellent brew. It will never replace a warm dram of scotch on a cold day, but it's a remarkably interesting - and quite tasty - beer. I would like to see more barrel aged beers in the future, because this beer is a definite winner. 4's across the board for a great, great ale."
"drinkability is good. it's a really nice beer. the oak is nice, but strong enough that i don't feel like i'd have several. however, that could just be my personal preference."
"Thought I had reviewd this before, but I guess not."
"The aftertaste is a lingering and fragrant oak scent, not at all sour as initially expected. It is a bit annoying because the hop bitterness and the oak aroma gives a mix that is reminescent of tart whiskey. This beer is more refreshing and lighter than anticipated. Quite a uniqe beer."
"This beer is fairly good. I wish it had more scotch kick to it though."
"The brew poured with a rich, even amber colour and a good head that dissipated quickly. A deep sniff revealed a pleasant malty aroma with whiskey tones. On the first sip, the sweetish flavour of malt is very evident, but even more pronounced is a taste that I liken to that of single malt Scotch whisky from the lowlands. As a lover of good Scotch, I was particularly delighted at the results of aging in oak barrels. Bitterness was only present in trace amounts. One could argue it could use a little more of the latter for balance, but I personally would not complain. The finish was smooth and warm in the mouth. Overall, an unusual and enjoyable brew. I can attest that it goes well with dark chocolate."
"This is very pleasant and I would like to try it as a cask ale if it were available. It is nice to try a british beer that touches wood, there are far too few. In all fairness I think this bottle was past its prime."
"Pours a very appetizing amber with a soft, tan head. light carbonation.The nose is softly sweet with malt hints and some great oak notes. The taste is nicely malty with nice fruitiness down the middle. A wonderful alcohol & oak mix become prominent late. A great lingering woody quality that is counterbalanced nicely with light sweetness. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated. Semi smooth finish. A nice sipper. The lingering aftertaste sits nicely and allows you sit and enjoy while slowly downing this brew. A quite enjoyed it."
"330 ml clear bottle, at Cardinal, Stavanger. Beautiful golden brown colour. Large and creamy off-white head, long lasting, decent lacing. Unusual aroma and flavour, very woody, Scotch whisky elements, but also notes of toffee, vanilla, cinnamon - and even shrimp and the dark meat of crabs(!). Relatively sweet, but the finish and aftertaste are woody, dry and hoppy. Something out of the ordinary, and I have trouble deciding how well I really like this beer. Definitely worth a try!"
"This is a really tasty easy drinking brew. We need more beer in oak. I love it."
"Anyway, once I took a sip, I was pleasantly surprised. Any skunk that I'd detected earlier disappeared, and instead I was treated to very sweet malty flavours, almost cakey, with some sugarcane, roots, and other plants in there. A great, thick mouthfeel makes this beer very satisfying and drinkable. Looking forward to the second bottle!"
"Very light caramel colour. No head, though their are a bit of bubbles. Smells lightly of toffee, caramel, dark soil... Something else as well. A type of candy. I know what the candy is, I just can't think of the damn name. It was a candy my great grandfather had. Unfortunately, the only candy I can think of is humbugs, and I know damn well that is wrong. Taste is quite simple. Caramel, toffee, eathiness/grass, along with that candy that I can't remember the name of. Medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Would make a decent session ale, despite the ABV content."
"Other comments: Though I'd be hard-pressed at the moment to say exactly why, I definitely like the 2005 Limited Edition more than this standard one. Whether it's because the LE came in a box and was not skunked or if it's because it's a different beer, I don't know. Wasn't impressed with this one, though."
"Drinkability: I dunno. It's tasty, no question, but I may have trouble putting away too many of these (could be deja vu thing from my college days and harder liquors...)."
"Overall pretty drinkable, Interesting to say the least. Definitely worth a try."
"A 'honey-hued beer', reminds me of the color of scotch typically aged in in their 'hand selected oak barrels'. It pours clear, leaving a thin cap of foam and minor lacing. There is definatley some oak barrel smell, malt, woody, a bit smokey. There was the slightest whiff of skunk when it was first cracked, but that smell didn't last. Lots of flavors, very complex, hard to pick out one overly strong trait. More of the smells are present in the taste including woodiness, nuts, smoke, and some whiskey flavors that linger. Lots of carbonation, felt light on the tongue. And the higher alcohol warms all the way down. I would keep this around as a sipping beer, to enjoy the complexity slowly. A uniquely brewed product."
"Clear bottle, why? Without fresness indication. Pours clear light almond, light tan head, leaving thick creamy lacing, with just a few bubbles rising to the top. Faint nose of peaty malt. Slightly smokey ale, soft notes of vanilla and some soggy orange citrus notes. Decent ale with some asperations of complexity, over 6% well in the background. Worth a try."
"Smell is initially skunky. Is that the distance travelled + clear glass bottle? Nice dark spicy hoppiness in the nose, smells like a much darker beer. I am quite impressed with the taste of this beer. Hoppy sweetness, a dark stout maltiness. The oak aging in scotch barrels really comes through strongly at times. I love scotch, and this beer marries two of my liquor loves together quite nicely. A bit thinner in the mouth than I prefer, but the 6.6ABV is hidden very well. Very drinkable, someday in Edinburgh I'll be sure to drink this along with all the fine whisky offerings of Scotland. Too bad about the price here in Manitoba though."
"Bright copper in colour with a medium amount of carbonation. Interesting aromas of vanilla, fruity British yeast, light malt, and marshmallow. The flavors are very sweet on the front end with elements of caramel, light fruit, licorice, and vanilla cream. The more tannic oak wood flavors show up big time on the finish. Heavy mouthfeel to this one as well. I was expecting not to like this beer, and in spite its heavy handed over the top nature , I actually enjoyed it."
"Bottle: Poured a light copper color ale with a medium head with average retention. Aroma of malt is pretty discreet with some noticeable English hops. Taste has some recognisable floral malt with a slightly bitter finish. Im not too sure about the oak aged aspect since I thought it was hard to distinguish and almost seems like a marketing gimmick"
"Drinkability- I'll pass on this one again unless I find it straight from the cask...then I would give it another shot."
"Cool; this beer smells like an old whiskey barrel. The colour is much like Lagavulin. The taste is malt tempered with the taste of the barrel. Totally original in flavour and more importantly tastes great. I will buy a half dozen for the cellar to see where this beer will go in a year."
"It's worth a try, but certainly NOT a solid choice."
"Clear amber topped by a dense, cream coloured head. Good head retention and a bit of lacing. Whiskey aroma with some woodiness and a bit of vanilla. The hops seem a bit strange though. Vanilla and oak flavour throughout, a bit of toasty malt, and grassy hops hang on for a while. Whiskey lingers a bit at the finish along with a butterscotch sweetness. Alcohol is hidden well, but a warming sensation and spiciness builds as you make your way through the bottle. Smooth texture, maybe a bit of diacetyl, with moderately low carbonation. Quite interesting, the oak aging definitely makes for a unique character."
"Wow, this is truly an amazing beer. I recommend looking past the price ($3.15 for a 330mL bottle here), and experience the greatness yourself."
"Pours a clear orange/copper, big white head, not much lacing. Smell is citrus, strange oakiness, some vanilla bean, skunkiness. Taste is citrus, oaky vanilla, coffee, sweet caramel finish. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, low carbonation and smooth. There was something about this beer I didn't like at all. Apparently others like it but this is the first beer I've ever dumped down the drain."
"This is an interesting beer. Its very malty but I was expecting more nuance from a wood aged beer. Still nice tasting."
"The pour put a honey colored ale in my glass with a puffy 3 finger cap. Soft carbonation. Aroma of sweet bready malts, caramel vanilla toffee with wisps of smokey whisky smells...sorry I didnt get the ""vanilla-orange"" smells the brewer promised. Very full tasting ale...a wonderful whack of sweet toffee caramel malts hit you right off as soon as this abundant malt blend settles on your tongue you get hit with a rush of fruit like a mild cider with a wonderful woody-smokey-whisky like decernment..hops are trimmed way back exposing the luxurious malt character...finish is anticlimactic: wet, sweet, slightly smokey clean and smooth with a bready after taste. Hides the alcohol very well with the huge malt body...it only becomes detectable in the slow ""warming"" as you drink through a couple of these. A very nice twist on a scottish wee heavy...Ill be looking to store a few of these away."
"Update: I've had a few more of these an have come to develop more of a taste for the brew as I've wrapped my head around it. It now ranks as an occasional fave and I'm also enjoying the variations of this beer that are available."
"This is not a complex beer like oaked arrogant B, its wood and some whiskey. But its a worthwhile changeup. It looks and smells whisky. Significant sediment at end, yet freshly imported, wich was not a put off. A bit of sourness in mid-sip, soapiness in finish."
"Drinkability: Hey, nice beer. Way to go, Andrea. Kicks Speckled Hen's ass all over the island."
"What else can I say besides ""Wow."" I picked this up on a whim this afternoon. I didn't even read the neck label stating IBC 2004 Supreme Champion until I went to pop the cap. Talk about a good pick up. This really is a unique beer. Atleast I certainly have never had anything like this. There's just something facinating in the taste. Seems like each time I take a sip the principle flavours may be the same, but the supporting cast appear on stage at differing times. Towards the end of the glass I definitely feel a little warmer. Not the best for a hot summer night, but this is a treat at any time. As the days get colder, I plan on stocking up on some of this."
"Nice lacing on the glass, just sufficient head remaining throughout. Taste improved a little after halfway, maybe because of warming slightly. Drinkability: sorry to say but I would not fancy another. This beer is well presented, but it is not a beer for me."
"Pours out a clear caramel hued amber, not much head on the pour, but a thin layer of retention that struggles to cling on. The aroma on this ale is a knock-out, truly impressive. Whiskey is what immediately greets the nose, sour mash bourbon no doubt, accompanied by a rich toffee, wood and peat characteristics, finished with some citrus. Wow. The flavour is just as good. Earthy wood notes with some sour whiskey, dates and currents blending in the middle with some vanilla bean, with a mild dried fruit finish accompanied by lemon, and a lip-smacking vanilla aftertaste. Wow. The mouthfeel is light, smooth and velvety, I had expected a denser texture for the flavour, but this makes for an easier quaffer, in fact deceptively easy to drink for the abv%. Easily a fine session ale, I am incredibly pleased to have stumbled across some of this, and will be stocking up on a lot more in the near future. Will recommend it highly to my friends, and anyone else who'll listen as well. My lips are coated with vanilla bean oil at the moment as I find myself at the bottom of the glass, I am very content."
"Certainly worth checking out for any beer lover though, there certainly are people out there that like this, and will like this."
"(Thanks to Dave at Willow Park for getting me this before it was even on their shelf.)"
"From a foot away I can smell the caramel. Sweet luscious malts are hidden under that pillowy white head... Smooth and soft, with the subtlest of oak nuances, it delivers an easy-drinking ale. Hardly the barest hint of hops at all. I could drink this all night long, if only I had more. It is a beautiful beer."
"This was just one bottle we brought back from the UK and I wish we had known how nice it was going to be...looks like I have to go back!!"
"Presented in a clear (why?) bottle and no visible freshness date. It pours a light copper with a nice white head that leaves some foam on the glass. Some malt and whiskey notes make through the rather overwhelming smell of run-over-three-days-ago skunk. I've had better bottles of this, but this one is really bad. Why should they put it in clear bottles and let this happen to an otherwise lovely beer? Not impressed. Sweet honey and malt in the taste with some oaky and whiskey hints. Mercifully not much of the skunkiness. A rather tasty beer, and certainly very good when you have a good bottle of the stuff. Nice mouthfeel and drinkable, but why the clear bottles. I shouldn't rant. It is a good beer, just plug your nose."
"An unusual beer but very nice I would recommend it."
"This is a very nice and a bit different ale of an excellent quality!"
" I wasnt overly impressed with the first bottle but this is actually quite a good beer. The flavor takes a bit of getting used to,similar to a ""rauch"" style beer. Very enjoyable."
"Fresh bottle drunk on a rainy morning in Belfast, for breakfast (thanks Bob). This pours a pretty clear, dark amber colour with a creamy head of off-white. The aromas are of WHISKEY! Whiskey malts, slight subtle hops, caramel, and more. The taste is very creamy and smooth with some sweet caramel notes that ride along the waves of complex, smokey, whiskey flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a real ""cask-like"" feel to it. Drinkability is very good, even for a breakfast beer. Shit, this stuff is damn good, thanks again to Belfasts finest BA (only BA!? ;-)"
"A nice strong ale, great whiskey oak barrelled ale, great stuff, like drinking whiskey flavoured beer, some beers i've tried the same and have a bad result, this however is amazing and full whiskey flavour, a really unique and special beer"
"I am not a whiskey fan, but this is a very good beer for something different. A quality beverage."
"Considering I was expecting a simple beer to merely satisfy the palate on a warm evening, this came as a fantastic surprise."
"This is a beer I would buy quite often if it were sold in Japan."
