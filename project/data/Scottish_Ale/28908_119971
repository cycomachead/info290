4.18,15.5,3.75,3.75,4.5,4.5,4,"Deep brown in color. Turns to an orange hue when held to light;  1 finger cream head that left some lacing behind, but not too much. Smelled woody and earthy, along with some caramel malt; tasted like bbq'd wood, toasted bread, smoked malt, smoked cedar, with a slightly sweet and dry and caramelized smoky wood aftertaste. I also picked up a little earthy spice as well. On the light bodied side for a 5.6% abv. Overall, a good beer!","Jsteez","Feb 04, 2015"

Big malt flavors sweetened by caramel finishing with spicy malt flavors, a touch of butterscotch, light toast and a balancing hop bitterness.","pat61","Nov 21, 2014"

3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"beautiful new packaging on the squatters stuff, totally expert rebranding. i like this beer less than the bumper crop with similar label, but i like it well enough. good as a scottish, but minimally smokey and not as rich in feel and flavor as some of the better examples of the style. lots of malt on this one, obviously, rich molasses color, nice and heady, tan and lasting pretty well. it smells like candied dark fruit and raisins, as well as a hint of maple to the grain. no hops at all, but they dont really belong in the style anyhow. i wish for more body personally, its a little too light (and super low abv) for the style, but i like the flavors a ton, and the carbonation is right where it needs to be. not as complex as others either, maybe a good scottish style for someone who doesnt really know what to expect from the style. easy drinking beer like this is great though, making huge styles into session beers is rad. not amazing by any stretch, but i would absolutely buy this from time to time.","StonedTrippin","Beers"
