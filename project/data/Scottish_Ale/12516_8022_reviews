"Pours clear and orange brown with a crimson blush. Has good clarity adn you can see a stream of bubbles coming up from the center to meet a loose head of tan foam that falls fast and does not leave lace.  There is a nice honey hue around the edges. Nose is malty. Bread, rich malt and a some earthy peat. A good fruitiness that is deep in the beer so you can't really name it and maybe a faint bit of grass. Taste is outstanding. Before your realize ti you have swallowed and what resides on the  palate in the quick remembrance of an exceptionally  smooth malty experience. There are several factes to this malt. The breaddiness which is dry and crisp and not too deep. There is dry cracker that keeps it light. And the earthy  peat that could favor a variety of different malty expressions but finds caramel in this one. It's a bit sultry it's a bit dapper.  The fruitiness is the middle and this finishes with a subtle rise in hops to a light grass and a faint bitter underneath the beer to push ti along the palate and finish it with a lovely lingering malty sweetness. Tall in the glass and not too sweet I loved this and thought it was excellent."

"This is a really attractive beer, but when I drink it, it’s pretty much a non-entity, i.e. very sessionable. Low alcohol, not much flavor, definitely chuggable. A weak version of a Scottish export ale. I last had this in 2010 and have to downgrade it from “good” to “OK”."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, plum, brown sugar, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, plum, brown sugar, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, fig, plum, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Scottish ale. All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Served at about 45F, it improved with warming."
"Dark brown pour with a deep dark ruby cast. Fair head with little lacing. Light nose of sweet and toast malt. The body is light medium and the mouthfeel is smooth. Well carbonated. The flavor is rather subdued - not bad, just not much there. It has an underlying tartness against a weak malt background. The finish is crisp. Since TD doesn't bottle date, this one may be old. I was expecting more than what was delivered."

"Pours a clear brownish-copper with some brighter orange edges. There is about a finger of off-white head that dissipates pretty quickly. Nose is pleasantly malty. The taste is also malty, but the body is a touch light for the style. This is a very drinkable offering that is enjoyable, but not quite true to style."

"Overall/Comments: A very good Scottish Ale that is extremely tasty and smooth. Highly recommend trying this! Classified as a Scottish Ale @ 5.2% ABV. Consumed 4-13-13"

"All I can say is ``yuck.'' I could swear I've had this beer before and thought it was a nice Scottish-style Ale. This particular bottle that I brought home was a disaster. Horribly citrusy with absolutely no trace of malty sweetness. Given the excessive carbonation, I wonder if this particular bottle was the victim of some wild fermentation. Since I have no desire to buy this again, I suppose I'll never know."
"Overall: A very good ale, thoroughly enjoyable. Could even be chugged without losing its appeal. Definitely could enjoy this one again many times over."

"To the Point: nice flavors, nothing super special here, easy to drink, for me personally on the sweet side so one and done."

"The appearance is a bit week, but that's to be expected for the style so its excusable. I was expecting something more American in interpretation (malt and hop bomb) yet found this subtle, delicate Scottish style Amber. Fantastic beer."
"Notes: This is dam tasty the breadiness is nothing short of remarkable. Cheers."
"Overall: Rather disappointing, particularly in the carbonation; not sure that the tartness was intended, either"
"I'm thinking that this might be an off batch or an old bottle. I would love to try this on tap or really fresh and see what it's like because other experienced tasters are giving it good reviews and all the other beers I've had from these guys have been spot on."
"Overall, a drinkable beer, very malt-centric, as expected, but a bit sweet and lacking in exceptional flavor than better examples of the style."

"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet to small alcohol presence with a peat like malt. In the taste, a small caramel and peat like malt, and a bit watery. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a note of dryness to clean like aftertaste. Big nose, decent flavor, but keeps going down from there."

"in Ohio for a hockey tourny and had a chance to try some Thirsty Dog beers. The Twisted Kilt pours a hazey orange color with good white head that laced. The smell was powered by peaty malt and earth. Taste is a bit sweet, with a hefty pulse of peaty malts. A bitter finish helps to clear the pallet. The mouthfeel is medium to light in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good scotch ale to session."
"O - An enjoyable, easy drinking ale with some nice earthy flavors that don't overpower the palate."

"O: Goes down ok, eh tasting, not too filling, low kick, average taste for style. This is an ok beer that would be a good alternative at a BMC bar, but I wouldn't seek this out."
"O-Yet another good brew from Thirsty Dog. I can see myself picking up this again."
"Dark amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is caramle malts.Taste is caramel,citrus and toasted malts.A pretty decent beer that goes down relatively smooth.I would recommend to try this at least once and I probably would buy this again."
"The aroma was totally malt driven as you would expect, with lots of nice caramel and earthy tones. Nice hints of grain and a touch of almost a raisin or fig like flavor as well. Very nice, but a touch on the light side would be my only complaint with it. The flavor largely followed suit, not being as sweet as I thought it would be, there were several touches of fruit, and a ton of grain in the flavor. The caramel malt driven back coming through very nicely as well. Your classic scotch ale flavor here, with not a whisper of alcohol anywhere to be found."
"Bottle. The appearance is deep amber and mildly cloudy. It has a nice sudsy, off-white head. The aroma is caramel malt, a nutty tone, some earth and a little wood. It's kinda weak but decent. The taste is mildly sweet and toasty. There's a lemon twang in the finish. Mouthfeel is normal - smooth, sudsy. It's a fine, calm beer. Easy to drink and inoffensive."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight roasted malt, and a hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pale malt, slight earthy malt, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, easy-drinking, well blended, but sub-par appearance and body."
"Overall next to their pumpkin ale this is my best beer I ever had and maybe even the best scotch ale since it's not a ABV bomb. Well done guys!"
"this is a nice malty sessionable beer."
"D: Drinks quite nicely, I like it a lot."
"Decent beer. Has an interesting flavor, different from other beers of similar appearance. Certainly richer and creamier than I expected. Very little hop bite which seems to allow malty flavors to come through. Sort of tastes like I'm eating a biscuit. I like it!"
"D - A different Scottish brew,leaves a little pucker factor, refreshing quaff."
"O- Very drinkable and flavorful. There is a little nice roastiness to this beer that plays well with the sweetness. This is a great sessionable beer at 5.2%."
"I'm on the fence about this being spoiled or not. They don't have any best by dating so the I'm thinking the likelihood is that it's just a bit too old. But guess what. My review will stand, simply because they don't bottle date."
"This was a decent beer, there was good flavor and pretty easy to drink. Although nothing really made me want to look for this again."
"This fine tasting Scottish Ale.Reminds me of something I've had before.Appears to be orange-brown ale.THis fine ale has a sweet aroma.THe taste is bit of caramel,nutty,bread tasting,kinda like a dubbel.Has great potential to be all night party favourite.Not to mention how funny the label is.P.S. Don't drink this after you brush yor teeth."
"This brew was a pretty good Scotch Ale. Not my favorite but still quite tasty. I loved the rich color it had. The flavor was nice too, Originally I thought it was a little weak but as it warmed it kinda got better. The mouthfeel isn't overly heavy but it has substance which is nice."
"Pours a reddish brown that has very little retention, no lacing and high carbonation. The smell is sweet burnt sugar, hint of hops, some caramel and coffee. The taste starts out with a sweet brown bread, than some caramel and maple come into it, and finishes off with coffee and a hint of hops. Thirst Dog does a great job of blending the tastes making it a nicely balanced ale. The mouthfeel starts off slightly creamy, but finishes off dry. A nice beer to drink when in the mood for a Scottish Ale."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and acidic. It's not the best, but it isn't the worst either, and it certainly remains drinkable. The dry finish helps in that department a great deal as well, along with the low abv and the lack of any overpowering flavors. Definitely a solid session beer that I'd have again in the right situation."
"Pours a rich and deep but translucent reddish chestnut brown color, but only a thin film of fizzy head appears before quickly vanishing into a faint ring. The aroma is pleasantly potent, with a rich malty character filled with dark caramel, cherries, and plums. The flavor isn't quite as bold as the aroma, with the primary characteristic being a sweet graininess that is reminiscent of maple and brown sugar oatmeal, but there are also the light fruitiness from the aroma, as well as a rich caramel finish. The texture is a disappointment, with a thin, light fizzyness that doesn't match the rich malty flavors. Overall, this beer was complex and enjoyable, but the weak body really deflated the flavors, leaving me wanting for something more substantial."
"You know, man, this is not a bad beer. It's drinkable and to style."
"Overall, I thought it was alright. I might get it again, but there are other Scotch Ales I much prefer"
"This beer is clear and tawny, with a head that rises high and leaves a lot on the glass. Coffee, brown bread, a little yeast and a bit of dried plum in the aroma. Crispness dances around within its creamy mouthfeel. This brew packs lots of malt and a hint of spice. It starts off bready, then a little caramel and even some burnt sugar comes in. Modest hopping lets the malt really take hold of the palate. The yeast and fruit shine in the middle. This beer has loads of flavor and is so drinkable. A dreamy ale."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a tea colored concoction that poured a tan head that went away very fast. The beer had a slight sour smell to it but did not taste so. In fact it had a bit of a caramel note. Good lacing was present but the beer was a little flat tasting, still I will try it again."
"M/D: Light body and medium carbonation, certainly an easy drinker."
"Drinkable....Yes,in an out of the usual way. I like this and I can't quite say why except it's different."
"Completely drinkable and almost sessionable."
"Somewhat citrusy to the nose. Crisp flavor, pretty main stream."
"ii"
"D- Overall, a slightly above average beer, although it is not all that memorable."
"not sweet in the way i expect of a scottish ale, even if some caramelization is in the house. dry and bready. this honestly tastes more like a brown ale."
"Thirsty Dog Brewing Company doesn't get enough credit in a state that also includes Great Lakes and Hoppin' Frog. Twisted Kilt Scotch Ale has been available on-tap for years. Luckily for those of us who live out of state, it's now available in bottles."
"A story of toasted malt, a significant caramel. A decent serviceable Scottish. A moderate smokey aroma, a little peaty taste. Dark yellow colour, modest off-white head. Creamy mouthfeel. Satisfying, spot-on style, though not terrific.On the sweeter sugar syrupy side."
"Reminded me quite a bit of Yuengling lager."
"Drinkability: Not an especially tasty Scottish Ale overall, but not bad tasting, either; not too heavy and a pretty moderate ABV that's not going to overwhelm anyone; not really something I would seek out when I'm in the mood for this particular style."
"12oz bottle into my ommegang glass. Apears a light amber color. Head is bubly and disapates within a couple minutes. Not much to smell here, a slight woody smell with roasted malt. Taste and mouthfael both feal water downed to me with to much carbonation. Bells ca blows this out of the water. I could drink a decent amout of these because of the abv but wouldnt want to."
"Pretty easy to drink for the style."
"D: A drinkable American version of Scotch ale."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip pours a nice crisp brown with a frothy lasting eggshell head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is smooth burnt caramel and brown malts. The taste is loads of sweet caramel malts with a hint of sweet and dried fruits. The beer is light bodied, but a bit overly sweet. This is an interesting Scotch ale, but not likely one I'd pick up again."
"Overall, an interesting,favorful beer."
"Appears a clear deep ruddy amber hue with a bright lighter khaki hue with even finely spread lacing around the chalice. Aroma strong smoked peated malts an amazingly light smoked meats tone going on. Flavor is great a rush of smokey sweet malt light brisk malt character this is really well made Scottish ale, there's body moderate carbonation wonderful mix of flavors in this beer. Sturdy herbal backing earthy hops this stuff is great really drinkable I'm glad I gambled on a bottle. Definitely one I will look out for I wanna try more Thirsty Dog brews, these are solid standup players in the Ohio microbrew scene. I heard there brewer used to work at Great Lakes and he helped formulate some of the famous Great Lakes brews so my next stop will be their Dortmunder Lager aka Labrador Lager."
"D- highly drinkable scotch ale especially thanks to the low abv. On the level with everlasting good example I've had."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer with a lot of substance that is worth drinking for a long time."
"D- Easy to drink and very impressed."
"Notes: Count me as very impressed with this beer, a good and very drinkable example of the style. I will have to try more from this brewery!"
"Copper colored brew with a small ivory head. Good retention and lacing from the residual layer. Sweet malt level with noticeable alcohol component. The nose portrays lots of malt and little bit of a spice overlay. The feel is full and creamy with lots of smoothness. Good drinkability for an obviously high ABV beer."
"Pours a deep amber color with a thin off-white head and some lacing. Aroma of malt, alcohol and cinnamon. Warm and rich malt flavor with a somewhat syrupy finish. Another foray into higher-ABV beers for Thirsty Dog, this is good stuff. It's nice to see a new Scotch Ale on the market!"
