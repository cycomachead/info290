3.73,-10.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D - Considering the intense bourbon flavor it was surprisingly easy to put down the 12oz glass. That being said, I wasn't overly interested in having another glass. One of 3 Floyds' less compelling barrel-aged experiments.","MasterSki","0"

4.2,0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This was the second beer I had on my first visit to FFF. It was served in a snifter which is perfect for a brew this aromatic. Visually the beer is very dark and a touch cloudy. The flavor profile is very complex and quite simply amazing. The bourbon flavor is first followed by vanilla-malt and finishes with subtle raspberry. You can taste the alcohol but is in no way overpowering. This is one that should be bottled, but since it is not, I can't wait to get Munster to have this one again.","HoppinDad","Jun 19, 2012"

4.32,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"O- good ba brown ale. Lighter for a barrel aged beers but the raspberry is a nice twist.","kawilliams81","Dec 12, 2011"
4.29,2.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The color of this reminds me of muddy water but the brown is just a little lighter. Where the appearance was lacking the smell was very good, bourbon with a hint of raspberry and some caramel malt. The bourbon is up front on the taste, a nice subtle oakiness and a pick up a little vanilla the raspberry goes very well with the oakiness from the barrel aging there is also a nice sweetness from the malt. The mouth feel is good but it could have used a little bit more carbonation but the malt really comes through to help the mouthfeel. Overall a really good beer, I am normally not a fan of beers with fruit in it because the fruit is the predominate flavor but with this beer the bourbon is up front and the raspberry come in very subtlety.","phisigben","Dec 04, 2011"

2.4,-42.4,3,3,2,3,2,"Some more vanilla, light red fruit. Initially, it is medium bodied, offering some sweet sticky caramel, toffee, and cocoa. Raspberry flavor is very intense. Finish is raspberries hanging on with oak, vanilla, and caramel. I enjoyed this, fairly complex, a bit thinned out overall, but tasty. Overall, I didn't enjoy this at all. I'll have to rate this one pretty low as I didn't consider it very drinkable. Was only able to take about 2 or 3 sips of it to do the tasting and then just threw it out. I see other people seem to have liked it but it just wasn't my thing I guess. Not a fan of the intense raspberry profile.","EseLocoSS","Nov 13, 2011"
4,-4.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Tastes more traditionally fruity, but again it's just fruit and wood. RtB is too passive of a pallet; it doesn't do anything to assert its beeriness against the stronger flavors. Still, the stronger flavors are each pleasant and they balance one another pretty well.","mynie","Sep 15, 2011"
3.17,-24,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"O- I was pretty disappointed with this beer. The medicinal qualities and the sweetness really hurt the drinkability and this is just a beer that didn't seem to handle the barrel aging process too well. Worth a try, but not something I really would get again.","iadler","Beers"
3.94,-5.5,3,4,4,4,4,"O - I dig the base beer and I dig raspberries, so this one was enjoyable. The booze doesn't overpower the rest of the beer like I find with many of their other offerings. I would have again, no doubt. Give this one a try.","Sean9689","0"
2.84,-31.9,2,3,3,3,2.5,"O: I wasn't convinced going in that Robert the Bruce would work as a base for a barrel-aged beer, but the raspberries drew me in. I found BA Bobby with Razz to be too much of a one-note beer, and the note wasn't particularly well executed. Mediocre. ","Wadsey","Sep 06, 2011"

4.12,-1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall -- By a wide margin, this is the best low-ABV barrel-aged treatment from FFF. The bourbon booziness is well in proportion to the relatively lower ABV of RtB, and the raspberries work incredibly well - good call, whoever had the idea. The base beer doesn't ring out as well as I woud ideally like, but I'd still put this above regular RtB, and I would consider that an accomplishment.","yeahnatenelson","Feb 17, 2007"
4.42,6,4,4.5,5,4,3.5,"First experience with a Scottish Ale. When poured there was maybe a fingers worth of head, the body giving off a dark caramel color. Quite pretty to look at. The smell hinted at delicious malts, caramel, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is very mellow malt, with an ever so slight bitterness. Almost bourbon taste at the back of the tongue. Alcohol is hidden very well, I had no idea its ABV was so high until I jumped on here. Delicious all around. Due to high ABV, drinkability is reduced.","youngblood","Beers"
4.42,6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability - Excellent - not too sweet, too bitter, or too bourbony. The raspberry touch at the end makes you want to take another sip.","westweasel","0"
