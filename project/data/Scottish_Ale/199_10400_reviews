"O: Pretty drinkable, but nothing super special."
"Overall, a rather disappointing beer. It lacks the depth and complexity of a malt-centric Scottish style, being generally weak and unimpressive overall. No, I wasn't looking for a heavyier Scotch ale styling here, but I did expect a richer feel and presence overall. The flavors and mouthfeel come across weak-kneed and insipid, with little malt boldness within the taste or feel. A relatively surprising dud from Ballast Point..."

"a fine tasting example of the style, but its the feel that throws me a little on this one. cool to have a beer from these guys thats neither hoppy or real dark and intense, seems those make it to the market less. this looks thin for what it is, more caramel than brown in color, but with a nice inch of khaki creamy head on top of it, quite clear too. the nose is fine, a touch of peaty smoke and molasses sweetness under a drying european style yeast strain. the flavor matches the nose almost exactly, but add just a dab of vanilla, and an unexpected hop bitterness like green tea on the back end. its not as heavy on the smoke and roasty malts as the style usually is, which is fine, but the feel being so light i think is a turn off. i need a little more meat to these, and while i like the idea of a session type scottish, it just doesnt really pan out here. still, the quality of the beer is enormously high, like all ballast stuff, and i like the unique mellowness of the malt bill. cool beer, but i prefer their hoppy stuff quite a bit more."

"Disappointed. I really like Ballast Point and I think they rep west coast styles so well, but damn did they miss the bus with this. English pub ale. Almost generic Totally misses the Scotch Ale style for me."

"O:  A great price for a bomber.  A sessionable ale to share with friends.  Just nothing exciting, unlike so many other Ballast Point creations.  Worth a try at this price."
"O - what I'd expect for a Scottish ale. I'm not sure I'd buy it again, but glad to try it. If it was a dollar more I wouldn't have bothered."
"A standard pour yields three plus fingers of ultra lush light khaki colored froth goodness that displays a bit of a rocky top as it settles...  Rock star retention...  The color is a translucent carmelly light-to-medium brown...  A light to moderate bit of slightly sluggish micro sized carbonation...  The nose displays a heavy dose of light brown sugar to start...  There are light notes of caramel and toffee...  Lots of bready malts...  Just a slight whiff of peat...  Simple and straight forward...  The palate is rather uneventful...  Some dark bread malts...  A hint of brown sugar...  Perhaps some peat...  Not much else...  Very understated in terms of overall flavor profile...  On the lighter side of medium bodied...  A bit thin and slightly watery...  Limited carbonation...  Goes down easy enough, but highly uneventful...  A simple but unspectacular Scottish Ale...  Not bad, but aside form a stellar appearance there isn't much to experience or remember here...  I personally think there is a severe shortage of Scottish and Scotch Ales in the current craft beer marketplace, but unfortunately this one doesn't fill the void..."

"Pours a dark, auburn red with a very thin brownish yellow head. The aroma is very one note. It's almost entirely sweet, caramal malt with subtle dark fruit notes. The flavor is top notch. Very dark. Very creamy. Tastes like a rich English toffee. This would be greatly improved with a nice rum barrel aging."
""
"Ballast Point continues to disappoint. Not worth the (relatively) cheap price. I'd grab a Belhaven wee heavy everyday over this one."
""
""
"Eh, mediocre. Not bad, but certainly not Ballast Point's best."

"Overall, this starts off nice in the nose and at first glance, but doesn't really go anywhere. Not overly complex, a little bland, but worth a shot. I love Scottish Ales, but this is just a little meh for my taste."

"O: I really like this brew. Not sure why the BA score is so low. It has a nice set of flavors and isn't overpowering."
""
"Beer really needs to warm up before the nose gets released and the flavors show themselves, and by then the mouthfeel is thin, pushing watery.  Very soft nose begrudgingly gives up caramel and a hint of peat.  Taste is quite muted and muddled, with the caramels darker, almost burnt.  Meh."
""
""
"As another reviewer indicated, its not incredibly complex, but it does have a nice taste."
""
""
""
""
"D:  This is a really nice brew to pick up every now and then.  Far from being my favorite amongst the style as it’s not incredibly complex nor does it give you much to think about. It is however well crafted and quite tasty."

"Overall it's a fine example of a Scottish style Ale but nothing I'm crazy about. I prefer Scotch Ales..."

"O- did not taste like a SA but more like a session red ale"

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/24/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Scottish ale style. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."

"O - I am not a big Scottish Ale fan, but I dig this one. Probably the best Scottish Ale I have had, and I could probably survive being in a UK pub if this one was on draft all night!"

"Overall - A decent, approachable Scottish, though the more I drank, and the warmer it got, the more downhill it went. Suggestion? Don't try to savor it!"
"O - Some qualities of this beer show promise, but it just does not come together for me. Perhaps my least favorite BP brew I've picked up."

"While this meets the criteria for a scotch ale, I’m not sure whether the slight diacetyl flavor and faint peaty are really there, or whether I’m just being hopeful. Unexceptional."

"Pours a deep amber that's close to a dark cola color. Smells of some sweet tablet and some brown sugar syrup. Subtle dark fruits and a touch of some roasted caramel malts. Taste has tons of caramel sweetness, with notes close to that of some Scottish tablet. Very light on the tongue and leaves a bit of body behind. Carbonation is a little on the lower side. The smell definitely compliments the subtle roasted malts and dark fruits. Overall, I was really excited to try it and I'm glad I did! It's a solid, very drinkable Scottish style ale that won't leave you feeling overly imbibed or full. If I were in the mood for this style on a summer day, this one might be my first pick. Otherwise, it might not hold up to the body of others in it's style on those cold dark days."

"Pours a rich clear amber with a half finger light tan colored atop that settled into a frothy mass.Aromas are on the sweet side with alot of caramel and brown sugar,light toast lingers.Caramel and vanilla malty flavors dominate the flavor profile from beiginning to end with just a hint of toastiness.Not bad but one of the more one dimensional Scottish ales I have had in its sweetness."

"Pours a clear dark copper with a khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good but straightforward and simple beer."
"On tap at the Pearl in Point Loma."

"Overall: An enjoyable, fundamentally sound example of the style. Recommended."

"Smooth, nice body on this one. Easily drinkable."
"Medium carbonated and and light bodied, while being slightly creamy. Highly drinkable Scottish ale with an expressive malt body but lacking in aroma."
"D - Very easy to drink!"
"This sort of rides the line between a Scottish Export 80/- and a true Wee Heavy - though I think it is really a weaker rendition of the latter..."
"D: This was a fairly decent beer and would be a good starter beer for someone looking to try out Scottish ales. I say that because the flavors of these types of beers can be a bit overwhelming, so the tame flavors would be a good segue."
"Well done take on the style here by Ballast Point, with just the right amount of balance between the malt, spice, and smoke. Remaining on the lower side of the ABV style spectrum kept this nicely drinkable."
"Overall this has the potential to be a good beer, however as it stands now I'm not quite sold."
"Nose is up front with caramel malt and butterscotch flavors. It gives a sense of an upcoming sweetness that never materializes. A bit of alcohol can be found on the nose as well as the tongue. Taste is similar to the nose and offers a very long finish on the malt. Flavors of butterscotch segue to a somewhat spicy finish, with a hint of pepper, cinnamon and brown sugar. Offers a very nice feel, partly I would assume from the style, and partly from the beer engine. Drink is good and would be higher if not for the ABV."
"D: A simple and straight forward scotch ale."
"Pours dark brown with a quickly dissipating tan head. Carbonation level may be low for some, but just fine for my personal taste. Very slight notes of carmel on the nose, but not much aroma. Seems to open up a bit, as it warms. Overall a good scotch ale that I will drink again."
"D- tasty, very tasty, Scottish, don't miss this one"
