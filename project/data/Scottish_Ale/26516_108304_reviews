"An odd/off twang came through in this beer we opened and not in a good way."
""
"Overall a pretty good beer but this one might as well not be barrel-aged. The barrel presence isn't very prominent and I don't think it added much to the beer at all. Slightly above average for the style."

"O - Overall this was an epic disappointment. Regular Drafty Kilt was my favourite non BA scotch ale and to try this is like a kick in the gut. So unfortunate something went wrong here."
""
""
"Overall, really solid BBA scotch ale."
""

""
"Feel: medium body and carbonation."
""
"overall: Like it's non BA version, quite drinkable, alcohol well hidden. BA has improved this one. I'm probably ruined by Backwoods."

"O- This is a fantastic beer! Flavors all over the map with nice balance and complexity. I'm a GA boy who had never even heard of this brewery until my beer guy gave rave reviews. I will definitely be buying if I ever see it again."
"Far and away the best I've had from Monday Night. The base Drafty Kilt is probably my favorite they brew and the barrel treatment really kicks it up a notch. Nice depth of flavor make it worth checking out. Glad I picked up a few."

"O: This is about as balanced a bourbon forward beer can get. Very easy to drink, balanced sweetness, but quite a bit of bourbon flavor and aroma. The bomber was gone in about 20 minutes. I really enjoy this."

"Actually, if you check history, a lot of Scotch-Irish did settle in the Southeastern U.S. So, why cant Scotch ale and bourbon be friends?"

"It poured a little thicker then it's base. Very little head, A little stayed around the edge of the glass. The smell had vanilla, toffee, and small amount of fruit in it. Definitely alot of bourbon coming out in this one. The taste matched the smell, very nice bourbon notes, when taking the tour I saw the barrels they used are from Heaven Hill. The fruits definitely came thru in the middle and then ended very smoothly. The mouthfeel was low to medium carbonation, it held had great consistency and was not thin at all. Overall this is a great BA brew, go pick some up, it is one of the best BA I have had in GA."
