4.51,22.2,4,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Overall: I grew up in the North-East of England and during the 70s and 80s McEwans was part of Scottish & Newcastle and therefore an almost ubiquitous presence in the pubs (usually in the form of McEwan's Best Scotch). 30-odd years down the line and things have changed beyond recognition - Champion is a bit too heavy and malty for a session beer, but it's a mightly tasty pint that's worth taking your time over. Hop-heads will no doubt look elsewhere, but there's a lovely, malty fruitiness here that's worthy of more than just a cursory glance. Recommended.","interzen","Dec 11, 2014"

3.13,-15.2,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"The alcohol phenols on the finish seem a bit offensive and this suffers from balance issues in places. I did think the flavour was quite good at points, but it never seemed to balance and join together. It became hard to drink honestly, with the high strength they might have bitten off more than they can chew. The last time I had this I remember it being better, so much raw alcohol coming through. This is really bad on the end as it warms, no complexity and tastes increasingly like discount vodka, avoid.","mick303","Beers"
4.04,9.5,4.25,3.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"On the first taste its soon apparent that this is a quite a sweet and strong-ish, warming ale, mildly carbonated and full bodied, with toffee, fudge and caramel notes launching at you!....the lack of initial hopped bitterness to calm the sweetness down seems a bit odd at first, but then it eventually makes its slow appearance under all that sweet caramelised toffee apple exterior, subtle and subdued..but enough to make the overall experience a pleasant one...i find this beer a nice easy to drink sweet and strong ale, ideal for those cold winter nights in...and at 4 bottles for only £5 at my local asda its a real bargain too!...","coltsr2","0"

4.33,17.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D. A delicious strong ale from Scotland. Strange how this is Gordon's Scotch Ale that is brewed for the Belgian market but the %ABV has been lowered from the 8.5% ABV for Belgium to 7.3% for the British market. Although the alcohol content has been lowered it is still a warming beer, great for sipping on a cold evening as it is today even though it is almost June!!","AEK","Mar 16, 2010"
4.01,8.7,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"D-Good on it's own but it seems to fill a role, like port, as an after dinner drink or something I would want with an appetizer spread or a cheese course.","mjgarrett2","Feb 12, 2010"
4.38,18.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D- Dangerously moreish. Very drinkable, i like my big malty beers and this was no exception. A fantastic malty smooth experience with a delicate hop bite in the finish preventing it from being too sweet/syrupy. Delicious!","seanyfo","Sep 30, 2009"

3.76,1.9,5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Definitely a drinkable brew, but it's not one I'd want all the time for 2 reasons: the sweetness is a bit overpowering, and the ABV is too high for a regular drink in my opinion.","fullsweep","Mar 14, 2008"
4.12,11.7,4,2,5,4,5,"This is a truly remarkable beer especially considering that it's from a large commercial brewery. Its rich taste stands out above all. It has a slightly sweet and nutty taste with loads of caramel chocolate malting and a unusual but refreshing hoppy bite (almost overpowering like an IPA). It's well priced too (at least in English supermarkets). It has a very impressive gravity too. I would love the opportunity to sample this on cask.","dartfulavenger","Dec 14, 2007"
3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Taste is sweet with clear notes of diacetyl. A lot of malt covered with caramel malt. Some hints of smoke and caramelization. The mouthfeel is sticky and leaves a layer of sweet caramalt in my mouth. The spices are just detectable, they add a spicy, herbal and a little medicinal taste.","Absumaster","Feb 01, 2007"

4.47,21.1,4.5,5,4.5,5,3.5,"I scored this low on drinkability purely on the strength, 7.3% is too strong for me to drink all night.

3.6,-2.4,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Poured a deep ruby, with a thick off white head, which diminished to a nice layer. Plenty of thick lacing left on the glass. The smell was similar to a wine, raisins, prunes, dark, fruity. The initial treacle flavour gave way to a blackcurrant/liquorice combo, with a hint of pepperyness and a lingering bitterness. This felt heavy in the mouth, and had a warming effect due to the alcohol content. In fact, the alcohol was very noticeable, and became a bit too much as the pint diminished, hence the 3. Way too heavy to session on, and a bit sticky, but nice as a one off I'd say. I did struggle to finish it. I don't think I'll be having this again, but I'm glad I tried it.","zebedee","Jul 11, 2006"

3.95,7,4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Top notch for its style, brought back from London by Mark B. Wonderful wheat though boozy aroma, scotch colour, small white head and significant lace. Great easy mouthful, dry aftertaste with hop leaf. Good malting, understated carbonation. Bit of roasted barley.","Sammy","Mar 13, 2006"
3.76,1.9,4,3,4,4,4,"Beer poured a brownish copperish color with a big tan bubbly head that sustained well. Nose was a bit malty and not much else. Taste was heavilly malty, with hints of dark fruits and a light fruity hop finish. Mouthfeel was smooth, almost creamy like. At 7.3, this is about the biggest beer I tried in the UK, this was an extremly interesting beer to be enjoyed one at a time.","arizcards","Dec 11, 2005"

4.15,12.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"M&D: ultra-soft and creamy on the mouthfeel while the spiciness provides a constant stimulation as does the lingering bitterness. This beer, being as strong as 7.3%abv., is very successful in hiding its alc. under the guise of great smoothness and creamy texture. Very satisfying for a late-night digestif or a winter warmer~~","wl0307","Nov 13, 2004"
4.25,15.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours out a lighter shade of clear mahogony. Had this in the U.K. very nice creamy & malty aroma,which goes right along with the caramel & ever so slightly fruity taste,. Nice carbonation creates a nice full and creamy mouthfeel with nice drinkability. The sweet caramel maltiness flows across my tongue all the way home. This almost heads into barleywine teritory, at least with the sweet maltiness. Most excellent, and a must for a malt monster wanting a strong ale. Once again, a very drinkable strong ale.","avylover","Oct 03, 2004"
3.92,6.2,4,4.5,4,4,3,"The only drawback to this fine ale is its alcoholic strength  I got pretty tipsy after 500 ml of this 7.5% brew.","bark","Aug 14, 2004"
3.95,7,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Other comments: ""No. 1 Champion"" is not an overstatement since, of the McEwan's beers I've tried, this is the best by far. But because of the richness, a full pint of this stuff is a lot for one sitting. Not that I didn't thoroughly enjoy it!","GreenCard","Apr 02, 2004"
3.87,4.9,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall not a bad brew, but a little too sweet and unbalanced, very boozy, i swirlled a mouthfeel and it left my palette with a real alcoholic flavour, like vodka, Its only 7.3 aswell, i've had stuff like storm king stout etc that hide alcohol soooo much better","cypressbob","Aug 24, 2003"
3.12,-15.4,4,2,3,4,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth and it is very quaffable, but the taste and smell let it down. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by this ale compared to the rest of the Mc Ewan's range, but I would certainly not consider this a 'champion'.","Doiv","Beers"
3.54,-4.1,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Darkish ruby-brown hue, translucent, light beige head, slightly more than a fingers worth, excellent retention. Thick rings of lace were produced. The nose is weak light hints of malt, nuts, and butter. Disappointing. The palate is malty with very little hops influences, the alcohol is discernible slight spiciness and licorice hints the sweetness (and butteriness) grows as the beer warms, bready. The body is a touch thin, watery in spots very drinkable, easy to quaff. Low carbonation silky mouthfeel. Sweet/spiced aftertaste. This beer has its moments of greatness the bouquet does lack in potency and it is somewhat simplistic but overall its a damn nice brew. Try one.","bditty187","0"
