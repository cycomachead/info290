4.25,11.5,,,,,,"Was at Phil's Liqour and the owner suggested this beer after I told him what I was looking for in a beer this warm Sunday afternoon.  The guy never steered me wrong before, so this is what I got.  It was a copper colored ale in a stout looking clear bottle.  Poured into a Sierra Nevada hop tulip it poured with a very creamy looking 1'' head which steadily receded to about a quarter inch.  Smells for the glass are nuts, bread dough and a smell I cannot identify.  First impressions on taste are exactly as it smells.  Pleasant, pleasing, and leaving a very slight sourness that lingers on the palate, with just a touch of bitterness balancing it out.  Halfway down the beer I come to a conclusion.  This beer is lower in alcohol, not a ton of flavors, and nothing fancy about it, but in a good way.  Like an old tree that has taken ages to attain a good form, it reflects simplistic beauty.  These beers subtly lull you into spending an afternoon drinking and enjoying good beers without getting hammered.   A beer that could appeal to even those who are not beer enthusiasts as well.  A solid B+ to the folks who made this beer.  If it wasn't 12 a six pack, I would put it into the regular rotation, but this will be a once in a while relaxing Sunday beer from now on.","bebbcorp","Oct 26, 2014"

3.75,-1.6,,,,,,"T-  The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a medium amount of sweetness with the malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the caramel seeming to stick out the most this time and it still has a light smokey aspect to it.  Up next comes the fruity yeast which seems to be just a little lighter than it was in the aroma and there's also just a slight skunky flavor.  On the finish there's not bitterness with a little more sweetness taking it place with just a slight earthy hops flavors and there's some smokey and caramel malt like flavors in the aftertaste.  This was a pretty nice tasting beer, but I could go without the light skunky flavor.","StoutHunter","Sep 13, 2014"

No effervescence on the finish.  Light medium body, yet slick.  Laid back balanced flavor profile.  It begins with a light caramel sweetness that flows into a mild bitterness with a touch of smoke.  As it warms, dark fruit notes are there, but subtle.  Smooth finish with a touch of hop flavor.  A mineral like taste lingers.  A solid offering, but not in the class of Founder's Dirty Bastard.","tillmac62","Sep 08, 2014"

3.5,-8.1,,,,,,"Bachelor Party-Palooza 2014 (Part 1) believes that when in a Scottish-style pub, do as the Scots do and drink up some Belhaven, namely the Scottish Ale.  This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet biscuit, light powdered sugar, mild grass, light flowers, toasted caramel, and hard water.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a tiny twinge of vague fruit, this time more powerful than in the Lager, but still barely there.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a nice malty British ale, one that went pretty well with the chips.","TMoney2591","Aug 16, 2014"

Pours slightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, bread, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, light nuttiness, light pear/apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Scottish ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 19, 2014"

3.75,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours from a nitro can to a full glass of foam which dissipates quickly into a glass of slighty cloudy, coppery amber beer with a fine two finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of caramel malt, a hint of toasted malt and toffee. Flavor follows, but much more subdued. Light caramel, sweet malt, a hint of peat, finishing with slight hops, a bit sour. The flavors are attenuated; very pleasant but too light for my taste. The ""nitro"" widget gives this light bodied beer a hint of creaminess, but also seems to sap the remaining carbonation, giving it a bit of a flat mouth feel. This is still far better than my last Belhaven Scottish Ale, which came in a clear bottle and was badly skunked. With the light flavoring, I see why that one was a complete disaster. A nice, pleasant scottish ale, but somewhat bland.","LiquidAmber","Sep 24, 2012"

It's on the light end of medium bottied, which is interesting because usually a beer this flavorful is really full bodied. This increases its drinkability to a point in my opinion.

This ale sports a deep, dark walnut color and a somewhat thick (slightly heavy) rich malty, nutty flavor. Depending on how you pour it, the head can froth up from 1 finger to 3 fingers and stick with you through the entire drink! The warm fermentation process yields very subtle fruity flavors that are in no way overbearing but rather just a slight aftertaste that coincides with its very smooth and creamy finish. Enjoy some today!!","awmiller","Jul 22, 2011"

There aren't any hops that I can notice in either the taste or the aroma, but in this case that isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation.

Medium-bodied, while smooth in texture comes across much drier than expected. Tea leaf, grain, bitters and meadow grasses elevate here and there's a white citrus zest tackiness as well.

A little earthiness and nuttiness as well. The hops also play a large part in the flavor. The hops give a floral and earthy quality that combines well with the slightly nutty and smokey quality of the malt. Has a creamy texture from the nitro but it feels a little thin.

Very much a classic ale and distinctly European in style. Medium carbonation with a soft, medium body. Well balanced in every well and quite enjoyable.

The only problem I have with this beer is that I only ever want to have one. It's a bit heavy as it warms up, and by the time I get to the bottom, I really don't want another.

There's a certain earthiness to it, which I'll assume comes from the roasted malt and nut flavors. Overall, a fine beer, though in the heat of summer, good for a sample, rather than a couple.

Hopefully this is an isolated phenomenon and Ill report back on the other three cans in the 4-pack. Otherwise this a nice middle of the road Scottish ale with a tasty emphasis on the malt.

Very tasty. Feel was moderate, with a light carbonation, as is the case with most nitro taps brews. There was a good creamy character as well. Drinkability on this one was really good.

It really is nutty and chestnutty with some viscosity from the hops. Some sweet citric notes, but very light. Quite woody, showing hints of dark chocolate too. Maybe a light hint of blackberries.

There's a creaminess here that resembles drinking sweet milk with spices. The body is full, also like milk. Perhaps not for the average beer drinker, as it doesn't seem like any other beer I've had.

Hops are mild to light in the finish, not really a big player in this brew. There is also a distinct smokiness to this beer. The smoke flavors are especially evident in the aftertaste where it even takes on strong hints of jerky. This is the second time that Ive had this beer. I dont remember much of a smoke flavor the first time around. Carbonation is moderate, and the mouthfeel is light to medium. This leans more towards the malt but is not too sweet.

To me scotch ales have always been strong tasting with a considerable bite. This didn't have it. But what it did have was a balanced tasting beer that I could drink all night if I wanted to. Definitely noticed roasty wood flavor along with a good mix of sweet malts and bitter hops. Slight grainy flavor combined with other flavors make for a nice finish.

It had a small white head that was pretty thick. The smell was sweet and malty but it was kind of hard to pick them up. The taste was at first puzzling. It was not really what I expected it was very mellow and not in your face. It took me a couple sips to see the true character of this beer.

Very agreeable palate, malty, nutty with just enough hops in the background, a suggestion of bitterness and an odd touch of burnt flavor (wood?). I find the complexities of the palate to be damn tasty. I also love the fact the abv is under four; this would make a great session brew.

I give it good marks on mouthfeel and finish but the nitrocan is a bit thin in body, where as the draft and bottle are similar in being a medium bodied brew.

There is a watery feeling about it. The malt aroma that was so prominant, was not so prominant in the taste. It drank very smooth. The body is very lite. The abv.

The tastes were of semi-sweet malt, floral hops, wood, roasted malt and nuts, bread, and some fruit and spices. It left a dry hop taste on my tongue as I swallowed.

My sister lives in Ireland and when she comes home, she brings peet with her. Now I know what it tastes like. This beer has the strongest peet taste I've experienced. It's not just smoky peet, but green peet! It's like someone threw some manure in my brew! (Although it hurts the drinkability). The beer starts with a silken mouthfeel, immediately fades into the manure/green peet combo, then into a subtle malt sweetness, and then ends in a very wet, subtle grain and limewater finish with just the slighest inkling of bittering hops. Very low alcohol and great mouthfeel makes it easy to drink if you can get past the poop taste. This is a unique brew, especially if you like the taste of wet goats and other musty barnyard animals:)","Mitchster","Feb 03, 2003"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer poured a beautiful clear deep copper. A thick tight beige head settled into a nice thin layer of foam that lasted all the way down. Lacing was great. Aroma was a bit sweet and a tad grassy? Deep malty, smokey and slighty sweet taste was a winner. Nice creamy thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable. A solid choice on a winters night with a meat and potatoes meal.","Mark","Jan 30, 2003"
3.19,-16.3,4.5,3,3,4,3,"Belhaven's Scottish Ale poured a dark amber or cherry red.The carbonation was decent with a good head and high amounts of lace.A good crisp mouthfeel but lacked in taste.Hints of hops and raisins with a medium body and slight malt thickness.The ABV is only 3.9%?Wine coolers have more than that I think.Prunes,raisins,nuts,and caramel are noted on the finish.An alright brew..I wouldnt buy it again.","kelticblood","Jan 20, 2003"
1.54,-59.6,4,2.5,1,1,1,"The taste was awlful. The first and second sips had the flavor of this beer being brewed in a vat full of vinyl or a vinyl vat. I swear that this beer had a sour vinyl flavor. What a waste of beer and my money for a below, sub-standard beer.","BeerManDan","Jan 11, 2003"
3.91,2.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer is a light amber color with good white foam (characteristic of nitro draught). The aroma was rather mild (malt, hops). The taste is light, with hops the dominant flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a good balance of hops. The drinkability is good as this ale goes down easily.","UncleJimbo","Jan 08, 2003"
4.13,8.4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"I like Scottish beers, so I thought I would give this a chance. It's not heavy like I usually like 'em, but it's still good. Had a nice head to it and dark caramel color. Finished smooth and pleasant to drink. It's not the best, but it's also not that bad either.","JISurfer","Dec 27, 2002"
3.14,-17.6,3,4,2.5,5,2.5,"This beer is a contrast of features: A beautiful appearance and a lightly hopped up bouquet (Barely any hops in the taste though) This one is so creamy the taste slips by your palate before you can get the taste. The texture is excellent though - almost like liquid silk. But this beer is disappointingly bland. If you don't like hops and your love creamy ales then this is probably the beer you have been longing for - however it just doesn't tickle my fancy.","AtrumAnimus","Dec 27, 2002"
3.98,4.5,4,3.5,4,5,4,"The taste was malty with some earthy flavors. Nutty flavors dominate. The mouthfeel is the kicker though. Its awesome! As smooth and creamy as you can get. An absolute delight for the tongue!","IrishRedRock","Dec 22, 2002"
4.52,18.6,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"this beer has very mild carbonation, which suits me well. it is extremely smooth and creamy, an overall wonder to drink. sweet and malty with a good hop balance. this one is really a fine brew. i get a little roastiness towards the end, and i enjoyed it all the way through.","ElGuapo","Dec 03, 2002"
4.2,10.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A very solid brew. Malty with a touch of hops that tickles the tongue as the beer is drank. First Scottish Ale for me and I was very pleased with it. Darker colored ale with a thicker yet frothy white head. The bar we go to in town has this and I tried it out of curiosity. Will have a few more when I get paid.","allboutbierge","Dec 03, 2002"
3.26,-14.4,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours a dark copper colour topped by a pretty nice head. I must say i was a bit dissapointed by the smell of the beer (not what i expected) but the taste was as expected and read (hints of malt and moderate smoky taste). This beer could be much more better if ABV was around 5.0%. In overall... average Scottish brew","ipogios","Nov 29, 2002"

3.3,-13.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a head that quickly faded but left a nice sticky lace that clung to the sides of the glass.  The aroma is dominated by a sweet maltiness with hints of peat, wood, and smoke.  The flavor is roasted malt with a good hop balance and a bitter finish.  All around, a nice brew for a decent price ($1.59 for a 12oz bottle).","Morris729","Nov 13, 2002"
3.63,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The pour a crystal clear deep copper, the head is pulchritudinous, creamy in consistency, the lace fine sheets that cling longingly to the glass. Nose is sweet malt, caramel, earthy; maybe its my imagination but ""Hints of Peat""? Front is sweet, the top is reedy, the finish is charmingly hopped, convivially carbonated, with a congenially dry aftertaste. A very clean and refreshing beer to end my day, so its time to light up my daily cigar and Chill Baby!","Gusler","Nov 13, 2002"
3.75,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Keep in mind that this is simply a Scottish Ale, as in an ale from Scotland, and not a Scotch Ale, as in the style of strong, heavy brews such as McEwans Scotch Ale.","DerKaiser","Nov 08, 2002"
3.38,-11.3,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Clear brown in color.  Slight beige head diminishes to a rimming in seconds.  Some faint malt tones and a mustiness present on the nose.  Subdued sweet caramel-like malt tones on the palate.  Dry smoky tones noted as well.  Almost medium in body.  Seems like a watered down version of a good Scotch Ale, but this style is not my specialty.  Good enough tasting and easy enough to drink.  Just won't be seeked out by me in the future.","Bighuge","Nov 07, 2002"
4.52,18.6,4,4.5,5,4,4,"Reasonable head, bubbles on side of glass. Perhaps a wimpy pour on my part. Fragrant malt odor with peat hints, wood, smoke and musty stone. Velvet smokiness in the flavor; I am taken aback at how much smoke I am getting from this (on par with a Bamberger Rauchbier) and how much I am loving it. Thick chewy malts with some sweetness, butter, caramel, earth hints and more smoke. Finish is wet and delectable. Like standing in a meadow of grasses and heather next to a smokehouse. Elegant and rustic at the same time. Complex, delicate, and yet forceful like a 2-ton oaken dining room table.","Thrasher","Oct 31, 2002"
3.9,2.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a clear dark brown color with a tan small but very tight-bubbled head.   The smell is starts your mouth watering with a sweet nutty malty aroma.  Superb malty taste and mouthfeel with a light toast flavor and a smoked aftertaste.  Light hops provide a nice balance.  Nicely done as it goes down very smooth.  Pretty good brew!  Slainte Mhor!","BeerAngel","Oct 13, 2002"
3.02,-20.7,3,3.5,3,2,3,"Similar to Boddington's or Caffrey's, but thinner and with a lingering aftertaste. There are much better widget offerings out there. Nice cascade during the pour but the head is weak and short-lived. I expected better.","Dogbrick","Aug 28, 2002"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a nice ruby color with an aroma of roasted malt that finished with a hint of hops.  The flavor was more of the same, roasted malt with a nicely balanced hop finish.  The mouthfeel was smooth, with long-lasting flavor.  I enjoyed this more than the St. Andrews.","ryanocerus","Aug 26, 2002"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Musty almost nut smell.  Crystal deep red color with lots of little bubbles.  Nutty malty taste with a base of roasted malt.  It tastes just like fall, this would be a solid selection for the cooler months. Smooth mouth.  The tongue is left with a slightly sweet finish with a balenced hop bite.","frank4sail","Aug 22, 2002"
4.42,16,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Copper/amber in color with a rich, creamy head that holds fairly well. The aroma is not real assertive, but gives a first note of light hop, followed by lightly toasted - almost 'wort-like' - malt. The body is on the light side, and combined with a gentle carbonation, gives a lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor offers a nice balance with malt preceeding hops and a very slight butterscotch note. Clean, fresh, medium-long dry aftertaste. An excellent session beer with some complexity and a high level of drinkability.","NeroFiddled","Aug 09, 2002"
3.13,-17.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Quite similar to Bass in a session-drinking sort of way, but with a decidedly Scottish vibe.","DarthMalt","Aug 07, 2002"
4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a dark amber color and left a off white bubbly head that left some nice lace.  It had an aroma of hops, malt and a little smokiness.  The flavor was of malt with some smokiness.  The finish was smokey with a dry, slightly bitter aspect to it.  A good beer and will probably have again on tap at my local British pub, Macs.","Wildman","Jul 26, 2002"
3.76,-1.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"A wonderful dark tan color cascading down the glass, with a creamy head.   Very smooth, with earthy flavors upfront.  Bitterness is sublte, but this beer does hand around long enough to let you know it has some presence.  Malty but not too sweet this is a good drinking ale that does not overwhelm you.  A drinking man's beer. (or womens if you like)","AaronRed","Jul 22, 2002"
3.71,-2.6,5,4,3,4.5,4,"A solid brew, a good-looker, but weaker flavour than I would imagine.  I recall likeing the bottled version better.  Slight odd, heady aftertaste, but damn good.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Jul 17, 2002"
3.95,3.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability/notes: A very nicely balanced beer. A number of reviewers have praised this ale in the nitro version; this review was based on a 500 mL glass bottle. I suspect that the nitro version is even better.","Pegasus","Jun 07, 2002"
3.03,-20.5,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pretty good, smoky, peaty, nutty but qute thin, enjoyable seession beer, but not great, i don't mind drinking it though, just not overly interesting.","rastaman","Jun 02, 2002"

4.22,10.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Attractive all around in appearance.  The thick head exhibits good retention, and the dark copper hued brew has just a hint of haziness.  The roasted grain notes that dominate the aroma are quite nutty, very biscuity and toast - like.  Fruity yeast esters are subtle, but add to the complexity. Definitely the best aroma I've encountered in a brew this light.  Although light in body, malt flavors abound and are certainly toasty and nutty-- the flavor is similar to the aroma. No surprises.  Hop character is masked by the smooth but pronounced roasted grain bitterness.  The finish is of smooth roasted unmalted barley w/ a touch of hop bitterness.  Belhaven Scottish Ale is a prime example of why lower alcohol brews can be very flavorful.  It's a fine session brew, but is a couple notches below Belhaven's St. Andrews Ale in terms of depth of flavor.","marc77","Apr 07, 2002"
3.43,-10,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Personally I like Scottish Ales, and this isn't a bad example of the style, so I can't give it a bad rating.","aracauna","Mar 28, 2002"
4.35,14.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Great complexity distinguishes this beer, even with its light body.  When I first had this in a bottle, I fell in love with it.  On tap, my opinion is not quite so high, however.  The nitro makes it a little too smooth, and the reduced carbonic acid removes a key note to the complexity.  Still definitely a great beer.","Erix","Mar 20, 2002"
4.22,10.8,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Yes!  A Scottish Ale that's a Scottish Ale (rather than a stronger Scotch Ale)...very pleasant creaminess that takes full advantage of the ""nitro-ball""...pleasant but mild floral hoppiness and sweet lightly carmel maltiness...I think the nitro can is put to great use on this one...","ADR","Mar 05, 2002"
4.1,7.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I never thought I'd give a nitro can 4's across the board, but this beer was really enjoyable.  A light, easy-drinking scottish-style session beer.","pbrian","Jan 29, 2002"
4.5,18.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tired of US craft brewers loose interpretations of this style? This is the real deal. No surprises, just a classic Scottish ale. Ruby colored with a grape-like fruity aroma. In taste, roasted malt and grain are evident, with the same grape-like fruitiness, and an ever so subtle alcohol nip. Slick on the palate typical of the classic ales of the UK. Outstanding.","John","Jan 14, 2002"
4.7,23.4,4,4,5,5,5,"Very good example of a scottish ale.  Not too powerful, and quite drinkable. Try it you'll like it. :)","stoutman","Dec 16, 2001"
3.96,3.9,4,3,4,4,5,"Without the nitro, this beer would be just an average ale. With the nitro and it takes on the characters of all other nitros ... an easy drinky, eye-candy pleasing beer. Lovely stuff.","Todd","Dec 14, 2001"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"A gorgeous brown/amber, with a white creamy head.  Head remains strong all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Malty, roasted nuts, smoke and woodey notes.","Jordan","Dec 10, 2001"
2.94,-22.8,2,3,3,3,3,"Root beer brown with a significant amount of sediment in the bottle.  No date, so it may have been old.  Slightly yeasty with tart malt flavor.  The Wee Heavy is a better choice.","Brent","Aug 07, 2001"
