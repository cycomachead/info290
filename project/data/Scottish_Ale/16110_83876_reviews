"Cheers"
"It's on the light side of medium-bodied, pretty smooth and crisp most of the way, easing out of it a little later in the sip."
"Overall â€“ The mouthfeel of this brew in conjunction with its moderately sweet, but rather malty flavor really make this brew a nice drinker. A very interesting scotch ale that tastes much bigger then it should (at least in terms of its abv.). A rather nice brew overall."

"This was given to me from the can so I can't describe the appearance, however the aromas and flavors were typical of a scottish ale. Sweet malts, toffee, nuts. Its a little lighter than say Dirty Bastard or Old Chub, but the flavors come together nicely and id consider this a good, sessionable/drinkable scottish ale. Better than the Babbling Blonde I had previously."
"Equally tasty but a little on the flat side. Malty sweetness with a good bit of toffee and dark fruits. Perhaps a tad too sweet, for me anyway."
"Overall: I thought this was a solid beer. Price is good and the beer is tasty. I think most anyone would could like this. Especially non-beer lovers. At 5.1% ABV I would say pretty sessionable. I would have no problem drinking this again."

"Overall I really like and had it before but this is the first time it's not very carbonated. Flavors are not off and drinks great so it didn't influence much. Great brew from a local craft brewery."
"Overall, a very solid, very drinkable lighter scottish style ale."

"Not savory enough, due to the slight watery taste. Had a lot going for it, at first. Then, it died off into 'mellow land'. Take it or leave it. Either way."
"Overall - Pretty simple, basic and easy drinking. About the mildest, lightest scotch ales out there. Nothing special, would be a nice starter beer for scotch ales."
"OVERALL: I drank a six pack of this like nobody's business. Lighter bodied for a scotch ale, but with good malt flavor. To revert to the traditional, antique ""schilling"" scale, consider this a 60- schilling, which would indicate a Scottish ale of lighter body and strength."

"The Maxwell's Scottish Ale is a great lighter style Scotch ale. Gives those who are afraid of the dark and good intro to malty awesomeness. This beer poured a dark amber without much head or lace. The smell and taste was bolster by a malt with slight roast goddness. The body was light and had smooth carboantion. Overall its a decent lighter dark beer,,,,call it mild dark>"
