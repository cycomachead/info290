Pours fairly hazy and cloudy orange copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, raisin, toast, bread, floral, light peat, and floral earthiness; some light phenols as well, but not too bad. Some nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity; the phenolic note knocks it down a bit. Taste of caramel, toast, raisin, pear, bread, floral, light pepper, light peat, and floral earthiness; slight phenols noticed after the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, bread, floral, light pepper, light peat, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors with solid complexity; good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. The phenolic note was noticeable, but not too detracting. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Scottish ale. Good balance of malt/fruity flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

If it is going to be this sweet, it should have some more body to it, IMHO. It lacked any subtle smoky quality, which is what I really look for from the style.

Scents of roast malt, toasted malt, fruity esters and some nutty scents. Quite nice, suggesting a nutty, roasty yet sweet taste. Flavor of sweet malt, some fruity sweetness, a bit berry-like, slight toffee and vague hints of alcohol with a faint hint of roast malt on the aftertaste. It's almost cloyingly sweet, far too much for my tastes. The roast and nutty scents do not carry into the taste at all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a semi-drying finish. It's quite easy to drink from that perspective. Overall it's not a bad beer, just a bit too sweet for my tastes. On other occasions I've had this beer it's been a lot more roasty and nutty, and I really enjoy it a lot when it's like that, it just seems to vary from batch to batch and this batch was a sweet one.","Auraan","Aug 12, 2012"

It did end a little dryer than I would have liked, but it also cut back on any aftertaste, which is always fine with me. I don't know why, but I just can't seem to handle aftertastes well.

Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is on the low side. I find it hard to describe scottish ales. They generally remind me of a less robust oktoberfest. This one seems faithful to the style and a generally good 'anytime' beer.","chOAKbarrell","May 02, 2006"

4.3,15.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I have really come to love the Scotch ale style. Four Peaks does a good rendition of this malty, rich tipple. Who knew a desert brewer could make this weighty style work. Maybe it was the fact that I had spent 8 plus hours hiking in the desert, maybe it was the wonderful desert air but this brew was silky, smooth, malty and delicious. This brew paired nicely with a chicken caesar...I was in heaven. rich deep brown color with notes of chocolate and caramel...a slice of heaven in a pint glass.","Citadel82","Apr 14, 2006"
4.02,7.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The beer empties from the 12-ounce brown bottle a clear deep copper color, the head piles high on the body, its texture semi-creamy, the color a winsome light tan, with its demise the lace forms a nice concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, hints of caramel, fresh, crisp, and clean to the senses, start is mildly sweet, the grain profile pleasant, the top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a benign carbonation, the hops perfect in their modest spiciness, the aftertaste dry and long lasting, what else can you say but its a darn good drinking beer, and worth a sample.","Gusler","Apr 06, 2006"
2.65,-29,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"The label reads "smooth full bodied Scottish ales". Smooth it is not. Further "with the slightest hint of peat-smokey barley". This I can believe. That might explain some of the clovey sting. Md-light body with moderate carbonation. I enjoyed the experience of this beer, but wouldn't seek out another. It just doesn't fit the bill for my sweet malty loving palette. I can, however, think of many fans of belgian beer that I think would love this beer.","mentor","Nov 11, 2005"

3.65,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"There is also a nice level of hop bitterness in this beer that adds just enough bite in the finish to help balance the malt. I also think that some of the fruitiness found in this beer is from the flavor hops used. This is a nicely quaffable brew, and it has a fair amount of complexity for a beer of this strength.","Gueuzedude","Jun 04, 2005"

3.8,1.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Clear amber body with a tall cream colored head. Some light lacing was left. Sweet caramel malts stand out over a light fruitiness. A bit of smoke is in the back as well. Taste starts of with more sweet caramel, a touch of fruit and a light roastiness. Very malty all around as expected though a bit of a lighter flavor. Ends on a sweet caramel note. About medium with a creamy feel. Easy drinking stuff and it doesnt come off as overly sweet. Thanks to Secret Bunny 05 and nvsblman for this tasty treat.","meathookjones","Apr 13, 2005"
4.05,8.6,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Slightly hazy, color was orange-light amber with an off-white head that poured like it was very carbonated. Head dissipated slowly but wasn't terribly rocky or dense. Aroma was mildy malty, perhaps a bit underwhelming. Flavor was great - malty sweet, maybe even a bit too sweet - the malt character struck me as perhaps non-Scottish (different than like Golden Promise), but good, and indeed the label said its North American malt. No matter - this is tasty and delicious. Mere touch of hops keeps it from being cloying. Nice full body and high drinkability. Thanks Secret Santa 2004 nvsblman!","KroMagnon","Jan 13, 2005"
3.62,-2.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This poured with a hearty head of creamy tan foam. Super carbonated and slightly hazy orangey gold in color. Sweet lemony notes rises from the glass. Hidden deep behind that are touches of dark molasses and sweet malts and a chocolate peatiness that borderlines wet musty cardboard. The taste is surprisingly effervescent and refreshing. This beer really makes me belch  and I mean that in a good way. The high carbonation almost makes the beer seem creamy. Spritzy and velvety going down. Whoa! The second pour turned out to be a bit of an explosion. My cup runneth over! Sweet and tangy with black licorice notes. Overall, an interesting beer, with some unique flavors. I liked it.","pezoids","Jan 12, 2005"

3.73,0,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2" of slightly off-whitish head, which provides slight lacing. Clear amber in hue, with a malty, somewhat smoky aroma, and something else that escapes me but seems odd. Flavor is a showplace of medium malts such as caramel, with a smoky twist, which makes it distinctive. Mouthfeel is smooth, and its nice to have a smoke flavor that isn't all about the smoke, but rather an accompaniment to the beer's already present flavors. Very nice Scottish style ale.","ppoitras","Apr 08, 2004"

3.95,5.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"My final beer exchange from Tempe Az. My first impression was a stricking appearance of a clean dark amber brew with a fair sized off white head. The aroma was sweet toffee and caramel. That aroma is reflected in the taste as well as a malty smoked barley with a background of earthy hop. The mouth is left slightly sweet. an all around good scottish style thats drinkable with most any meal or as a sweet dessert offering. Thanks mrpicklerelish, I look to find others from Four Peaks.","chilidog","Jan 18, 2004"

There is a smoked graininess there too. Taste is sweet malts and an alcohol warmth. There is a mild hop bitterness to add a little balance to the mix. I'm picking up an almost smoked meat quality too. Finishes on the dry side. Average body & slightly undercarbonated but overall fairly drinkable. My thanks to Gusler for the trade.","cretemixer","Apr 01, 2003"
3.42,-8.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A bit mellow and understated for the style, Kiltlifter tasted more like an 80 Schilling than a Wee Heavy. After a bit of contemplation, I guess that Four Peaks may well have been shooting for that style. In either case, I thought the beer was slightly over-carbonated, slightly uncomplex and all around an average experience. Kiltlifter tasted more like a Maibock than anything Ive had out of Scotland lately Id drink this beer again if I were in Arizona, but only after I confirmed that Mogollon was unavailable.","TXHops","Mar 28, 2003"
3.85,3.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a slightly hazy orange-amber with a short and foamy bone-white head that dissipates shortly. The nose expresses a sweet malt and a touch of smoke. The body is medium with a fine and restrained carbonation that leaves it lightly creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is exactly as the aroma indicates with a sweetish, honeyish malt that has a thread of peat-smoked character running through it. There's some minor hop flavor in there as well, but it's character is hard to pin down... it's somewhat floral and a touch leafy (the bottle lists Goldings and that appears to match up). It finishes drying with a short lingering residual maltiness and a touch of residual hop flavor. I'm not sure where it would rank in the Scottish / Scotch Ale category. It's loaded with sweet malt, but not nearly enough to fit the 110 -/- or Scotch Ale style; and yet a bit too full to be an 80 -/-. Regardless, it's an interesting and enjoyable beer with poor head retention being it's only drawback. They've brought on a new brewer who was at Alaskan for a few years, and they've also acquired a "real" bottling line (to replace their Meheen) so I'm looking forward to trying their beers again soon!","NeroFiddled","Jan 19, 2003"
3.95,5.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"An amber brew with a small head that dissipates quickly.  Lots of points lost in the head department since it completely disappears after a while.  Roasted grain in the aroma, coffee and chocolate.  Smells like a porter in a way.  Caramel and peat in the nose as well, letting you know that this is a Scottish ale.  The flavor is more impressive, spicy and sweet peatiness with a bit of the roasted grain from the nose.  Caramel malt has a big presence.  Coats the tongue with sweetness as this style should.  Not the best Scottish ale I've ever had, I would prefer more body and richness, but it's certainly a good try at the style and is highly drinkable.","hyuga","Oct 28, 2002"
4.25,13.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"What can I say, it's not often you find a scottish ale at a brewpub.  Apart from the absence of a head of any sort, which might have been due to bar glassware, this is a very solid beer.  Tasty and drinkable.","mzwolinski","Sep 24, 2002"
