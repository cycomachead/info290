"Dark brown, almost black.  Tan head, leaves generous lacing.  I never like the aroma of Scottish styled ales, but like all others, there is a strong malty...butterscotch-like scent.  The flavor is malty, caramel and butterscotch-like as well.  The carbonation is light and the body is heavy.  I like these attributes in stronger beers.  Enjoyable.  I'm not a huge fan of Scottish ales (except Founders' Dirty Bastard) but this is not bad.  I only wish it had a little more strength than 7.5% ABV."

"Appearance: Bright dark brown with a touch of ruby under a tan tinted foam cap that mounds up over the rim of the glass. Smell: Fruit, touch cocoa, slight alcohol.Taste:  The flavor is malty and dry with traces of grains and cardamom and chocolate. Mouthfeel: Thick and malty, not quite a scotch ale but good. Overall: One dimensional, slight smoke, not complex."
"I'm sure this is a great beer for people who like hops, unfortunately that is not me"

"Well made in my opinion.  It is fairly simple, and has great balance.  Nothing is dominate, and an all around joy to drink.  I need to get some more."

"I'm a big fan of Central Waters, especially for their barrel-aged program.  And I have friends who rave about Slainte.  But I do not like this brew."

"Nothing about this beer is out of line - all perfect to style (at least for me) and right on point for where a scotch ale should be.  good malt sweetness and backbone with the right bite in toward the finish of the yeast - This and Lake Louie Warped Speed make me think that Wisconsin is really an outpost of Edinburgh!"

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. At first glance the head has mostly fine foam with rather lively looking large bubbles that leave a solid trace for lacing as the level recedes. The aroma is mildly toffee-ish with a wisp of molasses. The texture is airly robust even for a Scottish ale. A sip can be a mouthful. The overall taste has both the sweet & bitter of burnt sugar with a solid malty background. In a word substantial. I had to look twice when I saw a mere 5.2% as the ABV. It has all the character of the bigger bolder choices out there. Pretty unique, in a good way."

"Final score: 3.90"

"Pours very dark with hints of amber and burnt caramel. Moderate tan head. Aroma of plum, cherry, molasses, and bread. More stone fruits and molasses in the taste as well as hints of chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied with a light to fair amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, one of my favorites of the style."

"O: This beer seems to be very easy to drink for a Scottish Ale but is rather easy to drink. I found it to be enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine Scottish ale, one of the best I've tried. The presentation and complexity are both excellent. A more robust body would really elevate this brew to the next level."
""
"This beer I could recognise three facets to the flavor, sweet to start, nice bite to dry the sweetness in the middle and a huge flavor in the end that gains clarity from the dry middle. Best Scottish ale I've had."
""
""
""
"Recommendation - One more for the malt lover and much fresher than any import you can find on the shelf at any liquor store. If you see it, grab it."
""
""
""
"Overall one of the better Scottish ale's I've had as it is not cloyingly sweet. The bitterness helps to balance out the sweet malt"

"I'm a fan of CW's Satin Solstice/Solitude imperial stout, but I like this even more. Excellent effort."
"The Central Waters Scottish Ale is decent and worth a try. The beer poured a deep amber....almost opaque with thin head that left a little lacing. The scent carried earth, peat and some malt. The taste had a nice malt base with a slight roast and earth. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a decent scotch ale."

"O - Central Waters Sl√°inte is another generously malty beer that exceeds expectations across the board. It's deep and complex malt aroma is the perfect usher into the flavor of similar malt complexity and depth all while remaining balanced and smooth-drinking. Alcohol, while higher in content, is almost undetectable in this smooth beer making it a lovely winter warmer!"

"look is a dark ruby with translucent edges. smell is light; chocolate and butterscotch malts. taste is similar to the smell with butterscotch and chocolate but mostly sweet malts with a touch of dark fruit. the hops are English and bitter"

"O: Overall this is a very good Scotch ale, maybe it is a matter of preference, but I find I enjoy more of the dark fruit flavors in my Scotch ales. All said, this at 7.5% ABV the booze is not immediately present."
"Overall damn I can't believe this isn't a regular beer on the lineup, such a smooth malty scotch ale. Worth picking up if you find it."

"Verdict: A decent enough beer, not sure it's a decent enough Scottish Ale. Either way, I enjoyed my pint, but I doubt I'd ask for another."
""
"I'm not HUGE on the start of this, but the finish is quite nice, indeed. Overall, not bad. I prefer my Scottish styles a touch more malty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I'm not a huge fan of scotch ales but this is a good one. Too bad they ran out of the barrel aged version before the anniversary party becuase I would have loved to try it."
""
"Fun times at all those faux-Irish bars... Anyway, this stuff pours a dark garnet-brown topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises mild molasses, brown sugar, light cola, light dark fruits, and a pinch of chocolate powder. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of fruits, definitely in the figgy vein. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mildly grainy feel. Overall, a very nice Scottish ale, an entertaining and enjoyable beer all-around."

"O- I have not had a whole lot of Scottish Ales, but this brew was delicious. Rich, sweet, malty, with enough smoke and heat to keep you warm in a Wisco December night"

"O: This style is a tough sell for me, but I enjoyed this immensely. Rich, malty, and perfect for a cold evening!"

"This is an enjoyable Scottish ale. It's a little less intense than the Scotch ales I enjoy but still very good. I had the Bourbon barrel aged Scotch Ale at the Central Waters tap room back in October and it was outstanding. I think that is supposed to be released next month."
"Overall- Another solid beer from Central Waters. Lots of complex smells and flavors done in a true scotch ale style."
"Bottle from 2011 summer trip. This style is hit and miss for me. This version is a winner. Dark brown with a small consistent off-white head, and some lace. A rich yeast malted aroma. Medium mouthfeel, however it is smooth. The chocolate, the smoke, the malt, all nicely integrated."
""
""
""

"Not technically a sipper but one youll want to savor nonetheless. Fairly complex. Good Scotish ale Central Waters! Looking forward to the barrel aged version."
""
"This one was memorable for all the tobacco notes in it."
"Overall: Not my favorite style I must admit but this one is enjoyable if you're in the mood for a rich, sweet, malty beer."
""
""
"This thing was pretty awesome. It didn't offer more than any other beers of the same style, but it was very solid and clean."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not the most potent or flavorful beer, but nicely drinkable for a malty beer."
"A decent beer, but nothing about it impresses me. I can drink it, and enjoy it, but it's not whispering (or shouting) to me that I need to drink more of it. So I probably won't."
""
""
"Toasty, roasty, and dry, dark palate. Biscuits, pumpernikel crust, brownie powder, and faint coffee grounds. Theres a yeasty, fruity sweetness underneath everything. Maybe plums or prunes. Dry, but still oily palate overall. Very good, full flavor ale. I'm glad Central waters is available in IL!!! :)"

"O- This flavor in a thicker, better smelling beer would be amazing. As it stands still solid"
""

"O- The nice malt flavor is not real rich but nice and it would be nice to have more of it in the nose. The bitterness is a bit too strong but not offensive by any means."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, perfume, and peat. The taste is a nice malty balance of toffee, caramel, and hints of peaty perfume. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the better Scottish Ales I've tasted. I can see myself drinking this beer regularly."
""
"O- Not very familiar with the style and wouldn't be a go to by any means, but this is a awesome beer! Will have to pick up more of this since its a seasonal."
"D - A solidly executed Scottish Ale - I had no problem finishing a 12oz bottle on my own and I'd gladly drink another. Love the affordable Wisconsin price point too. Probably not a big enough beer to benefit from barrel-aging though."
"Overall: Nice smooth scottish ale with almost a belgian dark ale twist on the front end of the beer. Enjoyable and a great offering!"
""
"Cost: $8.99 for a six pack"
"O: I enjoyed this beer, it reminds me of a ""double"" marzen. Lacking the smokiness I like with some scotch ales, but not a bad thing with this one."
""
""
""
""
"I don't think this fits the style real well, but it is an enjoyable malt heavy beer. A real nice winter beer that isn't overly high in abv. I think this would be a nice candidate for CW barrel aging program. Could be a Backwoods Bastard type beer? I'll keep my fingers crossed."
"An excellent Scottish ale from one of new favorite breweries. It pours nice and black with a little head and a little lacing. The smell and taste are both rich and smoky, with chocolate and peat notes. An excellent sipper for a cold nice. Almost taste like a stout or extra rich porter."
"o 4.5+ not always in the mood for a scottish ale, granted, but what a fine example this is. i might turn up the hops and peat the slightest fraction of a degree, and add some chew, but then perfection would be the result."
"O - Another terrific offering from this sleeper 'Sconnie brewery. I'm a confirmed hophead but thought I'd try a Scotch Ale on a chilly Wisconsin night, and I'm glad I did. This is one big sweet malty complex beverage and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you, Central Waters and Slainte to you!"
"This beer had a nice dark pour and the bitter, slightly sour taste that I expected (and like) from a Scotch Ale. There was also a subtle sweet aftertaste that I enjoyed. This one seemed to lack a little bit of the kick that I like from the Lake Louie offerings so hopefully my score reflects that I like this beer but not as much as it's competitor."
"O: For a much-debated style, it's pretty good. A maltier, boozier bitter, it scratches the itch, and is a very, very drinkable beer for a very, very agreeable price."
"O) Admittedly, Scottish Ales are not one of my favorite styles, but I tend to enjoy most Central Waters offerings. Having said all of that, I still found this to be just okay. I would not likely seek this one out again."
"Velvety smooth feel, wisps of peat smoke, and woody bitterness in the aftertaste, with some light malt sweetness up front. Some fruity yeast lends indistinct grape or currant notes. Finishes fairly dry and woody, not too sweet overall. Really enjoyable stuff, will look for more while it's in season."
" ~ This is another fine addition to an already proven line-up of brews offered by the crew at CW. This is one I hope they keep putting up on the shelves here in Central Wisconsin."
""
"Overall, I was surprised by how much scotch ale type flavor this beer has. With the low alcohol I expected a much lighter beer but this has tons of flavor. It could use a bit more hop flavor but it's such a small issue. This is a sessionable beer with a huge amount of flavor, I'm a huge fan. I'm hoping Central Waters decides to turn this up a couple notches and make a full on scotch ale, maybe even something bourbon barrel aged."
"overall: a pretty good beer by central waters. ive never seen this one before, but its definitely worth a try. its got more flavor than most scottish ales ive had before, and its more smooth as well."
