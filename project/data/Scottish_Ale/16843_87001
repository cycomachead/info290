4,15.9,4,4,4,4,4,"O - I like this beer. I had it on tap about a month prior at the brewery and remembered it being a little better, but we'll leave that one for the bottle vs. tap debate. At $7.99 a 4-pack and 6.5% ABV I'll probably seek out other winter warmers that have a little higher alcohol content and come in 6 packs for about the same price (specifically the two mentioned above), but still decently affordable and maybe easier to consume during the day than those other two mentioned. Overall a great beer!","CondorMcBride","Dec 02, 2012"

3.92,13.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 10, 2012"
