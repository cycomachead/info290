"This is a new experience for me. I can't say I've had much Scottish Ale (other than the standard nitro Belhaven can), but after St. Andrews, I'm sure I'll have more. This is a cloudy copper beer with decent head retention. The smell is wonderful - a sweet, flowery honey. The flavor is all about malt, which seems par for course with the style. There's more of a slight tartness than any discernible hop flavor. Honey and malt are predominant. Add some carbonation to that, and you've got a delicious beer. If this were in a nitro can, I'd pass. In the big brown bottle, you can't go wrong, as long as you like the style. I sure do."

"D - do not think I could finish a pint myself. Little disappointed that this beer has sullied the good name of belhaven."

"O - an awesome scotch ale, it has all the requisite characteristics in moderation without being aggressive, very easy drinking, and above all a great tribute to a place I must visit some day"

"a rather tweedy, very dry strong ale, lacking a bit of congeniality ..."

"I'm not upset I bought this one but I doubt I'll buy it again, worth a try but I wouldn't go searching for it"
""
"Overall: While not great, every aspect of the beer is better than average. It is not as complex as I was hoping but then again I do not have much experience with Scottish Ales. The ""smoky"" aftertaste was perhaps the most pleasantly interesting aspect of this brew. It's not world class but I'm glad I had it."
""

"Overall - A nice representation of the Scottish Ale style. Very easy to drink with a nice balance of the earthy/citrusy flavours. Would definitely pick up another in future."

"It lacks balance this. That's not to say it's bad. No. Its actually pretty damn fine in its one, two or maybe three dimensions. But it is such a wasted opportunity. Its very soft brown malty toffee morish quality with just a pinch of earth is pretty close to exceptional but its just too much for me. Needs more structure up and down and more development from beginning to end."
"Overal this is an exceptional Ale and I recomend it to anyone who can get it. I lucked out as the case had been droped and 3 were broken so I got it for a very nice price. This is so tasty I am going to get their Scotish Ale soon."
"This beer poured out as a golden color. Some floaties in there along with a fluffy white head. The smell of the beer was malty, and grainy, along with some toasted nut aromas. The taste of the beer is a little sweet upfront from the grains in it. The aftertaste has a decent bitterness to it. The mouthfeel of this beer is very drinkable and easy to have a few in a short amount of time. Overall I like this beer, I had it once and would be willing to have it again."
"Often this particular style can come off as bland. I was happy to find that this beer is not bland at all. It has a nice strong toasted malt flavor without being too sweet. Moreover, it has considerable body for a beer of this style. The toasty flavors were nicely complemented by a nice, earthy nuttiness and hints of molasses and clover. A nice beer for a cool, rainy afternoon."
"overall; quite good for the style, definitely worth drinking and easy to do such in quantity."
"Dr: Nice, but better Belhaven offerings are available at comparable prices."
"Drinakbility: For a beer dedicated to St. Andrew and the home of golf, this one would be well suited on the links. Easy to drink even if your not carrying a putter around all day. Perfect hot weather or activity beer."
"D- Very easy to drink, nice balance"
"Beer made in the birthplace of golf. Poured in my ""Club America mug"". Look: Dull brown color, no bubbles, like a jar of mud but invites to drink, thick finger of foam, medium lacing. Smell: Toffee malt and citrus hops mixed with earth hops, produces tamarind essence. Taste: Prominent earth hops, tamarind and toffee. Mouthfeel: Dry and fruity, not too sweet, strong body and high carbonation. Drinkability: I guess its my third scotland beer, bittersweet and highly recommended."
"Definately a drinkable and enjoyable beer. But as on caught somewhere between the English Pale and Scottish Ale, the beer has characteristics of both but don't settle the score of either."
"Definitely has a nice light mouth feel, a rusty caramel sweetness, and possibly a bit of vanilla sweetness, has a tartness on the sides of the tongue, and a light smooth mouthfeel."
"Drinkabilitly - This is a unique beer for me. The color was different and the aroma and flavoring were very similar. All in all, I liked the change. Definitely was not what I was expecting when I picked this brew up. I could sit down with this for an evening for sure. For me however, I probably wouldn't drink this two nights in a row. I have a feeling this is an ""old style"" beer. I am glad I tried it."
"D: Nice enough. A good twist/improvement on Belhaven Best. Consumed in St Andrews, lending an appropriateness to its consumption."
"The body is full, wholesome and smooth in the mouthfeel, some might prefer a hop presence, but to me this is a very drinkable beer. I actually bought this in St Andrews, I'm glad I did."
"D: Nice brew to drink by itself, however for the price probably not a session beer. Would recommend for those that like Euro styles for sure."
"D - Easily quaffable and satisfying. Recommended."
"Overall this is a well balanced and fairly mellow beer that is easily sessionable. I would drink this again."
"An nice but not extra-ordinary Scottish ale."
"Updating my rating of this now I've tried the bottled version . On tap this is a mellow rounded ESB with a fair body and bready finish. The bottle version is weaker in character and has a few sharp edges to it. I'll buy it on tap but never as a bottled import. Not worth the price. Downgraded 1.3 on the bolled version"
"A flavorful easy drinker. Very nice."
"body is medium to light. slightly sticky, enjoyable."
"The malt profile ranges from slightly sweet to toast to even a bit of roast. There is almost an oaky wood flavor I am getting for some reason. Pretty basic beer, really. I dont get a whole lot of complexities and the mouthfeel is bordering on watery. Sessionable, but the price tag makes that unreasonable at almost 5 bucks a half liter. This is definitely one of those British beers that need to warm up before enjoying properly. It's a decent pint of ale that is better than your standard British pub taps."
"Final Thoughts: An excellent offering if you want a simple, flavorful and easy to drink beer. As I said, this would be great after a round of golf, as it's refreshing but not at the cost of it's body and flavor. Thumbs up on this one."
"D: The low alcohol and great flavor and low carbonation make this one as drinkable as they come."
"D: This is a nice Scottish overall. I'm very glad I picked it up. The low ABV allows it to go down easy."
"Overall, this is an easy drinking scotch ale with wonderful flavors. On the light side, I think it's what a scotch ale named for a golf course should be. It's light with waves of floral and honey and I have no idea how they got the sandy look to the head but it certainly looks like a St. Andrews sand trap!"
"St. Andrews is believed to be where the first game of golf was played - the beer that bears its name is not the be all and end all of ales but, like the course itself, is the sum of hundreds of years of tried and tested development, nurturing and tradition. I don't know that this ale would be every beer drinker's dream but it's definitely above (err, below) par."
"LCBO acquisition. Pours copper body with some white foamy head that sticks to the glass on the way down. Pleasant mild hoppy aroma. The mouthfeel is a little below average, but it is also very easy drinking. A serviceable ESB. Sourish at the sediment of the bottle."
"D- A standard 80 shilling type ale, a good malt backbone, not overly tasty but certainly wouldnt refuse one. Solid drinkabiliy with an inoffensive flavour profile."
"Drinkability: I enjoy this beer as well-crafted and refreshing. There are a few characteristics of which I just don't happen to be a fan, but that doesn't mean this is a bad beer by any means."
"Bottle 500ml. Pours a copper-golden color with a big fluffy white head. Leaves nice lacing, too. Medium body. Aroma of caramel, some fruits, a little hops but overall very malty. A little sweet and with a spicy aftertaste. Very smooth and drinkable, especially due to the very low carbonation which also makes it appear a bit watery. I've tried this a few times now and would drink it again, really fits my taste."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Poured a clear copper/amber color with a small off-white head that quickly goes to a thin film with minor lacing. I've seen others mention a buttery aroma in their reviews and up till now I have not found that scent in a beer. I get a light buttery toffee aroma, very pleasant. A light toffee sweetness and citrusy flavors. Finishes clean. I really enjoy this ale, would love to find it on tap."
"Drinkability is very good for this is a tasty ale."
"Mouthfeel, I dunno, kind of bland for my tastes. Drinkable enough if the cost wasn't so high."
"An excellent standard in drinking Ale."
"solid across the board beer with neither hop/malt notes being the ""main"" component of the flavor. solid purchase and very sessionable!"
"Feel and Drinkability: This one is medium bodied with delicate and light carbonation. Due to lighter carbonation this one feels smoother and creamier on the palate. Easy enough to drink, but I think I'd have to be in the mood for this beer to go ahead and drink a couple of these in one sitting. This is one rich beer and I'll definitely enjoy the rest of the glass. Nothing to rush out and get but definitely worth a try."
"Not bad at all. Certainly worth a pick up."
"taste is a little watery, peat, caramel, a touch of sour malt, nuts, a little bit of spice, and earth in the back, end is a little on the bitter side."
"Appearance is typical lighter orange-copper. Head and lacing are above average. The nose is sweet caramel, mince meat and minerality. Nice. Taste is sweet and raisiny transitioning into a chalky mineral finish. Finish is clean and dry adding to drinkability. Minimal hops. Mouthfeel is full and round and drinkability is high again due to dry finish. Quite a bit of character here."
"Drinkability: Not the best Scottish ale but certainly nothing to turn your nose up at either. You could do a lot worse. I just feel that this ale doesn’t have quite the character as a lot of other Scottish ales. None the less, still very good and not to be passed up."
"Pours a clear copper with a copious tan head. Nose is nuts, light lemony citrus, hints of grass and some earth. Big caramel and maltiness, light fruit, apple, lemon and hint of butter. Well balanced flavour. Body is smooth but on the light side with a moderate carbonation. Very drinkable, sessionable brew."
"As I finished this one up I couldn't help but think that its no superior to local offerings, but carries a bigger price tag. The carbonation really screws it up, and I would expect more from Belhaven, despite them being a hit-or-miss brewery for me. Score this one a bogey."
"Deep copper in colour, like an old penny. Capped by two fingers foamy off-white head. So-so retention and no lace. Aromas of toasted bread, caramel, & brown sugar. A little bit of apple, and some grass. Toast and caramel on the palate. Slightly buttery. Watered down apple juice. Grassy, herbal finish. Mild bitterness grows a little as it warms. Light-medium body with low carbonation. Smooth and quenching."
"Bottle: Poured a copper color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and very good lacing. Aroma of medium caramel malt with light dry hoppy finish. Taste is a well rounded mix between some hoppy dry English style hops and some timid caramel malt. Body is about average with super great carbonation thought. Not bad and quite drinkable."
"Overall it's a really nice ale with a sizeable amount of flavor for a lower ABV beer, which would make this a preeminently sessionable Scottish ale."
"All in all this was quite nice beer, very sessionable and refreshing if nothing out of the ordinary."
"this beer pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a small white head that recedes to lacing. the aroma brings a nice caramel malt to the nose, with a bit of floral hops. the taste really brings the caramel malt flavor to the front. the full mouthfeel and good co2 make this a pretty tasty drink."
"D - Wonderful depth and complexity, especially given the sub-5% ABV... I could enjoy a couple of these in a sitting and would gladly seek out and purchase again in the future... A tad more sweetness on the palette would have made this a homerun, but otherwise nicely done..."
"D: Very good and it gets better as it warms in the glass."
"I could session this beer. It's got enough going on to keep me interested without being too much on a warm day. It may be a bit much for a lawnmower beer."
"Future outlook: Perfectly decent beer that I would never refuse, though no reason to seek out specifically."
"Drinkability - very drinkable. would make a great session beer."
"D- lighter and easier drinking than other scottish ales i've had, and not quite so intense. still full of flavor and character."
"The taste is quite flavorful. There is plenty of bready sweet malts underneath, there is some honeyed sweetness to the beer, there is some tart apple and roasted caramel tastes, and there is just a touch of some bittering hop more towards the finish to round the beer out. The mouthfeel is not overly creamy or crisp, and the aftertaste is very mild. This is a lighter bodied beer, not watery, with plenty of character that is worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D- This beer has a nice malt flavor with some fruity flavors and a good but subtle depth. The hops are soft in flavor but had a nice bitterness to the finish. This beer is very drinkable and would make a good session beer."
"Conclusion: Finishes just a bit too minerally/hoppy for the style for me; otherwise this is a damn delicious Scottish Ale"
"Overall: I love it! It's a great twist on an old style that Belhaven pulls off well. Just a wonderful way to pay homage to the Home of Golf."
"Drinkability is wonderful the complexity of the flavors and smells keep you guessing and keep you from getting bored."
"Pours a light brown colored body, with a white colored head. Has an IPAish aroma, nice and hoppy. Has a pale taste, very plain, clean, and balanced. This would make a good session beer, not too strong a flavor to get sickening after a while."
"This beer pours a nice burnt orange hue, with lots of thin foamy white head. The smell is very light caramel malt. The taste is sweet biscuity malt, with a small amount of fruity floral hops. The carbonation is mild, and the finish dry. This certainly is an easy drinker, and a decent session ale."
"Overall a nice, flavorful, balanced beer. Solid all around."
"D. Sometimes I wish I grew up a young Scottsman...Outstanding brew here."
"Taste is quite similar to the smell, very good anyway with lots of rosted malts and some notes of pears."
"I did try this again and I liked it much better. Still not great but not bad either. I wonder if the first bottle I tried was just bad. I liked this."
"Poured a copper orange color with lots of carbonation bubbles sticking to the side of the glass. The frothy off-white head stuck around for a minute or two. Aroma is very inviting with apple, pear, and an awesome yeastiness. The taste isn't as fruity and glorious as the incredible aroma but it is nice and earthy. There is a great toastiness to it and great caramel, bread and diacetyl butter flavor. The more I drink the more I taste the yeast! This is one awesome and complex brew. Slightly bitter but mostly malty. The feel is moderate to thin but smooth and wet. A pint is not enough."
"D - Very easy to drink, this is a great one to grab if you're looking to drink a few. The 4.6% will allow you to kick back quite a few with no worries."
"D- Great drinkability and quite sessionable. Could have more dryness and bitterness"
"Belhaven St. Andrews Ale poured a copper color, with a nice tan head, and ok lacing. Smell was good, nice fruit notes. Taste was also very good. sweet, hints of fruit. Good deal of caramel in the taste, slightly smoky. Mouthfeel was good, as was the drinkability. With the 4.6% ABV you can session this beer. Overall a decent Scottish Ale. Nice flavors. A beer that I would buy again."
"I don't mind one or two of the 16.9 oz bottles, but that's enough for me. I could sip on this with some vanilla ice cream though, or heck - make a butterscotch float!"
"D: Tasty basic sessionable beer. Definately buy more."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Bitter."
"D - As are most of the style, this is a great drinking beer. The low ABV is a plus for the style. Though it might be a bit sweet for some, I found this enjoyable and would love to find a sixer of this for a chilly night with friends."
"The St. Andrews Ale pours amber with some copper highlights and nice crisp clarity,the head is tan and creamy it looks a lot like the frothing on a latte,big lacing. The nose is grainy and fresh smelling,with some nice baked bread aromas. Lots of lightly toasted malt flavors,with some caramel apple sweetness. A dry finish lingers and is also creamy and soft,medium body and soft carbonation make for an outstanding ale that is very easy to enjoy ."
"The taste is a nice caramelly-fruity character, juicy with toasted bread, leaves, earth, hint of spcies. It has great sweet-bitter balance with plenty of both, it's zesty and lively, and has a spicey-zesty finish with just a lightly dominant bitterness."
"D: It was an unremarkable Scottish Ale. With so many better in this style I would not seek it out but I also would not turn it away."
"Drinkability: A very nice well balanced ale. Great for sessions with a lower abv."
"Very nice, very drinkable ale. Goes down almost too easy."
"A very unique ale."
"with a stiff infusion of alcohol..."
"drinkability is decent. this brew lacks body for the flavors and aromas present, but remains well proportioned."
"A very nice Scottish Ale. Picked it up at Total Wine in Fort Myers. Served it chilled in a pub glass. Poured a ruby red grapefruit color with a decent white head. Smell was like a fine bourbon, caramel, toffee, marshmellow, with some floral hops in the balance. Taste was heavenly with excellent caramel malt overtones followed by dry fruits and a creamy floral hop finish. Ach, that's some good beer!"
"Outstanding drinkability -- this is up there with Fuller's ESB and regular Belhaven as one of the most perfect session ales you could ask for. Any time of year, any weather -- give me sports on TV and a sixer of this and I'd be perfectly content."
"Very drinkable, next time I'm going to have to buy a few of these so that I can drink more."
"Overall- My favorite from 4 Belhaven offerings I drank 1 afternoon. Excellent session beer, slightly pricy though."
"D - A good, drinkable example of the style. Lots of malt character; not overly complex, but pleasant."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer, though I wouldn't rank it among my favorites. Still, not a bad beer."
"Recommended..."
"Poured into my mug and got a one-finger, frothy head that quelled somewhat; some head stayed with beer. Left a few lace patches to complement a brownish-auburn body that is somewhat seethru. A nice, spicy smell for some reason, not much malt but floral hops abound, and I picked up faint notes of citrus and even berries. I also picked up something like butterscotch, so maybe my nose is out of whack (I swear there's a butteriness in the smell, though). A very hoppy ale, but it is complemented by chocolate and toffee malts and rounded out by caramel. Overall, a well-balanced ale that goes down smooth but has a quasi-dry backbite. This is one of those beers that is not going to be very sought-after, but for how cheap it is and for how good it is (and the fact that I couldn't keep my glass down), this is a must-try and a session beer."
"With it's low ABV, do you think this beer was made to drink while watching a round of golf? I'm not sure, but Belhaven hits a birdie with this beer."
"I tried the Belhaven line on the recommendation of BA member Jims145 and will try others by this brewer!"
"Pours a nice amber color from the bottle with a nice white head that has some lacing to it. It has an aroma of sweet malts and scotch even. The taste is the same. It tastes awesome really. It has a sweet malty base with hints of scotch that I really enjoyed. The taste is very subtle which is nice and it is a really good scottish ale. THe mouthfeel is very good and it is pretty drinkable, especially if you like scotch."
"Not quite as good as its heavier brethren, though, as I like a little more smoky peatiness that the wee heavy has. If you want a nice session scotch ale, though, this one is absolutely awesome."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but a bit lacking in the flavor department"
"Interesting. Pours clear with a deep amber color. There is a lot of sediment floating around. Minimal head with some lacing sticking to the side of the glass as it retreats. The nose is slightly sweet . The flavor is outstanding. Numerous layers on top of each other revealing themselves over time. It starts smooth and sweet and then you get a heartier edge. It never deviates from its path . Mouthfeel is smooth and sweet and the drinkability is high. If this is typical of Scottish Ales, then I am definitely keen to taste others."
"I wouldn't say there is a terrible amount of stuff going on with this beer; maybe a hint of caramel, some hops (?? maybe ??). Good tasting, satisfying, but nothing to go crazy about."
"Medium body, low-to-moderate carbonation. Overall good balance. I would call this a good basic scottish ale. Pleasant, easy to drink, and sessionable."
"The home of Golf. Damn straight!"
"Very good brew,easy to drink and i can consume this all night,highly enjoyable and recommended."
"This is a great Scotish Ale. One of my favorites. I always have some in my fridge, and you should too."
"Not a terrible beer, but not terribly interesting, and too sweet and heavy for more than one bottle. I doubt I'll go back for this."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer, but not an everyday sort of thing in my opinion. It's a nice change up when you need a satisfyingly simple drink, perhaps after cooling off after some physical activity, in my case some ultimate frisbee. The bottle makes it seem like a golf beverage. I wouldn't disagree..."
"Appearance is a murky amber brown with a consistant thin head that leaves a nice lace. Aroma has roasted malts with a slight butter toffee sweetness. Taste has a upfront sweetness with light toasted malts and hops and a creamy medium mouthfeel. A good bodied ale that I could keep drinking, a good one to try."
"-Oelergud"
"Let me start by saying that I have a bias. I like it automatically because it says St. Andrews on it, where I spent several months in college. That said, I do really enjoy this beer. A very solid ale, with the quality I have become used to with Belhaven. It looses points, however, because the beer is completely revealed at the first taste. Many of the best beers seem to give increasingly more to the drinker the longer the liquid is held in the mouth, like a hint of spice, citrus, or what have you. This beer doesn't really, so it won't rank as one of the elite, but it is a solid choice, and worth drinking if you have the chance."
"Not bad, lightly flavored but quaffable bitter-style ale."
"I guess I'm just becoming a jaded American, I just couldn't get in to this beer."
"The taste started caramel sweet, but that was interrupted by a pleasant burst of herbal hops in the middle. The hops stayed subtle, however, and yielded to a sweet finish. Silky body and low carbonation made this one go down easy."
"Pours a very clear and rather bubbly copper. The half-inch of head recedes quickly, leaving a white film and a nice smattering of lace. Quite malty as expected for the style. Biscuits, apricots, and honey with faint peaty smokiness and earth. Flavor leans heavily towards the sweet. Lovely apricot marmalade and honey on medium toast. Finishes slightly drier and herbal. Excellent moderate body is creamy and strongly carbonated at once. Mellow, tasty, and very drinkable."
"Overall, a very solid outing. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to get it, but it's a nice beer."
"Overall - A very good beer... not really your typical Scottish ale - more of a bitter in my view... recommended..."
"This is a great Scottish Ale. At 4.6% ABV, it's perfectly sessionable. Recommended."
"Half-liter brown bottle with no freshness date - it pours orangey-copper with three fingers of fluffy khaki head that leaves nice lacing. Nice nutty/earthy malt aroma at first, but soon I find toasted and sweet malts and notes of caramel apple. The flavor is also quite malty, with notes of caramel, molasses, nutty, and earthy malts, with gentle hops and diacetyl hiding in the background. Its medium body is fairly smooth, drying, with medium carbonation and finish. Overall a tasty Scottish ale, but it would be even better if more robust."
"This beer pours a murky, dishwater brown with a beady white head that leaves plenty of lacing. While the head is nice, the body of this beer is unattractive. Smell is very malty (lots of caramelized notes), with some nice spice, funky herbal hops, and a floral, heathery note. Very nice. On the palate, sharp hops come out first, along with some juicy fruit esters and light, sweet caramel notes. Good acidity towards the end. Pretty unassuming carbonation that lets those sharp, acidic hops dominate. Overall, this is quite good. Excellent session beer. Some complexity, some pleasing flavors, and some characteristics (low alcohol, good acidity, slightly sweet malts) that would help this pair with a multitude of simple meals."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale amber and a cream colored head with fair retention. Heavy caramel and buttery toffee nose back by some notes prune and roasted malt. Roasted malt profile displaying notes of prune, toasted brown sugar, roasted nuts, caramel, dates and a bitter hop balance with herbal notes in the background. Increasing notes of toasted grains and oaky character as it warms. Medium body and carbonation leaves a descent mouthfeel. The finish starts a tad boozy but cleans up quickly leaving some residual nutty, caramel notes."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a nice copper, forming a thick fluffy 1 inch head, that faded very slowly, leaving medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is nice caramel notes, along with a hint of nuts. The taste is just like you would expect from Belhaven. Rich creamy malts, forming a delicious nutty flavor, along with a slight caramel finish. Medium mouthfeel, that finishes smooth. Overall, this is the ideal session ale, IMO. Easy to drink, with a smooth taste. Definitely try this!"
"Poured from a bottle to tumbler at 45 degrees. I guess you can tell I liked this one. Awsome. Nice red/brown color with a thick fluffy white head with tiny bubbles linmped together like a nice tasy biscuit. Flowert biscuity smell with great lacing. Taste was smooth nice nutty caramel taste that hung on your tongue and made you want to take big hits. GREAT beer, I want a case!"
"A very simple, yet elegant, no fuss Scottish ale, non-offensive, a great drinker. Sadly the bottle wasn't big enough."
"A fine beer when bottled; a great beer on cask."
"Pours a clear medium-deep copper, lightening toward the bottom of the glass. Loads of surfacing carbonation and a thick and creamy one-finger head that is retained very well, taking on a billowy texturing. Smell is overwhelmingly malt-dominated. Caramel and butter, woody notes. Some fruitiness and a touch of spicy hops, barely noticeable, linger deep in the background. Taste is better balanced, and not so sweet. Still plenty of caramel, but with a peaty sort of smoke permeating it and taming the sugary character. Diacetyl, to be sure, but in an understated sort of way, and mild spicy hops throughout. Mouthfeel is crisp, but full-bodied, and conducive to a lingering aftertaste, and drinkability is very good. A pleasant Scottish ale, very enjoyable."
"This is the kind of beer I really like. Very distinct tastes, yet smooth. Low carboration and distinct bitterness, makes this one the kind of beer you that works especially well after a couple of pints or at the end of a night out."
"A nice, tasty Scottish ""session"" brew. A nice balance between sweet malt and earthy, bitter hops."
"D - Excellent. This is deep and complex enough to keep me interested, buit balanced and restrained enough to not overpower the senses."
"While I wouldn't consider this a session brew - a bit rich for that, it is still very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I love malty brews like, but I could see the apparent ""heaviness"" getting to you after awhile. Still, if you like the style, great brew."
"This was a very nice beer. Had a nice cirspness and was easy to drink. Had an excellent smell with some apple phenol in it. It also had nice head and retention. The taste was very smooth and fully bodied and had a nice caramel malt profile. A beer to drink at any time of year. It was alot better than bellhaven scottish ale."
"I like this beer a lot. Excellent representation of its style."
"Pours to about an iced tea color with a creamy head and thick clingy lacing. Head retains very well. Smells like opening up a box of buttery shortbread cookies. Intensely malty. Faint smoke in the background. Taste is very malty with a bit of a dried fruit character. The shortbread seems to not be as pronounced in the flavor. On the other had, the smoke seems to be more forward. Slight tartness in the finish. Soft carbonation with a light to moderate body. Not as full as I'd like, but this is still quite nice. This is definately a quaffer that also offers a lot of flavor."
"Try a chaser with this...Highland Park, or Oban...."
"M&D - a little too acrid at first, but an overall nice beer, would make a great session beer"
"Damn near a perfect pour. Head was around an inch thick. Body is a crips golden bronze color that kind of surprised me. I was expecting something darker and leaning more towards amber. Nose is very yeasty, like the smell of a brewpub. I also smell some caramel. A sip reveals more caramel, a bit of butter and some slightly burnt sugar. There's a smatter of hops in the finish. Mouth is medium and smooth. Wow I could definitely session this ... with pleasure."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper color with a small lingering off-white head. It smells like malt and caramel, not much else. It tastes the same way, with a little smoky flavor too. The taste is also sweet and bitter at the same time. The beer has a medium mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation. Body of the beer is medium, and it goes down pretty easy. It's also a bit slick on the tongue. It's not an overpowering beer at all, but it could become a session beer for me. Not a bad beer at all, I'd drink this again."
"This one's for those out there who like a trip to the fringes of flavour country every once in a while. An easy drinker that still gives your palate something to think about. Good to see this back again."
"This is a beer with nice flavours that doesn't require too much attention. A good one for sitting and chatting with friends."
"St. Andrews is a deep and shadowy copper color. The head is tan, unassuming, and unremarkable. Nice aroma: very lightly roasted malt, caramel, a bit of fruit. Not much in the way of hops in the smell, but theres just a fleeting hint of smokiness. The taste is earthy and malty, with less sweetness than the aroma would indicate. The brew has straightforward and uncomplicated flavors, with a lightly bitter finish. Light-boarding on medium mouthfeel. I thought that it could have been a little sweeter. Its uncomplicated, nicely drinkable, and clean."
"Notes: at 4.7% this is a tasty low alcohol choice. I've found scottish ale's in general to be a quality beer style when done right. Look no further than St. Andrews as an excellent example and one to set the bar."
"Pours a light orange color with a small head. Smells of malt with the possiblity of some peated malt. Taste has a smokey peaty taste along with some sweet malt backbone. Hops don't really play a roll in the flavor. Good mouthfeel. If you like peated malt you'll like this."
"Taste: More caramel in the malt, with high carbonation and a touch of peat smoke. Dry but fairly thick finish with a husky note, mild leafy hops round out a decidedly across-the-pond brew."
"Pours a clear dark copper under a one finger off-white head that lingers well despite lots of large bubbles, leaving a few dots of lace. Interesting seemingly cherry nose with malt backing. The mouth is light and well-carbonated. There's a very rich, complex and interesting taste here. Grape and strawberry accent the bready malt in the opening, followed by the very clear and unmistakable peat moss flavor so noticeable in several single malt scotches. There's not much hops here, but the peat provides a good dry background, lingering well into the aftertaste. As it warms, sweet sugary cherry emerges ever stronger. This is a very unusual, very enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability: While the first few sips are very complex and keep me interested, the cumulative effect of all the fruit is actually kind of metallic; by the bottom of the glass it's coming off more as Orange Crush than anything. Next!"
"D - If this is a good indication of Scottish Ales then I think I've found another style I'm fond of. This is a refreshing beer that goes down easy and keeps me wanting more. Unfortunately I can't find the Belhaven St. Andrews locally - I picked this up while on a business trip in Texas. Highly recommended if you want a pleasing introduction to Scottish Ales."
"Taste: the peat flavors really stand out on the initial sips. The sweet caramel malts come out next followed by that smokiness. There's no real hop presence, but none was really expected from this style. With the peat and smokey flavors this has a more unique flavor than I expected. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, with very low carbonation, and is kind of disapointing."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Nicely carbonated, with tiny bubbles that actively showcase the spicy, smoky, malty aspects of the beer. The creamy weight in the mouth is substantial yet effortless, as this drinks beautifully. Very highly recommended."
"Wow so often I only think of Scottish ales as the schilling variety and the wee heavy's but this is something else. A little almost mild ale of near amber golden color with a chunky head. Smells of smokey peated scotch with a gentle under current of sweet malt. Tastes of long boil caramelization with a nice upfront but not overpoaering smokeyness that could come from the way the malt is kilned. The more I drank the better this beer got and it was nice and light which kept the smokeyness from holding to the palate to hard. I would have few in a night but for sure this is a nice thing to throw in the rotation of any beer session."
"Taste was very malty with a nice mellow finish maybe abit smokey. Mouthfeel is a bit slick on the tounge. Smooth and crisp very enjoyable."
"A solid scotch ale, but I think one will do me just fine."
"On-tap at Castle on King in Kitchener, ON. Clear amber with a thin, off-white head. Some lacing was evident and this lasted for some time. Peat smoke aroma with a medicinal character, like an Islay scotch, coupled with mild fruit and malt. Mild, balanced flavour with an emphasis on malt, but hop bitterness definitely kept this in check. Fruity esters rounded the flavour out too. Mellow smokiness lingered in the dry finish. Quite a good beer with enough complexity too keep it interesting throughout a pint (or two)."
"This is an excellent Scottish Ale. Its slightly less smokey than Belhaven Wee Heavy, but just as complex. This was actually the first Scotch Ale I tried, when I was in University. I thought it was so exotic back then. It still rocks."
"An average beer. I was expecting more from the birthplace of golf. But I guess if you master golf, you cant master beers too. Or can you..."
"D: Very drinkable, excellent session beer!"
"The beer pours a nice amber, with a wonderful bit of sediment suspended, and a good white head. It has a good aroma of malt and dark fruit, with a whif of alcohol. This has a fine malt taste. This is a more refined taste than say the Wee Heavy. A very nice medium body with an oily finish. I was quite impressed with this and will find more of it in my refrigerator."
"poured a light copper color with white moderate head tghat proved to be long-lasting, leaving noce lacing on the glass. Smell is toasty and sweet. Notes of caramel also present. Taste is sweet and malty. Can also taste caramel and some smokiness. Some fruitiness also present and gibes a nice well-rounded taste sensation. Finishes malty, but there is also some hop dryness there that complimetns with malts well. A very nice beer thast combines malt and hops in an extraordinary manner. Very easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Nicely drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent tasting beer. One of the best looking beers I have ever seen in my life. The combination of flavors is unique and delicious."
"Very nice."
"Pours a dirty yeasty pint with small head and light lace. Aroma is yeasty and malty with a slight british hop. Flavor is dominated by the british hop flavors and a sweet malty aftertaste to wash it down. Body is thin for this ""small"" beer but very refreshing. A delicious and very drinkable british session beer for one of my favorite scottish brewerys."
"I must admit, given my predisposition to this genre, that I was a wee bit (bad joke) disappointed. It didn't have the range or body of other ales I have had. I'd certainly drink one again if given the chance, but I would buy something else over this either to try or re-enjoy."
"Pours a nice copper brown with a tannish head that soon retreats to leave a nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Very smooth a fair example of the style. Good malty aroma the increases considerably as the beer warms. Fairly mellow maltiness I believe it could stand a bit more for better balance but all in all not a bad drop at all."
"Notes: Pretty good scotch ale, good malt sweetness. Overall has a good balance, but it just leaves you wanting something more."
"Drinkability  This is a nice ale that went down well."
"The beer dispenses the 500ml brown bottle a clear deep brown with a modest sized semi-creamy light tan head that dissolves rather quickly leaving a fine coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt with light hints of peat, fresh and delightful to the senses, start is somewhat sweet with a light malt presence and a fair to middling top. Finish is pleasantly acidic and the hops delicate in their spiciness, quite dry and somewhat tart aftertaste, a nice session beer in my humble opinion."
"Overall, a good drink but it leaves a bit to be desired compared to some of their other brews."
"One of the better Scottish Ales I have enjoyed. Very nice appearance with the light amber color and an off white head. The head started out quite pillowy, later layed down to a laceing. Smell was of a nutty origin, with a malty backbone. Not much in the hops area in this one. It seemed like it was going to be a ""lighter"" tasteing brew, but ended up being good and malty. Very clean taste with a crisp mouthfeel. Definately one of the better Scottish Ales in my eyes."
"St. Andrew's is copper in color with a short head. Aroma isn't very strong. Light malts, a little buttery smell, and some hops. Taste is different from anything I've had before. There are notable tastes of mild nuttiness with some smokiness thrown in. Hops have an herbal quality, plus there is some lingering sweetness in the finish. Complex, but a little odd to me. At first this beer was a little off-putting for me, but I've warmed up to it after half the bottle. Admittedly, Scottish ale isn't a style I have a lot of expirience with. I like this, more interesting than the other Belhaven beers I've had, but still not the one I prefer."
"Overall: Named after the patron Saint of Scotland and the unofficial home of Golf, this is a lovely creation. Had it on cask many times but this was the first time from the bottle, it did not disappoint - well worth trying."
"I have a hard time finding exactly what I don't like about this beer, but I find it the least interesting of the beers sold by Belhaven in the US."
"Not very complex, but a solid and very drinkable Scotch ale. Not much of a malt profile for a Scottish ale, but very likeable."
"Very interesting."
"Not a summer backyard beer, not a thirst quencher, not impressed"
"(500 ml bottle, now available in Norway). Colour is yellowish brown, good thick head. Aroma has first some fruity hops, then dusty malts. Flavour is malty with hints of caramel and dust. There is too much carbonation for my taste. OKish beer, but not remarkable."
"The first putt is a well-struck 25 foot double-breaker that takes a peek at the cup before stopping 6 inches past for an easy tap-in par. Long and not quite lingering, the finish allows the sweetish, flavorful malt to make something of a comeback and leave one with memories of a well-crafted Scottish Ale."
"This is one of the lighter and less malty of the Belhaven's I have tried. The hops really come through on the finish and I would be hard pressed to name this as a Scottish ale in a blind taste test. I detect south of the border Pale Ale tendencies in the profile. This is a full bodied beer that belies its low Alcohol. After a round of golf this would hit the proverbial spot."
"The head is lasting and nicely refined on a dark orange purple color body. The smell is malty, with caramel notes, and grassy; but disappointing, too weak. The taste shows a nice malty character with caramel and enjoyable notes of chocolate. Quite earthy too. The thickness of the hops, combined with some dark chocolate bitterness, circles the mouth, but not aggressively. The mouthfeel gets better as the brew warms, a warming chocolate aspect with hints of coffee. Enjoyable, but not exceptional."
"This clear, dark, red-amber beer sports an inch and a half of almost white, meringue head. Long, thin arcs of lacing. Nose is a little fishy and tangy. Front is smoky, peaty, tangy. Middle brings up some caramel malt. It's thick and sweet with some butter. The peaty tanginess (or is it tangy peatiness) gets an encore in the sourish, almost astringent finish. Interesting, tasty, I like it."
"Not a bad drop, intresting none-the-less."
"very drinkable..nice beer."
"Belhavens St. Andrews is one such ale. It is essentially a pale ale and features a crisp bitter aroma with lager-like properties, a clear copper color, and a tall head of eggshell white froth. The body has gentle contours, nice balance, and the finish is classically bitter. St. Andrews is remarkably easy to drink. It has superb lace and an abundance of character. Everything about this ale is suggestive of sustained reacquaintances."
"Poured this beer from a nice looking bottle. Amber colored liquid with a light brown head. Smell is sweet malt with a hint of hops. The taste makes this one a winner. Its caramel sweet malt is accompanied by roasted graininess. The hop aroma really boosts the flavor in my opinion. This reminds me of Boston Lager in a way but with a more mellow and refined, slightly sweet taste. It might be dry hopped, I don't know but it is very refreshing and tasty."
"Well, not a great beer in my opinion. Just didn't seem right, and far too bitter for a Scottish ale, especially one that's not a Wee Heavy. I gave it a try because I like golf (though I'll never have the single-digit handicap to actually play St. Andrews!), but just don't think I'd have this one again."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Light aroma, a little roasted barley and some caramel. Foamy, yellowish tan head with a bunch of pock marks that holds up pretty well and looks like it wants to cling to the glass (I need to rinse better). Transparent, golden amber color, very fine bubbles floating to the top. Light, clean beer, easy drinking, something in it reminds me of a good lager. The flavor is pale, a bit of caramel, finishes with a pinch of sweet hops. Thanks to my brother for giving me a few from his beers of the month 6er."
"Amber body with a tan head that has good retention and sticks to the sides of the glass nicely. Smell is of dark malts and burn caramel with a strong leafy aroma. Fruit is also detected in the smell along with a pungent smokiness that can not be missed. Taste is of grains, caramel malt, with dark roasted notes throughout. A hearty earthy flavor as well which I do not particularly care for. Sight buttery aftertaste. Light carbonation, smooth, and easy-to-drink with the low ABV, however this brew is noticeably thin mouthfeel wise."
"Very drinkable, yes I will have another one of these!"
"I was not very impressed with this rather one-dimensional pale ale. It poured nicely enough--though a bit musty--and the white fluffy head was inviting. The aroma was tart and lemony, but clearly lurking in there was the smokiness I have come to anticipate from the Scots. Well, that smoked peat flavor came through in the taste, overwhelming just about everything else but the lemons, and I did not find the combination all that compatible or complementary. The more the ale lingered in my taste buds, the stronger the peat. Also, it was very thin."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is of sweet malts and Scottish ale yeast. The taste is decent. It has a malty core of a single malt ale, but it has a smokey finish. It tastes like wood chips or something. Anyway, I'm not sure it's a good taste, but it's certainly different. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer drinks fair. The woody flavor gets annoying quick. It's one and done for me. E for effort."
"This beer poured out a beautifully looking light amber color with a very rocky and creamy head of foam. Looks delicious! The aroma is laced with caramel and smoky malt sweetness and behind that is lurking an earthy and pungent hoppiness. Smokey and grainy tang in the taste that finishes clean. A light and very drinkable ale. The body has some malt but is light overall. Not overly sweet by all means. A nice tasting and flavorful beer."
"Ho-hum..."
"Pale amber color with a decent cream colored head. Earthy notes abound in this light ale; peaty and lightly hopped. Decent malt texture with some tart-like malt acidity in the finish. Once again, earthy. Foamy, creamy and smooth in the mouthfeel. Florally hopped in the finish. Drinkability is high for a malty Scottish ale. I'd like to try this one again."
"Had this one in a 22oz bottle. Pours a light amber color with a thin head that dies off quickly. The aroma is boring as there is a little hopiness and a little malt, but not much else. The first taste is bitter with a hint of smokiness to it and there are some malts that are evident as well. There were also some caramel hints in there. It tastes too watered down. The finish is fairly dry. This is alright for a Scottish Ale, but it's not strong enough."
"A very easy drinker and the mouthfeel is very smooth and easy. It is medium bodied. Overall a simple yet stable ale. This one would go well with a meal."
"Didn't like this beer that much. Don't know if it was a bad bottle or old bottle or what. Could be it was just a bad beer. Medium brown color, small head. Malty and smoky, not very hoppy. Lighter body. Mild taste and flavor. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly malty"
"This beer poured a cloudy brown with a rich robust white head. The aroma was muted but of malt. The taste of the malty sweetness was the crowning achievement of this beer. The sweet stayed on the tongue long after the liquid was swallowed. The hops were not present in either the nose or the tongue. The mouthfeel was somewhat creamy and almost medium. I found this beer very drinkable and liked the strong malt presence."
"Pours a copper, kacki color with a nice thick cream colored head with holes on top. Aromas off the nose of caramel, malt, bread, some floural and peat, with hints of hops. Medium carbonation seems to make the malt, caramel, and slight honey come together with a hint of smoke like a grilled steak. Finishes with a roasted malt/hop bitterness that goes down easy. Great everyday, session beer. I could drink the St. Andrew's or the Scottish Ale anyday of the week, and twice on Sunday."
"Belhaven St. Andrews Ale: “from the home of Golf”: mmmmm, soddy. No, I kid. Nice frothy head, rocky top, nice stickiness as well. Deep amber brew, nice clarity. Aroma, pleasant. WOW, I’ve passed this beer a couple of times, and took no notice of it, but man I made a big mistake. Wonderful smoky/peaty malts balanced by an undercurrent of hops. Longish aftertaste, like a nice scotch whiskey, which should come as no surprise given its country of origin. Extremely smooth, almost silky mouthfeel, extremely drinkable. This is an very flavorful, relatively complex brew. I’m convinced that anyone who likes flavorful beers would find this to be a tremendous session brew. Well worth searching it out. Enjoy."
"Fruity sweet smell with a subtle floral character. Very aromatic and quite complex. Copper orange in color with an off-white head. Very full flavored and well balanced. I was able to get some nuts and very low levels of diacetyl. Drying bitterness came through on the finish. Quite nice."
"Color is a pale amber color that has some gritty, thickness to it and pours with a very nice fluffy tannish head thats about two fingers high and had great staying power. The lace placed huge sheets along the glass. Smells of sweet malt caramel thats sorta earthy and has what I think is a clear, bright hop note in the back. Taste is great, super clean and smooth with nice caramel malt thats sweetly bittering and toasted with nice honey and slightly herbal hops balanced in that give it a very nice complexity and super full and smooth character. This is one spectactular scottich ale, one of my favs from Belhaven, along with the Wee Heavy, and give to you a strong recommendation on picking some up."
"Great bottle and label that took me back to the great buildings standing guard at the shoreline of St. Andrew's and the winds flowing in from the North Sea. Wish I'd had one these on my first visit to the famous birthplace of golf."
"I like this beer a lot more than I like most of my golf scores. St. Andrew's Ale, the beer from the home of golf. It has a wonderful appearance, slightly cloudy with sediment, noticeable chunks floating about this amber/burnt orange hued brew. A large anf fluffy head of bright whiteness greets you. I notice some honeyish flavor on first sip. It's a pleasing flavor along with the caramel malty sweetness. Some hop character is present throughout. This beer is awesome. I really enjoy the dry and crisp hoppy finish too. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a bright reddish amber color with a foamy white head that fades into a fizzy lace. Nose is dominated by caramel with a strong peaty undertone. Medium in body and quite smooth. Taste is earthy with notes of smoked peat followed by some herbal notes and a touch of malt sweetness in the finish. A nice Scottish ale, but nothing special."
"Scotland's oldest brewery - and still independent - established nearly 800 years ago. Brown-amber, thick head. Weird but nice Sam Smith's hop aroma. Medium body, fizzy, lots of caramel. Grassy hop with a good smokey malt flavor. Not much nose upon the first smell, after smelling for a bit could detect a bit of smoke and malt. Can drink plenty of this fine ale."
"Clear dark copper appearance, head is gone as fast as the Road Runner, just a rim with spider tracks on top. Exactly three rings left a trace in the glass. Caramel and apricot to the aroma, smell is very nice. Mediumish body and carbonation, first impression is mildly fruity, some sweet apple combined with dark brown sugar and a floral sense overall. Flattens as the hops balance and finishes with the slightest astringency. Not big and sticky, this Ale is an easy-going drinker."
"An awesome well rounded beer from Belhaven. This beer has it a from its beautiful copper amber color with great head retention to the final drop. You won't be disatisfied. A full body beer with a great balance of malt and hops."
"OK - this is much better than the Belhaven Scottish Ale. This one picks up where the creamy ale leaves off by adding color and hops. There is still the creamy texture but the hops cuts that so the mouthfeel is not as silky. But the added hops allows you to taste this beer. It is far more enjoyable in bouquet and taste and texture. I highly recommend this one."
"Actually, I may have gotten an old 6-pack, since this was hidden away on a dusty shelf in a wine shop that does very little to sell their beer. Maybe a fresher bottle would change my opionion."
"Another nice beer from Belhaven. A bit lighter in color than the average Scottish offering, it was a medium copper. Head was tan and persistent, lacing was similar to this breweries Wee Heavy, it was prominent from mid glass on down. I detected some roasted nuttiness which was very tasty. A solid winter beer. I enjoyed this with a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich on a cold gray day."
"Another top notch brew from Belhaven, this is every bit as good as their regular Scottish Ale. This is a nuttier, dryer, and maybe milder beer. Amber with persistent head, lots of grassy aromas and flavors, some traces of smoke as you dig further in, and up-front big nutty brown ale flavors. Not especially bitter and a wet finish, perhaps a spikier hop element would work here, but then again it is a pretty complex beer and each sip gives me a different impression. A step away from Scottish ale into the Brown ale direction, but still plenty of grassy and smoky flavors. Cold-cut sandwich pairing suggestion is dead-on. I imagine a lot of golf players drink Bud or Coors Light after a game, which is downright insulting when a beer like this is available."
"Wow really liked the earthy undertones to this beer.I love to drink a good scottish ale like this when nice and cold outside.Had some nutty qualities to it really liked this beer and will get it again."
"I liked this better than by drinking companion BigEmail.  The appearance was amber with a short-lived head that left excellent lacing.  As with BigE, the aroma and flavor to me were both malt.  I did not notice the nut flavors or mustiness that others have, but I will revisit this to try to discover some of the nuances.  A highly drinkable beer."
"The label says, ""The Home of Golf.""  I love it! That is a genius way to win beer converts, IMO."
"Pours a tea color with a very small head.  The smell is great with notes of roasted caramel sweetness.  The taste is a malted roast with an aftertaste of musty socks?!?!  Taste almost nothing like the smell has you thinking it will.  Kind of like talking to someone on the phone and then meeting them later...they never look like what you thought.  This a light-bodied beer, kind of watery.  After smelling with high expectations, I was actually disappointed in this one. Sorry to be the wrench in the gears.  Cheers!"
"I would certainly buy this beer again."
"Hazy light brown in color with a fairly thin head.  The aroma is quite appertizing and is comprised of nutty, bready and sweet crystal malt notes.  There's just a hint of earthy hop nose, but I wouldn't of noticed it if I weren't looking for it.  The carbonation is perfect, being low enough to provide for a smooth mouthfeel, but high enough to help carry the malt flavors.  Caramelized wort flavors (from perhaps an extended boil?) are accompanied by delicious nutty malt notes and barely balancing hop foundation.  St. Andrews finishes w/ a slight roasted malt bitterness.  Wow.  For a beer this light, it is highly flavorful. An absolutely ideal session beer."
"Notes: Well balanced and quite drinkable, does not rock the boat yet play well with mixing malt and hop flavours. This would pair well with a smoked turkey sandwich on sour-dough bread."
"Another Belhaven classic and like the Scottish classics, it's often imitated but never equaled. Malty sweet without being overtly so, with the perfect hop balance. Just a touch of alcohol warms the back of the throat. A true pleasure to drink."
"Rich and malty, giving way to a pleasant tartness.  Hops tended to be more acidic than bitter.  A good choice with a coldcut sandwich."
