Taste is pretty bland, not much malt presence for the style, some toast/bisciut, almost has a slight sourness to it. Mouthfeel is thin and the carbonation level leaves the mouth dry.

I do pick up malt and a very slight smoky / peaty flavor but very little overall. The Mouthfeel is very light with moderate carbonation.

Enough hops to balance, but not enough to compete with the sweetness or the prominant smoky character. Lightly phenolic (plastic and smoke) with a big bruised apple flavor and quite yeasty. Finishes mostly crisp, with a linger of the apple, fruity flavors.

Maybe a caramel color is a better way of saying it. Mine are out of date as they say drink by 10/12/07 or something like that. Maybe that's why the head is a bit weaker than I remember. Tis a good beer to be sure. I like the malty profile with the sweet butterscotch finish. I remember reading somewhere that this beer goes good with barbecue chicken, Jolly Ho! I believe whoever said that was on to something. One must sip this beer to enjoy it. I plan on getting some of these for next Summer when I fire up the grill and smoke some leg-quarters.

A not unpleasant brew this Burning Skye Scottish Style Scottish Style Ale from Empyrean Brewing Co. but its not blowing up my skirt either because in my humble opinion... this is no Scottish Style Ale.","BeerBob","Aug 31, 2005"

3.2,-8.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Sampled from bottle, traded with bditty187 from NE. Pours a clear copper with a collared white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is very subtle with just a hint of crystal malt and a floral/candy sweetness. Flavor is semi-sweet, smokey with a small floral, pine and spice hop flavor addition. Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. An interesting interpretation of the style.","Bdc","Dec 20, 2004"
3.83,9.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy deep apricot color with two fingers of head that die off quickly. There is no lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty. Some orange and white grape aromas. A little bit of a yeasty character as well. The taste is also sweet and fruity. Pear and grape flavors and a little bit of caramel sweetness. Certainly doesn't taste like a Scottish Ale. The mouthfeel is just a little watered down. The drinkability is good though. A good beer, but definately not a Scottish Ale.","SheepNutz","Sep 03, 2004"

3.98,14,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A rough pour brings up a good sized head of frothy off-white foam. It drops shortly to a half inch or so, but holds well from that point on and leaves some minor lace. The amber body is just slightly hazy, and fine bubbles can be seen slowly rising towards the surface. A touch of smoke and a gently toasty malt are present in the nose. The smokiness is far from overwhelming, and accentuates the malt nicely. The body is medium, and the soft carbonation gently caresses the tongue - it's smooth and lightly creamy across the palate. A softly sweet and mildly biscuity/toasty malt carries through the majority of the flavor, only truly revealing it's subtly smoky side in the finish. Well balanced. Well brewed. Satisfying and very drinkable!","NeroFiddled","May 28, 2003"

3.45,-1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a medium amber color with a thin and creamy white head that quickly fades into a collar of lace. Nose is sweet with notes of dark malts and honey. Light to medium in body and thinner than I was expecting. Taste is sweet toasted malts and grains blended some notes of honey followed by some mildly bitter hops, but the sweetness wins out. Not great but certainly something Id drink again if I had the opportunity. Thanks to bditty187 for the sample!","Morris729","Apr 15, 2003"
3.57,2.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear coppery-bronze hue, slight tawny influences too, it is a pleasant color but I cant help but think it is going to be thin tasting. This is not a good first impression. A very hard pour is required to produce a head of a finger in height; it faded quickly to a very sparse soapy collar. Subsequent lacing was absent. This is my number one grievance with Empyrean, the head retention of all of their core beers are lousy! The nose is unique with a mix of chocolate malt, honey-like sweetness, and a trace of faint hops spice. The potency is very limited; it seems more inadequate on this sample that I am reviewing than others Ive had over the years. Ill still review it, as I smell it. The palate reminds of an Oktoberfest-style lager with smoked peat/barley and chocolate malts added, the hoppiness is a little strong for a Scottish Ale, which this beer is trying to be. On the other hand the maltiness is a touch thin. But with both of those negatives stated I find Burning Skye to be a tasty beverage, it works well with BBQ. It is on the simple side but I find it tasty. Medium in body, the carbonation is low and typical for the brewery. It is also plenty drinkable. It is a solid offering from Empyrean and a beer worth trying if you are visiting the Cornhusker state.","bditty187","Aug 11, 2002"
