"I remember having a few of cans Newcastle Brown Ale a few weeks back. This is what I find this beer is very similar to."

"An easy drinking tasty scotch ale, doesn't try to be anything its not, and balanced quite well. Lacks a bit in body."

"O: Very drinkable. Recommended."

"and a decent mouthfeel makes a right little treat on a cold friday night"
"I quite like this one, a good show for the malts, without getting too sweet. Good drinkability."

"O - Given the style, it could easily have used a bit of a flavour boost. Too mild for my liking and by no means better than average for the style."
"taste is nice and similar to the smell with the malt, bitterness but also some sweetness and roastiness. overall pretty easy going, but you still get some nice flavours each sip - solid offering."
"Final Grade: 3.89, a B+."

"A highly drinkable ale with an undemanding but moreish flavour. The sweetness, grainy notes and mild bitterness all blend perfectly to create a pleasing beer. Well worth sampling if you encounter it."
"better luck next time caledonian...luckily i have a fresh weihenstephaner"
"Caledonian 80/- should be exactly what you think of when you close your eyes and imagine a Scottish ale. It has a distinctive peaty character that portrays the true charm of Scotland, something that North American (or English) brewers are simply incapable of capturing. It certainly earns a spot alongside haggis in the Scots' gastronomic highlight reel."
"D - Nothing seriously deep or interesting about this, but it's easy to drink and quite flavourful. The smokiness is what really dominates the taste, making it somewhat difficult to get down quickly, but the sweetness backing it up is a good balance. Not bad, not amazing, I'd drink it if someone offered it."
"One of the better examples of the style."
"May it always be brewed in direct flame open fire kettles in Slateford."
"D- Very drinkable, but nothing special. Tastes just like a standard Scottish Ale, almost like a Red Ale to me."
"This is successfully malt-dominant without being overly sweet. That being said, while an enjoyable beer, more than one would probably be too much. Would have enjoyed more fruity hoppiness, which would've definitely helped its drinkability for me."
"Surprised at how good this one was, I want more, one can isn't enough. Quite sessionable I must say."
"Pours a amber colour with thin head with a small amount of lacing on some parts of the glass. Smells of caramel and bread with maybe the faintest hint of hops. Small bitterness, but more sweetness comes through in the flavour. Fairly thin mouthfeel. I would like to try this on cask as I suspect it would be much better."
"Drink - A nice well rounded beer that has a little of everything. The richness of a dark beer, but the refreshing aspect of a light beer."
"Pours a nice rich and clear orange-red with a moderate head, but no lacing. Very enjoyable aroma with notes of caramel, toffee and bread. Taste has many of the same notes, but it seems thin at times, almost watery. No substantial bitterness nor hop aroma. The thinness is the only drawback to the beer, killing the mouthfeel. Nevertheless, an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"This is amazing. A great cask offering. One of the best Scottish Ales I have come across. There is really no smoky peat character, but what is here is really unique. A perfect example of a Scottish brewery pushing the bounderies. Highly recommended to say the least."
"Pleasant enough drinking, if not exceptional. Only the faintest of aromas, not the best in that department. Flavour is chiefly sweet and malty. Nicely carbonated. Pretty much no bitterness at all. Good session beer, but prefer Deuchars IPA from this brewery. Would like to try on tap and have spotted it somewhere, so may report back..."
"D: Drinks very nicely, would be a good session beer."
"Definitely a good choice, certainly better than the Tennent's that started the night."
"Caledonian 80/- pours a bright amber with a nice lingering layer of head. The aroma is malty and fruity, with some caramel, toffee and butterscotch. The flavor is nice and malty and a bit sweet without being cloying. There is a bit of ripe dark fruit, and some darker crystal toasted sweetness. Some light buttery diacetyl comes through in the end. The finish is crisp and almost heavy, very flavorful for a beer of it's strength."
"A decent enough session ale, but a bit on the sweet, non-bitter side for me, though."
"D- Okay light body beer. Nothing memorable."
"Aroma is faint, but there is malt, woodsmoke and barley. Colour is a gorgeous brown/gold colour. Taste is malt with a woodsmoke aftertaste. Great mouthfeel and good balance. Funny that they call this a bitter since there is very little bitter taste to it."
"Overall, this was definitely a better experience than what I had on tap, but I certainly would still maintain that this beer is mediocre at best. Try it if you must, but I wouldn't recommend it."
"It's drinkable enough I suppose but not one I'd seek out again any time soon."
"Mouthfeel - thin / watery and smooth. Low carbonation and quite refreshing. Slightly course in the finish."
"Yes definitely drinkable but not great will try again though"
"It is really too sweet and malty. I rarely leave beer behind, and had to force myself to finish this one. But, the same brewery makes Deuchars, which is delightful."
"M/D: The beer had a medium body to it, the carbonation was not noticeable, due to the cask, very smooth, creamy and one could drink this all day long. Overall, a good beer and one that I will try again when given the chance."
"I had the Neustadt earlier in the evening, and although this is the higher regarded beer, I preferred the local to this. Still, its a decent ale, and should be a must for lovers of the Scottish styles."
"Altogether a well-made, tasty beer."
"High drinkability. Would love to try again from a different serving type."
"Final Thoughts - All in all, this beer is better then average and enough off the beaten path to make it an import worth buying. It does some things right, and other things wrong but the pros outweigh the cons. I probably wouldn't get it again unless it was offered or was the only option, but for the most part it was a solid offering. If you like this, I'd suggest Newcastle Brown Ale."
"Drinkability - definitely a great choice. Lots of flavour and low ABV make it a great beer to keep coming back to."
"Pours a really nice deep amber with a two finger creamy white head. Smell is malty sweet with some chocolate and biscuit. Taste is very sweet, but the chocolate becomes much less prominent. A slight hop finish balances this one out really nicely. The mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth and the drinkability is excellent. This beer seems like a heavier one despite its low alcohol content. Overall, a really great brew and would love to have another."
"Super smooth and velvety mouthfeel. Perfect cask ale. Easy to drink and enjoy several, just don't go looking for a lot of complexity."
"There is a difference between the cask version of this ale and the bottled one. The cask version is a bit sweeter and smoother than the botteled beer."
"This is a good beer, pretty textbook for a scottish beer."
"Note: Recently had this on tap, and it was highly inferior to both the cask and bottled versions...Much thinner, without the great flavours...."
"I realize I'm out of the mold on this one. Lets hope the next reviewer loves the style and gets you back on track."
"Impressed, this is good and an ideal winter drinking beer, even at the low 4.1%, it punches well above its alcohol weight."
"Tastes of buttery caramel popcorn (in a good way), sweet malts and a bit of bitterness in the finish."
"Tha hop presence is just enough to make you not call this ale to malty-sweet. A rather delicious ale to complement fish and chips."
"Palate has great roasted malt character (coffee), herbal hoppiness, supremely well balanced and sessionable. Much better on tap than from the can."
"Tastes of deliciously sweet, milky cream malt, smooth, with hints of hoppy bitterness near the end. Dryish finish, but not overpowering. Medium bodied, mildly carbonated, smooth as all get out. Hugely drinkable. Fantastic Scottish ale."
"I tried this beer on November 3, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a very nice translucent red into the glass with a small white head. The aroma was a combination malt, hops, and nuts. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, mild carbonation, and creamy. The flavour is malt, nuts, and a slight hint of hops detectable by a slight bitterness."
"One of the gold standards of the style."
"A fine example of an Scottish ale."
"Here is a well crafted scottish brew, I found this quite appealing. Copper red and clear in the glass with a blonde creamy head. Somewhat effervescent throughout. The nose was a good sweet malt. Mouthfeel was good. A tart malt flavour with a hint of strawberry in the finish which kind of mellowed the beer."
"Easy to drink; eventful is all I can say. More and more, it will be the same. Another round for me and boys would be nice?"
"All in all, a nice ale."
"A clear, copper colour with an off-white or cream coloured head about a half inch initially, reduced in time to a lacy film that coated the glass nicely. Even when almost finished, a swish of the glass brought back a frothy top. Moderate carbonation throughout with a mild watermelon or cantaloupe aroma, just a touch of floral boquet happening here. The taste is dry with balanced bitterness and a hoppy character, smooth texture and a modest, malty aftertaste. I found this a wee bit gassy but still a most enjoyable ale that is welcome in my refrigerator anytime."
"Highly recommended."
"D: a classic scottish session ale."
"Pours a medium-light copper tone with a very tight nitro head which leaves thick walls of lace all down the glass. Smell is distinctly muted, the nitro really taking a toll here. Light caramel malts show, along with a minor hop note. You can tell that there's more to be had here, but the format just won't let it come through. Taste is better, deep caramel is at the forefront with roasted grains and just a touch of coffee as well. Light hop notes in the finish, with a bit of scotch as well. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but has plenty of body, and drinkability is quite good. Not bad, but I'd much rather get it without the nitro to see what it really ought to taste like."
"A nice drinkable ale. Caledonian Brewery is always pretty reliable."
"Alot of my buddies drink this beer straight from the can. So have I, and decided to give it a proper review. Pours from the can a deep, rich amber with about a two finger head. The head ever so slowly disipates, leaving a small amount of lace. Herbal hop scent upfront, with some malt, toffee and caramel lingering in the nose. Taste is light and sweet. Some toffee and caramel candy, slight bready taste, and enough grassy and herbal bitterness to make it refreshing. Bes of all, this is a smooth beer. It's almost like drinking homogenized milk smooth. Creamy, delicious, full body and nice. Very drinkable, both as a session beer and as a complex beer as well. Overall, delicious."
"Final Statement: A Scotish take on an Irish cream ale? Lackluster. Looks good, but has little flavour. Stick to Kilkenny."
"Pours a clear coppery red with an expansive tightly packed off-white head that is here to say for the night. The aroma is lots of malt, some toffee, and a bit of wood and smoke. Finally, after months upon months of hoppy beer madness (which I definitely love), it is nice to finally have a malty scotch ale to welcome the fall. Sweet malty front, getting plesantly woody and Fruity (mainly raisins) in the middle, with some mild hops and raisins creeping in at the end. Mouthfeel was smooth and somewhat thin, and not cloyingly sticky. I am looking forward to the fall, and hope to try more fine ales like this."
"Other comments: I was surprised at how crisp and hoppy this beer is(relatively speaking for a Scotch ale). It's good, don't get me wrong, I was just expecting it to be more malt heavy. Deuchars IPA is still my favorite of their range and one of my top UK beers."
"Canned sample. Dark amber / light brown in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of mild fruit, minerals, and a bit of chocolate. More mild fruit in the mouth along with notes of roasted malt, a bit of caramel, and some interesting fruity-earthy hop combo. Medium body. An above average canned bitter. A nice surprise from the Kenora LCBO."
"The taste is truly great, very easy to drink with a great combination of roast malt with a hint of caramel, sometimes bordering to a very slight hint of chocolate. Once swallowed this leaves a suttle refreshing hint of citrus. Not too heavy that it can't be drunk all night, but meaty enough to enjoy just a couple of. Excellent both on tap or in the bottle. One of the best beers in Scotland."
"Overall - An OK good beer... There's just something missing from this one - probably still worth a try though...."
"This isn't really my style of beer. It's a nice deep caramel colour and pours with a thin, quick to vanish, head.It's very malty and sweet. It starts off with some interesting flavours but leaves too much sugar in the rinse. Still it's pretty good for out of can. This isn't a completely fair trial though since I did eat a fresh basil leaf earlier which is going to throw the taste off."
"Pretty damn good. A nice change of Scottish beers for me because I'm so used to drinking Wee Heavies."
"Can: Poured a deep amber color ale with a foamy slightly off-white head with good retention. Aroma of sweet malt is really enjoyable. Good caramel malt presence is also easily noticeable and very enjoyable. Subtle bitter hops closing are also nice. Tasted more like a Scottish ale but then Im no expert with the English style of beer."
"A very well put together ale just made for sessions."
"Pours a clear orange/red, small and loose white head forms, little spotty lacing, some retention. Smell is sweet and malty, brown sugar, peat, and caramel. Taste is sweet, grassy peat smoked middle, some smoky caramel in the finish, a nice nuttiness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Tons of flavour for the ABV and a bargain at just over $2 for a pint can. I think this will be my session beer of choice from now on. Had it on nitro tap once, and the can is much better."
"D: Session this!"
"copper appearance with nice head, lots of lace. Fresh shipment at LCBO. Easy drink, muted peaty scottish taste. Creamy, lots of malt and caramel leaving a sweetish aftertaste. Not too much depth of character but will take over a Molson any day or night."
"All i have to say is, get this. you won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Good. Easy to drink, and not at all heavy."
"This is a great Scottish ale, especially on tap. Its redolent with many malt flavors. Try it if you ever make your way to the Angel Inn."
"I love the way these cans pour. Poured a hazy, browninh-amber liquid with Creamy tannish head. Smell is a delightful combination of toasted malt, dark fruits (dates, plums, cherries), and a strong whiskey scent. Taste is also superb, with a goodly amount of toasted malt and caramel combining with an almost milk-like creaminess. It almost feels as if each taste is giving me a milk moustache. More caramel in the finish, which is very pleasant. An excellent easy-drinking beer."
"If you see a can, buy it. You will not be disappointed as it truly is the closest you'll get to a REAL Scottish pint even though you're 5 hours behind the pubs in Alba. And it comes in a can."
"M&D: smoothness resulting from the good structure between maltiness and (restrained) bitterness is clearly felt deep down the palate, while the freshness of this beer's condition makes it consistently lively on the tongue. Overall a delicious malty bitter at such low alc. strength and a rare treat on cask deep down south in London rather than up north in Edinburgh... it could even be a good session beer~~"
"Poured a deep rich amber color with a thinner slightly off white head,sweet malt dominated aromas but that was expected,caramel and cherry with maybe a little brown suger thrown in.Mild but flavorful in my opinion caramely sweet and nicely toasted grain but some herbal/minty hop comes thru in the finsh adding to the drinkablity of this nice little ale.A real session ale here something that could be drank all night socializing."
"Overall: As one of locals in the Pub retorted ""Tasty stuff that Eight Bob", and it sure was a real pleasure to cross its path again. A solid performance from this Cask Ale. Recommended - well at least if you dont mind the maltier Scotch beers that is."
"Quite nice really. A dark reddish amber brew with a soft head of light khaki foam. Aromas are of sweet caramel malts, a bit of booze, some scotch undertones, and faint (near dead) hops. The taste is sweet and boozy up front with soem nice hints of scotch flavor, and caramel malts in the middle. The finish is sweet, with some toffee flavors in there as well. Mouthfeel is nice for a cask brew, pretty full bodied, and the drinkability is good as well. A nice scotch ale on cask in it's homeland ;-)"
"A good but not great beer"
"Quite a good scottish ale, not too sweet, quite well balanced overall"
"Clear coppery amber with an extremely dense tan head. Excellent head retention that leaves a very thick lace on the sides of the glass. Very clean, mild malty and nutty aroma with noticeable toffee and very light hops. Caramel, toffee, and toasted malts are well balanced by bitterness that lasts throught the finish. Some grain character comes through in the flavour and contributes to the dry finish. The low carbonation lets the silky smoothness shine through. Medium to light body. Highly drinkable, especially on nitro-tap. A truly great session beer."
"Mouthfeel is decent, and it drinks brilliantly."
"I'm usually not much for nitro cans, but I thought this stuff was great. The four pack was gone in one sitting. Incredibly smooth and creamy, without the characteristic nitro metallic flavor. It didn't seem deadened out from the nitrogen, either. This is one of those beers where I can't help but take long pulls from the glass, draining it way too quickly to properly savor, without another immediately after. Excellent."
"This 80 shilling scottish ale is a real treat whether in a can on tap.It pours a lovely copper brown with a slight head.A nice caramel aroma that carries on thru the taste as well.Goes down smooth and its hard to believe the ABV is only 4.1-a lot of flavor for such a small beer.Overall a great session beer-you could drink a lot of this from those great ""imperial pint"" glasses you get in Scotland.Between this,Mcewens Export and Tennents Special-the ""average man's"" Scottish beers are hard to beat."
"I tried this ale on tap at a hotel bar in Paris. There was no indication on the tap where it was from, so I assumed it to be French or maybe Spanish. Upon the first gulp, however, the unmistakable Scottish Ale peaty flavor shined through. The barmaid didnt know where it was from, so I took my notes and looked it up on the net when I got home. Ah ha! Scotland! This gave me a boost in confidence that I was beginning to understand small nuances in beer styles. Miles and miles to go, but this beer sampling is a never-ending quest! Dull amber with a creamy off-white  not overly carbonated head. Sweet malt, tea and dried peat aroma. Thin herbal malt and tea like bitter hops and a lime finish. Interesting! BTW - I think 801 is an area code, though I'm not sure about that."
"Not really that good, very creamy palate, with a soft butter-toffee flavour, very light and an extremely short finish. A tiny bit peaty aswell. In the end though, a bit thin and slightly sweet, not my type of beer."
"My tasting was a draught pint can with a widget ball, which obscured some of the ale's flavor.  Much lighter than I expected of an 80/-, but, again, some of that may have been the nitrogen infusion.  Very smooth, with some grape notes emerging from the malt."
"Notes: I never knew a beer in a can could be so damn good? A very toasty beer, and a lovely light Scottish Ale. I'll have another please."
