"An enjoyable, tasty Scottish Ale that is easy drinking and approachable."

"Or maybe this is an edgier Oktoberfest with a whiff of wood smoke. Whatever this is, it's really quite drinkable. Actually, this is ideal mixed 50/50 with a sweeter and heavier Scottish Ale, like the one I have a growler of from Kulshan in Bellingham. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Market of Choice on 29th in Eugene."

"The body was probably just a wee bit thinner than typical for the style, just a bit more than medium. Drinkability was nice and smooth, but the lack of character reminds me why 12oz servings are better than these big bottles. Overall, not a bad beer, by any means, but also not one worth going out of your way for. Worth trying if you see it."
"O- A good example of the style, very easy to drink. Great session beer with all the flavors you want from a Scottish Ale"

"Pours a copper color, just like a penny. Is very transparent. A small white head recedes quickly leaving no lace on glass. Buttery, musty and woodsy aromas. Very malty, mild sweetness with a mild hop spice at the end. It has a slick body thats lightly carbonated. Subtle raisin or dark fruit in the finish. Very mild beer. Kind of rich, no smokiness. Easy to drink but not exciting or flavorfull at all. A bit boring."

"Overall a very drinkable, mild bodied scottish ale. I prefer a little more smoke in my scottish ales, but this was well balanced example of the style."

"Overall: I think this beer is a good example of the style, but the flavors that come to the fore just don't suit my palate. Like I said, worth a try if you are into the style."
"Overall not bad, but nothing too memorable, the mouthfeel doesn't seem to hold up the flavor well enough."
"O-pretty good scottish the is well crafted"
"O: Not as sweet as most which I appreciate. Not a bad drinking beer at all. Seek out if a fan of the style."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It was cheap, flavorful and low in ABV so you could session it if necessary. Not mind-blowing, but not every beer has to be; just a super solid American take on the style."
""
""
"O: Average and probably would not go back to this one again. My least favorite Pelican beer so far."

"Dr- a very enjoyable drinkable beer"

"nice delicate notes of nuts and caramel were mixed and intertwined with a deeply rooted grain filled back. This was a malt monster for sure as the only thing that was easily picked up through all this was the dark roasted malts that made up the majority of it. nice bit of caramel and sweetness right from the start and this really never faded as any other flavors that were here simply mingled and swirled around this. There were hints of roasted nuts as well as a nice bit of overt grassy notes"

"A disappointment."
"O: So far I've been disappointed with Pelican beers that aren't barleywines."
"Mouthfeel: High carbonation gives deceptively large body though the flavor is so light that once the carbonation subsides the beer is revealed to be light and sessionable."
"Nicely done, this bottle could easily be finished by a single person, and leave them thirsty for more."
"The nose is potent and is just as grainy as it is sweet. Herbal and earthy hop notes peek through. It's a rather thickish brew with a certain creaminess in spite of the substantial bitter streak running through it. Throw in a fair amount of carbonation and this is a brew that goes down quite easily. Caramel, burnt brown sugar and cereal grains are prominently featured, while hints of molasses and white chocolate appear nown and again. Earthy hops linger in the finish. While it's not boozy at all, it drinks ""bigger"" than you'd expect from a 5% beer. Well done."
"(D)- A solid scotch ale with some classic flavors. Nothing over the top or too strong; a great sessionable brew for the style"
"Overall, this is a decent example of a Scottish Style ale. Perhaps it could use a touch more in the flavor profile. I'm glad it doesn't have that metallic/tinniness that many other Scottish Ales have. The fruitiness isn't too assertive and is actually well balanced. All in all, not a mindblowing in-your-face beer, but a good sessionable brew that can fit many occasions."
"The acid balance on this beer is off and, when combined with the fine stingy carbonation, really detracts from the flavor experience. After swirling to release most of the carb, the malt is a little bit smokey, but comes across more as dry wood instead."
"Decent carbonation, though at times a little light and watery. Nice, but at times comes off as underdone and too sweet."
"Somewhat drinkable beer, but just doesn't offer enough taste or a pleasing enough mouthfeel to compete with others of this style that I've really enjoyed."
"D: Low ABV and very drinkable but not very tasty or interesting. Maybe a good lawnmower beer or golf beer."
"D: It goes down pretty easily. Nice little quasi-session beer."
"Just, not very good."
" Palate is mildly sweet up front, with good fruity notes on the swallow. Mild hops offer some balance, leading to a mellow finish with just a hint of astringency. Notes of clover honey, leather, and a touch of stone fruit. Body is fairly light and smooth, appropriate for a Scottish ale. An easy drinking ale, this is one of my favorite offerings from Pelican."
"Tasty, drinkable, well made."
"D - Drinkable, but not very exciting."
"Pours a nice copper and mahagony wood stain color. Not much in the way of head and foam, but decent bubbling. Very bready aroma, with some sweet pecans and a hint of gummi. Toasty and super sweet malts upfront, just a splash of hops give this scotc ale a light earthy aire. Some candy notes in the middl with just caramel grins through the finish. This palate starts light syrup and finishes medium husk. Ok drinkability, just a bit too sweet for my taste."
"Drinkability: Lacks some of the peaty complexity I was expecting, but otherwise pleasant enough"
"Drinkability: Not really all that enjoyable or special. As is my experience with other beers of the style, it is pretty easy to drink, but this beer just does not have enough unique characteristics to warrant a spot in my regular rotation."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"d: Not at all offensive, just bland."
"Drinkability is good, this goes down very easily, a nice, traditional scotch ale, the low abv and relatively big flavors are a wining combonation. I can't believe I sat on this bottle for so long, I wish I had another!"
"Nice brew!"
"Flavors pretty much mirror the aroma, with a slight salt-and-smoke accent that usually comes up in this style, but these are very subtle back-notes, and unfortunately the body is a bit too thin to carry them through as they should be. Definitely thinner in comparison to the on-tap version I had. I tasted this first on-tap at the brewery/brewpub. It was much better then. I wonder if it's been sitting in the bottle too long? I bought it from the cooler at Pelican on Oct. 1. Of course, no date on the bottle...still a fine brew though, just not what I expected after the robust fresh version I had that night."
"Dry-hopping with Centennial hops gives the cask-conditioned version of MacPelicans Scottish Ale an incessant greenness which burdens much of the underlying ale with a vegetal quality. Thats too bad because the MacPelican of course deserves no concealment. The dark bronze body is silken textured and delivers striated lace. But the late infusion of hops is not very Scottish and only conflicts the taste. My advice: save dry-hopping for the IPA."
"D: Average Scottish Ale, pretty easy drinking however. I expected more flavor from this beer."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for sharing. Clear brownish-orange color with a thin off-white head that disappears pretty quickly. Thin coating of lace on the glass. Toasted malt aroma with a little bit of sweet fruit. Medium, smooth body with a malty flavor. Touches of hops and fruit as well. The flavors dont stay firm for very long though. The finish shows a little more hoppiness. Overall this beer doesnt have the legs I was expecting but it is still an easy to drink Scottish Ale."
"Mohogany colored with a thin head that disappears quickly. Smell of caramel and malts. Taste of grain, malts with only a slight evidence of alchohol, having a light - medium mouthfeel. A light, creamy and smooth ale that goes down easily, a good drinker, but the lacking body needed. Makes for a good darker summer ale."
"Drinkability was only average. I wanted more from this beer as I have had lots of success with other Pelican brews. The Doryman was outstanding and was hoping this would fall behind it."
"Very drinkable and a very pleasant and smooth scottish ale."
"Pours a copper colour that has a nice bready, malty taste. this is not a real heavy malty bomb but rather a well balanced version of the style. very drinkable and very smooth on the finish. another nice beer from these guys. goes well with BBQ on the grill."
"Drinkability: I, personally, could not drink very many of these simply because I don't like the finish. However, I can see how it could be an enjoyable beer for many people."
"very drinkable stuff on tap..this must have been fresh..great Scottish ""export"" style beer."
"A very clear copper and not too much head. A small amount of sediment at the bottom makes for a hazier second pour from the bomber. The aroma is vaguely reminiscent of metallic lagers, not really distinctive or inviting. Broad, sturdy malts lead the way with elements of caramel, butter, bread crust. There's not much of the usual shortbread flavors one can often find in a Scottish-style ale. Some nutty elements and very slight toffee. The hoppiness is appropriately muted, not really grassy, a bit more citric like Pac NW beers; it's scarcely noticeable other than to give the malts a slight tweak. The beer can at times seem watery but never unpleasant. Eventually, a Scottish malt quality reveals itself, deep down, but it only shows itself intermittently. At other times, this beer oddly resembles a copper lager, as the Munich malts take the reins. Again, this is lacking many of the more familiar Scottish qualities, but it will serve nicely as a regular session ale, one with a reasonably sweet malt background and thin, refreshing mouthfeel. It's also not as cloying as many Scottish-style ales, so the drinkability is good. Perhaps it is wrong to consider it a Scottish-style ale at all, maybe better to think of it as your standard American micro amber. It's a step up from the Cream Ale and will not alienate those who dislike Pelican's intimidatingly hoppy IPA. I can imagine how good it would be through a handpump, although I preferred it on the colder side of cellar temp. I'll venture to say this is Pelican's best regular bottled beer for session drinking (unless you're a stout fan) and it should go very well with most pub-style fare, esp. burgers and such."
"When it's cask-conditioned, this ale is a special treat."
"Medium amber color, medium head. A light bodied Scottish style ale. Slightly roasted malts and slightly spicy hops. Nice mild malty flavor. Smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet. Etched/Painted Beer bottle."
"Quite a rich copper color, a thin head, and equally thin aroma. There's hints of malt, but no hop aroma worth mentioning. This carries over into the beer, as its mostly a nice combination of malts, and a somewhat unique combination. The creamy pour and smooth body aren't quite there and the beer is somewhat transparent in flavor, and a quick dry finish. With no bitterness to start or finish, it a somewhat incomplete beer."
