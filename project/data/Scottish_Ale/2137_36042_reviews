"Overall:  This a decent American made ESB, but not a great one.  Nice flavors of malt and sweetness and some nicely balanced hops, but there are better ESBs out there.  A good quaff, but forgettable."

"Pours a clear dark brown with a small beige head. Aroma and Taste is sweet toasted caramel malt, a bit of chocolate notes with some molasses with a mild bitter ending. A medium body, moderate carbonation. Overall nothing really outstanding but still a solid brew"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell has some malts and alcohol. Taste is dominated by alcohol, a bit of malts, very boozy and unbalanced. Feels light in the mouth and overall not terrible, but a bit to strong alcohol taste for my liking."

"O - my overall is higher than any of the original ratings because I felt this was a very nicely balanced beer"
"Overall, it's a pricey and decent ale. I probably would not get it again."
""
"To be fair, this was a bit strong, but perfect for the style. By the end of the bottle, I could certainly feel the alcohol and it went well with the slight earthy hoppiness that was present after each sip. While this felt more like an ESB than a Scottish Ale to me, I enjoyed it a lot and felt like it could match up with anything else currently on the shelf. Regardless of style, this was quite a pleasant surprise."

"This beer seems to have a lot going on at once. Rather than being layered and moving from one profile to the next, it seems the sweetness from the malts, the bitterness, and the perceived alcohol all seem to strike simultaneously. Finishes bitter as being an ESB would suggest. Feels a bit lighter in the mouth than I was expecting given the style and abv. Overall, a well crafted offering from Breckenridge."

"Notes: Decent Scottish ale and a bit better than I expected. It's good, but the finish is a little too much with the hops. There is a nice biscuity/herbal/spice flavor that is tasty and enjoyable, but it just doesn't quite reach that upper echelon. Worth a go (especially when on sale like I got it) but it's not going to become a staple in my fridge."
"Picked up a couple bombers of this one at a local store. Poured from the bottle a clear reddish-orange color, with just a bit of spongy, khaki foam on top. Aromas of toffee, floral hops and bready malt. Medium bodied, with flavors of toffee, hops and caramel."
"Poured in a pilsner glass ""Erdinger"". Look: Brown woody color, very bright, fat and creamy head. Smell: Floral and pine hops, lots of wood and malt. Taste: Earth hops, wood, mixed with nutty malt. Mouthfeel: Very woody and extra bitter, creamy and viscous body, little carbonation. Drinkability: Good amount of alcohol hidden by amazing layers of hops and malt."
"Overall/notes: I though I bought 3 ESBs this year... I got one ESB, an American Brown Ale, and a Scottish Ale. Anyways, the beer itself is pretty damn good. It lacks the sophistication needed to be a really good brew, but it tasted better as it went on. Give it a whirl if you can find it."
"D - Pretty drinkable Scottish ale, it wasn't easy to finish this brew but glad I tried it. I wouldn't seek this brew out again even if it wasn't retired"
"D- I was surprised at how quickly this ale of elevated ABV went down. The alcohol actually fades as the beer warms"
"D: Hard to put the drinkability any more than this, since, while it tastes good, the amount of sugar simply put hampers the drinkability, almost making it barleywine like. Good beer all around. They call it a Scottish Ale, it really shares nothing with that style, think Imperial ESB, maybe old ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Poured copper chestnut, with very little head and spotty lacing. Smelled of heather and malt; very one-dimensional. Unfortunately the flavor was the same, with some hint of peat, but overpoweringly malty. Very thin, and over-carbonated, especially for the style. Not a fan."
"Pours a deep mahogany brown with strong ruby highlights when held up to the light. Light beige head forms nicely leaves fine speckled lacing behind. Aromatics offer up some nice earthy hop accents amongst a nice brown ale/nutty slightly smokey malt backbone. Impressive to find this in West Virginia, all I saw was the ESB I wasn't paying attention to the Extra. Not so much an ESB I'd say Scottish ale is definitely more appropriate if I had to slap a label on this one. They did away with the 471 no it's just their Breckenridge symbol. I had a nice meal with some good beer about six years ago at the LoDo brewpub across from Coors Field. Slightly tart semi sour malt, a bit astringent with dark tea tannins. Nutty dark malt semi bitter finish, tea leaf, tobacco, and earthy smoked peat malts pave the way in this Extra ESB. Mouthfeel is bit thin I could use more body to match up to the bold flavors but it makes it drink pretty easily, mild carbonation. Drinkability is solid I wsa surprised by the alcohol by volume it doesn't seem like a 7.8% abv brew but it's a start for getting WV folk into these types of brews."
"Pours a great deep burnished copper color with some nice initial head, a bit of lasting head, but very little lacing. Nice malty scent, very deep, with hints of peat. Excellent taste, a very thick and rich, deep and malty flavor; hints of caramel and peat; the slightest hop undertone at the end to help with balance. Goes down very smooth for such a strong beer. Wonderful!"
"scottish ale, imperial esb, or whatever this is supposed to be....this is good stuff!"
"Toasted malt aroma flows from a light brown brew. Medium carbonation levels help spread the toasted maltyness around the palate. There is only slight bitterness to it with the flavor of fresh piney hops. The finish is smooth and malty sweet and ends with a nice but subtle warming sensation."
"Bottom Line: This mostly what I expected from an ESB. It is pretty good, and it is probably the best beer I have had from Breckenridge Brewery."
"Overall, I wouldn't qualify as an ESB and I wouldn't drink it eiter. Not a great effort overall."
"Overall this was a good ESB although I'm a bit curious as to how fresh it was. Still, either way it's worth a shot."
"About half way through the glass, the odd aromas faded into a light mineral note (thus the bump in ""smell"" score), and this became an even better beer. I enjoyed drinking this beer. Very full-flavor and bodied, and something a little different than I've encountered in a while."
"D. This is a unique beer. It might be best described as a Double ESB. As such it is hard to compare to anything else. It is a good beer."
"Extra ESB is only the second Breckenridge beer to earn a flavor score of 4.0 from the likes of me. The brewery needs to do a better job of defining this offering for would-be buyers, but the contents of the bottle are fine just the way they are."
"Not what I was expecting from an ESB. Maybe they were aiming for an Imperial ESB, overall a decent beer."
"Poured a reddish brown with a modest head that quickly faded to a collar. The aroma was malty sweet. The taste was also malty as in caramel with a citrus aftertaste that came through more as it warmed. The feel was surprisingly full bodied with light, but adequate carbonation. Drinkability was good."
"A big American take on a big English style. I think it works pretty well and is interesting and tasty for what it is. It's not something I could drink all night (like a regular ESB), but is something I would enjoy again and would recommend to others."
"A 12 ounce silk screened bottle poured into a shaker glass. The ale appears a deep copper color with about two fingers of lingering off white foam. Nose and flavor are of toasted bread grain, fruity, sweet malt, earthy hops, slightly nutty. Decent body and ample carbonation. Worth trying if you stumble upon a bottle."
"D: the alcoholic aftertaste makes this a little harder to drink, but i personally think this is a pretty good beer."
"D: Nothing to write home about here. It's a decent beer but I won't be re-visiting it."
"D - Not my style (and I thought this was supposed to be an ESB??). I'm glad I tried it but I'll probably pass on this one in the future."
"Pours a chestnut reddish brown colored body, with a big foamy, frothy off-white head, somewhat lasting. English maltiness in the aroma. Some bitterness too, citrusy. Earthy. Earthy taste, some slight bitterness. Malty sweet. Pretty tasty brew."
"Nice beer and one I enjoyed. I would say this does drink and feel like an English beer. Clearly that was their goal, so I say they achieved it."
"*note - well, on their website, they do indeed say this is a scottish ale. interesting... http://www.breckbrew.com/beer/smallbatch.html#ESB"
"Drinkability: Eh, not so impressive. Overall just okay."
"12oz - Pours a cloudy amber-brown with excessive debris and sediment floating throughout - maybe should have carefully decanted, but wasn't expecting it. Too late to go back now. Decent off-white head with retention that leaves a nice lacing. Aromas are earthy, sweet, caramel, toffee, with a slight pine and citrus hop background. Mouth-feel is medium and slightly thicker than expected - debris is unnoticeable. Coats the palate fairly well with a mild oily hop resin. Flavors are also very earthy - it's sweet right off the bat and the alcohol is definitely present, but is quickly held in check by some bold overtones - caramel, toffee, more hop presence than expected, it's piny with some hints of grapefruit which adds to a nice balanced bitterness. Overall, this was an enjoyable American version of an Extra Special Bitter, or as they call it Extra ESB - extra alcohol? Imperial ESB? Name fits as is. Try it if you get the chance."
"I love this stuff. I admit my experience with the style is limited to this beer, but I think this would hold its own against all comers. I keep this in my regular rotation."
"The taste reminds me a little of rum and raisin toffee with a hint of bitterness. I've never been a fan of rum but I'm enjoying this beer. There's a very slight bitter finish to this beer. Personally I like a bit more but that doesn't detract from it. It's still very pleasant and drinkable."
"Notes - I drank one from the six-pack every couple of months to see how it aged, and this is the last one. I let this one sit too long. I'll have to amend my review when I get a fresh sample."
"D - This was a very enjoyable beer thats very easy to drink with a nice balanced taste worth trying sometime"
"OK drinkable."
"Notes from 9/19/07"
"Pours a deep amber color with a decent sized off white head. The aroma in medium sweet caramel malt, nuts and earthy hops. The flavor leans more toward the bitter side although there is a good malt presence. Medium bodied, creamy texture. Long bitter finish."
"D: For a style that doesn't normally inspire (unless on cask or in the proper setting, like London) this is very enjoyable. Generally clean, I guess the hops are lending that metallic taste that started me out. Solid brew and worth a shot."
"D: This is definitely a sipping beer, not sessionable. Good brew overall and I look foward to trying other ESBs."
"D- if it wasnt this potent it would be a great session beer. very refreshing and easy to drink. the alcohol is well hidden."
"Deep reddish brown with a creamy tan head that leaves nice lace on the glass. Good fresh roasted caramel malt aroma, faint grassy hops. Tastes like I think an ESB should, big and malty sweetness balanced with a fresh floral hop bite and warming alcohol that lingers on the finish. Medium bodied mouthfeel and highly drinkable. Well made."
"D: Nice nightcap beer. Too powerful for me to want more than one. I didn't like this beer at first, but it slowly grew on me."
"Opinion: I got this beer at the recommendation of a good friend of mine that has a very sensitive palate. I was hesitant to get an ESB as I normally don't care for this style. I guess this one is true to form as I don't really care for this beer either. I am not saying that is because it is a bad beer. I have never really had an ESB that I liked, and this is no exception. I guess that makes it applicable to the style."
"This is a bit on the sweet side, but is still quite enjoyable. Could use some more toasted malt and hops for balance, but still a beer worth trying. I was surprised when I finished this review and noticed that the abv is 7.8% - it doesn't feel that strong."
"M/D - slight hop aftertaste"
"Not a bad ESB, but one I find a bit typical. Something I would not hesitate to drink again though."
"Chewy mouthfeel and very dry aftertaste for the style. Overall, definitely a decent beer, but somewhat over-hopped for the style and not quite the ""truly authentic ESB"" the label on the bottle advertises."
"Beer poured a dark amber with a little bit of frothy head. Nose is quite lively, malty, piney, and a bit citrusy. Taste is fairly balanced. It is quite malty up front, dominated by the crystal malts, finishing with a piney/citrus hop. Mouthfeel is full and it is quite smooth for the style. Drinkability is good. There was a hint of alcohol warming with the initial sips. The brew glides nicely across the palate making this quite easy drinking despite the higher abv."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light beige head over the slightly cloudy reddish amber brew. Head dwindles at normal pace, with average to good lacing. Aroma is hearty grain husks and hints of sour. Taste hits fast with the deep hearty grain character, goes a bit sour in the middle, and closes with some muddy hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is quashed by the off aftertaste, and drinkability is really not that exciting. A disappointment for me here."
"whatever the answers, i enjoyed this beer and am sad it is a limited batch release."
"Pretty well balanced beer as an ESB should be. Nice herbal and spicy hoppiness that doesn't over power with more caramel and toasted malt in there as well. I like this beer a lot. nice mouthfeel, medium-full, smooth mouthfeel. Goes down easy."
"D - This was very enjoyable drink. As it warms the flavors really come out. I enjoyed every bit of it and will look forward to drinking the other five in the six pack."
"Bottle from West Point Market in Akron. This beer pours a clear deep amber color with a medium thick and fluffy off-white head that has decent retention. Thin sheet of lacing on the glass. Earthy malt and sweet caramel along with a bit of floral hops in the nose. Medium, smooth body with rich and sweet malt and toffee flavors backed up by floral hops and spices. Hops bitterness begins to assert itself a bit more as it warms, as does the alcohol. The finish retains the sweet malt and caramel base, and leaves a lingering hops aftertaste. Overall this is a fairly sound ESB across the board."
"D - Good drinkability one or two at a time. Flavorful beer"
"In one word, Awful. Woulda much rather had the Sapporo I threw out before this. Pour is a nice dark maroon, clear, and the positives end there. Unique, malty licorice like, very belgiany smell for some reason. Oh and lots of alcohol. Taste is like a dark belgian, but with a load of alcohol ruining what pleasant qualities lots find in the aforementioned part. Metal, some light bitterness and the drinkability on this is horrendous. Couldn't stomach more than about 3 ounces. One-of-a-kind, and thank god for that..."
"The mouthfeel is good. Obviously thicker than your regular ESB, but I like a full body. Just a lightly crisp carbonation. A good balance of sweet and bitter, though I would like to see more of a balance between aroma and flavor hops on top of that. Afterall, the aroma is very good and hoppy, but it tastes more like a malt bomb. It would definitely be much more drinkable if it were built more like a traditional ESB."
"D - This is one of the better American ESB's that I've had. It packs a pretty good punch."
"I would drink a sixer of this, and I would probably go back for more."
"Overall, this is a great old ale--up there with GD Hibernation and Dry Dock HMS Bounty as one of the best of this style in Colorado. Search it out, sip it, enjoy it; just don't expect an ESB!"
"a shock brew from this brewery that has never wow'ed me, well, this beer is a saving grace and honestly, a pure joy to drink!"
"Pours a ruddy ruby, nonexistant bubbles and head. Great aroma though. Lots of deep malts, with some concentrated fruit cup aromas, peaches, pears, black cherries. Stats with bread, then goes to a hot, syrupy fruit. The alcohol sticks out quite a bit in this beer. Even when its straight from the fridge. A bit hard to drink from the burn of alcohol. Lasts a little to long to want another one."
"Pours a clean deep copper with hints of orange in the color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, a mix of citrusy and piney hops. In the taste, a sweet malt and lots of piney hops. A smooth and very small bite in the mouthfeel and sweet piney hops in the aftertaste. Hoppy more than bitter, almost IPA-ish more than a bitter."
"My pint was served with a thick, dense cap of dark beige foam covering the clear, deep amber (nearly chestnut) brew. It had impressive head retention and produced thick, solid lacing. The aroma was mostly caramel and citrus, with some earthy malt and fruity esters in the background. It had an earthy bitterness with notes of grass and delicate citrus hops, some toasty and caramel malt, along with some fruit character and hint of alcohol. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, light warmth and a good texture. Very tasty stuff. It just seemed like the balance was off a bit, maybe due to the increased abv, but it was still a very enjoyable pint."
"Drinkability - it's a swell brew, though rather unsessionable for an ESB. ABV and hop level are a little high, but I enjoyed the bottle just the same."
"Sharp, with an herbal hop character at times and at other the thick, chewy, deeply caramelized, but not sweet malt takes over. I can't quite decide if this beer is very well balanced or not quite balanced. The malt and hop character are about equal, but some how they do not mesh together quite as smoothly as they should. Still this is a tasty beer worth trying."
"Pours a clear very garnet hue. Nose is like alcohol notes and yeast. Flavor is bitter, but the alcohol takes over and wrestles control. Feel is sticky on the liquid and the carbonation is low. This is a mediocre ESB, IMO. Too hot from the alcohol and definitely not balanced. Nice to try. Moving on."
"drinkable??: eh, kinda. just dont read the lable. it is to hop hopped to be very drinkable."
"I love this beer -- it tastes like a hoppier version of an ESB. It may not be perfectly to style but it is still excellent. An ESB with a twist."
"Mouthfeel is good, medium-to-light bodied, tingles to the taste buds. Easy to drink. Next one will be tried at cellar temperature, Like it!"
"It pours a deep copper color approaching a rich mahogany color. Very thin head that quickly dissipated. The beer does leave small bits of lacing on the glass as well. I smell a great deal of caramel going on in the beer with a blast of hops I wasn't really expecting. I like that though. Toasted malt also makes an appearance about half way down the beer. A very nice balanced flavor of hops and malt. The hops take stage first but the sweetness of the caramel flavors tones it down quite a bit. Toasted malt really comes to life as well on the finish. This is much more in your face than other ESB's I've tried. The mouthfeel is actually quite nice and full. Low carbination with a nice bite both on the front and back of the palate. Very drinkable, but personally it would not make a good session beer for me."
"Drinks alright, but the hotness never completely fades. Will sit on my remaining 4 for a few months & see if this evens/smooths out"
"The beer emerges from the 12-ounce bottle a luminous brown, the head large and a creamy light tan, as it fades away, the lacing provides a thin veil upon the glass. Nose has a rich malt sweetness, caramel and Â“ La Touche FinaleÂ”, a hint of floral spiciness. Start is nicely malted, sweet with a hop bite at the back, top is moderate in feel. Finish continues the malty sweetness, the acidity peaceful. As it warms to the glass and room, the hops really Â“POPÂ” out, a bit of a Â“RogueÂ” as ESBÂ’s go, but I like it."
"Quite a nice ESB this brew. A worthy offering from Breckenridge; I would most definitely get it again, given the chance."
"A unique ESB but not what I was expecting."
"We had this at a beer tasting of a wide range of American, English and European beers of all styles. This was the standout for use - meaning it was one the one that best fit our tastes. Deep copper brown colour with a modest lacing (it had been open a while). Pungent aroma, hoppy and warm caramel, mouth-filling and chewy. Being a Londoner, I always associate ESB with Fullers, but this is a lot more concentrated and alcoholic. The former is for quaffing; the latter is for sipping."
"D: This is a beer that keeps getting better as you drink it and as it warms in your glass. I wasn't expecting this much goodness from an ESB, but I guess I've never had a good ESB. Try one of these on for size, it fits quite nicely!"
"D- This beer has a big and bitter hop flavor that overpowers much of the malt flavor. I think this beer might improve with age as the pure bitterness might die down a bit."
"Very nice ESB I must say. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"The taste lingers for good easy drinking. Overall, not a bad beer."
"I am most impressed, I only grabbed one for a sample, but I damn well will return for a sixer."
"I can tell you that it is not a standard ESB. It has too much malt to be considered an ESB but the malt does an excellent job of balancing the bitterness of the hops. On the whole, I find this to be one of the best balanced beers I have had in recent memory. Highly drinkable but at close to 8.0% alcohol you need to watch yourself :-)"
"Pours out like iced tea with no bubble action and a thin frothed milk head that doesn't do much. Leaves some decent lacing, though. Smell is sweet, heavily toasted, citrusy and piney frmo the hops, and has a medicinal cherry cough syrup aspect. This tastes rather messy with it starting off really sweet with an odd and certainly out of place banana flavor. The esters in this one are weird. Finishes with a bit of citrus and pine and with an assertive bitterness. Very mild acidic edge in the finish as well. Warms the throat with alcohol. Mouthfeel is nearly flat with a light yet slick body. Not a fan of this."
"I was given a 12 oz. bottle of this by my very good friend kboett77. Poured that beautiful ESB color - a solid reddish-copper with a light white head. Smells and tastes of toasted barley, nuts, good dowse of piny hops. Nice, clean finish. Lingering aftertaste of the hops. Not a strong beer, but nicely balanced. Moderate mouthfeel, appropriate to the style - not too watery or too thick. A very drinkable beer, quite delicious, you could have a handful of these in a row. Will remember this as a strong ESB."
"Cheers!"
"Wow, this one was quite overwhelming to me. Nice ruby color on the pour and that is about where it ends. All I can say is..alcohol, alcohol, and more alcohol..on the nose, the tongue, everywhere. Tastes way too strong..dominated the flavor. I feel a little cherry and maybe plum and alcohol. Tough to rate this one.too much to rate."
"Dark red, almost brown. Smell was malty and just ok. The taste was more malt, some caramel, no hops that I could find but the alcohol was certainly there. Mouthfeel was a little thick. This beer was alright but I think if it had a lower ABV it would be much better because I could drink more than one and the mouthfeel would be thinner."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, herbal, with caramel breaking through to keep this well done beer in check."
"Not quite quentessential of English ESB's, but good beer at any rate. A solidly malty base with a hearty toasty, brown ale-like body and taste, but swamped with citrusy hops. The nose delivers a surprisingly out-of-style American hop aroma, and a non-surprising Colorado beer-making attitude. Flavors are round of moderately toasted malts, leaving a bit of toffee and caramel, to add character to the moderate malt taste and body. Finishes clean and lightly, minty-dry due to hops and assertive alcohols. Good beer, but if you want a true ESB, then go with an English brewery."
"Overall this ESB isn't my mug o' beer. Its too big and boisterous for me to really enjoy it. The flavors never seem to meld. I'm glad I tried it nonetheless."
"<p>Pours up dark copper with ruby highlights. The head is thick and dissipates slowly, leaving a thin foam on the top. Hops dominate the aroma. I don't mean that they are overpowering, but that the hops are what you smell. And they dominate the flavor, too. There's a hint of roasted malt, but the hops overwhelm everything, including the alcohol. It's way to much for me to drink more than one or two at a time. I bought it in the summer, so it's going to have to wait till fall arrives. It's a nice sipping beer."
"Overall impression: You definitely have to appreciate hops to enjoy this beer - but if you do it is nicely drinkable, and dangerous considering the ABV."
"This beer just doesn't work for me."
"Unusual flavors apparent, nothing mixes well, I won't get this again."
"The mouthfeel is great here, very clean and refreshing which makes for a great session beer. Needs to be just a bit more flavorfull though."
"Overall: Probably one of the most friendly beers I've ever had."
"Rich full phat mouthfeel. A finish to contend with. Overall a damn good beer, but it's so big I'm not sure I would want too drink more than 10;)"
"Growler from Party Source in Bellevue, Kentucky. Hazy, dark amber in color, with some copper highlights. Thin white head disappears quickly. Bready malt aroma. Slight citrus and floral notes in the background. Caramel and toffee notes, as well as a bit of fruit. Great malt character, balanced well with some floral hops that seem to linger, and fade into herbal and piney flavors. Great body, with a lower amount of carbonation. Pretty strong for the style. Finishes with a bit of fruit. Big, but easy to drink and enjoyable."
