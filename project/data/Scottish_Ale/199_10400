3.31,-8.6,4.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall, a rather disappointing beer. It lacks the depth and complexity of a malt-centric Scottish style, being generally weak and unimpressive overall. No, I wasn't looking for a heavyier Scotch ale styling here, but I did expect a richer feel and presence overall. The flavors and mouthfeel come across weak-kneed and insipid, with little malt boldness within the taste or feel. A relatively surprising dud from Ballast Point...","beergoot","Mar 20, 2015"

3.73,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"a fine tasting example of the style, but its the feel that throws me a little on this one. cool to have a beer from these guys thats neither hoppy or real dark and intense, seems those make it to the market less. this looks thin for what it is, more caramel than brown in color, but with a nice inch of khaki creamy head on top of it, quite clear too. the nose is fine, a touch of peaty smoke and molasses sweetness under a drying european style yeast strain. the flavor matches the nose almost exactly, but add just a dab of vanilla, and an unexpected hop bitterness like green tea on the back end. its not as heavy on the smoke and roasty malts as the style usually is, which is fine, but the feel being so light i think is a turn off. i need a little more meat to these, and while i like the idea of a session type scottish, it just doesnt really pan out here. still, the quality of the beer is enormously high, like all ballast stuff, and i like the unique mellowness of the malt bill. cool beer, but i prefer their hoppy stuff quite a bit more.","StonedTrippin","Mar 10, 2015"

There are light notes of caramel and toffee...  Lots of bready malts...  Just a slight whiff of peat...  Simple and straight forward...  The palate is rather uneventful...  Some dark bread malts...  A hint of brown sugar...  Perhaps some peat...  Not much else...  Very understated in terms of overall flavor profile...  On the lighter side of medium bodied...  A bit thin and slightly watery...  Limited carbonation...  Goes down easy enough, but highly uneventful...  A simple but unspectacular Scottish Ale...  Not bad, but aside form a stellar appearance there isn't much to experience or remember here...

3.78,4.4,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/24/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good Scottish ale style. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Beers"

Subtle dark fruits and a touch of some roasted caramel malts. Taste has tons of caramel sweetness, with notes close to that of some Scottish tablet. Very light on the tongue and leaves a bit of body behind. Carbonation is a little on the lower side. The smell definitely compliments the subtle roasted malts and dark fruits. Overall, I was really excited to try it and I'm glad I did! It's a solid, very drinkable Scottish style ale that won't leave you feeling overly imbibed or full.

Smell is of toasted malt and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good but straightforward and simple beer.","UCLABrewN84","May 01, 2012"

3.75,3.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: This was a fairly decent beer and would be a good starter beer for someone looking to try out Scottish ales. I say that because the flavors of these types of beers can be a bit overwhelming, so the tame flavors would be a good segue.","womencantsail","Jul 30, 2009"

3.93,8.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Nose is up front with caramel malt and butterscotch flavors. It gives a sense of an upcoming sweetness that never materializes. A bit of alcohol can be found on the nose as well as the tongue. Taste is similar to the nose and offers a very long finish on the malt. Flavors of butterscotch segue to a somewhat spicy finish, with a hint of pepper, cinnamon and brown sugar. Offers a very nice feel, partly I would assume from the style, and partly from the beer engine. Drink is good and would be higher if not for the ABV.","HalfFull","Sep 30, 2007"

Very slight notes of carmel on the nose, but not much aroma. Seems to open up a bit, as it warms. Overall a good scotch ale that I will drink again.","BrewBakerE","Beers"
