3.26,-8.2,4,3,3,3,4,"Light brown copper with big tan head.  Aroma is lightly roasted malt and some brown sugar.  Body is light, very light caramel sweetness.  Slightly acidic hop flavor at the end.  Like an apple pie without the apple pie spices.","Maxbier","Mar 31, 2015"

3.62,2,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Poured a reddish brown body with an aroma that was rather low-key and somewhat disappointing with minimal sweet and bread malts and hardly any dark fruits at all. Beer is smooth and easy to drink, light bodied for style, like the hop crispness on backend and this beer isn't bad but it isn't great, either. Has a little bit of sweet malt and dark fruit taste but for most part they are subdued flavors that don't really grab my attention.","clayrock81","May 26, 2014"

This is much of the same. It's a decent brew, but a bit dull. I wouldn't seek it out, personally.","ThisWangsChung","Apr 25, 2014"

3.82,7.6,3.75,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Poured a cloudy deep brown with reddish tint. There's about a finger of creamy light tan head that doesn't last too long, but does linger on and leaves a wee bit of lacing. The aroma is pretty mild, with just some slight malt hints but nothing definitive. The flavor makes up for it, though. There's a robust roasted malt flavor with some nice dark caramel and little earthy hops on the finish. It's got a nice full fulling on the palate and a little bit of carbonation. Overall, a good to very good Scottish ale.","delta490","0"

Though the hops are ever so alightly sensed on the nose you don't really catch them on the tongue. This would pare well with a good burger.","xylomaniac","Jun 20, 2013"

The flavor was pretty enjoyable, containing a good level of sweetness that didn't reach the point of being cloying. While this probably isn't a must-have for me, I do appreciate trying new Virginia seasonal brews, especially in a style that's less prevalent like this offering.","TechTriumph","May 24, 2012"

3.61,1.7,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"o - Overall a decent beer from Port City. Not my favorite of their seasonals, as I found the nose a bit bland, but the taste made up for it. Nice fruity taste, probably wouldn't pick up a 6er of this one but worth checking out once or twice. I'd rank this slightly below Tidings in terms of liking their seasonal beers, with their Oktoberfest being the best by far.","mdfb79","Mar 25, 2012"

3.78,6.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"O: A decent Scottish Ale here. Very light-drinking for the style, but the malt profile could use a little bit more depth and complexity. Definitely one to try, but not one I would want to have multiples of in a sitting. This would be a great six-pack to bring along to a party where you are looking to introduce folks to craft beer.","siege06nd","Mar 16, 2012"
