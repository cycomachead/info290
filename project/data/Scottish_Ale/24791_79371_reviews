"Light brown copper with big tan head.  Aroma is lightly roasted malt and some brown sugar.  Body is light, very light caramel sweetness.  Slightly acidic hop flavor at the end.  Like an apple pie without the apple pie spices."

"Overall:  Damn good beer!  Tons of malt which I’m a big fan of.  Malt fans will love this beer!!  I’d certainly get it again!!"

"Poured a reddish brown body with an aroma that was rather low-key and somewhat disappointing with minimal sweet and bread malts and hardly any dark fruits at all. Beer is smooth and easy to drink, light bodied for style, like the hop crispness on backend and this beer isn't bad but it isn't great, either. Has a little bit of sweet malt and dark fruit taste but for most part they are subdued flavors that don't really grab my attention."

"O: Port City's beers (barring their damn good porter) always seem to be somewhat forgettable - there's nothing wrong with any of them, they're just usually devoid of excitement. This is much of the same. It's a decent brew, but a bit dull. I wouldn't seek it out, personally."

"Poured a cloudy deep brown with reddish tint. There's about a finger of creamy light tan head that doesn't last too long, but does linger on and leaves a wee bit of lacing. The aroma is pretty mild, with just some slight malt hints but nothing definitive. The flavor makes up for it, though. There's a robust roasted malt flavor with some nice dark caramel and little earthy hops on the finish. It's got a nice full fulling on the palate and a little bit of carbonation. Overall, a good to very good Scottish ale."

"I really like this ale. Full malty flavor with so many breweries throwing in hops its nice to have a great tasting beer which quenches the thirst with some great beer flavor. Though the hops are ever so alightly sensed on the nose you don't really catch them on the tongue. This would pare well with a good burger."

"Brewer says this is made with five malts and Fuggles hops, and rates the IBUs at 24. On tap at the brewery on the outskirts of Alexandria."

"O - not overly complex but a very nice, tasty Scottish Ale. A growing favorite style of mine. I definitely enjoyed this and could easily session it."

"Not a terrible beer but definately my least favourite of port city's beers."

"O - This beer is a pretty solid seasonal offering from Port City. The flavor was pretty enjoyable, containing a good level of sweetness that didn't reach the point of being cloying. While this probably isn't a must-have for me, I do appreciate trying new Virginia seasonal brews, especially in a style that's less prevalent like this offering."

"O - The Tartan Ale is another solid offering from Port City. A great, very drinkable offering that most everyone should enjoy."

"Overall though highly drinkable and worth trying. Certainly can enjoy it."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet, subtle flavors and that is to say, not many flavors at all. Not a great beer but it was drinkable, I won't have it again."
"o - Overall a decent beer from Port City. Not my favorite of their seasonals, as I found the nose a bit bland, but the taste made up for it. Nice fruity taste, probably wouldn't pick up a 6er of this one but worth checking out once or twice. I'd rank this slightly below Tidings in terms of liking their seasonal beers, with their Oktoberfest being the best by far."

"D: a well-made scottish ale from port city. the minor smokey notes add an appreciated layer of complexity. certainly worth trying."
""
"O: A pretty decent little ale. Port City is really coming around with their seasonal line up. An above average session beer for the malt men (and ladies) out there. It'd be a treat to share this with friends on a lazy Spring afternoon."
"O: A decent Scottish Ale here. Very light-drinking for the style, but the malt profile could use a little bit more depth and complexity. Definitely one to try, but not one I would want to have multiples of in a sitting. This would be a great six-pack to bring along to a party where you are looking to introduce folks to craft beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and is a great balance of scotch-ale flavor with lightness of feel."

"O: While I probably won't be running down the road to Alexandria to get any growler fills of this stuff, I could easily pop a couple of these. This was a Scottish Ale to my liking."
