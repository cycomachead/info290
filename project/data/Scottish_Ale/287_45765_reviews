"This was a decent beer. I'm on the fence about whether it's worth buying a 6-pack of (I just got one bottle as part of a build-your-own)."

""
""
"Was expecting more. Not a great Scottish ale."
""
"Overall- A really good ale.  I would definitely drink this again."

"Nice dark golden color, very light and smooth taste"
""

"Overall:  This was a very good beer.  Great toasted malt flavor balanced well with hops and caramel-like sweetness.  I’m a little unsure if the sediment floating in the beer was intentional or not, but it doesn’t affect the flavor or mouthfeel, just the appearance."
"Overall, this beer gets a B+, and an 85/100 from me. If you like the sweet grainy notes, toffee and molasses, and a hoppy beer, this one is for you! The beer is fairly dry, so it's gone before you realize it. I'd say get some. It's pretty awesome!"
"Pours a clear medium amber producing 2 fingers of beige, frothy, somewhat lasting, head that leaves a super coating of pasty lacing. Aroma is lightly toasted pumpernickel bread, caramel apple with hints of butter, roasted nuts, floral hops & a faint earthiness. Taste is similar to nose with more toast, apple fruitiness & floral hops. Pepper, Graham crackers & dark honey are added. The bitterness is nicely balanced with the toasted maltiness. Finishes wet but faintly dry (if that makes sense) & peppery with toast that becomes a toasty, dark tea like bitterness in the aftertaste. No smoke or burnt notes/hints detectable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied & moderately carbonated & lightly prickly."
""
""
"O- Glad this isn't spiced, like most Christmas or Winter beers. Not bad. Mild. Could be a little heavier in body and ABV."
""
""
""
"Way better than spiced beers......great malty holiday flavor.  I would highly recommend this beer!"
""
"Pours a hazy burnt-orange in color with close to a 1-finger creamy off-white head with some sheets of lacing seen when sipped. Sediment is seen at the bottom of the bottle around the edges. The aroma is of malts for the most part with some spice. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with some hops with a hint of orange also. The finish is slightly dry but not bad. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew. Overall it wasn't bad for a Scottish Ale."
"Very nice light tasting beer for a dark color...also taste some apple cider."
""
"Not too bad for a scotch ale.  Pretty nice malt and not smoky like some in this category."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light brown. Smells nice and is consistent with most Christmas beers. Get a little bit of hops and some sweetness in the smell. Taste the hops (almost has a lemon taste that gives it the bitterness) and they are not overwhelming. Some sweetness that matches the smell. A good holiday beer. Not the best but good."

"I was hoping for something and got nothing.   Nothing of this beer is Christmas. Average at best. This would be good named ""Bell's Average Ale"".  I am not a fan."
""
""
"Picked up a six of this at TW before Xmas, had some on Xmas eve and Xmas, saved one to review, let's give it  whirl.  Popping the top I get a nice deep zesty caramel waft.  Pours to a light root beer color with a thin tan head.  On the taste this brew has good mouthfeel, thick but not syrup tick.  The taste is a consistent slightly spicy, flatly bitter yet with bits of sweet caramel coming through.  Not really dominant in one flavor or another, balanced and contrite.  Would have expected a little darker a little spicier for a Christmas beer along the lines of a winter warmer, but its imbibeable."

"Good taste. Reminds me nothing of Christmas."

"Not sure what a Scottish ale has to do with Christmas,  but nevertheless a tasty and very easy drinking ale.  Three of the six pack gone in the blink of an eye,  could have easily killed the other three if it had been one of those type of nights.  Shlante!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is slightly sweet caramel malt, with soft notes of cinnamon. Fairly subtle. Flavor reveals a clashing slightly sour/specialty malt fruitiness and a bitter finish. Toffee notes are welcome, but clash again with floral and perfumey hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A VERY good session ale. Malty, but well balanced. Just a very wholesome flavor that screams QUALITY!!! ...Not sure I'd call it a Scottish Ale though."

"Amber in color with some red tinting.  I see an abundance of light sediment suspended in the body.  There's a half inch of small and tightly packed foam that appears beige with a hint of amber.  I smell some slightly earthy barley and I don't pick up anything else.  I taste that earthy to gently sweet barley along with a subtle use of piney hops.  The hops are definitely muted with no bite and are meant to keep the barley sweetness in check.  The mouth is creamy and smooth."

"A really in-your-face maltiness-- as in the malt acts like hops would in a pungent IPA.   A very balanced beer, with bittering hops coming in to act as a foil to all the malt.   Once you settle in with this beer it grows on you.  Good alternative to huge and/or spiced Xmas beers."

"When I first started drinking this beer I thought ""meh", decent, interesting spice but a little off in the finish.  But I continued to drink the beer it smoothed out and I found myself enjoying it.  The score kept going up.  A beer I think I could drink a few of and enjoy but definitely not outstanding so came in under a 4."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a complex brew with a lot going on.  This would be a good beer for a cold day but the low alcohol content keeps it out of the 'winter warmer' class."
""
""
"I like this one a lot.  I was expecting some spicy flavors, but there was little to none.  Instead I had a very smooth malty brew with a medium-light body.  It reminded me of a malty Pale Ale or maybe an ESB, both of which I like very much.  Nicely done."
""
""
""
"Attractive dark amber rests in the glass. But despite its monikor as a Chirstmas Ale, this Bells offering tastes more like a light English bitter filled with esters than a warming spiced ale. The taste is straightforward as dates and esters make much of it. The beer is on the lighter side, which means you could fool people in a blind test for which season this beer is brewed for."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 10/22/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, plum, caramel, toasted bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, plum, caramel, toasted bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, plum, caramel, toasted bread, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and robustness of bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant Scottish ale style. All around good robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Pours amber with a light tan head. Grainy malt aroma with a hint of spice. Could slightly smell some caramel and toffee. Tried this beer back in the winter months and enjoyed it as a winter beer. Wouldn't suggest drinking it during the summer months."

"Pours a murky amber color with a two inch head. Lacing lingers on the glass. The aroma and the taste of this brew combines of toasted bready malts, slight fruity hop flavors and some spice type flavor. Medium body with some carbonation. Goes down smooth too. A decent ale, but nothing spectacular though."
""
"O: OK. Nothing offensive about this one, but it doesn't blow me away either."
""
""
""
""
""

"A murky amber color with a white head. There’s a hint of some hoppy bitterness, but otherwise there’s not much there in terms of flavor or aroma. Has a smooth watery feel. It's odd that this should be a scotch ale, as it lacks the character of scotch ales that I have had. Also odd to call it a Christmas ale, as it lacks the fruits and/or spices associated with such a holiday brew. Disappointing."

"All in all this is good but I don't know why it's called ""Christmas Ale""..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium, carbonation is firm and consistent, not too spritzy but holding a strong crispness. It's not quite creamy, and a dryness coming out in the finish may be either spicing or hops, leaving it semi-dry overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing offensive, but nothing makes it standout compared to the other seasonal's it's competing against. Maybe a good intro to the class for those who don't venture away from the standard American lagers and might be scared off otherwise."

"Pours a clear copper with two big fingers of off-white head that enjoyed some decent retention. The nose has mild malty notes. The malt flavor is richer than the nose might indicate. The finish is mildly dry and bitter. This offering is not heavy, but certainly not light-bodied either. Basically, this beer would pair well with practically any winter holiday meal."

"Bell's makes some quality beers, unfortunately this one does fall into that category. This was poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Transparent Copper color with little to no head/carbonation. Looks and taste is on par with a yuengling lager except more bitter. The ibu on this beer is on the high side exceptionally hoppy coming in at 80 as if it were an IPA. Slight Christmas spices, can't pick out a distinct one though. A Christmas session beer."

"Christmas ale pours a hazy brownish color with a long lasting and lacing head. There is a sweet smell, sugary and hints of cinnamon. The taste has strong sweetness, with a strong sharp malt notes; all spice cinnamon, with hints of nutmeg. Good flavors and body, but very flat on the palette. Overall its a nice full flavor Christmas beer, the sharpness does take away from this beer a bit."

"O - A different take on a Christmas ale, but well done in my book. It's a bit of a change of pace from your typical Winter Warmer/Spiced up ales the Christmas season brings us, but there is still a place for Bell's Christmas. It's of the same mold as their Year Round Amber ale, but still different enough to create its own fan base. This is something I could drink any cold evening. Again, a different take, but still very very good."

"Poured a cloudy amber orange with a thin ring of white head and a lot of chunks of yeast floating around. Not exactly the best looking beer, kind of homebrew-esque. Scents of sweet malt, grape juice, sugar cookies and some faint floral hops and perfume in the background. This seems like a lot of aromas, but its actually a very subdued scent, and its pleasant in its own way. Flavor begins with dry, cracker-like malt flavors and some toasty malt with a moderate level of hop bitterness, mostly floral, but with some slight bitter citrus zest in the background. Toasty malt becomes more apparent in the middle of the sip, with some yeasty flavors, pine resin and faint apricot towards the end. The finish is semi-dry, with a slight bit of sweet malt. The aftertaste is dry, with floral hops dominating. Its a pretty good flavor profile, though more dry and bitter than the aroma hinted. There is also a bit more toasted malt than sweet malt, which the aroma certainly didn't let on to. Its good though. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, a little chunky from the yeast, but also slightly watery with moderate carbonation and a drying mouthfeel. Its an odd, almost paradoxical combination of feelings, but it works, and the mouthfeel certainly doesn't make it hard to drink. Overall this is a decent beer. Its doesn't have the most complex aroma or flavor out there, but what it does it does pretty well. Its got a nice bitter, dry and toasted flavor which is good for Winter and it doesn't load up on sweetness and spice like a lot of Christmas beers. I enjoyed it for what it is, a good, modestly hoppy and toasty beer."

"O - 3.25 - Dissapointment. I wanted more from a Bell's beer. It seems like Bell's either nails beers or sucks. This one sucks."
"O: This is a nice, pleasant beer that will pair well with a lot of foods. I think I'll enjoy the six pack but I haven't decided if I'll revisit this in the future. I will say that it is nice to have a ""Christmas"" ale that hasn't been tricked up with a lot of spices."
"Bottled 10/15/13. Pours amber with a full off white head that lasts coupled with excellent lacing. Nose is hops, pine and citrus, against a spicy background. Light medium body. Well carbonated. Taste is well balanced with the focus being on spice - nutmeg and ginger - which become more pronounced as the beer warms. Hops are present, but in the background and compliment the spices. Finishes cleanly with a slight hop bitterness that lingers along with the spices - ginger being most prevalent. Addition of dark malt would make this beer outstanding."

"Appearance is a beautiful brown to red color with a finger length head. Smell- I can smell beautiful types of fruit, some honey, some wheat. Just a beautiful smell I really love the smell of this beer. Taste- So I have to be honest. I am from Cleveland Ohio and I am going to college in Michigan and very upset because Great Lakes Brewing Company's Christmas ale just came out in Cleveland and I can't get it in Michigan so I saw this at the store and said I'd give it a try not expecting much. I'm shocked. It's great! It starts with a hoppy like honey taste and finishes with a beautifully smooth yet strong cinnamon taste. I think it competes hard with Great Lakes Christmas Ale the only thing I don't like as much about it as it is only 5.5 abv and Great lakes is 7.5% abv. Other than that I'm loving this beer. This is my second beer by Bell's and I'm loving this brewer. Mouth feel- the moth feel is exactly what it should be for this type of beer. I is easy to drink and smooth but has a perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is great and makes being away from my hometown of Cleveland and away from my Great Lakes Christmas Ale a little bit easier. Just a Great Beer. A Must Try! Just to say though I think my rating might be a bit higher because it totally surpassed my expectations."

"This is a really nice beer, it is sort of like a malty, definitely hoppy Pale Ale; really though the hop character is quite dominant; it makes me think of a smaller version of Sierra Nevada Celebration. The distinctive hop fruitiness is also really interesting here as well. The reviews on this beer are quite interesting, I am not sure why people think this is a Scotch / Scottish ale; this is definitely a hoppy Pale ale of some sort & it is really interesting how many people missed the dominant hop character b/c someone mistakenly labeled this as Scottish (whatever that means)."

"Crap. Amateur pour on my part, sediment everywhere. Pours ruby orange with a half finger white head that lingers a bit. Smells like a basic lager, and don’t get much spice or scotch ale here. Flavor is sweet malt, and not much else. Light mouthfeel and dirty finish. Not a very good effort here by Bells. Not terrible, but I would not get it again."

"Poured this Scottish Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy amber color, produced a thick creamy off white head, nice retention and it left nice amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted malt, caramel, apple and a slight hint of citrus. Medium bodied, a foundation of malted grain, fresh baked bread and sweet toffee. The flavor profile rounds out with a hint of orange citrus- slightly bitter- Overall it's merely average- a little thin and watery for a ""Christmas Ale"". Easy to drink- I suppose it's a decent beginner craft beer. Not something I would seek out again."

"Overall: A bit more pale than I would have expected and I got more winter warmer here than Scottish ale. That said I like the spice combination. A good not great beer that I would get a six pack of each holiday if it were available here."
""

"i poured this into a pint glass, it had a reddish color body, with a 2""tan head to it. The smell is sweet of malt. The taste is sweet of malt and has some citrus hop on the finish. I didn't detect any spices. The mouth feel is very nice, smooth and well carbonated. Overall a good beer. This is only the the 3rd scottich ale i have had."
""
"Hazy reddish orange with a few fingers of cream coloured head. Nose has a sweet cakey malt, some fruits, a bit of grass/herbal and some grains. Taste has grainy notes, some dried fruits, citrus zest, and some spice. Mild bitterness, malt is sweet. Medium carbonation. Nice flavour profile on this guy, I'd revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a pretty good beer. It just seems a little watered down, especially for a Christmas beer. I think it would do well with some more of that sweet caramelized malt and definitely some more smoky and earthy aromas and flavors. Still, this is a tasty and very drinkable beer. Even when Bell’s misses, they don’t miss by much."
"O - Meh, nothing I would buy again, could be done much better and I don't know why I kept getting large floatables in my beers, and yes I was very careful when pouring."
"I liked this beer, it was better than expected. Still developing my palette and have been trying various craft brewers out."

"This offering from Bell's Brewery pours up a kind of hazy copper with a big fluffy two finger head with great retention, and plenty of lacing. The smell is kind if grassy and pine. Taste is kind of dry and flat, not very strong at all. It isn't bad but it certainly wasn't as good as I expected it would be. Mouthfeel is okay, but has a mild lingering unpleasant aftertaste. I've had worse, but this was kind of a disappointment considering the brewery."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a slightly hazy orange caramel with a frothy off white head. Smell is sweet and malty, a little bready, very different and inviting. Taste follows, less sweet than expected but a unique malt flavor, with not much else except a hint of bitter at the end. I was surprised to read on bells website that they use no spices, considering the smells and flavors. A nice smooth medium mouthfeel. Overall a unique Christmas ale, definitely worth trying."
"Served in a pint with a thin finger of white head that laces the glass. Looks like Christmas-copper/amber and clear. Smells of warm spices and breast caramel toasted malt. Slight aroma of pine tree hops. Taste is smooth. Malt forward with a nice finish of NW US hops. A full bodied brew with a hint of astringency/hop resin in the finish. Overall a very nice winter beer. Aromatic, malty with some nice complexity."
""

"Really enjoyed this, it incorporated a good range of flavour, decent complexity into a pretty well balanced ale, and avoided being overly sweet. A nice treat, could be more interesting but this is a nice easy-drinking xmas beer and worth a try."

"O: Not really what I expected, a little light in smell and taste for what I expect in the style - I expected something a little less generic from Bell's. Overall the flavor is pretty well balanced and enjoyable. Easy to drink because it is ind of generic."
""

"Bell's Christmas Ale ---3.5/5."
""
""
"O. Meh, I would drink it again, but it will not make the regular Christmas rotation."
""
""
"O-its an interesting beer. its not as glamorous as the typical christmas beer. this is much more raw. as much as i appreciate the authentic approach, its a boring beer. there isn't much here at all. i'm not even sure what kind of beer its supposed to be, it definitely doesn't resemble a scotch ale...i'm not sure who decided that was this style. something i won't get again. skip it. i expect more from Bells."
"O - Not sure what to make of this beer it is well made and is not off-putting but it is not one I would reach for again. It flavors are a little strange and I am having a hard time placing them. It almost reminds me of a lactose beer I had in the past. Try it your up to something different but do not expect to be blown away. Cheer!"
"Overall - I'm not really sure what to think of this one. I'm not blown away by it, but I'm a bit intrigued. A decent beer? Yes. A good beer? Not so sure."
"Curious about the low rankings, as this is a nice spiced Scottish Ale, perfect for the Christmas season. I feel like this years' is a vast improvement from the last."
""
""
"Bells Christmas ale pours a red color with a nice off white head. Nice lacing. Malts are upfront here. Slight toasted and a bready or earty. The body doesn't hold up as I would like. Some spice in the finish. An easy drinker in the Scottish Ale category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The beer was off, poor balance and didn't have the spices I like from a christmas ale."
"A nightcap following the Steelers' win over the Ravens a little while ago. I love an aggro pour as it really creates as much head as possible and opens up the beer's nose. I got two-plus fingers of dense tawny head with excellent retention from my nearly-inverted pour. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with malt, giving rise to truth in advertising. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching fullness with respect to its near-creaminess. The interplay between the malt, which was prevalent on the nose, and the hops, which now seemed to take center stage on the tongue, was notable. As the head began to fall, loads of sticky lacing was left behind. I was having a hard time believing that this was a Scottish Ale, but at the same time, I was totally digging it! I just wish that the malt had been more smoky as opposed to outright sweet. Finish was semi-sweet with the hops reigning in what could have been too much."
"O - A very nice ale - distinctly American yet complex. Nothing to do with christmas, but I'll drink it any time, anywhere."
""
"Very mild beer. Medium bodied. Dry finish. Doesn't really coat the mouth. Doesn't make a big deal of itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale poured a cloudy, sediment filled and bubbly appearance with a nice creamy one finger head and no lacing. The scent was so subtle that I got nothing but a bit of ginger. The taste is sweet and typical of a Scottish Ale but unremarkable. I'd write more but this Ale is not particularly interesting and needs little else."

"I dont know why they call this a Christmas Ale. It is a really impressive Scottish Ale. Clean, smooth, malty, but not at all sweet or cloying. Very impressive."

"o - overall meh. Glad i only got a single of this one. Not really something i will seek out. I have had many scotch asked that i lives this was not awful, but boy above average."
""
""
"Overall: This is one of the regular seasonal Bells offering that I seem to always miss every year like clockwork, which I did regret from time to time, and, now that I've had it, well, I wouldn't have it again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice beer for alot of brewers but not what I expect from Bell's. I guess when you do almost everything so well, once something does not measure up to your normal standards it gets noticed. With that said I would love to produce something like this at home, very drinkable"
""
""
"O - Maybe I'm totally off with the apple theory but that's what I'm getting; Bell's Christmas Apple Ale. I thought this was pretty good beer though, enjoyed the flavor and it was easy to drink."

"Mouthfeel - Light but creamy. Despite not getting what I expected from a Bell's Christmas, a highly drinkable and delicious brew. What I have come to expect from Bell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Scent, taste, and mouthfeel are all good. The carbonation is a bit high but not as bright as a pilsner. A definite malt presence.I will get this again if I can find it."

"I really think this was infected. What I took away from this didn't match any of the other reviews."
""
"O - I thought this beer was pretty solid. It doesn't seem to fit in the typical holiday beer mold without the usual spices in there, and had a unique flavor for sure. That said, the taste still reminded me of Christmastime, even though I cracked this beer open a day late. Overall, I feel this beer is a good option to enjoy in good company."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Reminds me of a beer version of a dry, fruity sparkling wine, but actually fairly drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is not like most christmas ales.. i don't taste many spices, but it sure is awesome."
""
"O: This is one of the best Scotch Ales I've had, and definitely one of the better Christmas Ales on the market. I'd drink this beer again."
""
"D/O: This ale is relatively malt-forward, but conservative. It has a nuanced and dynamic sweetness that is, perhaps, its most interesting feature. When one considers that other notable qualities include an early herbaceous burst that is not particularly hop-like, it seems like a reasonable contribution to the style and a worthwhile candidate for food pairings."
"O: The one thing I think is generally overdone with scottish/scotch ales is the malt presence. Sometimes they are so malty and give such a full, creamy feel that it is difficult for me to put down a pint without feeling full. Not this beer; the forward hop notes totally balance this ale and make it quite drinkable. Well balanced and, despite the larger initial hop presence, this beer really comes through as a scottish ale. I will buy this every winter going forward."
"Overall - The beer definitely has a taste all it's own. It's a mixed bag of all kinds of flavours, unfortunately one of them is a little too artificial. Still a beer with a taste that is interesting enough to warrant trying it."
"O: A little too sweet, but still enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a solid beer. There is a pleasing nose and taste, however nothing that stands out as being mind blowing. A great seasonal go to? Definitely."

"Bell's Christmas Ale pours a red-amber color with a finger of head. The aroma is a nice mix of sweet fruits, caramel malts, and a bit of spices. The taste follows this, with a sweet cherry taste and some light spices up front, with a bit of herbal hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and well-carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Overall, a solid beer. I meant to drink this actually on Christmas, but the whole working at 3 AM the day after Christmas thing put a whole damper to my holiday celebrations."

"10/26/11A printed on label. Poured from 12oz bottle into a snifter. A - Hazy amber color with an off white minimal head. Spotty lacing. S - Sweetness up front with caramel malts and candy aromas. Hint of a floral spice. T - Sweet up front on the taste as well with a minimal hops bitterness. Definitely more sweet malts than hops. M - A moderate carbonation and medium body. A very nice flavorful beer, rather sweet from the malts. Perhaps needs more spice to go with the name."

"unique take on a christmas beer. pours a heavy amber color with an off white head 2 inches high. smells very different, like wine grapes and other acidic fruits. malty and rich. flavors of the grapes are really bold, very unfamiliar territory on my beer palate, but i like it. theres fruit without sweet, which i like a lot. also a very smooth bready malt flavor which balances everything out. mouthfeel is a little heavy for me on this one, especially as it warms. it filled me up, which most beers usually do not. overall though an excellent beer which is apparently quite hard to come by. really different flavor, worth a try for sure."

"I could use a little more to the nose, to really bring out the subtleties in the taste, but hey - it's nice to curl up with a growler-full of a great, sessionable beer and share with a friend. Happy holidays."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, medium carbonation. Overall it seems slightly astringent, but not terribly so. I think it would benefit from being a bit more malty overall, with the balance tipping away from hops. The finish is semi-sweet and the bitterness lingers for a while."
"Different as it may be, I certainly did enjoy drinking it....not sure if it's really think ""winter"" when drinking it, but that at least makes it more versatile if a person lets it sit around until spring!"
""
""
"It's not as spicy as other holiday beers which makes it a little more unique in that aspect. I would like to try this on draft next time."
"It pours a light auburn color, almost like a dark blood orange tint. It’s lightly hopped with a bit of citrus and a touch of pine to it. Not a hoppy beer but I’m wondering if the hops are more forward with a fresh batch (bottled in October, purchased/drunk on Christmas Eve)? Regardless it was still great. I picked up some sweet cherry notes, a light maltiness that held up, and just a fantastic pleasing finish as well. What a treat."

"Overall - This was a tough one to review for me, I tried to keep it simple. I haven't had a lot of Scottish ales but it does not seem like a typical example. Also not what I would really expect as a 'Christmas Ale.' Still, it is interesting and has good flavors to it."
""
"cheers"
"The flavor combinations didn't really push my buttons here, but my wife liked it. Not bad, but behind about 12 other Bell's I've tried."
""
""
""
"A nice beer, perhaps not nice enough to justify being a ""special"" Christmas beer without being kicked up a few notches but very drinkable. That's perhaps what they were going for a somewhat sessionable very nice Christmas ale. It's definitely one of the better Scottish Ales I've had."
""
""
""
""
"As a big fan of this brewery was excited to give it a try. Must say, I was a little disappointed. Has a bit of a fruit scent to it and also kind of a sour note like sour prunes. Mediocre at best, fun to try but won't be enjoying it on Christmas this year."
""
"Enjoyable enough to drink, but nothing really recommends this to be consumed en masse. I liked it, and would drink another if it were being served at a party or something, but wouldn't pick it up again on my own."
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is dark amber with an orange tint. Initially the pour was clear, but some cloudiness came from the final pour off the bottom of the bottle. The full dense head is long lasting. Scents are like a nice fruit cocktail with ripe pear and peach. The taste is nicely balanced between caramel/bready malt flavors and floral/grassy hop flavors. A bitterness in the finish really comes through. Not very complex or intensely flavored, but enjoyable."
""
""
"Translucent amber-orange color with about a finger of sticky white head. Smells of bread and brown sugar. Sweet tasting that is more balanced with a nice spiciness rather than a bitterness from the hops. Medium mouthfeel and nicely carbonated. I really like this one and prefer it over other holiday brews. Bonus for being made with Michigan ingredients! I'll get it every year."
""
""
"This was a fairly good beer, the flavor was good but nothing really above average. This is a nice easy drinker that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Not a spectacular beer but one I really enjoy. Far too often we can get caught up in big bold flavors, huge depth and complexity and ignore a simple straight forward beer. This one may not blow anyones mind, its simply a good beer."
""
"Slightly sweet and even a little smoky aftertaste. Reminds me more of ESB with, but regardless a very nice beer and perfect for time of year. Plenty going on, another strong offering from Bells."
""
""
"O: This Scottish Ale is comparable to the other two I've had. Pretty good, but it especially look really good."
"Perfectly nice as a session or as a one-off to break up the regular mix."
"D: not your typical holiday winter warmer. a neat take to have a scottish as their Christmas Ale. good tasting brew from a brewery that doesnt really make a ad one."
"It's a medium tan color with lots of foam. Smells of malt, grapefruit, and nutmeg, ok but not impressive. The taste is quite nice, with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove floating over a nice malt base. The body seems light for either a scottish ale or typical winter lager but the taste more than makes up for it."
""
""
""
"Hazy copper color, thin head, lots of bubbles. Smells of leather, fruit, toasty malt; no hops come forward. The taste is unique, and strange. My first impression was creamy/milky, coppery, dry oatmeal, slight tartness on the finish. Nicely carbonated with a sparkle on the wash-down. When the carbonation dies it leaves a watery aftertaste. A good percentage of the initial flavor dies out quickly, leaving a mild alcohol burn and not much else. Too thin overall for a Scotch ale? I like Bell's in general, but I think they could do better job on this ""special"" ale. They have done much better on other beers. Just not much to report here in terms of anything memorable."

""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good, but I expect the best from Bell's. Nice malt flavor, and hops to balance out the mix."
"Good flavors, good smell. This being my first one, I'm impressed with what I'm getting from it, but I'm not sure I'd rush to get it again. Definitely unique."
"O - I liked this one a whole lot, and was happy that they didn't try to flavor it or something like that. Very drinkable, and a pretty good festive brew."
""
"O - A pretty good brew overall, but not something I would seek out in the future."
"Overall this is a pretty decent offering from Bell’s, but far from one of their best. It ticks all the boxes for the style but leaves me wanting more in most areas. Perhaps that is why they only brew it once a year."
"Overall: A pretty solid Christmas brew. Nice use of malts and hops. It did pretty well without the spices as the Brewery website states."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll be honest, I like this one because it's great for the holidays. Not a bad beer either, although doesn't really taste like a Scottish ale. Nothing too amazing and easy forgettable, but great for the holidays and easy to drink. I personally wouldn't go out of my way again for this one, but it's decently priced and makes a nice gift for beer baskets this time of year."

"O - I didn't like the beer that much at first, but it really started to grow on me towards the end and I am left craving another."
""
"O - I can't believe that this is a Scotch ale, tastes much more like a pale ale, which is fine with me."

""
""
"o - a solid beer and quite enjoyable on this cold december night. really glad that they didn't try to add a bunch of spices to this, it's festive enough! i wish bell's regular beers were as good as their seasonals. recommended."
"O- What is it with Bells' winter seasonals being so unexciting? This and Winter White Ale are both not bad, just boring."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: good beer overall, Bell's rarely disappoints. Having this for the first time, it's solid for the category and the spices aren't too much like a few seasonals."

"Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this one. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter. Pours a murky orange-brown color. Barely any head. Smell- orange marmalade meets apple. Maybe some sort of wassail scent. Meh. Taste- caramel, toffee, orange, vanilla on the end. Not bad. Carbonation is a little sharp, a little bit stingy. This isn't a bad beer. def not a typical Christmas Ale. I'm not getting a lot of the typical spices that you would find, this seems to be very malt forward, calling it a scotch ale seems appropriate. Don't know that I would really seek it out again, but I will enjoy this glass."

"Overall I am really happy to tick another Bell's beer, but this one didn't meet my strict, no belgian/wheat beer request. This one is a bit on the Belgian banana and wheat grass side for me to love, let alone like it."
"O - A good quaffer, nothing overwhelming but a nicely balanced winter brew, would be interesting to see how it would taste with some spices added."
""
""
""
""
"Summary: When the weather outside is frightful, this ale is quite delightful."

"Overall, a good offering. I'd say worth buying a couple 12oz bottles to try out."
""
""
"Overall not bad and not so solid... Could use more malty charactor for the style but a hell of a quafter... cheers!"
""
""
"A really nice beer that can be easily drank. Like that this is on the lower alcohol side than most winter beers. Enjoyed the toasty malt and unique hop flavors. Will drink again for sure. Hops do a good job of complementing and not overshadowing the malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-- this is a decent beer. In my mind, it does not fit the scottish ale label very accurately and it is lacking in the malt complexity department. I would describe this as more of a IPA/Irish red hybrid."
""
""
"Overall, this beer was a very good holiday seasonal and very, very drinkable!"
""
"4.5 D: I like this beer for a lot of different reasons. It gives lots of caramel and toffee without being overly thick and sweet. It smells unlike any other beer I've ever had. (PEZ!) It drinks super easy. Great holiday ale."
""
""
""
"Pours out a hazy reddish amber with an off-white two finger head that leaves some really nice lacing behind with each sip, smells like butterscotch and mildly of....fresh cranberries? My best guess is that the heavy sweet malt odor is combining with some kind of spicy / citric hopping to read as cranberries to my nose. Flavor has a nice full spectrum of overlapping malts on top of each other heavily spiced (for the scotch ale style, that is) with the same kind of hopping flavor as expected from the nose, perhaps I detect some cinnamon elements as well but it is hard to get a bead on it. Body is medium to heavy in thickness and carbonated just enough to keep it from being sludgey. Pretty good in my book."
""
"M - very slight carbonation, smooth, sweet, drinkable. Good representation of the style."
"O: A nice christmas ale. A break from the winter warmers. Full flavored and well crafted."

"Bell's does a nice job with this style interpretation. I didn't get much of the traditional peat note, but there was a nice caramel malt aspect which seemed to carry the barest whiff of smoke. Overall the beer was lively and consistent from front to back. There seemed a faint echo of a spice at the finish. Overall, a reserved seasonal offering, but hearty."
""
"Overall: Overall this is a good ale."
"Overall a non intrusive kind of beer. Not really sticking out with any real certain qualities."
"O- A really unique beer that sounds like a perfect combination for me, the sweet mailtiness of a scottish ale and a big juicy citrus hop presence. I really enjoyed it, but think the hoppiness took over this beer a little bit too much. I would love to try another hoppy scottish ale and could see myself getting this one again."
"It still leaves your mouth coated with a candy coated smoothness."
"O: probably not as good as the famously overrated GLBC Christmas Ale, but it’s a good take on the Christmas Ale style, I really found it enjoyable and easy to drink. I would give this beer my recommendation, but it’s not in my top 5’s for bells."
"Overall, not a bad Bell's brew, but it is not what I would look to first on a cold, Holiday night."
"Beer #2 of the winter mix 6 pack. I thought this was a winter warmer, but it's listed as a Scottish ale. In either case, it was strange smelling and strange tasting. Swing and a miss with this one for Bell's."
"Overall - Light, mild, smooth and easy to drink. Problem is theres not enough flavors, malts overpower everything. Its good but not what it can be. Its not bad but its forgettable, theres better xmas ales out there."
"Mouthfeel was medium with good carbonation. A very drinkable brew that I try every time it comes around in the seasonal selection."
"Overall, not a bad amber ale. Not sure how ""Christmas""-like this one is, but a solid session beer nonetheless."
"After trying Bells' Winter White Ale I stumbled upon this brew. Figure maybe it would be a more logical choice for a winter brew than a White Ale. This beer poured out as a deep amberish red color with a tan fizzy head on top. So far it looks morel like a winter ale. The smell of the beer has some faint spices on the nose along with hops and malts. The taste seems to have a good amount of caramel sweetness upfront that fades into a spicy sweetness. The mouthfeel could probably be a little thicker or heavier. Overall it's not that much of a winter brew either in my opinion. I can't say that I'd have to buy it again or not."
"O - rather blase offering, particularly for something called a ""Christmas Ale", but should appeal to many people, especially fans of amber ales."
"O - While I'm not getting how this is a ""Christmas"" beer, I think its a nicely drinkable Scottish Ale that I could enjoy year-round."
"O: Its pretty good, if I hadn't read it, I would not have pegged it for a Scottish, I just assumed it was a winter warmer."
"It's Christmas in March, thanks to this beer. Sure, it's not quite Christmas in July, but Rudolph and Frosty can't be everywhere at all times. Anyway, it pours a generally clear light russet-amber topped by a finger of cream-white foam. A healthy population of particulates wafts about the glass. The nose comprises caramel, orange peel, light red grapes, and a pinch of nutmeg. The taste follows pretty closely, though with the addition of some mild toffee and some cinnamon. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly grainy feel. Overall, a nice Scottish ale, nothing special, but tasty and enjoyable."
"d- nice drinkability here, i would drink this again for sure. winter isn't my favorite season for beer, but i found this to be a welcome brew. i'd drink this again for sure."
"Drinkabilty is pretty good, this is a nice crisp clean beer but is lacking on characteristics expected for a holiday seasonal beer."
"drinkability despite being this is an easy beer to drink and nice to taste"
"Poured into a pint glass, it has a nice hazy orange color, light bodied. The aroma is of orange peel and herbal scents, followed by some yeasty notes. The flavor is quite bitter and you lose the citrus and breadiness of it. The toffee-flavored toasted malts are too apparent as there is a lingering aftertaste and slight alcohol finish. Not bad, but couldn't see myself sitting around the fireplace long enough for a session, like I normally expect a fine Christmas Ale to be."
"Overall this beer wasnt very impressive at all. It was just very bland and lacked and special character or solidness to it."
"Finish is simple light bitter coffee."
"Drinkability: Wow, this is pretty sad. Bell's normally delivers in the flavor department, but this was just flat and boring."
"D: This beer is fine. Uninspiring, but fine. I would have another one back-to-back to this if something else wasn't available, but if a selecation was available to me I would choose to move on to something else."
"Drinks easy enough, a nice one to relax by the fire with. This one did not age well, had a couple bottles a month after purchase & it was going down hill fast"
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. The pour yields a clear, dark, reddish-orange amber colored body. A spongy head of khaki colored foam settles quickly, leaving a frothy skin on the surface and some jagged flares and spots on the glass. Despite the malty claim on the description, this is one hoppy scotch ale which isn't really true to its style. Notes of pine, grass, and grapefruit come across as a ""christmas-y"" taste lending bright, bittering notes to the underlying base of toasted bread, honey, and Lightly bronzed sugars. Flavors are similarly structured, striking a nice balance between resinous, citrusy hops, dough, toast, and light toffee-honey sweetness. The palate is medium-plus in stature, lively carbonated, finishing grassy, resinous, and semi-dry. It is a weird and non-traditional scottish ale..."
"Bell's interesting. Some many exceptional beers, and quite a few every day drinkers that could be a notch up. All in all though one of the best brewery's in this fair country."
"drinkability - way too much carbonation, fairly mild flavor, not much there especially for the abv"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Bell's Christmas Ale is an amber-orange color with a frothy white head. Probably on the lighter side of the color spectrum for a Scottish Ale. The nose is a mixture of crystal malt, caramel and west coast citrus-y hops. The flavor has a big upfront hoppiness to it (citrus and pine resin) and then mellows into a better balance as the sweeter caramel notes come out; however the brew does lean towards the hoppy side. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, slightly dry with a creamy carbonation. Overall, a very drinkable beer, a very good beer but I'm not sure how it fits in as a Scottish Ale - I think it may have rated better in a different category."
"Overall, Bell's Christmas Ale is a very good example of a Scottish ale. I spent 6 months in Scotland last year and tried my fair share of Scottish ales, and this brew is one of the better examples I've had. That being said, I'm not a huge fan of Scottish ales, as they are too light on the flavor, but I've enjoyed this beer."
"D - I don't remember it being this great out of the bottle but it sure impressed me on tap! Great flavor and surprisingly smooth low ABV scotch ale!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability isn't bad, it went down pretty easily and had some decent flavors. It wasn't bad at all but it also just wasn't all that special either. It seemed pretty plain for a Xmas beer as well."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew was a nice red amber color, mostly transparent with a 1 finger white head that dissipated to a thin cap with decent lacing down the glass. The aroma was nice with a good citrus hop presence and a solid caramel malt essence. Truth be told I was expecting more of a winter warmer style which tends to be too over the top spicy with cinnamon and clove and the like but this brew being a scottish ale was nice and balanced. The caramel malts hit the front of your tongue while the slight citrus and pine hops hit the finish with moderate carbonation and a crisp finish this is a fine ale to sip on. Good session brew in my opinion."
"This goes down well. The fruity flavors make each drink worth it. The moderate alcohol mean you can have several."
"Getting down and dirty, I've decided this isn't my cup of tea at all and I'm, somewhat, struggling to finish the bottle. Bell's makes some really excellent brews so it's no big deal that I didn't find the Christmas Ale to my liking."
"Another quality Bells offerering, not your typical spiced Christmas Ale brewed with locally grown ingredients, kudus Bells."
"Drinkability - This beer is alright. Wouldn't be my first choice for a Winter/Christmas brew, but ok none the less. It's easily drinkable with tame aromas and flavors. I would drink it again if it was offered."
"Drinkability: A cool take on the style for the season. Drinkable, sessionable, and a good amalgam of flavors for the season. Merry Christmas everyone."
"This beer is quite refreshing and not heavy on the gut or the head. I might make this a go-to session beer this holiday season."
"D-Nice drinkable beer but there are a lot like that. If I want a Holiday Beer from Bell's I'd rather reach for an Expedition...scratch off the label and write HOLIDAY BEER in black market to appease myself. As a beer this is decent. As a Holiday special beer it is a disappointment. I'll rate it as a beer...an APA.."
"D- Highly drinkable because there isn't too much to think about and it won't wear your tastebuds out. Although I was expecting a bit more flavor."
"Drinkability: The orange aspect to this beer is unusual, but I think it works for a Christmas Ale. I think of oranges as gifts during the holidays, and with the orange balanced out by the malt, it comes out as a sipping beer to savor on a cold evening - it's certainly festive. However, I found I could not have another one by the end, one is enough. But it is definitely not a Scottish Ale and should not be thought as such nor rated as such."
"It's a malt forward beer, but with enough hop bitterness to make it balanced. Notes of toast, caramel and a slight hint of cotton candy are present. It would be good to drink with a meal - it's got enough flavor to pair with a wide variety of foods without being overwhelming - or as a session beer. I like it pretty well but if you are looking for something with some seasonal spice or something big and hearty this won't fit the bill. If you're entertaining and want to stock a beer that's drinkable, but has enough flavor that beer snobs won't scoff, this would do nicely."
"When I ordered this I did not realize it was a Scottish Ale. This only further proves the point that this beer isn't up to snuff - I had no notiion at all that this was anything other than an attempt at a spiced Christmas Ale."
"D - This beer is very drinkable. However, it would not be what I was expecting or wanted if I were ordering a Christmas Ale."
"Average Scottish Ale, but drinkable enough. Glad I just bought a single, though."
"D= This was a nice beer to have on a cold winter day really enjoyed it a lot better on draft than in the bottle."
"D: A really superb Scottish ale, on mark for the style, and a really good choice by Bell's for a winter ale."
"D: High."
"overall a very solid offering a nice change up for a winter beer. not sure about the scottish ale side of it, but damn nice."
"D: If it matters, it is certainly easy to drink but very mild and unimpressive. THis is a Christmas seasonal I will likely pass over in the future."
"D- It's a vary drinkable beer. The taste is not to strong to kill your taste buds. I'm ready to have another one. Only if I didn't have to work tomorrow."
"Maybe the best Christmas ale of the season."
"Overall, not what I was expecting. But not terrible. Just doesn't quite fit the season. Perhaps Bell's should come out with a second, heavier version of this stuff. Then I'd be satisfied."
"Could I drink a lot of this? Sure. Would I want to? No, not really. This beer certainly doesn't fit it's description, and that withstanding, is still not a great beer by any stretch of the imagination."
"Thinner medium body, higher carbonation, a little chewy. Drinks okay, but I really wasn't impressed with the flavor and pretty much wanted to be through with this to get to something better."
"D - This is a very easy to drink beer, which should be expected. It is not good though."
"The taste was of hops and citrus, and small hints of spices. I thought it was great, but it tastes more like a mild IPA than a christmas ale."
"Overall: Not nearly as good as Oberon."
"There are many excellent holiday offerings out there. If you're looking for something to excite you don't look here. If you're looking for something that your Lite drinking sister-in-law might consent to drink you might try this."
"D: Drinkable and pleasant."
"D: With no overpowering spices this year, this beer is a joy to drink!"
"D - Good one to serve to my family or friends who is not into craft beers. Almost reminds of Budweiser select. Wont be buying it again....might even be in my fridge till next christmas! LOL!!"
"Pours a nice lookin amber. All downhill from that point on. Scent is dull, and taste is light and unimpressive. I'm a big fan of winter/christmas beers for their robust scents, and complex flavors. This beer falls short in all aspects, as far as what I look for in a winter seasonal ale. Oh well, off to the next"
"The aroma is modest. Some nutty character and malt combine to convince you are drinking a ""brown"" beer, but nothing else. I would expect a deeper malt character for a Scotch ale. More of the same on the palate. Non-sweet malt which morphs into a dry hop character at the end. It finishes a little pepper, which must be from the hops. For a Christmas ale, comment on the lack of spice. For a Scotch ale, I would ask for more malt and less hop."
"Drinks easily, nothing terribly strong or off-putting."
"From a flavor perspective the first thing you notice is that this beer is too bitter/hoppy to be a scottish ale, and honestly isnt my style for my favorite beer season - Christmas. Mouth is a little thin. This beer is made for the hopheads, not those of us who love scottish or Christmas beers - at least in my opinion."
"Pours a hazy amber with a thin, soapy head and little carbonation. Nose is amber malt with mild seasonal spices, a little nutty. Taste is mostly the rounded amber malt, a little toasted almond, clove and coriander, a little bittering hops. Medium body, lightened somewhat by the spices, not bad overall. A good solid winter amber ale that's not too in-your-face with the spices."
"Light head, finger of light tan to eggshell white, lots of larger bubbles which dissipate at a rapid clip, doesn't come up with much lacing. Gauzy orange rust in color with a burnt red dirt edge, slight loss of depth at the rims, loosely arranged bubbles spread throughout the glass. Clean evanescence to the nose, dried grass and straw, peat moss, pepper and sage, mild caramel and chocolate accents, as it warms you get more apricot, peach, yellow apple scents as well as scone, soda bread and honey. Medium-bodied, here the carbonation too active, prevents many of the flavors from finding a center and then soaking in. Noticeably dry, leads once more with a grassy earthiness, followed on by dry grapefruit, orange pith. The yellow apple, pear, apricot fruit tenuous, in turn not enough honey, toffee to elevate overall sweetness and bolster the fruit. Smidge of pepper and other bitter herbs, leading into a sour finish. Not horrible, but doesn't make you especially want another bottle."
"Overall a malty and nutty beers with faint hop presence. Not very impressive for a brewery like Bells."
"D: Bell's has done better work, but this isn't a wholly undrinkable beer."
"I love Scottish ales, and this is a good example by an American brewery."
"D - At 5.4% it's definitely not hard to have several of these. And it isn't a bad beer by any means so I'd say it's slighty abover average as a drinker."
"Meh. Not my favorite seasonal this season, but it was balanced decently. Easy to drink if you aren't looking for an overwhelming taste bonanza."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer, I was not wowed by it but I would buy this again, specifically for the holidays. The combination of fruits and spices make this a worthy Christmas ale. Good job Bell's."
"Notes: where did the flavor go? im re-reviewing this and is nothing like my notes. sometimes i wonder who is tasting for consistency!"
"Poured from the bottle into a merlot glass. Golden in color with a little bit of ruby red. There's a 2 finger white head that has good retention and lacing. This isn't a strong smelling beer, but I get some light fruit and floral aromas. The taste follows the nose and also has some added nutmeg/winter spices. The main fruit tastes I noticed were cherries and apples. The carbonation on this is a little high, but gives it a nice crisp, clean finish, especially with the spices. Overall, I enjoyed this beer and would have it again."
"Pours a hazed coppery brown color with decent cap of khaki head. Scent brings forward a mix of sweet carmel malts, roasted nuts, citrusy hops and some prune/fig like qualities. Taste starts with the citrusy hops, followed by a 50/50 mix of sweet malts and roasted nuts, the back end features the lingering notes of dark dried fruits. Medium bodied, slightly high in carbonation. A decent beer, but the strange mix can overpower the palate - akin to a very hoppy brown ale in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Sweet with a crisp finish"
"Overall- i didn't know what to expect from this beer. i heard many of tales. some say they can taste some hops like an american pale ale to some say it was a weaker brown ale. to me, this brew is what i would define as a basic brew. it's not to much of one thing but in the middle. i bet they use the yeast in their two hearted as the same in this brew."
"M/D- A bit sticky on the lips, but not sweet. Reminds me a bit of wassail, but not something I would seek out an entire six pack. Could be a great beer to use during the holidays to convert noncraft dinners though."
"Drink well to all, and to all a good drink."
"D: Simple in nature, and relatively easy to drink. I wouldn't want more than one, however."
"The taste of cherry makes this a difficult beer to drink. Would not recommend more than one."
"M/D: Good carbination, somewhat sweet with a crisp finish. It was just a good beer, nothing breath taking. However, perfect for friends and family, nothing to overwhelming..."
"Drinkability: Certainly inoffensive enough to drink several, but it's just a little too boring."
"Pours an orangish-amber with one finger head and good lacing. Nose of caramel malt and scotch/peat smoked malt essence. Sweet sugary malt at the front, hoppy finish, wheat in the aftertaste. Medium light body and highly drinkable. Decent brew for the season!"
"Overall, pretty bland, but not bad. Just kind of neutral, but simple enough to be a good one to share at a holiday get together. Though far from a Scottish or Christmas Ale in any sense."
"D - This was surprisingly decent. I'm glad that they didn't spice this like every other Christmas on the market. It was one of the best options available at the Kilt, so I may be having it again sometime."
"Pours a light amber color with generous sized white frothy head. Nose is on the lighter side but clearly bready and grainy. Palate is mostly toasty flavors, perhaps with some dry twigs in there too. Hops have some light spicing to round it out so the malt isn't terribly sweet. Overall finishes toasty again, perhaps biscuity."
"Happy Holidays!"
"A sloppy pour yielded half a glass of beige head. The beer is burnt amber colored. There is not a lot going on with this beer. I get some caramel malt on the nose and a little bit of citrus hops. The taste is caramel malt. That's about it. This is a simple beer that goes down easy, but if you want a lot of taste this isn't for you. I'm not sure why it's a Christmas beer. It seems like an everyday drinker."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp amber with a thin khaki head. Aroma is a nice amount of burnt caramel malts. The taste is smooth caramel malts with slight sweet fruits and a hint of cinnamon. The beer is fairly light bodied with mild carbonation. This is a decent Winter beer, but it seems like beer that could be enjoyed year-round."
"Bell's calls this ""a malt driven ale"" and that is exactly what you get. This is a very drinkable beer and does not rely too heavily on spicing to trick up the beer. Those looking for a unique experience will be let down. Bell's always makes solid, reliable beers and this is no exception. I rather enjoy the simplicity of this ale and would appreciate its humility after drinking some of the more powerful Christmas ales on the market!"
"Overall this beer was very drinkable and having a couple of pints just may be what the doctor ordered on cold winter nights. Bell's did the exact opposite of what most breweries do for Christmas Ales and it works well for them"
"Drinkability: Decent and is more inline with what I expect from a Christmas Ale, though I was not expecting it from what the back of label and brewery website said. It is a Scottish Ale with a tiny bit of edge."
"Tastes solid but unexceptional. The malt is crisp--fresh, yet lightly fruity, like they may have added some orange zest. The hops are european, dry and lightly bitter, and the malt really isn't biscuity or sweet. It's blotted out by whatever the fruitiness comes from."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and a definite session beer. I'm not sure why it's called ""Christmas Ale," but it's a nice well-rounded brew when you're in the mood for knocking a couple back."
"Overall - I would buy again and wouldn't mind sharing with some friends during the Holidays."
"Clear rust colored body, and gentle but steady carbonation greeted me after the pour. The aroma was surprisingly hoppy for a Scotch Ale. I was happy with the distinctly citric that the smell indicated. The taste was unfortunately much too watery for the style, and lacked both the malt backbone and the peaty character. The beer was thin and wispy on the palette, and a bit unsatisfying. It was very quenching and gulpable, but not appropriate for the intended use as a winter seasonal."
"D- Very drinkable and well balanced. It wasn't what I expected for something called Christmas though. It was just a nice ale."
"I'm a little baffled. Not used to mediocrity from Bell's. No hint of a skunk. According to their site they're looking for a ""sessionable"" Christmas Ale. Guess they hit the mark and that's all."
"Pours a deep copper, sort of reddish color. Good head, about an inch thick, some degree of carbonation. Smells of some toffee like malts, some mild hop aromas, and a slight soapiness? Smells is not quite as aromatic as I'd hoped. Hmm, taste is kinda weird, almost reminded me of a fruity grape, flavor at first? It is not what I'd expected, not bad, but not necessarily malty. Let me try this again, some roastyness in there, caramel malts, a clean palate cleansing hoppiness. I can see where people are saying this isn't like a scotch ale, not anything like I am expecting from the style. The mouthfeel is kinda thin too. Hmm, not a bad brew, but off in some way. Not smokey, or peat-like in any Scotch Ale sort of way, not spiced like some Christmas beers, and not even necessarily that malty or that hoppy!? WTF? Glad I bought this in a single, and not a six pack. An interesting experiment of a beer, but not a something that great or worth repeating. Bell's is a great brewer and brave enough to try things on the fringe, but for something as seemingly simple as a Christmas beer I would say this is sort of a mess."
"It definitely has nice balance and drinkability. You should never refuse one of these."
"D: This is a decent beer but I think it's miscategorized. I'd say it's somewhere between an APA, IPA, and Amber ale."
"Drinkability -- Not a bad beer, but very far from the mark stylistically. Gentle malt sweetness tempered by euro-style hops lends itself to being consumed in succession. Good beer, very drinkable, but a Scotch Ale it ain't!"
"D- Pretty easy to drink, could be a session beer though not my favorite really. It is good but I would like for more to it, it really is quite tame and mostly just sweet maltyness. Also not my favorite style of beer either but overall still an enjoyable brew"
"Notes: Batch 10022. I like this, but I don't love this. It is a nice Scotch Ale, but isn't huge on Scotch flavors. Plenty of caramel and toffee malt and nuttiness with touches of spice. It's nice and it works for a winter beer. Overall worth trying, and another solid beer from Bells, but it didn't wow me. Still worth a try though."
"Age does nice things to this beer. But again, this isnt how I remember it, recipe tweak?"
"Drinkability: Pretty good balanced English/Scottish style ale. Like a more malt driven Bitter. Definitely drinkable but seems a little out of place for the season."
"Pours a dark amber color which was kind of surprising. There was a very large head on this beer that stuck around for quite a while leaving nice lacing on the glass. Smells very malty, with some dark malt notes and some caramel. The taste is creamy and malty. There are definitely caramel notes, and a hint of some roated malts. Some of the flavors were a little bit light. The mouthfeel was pretty good. Went down smooth. Nice creamy texture, with the body being a little bit on the lighter side. Drinkability was decent, I think it will be a good beer for christmas. I think its a nice christmas beer since a lot of the ones I have seem to be a bit over spiced. This one was nice though. Good job Bells. Cheers."
"drinkability is good, but this one is fairly average."
"dark amber in color with a nice layer of off-white carbonation. biscuity pale malts and a generous dose of caramel, red apple, some grainy sugars balanced by an earthy hop aroma, more sweet grain complexity develops as it warms to room temp. carbonation delicate, around moderate level, medium bodied. pale malt base with heavy strokes of caramelized toffee, on the sugary side but balanced with a mostly benign English varietal hop flavor that gives a moderate bitterness, a touch of butter lingers"
"This is a pretty drinkable brew, even when it is in the 90s outside with Florida summer showers. Good beer."
"Nice, clear, caramely color. Nice head with sticky lacing. Aroma is light, not really overly inviting or exciting. Can pick up on the yeast character and malt. Medium mouthfeel with light toastiness. Finishes just fine."
"D: I just sorted my Scottish ales and was reminded of Abbey Wright's Smokey Oak (mmmm, the best Abbey Wright beer ever). This is no Smokey Oak but it works in bad weather."
"D: very drinkable and a pretty solid beer."
"D- I wouldnt call this a christmas ale. Its almost a summer beer for me. Like Id drink it after I mowed the lawn or something. Id drink it again but not gonna rush to the store to buy it."
"Libation: I must admit it doesn't scream Scottish Ale. Very drinkable, but kind of average in almost every area. Goes down easy, but not memorable."
"M/D - Pretty good brew out of bells. For sure not a hopslam or Batch9000 but of course different brews all together, not comparing but noticing. I like the idea that Bell's can go to a very strong brews and turn it down a couple of notches to create a very drinkable seasonal and on the edge of a session able brew. I would recommend you pick some up and try for yourself."
"A very nice, neat beer."
"Body a little lighter than I expected. Appropriately carbonated. Pretty smooth, easy drinker. Just not a very exciting one."
"This beauty from the Ohoove cellars looks cloudy rust colored with a decent off-white head and solid lacing. The aroma has a big earthy malt, maybe peat and allspice and banana clove. Very nice. The first taste brings a ton of carbonation with bright grassy hops and light toffee malt. It's mid to light bodied. The hop bites the tip of the tongue with just a hint of clove. It's very angry with tiny bubbles. I get some apple mash and a bit of belly warmth. Overall a good if unspectacular brew but also not evident of any traditional holiday characteristics. Drinkable enough, just wish it tasted as good as it smelled."
"D: Yes. Due to the mouthfeel."
"D - This is a nice Christmas ale. I always like it when a Christmas ale isn't just a winter warmer."
"This certainly smooth and easy on the palate--good stuff. I would love it if Bell's dumped in a few heaps more of malt to take this from nice to very impressive. It's nice now, but ramping up the malt would make it a must-have Christmas beer."
"Drinkability is nice - well balanced and flavorful, though the pungent quality could use a bit more time to mellow out."
"I had this on-tap at Mellow Mushroom on Polaris Parkway in Columbus, OH."
"A pretty unique brew from Bell's. I don't think this is my cup of tea, but it was good to try."
"Easily drinkable, overall a solid beer, but I don't think it really fits the style, seems closer to an ESB mixed with and American Pale Ale, not the sour and bitter character of a Scottish Ale."
"D- Very sessionable beer with no negative qualities. The only thing I can think of is why they call this beer a scotch ale. When I think of scotch ale, I think of Dirty Bastard which is a lot more powerful than this one. Odd...maybe it's a mild english style?"
"I found this to be a pleasant beer to drink. It's supposed to be a Scottish Style ale, but it doesn't have a lot of the characteristics associated with one. I enjoyed it, but it isn't something I'd go out of my way to get. Then again I could see this being a good anytime beer."
"Definitely worth a try, but definitely a strong one to finish. A Christmas treat for sure, but I'm not exactly in love with it."
"The Xmas ale pours a mahogany color with a frothy white head. Lots of lacing lines the glass. Smell is mostly caramelized malts with hints of green pines. Taste is simple but refreshing with a nice hop characteristics for a scottish ale. Lots of malts are also noticeable. Mouthfeel is fairly rich and for the season a great brew to sip several down. Only thing it is missing is maybe some christmas spices."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkabilty: This beer feels good in the mouth, but it's on the verge of being over carbonated. This beer is very drinkable."
"Light/medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink, altogether a decent winter brew and worth a try."
" Beau"
"Beautiful copper/orange body with a slight haze topped with a thick, dense, long lasting head. In fact, the head seems to last as long as the beer is in the glass - which isn't long on many of these I've opened this year. Aroma has a hint of malt but is mostly clean. Not much going on. Flavor also has a lot of malt sweetness, but there's also some bitterness and slight mandarin orange note. Nice, but not what I'd expect from a Scottish ale. Body is also average for most ales, a little light for a Scottish ale. Drinkability however is very good. Stylistically - throw this out the window. But by all means, get yourself plenty of this. Looks beautiful, tastes good, drinks easy. Perhaps an ideal winter session beer."
"D- im not sure id call this a scottish ale, but im also unsure of what i would call it. definitely a unique take on the christmas seasonal. i might check this one out again next year but probably wont before then."
"D: I call this something akin to an APA, and a tasty one at that. Bell's makes a consistently high-quality product, and here's another indication of that. Not one to stand out and be noticed, but it's excellent all the same."
"D - I was expecting a much more malt forward, winter warmer style but everything about this beer is extremely pleasant. However, if this is honestly supposed to be a scottish ale it's much too belgian slanted and sweet."
"Overall it's pleasant flavor and easy to drink but not something as special as I was expecting from Bell's. A fairly average offering."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium to medium-light body and medium carbonation. Rather dry."
"Subtle hints of cinnamon and nutmeg in the aroma, a hearty quaff adds malt with a raspy wood finish. Nothing Scottish about this brew, nor does it pack enough punch for a Xmas ale. And when you add in the over $10 a sixer price, this will not make it back to my DBF anytime soon (or later)."
"I could drink a bunch of these, especially on Christmas. But I wouldn't pay more than $20 for a case of this stuff."
"M,D- A light scotch ale, not very roasty, above light bodied with medium carb, leaves a small crispness on the buds but goes down smooth. Not spicy at all, it wont overwhelm anything. Easy drinking and small alcohol. This is good, it's just not memorable."
"D - Easy drinking holiday ale overall. Although a little weak in the aroma department, I was pleased that the flavor of this brew wasn't too overly spicy, like many Christmas beers tend to be. While this wasn't too terribly exciting, it was enjoyable overall."
"D - Not all that Christmas-y but it is darn good. A mellow and smooth beer with a little crisp bite to the end that smells, looks, and tastes good."
"Smell of some very faint spicing and light maltyness. Really nothing stands out. Taste is also light with some grainy malt flavors and if you try real hard you can pick up some very faint spiceyness. Too thin on the mouth with really nothing to bite into. Overall this one is a letdown. Was a little better on tap but still nothing special."
"A big disappointment,especially for a beer brewed by Bell's. Absolutely no taste or hint of spices or the flavors associated with Christmas Ales. Weak attempt at a Scotch Ale. Only thing I liked about this beer was the design of the label. Would not buy this one again."
"I don't know that I would even come close to calling this a ""Scottish Ale"". I wold maybe lean toward a red ale. On another point, if it is categorized right then it is way too thin and light, even for a light export. The diacetyl was a definate deal breaker as well."
"Drinks pretty well, but even though this is a Scottish, I like something a little heavier for my Christmas Ales."
"This beer pours a hazy copper color with a tall white head. It has a notable amount of carbonation...more than necessary, really. The aroma is initially faint, although a distant herbal hop smell presents itself after the brew warms. The taste is mostly dry, with a resiny and slightly astringent character. It has a pale malt flavor, along with some wood and hops. It's not as malty as it could be, and the exceeding dryness could use something to balance it. Hops come forth more and more through the experience. It's okay, but a bit of a let down."
"Overall just another malty beer. The only thing christmas about this beer is the tree on the lable."
"This poured a clear copper with moderate light tan head. It smelled like sugary malt and nutty malt with some strange artificial fruit and perfume. It tasted like bready yeast and nutty malt with some sweet strawberry and caramel and bitter copper. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a mild bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very strange taste like artificial sweetener mixed into more traditional Scottish malts. It had good body and was fairly easy to drink, but I just couldn't get into this beer. I wish it had more normal Christmas spices like vanilla, cinnamon, etc."
"Pours a clear rubyish with a decent head and rich lacing. Aroma is like a cherrywood tobacco. Flavor is strong and tobacco-like, like my grandfathers pipe. Cherry and fruitcake, with a solid malt backbone and a woody bitterness. A little phenolic clove develops as the beer warms in the glass, but it is delightfully subtle. Mouthfeel is creamy, emphasizing the sour cherry bitterness. Good."
"Comes out of the bottle clear and coppery with a thick and persistent off-white head. Aroma is malty and slightly fruity and spicy. Malty flavor has spicy undertone, mainly cloves and cinnamon and a fruity touch. Texture is strongly tingly and fairly smooth."
"Could I drink this by the yule log? Yep. Could I drink it at Christmas dinner? Sure. It is balanced enough yet completely underwhelming? Oh yeah. That is a bit of an endorsement."
"D = On the one hand this goes down relatively easily. On the other, it just doesn't draw me back to repeated sips the way some others of the style do. I'd say this is a very decent beer which I would definitely take if offered but with a wider selection to choose form not near the top of my favorite Scottish style ales for a Winter beer."
"D Really pretty good. I found the bottom of the glass within a few minutes. 4.0"
"Drinkability is delivering this beer will be searched out for, I'm in love while the limited release we need to get some down here in Steubenville, I picked this one up in Boardman. Last year it hit Pittsburgh but I missed it sold out everywhere quickly."
"To me, just an average scotch ale that offers little distinction within the category to separate itself from the others. Not one of Bells better beers"
"Very easy drinking beer. I quite like this one and am surprised by the B rating. While not the greatest it is a a worthwhile brew. More of an A- to B+ in my opinion."
"Welll, interesting. Poured with a nice, white, foamy, frothy head and lotsa lace. Color is a very clear medium-to-dark amber. Aroma is malty. Flavor is more hoppy than what I'd expect. Body is thinner also than what I'd expect; ditto carbonation being almost spritzy. Not a bad beer in general, but as a scotch ale, not as much. Still, a good beer and easy drinking. Could be a session beer especially if you're not too demanding of allegiance to style."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a burnt ruby with a good 3 inch, creamy white head. As the beer recedes from my glass, sticky lacing is left all over the goblet. Bell's really knows how to do some head. The aroma is weak, especially for a Bell's beer. Hints of sweet malts, caramel, toffee, and some orange zest. Like others have pointed out in reviews, this really just doesn't set for a Scottish Ale. The flavor is unfortunately very similar to the nose. Caramel, toffee and orange rind. There is also a flavor there that distinctly reminds me of tea Man, I had really high expectations on this one. Really thought it would be big and bold, full of mouth watering toffee, caramel, chocolate, with a good, peaty aroma. Not really any of that. The mouthfeel might be medium bodied, but it seems pretty light for that. Nice carbonation. This beer probably just kicked Sparkling Ale off its pedestal of ""Most Disappointing"" Bell's beer. I love you Bell's, keep bringing the big beers."
"Drinkability: Not too impressive overall, but not at all bad and very easy drinking. I'm not upset about having a six pack."
"D= Not a bad beer, but sort of disappointing. There was nothing about this that ever made me think of it as a Scottish ale, and the spices (usually what sets a Christmas ale apart) were way too meek. Worth a try but I probably won't buy this again."
"Drinkability is fairly decent. A nice ale with a good amount of flavor and complexity."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of hops, citrus (strawberries?), and spice. Seems to stretch the boundaries of what a Scottish Ale can be. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus, slight hops, slight spice, and strong yeast characteristic. The malt is really lacking, which is odd in a Scottish Ale."
"Nice holiday ale."
"Light-medium in body with a mild amount of carbonation. Everything about this beer seemed mild, from the aroma and flavor to the carbonation and body. Certainly not exciting, but far from bad. I could easily drink a few of these, and wouldn't be sad to do so. It's also nice to have a Christmas seasonal that isn't a spicy mess. For the style (Scottish Ale) this beer is great...for my preconceived notions of a ""Christmas Ale," this beer fails."
"This ale is sweet, malty, and yeasty, with no real distinct flavor. The feel is thick and bready and it is very drinkable. It's an enjoyable beer and would be very good on warm days, but it's not what I expect from a Christmas ale. The color is too light and there's no unique flavor. Better Christmas ales also have warmth from higher alcohol content. Bell's Christmas Ale is not enough of a cold-weather sipper to deserve the name."
"Pours a darker amber with a relatively thin head, but what head there is sticks around for quite some time as a thin cap. Smells malty sweet, and with a hint of parrafin and a bit of nuttiness. Fairly light for the style, with a somewht watery grainy sweetness. Lacks depth and firmness, end up a little flabby in the mouth. Not their best effort."
"Drinkability/mouthfeel: Its a nice clean beer which almost seems to taste like Christmas. Very easy to enjoy."
"D: This is an unusual, underwhelming winter seasonal from Bell's. As a Scottish Ale, the flavor profile just seems a little off. This could use a more emphatic malt presence especially. Not the worst beer, but I'm glad I only grabbed a single of this one."
"D: Very drinkable. Not heavy at all - good session beer, but not realy what I think of as a ""Christmas Ale"""
"I didnt like this one at all. Definitely not a scottish ale. Its kind of like a winter warmer, which I really dont like. I would pass on this one. Holiday cheer my ass!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but not exciting or exceptional in any way. I guess I'm being unfair because I expect more from Bell's. There isn't anything wrong with this beer. It just isn't what I look for in a Christmas beer."
"Drinkability: Quite good. Something I could drink any time of the year, not just Christmas time."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is above average, goes down very smooth and creamy. This beer is more drinkable than your average christmas ale because of the less spice and great mouthfeel."
"Pours a mber with a tremendous amount of head. Huge hop smell for a beer that the box says is supposed to be a malt forward christmas beer. The head is still around a few minutes into drinking which is one of the only strong points of this beer. There is plenty of hop flavor making it more like an amber than a scottish ale. I wonder why Bell's is putting it out as a christmas seasonal when a winter warmer or another stout would probably be more apt for the season. A little thick for easy drinking, on second thought its not a bad beer, just not at all what I expected."
"glad i bought a single"
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Bottle conditioned. Batch 9423. Poured a slightly hazy amber with less than a finger of off white head. Malty caramel aroma. Medium bodied. Nice malt base with some more caramel. Bit of a hop bite. Decent beer, more of an amber ale, very drinkable, but nothing spectacular."
"D: I enjoyed the beer, great looking beer with bready malt qualities, but I seek out bigger ales for Christmas I suppose, on to the next ale..."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light for a Scottish Ale. This actually comes off as more of an Amber Ale. I have to admit I'm pretty disappointed with this. For a holiday seasonal I was expecting more character."
"I really like Bell's Brews, and this is another to add to the already delicious lineup. Whatever they are doing works for me. I enjoy everything they do, and this Christmas Ale will go on my list for future purchase."
"D - Very easy to drink and with the abv. low it would be a non-issue."
"Not bad, but also not a standout in any way."
"Cheers!"
"this is a surprisingly different beer, and not one for labels. Simple and clean but delicious."
"I'd say all of that makes for a pretty drinkable beer."
"single from Norm's, Vienna, VA"
"Very drinkable for the style."
"Not nearly the best of this ilk of seasonal brews."
"D= great. While this is not a scottish ale I can't really think of where else it should be. Fabulous taste to this beer and I don't think it gets the credit it deserves. Smooth and delicious."
"D: Very, nice sessionable beer. Might make an appearence at my Thanksgiving table."
"Bell's Christmas Ale is very likeable. A great simple, malty session beer well suited for the season."
"This is a great beer for the season. I would probably drink it year-round if available. I hope no one passes it up based on the okay overall rating. If I wasn't rating within style, I think my score would be higher - more like a rye beer to me than a Scotch. Cheers!"
"Overall,very smooth, creamy and tasty. Would make a fine session beer-A bit surprising that this is considered a Scotch Ale, but whatever the style, it's a tasty offering."
"D - Moderate drinkability. ABV is manageable. Sweetness isn't overwhelming. Not filling. Does have a solid warming effect, good for winter."
"(D)- Good, but was expecting something more than this. A great session beer, but definitely not what I thought this would be. Didnt think this was a scotch ale until I looked it up. . . definitely doesnt smell or taste as such :/"
"Drinkability- An easy drinker with its low ABV... glad to have sampled such a unique brew."
"Overall this is a solid low ABV scotch ale. Worth a shot."
"A good but fairly bland Scotch Ale. There's nothing particularly wrong with this beer, but it also fails to provide much excitement. The beer pours a murky medium amber with a spattering of particulates and a medium head/lacing. The aroma is subdued. There's light caramelized malt with touches of spice and apricots/apple. The flavor is similar and similarly fails to provide any really interesting notes. A Scotch Ale needs more punch than this one provides for me to find enjoyment. This beer tastes more like a watered down Scotch Ale. It's not bad, just fairly bland and middle-of-the-road for the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Nice and malty overall. Still the flavor is just a bit too mild for me and I guess I'm not personally a big Scotch Ale fan. I was happy to sample it but it doesn't make me want to grab another. If you're a malt lover check it out."
"Translucent, muddy amber color with a rocky, fizzy cream head that has sticky clumps and rings of lacing and nice retention. As promising as the appearance is, the aroma is comparatively lacking. Grainy, toasted malt, biscuit, occasionally light fruit, all very mild, while not expecting this to be a bomb of a wee heavy, this doesn't resemble much of anything in the aroma. Medium body with light, fluffy carbonation and slight hop bite in finish. Not as heavy or thick as expected for a true scotch ale, but pleasant, nothing to complain about. Flavor has large caramel malty backbone, slightly fruity sweet, yeasty flavor. Not... bad, but even for not expecting this to be a true scotch ale somewhat disappointing. All that said, still a pleasantly drinkable beer and tastes much better to me at start of summer than it did in middle of winter."
"Drinks pretty easy not as much to the beer as i thoght there mibht be."
"I honestly don't know what to think about this beer. It's really not a Christmas Ale and it didn't taste like a Scotch Ale to me either. I don't know what it was. I probably should have had this beer during the Christmas holiday instead of early May, but I fully doubt I would have liked then. Bell's makes some great beers, but I would pass up this Bell's beer."
"D - Somewhat drinkable. Took me a while to polish this one off because I didn't want to drink it that much. Not enough flavor."
"D: Quite drinkable. Much better on tap than in the bottle. I'm looking forward to having this one again next year."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It is April and not December, so that may have an influence in my ratings. That or I just enjoyed the beer. I highly recommend, but at the regular price, it is spendy. I got this on clearance which was great."
"Batch 8802. Pours a dirty, hazy medium brown and smells of fruity spiciness. The mouthfeel is on the high end of medium while the flavor is decently so-so. It's got a wide range of flavors but finishes kind of alcoholy. It's an alright brew but not the best holiday one out there."
"I easily achieve three fingers of light tan caverness bubbles that turn rocky as they slowly fade. Scattered blobs of lace are left. Body has sharp tones of ruby and brown. Nose has an invigorating phelonic spice profile up front. Followed by carmel malt and a splash of vanilla. Enters the mouth with a toasty feel and a soft peppery dusting. Now the richness of the malts never truly develop as I would expect for the style. There is a bit of a earthy, woodsy hop feel that peeks through on the end of the palate. The mouthfeel is left with a hint of the pale spices and slight bitter. This beer is very easy to drink but overall falls short for me."
"Eric"
"very easy on the eyes this one is, but i think i was expecting mopre oomph from a christmas ale. nose is rather light, but exhibits some nice cereal, grain, brown sugar and hop notes. everything comes together in a fairly well balanced way, but the taste just isn't all i'm used to with bell's products. especially their one-off lines. i definitely wasn't expecting a hop monster or anything, i just assumed htere would be a little peat or smoke or just something i can't put my finger on that isnt' there. good beer, but i don't think i'll seek it out next year unless they do some fine tuning."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Feel is medium-heavy on this brew. Carbonation is low as not to interfere with complexities in flavor. The beer itself is slick on the palate and goes down easy with a real nice finish. This is one that I'll gladly be picking up again. Before I took a critical look at this beer I had absolutely no intention of drinking it again, I felt as though this was a big let down from Bell's. This is not so, just take a minute to really dive into this beer, there's more there than you think...be sure to drink it at the correct serving temp, as drinking it too cool will kill its delicacy. Another great offering from Bell's."
"This is an OK beer but I am not sure if it is a wee heavy. Give it a try and decide for yourself. It might be able to be classified as a Scotch ale but I am not sure. Not really a ""Christmas Ale"" in my opinion. It will be interesting to see if it changes next year."
"The taste is also quite citrusy. This could be a malty, underhopped pale ale. It tastes unlike any Scotch Ale or Wee Heavy I've had. Sweet, toasted malt with some alcohol. Somewhat yeasty with a mild spiciness to it. The finish is dry and contains the majority of the bitterness. Some alcohol is present once again, and the citrus is still there."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet caramel maltiness. In the taste, sweet malt, nice presence of caramel and a nice bitter all the way through. A bitter and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, piney hop in the aftertaste. Nice hop presence and nice maltiness."
"Medium body, with a good dose of carbonation. Very easy to drink. While I wouldn't call this a wee heavy personally, it is a good beer. I am not sure how this beer ties in with Christmas, but it is worth a shot."
"D - Bell's Christmas Ale is an above average beer, but I'm having a hard time thinking of this as a wee heavy; this might be closer to an American brown. Quite drinkable, but the thinness, hop forwardness, and lack of malt presence render this very different from a wee heavy."
"Taste is mostly of pine needles and fresh grains. Hints of light fruits...golden apples and pears. Quite hoppy upon further inspection, but is balanced well. Not getting much scotch ale characteristics here. A pretty decent beer, but I don't think it is quite up to par with the rest of Bell's stellar lineup."
"Notes: see first paragraph."
"D - Overall this was quite dissappoint from a brewery that I typically have a lot of respect for... You can't hit a homerun everytime, but this was more a foulball off of their foot... Sorry Bell's, but it's the truth... The worst part is that there is nothing that I can grasp that leads me to believe that this is in fact a Wee Heavy... By far the most dissappointing Christmas brew of this holiday season..."
"Christmas Ale should be renamed Summer Scottish Ale. That way, Mr. Bell can give us the *real* Christmas Ale next year. You know, the 8.0% beast that is packed with smoke and caramel malt that melts in the mouth like warm toffee. Now that would be a beer worth drooling over."
"date consumed: 12 Dec 2008"
"This holiday beer is still quite drinkable. The holiday spice does not overpower this ale like most do. Still a decent beer, but not one of Larry Bell's finest."
"All in all, not a horrible brew, but not one I'd seek out again. Glad I tried it, but that's about it. It's labeled as a scotch, but between the lightness of body, lightness of aroma and flavors, and the odd fruit and spice flavors creeping in, it doesn't really fit the style all that well. All in all, a fairly disappointing brew that was far from satisfying."
"D-A brew appropriate for a cold night indoors (or outdoors, I suppose). As far as Scotch ales go, though, it seemed perhaps a bit too small on the flavor and aroma. Overall, enjoyable but lacking."
"This is very drinkable and very tasty. Nice American version of a scotch ale."
"Of all the Bell's Beer I've tried, i probably liked this one least (by far). Poured a medium amber color with a thin head that went away quickly. Aroma consisted of light malt, not a whole lot there, especially for a Christmas Ale. Tasted like malt and candy sugar, a little cloying."
"D: When I ordered it, I assumed I was getting a winter warmer. But scotch ales are one of my favorite styles, so I didn't mind that it wasn't. Yet it didn't really taste like any other scotch ales I've had. Not sure what category I'd have put it in. Nevertheless, probably would get it again."
"Pours a cloudy amber. I expected a little darker for a Scotch Ale. The smell was very faint. Sweet bready aroma and some yeast in there as well. The taste was nothing like I expected. Not the usual raisins and figs you expect. Actually, it wasn't much of anything. The mouthfeel was far too light for the style. Not a good beer and I will not be buying again. Big dissapointment."
"The drinkability is pretty decent, but not something I would look to drink much of - it's just not that great of a beer."
"My favorite beer appearance is a reddish/golden look and this matches up perfectly. Nice froth on the poor, not too much lace left behind, and an excellent ale aroma. A nice beer that tastes like a beer, something I'm always looking for."
"On-tap at Three Squares. Appeared a very hazy amber with no head. The aroma and flavor are heavy on phenols and a I get whiff of medicine at first. Later more fruit, like cherries, comes out, but the medicinal phenols rule. Frankly I had no idea this was a scotch ale, I took it for an odd Belgian. It was drinkable to the point where it wasn't hard to finish, but I wouldn't order another. I think this beer needs a little more work."
"The aroma is hay like with some earthiness. The taste is also very earth like and sweet. It has fruity bitterness to it with a little bit of spice. The aftertaste has some citrus tones. The body's color is cloudy with a copper color. The head is thin but there is a lot of lace to make up for that. Both the head and lace are tan in color. I sloshed this beer as I poured it and there was still only a minimum head. Overall I would have to go with decent."
"D, notes: A boring beer. If you're going to call a scotch ale a Christmas Ale you need to come with some robust flavor - this doesn't."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer that is perhaps a tad mislabeled. I'd consider this closer to a bock than a Scotch Ale -- it's not high enough in alcohol or thick enough to justify the label its given. Not a lot of complexity, but a great flavor that makes it worth picking up."
"Drinkability is so-so. If it was christmas eve then maybe but not an all day beer."
"D - This is a tasty and drinkable scotch ale w/ plenty of flavor in respect to the moderate abv. The hops are pretty tasty but slightly more upfront in the flavor. Overall I find the drinkability of this to good and this is a pleasant Christmas offering"
"D - I find this to be a very easy drinking beer. It doesn't have a lot of complexity, but it's nice for relaxing on a winter's night. I also believe this should be categorized as a Scottish Ale, not a Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy. It's too light for a Scotch Ale, but as long as you know what you're getting, it's a very good beer."
"Pours kind a rusty/copper color,with a one finger offwhite head. Aroma is complex as it warms,pretty much all malt,caramel,cereal, hints of roasted nuts,and tiny hints at some smoke.Flavor is all over the place,but in a good way,an earthy balance between sweet and dry,caramel, cinnamon,vanilla,honey,cereal, nutmeg,many aromas and flavors going on here but nothong that dominates. Thinner on the mouthfeel than I had expected but very drinkable. I'll buy this again next year."
"Final Thought: Tastes very good in growler form, may suffer in bottle form (low scores)?"
"on the other hand, i find that this is a tasty, uniquely hopped (the star of this ale), red leaning ale. but for the price and expectations, it falls short."
"D - Mild and drinkable, but I really expected more from Bell's. Kind of bland and a bit disappointing."
"I don't say this about a Bells beer, but I was not too impressed with this one. As a scotch ale, it's subpar, but it's still generally a decent beer."
"I don't see myself buying this again, there are just too many other winter seasonals that I enjoy more."
"""Quite a festive affair it was, what with the smoking outside and the dances all night... the biscuits and bacon went really well, did you notice some honey dripped on mine? The taste was interestingly delicious. I heard of better parties that selfsame eve, though... I heard there was one at the ""old chubby pub," and another down where those dirty bastards always hang out... still, I'd go again. A good time was had by all, and I'd certainly bring you along with me if you like a wee bit of a scottish evening."""
"D- Easy drinker for sure. Different compared to most brews of the season."
"Pours a slightly murky bright orangish gold with a medium persistant white head. Aroma is hoppy- citrusy, and sweet with a bit of bready yeastiness. Taste has a nice clean malty character. Moderate sweetness with some light fruit notes. A bit of citrus hop flavor and low bitterness. Medium bodied. A very drinkable and pleasant beer."
"Pours a clear amber with bright red highlights and some floaties. Two fingers of frothy cream colored head has good retention and nice lacing. Smells of sweet malt, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, citrus, and dry grassy hops. Tastes of caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, lemon, fruits, biscuit, a touch of cocoa powder, light scotch notes, and a subtle dry grassy pine finish. Medium in body and full in carbonation. Smooth and sweet with a good balance and lots of flavor. A little odd at first for a ""Christmas Ale"" but it doesn't take long to get used to it, and the Christmas spices put a nice spin on the style."
"D - Merry Christmas!"
"I picked up a bottle at Cloverleaf in Royal Oak, not wanting to commit to a 6-pack until I tried one first. The beer sort of light colored for a scotch ale, darkish yellow with a 2-finger head. The smell is malty with a little, very little, hops fruitiness. The taste is toasted and malty, with a really nice fruit after-taste. I could drink quite a few more of these just for the after-taste, so good. I'm getting a 6-pack before Christmas, and recommend the same to everyone else."
"Overall, not a scotch ale. But a recommended winter warmer."
"This beer was not at all what I was expecting. I was looking for a stronger ale with a darker color and more intense malt profile. For a wee heavy (if that is what it really is, because I'm not convinced) this is quite light. I don't mind cloudy beer from some loose sediment if the beer is naturally conditioned. Based on the sharp feel of the carbonation in this beer, I would have to guess that it was force carbonated, so the sediment is not really welcome. The carbonation really took away from the nice, delicate malt flavors of this beer and was very distracting. Not a bad beer, but I think it could be done much better, or maybe its just a bottle thing. I'd like to try it fresh on tap."
"Not a bad beer and pretty good."
"Quite enjoyable, and readily drinkable, it's a bit of a mini malt monster that's well balanced by hop bitterness, and well-accentuated by a wide range of mild yeasy and hoppy flavors. Nicely done!!!"
"Average drinkable beer."
"If this is really a Scotch Ale, it is a different interpretation of that style than I am used to."
"Drinkability: A very smooth and easy drinking beer. This is a good beer if you want to sit down, relax by the fireplace, and drink a few. Not overly complex nor is it very filling. A nice session beer. It is what it is, and I was disappointed."
"One of Bell's few misses. That said this is a completely drinkable beer...I'm a little miffed that it is not a very good example of a christmas beer or scotch ale. I know Bell's can do better."
"D: High drinkability because it seemed very easy to drink, but takes a hit because the flavors are muted and mild and nothing sticks out as ""real tasty"""
"Really unimpressed by this beer. I bought it even after seeing a few negative reviews just because Bells is a brewery who I tend to give everything that they put out a try. Generally one of my favorite breweries just didn't get it right here at all. Its a mix of christmas spice, citrusy zest and belgian yeast that just never identifies with anything and really just is not enjoyable. While not a drain pour definitely not something I'd ever go back to."
"Feel was tight and gritty with a wierd yeasty chalky-like texture that didn't make the taste any better. Maybe its biggest downfall was how strangely dry while trying to stay smooth and malty just never pulled thru and seemed very messy and undrinkable."
"""Malt driven Scotch ale"" does not describe this beer at all."
"Hazed copper colour with a fluffy, light beige cap that really lasted. Dense head of fine bubbles, streaky lacing. Musty aroma up front, then a bit of lemon and herbal hops. Malt was hiding in the background, a bit biscuity. Dry yeast smell. Moderate bitterness that lingered into the finish. Yeasty, bready flavour followed by herbal hops and a spiciness that was just short of acrid. Sort of fruity too. Herbal character lingered, along with a bit of lemon. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, but had a weird dryness in the finish. Drinkability wasn't great, but I was able to finish it without too much trouble. This one was all over the place and didn't come together at all. I'm a big fan of Bell's and enjoy many a Christmas beer at this time of year, but this didn't work for me."
"Although Larry Bell himself defines this is a ""malt-driven Scotch Ale"" on the label, I'm not sure I get that out of it. Seems more like a Winter Warmer to me...or maybe somewhere between the two. But hey--styles, shmyles...this is a worthy beer, regardless of how it's categorized."
"Bell's has an interesting and pretty impressive Christmas release here. I prefer this to the Winter White release. It is a step overall, especially in terms of style in my opinion. Certainly recommended."
"a nice addition to bell's portfolio, mmm"
"the hop contributes a blackcurrant and very spicy character. the malt here falls short of interesting. some caramel malts, but...meh"
"Overall this was not what i was expecting. It was more pale and less spiced than your typical holiday seasonal. I can see how such a departure could be of interest, but this attempt fell short. Wouldn't have called this a scotch ale in a blind taste test either. Overall I was not impressed and happy that I only bought a single of this batch."
"This goes quciker than expected - a little hefty but more sessionable than expected. Not as bountiful of a flavor profile as other Bell's products sampled to date but decent nonetheless."
"D: High marks here. Although only 5.4% ABV, this feels pretty full. Highly sessionable brew. Would be great to drink all night while playing euchre."
"I could drink quite a few of these. Though light, it is interesting, with good body and a nice mellow sweetness."
"Drinkability: Can't see much reason in drinking mroe than the one I tried. No offense to Bell's because I still think they're an awesome brewery and I will always be a fan of the Two-Hearted, but this just fell really short for me."
"Pillowy head on top of a burnt orange body with a dust of sediment - looks similar to celebration but with a little less lacing and ""glow."" Earthy aromas with hints of smoke and hops. Lots of pleasant buttery toffee flavors infused with caramel. Taste is definitely malt-forward with a twist of belgian yeast. A touch of ester fruitiness, but just in the background. More smoke in the taste, but very subtle. A little bitterness near the finish helps to balance. I like the Scotch Ale classification on BA, but a bit more light and drinkable than the heavy Wee Heavy ales that I have had. Very solid Christmas ale. Really gives off good holiday vibes. Further solidifies my feeling of Bell's brewing superiority."
"Not a hugely complex ale like most holiday season products, but its flavors keep it interesting and with a 5.4 % ABV you could drink several at one time. Bell's always offer something interesting and unexpected (think about their winter white ale - a wit style ale usually ubiquitous in the summer)."
"Bitter dry hops and toasted malt dominates the flavor, with a tobacco and tea leaf finish. Very mild phenols present, lending a little clove or pepper also. One was enough for me in this case. It didn't really have the peat or richness I like in a Scotch Ale. This is a lighter rendition, but also fairly bitter. Worth a try, I was glad to find a single of this new Bells beer at Vrai Amour in Chicago."
"Poured to a nice head that had some big bubbles. Head was slightly offwhite in color with a slight reddish tint. Ale was light brown in color with lots of stuff floating in it. Head hung around a while. Had some nice lacing that left rings with every swallow. Smelled of malt, hops and a little citrusy. Had that dry hoppy flavour, along with malt and a slight pine. Left the last ounce in the bottle and swirled it around to get all those nice tastes out of it. Felt good in the mouth and carbonation was about right. Would love to make a session out of this ale. Will buy again and maybe a session with this brew is in my future."
"A great session beer!"
"D: Again, not bad, but definitely not what I expected."
"The taste is malty and medium bodied and although a great beer, it is a bit unremarkable for a Scottish ale in my opinion. With that said I think this is a great beer to share with family and friends around the Christmas holiday."
"Drinkability: Another nice selection from Bell's. The particulate bothers me a little, maybe they rushed this one to market?"
"I've had better from Bell's. Truly not a fan of this one."
"I'm generally a fan of Bell's beers. The look and pour fit the bill of my past experiences--rich in amber color, nice head. The smell was a faint spice that this reviewer could not place. The beer was smooth going down, but its flavor was rather bland and nondescript (a touch of toasted malt and sweetness). It's easy to drink, but why bother?"
"D- This was nice and malty, but lacked some characteristics usually enjoyed in scotch ales. As it is though, it's pretty drinkable."
"Very excited to try this puppy. It pours a beautiful dark red, nice for the season. The smell has notes of figs, lots of malts, caramel, some berry notes like cherry. The taste is very warming, thick fruit and backgrounds with mild spices blending well in with the caramel malts. I really liked this beer, it's in my top three favorite winter warmers without a doubt. Grab while you can!"
"The bottom line for me is that Bell's needs to either run with this ball or just forget even coming to the field. MI is full of breweries that are putting out top tier Scotch Ale style product (Founders and Arcadia both come to mind) and this doesn't hold a candle to either of those."
"Bell's Christmas Ale is mild and light medium-bodied with plenty of carbonation and a feel that sloshes it's way toward ""watery"". Not in any way a bad beer, but in no way a good one either. Unremarkable."
"Perhaps not what I expected but I liked it well enough."
"Eh, this was a bit of a let down. I really like Bell's beer, but this one wasn't up to par. For me, it was more of a Scotch Ale light, or if one of the Macros tried to make a Scotch Ale, this is what I would think of. There was no pronounced presence of malt at all. It was just lightly placed with the light hops. Nothing more, nothing less. I would pass on it again."
"Addendum: The more I drink this beer, the more I am convinced it is poison. It has this terrible acrid/chemical burn in the back of the throat long after you've drank it...something I have not experienced with even the worst swill."
"Pours a rusty, ruby amber with bright copper highlights. Great two finger head after the pour that recedes to a lovely thick skin of foam that lastst the whole twelve ounces. Great bubbling too. Very faint note of spices in the nose that add a nuancing glaze to the dry tasted malt nose. Toasted whole grain bread starts the taste,then a some spearminty hops come in the middle. The finish is a spicey herbal note. Hints of cardamon and even a little cinnamon play with the minty hops and bready malts. Pretty hoppy for a Scottish ale. Bready and grist in mouthfeel. Good mix of flavor, hough I don't think it falls under the Scottish ale category."
"Mouthfeel is fairly rich and soft, very smooth. Drinkability is good. This beer does not have really pronounced flavor but serves as a nice warmer and certainly worthy of a second helping."
"D - Not very complex and actually a bit boring. I was expecting more of a hearty winter ale from a terrific brewery like Bell's."
"Now after 5 of these beers into my 6-pack, I am still wrestling with it. The beer takes on the rich, malty flavors, aromas, and textures that a Scottish Ale should, but it seems too well attenuated and carries very little weight on the tongue. The flavors are very firm through the malt flavor with the caramelized toffee, light pungent earthy character. But the malts never give the phenolic rich, heavy toffee, light smoke character that make Scottish Ales worth it. Still, I cannot detract the creamy, well-attenuated malts and relatively clean flavors and aromas. The beer is lightly hopped, but picks up a lot of bitterness and light astringency from the spice additions. The finish is a bit cola-like, but otherwise both sweet and dry with an evaporative quality. A nice beer, but it's nuances are not kicking it for me."
"Man I love a little cheer from the north country,I didnt know they grew hops back in the home state,ya learn somethin new everyday.Poured into a standard pint glass a hazed lighter amber/copper with a nice frothy 1/2 finger white head that left broken lace as it never fully settled.Wow love the aromas,a mix of full sweet malt and spicey hop,with even a hint of winter-like spice to it wich I dont think it has.Toasty and warm up front with some brown sugar and caramel sweetness,and again I get a hint of Xmas spice,a big herbal racey hop finish ends nicely.Wow this beer is rated pretty low but hot damn I love it,another gem from K-zoo."
"Suprisingly light amber pour. Disapating off white head. Some malt, raisin aromas, but more piney/citrus hops than would be expected for the style. Tastes similarly. Finish hop bitter clean. Overall, pretty drinkable, but I would classify this as somewhere between a pale and a scotch ale. I expected more with this style being one I've taken a liking to and Bell's usually producing quality in the traditionally stronger flavored/abv styles. Bell's still has it's standouts, but many of their low gravity style beers are becoming rather mainstream."
"The carbonation was good on this and drinkability was near perfect. An all around good solid beer, although it was just missing something."
"Now the bottle is almost finished, this ale reminds me of their 'Amber' without the toasty or sweet qualities. Bell's went to the opposite side of the holiday seasonal spectrum and gave us a straightforward, well-crafted soft, malty and clean session beer. The back label also reads, '...sure to make any occasion festive'. I won't argue with that. I'd call it the Christmas 'Oberon'. It's non-intrusive and broad reaching without any sharp corners or overly pronounced elements. Although, I doubt I would buy more for myself - but maybe for 'guests'"
"Very good over all and worth a try"
"M + D: A medium, slightly chewy body with a moderate, pleasant carbonation. A fairly easy drinker. I dunno about Scotch Ale ... Scottish Ale seems a little more suitable? Either way, not too shabby, though I'd personally lean towards a little bigger during the season."
"I expected more of this beer. I liked it, but hoped for a good, chewy, strong winter warmer Scotch ale. It's not quite that."
"Amber colored beer out of the bottle with a foamy thin beige head that left lots of sticky lace. Malty nose with a suggestion of peat smoke. Dark caramel sweetness with some smokey malts and dark fruit. A little thin, with too much water in the flavor. I do expect more from Bells. I would not have identfied this as a Scotch ale. Okay enough."
"Significantly hazed copper orange color with a nice tan head that falls slowly, lots of suspended particulates (always a welcome staple of Bell's) and some lacing. Aroma is very fruity. There's some orange, and lemon in the nose backed up by some sweet malts. It has a nice flavor but kind of misses the mark for a Wee Heavy. It's slightly sweet, with a nice bitterness in the middle and slightly dry on the finish. Nice use of hops in this one, but never becomes too bitter for those who like slighyl lower IBU ratings. Caramel coated orange slices is the best way to describe this beer's flavor. It's light-bodied, however, but what it lacks in body is almost made up in the flavor. Slightly creamy, light carbonation. This beer is pretty damn decent but nothing spectacular. I could have gone for a little fuller mouthfeel, but it was tasty and quite drinkable. Another example of how Bell's makes some of the most solid brews around."
"Overall- It was a big surprise, starting with the style classification. It didn't seem ""big"" enough to be considered a Wee Heavy (though Bell's actually only refers to it as a Scotch Ale). Regardless of Scotch classification, I'd expect some peat-smoked flavor and aroma. That said, it's not a bad beer by any means. It reminded me a lot of their traditional Amber Ale. I give Bell's a lot of credit for going with all Michigan grown grains and at least some Michigan hops. I also like their bucking of tradition with both their Winter White and this beer breaking the mold for Winter/Holiday beers."
"D- A very tasty beverage, but not really close to the style. I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would."
"Poured a hazy orange color with a nice head. Overall the small and taste are somewhat lacking for a bells beer. I was expecting more of the normal cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger spice for a Christmas Ale until I realized that it was a Scotch Ale. This is a very drinkable Scotch Ale but I would rather have a Great Lakes Christmas Ale."
"Drinkability: A slight disappointment from Bell's that, while starting off well enough, fell short fairly quick. The carbonation was a little out of whack, the hop notes seemed out of place, and the malt profile a little simple. Tweak this one a little, though, and I'm sure you could get a really interesting, unique, and sessionable brew out of it, as the alcohol is quite low for the style."
"This beer pours a cloudy burnt amber color. The head is an inch and a half in height, rocky, and recedes very slowly into thick, chunky lacing. The aroma is caramel, with a solid fill of herbal hops. The taste is very balanced for a Scottish Ale. There is surely a tone of malt, but there is also a significant amount soft herbal hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and mild carbonation. Overall, this beer is too hoppy for the style, but tasty nonetheless. I would love to see Bell's adding this to the yearly offerings."
"Bottled sample via oakbluff. Orange in colour with moderate carbonation. Surprisingly American C-hop forward on the nose, with notes of citrus and pine along with some smooth vanilla caramel malts in there too. Some odd flavors going on that are hard to pin down. There's definitely a green wood note, along with some odd floral and confectioner's sugar elements. Some moderate malt character provides some stability, but the palate just seems muddled to me. Clean finishing. Not really the Scotch ale or X-mas seasonal that you' d expect, but still fairly drinkable."
"This is a good beer, but definitely not what I was thinking as far as a Christmas Ale goes. It's fine though, some of those holiday beers go overboard on the spices. This is a nice session beer, you could take to a holiday party and everyone would enjoy."
"D- Really easy. Could be a session. Imagine drinking this on a hot..sweaty...wait this is coming out in November? I'm a bit confused about this beer. Its not bad. Its not great. Its just a good beer with an odd seasonal symbol on the package and the name Bells on it which, in Chicago, could sell anything because of its popularity. Hmmm...should have gone with Great Lakes."
"The mushiness carries over into the texture. It's flatish and blah...once again. It's not truly hard to drink, it's just hard to stay interested."
"Amber colored brew. Balanced but unpleasant nose, with hints of biscuit from the malt as well as some grapefruit and lemon from the hops. Flavor is very light, lacking complexity and depth. Nothing even close to a wee heavy. How is this beer not an amber ale?"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The mouthfeel of the beer is just shy of medium. The beer is well carbonated. This is a easy to drink beer. Looking forward to polishing off a few more of these."
"We'll see how this gets once it warms up a bit."
"Pours a hazy amber color with two inches of white head that settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass surface. Has a fruity hop aroma that is a bit unusual for the style and a winter brew. The flavor is also on the hoppy side. Citrus notes with a rather timid malt profile. Has a dry finish. The body is light and a bit overcarbonated. A nice tasting beer but I don't get what the brewer was going for here. Would be better as a summer beer than a winter one."
"Unique and worth a try!"
"Body and texture are decent. Drinkable, but very average creation. Meh."
"A perfect dark golden color. Thin white as can be lacing clings to the glass. Nice fruit like sweetness smell. I immediately questioned if I was drinking a Scotch Ale but I will leave that up to the beer technocrats. Has a solid malty backbone with a soft sweetness. What make this beer great is that something extra that seems to come from the hops and slight carbonation. This no alcohol laced Christmas warmer. A very versatile drink for either a session beer or just for the great flavor."
"Murky looking bronze. Thin beige head. Lacing clings nicely. Aroma is real herbal and nutty. Also fruity. It's smells like a fruitcake. On the palate, there is a very interesting blend of berries, nuts and rum. Again, I'm reminded of Christmas fruit and nut breads. Pretty dry finish. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Most interesting scotch ale I've had. Pretty decent."
"Lightly hazy deep copper with ruddy golden edges. Thick, creamy finger of off-beige head. Terrific lacing. Nose is laced with sugary brown sugar malt, caramel, bubble gum (Double Bubble), and some faint pine hops. Nice. Soft, sweetish caramel and cookie malt up front. Yeasty edge. Some fruit (pear) but mostly rich cookie malt. A hint of smoke and I swear I taste a dash of cinnamon. Blend of modest pine and citrus hops in the finish throws some balancing bitterness into the equation. Medium body with a very creamy, smooth feel. Definitely more of a Scottish ale (a slightly hoppy one at that) than a Scotch ale, and a welcome addition to the phenomenal Bell's lineup."
"drinkability: fine"
"Overall, a balanced and enjoyable beer. Nothing in the beer floored me but it's typical Bell's quality; which is always damn good."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat heavy."
"I think I'll be having a lot of this, this winter!"
"This beer poured a clear reddish amber color and formed an off white foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, slight hint of spices. The flavor was of malt, caramel with a hint of pepper. It has a medium light body and a slightly burnt finish. A good beer, but not one of their outstanding beers."
"Good for what it is and not what it's lable says in my opinion. Thick malt with a bity carbonation and slight glyceryl streak in the middle. Some bittering hops on the finish. Biscuity grains with a hint of red currant fruit. A bit of an odd flavor on the finish? Good solid beer but nothing that stand out and grabs you."
"Not one of Bell's best beers. Kind of wish I would have gotten a single instead of getting so excited and buying an entire six pack. It is a pretty sweet bottle though."
"Taste: Caramel malts, dry hops, and some spicy aftertaste. Not as rich or dessert-like as other scotch ales that I've had."
