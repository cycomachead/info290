"Great beer smooth taste would recommend"

"Maybe I got a bad batch but I recall enjoying this beer more last year.  I remember a more distinctive and pleasant molasses smell and taste.  As a wee heavy, it's not bad but I prefer Dirty Bastard."
""
""
"Overall- more of a wee heavy/scotch ale. It lacks a lot of roasted flavor which a porter should have in my mind, but it does have a nice blend of sweeter/sugary flavors with a nice maltiness."

"Good Porter with the same style and gunn innis that I love"
"Inniss & Gunn take all the characteristics of a solid porter and make it fun with notes of peat, oak and molasses. Nothing mind blowing, just a fun beer showcasing the barrel aging that the brewery is well known for."
"Overall - The flavor did have a lot going on but the heat of the alcohol kind of ruined it. It also didn't seem very well-balanced as the malt flavor kind of took over. I enjoy Scottish ales a lot but this one was a bit over the top. It seems to be on the verge of being a great beer but is not quite there yet. I don't think I would recommend this one."

"I would buy again if in mood for a porter"
"Overall - Another solid offering from Innis & Gunn."

"Final Grade: 3.93, a B+. I&G's Scottish Whisky Porter is a serviceable strong ale, but it's not very porter-like at all - if handed this blindfolded, I'd probably call it a wee heavy, making the BA classification pretty accurate in my view. A little too sweet to be something I'd drink regularly, but still a brew that I could see myself picking up sporadically - which is roughly how I feel about their flagship oaked ale. Fans of that beer (and other I&G products) should find this to be a worthwhile diversion, but if you're not already a member of that group then I can't see this beer changing your opinion of the brewery very much."

"Good smooth beer. Strong. Nice finish."
"OVERALL; As others have noticed, this does not really seem to be a Porter, it's closer to Scotch Ale.  That said, it's intriguing and pretty tasty, with a nice oak/vanilla note dovetailing into the sweet molasses."

"3.11/5: Not great, but at least some of the old I&G bugaboos are being phased out..."
""
"nice, heavy mouthfeel with undertones of both molasses and toffee. Love the beer, reminiscent of sweet potato soufflet on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
"O: Densely flavor packed and complex but marred by the off-fermented taste. Also, like a Cola (which I rarely drink) so sweet, I had to eat too many pretzels to counter it, to finish."
"Sigh, while I could rail on about the lack of any sort of porter characteristics in this offering, that would be putting the cart before the horse.  This may look the part, but in the end, it comes off as nothing more than a typical 'wood aged' strong ale, this time with perhaps a bit more roasted blather.  Yeah, you know how I feel."

"Disappointing.  Was expecting more.  It's just scotch ale and a bad one at that."
""
""

"Well picked this up the other night and was expecting a porter. More towards a scoth ale. Pours a deep red with not much of head. Tasted like a porter gone wrong but good if you are into the scotch ales. Over all it was ok but wont be going at this again."
""
"Where better to bring a new I&G beer than to VDubb's?  This stuff pours a clear ruby-studded sienna topped by a half-finger or so of wan tan foam.  The nose comprises dried maple syrup, oak, vanilla bean, light cocoa powder, very light roasted malts, light vague stonefruit, and a hint of booze wafting in the breeze.  The taste is a blast of oak followed by a cigar wrapped in dank greens and dipped in sweet caramel and maple syrup.  Unlike most other I&G offerings, this one falls apart on the tongue, coming across muddled, confused, and leaving us in a similar place.  The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.  Overall, a definite disappointment here.  It's not a complete train wreck, but it's not very good, either."

"O: not too different from their other beers - flavorful, dry, easy drinking, maybe a bit drier - the roasted elements, though subtle, do make this stand out among the rest... of the 4 I've now had, they seem to shine most at the extremes of color - the lightest (original) and darkest (bourbon stout) have been the best and relatively most distinctive... let's see if that trend continues the more I try"

"Overall â€“ Not really a porter, but more of a wee heavy/scotch ale. It lacks a lot of roasted flavor which a porter should have in my mind, but it does have a nice blend of sweeter/sugary flavors with a nice maltiness. If looking for a scotch style ale then this is a good choice, but if looking for a robust dark porter then steer away. A nice brew, but just not a nice classification."

"Picked up a mixed six of Innis and Gunn beers that included this one. Weak appearance, thin with very little head. Smell, however, was very interesting and had me wondering about flavor. Downer, not good at all. My Scottish heritage had me very disappointed in this beer. Will not have again. Gonna grab the Skull Splitter I have in the fridge next to feel better about the homeland."

"O = I really like this porter, but because of the molasses and 7.4% alcohol, it wouldn't be a regular for me. I think it would food pair nicely with baby back ribs smothered in a sweet barbecue sauce, cole slaw, and a baked potato and/or corn on the cob. Enjoy!"
""
"Overall Ok but not great, somewhat meh, so much going on mix of good and bad, even the barrels have a mix of good and bad. Just a taste for me and probably won't get this again."
"o: I'm not completely overwhelmed but this could really grow on me. Will buy again."
""
"o: A unique brew with a lot of flavor. I prefer their plain rum cask aged, but this is a good winter/holiday seasonal."
"O- A very tastey beer with a unique character."

"I assume the molasses is to provide sweetness and increase the body. Not being very familiar with molasses as a food, I can't tell if it imparts any flavor. Beer sitting in clear bottles under fluorescent lighting has to be suspect!"

"Looks more like a barleywine than a porter dark crimson ruby brown appearance, light khaki tan head forms fine lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma has sweet brown sugar, glazed apple, a hint of spice, alcohol and oak barrel aging effects. The first sip is cloying all day, alcohol burn at only 7.4% that's just sad with a watery beer supposedly aged on oak to ""unlock the flavor"". These guys are brewing half ass beer, so far nothing I've had from them have been nearly acceptable to call this base beer a porter is sacrilege. There's no rounded sweetness this is really harsh on the palate flavor and mouthfeel, watery texture with these big oak character with alcohol levels that are unrelenting for such a modest abv, just unbalanced. Overall a no go for me, it's going to make picking out another Innis and Gunn to try that much harder."

"Overall: I was not particularly keen on it. I was really just hoping for something passable, but, no."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy khaki head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and slight molasses aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet caramel, toffee, and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is very sweet and not too much like a porter in my opinion."
"Taste-Oakey, sweet, toasted malt, some vanilla notes, warming alcohol in the finish. Rather smooth, interesting flavor."
"The taste has a lightly roasted malt character but it is more overwhelmed by the vanilla or molasses. The alcohol could be better integrated because it had a slight boozy feel. No smoke like I like in Porters."

"So I'm reviewing this a porter but I really don't think of this as one. It pours like a dark brown ale with minimal head. Doesn't look like any porter I've ever had. The smell is all sweet molasses which right out of the gate I know this isn't going to work for me since I love true porters and molasses doesn't seem like a good fit. I will say they taste isn't all that bad. The molasses is obviously there with hints of oak and vanilla like there other brews. It does have a small porter bitterness/burnt aftertaste, but you really have to be searching for it. Overall if this was considered a dark ale with molasses I'd think much more of this but since they want it to be a porter I'll rate it as a porter which is maybe a little better than I thought but still nothing I'd buy again."

"O: A nice treat every now and then, as it is definitely on the sweeter side. Very easy to drink while providing a nice complexity. Displays the oak nicely, so it's a good into to oaked beers as well"
""

"My long review was lost after I added it. Shorter version: single finger head, excellent lacing, deep amber body. Aroma of molasses oak caramel, mint, earthy hops. Flavor is similar but less sweet more earthy also with caramel, oak, molasses. Medium body moderate carbonation. Complex and flavorful."

"first to review this beer. wife got there first but couldn't find listing so I get to jump on it. this is an oak aged porter with molasses added. it is good but not one of I&G better offerings. doesn't seem to be as full bodied as our domestic porters. has a nice rich floral smell. can't say that I detected the presence of the molasses."
