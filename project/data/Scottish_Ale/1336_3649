4.04,13.5,4.25,4,4,4.25,4,"Scottish 80 - I like this already. Deep garnet orange in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a light beige foam with medium low retention. Rich, strong malty aroma with toasted and bready malts and light caramel notes beneath. No hop, esters, or alcohol notes. Heavier than medium in body with a slightly viscous feel. Medium drying carbonation through the middle that restrains the maltiness a bit. Light hop bitterness through the middle with no hop flavors. No esters. Surprisingly dry finish considering the balance tips heavily toward the malty side. Overall this is dead on for the style. Easy drinking and incredibly malty. ","IronLover","Feb 09, 2015"

Smell is of sweet caramel and crystal malts, touch of toast, and a bit of smokiness. Bready caramel opens up the palate to notes of raisin, malts, and a grassy bitterness in the finish. A light leathery smokiness is apparent in the aftertaste. Lower carbonation is working well for this beer, but somehow the finish is dry, not sweet like I usually expect. No big deal though. A decent Scottish ale worth seeking out if you want a better example of the style.","DmanGTR","Dec 28, 2012"

Aroma is distant but expectedly sweet and malt-driven. Taste is a bit bland, but sweet and malty, slightly woody, caramel and brown sugar with a touch of dark fruit and phenol. Medium body, fairly smooth and drinkable, with a much tamer ABV than your typical Scottish ale, which is not necessarily a good thing, but I suppose it appeals more to the masses.

Popping the top yields a molasses, honey and caramel smell. Pours to a slightly cloudy dark orange bronze. No head at all, that doesn't seem right. I have more to try and will edit review if there is a change. Taste is brown ale-like with a very dry chaulky hop flavor. Mouthfeel has good carbonation despite the lack of head but it is kind of thin and watery, not much body. Taste is consistent throughout, although the finish is sweeter than the start and middle.

Not too much carbonation, but more than the ABC barleywine. I can taste a bit of hop flavor and some caramel up front. There is an interesting flavor in the finish, perhaps raspberry?

Taste is primarily toffee maltiness, with a dry hop bitterness for good balance. Faint smoky character resembles peat. Not at all chewy, as some have noted.

It was relatively full-bodied with a nice but not overwhelming carbonation. This one was good from start to finish, which caused me to want another.","rdrummer","Jan 11, 2004"
3.44,-3.4,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"The Jolly Scot is a Scottish ale that is dark brown with a slightly reddish tint to it. This beer has no head at all as well as no aroma about it at all. The malt is kind of mild but hold nice and the hops are just as mild as the malt but all blends well in the end. The Jolly Scot is available year round and it is a tribute to the Irish, Scottish & German immigrant that founded the city of Harrisburg where the Appalachian brewery is located in. over all pretty tasty.

2.85,-19.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Slightly hazed ruby/scarlet appearance. Not much of a head on the pour. A thin and slightly bubbly light brown collar encloses the surface of the beer. Nice little subdued sweet maltiness on the nose. Maybe a little herbalness and peat as well. There's a little bit of a harshness on the palate. I'm not sure if it's coming from indgredients (peat malt?) or from a flaw. It's not overwhelming, but not that enjoyable either. Some sweet malty tones are evident as well. And some bitterness, that I'm not assuming would be coming from the hops. Hmmmm. This one's throwing me a little. Nonetheless, it's not one of my favorites.","Bighuge","Oct 31, 2003"
3.58,0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Served as part of a sampler tray at their brewery. I remember enjoying this beer from the bottle earlier in the year and the draft version didnt disappoint either. A very light Scotch ale indeed! This version is more hoppy than malty. I think of a malty beer when I think of a Scottish ale, but this tastes just fine. Nice fruitiness in the flavor, too. In itself, this is a very good and easy drinking beer, although I would like to see a ramped up version of this beer. Maybe the Jolly Scots big brother? Or the not so jolly Scot? hmmm....","pezoids","Jun 07, 2003"
3.72,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A very well rounded scotch ale. This stuff pours a dark red colour with a small, fizzy head. The aromas are of scotch, alcohol, and heavy malts. The taste is very scotch-like, soothing, warm, and boozy. The mouthfeel is heavy, but not overly heavy and the drinkability is damn good.","francisweizen","Beers"
3.06,-14,4,3,3,3,3,"Deep copper body beneath a tan head. Mild, sweet malt aroma with some noticeable fruitiness. The taste is very mild with a somewhat distracting and misplaced bitterness. Malt sweetness pushes through mid-taste. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for a scottish ale, and the drinkability is OK. It's a decent beer, but not all that notable.","aaronh","0"

3.9,9.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Malts dominate with a rich sweetness. Very nice roastiness character joins for a good balance. Toffee really comes in to add a bit more complexity. The body is medium to full with light carbonation making for a very smooth mouthfeel. It is also a pretty good drinker. A few at a time would be no problem. A very nice scottish ale.","ElGuapo","Apr 25, 2003"

On the palate more of the same with a caramel maltiness, bicuity/ breadiness, light fruitiness, and a little on the sweet side as it warms but still very enjoyable. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Nice brew.","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 12, 2003"

4.35,22.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A creamy ivory head rests lazily atop a deep-amber/copper body. It's crystal clear; and very tiny bubbles rise slowly towards the surface. The head retention is good, and although it drops fairly readily, it does maintain a very nice collar and lacy surface covering throughout the pint. The nose expresses a very clean, lightly sweet and caramelized/caramelish maltiness that's touched ever so lightly by a background roastiness. The body is medium/full and it's quite creamy and smooth in the mouth. Caramelized sugars dominate in the round maltiness; but it's also accentuated by a very light fruitiness, a whisp of hop flavor, a cusp of gently acidity from a touch of dark malt, and a sublime bitterness. This is an exceptionally well-done version of an 80 Shilling Scottish ale, and it might even be too clean to be considered authentic! Great drinkability! I'd love to try this cask conditioned. Well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jan 02, 2003"
3.47,-2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was a bit surprised when the barkeep planted my pint of Jolly Scot before me...despite a nice dark, clean red hue, it held a very thin head with practically no noticeable carbonation. There was no apparent lacing, and very little head retention. It looked nice, but kind of flat. The smell was a little more reassuring with a sweet malt and subtle hop hints. The taste held a pleasing maltiness, with a good balance. It was smooth, and full, yet had an almost average overall taste for a Scottish Ale. The Ale was very active in the mouth, with a tingling, prickly sensation. Not too full, decent mouthfeel all around. ABC's Jolly Scot is not a bad Scottish Ale, but I wasn't extremely impressed. I'd gladly down a few of them, but would probably seek out another Scottish Ale if in the mood for the style.","SchmichaelJ","Nov 12, 2002"
3.95,11,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Deep auburn in color with a fairly thick tannish head. Light carbonation noted as the head subsides. Smoky roasted malts dominate the nose. Really good roasted malt taste to match the aroma with a very slight hop bitterness coming through about mid-glass. Decent lace. Overall pretty well balanced and smooth. Thin mouthfeel but overall pretty drinkable.","cretemixer","Nov 05, 2002"
3.92,10.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer has a dark caramel / nut color as it reflects in the glass.  A surprisingly thick head that seems to last.  It drags down the glass as it leaves its lace.  Beige in color.  It has a sweet malt aroma and a slight sweet malt flavor with hints of flower and hops.  Good beer.","Jarod","Jun 24, 2002"

3.95,11,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Yet another solid brew from Appalachian.  This is probably one of my favorites from this Harrisburg staple.  It is nice and dark with a little hoppiness and a slightly sweet aroma.  The head is moderately thick and remains that way for about half the glass until it gets lacey.  A very drinkable bier, this is one to try when you have the opportunity to try the brews from this Pennsylvania brewery.","goindownsouth","Beers"
