"Overall: not real familiar with Scottish ales, don't really dig the style but I can pick up the quality in the beer, I think it's better than ok, could use a bigger mouthfeel, it has a nice aroma and decent flavor, it's worth a try."

"The Verdict: Not bad. A solid Scottish ale, this malty brew goes down smooth. Not the head of the class maybe, but itâ€™s everything it should be."

"Great label and name however, not sure how this got into the scotch ale category from a taste perspective. This is likely to temper my comments. Tasted more like a brown. Very clean pour and taste. Improved as it warmed.Nice looking color but not a lot of depth. Better than ave"

"Drink- I wanted something new at Hooters and this was the best I could get. It was my bad to not ask for a different glass. Oh well. Still like Hangar 24 overall."

"update on 3/30/13: 4 pak is only $3.99 at Total Wine. compared to the $7.99 before, this is a great deal. and it's still flat..."
"O - I like this beer. I had it on tap about a month prior at the brewery and remembered it being a little better, but we'll leave that one for the bottle vs. tap debate. At $7.99 a 4-pack and 6.5% ABV I'll probably seek out other winter warmers that have a little higher alcohol content and come in 6 packs for about the same price (specifically the two mentioned above), but still decently affordable and maybe easier to consume during the day than those other two mentioned. Overall a great beer!"

"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Nice dark and bitterish aftertaste. This must be my favorite Hangar 24 beer. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Bine & Vine in San Diego."
"O: A solid winter beer, but nothing crazily good about it. I enjoyed the effort in the end, but this isn't a beer I would actively seek out."
