"Pours a hazy dark amber color with a big frothy head. The smell is pretty malty with hints of fruit and citrus. The taste is predominately sweet caramel malt with a fair share of hops to make this quite an interesting beer. Overall a pretty good, well balanced beer."
"Unique beer with the same super-high quality known from Odell."

"Really good amber ale. I didn't pour it since I'm a poor college student and I don't have pint glasses, but regardless it was quite tasty. Smooth, clean, and easy to drink, this beer is ideal for nearly any occasion. I highly recommend it."
""
""
"Overall - More of an Amber than a scottish, and their description of the brew reflects that. I dig it. Relatively simple, but full flavored. Try it and like it."

"I found it interesting this is an interpretation of a toned down iscotch ale. Certainly well balanced as far as hops and malts are concerned. A smoky taste of molasses and malts get a pick me up from the zestiness, and crispiness of the hops. Giving the 90 schilling a refreshing mouth feel. Very enjoyable to drink. I would imagine it pairs very well with many types of food as well as it fits drinking as a session. A nice pick me up of a buzz as well. A good selection to make, especially if you have never had the pleasure."

"This is a fantastic ale, goes down smooth and a =m=n awesome flavor."

"Overall: Once again, my sensitivity to hop flavors has me arching an eyebrow at anyone who has reviewed this beer as ""malty"" and mentioned nothing of any hop presence at all. They are literally all I get out of this beer, aside from a brief flash of caramel malt at the outset. Will not repeat."
"Get some."

"this is one of my favorite  styles of beer  and I really do enjoy this one, could use a tad more punch, ABV is around 5, kinda light for this style, plus it very hard to get in my area"
"One of my favorite beers ever."
""
""
"A very good beer. I thought it was going to be heavily hopped, but it wasn't. Nice balance."
""
"This is a good malty drinking beer. Something to session on or have with a meal. Not all that impressive stand alone, but a good session and food pairing brew."
""
""
""
"I do not write reviews."
""
""
"Good. Tastes similar to Rahr's Iron Thistle, but not as flavorful. Still a good beer though."
"O:  very underwhelming ... I expected much more malt sweetness or malt flavor of some kind, but it's mostly corn/grain and rubbing alcohol.  possibly I have a very old six-pack here, but I also figured this malt-forward style would age well.  I hate to rip a beer in a style I'm not well-versed in, but this tastes like one of the many bland blonde ales craft brewers use to lure BMC drinkers -- kind of an all-around dud except for that big, fluffy, sticky head"

"Odell just can do me no wrong.  A fun easy drinking Scottish ale that has fantastic bready character, without getting overly sweet, sugary, bitter, watery or anything.  Odell delivers the goods."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a light, amber coloring, with a fluffy, clingy, bubbly, off-white head. Nose of muted roasted caramel and nut, with earthy highlights. Flavors are roasted caramel sweet, with earthy tones, and hints of char. Smooth, slick bodied, with a roasted, sugary sweet aftertaste. Smooth, slightly cloying finish."

"My first review really should be for my favorite beer, shouldn't it?  This beer goes with every food, it's perfectly balanced, and it's a great introduction to craft beer for those who have never seen the light.  It's closer in style to an amber ale, which might bore some people, but don't let a classification determine what you try.  Beautiful color, not too high alcohol content, not super hoppy, not too sweet, just a fantastic beer.  Will have one of these anytime, anywhere."

"Overall (3.45) : I had a hard time with this one. I truly wanted to give it a raving review but something was just missing for me. So yes, 90 Shilling is an impressive little beer that would be great with a friend and great for a trial run like what I'm doing here. People go crazy over it but I think it's simply a capable beer. After half the bottle I'm about spent with this one, I don't know if I would actually go out and purchase it again - but it is a good full-flavored beer and crafty too. If you're looking for something to wet your whistle, look elsewhere but if you're looking for a bouquet of interesting flavors that make you raise your eyebrow and say ""hmmm"" or ""mmmm", you should give this one a try."

"O: While being somewhat of a malt bomb, this beer is not overly sweet and is quite easy to drink. I really enjoyed this beer though I sometimes find the style to be a little sweeter than I prefer, especially in the hot southern summer. Overall, very well balanced between the sweet and the bitter."

"Bottle poured to a pint glass at the Grand Hyatt lobby in Denver. Pours orange colored, clear, with a creamy off white head on top. Aroma of some caramel and bready malts dominate, with some light floral notes on the back end. Flavor is mostly caramel malts, bready, much like a scotch ale (this is my first ""Scottish"" ale). Finishes OK, with medium body and a bit of juiciness. Medium carbonation. Overall not my favorite beer but my first of the style and certainly not bad."

"Poured into a standard pint. The beer is a clear medium mahogany color with a good finger's worth of foam, nicely white and leaving excellent lacing. The nose offers pleasant malt aroma, but it's a bit faint. Very nice flavor though! It's pretty much entirely malt-based, as you would expect, nice and bready with a little bit of caramel. Finish is sweet, as there's little hop bitterness. The low strength makes it feel much more like the real ale you get in Scotland, than many American micro's interpretations of a ""strong"" scotch ale. Very good beer."

"Good, but after the way it poured and appeared in the glass, then the wonderful aroma....I was pumped! But truthfully, after tasting, I was disappointed. Wouldn't buy it again. I know I'm in the minority here but it left alot to be desired for me. Probably just my palate and not the beer."
"Pours a pretty amber in color with a good finger+ white foamy head. Lots of lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of grainy malt and caramel. The taste is even better with bready malts with a mild hop finish that doesn't linger or isn't bitter. The caramel comes through perfectly. Very tasty and goes down very easy. Perfect carbonation also. A great brew for sure!"

"It's a world class beer!!"

"Overall impression is in line with other beers I've had from O'dells, good stuff."
""
""
""
"This isn't my favorite beer, but I don't want to downgrade it because I think it is exactly what it is supposed to be. Very malty, sweet, very little hops. It has a delicate flavor which I think would really shine if paired with the proper food. Because it is delicate it would easily be overpowered by foods that are bold and assertive. I find myself thinking of adventurous pairings such as cinnamon toast, pancakes or waffles with maple syrup and butter, chicken and waffles, sweet barbecue chicken, sweet corn, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, delicate cheeses, etc. Putting this with the right food could really be the right move. I think it would take it from being an interesting beer in its own right to something really stellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor: This brew has a significant whole wheat breadlike malt presence but is somewhat balanced with a earthy and floral hop bite along with some sweet caramel and toffee."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A well crafted, easy drinking beer. A nice break from all the IPAs and Impy Stouts, more toward a season, if a big one."

"Pours a copper color with a very thin collar and wisps of head at the surface. Aroma is muted malt and a bit bready. Taste is light caramel, very lightly bitter, and some toasty malt. Light to medium body and medium carbonation lend to a decent mouthfeel."

"Pours a clear dark amber color with a fairly small head. with plenty of lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, some caramel sweetness, a bit of fruit and citrus in the background. Taste of roasted malt, caramel with a light touch of fruit. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Medium body, smooth clean and refreshing. Nice rich flavor and well balanced. Enjoyable beer that goes down easy."

"Atmosphere is very nice. Thick foamy head, and lots of lacing. Nose is sweet with wood and beat and an overall earthy character. Caramel and milk chocolate, peat, and wood. Grainy and earthy. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"Overall- A solid, no-nonsense, well-rounded brew. Certainly above average, and something I'd revisit, but not going to make my short list."
"A tasty, toned-down Scottish (or do they mean Scotch?) Ale, just as proclaimed by the brewery. Easy to drink, which leaves me little time to ponder why they just didn't refer to this as what it really is, in the first place. Maybe staring at the logo on Brent the brewmaster's shirt for half an hour informed me a little too much."

"Poured into a goblet, caramel brown, clarified ale, with under an inch of off white head. Nose is pleasing, candy apple, citrus, toast and malt. Flavor is where it falls slightly short for me, crisp apple, malty and medium-hopped, but somehow seems to be some empty spaces in there somewhere. Mouthfeel is lighter than it looks like it's going to be, but nice carbonation and a tight finish. I think Odell achieved what they were going for with their lighter take on a Scotch ale, and definitely a good offering for their flagship beer. I remember drinking this in Fort Collins 15 years ago and liking it, and still like it now."
"The 90 Schilling from Odell is quite nice. The beer pours a brownish clear amber with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent a nice malt....that isnt sweet or over powering. The taste is very good....a nice scotch type ale with that earthy malt. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected in body with good carbonation. Overall a very good beer and would definitely try this one again!"
""
""
"90 Shilling Ale pours a dark clear and cooper color with a nice lacing head. There is a weak aroma with a sharp malty note present. The taste has a nice sharp and peaty malty taste. Flavors are overall rather weak. Overall nothing to special, it is a very average."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good to very good beer, and it's apparent why this is Odell's flagship. Rather smooth drinking and fairly refreshing for the darker side of beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall seemed one dimensional, but still liked it a lot, very drinkable."
""
""
""
""

"A decent, malty beer, probably a good choice for someone that does not like hops. Being a bit of a hophead, I found it a little boring."

"Sweet fruity flavors as well as a nice sweet malty finish make this beer much more enjoyable than I was expecting. Pleasantly surprised with this one. Fantastic balance."
""
"Smooth and caramel-esque like Raul's senior year prom date. I mean, she was a nice girl, and every now and then I still thinks of you girl, but I probably won't ever be back. It's one of those good thangs, but not one of those ""good"" thangs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hints of chocolate malt in the background. A well rounded ale."

"Overall - this is a solid beer and very good for the style. I usually don't drink Scottish ales, but this is nice."

"This was a pretty lame Scottish ale. Lightening it up made it pretty boring and then adding more hops and higher combination just made that worse. It's got an interesting peppery taste that makes it a little above average compared to other boring American flagship beers, but it's just not on par with anything Scottish style."

"O: A classic beer in a style that is starting to make a comeback in the US. Most of the Scottish ales trend toward light and unflavorful or strong and syrupy characteristic of may Wee Heavy ales. 90 Shilling strikes a nice balance between these two, yielding a tasty and drinkable ale."
"Overall: One of Odell's best. Such a complex yet simple brew. It's hard to explain. Unique."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a world class Scottish Ale from Odell. A fantastic beer in all regards. One of my favorites because even though it is well-balanced, it still makes you think as you enjoy it. Not to mention it's sessionable ABV."

"Pours a darker brown to amber color in the glass - really nice color. Finger of head, good retention, really nice lacing. Aroma is fresh and malty yet somewhat non-distinct. Flavor is malt strong with only a hint of hops. Refreshing up front and finishes with a bit of hop bite. Another very nicely balanced beer."
""

"Overall: This is a delicious drinker, very easy to session."
""
"O-This is a nice-drinking, if slightly mellow beer. I think the mellowness serves this beer well, because it is enjoyable, but not fatiguing or overly aggressive on the palate. A nice ""unwind"" type of beer that tastes good but doesn't require you to think too much. I am OK with that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into snifter. Appearance is a nice chestnut brown with clarity. Nose is grainy with light nutty notes, mild sweetness, and a hint of butterscotch. The taste is much of the same... Mild fruity qualities with again a bit of a buttery finish. Not sure if this is due to dirty tap lines or perhaps some diacetyl, but it actually works nicely with the beer. Mouthfeel is mild with moderate carbonation. Easy drinking with nice malty flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Odell didn't let me down, but they also didn't blow me away with this offering. It's good, but not great. I would order this again, and will actually be looking for this on draft. I bet this is really good on draft. I bet this would even make a good cask beer. I can see this being served at room temperature. If you are a fan of Odell Brewing Company, then this should be a staple in your daily drinking."

"Thanks to GHB for sending this one my way. The beer poured out as a nice clear looking amber color with a light cream colored head on top. The lacing is very good on this as well as the retention. It's a great looking brew. The smell of the beer is malty, semi sweet with a nice earthy caramel aroma. The taste of the beer is very mellow, nice malt profile with a subtle bitterness in the late finish, flavors of toast and caramel. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, it had a good amount of body but remains easy to drink. Overall it's a very good brew and I'm glad I got to finally try it."
""
""
""
"O- good example of the style. Balances roasted flavors with sweetness very well. Quite approachable and highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer has a medium body with carbonation of medium-low intensity, never high enough to make this fizzy, but substantial to the point of foaming the beer gently upon the palate. The overall mouthfeel is, then, foamy and smooth, even somewhat creamy. Closes wet, with moderate stickiness lingering across the palate."

"A nice beer but one that was a slight disappointment in that I was expecting a little bit more from this one. I was nice enough to taste but I felt the cabonation could have been a little stronger and there wasn't really anything to excite me or grab my attention."

"poured a dark amber color with a very small head. Picking up some caramel and dark fruits. Can pick up the sweetness in the smell immediatly. Taste of dark fruits with good carbonation. Medium bodied which fits this beer well. Worth having a glass and maybe 1 or 2 in the fridge."
""
""
"Quality, well-rounded beer. Between dark amber and mahogany. Tight light khaki head. Deep nutty maltiness. Bready with thick caramel, but dry enough to keep it quaffable. Even bitterness. Light and smooth hop flavor - earthy, grassy, blackberries. Bit of fruit from the yeast too. Where better to try a brewery's flagship than the brewery itself?"
"O - Overall, a very nice beer. Can't believe that it took me this long to get to it, but I think I will be coming back for a full sixer sooner rather than later."
"Overall - I like this beer. Its one of the deeper Scotch Ale I have enjoyed. It is definitely work seeking out."
""
""
"Although 90 Shiling is Odell's flagship brew, it is actually my least favorite of their offerings that I have tried so far (although it looks damn sexy). By no means is it a bad brew, it just comes up short in the aroma profile and has a decent, but unmemorable flavor. In fact, if it didn't cost $8.50 a six, this would be an ideal causal beer. At this point in the argument, I still prefer Belhaven if I am going to shell out for a Scottish ale."

""
""
"Overall: Very very good brew. I feel this is one of the better balanced ""Scotch Ales"" I've had from an American brewer. Very solid all around, and a real crowd pleaser even with my BMC drinking friends."
""
"Overall a great session ale that is so balanced and smooth. A pleasure to bring this back from my visit to Colorado. Odell is my favorite brewery in the state with New Belgium a close second."
"This is a study in good, solid simplicity. Relatively low ABV, straightforward DNA, & very tasty. Very good beer."
"O - a well balanced brew, worth a couple at a time."
"Pretty good stuff. Could use a little more balance from the hops."
""
""
""
"O: An unremarkable, although well balanced, drinkable and enjoyable beer."
""
"It’s real tasty too. The malt sweetness doesn’t overpower but blends well with the rest of the beer. I get that light ‘pancake’ familiarity too, along with just a hint of hops at the end. Yum!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Very tasty ale, more of an amber than a scotch IMO. The peat notes are quite faint and the caramel notes tend to dominate. Easy drinking ale that was fantastic on tap and just as tasty in the bottle."

""

"Poured from growler to pint glass the beer pours a amber/dark orange color with a nice 2 finger head, good retention and lacing. An enjoyable aroma of malty sweetness, caramel, almost nutty character to it. Little hop presence in the nose. The flavor starts with the malt character and develops with caramel flavors, mild bitterness, and again a hint of nuts. Very tasty and well balanced. Finishes smooth and clean with moderate carbonation. Medium bodied. Overall, this is an excellent beer I need to drink more of, highly recommended."
""
""
"O- This gets points for being distinctive in an easy category to get lost in. Don't know if I think it is more than a good beer, but certainly unique."
""
""
""
"O: This isn't anything impressive and doesn't really seem to be to style. It's somewhat thin and cloying, and certainly doesn't present anything interesting. A lot better options out there."
"The mouthfeel is a little below average for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a decent beer, but not an outstanding one. I found it was a pretty easy drinking, flavorful and balanced beer overall though."
""
""
" Pours a nice amber color with a thumb and a half width of a just off-white head. The head eventually drops but a thin layer remains on the surface, with the edges maintaining the thickest leftover. Decent lacing. Aroma offers a touch of smokiness, nutty, sweet bread and caramel, and a little spiciness and earthiness. Flavor follows suit. A medium bodied, active mouthfeel. Overall, definitely a fan of this one. Easily my favorite beer of the style."

"Overall: Not something to go seeking out if you are a craft aficionado. However, if you get Odell in your area and are looking for something to convert a BMC drinker or if you're just looking for a sessionable beer check this one out."

"Overall - This is a great brew. I would certainly buy it again, recommend it to a friend, etc. Everything seems to be a cohesive whole with this beer. The taste matches the smell, which is kind of what you would expect out of the look and partly the style. ODell Brewing has done an excellent job with this beer. I suggest it to anyone. That and 98 cents will get you a burger off the dollar menu."

"12 ounce bottle, best by 3/14/12. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like caramel malt, toffee, nuts and some bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and it's also well carbonated. Overall I think it's an OK beer. It's worth trying, and I wouldn't turn one down."

"This was all right. It's the best beer on tap by far at a place like Manning's, so under those circumstances I'd get it again, but that's about the extent of it."

"I spotted this in a forest of mediocre tap handles at a mediocre mall bar in Westminster, CO. I expected something more intense and more alcoholic, given the style, but enjoyed it anyhow. It's a Scottish ale deflated by about one third; still having plenty of caramelly flavor (and that distinct taste of peas) without the burn of the booze that so warms one on a winter evening. A levitated, springtime approach to an otherwise heavy-duty, depths-of-January malty classic. Worth a glass."

"O: A decent beer. To malty for my tastes, but nothing wrong with it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Definitely a lighter-bodied Scottish ale. Hints of lime and light fruits."
" nice delicate notes of nuts and caramel were mixed and intertwined with a deeply rooted grain filled back. This was a malt monster for sure as the only thing that was easily picked up through all this was the dark roasted malts that made up the majority of it. nice bit of caramel and sweetness right from the start and this really never faded as any other flavors that were here simply mingled and swirled around this. There were hints of roasted nuts as well as a nice bit of overt grassy notes in the finish."
"O: A great beer, would much rather have this than almost any other amber, unless I was in a hoppy mood."
"Drink- I just simply wasn't a fan of this beer. It was average to say the least but that mouth and feel just killed it for me."
"I'd get it again."
"Notes: This medium-bodied brew is well-balanced, flavorful, and with its relatively low ABV, quite easy to drink. Odell never fails to impress. I really enjoy this brew. It screams for a pairing with a venison roast."
"a damn good session. the flagship beer from what i consider to be colorado's finest brewery, it is an amber, but much much more. doesnt have the residual malt sweetness of a typical amber, instead a quicker, more dry finish with a slightly toasted mellow vibe and a bigger body. this one can drink all afternoon evening and night with zero diminishing marginal utility. not my favorite odell brew, but it fills a very important beer drinking niche, especially here in denver"
"D- Doesnt work for me. Lifeless nose and palate and what is there isnt true enough to style for me. Maybe im harsh possibly due to the travel its maybe done or poor cellarmanship, but underneath that it can hardly be branded a 90 shilling - a full bodied malt beast."
"Aroma is that of maple and almost a hint of old book pages. A mahogany color, sea foam white head. Taste is nutty, almost hazelnut if not almond. Palate has a nice light carbonation with an almost creamy finish. Overall a great session beer. wish the oak aged came out more."
"O I've had better amber ales and way better Scottish ales before."
"O- My ideal session beer. The beer that made me fall in love with Odell's"
"Overall: one of the more flavorful ambers/scottish ales I have had."
"D - could be a decent session beer and widely available here in Fort Collins. That being said, I don't think its a great example of the style."
"Basically it's not my favorite but it's not that bad at all."
"Beer is medium in body and pretty sweet with a surprisingly dry finish, the overall beer is nice on the palate and I enjoy it a lot. Perhaps it is because I have had so little beer recently but the beer I drink I seem to really enjoy, I'd have this again."
"Overall: This grows on me as the glass progresses. I can tell this is a well made beer, but there is not any one feature that really sticks out."
"Pours a clear tarnished copper with a thin light tan head. Smells of toasted bread. Taste is a big blast of sweet bread up front, followed by some dark caramel notes, finishing with a slight earthy, smoky bitterness. A quite malty beer. Mouthfeel is juicy, low carbonation. Overall a quite good beer. Tastes more like an American Amber Ale to me, but either way I would get this again."
"After reviewing this beer, I've gone back to look at other BA reviews: most reviews seem pretty favorable. I can't help but wonder if my bottle was subjected to poor conditions in its life. I would be willing to give it another shot, but based on this tasting, I cannot justify giving it high marks."
"O - I’m inclined to like this one. While I don’t know if I’d seek it out, it’d be a welcome find now and then. It’s a rustic taste that I could see paired well with a meal. As for a flagship beer, Odell is wise to hype this one, showing the range of their balance as a brewery."
"O: Very nice scottish ale. Smooth and drinkable. Very approachable. A good go-to beer."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 08/18/11. Pours slightly hazy red-orange color with a dense 2 finger light khaki head with good retention that reduces to a decent sized lacing cap. A bit of fairly thick lacing sticks to the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, molasses, dark fruits, roasted malts, bread, and spices. Decent aromas with decent strength. Taste of huge caramel, molasses, light chocolate, roasted malt, and some spiciness. Decent amount of bitterness is present on the finish and linger with caramel, light chocolate, spices, and roasted flavors. Medium body and medium carbonation; with a nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel, with very nice drinkability. No alcohol in the taste or finish as expected. Very nice balance of all flavors. Overall, an excellent scottish ale that has tons of flavor and balance. My first brew from Odell as well."
"Good quality. I'd have it again, but not at this price."
"On the whole, a good beer, though I'm not blown away by the flavor. I think the flavor lacks the complexity of a really good scottish ale, and I'm not a huge fan of the aftertaste. It's really more of an American Amber than a Scottish Ale, and if it were characterized as such, I might rate it a tad higher. Good, but not great."
"O - I enjoyed this beer, light smoke with deep malty biscuit and light chocolate, but the finish is slightly off for style, not sure if it is a slight tannic or maybe the smoke gives it a slightly dry finish."
"O: This one is OK. Doesn't stack up to their IPA or DIPA, but they did a good job on it."
"While initially heavy on the malt and fruit, I found myself liking what the hops brought to this after a while, making this much more accessible to me than what I normally found in the style. This is a decidedly American take on a Scottish Ale and I overall mostly dug it!"
"O/D - Very enjoyable, drinkable beer. Don't think it needs to be sought out, but if you're working your way through the style (ticking) definitely worth grabbing."
"O - This is the best brown that I've had so far. Everything is so delicate about it but it's still so complex and easy to enjoy. Definitely try this if you get the chance!"
"A 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A Hazy amber liquid with golden hues near the edges, this beer evolves about a half inch of head before it fades to a thin foam layer. A grand amount of sticky, white lacing is left behind, enhancing the appearance. It smells of hops, faint citrus, a bit of smooth malt, and even fainter skunky/funky smell; something just seems off. This is reflected in the taste. It tries to find a middle ground between an amber and a scotch ale, but seems to fall short of excelling at either. Hops and very faint caramel lead the way before that odd skunk flavor takes over. Quite unfortunate. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, save a faint burning from the alcohol (which was surprising since there really wasn't a whole lot in there) and the rather unpleasant flavor. I'm a big fan of a number of Odell's products, but I won't be revisiting this one anytime soon. For some reason, it just doesn't do it for me."
"D/O- Easy drinking Scottish ale here. Nothing stands out to put it in the top tier of the style but no bad attributes either. Good for what it is."
"Not quite sure what to make of the finish, but it ruins this beer for me. I can't explain it at all, which I know doesn't help, but it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I was disappointed by this beer."
"We sampled this one at the Odell Taproom with some friends, a few Saturdays ago. Poured a nice, medium amber color, with some good light tan foam on top. Aromas of biscuit, light caramel and hops. On the palate, light to medium bodied, with a little caramel, some biscuit and a kiss of hops."
"Overall Impression- While enjoying this both on-tap and in bottle over a dozen times, this is awesome to have been able to get my hands on another one of these! Odell does great brewing and with this Malt heavy Scottish Ale, it is easily enjoyed. Don't even have to think twice about this one. Will be having again very soon!"
"Overall pretty good, nice dark malts, bit of hoppy bitterness, herbal hops are not quite my thing but fit the style."
"Pours a clear amber color with a 1/2 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thick rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. The only smell I get from this beer is malt. Taste is of toasty malt/biscuit flavors. This beer has good carbonation with a nice crisp and clean moutfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smell and taste is pretty one dimensional. I think I would like to try this one again from a bottle to see how it compares."
"D/O - easy to drink, incredibly enjoyable"
"Final Notes: This is a beer that malt-heads will want to check out. Deliciously sweet, not overly bitter, and very interesting palate. Makes a great dessert beer."
"O: Despite all of the maltiness, the beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable."
"o-great job with a session beer that easy to drink, but makes you think some during the pint."
"O: A very nice, easy drinking ale. Not for hop-heads. Full of malt character without being overly heavy."
"Overall, this beer is a good Scotch ale and easy to drink. I think on tap and fresh it would be a lot better due to the carbonation level and the possible age of this bottle."
"O: decent brew! Went perfect with my pizza & wings!"
"On tap at Old Chi's Wheatridge. FINALLY getting around to reviewing this one. Poured a nice dark brown with a small head that quickly disapated. Aroma of malt, some brown sugar, and a touch of smoke (?). Taste was malt, brown sugar, caramel, and just the right amount of hop bitterness. This used to be a go-to beer for me. Still mighty tasty, especially on tap."
"O: Well done beer. Nice beer. Likely not to buy in bottle. But likely to have on tap."
"3.5/3/3.5/3/4"
"Odell flexes it's muscles with it's flagship here, probably one of the most balanced beers out there that still delivers with malt and hops. In my opinion a great session beer that might not even be Odell's best amber. A staple for the fridge."
"O - Very drinkable beer, either on its own or as a session drink."
"D: Pretty drinkable, nice sessional beer, could probably go through a couple in a sitting pretty easily."
"D: Very good. Could drink these all day."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Thanks Bry."
"A solid scottish ale. Nice acidity, good malt, and a good finish from the hops."
"Pours a yellowed brown with a good amount of off-white frothy head. Lots of lacing and good head retention. Smells malty.... almost a bit yeasty. Smells not all that different from a malt liquor. Tastes malty up the wazoo. Sweet and great mouthfeel. Very nice carbonation. Highly drinkable which is to be expected at 5.5 percent"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Notes from Odell Brewery (2004) on tap poured into pint glass: Beer is a clear medium-dark plum-brown color with a small, white, frothy, mostly diminishing head. The aroma is pretty small. It's malty with light notes of slightly husky roasted grain, caramel, cookie, trace of cocoa; Light miscellaneous notes of steak sauce and gingerbread. Trace of herbal hop. The flavor is more vivid. It's moderately bittersweet, moderately acidic with a long, lightly bittersweet, lightly acidic/dry finish. The body is medium, the texture is watery and the carbonation is lively."
"Drinkability: This beer is great for throwing a few back. Your palate will not get overpowered by too much flavor and the balance is impressive. Great example of this style!"
"Jumping out of my IPA rut for an evening, I quaffed an Odell 90 Shilling. It's a beautiful beer, and most brunettes would love to have their hair glow as richly as this deep auburn ale. Breaking out of my trance, I took a sip. Lots of bold malt flavor up front turns to a soft bitterness toward the finish. Very nice. The 90 Shilling is a smooth experience, and I would have reached for another, but alas, there were no more in the fridge."
"Very dark color (or maybe just next to it's neighboring tap: Miller High Life?). The flavor starts sweet and finishes dry from roasted grains, but well away from seeming like a porter or a stout. Mild fruitiness from the yeast. Plesant but low profile hop presence. Tasty and easy to drink."
"I really like 90 shilling. Im trying this from a bottle. Poured into my favorite Odell's IPA glass. A clear brown color with a good foam on top. The aroma is malty with a hint of nuttiness. There is a good hop aroma as well. The taste is great. Good malt backing with a great hop backing. More of an US Brown than anything. But great lingering sweetness. Tasty."
"I actually am liking this one-- perhaps more than I normally would due to my surroundings... Either way, not bad. The body is lighter than a lot of other beers of the style, but I think it works well enough. Good bubbly feel is pleasant and smooth. This is a Scotch ale for mass appeal-- but it's respectable enough for a more discerning palate."
"Hazy red-amber with lots of carbonation. Dense and sticky off-white head with good retention. Plenty of caramel in the aroma and a bit of earthiness. Good amount of carbonation in the beginning. The middle brings out the caramel sweetness followed with a quick stab of hop bitterness. Very nice balance through the finish, which adds a bit of spiciness. Medium heavy body."
"I would like to drink this brew on a nice light meal i think it would help bring something a little heavy to the table, although it is not a really heavy brew."
"D: mouthfeel and taste combine to create an excellent drink-ability, would have no problem downing a 6'er of these."
"D: Easy drinking and delicious, this is a brew that sessions well. I'm a bit biased, though, as this is one of my favorites at Odell."
"The body is moderate to mid dry. Would like a touch more depth overall, but still very good. Carbonation is good. Overall a very clean easy drinking brown ale. Very tasty, thanks."
"Dark amber, quite clear, looking lovely. A dominant malt character persists in the aroma, some sweet barley, a dominant caramel. The flavor is very similar, with a very dextrinous mouthfeel. Starchy. No smokiness, despite the fact I'm sitting beside a fire whilst sipping upon this beer. I really need some smokiness here. Even some subtle smoking might go a long ways here. Instead, it feels like something caught between styles, though, as an amber ale, I'd probably score this a little bt higher."
"Dark amber or copper colored with two fingers of solid head that had good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. I am not picking up much aroma. I do detect the caramelized malt and that is about it. Lacks much depth. The flavor also suffers from a lack of depth. Odell 90 Shilling lacks the sweetness that makes a Scottish Ale. A lot of artificial tasting malt with subtle hints of peat and smoke. This sort of malt bill turns me off everytime regardless of style. A nice little grassy hop hit in the finish. Maybe not exactly 90 Shilling worthy but maybe 70 Shilling. Good carbonation and texture. A flagship beer that is not an APA is a nice departure along with the ABV."
"My slow pour into a glass did not allow for the development of much head. Color was a deep amber with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty sweet, leaving no doubt as to its style of origin. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a pleasant, yet not overwhelming sweetness on the tongue. I have long copped to not being a sweet beer kind of drinker, preferring palate-ripping AmeriCAN IPAs, but when I am off-reservation, this is the kind of taste that I CAN get behind. The finish was sweet, but not cloyingly so, which is my usual complaint about the style. I could drink a couple of bottles of this at a time."
"Drinkability - Good beer. Very drinkable with no over powering flavors. Not too heavy on the stomach so you could enjoy a few of these."
"D - Not bad, it is an enjoyable beer and a decent interpretation of the style. The malt is spot on with a smooth, lightly fruity yeast character, but the hops are a bit excessive. There is some musty flavor and a bit of pine in the aroma with bitterness that balances but cut through the malt more that I would generally want it to in this sort of beer. Worth a try, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"D: A wonderfully drinkable, very satisfying beer. As good or better than its Scottish counterparts. Definitely recommended."
"D: Good every day beer right here. And as literally every bar in Denver has this on tap, and it's 5.3% ABV, it's a sessionable safety beer."
"Enjoyable, not overly complex."
"D- Easy to drink. Complex and refreshing. Slightly above average."
"A cross between and amber and a Scottish ale, this beer is a solid entry in either category."
"It is pleasant and easy to drink, but quite thin overall."
"Pours a dark amber brown with an off white head. A wee bit of lacing. The nose brings some caramel, toffee, bread, some light fruits, and a mild hop character. The taste is slightly bitter with good notes of toffee and some light chocolate. Good body with nice carbonation. Some nice flavors for a low ABV beer. The taste doesn't have quite the depth that I would like, but it's fairly nice overall."
"Body is smooth, firm, and toned in a malten medium body that has unescapeable drinkability. Wow! It's simple with a nice subtleness across its flavor profile. It takes on a very drinkable smooth body that's clean, round, and malted with a nice touch to English hoppyness and toastyness. This one grows on you quickly and drinks down way too easy...solid and definately Odell."
"Lingering maltiness on the tongue pleasantly ends with herbal hops, but the hops are way at the end of the taste and not assertive at all: don't get any hops in the nose."
"This beer is average for the style with a unique taste that I don't like too much."
"Really wish this beer would make it's way to California as I dont want today to be the last time I ever get to have it."
"D - very drinkable. Except for the weird smell, this is a solid ale. I am happy with it!"
"If you like ambers, give it a try, but keep your expectations reasonable."
"Classic case of a wannabe."
"Drinkability - I don't a whole lot of complexity in this one, but I think it might make a good fridge stuffer."
"Overall - an OK brew but nothing special. Odell can do better than this... worth a try though"
"I had this brew about a year ago while travelling through Colorado. Its now available in my area in the Twin Cities. It is an awesome Ale and it is unique in that you can drink a few of them without getting filled up. I love this beer. Try it as soon as you can as distribution is expanding."
"This beer reflex the perfect pour on what an amber beer should look like. The rich red color shines through the glass when held up to the light. The head was just over a finger thick. The smell has complex grains but mostly sweet malts. I taste a lot of earthy walnuts. It really sticks to the roof of my mouth. It lingers just long enough to remind you of the soft sweetness of the malt. This easy drinking beer would complement any classic comfort foods that grandma use to make like a simple batch of cornbread and a home cooked chicken pot pie."
"Drinkability: This is no Nugget Nectar Amber Ale but it's, clearly, not going in that direction. I can see someone looking for a pleasant, easy to drink beer (almost sessionable) being able to drink a few and enjoy each one as much as the previous. I think a lot of non-hop heads will like this though I don't see it as a go-to beer for many."
"Drinkability: With the exception of hops, this beer has a good deal of diverse flavors combined into one package, which can make for a good session beer, considering the semi-low ABV."
"Though those of you who prefer more of an earthy peat flavor in your Scotch Ale may be a bit disappointed. I'm not among them. This is just a nice, easy drinking beer, regardles of style. It's obvious, at least to me, why O'Dell picked this as their flagship ale. It's got all the great markings of a good beer, well balanced and very flavorful."
"D-I have recently realized that I am not a fan of red ales.That said,this beer was a good example of the style but just not in my list of favorites."
"Cheers!"
"drinkability: not bad, woul dhave loved some more balance with the hops."
"D: Another one of my must tries in AZ, I wasn't a huge fan of this, but I guess you can't like 'em all."
"My first offering from Odell. I picked up 4 singles of their regular offerings and chose this one to try first. Pours a dark amber color with golden/copper highlights, small white head that has a lasting cap, but no lacing. Nice, lightly sweet nose, some caramel and toffee, virtually no hoppiness. Upon first taste, I thought it seemed a bit light and watery. But the more I sip on it, the more I like this quality. The smooth, balanced bready and toasty malts combine well with the caramel and light hoppiness (piney, but light) to great a refreshing, drinkable red ale. It's bordering on Scottish ale territory. Lower carbonation works well for this one since the body is light. Again, very drinkable. Good beer!"
"A good amber ale. Something I enjoyed. I can see this being a staple of mine if I lived in the area."
"Drinkability: A very enjoyable mild amber ale. Actually my first offering from Odell. I can see myself enjoying this in the fall watching football. Mild and not overpowering."
"D: very drinkable, a very good session beer"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (best before 9/8/10) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a very clear dark copper with a red hue. It has medium carbonation with a nice stable off white head. I can sense some breadiness in the aroma with a mild earthy hop aroma. Taste starts out with a little malt sweetness then finishes with some burnt toast. Body feels light to meduim with some drying bitterness. Overall impression was lower than expected."
"D - Good tasting brew from Odell, medium bodied with a good blend of malts and hops. Slight hop bitterness but smoothed over nicely. I recommend this brew"
"What a great introduction to the Odell Brewing Company! This amber is easy to sip, inventive and damn tasty. My glass was done in 5 minutes and I was kicking myself for not picking up a few bottles. Bravo!"
"Overall - Incredibly drinkable, wonderful, a must try for this style. I'm ready for another!"
"This beer pours a dark amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into nice sticky lacing. The aroma is of caramel, a very faint whiff of peat, and an overall sweetness. It is a nice aroma, but rather weak. The taste is similar to the aroma. It is pleasant, but lacks any real complexity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is an alright beer, but it really doesn't wow me. I could drink it again without complaints, but I would seek it out."
"A session beer this is, appropriate for the style. It went well with a Sunday afternoon lunch."
"D-A tasty beer, definately a good one to be Odell's flagship brew. Very flavorful for this easy of drinking, without bogging me down too much."
"Flavor is ok. It's a pretty bland beer for the style. I expected a little bit more hop, but pretty average overall. Light and crisp, medium carbonation, and light body. Only noticable flavors are yeasts and malts. I had slightly higher expectations, but a good drinker atleast."
"5.0 D: Really nice brew. One of the easiest to drink I've ever had."
"D - An easy drinker for sure... Nothing wrong with this one, but nothing quite memorable either... The ""90 Schilling' name is slightly misleading as this is in no way a traditional Scotch(ish) Ale..."
"Enjoy!"
"Great session Scotch ale. No noticeable hops, except that maybe if they weren't there, this beer would be a lot sweeter."
"This is the third beer I have tried from this brewery. I think their St. Lupin Ale is very good, so with Odell terming this beer their ""flagship"" I was looking forward to trying it. For me, unfortunately, it was a disappointment."
"A little disappointed with this one, too bland. I was expecting more."
"Reminds A of a sweet fruit tea (?!)."
"The taste has some sweet caramel, roasted malt, and a light hop flavor not noticeable in the aroma. Light to medium bodied, decent carbonation, and pretty good drinkability."
"D--great beer to drink a 6-pack of, not an extremely unique craft beer, but a beer for everyone"
"D: Not enjoyable as a Scotish 90- ale, or as a beer defying categorization. Not a fan."
"Deep copper tone. Bubbly and fluffy beige head. Lace is more than sufficient. Nice aroma of caramel malts and warm biscuity tones. Medium to medium-full body. Smooth flavor and mouthfeel. Caramel and bread maltiness provides the substance to this beer. Hops merely provide a little balance. Could serve well as a session beer in a pinch."
"I thought that this beer was very tasty. It had nice malty flavors and enough hops to back them up without overpowering them. It tasted great after a day of skiing."
"Drinkability: Nice, drinkable hybrid of an Amber Ale and a Scotch Ale."
"pours a chestnut color with a small head and a tan ring with some decent lacing..the smell is malty and toasty with some grass caramel and citrus in the background..the taste is malt and toffee with some sweet caramel and some hops in there .. the mouth feel is medium ..this brew reminds more of a light brown or very light wee heavy than an amber..i give props for alot of flavor @ 5.5 abv..its an interesting red/amber..one i will visit again"
"Beer #1 from Odell, 90 shilling is a decent amber. I don't usually search out ambers as they are not too exciting, but this one does have a nice grassy hop profile to go along with the usual caramel/breadiness of an amber."
"Tasting notes: creamy. Chocolate and toffee notes. Medium carbonation with pleasant mouthfeel. Sweet and full nose. Slight bitterness. An excellent combination; would have been better slightly warmer."
"D= the beer goes down easy and is clean as hell. Something I would seek again but nothing that makes me super excited. A decent brew."
"Excellent drinkability. Could drink it all night."
"Fairly malty in taste, caramel and a little bit of sweetness, a little more of the ashy flavors, mint as somone else mentioned along with a hop leaf earthy flavor. A very good 90 schilling. Easy to drink on, no pallete fatigue. A very nice beer indeed."
"Pours a nice red/orange color. Not a lot of smell, but what there is is smoky malt. Flavor is malt with a hint of smoke, and a tinge of bitterness. Very nice flavor. Complex. Quite a lot of carbonation, but not overpoweringly so. I would drink these all evening. Very nice beer."
"Red ales are an interesting style to begin with, and this one strikes a nice balance. Decent and drinkable, and a welcome addition to any night spent listening to live Irish jigs."
"One thing is that this beer was better on first sip than last sip. Normally full-flavored beers improve as they slightly warm but I think this one was best right out of the fridge."
"B+"
"Mouthfeel, turns to that earth feel, heavier, woodier, less like beer. Drinkable, yes, it doesn't turn you off to having another, just the price aspect of it does."
"Overall, this is a highly recommended drink on my part. I found it easy to enjoy and it grew on me with each sip. I'd be eager to try out Odell's other brews."
"Popular beer, enjoyed on tap at the Yard House, Scottsdale. Good white head that leaves lace. A fresh smell, a tad of smoke, which is me processing the toasted malts, a bit of sourness. Above average mouthfeel.Good caramel, malting. Nice drinking, quenching."
"D: The lower abv really helps the drinkability. A good ale for a cold night."
"Medium bodied, creamy feel, mild carbonation. I like this beer as a ""light 90 shilling"" if that's what they want it to be."
"Overall, one of the best amber/reds that I've had in a long time. Good amount of flavor for a malt show. High recommend. Rotation - not avail here in TX so had ummagum ship me some. If here, I'm in a hop phase these days so a malty one like this might get a 6xer a year. For now, not worth shipping again but will have on-tap during my Colorado visits."
"Edit: Odell has a red ale that they call 'Red'. To me, wtf, is appropriate here; why do they need two products in this category? Why not have an actual 90 Schilling?"
"Drinkability? I had things to do or I would have had another or 2. Very darn drinkable and very darn tasty. Just a tad better than the bottled version, imho, but both are more than worthy."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day, but I have to admit, it's a little confusing to determine what the style of beer was supposed to be as the bottle kind of touts itself as a Scottish, but then says the results of the brewing was an amber, and of course, BA lists it as an amber. Very easy to drink though, fine flavors and a body that really isn't heavy at all and a very moderate ABV."
"D: I would drink several and wish that it was normally available in Ohio."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is sticky, mild carbonation, a bit of astringency. The body of the beer is light and the finish is medium. BA said that this is a Scottish Ale, but the label says it is an amber ale. It taste more like an amber ale and not even close to a Scottish Ale. I am going to rate this beer as if it is an Amber Ale and not a Scottish"
"A bit on the light side (as the label states), fairly decent but didn't excite me. 12 oz bottle to glass, copper color. Nice fresh nose, a little fruity. Taste mostly had malt (maybe a little bit of roasted flavor), and did have some hops, more than most of the few Scottish ales I've had. Not sure I'd get again, just OK for me."
"Poured 12oz bottle into pint glass. Beautiful clear dark orange body with a thin off white head thats a little bit then fades to a faint white film on top of the beer. Smells sweet, malty. Taste much better than most other Scotch ales I have had in the past."
"Drinkability - An excellent beer. The roasted/toasted malt has a fleeting moment at the beginning, light hop bitterness begins to dominate in the middle and finish - Extraordinary!"
"D - Overall a decent refreshing lighter beer."
"Beer poured a deep copper color with a very nice off white head that was two fingers on the initial pour and sustaining well. Nose is predominately malts with a hint of hops lingering in the background. Taste is heavy on caramel malts and is nicely blended with a fair dose of hops to keep it very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth, finishing fairly clean. Overall drinkability is good. This is one of the more interesting beers I have had as it transcends the scottish and amber styles. Definitely sessionable and would be perfect for an October tailgate."
"I have to say, I really like this beer, specially because the nice balance, betweet sweetness and dryness."
"D - Refreshing but a bit sweet."
"This is a very drinkable beer, perfect for hot afternoons on the patio at the brewery."
"D - An excellent meal time beer and one that I would recommend to all ale lovers especially those that like English Ales."
"Poured this one up real nice. Plenty O' Head. Frothy with a lasting tall head. Color of that pretty dark amber that all the guys love. When held up to the sunlight, beautiful. Not that clear. Taste was just under par for a Scottish style, but still above average for a very well balanced and good tasting beer. Very clean finish. Totally yummy. Smell of the ole beer was lacking just a bit for a Scottish but there were some hints of hops along with the malt essence. Mouthfeel was aveage, maybe just a bit more. Not that complex, just well balanced. Easy to drink for a Scottish Ale. I could drink several in one sitting."
"The hop character plays a much bigger role here than one would expect in a more stock version of the style, but I definitely like the addition as it is needed to keep this from being cloying and from allowing the crystal malt character to run rough-shod over the profile of this beer. Not bad, and in fact even enjoyable. I could wish for a bit more richness in the malt character, but I am happily consuming my bottle of this beer right now."
"Drink ability is good. Session able, malty beer that has lots of flavors but is still lighter than most scottish ales. Great rather cheap local beer"
"Won't rush out to buy another, but will keep it in mind should the genre strike me with cravings again."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Very crisp finish with a medium body. This is a very drinkable beer that I wish was stocked in my area."
"A subtle aroma, but present. Pours amber with little head. Taste was at first grassy but gave way to a rich bittersweet caramel taste, sometimes even nutty. The mouthfeel was excellent, very smooth and yet light. Definitely easy to down, overall a pretty decent beer."
"The beer had a lighter medium feel to it, the beer was very smooth with good carbonation. Overall, this made the beer very easy to drink and it seemed to be gone before I realized it. Overall a solid beer."
"A wonderfully drinkable Colorado take on the Scottish style. Odell, please come to Florida."
"D: A good Scottsh Ale is one of my favorite styles. This is perhaps not as authentic as one from across the pond, but I'm not complaining."
"D: Good, not amazing, but good. Great to cook with, or to drink while cooking.. Gimmie a sixer and a grill."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but not too bad. Flavor is very tame and mellow. Great malty goodness with just the slightest touch of bitterness lingering in the finish. This is a very easy drinker that I could enjoy time and again. I just wish that I could get it more often."
"Scottlish LIGHT ale? There's little resemblance to most other Scottish ales. Pour is dark amber with light tan head. Nose is somewhat weak with a faint caramel and light fruits. Thin body on the palate, toasty caramel, and a rather clean finish. This beer is light and caramel sweet, easy drinking/ refreshing."
"Smell is malty with subtle nutty notes as well. Taste follows through with a nice round taste and good finish. A hint of sweetness is nice yet not clowing. Very good finish, Nice brew."
"I can see people having more then one of these due to low percentage of alcohol, not myself though."
"Drinkability- Fair. I would not want to drink these all night. Not enough excitment for me."
"D=Very, not too heavy and filling, alcohol is not so strong to hinder drinkability"
"Great tasting beer, very smooth and sweet with a lot of character for a low ABV. Drinkability is exceptional!"
"A good, and very drinkable scottish ale. I would call for another bottle, but I only brought home one."
"Overall, this beer really surprised me. It was well rounded and had a lot of flavor. Very drinkable. I am bummed that I didn't buy an entire 6 pack."
"Very drinkable. Would go well with food, too."
"The flavor straddles the line between sweet toffee candy and toasty grain husk bitterness. This is a very refreshing take on the style as earthy peat and smoky flavors are kept to a minimum while still contributing to a Scotch Ale feel to the beer. This is a delicious beer and I would highly recommend trying this beer to everyone!"
"While not as well known as some of the other amber beers in the state, 90 Shilling is the best of them in my opinion."
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of pale hops, sweet malt, slight yeast, and slight grain. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops up front, earthy malt, sweet malt, hint of citrus, and a hint of grain. Overall, a very smooth beer with a nice blend of flavors."
"Mouthfeel is medium body with light carbonation. This could easily be one of the best session beers. This one is almost gone and I would happily have several more if I had them. Such a nice balance and enough going on to keep my interest."
"i'd take mom's lasagna out the fridge to make room for more of these. fantastic beer thatll always be near the top for me"
"12 ounce bottle, best before dating(?) etched onto label. Pours clear, dark honey amber. Head is large and lucious, darker khaki, long lasting and leaves plenty of well developed and thick sheeting/lace. The old sniffer picks up maple malt, fruit and some hops in the background. Pleasing scottish ale, more maple and caramel sensed along with some astringent hops notes in the finish. I like my scotts more on the sweet and malty side, but this one is smooth on the tongue and tasty from start to finish. Another worthy offering from Odells"
"these notes carry through to the flavor... to go along with them are hints of chocolate, grass, orange skins with a scant amount of the pith still on them, some pine (not resinous) and a slightly tongue numbing dry hoppy finish. it's very crisp in the mouth and quite refreshing as many in this style tend to be too sweet. medium bodied session beer which pairs great with food... 7/4/7/3/15/3.6"
"This Odell brew is not bad. I would rate it better in it's style (Scottish Ale) than their Easy Street Wheat in it's style group. The beer was a copper color with a malty smell and had some bitterness along the way from mouth introduction to the swallow. It's a drinkable above average Scottish Ale type beer."
"Got this in a trade and even though I have never heard of the brewery I found this beer to be decent,but not a favorite of mine. This is my first example of a Scottish Ale and even though I was not overly impressed with this beer I plan on trying more from this genre."
"Overall - I would recommend this one to a friend."
"Overall - This beer is better than the grade it's going to pop out when I post this. The overall experience is better compared to when you just add up every specific aspect of the beer. Solid brew, one of the better of the style that I've had."
"It has a nice tan frothy head and thick lacing. The lace is a little bit spread out but follows the beer the whole time it is in the glass. The body is copper color with bronze hue. It has a sweet and malty smell with some roasty highlights. The taste starts off sweet but gets bitterer as you go. The aftertaste is roasty and a bit metallic. It has a medium body with a little bit of bite."
"Tasted on 7/11/08."
"Conclusion: I bought this on a whim in a mix-a-six pack from Patricia's Grocery. I was not dissappointed. It's not overpowering in flavor or body, but has enough character to keep things interesting. Well-done!"
"After having the IPA, then the 5 Barrel, now to this, it seems that the quality of choices are declining a bit. This is as fine a Scotch Ale as can be found in the states, but not comparable to the beers from across the pond. This beer has an under-attenuated, wort-y sweet quality, yet a bit light in the body. A pungent earthy note does give a much needed variety, but can't overcome the sugary sweetness. Although the hops are in abundance, they even falter under the sweetness. The body is somehow lacking with true maltiness, giving the beer a dull, sticky texture. Finishes a little sugary. Although it's not a bad beer, it's one and done for me."
"Very tasty and drinkable, maybe a step up for those getting bored with fat tire."
"D - Very drinkable."
"D_A decent attempt no doubt but there is definitely something lacking. The flavours are good but they just do not linger in the mouth long enough for my taste. Still I am enjoying ."
"D-Very easy to have more than a couple of these goes down nice and easy overall another good beer by odell"
"Poured this beer into a plain shaker pint. This beer pours a hazy caramel amber with a creamy white head that left minimal lacing. The aroma is big on caramel. Vanilla and toffee also come through. The taste is also toffee caramel, vanilla and just a slight buttery taste. The mouthfeel is full but not over powering. A really great beer from Odell's."
"D: Refreshing and full of character, this lighter take on the traditional Scottish Ale is worth every shilling."
"Pretty easy to drink with a lot of complexity and plenty of flavor."
"About as drinkable as a beer can be. If this were available in NH it would definitely be a staple in my fridge."
"Overall, this is simply a great beer. Good balance of malts and hops, with a very smooth mouthfeel. Too bad I just got back from Colorado and can't have this for a while."
""
"Drinkable: I really liked this beer for its complexity, balance and easy drinking. A good choice for a Scottish Ale."
"Appearance and smell are good, with a nice roasted peaty aroma. Deep color, with a good feel/aftertaste. This is one I could easily crack open often. A very drinkable version of a Scottish ale."
"D: very drinkable, enjoyed this beer a lot."
"Overall, an easy drinking, refreshing and rather interesting beer. Certainly worth a try...or two."
"D = This beer has good drinkability. Too strong for true session drinking, but it would be a very pleasant beer to sit back and have 2 or 3 of at a sitting."
"Nice tan head over a dark copper brown color. Aromas of soft dried fruits and some candy malts. Also a slight floral hop aroma. The flavors are powered by a fruity and caramel malt structure. The hops are piney and well balanced. Somewhat light for a scottish. The body has an average medium feel. Refreshing beer with some pub food. A good drinker."
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer, and a great session beer at that. I love going out with a sixer of this stuff. Really a great beer to drink, not the most flavorful, but just a great drinking beer."
"Great session beer. If they sold this where I'm from in Michigan it would be my new go-to beer."
"Easy to drink. Not a classic example of the style - esp. ""90 shilling", but who cares in this case."
"Prosit, MK"
"D-very smooth and easy to drink beer. I've drank many 6 packs in my day, and I will continue to buy this classic Colorado beer."
"D- I had to open a third for this review, I keep sucking them down."
""
"D: A very drinkable beer, a very good amber ale."
"M/D: Can't complain about the feel or the drinkability, I could drink this as a session beer or take it to a party. Great all around beer. I buy this one often and for good reason."
"90 shilling is somewhat surprising. When you smell it, it smells malty, like you would expect from the style. When you drink it however, there is a distinct hop character, not aroma, character. It has a copper color, with a nice tan head. It is very drinkable and I really enjoyed the hops."
"Drinkability is very good, my large mug went down in a hurry. I thought it was stronger as a 90 shilling, and is probably more like a 70 shilling. In general, I like Scotch ales stronger and a little smokey. This one is still pretty good all around for a lighter scotch ale."
"Mouthfeel is mild and crisp. A bit of tartness and finishes clean. It's been a while since I've visited this beer, and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long."
"First off...this is not the greatest beer on Earth nor does it deserve a 5! To each is own I suppose. Poured a light copper colored with an off-white fluffy head .Nose is malty, a little biscuity, slightly sweet, very inviting. Flavor is initially thickly malty, a little chewy, no hop profile. Hints of toffee and sweet fruit, but these are understated. Very smooth, very malty without being overpowering. Smooth and even mouthfeel."
" Mouthfeel seems good with decent carbonation although I am new to scottish ales in general so i don't have much of a standard of judgement for the style. Overall though i enjoyed this beer and look forward to reviewing more odell offerings."
"Brown with ruby highlights and a very malty smell. I don't really know how to judge thse ""scottish"" ales since I haven't sampled many (Alesmith Wee Heavy was good). This was not thick or strong but it was tasty and the low ABV makes it easy to drink."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear copper amber body with a small khaki head. Good patchy lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is toffee, oranges and red apples. Medium body and carbonation. Very tasty brew here. Malty toffee and fruity hops are exceptionally well balanced. Grapefruit,red apples, and oranges mingle with the toffee notes to make this exceedlingly quaffable. My favorite Odell brew, hands down."
"d: Very easy drinking thanks to a balanced taste and great mouthfeel. Not your typical scottish ale, but a great session beer. Good introduction to Odell and craft beer in general."
"Pours amber red with some head, but not a huge amount. On the taste it has a sweeter edge. It's full bodied and has a nice froth on the mouth. It might be a bit heavy for some people for a session beer, but for people who enjoy quality, it's a good brew."
"Pours a nice looking copper-amber color, thin head, lots of lacing. Citrus and malt aroma. Very well balanced with some sweet malts, a bit of caramel and enough hops to add just a hint of bitterness. I enjoyed this on draught in Denver and brought a sixer back home with me. Another winner from Odell."
"The taste is a bit reserved, with a slightly malty & spiced hop notes. Some cinnamon is detected as well. Nothing too noteworthy, but still agreeable. Mouthfeel detects a medium body that's a touch on the over-carbonated side. A decent, yet somewhat filmy bitter hop finish rounds out the aftertaste. 90 Schilling goes down smoothly and finishes well, but there's just not enough complexity to really put it over the top. I am looking forward to my Odell's IPA, however."
"drinkability - Real nice sipping beer. I would try this again, since i didn't buy this. I can't say buy lol."
"D - This is not especially complex or unique, but it has session written all over it. I'm not sure if it's due to the popularity of Fat Tire or the crisp mountain climate, but it seems like Colorado microbrewers tend to focus on amber/red ales as their flagship beers. This is a slightly above average basic tasty ale that is a nice brew to have with dinner."
"Has a nice soft mouthfeel, but like the beer overall, a little weak- especially for the style. It is a very nice well balanced beer, but not what I was expecting. Easy to drink yet flavorful beer."
"Smells faintly of sorghum (call me crazy) but other than that nothing distinctive. Tastes of yeast and malt and the carbonation is evident. With 5.3 ABV, it isn't exactly a knock out beer but sure gives you bang for the buck. Above average mouthfeel to this beer, a decent beer to order in a bar instead of a bud"
"Possesses a creaminess I wouldn't have expected. Slightly higher in alcohol than an English mild but doesn't taste sweet enough to be Scottish. Nevertheless, a wonderful UK hybrid if you will. I'm glad more American brewers are taking stabs at traditional, simple styles instead of concentrating solely on ""extreme"" beer. An excellent session brew."
"Drinkability: I like this beer. It has good characteristics of most 90 Schilling types I've tried in the past (but let's be honest, there aren't a ton of them out there), but I'd wished it be a little more ""punchy"" in terms of the alcohol kick. The label is honest, in any event, by letting us know that it's a 5.3% abv beer. Although I'd probably rate it higher if it was in the 7% range, I really enjoyed the complexity of the smell and taste of this beer, and am glad I purchased it."
"Not much to say, other than this was a very, very good beer. Starts with a dark brownish-amber appearance and a malty aroma with faint smell of hops. A nice sweet, rich, malty, smooth taste with a hint of hops in the finish. I noticed in the style description of Scotch Ales that the wort is boiled longer and more caramelized, which is probably the explains the rich and smooth flavors. This is definitely one of my favorite brews."
"D: Overall, I'm impressed with this beer. It is much more satisfying than I expected even though it was based on nothing in particular."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear amber color with barely half an inch of thin off-white foam. The head fades quickly leaving no lace. Smells of lightly toasted grain along with a pronounced nuttiness as well as some apple and pear notes. Tastes of sweet malt, bread, roasty grain and bitter hops. Medium in body with mild to medium carbonation. Not a bad beer but IMO, more like an amber than a scotch ale. Worth a try though."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied. This is not my favorite style but it was nice."
"D- This beer has nice roasted flavor but it is very smooth and drinkable."
"Drinkability, the alcohol sting and the dry finish doesn't make me a fan of this beer and I don't think I could down more than a couple of these in one session."
"Drinkability - very nice going down, I can drink this one all day long"
"More like an American amber ale to me, as the hops are distinct. Better than the Levity, possible replacement? Overall, an okay beer from Odell."
"D: A good beer, not great. Easy to drink and enjoy. It was probably a touch too warm, so my next will be straight from the fridge."
"D"
"Pours a mildly hazed, dark copper with a thin froth on top that clings onto the glass. Smells of toasted malts, chocolate, light raisin characteristics, and bread. Taste is of dried fruit, chocolate, toast, and herbal hops. Has a mild tart presence to the flavor. Carbonation is firm with a slightly sticky body. Solid drinker."
"Opinion: This is a tasty beer. That said, I wouldn't expect much of a Scottish Ale by definition. I would drink this beer again, but I believe that it is a bit of a blurr between a Scottish Export 80 and a British Pale Ale. Take that as you may."
"D: I'm very happy I saw this in the cooler and snagged it. Excellent session brew. Another gem from Odell's."
"(Thanks Wasach)"
"Pours a nice clean clear amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy head which quickly disappears, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, slight hops, and caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, slightly bitter, with some nice caramel tones thrown in. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew from Odell."
"Thanks for the bottle Wasatch."
"Drinkability: A nice take on a Scottish Ale."
"Pours a clear reddish-copper with a thin but dense tan head. Smells sweet and....murky somehow. If that's possible. It has a sharply sour finish to the smell. Taste is much better, though. Starts with a bit of fruit up front, like sour cherries. It gets dry from there. Very dry. Slight hops on the finish, which is a nice balance to the malt. The malt isn't very sweet. At first I would have said it lacked the peat of a scottish ale but as the beer has warmed, i revise that statement. Definite peat and very delicate. A nice feat and it makes for a flavor that addresses the gripe I frequently have of Scottish ales, that they just demand too much of you. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, not so much as to prevent it from being a refreshing drink Nice carbonation. Drinkability? Hard to drink a lot of them with that bone-dry finish. A very good beer and an interesting cross of styles but not something that will move into my regular rotation."
"Drinkability: Alright, has a sour malt aftertaste"
"Light brown/ dark amber in appearance with a slight white head. Smells of malt and barley with a hint of hops. Sweet in taste with the a slight bitterness. This ale has a strong character and am grateful for my friend leaving the 12 pack in my fridge. It's been a great beer for the cold weather we've had in FC in the past two weeks. A second taste reveals the thick yet light flavor of the malt. A great beer that is fulfilling and yet quite drinkable."
"Overall, a pleasant surprise. I'd definitely pick this up again, and other brews from this company."
"M- Lightly carbonated, very easy to drink. Great session beer, all around very refreshing."
"D - This is an excellent session beer. As it warms the carmalization really starts to become apparant. Another fine beer from Odell."
"D - Good drinkability. Mellow, flavorful session style ale."
"Mouthfeel seems okay, a bit thin though. Low carbonation levels. Good session drinkability. Light flavor and light body make this go down easily. I'd like to see it kicked up a notch or two overall."
"I like the depth and complexity of this beer...the toasted malt definately adds smoothness and complexity without giving a bitter or forced taste. Very balanced."
"I rather enjoyed this beer and wish I had more than one. hint...hint, Solomon420. Looking forward to the next bee from Odell."
"Overall a mix between a Scottish Ale and an Amber ale that's a good beer I recommend."
"This beer is a reddish mahogany color. There is a thin head and some lacing. The smell is very good. Bitter and caramel like. The taste is a nice sweet start with a slight hoppy finish. There is a good aftertaste as well. The beer is smooth to drink and I could certainly drink this beer again."
"I found this Scottish Ale in St. Louis about a month ago and forgot about it until now. Pours a great amber-ruby color with a nice head and a bit of solid lacing around the glass. A bit of hoppy characteristic is fantastic on a warm evening. Reminds me of a darker Pale Ale. I'll drink this one again and try some others from Odell brewing when i get the chance."
"Thanks, Oxymoron, for the opportunity"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle as a reddish-orange, with lingering off-white head and excellent lacing. Aroma was slightly detectable hoppiness, but flavor was a perfect blend of hops and malts. Finish was very smooth, somewhat warming, and long lasting. I really enjoyed this beer."
"D - I enjoyed this beer. Odell makes good brews."
"Drinkability: Good, but not much fruitiness and the beer overall is a little light. Like most Odells, this is sessionable but nothing wild on the palate. Not a boundary pusher in terms of the style or microbrewing."
"Poured a rich dark copper color. Fluffy two inch head. Great lacing. Excellent malt profile. Friends had recommended this several times. Many described it as being very smooth. I very much agree. A tremendous session beer. Nice carbonation enhances the sweet caramel notes. After investing so much time in IPA's this drinks like a cola. That is easy drinking at its finest. Odell is steadily making itself one of my favrite breweries. Good show!!!"
"On tap a a restaurant in Littleton, CO, it pours a nice amber with an off-white head that leaves a bit of lace. The smell is caramel with a nice dose of fresh hops. The taste is well-balanced with caramel, a hint of bittersweet chocolate, and just enough hop bite. The mouthfeel is nice and it's quite drinkable. I only wish I could find it on tap when I head back to California."
"Drinkability is relaly top notch, relaly solid beer that always make me look forward to the trips to KC where I can get this."
"Thanks to my brother for supplying. This beer marks the beginning of a journey into large pile of Colorado brews. Cheers bro!"
"Appearance has a caramel amber color tan head forms decently thick tight knit lacing around my chalice. Aroma full of toasted malts hints of nut with pine scented hops. Flavor is well balanced nice light roasty character touch of caramel and touch of whiskey character to it uniform flavor is formed nicely. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied even lower carbonation though not flat glides along the palate. Drinkability well I could definitely love this stuff on cask but it's still a great tasting session ale regardless of serving style."
"Dark copper/amber color, only a thin head with decent retention, good clarity. The smell is mild, some faint hoppiness and caramel malt flavor present. The taste starts out moderately hoppy, and then the sweet caramel malt comes through in the finish. Not very bitter. Medium thickness. Average carbonation. Not a bad balance of flavors here, the malt was nice but could have been more intriguing. It just didn't taste that ""fresh"" to me. It's still a fine Colorado craft brew..."
"If I could get this on tap, this would be a front runner amongst my session choices. Good in the bottle, but was almost like a different beer on tap. Tastes more like a scotch ale on draft, Highly reccomended"
"The mouthfeel is a bit light and doesn't seem to have much going on in terms of carbonation. Still a good drinkable beer. As a scottish ale it is fairly weak, but as a hybrid scottish ale / english pale, it is really quite tasty. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Taste has malts, but with a spicey/sweet undertone. At first I thought it would be too malty for me, but it cleared up and ended as a Pale. great drinkability and mouthfeel. A darn good beer."
"Medium bodied, sharp and dry. In my book, the 5.3 % abv makes this one a qualifier for the session book. At least a six-pack afternoon with football"
"cheers..."
"Well done, but this is certainly not a Scotch Ale. Don't let the bottle fool you. Try this is you like Fat Tire."
"Although fairly rich in flavors, none are overbearingly aggressive - very smooth and very drinkable, although a little mild for this kind of ale."
"Drinkability is pretty damn good hell of a sessions brew here. Thanks go to Hometown Sports BIF and ImWithStupid for this treat."
"Although I'd like to see a little bit more (in terms of ABV/flavor) from a ""90 shilling"" Scottish ale, this beer is quite enjoyable and is another example of a good crossover craft beer. It's definitely sessionable, and its sheer maltiness makes a nice change from the majority of American craft beers."
"Never buy less that 6 of these unless you are sharing with friends."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with fast moving carbonation. I wouldn't mind the carb being tuned down a little as it seems to step over the body of the brew. Overall, this is a tasty scottish ale, not one of my favorite styles but I'd say check it out if you dig the scottish ales. Thanks to babydoc for this one."
"Had a sampler at the brewery in Fort Collins. Color is a dark amber. Smells fruity and sweet. I would say more on the sweet side like some type of candy. Taste is malty with a nice bitter bite in the aftertaste, also maybe a little bit smoky aftertaste. Overall this is a very nice beer, one of the better ones I had at O'dell's."
"Overall, a nice session brew that went well by itself, outside in the summer chill, and alongside some BBQ."
"Overall pleasantly sweet & soft ale that gives Fat Tire a run for its money. Its clean flavors make it an easygoing everyday beer. I'd love to try it fresh from the source - on tap of course. Thanks to CRJMellor for this unsolicited gift- quite the gentleman."
"Poured a clear dark amber with a big frothy head that lasted for quite a while. Aroma was pretty much non-existent at first, but slight hops and malt became detectable as the beer warmed and the head disappeared. Light and slightly sweet malt flavours with a slight bitter finish. It was a pretty smooth and easy drinking beer and certainly one that you can drink several of without even noticing.."
"Mouthfeel is medium and clean. Seems to skirt the line between a Scottish ale and a pale ale. I could session this."
"I liked how this beer looked. It was a deep, deep amber and kept a nice head. The nose was nice, but slightly average. I ordered this beer after two that weren't so good...one that I only got half-way through before stopping, so I hope that didn't skew my review. I like Odell, so probably not. The taste had a good amount of alcohol to it with lots of caramel. I'd definitly order it again."
"Appearance is nice clear red amber, with plenty of foam and some lacing. Aroma has grapefruit hops, pine, roasted malt and crackers. Initial taste is of a well proportioned ratio of sweet malt to minty hops that carries through to the finish that contains a toasty/citrus tang. Palate is clean and satisfied. Would be good for a session beer or with food."
"Light copper colored with an off-white fluffy head that sinks quickly. Aroma is malty, a little biscuity, slightly sweet, very inviting. Flavor is initially thickly malty, a little chewy, no hop profile. Hints of toffee and sweet fruit, but these are understated. Very smooth, very malty without being overpowering. Smooth and even mouthfeel, moderate to low carbonation. Easy drinking, good session beer."
"The beer pours a nice dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a malty scent that boasts of pale, light crystal, and roasted malts as well as a light hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a wonderfully malty flavor that boasts of pale, light crystal, and roasted malts along with a mild hop taste and finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good Scottish ale. It has good malt flavor and balance; a fine sessions beer."
"12 oz bottle obtained from Westminster Liquor (Colorado) in Jan 2005 and consumed that same evening. Review from notes. No sediment and a hard pour to get a 3 finger light tan/beige head. Just barely cloudy and light brown. Smells of toffee caramel, chocolate, and a hint of roasted grains. Tastes mild. Not much flavor to start and the ending flavors rise slowly. Late I get chocoalte and tofee with some raisin. Very late I get a hint of chalky from Vienna (or Munich) malt. It has a sourish finish that's kinda dry. not quite a cherry-like sour. Also some acid from the carbonation rising off my tastebuds in the flat of my tongue. Light body. This doesn't do it for me...if they could put a flavor up front when the beer first touches the tongue it would be much more intersting. Decent lacing on the glass."
"Odell 90 Shilling Ale is pretty good beer no matter what style one settles on. As noted above, it tastes like a robust amber ale right out of the chute. It then takes on some, although not all, of the characteristics of a quasi-Scottish ale by the bottom of the bottle. I continue to be impressed by this brewery."
"Pours a clear rusty copper with a beige-tan head. Lacing decorates the glass. Nose is malty. Of course, it should be. Sweetish with light fruit and toffee. Nice earthy/smoky edge to it too. Taste is similar--up front. Malts are lightly sweet, earthy and fruity. Minor hops come in and mostly just add dryness. Lightly bitter and interesting for the style. Medium-bodied with a lightly-creamy mouthfeel. A nice beer, unique (for the style) beer."
"Drinkability: Went down smooth. I am not well experienced in the style, so I can not judge whether or not this is true to the style, but I definitely enjoyed it."
"It's a simple beer. Come on, there is so much great beer out there this is a waste of time. It's a decent amber for frat boys trying to grow out of their Coors diapers. The hopping is boorish, and masks what is good about the beer, a nice malting. They call it a cross between an English pale ale and a Scottish ale. Uh, okay. That combination is dumb. Naming this beer ""90 Shilling"" is dumb. It's a drinkable American (""Colorado ale"" as they call it) amber; a bad Scottish ale because of too much boring American hopping; a bad English pale ale because it's too sweet. This is an average micro-beer 10 years beyond deserving recognition. Now it's just a quaint player in a market full of dynamic offerings."
"This poured out a brownish bronze with a bout a half-inch head of off white foam. As the head dies off rather quickly the glass was left decorated with sparse patches of lace. Caramel sweetness rose from the glass in a pleasant but fairly mild aroma, that also had some fruit notes to it. Flavor had a strong caramel presence with a bit of an earthy hop kick to keep the sweetness in check. There were also notes of fruits and it was a bit doughy at times. The mouthfeel was good but feel a little short of a medium body. This stuff is pretty darn tasty and goes down very easy. I would definitely pick more up if it were available in the area. Thanks to bditty187 for this tasty bonus beer."
"Drinkability: Only had one, but it went down easy."
"Murky medium brown color, huge white head, leaves a lot of sticky lacing on the side of the glass going down. Taste has a good amount of carmel malts, which accentuate the strong hop presence. The body could stand to be a little thicker, but overall this was a solid beer, goo for a fallback in times of BMC only land."
"I'd have this one again."
"708"
"This baby is an easy drinker, very smooth after a rough pour and very malty. Nothing extreme, not even that impressive, just a solid drinker."
"Unknowingly this was my first experience with scottish ales, and i rather enjoyed it. 90 shilling poured a nice deep reddish-orange-brown, almost a cherry wood color. The head was less than bountiful but remained rather well throughout. The smell was nice, a sweet but slightly roasted malt touched with a bit of hops. The taste was much the same a nice balance of malt that was both sweet, and toasted with a bit of hops to keep things on even ground. The mouthfeel is very pleasant with nice carbination with medium body and the light bitterness. Overall this was a very nice beer that introduced me to scottish ales."
"Bottled on date of 11/6/03."
"90 Shilling is a dark reddish amber color with a nice medium head. Its aroma has subtle hints of citrus and caramel. Very nice tasting with hints of fig and a good hoppy finish. It doesn't taste like a normal Scottish Ale. Overall, a very drinkable beer - one of my old reliables."
"Dark hazy reddish brown in color with a decent off white head that sticks to my glass. Bready and caramel aromas, starts sweet and creamy with a hint of caramel, medium bodied, nice creamy and round mouthfeel, finishes smooth and clean, another good one from this brewery, very drinkable."
"Thanks to bditty for another dandy..."
"Thanks to prAna for sending me this. I like getting my hands on 90 Shilling beers, as I am a fan of the style. I didn't think this one was quite as good as Hoster's version but it was decent. Pours a dark amber color with a medium beige head and thin lacing. Earthy malt aroma. Body is fairly rich, with flavors of malt, caramel and a little fruit. Finish is lightly bitter. Overall pretty good."
"Overall, this was a disappointing beer. I have liked all the other Odell offerings that I have had. Maybe I got a bad bottle? I will have to give this beer another try."
"I can see this being very popular. On the other hand, it doesn't quite hold enough interest for me. Ah, well."
"Drink-up folks!"
"This brew comes right off the brewery tap with a deep dark copper color and a foamy thick whitish head.  The aroma is malty with a light hint of smoke and heavy spice hops.  The body is smooth and supports a dry malt character and a lingering mellow bitterness.  Not bad, a little too clean;  could use a little more oomph."
"90 Shilling Colorado Ale is a stick to your ribs Ale, thick and luscious."
"Orange-brown in color with a cream colored head that holds up fairly well and leaves some nice Belgian-lace. The aroma is really pleasing with a sweet, maltiness that contains caramel, toffee and a touch of fruitiness. Almost like a combination of Munich and Brown malts, but not quite. Rich, but not aggressive. The body and carbonation level are appropriate. The flavor starts malty and fruity, dries a bit at mid swallow, and then gives a spritz of hop flavor before leading into a lightly bitter dryness. Quite Scottish in nature up to a point, but I find the hop flavor unusual. The choice of hops seems a little odd. Still, a good beer."
"90 Shilling is an excellent amber.  A richer and heavier body than most ambers.  Brown sugar, pepper and pine create an unusually taste-flavor palate (reminds me of red rocket by bear republic only more subdued).  This is good beer, but nothing exceptional about it."
"Thanks to Jaybeerman for the sample."
"There are a myriad of ambers out there, but this one ranks among the best. To me this defines the style, but improves on it. A pronouced hop bitterness (for an amber) and flavor is perfectly balanced by a mellow but significant caramel malt profile. With an almost ""chewy"" maltiness and full body to complements the hop profile, 90 Shilling exhibits a rich balance. Lightly earthy hop flavor seems to be combination of Goldings and Willamette. It finishes with a slight toasty caramel sweetness on the back of the tongue. An excellent and highly drinkable amber. It's akin to an ESB minus the fruitiness."
"This is great stuff!!  Wonderful flavor, a taste of the west."
"Notes: A proud beer that was crafted for maximum drinkability and a superb balance. This is what American Amber ales are all about."
