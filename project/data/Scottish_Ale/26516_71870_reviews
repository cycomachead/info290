"Great smokey maltiness, my new fav scotch ale."
""

"The flavor profile is intense, complex, well balanced and is borderline outstanding.  It begins with a sweet burst of molasses and dark fruit that quickly yields to a roast bitterness.  Under the bitterness, caramel notes emerge in the middle.  Subtle smoke characteristics emerge right before the finish, gain in intensity and come to the forefront as the finish fades over a subsiding caramel and molasses sweetness.  In the lingering finish, prune notes are evident as well as a slight alcohol burn, subtle dryness and bitter pucker."

"Darker than it tastes. Extremely pleasant malt & spice finish."
"Light on the smokey, barely any nose, high carbonation. Good start for the night,solid beer, but will follow it up with a change."
"Pours a clear, very dark brown with a ruby tint when held to the light. The pour produces a solid 2 fingers of frothy, tan, shortlived, head that leaves a sheet like webs of lace. Aroma is dark malty roast, molasses, vanilla, butterscotch, some dark fruit & a hint of smoke. Taste is heavy roast, dark malt, molasses/caramel/vanilla, hints of dark chocolate, roasted nuts & a little earthy coffee with a buttery, smokey & faintly boozy finish. Afrertaste is sweet but deeply roasted malts, roasted nuts & molasses. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, creamy with a nice peppery prickle."

"Overall a great brew. I will definitely be coming back for this one, would be perfect with chocolate desserts or in the cold of winter."

"This is a pretty good, easy drinking beer.  I'd never have guessed this was 7.2 %.  I'd better watch myself!"

"Overall, a decent Scottish ale, but I would agree with the raters that say there are better.   Definitely an up and coming brewery, although I think they market better than they brew…"

"On draft at Brick and Tin in Birmingham. The aroma is the best part: fruity and malty."

"My first beer from Monday Night - it's pretty typical for the style, overall a good beer, but also nothing great about it. Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass, good light brown head on it that remained over the whole top until about halfway through. Seemed a bit over-carbonated, but other than that a pretty solid beer. Looking forward to more from Monday Night."

"O: Easy drinking brew. Enjoyable but nothing stands out with it. Bourbon barrel age this one and you might have something special."

"Overall – I know a scotch ale should be sweet, but this was just rather unbalanced and not all the great of a scotch ale. The flavors don’t really meld well on this one and with the rather poor mouthfeel and look, it really doesn’t have much draw."
"Overall not bad, nice brown malts, toasty, nutty, lots of caramel and toffee, nice mild bitterness and mild booze late, I almost wanted more booze warmth, nice carb, nice fig paste flavor, nice profile without getting too sweet or syrupy, pretty well done I think."
"Overall, the best thing about this beer is, well, it’s a tossup between the aroma and flavoring. That said this is, as a whole, arguably a tough sell for the style, as the butteriness and smokiness are rather subtle and subdued by the end of the glass. The smoke actually enhances and billows with warmth, matching the thickness of the beer. It does hit all of the desired and required notes you would expect at least once, but is generally just a bit weak. This is a tasty local swing at an admittedly challenging style, and while they don’t execute perfectly, it should satisfy for someone looking for something on the sweeter, maltier side of the craft beer spectrum."

"O: A really great surprise -- a malty delight with a light touch of smoke to provide a little uniqueness. A really fine beer from Monday Night."

"O - Overall this is a very fine representation of the style. Glad to try this one."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, slight smoke, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a better smoke presence in the aroma."

"Overall: very smooth. Alcohol is imperceptible. Nice job."

"O: This one gets your attention with a great malt and smoke tango. A great sipper with chocolate chip cookies or Swiss cheese. Probably great with barbecue, too. If you're a malt fan, drink up. A great surprise from this Georgia brewery."
""
""
"Overall - Eh. Not impressed. Just not a lot going on."
""

"EDIT: After looking at other reviewers, I'm wondering if mine is a little off. I'm finding zero smoke in the nose or the taste. Perhaps pounding too much Scotch has made me accustomed to it or this was just from an off bottle. Either way, I might try it again sometime as I just had a single this go around."

"I know this review is kind of weak from a technical standpoint, but I will update this after my next trip to Georgia and Shorty's Pizza."

"Better than Blind Pirate, but after the promise of the aroma, the taste was a step down. Bottle the aroma & this is a winner; still a pretty good beer."

"Had this on tap in Blue Ridge. Really an excellent choice from these guys, the new facility is turning out better beer than when they were contracting. Great balance, excellent smell. The best I have tried from them. Reminds me a bit of Gaelic Ale from Highland Brewing Company."

"-Overall 3.5: A very good Scottish Ale. The smokiness and malt flavors and bouquets are well-balanced and make for a refreshing and satisfying session beer. However, the low CO2 detracted from the overall experience. I would like to try this one again, but maybe after it sat in the kegger for a few extra days."

"I will have to try it again! Probably at a warmer temp., to bring out more complexity."

"Had this one during my buddy’s bachelor party! Tick all day, every day! Served from tap into a Samuel Adams sampler shaker. Poured a deep red brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, caramel hop, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk chocolate, wood, subtle smoke, nutty, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. If I am honest, everything for this brew’s style was pretty close to being spot on. It could have done quite nicely with a bit more complexity to carry it into a new realm, but it was fairly enjoyable for the most part with what it had going on. Not the best thing I had on the day of ticking, but definitely not the worst. I would try it again in the future."
"Mouthfeel: Medium full body."

"Terrific beer. Better than most from Scotland. Recommended."
"O: a very drinkable and rather dry Scotch Ale, ""Americanized"" with a healthy but well-proportioned dose of hops. Unique, perhaps due to the cherrywood-smoked malt."
"O - Not a bad showing but nothing to getting overly excited about."
"o - really nice beer and a great sipper."

"It's a shame that so many people start their beer drinking lives with the cheapest of the cheap beers like Keystone or PBR (which is having an odd renaissance with people whose taste buds have long since died along with their hearing.) They could have had a great beer like this one."
"Overall: A quality scotch ale. It's got an inviting richness to it without being bloated and enough soothing alcohol without being boozy or putting me in a coma for the evening. Yes, it's fair to say I enjoyed it."
"Comes out of the tap a barely transparent chocolate brown with a fine-bubbled light tan head. Rich, malty, chocolaty and spicy aroma invites a taste. Mouth-filling malty flavor has a spicy undertone and hints of chocolate and toffee. Strongly tingly texture leaves a persistent fizz behind."
