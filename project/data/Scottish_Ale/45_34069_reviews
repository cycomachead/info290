"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and I thought it was an average example of the style, it really didn't seem to Scotch Ale like, it reminded more of an average English ale, especially with that fruity English ale yeast flavor sticking out the most.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, not too crisp, not too filling, but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and one would be enough for me, the flavors doesn't want to me make drink another one.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance it was a pretty nice looking beer.  What I like the least about this beer was the balance, I wish the caramel malts showed up more and the fruity yeast showed up  less.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, but I wouldn't turn it down, it just isn't something that I'm that into.  I can't say I would recommend this beer, it doesn't have any aspect that makes it stand out.  All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer and in the end I wanted better balance from it.  It's on the lower end for this brewery and it's in the middle for the style.  I appreciate the effort, but this one just isn't for me, better luck next time."

"Couldn't differentiate from any other middle of the road winter ales."
"Pours copper with ruby hues and a light head of foam that fell pretty fast and left a thin ring.  Very clear. Nose is malty and fruity and with no big hop scents. A little tempting sweetness from alcohol on that nose .  Like sticky brown bread.  Caramel, earth and  dark fruits.  Taste is malty and sweet. Dry and with a bit of spice on the finish.  No alcohol on the palate. Mouthfee lis easy going medium.  This drinks so well. The breadiness , the carbonation and the dryness are a delight alongside the fruitiness and the rich malt and   caramel. it's like a nice sweet bread."

"Overall:  This is a pretty good beer, but nothing exciting.  The beer has a nice balance between malt and hops and sweetness, but it’s pretty forgettable once finished.  As a Brooklyn Brewery fan, I’m glad I tried it, but I probably won’t get it again, as there are much better Brooklyn beers out there as much better winter beers out there as well.  That being said, I’d certainly not turn this beer down if offered and would certainly enjoy it."
"I was excited to try a Scottish ale from Brooklyn Brewery, but this left me disappointed. This is a light, bland ale without the bite I expect from this style of beer."
"Refreshing and clean going down."

"Brooklyn Winter Ale brewed by Brooklyn Brewery. This brew has an ABV 6.10%  The brew pours out a nice dark amber color with a small off white head. Brooklyn Winter Ale has a rich smell. It is full of  flavors and sweetness. You pick up on some grains and malts in the smell of this brew. The taste is bold with flavor. Also in the taste , you pick up on malts and grains and some hops at the end. The mouthfeel is rich, bold , and smooth.  This brew has a strong,bold aftertaste.  There is a lot going on in this brew, there is nothing overpowering in this brew. Brooklyn Brewery did a nice job with this brew.  I would get buy this brew again.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5."

"Drain pour. Body and color of a soda, with sickeningly sweet nose and flavor. Honestly, I could barely stomach a couple of ounces. A pretty big disappointment from the normally solid brewery."
""
"A little cloying, and the fruity character doesn't jive. Bubblegum esters emerge. Tastes medicinal."
""
""
"O: OK; a little blah;"
"Skunk beer compared to my favorite Belhaven or Grants"
"Draught @ Bubba Gump NYC: This one poured a crystal clear amber color. There was a very small head that didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. Some spiciness and malts, but no real sweetness to the aroma. Decent enough taste. Somewhat dry, malts, spices. Pretty smooth. Not bad."

"Got a single bottle of this from Discount Drinks in Farmington Hills. Pours a clear ruby-amber color with a short tan head that dissipates fast. Medium amounts of lace. Smells of caramel, oak, honey, yeast, whiskey, wood. Tastes relatively sweet, a bit bitter, tinges of spice, wood, booze. Dry, medium bodied, and has ample amounts of carbonation. Overall, this was pretty good, I've always been a fan of Brooklyn Brewing but I only liked this one, I didn't love it."

"Although Brooklyn has had some hits, most of their product is mired in mediocrity. Frankly, I've never been able to understand the following. I could have picked up some rare bottles at what approached $30 for a 750cc, but, with their history in mind, it just didn't sound like a good idea. A few more beers like this one, and I'll be done with them for good."

"Brown, but with deep ruby/garnet hues when held up to the light. Cream colored head that retains decently. Deep caramel, hint of raisins. Touch of cocoa. Bitterness in the finish, but really no hop flavors at all. Mineral flavor. Smooth and prickly."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, apple, molasses, brown sugar, light roast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, apple, molasses, brown sugar, light roast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, raisin, plum, apple, molasses, brown sugar, light roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/yeast balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Scottish ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"The beer pours thick and has a slight white head. While I enjoyed the burnt toffee smell my nose could just barely discern. The mouthfeel feel is front heavy and short with powerful malt flavors reminiscent of a light Scottish ale. The burnt toffee notes linger on the palate pleasantly."

"BBD 3/22/14. Pours a clear nice red hued amber with a reasonable head and lacing that fades in 2 minutes. Light nose of molasses over dark fruit - plum with a touch of raisin. The body is medium with good carbonation. The mouthfeel is borderline smooth with a carbonation level above average. The flavor profile is weak - something a Scottish ale should never be. A weak hint of caramel malt and an alcohol presence is all there is over a very light sweetness. The finish is crisp, again, something a Scottish ale shouldn't be."
""
"12floz. bottle. Gordon´s Thistle glass. Reddish amber color, ruby tints to the light & chill haze appearance. Tan froth & close crown showing fairly good retention & leaving lacing on sides. Intense caramel malt, toffee & candy aromas, hints of sugar cane & molasses. Sugary & toasted upfront. Light body. Moderate but lively carbonation. Watery & sugary with a low herbal bitterness in the middle. Dry sweet/bitter finish & slight herbal liquor notes on the aftertaste."

"Overall: I have no idea why this is marketed as a ""winter ale," because there's nothing wintery about it other than that it's dark in color. It basically a straight session amber ale. I don't have much experience with Scottish ales, but this one does fulfill the expectation of being malt-forward and not super hopped. I enjoyed having this on tap but I can't say I'd jump at the chance to have it again unless it was the only craft offering at a bar."

"O- I'm the type that likes a nice malty, roasty winter ale compared to those that are chocked full of spices. That being said, this is a decent offering of the type I prefer. A decent malty and roasty profile."

"Nothing like an aggro pour to develop a nice cascading action, leading up to two-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-brown with garnet highlights among the NE-quality clarity. A second pour released some lees hiding at the bottom of the bottle and while I did not mind, it may be something for others to be mindful of. Best Before Date read ""4123117080220"" but it was indecipherable even to my cryptographic mind. Nose smelled medicinal, like a combination of molasses and anise. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching, but not achieving creaminess. The taste was primarily of molasses, but it was nowhere near as sharp as it was on the nose. Finish was semi-dry, as though the fermentable sugars had been mostly converted, but it was still too sweet for my taste. It kind of reminded me of the finish of a traditional English barleywine. Overall, not bad, but just not my cuppa joe."

"Overall-great winter ale, perfect for cold winter nights. This is the type of beer you take outside to keep you warm while shoveling your drive way. I got this on a close-out for less then a dollar a beer and at that price point you can't beat it. 4"
"Rich maple brown in color with a reddish hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a thick off-white foam that reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet caramel malt, earthy toasted malt, ripe fruit and buttery aromas. Medium bodied with a smooth buttery feel that subdues the rich carbonation. Sweet caramel and toasted malt flavors up front followed by ripe fruit amd a tangy, herbal hoppiness. Finsishes with sweet malty and buttery flavors."

"A great go-to for a Winter brew in my opinion."

"Looks very pale for the style but with good clarity. Laces the glass well and looks pretty decent, but rather pale. Smells like buttery toffee. In the taste, buttery and toffee like. Some grassy hops. Mild scotch style malts, but overall more akin to a uninspired English pale ale than anything. Light to medium bodied. Overactive yeast strain coats the mouth. Overall, a less than average beer with way too much diacetyl and butter to be palatable. Heavily rated scotch ale (over 600 reviews), the recipe must have been better in the past. This is a below average offering in every way. Avoid."

"Nice an malty from this one, a good winter beer with a slightly boozy feel to it and great drinkability. It goes down particularly well, is pretty well balanced and there is a good closeness between the aroma and the taste. Another fine beer from the guys at the Brooklyn Brewery, I'm already looking forward to my next beer from them."

"Between their Winter Ale and Black Chocolate Stout, Brooklyn's winter seasonals are a strong showing. Definitely worth a try, especially on tap paired with food."
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours clear dark copper with a two-finger length eggshell colored head. There are numerous tiny bubbles visible in the beer. Consumption of the beer leaves lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is sweet and roasty from the malt. There is an earthy hop aroma as well, but it's not strong. The flavor of this beer displays a strong malt backbone. There's mild caramel sweetness and good roastiness and nuttiness. The earthy hops are there in the back and provide some balance. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is high. This is a very good beer."
""
"A good but subdued ale, a bit bland in the flavor but otherwise nothing to complain about and easy to drink. I would have it again."
"This was an overall good, easy drinking beer with some nice bold flavors."

"I was hoping that it wouldn't be loaded with spices and fruit and I wasn't disappointed. This may be my beer find for 2014. Nothing but malt, hops, yeast and water. Malt is forward. Reminds me of the better Oktoberfests but thinner. Finishes smooth. Sort of evaporates on the tongue. No bitterness or metallic after taste. I could drink this before, with and after dinner."
""
""

"O - Average winter brew. The flavors are decent but nothing to write home about. Mouthfeel is subpar and thin."

"Smells of sweet malts, and typical scotch. Taste is like it smells...scotch, sweet malts, some dried fruit aftertatse. Ive had this many times but never really thought of this as a Scotch. Its very drinkable, nice flavors, and good flavors. Shame it is a seasonal..."

"12oz bottle purchased (last one!) from McKinnon's in Portsmouth. Caramel, toffee, and a bit of coffee mix in with some butterscotch in the aroma. Super malty - nut, coffee, toast, caramel, with notes of caramel and coffee. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Wow. Spot-on for the style and among the best Scottish ales I've had. Yummy. Can't wait for next winter!"
""
"Overall: Warming, nice British style winter ale (they claim Scottish roots for this beer). Not particularly complicated, but it delivers what it promised."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A well-crafted brew that seems reasonable to label ""Winter Ale", but that veers from typical Scottish Ale in the direction of a brown ale. Fine session beer, if the 6% ABV is kept in mind."
"Overall: A nice example of the style. Drinkable with a nice malt presence. My rating is based on its representation of the genre and drinkability combined."

"Comments: Thank you Garrett Oliver! Brooklyn’s Winter Ale is a wonderful example of Scottish ale. The web says this beer is 6.0% abv, however my bottle says 6.1% abv. The nominal strength is half a percent lower than guidelines for a Wee Heavy, but 1% abv more than an 80/- Scottish Export. All things said, Winter Ale taste like a Wee Heavy. Most importantly it avoids the two most common failings of American craft-brewed beer. First, it’s not too hoppy. Most American craft-brewers, especially those on the west coast, use far too many hops, even in beer styles in which it would be inappropriate. Second, Oliver doesn’t use whisky malt in this beer. Almost every other example of American craft-brewery’s Scottish ale uses this peat smoked whisky malt. This is simply inappropriate for a true Scottish ale. It is Scottish ale, not Scotch whisky. I can’t think of a better example of an American craft-brewed Scottish ale."

"I'm not a huge fan of the style, but Brooklyn does a good enough job with this one. I wouldn't want more than 1 or 2 of these though, and ideally would pair it with food."
""
"The yeast has certainly made its mark on this brew, bit of a butter bomb ... the core maltiness is secondary. If by chance I have this one again perhaps it would go better paired with a hearty stew or a sharp cheese to contrast."
"Overall this is a good beer. The availability is nice but its nothing outstanding, the price could come down a tad."
"Goddamn this is good! Not that I should be surprised, Brooklyn is usually pretty quality in whatever they do. Just don't overlook this if you're generally geared toward bigger beers, like I am, because this has plenty of flavor and pizazz. It's definitely worthy, and I'm glad I bought a 6-pack."
"up to hearty stews and meats. This beer is both pleasant and warming for those chilly winter nights. The simplicity of it makes it appealing."
""
"Poured a very nice deep brown with very nice head and good lacing throughout. Nice deep malty scent, very heady and thick with some nice earthiness in the nose. Good flavors, a very thick malty flavor with a bit of biscuit and a bit of roastiness in it. Went down quite well, very smooth."
"O: this is good to me and for its style"

"A decent enough beer from Brooklyn but not one I'd be desparately seeking again!"

"Beer is medium in body, not as sweet as the aroma would imply, it is a little bitter, dry on the finish, oddly peaty on the midpalate, decent, I like it, probably not a repeat though."
""
"Overall a beer worth trying. Just didn't blow me away."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. To be honest, I didn't read up on this beer before drinking it and was expecting another run-of-the-mill, overly spiced winter warmer. What I get instead is one of the best domestic, readily-available Scottish ales I've tasted to date. It's malty, yet somewhat balanced and brings to the table a wonderful flavor."

"RJT"
"Pint glass, reddish body, lots of bubbles, not much head. Big smokey nose with a hint of sweetness, some olive oil. Really wet and crispy with some bright cherry. A little fruity sourness toward the end, like a strawberry would give. A little hop bite, carbonation scratches the palate gently, and the burnt flavor just backing it all up"
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent Scotch. I'd prefer more hops and spices and bitterness to level this one out, 12oz of this was almost too much."
""
"had this beer from the 12oz bottle. Served cool. Dark amber color and a nice creamy head. Smell lightly smoke (peat). Metallic and woody. Taste is not what I expected. No spice. The combination of malts gives an earthy quality to this. Thick on the tongue and drinkable but not something I would really seek out as a winter pick. Might want to save this as a food beer with Scottish fare. Not as a ""winter warmer"" like beer."
""
""
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the fruity qualities to the flavoring. This beer was great for the season, but less so for the style. A Scottish ale should be darker, with more booze and caramel, and to this point we were disappointed. The grain also had an interesting sour bite that we would have liked to see elaborated on, or at least more cleanly integrated with the rest of the flavoring."
""
""
"for more."
""
""
"Overall, pretty good, nothing crazy but certainly decent."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Its a great wintertime beer that would be awesome on a cold night. I was expecting a little heavier on the body but I was pleasantly surprised at how thin and easy to drink it was. This is a beer I'd come back to again in the right circumstances."
""
""

""
""
""

"Taste is sweet and spicy, with up-front tones of peat malts, earthy, fruity, leathery. A solid and tasty winter ale from a brewery who does most everything right."
"Poured a 1"" beige velvet head with decent retention. The body is burnt umber brown in masstone but held to the light it's a clear dark amber. The smell is a touch of malt. Taste also has some malt and I might have guessed spicing but from the profile I know that's not the case, it's just the creaminess and richness of the Scottish style. Medium length finish. Decent beer."
""

"Highly recommended!"

"Some astringency and syrupy maple sweetness, lingering aftertaste of toasted bread and dried fruit. It has the odd twang of oxidation somehow. Medium bodied and pretty sweet at first. The astringency and odd fruity tanginess are somewhat off putting, wouldn't try this again."
""
""
"I don't care much for the style, but this wasn't bad. There was a bit of rye in the nose, but never in the taste and it was somewhat less Scottish than I expected, which was a welcome surprise."

"poured a seasonal red color with zero head. dont know if time passed between the pour and the serve, but absolutely no head. not flat, just awkward in the glass. i wont hold it against this beer too heavily, because im sure the bottled version is more lively. smells a bit sweet and ambery, with a faint holiday spice thing going on in the finish. not spicy, but spiced, cinnamon is definitely there in spirit at least. mouthfeel is fuller bodied which is nice here. worked well with barbeque but would also certainly excell after dinner with or as desert. not my favorite brooklyn beer, but it has a role"
"D- Overall, not a bad beer. It's nothing I would seek out but it could hit the spot on a chilly evening."
""
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this. Nothing groundbreaking, but a tasty little brew and one of their best seasonals. I will definitely be picking up more of this."
""
"This is a pretty good beer. Nothing out of this world but it is solid."
""
"Lots of carbonation here with curtins of small thin bubbles streaming from the bottom of my glass. Very enjoyable to look at. Color is nice too with the beer having a rich chestnut brown color thats quite clear. Aroma is malty with some toffee. Taste is good. It has a rich malt flavor with a good dose of toffee like in the nose. There's a little bit of roasted malt in there too. A medium weight beer witha smooth and soft texture. A good well made beer thats a fine example of the style."
"O: I find this beer to be pretty decent. This would make a perfect session beer and it was rather cheap. Overall this is an above average beer."
""
"Overall – Nothing that make me look forward to this seasonal release every year, but still a good tasty and easy to drink beer. Fans of scotch ales will enjoy this one for sure."
""
""
""
"This is a nice beer. A solid winter ale. High on drink ability."
"Overall: A pretty good take on a Scottish ale. Nice use of malts."
""
""
"Overall, it's nice, but I'd go with an Avalanch Winter beer over this one."
"It's starting to feel a touch like Winter out there, so might as well embrace the season with the ""appropriate"" beer, eh? It pours a slightly hazy tawny-russet topped by a relatively short-lived finger of dusty tan-cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, mandarin orange syrup, light spruce, very light honey, and a particularly small twinge of Laffy Taffy-style strawberry hidden in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch of graham cracker to round things out. I may or may not detect a pinch or two of nutmeg and brown sugar as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a very lightly chewy feel. Overall, a pretty nice beer, nothing exceptional, but a nice Winter quaff, if you're in the market for such a thing."

"Good winter seasonal beer, nothing too impressive but very drinkable."
"Easy drinking with mild flavors but not the best scotch ale I've had. Nor is it a beer that necessarily reminds me of winter. When it comes to winter scotch ales ill take the hibernator by long trail any day. Not saying this is a bad beer, but for a seasonal release not something im gonna search out."

"Overall – An average Scotch Ale. Worth the tick."
""
"O: This isn't complex and is rather malty and simple, but I like it. It's a nice warming beer for the late Fall/Winter."
""
""
""
"Clear auburn body. Nice off white head. Lace is moderate. Smell is pretty nice. Malty and clean. Flavor is simple but good. Nice maltiness with a little bit of candy like sweetnes as well. Goes down pretty easy with a medium body and light to moderate carbonation. Pleasing beverage."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass, best by Apr 12. This pours a brownish red color with a decent tan head which dissipates down to a thin layer. The smells are mostly of malts and toffee. The feel is medium with good carbonation. The taste is again mostly malts and toffee. with little bitterness, and a little spice."

"Overall - It was decent, very basic in my opinion, nothing that particularly stood out or offended me. Just a decent brew."
"Not sure about this one..."
"Worthy of another purchase."
"Dunno what this tasted like before the recipe changed, but I doubt that I care as this was a supremely tasty winter beer that really hit the spot. Ya spicing a beer is fun I'm sure, but with such a delicious malt flavor, I don't see the necessity of spice at all."
"This beer pours a clear amber-brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of tons of caramel and toffee with some nice floral notes in the background. The taste is similar to the aroma with nice malty depth. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a solid beer that I would happily drink again."
"Slight sour finish. Slight dry aftertaste."
"O- I recognize it as a well made beer but some of the aspects, particularly on the nose just didn't particularly appeal to me."
"Overall: Very well done Scottish Ale. This is the kind of beer that beer geeks tend to ignore. They shouldn't."
"Overall, this is a wonderful winter brew, and despite its lack of added spices, would go down well on a cold December night, especially if that entails snuggling in front of the fireplace with a loved one."
"This poured out as a nice looking deep red color. The head was fizzy and white. The lacing was minimum. The smell of the beer had a lot of malts on the nose, it was also pretty sweet smelling. The taste had lots of malts in there, big caramel flavors and some toasted bread aromas. The taste was of brown sugars and malts. The aftertaste was sweet and dry. The mouthfeel was smooth and semi-thick feeling. Overall this beer was pretty good all around I thought."
"D - Very drinkable. The beer feels really smooth and well balanced. Could use a bit more kick, but there is enough flavor to keep it interesting and it does not feel too watery."
"Drinkable, but rather one-dimensional for the style. Lacks the fruitiness that characterises a good scottish ale. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Probably quite nice when drunk next to a roaring fire, but it won't blow you away."
"All in all, this is a Scottish Ale with a certain hop bite. The Scottish part I like, the hoppy part I like, but the two don't seem to tango as nicely as I would have hoped. While I do not dislike this brew, I have no reason to go back to any time soon."
"This beer is OK, but certainly not a favorite. Brooklyn certainly has better offerings than this."
"Brownish orange with a hint of red. A bit of head with low retention. Spicey, light phenolics, bready malt, dark fruit. Malty but a little lacking. In the mouth it feels a little thin and a little flat. Seems like the mouth feel and carbonation effect the taste negatively. Overall, not a bad beer but I wish it tasted as good as it smells.."
"Overall: Not overly pleased with this beer. Hard to actually determine what they're trying to do with it. Is it a saison? Does it want to be a scotch ale when it grows up? Unfortunately, it does none of these styles well."
"Overall - the flavors and style isnn't my usual cup of tea, but this was an easy and pleasant beer none the less. If offered I would definitely be glad to take one and enjoy but with so many other options out there I doubt I would buy again."
"Pours a deep copper colour, one finger of white head with some lace on the glass. Smells of malt, hops, caramel and a slight sweetness of toffee. Taste is malty, spicy, warm cinnamon notes, firm bitterness and a good hop profile. Quite full mouthfeel, slightly creamy with good carbonation. Drinks well, with so many scotch and winter beers available it would be hard to put this ahead of most of them, it is good and I would have it again, solid overall."
"Bottle. Pours a dark amber color with a minuscule off white head. Nose is lightly nutty with a sweet malt note. Some spicy notes here as well. Flavor is sweet with woody, earthy overtones Sweet like cinnamon. Texture is medium. Long finish with no distracting aftertastes. Taste is consistent throughout the swallow. Overall a good beer. I was hoping for a little more spiciness or complexity, but this beer is strongly malty."
"The CPJ"
"D: mouthfeel and lack of complexity lend to high marks here. First time I had this brew was on draft in the city and I remember thinking similarly of its on-tap version. A solid choice when out socially at a non-beergeek bar, but this won't make it onto my shelf at home anytime soon."
"Overall it was not bad, rather ehh, but still better then a lot of the style. I would not really have a problem with trying this one again if it was sent to me. Definitely an interesting take on the style."
"A shame really - As winter ales go this is no winner. I do prefer the non-spiced variety as this is but it needs a kick up the arse. A ballsier hop bill, touch more alcohol and little bit more aggression overall would have seriously improved this slightly weak and ill-mannered little ale. Reminiscent of a very traditional, old style English ale - not particularly memorable."
"I like the idea of a Scottish style winter ale. I wish they did a little more with it."
"Very solid beer by Brooklyn brewery; easy to drink."
"D- Looks good, smell good, but perhaps a little lacking in richness on the palate and moutfeel a little thin. Pleasant enough though!"
"mouthed: sour sweetness...tangy...real tangy..lemony...roasted malts...some kind of wood in there...the first interesting beer i have had in a while...not an all day drinker though...6.1%....coppery...the alcohol is not brave but also not hidden..it comes between sips..."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a clear amber with a nice 2 to 3 finger head, not a lot of retention and lacing. Malt heavy smell. A little bit of graininess coming through. Tastes malty as the smell gives on, very light up front. A bit of earthiness comes through. Maybe a touch of hops. Light to medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. This one didn't put it together for me."
"Overall, not a bad drink. It went down faster than expected, but not a great interpretation of the style. Something missing and a bit off here. Ok, but I won't look for this again."
"Interesting - I'll give 'em that. I let it warm up long, and it brought out the best. A little too muted and restrained."
"D: Twelve ounces is enough for me."
"An ok option for someone looking for something new, but nothing to rave about and lacks the solid caramel I love from scottish styles."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - The drinkability isn't so good here. The flavors were pretty muted and it was a bit watery. I just wasn't at all what I was expecting from a winter beer."
"d - A pretty good scotch ale that is above average and pretty easy to drink. Would order again."
"D- Very easy to drink and revisit"
"This beer poured a dark reddish color with a little bit of head. Smelled like typical ales and not very strong. Not impressed at all. The taste was thin and not very flavorful like other winter offerings. I could drink this beer easily, but for a seasonal release I expected more. I would pass on this beer."
"sweet and spicey, but not too overwhelming like some winter warmers. but kinda weird aftertaste. higher carbonation, medium body."
"Middle of the pack beer. Although this one might now wow you, it's a nice beer to enjoy on a cold night."
"D- Interesting Scottish style beer. Not bad. I would be ok if I had another one or not."
"Very drinkable because of its smooth and crisp light to medium body, Brooklyn's winter offering does not stand out. But it also doesn't dissapoint."
"Verdict: If it's a beer priced in the $7-$9 sixer range, it's worth it, but this isn't great or astounding beer."
"One of the other reviewers used a term I hadn't heard before but I like very much, ""scorched sugar"" hits in on the head. The beer has loads of upfront malts, some warming notes, some caramels that tend to bite, some charred notes as well. I like the scorched sugar characterization best. What is lacking here is the smoked character, peaty qualities of a Scottish Ale. There aren't any. This is an okay beer I'm not coming back to anytime soon. It's medium bodied, and some of the malty charred sweetness hangs on the tongue a little longer than I would prefer."
"Traditional Scottish Ale tastes. Sweet like the nose. Not cloying at all though. Mouthfeel seemed just a tad astringent. Very drinkable. I would like to have this with some red meat."
"Unfortunately, this first beer I've had from Brooklyn will be put into service as one to cook with through the remainder of the winter."
"Impressed with the rich sweetness of this brew. Glad to see another winter release that doesn't rely of heavy doses of spice. I really like this beer, but the richness lessons the drinkability in my opinion."
"Is it close to style? Most likely. But being close to style and being good are two different things. I'm certain there are many more winter ales out there that are worthy of your time, and many more selections from Brooklyn that are too, this is not one of them."
"D - Great drinkability, great winter ale."
"My first brooklyn ale in a way kind of what I expected but I want to see what else they have to offer."
"D-Quite drinkable a decent winter beer."
"This is a stylish winter ale that one could enjoy over a long, dark winter evening; a very good effort by this brewery."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Nothing that I have to get every year or anything, but I certainly don't mind when I do. As far as the style goes, this is an above average scotch ale."
"DB- Definitely carries the traits of a Scottish ale while still drinking fairly easily. Not something I would buy a lot of but still pretty nice."
"Avoid."
"D: Very drinkable. Not the typical spicy Christmas ale if that's what you're expecting."
"4.0 D: Not as flavorful, but also not as cloying, as a lot of Scottish ales. Good enough for another one."
"D: Not quite the best winter beer, but good overall."
"Drinkability -- Not too bad, though I'd say it's pretty middle-of-the-pack. Drinkability is good, but it's not thrilling. Flavor profile is a bit flat, and lacking some of the caramelized malt flavor that typifies the style. I can think of several other Scottish ales I'd choose over this, most of them being year-round offerings."
"Big head on pour which disappears shortly thereafter. The color is reddish brown. Smells and tastes of malt and is sweet only in the first taste, then is rather dry. Drinks better than it tastes by which I mean a pleasant but not overly memorable experience, with no ""winter"" spices or odd distractions added. This is almost like drinking a Newcastle Brown Ale: a passable but not overly memorable ale. I'd say Sierra Nevada or Full Sail produce Winter Ales of greater character and interest but if you like the Brooklyn Brown, you'll like this one fine too."
"It's an interesting choice for a winter beer. While others seem to rely on thicker, sweeter beers for winter seasonals, this is not like that at all. I'm not a huge fan of smoky beers and didn't think that this beer was otherwise all that noteworthy...but it's far from bad."
"This is a beer you can have a few of, but there are better winter ales out there to be certain."
"Notes: just has that pils malt quality, maybe its the diacetyl. whatever it is tastes average, like they are more concerned with just getting it out the door. love a few of their offerings but overall just think they do average brews."
"Drinkability: I usually don't drink Winter ales because I often find the spices overwhelming. This ale doesn't have that distraction, so I will gladly have another."
"Drinkability is OK but I would need to mix a couple dry lagers or one hoppy pale ale in the mix to drink these all night."
"Poured into a tumbler pint. Toffee colored beer with a quick receding head. Smells and tastes very malty with a strong toffee-like flavor. No hops noted in smell or taste. Pretty thick body, velvety feel on the tongue, booze well-hidden. I won't go back for more of these."
"Drinkability: Excellent. Great solo beer, would be good as a session beer."
"A very delicious winter ale, and my (I think) first Scottish. I too was surprised to find that there are no spices in it, which makes it pretty special to me, and I was very pleased with its deep flavor profile. Pairs very well with some of the more hoppy winter ales like Celebration. I have no doubt that I will buy -and enjoy- this again."
"Brooklyn Winter boasts a caramel brown color with orange edges and some faint rising bubbles. Up top, a nice amount of foamy suds that are mediumish tan with fullness. It goes down quick but can be brought back to life. Smelling this, I was like what the hell does this smell like, and then it hit me, Lager, Yuengling lager to be exact. No hop scent, just caramel, malt and some grain. The corn is missing and Im thankful for that. Well, going in im surprised that yes, this indeed tastes like Yuengling Lager, down to a T. A bit richer though. The feel is medium, smooth, and easy, carb is minimal, just a touch letting you know this is alive, no bite, no bitter. I drank this pretty quick. It's simple beer for simple minded folks like me."
"I really enjoyed this brew.. Malty and deep and delicious... Excellent seasonal brew..m. Good job, Brooklyn!"
"Nice smooth beer, very concealing of it's 6% ABV. I think it's also extremely drinkable. This might be my go-to beer for the holiday season."
"Great drinability. It's easy going, and tasty."
"Deep amber w no head. Caramel malty nose and taste. Medium bodied & semi watery for a scottish ale. Pretty enjoyable since I tend to find them to be too thick & syrupy usually. Nice one. Very drinkable with a nice candy like finish."
"Overall, I liked this one. I'm glad to see my palate has developed some since I had it last where I hated it since it tasted just like dough to me. Certainly worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is good, could be a little better. I find many Scottish Ales to be a little creamy and this drifts off a bit further from the trend. Certainly full bodied, with a slight bitter finish. No alcohol bite and good carbonation levels. Drinkability is good. All in all another quality beer from Brooklyn Brewery."
"Notes: This one is one or two months past its stated prime. I suppose that I might present better if it was not past its prime, or on tap. I would say based on the bottle that I consumed that it is a solid scotch ale."
"D: This beer is one that can be quickly consumed. It's rather sessionable, particularly during the colder weather months."
"D- an interesting idea for a winter seasonal. not many breweries are doing a scotch ale for their winter beer. id probably come back to this one again next year."
"D - May need a fresh one and will update review but overall a pretty solid brew."
"Notes: This is a very solid example of the Scottish ale style and a great winter treat."
"It's medium bodied with only moderate carbonation, and the 6% abv is not even detectable, so it's an easy drinker."
"All in all not my favorite winter beer but by far not my least favorite. Would definately but this again."
"If you are holding on to any it will probably be past it's best by date after this month, so drink up or toss it."
"D: Good stuff, easy to put down, and nice ABV."
"I feel like I'm missing out by not having this on cask. Still, tasty and sessionable. The kind of beer I'd love to buy a keg of."
"Verdict: Straightforward and easily drinkable, though ultimately just a little thin and coppery, Brooklyn Winter Ale is a slightly uninspiring winter seasonal. If there was some smokiness and peat character mixed in, this could be a solid Scottish Ale."
"Easy drinking winter ale and another good one from Brooklyn. This is a solid scottish ale and doesn't lift your kilt up but it is still very nice."
"D - Pretty easy drinking but not too much like the style it claims to be."
"Notes: Not overly Scottish in flavor, more of a dark sweet bread. Decent beer though."
"Medium carbonation and good overall body. Another nice offering by Brooklyn Brewery."
"D: This is good winter ale, but not my favorite style. As with some other Brooklyn beers, I find the bready character too pronounced. That said, it's still enjoyable and a quality ale."
"D - Good. I could knock back a few of these. I wouldn't go to any major lengths to seek this one out again, but I would purchase again for sure."
"I think this is by all means a fine winter ale, lucky I gots myself a few for the next days."
"D - ABV is fairly low but for some reason this beer will sneak up on you. Probably the big flavors soothing you into a beer euphoria. Not the most remarkable scottish ale but solid in every respect."
"Drinkability: A very good, tasty, drinkable beer. Perfect for winter."
"if you can find it pick up a sixer and find out how drinkable it can be.its smooth rich malts speaks for itself nice and freshing.. cheers."
"The mouthfeel is also right on for the style. There is a nice balance between crisp carbonation and luscious soft body. The result is a smooth creamy beer with a light sizzle on the tongue. A pleasure to drink with the feel of it and the lingering warm caramel malts in the finish. A nice beer that I'd like to drink all year long despite the name."
"Drinkability: A great beer and one of my new favorite winter seasonals. I wish this one were easier to find in my area and a little cheaper but this is really good. I'll certainly be trying to find more by the end of the season."
"This is an excellent winter beer. It's not the assault on the senses that some Scottish Ales can be, but it's solid in it's own right. Goes great with pot pie."
"Drinkability: Definitely very sessionable and I could see myself having another had I bought more than one. Went well with vegetable soup and bread (a cold winter dish) but I could see this going very well with a hearty stew as well."
"D: I could drink a few of these."
"Drinkability is ok. The flavor is not particularly complex in my opinion and there isn't much here to make me want to have another, but I'd drink it if I had to. Its not terrible, but I've had much better examples of the style."
"Poured into a pint glass, nice clear, dark amber color. Not much head at all. No lacing. Smell is spicy, malty and fruity. Taste is very much the same: cinnamon, apple and malt. Biscuit undertones. Good taste for a winter brew. They call this a Scottish ale, I guess that's okay but Robert the Bruce is unbelievably better. This is not bad though. Drinkability and carbonation are good."
"Pours a deep dark brown with ruby highlights. Minimal head on this one. Smell is of sweet malts with slight nods to grass and earth. Taste is more mellow than scent dictaed, but slightly muddled earthy and sweet malt taste with very little complexity seems messy. Metallic and herbal presence confuse the palate. Hops lead to a bitter finnish at the end. Medium bodied, slightly overcarbonated for the style. Muddled and messy for the style, needs more flavor and charachter."
"Drink is decent.Nothing really jumping out at me but a good winter ale. Just a malty beverage."
"Cheers!"
"Orange/amber in color with no head. Malty metallic scent. This is accentuated in the taste. Roasted malt present up front, but then something reminiscent of a rusted iron pipe. There's also a faint hint of hops. It's gotta be the style, because I've just never run across a Scottish Ale that I've enjoyed. Short review, but just not a lot to say about this one."
"Poured from a cellar-temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. Beer is a beautiful clear tawny brown with many rising bubbles visible. Head is thick and tan, long-lasting, with very small bubbles. The smell is malty and slightly toasted, mildly yeasty. This beer is delicious! It tastes of caramel and toasted malts, and finishes sweet but clean. A lingering maltiness follows in my mouth. The carbonation lends crispness and keeps the beer from feeling heavy or thick. Despite the higher alcohol content, this beer is very smooth and mildly warming, without any harshness or heat. This beer is very drinkable - I could spend a long winter evening drinking pint after pint."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer has a beautiful, clear rust color, with a thick tan foam head. There is an earthy hop aroma. It has a good malty flavor, with a distinctly cream ale feel. It's very good; heavy body and not too much carbonation. This is a fine Scottish style ale, one that I want to drink more of."
"A solid effort but not really one of my favorite winter/Christmas ales."
"Fine beer with a weak nose, but a solid flavor that works around the holiday season well."
"D- Despite being underwhelming in the aroma, taste and mouthfeel departments... this beer does seem to go down smooth nonetheless. It is low enough in alcohol that it's almost sessionable."
"Value: Way overpriced for a product that will be sure to annoy the budget conscious beer drinker."
"I can definitely tell this one is a Scottish ale although it tastes more English to me. Nothing special in the appearance, dark gold, the big ivory head was weak, unspectacular and fizzled quick. Toasted biscuit and sweet malt aroma, same in the taste. Nothing complex and a metallic taste in the finish. Very unimpressive, not that it's a terrible beer just mediocre example. Too much carbonation."
"D - Certainly drinkable."
"Definitely a highly drinkable beer. The feel is very enjoyable, and the flavors and aroma are mild enough to please pretty much any beer drinker."
"D - Very warming and refreshing beer. Good choice for seasonal holidays."
"This poured a clear dark copper with some tan head. It smelled like roasted barley and bread crust, with sweet caramel and some copper and vanilla. It tasted like copper and caramel and bread crust, with some vanilla and roasted barley. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very nice, clean tasting beer with good holiday flavors that weren't overdone. It had great body too, and was very easy to drink. Nothing too exciting or unique, but this is a solid winter seasonal."
"D- drinkability is good, I guess you can hace two or three until you crave something more complex."
"Overall not as complex as I would have liked and really doesn't warrant the price for a six pack. Pretty dull, but I say that about most Scottish ales. Meh."
"Pours a copper color with just a thin bit'o head that settles into a ring. The aroma is pretty muted on this beer; all I really pick-up is some faint grassyness and some slight crispness. The front end is very crisp and pretty thin - not a whole lot of flavor. The middle offers a lot more malt flavor, but then it finishes pretty thin with some lingering from the malts. Overall, the balance isn't great on this one; too much carbonation, not enough body. A rare miss from from Brooklyn."
"This could be served as a good gateway beer, neither too heavy for a beginner or too light to give a proper impression. After this one, though, bigger brews should follow. This is also plenty good as a session beer."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Goes down pretty easy."
"Pretty nice and drinkable, but a little bland and disappointing considering the promise of the nose. Nice enough though."
"I'm usually a big Brooklyn fan and maybe me expectations were high but I was disappointed in this one. I thought one of their weaker efforts. It started out well pouring with a clear rich amber color and a nice thick head. It also laced great, marking every sip. But as good as it looked I thought the taste lacked any character. Slightly bitter finish. Don't get me wrong it is a well made ale and most seem to like it, just did not excite me."
"Only problem is that the sweet malt flavor profile is rather one dimensional. There isn't much else going on. I could have a couple...but might get bored of it."
"Medium bodied with some okay mouthfeel. A little spicy and tingly on the tounge. It is definitely drinkable."
"Cheers!!"
"MF&D - Medium bodied. Didn't really hace the smokiness of a Scotch Ale, but still a decent seasonal brew."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable malty beer. This one reminds me of their Octoberfest with different spices--at least in the maltiness. I could have several."
"Brooklyn Winter Ale tastes like a Scottish Ale Lite. But I like that because its not heavy and cloying, but (relatively) light and refreshing. While there are some of the heavy Scottish ales that I love, but I don't know, maybe this is just a case of hitting the right spot, maybe tomorrow I would rate it down. The color is a legitimate red, with a small, off white head that faded. The aroma is malty sweet and floral. The taste is sweet and slightly soapy. It is medium bodied and well carbonated, and drinkability is very good."
"D - This beer doesn't quite hit the marks like Dirty Bastard, but at 6% and bring the only Scotch Ale around NO, I'll take this tasty brew"
"Basically, I agree with the previous reviewer. This Scottish ale is somewhat astringent yet very easy to drink. Not the maltiest of Scots, and not the best brew this brewery has to offer. Straight B's for Brooklyn Winter Ale."
"This beer is a pretty average offering."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This beer pours a handsome reddish-copper color, with a thick inch-tall head. Lacing is good. The nose is moderately malty, caramel with a slight toasted edge, with a bit of noble hop aroma. A generous maltiness is the dominant taste component, offering a smooth caramel flavor with a bit of light toasted breadcrust. Hops are restrained but detectable."
"Get one!"
"A pretty nice Winter beer. Would go well with Christmas dinner."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark red color, but almost brown. Huge white head creates a nice contrast. Nice looking beer. Smell was full of malt. Taste was very pleasing. Malty backbone. Toasted chestnuts, cinnamon, and even a bit of peat are what I tasted. This might be one of the better tasting winter ales on the market. Not overloaded with spice, but enough to lend it some taste. Lots of malt flavor, but just enough to make it very drinkable. Sturdy body, but goes down well. This is the kind of beer that is perfect on a cold night or by a fireplace. Does Brooklyn make any boring beers? Nope, this one is a winner for me."
"This is really bland. I was looking forward to this because I love Scottish Ales. This is not a good example of the style. No peat, smoke, or any real toasted flavor. Besides Brooklyn Chocolate Stout, I have had nothing that I really enjoy from them. Not something I would recommend."
"Overall, pleasantly drinkable and subtle. Flavor reminds me of a Vienna Lager, in the SA Boston Ale vein."
"Very drinkable, this is a standby beer if you are looking for one this winter."
"D- I would have never have guessed this was a Scottish Ale. With that being said it is a nice winter brew. Not over the top, but with the medium body, some etoh heat, and darker flavor profiles."
"D = This is an eminently drinkable beer, it goes down very smoothly, combines a good amount of light refreshing tastes and senses with nonetheless a good sweet, warm malt presence."
"Taste: Caramel and a little brown sugar. Kinda dry. Mild bitterness."
"A decent winter ale. Definitely malt heavy with loads of earthy hops. Almost like a lager in its cleaness with just a touch of fruitiness. Not bad, not great, i would love some more complexity."
"Drinkability: Its good stuff. Not outstanding, but really solid."
"this beer pours a blonde amber color with an off white head that fades with a quickness. the aroma offers up some fruity esters with a bit of caramel sweetness at the back. the taste follows suite with a nice sweet almost spicey taste up front with an intersting hop finish. the mouthfeel is good with a little higher co2 than I would have expected, but a really nice drink with a some really nice caramel notes."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry caramel aroma that's pretty nice, but nothing spectacular. The taste is decent as well. It has a very dry crystal malt flavor with little hop character. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average beer, but a lousy Scottish ale."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but something about it just doesn't fit. Overall, a pretty decent beer, though."
"This beer is very drinkable, I have not bought alot of ""winter"" beers per say in the past, to me winter time is my stout time - but this is very drinkable and good. I could get a case and enjoy on a cold night - very nice."
"Just as any vintage of wine reflects the climate of where it was grown and that season's weather, so too should a beer provide similar sensations. I wouldn't have considered this beer great but for it to draw my imagination into a cozy Scottish local, harbored from the damp, windy February weather just by the taste of it, then surely that's a beer well made."
"Poured a beautiful mahogany color. Smelled of caramel malts. Taste was of caramel malts and maybe hint of nutmeg? Hides the alcohol well but there is enough there to give you that warming feel. Good carbonation on this medium/full bodied beer. Drinkability is good especially during these cold witner months, enjoyable beer."
"Cheers"
"Pretty good drinkability. Overall not a must-try, but it was worth drinking. I like the toasted/roasted malt flavor. A better beer than I feared it would be, since the friend who gave this to me said he didn't like it, and I know he's a big Brooklyn beer fan."
"A fairly drinkable scotch ale. Nothing great here, but not too bad. Worth a try."
"MF/D: Eh, drinkable, but not a session beer. Honestly, my thoughts of Brooklyn Brewery have subsided, as each offering I try seems to get worse and worse."
"Overall this beer really didn't click with me, nothing overwhelmingly bad about it, but nothing that would make me want to buy it again...the taste just wasn't there, not really balanced."
"D - This is a pretty good scottish ale. I like this take on a winter ale, because it wasn't just a winter warmer."
"Overall an okay brew but I feel like something is slightly missing here even though in general im huge fan of brooklyn brewery this one is good though could be slightly better."
"Nice enough beer, but not the best in the pack by a stretch. Esters in the finish throw the package off."
"feel is smooth but slightly thin, plus somewhat astringent finish. carbonation seems a bit too fizzy."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was orangey brown with a 1 finger white bubbly head. The head left a thin layer that clung to the sides well. Aroma was sweet, smelled of vanilla, honey, and citrus. Flavor was sweet, spicy, cloves with some malty aftertaste. Felt goo in the mouth, coated very well, just enough carbonation to give it kick. Almost too sweet to drink."
" Overall Impression: Taste seemed off with possibly oxidized. I will need to acquire another six pack to determine if mine was contaminated."
"The feel is thick and syrupy. Smooth and buttery. It's a decent, sweet ale. I would like a tad of a burnt balance but I'll take this one."
"D: At a little over 6%, I couldn't drink more than 3-4 of these in a short evening. Which means it's pretty drinkable"
"Very alcohol tasting to be honest, and lots of bite...too much bite. It is too strong, in my opinion, not enough balance."
"d - With a fair amount of carbonation and nothing overpowering on the taste, this could stretch into a session beer. In fact I picked up a six pack after having it on draft last weekend (not the first beer of the night) and it holds up nicely. The tangy, slightly bitter finish reminds you to take one more sip."
"In the end, I thought this Winter Ale was too sweet with sweet yeast, it couldn't make up its mind whenever to go with roasted or burnt malts, and the aroma was not good. One of these was good enough for me."
"D: This is a great session beer that pairs really well with thicker foods like stew. It can take spice and help deflect it a bit as well as enhance its underlying sweetness."
"Good full mouthfeel and a very drinkable beer. I was surprised with this beer."
"Malty with up-front caramel flavors. Something a bit off with the smell; a bit sick-sweet, which compounds the sweetness of the beer. Nice carbonation. Sweetness moderated by dry bitter finish, but the finish is overbearing. Probably would not buy this again."
"D- Brooklyn Winter Ale is a pretty solid Winter seasonal that is pretty tasty and worth a shot."
"Part of a Christmas gift basket from Bob--thanks! Reddish brown body that allows some light to pass... consistent effervescence... hints a t a malty character... three-finger head is brown and settles with arches in its lacing... malt and a bit of something skunky (!) after cleaning a basement yesterday, this beer seems to reflect that dampness... medium-bodied, throat immediate impact... a bit of fizz but not bubbly... a reasonable aftertaste, compact but true... malts are predominant, giving this winter warmer a hardy, strong base with some fruit esthers late--a pleasant pint... a solid offering from Brooklyn, malty but not overstated... the hops are conspicuously restrained, mellowing its flavor... I'd six-pack this at a later date..."
"Drink - Extremely easy. A great winter! I will definitely pick some more up"
"Overall - An enjoyable winter beer to check out."
"D - I'm a fan of Scottish Ales, and this is a very good one. While some lean too much on the malt sweetness, I find this ale to be a great balance. I could easily session with this beer, and I plan on picking up more before winter is over."
"Nice medium-bodied holiday ale, especially for having the spice without additives. Better than average as a Scottish ale, too."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with orange hues and a one finger off white head with good retention and patchy lacing. Aromas of toasted malt, apricot, caramel. There is a biscuity flavor up front with some chocolate and a tea like hop middle with the sweet malt and fruity yeast flavors in the finish. Medium carbonation and body with a very dry finish. Very drinkable."
"D: A good beer that seems like an amped-up marzen by its aroma and flavor. profile."
"Big malt monster of a beer. No hop flavour, but just enough bittering hops to keep this from becoming cloyingly sweet. Medium body, moderate carbonation. A bit strong in the ABV department, but still a nice sipping beer for the winter season."
"Rather drinkable. It's good... not epic or memorable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The ingredients expressed themselves for a fine seasonal and drinkable beverage."
"D- Not too bad at all."
"Overall a very drinkable solid winter seasonal."
"Poured a reddish brown into my goblet with a finger-width sandy, bubbly head which quickly disappeared and reappeared briefly after a bit of agitation. I think the lack of head may be more because of a flaw with the pour or my glass. Aroma is malty, a little spicy despite the change in recipe, with raisin and caramel. Mouthfeel is light and slick, with some sandpapery carbonation action which was surprising based on the completely inactive appearance of the beer. Taste is nuts, caramel, toffee, dry wood, very malty and with a little hop presence, with a very dry finish. Drinkability is good due to the inoffensive nature of the brew. This is my first Scotch ale. Overall this is a solid brew."
"Brooklyn's Winter Ale is a winner. There's not a great deal to complain about here. It's not quite on the level of Black Chocolate Stout as far as their winter arsenal goes. But, it's impressive all the same. I think a little more of a hop presence would slightly improve it. But, I can't complain too much. I'm too busy being impressed. Recommended."
"This is a drinkable scottish ale and a nice winter brew."
"Clear amber with a creamy tan head that leaves minimal lacing. Smells kind of smoky, malty chocolate and coffee. Tastes fairly sweet, caramel and chocolate but with a coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and mildly carbonated. Very drinkable and tasty mild scotch ale."
"Drinkability: for a winter style beer it was very very light and easy drinking. For such a light colored winter beer, it packed a decent amount of flavor and complexities. It can catch up with you if your not careful, but its a good beer to get drunk with while enjoying a nice ale."
"Deep reddish tint to this one. Substantial head leads to faint lacing. Nose is somewhat toasty and hints at the malty sweetness to come. A good roasty, peaty hit followed by mild bitterness. Could use just a little more body and a slight drop in the sweets."
"D - Solid and enjoyable, but not what I expect from a Scottish Ale... This almost strikes me as more of a Winter Warmer..."
"D: Drinkable and easy to drink... with more flavors than the Bell's Christmas Ale, but they are still muted flavors that don't stick out."
"D: Overall, this is an OK beer, but it didn't do that much for me."
"A carefully-crafted beer with a fantastic malt profile. One of the more memorable winter beers I've ever tasted. Will definitely seek it out again."
"Overall: This is very different than most winter brews, though outstanding nevertheless. This beer is very mild in every aspect, yet tasty and very satisfying. Its exceptional smoothness makes this a very easy drinking beer that can easily be enjoyed on a cold winter's night by any beer drinker who prefers maltier beers. I highly recommend this beer."
"Great, easy drinking winter ale. A standard."
"D - Goes down well. Not bad at all."
"(rated Mar 5, 2007)"
"This was fine with my meal, but not particularly memorable either way."
"D - This isn't a bad beer, but it certainly isn't a great Scottish ale. Instead it tastes like some sort of strange hybrid between a weak Scottish ale and a quasi-Belgian style ale, failing in both respects. A strange beer that's either entirely off base or obscenely mediocre. Either way, not something I would have again."
"Pours a deep red copper, has a balanced malty aroma. Mouth feel is slightly heavy with syrup like texture, much like other Scottish Ales. The taste is malt all the way through with a hop undertone that gives it balance. It reminds me of the Wee Heavy style. This beer is very enjoyable and I highly recommend it."
"D- christmas beer or not, this is a unique scottish ale regardless, and mr. oliver's decision keep the lid on tradition has left him with a smooth, gentlemanly brew that seems to put itself past other novelty (no matter how superb) offerings. expertise is shown to me by the malt combination, if any are even smoked at all, and the addition of oats. this would be a tremendous pair with any red meat. hats off and merry xmas."
"Quite dry but there is a notable alcohol warmth. Very creamy with a low level of carbonation. Nice but minor hop at the swallow. Overall, this is a very full bodied malty ale with a lot of vanilla."
"Pours a clear amber brown color with an average tan head that settles into sparse cap. The aroma is of lemon, tea, and perhaps a touch of brown sugar. The taste is of a metallic lemony malt, quite astringent, some caramel/buttery notes and a slight earthness in the end. The Winter Ale has a nice chewy malty body which is quickly cut by a lemony astringent characteristic. The tartness of this brew kills it for me. I feel it takes away from what should be a nice malty brew. This one just doesn't do it for me."
"D: I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. 4 or 5 would be my limit for the night unless the others got lonely. Overall a really damn good beer."
"On tap at Bone Dry and served in a shaker. This beer poured a copper brown hue with a lasting head of creamy, beige foam. Decent lacing. The aroma was made up of lightly sweet caramel, bread crust, and brown sugar. The flavor mirrored the aroma. Nice and malty, but not too robust. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had moderate carbonation. Not too shaby, but I wouldn't mind seeing this one beefed up a bit."
"D: A really nice Scottish Ale, easy to drink and warming all at the same time."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and rolling in the mouth, letting the ingredients express themselves fully. A great seasonal that I look forward to trying again with a nice soup or stew."
"Quite a different beer in its younger incarnation, with a distinctly different character that is, in a way, a bit more Scottish in character with its thick, peaty malt character. A great representation of the style."
"Overall: I had low expectations for this Winter Ale since it claims to not be spiced. I was pleasantly surprised, however, and would definitely recommend this to whoever can find it."
"Ah Brooklyn.. you never let me down. Every beer they make is just so damn solid and tasty.. this one is no exception. The appearance is great (my sister even pointed it out and she knows nothing about beer) with the nice red color and tons of lacing. The taste is not overkill like some scottish ales, not tons of smokiness here. Just a nice malty taste with a touch of ethanol. Great, easy finish makes for a nice smooth drink. Thumbs up."
"This Scottish ale is dark reddish brown with a beautifully frothy tan headd. It smells of sweet malts (LOTS of malts!) with and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is dominated by yummy toasted malts, a light brown sugar sweetness, and a small amount of hops whose profile I can only describe as dead-grass or fallen leaves. This beer has an almost woodlike quality about it. It has an exceptionally smooth medium body that is finely carbonated. This might be my favorite seasonal this year -- it's such a pleasure to drink! Props to Brooklyn for another well-crafted brew!"
"I will drink this over other winter brews, but I try to avoid winter brews overall."
"M + D: A little sharp on the tongue - carbonation is kinda overenthusiastic. Almost leaves a little tingle on the finish. Not a bad beer at all, outside of that little biting sensation."
"06 Edition Winter Ale - 6.0% ABV. This is a pretty standard ale nice to drink, but lacking in the bells and whistles department. Generously sweet malty scent some light pepper is there. Nice color but the off white head soon left and couldn't be brought back. Medium fullness and easily drinkable, nice clean finish. Good tasting ale, sweet malts, slight and I do mean slight bitter hop presence. Nothing out of the ordinary, think I'll stick to their imperial stout."
"This beer pours a deep amber color with a big head rising above it that did leave some lacing. The appearance itself indicates winter. Malt and an inviting freshly baked bread aroma dominate the nose with a sweet caramel and nutty butter linger behind the scenes. On the palate the beer is soft and smooth, almost coating the palate. Light for a winter ale, but not too light. The tastes backup the aroma with bready malt and round rich caramel. The beer finishes with needed and well executed balance provided by the hops in the form of both spice and bitterness. The exit of the beer leaves behind a comforting warm feeling like a warm blanket on a chilly night. The Scottish influence is noticeable in the malt. Definitely another strong brew from Brooklyn Brewery."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this with some fresh white fish with spinach and tomatoes and this was one a perfect go along. Good for holiday meals yet daring enough to drink all night and keep your attention. A stand up beer for Brooklyn right below the Chocoalte Stout."
"D: This one tastes good, but it doesn't have much to make it stand out from the crowd. It seems solid but unspectacular, much like the other Brooklyn offerings I've tried so far."
"drinkability: for a 6% beer this is very drinkable easily could put down 7 or 8 of these in a sitting ...this beer is worth a try"
"Drinkability: I thought I'd tried this before, but I was wrong. That said, I'm glad I did, and it's enjoyable, but there are better, more flavorful winter brews out there. One of the Brooklyn brews I'll leave for others to try, especially with the Black Chocolate Stout always around this time of year."
"Drinkability: Certainly recommended. Yet another quality brew that's both tasty and easily drinkable from Brooklyn Brewery."
"The taste has a similar malty base with a bitter center but the two flavors seem to be fighting more than melding together. There also are some yeast and metal notes that don't quite ring true for me. I don't get any smoke, or spice, or any the typical Scottish qualities. I think I like the winter warmer version better. Not for me, thanks."
"Pours a clear orange/ dark brown color with a decent off white head that slowly fades. Smells of very sweet malts. Taste of dark sweet malts, maybe some dark fruit in there. Not a complete scotish ale, lacks the full taste and mouthfeel. It comes across and little weak at the end. Great drinkability though, I liked this beer a lot it was tough to decifer."
"Overall this beer is worth a shot, but it's only slightly above average."
"D - Food friendly and more than drinkable."
"Warms the throat, smooth with a medium effervescence, a smooth finish. Malty, spicy/orange aftertaste. good stuff, nice at room temp."
"The drink is soft, lightly-carbonated and fullish in body, keeping the drinkability pretty low for me."
"2007 edition, thanks to crushinator. Te aroma is consistent with the Scottish style, malty and peaty. It drinks very smooth, even creamy above average mouthfeel. There is lots of lace. It is very drinkable for the style, which is a swallow at a time."
"This beauty is a creamy brown color with a very solid off-white head and the lacing is also very solid. The aroma is grassy hops and mild caramel. It has a nice mellow caramel flavor with herbal hop bitterness. It has a bit of Dr. Pepper flavor which I really like, Moxie almost. A very smooth mid-body ale. There's a bit of chocolate hint and plenty of toffee. Very flavorful but minimal alcohol so it is plenty drinkable. Very pleasant."
" I had one at about 5am and it was like having some chocolate malt before bed. Good Filling."
"this barley, hops, yeast, and water mixture poured up nice generic brown color. little carbonated head that died real quick. not much aroma. just some subtle malts. some smoked peat would have been nice. taste is kinda boring. just lots of deep malts without a very full body. not very apparent hop character. typical. i feel the dark cherries and figs trying to come out to play but the heavy malts wont let them. Definately English style malts. medium bodied. low carbo. im not a big scottish ale fan but this is no Traquair for sure."
"Drinkability is great. A great cool weather companion day or night. More please."
"Well then, for a winter warmer this one sure has a firm handshake. As for being a Scottish ale, it is still big on the malt without being cloyingly sweet, very palatable. Still, I'm good after one of these, more than full and satiated."
"Pours a mostly clear copper brown, nice thick light tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring around the glass, no real lacing. Smell is very crisp and malty, earth, bread, caramel, some spicy alcohol, touch of milk chocolate, some citrus, floral, not bad. Taste is light, very fruity, strawberries, bread, light caramel, some spiciness, sweet brown sugar and floral finish, bit of alcohol, some iron, very caramelized finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, a bit warm, but easy to drink."
"Turns out this is a decent Scottish ale which is ok since a Winter beer can really be anything as long as it is hearty. Tastes a little like our local Nelson Faceplant. The beer is mid brown with not much of a nose. The flavour is quite malty but the beer is very balanced( a Garret quality). A very pleasant drinking beer for these still cold evenings."
"This would be a nice beer to sit back and relax with while watching a football game. It is a little malty but it is smooth and if you like smokey flavorings this a good one."
"D: another great from Brooklyn. This hefty brew makes for a very enjoyable winter drinking experience - perfect after a long day of homework :-). While it is pretty heavy, it's still a pleasure to drink and I'm pretty sure I could down a couple of these, especially since it's ABV isn't too high. I look forward to my next one."
"Poured a deep amber with a sturdy fine-grained head. Rich nutty aroma, with caramel and butterscotch notes. A very warming, inviting aroma. Tastes like it smells, deep, rounded, satisfying. A really fine beer, balanced and solid. Something to warm you on a winter night."
"Drinkability is nice, a good seasonal ale. Not particularly my style, but decent for what it tries to be. I don't regret buying it, but I don't know if I'd buy it again."
"12oz bottle purchased from Clarendon Wines in Boston. Pours a medium-dark copper with a bit of head. Decent malty aroma. Initial taste is of malts, but then leads to a slightly tangy bitterness to round things out. I was worried that this was going to be another all-malt-and-only-malt ""winter beer"" experience, and was happy that this offered a bit more."
"Nothing bad about this beer, but it just didn't wow me. I don't regret the six pack, but I doubt I'd buy it again."
"I tasted it before I read the summary of it that stated there was no spice added. I swore there was cinnamon or something added to this."
"One of the best versions of the style I've ever had, many craft breweries try this style and fail but this one succeeds with flying colors. Malty beers aren't really my style but this is an incredible success. Way to go."
"I could drink several of these beers."
"D-good, I could have a few."
"This ale has a good drinkability. I could drink a few more of these."
"D - very easy drinking beer."
"Tastes of roasted malts, sour fruits, spices (I know they don't put any in) and caramel."
"This beer is okay, but I wouldn't consider it a outstanding example of a Scottish Ale. It's drinkable, but if you're looking for a Scottish Ale you should pass on this one. Not Recommended."
"Note : This beer's profile improved noticably as the beer warmed. Probbaly would be at its best at cellar temperature, or even a bit above."
"Deep coppery amber body with a firm, dense pad of beige head. Sweetish, caramelly malt aromas blend with faint vanilla, and a hint of peat malt. Toasted, nutty malts up front. Big caramel and sugar cookie sweetness follow, with bits of milk chocolate, vanilla, and whiskey. Mild herbal bitterness in the finish. Medium-bodied with a very creamy feel, especially in the finish. Nice."
"D - This seasonal is good but not great its worth a try if you get the chance but there are better winter beers out"
"Very interesting for a scotch ale. In fact it tastes like a combination of a winter warmer and a scotch ale."
"Overall- Tone down the carbonation a bit and you have a winner."
"The flavor is a nice flowery spice accompanied by caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very easily drinkable. Excellent beer from Brooklyn."
"Pours a clear lighter ruby with no head. Nose is a bit syrupy sweet with some malty character there as well. Flavor is earthy. I think that is the top classification here. Beyond just saying ""earthy", it also has a slight sweet edge and a caramel tone to it as well. Feel is good for the style. Slightly thick and syrupy with little carbonation coating the tongue. This is a fairly drinkable brew. I won't go so far as to say it is the best interpretation of the style, but it is still fairly good."
"D - Okay. The slight sour characteristic and dry nuttiness aren't particularly satisfying, leaving me looking for a little more depth. A pretty good Scottish Ale with a great winter appeal."
"Poured a nice deep mahogony/garnet. Smells of roasted malt and I think I detected Belgian yeast (is this the Belgian aromatic malt? my palate/nose is not usually sensitive enough to catch something like this). Taste is spot on for the style and is almost perfect, sweet, then a bit of earthiness and a dry slightly bitter finish. This otherwise very nice beer fails in the mouthfeel and carbonation for me. My favorite Scottish ales have a sort of thick/luxurious (but not RIP thick of course) mouthfeel without a soda type fizziness. This is a winner on all other counts for me."
"Aroma is malty malt, brown sugar, a little caramel. The flavor is all about the malt, but there is a good subtle balance of bitterness, just enough to counter the caramel roasted maltiness, strong hop flavors don't really come into play. Therefore the effect is not at all a sweet beer, but a mild, soft comforting brew. Well made and quite drinkable."
"Pours a ruby-red dark color from a 12oz bottle with minimal or no head... definitely a reddish-tint towards it... the smell is sweet, with a cognac aftersmell full of cinnamon sweetness... taste is sugarey and sweet, slightly malty with a lingering aftertaste... not bitter at all, the sweetness shines through this drink... definitely pleasing and goes down very easily like candy... mouthfeel is likewise good and the drinkability is up there, just a little sweet, but with a nice alcohol glow... great selection for a winter warmer - candied and sweet and very palate-pleasing... definitely recommended while supplies last..."
"Poured into the Sam Adams pint glass. Deep red hues swirl within the copper liquid, a 1 finger head tops it off. Decent lacing. Smells of caramel and plums. Taste is slightly sweet. Some brown sugar and caramel. A little hop aftertaste, but very faint. Decent carbonation. Good brew, could have used some extra spices, but overall easy to drink."
"Drinkability - This was one of my first Brooklyn's and definetly my first Scottish Ale and a good experiece all around. Don't let the poor ratings fool you, this was a quality brew. Definetly looking forward to more Scottish and Brooklyn Ales in the near future."
"Out of a 12 oz. bottle... pours a clear copper with a thin, white head. Good retention. Light aromas of maple syrup, nuts, toasted malts, some caramel or toffee. Not a lot of spice in this one. Tastes much of the same - mainly a nutty character. No real bitterness to it. Light-to-medium mouthfeel. This beer is labeled as a winter beer, but it really is like a decent Scottish Ale. Overall, very easily drinkable. Some complexity to the aromas, but nothing mind-blowing about the taste."
"Brooklyn will most likely never disappoint, and the winter lager is a very nice addition to the holiday schedule. Will most likely get again, and recommend it to others."
"Overall: *Very* good, but I thought it could be better on the finish -- it just seems to drop off without saying goodbye, although it does pleasantly warm the throat. At 6%, it is slightly reminiscent of a weak barleywine with a Scots twist. It really was great with food -- what Sara and I had was caramel popcorn with nuts, and also pecan pie. I imagine it would be stellar with hearty winter foods -- savory stews, rich roast with gravy, a baked ham, or anything that has caramelized onions featured."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a thick head that fades to a one-finger head. Aroma is strong and malty with peat and smokiness showing through. A bit fruity as well. Taste is nice and smoky upfront and it seems to hold, carrying to the aftertaste as well. A second sip detects the hops underneath and some fruitiness/bitterness. Tastes like a scottish ale for sure. No need for spices in this winter ale."
"By far the worst offering from Brooklyn I have had. Seems like a there is a disparity in the reviews - perhaps there are some bad batches floating around. Wouldn't try again - there are better Scottish Ales out there, and way better offerings from Brooklyn."
"During a short trip back to the USA, I tried this beer on-tap with dinner. It's a reddish brown color with a translucent amber hue. The head was thick, frothy, and relatively long-lasting. The aroma has a notable bread, grain, and caramel aroma. This is a moderately sweet beer, with little wood and charcoal in the background. Nice malt presence. It hides it's 6% very well. There's very little hops in the flavor. Instead, the grain provides a bit of balance. Medium to full in body. This is a polite winter beer. Nothing to complain about, but it's not quite inspiring either."
"Quite drinkable, but nothing really sticks out about the offering as a winter offering (no spices). The biscuity notes, which I was told come from a traditional Scottish malts is mild, but present."
"Overall a very good winter ale and one that should be tried."
"Overall a nice winter warmer."
"Drinkability: This beer is so well balanced, it is easy and enjoyable to drink. You can find lots to love in it, and even the uninitiated should be able to handle it. I drank this one with a gingerbread man, and that was just an awesome combination. I can't wait to have one with a hearty main course, as recommended on Brooklyn's web site."
"Poured a crisp dark amber with a thin head that quickly diminished to a ring. Aroma was some dark malts and burnt caramel. The taste is a bland mess of malts with not much going for it. The beer is light bodied, but over-carbonated. This is a very unremarkable beer."
"not a bad beer, but definately no where near my favorite brooklyn offering, probobly won't be picking this up too often"
"Easy enough to drink, but uninspiring and not too much of a Scottish (other than some maltiness/earthiness - but not much of the peat smokiness characteristic of the style). Not much of a winter ale, either. For a real winter treat from this brewery, try the Monster Ale - or better yet, the Black Chocolate Stout."
"PS - As I've drunk this beer and it's warmed, it's gotten better (smell & taste wise), but that still doesn't change my opinion posted above."
"A decent enough beer, but probably not something I will want to try again any time soon. It's just a bit too sweet and malty for my taste."
"D-This will be a staple in my refrigerator this winter. Very nicely done. This was the beer in my chili that is slowly cooking, it's sweetness should be good with the bitterness of the peppers."
"Drinakability: Moderate, could have more flavor, more subdued that I was expecting."
"Overall, I'd have to say that this is Brooklyn's worst beer by FAR. Normally I enjoy the brews from the genius that is Garret Oliver. That being said, I just can't get behind this one. Perhaps this is just another beer that is used to ""pay the bills"" and not wow us beer geeks. Either way, I'll just skip this one next time, and stick with black chocolate stout, as well as wait for Monster to show up...."
"M/D: Mouthfeel is a lot lighter than I expected, a litte watery. Suprising little carbonation under such an awesome head, drinkability is pretty good as this one goes down smooth."
"I converted at least a half dozen friends to this brew last year, so I consider it to be pretty versatile for a ""heavier"" beer. Definitely beats out everything else in the winter-seasonal mid-price wide-distribution craft brew category. Sam A's, Harpoon, Long Trail, and Sierra Nevada are just a few of many examples that falter in this category. Brooklyn, as usual, stands mightily in front of the 6-pack beer bunch."
"It seems a little watered down but it's a pretty accessible Scottish Ale that I would recommend to friends."
"Pours a four-finger light brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Malty nose. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Flavor is malty slight bitterness at finish. This is the '07 version and it lacks the spices but doesn't have the smoothness of a scotch ale. Best before Apr 2008, 12oz bottle $1.50 from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"Nice clear brown with a thin white head. Malty sweet aroma, a little cereal like, with a little bit of smoke. Nice sweet flavor, a little more smokiness than in the aroma. Caramel stands out the most with a little creaminess to go with it. Nice mouthfeel - a little heavy but not too sticky. Very drinkable, nice to enjoy on a relaxing evening."
"Drinkability: Even though this bottle was over 8 months old... it still tasted fresh with nothing objectionable. I could see me trying this again only fresh and in season."
"Short one finger fuzzy tan head sits atop a extremely dark brown carmel colored body. Nose indicates a syrupy sweet malt base with a almost German style wheat smell. The taste screams scotch ale as you take first sip, dark fruit, raw wheat, and a vegetable like tone that I cant quite place. Overall the palate lacks the richness and balance that I like in some scotch styles. Dont get me wrong it is drinkable and not bad. Sharp sour twang to the mouthfeel. Different for a winter ale."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitter of hay and grass, with a slick, somewhat pungent finish. Hmmm. Looking forward to another bottle of this, so I can update this sub-par review."
"drinkability - Nice sipper beer, not your normal winter brew. A keeper"
"D - This is a huge improvement over the previous version of the Brooklyn Winter Ale. Very drinkable and a solid example of the style. Recommended for any fall or winter occasion!"
"Call this Xmas in July. Nice coppery color. Doesnt stand out as much as the original review I did. Decent caramel and slight hop aroma-quite bready. Solid malt flavor up front.. Nice caramely flavor as well as toasted malt. Very nice body. Drinkable in a bad way. While this bottle is 7 months old it still retains its bready and caramel flavor that made it so attractive the first go round. Hope this shows up again in 2008-would make a great year round release."
"($6.49 / 6-pack with $2 discount)"
"It's well-brewed and the alcohol never really steps onto the palate, although you can sense it's there. There's enough character to keep it interesting, and although it does build a little on the palate it's not sweet. Worth trying."
"Pours out darker than I expected, amber in color with some head. No floaties. The aroma is mostly malty, with some hints of pine. Satisfying. It tastes of caramel, some slightly fruity hints, and finishes with some clean hop bitterness that lingers for quite a while. Pretty good. It's soft in the mouth, although a little watery. Went down relatively easy. Overall, nothing spectacular here, but far from offensive. I could see myself having more in the future."
"Unusual for a Winter Warmer but definitely appreciated."
"Caramel malts and toasted grains make up the malt profile. A bit thin at first on the palate a first with a slickness that coats the roof of the mouth and tongue. Smooth and subtle but not creamy as most scotch ales are. Grassy hop flavors with a hint of floral hop notes. Dryness at the back of the tongue near the taste buds. Bitterness creeps in slowly. A bit of toastyness also detected at the tip of the tongue. A pretty drinkable scotch ale, although I wish it the mouthfeel was a bit more creamy."
"Tastes good. I'm proud this is made nearby. Vanilla and prune, malty and a little sourness to cut the sweets. Tingles the tongue and delights. A nice sipper. Probably max out at two."
"A good beer to be had. Easy drinking, not as strong as some winter seasonals. Worth a try!!"
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a medium brown color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of light roasted malt with some subtle semi-sweet caramel malt. Taste is also dominated by the mix between light roasted malt and caramel malt. Body is thinner then I would have expected and no hops presence could be detected. I thought this one was definitely lacking character and end up being quite boring."
"Medium full body, medium to low carbonation lets this go down easy. A touch of astringence, but drinkability is high. If only it tasted better!"
"d - good brew. i'm not very familiar with scottish ales and maybe if i was i could appreciate this one more. off to hunt..."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, it's an excellent sipper but I could put away a few of them. This was one of those beers that I had at the totally right time, late night, clod & snowy, the wife had fallen asleep and I was watching TV. Putting the ""right beer at the right time"" situation aside, I can objectively say that this was a very good beer and one of the best that I've had in the style."
"Cheers!"
"Brooklyn does it again. Not as awesome as thier Chocolate Stout, but wow. I'll buy this one again."
"Drinkability: An English take on a Scottish Ale, me thinks; not one I would return to in a hurry"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a low carbonation, giving this a rather smooth feel to it. Drinkability is good if you can handle your beers on the sweet side. For me, I would only be able to have one at a time due to the sweetness."
" Even though a lot of the Brooklyn beers tend to have a somewhat similar taste, this one quietly stands out as being different from those, but just as enjoyable, nevertheless. Garrett's got another winner here, hands down. Between this and the Ramstein Winter Wheat, those of us in this neck of the woods are blessed to have a beer like this help out with the long nights, icy weather, and quiet desperation that sets in with the season. This is a great fit for this time of the year!"
"This Winter Ale is a wonderful departure from the overspiced, overalcoholic monstrosities many brewers churn out come winter time. Its beauty lies in its simplicity. Highly reccomended."
"Nice time for a Winter Ale here in Buffalo. South of the city,some areas have been hit with 100 inches of snow in the past two weeks! I'm north of the city,where we have about 6 or so. 55 degrees on Christmas,and now this?? This beer pours a deep rich copper, thin head,and nice lacing. Smell is not strong,but is sweet like honey. Body is on the thin side with some carbionation. Taste is bread abd butter,with honey and molasses. Scottish Ale is not my favorite style, but this is good for a domestic."
"Brooklyn Winter Ale is one of the best domestic Scottish ales in recent memory and is one of the best beers from this brewery that I can remember drinking. I wish now that I had grabbed a sixer rather than a single because I'd like nothing better than to crack open a second bottle right this instant."
"All-in-all this one is a winner. A very drinkable winter offering that does not over power with alcoholic warmth or syrupy sweetness but rather delivers just tastes of each in manageable quantities to make drinking a few over the course of a cold night not a problem. Another very enjoyable offering from Brooklyn."
"Don't drink and review."
"Props to Brooklyn Brewing for doing something a little different for a winter ale and I think it really payed off. A pretty fine brew all in all."
"Solid warming ale for the winter months."
"Had this on tap at Rowdy's in East Hampton. Poured a deep amber color with a fluffy and coarse off-white head. Head faded down but left nice lacing. Solid malty aromas with a nutty background. Big malt flavors with caramel, some smokiness, mild spice, and a warm alcohol sensation in the finish. Only gets better as the liquid warms. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, surprisingly, but didn't affect my overall impression of the beer much. Dangerously drinkable. Overall a wonderful beer to enjoy after a blistering cold day such as this."
"Pours a dark ruby amber with a full finger orange-tan head that fades slowly. Clear with an effervescence that is keeping the head alive. Not a lot of lacing. A smoked citrus zest smell. Quite a bit of tingly carbonation and a taste reminds me of an English Bitter only slightly smoked. It tastes similar to the 2005 variety only toned down an order of magnitude. I can't finish it."
"Dark amber poor and beige head of various sized bubbles. Aromas of malts, something sulfur like, and some boozy wine like esters. The flavors are all rather mild but nutty, smokey malts and roasted grains make up the majority. Other notes are figs, wheat bread, some sour dark fruits, mild oaky bourbon barrel, and some faint chocolate found way in the back. Really nice velvety mouthfeel and a touch of carbonated crispness. Some alcohol strength is detectable but not detracting and some lemon and buttery notes become apparent as it warms. This beer has a slew of nuances that seem like theyve been mellowed like its been aged for a while."
"No lacing on the glass. Overall, this is interesting. Okay as a winter ale, okay as a scottish ale, moderately well drinkable. But if this is on sale, there's a good chance it's sitting right next to Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout and Monster ale. Pick up the other two first."
"This winter beer poured into a Duvel tulip with a clear brownish body and slight white head. There were touches of toasted coffee in the nose, sweet fresh brewed coffee. The taste was more of the coffee taste and although I don't drink coffee, I like the aroma and taste in my beer. The coffee taste was also mixed well with a caramel character. Despite the these big complex tastes, the beer was very easy to drink, probably due to the relatively mild abv. This beer had a nice creamy body that I think I could drink more than a few in a sitting."
"Prost!"
"I enjoyed this one overall. Solid all around and no real complaints. A nice winter seasonal from Brooklyn."
"12 oz. bottle - pours a copper/garnet with medium carbonation and a fleeting head that manages to work up a collar of bubbles. It smells quite rich, with notes of caramel, chocolate, earth, molasses, leather? and a kicker of buttery diacetyl. Quite aromatic and very pleasing. The flavor retains all of these and adds a light dose of green hops on top of a medium body that has equal carbonation and finish. Overall a fine malty brew and a good example of a Scottish ale."
"While not coming across as a classic Scottish Ale, it's a nice chane of pace from the usual winter seasonals."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A nice, deep amber color with an ok tan head that receded into a layering. Left decent lacing, but not too much as it was drank. A deep, malty smell. A taste that was very rich with malts and flovor; hint of a smoky element was present in the beer. A nice mouthfeel that was very pleasant. A very drinkable beer made so by the malts that are involved with the style of the beer. Overall, an excellent beer that makes me want to taste more Brooklyn creations."
"Overall: I think this is a very nice malt-forward Scottish ale that manages to be well-balanced and not too sweet."
"Oh man is this good. So easy to drink. I wish I bought more. I poured it from a 12 oz bottle. I gave it a vigorous pour as I saw suggested somewhere. The head was thin, but nice. Deep amber colored and smelled of sweet malts. The taste was just like the smell and it felt great going down. I can't wait to pick up more. Hmmm, maybe tonight. The only negative I can think of was the thin head, but that's minor and did not affect the beer too much."
"Drinkability is very good. This is a delicious beer with a depth of flavor that is still easy to enjoy. An excellent winter beer to serve to friends."
"Pours a nice caramel, yet with a minimal head. Smell is definitely malty and smoky, with a hint of vanilla. Taste is smoky, with a strong malt backbone, light alcohol hints...definitely a Scotch Ale. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy and full-bodoed. Very easy on the drinkability scale, with a smooth quality that is rich in a refreshing way."
"Pours into the glass calmly, not much carbonation. In order to kick the head, the pour needs to be vigorous and down the middle of the beer. A medium caramel colored head appears with smallish bubbles indicating a strong ale. The head falls apart and disappears within two mintues. Swirling the glass brings the head back up. The look of the ale indicates good weight, small bubbles rise slowly and create the head. The ale is a beautiful amber color, very clear with no cloudy notes. The bouquet is mostly hop dominated: some musty wet dog notes, wet stone/concrete and in the background is subtlely sweet caramel malt aromas. In the mouth, the ale is a medium weight ale with great balance between sweet malty notes and bittering hops. Theres not much complexity but the nice hop finish make this a good drink. This is a winter beer that you can have perhaps more than one."
"This is a damn good brew. Scottish ale? I don't know about that. Tastes more like a winter ale or lager. Decent head and lacing, with some toffee undertones. Chocolatey malts shine through with a little hoppiness at the end, not much. There is some marachino cherry in there somewhere. Can drink many of these and I wish I had one more."
"Pours a beautiful, deep chestnut color. The heavy roast of the palate is complemented by a nice dryness, along with delicious notes of toasted toffee, some nuttiness and caramel malt. Roasted grain dominates the finish. One of the better winter warmers Ive tried this season; its dry and fairly subdued (unlike so many of the sickly sweet and over-spiced seasonals out there these days) and features some very tasty roasted, grainy flavors. Recommended."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the taste."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle, BB April '07. Poured a fairly clear, bright amber/red with little head which dissipated quickly to leave a slight amount of lacing. Strong malty smell, can't pick up much else. Taste is a slight sweetness, some smoky malt, with a slight spicy hoppiness in the back of my throat. Aftertaste is sweet. Good even amount of carbonation. Very very smooth mouthfeel, but somewhat average. However, I could drink a couple of these, the flavors balance out very nicely and its very smooth."
"12 ounce bottle."
"This is a good beer, especially if you want a winter warmer thats not very spicy. I like the spicy beers also, but this is a nice change."
"On tap at the Hop Devil in NYC, this recent Bklyn offering poured pretty typical darkish amber, tan head, with decent retentive powers showing. Lacing is stringy and splotchy. Malty, slightly smoked nose. Straight forward Scottish style ale, smooth malts, slight smoke, background fruit and sugars. Nice creation, easy drinking wintry brew, well worth a try."
"Da: One of my favorite ""winter"" brews for the year of '06."
"Beer was poured into a tumbler at 50 degrees. Beer was dark and had a mildly thick head that went away fast. Smell had all kind of different interesting notes. Some like Christmas tree, some other exotic spices I could not get a grip on. Interesting beer, but to complex for me. Will not buy again."
"Overall an easy drinking Scottish Ale. Very nice malts."
"Pours a clear amber/copper in color with a minimal khaki colored head and some lacing. Smell is of malts with a hint of floral hops. Also somewhat earthy. Taste is dominated by malts. Floral hops make there presence known at the finish along with a hint of spices. Medium body and low/moderate carbonation. Good drinkability, a very enjoyable winter beer."
"Pours a clear and dark reddish-amber with a tan head. Tiny layer of foam remains through the whole glass. Decent lacing. Smell of sweet, caramel toasted malt. Taste is not sweet at all. The Maris Otter malts give a nice biscuity taste. Minimal taste of hops, but they are there to balance things out nicely. Medium-bodied for this 6% beer. Very easy to drink. Good example of a scottish ale."
"I was able to have this brew on tap the other day. It was poured to a dark amber color with a smallish head but did have some retention and left a little lacing. The aromas seemed to have a somewhat odd fruit scent that was very noticeable needless to say I had a very hard time pin pointing it. Unfortunately this was the most noticeable scent to hit my nose and the folks with me also seemed to have a hard time getting by it. The taste was ok, not my favorite seasonal that I have had but overall it was a nice drink. Was a brew that I would not throw back quickly, more of a slow sipper. I was able to pick up some of the odd fruit (think it is fruit) taste that I noticed in the nose along with a solid malt taste. Over all I guess this brew was not what I was expecting, was it good, yeah but some of the flavors just seemed a little odd, could it have been the keg?"
"Pours clear and dark, with different shades of browns, mahoganies, and caramels visible from different angles. Minimal off-white head that fades to a collar pretty quickly. Smells of caramel malt and a touch of pungent fruits, but the nose is pretty slight, even for the style. On the palate, very smooth malts, slick even, play well with a small amount of balancing bittering hops. Slight English ale sourness on the finish. Very smooth in mouthfeel, with only minimal carbonation. Overall, a good Scotch ale, especially for the price."
"Pours a clear mahogony with a smallish head that quickly disappears. The smell is alittle light with Christmas spices,cinnamon, nutmeg,brown sugar, along with sweet malt, and dark fruit. The taste is sweet malt, pine hops, and the above mentioned Christmas spices. The spices are more sublte in this compared to other Winters. The m/f is light with all flavors mixing well. A damn good winter, my only complaint is that this needs more of an alcohol kick."
"Always beleived that the Scottish Ales were the best Winer beers. They are full of character, sweeter, heavier, maltier, more emphasis on dark fruits, spicier, earthier, and a little 'dirty'. This beer fits to the tee. Smells very malty with a light raison / date aroma, with an earthy, pine-ey scent. Tastes also very malty sweet with complexities of fruitcake and pine to spice it up a little. Finishes with a mild 'campfire' smokiness and earthiness along with the established pine-hop flavors. A really nice beer for those cold days ahead."
"6.0 % ABV, Best before April 07. Dark amber clear liquid. Thin off white head disappears very quickly. Big malty, earthy aroma, right on target for a Scottish Ale. Deep caramel malty backbone, a bit of sweetness at the front end. Malt is balanced well by some earthy flavors, and a bit of nuttyness. Dry in the finish. Medium body, with appropriate carbonation. Very drinkable, especially at 6%. Pretty nice, worth a try."
"They say on the bottle that this isbig enough to pair with the roast meats and rich dishes of the holiday season. I agree, but it is drinkable enough to have a few without anything at all, except company."
"Yummy winter beer. The spicing is just right and not overdone."
"A very good winter beer. I enjoyed it. Mouthfeel and probably overall would have scored higher if it was just a bit less carbonated."
"Deep chocolate color with red pigments running throughout, almost opaque. Smells roasted, toasted, chocolatey and coffee-y. Bitter but not very. Some sweet maltyness, and a bit of a fruity odor. Taste is sweet without being cloyingly so. A slightly burnt coffee flavor that balances well with the sweetness. A big punch of breadyness and biscuityness hits you near the end. Mouthfeel is chewy and smooth without being too thick. Overall a nice winter warmer, balanced and tasty and not too heavy."
"A decent winter brew, but just a bit too spiced for my taste. By the time I finished the bottle, I was looking for something else."
"In a sea of over-spiced Winter Warmer, Brooklyn has produced a well balanced, domestic version of the style. Not a great beer, but stylistically on the money."
"Spare head, after you've poured it, it degenerates to just a pale tan around the rim of the glass, and very little lacing. Body is a cheery cherry brown. Aroma is dubbel-like, faintly like raisins, slightly sweet and dusty. Malty in taste, not quite chewy, with a hint of cinnamon and hops. I would not want two back to back, but I find myself liking the faintly metallic aftertaste, the spice, the way that it slowly warms, and changes as it warms. I like a beer that challenges me, that won't be immediately appealing. This would be a great beer with turkey and other holiday flavors. A good introduction to the style."
"The taste was what I expected it to be; a standard winter beer. Dark fruits, slight spices, and sweet malts backed up by the bitter alcohol finish. This thing really does pack a punch on the backend. I also found swishing it around for a second or two is not a good idea. The flavors leave as fast as they come, and this one is best sipped right down the gullet. But even at 6% ABV, this beer is pretty sessionable. An enjoyable, if fairly standard, winter ale. Still not quite as good as my current fav, Sam Adams."
"M/D- Medium bodied, moderate carbonation...Overall a decent winter ale....seems like a slightly older more odd brother of their okoberfest. Good, but not outstanding...I don't know if makes me wish that I had tried the slightly stronger abv version of the previous years.."
"On tap at the Buffalo Brewpub,poured a rich amber with a thin but well retained tan colred head,picked up some cherry and deep brown sugar notes in the nose with hints of cinnamon and clove.Quite drinkable for the abv% I have to say lighter dark fruit and brown sugar notes up front with that pear note that a few others have noted not overly sweet just about spot on.A highly quaffable winter ale has nice flavors and is easy going down,recommended."
"It's that time of year again and it's the first time Brooklyn Brewery has brought NC this winter warmer. Very typical to the style, but I prefer Sam Adams my home homebrew a bit better. Hints of coriander, cinnamon, plums? with a bit of hotness to it. A bit of a bitter aftertaste. Not bad, but there's better ones out there in my opinion."
"This is a solid Winter seasonal - not too spiced. This is a good thing."
"For the style this is pretty good stuff; this is pretty good stuff on the whole within the darker, sweeter yet hoppy end of the spectrum."
"Light aroma of cinnamon and malt. Smooth and even mouthfeel with moderate to low carbonation leads to flavors of caramel and toasted malt and understated cocoa, some currant and smoke and a bit of hop bitters riding beneath. Finishes a bit tannic and powdery."
"Overall a solid winter brew from Brooklyn, but was expecting more."
"D- Nice winter wamer. Seems more like a nice scottish ale, but I like it."
"I'm not sure this is the same version othere have tried. Mine was 6% abv, and totally new to my local area as of 11/1/06. Purported to be a Scottish style ale, it is dark mahaogany, smells of authentic Maris Otter malts, but the taste backs down where the aroma steps out. Chewy sweet malt, barely balanced by restrained hops as per the style. A little more yeasty/ fermentation complexity would be appreciated by me if the style is a malt-accented ale. Otherwise a solid attempt at a traditional style beer, which is what I understand Garret Oliver's chief aim is with his beers. He is certainly the chap to give it one of the best tries that any Yank can."
