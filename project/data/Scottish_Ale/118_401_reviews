"Colour: very dark red. Smell: blackcurrants, dried figs, plums, raisins. Taste and mouthfeel: same as smell, hints of dark chocolate, bit watery, and bitter. By acetic blackcurrant smell and taste it reminds me of Porterhouse Oyster Stout and Sam Smith's Taddy Porter. By bitterness it's untypical Scottish Ale. Very original beer. I suppose it would be even better paired with appropriate food. Skull Splitter is better, though."

"Feels rather thin but well carbonated."
"I really liked this one!"

"Pours darker than a typical porter, but slightly more transparent than a stout.  Above average head volume, lacing and retention.  Vey rich complex nose of sweet caramel, hints of dark fruit (plums), pear (as it warms), toffee with light coffee notes and a hint of roast and chocolate.  Very light medium body with just a touch of smoothness.  Average carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is well below average in intensity, complex and well balanced.  It begins rather bland, but comes alive in the middle.  Dark fruits become evident along with the other flavors of the nose except for the caramel - it is totally absent.  The long finish has a hop note.  Perhaps this bottle is old, but since they don't bottle date..."

"An interesting take on a stout that includes nuances typical of a Scotch ale, but darker."
"more like a continental dark bee, not bad just muted"

"08/01/13 From bottle at Rattle n Hum, NYC. At the outset this was too cold to appreciate. Unfortunately, even as it approached ambient temperature the flavor never seemed to arrive. It never got past a stout w/out body. Left me waiting at the station."

"This is an excellent dark ale.  I want to try it on cask."

"Overall: A nice drop, but a little muted in character for me, though on cask I think this would shine. Cheers!"
"O- It's pretty good, basically like a sessionable Scotch ale. Guess I'm just to used to full flavored beers. It's kinda like Skull Splitter light."
"This is a wonderful beer. Very light and soft mouthfeel with a lot of subtle but no overpowering flavors going on. ABV makes this very drinkable. This would be even more phenomenal on cask."

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/6/2011. Pours lightly cloudy nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, toffee, molasses, toast, raisin, plum, pear, apple, dark bread, light roast, herbal, light pepper, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, dark bread, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, pear, light roast, herbal, light pepper, light leather, and toast/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, dark bread, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, pear, light roast, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.6%. Overall this is a damn nice Scottish ale! All around good balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: A full-flavored pint that delivers great complexity and delightfully smooth drinkability. This is just an awesome beer all around. I'm sold on Orkney. These guys can brew some excellent beer."

"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Pours a red-tinted raisin brown colour. Nose offers notes of sweet, dark dried fruit. Taste is remarkably dry, yet quite flavourful with strong porter-like notes of smoke, chocolate and black coffee. Crisp and easy drinking, yet quite complex and flavourful."

"A very drinkable Scottish Ale. I was expecting a heavier body, but once it starts to warm up it reveals more and more amazing fruity flavors."

"Dark Island pours out a lighter black and offers sweet, slightly roasted malts, coffee, and fruit on the nose. The nose is really exceptional. The taste is very good, with fruits and semi-sweet chocolate up front, and smoke lingering on the backend along with some leafy hops and highly roasted coffee. Very well composed, and delicious. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, and the drinkability is great. Overall, Dark Island is an excellent beer."

"Pours a very dark brown with a creamy tan had with good retention and lacing. Moderate aroma of coffee, toast and toffee. Flavor is similar with hints of coffee, bitter chocolate, raisins and toffee/brown sugar sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little thin and finish is slightly astringent. Would this beer to be a little more full-bodied, but the flavor is very good."
""
"Atmosphere is good. Decent hue, but a very slight head and no lacing. Nose is a great malty, sweet cherry and fresh pastry combination. Flabby and a little shallow slightly sweetened malty tone, balanced with a bit of pungent peat. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"500 ml bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch tan head that stayed around for a while. There's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like caramel malt, toffee, dark fruit, roasted malt and a bit of leather and chocolate. It tastes like peat, roasted malt, dark fruit, minerals/salt, chocolate and some coffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, and at $4.99 a bottle I'd buy this one again in the future."

"Overall - A decent enough Scottish ale... worth a try..."

"Overall a fairly simple but tasty beer. Too subtle in both the nose and taste but decent none the less. Being from Scotland I know our beer is pretty different to American made ""Scotch"" ales."

"A pretty solid go-to dark ale. This is really nice and a tasty ale."

"dark fruit aromas, tastes (figs?). settling on the fact that lighter abv has a more genuine flavor- less to contend with when you include a higher abv. it is why i appreciate a truly great taste from the higher abv brews. i mean a slurpee can taste great, but whe you add the vodka to it it diminishes the taste, right? we ARE drinking it for (partially) the alcohol and the craft involved to produce an alcoholic beverage, right? so, the lower abv'd brews naturally have the advantage in taste. this one has a great taste, and a more flavorful malt variety, which is great, but i hesitate when i compare it to higher abv brews. regardless, it still is a great tasting brew. i suppose i feel the need to say this as i have seen many reviews knock the fact that it has an 'alcohol' flavor to it, when that 'flavor' can, actually, be difficult to appreciate. i want to bump up my review numbers as i feel i may have been influenced by others' opinions.... i have always liked this beer...."
"Orkney did a great job overall on his beer. It poured very dark and had a nice tan head. The smell was of molasses, dried fruit and rich malts. Taste was to style with more malt flavor showing through than hop bitterness, but for me was more of a sweet fruit than dark malt. The mouthfeel was light to medium and finished very smooth."

"O: Great flavor, lots of complexity. My only complaint with this beer is that I find it too light to back up the flavor. Worth a try to be sure."
""
""
"I could drink a few of these without getting board, went down quickly and I thought it tasted great, what more can you ask for?"
"500ml bottle. Snifter glass. Notes dated on agt´11. Deep mahogany color crowned by off-white froth showing pretty well retention. Some spots. Yeast, sweet toasted & caramel malt, toffee aromas. Flavors of chocolate, ripe dark berries & hints of toffee. Sweet bitter palate. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Slightly watery in the middle."
"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light. Huge frothy tan head slowly subsides and leaves lots of stickies on the glass on the way down. The aroma is a bit vinous with hints of dark dried fruits. Bits of caramel and chocolate almond with dried cherries and raisins abound. The flavor is as vinous as the aroma suggested. Lots of dark and slightly tart fruit with a hint of butterscotch and light chocolate. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet creamy bubbly mouthfeel. Lots of body and flavor for such a brew with 4.6 abv. I like this."
""
"Overall a pretty remarkable beer."
""
""
""
"A lovely Scottish ale, balanced in all respects, except maybe for (from a New World view) the ABV - ah, hell, even I shouldn't complain - any session ale should be lucky to have such complexity and ardor."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Highly recommended!"
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, I was not expecting it to be quite so dark and to have such a wonderful aroma. I was pleased that it had hints of smoke but that the smoke was not overpowering and let the other flavors show through. Very easy to drink and I would gladly have another (if only there was another bottle here at the house)."

"A dark brown with a brown head and good lacing on the pour. Aroma of sweet lightly roasted dark caramel malt, some nice hints of cacao and espresso, with some nice dark ripe fruity esters. Taste affords us with some nice chocolate notes, some roasted caramel malt along with some nice ripe dark fruits, some plums, with some light bitterness. Palate is a medium slightly creamy texture with some light carbonation. Finishes with a sweet toasted slightly creamy dark caramel malts some cacao, some dark fruity notes and a light bitter ending for some balance. This is a good tasty and flavorful brew. Almost reminds me of a light version of an Imp Stout, very nice, easy drinking brew."

"I'm glad David @ The Brewer's Kettle had a tasteing and more glad that I was able to pick a bottle up. Pretty spot on as far as style goes so this is definately an A brew to me."
""
""
""
"Heavy mouthfeel, but in great condition, with a lovely soft carbonisation, only really found in well kept darker cask ales."
""
"A complex beer for the mature palate."
"Overall I'd probably want it bigger, but for what this offers at this low abv this is quite enjoyable and impressive, really like this quite a lot!"
"Body feels quite watery."

"Overall, I really like this beer. It has great, rich flavors, and is a pleasure to drink on a chilly fall day."
"O - a good example of the style."
"Overall this is an interesting beer, different from many other Scottish ales in it's flavor and low ABV. Not super complex but definitely worth a try. The label says it won the CAMRA Champion beer of Scotland twice on cask; that is something I'd like to try someday."
"Cheers"
"O: The nose was pretty nice, but the flavor was far too thin and watery."
"This beer poured out as a nice shade of reddish brown. The head was white and a little foamy. The lacing was thin and didn't really do too much after mid glass. The smell of the beer had a good amount of malts on the nose, there was a subtle sweetness to the aroma. The taste was earthy, malty, and had some qualities of most English style ales. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty smooth, it was a little light bodied for the color of the brew. Overall I thought that it was a good brew to try. Glad I had it."
"Overall: a decent beer. I'm not likely to go out of my way to have it again, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down."
"O: Not really the flavors I find good in a beer and finishes way too dry for my liking."
"O: Overall I liked this beer. I would drink it again because it's very pleasant, but it just doesn't have that punch it needs to stand out. It's nearly there, right on the cusp of being a great beer. The mouthfeel is probably the biggest drawback to the beer, as it stands out of place. Overall I rated it good though, because it definitely is not average."
"Overall pretty good, light and sessionable, nice darker roasty malts, toasty, soft aged brown malts, brown sugar and molasses, lots of great dark malt flavors in a very light and sessionable beer, great job."
"O: This beer is very sessionable given its' low alcohol content. It packs in so much flavor that I could drink this all night long without losing interest."
"D: Glad I tried this but a little thin for me."
"D: A good beer. Recommended. Easy to drink."
"Pours a very dark brown with almost no head. Appears to be quite a bit too dark for the style. Lacing is non-existent. The nose brings forward some toffee as well as a mild amount of diacetyl. The taste is lightly-toasted with some roasted malt and a bit of sweetness. Underneath there is toffee and butter. Body is light with low carbonation. Not worthy of its position as the #1 Scottish Ale."
"D - no reason not to, but no reason to grab it either."
"I liked this for what it was, but it needs a bit more aggressiveness. A very soft, subtle beer with pleasant flavors."
"The latest effort in my quest to drink the entire Orkney line (or at least what's available in the US). As Scottish ales go, this one is actually a bit thin in the nose, but the taste more than compensates. It's not overpowering, but is a subtle and complex mix of dried fruity things, leather, burlap, rope and a teeny bit of smoke, perhaps? It will require many more bottles to sort it all out. I had this pint with a handful of chocolate-covered espresso beans and, toward the end, a fistful of chocolate jimmies (the cheap, waxy kind from Stop & Shop), neither of which put a dent in the taste of this beer. Another superb brew from our Scottish pals."
"Beer is medium to light in body with a mild smokiness and some malt sweetness up front, overall it is pretty good. The midpalate is a little thin but overall it's a pretty good beer. I should drink more scotch ales."
"The beer is creamy, but also a bit thin, with a low ABV. The beer could improve with a bit more heft, but that being said, there is a very nice caramel, butterscotch, and smoked peat type flavor to the beer. The sweetish dark malts blend nicely with the caramel flavors to create a nice balanced, although thin, Scottish Ale. I had this with salmon and it was a very nice complement. The aftertaste is very mild as is the beer overall. This is worth seeking out."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with a light brown two finger head. Smells of rich sweet malt some toffee and fruitiness in there. It smells wonderful. The taste is pretty good though not up to the standard that the nose set. dark malt, chocolate and some roasty flavors. All flavors are less substantial then the nose as well. Unfortunately there is a metallic taste soon upon first taste. The mouthful is very nice too. Mild carbonation structure makes this beer very smooth and easy drinking. Light/medium body. Overall a good beer, I will revisit to see if it was a condition issue with my bottle."
"This is an odd beer. It is very light bodied, which was not expected. It contains a lot of flavors wrapped up in one beer. The slight sweetness makes this even more different. The flavor complexity makes me want to rate this high, but the texture is what is bringing the overall rating down."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed this beer and could see drinking it over the course of the evening as a session beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good - it's thin and fairly light, but not lacking in flavor. Overall, I'd prefer this style to be a touch sweeter."
"Drinkability: Good beer with a meal (Moroccan style meatballs and couscous) but I could see myself slowly drinking one of these while reading something - the chocolate and coffee just make me think cafe in a way, but I'm doing the reading in a pub. A very good beer."
"D - An absolutely delicious beer. Incredibly complex with the characteristics changing from minute to minute as it warms."
"D - Loaded with flavor and complexity, especially considering the 4.6% ABV... A little more mouthfeel would go a long long way... All that being said, this is still an excellent Scottish Ale offering..."
"Thanks to Keith (DasBeef) for trading this to me. Kudos and Cheers!"
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. It's it's far darker than I expected for a Scotish Ale. It almost pours out black, but it's a bit decieving. When you hold it up to the light it's a deep amber/red/brown mix of colors. THe small parts you can see through actually has a little bit of clarity. A little lacing but not a whole lot. The smell is very unique. It has the major characteristics of both a Scotish Ale and an English Porter. Slight citrus smell, but big dark malt aromas. Toffee, caramelized and chocolate malts. The taste sets itself apart slightly from the smell, and maintains the same complexity. Big dark malt charactheristics. Roasted, chocolate, caramel, and even sligthlty burned malts. A little smokey, maybe peat. There's only a slight hop tates, but you have to look for it. I only noticed it because because my bitter tastebuds are working at the end of each sip. The mouthfeel is good, here's where you can really feel the mix of the two styles. It has the creaminess of a scottish ale and the smokeyness of a porter. Pretty drinkable with all that is going on. All in all a pretty good beer."
"This is almose perfect on cask. One of my all time favorite beers. This is a must if you see it on cask."
"More of a dark ale than a scottish ale, this is close to Orkney's Dragonhead Stout while being (overall) a better and more consistent beer. Although best from a cask, this is quite good from the bottle as well. A really solid and tasty beer."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly low alcohol content for such a bold tasting beer (4.6), meaning a bottle will not but you flat on your back. Hence can be savoured at any time of the day and will always be rewarding."
"The soft carbonation jumps out right away, with, again, subtle smoke making an appearance. The taste is a little bland overall, until it warms, when vanilla and sweet chocolate come out, blending with the smoke very nicely. Acquires a certain vinous quality as it hits about room temp. Very sessionable, with a silky medium body. I could drink a lot of this."
"Overall I'm really digging this, it smells fantastic and tastes freaking awesome. I'm not sure why this one doesn't get better reviews. Maybe I just got lucky with this bottle."
"Poured a ruby brown with a good one-finger tan head that died quickly and left little lace. Slightly buttery smell mixed with chocolate malts and hints of coffee as well as a decent fruit smell (think berries). A sharp, juicy fruit splash on the front of the tongue greets me; akin to cherries or figs. Then a medium-sized smooth and creamy body passes over my tongue with a mix of bitter chocolate, coffee malt and for balance some hop bitterness. An easy to drink ale that mixes fruit and malt sweetness with hints of dryness only slightly undone by a bitter finish."
"D - Low ABV and good flavors make this a good choice if you are into rich roasted malty beers."
"Pours nicely with a light brown head which stuck around quite well. Nice colour dark drown with ruby. Can smell the chocolate in there with possibly raspberries? Taste is similar with nice malt and nutty notes. Very drinkable, smooth and creamy. Was much happier with this than their Stout, has the same smokiness as the stout in the aftertaste. Want to nip in for the Reserve now, $50."
"Big time drinkable. I will definately pick up a few of these for the fridge. Bummed I've only got one."
"drinkability: interesting and I would love to try again fresh. It's so dry it drying my mouth out though. weird. It did not drink well with me. maybe it had light damage. it sat in the store for awhile Im sure."
"Not quite a winter warmer, not a spring summer brew. Very enjoyable around a fire, but the ABV for the amount I can drink isnt favorable."
"To sum things up, another fantastic beer from one of the best breweries in the United Kingdom. Granted it lacks the awesome name and accompanying controversy of Skullsplitter (British tabloids are either the pinnacle of human idiocy or an Onion-meets-Kauffman masterpiece of comedy) but chocolate +raspberry + darkish British ale is a combo so winning that even a drunken chimpanzee working for Miller-Coors couldn't totally mess it up and in the hands of the fantastic Orkney crew it soars. Scrum-diddley-umptious indeed."
"D: An amazing and desirable brew. Find it now."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite examples of the style, of which I must say I am not a huge fan. This, however, is a real tasty brew that's definitely worth a try if you see it around."
"Ales I have ever had, though probably not ideal for a session brew. The aroma and taste complinment each other wonderfully, and the flavor profile is enough to keep you interested. This is definitely one I will be coming back to from time to time."
"This is a very drinkable beer. The bottle is already going too fast. Could definitely have two of these 0.5L bottles in a sitting. Overall, a well crafted beer. I will be picking up more in the future and would like to try the big brother of this beer, Dark Island Reserve."
"This is my first Scottish ale, but based on my findings I'll be comparing other like beers to this style in the near future."
"D: Sessionable is an understatement, a pint or three would be fitting at the pub. Seemingly simple at first, yet captivating after a couple sips; the folks at Orkney know what they're doing. Definitely one I want to experience again."
"This beer pours a nice cola colour with decent carbonation that leaves a one finger head with nice lacing,it has aromas of caramel toffee,figs and some bitter mocha,it has an above average mouthfeel which finishes quite smooth with tastes of dark plums,bitter mocha and some dates aswell quite a pleasant beer thats very easy to drink."
"Dinkability - Lovely flavor coupled with relatively low alcohol by volume makes this perfectly sessionable, but the heavy mouthfeel tends to encourage slow savoring rather than quick drinking. The bottle is a pint 0.9 fl oz and this is a perfect size. Would do well in a sam smith style Brit bomber to. 12 oz would not be enough I think."
"nearly black with a dark red tint. Smells fascinatingly delicious: Coffee and chocolate are most prominent, with red wine fruitness and toffee bringing up the rear. The back label of the bottle describes it in the exact same way, but I thought it before I read it! Taste follows suit - chocolate malts, stronger coffee taste throughout, black cherries. Some astringency. A bit sweet, yet finishes dry, with a long lingering smokiness that I find to be the most pleasant aspect of the beer, being the fan of Islay scotch that I am. It makes me want to drink it slower to savor that, but the light body says keep going. I'm unfamiliar with the scottish ale style, but in terms I understand, this is a porter with less roastiness and more fruitness. Really complex and flavorful for its strength."
"D- This beer is mellow but rich in flavor with a nice bit of earthiness and I would love to try this on cask. I think there are some great flavors hidden in there. The tartness was also a nice compliment to the malts."
"On a side note, after finishing the review of this beer I went out for a cigar thinking it would pair well. Boy was I wrong. What a terrible cigar beer. Leave the cigar alone til you're done with this one."
"Finishes pretty long, pretty nice. For the most part, a middling Scottish ale. However, it is representative of the style and should be tried for anyone who tends this direction."
"I had this one from the cask. It's a dark beer, but by no means opaque. Smells of chocolate, malt, and perhaps a hint of fruit. It tastes of coffee and chocolate, lots of roasted flavours, but also has some acidic, almost fruity notes mixed in there. I found this one quite drinkable."
"The foam was very dark wheat that dissapated quickly but still stuck to the sides of the glass. The smell was light and crisp but extremely dark and nutty feel. The taste was excellent. Hearty taste of a wheat porter with hints of carmel. The color was a very dark cola. It had a excellent smooth mouthfeel"
"Dark Island started off great, but ended a little thin. Upon opening, it had a pleasant aroma followed by multiple tastes that rushed through my taste buds. You can taste a subtle hint of chocolate, the roast, and it leaves a long lasting coffee/caramel after taste. I sampled 1 pint/500 ml and it became a little too carbonated and thin about half way through and started reminding me of a Stewart's Root Beer. The color is dark brown but not opaque. It has a medium thickness in pour with a light chocolate colored head that formed nicely in the beginning, however, settled by mid-beer. I did enjoy Dark Island and would recommend only drinking about two after dinner as a nice treat to end your day."
" This is a pretty rightous and robust session brew."
"D: easily drinkable"
"Like I noted earlier in my review, this is one of the better Scottish ales on the market. It's very enjoyable and very approachable, the peat hits just right. The few beers that I've had from Orkney have been very good. Thanks for the brew David; I'm a huge fan of the style!"
"OVERALL: A fine Scottish ale by any standards. Not the best looking thing I've ever drunk, but very tasty, interesting and complex. The flavors are quite bold, so I think it would be hard to drink a few of these. A couple would be very enjoyable, however. This is one I'd pick up again for sure."
"this is a good albeit a lil light bodied beer. light in body only for the style though and it sticks around on your palate for a while which for a ""thinner"" beer is not a bad achievement"
"D: A little on the sweet side, but definitely a drinkable beer, this is fantastic, very complex, and a slow sipper, which is odd for something with low alcohol, excellent beer all the way around."
"Drinkability is pretty good, and interesting beer, defiantly has the Scottish ale profile but with a more porter like malt base. Worth trying but I'm not particularly wowed."
"Overall, nothing different here."
"Pours a dark brown color with honey brown highlights, the head has a nice milkshake quality to it, which settled into a sudsy cap. The aroma has a lactose sweetness to it with some light coffee and chocoate notes. The taste is of a lightly roasted malt, some sort of milky quality, and a metallic twang. Not really what I was expecting here, maybe it is the full body. The feel is very smooth and chewy, quite balanced. The drinkability is fine. No off flavors and good feel. If I didn't know any better I would think this was a stout. Really big body on this one."
"Dark ruby brown color, the head is slihtly tan and retains itself decently. Not a bad sight to see. The aroma greets the nose with a brush of banbna, then following its trail is bitter chocolate and bourbon barrel. Well, some kind of wooden vessel. The taste is where this beer is at. There are many different flavors to choose from. It has a buttery smooth feel, although a bit flimsy....tastes like toffee, butter, figs, wooden barrel (bourbon?), and a dash of coffee bean. Easy to drink without the buzz effect, but please....slow yourself down and enjoy the ride Dark Island has to offer."
"I don't remember this one being so peaty...still a good brew none-the-less."
" Drinkability is averageish. It's not terrible and I would enjoy one again...but would I keep a few extra on hand?...honestly I would not. The odd pick up from my local store sure but nothing to go out of my way to keep in stock"
"Drinkability is great. Very easy to drink, nice flavor, amazingly smooth."
"D: Easy enough to drink with that lower alcohol content, though it might not be so alluring as to tempt me into buying more of it. Nonetheless, a fairly decent brew that I was happy to try."
"Dark brown color with avg head. Smells a little like wine but more of like citrus fruit and coffee. Light in the mouth with semi sweet acidic taste and a deep deep coffee grinds / dark chocoalte finish. Very smooth drinking. Good beer but wouldnt drink frequently. Maybe with desert (yeah I said it) cause of its coffee flavor."
"Dark Island poured a nice dark brown, with a nice tan head. Smell was very strong of super sweet malt. Taste had slight hints of chocolate, roasted malts, mild sweetness. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkability seemed ok, it was a bit filling. Overall I found this to be an interesting beer. Seemed very stout like to me. I was a good ale, but a little pricey. Something like 5.29 for a 500ml bottle. Not a bad beer, I would not turn one down. But this beer confused me. I do intent to try more Scottish Ales."
"A very good example of the style. Drinkable and possibly more spot-on than American versions of this style."
"D: It is a smooth and easy brew to drink but it is a bit too sweet for a session beer. It makes for a nice after dinner treat."
"Very drinkable. I could easily drink a number of these. Overall a great beer."
"Poured out of the 500ml bottle a deep, dark brown like root beer with a two finger tan head. Dissipated after about two minutes to a skim of medium sized bubbles. Intermittent lacing. Big nose of roasted malts and chocolate malts. The flavors were quite enjoyable, roasted malt again up front followed by peat smoke and then a long, distinct milk chocolate finish that coats the tongue. Medium to full bodied and medium carbonation. Though technically a Scottish Ale it drinks more like a Porter and as such is not varietally correct but all the more enjoyable for those like myself who prefer darker brews. Either way this is a very good beer and worth picking up."
"D- 4.6% for this gem makes it VERY sessionable. I could easily drink this all day long."
"I got this off the internet but now I would spend time hitting up local stores to see who can get it. Like it a lot."
"D: Very drinkable at 5% ABV. Nice balance make it easy."
"taste is tart, dark chocolate, sour malt, some licorice, some vanilla, touch of woodiness."
"This beer, as a Scottish Ale, is actually darker than their ""MacGregor"" Scotch Ale. If this makes sense, that one was toasty, this one is roasty. Generally I expect a little more flavor from this style, but I can really respect the subtlety of this one. Perfect for relaxing on a Sunday afternoon. Recommended."
"Ale. Tasty."
"This is a well crafted beer, but I'm just not a fan of the flavour."
"This is a solidly drinkable beer. It reminds me of a stout in some ways, particularly the heaviness. Nonetheless, a well done beer."
"This poured a very dark brown with light tan head. It smelled like roasted malt and whole grain wheat. It tasted somewhere between a porter and a red ale, with a dominant malt flavors, although there was also noticeable hops and even garlic. It was watery with a little carbonation and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was pretty good, and an interesting Scottish style ale."
"D - Probably the most complex beer I've had that has such a low ABV%. Highly reccomended."
"Poured a nice deep brown, like burnt motor oil. Had some good carbonation on the pour and finished with a small tan head that stuck around even as I drank. The nose was roasted malts, chocolate, figs or raisins and some toffee. The taste was oh so smooth. Chocolate, coffee, figs and roasted goodnes...mouthfeel was excpetional, it libgered around for a good 10 seconds on the finish! Exceptional beer!!!"
"It's very drinkable. I would give it a 4.5 on drinkability if it had a little more body."
"Malty, smoky, meaty aroma, very much like a German Rauchbier. Very dark brown with a thick, rocky, mostly lasting tan head. Very malty flavor with slightly smoky flavor and slight sourness and bitterness. Medium-light carbonation and medium bodied with a fairly long, mellow finish. Aftertaste similar to aroma: malty, smoky and meaty. Nice beer. Not what I expected but a pleasant surprise."
"I went in my favorite store looking to get some Dragonhead Stout,and lo and behold they were out,so seeing this and noticing that it was from the same brewery,I thought what the Hell,I'll give it a try.I'm glad I did...this one IMHO is incredible.It had everything I look for in a beer,and I cannot not wait to get some more."
"Notes: bought this on a whim and it isn't for me, there are better scottish ales"
"Medium-bodied. Easy to drink."
"Poured into a SA glass a dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and some smokyness. The taste is malty, smoky, chocolate/toffee/caramel. The finish is dry and slight bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, I really do not care for the smokyness, ever so slight."
"D = Highly drinkable. Wasn't sure what to expect from this as the bottle proclaims it to be a Dark Ale, whatever that means. I am very happy I picked this up. Will definitely drink again. Could session with this beer, too."
"Pours a very dark brown that shows some dark ruby tints when held to light. Minimal tan-nish head falls fairly quickly. Nose is that woody syrupy sweet thickness. Pretty traditional stuff. Seems like there are some coffee grind tones on the end too. Flavor tastes like bitter old coffee at first but calms down to only a fairly bitter tone. As it warms it becomes more pleasant and some firm peat tones really start to appear. Leaves a smoked, peaty like aftertaste in the mouth. Feel has a thick liquid body and a good level of carbonation. Overall a decent brew. If you drink it too soon without letting it warm up, don't expect as much as you should be getting."
"Dark amber-brown with a big, dense tan head. Malty aroma with hints of smoke. Tasty malty roast aroma with a very subtle hop background. Body is just right for style. This is very good version of the ""Scottish," not ""Scotch"" ale style."
"D: This is an excellent beer. If you come across it, do yourself a favor and try it."
"D - Very high, the low abv and light profile coupled together make this one an excellent session brew. If I could find it closer to where I live, I would make this a staple in my collection. Recommended."
"BIA: No. This one just doesn't do it for me."
"This has an excellent look to it, a nice burnt brown instead of the extremely burnt copper of many scotch ales, along with an excellent head and wonderful lacing. It has a very pleasing scent, a mixture of peat and burnt oak, along with a subtle bit of malt. Nice taste, malty with hints of burnt grains. It has the usual scotch ale flavor, along with a bit of caramel, but the flavor isn't as strong as most scotch ales, even the non wee heavies, but it's still quite good, and gets better and heavier with each drink. It goes down extremely well, though, a nice smooth and creamy drink with a great finish."
"I poured this odd looking little beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was certainly dark actually opaq looking. The head was decent and was full of very fine bubbles. The smell was nutty like amoretto. The taste was r=the same with a nutty flavor that was rather nice. I also thoughht it was a tiny bit smokie but that mighth have been due to my last beer before I drank this one. In any event I will buy again."
"Yep, that's Scottish alright. The only culture who gets drunk enough to burn dirt. ..and then make beer with it. Fresh from the bottle, the beer emits a burst of peat / campfire / smoke qualities along with a hearty molassas sweet scent and dark fruits. As expected, the appearance is a solid brown color with a tawny tan head that shows a lot of creaminess and lacing. The taste of the beer does a backflip, giving a lot of syrup-sweet maltiness, rich dark figs, dates, plumbs, and grapes. The beer holds firm with woody, earthy, smoky flavors showing midway through the sip and increasing into the finish. Moderately hopped for bitterness but no hop aroma or flavor. Certainly balanced toward the malts. Despite such bold flavors, the feel is lighter than expected, but without thinning or becomming watery; remains creamy throughout. Maybe a touch of roasted grain chalkiness in the finish. A good beer, but even boldly smoky for a Scotch Ale."
"Overall, this was just a so-so brew."
"Thanks to Tom for letting me try this at the Carolina Brewmasters Annual Memorial Day BBQ. Very dark appearance. Cream off tan head. Molasses, bready aroma. Fruitiness, and peat smell and flavor, though not overwhelming. Not for a summer BBQ, but good example of the style, one I am still trying to be more familiar with."
"Fairly sweet up front, but then an interesting salty, smoky note becomes noticeable. So now that spicy note in the nose makes sense. Peat it is. The salty, smoky peat character couples with notes of chocolate and a host of (though in no way dominating) burnt characteristics (acidity, dusty burnt grain, and a touch of coffee). This is an interesting beer, I was not expecting this at all. The smoke actually adds something like sweetness, which couples with the residual malt sugars. This is quite a tasty brew, once again I am quite impressed with this brewery and of course I always love tasty, lower alcohol brews."
"Drinkability: This is sessionable at about 5%."
"Drinkability: While I like certain smoked beers, others just turn me off; unfortunately, this is one that I don't care for, even though I appreciate its complexity, as I don't like the sour aspect"
"A fine beer that made me forget about the miserable torrential rain outside. Definitely a must try as a cask beer."
"Root beer color, peaty/ earthy aroma and flavor. This was a very nice mellow ale for modest comfort-quaffing after coming in out of the cold. It made me want to wear a sweater. Cask-conditioned gives it that extra edge on aroma, flavor and mouth feel. At the bar that served it I suddenly wished I had arrived without my friends so I could take the last chair by the fire to close my eyes and slowly pour this beer down my hatch."
"Overall: I wasnt sure what to expect from this beer, but I was very pleasantly surprised. This is very solid example of a Scotch ale with great smoky character without being overpowering (Rogues chipotle ale comes to mind as an example of smoky overdone). Highly enjoyable; recommended."
"Smooth flavor with a medium pronounced hop bitterness that has a slight edge over the malty flavors. For a dark ale I hate to say this is almost balanced. Sweetish malt flavors with an earthy hop bitterness. A good froth on the palate and it maintians it taste and flavor profiles. The hops come back in at the finish as well. Not bold but a good full-bodied ale."
"D: a nice change from traditional scottish ales, smokey nutty aspect makes it very warming, a nice Cold January fireside ale"
"I was surprised that I didn't like this beer more, but the overdone smokiness just really compounded with each sip until I just didn't enjoy it any longer. I typically like the style and the presentation, nose and mouthfeel were all fine. The smokiness just really dominated with each successive sip. I have noted the high marks from most other reviewers, but I just really had a hard time finishing my particular bottle. The other Orkney beers I've tried I have really enjoyed, but unfortunately I cannot count Dark Island among them. I guess it's just not my bag."
"D: Was a nice beer to enjoy with Burns night supper but just a tad too smoky for my taste but a fine beer otherwise."
"The beer pours a rich brown with a tan head. The aroma is of dark scottish malt. The taste is incredibly light, it starts with a nice sharp bite of toasted malt then rounds out with just a slight sweetness. The feel is smooth light and dry almost evaporating off your tounge as you swallow. This is one of those times you want to pat your back for having grabbed this one. Just a wonderful beer. The brewer has been able to highlight the toasting of the malt without overpowering you."
"Originally reviewed on September 27, 2005. 500mL Bottle. Dark clear brown pour, with a ruby-glinted pour. Topped with a quickly fading bubbly tan head. Earthy and grassy strong oats and wheat aroma, very grainy and malty. Coarse, yet enticing. Some chocolate aroma. Watery and crisp, with a smooth oaty and earthy. Lots of horseblanket and sheep barn. A tinge of chocolate, no alcohol burn. Very drinkable. Much like a beefed up Mild Ale to me."
"Very smoky flavor almost favoring a rauchbier except that the finish is very smooth, creamy and mellow. A bit overcarbonated at the start but pleasant in its different ways as each mouthfeel progresses. This is a brew with a lot of flavor and character and I find it quite enjoyable. Now I just have to make it to Scotland and try it on cask."
"The beer swirled very well round the mouth, nice and full of body, but still very drinkable. This was consumed in the New Bazaar in Dumfries (Scotland), a number of the lads stayed on it all night. A very drinkable beer, much more suited to the cask rather than bottle."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours with moderate head, white and bubbly atop an opaque body. Not quite black, purple/burgundy highlights when held to the light. Some sparse lacing that clings loosely to the glass. A roast, robust ""stout"" like aroma. Void of coffee or chocolat perse, but still stout like in its character. A great deal of toasty roast that continues into the flavour and rounds out the mouthfeel, for a complete, satisfying finish. Distant (at best) Scotch notes but I only say that because its listed as a Scotch ale. Otherwise, as a stout, or just general dark beer this is excellent. Aroma of a deep, British porter (think Fullers). Excellent water with well-rounded finish. In a truly U.K. way this is understated goodness., I liked it more at first, it grew slightly dull - but all the same largely likeable and personable. This drinks fantastically."
"nothing is blowing your socks off here, but this is a very drinkabile flavorful beer."
"Poured a very deep reddish brown color with moderate tannish head. Nice lacing. Smell is dominated a a rich dark fruitiness that is very pleasant to the nose. Taste is also strong on the fruits with plums mainly showing through. Finish is more rich malt and is extraordinarily enjoyable. An excellent, flavorful easy to drink beer."
"Notes: With all the flavor that happens in this brew you'd be shocked that its actuall a smallish offering at 4.6%. Gotta love these low abv's from accross the pond that absolutely tantalize the taste buds with an array of complex flavor. Although this is just decent in my book it shows you the possibilities of beer."
"The dominate flavor I notice is smokey flavor quite strong, I'm assuming from peat smoked malt? A strong roasted flavor also evident. Hops don't seem to stand out, I feel like this is a well balanced beer. I wish this were available in Texas."
"Decent mouthfeel and lower ABV make this a potential session ale. A great brew from the far reaches of Scotland."
"Pours beautifully, with the big head falling out in the liquid at first. Still it leaves a massive beige head, creamy at the top and filled with tiny bubbles underneath. Dark red color, clear. Burnt and quite a bit of smoke in the scent. Fairly low bitterness. Fresh mouthfeel, but not much taste at first, clear chocolate and a bit of coffee in the aftertaste though."
"Mouthfeel- A little dry, but easily outweighted by the overall malty flavors of the beer."
"-SS"
"A hearty, robust ale. Also incredibly filling. I hadn't eaten for hours when I drank this and it sat heavy in the stomach. Definitely will satisfy not only thirst, but hunger too."
"M&D: overall the texture is creamy smooth, almost like a smoked+milk stout for that matter~~ light on the mouthfeel but not falling thin-ish. It's rather like a smooth stout rather than a so-called Scottish Ale, and this surely is a very delicious and easy-drinking sample."
"Pretty drinkable, good smoked/scottish ale. Worth a try if you like (as I do) restrained smokiness"
"D - If you pour liquid smoke in your cereal or save your cigarette ash for seasoning, then this is the beer for you. Otherwise it should stay on the shelves. Naturally, it is too gross to session. It might go with a cigarette, but I don't smoke. Normally I am avidly against drain pours, but I don't classify this as beer - it's cigarette juice. I hope the drain finds you more pleasant then I do!"
"I'd compare it to Belhaven Scottish Ale, but darker and dryer."
"Looks the part. Very dense, dark brown with a creamy beige head that stays for quite a while..and leaves some nice lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. Aroma is pretty good here as well. Very malty, slightly smoky..essences of coffee and roasty bitterness. 4.6% alcohol? pretty weak for a scottish ale, if you ask me.. The flavor mimics the smell almost exactly, with a harsh finish of roasted bitterness and some dark fruit complexities thrown in the mix as well. Impressive it's so complex and stays under 5% abv. A really drinkable dark ale. I wasn't expecting too much from this one, but it surprised me..and I'd definitely give it a try again."
"Pours a deep deep crimson amber color...Maybe even brown with ruby hues. Very nice color. A finger of head falls to a patchy coat over top. Nose is chocolate, with a light smokeyness and a moderate caramel sweetness. Flavor is chocolate and smokeyness. I really like it. A light touch of roastyness is there too, but chocolate and smoke are most prevalent. Very nice. Feel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation. Very drinkable brew. I really like the flavor. One of the more dark scottish ales I've had, but I like the combination."
"OK, this is a very good beer, but it is not a Scotch Ale. If you enjoy dry stouts or robust porters, you'll likely enjoy this one."
"SLAINTE! Beertracker"
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It is sweet and creamy with a roasted feel. It boasts of crystal, chocolate, and roasted malts. The taste is good. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and slight bitter. It has a roasted/woody flavor with loads of sweet malts and bitter hops. It has a bitter/earthy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. Some may find this to be too light, but it works for me. It's a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. I wish the CO2 was a little lighter, but it drinks well despite it. This is a flavorful brew. These guys don't make bad beers."
"Dark Island is a deep, dark brown in color with an average-sized, light brown head. The head has a nice creamy texture and good retention. The aroma is of sweet chocolatey malts with an earthy undertone and a touch of roastiness. The taste consists of a nice combination of chocolate-flavored and earthy malts. A moderate roasted flavor adds a layer of complexity and is most potent in the finish. Light herbal hopping provides balance, bitterness, and just a bit of flavor. This is great stuff, I love the layering of tastes and subtle complexities. If this weren't so heavy I would give it a higher drinkability score. Anyway, still highly recommended."
"Extremely creamy and drinkable off the cask. This one was complex and very tasty. A little light on the mouthfeel for a Scottish ale, but very enjoyable and worth a few."
"Very dark ruby red, not quite black but nearly there. There's a good tan head and great lacing. Aroma is mildly roasty, not very strong; carbonation is at a good level. Smooth on the palate (Orkney's trademark as such), roast flavours are predominate with a little peatyness. Some hop flavour comes out to balance after a second or two, but I wasn't expecting much in that department from a Scottish beer. So smooth - very drinkable."
"Deep brown and ruby highlights, good sticky lacing. Not a ton in aroma on this beer. Taste is predominatly malty. I expect some level of smoke flavor in a scottish ale, but I did not pick any up in this one. Kind of blah. A bit overcarbonated as well. Not a horrible beer, but there are better representations of the style out there."
"Whoa. Heady stuff this. Drinks like a comet struck old oak, charred and metallic, green but dead. I think they got the ABV% backwards. Enjoyable for it's oddity. I'd have to consume a couple more to know if it's worth buying again?"
"Very good, like all the other beers of this brewery."
"Dark Island is smokier than necessary, not that I'm complaining. I dig rauchbier, and I love Scotch big time. Actually, I'm fond of the Orkney distilleries, Scapa and Highland Park. The funny thing is, Dark Island Ale is peatier than Orkney Island whisky."
"A dark red/brown/near black brew with a thick head of creamy foam, especially for a hand-pulled pint o' goodness. Aromas are of rich smoky malts, caramel, and other sweet-ish malt esters. There are also some faint floral hops detectable within the sweet roasty mess of this brews aroma. The taste is quite intriguing. I taste molasses, and other sweet/sugary flavors as well as those faint hops and a nice roasty/smoky flavor in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick, without being too thick, and scotch-ale like. Drinkability is very good, this is a very 'quaffable' dark ale, if I do say so myself. I agree that this is like a dark mild as well. Almost like a dark mild, light scotch ale hybrid. Very nice regardless. I never liked the skullsplitter, it may be time to try it again. Perhaps I should track it down on cask?"
"Drinkability - a fine brew, one of the better examples of the style I've had."
"Black body that turns dark purple with the light. Small, tan foam head. Scent is mainly chocolatly malts. Nice tasty chocolate malt front, bitter hop backbone, subtle, yet effective. Nice creamy mouthfeel. This is a nice tasty treat for any malthead."
"This one pours a brown color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma is really weak - nothing much here. Maybe a little malts. The flavor has asmokiness to it and a slight malt character. It finishes smooth and bitter. This is an interestingly good taste, but it's hard to describe. I'm not sure that I enjoyed this brew much."
"The mouthfeel was a nice ride! The carbonation lingered with almost a bite then cascaded down my throat. I found it very refreshing."
"Disappointing."
"I may be reviewing this beer a little past its prime, but it still is quite excellent. I forgot I had this in my cellar, no idea why I cellared it for almost a year. Pours a dark dark brown/black with very little head. Aroma is rich, malty, almost like a toned down JW Lees with a hint of conac. Taste is much of the same... ripe fruits, roasted malt, and a pleasant sweetness. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but I think that is a result of holding on to this one a bit too long."
"I've had a number of good Scottish ales recently and Dark Island is the best of the lot. The pint bottle was a little on the expensive side ($4), but well worth it. I'll be sure to pick up a few more of these beauties whenever and wherever I find them. Anyone looking to dip a toe into the 'Scottish ale loch' would be hard-pressed to find a better place to start than Dark Island."
"Pours a deep brown with some ruby highlights thru out with more head than expected,aroma was suprisingly light a little brown sugar and touch of smokiness.Taste of dark fruit and mildly sweet with a touch of peat in the finish that lingers.A solid ale pretty easy to drink."
"A nice ale, something a bit different"
"Very dark brown almost black in color with ruby tints. Good creamy off white head some lace. Big malty aroma with a good heft of roasted malt in there. Delicious rich coffee note blended with a nice smooth roasted bitterness. A good robust beer that stood up well with my curry."
"The mouthfeel was an enormous let-down, flat in the mouth. This was a refreshing drink and deserves high marks for quaffability."
"This is, without a shadow of doubt, one of the finest stouts I have tasted. This succeeds where Guiness Draught goes wrong  instead of being smooth and creamy, Island is coarse and fluid. It is almost akin to drinking a pint of charcoal, and one could even call it a session stout. The closest rival I have found is probably Hopbacks Entire Stout."
"In the bottle, this is a tasty brew as well, and not very different at all from cask. Flavours stick out more individually than the more blended cask, and the mouthfeel is a bit thinner yet, but still eminetly drinkable."
"Dark brown color. Large white foamy head. Aroma is dark fruit, brown sugar and smoke. A medium bodied Scottish ale. Malts are complex, rich and smoky. Hints of smoke and peat, vanilla and whisky. Very smooth taste that gives way to a very pleasant dry finish. Very easy drinking, example of a Scottish ale. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours a clear, deep chestnut brown with a luscious three finger beige head that quickly falls into patchy sheets of lace that cling to the glass. Aroma is subdued and has some toffee and peaty smokiness. Mouthfeel has medium carbonation, is rich and slightly creamy, and has a mild hops sting. Sweet toffee and caramel lead the malt dominance. There is a smoky peat taste that echoes the nose, and a hops balance that wavers between fruity and floral. Finish is somewhat bitter, and this ale is well balanced, overall. Distinctively Scottish, and nicely drinkable, but not the best offering from Orkney."
"Screams session brew as it is full of flavor but interminably drinkable. This beer, on cask, in Scotland? Brilliance. More quality from the makers of the vaunted Skullsplitter."
"Scotch ales are typically among my favorite brews, but this one seemed a bit off. It's worth a try just because of its unique flavors, but it's not something I'd come back for. The 4.6%abv makes it highly drinkable if you like the flavors."
"The beer disembarks the bottle a very deep mahogany color with the head prodigious in size and semi-creamy in size and a light tan in color, the lace a thick and clinging sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and crisp with a hint of caramel, earthy aroma also present, the start is sweet, nicely malted, the top is middling in feel, Finish is benignly acidic, the hops pleasant and mild to the palate, very dry and long lasting aftertaste, quite quaffable this Scottish Ale, Good Golly Miss Molly, two new Scottish Ales in one week, ah the beer Gods have smiled upon Olde Gusler, and my Thanks to steview for this bottle."
"This beer came in a 16.9 ounce bottle."
"Presented in a pint glass, but went down faster than a shot of tequilla."
"Called a dark Ale - but I think it's more of a porter. I liked this a lot and could easily drink a few."
"The taste is at heart a fairly standard flavor, with subtle little hints of something more complicated underneath. Lightly malty. Perhaps lightly toffee flavored. Ever so slightly toasted, but still much lighter than a Porter or Stout. Exactly the sort of beer I'd want in massive quantities to go with a nice hearty meaty dinner. Alas, it doesn't seem to get sold in the quantities I'd like. Better out there? Sure. But this one's still plenty fun."
"Pours with a three-fingered very light, brown head that fades slowly and leaves good lace. A nice deep, ruby color. Nose has just a hint of roasted coffee. Starts hoppy/malty and finishes with a hint of malt/hops and just a hint of bitterness. Very good carbonation. $3.99 for 500ml."
"Aroma of raisins and sour fruit notes, along with toasted nuts and malt. The flavor is peaty and a bit sour, though fruit notes come along with some light chocolate flavor. The feel is a tad thin and watery, though not entirely unpleasant. Easy drinking, seemingly uncomplex beer."
"Nice dark brown/black color witha nice brown foamy head. I didn't think that it was a wine colored ale as advertised There are hints of roasted barley, nuts, and hops in the aroma. Real nice taste that is robust in flavor that is slightly bitter with chocolate and fruit undertones. Very well balanced between the hops and malts. Definately worth checking out."
"Fairly pleasant. Sweetish malts at the start (chocolate+ a t touch of sugar and also some toffee). nice roasty, peaty finish, thin-ish body with some sourness, musty, sulfuric, and maybe a bit unexciting, but fairly easy to drink. Cask at Chelmsford Beer fest 03'."
"This beer pours a clear very dark brown color with a small tan head that dissipates to nothing. The smell is sweet and sherry like with a peaty background. The taste is smokey and peaty malt with an ascending hoppiness and very slight sourness. The mouthfeel is moderate. A smokey peaty scottish ale with a pleasant flavor that would benefit from a slightly heavier mouthfeel"
"Can't believe that a beer this powerful, complex, and satisfying is only 4.6% ABV."
"Noticed this one on tap at several places while in Scotland. I finally had it at the Hampden B&B in Edinbourgh. Murky deep dark brown to black in color. Hints of ruby along the edges as it is held to the light. Head is bubbly and light brown. Held up nicely. Faint smells of ovaltine and smoked peat. First taste is toasted malt again, some peat, and hints of chocolate creaminess. Maybe some roasted plums or something in there as well. The taste of this beer is nearly exception to begin with, then it seemed to get a little slick, and watery as the beer warmed a bit. The flavors seemed to drown out, if that's possible. Still very good and exactly the kind of beer I was hoping to find in Scotland. A real treat on tap."
"Very rich and malty in the mouth. Chocolate predominates, but its also a touch winey. Some hop bitterness acts to balance all of the malt, and there's just a touch of Burton-like sulphur on the end, giving a little extra length. Mouthfeel is a bit flat and dead, but that just might be the sulphur."
"The body is nicely dark. The head is sluggish and short-lived. There's a nice dark maltiness in both the aroma and flavor, but the flavor suffers from being a bit thin. Nice chocolate and charcoal in the flavor, a little cookie. A bit sweet but not cloying."
"In a blind tasting, I would have been hard-put to pigeonhole this beer. Some nice roasted malt notes, with a touch of peat, suggest the Scottish origin, but there was a bit of thinness to the beer with some tart astringency and fairly dry finish that would have made me suspect a black beer. Overall, a quite tasty beer, but not something that really grabbed my attention."
"Had this puppy in the States in the bottle and was fortunate enough to try it in Edinburgh on cask-AMAZING.Poured a beautiful deep dark burgundy with a slight head about 1/4 inch thick.The aroma was mild malt and hops.A great malty flavor prevails with hints of caramel and some slight vanilla.Just a kiss of hops comes thru.Smooth as silk and an overall very drinkable brew.It dragged us back to the same pub twice in 2 days.Well worth seeking out if and when visiting Scotland.Would like to get to the brewery someday..sigh.............."
"This beer poured in the glass a deep chocolate brown color that had ruby red highlights when held to the light. It was crystal clear and few carbonation bubbles were noticed. The foam that sat atop of the beer was a medium to cocoa powder tan that when poured aggressively produced a decent head that was thick but not long lasting. When it subsided it left a thick ring around the edges that helped leave a decent lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were at first big chocolates, followed by sweet and roasted malts, vanilla bean, coffee, light smoke, sweet dark fruit, and licorice. The flavors that rolled across my tongue were of roasted malts, chocolates  bitter and creamy milk -, dark fruit, slight citrus, a dry cocoa powder, tobacco, and some peat. It left a roasted nut feel behind that had a hint of sweetness to it as an aftertaste. This beer was surprisingly smooth and very drinkable. I wish 2 things from it 1) More alcohol, and 2) a bigger bottle. A really good drink."
"Dark brown with some red highlights, I would call it a rusty brown. A light brown bubbly head sat on top of the beer. Overall the flavor and aroma were pretty with biscuity grain and hint of coffee coming through. Nice malt sweetness. Not much hops to speak of."
"For me a very very drinkable beer.. i will be buying this again guaranteed."
"Cocoa colored head, dark black body. Nose is fruity, vinous, sensations of cherries, grapes, other dark fruits, but mildly, plus some spiciness, cloves, etc. Medium carbonation. Solid malt, and minimal hop presence. Thick and full, a perfect fit for a damp, cold, dark island, an ideal comfort for a gloomy atmosphere. Finish is bitter, but overall, if a bit too light in body and lacking in hops for my taste."
"Courtesy of Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. I didn't really enjoy this one very much. Pours a dark ruby color with a thin beige head and thin lacing. Aroma is faintly sweet malt and toffee. Very fruity flavor without the maltiness I have come to associate with the better Scottish Ales. Finish had some hops but was too sour. A little disappointing but I have had worse."
"This is one badass beer! At first smell, it smells like steak sauce, so that should clue you into what kind of food goes well with it. The initial part of the taste is one of steak sauce, but not too overbearing that it's bad. The finishing taste is nice, dry and fruity, which goes down nice and smooth.I had my girlfriend try it, she likes light beers, and she really liked it. I had to fight her to get it back. That should tell you that this beer should be tried by most. Had a little head to it, but nothing super crazy or anything,"
"I liked this offering from the Orkeny better than their Skullsplitter."
"A nice little guy here.  Much bigger profile than the 4.6%ABV would indicate."
"Dark brown with some light transmission at the bottom of the glass.  Pale and nice creamy head.  Aroma is mostly of black strap molasses.  Lighter-bodied than I expected, malt is weighted toward a gingerbread sense with a little impression of coffee.  Then, the flavor thins a lot and gets more candy-like and stifling.  Interesting, but a weak closer in the flavor department, to me."
"A very complex beer.  Dark brown/ruby color with slight tan head that drops to a collar throughout the drinking session; lacing well.  The smell is a wonderful chocolate and malty nose.  The taste is a bit vinous, very malty sweet, with good notes of bitterness and chocolate and roasted malt blending in.  I understand they use Golden Promise malt as a base malt and Challenger hops, which may account for the fruity undertones.  Overall a nice beer in the bottle that only hints at its full potential as a cask-conditioned ale...."
"Opaque brown in color with a tan head that drops quickly to a decent collar and whispy foam across the surface and leaving just some light lace. The aroma offers a light dark fruit note, a sweet caramel maltiness, and a soft espresso-like roastiness. The body is light, the carbonation limited, and the mouthfeel oily. The flavor, however, is richly malty and quite complex with notes of dark chocolate, burnt caramel, coffee, biscuit, and soft dark fruits. The finish is sweet, even candyish at times, with a light fudge-like note - but always well balanced by an underlying bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. Although this is a Scottish ale, a warmer serving temperature closer to British standards seems to display its character best. Worth trying, but not worth seeking. Probably very nice cask-conditioned."
"Slightly hazy deep garnet hue topped by a light beige head that recedes into a thin but dense lace leaving layer. Treacle and dark fruity esters reminescent of prune dominate the aroma, with dark caramel malt and roasted barley secondary. Very enjoyable aromawise.  Roasted barley and hop bitterness is well offset by a dark caramel sweetness. Slightly tart fruity esters combined w/ residual sweetness lend a subtle sweet/tart note that integrates well with the prominent dark caramel.  Lightly bodied, but not at all weak considering the low gravity.  Finishes abruptly clean and a bit dry, w/ light residual sugars quickly fading.  Dark Island has deep flavor for a beer of low relative strength.  An ideal session brew."
"Wonderfully rich, dark appearance. A nicely pulled pint, with a creamy, dense head. Sweetish, light molasses, raisin bready aroma. Fruitiness, hop and some very mild peat interplay to make this a bittersweet treat. I thought as I quaffed, that this could be catagorized as a dark mild as well. The body is substantial enough without being too heavy. A fine brew."
"BBQ dark color.  tight carbonation and tan head.  mix of sweet and smoke aroma.  slightly creamy, slightly acidic flavor in finish."
"Dark ruby color, almost black.  Cream colored, lacy head.  Nice roasted/smoked malt aroma blended with fruity toffee.  Flavor is even better.  Smoked malt, light fruit, and toffee combine with a slight hop bitterness.  The flavors blend smoothly into a wonderful beer.  Could have a bit more kick to it, but I've got no real complaints."
"Notes: Tiny complexities make this a very interesting ale, definitely give this one a try."
"This one of the very best (moderate strength) beers I've ever had (from cask). Aroma and flavour of dried fruits, coffee and liqourice. Can't think of any faults with it."
