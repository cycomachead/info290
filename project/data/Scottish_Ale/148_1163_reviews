"Excellent ale.  Hard to get in metro Atlanta."
"My favorite ale of all time.  Very smooth and nutty with a hint of banana bread and just the right amount of carbonation and alcohol.  Good with a cheeseburger and good for refreshment any time of the year warm or cold!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium dark amber with offwhite head, decent lacing. Very rich, fruity caramel aroma with touch of hops. Taste is similar with butterscotch/ caramel with just a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little thin.Overall this is a great ale."
""
""
"O: [3.75] Somehow this one is better than the sum of its parts.  I feel like it is just average on each rating but the overall seems to be above average.  I don't think I'd seek it out but I enjoyed this beer and would drink it again if it was in front of me."
""
""
"T: carmel nutty goodness F: light crips carbonated O: this is good will buy again"
""
""
"Beautiful amber/orange color. Excellent clarity. Complex, sweet bready, toasty aromas and flavors with subtle fruity esters and caramel notes. Balanced nicely with a incredibly dry finish. Very easy drinking."
""
""
"Alc. 5.2% vol."
""
"O – Very easy to drink, definitely a good example of the style. Malty-sweet, a well-made beer. I really like this beer."
"Keg of belhaven ale drank."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice rich ale.  Can definitely tell a difference from Scotland."
""
""
""
""
"Nutty caramel aroma. Crisp clear brown body with a mild head to start but fades fairly quick. Caramel and nut noticeable in flavor too. Mild bitterness. Has a smooth texture and has a fairly clean finish."
""
""
"just a normal beer, nothing crazy"
""
"This is, by far, my favorite ale. Except for the feel, it's the standard to which I compare all others."
""
"I love Belhaven from a nitro can. It's one of my favorite beers. Smooth malty flavor with very little hop presence."
""
"Good smooth taste, I was a little let down on feel, but due to where I got it from. If you like Yuengling with a Scottish ale twist, I definitely recommend."
""
""
""
"Overall i thought this was ok, though there was something about the taste that seemed a little different/off. Not bad/infected, just a bit weird. Probably wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Biscuit, toasted malt, spicy herbal hop note. This brew kind of grew on me with each sip. A nice session beer."
""
""
"My first Scottish Ale, so I have no basis for comparison with other beers of this style."
""
""
""
"O – Very easy to drink, definitely a good example of the style.  Malty-sweet with almost no hop character. Not my favorite, but a well-made beer."
""
""
"From the bottle: there is sweet smell of malty goodness with a hint of citrusy hops. Out pours a caramel-copper colored beer with a white creamy head. There is lots of carbonation with a sticky lace that doesn’t fade. Rich toasted-smoky malts blend with a hint of nuttiness that gives way to the finishing bitterness of quality hops. This is a respectable beer that I can’t wait to try the nitro version."

""
""
""

"That chewy maltiness slight sweetness balanced well against a slightly bitter finish, actually quite good just let down by a bit of a funky aroma :/"
""
""
""
"Delicious!  My favorite cask-style canned beer (with widget)."
""
""
""
"Good clear look with nice head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty decent, ""standard""-ish ale. Seems kind of like the Bass of Scotland."
"It pours dark brown, with a nominal foamy head, and smells ""good."" Unfortunately none of that goodness translates into taste."

"Was at Phil's Liqour and the owner suggested this beer after I told him what I was looking for in a beer this warm Sunday afternoon.  The guy never steered me wrong before, so this is what I got.  It was a copper colored ale in a stout looking clear bottle.  Poured into a Sierra Nevada hop tulip it poured with a very creamy looking 1'' head which steadily receded to about a quarter inch.  Smells for the glass are nuts, bread dough and a smell I cannot identify.  First impressions on taste are exactly as it smells.  Pleasant, pleasing, and leaving a very slight sourness that lingers on the palate, with just a touch of bitterness balancing it out.  Halfway down the beer I come to a conclusion.  This beer is lower in alcohol, not a ton of flavors, and nothing fancy about it, but in a good way.  Like an old tree that has taken ages to attain a good form, it reflects simplistic beauty.  These beers subtly lull you into spending an afternoon drinking and enjoying good beers without getting hammered.   A beer that could appeal to even those who are not beer enthusiasts as well.  A solid B+ to the folks who made this beer.  If it wasn't 12 a six pack, I would put it into the regular rotation, but this will be a once in a while relaxing Sunday beer from now on."

"Overall (4.08) : By far the best Scottish Ale I've had yet. I've tried Odell's 90 Shilling, and one other that I didn't care much for. Ultimately before I decided to write Scottish Ales off I figured I'd try a genuine forerunner. I am not sorry I did. Problem is, how am I gonna finish this pint? Oh, bother."
""
"Lots of smooth malt flavor with a little hop bite at the finish. Very slight hints of nuts. Excellent Scottish Ale!"

"T-  The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a medium amount of sweetness with the malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the caramel seeming to stick out the most this time and it still has a light smokey aspect to it.  Up next comes the fruity yeast which seems to be just a little lighter than it was in the aroma and there's also just a slight skunky flavor.  On the finish there's not bitterness with a little more sweetness taking it place with just a slight earthy hops flavors and there's some smokey and caramel malt like flavors in the aftertaste.  This was a pretty nice tasting beer, but I could go without the light skunky flavor."
"O:  infinitely drinkable at this smoothness and ABV.  Very nice brew."

"Widget can.  Pours a clear amber with a heavy dark ruby cast.  After the initial gas rush, the head is normal.  Lacing and retention are above normal. Light nose of caramel. No effervescence on the finish.  Light medium body, yet slick.  Laid back balanced flavor profile.  It begins with a light caramel sweetness that flows into a mild bitterness with a touch of smoke.  As it warms, dark fruit notes are there, but subtle.  Smooth finish with a touch of hop flavor.  A mineral like taste lingers.  A solid offering, but not in the class of Founder's Dirty Bastard."

"Dark Copper Color with substantial head due to nitro cone. Drier, malty, biscuity, subtle smokiness and light nutty flavor. Slight bite with creamy finish."
""
""
""

"12 oz bottle.  Poured in a glass.  Medium head, dissipates in a minute or two.  Dark amber color.  Smell of light flowers or herbs.  Malty taste with trace of toasted nuts.  Leaves an earthy oak aftertaste."
"Bachelor Party-Palooza 2014 (Part 1) believes that when in a Scottish-style pub, do as the Scots do and drink up some Belhaven, namely the Scottish Ale.  This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam.  The nose comprises sweet biscuit, light powdered sugar, mild grass, light flowers, toasted caramel, and hard water.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a tiny twinge of vague fruit, this time more powerful than in the Lager, but still barely there.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, a nice malty British ale, one that went pretty well with the chips."

"June 2013 - On tap. Smart balance resulting in a very enjoyable brew."
""

"Got this in a 22 bottle from the local liquor store. Clear bottle sitting on a shelf. Upon opening smell has skunky right away, this beer had gone bad from sitting too long and being exposed to too much light. The taste was no better than an average pilsner or lager. Reminded me of the skunky Hienken I use to drink thinking it was good beer. Live and learn."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/27/2013. Pours slightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, bread, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with balanced bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, light roast, herbal, grass, light pear/apple, and yeast earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, light nuttiness, light pear/apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Scottish ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"The pour is perfect, the foam is perfect, the taste is slightly creamy yet full of unique flavor that is difficult to describe. The aftertaste is clean and perfect. I am so glad they have this in the Nitro Can. Highly recommend!"
"I really love this Beer from a can. I got a Nitro keg for home and it's even better. You can down 2 pints before you even know it, it super smooth WOW Nitro is amazing . With all that being said it's an excellent beer anyway you have it, one of my top 5. Many have explained it feel and flavor already , much better than I can . If you have the chance get it on tap if not in bottles or cans it's still darn good."

"tobacco and raisins. I'm not saying that is a bad thing. The taste is sweet- but bitter. Nothing overpowering ,but it has a bitter aftertaste. This brew is something I would get again if I was having a nice dinner. I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out of 5."

"Good toasted malt backbone, excellent specialty characters of smoke. The nuttiness matches the slight sweetness well, and the finish is dry enough to be refreshing, albeit a touch too bitter for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint pilsner. A bubbly 3/4"" head quickly reduces to very nice lacing. The color is a brilliant crystal clear orange-red. I'm having a hard time describing the aroma, but it is mild, and malty. The flavor is malt, nutty, and a bit of hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is tingly with carbonation, and a little creamy, but not much. Overall this is a style I'm not familiar with, but it is at least a very good ale."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours red amber with a small white head. Smells of dark malt very inviting. Tastes of roasted malt with slight caramel, not overly sweet but still quite tasty. Beer is carbonated a tad heavily but light bodied very drinkable. Overall a very good beer."

"Belhaven Scottish Ale is a very plain but pleasant ale that I imagine would be a dream on cask. It is a lavender- and peat-accented, definitively Scottish ale that is very understated, but enjoyable. It is exactly the kind of offering (from one of the breweries) that first turned me off of commercial beer and onto better quality, more engaging craft offerings."

""
""

"Scottish ale pours a clear brown color with a big lacing head. There is a rotten and earthy aroma. The taste is earthy, with a good full malty based, lots of mellow peaty flavors. Good mellow flavors, everything blends well. Overall a very well built and complete beer."

"Belhaven is hard to beat on tap, if drinking from the bottle I have found it is best poured into a frosty pint glass. I'm sure the draught can is fantastic but I haven't been able to find it on the shelf yet. The best Scottish Ale I have tried so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An outstanding beer."
""
""
"Disappointed after drinking Belgian trappiste ales! This does not compare. Had it on tap and it seemed to taste a lot better. Was expecting better quality what a let down. I was expecting better beer after I had it on tap a few years ago. It was not bad but could be better."

"Overall Impression: A fine beer, although it seems to diverge from the Scottish Ale style. Seems to be more of a Northern English Brown to me, but a good one at that! Would have liked to have tasted more evidence of kettle caramelization, and less hop bitterness so that some of the other flavors could come out a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not a bad beer but not a particularly good one either. Some of its aspects are off the charts- appearance and mouthfeel- while the others are pretty average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer. While it's certainly malt forward, I found great balance in the flavor and mouthfeel. Wasn't too aggressive, hitting in all the right spots. Will I buy this beer again? Hell yes."

"I like a good Scottish Ale and this is in line with the model for the style."

"The beer of my house is now under the Belhaven flag. I'm a big fan of this beer and couldn't speak more highly of it. It's a sweet, smooth ale that doesn't get disgusting as you drink more of it. I would recommend this beer to anyone. It's quality through and through!"
""
"Overall: Overall a good beer. I like malty beers, but more roasted malts (i.e. in porters, stouts) than this kind of stuff. The very skunky smell originally present leads to the biggest downgrade in rating. Probably much better from a can."
""
""
"O- A pretty bland beer in my opinion. Really didn't taste like other Scottish Ales I have had, although this is the first one I have had from Scotland. I thought this beer was pretty underwhelming and reminded me of less-flavorful versions of some British bitters and ESBs that I have had."

"perhaps my favorite beer in the nitro can. this one pours the sexiest of dark copper tones, with a glorious nitro tap looking milky white froth head with damn fine retention. yummy! the nose is dry malt in the middle of the spectrum and some very simple and to the point ale yeast. some mineral aromatics too, very organic nature to this. the flavor is also decidedly malt forward, and while the finish is a tad on the bitter side, its not from hops as far as I can tell, but rather the combination of well toasted cereal grains and the nitro can, which always bitters a beer up a little on my palate, maybe just me... mouthfeel of course makes this one, with a milkshake style foaminess to it and a delicate character despite being extremely full bodied and quite rich actually. maybe three cans is the right amount of this, as any more might get filling and any less seems to not quite get to the heart of my thirst. perfectly suited to the nitro can, this is one of my favorite regular imports."
""
""
"O: This would make a good everyday drinker. It's definitely the most interesting nitro-can beer I've ever had before."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel: a soft fast gulp finish, a good beer for those who like to sip and drink at the same time, i could call this one of the most sessioned beers of the season, this is what i call a Grade B+ ale, for those who want to get into Scottish ales i have no problem recommending this to my friends and beer buddies anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. Outstanding nutty flavor that even my wife liked. The finish was clean. Aroma was inviting. I would drink this all day long. I was doing a little Ale comparison and put it up agains Mirror Pond. I enjoyed the Mirror Pond but this was superior."

"3.5/3.5/3.75/3.75/3.5"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, nuts, and a slight caramel aroma. Taste is much the same with a nice malt flavor that lingers on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Baskin Robbins 31 Flavor theory at work--no everyone has the same taste.  This is one of my ideal beers with great color, heavy malts and low hops, British pub level of sessionable ABV."

"Overall, this ale is delicious. If you are in to malty ales with a bit of smokiness you are in for a treat."
""
""
"O: While there is nothing all that stand-out about this beer, it is just a solid, very drinkable brew."
""
""
"overall, just average from the bottle. I would like to try this from a can or tap, as I imagine it is much better. I assume the bottle doesn't do it justice"

"Very easy to drink considering the giving feel and reasonable abv. Simple and enjoyable."

"taste is... awesome. i love this stuff. when england (or scotland) does it right, it is GOOD! too many funky, weird ones out there from those regions, but i really like this distinct style and blend. i cant describe it, but it is the german equivalent to the sweetness of a dopplebock yet not as sweet, but very satisfying and tasty. this ought to be the offical style of the 'little countries'...."
""
"Overall – This is the way in which this beer should be enjoyed. The “standard carbonation” really is much nicer for the blend of sweet, buttery, and roasted flavors of the brew the nitro. If you go for a Belhaven Scottish ale I say go for the non nitro. Quite nice (odd as I normally prefer the nitro driven body)."
"Overall: The character is what one would expect a scottish ale to be. It tastes of the earth and the malts that make it up. The bottle describes a mix of malt and nutty flavor. Nutty did not come to mind, but I suppose I could get there."
""
""
""

"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours from a nitro can to a full glass of foam which dissipates quickly into a glass of slighty cloudy, coppery amber beer with a fine two finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Nice aroma of caramel malt, a hint of toasted malt and toffee. Flavor follows, but much more subdued. Light caramel, sweet malt, a hint of peat, finishing with slight hops, a bit sour. The flavors are attenuated; very pleasant but too light for my taste. The ""nitro"" widget gives this light bodied beer a hint of creaminess, but also seems to sap the remaining carbonation, giving it a bit of a flat mouth feel. This is still far better than my last Belhaven Scottish Ale, which came in a clear bottle and was badly skunked. With the light flavoring, I see why that one was a complete disaster. A nice, pleasant scottish ale, but somewhat bland."
"A quality scottish ale at a lower abv. If there was more on the mid and finish I'd love it, but it's still a good drink and enjoyable."
""
"Its a bit cloudy with very good head. The aroma is the best part - sweet yet hoppy. It smells fresh. Unfortunately, the taste does not follow suit - it tastes stale and slightly sour. Although this one ale won't sour me to the style, it reminds me of why I used to dislike this style."
""
""
"overall- Belhaven Scottish Ale is a great beer I love to get it around the holidays A great staple to have when you want to have a 2 or 3 heavier beers in the winter months!"
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O this to me is just one great beer that I alwys go back to, I bring it to my co-workers when we get of work at night and it is the first gone and they all agree tht it is one great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is malty as well, with a hint of roasted nuts alongside the toffee and brown sugar notes. A zing of hops finishes the well-balanced palate. A solid and very enjoyable session ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a half finger white head. Deep copper clear body. Smells skunky with mix of carmel, yeasty bread, oak, toffee and some grassy metallic hops. Tastes like a mineraly English ale, Carmel, smokey, earthy hops, some metallic over tone. Medium thin body, light carbing. Lingering metallic bitter finish. Overall a bit too dry and some off putting metallic earthiness."

"Appearance is dark red, slight gold. Smell is uneventfull. Very effervecent, with a nice bite on the tongue. This makes a great mouthfeel. The taste has the right balance, nice IPA. Overall we find this beer to be very inviting and worth repeating. Carry on"
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is the big attraction with these nitro cans, obviously, and this one delivers the goods as well as any. Say what you want but sometimes I'm just in the mood for this kind of beer. The Belhaven is better than most, with good malt character and less of the overall blandness that plagues nitrous beers in general."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: average, I like my ales a bit heavier"
""
"Pour a tannish/medium-brown. Creamy off-white head with decent lacing. Somewhat bourbony aroma. Malty butterscotch with some fruitiness with light hops. Somewhat sweet. A little weak for my tastes. Easily drinkable, more of a session beer. I like my scottish ales a ""wee bit heavier""."
""
""
""
""
"O: I dont usually like scotch ale, this was a nicely balanced brew, nothing earth shattering but would make a good session beer. Something good to drink in october/tailgating perhaps. Would be a good beer for BMC drinker."

"Overall: A good beer for what it is, a malt forward low hopped beer. I would like a touch more complexity. I would like to see it finish a touch dryer. No flaws. Get this in the can, not the clear bottles you will enjoy it so much more."
"Overall: The rich beautiful color of this beer in the clear glass bottle was what made me try it. It was smooth, easy to drink, and left a malt aftertaste behind. A very good beer."
""
"Great beer."

""
""
"Overall this is a really enjoyable beer and quite quaffable. I would like to try it on nitro sometime."
"O: This is a nice quality beer and one of the better scottish ales I have had. I wish the smell was a little more malty, but other than the smell, it hits the spot. Just an overall good tasting and feeling beer."

"O - Only slightly reminiscent of the Scottish Ales I drank in Scotland, but nice. This would go nicely with something spicy (Indian perhaps?)."

"O - A very good beer, smooth, malty. The only turn off is the tinny flavor I got from it. I was drinking it out of a pint glass poured from a fresh bottle. I tasted it with a salty chicken stew, which was definitely not an ideal pairing for this brew."

"This is my first go with a Scottish Ale since I had Railbender a couple years back. This beer had some qualities that reminded me of a nice scotch and I found it to be a nice change up from my usual fare. At $10 a six at the World Market up in Albuquerque, I don't see Belhaven becoming a staple in my fridge, rather something I'll pick up now and again when the mood strikes for a nice session brew."

"The flavor to me is sweet with toffee and chocolate, similar to the smell I'm getting. It does have bitterness in it though, that is not to be ignored. This beer is full of flavors, I'm still trying to think of them all after finishing it. It reminds me of nuts, brown ale, toffee, dark chocolate, mild hop bitterness, caramel, and more. It's on the light end of medium bottied, which is interesting because usually a beer this flavorful is really full bodied. This increases its drinkability to a point in my opinion. Its easy for me to finish one of these, but too keep drinking them I think I'd get too overwhelmed with flavors. This was a fun beer, and I'd like to get another one sometime."
"Overall, a great session beer. It tastes delicious and goes down very smooth. I was surprised at how good this was. A six pack could go down with ease."
""
""
"O: I have no clue why this is rated so hghly when I've had Oktoberfest that have the same taste to it. The thinness is the true killer here because it feels like water and with it's taste this just isn't appealing."

"Dr: I'll have to review this from the can, because I remember being dazzled by the head. This was a huge disappointment. It's drinkable, but I'd never buy it again - at least not the bottled form."

"This is a great beer. Smooth and nutty. Truly beautiful and complex. Let her warm up a bit and she'll give you a nice little buzz as thanks. This beer won't change the world, but you will enjoy the hell out of it. Especailly in the scene where the lawyer gets eaten by the t-rex while sitting on the crapper."

"Poured on-tap and served in a 20oz vase, the beer is a deep, clear, dark auburn-copper color with a thick, solid, one inch, creamy white head. Light malt and caramel aromas, effervescent and enticing. The flavors are light on a creamy , smooth body. Malty rich caramel and slight alcohol, with a roasty undertone. Nutty and sweet malt aftertaste, with a slow, slick finish. Tasty, but gets heavy after a while of drinking."
"RJT"
"O - I love this beer. Extremely sessionable. A pleasing aroma and delicious yet mild flavours. Incredible feel and fantastic looks. Im still searching for that beautifully thick and creamy British beer that isn't quite so mild however."
"O: I was a big fan of it. I'm not sure how much it costs, but I could definitely see myself getting a six of this if I could find it for a nice Autumn day. It is one of the better fall beers that I've had."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Definitely worth giving a try on nitro."
"O: Great beer, I love Scottish Ales and this does nothing to change that."
"I probably wouldn't buy a six pack for my friends. It's pretty strong, but might be a bit much for the average drinker."
"Overall very easy to drink, but doesn't really give much in the way of taste or complexity. This tasting was also out of a bottle and not on nitro which could have something to do with the lack of taste."
"Nice beer to consume. Not the bomb - but also not disappointing."
"Definitely worth a try."
"D: Quite nice to drink, and with the lower ABV I would defiantly enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer is a creamy, drinkable, and enjoyable. The body is neither too thick nor too light, allowing the beer to coat your mouth well without become sticky. The carbonation is almost undetectable but is definitely doing more than its fair share for this beer."
"O- A pretty good beer, does very well with nitro. The malt flavors are very tasty and inviting."
"O - this malty scottish ale is easy to recommend. Much better than the more popular and available nitro-can from Boddingtons. Allowed to warm a bit before serving but still improved with further warming."
"Not the finest Scottish ale but certainly a nice one. Easy to drink and unique enough to want another."
"Mouthfeel - rich full mouth feel, feels good"
"Overall, this is a decent brew, though no doubt some will be turned off by the smoky, peaty malts and wish for a sweeter beverage."
"Mothfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Great for the style; the nitro can really improves this in my opinion as I have had this out of the bottle in the past and did not enjoy it or find it as memorable. Overall this is a great session ale for anytime of the year but probably best around the fall time when I enjoy my brown ales the most. Hop of the heap for the style and doesn't go overboard in any category while still being extremely flavorable and drinkable."
"The beer is pretty light-bodied and seems a bit thin. An easily drinkable beer but a little light in flavor for my palate. Still, it's a nice representation of the style."
"O- Very good beer, the head stuck around th whole time, and left exceptional lacing."
"T: roast, some caramel at the beggining and sweet malt, low bitterness, chewy, dry finish"
"A Scottish ale with a nice fruity presence. Well balanced with a nice array of flavors. Has a slight metallic presence but not bad."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Great drinkability. I can see having more than a few of these."
"From Scotland’s oldest brewery (since 1719) that is still in operation today, this is one heck of an enjoyable ale!! This ale sports a deep, dark walnut color and a somewhat thick (slightly heavy) rich malty, nutty flavor. Depending on how you pour it, the head can froth up from 1 finger to 3 fingers and stick with you through the entire drink! The warm fermentation process yields very subtle fruity flavors that are in no way overbearing but rather just a slight aftertaste that coincides with its very smooth and creamy finish. Enjoy some today!!"
"Smooth aftertaste, low ABV make this a perfect session beer."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly, leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grainy malty nose and flavor is smooth malt and light caramel. $3.50 for a 500ml bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"This beer was just good. Well balance I thought with nothing really competing against each other. Highly drinkable too... it's a shame I only have one of these."
"D - Easy to drink, not tiring and low ABV."
"Overall this is a very good beer that drinks well, with a low ABV. Could have several of these and be okay. I will definately return to this one as the summer progresses."
"nice malt mixture, a bit more caramelization and smokiness. great mouthfeel, almost fluffy. eminently drinkable, and will gladly grab again."
"Overall this is a pretty average thirst quencher. Not bad for a session beer on a warm day."
"I admit, something in that limey water brings me back to my poverty-stricken days in Camden Town. Nights of warm pints in old bars, bowls of olives and stale bread. It’s comforting, but at the same time it urges me forward. Time to forget, or at the very least, reassess."
"Overall (whatever happened to drinkability?), this is a very drinkable beer--both for parties and dinners..."
"D - This beer was made for a nitro-tap... It adds so much to this otherwise slightly above average brew... Insanely quaffable... I could drink this all night long... The ABV of just above 5% also aids to the drinkability..."
"This beer pours out as a golden color with really nice nitro charged head on it. The lacing is quite good on this beer. The smell is a bit mild, smells fresh and kind of creamy there are some grains on the nose that are pleasant. The taste is light but had a pretty good malt base with a pretty good bitter finish. The mouthfeel was creamy and light. Definitely a nice brew to try."
"O: Tried this one after repeated recommendations from a friend and I can see what he is raving about after all this time. Certainly not my most favorite beer, but this is definitely on the buy again list."
"Overall I'm not that impressed, but it was drinkable."
"This is a beer for an entire night, or maybe with dinner. It is not a treat, as it is pretty simple, and not too flavorful."
"Overall, this is a very good brew. Great as an after dinner drink."
"Overall, I'm a fan, refreshing yet creamy, light in flavor but a great beer for me and summer time in texas"
"Overall / drinkability: This is now 2 for 2 in the past 3 months that I have been unable to get a good bottle of this beer that I had many years ago and loved. Either this stuff does not keep fresh or the clear glass is ruining it. I suspect it's the clear glass is ruining the beer in the store while it sits on the shelf. If I can find a bottle I know is really really fresh I'll buy it again and review again, but otherwise I think I'm going to skip this one."
"I recommend it. Great Scotch ale example."
"Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, with low carbonation, a buttery and almost velvety feel on the tongue and a light to medium body. If you like malty beers then this is a highly drinkable brew; I enjoyed it and could make it a session beer if I was in the malt for a malt dominant beer with just the right amount of sweetness."
"An excellent Scottish Ale, and one of my all time favorites (even though I tend to like heavy beers like Russian Imperials and the like). Goes excellent with Junmai (dry) sake."
"O: This was a unique beer, to say the least. There are a lot of ales out there, and I'm always up to trying new things. I regret to say, though, that I won't be having this again. I'll still be keeping my eye out for more Scottish imports in the future - I'm always in the market for redemption."
"The mouthfeel is a bit weak, but over all it is quite nice."
"CONCLUSION: I was expecting something rich and sweet so I was quite disappointed with this one. I'm not sure if this is how a ""Scottish ale"" should taste so I can't rate it too low, but I can say that I really didn't like this. After the initial disappointment I tried to take it for what it is, but just couldn't get into it. This one was a waste of $3.79. Bleh."
"Flavor is very full, nutty with an almost toasty aftertaste. Very impressed, definitely will buy again."
"Pours a half finger white head. Deep copper clear body. Smells Carmel, yeasty bread, oak, toffee and some grassy metallic hops. Tastes like a mineraly English ale, Carmel, smokey, earthy hops, some metallic over tone. Medium thin body, light carbing. Lingering metallic bitter finish. Overall a bit too dry and some off putting metallic earthiness."
"Overall: Despite the odd smell, this is great everyday Scottish Ale. Would love to have it cask conditioned in the Old Town section of Edinburgh. Mmm."
"O - A great beer, I really enjoyed it. I could session this one."
"Overall - I'd drink this in Scotland to try it fresh. I probably won't buy it again over here in the states."
"O: Very solid beer. It's part of my regulars."
"The aroma is subtle. Toffee and caramel with a nice presence of peated malt come out in great balance. The taste is similar, with a malty sweetness that comes through in the finish. Smooth and silky on the palate, this beer is very well done and flavorful, especially given the relatively low alcohol level as compared to other versions of the style that I have been able to enjoy. For such a widely distributed and affordable beer, I am not sure you can do much better in terms of a Scottish Ale."
"O- I like this brew and find it very easy to drink."
"O- Nice example of the style, definitely a quaffable beer that can pair with any meal well."
"O - a good beer that I just don't think I am fond of, could have another but won't 3.0"
"Notes: Nitro was nice and helped, but this is another slightly lackluster import from the UK. Some English hop/malt characteristics but doesn't deliver fully. Decent, but nowhere near the top beers you can get from the UK (I know pretty much described most UK imports)."
"O: this is a goto when all else fails me, somewhat of a comfort brew, why im not sure."
"I can't believe some people consider this to be the flagship for the style."
"O: Not enthused with this one. Would be interested in another sample - maybe the can version."
"D: At 5.2% abv. this is definitely an easily drinkable beer, but with what I see as inconsistancies in the taste I am going to look elsewhere next time."
"Pretty decent and drinkable ale. Would be easy to session. Nothing special but above average."
"Taste is the same, malty, roasted sweetness and a lush, creamy, smooth mouthfeel. I like malty beers so I'm really liking this, I think I may need another."
"Well I didn't expect much out of this clear bottled brew, but I quickly changed my mind after the pour. This has excellent sweet malt flavor and combination of the carbonation and hops add perfect balance. Delicious Scottish Ale!"
"This is my favorite. I've had maybe a few beers that were better (but it certainly stands amongst the best), however Belhaven Scottish is my definite top choice."
"Certainly going to go back and try this from the bottle and also from one of them fancy nitro cans. Recommended!"
"This was quite a nice pint. Poured a 1"" head of the finest most silky kind. Hazy brownish color, almost a malted milk. Smell of sweet malt. Taste is mild and easy drinking, a little sweet, with the slightest hints of the start of stout flavors like chocolate and coffee. My drinking companion for the night was also happily pleased. Good product."
"D: Excellent in my opinion. The last tastes the same as the first. You could simply be testing this beer or you could be going for a marathon, it simply doesn't matter; you will like this beer."
"D - You could drink plenty of this if you like, The problem I would have is that I just am not very impressed by this beer"
"D- This beer was interesting. ABV was low enough to drink but...the metallic off flavors really limited the beer overall. I would like to try this one again with maybe a fresh bottle. Oh well..."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2001): Clear, copper colour with a quickly diminishing beige frothy head. Sweet toast-malty aroma with butter, caramel and lemon-fruity hops. Sweet-bitter flavour, light bodied, slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Initially toasty malty with notes of butterscotch; moderately dry and fruity finish with a pleasant and quite rounded bitterness."
"Drinkability: Reminds me of cream soda, so yes i would like another."
"Poured from a can into a mug. Nitro is great. Wonderful creamy head. Not much smell. Kind of citrusy. Nice malty taste. Medium mouthfeel with light carbonation. Light hoppy finish. Very nice heavy. I love the nitro. Very easy to drink. Definatley a good session beer."
"A nice, easy to drink malty ale with nice yeast character."
"Drinkability -- Overall, pretty good. Well-balanced and quite drinkable. I wouldn't go far to say that it is near the pinnacle of its style, but if you're in the mood for a nitro-can - y'know, for kicks - there are few, if any, better options than this."
"Nutty and caramel combines for a sweet pecan pie like aroma. Mild spice. Taste is similarly nutty and caramel apple cider. Mouthfeel is nitro creamy."
"D: This is incredibly boring. At least it beats BMC."
"Nothing comes on strong in this beer except the drinkability - it's sweet, tasty, smooth, and lightly creamy. It's very easy to have 3 or 4 of these down before you realize it. Although a bit pricey, I'll keep drinking this one as long as there is some in the freezer case."
"D- Lighter than their Wee Heavy, but an easy drinking beer. Simple and enjoyable."
"D: Amazing. Very smooth,e asy beer to drink. I would gladly choose this at any bar or pick it up in any store."
"A Scottish staple at all bars this beer is really nothing special. It is in he same field as McEwans, Tennants, Carlsberg and the like. Some people rave about it, and while the mouthfeel of this beer is akin to sex, the taste is nothing special and the overall experience is generally lacking."
"D: Excellent drinker. Definitely would like to have this on tap to experience the real character of this beer."
"D_Super easy drinking delicious Scottish ale."
"This was a favorite among several people at the tasting, likely due to the crisp flavors and clean finish that added to its drinkability. A very approachable Scottish Ale."
"Given a low ABV, smoothness, and ease with which it goes down, this is as drinkable as it gets."
"Highly drinkable; I'd like to try this beer on nitro-tap, which would probably be better than the bottled version. This is one of the better import ales I've had, it's worth a try."
"Very crisp, clean all around. Perfect blend o' malts, some spice and grains. One of my all-time favorites it makes the year round rotation. Always sure to have a few on hand."
"Very drinkable, if not that exciting beer. I'd have liked the flavors to come out more, as it seems thin to me. What's there, however, is pretty tasty."
"drinkability - this is a decent beverage, but considering the price ($9.99/4pk) I might be hesitant to drink this again in favor of more appealing choices in this style"
"NICE, RATHER ENJOYABLE!"
"Completely drinkable."
"D - Not a terrible brew, tasty but not something that will slap you across your face and get your attention. I would drink it again but won't go out of my way to buy it."
"The mouthfeel is probably my favorite thing about Belhaven Scottish. I know I'm overusing ""thick"" here, but it's a thick beer and it coats your tongue in a good way."
"Poured this guy into a pint glass. The body is a transparent mahogany brown with a finger of thick snow cap white head that doesn't reduce at all. Looks real sharp if I may say so. Slightly sour in the nose with rum and butterscotch aroma. The blend kind of reminds me of cough syrup, but the really sweet kind you give to kids. Cherries and bready malts round out the aroma. The taste is overall pretty bland. Similar to the aroma but pretty toned down. Rum soaked cherries and bready malts take the stage on the pallet. Not bad, but I wish it was a bit more. The mouthfeel is what you would expect from a nitro can. Creamy, low carbonation and kind of light bodied. Solid brew here, I'd be interested to try it from another serving type."
"Note; Maybe it's just me but I love how the clear bottle and off white label work with the color of this beer. It remains me of scotch whiskey, credit to the brewer for that!"
"Tried some of this one last night at Fresh Craft, and was thoroughly unimpressed. Poured a clear copper color, with a decent white head on top. Aromas of toffee, nuts and sweet malt. On the palate, this one was thin and watery, and really lacking in any distinctive flavor. The ABV listed on the menu was 3.9%, so I am left wondering if the draft version is watered down for the Guinness crowd. Not good."
"Belhaven Scottish Ale has an amber colour with a decent head and lacing. The smell is sweet and malty with some hints of honey. The taste is similarly malty and I tasted the same hints of honey. It has a nice toasty finish too. This beer is well carbonated and foamy, so it feels quite thick in your mouth."
"D - Decent ale, but missing good, pronounced caramels to balance the toasted malts. I look for Scotch ales that are better defined - this one's too subtle and light. Easy to drink more than one if this is a style/taste you like."
"Drink well my friends."
"D- flavorful and not too potent, for me it's the earthy hop bitternes that makes this one thirst queching and entirely drinkable. it's an understated bitterness and it's totally mild but does alot to tame the caramelized malt flavors. as stated above, i enjoy this version much more than the nitro can i had, mainly because the flavors and aroma are much more pronounced."
"Overall a pleasing beer, but is different from type for your typical ale."
"D - I think this is a nice beer to sit back and have a few or more with some pub grub. It's such an easy drinking brew one can easily get carried away on a six pack of it. Not bad and worth a try if your into the style. Cheers!"
"Great beer, tasty and very session-able. I would not mind trying this on tap over some pub grub."
"Taste is incredibly fruity as well, everything from green apples to rum soaked raisins to mangoes. Yeasty bread dough and a touch of darkly sweet caramelized malts. It's ok, but a little too fruity for me and I am not a big fan of what the nitrogen does for it, seems to emphasize the fruit and take the rich malts to the back."
"""Jeff Spicoli"""
"D - A solid ale with full flavor and nice drinkability. The beer itself is not too heavy, but the fairly strong malt character may not appeal to some."
"D - nice beer. low in alcohol make it very easy to consume, the aroma and mouthfeel are some really strong positives for this one. good choice on a cool fall evening such as this one."
"Pours a moderately light toffee color with an off white head. Tiny bits of lacing. Nose brings forward toffee and caramel with a bit of butterscotch. Taste is overwhelmed by butterscotch and toffee without any particular amount of sweetness. I am not actually sure whether this was any amount of diacetyl, as it was not off putting in that particular manner and did not have the off buttered popcorn-type flavor. It might just be that this particular version of the style really does not suit me. Feel is light with fairly low carbonation. I just couldn't get past the taste on this."
"Very smooth and drinkable beer. There is great lacing on the glass and a nice, foamy head that lasts until the last sip. The nitro helps the beer remain smooth until the end even as it wars up a bit. This beer can also be enjoyed as a session beer with its somewhat low ABV and great mouthfeel."
"D: This was an extremely easy drinking beer. However, the lingering hop bitterness made me want to switch things up after a couple pints...then go back for more!"
"I have to admit I had low expectations for this brew. However, I may have found a new favorite style! GO SCOTTISH ALES!"
"Drinkability- its easy to drink but not in a good way seems almost overly simply, tastes almost very macro american simple to me with not all that much flavor and not very much complexity, its not bad in anyone one way and certianly easy drinking but just not something you would ever be searching out for, just to bland,"
"D-This was decent, but not something I will seek again, since there are so many other styles and beers I like better."
"A clear copper in appearance with a super creamy tan head. Smell is of toffee. Taste is buttery sweet up front, with a toasty grain middle, and a dry earthy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is weak, terrible nitro instead of carbonation. Drinkability is decent, the nitro really doesn't do this beer justice. I think it would be a lot better with co2."
"crispy yet smooth going down...This beer could get me in trouble...I could drink it with every meal...and replace water with it in my diet...but I'm pretty sure that would end badly. must learn to limit the fantastical goodness."
"Next up on my exloration of the British Isles is Belhaven Scottish Ale. Paid $9.99 for a four pack of nitro cans so I'm hoping that I get my monies worth. Beautiful golden amber with a lush creamy head. Nutty caramelish taste with a somewhat smokey finish. Well rounded and balanced. I can't see ponying up $10 on a regular basis for 4 of these but I think I can see myself getting them every now and then."
"Drinkability: Truly an impressive beer. The inviting nose carries through to the taste, and does not disappoint."
"Light to medium bodied with high carbonation. I would like this better with a little less carbonation. A decent to good beer, which I would not mind having again some day."
"D: A great session option for the night at the pub. The tame ABV and clean, smooth consistency of malt flavors make it a reliable option. Won;t wow you with flavors, but its as steadfast a UK option as they come."
"Drinkability - This is a wonderful beer. This beer reminds me of the fall season. I will definitely give this a second go round. Not too heavy and would go well on those crisp, cool Fall evenings."
"Conclusion: Nice Scottish Ale; my only complaint is that it's almost a bit too buttery and a tad sweet."
"Drinkability: The caramel flavor, nitro creaminess, and light body make for a very interesting session beer."
"D: Very drinkable and enjoyable. I haven't had many scottish ales, but this one definitely makes me want to try more!"
"= not especially exciting, but a solid beer nonetheless. something my BMC drinking friends and i can both enjoy."
"Mouth feel: A cunning combination of creamy and crisp. Smooth beer, with a carnival of different flavors."
"Overall this one was okay. It started off really well, but towards the end the beer started to break down a little. A little to mellow for my taste, but otherwise a solid beer. I would not mind having this one again - it was enjoyable."
"My first Scottish Ale, good stuff, shame it's $12 a sixer, but still worth checking out."
"D- a fine example of the type, it's really good but I know better ones so I'd buy it in a pinch."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. Belhaven Scottish Ale looks good, smells good, tastes good, and feels good enough to drink all night. Not much else needs to be said except ""Lang may yer lum reek!"" (which is apparently a Scottish phrase wishing prosperity and long life; I think it literally translates to ""long may your chimney smoke)."
"overall - not sure I'd want to drink this very often. The pepper flavor is interesting, but a little off putting."
"Drinkability: Seeing as the brewery dates back to 1719, i can see why they've had lasting power. Very good traditional taste. Would come back to this one again."
"D: I was somewhat disappointed by this brew. I look forward to trying it on tap, though."
"A bit of a Caramel aroma. Light and creamy body. Sweet malts to start. Hints of caramel and fruit deep in the beer as well. Also a bit of scotch flavor in there. Ends a with a little dryness and hoppy aftertaste. Pretty standard European-style/Scottish Ale"
"Being of Scottish decent, I had to try this one and I really enjoyed it. I have a knack for Scottish Ales and if you like them too, give this one a shot because you won't be disappointed."
"Very drinkable, could have some nice sessions with this brew."
"I really wanted to like this beer. It looked and smelled great but the taste thinned out way too much to make it really flavorful. Not bad, just not anything special."
"A bar standard, easy drinking and tasty, I tend to overlook it on a stacked list but it hasn't let me down yet."
"the first smell was very nice - yes we have malts here.. yes sweet yes caramel almost like a brown ale.. the flavor is pretty straight forward and tasty but with enough complexity to keep things interesting.. mostly malts a little floral hops - pretty much what i was expecting from a beer from the isles.. this is highly drinkable with a slightly thin but pleasant mouthfeel.. it has a nice lingering sweet finnish.. overall, a nice surprise."
"D: Could session this one easily at ~5% ABV. Definitely want to try others of the style."
"Comes out of the bottle a nice translucent dark amber with a fairly thick whitish head. Aroma is fairly strong and malty with a fruity hint. Flavor is malty and refreshing, a good accompaniment to a meal. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy, leaving behind a nice tingly finish."
"Light in body, soft carbonation, an easy drinker for sure. Nothing about it particularly screams ""scottish!"" to me, but that's hardly a measure of the beer's worth. I'll have it again...and in fact, right now."
" This one is a great brew all-around, easy drinking, full of flavor and I love hearty brews. Classic."
"Overall, very good beer in my opinion. Its not challenging or complex, just an easy drinking ale. I get this every time its available at Finnegan's Wake."
"A lovely malty beer that would surely be better still on cask."
"Drinkability: while I'm not a big fan of such a heavy hand with the biscuit malt, I am finding this to be a highly quaffable and refreshing beverage. I would have this again."
"D-This is one of those styles that always seems to underwhelm a bit, but I ultimately enjoy them. This is very similar to the other scottish ales I've had in terms of taste and mouthfeel and probably the model on which others are built."
"The tasting notes: Pours a hazy amber brown, there are visual yeasty floaties rising and falling, there is decent carbonation but not much of a head which recedes to leave some lacing behind. The nose is a malty/nutty aroma. Flavor/mouth nutty, very creamy, it starts out sour upfront, then is turns smooth and about two seconds later the bitterness hits you. This beer is sessionable with an ABV of 5.2%. It's a good beer and i want another to bad i only bought one when i was mixing ang matching a six pack."
"Kind of a weak profile for the style. Minimal smoke or thickness. No alcohol feel to it, which is a plus I guess. Its really, uh, boring? I wouldn't call it sessionable, because it just doesn't resonate with me, the malt, hopping, just don't feel up to par. And expensive to boot? Pass."
"D- Super drinkable. This beer is a true classic."
"D: This beer is easy to drink and quite sessionable."
"This is a delicious and refreshing ale."
"I could definitely drink this, but i don't think it's anything special by any means, really ordinary. though it might be pretty good for scotland."
"Overall: The initial appearance raises expectations, as does the feel. Ultimately, this beer does not live up to those expectations, preventing a high A grade."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. A massive nitro-induced 5 fingers of head. Smells of oak, sweet malt, and typical nitro can. Lightly sweet malt, typical of a Scottish Ale. Very very smooth. Prefer the bottle to the can, but quite good. Goes down like butta. Very flat on the mouthfeel."
"Overall- Decent satisfying beer although not one of my favorite Scotch ales"
"The appearance is hazy amber with a medium head. The aroma is malty with caramel, toffee, and a strange earthiness. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is average for the style. Overall this is a pretty good beer but not something great or remarkable."
"good beer. really enjoyed it. sweet and thick Scottish Ale that had a good flavor considering the lower abv"
"A little too bland to desire another pint, but this one went down easily."
"D-this is some easy drinking and offers up a great balance with a solid hop profile. the nitro really gives it a great feel on the palate and this is so enjoyable."
"A nicely done Scottish Ale. It's one of the only examples available to me on a regular basis, but it's not one I go to very often at the price ($2.35 for a single 12oz bottle)."
"Extremely drinkable - I downed the whole can's worth in about 10 minutes without even thinking about it. This is really great, definitely one I'll revisit. An ideal session beer, in any sense of the term."
"After pouring, it had a nice wheat colored head, thick, foamy and stuck around til the end. The color was a dark amber with mahogany highlights. Smell was mostly wheat with hints of hops, barley and a flowery note. The taste was bitter hops with barley and wheat overtones and subtle hints of citris and nuts. Mouthfeel - medium-bodied. Drinkability - has a good balance of flavor with a more bitter overtone. Not bad."
"D: A-one laddy, Drink away boys! Drink Away!"
"Overall: A great Scottish ale, and my favorite of the few examples I have tried."
"It's average. Not a favorite of mine. I do recall that it is slightly better on tap."
"The drink is a guzzler waiting to happen"
"I appreciate this more subtly flavored Scotch Ale and would be content drinking it throughout an evening. Consider it as an alternative to hoppier pale ales for a round."
"Overall Impression: Scottish ale is quite possibly the best style for most Newbeez, due to the lack of hop flavor that they typically confuse with bitterness. Add to that the rich malty flavor and the creaminess that nitro-cans offer, and this is a slam-dunk winner!!!"
"This authentic Scottish Ale from Belhaven pours a nice deep copper color with a thin creamy and off-white head. The nose gives off a slightly sweet malty, bready and nutty aroma. As you sip it the nitrogen pour makes it feel nice and creamy on the palate with a medium body. The aroma follows through pretty well on the palate, but doesn't quite blow you away with it's toasty malt, slight breadiness, and a roasted, nutty and smokey flavors with hints of caramel. A smooth creamy malt finish, and a nice sessionable 3.9 % abv."
"D - This beer is delicious. Since the beer finishes so smoothly, I could definitely session with this."
"Drinkability: can drink a couple in a sitting due to great mouthfeel and nice sweetness and alcohol is subtle"
"The brew is a little thin and leaves a pastiness in the back of the throat that I didn't care for. It was drinkable enough and refreshing, but overall I'd look elsewhere for an indoor quaffer."
"Fun beer to drink with friends or when out and could pretty much be consumed with any occasion or meal."
"D: This is a great session beer, really good malt-oriented flavours. Shows why Belhaven is one of the best out there."
"Easy drinking brew."
"D- Can I get another, low abv and a nitro tap makes barry a happy boy."
"Thoughts- Ok this beer has the taste you want, but is light enough where you can still walk a straight line after you're done. I would like to belly up to this brew with some nice smoked venison."
"Drinkability: From the looks it appears heavy and thick, but well balanced is too passive a term. It's smooth and creamy. A really great drinking experience."
"Drinkable, yes, but more like a session beer."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The beer all things considered is quite sessionable. The ABV is easily managed and the flavor profile is pleasing enough to have a few. It's not the worlds greatest beer but it's solid enough to enjoy."
"Poured into an American pint glass; copper amber with a very thin head, and modest lacing. Smelled of spiked iced tea, apple, and pear, while the flavor was a more robust representation of the same aroma mix, plus a vanilla oak kick. Medium-bodied and super-smooth, with very little carbonation. Excellent session beer, but tastes more like a bitter rather than a scotch ale."
"Served in a nonic. Poured with the classic nitro cascade, eventually settling into a hazy liquid the color of iced tea with a one inch, creamy and bright white head with excellent retention. Thick, creamy sheets of lacing revealed during the session. Nose was somewhat subdued - malty and a little pruney. Taste consistent with nose - no surprises. Mouthfeel was light-medium (but closer to the light side of the spectrum) and creamy. Easy drinking, not much complexity, but a fairly flavorful and light offering."
"D: one great brew with a ton of flavor for what it is. Worth a shot."
"Overall : Generally, this is a really great beer. At its worst though, it is still drinkable and would satisfy the less discriminating imbiber without comment. If you're going to have this one on draft, you may want to ask for a sample first, it is liable to be a bit variable"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. I can see myself slowly sipping this and/or having a couple of these in a sitting."
"This is an OK Scottish Ale, but doesn't have that strong and pleasant ""Scotch"" taste that the McEwan's had."
"Belhaven's scottish ale is rather enjoyable, it has a decent light amber color and a smooth taste, it is easy to drink quickly, but I find other scotch ales more enjoyable. It doesn't offer that robust flavor that I have come to expect form Scottish brews. Overall not a bad beer."
"had many times but have found that its tastes best in a slightly expired nitro can. pour is like eye candy from a nitro. head is quite thick and nice with lace and thick foam. palate is not as bitter as on tap. mellowed out... nose of honey sweet malt and pollen. a mild apple sour in this case. palate is creamy and wonderful. great malt but not overly sweet. some breadiness like challah bread. honey and pollen with a mild hop citrus lemon at the end... not sharp. mild and corresponding to the malt character. a fruit of apple pie. nutmeg and cinnamon quality."
"Although lighter and thinner than the Scotch Ale I was expecting, this ale has turned out to be something I really enjoy. It's a drinker, not a sipper. And while I usually trend towards darker, thicker brews, this has definitely become one of my favorites."
"Greatly drinkable. I would like to find it on tap, though."
"I have to do this by memory because I had this On Tap at upick6 in Erie PA, but I made sure to remember. Beautiful pour with the nitro tap, Creamy,Malty, caramel note. Flavor stays with you for awhile, chewy....I can keep going, so I bought another. This is a classic Scottish, maybe a little less punch, but stellar non the less."
"D: Very smooth, easy to drink, nothing all that special"
"Easy to drink, but on this spectrum (which I assume goes from too easy to be quality --- too difficult to enjoy) I would but it a little on the too easy side."
"D- Anytime of day... every day... I could never get tired of this beer. One of god's gifts to mankind. Nothing extreme, but the best beer is best left simple"
"This is, without a doubt, my new favorite beer. I am thrilled that the barmaid in Mass. talked me into trying it. Now that I've found it in my hometown, it will be a staple. I can't wait to try a Wee Heavy to see how it compares."
"Drinkability: This is a nicely made, balanced ale that is a clear candidate for an evening of drinking and conversation with friends. It is good but not particularly challenging. It is enjoyable but not particularly complex. Just the thing to suit my tastes if I've got some things to do but want something to sip on while doing it. I'll certainly be having this one in again someday."
"Notes: Uff, it had been a while (years in fact) since I had a nitro pour, and this is sort of reminding me why that was the case. Now, it is not a pain to drink, and against other choices I may pick it up gladly, but as of today I think those occasions will be few and far between."
"I forgot how enjoyable a Bellhaven can be."
"I usually don't dig on nitro, but this is one beer that has been rendered flavorless (at least at serving temperature) by the gas."
"Very drinkable. I could sit down with this one all night for sure."
"Bellhaven poured a nice cloudy caramel color with a nice tan head. The smell was of caramel, sweet, hints of some lightly roasted malt. The taste was full sweet caramel. Mouthfeel was a little sticky. Drinkability was good. Overall a nice beer with good flavors."
"Mouthfeel isn't that great either but drinkability is pretty high. Much better experience poured from a regular bottle."
"D: Balanced, extremely drinkable and enjoyable beer. Not the most complex Scottish Ale but is my standard to which I compare all others in this style."
"Verdict: Straightforward, yet tasty, and nicely sessionable, Belhaven is a great example of the lower-alcohol style of Scottish Ale. If you're a fan of nitro creaminess and you're looking for a new quaffable new brew, this is a great choice."
"D: I think overall I'd say I like this beer, a lot going for it if you know where to look. Wouldn't have guessed it weighing in at 5+% either as it drinks quite faster than that. Would be interesting to see how it compares to a bottle or draft."
"Poured from a 14.9 oz. nitro can. Has a cloudy brown color with a slowly fading 1 inch head. Some yeast and hops detected, not a strong aroma. Taste is very mild, not a lot of flavor. Feels creamy in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good selection."
"Surprisingly strong chocolate notes from this dark, Scottish ale. The huge mouth feel actually finishes very smooth. A strong ale to be savored, it was both the perfect accompaniment for and participant in (I used it in the marinade) my grilled shrimp."
"The taste is toasty grain with hints of chocolate, nuttiness, earthy leaves, caramel, and a little prune. It has light sweetness with the nutty-leafy-chocolatey bitterness just barely dominating through the finish, after which a light sweet caramelly maltiness lingers. It retains a nice, firm body uinderneath the creamy head and does not become so watery like many nitro beers can be."
"overall the bottle version owns the nitro can(which i will never buy again)"
"-Bye"
"I absolutely love the taste of this beer - lightly malted but with a clear melon or cantaloupe component. You could drink this all day, and I frequently do. The nitro gives this a full body that's easy on the tongue. Reach for this one when you just want ""a beer."" It won't steer you wrong."
"Drinkability is high. Easy to finish, you can have a few of these with cloying. Flavor is great."
"Drinkability: Goes down very easy. Not sure if I'd try this one again since I'm a hop-head, but a great example of a beer that puts malt flavor at the forefront."
"Not my personal favorite, but I'm coming off an ESB and a 4-month tasting hiatus. I'll try this one again."
"D - Nothing too exciting or bad about this beer its just a good easy to drink beer thats worth trying sometime"
"After pouring, this beer it produced a light-tan layer of foam, which was about two fingers thick. Next, a nice layer of lace stuck to the mug. This brew has a rich amber color; plus, this beer is quite clear. The hops are very light to the nose, but this beer has some nice fruit-like esters (perhaps apples). In addition, to the esters, the malt aromas are very noticeable. The malt really comes out in the flavor, which is a strong point of this beer. Likewise, the hops come out in the flavor. Overall, this beer does an excellent job of represneting this style."
"Very crafted beer, can't wait for the next one."
"Drinkability is good. All in all, a tasty session brew. I'd happily have another."
"D: quite good, I just think there are better beers out there"
"This is a solid simple beer and a step up from Boddingtons and other ""pub"" nitro can beers like it. Not going to blow your socks off but you sure can drink it, and it's characterful enough to be a go-to brew. I'll certainly have it again."
"A better than expected Scottish ale. This beer pours a medium amber with a cascading head from the nitro widget. I like the look, but that's probably just because of some remaining Guinness love/brainwashing. The aroma is sweet and mild for a Scottish ale. The flavor has a good balance of pleasant hops, doughy malt and caramelization. I enjoy it, but I'm not a huge fan of Scottish ales, so take that for what you will. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Drinkability is quite good for my tastes because it's not as sweet as many other Scottish ales."
"This brew is very drinkable and a nice crowd pleaser. This brew may even be good (and surprise) some non beer lovers. Good stuff."
"D: A very nice scotch ale, I could easily see myself picking up a case of this and thoroughly enjoying until the end..."
"D..Easy to drink after the first one or two bitter sips pass. Goes down smooth. Went well with a pub sandwich and mashed for lunch. Could be a good session beer, especially since the abv is not too high."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber/brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention is OK, lacing is good. It smells like toasted malt, nuts, and a bit of caramel. The taste is the same as the aroma, however the taste is stronger than the aroma would indicate. There aren't any hops that I can notice in either the taste or the aroma, but in this case that isn't a bad thing. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and very easy to drink. I could easily have this as an occasional session beer. If you like malt and Scottish Ales, then you would probably like this beer. I think it's a good, solid brew."
"An enjoyable ale, a must for malt heads."
"Have about two in a row and you'll feel a little full. Makes me want some BBQ."
"A bit simple for my taste. Clearly a bit past its prime, too bad--I'll keep an eye out for another."
"D - This was a good beer, probably better if I could get it in a six pack, but overall a decent flavorful beer"
"A very pleasant and enjoyable brew, worth seeking out."
"Pours a very cloudy mahogany light brown color, huge head to it with tons of lacing. Mouthfeel is pretty good, body a bit on the thin side, but wicked smooth. A nice malty taste here with a bit of the smokiness/nuttiness to it typical of the style. While not as over the top as Old Chub (which is an amazing beer), this seems like the baseline of Scottish ales. Won't blow you away with flavor but its beautiful in the glass and incredibly smooth.. glad I got to try it."
"D: A very nice Scottish ale and quite sessionable. Easy to drink and not overly complex."
"This beer poured a dark amber with a single-finger beige head. The smell is almost all malt with a bit of toasted nuttiness. The taste starts off with toasted malt that gives way to a bit of hops to balance everything out. The mouthfeel was slightly thick with moderate carbonation and it was a very drinkable beer."
"A solid beer overall, but nothing extra ordinary"
"Pours a clear amber color with a thich white head. Good lacing down the glass. A sweet, almost fruity aroma mixed with some earthy hop and toffee malt aromas. The taste is sweet fruity caramel malt with a slight bitterness in the finish. The is also a slight smokiness in the finish. The earthy hops come up front in the finish but don't overload the beer with bitterness. A very well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good, definitely can have a few of these."
"Overall very mild but still very well done and enjoyable. It's important first time drinkers of this one don't confuse this ""Scottish Ale"" with a ""Scotch Ale"" aka Wee Heavy as the unmet expectations will make it harder to enjoy. This one is all about balance and subtlety."
"I give this beer an overwhelming ""eh"" grade - just not sure anything about this beer is exceptional."
"Drinkability: Good, but not great Scottish Ale."
"Overall: I loved the balance between the big malt and the earthy hops, it makes me want to put on a kilt and throw a big tree around. A fine Scottish Ale lads!"
"has a great bottle, it pours mighty fine in a glass just listen to the beer pouring into the glass , its telling you im a great beer , if your trying a scottish ale for the frist time ,then this is the one to taste, good beer good taste a good night"
"Had this at the Houston Flying Saucer. Poured in a pint glass with a nice ruby red color and a wonderful creamy head. Nutty with a cocoa powder aroma. Light to medium in carbonation with a very creamy mouthfeel. Tastes of figs, raisin and some prunes. Finishes quite smooth. I used to like this beer more a few years back. Still like it but not as much as before. Still not a bad beer. I dont like beers with nutty tastes too much though."
"D: Very easy to enjoy and drink... Goes down very easy and many could be had.... I'll be looking for this brew for home use."
"Overall there's nothing that really stands out about this beer, but it is very drinkable. Worth a shot."
"D - Drinkable, yes. I prefer to have several others but this would do, and I'd like to try it on tap."
"Very drinkable, a solid choice to session as a good buddy has suggested!"
"D - With the 5.3% alcohol content, you could really make this a session beer."
"This is quickly becoming one of my favorites! It has lovely color in the glass (mid-deep, copper color), but the taste is what hooks me. Sweet caramel goodness with great mouth feel. A beer that can accompany stew or be drank as a refreshing end of the day-er!"
"D - I great session beer."
"Drinkability- Medium Bodied and carbonated"
"Overall: An extremely easy drinking beer even with the amount of malt up front. Very sessionale."
"I can't help it but I love those nitro-cans. Some people think its gives a false impression. It does not matter to me. I love how this one pours a beautiful, bubbly dark amber with a a foamy nitro-can influenced one finger beige head. It even sounds good pouring into a the pint glass. The aroma is very sweet, malty, and appealing to me. It has a kind of caramel-honey sensation on the nose. The mouthfeel is bold and creamy. The taste is also sweet and special with a kind of molasses aftertaste. It is a favorite when I can get it."
"It is a lot like many english ales. A bit bitter but easy drinking."
"d : Excellent drinkability. Well balanced beer with a great flavor makes me want to keep buying pints."
"Pours a clear copper color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. The sound of the pore was amazing!. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight smoke, some slight yeast cleanliness, and some nut aroma. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation. Tastes of roasted malt up front, some sweetness, then smoke flavors come through, sweet malt and hops in the background, and finishes with more roasted malt. Overall, this is a great beer with a nice blend of flavors and a general smoothness. I would definitely recommend this brew."
"D: good medium ale that's easy to drink. just not my thing."
"D: Would I have another? Sure. Is this a session beer...maybe not. But none the less, enjoyable for sure."
"I like this one...would be great with spicey food. Has a complex flavor that changes as you drink it...starts off easy and gets harder towards the finish...you can taste the alchol slightly...would definately do again"
"Pours a dark amber/brown and slightly clear. Has a one finger light tan head tan remains but does develop a good collar and laciness. Very simple aroma, malt. Taste is more complex with some malt, a little sweetness and bitterness without any hop flavor. A slight cereal grain in the aftertaste. Thin and watery texture, light body. Nothing special about this beer, taste is average but I would have another one."
"This beer is a very good session type beer for the person who is not a big hop head. It pours a medium copper and has a nice half inch head that dissipates pretty quickly. It smells of malt and nuts. It is very drinkable with an aggressive carbonation. It tastes of malt, figs and a hint of sugar and nuts. The tastes lingers a little bit on the back end and there is no bitter hop ending perceivable."
"MF&D - I could have used some more carbonation and viscosity to make this beer a bit beefier. but hey, I could also chug this untill ill. a very refreshing and easy to drink grew. finally, a nitro with some freakin body to it!"
"The beer had a medium to light body, carbonation was right. The beer was pretty smooth and easy to drink. Overall, a good beer and one that I will probably pick up again, but may not be my first choice."
"D: Goes down very easily, especially with the buttery taste and feel. A nice quaffer. I'd seek this out again over some poorly made craft brews, but if I were in the mood for a really good brew, I'd overlook this."
"Overall- Little less complex then some Scottish ales I have had but still very good."
"Great atmosphere. Complexity and balance defines the flavor. Great light, but hearty body. Very good quaff."
"Mouthfeel: Light body with a clean finish. Somewhat spritzy carbonation at first, light carbonic bite that quickly dissapates as the beer warms. Very slight diacetyl slickness, but almost complimentary. Very Drinkable."
"12 oz brown bottle offered to me while ""garage sitting"" with a friend. Pours a crystal clear medium ruby/amber with a dense white head and some lacing. Aroma is a nice the mix of toasty malts, toffee, caramel with some notes of ripe fruit. Taste is a smooth blend of rich toffee and biscuit like flavors. Medium carbonation with low hop bitterness as a scottish ale should be. Very enjoyable."
"Nikki"
" ~ This is a great brew to kick back and drink with your pals while hanging at the pub. I wish I could find a place in Point that had it."
"Drinks nice in the mouth, some ashiness at the finish, but otherwise OK. Balance and dryness define this beer. OK drinkability for a session beer that this is, nothing exciting about it, or even freshness, prefer others made in the USA."
"Overall: The mouthfeel was on the weaker side being that there was very little carbonation. But overall it's pretty drinkable due to the fact that it's pretty mild and has no overwhelming qualities."
"A classic that I revisit often. Beautiful bottle underscores the brewery's antiquity. I'd like to know more about how this particular beer has changed over the years. Pours a clear mahogany with a small tan head that settles very quickly. Yummy aromas of complex malts spanning the spectrum from sweet maple syrup and toffee notes to biscuity to toasty malts. Tastes like all of those aromas; malt-heavy (as a good Scottish ale should be) with a slight woodsy bitterness keeping it from becoming a malt bomb. Absolutely delicious. Only flaw is an overcarbonated body, but that's just my personal preference. Am having this with pate and crackers and loving it."
"Dark brown with a strong one finger white head which hangs on a considerable time. Good amount of lacings. Aroma is caramel malt. Taste is dark caramel malts with a hint of chocolate. Just enough hop bitters to balance the sweetness. Mouthfeel was silky smooth and that made for an easy session. Very nice ale."
"Taste: light smokey maltiness, very even flavor across the entire tongue."
"Silky mouthfeel and easy drinking."
"A fuzzy maple brown color with a medium off-white head and fair lacing. The aroma is nutty earthy and buttery with a mild raisin wine hint. The taste is a bitter caramel malt, a bit thin but an active carbonation. There is a sweet cherry lime touch over a malty undercoat. It's nice, pretty easy drinking too, not much alcohol."
"Extremely creamy white froth of a one finger head, looks more like a smooth plane than aggregation of micro-bubbles, heavy lacing. Clear amber red to copper in color, very consistent. In the nose presents bready, doughy accents with inviting honey, caramel, butter, cocoa powder notes, blends in mild apricot, cherry fruit and indistinct nuts, certainly malty but not devoid of hops. Medium-bodied, while smooth in texture comes across much drier than expected. Tea leaf, grain, bitters and meadow grasses elevate here and there's a white citrus zest tackiness as well. That said, never loses that overall smoothness and malty appeal of toffee, bittersweet chocolate. The bread, yeast components choose neither side. Fine enough quaffer but nothing remarkably memorable about it."
"D - I enjoy an occasional Scottish Ale, and this one is very drinkable. I could easily drink a few of these back to back."
"D. Certainly a good session beer in the winter months. Drinkability is somewhat limited do to the intensity of the flavors and mouthfeel. I think this would be a fine beverage to pair with a good cut of steak."
"Go get one... for real!"
"M/D - Very thin on the mouthfeel, especially compared to other Scottish Ales that I have had. A passable beer, but far from one of my favorites."
"Cascading head effect pouring from a nitro-can. Copper-golden color with one inch of dense white head that never really goes away. Moderate amount of lacing left on the glass. Has more of an English hop aroma then what I have experienced in other Scottish Ales. I absolutely love the aroma of English hops. A little earthiness and nuttiness as well. The hops also play a large part in the flavor. The hops give a floral and earthy quality that combines well with the slightly nutty and smokey quality of the malt. Has a creamy texture from the nitro but it feels a little thin. This is a very drinkable beer thanks to the nitro and low ABV. Love the hop profile as well. Definate purchases in the future for me."
"I am tired of companies naming their bitter a Scotch Ale. This is just a below-average English ESB in disguise. Pours dark amber with no head. Has the aroma of smoked malts and caramel, but that's it. Nothing even resembles the aroma in the taste. Flavor is flat, rotten, and above all, weak. Its also expensive. Avoid."
"Pours a reddish amber color body, very clear. Foamy, whitish head, lasting with good lacing. Very malty aroma, almost acidic, not very nutty. Musty. Might be a characteristic of English malts. Kind of a turn-off for me. Malty, slightly musty flavor, some banana, maybe clove. Pretty clean aftertaste. Fruity. Somewhat creamy."
"Pours a nice chocolatey orange color with a nice foamy head. Smells of peat and nuts and has a slight orangey twang on the nose. Great balance to this beer, so easy to drink. Medium bodied with a spicey dryness at the end. Malts and more nutty malts keep coming. Very good session beer, I cannot believe I had never given this one a whirl before."
"D - This is very similar to an Irish ale but with emphasis on malt instead of hops. Very drinkable. Would love to find an establishment that has this on tap!"
"Drinkability: An easily sessionable Scottish Ale that is sure to please. This one intimidated me until I drank it and I must say I really enjoyed it. Not too rich for my taste but an excellent interpretation of the style."
"If I had to choose one word to characterize this beer (besides ""sweet""), I'd call it mild. It drank very easily and was, contrary to The Pub's description, creamy throughout the experience. I didn't notice a multitude of flavours, but then again that could be due to my rather inexperienced palate."
"D: Okay on the drinkability. But nevertheless a good solid beer that I enjoy often."
"d: One of the better nitro beers. Not as full-flavored as you may like, but still very tasty. I could drink this all night long and probably will."
"Poured a dark amber. Eggshell colored head on top was about two fingers high after a moderate pour. Nice thin lacing on the glass.Smelled of sweet malts and a little bread.Taste is sweet malts mostly with a little nuttiness. Also a hint of piney hops in the finish to make a delightful bitterness."
"Drinkability: Tastes great, lower ABV, medium body. Excellent for session. Will certainly buy this again."
"First time I've tried Belhaven. Pours a nice amber with thin but enduring head that leaves generous lacing. Gives off a medicinal, malty aroma. Taste is of toasted malts with suggestions of chocolate and caramel. Earthiness and ever-so-subtle English hops emerging towards the end. Slick mouthfeel helps make this a very drinkable brew. Good stuff, but not my favorite style..."
"These go down a bit too good. Have had this on tap in the Boston area before, as well as in the bottle --- first foray into the nitro can. Not bad. Was afraid of overcarbonation, but you get the trade off of the creamy head. Decent brew."
"I'm a huge fan of Scottish Ales. I've drank many of them, and this is a pretty good one. It's a little light in the color and flavor, but still not bad. The smokiness and dark roasted malt flavor is not present like in most Scottish ales. Overall I like this beer."
"D= This is an excellent and often imitated ale. I found it to be very easy to drink and quite complex for its size. Would make an excellent session beer."
"D: A nice brew with a subdued complexity. An interesting smoky malt backbone, I'd certainly drink a few of these."
"Overall though really enjoyed the difference in character on tap, and definitely quite enjoyable. This brew from the bottle has a lot more nuttiness to it - and while still enjoyable, I prefer this on tap. Certainly one I will have again."
"D: A good quality and distinctive ale. Makes me want to try more Scottish Ale and try more from Belhaven for sure. Not sure if I could drink more than one or two of this particular brew. I'd like to try it on tap."
"I used to really enjoy this. It was a staple of mine at a pub. Though, my tastes have changed. Not a bad beer on nitro, but pales in comparison to cask."
"One hell of a show errupts after pouring a large Belhaven pub can into a pint glass. A large mass of foam settles to a perfect one finger white head that doesnt look like it will budge anytime soon atop with dark brown/orange brew. Candy sweet malts, it even smells like a beer straight from the tap. Creamy body, sweet roasty malts, much better than a bottle. . This drinks incredibly, and what an awesome look in the glass as you get down a few sips, extreme lacing. Medium fluffy body and very drinkable. I think im in love."
" To me it had a sort of semi sweet woody taste that I reallly enjoyed, not very hoppy and with a very smooth feel. Had several and cant wait to try other ales"
"Creamy body with low carbonation. Smooth but not flavorful enough for the thickness of the body. Very easy to drink."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability is perfect. Alcohol content is in just the right range, and the flavors meld perfectly to leave you wanting to quaff another. This would make a perfect session beer."
" Overall, a very quaffable version of the on-tap. It is very drinkable and I would gladly have seconds and thirds."
"D: A well mannered gentlemen and enjoyable."
"I could drink these all day long. NICE"
"This beer poured a nice ruby color, roughly 1 inch white head to it. There is a scent of roasted malt that finished with a hint of hops. The flavor was more of the same, roasted malt with a nicely balanced hop finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, with long-lasting flavor."
"Very good Scottish ale. This'll read like a commercial. The next time I'm in the mood for a malty brew, I'm reaching for Belhaven."
"Poured out of the can an amber/copper color with a tan head. Head didn't last long but it did retain the ring it left behind very well and this laced nicely. The aroma is sweet and malty with a rich soil undertone. Robust beer with a good mouthfeel, flavors are sweet malts, nuts, slightly bitter and dry. Very much a classic ale and distinctly European in style. Medium carbonation with a soft, medium body. Well balanced in every well and quite enjoyable. A little expensive as a six pack but for a brew ordered at a restaurant (Thanks Vanessa of Ri Ra!) it's worth the price."
"Pours out of the widet can with a typical nitro head of creamy tiny white bubbles. Nose is damn near non-existent, but what there is is copper and slight peat. Malty flavor, thin, some peat and very slight smoke. Really kind of bland here. Mouthfeel is typical nitro, thin, milky, slick, watery. Drinkability is good, as this one is quite slammable. I think this is an ideal beer for session drinking after youve had more than a few good ones, and have a screwed palate. Good for its purpose, but not one to get excited about."
"Draught Can, 5.2% abv, this is a spectacular ale. Creamy pour that ends up a medium copper/amber with an enormously thick fluffy head and some signs of sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet with a nice bread-like quality. Semi-thick mouthfeel that finishes full and smooth. Flavor is great, nice and malty agian with a nice bread tone. Slightly bitter but hardly noticeable. This is a great example for a Scottish ""Pub"" Ale."
"This poured a clear, dark mahogany with off-white head. It smelled like watery toffee and caramel malts, with wild barley and slight copper hops. It tasted mostly like earthy caramel malt, with a hint of sour cherry and copper hops. It was watery with moderate carbonation, and had a bitter/sour aftertaste. Overall this was a good old fashioned ale that was easy enough to drink, but could have been cleaner."
"D - A nice, low ABV malt fix with a beautiful sweetness. It's too bad the entire brew falls apart late palate."
"This is the beer I order the most of at my corner pub. It's easy to drink and never fails to put a smile on my face. However, I can't help but thinking it's not a Scottish ale as much as it's a Scottish rendition of a Brown Ale. Who cares? It's fantastic."
"Not a bad beer, but since it cost me a whopping 12 bucks for a six pack, I'm not sure I'll be quick to come back to this one."
"Great drinkability and a slippery medium body make this drink a fine one for sitting about shooting the breeze."
"Deep red color with light head after pouring into a pint glass. No real nose that I am able to pick up. Mild maltiness with some nutty tones in the flavor. A solid beer but not one of the best scottish or scotch ales for my taste. I rated a B- on my scale."
"D - Slightly thick, complex. I could drink a few!"
"Was ok beer. Would go for other better tasting beers in the future."
"Tried a pint on tap last Saturday at River Gods in Cambridge. Served in a pint glass. Dark molasses colored body with a strikingly white head. Smell was a bit of roasted barley. Tasted pretty nice, with a combination of peat, fruit, and wood present. The creaminess of it is definitely a plus. The only problem I have with this beer is that I only ever want to have one. It's a bit heavy as it warms up, and by the time I get to the bottom, I really don't want another. The beer gets somewhat chalky after a while. It's a nice one and done beer, but it always tends to slow me down a bit on a night out drinking."
"This is the only scottish ale that I have reviewed/ drank, most similar are Scotch."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"I believe that I officially ""heart"" Belhaven Brewery. I havn't tried a brew of their's yet that I didn't like. Served this one chilled in a pub glass. Poured a nice reddish gold color, bloody brilliant! Smell wasn't as bourbonish like the other brews I had but still had nutty and caramel notes as well as some balanced hops. Taste was a little more bitter but still had that caramel malt dominace and a slightly astringent finish. A beer that would make even Fat Bastard proud."
"A nice surprise-- I bought this as part of a mixed six-pack from my local liquor store, having never tried it before. Decent carbonation and relatively low alcohol level make this quite drinkable. The aroma is nothing special-- perhaps a bit nutty with a bit of caramel-- but the taste is very smooth. The mild smokiness was very, very pleasant. Definitely worth drinking again."
"Drinkability: Very well, a light and stimulating drink."
"D- This isn't my favorite style, but it goes down quite well. Would definitely try again."
"D - This is a very finely crafted brew. On the flip side I probably would not get this again because it is not one of my favorite styles. If I were at a traditional eatery I wouldn't mind getting this to accompany a meal. Very nice."
"D: Complex flavors seem to match well with other 'Scottish Ales' that I have had. There is a real earthy flavor and texture that certainly makes it seem believable that it is from a place as rugged as Scotland. Good; recommended."
"Solid orange body with solid half-inch head that smooths somewhat evenly in a Samuel Smith pint glass... malts and hops act in accordance; smooth and pleasant;... medium-bodied and effervescent; mellow and drinkable (by the lees!)...bitter hops at the teeth early.... biting with a hint of nuttiness and a slight smokiness... heavy... a solid, strong representation of what I'd expect from a Scottish bitter served in a pub... has a friendly feel throughout."
"D- Easy drinking session beer though the peaty smokiness is not for everyone."
"D - very high drinkability. really an enjoyable beer."
"D: So thin, it is almost like water! It doesn't have enough flavor to make me choose it over water!"
"Belhaven is deeply malty, slightly sweet & always leaves me wanting more."
"Drinkability is slightly above average, a 4 pack is a good bet."
"Recently acquired a 4 pack of these in the nitro can. While not as impressive as I remember the nitro tap, this is still a very well rounded brew. The widget creates a creamy head with just enough crispness. Flavor is sweet and toasty, not too strong. Doesn't try to over do it and succeeds at being well balanced."
"D - Very drinkable. Lots of dark malt. Not overly complex, but a great example of the style."
"Drinkability: Would recommend this beer to people who like scottish ales. Very drinkable beer."
"Very drinkable, but not for what I would consider good reasons. It is quaffable, but too bland. Maybe its the widget that turns me off."
"This beer settled with a thick, creamy head and a orange-amber appearance. The aromas of coffee, mocha and chocolate were the main attributes I sensed from the beer. Wicked malty and sweet wrapped around a frappe-like thinness/creaminess. The mouthfeel offered a perfect balance: thin but creamy. Overall, one heck of a Scottish ale, highly recommend."
"A nice 60 Shilling Scotch Ale. Poured at 50 degs into pint glass. Very clear, deep amber colour with nice tight head. Aroma was mainly malts perhaps a tinge of sweetness. A soft smooth maltiness dominates this ale. The body was a bit thin for my tastes, and the finish was reasonably dry -perhaps a small bit astringent. Overall, a nice middle of the road scotch ale."
"D- A very easy drinking beer with a nice low abv and delicious complex qualities. Highly recommended. A shining example if a Scottish Ale."
"d - not quite what I expected. The malts were not quite as complex as I would have liked. It had some smokiness, but the aftertaste was just... not appealing. I didn't realize there was a difference between a scottish ale and a scotch ale/wee heavy, but I think I prefer the later. This just didn't hit the malt profile I was hoping for. Not bad, but nothing too special here."
"D - A nice ale with some subtle fruit flavors makes this an easy session sipper."
"D - Average I suppose, I would've liked this much better were it not for the strange aftertaste. Worth a try I suppose, I'll revisit if I see it on tap."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the Scottisk ale style"
"D - Overall a very drinkable beer and I enjoyed all 4 that I bought"
"Pours a medium amber light caramel color with plenty of dense white head and excellent tracing. Great clarity as well. Aromas are quite the mix of toasty malts, toffee, caramel with some small notes of chocolate and dark fruits. On the palate, a rich toffee and biscuit like flavors coat the mouth with its medium low carbonation. A slight floral finish hints at noble hops, but bitterness is very low. Overall, a very enjoyable beer and one I hope to duplicate in my upcoming homebrew."
"Nice amber color with a white creamy head. Aromas of caramel and apples with a slight hint of roasted malt. The flavor basically carries on the work of the aroma, providing a silky smooth, creamy mouthfeel to boot. The finish is both fruity and biscuit-like. If I was Chuck Norris, I would drink this for breakfast with cranberry scones and clotted cream."
"Worth a shot..."
"MF&D - A smooth and slightly carbonated feel in the mouth. Not as heavy as I would have expected. Well balanced and very drinkable. I would recommend Belhaven Scottish Ale to those who have not yet tried it."
"Nice as a session ale."
"A very smooth body overall with the malts I was expecting. Maybe some roasted malts or the usual coffee been thrown in, I don't know, but it tastes fine nonetheless and goes down great as the backbite is a tad dry from the hops. Overall, a great mix and a good ol' session brew. There are a few bars here and there that put this on draft - drink this if you're at one of them."
"Creamy, tasty, thick, creamy head, smoky aftertaste somehow. The taste of a Scottish ale seems to com close to a stout. Had it on tap in Pennylane in Richmond. It goes great with their Liverpudlian fish and chips. Good times I'll have another pints of those."
"I might like this better if matched with the right food. This beer is just a little too sweet for me to drink regularly. I've had it on tap before and prefer it that way (just not recent enough for review)."
"Reddy brown pour with offwhite head that hung around for a bit. Not a fan of the smell of this at all, and was different from any other ""bitter"" style beer. Wasn't bitter at all, but smelled and tasted kind of sour and sweetish at the same time. Almost a sour and sweet chocolate-ish flavor but not in the way a stout is chocolately. All in all this was slightly drinkable but I wouldn't do it again on purpose."
"Pours a nice orange-amber color with a tan head that laces the glass pretty nicely. It smells of sweet malts, some vine fruits, and scotch. It has a nice flavor to it - a sweet malty/fruity beginning turning to a more bitter and robust scotchy flavor. It has a nice smooth mouthfeel and is a very drinkable scottish ale. This is a relaxing beer and I highly recommend it."
"D: Nice drinkability, can drink a couple at a time. extemely smooth compliments of the widget."
"Highly drinkable beer. Quality stuff."
"Light wafts of caramel malt and mild earthy hop and yeast tones entice my nose. The flavor has all the qualities of the aroma and a slight ting of acidity adding a slight twist. It's silky on the palate and going down. This is an easy drinking session beer that still has ample flavor to be served with BBQ or a steak."
"D = High drinkability. This is a very approachable beer, light pleasing flavors, good for just one or for several on an evening."
"A good beer overall, I think I'd fancy a 5.2% version."
"D: Excellent. I could drink this all night, but my common sense tells me otherwise. Perfect for a cool day or evening. Would go well with a hearty meal."
"D- This is an excellent beer and a classic example of the style. I've heard a lot about this beer, but never had one - I wish I had tried it earlier."
"Drinkability: The ultimate session beer... nice and smooth. If you're in the mood for a Scottish Ale.... this is a fine example."
"In the glass this beer is a bright, clear, brassy red copper color with a thin off white head that doesn't really do much of anything. The smell is full bready caramel grain a bit a floral hops and a fair dose of diacetyl. The taste is upfront graininess, fairly buttery sweet with a definite hop bite that is more floral spice than stinging bitterness. Underneath there may be a bit of husk or burnt grain maybe even slightly smokey, but it is subtle. The finish is a touch sweet followed by a quick drying bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty light and tingly maybe a bit thin? While I feel that this is a good example of the style and overall a good beer it doesn't really strike me as being great, I'd recommend it to fans of the style or English/Scottish/Irish beer fans in general but for me it is missing something."
"i picked up a 17 fl.oz. bottle of this at the local beer shop the other day. the beer pours a nice amber with a fluffy white head that fades quickly. it is pretty light in the smell department but what is there is some very light hops with and malt flavors with some cooling spices. the beer has a light nutty flavor with hints of caramel and nice toasted malt presence and a slight slight hint of hops. unfortunately, the mouthfeel is pretty watery and a little over carbonated which definitely takes down the drinkability a peg or so. overall a decent beer but not one i would go out of my way to have again, certainly not in bottle form."
"I really like a lot of Belhaven's beers and Scottish beer in general, but this one kind of left me flat. I have had it in bottles before, and it had a lot more flavor, the nitro can seems to have flattened the flavor out in favor of smoothness, which was exceptional for a Scottish ale. Nice but not something I would buy again."
"Pours a dark copper color with a nice lace of head. Smell has tons of caramel aromas. Taste is very dank with caramel aftertones with hints a floral tones also.. Bitterness is minimally. Not much at all, only a bit in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very smooth with light carbonation."
"I was dissapointed by the nitro-draft version, so I'm hoping the bottle is better. Here it goes: even without the nitro, the head rises nicely and the retention is excellent. The taste is better too; sweet smokiness highlights the improved flavor. Medium bodied and easy drinking. Overall, I found this to be an improvement over the nitro version. Who would have thunk?"
"I would like to have some of these great flavors shown off in the smell of this beer. The taste has so much but you would never know it by the smell."
"Overall not bad. It was a very solid offering from Belhaven and really was a fine drink to throw done with dinner. Not sure how it is in can or bottle, but on tap very fresh and very indicative of the style. A quality ale for sure and something I would recommend."
"The Scots know how to drink."
"Very light, three inch carbonated head, Settles in foam form. The body is a very rich amber color, but not quite opaque. You can definitely see the heavy yeast content. Good presentation. Significant fruity, hop smell and yet a good malt presence. The taste is certainly a surprise. Good balance of hops and malt (definite hops dominant) with a very good fruit/hop aftertaste. I have nothing to compare this ale to, but its a good one."
"This is the first Scottish Ale I'd ever tried and I didn't know quite what to expect. It had a dark amber appearance with little head to it. There was a bread-like smell, along with some malt. It had a nice nutty taste that, in some way, reminded me of Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. Overall, it's a pretty drinkable beer, though not something I flipped over."
"D: Goes down easily, but it's a bit on the heavy side."
"Another fine offering in the ""...of the month"" club (thanks DK!!!). Nice deep gold/amber in the glass, with a tall, smooth billowy head. Soft malt in the nose with a delicious carmel first taste on the tongue. As Scottish Ales go, this is one of my favorites. Extremely smooth tasting, little hops except to provide a bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. And the nitro can is a lot of fun because you get a gorgeous bubble show (like a Guinness) along the sides of the glass after the pour. It's one classy beer. That's 3 for 3 of those I've tasted from my box so far."
"16.9 oz. glass bottle- color of medium brown, with a thick long lasting eggshell colored head - nose of scotch barrel, iodine, malt, and cola  taste of earthy, woody, malts, slightly sour, and nutty notes - body is smooth, and with decent carbonation  aftertaste of roasted malts, some woodyness, and lingering"
"Drinkablity: Extremely tasty. I could drink this constantly. Great sessionability."
"prosit, MK"
"D: Its a solid beer, but is somewhat light on taste/complexity. Still, as a lover of nitro beers, I could see myself putting a few of these away. Very sessionable. Not hard to drink, and I will consider picking a few up again."
"For some reason this is the first time trying anything from Belhaven even though it's easily available. This is a quality Scotch ale that is a joy to drink on these cold evenings."
"Taste & mouthfeel - Sweet and caramelly with a buttery quality; a bit mineral as well. Mild hop bitterness in the finish. Very slick mouthfeel. Medium-bodied with fairly still carbonation. The creamy head adds a bit of richness to the body."
"Pours a light honey brown color, slight haze, with a small tan head that dissipated into a very small ring around the glass. The smell is of caramel malt, buttery. The taste starts off with a buttery caramel malt, then an earthy bitterness follows. I only pick up some light smoke & nutty flavors. The feel is fairly light and quite fizzy, finishes with a slight bitterness. A pretty easy drinking brew. It is a bit light and I expected a little more complexity to it. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall this review is uneven as I have never had a nitro fueled scottish ale before, I found it the worst part of the beer, would definitely try it again if there was a non-gassed version. If there is I'm sure there is a dandy of a beer behind it."
"D: Overall I am a fan of Scottish Ales. Just not this one. But I do see that people who enjoyed it in a nitro-can or on-tap had a much better experience. One reviewer said ""with the nitro, this would just be an ordinary ale."" I'll bet he is spot on. Willing to give it another try."
"Chewy mouthfeel and great drinkability."
"Caramel, dark malts, vaguely earthy. Dry earthy hops in the finish (Fuggles?) very understated with a dry nutty finish. Malty feel, medium-bodied with good carbonation. Lighter in body actually, and not really cloying. Could easily have 1-2 at a time, it's more flavorful at cellar temperature."
"One of my favorite beers actually. It has such a clean taste to it. Never went wrong with this brew."
"Mouthfeel is mildly creamy and smooth. Nice medium body."
"Poured out nice, had an excellent head with very nice lacing. Wonderful smell, deep and oaky with nice tones of malt and smokiness. Very nice deep copper coloring. Tastes excellent, a nice deep scotch ale with hints of caramel and peat, along with the nice smoky maltiness of a scotch ale. Goes down nice and smooth. Although not as complex as a wee heavy, this is a great scotch ale to try if you don't want the heavier and more alcoholic wee heavy."
"Taste is malt. Maybe a bit of fruit ... perhaps a tad of hops ... but pretty much just malt. It's a good tasting maltiness, I'll grant you that, but not special whatsoever."
"This beer poured a clear golden/amber color with a big, rocky, cream colored head. The aroma is quite malty. The taste is smoky with a large dose of malt  nice balance. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. Overall, the flavors and mouthfeel work well to make this is a smooth easy drinking Scottish Ale."
"Opened bottle, standard import skunk smell. Poured down the side into a standard pint glass from a 12oz bottle. Very little head/almost no lacing when head decipates. Smells of malt, nothing major. Taste is standard malty - as expected for dark color of beer. OK mouthfeel, bubbles would not make me to have more than a couple of these with dinner. I was hoping that this beer would give me the inspiration to paint the face blue/white and pillage. I just feel the expereince was average, at best. Oh well."
"D - Pretty good. Certainly worth a try. A mild ESB-esque scottish ale. Definitely toward the normal side of scottish ales."
"but also dry. Not bad."
"Pours a nice copper amber color.Leaves a good half inch head throughout the glass and laces very good.I can not get too much from the smell,a little tad carmel but the malt is there.Maybe because of the thick head the smell does not come in as well.The taste...thats there.Wonderful medium malty goodness that is fantastic in the mouth.A sweet little nutty kick as well in the back end.( I like to take in some of the head as i drink ) Finishes with a slight bittering hoppiness to end a great tasting scottish ale.I'm very pleased with this tasty beverage."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, nice beer to wind down with after a good meal, an ideal dessert beer for sure."
"I had this beer over at the Brazen Head in Brooklyn, NY. It was poured from the tap into a clean pint glass. The beer resembled a fine guiness as it settled into the glass, an impressive sight indeed. What was even more impressive was the mouthfeel and taste. I genuinely enjoyed this beer and will continue to drink it as long as it is offered at The Head. -Steve from Staten Island"
"Can you tell I like this ALE?"
"despite not being particularly exceptional in aroma or taste, it is still very smooth and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I could drink this Ale any night of the week. Just a great drink, I love it"
"Not anything too complex. Just an over nice balance of flavors to create a great scotish ale."
"-Oelergud"
"M: Not bad in feel but would have expected the body to be slightly heavier. Also lacks the good tingle of carbonation."
"Appearance is a nice rich amber with a thick creamy head that just won't quit. Aroma is Malty, bready and I'd have to say the same for the taste, but with a little sweetness from the malt with low hop and carbonation. Mouthfeel is medium that is creamy, a good beer, nothing special, but one to try."
"Originally tried this brew as part of a beer of the month club and have wandered to it every now and again. This beer pours a deep red, way beyond amber, with a solid white head throughout the glass. Smell is dry crackers, bread a sweet malty tinge. Taste is more sweetness, preserves and jam mixed with bread, though the dry portion of the beer fails to match the sweetness of the beer. I wish it were as dry and hoppy as the smell first indicated. Beer goes down sweet and smooth. A decent brew, but nothing to write home about."
"The beer is amazingly drinkable and is the sort of beer I would happily drink all day. I had this beer after a 10% DIPA and the Delirium Tremens, yet this beer still held its own in the flavor department. Just an amazing beer...."
"D: I can't find enough bad to say about this beer, but then again, not a whole lot of good either. To be sure, this offering from Belhaven is above average, but I'm not really sold on the taste. Perhaps this is an ale meant to be had in a pub, back-to-back pints. I could see myself doing that, but after the second, I'd probably opt for something else."
"D- Solid scottish ale, but a bit too creamy and too sweet... and maybe a bit too boring for me to want to drink it a lot."
"Disclaimer: it has been a while since I last had it, kinda hard to find."
"Poured into a 20 ounce pint a nice deep amber color and off white head that disapates quickly. Aromas of sweet malt and a small hop presence. The taste is just about the same. The small hop bitterness is a very interesting balace to the beer. The sweet malt makes it a very easy beer to drink, especially with a hop bite."
"Drinkability is stellar. I could drink this beer all afternoon. Recommended."
"D - This is very sessionable with the emphasis on malt. It's not cloyingly sweet because the hops do balance the malt nicely. This is pretty full bodied for a mid-level Ale but I think it offers a nice change of pace from your standard XPA's and English Bitter's/PA's."
"poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle no freshness date. a medium redish brown color with a one inch head that held well with some spotty lace. bready malt aromas with a hint of caramel and hops. taste is same, mouthfeel is very, very smooth and light with a light carbonation. this was my first beer from belhaven brewery and i'll be looking for more of their beers."
"D: On tap I am a big fan and will gladly come back to it."
"I still don't have a very good conception of the Shilling strata, but this one must be closer to an 80- or 90+/-, a good deal darker and more complex than their St. Andrews. I definitely prefer this one, very smooth and sessionable while having a lot of body for relatively low abv."
"Overall: This reminded me to avoid anything Scottish, apart from Macallan, Highland Park and Aberlour."
"Smooth mouthfeel. Balanced and easily drinkable, yet just not that interesting."
"D - A very nice beer. An excellent representation of the style. Nothing amazing in terms of flavors but a good taste that goes down easy."
"Belhaven Scottish Ale was a nice clear red-brown color. Ith had an off-white head with decent retention. The aroma was malty. The taste was malty and a little toasty with a hint of smoke and a dry finish. It was light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a good beer and I could easily have several of these in sitting."
"This is one fine sessionable Scottish Ale."
"I've always liked Belhaven but this is the first time I've tried the nitro can. It's surprisingly good."
"The taste was not too sweet and with a hidden sharp herbal kick. It drank very smoothly with just the right bitterness."
"Pours an amber to dark copper with a nice creamy one finger beige head. Floral hop esters up front with softer notes of peach, apple and warm buttery caramel. Very mellow nutty profile with roasted barley, caramel, brown sugar and hops offering slight peppery spice, tea herbals, and a little spruce. Nutty to sour earth tones throughout and malt and honey sweetness gain ground towards the end. The nuttiness and sourness moves into the finish along with some dryness and oaky notes, but fades too soon. Thin mouthfeel and creamy on a vigorous swill is really enjoyable."
"**Tried this one more time at a tasting, and felt like an idiot, very good beer and will rereview when i get a full bottle, until then im rating all 4's so it isnt unfairly rated"
"The biggest flavor is a roasted malt flavor with a sweet backbone that lead to a slight dark chocolate finish. Yum! This was thin and watery, but not in a negative way. A lot of scottish ales that I have tried were a bit on the thick side, but this one wasn't, and with an ABV of 5.20%, perfect for sessioning if you've got it!"
" I was so disapointed with the taste of this beer. I had been so impressed with their St Andrews Ale but this was not that. Taste was slighly sour and watery. Flavorless I thought. The smell was good with a nice bready yeast fresh bread smell, but that is about the best I can say about this one. Will not buy again"
"Poured a coppery red with a tall head that lasted. This Scottish ale was lighter in color than many of the US versions I have tried that are reddish brown to porter brown in color. Aroma was of malt with a hint of nuts. The beer had a rich creamy mouthfeel and tasted like sweet malts with a nutty finish. Hops presence was light with a mild bitterness that was pleasant. A drinkable beer. I would buy it again."
" Harumph .."
"This brew started out predictably, with a carmel-like nose and deep golden hue. Unfortunately, that was the best part. The beer is thin, and has a strange, almost metallic taste. It doesn't improve as it goes, either. This is not a very good beer IMO. I really like the Wee-Heavy, but I won't buy this one again."
"D - Excellent drinkability -- I will always like this one."
"I've had the nitro can version of this and far prefer that to the bottle. While admittedly a very pretty beer, the taste is lacking, especially for the genre. This is more of a ESB than Scottish Ale. No real rich malts or strong burnt sugars, or any peatiness or earthy tones outside the nose. I'm actually quite bummed out. Outside of the admittedly pleasing bitter quality there isn't much here. Too bad."
"A most enjoyable experience drinking this brew. Hearty and stiff yet sweet and complex."
"D- highly drinkable and sessionable (and what a session it would be), though not my preference, the nitro scottish ale thing is interesting and delicious, i prefer w/o nitro, but I'm still recommending this brew"
"It went down with a nice creaminess. I could have drank a few of these in one sitting."
"An extremely creamy brew, but at 5.2% this makes for a decent session drinker. I was a little bummed when the 440ml/14.9oz can ran dry. (WTF is up with 440ml? Just make it an even 500. Geez!)"
"D: Overall a decent deer, this is something I come back to every now and then."
"Drinkability: Disappointing and fairly unremarkable."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but all in all, nothing outstanding here. I think many of the bottled Scottish ales are better and offer a maltier flavor."
"Poured a nice, clear copper into a pint glass, leaving a creamy one-finger light beige head that dissipates to a film, but leaves lacing as you go. Smell is a sweet maltiness -- some caramel and cookie there too. The taste is a malty smoothness with the kind of creaminess you expect from a good ale from the British Isles, balanced out by a slightly dry, hoppy finish. Feels a little thin in the mouth, but exceptional drinkable. A great session beer and one I love to have around."
"This ale pours a rich brown and a thick head with nice retention and some lacing. Its aroma is filled with malt, as well as caramel and chocolate qualities. The taste is full of sweet and bready qualities, with a little bit of hops. Very candy like in many ways. It has a good medium body and is rather creamy. The finish is quite dry, more some than you would expect. Very drinkable!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured a cloudy amber with big head and a lot of lace. A burnt caramel malt aroma dominated- not much else. Good blending on the taste, balancing the slight malt character with the finish. Slightly watery on the backend. All in all clean, refreshing and unoffensive. A solid dinner brew and easy to down couple."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light copper, forming a nice 1 1/2 inch head, that only faded slightly, leaving very nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet, with a slight nutty mix to it. The taste is exceptional! Nice creamy nutty flavor. Not overpowering, but just enough to taste. The mouthfeel is medium. For a session beer, this one ranks at the top. Very easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"Rich malt, herbal aroma in a rich, red-gold pour with a mousse-like head. Taste is sweet malt upfront with just enough bitterness to offset, finishing with a light carbonic bite. Some woodiness in flavor and faint kettle carmelization. Light mouthfeel and very drinkable. I happen to be drinking it with a beef stew and the sweet malt offsets the salty, thick stew very well."
"I'll admit that I don't know much about this style, but as far as off flavors or unpleasantness this beer doesn't have them. See for yourself."
"Drinkability- Not bad, but not overly impressed...I would love to try this brew in the can or on tap...I think it would improve the overall release of flavors and smells. Decent, and recommended."
"Served in a presentable 16 oz widget can. Carmel candy sweetness, and graininess in the aroma and flavor. Nice reddish hue to otherwise brown body with long lasting, fluffy head (very inviting). Creamy, smooth mouthfeel goes excellent with the flavor profile."
"Notes - I've yet to be dissapointed and will continue to include this beer among my favorites. Anyone interested in beer at all should give this a try, whereas it can be easily respected for its fine tuned characteristics, and high quality throughout."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a very nice representation for the style. It would be very easy to finish a four-pack of the cans during a football game or movie."
"Overall a pretty drinkable and a solid brew."
"The draft can, got to love them! Anyway, the mouthfeel and the smell of this beer is better in the can compared to the bottle. The creamy head on the beer was perfect and laced heavily on the glass. The taste was of earthy, meaning oak and roasted malts, light on the hops for me but still had great taste in my book. It is a good medium to heavy bodied beer that you can enjoy with a heavy meal. Mine happened to be pizza."
"Had this at Dwyer's Irish Pub. Served with on a nitro-tap. Came out creamy with a large foamy, thick head that dissipates quickly. The flavor is nice and mellow. A nice malt dominance. There's not much else in there, a slight hop presence, but notenough to balance. This is for someone who wants the malty beer without it being overly sweet. The body is medium and I drink this all night when I'm out."
"Easy to drink and had enough complexity to keep my interest as much as many bigger beers. This was my first Scottish ale and was very enjoyable. There was a lot of depth for a beer that is quite inexpensive."
"Overall, however, this beer was quite flavorful and easy drinking."
"Pours a light caramel color as the widget-driven cascade does its thing. Settles into a clear, slightly reddish copper color, topped with a generous amount of tight, off-white foam. Nose is pleasant enough but faint until the beer warms a bit. The smell is highlighted by appetizing, lightly caramely malts with a hint of hops. The chewy smoothness of the mouthfeel is particularly striking and actually shows some hoppy crispness too--more balanced than expected and making this more drinkable than it might otherwise be. Taste is sweet and malty with some nutiness present too, all yielding several seconds later to let the hops join the dance. While not particularly exciting, this is an enjoyable beer."
"Poured a translucent, medium brown color with a thick, frothy, white head. Aromas of alcohol, taffy, and roasted malt. Creamy texture, but not much beyond that. Hint of flavors that never seem to come together; not very flavorful. Some bitterness in the finish, but more dry than anything else. Not nearly as rich or as flavorful as others in this style."
"Hell of a drinkable brew. If it were on tap, I'd be all over it."
"D: Excellent!!"
"D - tasty beer, but not really something I'm going to go after again. There are better Scottish ales out there."
"Overall, I'd try this again and give it another shot but I really was not impressed."
"Beer poured orange with a nice bubbly long lasting head. Nose has a malty, woody, and nutty notes. Taste has some complexity to it, definitely malty, somewhat nutty, but there is a slight apple hop finish to this. I am not sure if this is a pale or scottish ale. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Drinkability is good. This is a pretty interesting beer, kind of different, and definitely worth a shot."
"Drinkability: A session beer. Doesn't go to hard on the taste buds. A good cold weather beer."
"Probably a good session beer but I prefer a stronger taste than this one."
"Very drinkable though, a good one to have if you want to for go the usual stout fare."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer this time. I have had it in the past, but never on such a fresh palate. I like the malt complexity, and in some ways it rivals some traditional German Bocks. This is an easy drinking beer, and one that I would definitely drink again."
"This brew is extremely quaffable though, and that makes up for the watered down mouthfeel a little. I really like this one alot, but I feel like it could have been better. Almost there, but falls short."
"Pours a crystal brown color. Smell is basically non-existent, with a hint of malt. The taste is firmly in the malt column, and though there is some talk of hops on the bottle. The carbonation, however, is perfect for the style. Very light and serves as a terrific foil for the malt."
"Really tasty beer that takes the edge off. Can see myself drinking this more and more. Not sure of any pubs that serve in my area this treat. But will keep my eyes out."
"Highly reccommended if you can find it!"
"I was fully expecting a wee-heavy type ale (theirs is very good), but that is not what this beer is. Reddish-amber body with initially finger-thick head that dissipates. Smells malty, like a scotch ale or a wee heavy. Tasty, malty with some muted hop. Tastes similar in some ways to Old Speckled Hen, but not quite as strong and way better."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a very creamy mouthfeel. The beer is well carbonated. The beer doesnt have any extreme flavors present. This beer is very easy to drink. I think I would pick this one over Guiness any day of the week. This has just become my new sessionable beer."
"My definition of a Scottish Ale is a Belhaven. That said, the beer pours a dark brown, with a light tan head. I wasn't too impressed with the smell. Maybe it smells better off tap, and the nitro-can affected the smell somehow. But this beer tastes like pure malt, with some mild nut and other flavors. It goes down easy as well, I could find myself drinking 3 or 4 of these in a night."
"I wasn't expecting to be so pleased by this beer, in fact I almost didn't bother picking it up even though it isn't available here. Now I wish I had gotten two."
"A highly sessionable Scottish Ale, and one that's always refreshing to drink."
"A very mild but interesting and complex brew. Well worth a try."
"Very tasty beer, maybe the best beer I have ever had out of a can."
"Nice body that looks like caramelized wine. Decent finger wide head. Nose is grainy caramel, with a hint of sugary sweetness. Taste is dry caramel, syrupy sweetness. Nice but I'd like a bit more complexity. Mouth is big and thick. I suppose I could happily drink this but I'd reach for many others of the same style in it's stead."
"Copper-colored pour from a 12 oz. bottle. Malt aroma and flavor present from the start. Drank with a plate of hot wings, so admittedly some of the senses were alittle dulled, but for a low alcohol beer, this was very tasty and drinkable. Had a good finish that was still evident despite the food spices."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass with a thick, foamy head which, surprisingly, held up through out with nice lacing as well. There is a nice malty nose to the beer, and it has a dark copper color. It has a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a roasted malty flavor to it. There's a certain earthiness to it, which I'll assume comes from the roasted malt and nut flavors. Overall, a fine beer, though in the heat of summer, good for a sample, rather than a couple. I could imagine having a few more of these during the late fall when a rainstorm has forced me to stay inside. Really good Scottish ale."
"I'm a hophead, so I went into this pint with a bit of trepidation. I needn't have worried. This is a very nicely made beer, almost precisely what one would expect a Scottish ale to be. Malty, creamy, almost no hops to speak of, yet infinitely drinkable. Very good example of the style, and worth seeking out."
"Very enjoyable."
"Sweetness from the malts, caramel, smoke and some trace amounts of bitterance from the hops are apparent upon tasting. Finishes kind of crisp, which is unexpected. It is smooth, but its kind of on the watery side and the carbonation is very light. I won;t say its bad, but I wasn't impressed and I don't think I'll be visiting this one again for a while."
"PH"
"The beer poured a most remarkable dark gold like a fine whiskey with a good bit of off white head. The aroma was of good scotch malt. The taste was mainly of malt but with just a little hops in the finish to round it out nicely. The feel was medium and a bit dry and oily. This was a very enjoyable ale. It gave me all I look for in a Scottish Ale with a big malt taste, and added just enough hops. I enjoyed this while eating a steak blackened with cajun spices and topped with blue cheese. The Ale met my expectations and held up to these strong tastes complimenting them nicely."
"D: Good for sipping. Flavors aren't overwhelming."
"Pours a clear copper under a one figner off-white head that fades slowly and with nice creamy contour, leaving some good lace strings. The nose is nicely balanced between fruity malt and floral hops. The mouth is fairly well-carbonated and rather light, with just a touch of stickiness. Mild taste impression at first, fronted by some plum along with smooth bready malt. The hops surge forth at the finish, particularly as it warms, with a hint of espresso to go with the dominant floral tone. The aftertaste is very mild, with just a touch of dry bitter. This is a solid if unexciting brew."
"Very Drinkable. A nice beer. Not a strong flavor, or much carmelization, but a good beer all the same."
"This a very drinkable beer and does not leave you wanting. However some may find the thick and smooth mouthfeel not a really great choice as a session beer. I would disagree. The beer's great quality is that it is balanced well and I could have several of these in a sitting."
"Ive had the mid to lower shilling Belhavens on cask in Scotland so it is difficult to give this nitro-can version a completely unbiased review. However, prior experience aside, the chunks floating around in the body of this ale were a serious turnoff. There was also a slight tartness that may be attributable to spoilage. Hopefully this is an isolated phenomenon and Ill report back on the other three cans in the 4-pack. Otherwise this a nice middle of the road Scottish ale with a tasty emphasis on the malt. Considering American examples of the lower shilling Scottish ales are rather hard to come by its nice to see this being imported."
"Easy drinker that's worth a try, cheers!"
" Very easy to drink and quite refreshing for such a beefy abv. Not a bad choice for a session either."
"Belhaven Scottish Ale pours to be almost identical in color to the brown bottle it came in. It is a bit lighter around the edges however. Nice off white head. The aroma is a bit malty. Taste is pleasingly malty. Very tasty. Definitely worth a try. I've been enjoying this style lately since one of the stores I shop at has expanded its selection."
"Drinkability: Considering the weight of the malt content, this is surprisingly drinkable. Not too syrupy or sticky in the least."
"Verdict: A little thin, but it's a good, sturdy Scottish ale. It's certainly worth a try."
"Pours out a clear dark amber with a frothy head that dissipates into fine lacing along the sides of the glass. Smells of nutty grains and peat-smoked malt with a slightly off-putting metallic tinge. Tastes nutty and smokey with a robust hopping in the finish. The flavors present remind me exactly of some smoked almonds I had earlier today. Mouthfeel is light and slightly bubbly, which makes this a quite quaffable scottish ale."
"Extremely drinkable, this is a well put together beer that makes me want to try the nitro version soon. Highly reccomended, simple but tasty"
"Overall: Has some elements I'd actually expect from my single-malt scotches which isn't a bad thing at all. Surprisingly light feeling considering the heft and weight of the flavors."
"If you are looking for the perfect accompaniment to fried, breaded, portions of chicken or pork cutlets than you might give this beer a try. The amber/butterscotch hue gives way to a reasonable white smooth head. The aroma of honey roasted chestnuts leads to a similarly nutty like flavor with a finish milder than most Scottish Style ales, but slightly hoppy none the less. Ample body dictates it's ability to be enjoyed as an ale of ""substance", but can still be enjoyed in socially redeemable venues in large quantities (I've tested this theory repeatedly)...enjoy"
"Pours a rich gold color. Two finger foamy head. Good retention and lacing.For me the appearance was the best part of this beer. Smell is of weak malt. Body is thin and watery. Taste was like sugar water with a hint of nut flavor. Not a good beer in my opinion."
"This is just too smoky of a beer for my likings."
"still a decent easy drinking beer."
"D - Another solid offering from Belhaven. It's too bad I only picked up two. I'm not sure if I'd want to drink more than several in a row but I find myself enjoying it."
"Just had this at the local pub. Poured a solid copper color with a dense finger of creamy head over top. Nose is a nice combination between sweet caramel, ligher nutty notes and a light but present peated character. Flavor brought much the same as the nose...nut and caramel were dominant with a moderate peated smokeyness playing in the background. I really think the peated character made this beer for me. Very tasty. Feel was moderate, with a light carbonation, as is the case with most nitro taps brews. There was a good creamy character as well. Drinkability on this one was really good. I found it had nothing keeping me from sessioning it. I could have easily had one or two more of these. Very smooth and clean. I'll be having this one again."
"Pours a clear deep copper with an ample white compact bubbled head. Aroma is slightly sweet malt in the foreground, subtle biscuit in the background, with an ever so slight hint of peat smoke as it warms. Peat smoke is really noticable in the flavour, although very well balanced and not overwhelming. The solid dry malt platform is well balanced with a gentle bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light with soft carbonation. Extremely drinkable and would make a great session beer."
"What a nice refreshing beer. Slightly peaty, nutty smell, with a floral herb essence. The red color holds up a nice whitish head and gives up nice lacing. The taste is one of legends and I am glad I had a whole imperial pint glass worth. Sweet long boil swwetness covered in a light fog of peat and a gentle herbal bitterness carry my tongue off to happiness. Great full mouth feel and way too drinkable."
"It pours out a beautiful red beer with a nice tight sheet of bubbles on the surface. Mild sticking to the glass. It smells, well scottish. Not really that smoky. A malty sweet smell, and a touch of berry like tartness hiding in there somewhere. First part of the sip is a little too sweet, but as it goes down the flavors change and I'm left with a complex nutty, maybe a little roasted flavor. Not an over the top peat smoked scottish, but gentle and well, scottish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, smooth. Drinkable in the type that you could sit and drink for awhile at a slow to moderate pace, but not really quaffable"
"Great googly moogly, this beer is smooth!! Lightly roasted nut/malt aromas lead into a sweet almost bread-y first sip. Very light citrus hop bite on the tongue that leads you into the almond/hazelnut flavors of this ale. Light carbonation and heavy malts give this brew a rich, creamy mouth-feel. Very smooth and drinkable, this beer will warm you against the coldest New England/Scottish winter."
"Drinkability: Hard to say... this beer is malty and delicious, but a bit thick to drink more than one or two."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Decent full mouthfeel, and it is easily drinkable; the downside is that I didn't want to drink that much because it just didn't excite me."
"Cheers!"
"Sweet start to the tongue, moving abruptly into a mellow middle that's smoky and very, very dry. Charbroiled sweets. The two flavors knock you a big off your chair at first, but after a few sips you learn to love it and love it well. It's quite tasty."
"Drinkability: A decent enough brew for a malty change"
"Drinkability is really much better than I remember from previous tastings. I bet this stuff is great on tap."
"(12 oz. / 355 ml brown bottle with ""Belhaven"" embossed around the neck 4 times)"
"this beer is very drinkable but cooler weather would serve it best."
"D: It's like water, though the peat is a little harsh, and the carbonation is a little high."
"500 ml bottle. Belhaven Scottish Ale pours out a dark copper color with a small head. The aroma is toffee with a strange tangy citrus smell. Sweet toffee flavor with tangy fruit and a smokiness, which is sort of like peat and sort of like tobacco. Strong malt flavor, which is thick and chewy. The sour flavor is odd, but not bad. Just a little spicy in the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy. High carbonation. Interesting beer, but some may be put off by the weird tobacco flavor."
"Smooth, creamy and drinkable. Would go well with hearty foods."
"Pour is good with a nice, thick creamy head that lasts for a while. Good, but not strong, odor. Texture is very smooth, almost creamy. Tastes nutty and hoppy. A fairly heavy brew, but you can still put several back in an evening if need be."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Sublime mouthfeel, super-easy in the mouth. There is a creaminess that works so well with the spices and overall taste of this beer, it's remarkable. The drinkability here is quite good, and would make a better choice than a Scotch Ale when enjoying a few on a cool Winter's eve."
"I would love to try this on tap."
"cheers..."
"Overall Impression: A very tasty brew! Im not a fan of the style, but we tasted a lot of Scottish beers this evening and this seemed the most authentic and one of the best tasting!"
"Pours a clear deep coppery chestnut in color with a creamy light tan head. Sweet malty aroma with hints of raisin. You'll catch a whiff of alcohol and brown sugar. Aroma exhibits a caramel scent too, as the ale warms. Full-bodied mouthfeel with a pleasant carbonation that softens as it sits. Intriguing nutty and malty flavor that has an underlying smokiness to it. Some raisin and date flavors midway. Touch of alcohol. Finish has a robust tobacco-like taste to it. Excellent Scottish Ale."
"This is really good, way better than I was anticipating. Luscious, creamy, smooth, smokey. Malt is definitely at the forefront here, and the peat smoked part is an added attraction. Highly recommended."
"I would not seek this out to drink again. There are better Scottish ales to be had."
"Not a bad beer as I may have so prematurely thought. It doesnt seem to gel well early on but mellows. Kind of speratic at points but you get used to it."
"This is great nutty full flavored beer that I don't wanna put down. At first taste you can tell it's a scottish ale and as you start drinking it more and more it becomes even better giving you more flavor and great mouthfeel as you go. It smells wonderful to compliment all of it's other fine qualities."
"Overall = I'm not a fan of this style but I can appreciate this beer. It looks beautiful and I can see why some might like the taste. Personally though I did not enjoy it and would never try another one on my own."
"A good bottled Scottish Alefor nowat least."
"D- This beer could use a bit more malt backbone to stand up to the smoky peat flavors. I think with normal carbonation this beer would give a much different impression."
"Pours a clear red color witha large creamy white head. The aroma is matly, but faint. The taste is nice and matly, with some nutty tones at the end of the sip. The aftertaste has a relaxing sweetness to it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good brew. Nothing about it says, ""Wow."" But it is nowhere near bad."
"A standard and a favorite. Clear ruby in color, pours a thick creamy head that lasted til the last sip (expected for the nitro tap) Mild aromas of caramel, toffee, barley with a tad bit of hop detection and subtle sourness. Tastes wonderful of toffee, caramel, maple syrup, and perhapse vanilla. Moderate roundness in the mouth and rapidly tapers toward the finish. Becomes a bit watery, but fine for style. Finishes clean and disipates expenintually to a mildly bitter dryness. Very easily drinkable."
"The smell is nigh undetectable. A very faint of sweet caramel and buttery toffee, but nothing beyond that. The taste continues with the caramel and buttery toffee flavor and adds a bit of a campfire smoke flavor to the finish. Very earthy, and tastes as if it were straight from a medievil cask. Not for me."
"I really don't think this is a beer that should be on nitro tap. I prefer it from the bottle, the flavors are cut off abruptly by the ultra-overstated mouthfeel that the nitro gives it. Nitro is much more suited for stouts and richer beers than this."
"Pours a clear reddish-amber color with a fluffy white head. Good retention. Smells of caramel, sweet bready malt and faint spicy hops. Tastes: more of the same, great malt flavor with the requisite very slight roasted grain flavor and dry finish. Hop character is subdued, as expected. The only thing I do not like about this beer is that it is a little lacking in body - seems a bit thin. However, a very good session brew that I will be attempting to recreate."
"Very drinkable and very smooth and creamy. A solid all around Scottish ale that is very easy to have many of these."
"Rich copper color, but totally clear, with a nice, foamy off-white head. Cider-like, herbal, slightly fruity aroma. Rich malt flavor, slightly grainy and ever-so-slightly smoky. Cider spice flavor is there in moderation. Medium bodied and full flavored, with just the right touch of smokiness. Really nice stuff, I would really like to try the nitro version."
"Taste is malty with roast peat highlights. Malty sweet with some English hop notes. Great with fried chicken and sea air."
"I like this beer but definately couldn't session it as the sour aftertaste lingers a bit and makes it just an above average beer for me."
"This one began foaming as soon as the can was cracked open. It poured with a creamy tan head and lots of cascading action, finally settling to a deep amber color. The nose was malty sweet with notes of chocolate. The mouthfeel was light with a big malty sweetness on the palate. The finish had a whiskey-like flavor. This was certainly interesting to pour with its widget action, but it just wasn't enough to fully captivate my attention. Not bad, but not good enough."
"The brew exploded from the can into the glass to beome a moderate copper colored beverage with a beuatifel creamy head that lasted for the duration of the glass. Some particulate matter is visible.Smell is malty and a pleasure to the nose. Taste is on the sweet side but the malt seems to moderate the effect. mouthfeel is a creamy delight. This beer makes me even more of a scottish ale fan."
"MUCH better tapped than bottled. Dark amber with some red highlights, tan head, thick/dense and held. Very difficult to detect much of an aroma this time but I won't hinder it too much for that (this time). Tasted plenty of malt, some smoke, nice almost almond character to it. Felt pleasant on the tongue and was agreeable and drinkable. MUCH better than my last try (bottle)."
"crazy how much I liked the bottle, when I reviewed it over 2 1/2 years ago, but was far from taken by this version!"
"Pours a nice dark amber color with a thick frothy white head that retains well...a very nice looking scottish ale. Aroma is mostly malts, with hints of caramel, toffee, and biscuit. Taste is somewhat dissapointing, pretty flat and lacking character. Flavor is all malts with a light nutty caramel flavor and a fruity yeast taste...pretty standard and uninteresting really. Mouthfeel is really too thin and is lacking appropraite carbonation. Drinkability is descent, not something to seek out again especially given it's high price."
"Purchased at LCBO in Sarnia, Ontario. This is a deceiving beer, seems higher in ABV than it is. Pours a deep brown with a small tan head. Nose reveals big sugary aromas. Flavor is sweet malt, almost chewy brown sugar like. Finish is very short, suprisingly so, nice beer."
"Drinkability: Really good beer overall, worth picking up a six pack of this stuff."
"For my money though, the wee-heavy and St. Andrew's Ale are far superior."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, got the whole full-height nitro-cascade thing working, formed a dense 1"" milky head over the clear amber brew. Head is frothy, as one expects from the serving style, and lasts excellently, with heavy, foamy lacing. Aroma is creamy and slightly sweet. Taste is also creamy, with sweet pale malts, following the nose. Good flavor for a nitro brew, especially a mild abv one. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, and as such, drinkability is excellent. Nice session brew, and a rare sedate brew whose flavor can shine through the nitro presentation."
"Drinkability: I wasnt thrilled at first, but it got better as it went. Enjoyable, and worth trying, but I'm not sure it's quite worth the higher price."
"Nice to try this on tap instead of the usual can. is preented in a pint glass, almond in color, with a very creamy tan head, malty, peat nose. Soft and again very creamy mouthfeel. NIce on the tongue. Notes of maple syrup, nuts, smoke. Smooth and flavorful, sessioner supreme. Most could drink this all day."
"This is a delightful beer and well worth the modest investment of $10.99 per 12 pack at Sals Liquors!"
"This poured a clear caramel, decent head with some retention, malty nose, taste was of toasty malts, bit of nuttiness, good balance of hops and malt, little sweetness in the after taste. mouthfeel was a bit thin, moderately carbonated, with a tad of chewiness, drinkability is fine, nice ale on a cold night! I would drink this again."
"In my opinion, one of the best Scottish beers sold in the US. I've drunk Belhaven in Edinburgh, and I think this beats their native lineup of beers."
"A great complex aroma with a flat, one-dimensional flavor."
"Fake, real, artificially induced or whatever  this beer looks friggin perfect. It looks like I pulled this right out of the telly and placed it on the table in front of me. The cascade of foam was quick, but coalesced into a dense and solid wall of sticky tan whipped cream. The color is wonderful  sumptuously bright brown with glowing touches of orange and amber. The aroma is creamy and oaky with rich touches of molasses and peat. The taste is sweet, but light  caramel notes come through, along with cocoa. The body has a solid and buttery malt texture. Overall, this turned out to really be a great beer. I could drink plenty more of this."
"A pretty smooth brew that provides a malty and nutty backbone with a touch of caramel sweetness. A very soft and round mouthfeel. Creamy and buttery at times with a slight hop finish."
"Pours a clear coppery brown color with a creamy off-white head. Malty nose with some underlying fruitiness. Predominantly sweet with a bit of toasted malts, nutty earthiness, butterscotch and light hopping. Faint metallic twang. Overall, rather flavorful and enjoyable for such a low ABV beer."
"Damn... this is like Scotland in a glass! It pours a beautiful maple-syrup color, with a very thin head and nice lacing. The nose contains a buttery, biscuity smell, like shortbread. There's also some toffee and slightly herbal notes.The first sip reveals a peaty, ever-so-slightly smoky toffes-ish malt, and a nice crisp, clean finsish that almost carries a slight saltiness with it. The mouthfeel is smooth, but not incredibly rich, as the smell might indicate. Drinkability is off the charts... alcohol is so low. A fine session brew -- I keep wanting to go back for more. Overall, this is a much more complex brew than given credit for. I suspect scotch whiskey lovers will like this beer. Unique."
"Good drinking, not too heavy or light. Low alcohol combined with a good flavour make this one worth repeating."
"Not particularly complex, but strangely satisfying. It was a great looking pour. two inches of thick, creamy head and it looked like a just poured Guiness the way the carbonation settled. There was not much to the taste, the hops were extremely smooth, and the beer came off as over-all creamy. The malts were a bit heavy on the tongue at first, but as I drank a bit more I started to like the mouthfeel"
"Not much taste, didn't like it, couldn't finish it. Rich scotch colour. Tried to warm it up to room temperature, but didn't help. No aroma. Mettalic and other off-tastes, and aggressive carbonation. Taste could have faded with age, though we don't think so. Thanks Radek, originally from OKbeer."
" Not sweet, perfumy, nor tart; a real beer drinkers beer."
"This beer is quite nice and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to experience a classic Scottish Ale. It makes a tasty session beer. It is interesting but does not overwork the palatte."
"From a nitro can, it pours in typical nitro can fashion with loads of foam and bubbles swirling about. It winds up a nice golden-brown. The smell is a bit on the light side with hints of caramel and nut. Behind the caramel and nut tastes is just a bit of hop bitterness to balance things nicely. Mouthfeel is nice, as is drinkability. It's certainly a nice session beer."
"Pours a nice copper color and has a creamy nitro head. Hey, all nitro beers look good. It smells like caramel and burnt sugar. The taste is a bit thin, with a touch of sweetness and a decent hop bite that carries through the finish. I liked it for the first sip and then it got boring towards the end. It's not a horrible beer, but it is not one of my favorites."
"Highly drinkable given its mildness and low abv%. Nothing special with this ale, just a slightly above average Scottish Ale that doesn't quite peak my interest."
"This 500ml bottle poured a nice rich looking brew with a firm tan head. Color of brew was deep brown with a hint of red color. Nice lacing down the glass. The smell was toasty sweet malt. The taste was sweet malt and caramel wath just a hint of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was good but a little thinner than expected. The drinkability is very good. Great session beer."
"poured with the typical dense nitro head and a clear brillant amber color. has a faint peated malt almost sour or acidic. aromas are very faint, either from bieng exceptionally balanced or just old. light body with an average mouthfeel. the sour/acidic character makes it's was through to the taste and is discouraging. you can drink the stuff but it tastes like it's a bad batch or just old, even though the can had a freshness date on of 2005. probably won't get it again, good thing it was free."
"Pours a brassy translucent brown with a creamy light tan head. The head dissipates slowly and leaves a good amount of persistent lace on the glass. The aroma is moderately strong toasted malts, light coffee malts, and caramel. Initial sweet toasted caramel flavors give way to stronger roasted malt and light coffee malt flavors with a hint of smokiness and minimal hop bitterness at the finish. Body is creamy and well carbonated, if a bit insubstantial for a Scottish ale. A tasty, but light session brew for malt-heads like me."
"Comments - This beer is certainly not what I expected, but I was pleasntly surprised. This beer is on my list of ""need to buy agains."""
"Got this one in a bottle, not can as the picture shows. Pours a dark red color with a very small head that doesn't stay long and doesn't leave much lacing on the edges of the glass. The aroma is of slight smokiness and a caramel malt. Not too strong aroma. The flavor is of a roasted and caramel malt with a tiny bit of smokiness. Slightly thin body."
"This was a very flavorful ale. It was highly drinkable, though I didn't not like it with a meal, its taste was overbearing and not complimentary. However by itself this beer is really good. Its got a slightly sharper initial taste but then mellows out in the end after awhile."
"Pours a crystal clear dark brown color, with slight orange highlights. Pours with a big 1"" of offwhite head. Smells mainly of carmel and grassy malts. I don't think i would session this, as the taste would get annoying after one or two. The taste is very robust, with hints of chocolate and carmel, that is finished off with a big hops kick. I like the beer, i like the style, only if it had a decent abv... Still, a very good beer."
"Nice carmel, nutty flavor with no aftertaste. No discernable aroma compared to other Scottish ales I've tried. Appearence is disappointing in that it is more like an amber ale (very Bass Ale like) in color. Mouthfeel is rather watery with the absence character. It is quite drinkable and smooth, but again not very memorable. Try Robert the Bruce or Dirty Bastard for a much more memorable Scottish Ale experience."
"This beer seems much more heavy that it is, lending it a nice mouthfeel but taking away from its drinkability."
"A good beer, worth having again, but not a new standby. Also kinda hard to find around here."
"My first experience with this was in the parking lot of Great Woods in Mansfield, MA for the first Lollapaloooza. I had to grab a bomber of it from my friend John from Maine as he giggled and fell out of the door of his truck, cracker in hand."
"Caramel and toasty malt dominate the flavor, which is slightly sweet, and features just the right touch of peat. Thinnish body is not inappropriate for the style. Lingering malt finish."
"On tap at the judge. Tapped a dark golden color with a creamy head. Well pronounced aromas of sweet malt, some spice and grassy hopping. Nice caramel hit of malts right up front then the hops add some lime tastes near the finish...finish is medium and malt accented...a sweet spicy ale...very enjoyable"
"In comparison to both nitro can and nitro tap offerings the bottle is so much better, much more flavorful and mouthfeel improves ten fold. Appearance: Ruby caramel transluscent brown forms a white bubbly head looks good to me leaves behind scatterd lacing. Aroma: Slightly smokey with peated malts ripened fruit very pleasant toasted malt profile sort of nutty slightly vinous. Taste: Sweet fruit possibly plum gives this excellent Scottish ale a great upfront sweetness, peated malts and toasted character mellow the flavor out hops are bearly evident overshadowed by sweetness but no complaints this is supposed to be a malty ale. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied much better than the nitrogen offerings even carbonation that flows just right down my palate. Drinkability: Excellent staple for the style a must try, I would stay away from it on draft and can."
"belhaven scottish ale pours a translucent goldenrod color with a nice thick, compact nitro head. smell is smokey-woody with a slightly acrid hint in the back. taste is similar to the smell. the smokey-woody flavor of this ale was pungent, almost annoyingly so. the further i got through this pint the less i liked it. mouthfeel want bad with small carbonation and medium thick heaviness. this beer is like liquid forest fire. may sample again after a few months. just thinking of it now makes me kinda ill."
"This is my first Scotch ale so I have nothing to compare to. Appearance is a nice, dark copper. Head is one-finger and creamy. Smell is a mild nutty aroma with a hint of chocolate. Taste is nutty, very mild. I wish the flavors were more assertive. This is tasty enough, but lacks a strong enough flavor for me to highly recomend. Mildness may have actually increased the long-term drinkability of Belhaven Scotch Ale."
"Pours a deep mahogany and sports an ultra lush, creamy nitro head that can easily produce stiff, egg white like peaks in the form of choice per user. Caramel and woodsy aromas followed by a luxurious creamy nitro mouthfeel, and flavors of grain, butter and caramel/chocolate candy. The finish is long and kicked up a bit with a supple dose of hop bitter. This is a decent can o suds."
"This beer might have travelled a lot. It has the American labels, but I bought it in Switzerland. Anyway. The body is of a transparent mahogany color. The head's foamy and not really regular. It fades slowly, but not as slowly as I expected. The smell is malty and reminds me mostly of nuts and chestnuts. The taste is enjoyably malty, almost burnt. It really is nutty and chestnutty with some viscosity from the hops. Some sweet citric notes, but very light. Quite woody, showing hints of dark chocolate too. Maybe a light hint of blackberries. Mouthfeel is smooth but kind of weak at first, gets chewy with hops and a dark chocolate-like feeling in the mouth. Soft hot chestnuts, that's what it reminds me of."
"Belhaven Scottish Ale is a straightforward (in a good way), balanced, drinkable, enjoyable version of the style. I've never had it in any other form, but I have to say that it's one of the best nitro can British ales that I've run across."
"wow, this is one tasty beer considering the low ABV. The colour is lighter than its bigger cousins but the full malty flavour is definetely in the beer. It's all about balance and this one has in spades. A truly great session beer that tastes bigger than its bite."
"overall, not too bad. makes a pretty good impact for 3.9%."
"Pours out a deep, dark, ruby tinted amber with a white head that settles down to a nice collar in a few minutes. Exceptional clarity for such a darkly tinted beer. Smell was hard for me to place, but definitely had some hints of dark malts and some fruity and nutty undertones. Taste is excellent. Nutty, fruity, malty, and balanced with a bit of hops. Finishes with some chocolate malt undertones and a bit more bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little thin compared to the malty flavor, but still quite pleasant. This beer is quite drinkable and definitely worth a try!"
"Head is thick cream, cream-colored (almost white, with slight hints of coffee). Clear, dark, amber-brown liquid. Thick, foamy lacing. Ink in the nose, with faint (faint) nuts. Inky front. Maybe some malted milk. Smooth, creamy, watery-tasting middle. Some faint, dark malt. Finish is somewhat bitter, with some tangy malt. A little boring. Not nearly as flavorful as the non-nitro bottle. There's almost no peat or nuts. And just a hint of caramel. But it's a decent, nitro-creamy malt."
"This was a magnificent ale. rust/amber in colour, but clear. Nice off-white head with tightly knit bubbles, which deteriorated in about 45 seconds or so leaving a very sticky ring around the glass which resulted in nice lacing. The smell is very pleasant. I found it a bit bready and very nutty with a bit of smoke. Slightly sweet. The taste is quite nutty, as well, which I like quite alot. It leaves a slight nutty/very slight hoppy taste in ones mouth about 3 seconds after the first breath you take after having had a sip. The limited hops is good in that I am not a big fan of hoppy/grassy brews. The mouthfeel is very impressive.(to me anyway) Very smooth. A negligible or non-existant amount of carbonation ""sting""; very easy to drink. This has been one of my favourites for years. Brilliant!"
"Dark malts dominate the aroma--slight cream, carmelized brown sugar, although it is not sweet. The taste has a slight ""band-aid"" flavor suggesting that this can may have been exposed to chlorophenol. Thin in body, the dark malts seemed watered down. Hop is present, providing balance, but little complexity. The aftertaste is largely chocolate malt. Tastes good, less filling."
"This has to be the ultimate session brew..tasty and low alcohol..exceptional drinkability."
"This is a crisp, smooth ale that makes you want to come back again and again. Decent head and nice amber color. Very smooth flavor with hints of hops and some malt. The carbonation level is just about perfect. An excellent choice to accompany summer bbq fare!"
"Slightly sweet taste and quite smooth. Not much hop at all and finishes a little on the heavy side."
"This is a pleasant brew, but not someting I could drink all the time. I am sure it will make the rotation again though."
"Poured a nice dark amber. Gave it a good heavy pour but the head left quick, leaving behind an eggshell colored ring and a bit left in the center. Scents of smoke and cherries. More watery flavored than I expected from this... Very light mouthfeel. Taste of clubsoda, light maltiness, roasted malts. Decent bitterness with a nice dry finish. Wish there was a bit more body to it, but overall liked it."
"The tatse is a sweet malt taste much like the smell and has a slight smokey flavor in the aftertaste."
"Brew pours to a dark amber color with a perfect think creamy two finger tan head that has great retention and lacing. The aromas are nice, dominated by malt and yeast with a somewhat smoky smell. The taste is quite smooth with a strong malt flavor that leads to the smoky flavor that goes along with the scent I picked up. Has a bit of a sweetness to it that highlights caramel flavors. Overall it is a nice brew, glad I gave it a try. Not one of my favorite beers, but is solid."
"Mouthfeel: This is a smooth, creamy beer that feels soft and buttery on the tongue."
"I am not a fan of most British Isle brews. This one is not remarkable but tastes fine."
"Drinkability: While there is very little bad to report about this beer...it is not something that makes me want to run out to grab another four of them. Solid...but nothing really stands out."
"I need to try it again sometime, it's odd for a beer to change that drastically in my opinion. I'll not be buying a six-pack again though, until I get a better reading."
"I like tha fact that it is now widely available, and, I think this beer makes for a nice conversation peice. Also, who doesn't like the nitro bubble?"
"I was supprised by this one, I thoght it would be shit, but I would buy this one every now and again."
"This is an interesting beer, overall. I found the aroma somewhat wanting in this sample, and I found the diacetyl somewhat distracting."
"I've also tried the nitro-charged in cans, but prefer the bottled version. Hopefully, I'll get back to Edinburgh and/or St. Andrews before too long, where I can make a REAL comparison! Until then, this will do nicely..."
"I could drink more of this, it is a good brew. But I'd just as soon spend my money on a more memorable beer."
"Say what you want about nitro, but it sure does make for a pretty beer, and this one was no exception. The nitro tap produced a tight, creamy one inch head atop a dark brown body. Smelled nicely of malt, but I had to pay attention to notice it. Taste was simple and inoffensive, but not as robust as I expect from the style. Mouthfeel was exactly what you'd expect from nitro and what you've experienced with Guinness. At 3.9% abv, this is a good candidate for a session if Scottish ale on nitro is your thing."
"Nitro at the Penny Lane Pub. A clear, dirty orange in color with the requisite massively thick layer of creamy white head. Aromas are subtle. Malty sweetness and some earthen notes. Flavor is tasty, with good balancing of the malts and hops, and the nitro aspect really smooths everything out. Finishes with a bit of dry bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel and that helps the drinkability. A good choice that I enjoyed."
" A stout drinker that is looking for a little different beer, a Boddingtons fan may say this brew does not have the bite, but overall a well-balanced tasteful beer."
"A fine ale, very easy to drink."
"What a great creamy head on the beer from a can. You could scoop up the foam and eat it with a spoon long after it is poured. Good clean body with a dark amber color. Not much aroma at all, maybe the nitro stiffels that. There is a nice bit of malt sweetness at the begining that carries a slight smokey flavor to the back of your mouth followed by a evenly balanced hop bitterness. As typical with British brews this beer gains in complexity as it warms. Quite tasty for a low alc.(3.9%) session beer."
"I will re-review this one, since draughts are subject to many factors, beyond the brewer's hand. Beer is good. Happy beering."
"A good light Scottish Ale."
"Belhaven Scottish Ale isn't remarkable or noteworthy in any way, but it's well-made, easy to drink, and undeniably enjoyable."
"An exceptional beer and one that is underappreciated. Great on tap too, when you can find it. Mine was bottled. I have seen cans, not sure they have the widget, but that would be out of place."
"This pours magnificently with a huge white foamy guinness-ish cascade that ends up in a thick head. The beer itself seems brown, but with a reddish cast. The head retention is amazing, with long patches of lacing. The flavor is complex, spicy, but not in the chili pepper sense, more like the mulled way- spiced, if you will. There's a creaminess here that resembles drinking sweet milk with spices. The body is full, also like milk. Perhaps not for the average beer drinker, as it doesn't seem like any other beer I've had. This made an excellent session brew."
"If you've had Belhaven's Wee Heavy, this is a watered down version. Taste is lightly malty but missing some of that smokiness and spiciness I expect from a good scottish ale. On the plus side, very smooth and creamy. The low ABV makes this a great session brew but it's not that interesting to hold my attention. I'll stick to a nice bitter for a British session beer."
"Beautiful clear copper colored body with an off-white head. Mild English hop aroma with hints of mustiness. Tasted well attenuated and extremely dry with faint peat smokiness and roasted nuts. Moderate body with a level of hops that was noticeable enough. Uncomplicated session beer that does not attempt to dazzle, and doesnt have to."
"The whole beer is perhaps a bit too complex for me, and one that defy's my descriptive powers. Perhaps after more experience...suffice to say, this is a nice, smooth and easy to drink beer, reminiscent of other ales I have tried."
"A nice mild brew I had to settle me down during the crazy Superbowl. Appearance was excellent..rich creamy head with nice dark coloring. Light malty aroma with an equally light malt flavor that stayed fairly constant even through the finish. Mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Extremely drinkable. An excellent alternative to your typical light beers...this one has flavor. Excellent session brew."
"It is drinkable, need to try this beer with Barbecue!"
"Lightly caramelized color with a big creamy head (as expected out of the draught can). Definitely a malty odor, slightly nutty. The brew is actually quite balanced, the nutty presence doesn't overwhelm but is a great accentuater. Finishes dry and nutty."
"I have had this many times from the bottle and for the first time had on a nitro tap at the Lucky Dog a local establishment.Great pour (wich I expected)very creamy with a light bronze color,aroma light a little fruity and metallic.Nice mellow taste fruity and even a little smokey?Some metallic notes in there,seemed almost marshmellow-like,had three before I knew it.I really like it out of a nitro tap,hell my wife even had three."
"I was able try this beer as part of a beer club that I started. It was 1 of 24 different beers in a case. Upon pouring, a nice head built up but immediatly faded away to a tiny ring of bubbles. I recall it looking like the Morretti La Rossa which had a deep rediish color. It had a very subtle scent that did not change. It finished rather sweet and became more sweet as it warmed. I thought it to be an average beer."
"The dry fruit and earth tones flesh out this tasteful and tasty Scottish Ale. The fleeting glimpse of nuts was plesantly surprising. The malt flavor and texture provide a strong structure. I enjoyed the evolution of flavors to the point that the completion of each sip brought anticipation of the next. I can honestly say this is my first sampling of the style, but if this is any indicator, it will not be my last. I have not seen the last of this beer, tonight, or in the future."
"Taste echoed the aroma, without being overpowering. Nicely balanced and very smooth. A little on the thin side, but the taste and relatively low ABV make up for it, definitely a session beer."
"Drinkability: A crisper, drier, lighter scottish ale. Very drinkable, but my preference is for the full-blown versions, which, I admit, are less drinkable for me."
"clear bown with a light tan head that dissapates quicky. nutty and vaguely chocolatey smell, slightly bready, but not yeasty. i really like the mellow taste of this beer, it's nutty, a little fruity, like figs or something, with an ever so slight toasty chololate flavor. the mouthfeel is a little thin, but nothing to really complain about. this is a really easy beer to drink and has a pretty low abv, so you can put em away but not get too stupid in the process."
"'Liked the can much better. Maybe it's timing."
"Overall, a nice Scottish Ale that went down nicely and won't disappoint."
"Malt, malt, & more malt. Rich & satisfying. Some caramel sweetness, a touch of bitterness, & a quick finish that is slightly crisp. Rich, creamy, & smooth. A fantastic session beer."
"Drinkability  This went down very well. It is a nice and very refined offering from Belhaven."
"This is an above average scotch ale that pours a nice red colour with a tan head. The aromas are all scotch, booze, malts, and a tiny bit of hops. The taste is very malty, not too boozy, and quite scotch-like. The mouthfeel is nice and thick and the drinkability is excellent!"
"Following the pour from the nitro can a nice tan and white cascade fills the glass. Once all the action has died down a nice clear amber beer with a 1.5 finger thick, sharp, whitish head occupies the glass. Smells mildly of malt and a slight bit nutty. A nice looking and smelling beer and as it turns out a very pleasant tasting beer as well. The flavors are mild, creamy, and malty sweet. A very smooth and highly drinkable beer. Not an outstanding beer, and probably not something I will seek out, but if one is presented to me I will certainly enjoy it."
"Poured an amber color, light carmel taste, so light that by the second sip you start losing the sweetness, really not much of an aftertaste, nice smooth mouthfeel,nice lace on the glass, really nothing to bragworthy, decent but hard to find something to really recommend it on."
"Medium-light bodied and quite downable. This is a fantastic session ale. I'd like to see a bit more of a peat tang. But this is a well done version of a style I'd love to see more often."
"This brew pours with a healthy inch high rocky foam head. The lace is sticky and holds on to the sides of the glass. The color is a clear dark reddish copper. A mix of both malts and hops are quite noticeable on the nose. This brew has a smooth start of slightly sweet camel malts and some roasted notes. Hops are mild to light in the finish, not really a big player in this brew. There is also a distinct smokiness to this beer. The smoke flavors are especially evident in the aftertaste where it even takes on strong hints of jerky. This is the second time that Ive had this beer. I dont remember much of a smoke flavor the first time around. Carbonation is moderate, and the mouthfeel is light to medium. This leans more towards the malt but is not too sweet. Pretty drinkable brew, but I dont know if this one would keep my interest beyond one or two bottles."
"This is a tasty low-alcohol beer that has a lot of interest simply from its malt profile."
"This was a very interesting one. I got it and did not read how strong it's abv was. When I began drinking this I thought that this couldn't be a scotch ale. To me scotch ales have always been strong tasting with a considerable bite. This didn't have it. But what it did have was a balanced tasting beer that I could drink all night if I wanted to. Definitely noticed roasty wood flavor along with a good mix of sweet malts and bitter hops. Slight grainy flavor combined with other flavors make for a nice finish. Good beer but too expensive to session."
"So in my endeavors to broaden my beer tastes I decided to pick up a four pack of Belhaven. That and the fact that I have never had a beer in the nitro can before. So I popped the nitro can and like the gun shot at the start of the race the nitro took effect and produced a nice head in the can. I poured this tan to even light brown brew into my glass. It had a small white head that was pretty thick. The smell was sweet and malty but it was kind of hard to pick them up. The taste was at first puzzling. It was not really what I expected it was very mellow and not in your face. It took me a couple sips to see the true character of this beer. The sweetness and slight Smokey flavor are noticeable on further inspection. This beer is very drinkable and is not a bad choice."
"Light brown with reddish influences, small off-white head that is slightly underdeveloped, quick to fade, spotty/unorganized lace. Pleasant malty nose simple and inviting, the potency is mild. Very agreeable palate, malty, nutty with just enough hops in the background, a suggestion of bitterness and an odd touch of burnt flavor (wood?). I find the complexities of the palate to be damn tasty. I also love the fact the abv is under four; this would make a great session brew. Slick mouthfeel, low carbonation a firm, medium bodied beer easy to drink. Very nice, try one."
"I've tried Belvaven in bottles, draft and nitrocans and it is good beer in any form. I really like the medium color and clarity of the pour and the head is quite fine, especially in the nitrocan. I give it good marks on mouthfeel and finish but the nitrocan is a bit thin in body, where as the draft and bottle are similar in being a medium bodied brew. Scottish Ales are a favorite style of mine and this is a good representation, if perhaps, brewed to sophisticated and polished compared to a McEwens."
"Amber in color with a thick, off white head that leaves a nice lace down the glass. Aroma is lovely, sweet, slightly toasty malt with just a hint of apple. This toastiness really comes through in the flavor, with a big malt start followed, again, by a note of citric green apple. A slight nuttiness (hazelnut?) comes through as the beer warms, and yields to a nicely hopped finish. Well-deserving of its reputation."
"This is the beer that turned a friend of mine away from the death-grip of Bud Light. He just loved this beer which initially scared him with the dark brown, slightly copper color, thick creamy had and bubble action of Guinness. Then he bucked up and tasted it. The smile and raised eyebrows on his face is a memorable sight. He just loved it. Drank it quite fast actually and wanted another. Not too bitter, not too dark tasting, just enough ale flavor to win him over. I like it a lot too, and ask for it in finer beer establishments, but sadly have only found it in the eastern US, so far. Thanks Balhaven!"
"On the plus side, this beer is extremely drinkable, as it has a nice, but not aggresive flavor, and it is low alcohol enough to make it a good one for the long haul. The mouthfeel is very smooth, and presents no obstacle to drinking, except the (unfound) suspicion that some water has been added to the mix to make you buy another pint. Were I to run into this in a bar while looking for a night of drinking, this could cause some damage in the long haul, in spite of its low alcohol. But not worth really pursuing in the store."
"Copper colored with an off-white small-bubbled head that flattens out right away. Fine lacing clings to the glass. Aroma is of sweet malt and light brown sugar. Flavor is light, sweet malt, with bits of candy and syrup. Mouthfeel is smooth, but carbonation is on the low side. Clean aftertaste, with the tiniest bit of hop tingle, and a bit of a smokey aftertaste."
"This brew poured a medium head of creamy light brown bubbles and a transparent dark amber colored body. It has a mild malt hop aroma and an initially fizzy flavor that finishes with noted of spice and roasted caramel. This is a very drinkable and nice brew."
"If you are looking for strong flavour in an easy drinking ale. This one's for you."
"Poured a nice rocky light tan head which dissipated quickly. Light brown color is very clear. Aroma is a bit sweet with maltiness and a light floral hint of noble hops. Flavor is very clean and malty with a nice nuttiness. The carbonation allows the hops to finish a bit stronger than the aroma lets on. For my first actual Scottish Ale this is nice but i thought it would be maltier with less sweetness."
"This was the first imported Scottish Ale that I've had, and although it was a bit mild, I was surprised to see just how low the ABV was. Still, a decent ale, and if I was trying to session, one I'd give another try to in the future."
"Medium brown color, medium head. A medium bodied ale. Malty, somewhat nutty taste. There is a smoky undertone. Good hop/malt balance. Mouthfeel is a little thin, slight off taste (undefined). Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This Scottish Ale poured a medium tan long-lasting creamy head. The lacing with this brew was sparse on the sides of my glass. It had a nutty aroma to it in my opinion and an amber body hue. The taste was smooth, but there was some bittereness noticed."
"a nice and slow gentle pour produces a quite dark and amberish coloured brew with the usual huge and creamy nitro-incuced head. looks damn pleasing in my favorite beer glass. it throws off quite an aroma...roasted nuts and and fresh toasted malts come to mind. a light roasted malt taste follows...backed up with some balancing hops. a very different light sour finish. a pretty smooth mouthfeel lets it roll right down my throat. not a bad nitro, actually quite pleasing. light and refreshing."
"I rather enjoyed tasting this beer. It poured a pretty copper color with a low white head. It's aroma is very seductive; a caramel/malty scent that makes you want to throw it down the hatch quickly, but savor it along the way. I did find however that the taste is quite plain. There is a watery feeling about it. The malt aroma that was so prominant, was not so prominant in the taste. It drank very smooth. The body is very lite. The abv. I was discouraged to find out is less than 4. Am I drinking lite beer or what? Oh well, like I said it was a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. A Scottish Ale from the heart of Scotland."
"Fine, creamy head. The beer is a rich amber color. Not much to the aroma, good or bad. Some hints of vanilla. Tastes clean, creamy, and light. Again, nothing spectacular. Feels very good in the mouth. ""Soft"" is probably the best word. This makes it pretty drinkable, too."
"Pours out a red amber with a big offwhite head. Nowhere near as good bottled as it is on the nitro. Still quite smooth and easy to drink. Nice mildly smokey malts. A nice beer to drink outside under the sun. Goes down so easy. I won't buy this again in bottled form. Perhaps nitrocans if I can find them."
"Amber in color with a white head that disappeared quickly. Sweet, grainy smell was quite nice. Biscuity, grain flavors were most prevalent with a nice caramelly sweetness. Towards the back of the mouth there was a detectable, but small, smoky flavor. Dry, low bitterness and light-medium bodied."
"If ever there was a beer with a ""charred"" flavor to it, this is it. Like a can of coffee thrown in the fire, Belhaven is very robust. It was much lighter-colored than I had anticipated, but the taste is characteristic of a much darker beer. A very proud head atop a beautiful amber body sets it a world above its Irish counterparts."
"A brisk beer, which makes it refreshing. Better than average."
"Color is a reddish copper, somewhat light and clear, nice fluffy off-white head about two fingers high and wonderful lacing and staying power. Smell is faintly roasted malt and earthy somewhat musky, wet dirt or wet soil sense. Taste is a bit smokey sweet malt with burnt or heavily roasted malt and deep caramel flavors that are not overpowering. Its very gentle and moderate in the bitterness and sweetness that follows through to a slight drying finish. Feel is a touch silky smooth and sweet with a light-medium body thats pretty darn easy to drink."
"I have only found any of the belhaven line in nitro cans. The nitro of course give this scottish ale a great head when poored correctly. The head lasted almost the entire glass whether it was the first which was consumed quickly or the last which sat a little more as the evening wound down. The color is a rich copper with a white to off-white head. The aroma was a sweet malt with mild peat undertones. I also picked up a hint of caramel. The taste is nutty with faint smokey tones and again hints of caramel. The mouth feel is very creamy and smooth with a slighty dry finish. Very clean after taste. I drink this regularly, buy it by the case, and always have some either in the fridge or in the pantry."
"Had this in a bottle, but I'm curious to try it in the nitro can. It's very light in body for a scottish ale and only 3.9% by volume. This makes it easily drinkable. Sweet malt and some peat in the aroma and taste. Not exactly what I look for in a Scottish Ale, but I'll call it what it is, a great session beer."
"It poured a dark copper color topped off with a thick off-white head, which faded away quickly leaving a thin lace splattered on the glass. The aroma is mildly sweet and malty with nutty undertones. There is a full bite of hops upon the initial taste balanced with a fair amount of malt. A bit of nuttiness was also detected. The finish was very dry, with a moderately bitter aftertaste. This was a fairly light-bodied and easy to drink beer. This is the first Scottish ale that Ive tried and Ill have to say that it was an enjoyable one."
"A light copper colored brew with amber highlights topped by dense, creamy tan head. The aroma was a peaty, sweet malt aroma. The taste had a very enticing smoky peat component atop a solid malt background. I think there might have been a bit of hops, but I'm not sure. There was just a tinge of bitterness on the finish. The full mouthfeel contributed to the good drinkability. A nice, solid brew."
"This beer is beautifully bottled and labeled. I just wish it tasted as good as it looked."
"This beer pours a clear golden/red color with a creamy white head. The mouthfeel is rather silky because of the nitrogen and is better in a bottle. The smell is somewhat smoky and peaty. The taste is round maltiness with smoky peat flavors. A fairly tasty scottish ale that is much better in the bottle."
"Ive tried this one in the nitro can and wasnt overly impressed, so I figured I would give the bottle version a whirl. It poured copper in color with a orange hue. It formed a thick head with a good amount of lacing. The aroma was faint smoky, nutty, almost bread-like. The flavor has the same characteristics as the aroma; it was bready, nutty and faintly smoky. This is a very smooth, light-bodied beer; lighter than I expected. It is definitely an easy drinking brew."
"I really enjoyed this beer and would deffinatly pick this over most of the nitro beers out there. As for the scotch ale style, again I really like the subtleness. American scotch ales, if you find them, are very in your face smoke and malt. This is a nice reserved examble of a great beer."
"Not watery in the least for such a small ABV, this would be right at home in a pub with good friends. Doesn't really strike me as a food-pairing beer, more of something to enjoy over the course of an evening."
"This is one nitro-tap that I opt for over Guinness if they don’t have Murphy’s. I gladly quaffed many pints of this Monday, March 17th 2003."
"This beer poured into the glass an amber orange/brown color that was crystal clear so that the carbonation was fully visible. The head was cream colored, fairly thick visibly, decent staying power but left no lace. The aromas that came from the glass were of apple pie dough, apple wood, floral hops, slight malt, yeast and nutmeg. The tastes were of semi-sweet malt, floral hops, wood, roasted malt and nuts, bread, and some fruit and spices. It left a dry hop taste on my tongue as I swallowed. And seemed very thirst quenching as well. All flavors seemed to blend very well with nothing overpowering the other. Good example of the style. I rather enjoyed it."
"Nice amber to light brown color with a tight head. Malt dominates the flavor, with little or no hop flavor to speak of. A slight malt sweetness is left in the mouth. Overall the flavors are quite mild though and this brew is very drinkable. I could throw these down all night."
"This is a very drinkable, smooth tasting beer."
"A nice balance of initial nut to middle sugars to bitter end. Easy to drink and seems best served slightly chilled. I love having this one around because it is a gentle ale that balances malt, hops, scent, and mouthfeel without being boring nor too aggressive. Its a slightly sweetened and moderately bittered ale."
"Belhaven poured a scothish, amber color with a tiny white head that stayed the entire way down the glass. The smell was very complex with hints of deep raisons and a very distinct floral flavor. Very intriguing. The smell, however, was deceiving because the taste was somewhat less intricate. It had a very nice, mellow, toasted malt flavor with notes of berry fruit. Up front there were also wheaty flavors, but there was a bit of a coppery/metallic flavor as well. The consistency was good with a deep rich mouthfeel that rolled off the back of the tongue. Overall a good beer without much pretention."
"Overall, a very good Scottish ale."
"12 oz. bottle. Shiny reddish brown color. Call it Burgundy. Impressive fluffy off-white head. Smell was toasted malt, rich earthy and inviting. Slightest hint of smoked wood. Taste was a nice follow up to the rich smell. Hints of toasted carmel malt, deep earthy flavors, and just a whisper of a hot scotch presence. Toasted, and woodsmoke flavors barely linger. Medium bodied, nice taste all the way to the bottom. I always passed this one over, thinking it was mass produced and watered down. I was very wrong. I really enjoyed this one, and could see it paired with lots of hearty meals. I'll reach for this one again."

"Ah..what a gorgeous brew this is. Crystal clear amber brew forms a luxurious white pancake of a head of dense microscopic bubbles. Aroma is suprisingly restrained...I was expecting lots of malt...there is faint caramel, but also the unique smell of freshly mown hay. I'm so used to smelling this in lighter brews, so this is pleasantly suprising. Mouthfeel is silken. Hrmmm, this is really neat what they have going on here. My sister lives in Ireland and when she comes home, she brings peet with her. Now I know what it tastes like. This beer has the strongest peet taste I've experienced. It's not just smoky peet, but green peet! It's like someone threw some manure in my brew! (Although it hurts the drinkability). The beer starts with a silken mouthfeel, immediately fades into the manure/green peet combo, then into a subtle malt sweetness, and then ends in a very wet, subtle grain and limewater finish with just the slighest inkling of bittering hops. Very low alcohol and great mouthfeel makes it easy to drink if you can get past the poop taste. This is a unique brew, especially if you like the taste of wet goats and other musty barnyard animals:)"
"This beer poured a beautiful clear deep copper. A thick tight beige head settled into a nice thin layer of foam that lasted all the way down. Lacing was great. Aroma was a bit sweet and a tad grassy? Deep malty, smokey and slighty sweet taste was a winner. Nice creamy thick mouthfeel. Very drinkable. A solid choice on a winters night with a meat and potatoes meal."
"Belhaven's Scottish Ale poured a dark amber or cherry red.The carbonation was decent with a good head and high amounts of lace.A good crisp mouthfeel but lacked in taste.Hints of hops and raisins with a medium body and slight malt thickness.The ABV is only 3.9%?Wine coolers have more than that I think.Prunes,raisins,nuts,and caramel are noted on the finish.An alright brew..I wouldnt buy it again."
"The taste was awlful. The first and second sips had the flavor of this beer being brewed in a vat full of vinyl or a vinyl vat. I swear that this beer had a sour vinyl flavor. What a waste of beer and my money for a below, sub-standard beer."
"The beer is a light amber color with good white foam (characteristic of nitro draught). The aroma was rather mild (malt, hops). The taste is light, with hops the dominant flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a good balance of hops. The drinkability is good as this ale goes down easily."
"I like Scottish beers, so I thought I would give this a chance. It's not heavy like I usually like 'em, but it's still good. Had a nice head to it and dark caramel color. Finished smooth and pleasant to drink. It's not the best, but it's also not that bad either."
"This beer is a contrast of features: A beautiful appearance and a lightly hopped up bouquet (Barely any hops in the taste though) This one is so creamy the taste slips by your palate before you can get the taste. The texture is excellent though - almost like liquid silk. But this beer is disappointingly bland. If you don't like hops and your love creamy ales then this is probably the beer you have been longing for - however it just doesn't tickle my fancy."
"The taste was malty with some earthy flavors. Nutty flavors dominate. The mouthfeel is the kicker though. Its awesome! As smooth and creamy as you can get. An absolute delight for the tongue!"
"this beer has very mild carbonation, which suits me well. it is extremely smooth and creamy, an overall wonder to drink. sweet and malty with a good hop balance. this one is really a fine brew. i get a little roastiness towards the end, and i enjoyed it all the way through."
"A very solid brew. Malty with a touch of hops that tickles the tongue as the beer is drank. First Scottish Ale for me and I was very pleased with it. Darker colored ale with a thicker yet frothy white head. The bar we go to in town has this and I tried it out of curiosity. Will have a few more when I get paid."
"Pours a dark copper colour topped by a pretty nice head. I must say i was a bit dissapointed by the smell of the beer (not what i expected) but the taste was as expected and read (hints of malt and moderate smoky taste). This beer could be much more better if ABV was around 5.0%. In overall... average Scottish brew"
"Overall, a good ale that I would recommend."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a head that quickly faded but left a nice sticky lace that clung to the sides of the glass.  The aroma is dominated by a sweet maltiness with hints of peat, wood, and smoke.  The flavor is roasted malt with a good hop balance and a bitter finish.  All around, a nice brew for a decent price ($1.59 for a 12oz bottle)."
"The pour a crystal clear deep copper, the head is pulchritudinous, creamy in consistency, the lace fine sheets that cling longingly to the glass. Nose is sweet malt, caramel, earthy; maybe its my imagination but ""Hints of Peat""? Front is sweet, the top is reedy, the finish is charmingly hopped, convivially carbonated, with a congenially dry aftertaste. A very clean and refreshing beer to end my day, so its time to light up my daily cigar and Chill Baby!"
"Keep in mind that this is simply a Scottish Ale, as in an ale from Scotland, and not a Scotch Ale, as in the style of strong, heavy brews such as McEwans Scotch Ale."
"Clear brown in color.  Slight beige head diminishes to a rimming in seconds.  Some faint malt tones and a mustiness present on the nose.  Subdued sweet caramel-like malt tones on the palate.  Dry smoky tones noted as well.  Almost medium in body.  Seems like a watered down version of a good Scotch Ale, but this style is not my specialty.  Good enough tasting and easy enough to drink.  Just won't be seeked out by me in the future."
"Reasonable head, bubbles on side of glass. Perhaps a wimpy pour on my part. Fragrant malt odor with peat hints, wood, smoke and musty stone. Velvet smokiness in the flavor; I am taken aback at how much smoke I am getting from this (on par with a Bamberger Rauchbier) and how much I am loving it. Thick chewy malts with some sweetness, butter, caramel, earth hints and more smoke. Finish is wet and delectable. Like standing in a meadow of grasses and heather next to a smokehouse. Elegant and rustic at the same time. Complex, delicate, and yet forceful like a 2-ton oaken dining room table."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with a tan small but very tight-bubbled head.   The smell is starts your mouth watering with a sweet nutty malty aroma.  Superb malty taste and mouthfeel with a light toast flavor and a smoked aftertaste.  Light hops provide a nice balance.  Nicely done as it goes down very smooth.  Pretty good brew!  Slainte Mhor!"
"Similar to Boddington's or Caffrey's, but thinner and with a lingering aftertaste. There are much better widget offerings out there. Nice cascade during the pour but the head is weak and short-lived. I expected better."
"This beer poured a nice ruby color with an aroma of roasted malt that finished with a hint of hops.  The flavor was more of the same, roasted malt with a nicely balanced hop finish.  The mouthfeel was smooth, with long-lasting flavor.  I enjoyed this more than the St. Andrews."
"Musty almost nut smell.  Crystal deep red color with lots of little bubbles.  Nutty malty taste with a base of roasted malt.  It tastes just like fall, this would be a solid selection for the cooler months. Smooth mouth.  The tongue is left with a slightly sweet finish with a balenced hop bite."
"Copper/amber in color with a rich, creamy head that holds fairly well. The aroma is not real assertive, but gives a first note of light hop, followed by lightly toasted - almost 'wort-like' - malt. The body is on the light side, and combined with a gentle carbonation, gives a lightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor offers a nice balance with malt preceeding hops and a very slight butterscotch note. Clean, fresh, medium-long dry aftertaste. An excellent session beer with some complexity and a high level of drinkability."
"Quite similar to Bass in a session-drinking sort of way, but with a decidedly Scottish vibe."
"This beer poured a dark amber color and left a off white bubbly head that left some nice lace.  It had an aroma of hops, malt and a little smokiness.  The flavor was of malt with some smokiness.  The finish was smokey with a dry, slightly bitter aspect to it.  A good beer and will probably have again on tap at my local British pub, Macs."
"A wonderful dark tan color cascading down the glass, with a creamy head.   Very smooth, with earthy flavors upfront.  Bitterness is sublte, but this beer does hand around long enough to let you know it has some presence.  Malty but not too sweet this is a good drinking ale that does not overwhelm you.  A drinking man's beer. (or womens if you like)"
"A solid brew, a good-looker, but weaker flavour than I would imagine.  I recall likeing the bottled version better.  Slight odd, heady aftertaste, but damn good.  Cheers!"
"Drinkability/notes: A very nicely balanced beer. A number of reviewers have praised this ale in the nitro version; this review was based on a 500 mL glass bottle. I suspect that the nitro version is even better."
"Pretty good, smoky, peaty, nutty but qute thin, enjoyable seession beer, but not great, i don't mind drinking it though, just not overly interesting."
"An easy drinking beer.  Good -  but not as impressive as I would have expected"
"Attractive all around in appearance.  The thick head exhibits good retention, and the dark copper hued brew has just a hint of haziness.  The roasted grain notes that dominate the aroma are quite nutty, very biscuity and toast - like.  Fruity yeast esters are subtle, but add to the complexity. Definitely the best aroma I've encountered in a brew this light.  Although light in body, malt flavors abound and are certainly toasty and nutty-- the flavor is similar to the aroma. No surprises.  Hop character is masked by the smooth but pronounced roasted grain bitterness.  The finish is of smooth roasted unmalted barley w/ a touch of hop bitterness.  Belhaven Scottish Ale is a prime example of why lower alcohol brews can be very flavorful.  It's a fine session brew, but is a couple notches below Belhaven's St. Andrews Ale in terms of depth of flavor."
"Personally I like Scottish Ales, and this isn't a bad example of the style, so I can't give it a bad rating."
"Great complexity distinguishes this beer, even with its light body.  When I first had this in a bottle, I fell in love with it.  On tap, my opinion is not quite so high, however.  The nitro makes it a little too smooth, and the reduced carbonic acid removes a key note to the complexity.  Still definitely a great beer."
"Yes!  A Scottish Ale that's a Scottish Ale (rather than a stronger Scotch Ale)...very pleasant creaminess that takes full advantage of the ""nitro-ball""...pleasant but mild floral hoppiness and sweet lightly carmel maltiness...I think the nitro can is put to great use on this one..."
"I never thought I'd give a nitro can 4's across the board, but this beer was really enjoyable.  A light, easy-drinking scottish-style session beer."
"Tired of US craft brewers loose interpretations of this style? This is the real deal. No surprises, just a classic Scottish ale. Ruby colored with a grape-like fruity aroma. In taste, roasted malt and grain are evident, with the same grape-like fruitiness, and an ever so subtle alcohol nip. Slick on the palate typical of the classic ales of the UK. Outstanding."
"Very good example of a scottish ale.  Not too powerful, and quite drinkable. Try it you'll like it. :)"
"Without the nitro, this beer would be just an average ale. With the nitro and it takes on the characters of all other nitros ... an easy drinky, eye-candy pleasing beer. Lovely stuff."
"A gorgeous brown/amber, with a white creamy head.  Head remains strong all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Malty, roasted nuts, smoke and woodey notes."
"Root beer brown with a significant amount of sediment in the bottle.  No date, so it may have been old.  Slightly yeasty with tart malt flavor.  The Wee Heavy is a better choice."
