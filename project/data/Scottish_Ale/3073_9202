3.41,3.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some slight caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the smell is pretty mild.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 18, 2012"

3.13,-4.9,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Pours a nice honey/ruby brown color with a dense khaki colored head that had a nice creamy texture and settled into a nice cap. The aroma is quite faint, some lightly toasted malt and some grains, that is about it. The taste is quite watery but does have a touch of roasted malt qualities, a bit metallic with a tin like bitterness, and some light lemon. The feel is light to moderate with soft to tingly carbonation; finishes dry and astringent, not that pleasant. For a style that should be malty and smooth, this is anything but. The flavors are ok, but the feel is very atringent. Much better samples of the style out there.","Gmann","Apr 18, 2009"

2.88,-12.5,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a medium-brown colored body, with a small tannish colored head. Has a malty aroma, but a very light amount of total aroma. Scotchy smelling. Has a coffee, malty taste, somewhat porterish. Not bad, drinkable.","jujubeast6000","Dec 10, 2008"
3.03,-7.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Poured a nice copper color with decent carbonation, off white head. Nose was kind of sweet but that was about it. Taste was with some syrup, good mlats and well balanced. Taste was not to apprent though, still seemed tasteless other than the syrup. It could have have had more. Mouthfeel was average and not to creamy or impressive. Just malts, grain and some syrup.","barleywinefiend","Nov 24, 2008"
3.35,1.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not bad. Pours clear brown with red highlights and a short off-white head. Caramel and molasses in the aroma, with some smoke. Nutty taste with a fair amount of caramel and toffee. Earthy malt and roasty finish. One of their better non-IPA regulars, but nothing special.","magictrokini","Nov 05, 2008"
3.63,10.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Sample at the Santa Clarita location. This beer pours a dark brown-amber color with a thin beige head that diminishes slowly. Patches of lacing. Pale malt, smoke and mild hops in the nose. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Flavors of smoked malt, caramel and touches of coffee and chocolate. The finish is smoky and leaves an earthy malt aftertaste. Decent overall.","Dogbrick","Sep 13, 2008"
3.55,7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"I'm mostly disappointed with the mouthfeel - there's just not much to go on, and it feels like an American amber ale overall (nothing but love, amber ales!). Maybe from the tap (or cask, I imagine that to be a nice experience) it's a little lusher and fuller, but bottled it's pretty bland.","BretSikkink","Aug 29, 2008"

3.12,-5.2,4,2,3.5,3,3.5,"Caramel brown color, good carbonation and proper modest head. No aroma (what's with Oggi's beers with no smell?). Sweet, grainy malt with brown sugar/molasses notes. Clean finish. No detectable hop character. A small, unremarkable Scottish Ale.","charlzm","Mar 11, 2007"
3.55,7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Served in a pint glass, it's dark orange to amber in color. The scent is semi-sweet, with biscuit and smoke dancing around the more dominaating caramel. Now we move on to the taste, and get more of the same, with a brush of grain and a bready dryness at the end of each sip. Pretty good example of a Scottish Ale.","DoubleJ","Feb 10, 2007"
4.2,27.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at Oggi's Corona, CA location. Poured a light shade of brown with reddish tint to it, and the smell and taste had a nice toasty character to it. The mouthfeel was lighter medium with light carbonation. Not overly complex but delivered a nice malt character.","MiScusi","Mar 09, 2006"
2.66,-19.1,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"On tap at Carmel County Road. no aromas detected. A bit of head and some lace on mahogoney amber body. Molasses and sweet and drinkable, a little bitterness. Carbonation is above average as is most of the line.Did not get much in the way of toast or smoke.","Sammy","Mar 04, 2006"

3.7,12.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The taste of this beer is lightly sweet up front, which leads to a fruity note that lingers through to the end; I get notes of raisins and a hint of cherries. There is a touch of hops throughout; light herbal notes in the flavor and a touch of bitterness that lingers just a bit in the finish. This beer has a soft creamy mouthfeel, despite the slight prickly carbonation. There is a definite toffee note here that is quite nice and a welcome addition to the flavor profile. There is also a light toasted malt note here that seems to be all that is left of the roasted note in the aroma. The beer is light enough to be quaffable, but has just enough heft to it to remain quite interesting. This is a really nice beer that I am definitely appreciating right now.","Gueuzedude","Nov 20, 2005"
3.57,8.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Beer was served ice cold unfortunately, reddish-brown, with very little head. Nose was of sweet caramel malts. Taste was very malty and somewhat nutty and sweet. Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Overall drinkability was good. This beer is worth a shot at least once.","arizcards","Nov 07, 2004"
3.7,12.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a dark reddish/brown little head. Served a bit too cold. Nice malty sweetness. Kind of a dry roasted barley finish. This brew tasted pretty good on this night. Nothing outstanding. Pretty safe brew. I enjoyed this brew with the Italian Stallion pizza. Complimented my pizza well.","SteveO1231","Aug 29, 2004"
3.43,4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours with a burnt amber to brown color. Not much head on the beer but it delivers a sweet and sour aroma with a bit of cherry pit. The flavors is sweet and malty with distinct caramel malts up front. But otherwise it is uneventful. The sweetness does not hold form through the whole taste and the ending is a bit jumbled. It is light on the palate compated to Scottish Ales and would not be something I would order again becuase it is just not that great.","BrewMaster","Jun 15, 2004"
3.95,20.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A medium bodied ale which is silky smooth. This one drinks easy. A minor tingle and it is done. All aspects of this beer are well done.","Rumrunner","Feb 18, 2004"
3.8,15.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer pulled a deep brown with a nice tan head, creamy in texture and the lace a decent sheet. Nice sweet malt nose, caramel, start was sweet and nicely malted with the top moderate in feel. Finish was mild in acidity, the hops purposeful in their spiciness, dry and a nice change of pace from those addictive California IPAs.","Gusler","Sep 12, 2003"
3.88,17.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a very malty beer. It comes in with a ton of caramel flavor, nutty, with some burnt character. Maybe even metallic, in a good way(?) Then it gets really grainy. Personally I liked the graininess. Hop character is mild, just enough to keep the malt from being too sweet. Very smooth and drinkable. Even after the pitcher warmed up, this was one tasty beer.","oggg","Beers"
2.86,-13.1,3,2,3,4,3,"Medium amber color. Aroma is very neutral, only slightly smoke and malts. A medium bodied ale. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are grapefruity, with a touch if cherry and mango? Not a lot of peat or smoke, it tastes more like an amber ale. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","0"
3.85,17,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"M y favorite at Oggi's. This is a good looking beer; absolutely clear dark amber with a tan head that thins out too quickly. The nose is a light malty affair which repeats in the taste. the grain sense from the dark grains also appears in the taste. I noted only very light lacing. This beer was quite smooth and drinkable, but the alcohol may be somewhat higher than listed as it appeared to pack a bit more punch than expected. Just a bit sweet in the finish. Advertised as an export-style Scottish.","AtLagerHeads","0"
