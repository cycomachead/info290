"A light, peaty coloured beer with a thick offwhite head. It has a roasted malt nose with a bot of wood smoke and a slight but rather unfortunate hint of antiseptic. This has a sweet start and is lightly smoky with the influence of oats apparent in a creamy finish."
"O: To me, this beer tastes a lot more like a lighter version of an English Stout compared to a Scottish Ale. The low alcohol content definitely makes this very drinkable."

"O – very nice, enjoyable ale, lot of flavor and it works together, a bit of a thin light body for my taste but still a nice beer that was quite enjoyable. Smooth and tasty. 4"

"I was hoping it would be a tad sweeter like a scotch ale tends to be but I think the honey just totally dries it out to much and doesn't leave enough of a mouthfeel"

"An easy, quick-drinking beer for a session with friends."
"O - Quality beer."
"I would categorize this as a hoppy brown ale. There are darker malt flavors but no burnt sugars. The body is thinner like a brown ale as well. (The server thought this was a stout).   Decent hop presence. "
"Finish is bitter burnt carbon. There is almost something uniquely appealing after a few sips, a ""bright burned character"" but it just doesn't quite make it there. Tastes like someone just ""left it in the oven too long."""
"I had great anticipation for this beer yet it turned out quite boring. Poured a 2"" head. Very dark raw umber in color. Very little smell, even after warmed up, mild coffee at most. Flavor as well was pretty simple and subdued - some mild coffee, a little sour rye, a little acidity. Body was quite lightweight. Surprisingly timid and disappointing considering where where it's from and how dark the brew is."
"Different and very drinkable."
"As a mild, boozier, less fruity and drier than others. Nice feel and hops, but not crazy about the aftertaste."
"Light mouthfeel, almost a bit creamy, but just almost, with a luxurious carbonation with small soft bubbles, refreshing."
"Bottle-Deep, deep brown lets in some light, leaving ruby hues at the rim. Nice stable off white heading in this one. Roasty, coffee bean, cocoa and dark chocolate nose leads into a bitter, roasty, fruit flavour profile with dark chocolate and coffee. Nice and creamy bitter roasty finish. I liked this one."
"D- A standard scottish ale, inoffensive with enough flavour for a session. Simple and effective"
"Pours a fairly dark reddish brown with a somewhat slight head that fades to a ring and leaves some scant lacing. Smells bready and slightly herbal and earthy. A slight hint of honey right at the end. Pretty mellow stuff with lots of breadiness in the mouth and some more very light herbal and honey flavors at the end. There is a slighty ""browned"" taste that makes the whole thing taste like honeyed toast a bit with an herbal tang. Smooth, but a bit lighteer than I'd like in body. My first from the brewery, I'll be sure to try some more."
"Pours a two finger beige head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, faint highlights. Medium carbonation and Medium bodied. Roasted malt nose. Flavor is roasted malt and caramel with honey in the background. $7.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
" a very attractive presentation with a good price."
"A dark brown beer. Has a small off white head leaves tiny traces of lace. Aroma has a smokiness up front with asweet malt backbone and a hint of licorice in the background. The sweet malt notes wash over the tip of your tongue. Then slowly the smoke start to fill your mouth giving way to toffee and coffee. The finish has a roast malt bitterness that becomes smoky then coffee. a tasty smooth drink"
"A good example of its' style. It is low in ABV and quite drinkable. My only qualm would be that it could be fresher or even chewier. Otherwise, a good find."
"OVERALL: Enjoyable and drinkable enough, though nothing memorable. The bitter sweet aftertaste might be a little too much for some. Though this was a fantastic looking pint, I don't think the rest of it would cause me to go out of my way to get it again."
"Overall - A good straightforward example of a Scottish ale.... recommended..."
"D: Not bad. Not my favorite style but drinkable nonetheless."
"The first of three new Scottish beers at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. I tried this beer on March 20, 2008. The beer poured a blackish-brown with a creamy tan head that lasted throughout. The aroma was roasted malt, some licorice hints, and some hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, with medium carbonation, and some sourness on the sides of the tongue. The flavour was malty, and nutty with continued sourness."
"Smokeless Joe's. Basically a good British style porter. Black, not much head. Smooth Stouty roasty, a whisp of smoke and tabacco and licorice. Drinkable, but a sipper. Because minerally finish, it would fare better with some food, as a coffee replacement. Filling."
"Overall, a bit disappointing. This came as a present from Scotland of a pair of Scotch ales. I much preferred the Three Sisters (Atlas brewery) one. This might be better with food."
"I did enjoy it, but one did not leave me with a desire for another, instead I simply moved on to try some of the other beers I purchased. It is very drinkable, but not enough to capture my taste throughout an evening."
"Cask at The Muckle Cross, Elgin, Scotland. Dark mahogany brown with a lovelly thick creamy light tan head. Lightly toasted malts of course dominate the aroma, with stronger bitter black coffee notes. The taste is of rich and bitter maltiness, slightly burnt aspects to it, some coffee and a slightly lactic finish. The mouthfeel was very nice, velvety smooth cask-conditioned. I found this a very nice porter probably improved by the cask, very drinkable"
"I have to say this is my first Scottish ale that wasnt McEwens and I liked it a lot better."
"Honestly, on my first sip, I was a bit put off, but after I started to think of this beer as a sort of Scotch, I really started to like it. Im also really enjoying the finish. With a Scotch, the smoke fades into the alcohol too much, but with the beer, its just you and the peat for quite some time. This ones original and downright amazing."
"This brew poured a dark brown copperish color with a decent tan head that quickly disapated. Nose was very smoky and peaty. Taste was pretty much the same. The barley was probably dried over a mostly peat fueled fire-very unique (to the U.S.) and interesting. Mouthfeel was a bit thin but the beer was very smooth. Overall drinkability was near perfect. I could have easily enjoyed another pint of this!"
"Very dark in clolor-when held to the light theres a beautiful, deep mahogany color. Slight peated malt aroma-some smokiness and sweetness to it. Mellow roasted malt flavor. Some buttery and treacle notes. Very faint peated flavor as well. Nice little astringency that ""works"". Great balance overall between the flavors. Good body. Very, very drinkable. I was looking at the brewerys web sites and fans can post thoughts on their beers. This one is a real favorite and now one of mine. I need to hurry up and get back to Scotland."
"500 ml bottle, bought at Vinens Verden, Odense, Denmark. Very dark brown with a reddish hue, decent light tan head. Moderate but very pleasant aroma of roasted barley and oatmeal, hints of dark chocolate and liquorice, seaweed, tar and woodwork. Roasty flavour with distinct elements of tar and peaty smoke, notes of coffee and dark bitter chocolate. Cant detect the honey, not very sweet. Mouthfeel is acceptable but could have been fuller. Moderate roasty aftertaste. All in all an enjoyable brew."
"Other notes include a taste that was not too sweet as many of the Scotish entries can be and a good lingering of the earthy swill."
"In the aftertaste rises up more sharp the dusty and peated, with even some rhubarb and chicory notes."
"The taste is an intense smokiness of sweet oatmeal. Dry hops finish out the gulp. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but I gave it such a high drinkability for its exceptional taste. I'd like to drink one on a dusty scottish highland."
"My second selection at the Golf Pub in Cupar, Fife. Shiny deep black color. Tight, small wispy tan head. Head faded to bubbles quickly. Slick, smooth appearance. 10W30. Murky, earthy smells, peat akin to the Western Isles Scotch ? Not Sure. More earthy, and woody than the Red Cuillin. Taste is super smooth, full of malt, and full flavored. Lots of sweet malt. Heavy feel, filling going down. I dream of playing the Old Course again in the dreary, fading light. My head buried in my chest against the wind, the rain pelting your back as approach the bridge. A warm smile lifts your spirits thinking of this one waiting inside the Pub. Too bad the Dunvegan doesn't carry it. (P.S. This might be better considered a Wee Heavy)"
