"This poured a translucent copper with a thin white head that dispersed quickly. The nose has a strong dark fruit, prunes, figs and dates, nose as we'll as some dark sugar and malt notes with zero hops to be found. A lot of those same flavours are in the taste along with some roasted nut and bready notes. There is a hint of bitter hops in the back end of the finish. It had a nice medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. A nice scotch ale that was quite enjoyable."

"An interesting, and generally drinkable Scottish Ale, with lots going on, and even exhibiting a few Old Ale impressions along the way.  I'm guessing that the dark monks of titular lore would find this appropriately ""braw 'n nae peely-wally""."
"malt and a toffee sweetness. Another winner from my Craft Beer Advent calendar!"

"O - enjoyable and warming. this one crept up on me"

"Food match: Did someone say butterscotch pudding? No, it's not sweet enough for that, however it would match a nice Medieval banquet with roasted pheasant, terrine of game meats, confit of duck and spiced roasted pig on a spit."

"O- I didn't describe this beer well. It's good, but it's hard for me to tell you why."
""
"O: Enjoyable beer. Goes best with a cold evening."

"The aroma is sweet but the taste is significantly more bitter with caramel hops evolving into a lingering hop finish. Biting to a degree but very nice."
""
""
"Not sure if this wants to be a Big Beer or a sessionable beer. The ABV should say big, but the end result is a sessionable tasting ale, at a non-sessionable ABV"
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Very drinkable, great to sip on."
"This is a good ale. The deep brown color has a head that sticks around. The smell is malty for sure, with some hops in the background. Definitely smells sweet. Big taste, malty and sweet, with the hops and alcohol taking off the edge of the huge malty character. The alcohol is prevalent in the middle and the aftertaste is bitter yet fruity. Buy this, it's good. Not world class, but good."
"O - Very drinkable and I will certainly buy again soon."

"In looking over some of the other reviews, I'll definitely will be on the high end of this beer--2004 and now. In part, I'm going to guess that some drank the beer too cold and too fast, as it changes character significantly as it warms. Or, this beer just matches my palate."

"O - A solid Ale without being spectacular"
"O: Whatever it's meant to be, this beer nails it. Skilfully brewed and recommended, even if it's not my favourite style."
"Not at all cloying. Insanely drinkable and rather on the light end of this particular style of beer."
"Dr: Hides its ABV extremely well, but it's pricey. Overall, I'm unimpressed."
"D- Lovely sipping beer, and a much easier drinker than I had expected @ 7%. I really do quite like it, but it's no Full Curl (bring back the Dall Sheep M-Sun!!!)"
"From reading other reviews, it seems the buttery toffee notes are a common occurrence with this beer. In that case, it's stood up well to the test of time. A sweeter interpretation of the style, but decent."
" D- The bitterness of hops dominates and that doesn't even have the hop flavor to support it. The malt has some floral cleaner quality with the alcohol heat and that makes this a bit tough to get through."
"Drinkability: It started tasting a little hot after a while. Not something I want to drink a ton of."
"Poured into a Duvel Tulip Glass. This beer is a little different in color than I expected. It has the orange/amber glow color as a double IPA or Belgian Pale Ale. Not much clarity to it, it has a creamy white head, but it goes away pretty quickly, not much lacing. The smell is very good, but doesn't really smell too much like a Scottish Ale. Hoppy with some sweet malt flavors, and a little buttery. The taste is a step up, again with the sweet malts, caramelized, a little bit of a butterscotch flavor and a hint of liquorish flavor in my opinion. Grainy taste and has a Hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very good. Full bodied, creamy with a slightly dry finish from the hops. Slight bite, and good carbonation tone, very drinkable. Haven't had it in about 4 years, the first real import I had and what got me interested in trying new beer. Even though I've had many different Scottish Ales in the past, this one is certainly different from the rest. Good beer, I'd recommend anyone to try it."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of grain and cereal with some dry notes and limited sweetness. Taste is also dominated by dry cereal with lightly unrefined grain notes and minimal residual sugars. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. A bit too dry and grainy for my taste."
"D: Despite some unevenness, this is a drinkable beer."
"Pours a caramel color with a big head and some good lace. The aroma is very earthy and woody with a distinct oak and vinous note but the aroma is dominated by ripe red apple. The flavor is nicely earthy and hoppy with some fruitiness and overall very dry and woody. This beer improves quite a bit as it warms, which is wild because I opened it at room temperature. As it warms it gets a much fruitier character with some good caramel maltiness. Palate is nicely full. Tasty."
"D- Excellent scottish malt profile which is not overdone with a clean refreshing hop note in the finish. ABV dangerously hidden.Delicious"
"The beer pours a murky orangish-brown with a white head. The aroma is sweet fruit with some caramel malts. The flavor is very sweet with some caramel and toffee malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Medium-colored and slightly foggy with a deep head, somewhat off-white and large-bubbled; almost like iced-tea with a root-beer-float head. From the first sniff I could tell this would be a good Scottish ale; it has plenty of malt in the aroma with a teeny bit of a sting from hops; perhaps a little bit sour as well. Some caramel and even a little WW bread is present as well. The body is not too dense but there's a enough resistance that it doesn't feel all that thin; low carbonation makes it feel a little heavy as well. Caramel and lightly smokey malt predominate in the taste-- I could have had five of these except at 7% ABV I'd be wobbling across the kitchen in no time. A pint was enough for this evening, but I'll be buying more."
"D: Overall a nice scotch style ale, good on a cold winter's day."
"The best part about this style is that it's usually very accessible to a newcomer. This is a good example that offers an emphasis on malt that is typical for the style. Certainly worth checking this out if you're a fan of the style."
"On the palate, this is coarse with lots of CO2; however, this leaves the palate wet and warm."
"A little heavy but rather drinkable nonetheless. Overall a good representation of the style, though perhaps the bottle had a little too much age on it leading to a level of carbonation a bit too low. Still, an enjoyable start to a very enjoyable evening of good-beer imbibing!"
"Dark amber brown liquid decent lacing. The nose is sweet and a tad simple. It's good, but it's a fairly plain caramelized malt scent. The flavor is really nice. I'm not a big fan of Scottish ales, but this is an enjoyable beer. It's not too sweet or too syrupy, but it's still strong and rich. The flavor reminds of a doppelbock, which I mean as a compliment. The feel is smooth and fairly creamy with only prickling on the back of the tongue. Drinkability is good for me, particularly compared to sweeter versions of the style."
"Just arrived at the store today. Therefore I had to give it a try. The beer pours a dark amber with a finger-thick, off-white head that settles to a fine film on the top. Lacing is nice, but has a bit of a soap suds look to it. The nose is sweet, with a nutty character and hints of caramel. The flavors of this brew are better than the nose. It starts nutty with caramel and brown sugar, but finishes pleasantly dry. This beer is full bodied, and yet does not overwhelm the palate. It's a solid brew, and definitely worth trying."
"The taste is raisiny and fruity with a hint of rum, caramel, leafy and ctirsuy, a mostly fruity-grainy, raisiny sweetness with light hoppy bitterness taking over in the end along with hints of bitter chocolate and coffee."
"Really cool appearance, and a biting nose. Strong, full, distinctive flavor. Solid feel. Really good quaff."
"Drinks pretty easy, This drinks more like an American Strong Ale IMO. Still a nice one to sip one cool December evening"
"It pours rich and brown with hints of amber. The bottle was a bit pricey, but well worth it! I don't know of many places around here that serve this beer but any time I see it be sure I will become a regular at that bar!"
"Drinks easy enough. Overall a decent beer, nothing fantastic, but solid."
"500ml brown bottle from Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a hazy copper body with a half inch of slowly dissipating off-white head. Smells sweet, bready, and buttery. Tastes sweet, toasty, grassy, buttery, with caramel, brown sugar, and bready notes. Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. Fairly drinkable for the style. A tasty solid one for sure - not too much wrong here."
"Pours a nice dark amber/copper color with good head, a lot of initial carbonation, and a bit of lacing. Nice scent, very deep, more smoke with less peat, and a lot of malt. Mixture of tastes, there's a definite maltiness, a deep smokey flavor, a burst of sweetness (as a milk stout), followed by more smoke and a not very well covered alcohol hit. It does go down fairly smooth for a higher ABV brew, though."
"Drinkability here is good. I'll be getting some more of these and its worth a try. The whole beer makes me feel like it was crossed between two styles, Wee Heavy and Scotch Ale."
"Drinkability seems just a tad lower than everything else, as it's got a roughness that edges out the milder elements...and that hop bitterness is strong for the style. It's almost like a Scottish Ale/IPA hybrid. No matter, it's plenty enjoyable, and I wouldn't think twice about picking it up again."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer overall. I wouldn't call it a Strong Scotch Ale by any means, but it may classify as some sort of Wee Heavy or some such. I expect these beers to be more of a dessert-like experience, but this one starts to walk the line to the South and come in like a bitter. Anyway, it is a decent beer to drink."
"Tasted on 1/27/08"
"Drinkability was solid due to the unique, rich combination of flavors that really hit home... In addition, the 7% ABV is pretty well-masked behind an intricate combination of wonderful flavors... Recommended..."
"I'll be done with this 500ml in a heartbeat, it was a real pleasure to drink."
"The beer pours a murky brown caramel color into my snifter with visible yeast and a short head. Caramel, berries, and smoked wood appear to be the flavors of the day in this beer. Cabonation is extremely light, though it could be a sign that the bottle I got was old. Not bad overall, but it's likely better fresh."
"This is one of the more powerful Scottish ales I've had (not to be confused with a Scotch Ale), and it does a nice job of blending the rich malts and caramel character with a nice subtle dose of English hops. The aroma is sweet and inviting, and the mouthfeel is delightfully smooth and full. The alcohol is masked to the point where it's undetectable; impressive considering this is 7%. Overall a very nice job."
"Could hardly believe this was 7% from the bottle I had. Nice, drinkable and enjoyable. I might want a bit more malt or smokiness in my scottish ales, but this one was still quite enjoyable."
"Thanks to bruskiator for letting me try this one. Lots of smoke, lighter color than expected, nice tan head, burnt roasted malts noticeable in the taste and smell. lots of maltiness (peat?). not one of my favorites of this style, a bit hard to finish a pint."
"This beer poured a cloudy brown/burnt orange color. It had a big rocky head which quickly dissipated. The smell is malty with caramel and smoke aromas present. The taste is mostly of malt. There are some hints of bitterness and slight smoke as well. The mouthfeel is full and seems quite appropriate. Overall, this is a nice flavorful brew that Id consider solid."
"Best before date of Nov 2007.Pours into my tall Starfleet academy pilsner glass.A deep very old dirty penny color with minimal bubbles at best.Got a strange amount of floating sediment throughout the glass,not a bad thing,just was not expecting it.Smells like a brown Belgian to me.Ripe fruitiness seems to overpower the maltiness that i was expecting from a ale from Scotland.The carbonation is on the lighter end and the taste was close to what i smell.It tastes like a light brown Belgian with the minimal malting i wanted from the champion beer of Scotland 2002.If i drank this at a blind taste test i would have never guessed a Scottish ale.It is very drinkable and smooth.After it warms a bit the 7% gives it just a little bit more warming character that is ver pleasant."
"D: Good drinkability."
"This is a very nice Scotch ale. It pours a deep reddish amber, plenty enough cloudy, with a good head, good lacing, and very moderate carbonation. The smell is sweet malts, a little whisky, burnt sugar, and some other floral sweetness. The taste is full bodied, brown sugar, sweet whisky, burnt malts, perhaps a little burnt straw too, maybe some molasses with a raisiny flavor. Although this beer has loads of malts, there is some hoppy balance too, the aftertaste is not cloying sweetness, but it is a warming alcohol on the tongue. The mouth feel is a bit heavy, and you would think this beer closer to 10 ABV with its heaviness, and alcohol in the aftertaste. If you like the burnt sugary malt flavors of a Scotch ale, then you will like this ale. It doesn't have as much of the burnt flavor as other Scotch ales I've tasted, and it is a little sweeter, but it is still a nice representation of the style. L'Chaim."
"D: It a bit on the heavy side but taking that into account, I can envision drinking more of this. If only I could find more of it."
"M&D: as this is an unfiltered ale (judging from the sediments left in the bottle), the mouthfeel is really fresh and soft, not fizzy or artificial at all. Despite its alc. strength, the tremendous hop bitterness and burnt flavour both render it a more-ish and quaffable drink. The flavour doesn't boast as much toffee and peat-smokeness as many of its counterparts, but the end result is all the same - solid and delicious. A lovely crossing b/w ESB and Scottish Ale."
"One of the better Scottish ales I've had. This almost borders on a Wee Heavy, but is still light enough to be drinkable but not heavy."
"New to BC, this is another great Scot beer that really puts forth the malty goodness. An opaque dark brown with a fine head this beer has nose full of quality malt and brown sugar. The beer packs a punch with big notes on the front and back. The balance is there but I love the bigness of the beer. Most definitely worth a purchase if you can find it."
"pours out of the half litre bottle a cloudy amber colour. thin fine head with little lacing. malty aroma...choco, caramel, figs...some plum and prunes, too. some floral hoppiness, too. all of it subdued but very nice. interesting flavours in the taste profile. the first thing i notice is how heavily hopped this scottish ale is. very surprising is the bitterness. there are some smoky/burnt notes...alcohol pepperiness, and some caramel/toffee undertones. kind of scattered and not really well balanced. the body is medium and the mouthfeel seems thinnish for the style. lingering bitterness in the finish. drinkability suffers for the fact that it's just not a well balanced scottish ale. and it's way over hopped for the style. cool looking label with the mad looking friar cooking up a batch of brew."
"Very Scottish take on a doppelbock type brew, a little one-sided and overly sweet, but that gives it points for truth to style. I tend towards the darker side of Scottish ales, but this one is a good counterpoint to a British Extra Strong Bitter. Depends on your fancy."
"Notes: I was surprised by this brew as it was pretty bold compared to those I've tried in this style. If the malt bill had a bit more complexity this would be a staple in the fridge. For now its a purchase when I see it. I'm on a roll tonight, 2 great beers that crack my top 200 in one night? Yep, this is worthy."
"Usual amber color-nice small head. A fair amount of floaties in this one. Ok aroma-somewhat metallic and copper smelling. Solid malt flavored beer. Slight caramel flavor and a slight oak taste. Some bitterness in the finish-somewhat sharp tasting overall. Smooth and creamy body. A notch above average. Lose the sharpness to it-it gets quite in the way for me. Otherwise quite enjoyable."
"Overall, a very nice brew. Wish I had more. While not a session beer due to the alcohol, it is quite drinkable and nicely warming."
"Overall this brew is different from any I have had. EXTREMELY malty and full-bodied. Not something I would go out of my way to get again, but it was definitely worth the try."
"A very nice example of the genre. Would certainly recommend it and will make sure to have a couple bottles around for those Saturdays in, listening to smooth jazz while relaxing in that old sweatshirt. Check it our & chill out."
"Overall a very enjoyable Scotch Ale. Rich and malty with a nice hop balance. Alcohol really kicks in the back-end and reinforces that this is a sipping beer. Very nice."
"This is really good, it's too bad it was kind of expensive ($4.75). Still, I could see this when in the mood for something different."
"A coppery luminescent amber ochre hue greets me with a slight off-white. MIld bubbling and a through and through head. The aroma is a strong malt. Not overpowering or gfake smelling. Good toasty malts make me think of baking bread or coffee cake. The taste is nice and smokey in the front. Very evident. I like the tosty middle, like sweet tea biscuits. The fifnish is just smooth malted grains. The palate is sweet, smooth, and chock full o' malty goodness. A little burn felt in the front of the tongue too. Nice Scottish ale."
"Pours lightly-sedimented dull copper after a very careful decanting. No head and sparse lace. Smells of rich and slightly smoky caramel malts with a strong and spicy alcohol base. Heavy with complex flavors. Nuts and caramel lead the way, but are balanced with earthy and leafy yeast notes. Finish is laced with peppery dark fruit alcohols. Oily and syrupy thick body with minimal carbonation."
"A nice higher-shilling ale, with well-hidden alcohol. As with any good Scottish ale the emphasis is definitely on the malt, but not to the point of excess or total lack of balance. Great complexity and smooth drinking."
"A clean coppery brown beer. Has a small creamy beige head. A nice aroma of dried fruit, figs and raisins, and a hint of chocolate. With a strong threat of alcohol in the background. A light sweet caramel and dried fruit note runs over your tongue quickly. Followed by the alcohol and a bitter tabaccco like finish."
" Ill have to check other reviews to see if this is a common thing."
"Rich fruit notes greet my taste buds from the get go, sweet concentrated notes of plum move to full on prune as well as enticing notes of fig. The beer finishes with rum like notes of alcohol and sweet, yet fermented molasses. Something here definitely reminds me of a sticky, yet fully caramelized sticky bun. I also can't help but think a dark, darker than I have ever had, brown sugar. While the malt notes are rich and concentrated, this beer still manages to finish a bit on the thin side, though only at times. A touch of roasted, slightly burnt flavors add a touch of balance and even bitterness to the finish of this beer."
"Comments: Not my favorite of the style. Too thick & cloying. The alcohol notes are overly present."
"Pours dark burnt orange, not so cloudy and a nice hue. Good carbonation, bubbly, effervescent head with some decent lacing as well. Smells of a nice blend of malts with coffee, caramels, smokiness. Taste follows suit, good flavors and the blend is nice and easy. Smooth transitions of flavor with maltiness, sweetness, and smokiness that pleases the palate. I would definitely have this one again."
"Blackfriar Scottish Ale pours a hazy dark orange with an off white, fluffy head. The aroma really gets me, just a great smelling beer. Malty and even citrusy smell. Any beer that smells this good is likely to taste good too, so here goes... mmm, this is excellent. Everything I like in a beer, strong bold flavors that balance well with each other. Strong malt flavor but balanced with hops that assert themselves at the right time and in the right amount. An excellent beer."
"Drinkability is good a great sipping brew that warms your body and soul. Not your average Scottish Ale it is different but sometimes thats a good thing."
"Drinkability: A most intriguing but unusual beer; the lack of hops on the nose leads to a total surprise when they kick in on the finish"
"This Scottish ale is a great sipper that's best enjoyed slow and not over chilled."
"Scottish malty goodness is what I find in this amber to light brown ale. This ale has a wonderful biscuit-like aroma. It smells like my homebrewery does while I'm mashing the grain. The head falls to about an eighth-inch collar of foam enhancing the appearance. The body is full, which to me, is an important quality in a stronger Scottish ale. The brew is all about the cookie or biscuit-like malt flavors mixed with a nutty character and a touch too much bitterness for the style but I'm guessing some of that might come from amber or roasted malts. Despite some style issues and possible over-hopping, this is a damn fine ale."
"Mellowed scotch taste. Nice colour, some scotch aroma. My mates liked it a bit, but not very much. 2002 bottle moving from big stores to small stores. Moderate representative of the style. Had hops, but could use more something to enrichen taste. Light mouthfeel."
"A pretty darn good Irish Ale. Love the name. Poured out to a autumn red / amber color with a tiny head. Lower carbonation. Minor notes of lacing in the glass. Aroma of hops and roasted malts, with some sweetness. Also, for some reason, this beer made me think of an IPA, like there was a hidden hop somewhere in the mix. Taste is solid; flavors of hops, caramel, wood and toasted malt go amazing well together. Mouthfeel was kind of syrupy and thick, but still very palateable. Drinkability is fair; I probably wouldn't drink this everyday, but when I was in the mood for a Scotch Ale, this would be it."
"Very good beer for sure I would try again!"
"Quite deeply red in color, scummy lace. Toasty aromas of moist, malty bread and nuts with links to roasted herbs. Cherry and redcurrant jam fruits mount on the first drink. Bitter, burnt sugars can be compared to Italian nougat or Scottish toffee. Tangy brown spices and parroasted coffee beans join with seasoned hardwood and nutshells. A mouthful is big and round without any sense of syrupy malt. Rooted tarry bitterness muscles fragrant fruits and spices. Beautifully dry and poundable."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick creamy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It is sweet, yet dry. The taste is good. It has a warm, roasted malt flavor that is slightly sweet with crystal malts and dry on the finish. It has an elevated abv., but it's well hidden. The malt bill is not that complex. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It has good flavor and nice warm feel."
"The color is dark copper with an average-sized, light brown head. The aroma is of dark earthy malts with a strong dark fruit smell. A sip has an initial dark fruit bite that melds into dark earthy malts. A light sugary sweetness is noticed in the finish. A touch of hops balances this out and adds another layer of flavor. Drinkability and mouthfeel are very good. Strong scores across the board here, recommended."
"If I reset my expectations and my palate and think of this as a pale ale brewed by Scots and not as a Scottish ale, granting scores becomes much easier. Lia Fail, its lower ABV brother, is better beer in my opinion. You won't be sorry you bought Blackfriar. Just keep an open mind when you open the bottle."
"Drinkability  aftertaste takes the drinkability down a bit since it carries the strong bitterness into the next experience; the initial smoothness helps the cause"
"I think you will be pleased with this brew if you normally like scottish ale."
"This liquid is a hazy brown with a lightly reddish hue and a thick, cream-colored head. Its aroma is appropriately sweet and malty, with a doughy, break-like quality and a roasted-smokey undertone. Its a pleasing, well-positioned smell that starts the beer off right. Theres also a little alcohol in the smell, which transfers over into the taste. The beer is relatively sweet, with a big bitterness running through it. The finish is particularly bitter, with some hop flavor as well. Its a simple, well-made, satisfying beer."
"It's hazy dark-chestnut body has a deep ruby cast and reveals glowing crimson highlights beneath it's frothy head of tan. The head retention is quite good (especially considering it's alcohol content), and it leaves some very nice spots and splashes of lace about the pint. Smooth and mildly creamy across the palate, it's very fine and natural carbonation helps to enhance it's maltiness. It's firm bitterness, however, is wide and unyielding - anchoring it and leading to a drying, semi-sweet and bitter finish that lingers with notes of burnt caramel. Floral, grassy, and leafy hops swirl here-and-there throughout it's deeply caramel accented, toffee-ish, toasty, nutty, slightly candy-sweet, and subtly roasty maltiness; bringing it to life and lending it a delicate charm that leaves it amazingly drinkable. It's not overly complex, but the interplay between the hops and the rich maltiness is exquisite. Finally, fruity notes from the yeast surface almost immediately as it warms, and lend another level to it's character; leaving it as an almost perfect session ale! And the only thing that hinders that is it's alcohol content of 7%, which is entirely cloaked throughout the first serving at the very least. Impressive!"
"This came in a 500ml bottle. Pours out a fairly hazy deep amber color with about one inch of tan foamy head forming on top. The head dropped quickly but left thick rings of lace around the glass. Malty sweetness in the aroma with fruits and chocolate being most dominate. Also in the nose was a nice smokiness that mixed well with the sweetness, but overall the aroma was a bit mild. Taste starts of with a big fruity sweetness that is mixed with a bit of caramel and chocolate. The smokiness is quite noticeable in the taste as well. Mouthfeel was a little lighter than expected. Pretty drinkable stuff here with the nice mix of flavors. Pretty solid beer that I would definitely pick up again."
"The body is a clear, medium reddish brown. The head is thick, dense, and lasting. It's an attractive beer. The aroma is slightly spicy hops, cake-like malt and a bit of apple. The flavor is very low in bitterness (as it should for the style), with an apple peel flavor that sets off the mellow malt nicely. This is extremely drinkable. Not a bad beer by any means."
"Quite malty and dry but very hoppy as well with notes of various dark fruits, pine, toasted malts and deep caramel. Odd."
"This brew is a somewhat hazy brown/orange color, with a tiny white head. The scent is mainly caramel malt with some citrus aspects from the hops. Bitter hop whack when the brew hits the tounge, slight alcohol flavor, some spice/pepper taste, mild malts. Medium bodied. Pretty good overall but im not left craving another one."
"Drinkability was quite high, would be better if the smell & taste were more pronounced. Still, a good beer."
"16.9 ounce bottle. I this is 7%, then I need 7% all the time. No alcohol presence to note, only smooth complex flavors."
"Drinkability: Wow, what can I say?! A beautifully crafted Scottish ale. This beer makes me want to don my tartan, pick up some bagpipes, and wander from glen to glen on a brilliantly sunny fall day, declaring the joy and pleasure of this ale. Small wonder it won Best Beer of Scotland in 2002. Aye, summ'un haand me unotha! (But be careful: the abv is 7%!)"
"Very clear chestnut in color with a thin, light tan head. Not much of an aroma at first, but as with most examples of this style, the toasted malt comes through more strongly as the beer warms. Full mouthfeel with hints of diactyl and a big malt profile. A bit rough in the finish, but overall pretty satisfying."
"I found this beer very easy to drink and liked it a lot..couldnt really detect the alcohol..but give me 4 or 5 and I am sure i would be buzzed!"
"The colour of dark tea. however, this brand of tea produces a pretty big head which is tan. Funk and caramel are the odors it represents. Tastes smooth. Big full and soft on the palate, there are notes of molasses present. A bit tart on the finish. Quite the good drinking big beer."
"Clear ruby topped by a rocky off white head with respectable retention. Lace remains. Soft esters of a red apple nature along with mellow notes of carob and dark toffee are prevalent in aroma. Trace floral hop and butterscotch hints. Well rounded and understated aromawise. In flavor, the dominant malt impression is of molasses sweetened whole grain biscuit. Diacetyl undertone adds an agreeable richness complementary to the static, mild caramel malt presence. Hints of roasted barley along with the light hop bitterness facilitate a transient drying sensation, which is superceded by an agreeable surge of buttery dark chocolate and nutty brittle mid palate. A touch too light in body to match malt character, but dangerously drinkable as a result. Finishes mostly clean, with hints of treacle and woody hops fleeting quickly. Quite a tasty and well crafted brew that's intermediate in character between an 80 Shilling and Wee Heavy. Superbly drinkable and soft on the palate. Very tasty."
"Drinkability & Notes: Close to a meal in a bottle, certainly a malt lovers brew."
"The taste was of complex malts and a niticeable alcohol aftertaste. Exactly what a good Scotch ale should be. It was a little too strong on the alcohol for me (I prefer it to be masked by the other flavors). Still, a good beer overall."
"The body was a little thin for me. I was hoping to have a thicker smoother drinking beer from this one, but it was a little light and bubbly going down."
"Clearish red caramel brown color, small compact beige head lifts slowly up then back down to a thin skim and rough collar where the lacing moslty sticks in small spots and globs. Aroma has lots of soothingly calm caramel, a bit of roasty/toasty toffee, quite soft and inviting overall and rounds out with brown sugar and maple syrup notes. Taste has small and easy front, a bit empty, smooth and gentle caramel work there way in around midway. Some toastier factions come to play with a toffee roast and hard grain breadyness. Hops help finish it off with a leafy and dried variant thats biting more so in texture then with bitterness. Keeps its toasty edge fairly long and even later smaller efforts of the caramel make their way through too. A long holding finish. Feel starts out light and smooth with a gradual building base of malts and toast and a eager little finish with a good lasting quality that was the clincher for me into liking it. But it could have a bolder, richer body throughout, it really only has a strong hold towards the finish and within the finish. Still enjoyable enough for a Scotch Ale. I have to keep reminding myself its not a wee heavy scotch which I like much more then these regular ones."
"Clear and lightly reddish brown. The head is slightly weak, kind of gives up after a few seconds. Stringy lace. Smells of maple sugar, malty in most aspects. Starts light in mouthfeel, gets heavier in the stomach, a weird sense of released carbonation to me. Taste is fine across the board, malt-defined and moving in a spiced caramel direction. Finishes up at the back with a touch of crocus-like bittering. A bit of cashew nutiness on later sips. Pretty good, the texture seemed a bit off for me, and its a little on the one note side."
"The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth and rich, boasting a medium body with mild carbonation. Easy to drink, delightful to taste. Great for drinking at the end of a meal in lieu of dessert, as this itself is quite a tasty treat."
"Pours a white, one finger-head leaving a nice lace. Nice clear amber color. Good carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is raeson/cider. Starts malty and sweet, finishes with a good mix of hops and malt but a slight bitter/hoppy aftertaste. $4.20 for a 500ml bottle."
"Deep amber, borderline mahogany color. A thin veil of foam and a tad bit of lace throughout. Aromas run deep, and rich with caramel malt-dark roast-taking the lead. A toasty/sweet malt component chimes in as well. A chunky mouthfull of brew here-full bodied and almost chewy in texture. Flavors are deep and brooding with gobs of buttery caramel-dark roast again, and a very strong black coffee like bitter coming from the hops. The brew is almost sweet in flavor, and it is very extracted and concentrated, almost ice-bock like in flavor, but milder. The finish continues well into the two minute zone! Not a slammer, but one to kick back with and savor. Gracious-Shelton"

"Thanks Genaro!"
"Pours a nice bronze color with a light soapy head,great fruity aroma,fruit just bursting real nice.Taste is more malt tilted wich I expected nice and fruity with a light hop bitterness that comes thru more as it warms along with a light earthiness.Seems to be a tad watery but really drinkable for the alcohol content,a nice find."
"500ml bottle. Poured a dark amber, with a moderate head, that very quickly fades leaving very little lacing behind. Aroma of malt and hops, and very little else. Taste is caramel and malt with the hop twang that is kind of overpowering for style. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation and smooth. As a stand alone it is a very good beer, and fairly well balanced, but to me not really like the style."
"Pours into my nonik glass, which is the perfect size for 500 ml of beer and a nice sized head, a burnt sienna colored brew. Very nice looking. The white head stays pretty well for a while, but then all but disappears. Caramel malt and sweet orange citrus in the aroma along with a toasted character. Hop crispness is ever-present as well. Caramel and lots of grain on the tongue, plenty of crisp hop bite too. Hints of peat are noticeable here and there. Hops are of rind-like character, and they come out a bit more than the malt in most places, making for a very crisp brew all around. This kind of hopping you don't find often outside of the States. A very enjoyable beer, but I'd pick Belhaven's over this one for the style (out of what I've had, we don't get many Scottish ales here in Arizona, or Scotch ales for that matter, much to my chagrin). Actually, this is almost more like an ESB. Disregarding that, a pleasure to drink. Recommended."
"The beer debouches from the 500ml bottle an unclouded burnished copper color with a planetary size head that is creamy in texture, the color a light tan, as it evaporates, and the lace forms a sticky and clinging sheet upon the glass. Malt dominates the nose, sweet, crisp and fresh, hints of caramel, a tad earthy and the start nicely malted, somewhat sweet, top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is brisk in its acidity, the hops forceful in their spiciness, very dry aftertaste that lingers long on the palate, a quite nice Scottish Ale."
"Part of me wanted something fuller and thicker, for it feels a bit mild in texture and body at times, resulting in easy drinkability, for sure. Part of me, too, is just pleased aspunch by this beer as it is. (Though for $5 per 500ml bottle, I do feel that I over paid on this item, and probably won't go back for more.)"
"A winner."
"Similar yet very different that I had expected, but it still covers the required topics. The extra hopping is merely a bonus. Find it if you can. And buy a few."
"New to my local beer store. Comes in a 550ml bottle. Pours a beautiful shiny coppery brown color. A small head that leaves incredible lace. The taste is immediately dry but goes away. The finish is dry but just right. Taste is malty but a little more hops comes through than some other Scottish ales I have tried(not that many). This is a good beer worth trying no matter what your tastes."
