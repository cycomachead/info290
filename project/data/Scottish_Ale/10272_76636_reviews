"Overall: a good beer that should stand out primarily for its unique flavors and secondarily for its unique story. I wouldn't drink it everyday, but I would be lying if I said I didn't like it."

"Tastes just like the front label says. Definitely has a scotch whiskey taste to it as well. Well done."
""
""
""

""

"Haven't had in a long time but as good as I remembered. Love the golden amber color in the bottle and in the glass. The smell was very scotch. I did get the vanilla and butterscotch aromas. The taste was even better. More of the same plus some honey."

"3.14/5:Best I&G beer I've had to date, but that isn't saying a whole lot"
"The flavor of vanilla and toffee makes this one of my favorite beer."
"This is a very tasty, unique beer. I really enjoy all of the Innis & Gunn lineup, with this being the most straightforward choice. The vanilla, toffee and oak promised on the label come through in both the aroma and the taste. I sampled this from a 750 mL bottle, which was quite reasonably priced, considering the quality of this beer."
"Not a bad tasting brew. Wasnt the most pleasant smell, but after the first sip it wasnt that bad. You can definitely taste the hint of vanilla and oak. Quite a sweet beer. I would drink this again."
"330 ml bottle into snifter, best before 4/2015. Pours slightly hazy bright orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toasted bread, vanilla, oak, apple, plum, herbal, light pepper, and herbal/oaky earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toasted bread, vanilla, oak, apple, plum, herbal, light pepper, and herbal/oaky earthiness. Light herbal/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toasted bread, vanilla, apple, plum, oak, light pepper, and herbal/oaky earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good oak aged Scottish ale style. All around good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. This is a bit lighter in body and flavor than the Rum barrel version, but is still nicely enjoyable."
"Everything about the Innis & Gunn beers are a very humble above average.  Excellent beers."
""
"Very good beer overall, great unique fresh smoky feel."
""
""
""
"It's probably worth mentioning that this is now bottled in brown, rather than clear, bottles."
"Not bad for a first time taste"
""
""
""
"Clear red colour, poor retention. Caramel, whisky, vanilla, wood. Why so watery with so much ABV?! And why those white bottles that can only damage beer inside? Not bad, but dissapointing. There are many more finer Scottish Ales."
""
"Smells and tastes like a Dewars Lager blend.  Not bad if these are the tastes you're looking for.  Good oak smell amongst the scotch smell."
"Sweet earthy weed nose similar to an English ipa. Sweet bourbon/oak flavor followed by a cheap booziness. Sweet bourbon aftertaste."
""

"Very smooth and very tasty. Easy to drink and a nice big bottle"
"Some nice vanilla notes and a slight oaky flavour that adds a little extra to the body of the beer."
""
"Lovely texture and flavour"
""

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 9C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L4153 18:18. AROMA: sweet malty aromas with some cask notes and faint vanilla and toffee. low hop aromas. APPEARANCE: dark golden color and translucent. thin head of slight ivory color with poor retention. TASTE: malty flavour with some cask notes. low bitterness with a semi-sweet finish. PALATE: medium-low body with low carbonation. OVERALL: a just slight different tasting bulk beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a tasty and rather different beer with a disappointing look but a satisfying peaty whisky vanilla theme that makes me want to try it again even though I wasn't blown away by it. Interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Gloriously sweet, rich and complex. A dessert beer from good 'ol Scottland that unfolds a many-layered swirl of honey, caramel, vanilla, pastry, biscuit and some exotic tropical fruit and spices, all balanced masterfully on a fine thread of acidity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is much sweeter than the the whiskey cask, which tastes more balanced, but more complex than the original. A decent showing from Innis & Gunn."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful orange color. Skunky aroma in the bottle. Weak head. Medium, creamy body with candy aroma and a sweet (but not malty) oak flavor. Sharp finish. Overall, a nice barrel aged brew that I would have again, but probably not more than 1 in an evening."

"I really have a soft spot for this beer as one of the first beers ever that I really liked. The appearance is a dark orange, almost honey color with very little head. The smell has a little wood and a lot of sweet smells like vanilla. The taste is incredibly smooth with hints of toasted malt and a little bit of hops at the end for a refreshing finish.  Definitely still love this one."

"This is a pleasant Scottish ale – not too sweet, not too malty. The vanillin and diacetyl are both subdued and add a nice subtext to the typical maltiness of a Scottish ale."

"330ml transparent bottle. Snifter glass. Bright copper color, clear appearance. White & close crown lasts as a thin layer on top. Yeasty, candy, sugar & alcohol aromas, solvent notes to he nose rounded by cumin & toffee hues on the deep backside. Crispy, herbal & phenolic upfront. Medium to full body. Moderate to soft carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Spiced touch, vanilla cream & anise flavors are displayed in the middle, peppery & sugary flavors as well.. Long sweetish finish is touched by subtle woody hints. Kind heat & slight fruity on the aftertaste. As it warms intense vanilla, toffee & ripe apricot are felt."
"O: Delicious beer that would pair well with food. Reminds me of a cross between a lager and scotch whiskey. Love the oak nature of this beer. Great to see it in a can."

"Grabbed a mixed 4 pack of Innis and Gunn beers, because, well, I am Scottish so what the hell. Good looking beer with an, I guess interesting smell. Not sure what to make of it. Taste is similar, not exactly what I expected from a scotch ale, but tasty. Overall, a pretty good beer but not one I will revisit regularly due to cost, plenty of better beers for less."

"I was takin back when I saw this. I was at a trade show and the only female rep that was their was the innis & gunn rep. So obviously I went over and when I started trying her product I was dumb founded to day the least. I tried the original the porter the rum aged and the Canadian chereywood limited edition and their were all amazing. And since than I make sure to keep them in my fridge at all times it's hard to get sometimes cause the distributor doesn't always have it in stock but I say when your at your local liquor store and you see anything with the innis & Gunn name on it buy it you will not be disappointed at all"

"O = Delicious and unique. The 6.6% alcohol is perfect. Not an everyday beer, but one I will seek out again. As for food, it would pair with rich cheeses or even a spicy barbeque, and would accompany flavorful fatty foods well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- sweet and sweet with smoke and alcohol"
""
""
"330 ml. bottle. Amber to red colour, with a minimal head that vanishes too soon. Smell like a damp cellar with spider webs, oak, whisky, Maybe some vanilla or something, but it's buried under the whisky. Light palate, taste of whisky, oak and spices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: to me, this is unique among BA beers.... if you're expecting something huge in flavors of alcohol or whiskey/port/calvados/blahblahblah, this is not what this is about.... not many straight oak-aged beers I can think of aside from the I&G...."
""
""
""
""
" Deviate from the norm with these Scottish Cask brews!"
""
"O = not style I think I'm particularly fond of, but certainly an interesting experience. I've not had a beer with a flavor profile like this before. Recommended to try once, at least. If only it was in a darker bottle..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty brew that has a beautiful combination of flavors."
""
""
""
"Original is right—on one side, it’s a straight-up malt bomb that is balanced by some hopping. On the other side is its strength and oak aging, which ends up being quite complex. A great pick if you are looking for something outside of the norm."
""
""
"O: I found this to be one of the more enjoyable beers in the style that I have tried because it was not overly sweet or overly boozy - the flavors of the oak and the vanilla were really nice and the alcohol was fairly well hidden. I was happy to not get any skunky flavors/aromas considering the beer is in clear glass bottles."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brilliantly clear deep golden color with a huge bubbly off white head that slowly dissipates to a cap on top. Aromas of oak tannin and a hint of vanilla penetrate my nostrils as soon as I more the glass nearer to my face. Earthy almost apple pie spice with hints of caramel and mineral water round out the nose. Little to no hop aroma. The flavor is big on the fruits apple, pear and cinnamon initially. Light caramel and brown sugar gives way to oak tannin and vanilla. Little to no hop flavor or bitterness. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet light sugary mouthfeel. Not a bar beer per se, but not something I really enjoyed much."
""
""
""
"I love the appearance it just looks like a great beer! The smell is not to my liking and smells to me like a cheaper beer of which this wasn't that inexpensive. Almost smells like PBR. The feel/ finish of the beer is my favorite part. It ends with a beautiful honey taste and leaves the tongue feeling like it was just covered in a thin layer of honey. This made this beer very appealing to me. It may not sound appealing and I would agree but it actually was a good part of this beer. taste whys I honestly cannot tell if I like this beer. It is a difficult decision. It's a bit of a heavier beer so definitely not a session beer. Again, the taste is so hard to tell, the first pat of the sip isn't the best but then it gets sweeter and turns to honey. Totally unique and different from any other beer I've had. I do like. Would I buy it again? Maybe, hard to say. maybe would get it again on a cold night where I just want to sit and rest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was surprising to say the least. Sweetness everywhere! This seemed really balanced and had really strong scents and flavors, but to me, this was jus too sweet. Glad I had it, but I'll probably never buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice oak aged beer that displays the barrels nicely. Not to much in the way of the barrel, so it really shines through. A good dessert beer because of the sweetness, but not a bad any-time beer either"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!!"

"Overall, I found this beer interesting due to the vanilla flavour. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to purchase this beer to bring home, but I would not be bothered if it came along for the ride as part of a variety pack."
"It had a nice oak flavor to it, but the problem was that this oak flavor was largely masked by a distinct toffee taste. If you are a toffee lover than this might be an amazing beer. I certainly am not one of those people. I didn't really enjoy it, and it was wasn't cheap even for craft beer. I won't be buying more."
"Overall I always like these beers and can't wait to try the whisky version. Tasty as all hell."
""
"Final Grade: 3.93, a solid B+. Innis & Gunn Original Oak Aged Beer won't blow your mind, but if you're in the mood for an affordable, no-nonsense barrel-aged brew, this is the old standby that I have returned to again and again. This canned version is only a slight improvement over the clear bottles we've been stuck with previously, due to the lack of skunking. I can understand why some people aren't so big on this beer - with all the sweet notes and relative lack of hop balance - but I still have a soft spot for this stuff, and most people I offer it to seem fairly satisfied with it. In any event, it's well worth a try."
""
""
"O - The Innis & Gunn Original has nice barrel aging flavors but I find it could use a bit more hops. Otherwise it's an easy drinking brew with an ABV that's surprisingly well hidden."

"This is a nice, malty scottish ale. It's very easy to drink. The only downside to this beer is that its purely malty with little else save some oak for complexity. On the plus side this beer didn't have any of the skunky character I actually expected from a clear-bottle import."
""
""
""
"Still, it's a compromised product, and it gets scored as such because it's totally preventable if they used better bottles or packaging. Won't be buying anymore Innis & Gunn till they fix this."
""
"Overall great beer I will definitely have it again."
""
""
"Pours a lighter orange, clear, with a tan head. There is some oak and vanilla on the nose, caramel, and toast. The taste has some vanilla and mild wood notes, with an earthy hop note, pale grain sweetness and slight toffee. Feels light, maybe a hair medium bodied, clean, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinks easy enough. Not sure if I find this to be a Scottish ale to style or Scottish ale because the brewery is Scottish. Oh well, its not half bad if you can avoid the skunking."
""
""
""
"Poured into the old trusty Duvel glass with a flourish which only raised a short lived white head that all but disappeared into the clear deep amber of the beer itself. Nose has vanilla then light oak followed by light biscuity malt tones. The tasting reveals much the same as the nose, lightly sweet maltiness and vanilla notes. Light and smooth mouthfeel, an easy drinker. The finish is on the sweet side, a bit more hop would make this quite a bit more interesting but as it is, just an easy to drink ale with an emphasis on sweetness and vanilla oakiness. Ok but a one trick pony."
""
""
""
"I dream about this beer! Seriously, it is an absolutely amazing beverage. The color is spot on amber orange. The smell is caramel and vanilla and malt and scotch. It tastes like it smells but the after taste lingers so nicely, I enjoy the sweetness that it comes with as I am a fan of dessert in general. It is potent....you don't notice the alcohol content until it is too late..."
"Overall- it's not as good as I had originally rated it, but I contend that it might still be the best offering in their lineup. Definitely something to enjoy time and again."

"o; A fine almost liquid butterscotch candylike treat.  Was expecting more oak or whiskey presence from this ""oak aged beer," but the caramel malt won out over anything else except for a note or two of woodiness in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, light carbonation. Dissipating finish (3.75)"
""
"O: Nice beer that goes down quite easy. The Barrel aging gives it a bit of a unique character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, unlike my last beer which was not good smelling but nice tasting, this was AWESOME smelling but the taste is not so great. i mean, i love the taste, but the finish is makes me shudder as i taste the barrel. i still say leave the barrels to the bourbons. and the whiskeys. it doesnt belong in beer. at least not all beer... maybe others like it, but i do not."
"Overall - 3.5"

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some woody aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla and woody flavors on the finish. There is a caramel sweetness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice woody aromas and flavors but the taste is quite sweet and sugary."
""
""
"Big head and the best lacing of the IG ales in the winter pack. Lovely clear amber with a golden amber color. Malt backbone with a spicy fruitiness in the nose. A light alcohol sweetness. Taste is smooth and malty with an oak and vanilla toffee sweetness. Alcohol and mineral edge in the finish with a mild hoppiness. Feel is medium light with a velvety creamy carbonation and easy drinkability. A good solid malt oriented ale with an oakey twist."
""
""
"OVERALL: A nice little beer with a good dry oak note. I enjoyed drinking this a good bit. Very solid all around beer."
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer because it didn't seem as heavy compared to some of the other beers in the style and had lots of vanilla in the smell and taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty solid scotch ale. lot of vanill, oak, and caramel. Nice though the taste is very one dimensional. My friends love this one; it's solid and would have it again, though not my go-to scotch ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its an enjoyable beer on occasion. good after dinner beer or something to sip. Not a beer I would want to make a night out of drinking."
""
""
""
""

"Overall / Drinkability: Interesting beer, but I feel the malt got hidden in everything and was dominated by the oak aging. Tasty though, just not as deep and flavorful as I was expecting. As for drinkability, while I would not mind a larger serving, one is enough."
"Pours a crystal clear amber, with good amount of fizzy head with decent retention. Aroma hits you as soon as you pop the top off the bottle. Oak and toffee are immediately appearant, with vanilla and fruity esters coming next. All of this over a biscuit malt backbone. Great aroma, really quite unique. Taste follow with big oak, toffee, vanilla and fruit. With all that toffee and vanilla, it gives the impression of sweetness without actually being sweet, not much in the way of hops though, I think they would benefit from a bit more hopping for balance. Oddly enough the oak lends a bit of bitterness to the mix. Mouthfeel is smooth and foamy. Overall a good beer, aroma was the high point for me. But overall quite enjoyable and definitely different."
""
""
"Creamy and smooth as well as having just enough nip to balance the feel, this medium-bodied brew is held together nicely."
"i appreciate all the innis and gunn brews because of their originality, and this one is probably the best. it might be an alias for the oak aged beer, both look the same and have the same stats. in any event, it pours clear and caramely colored into a snifter. there isnt much head at all, but just some thin white fluff. the nose is the best part, tons of toffee and vanilla without being too sweet, and plenty of oak on it, newer white oak, nothing too earthen or dank about this. the flavor is equally vanilla forward, not quite like dessert, but rich and sweet in a similar way. there is some burnt butter or caramel sort of notes throughout, but the finish is pretty dry and woody for what this is. its a little weak on the carbonation, and a boost there would really pop this beer off. i really like the way the scotch flavors carry through the whole flow, and the silky texture as well. this really is good stuff, but why do they keep on putting it in clear bottles?"
"O: quite highly carbonated for the style, smell is good but the flavor profile is quite flat, their Winter 2011 version was much better, I always question clear bottles too, hope they are UV treated in some way or that may explain the loss of depth of flavors"
""
""
"Overall - Decent, mild and easy to drink, scotch flavored with lots of oak make it enjoyable enough. Nothing over the top or world class about this, just a solid and mild beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(BTW the beer started to smell better as it aired out ) The barrel aging isn't overwhelming and is just enough to balance the malts."
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a perfect pint glass. My wife once again says the beer was very pretty , but thats where it all ends. Not much head at all and very little if any lacing. The smell was just a whiskey smell which I guess is to be expected and the taste is like a beer that someone has poured cheap whiskey into. Im not a whiskey fan and I would not have tried this even but a buddy bought it and left it in my fridge and it was taking up space , and well you cant have space taken up in the fridge , I took about 3 drinks then had an accident and spilled it into the sink ,I would never break man rule #43434 and waste a beer, blah never again"
"Overall: I personally really like it. I smoke cigars and if there is a beer I would grab to go with one this would be it. Because of what it is, it is tough to have a lot of. Three might just over do it."
"Drinkability: Boundless. Very pleasant aftertaste."
"O: oak keeps it interesting. Good not great."
""
"Copper color, hint of ruby, clear, no head or lacing. Aroma was only bourbon, couldn’t pick up anything else. Tasted bourbon, coffee, vanilla, oak plus a note of citrus. Smooth texture, crisp body, no carbonation but it was well enough balanced. Overall very impressive for the price, complex not too boozy, nice beer for the colder weather."
""
""
""
"O- The average appearance and smell hid what lay underneath. I'm looking forward to trying the various offerings of Innis & Gunn"
"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Copper colour, hint of ruby, clear, no head or lacing. Aroma was only really bourbon. Tasted bourbon, coffee, vanilla, and oak plus a hint of citrus. Smooth body, no carbonation but the mouthfull was balanced. Overall very impressive for the price, complex without being overly boozy, nice beer for the colder weather, should have picked up more than one."
""
""
""
"Smooth feel, slightly watery (as with all I&G beers thus far) with a light to medium body. Lightly sweet maltiness with a mild bitter bite, with a straightforward vanilla wafer and graham cracker flavor. Simple but pleasant enough. Drinkable, though not something I'd seek out more of."
""
"O I am once again impressed with the Scotts and there beer as I love Belhaven and I think I just found another best, I still have a Innis and Gunn rum cask to review after this one but I will be getting all the Innis and Gunn beers to try now."

"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a solid example of the style and a simple yet good oak aged beer that is very true to style. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and flavors held my attention, I could see drinking a couple of these on a cool fall night. What I liked most about this beer was it's balance and simplicity, it wasn't overdone and was exactly as advertised. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness and that it comes in a clear bottle, those were the only flaws I found with this beer. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a good and simple oak aged beer, it's not too expensive and tastes good, I recommend giving this beer a try, it's a good beer to get into the style with. All in all this was one solid oak aged beer, Innis & Gunns seems to be a pretty good and solid brewery, I have yet to have a bad beer from them, good job guys, this one worthy Oak aged beer."
"O: On the whole, this is a pretty forgettable beer. Not a whole lot to recommend."
"This is quite rich and sweet, and a little cloying, so one of these is enough. I'm not really inclined to buy it again...I much prefer Fullers, Youngs or Sam Smith."
""
"O - A brew I've had many times before and I'm sure there will be many more to be had in the future. A solid brew and a staple to any fan of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, oaky, with notes of vanilla and caramel. In the taste, Oak, toffee, and almost like bourbon, but not. A small alcohol bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry woody and vanilla aftertaste. Almost bourbon like, nice and mellow, with a big flavor."
"O-an interesting and enjoyable beer, but probably wouldn't drink multiple"
"Overall a nice beer, will try again and the rum cask version as well."
""
""
""
"This ones a bit tricky to score. Its a quite drinkable beer with a good depth of flavour, although I believe they could be tied together a bit better. Seek it out though, have been a fan of this for awhile."
""
""
"O: She may not look good but she smells and tastes great. I like this one a lot. Worth looking for."
"Taste is nice creamy caramelized sweet bread crust, light juicy zestiness, toffee, vanilla, light woodiness. It’s a bit sweet with little bitterness, but is very good, enjoyable, with a little complexity and nice character."

"O: If this was a Czech Pilsner I would say it was above average."

"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear amber-yellow pour with two finger head, decent retention, and nice lacing. The nose is really subdued compared the other Innis & Gunn beers I've tasted. The signature oak and vanilla are there, along with hints of bread and straw. The taste is a bit more up to the usual standards with buttery oak and vanilla up front, with hints of caramel and toffee as well. It definitely opens up as it warms and the flavors become more bold. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy with excellent drinkability. It's a bit subdued overall, but still a solid offering from a great brewery."
""

"Overall, a very nice beer that was just lacking in a little complexity."

"Innis and Gunn original pours a golden honey colour with about a half fingers worth of sticky foam. Smell is primarily of bready malts, toffee, and a faint scent of vanilla. Flavour has a mellow oak taste, with big malts and a touch of toffee/vanilla sweetness. It's slightly nutty on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Overall, it's a good beer to have. Worth trying, and worth stocking up on."
