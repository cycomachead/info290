"O- Impressive. There was a slight fruity character in the flavor that seemed a little off/ out of style, but still a solid brew."

"Microbrewer in Avion, Indiana let's give it a go!!! Pours almost blood orange crimson brown, definite ruby highlights when held toward the light. Aroma has some dirty malt, just a touch of Wheaties mixed with hints of cardboard box, added to that is some cooling fresh baked browines. A slight underlying dark plum juiciness exceeds out of the complexity of this 8% Scottish Ale. Heavy cereal grains, layered dark chocolate, quite a messy malt driven complexity with more wet cardboard and uneven lost in translation carbonation carrying it across the palate. A very rough abrasive beer, I hate to say that but that's what I'm getting thus far. It goes from smooth roasty to acrid acidic with a linger wet cardboard off putting note that I can't erase from my memory. Overall the harsh mouthfeel weak carbonation isn't expressive of the whole picture, there's a good beer somewhere here, preserve what you have and get through the rough patches of starting a brewery in 2010 not the best beer yet, but there's potential in the glass."

"O: I'm usually not big on scottish style ales but this one has me rethinking those feelings. Its a solid brew, more balanced than I'm used to finding in this style. Its not at the very top of my list but really quite a nice combination of flavors and very drinkable."

"Overall this is a good brew. Different. They did a good job of picking various flavors to bring out a unique beverage, which is becoming so difficult to do among the many many competitors. Recommended? I'm not sure. I guess it depends. it would be a great ""I want to go out on a limb and try something different, and I'm in a store with this right in front of me"" brew. I don't think I'd go looking for it, and I don't think it would be the end-all ""I'm looking for a great scotch ale, this may be it"" choice."
"Really enjoyable beer."

"I am very impressed with this beer, my first foray into Scottish Ales. It is very different from my recent experiences, mainly with IPA's (far sweeter and less citrus tasting). I look forward to having this beer again and will definitely be exploring this style further."

"Highly recommended stuff from this upcoming brewery."
"It's really comparable to Founders Dirty Bastard."

"Very nice caramel flavors. Good representation of Scottish Ale. Was not aware of the alcohol content until after tasting. 8%... wow! This is my first Cutters Brewing brew and I was very impressed. My wife even liked it, which is saying a lot for a beer not named Miller or Coors."

"Pours a wonderful deep copper with great head and wonderful lacing throughout. Excellent deep and hugely sweet malty aroma, with huge caramel tones. Great caramel flavors, as well, with hints of toffee; huge sweet malt flavors, nice earthy hop finish; nice peatiness as it warms up. Goes down very well for a bomber of 8% ABV. The guy at Big Red called this one quite well."

"Pours a cloudy amber with little head. What head is there is an eggshell or ecru. Aroma of popcorn is here with a sugary sweetness.The nice hop bitterness balances the sweetness appropriately. Tasty but not worthy going out of the way for. Overall, a good beer, but if looking for a good example of the style, there are better options."
"A wonderful take on the style. This one holds its own. Another tasty brew from the guys down at Cutters."
