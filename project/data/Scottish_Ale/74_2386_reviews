"Probably one of the worst scotch ales I've ever had. Not nearly as strong in flavor like some of the best."

"o: A good representation of the style, which I was just reading about in All About Beer magazine. Might have a fuller body, but certainly has some good malt flavor with a dark fruit tinge."

"Cask pour in a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, bright, ruby-copper coloring with a frothy, filmy, clingy, off-white head. Aromas of scotch and caramel sweetness, with a subtle roasting. Tangy sweet flavors of scotch and floral thistle, with a boozey highlight. Very smooth across the palate, with a clean, hoppy bitterness at the end. Rich, smooth feel across the mouth, with a slightly scotchy and sweet aftertaste. Smooth, clean, slightly drying finish. Tasty brew."

"Malty sweetness all over with some candied fruit in the middle and cocoa and a big herbal bitter in back. Hoppy for a Scottish ale but it fits."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of Dec 12. Sampled on April 26, 2012. It pours a handsome looking deep amber with little to no head, which tends to disappoint me. The aroma has a pleasant malt sweetness to it, some yeast, with a bit of bread. The body is in the medium range or maybe just a bit under. The taste is upfront sweet and malty with licorice and a moderate bitterness. It ends off-dry. This is an adequate take on the style."

"O: Certainly not what I expected. Not bad, but like I said, a little too fruity in the nose and not enough smoke in the taste makes this a little disappointing"
"O- I really enjoyed this one, very refreshing as well as drinkable, Great session beer!"
""
"O: this used to be better, it seemed more complex when I've had it before, still good, just not stellar"

"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a long time if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."
"D - Scotch / Scottish Ales are my favorite style and I find Gritty's to be a very underrated brewery, unfortunately the combination doesn't work for me in this instance... This one is still average and drinkable, but a slight disappointment for both the style and the brewery..."
"Drink is decent, light minerality and herbal hops, dry finish, fairly bitter"
"D- A beer this good practically begs to be continued to drink"
"Decent for a Scottish ale, but Pemaquid remains my go-to."
"Picked this up thinking it was a new beer, but I think just the packaging is new. Looks alright for starters - brown in color, nice foamy head, pretty standard. Not much at all going on in terms of aroma - faint toffee notes, malt. Goes downhill fast - sort of buttery and not much balance. Muddy malt, lacks any sort of character that good Scotch Ales do - no nutty, smoky, etc. Kind of carboardy, and just bland and watery. Leads to not such a satisfying beer I have to say. This is not a good representation of the generally good beers that Gritty's can churn out. Pass and get the Pale, Bitter, Stout, or Halloween Ale instead."
"o - decent brew, but won't be seeking it out."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. This beer pours an amber brown color with a creamy white head that goes away pretty quickly. There is no real lacing on this beer, just a small ring around the edge of the liquid. Also it has very good clarity. Smell is good, not great, but good. Actually when cool it really doesn't have much of a smell at all. After it warms up a bit the nose gets a bit stronger. It's big on the malts, very sweet, even a little rich. The taste is a step up. Again it's very malty, caramelized with a bit of a butterscotch flavor. It doesn't taste very hoppy, maybe a little bit of a citrus hop flavor, but it unquestionably targets your bitter taste buds. The mouthfeel is excellent. Creamy and smooth with a clean bitter finish. No carbonation bite at all. Full bodied and well balanced overall. This beer has good drinkability overall. I would certainly get it again if the opportunity arose. This beer won't blow you away, but it's pretty unique for this style."
"A great Scottish Ale, almost as good as Cally's Smokin Scottish Ale"
"D: A pretty good Scotch Ale... I'd like the opportunity to try it on tap to compare. Maybe a bit bland compared to some other Scotch ales, but overall it was good."
"Everything seems middle of the road with this brew. While glad for a new brew if I ever make it to Gritty's I'll pass on this one."
"Loved all of the previous offerings from this brewery... this one didn't really do it for me to be honest. Pours a nice cloudy red color, small head, minimal lacing. Medium body to it.. some caramel aroma notes. Taste is a bit watery and don't get a lot of the peat/smokey flavor or even that much caramel in the taste. When I get a scotch ale that's what I expect, but this one is a bit lacking. Good try GM, but I'll pass on this Scottish Ale in the future... not a bad beer overall though."
"Very easy drinking, quite tasty, but not really quite having all of the elements of a top notch Scottish ale. Most notably, the smoky/peaty character associated with the style. A quality brew that I'll be happy to have again upon occasion."
"Cheers!"
"This is only the second Scottish ale I've tried, the other being a little too strong in taste for me. Gritty's, however, was very drinkable. Paired this one with some bread and sharp cheddar cheese, which actually brought out a little bit of sweet malty flavor in the beer. Alcohol content isn't too noticeable, and it isn't as heavy as I expected, but still an enjoyably rich taste. Got me interested in trying some other Scottish ales."
"A dark caramel color with a thick off-white head and great thick lacing. The aroma is a mild nutty grass hops and cider. The taste is smooth malt and sharp pine hops. A crisp but somewhat full mouth feel. It's a decent drinker for the style, doesn't seem too strong in alcohol. I pick up some sour apple and lemon, rye and peat. Very enjoyable, perhaps the best Gritty's I ever had. Be sure to try it!"
"D: A little more alcoholic than I remember this being. Great starting beer, also great to keep you warmer int he winter months. I always give it a try when I comes out here in Maine around this time of year."
"A big beer that for me would start a session but I would move on after one."
"Drinkability: A nice winter beer. I would definitely get this beer again."
"Overall, not too bad. Has some really great elements and some weak ones as well. Alcohol is present, but not too in your face. Worth a try, and was worth the purchase of a single."
"Dark amber colored ale with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is buttery caramel.Taste is caramel or perhaps butterscotch.This is something I could see myself buying again.I would recommend to my buddies.Nothing overly great but a pretty damn good drinkable ale!!"
"Good drinkability, and overall, an above average Scottish, well done, not top of the heap, but quality."
"The drinkability is just fine a very well dome brew that drinks agreat. Prosit, MK"
"Just got this on the Holiday weekend, Pours dark amber nice head about 3/4 inch with lacing. Smell of Carmel and a little hops.It has a very Nice Taste and flavor. Feels very refreshing in your mouth and is easy to drink and one leads to another. This is a very nice Scottish Style Ale and I will revisit again for sure wish it was a little easier to get but a good taste and good price!"
"I could drink a few of these."
"Scottish Ale is my fourth Gritty McDuff's beer and is my fourth solid Gritty McDuff's beer. This brewery isn't likely to be anyone's all-time favorite (apologies if it is), but I'd love to live within their distribution area. Thanks to fo5s for the bomber."
"Pours a dark amber, fizzy head comes up and falls quick. Smell is malty sweetness. Maple, caramel, light spice and floral presence. Good taste. Sweet up front but an excellent doughy, bready profile that comes soon after. It has a light nutty aspect to it as well. Smooth medium mouthfeel that is lightly creamy and well rounded, tiny bit of dryness in the finish. I'd take a couple more if I had them, that's for sure."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a short and medium bodied tan head that sticks around and laces the glass on the way down. The aroma is of sweet malts, some nice hoppy bitter aromas, and then some scotch in there as well. The taste is of very nice sweet roasted malts, some scotch flavoring, and then a nice bitter hit at the end from the hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and kind of refreshing making it a drinkable beer. I was hoping for something a little less bitter, more scotchy, and smoother feeling."
"A solid beer overall."
"Poured a dark amber into the pint glass. Short head formed and quickly receded-no lacing is evident. Smells mainly of biscuit malt. Tastes of bread with some hops and mild fruity flavor. Medium mouthfeel and relatively easy to drink. I like this better than most scottish ales I have tried, but is not one of my favorites from this brewery."
"Drinks okay, nothing special here"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head above the deeply amber brew. Good lacing. Aroma is well-balanced of caramel malts and somewhat non-descript hops. Taste is caramel malts, with a crisp somewhat citrusy hop finish. Everyone needs to remember, Scottish, not Scotch ale. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is great. I enjoy most any Gritty brew, and this one fits the bill as well."
"Dark brown/sligtly amber color. Cola fizz of a head with zero lace. Smell of some biscuit malt and not much else. Taste gets more interesting with a solid malty base with some biscuit and caramel maltyness. A surprizing bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little to high on the carbonation side. A solid session brew that was enjoyable."
"D: The ale works as a sessioner, decent taste and not much alcohol. But if you are looking for something deeper, pass on this."
"D - Very solid Scottish style ale with a good amount of hops and flavors to keep it interesting. Carbonation is pretty heavy, but it doesn't detract from the overall aesthetic. I enjoyed this brew very much!"
"Obviously contract-bottled by Shipyard. Not a bad effort but I can name better efforts. Will look for this in a bomber though as I hear bombers are better quality (unless they won't be available in bombers)."
"I was a little disappointed in the bottle I had this from the brewpub and letÂ’s say it tastes a lot different but still an interesting beer none the less"
"Steve"
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a mild malt scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It's dry with some sweetness. The taste is average also. It has a dry, malty taste that seems watered down even at 6.3%. It has a very light peated flavor along with an alcohol zing. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This has got to be the least enjoyable Scottish ale I've ever had. It lacks depth in the malt bill. It lacks body and it lacks aroma. Down the drain it goes."
"Feels thick like a porter. Rich and leaves a film. A little bubbly, and thicker than it looks. It's not amazing, but definitely decent enough. Roasted, bitter, nutty, alcohol-fueled."
"Gritty McDuff's Scottish Ale pours a red amber with a creamy off-white head. Aroma is dominated by ringwoody diacetyl with some malts hidden in the background. Flavor is also dominated by the same buttery diacetyl with the addition of some roasted malt flavor. The bitterness is balanced and there is little hop flavor."
"While this isn't my style, I like this one. If you like sweet beers, this one is decently balanced with some hops."
"12oz bottle. Feb 08 notched on side of label. Dark amber with reddish tan head that quickly dissapates and leaves ring. Aroma is mild; maltiness with a quick mild hop whiff. Taste is a caramel maltiness with an over-balance of bittering hops. Taste is not bad, just off for the style. Mouthfeel suffers from too much carbonation of a soda-like nature. The trait I expect from scottish and scotch style ales is a fresh malty wort-like flavor and aroma that is robust and up-front. The caramel banana fruitiness of the ringwood yeast makes me think more of an autumn or winter ale. Decent beer, just not a good representation of the style."
"Pretty clear burnt orange colour with a longlasting short cap of whitish foam. Streaky lace stuck to the glass after each swirl. Very fruity aroma, with notes of sultana raisins, cakey malt, and mild banana bread. Maybe a faint whiff of alcohol as well. Sweet, malty base with mild, yet sturdy, hop bitterness. Mild caramel with a bit of fruitiness. Hop flavour made its presence felt in the finish, where it melded with a gentle combination of alcohol, malt, and bitterness. Nice level of attenuation, still some residual sugars left. Decent texture, medium/low carbonation. Not a bad beer at all, but the high level of esters really seems out of place. It would definitely work as a local session though."
" This brew is medium bodied but crisp and substantial. This is one of the more enjoyable version of this style that i've had, very bold flavor and extremely drinkable."
"Pours a five finger cream head that goes slowly, leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Malty/hoppy nose. Flavor starts as a sweet mix of malt and hops, finishes slightly bitter. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"At 6.3% a pretty healty beer, weighs a bit heavy but pretty tasty."
"Nice looking brew from GrittyÂ’s as it poured to a amber color that seems to have brown highlights. A fair sized head is present, slight tan color, which breaks down somewhat quickly but is not leaving much of any lacing. Also noticed this with the last one that I had a couple of nights ago. The aroma is malt, caramel in scent maybe some citrus in there as well. Not a bad smelling brew but not the most inviting Scottish Ale I have had. The feel is relatively smooth with tastes of roasted malt being dominant. Slight hop bite at the end that seems to be somewhat muted but finish nicely. Seems to have more flavors coming out as the brew warms a bit, a somewhat earthy tone. Over all it is a fair brew, but not one to rush out and get, a good offering in the 12 pack Gritty Dozen."
"Overall, a damn fine Scottish Ale in all regards except for its staying power with warmth & air. I'm not saying to chug it, but sipping/nursing it does not help nor do it justice. However, there are far worse things in the world than a beer that appeals to all senses and can just be enjoyed without much thought over a session, one after the other. Perhaps one of the biggest sleepers in the New England market. By all means check it out & enjoy it while its here before the bagpipes call it away for another year."
"D---Nice ale but it reminded me of an ESB brewed with crystal 120. It was too bitter and pale to be Scottish ale but they can call it what ever they want. The bottom line is this is very drinkable and I enjoyed it."
"22oz bomber from my local Shaw's. Dark amber/red translucent body with a half an inch of off-white head. Aroma is weak, but hints at roasted malt and hop. Roastiness dominates the flavor, not like a porter, but a roasted malt nonetheless. Medium-bodied. Flavor and mouthfeel are not overwealming, thus this is a really drinkable brew for the style. While not the best Scottish ale I've had, it's a good one from one of my favorite breweries. I'll be having this one again, sure."
"Overall- A decent Ale nothing great. My 1st from Gritty."
"Clear amber red with a thin white cap. Clean, sweet caramel malt aroma with some diacetyl and light fruits. Sweet and bright on the tongue at first though, thankfully, a darker maltiness attempts to chase down the sweetness - some light esters show up as well. Smooth, medium, clean body. Not bad."
"I found this very enjoyable. Really nice malty flavor & good hop balance in the finish. Leaves a slight bitter aftertaste which is enjoyable,"
"Drinkability is OK. On tap, I might be inclined to have more than 1-2. At home, I will probably reach for something else from the mix pack I found this in."
"Well not what you would expect a scottish ale to be. Pours dark brown a little of a head. Not much smell, a bit sweet. Tastes somewhat malty with quite a bit of hops for a scottish ale. Overall not bad but not overly exciting either. Good way to introduce people to darker beers."
"Pours a rich brown in color that is absolutely clear. Thick, white head that dissolves into a thin film. Nose is sweet caramel with just a hint of hops. Flavor is fairly straightforward. Sweet at first with a bit more hop bitterness towards the finish. Got some caramel. Kind of an apple thing going on too. Full body. I wonder how this would be on cask? Nice and drinkable."
"Somehow, this tastes the same as Best Brown and Best Bitter... variations on the same lackluster theme."
"Strangely, I could imagine several hours of darts or pool while swigging this and BS'ing with the guys."
"Overall I'd drink another one if offered, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to track one down."
"Gritty's has come out with combo 12 packs. This one had Scottish Ale, Christmas Ale, and the year-round Pub Ale. This Scottish ale is very good. It had a nice amber color with minimal head (and I really tried to make so0me head when pouring). It has a spicy/sweet aroma, and a good cinnamon/malty taste, with a hoppy aftertaste that really lingers. Lightly carbonated, so good mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer."
"Pours a solild copper to amber color with a small head that falls to a sparse coat over top. Small bubbles slowly form at the bottom of the glass and float up. Nose is nice and butter to toffee with a lot of caramel sweetness. A bit too buttery for me. Flavor is better than the nose. Buttery diacetyl is still there, but I get some moderte herbal hopping with a moderate hop bitter finish. Also good caramel sweetness. Not quite what I expect from my scottish ales. I'd like some peaty or smokey character and not with the hops. Feel is moderate with a full moderate carbonation. The hopping is really not working with me on this one. It should be more sweet and with some peaty or smokey phenols. Just okay."
"The smoky character teams up well with the hops and malt, although I would have liked a bit more body. Overall, this a decent Scottish ale with respectable complexity."
"I'm not usually a big fan of the Gritty's line of beers, but this one caught my interest. Pours with a real orange/red/amber color and a decent enough head. Has a nice classic ale style nose and taste with ample bitterness on the finish. It could have had a little bigger mouthfeel; but all in all, a damn fine winter brew."
"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start and finish, while the finish has a soft buttery caramel aftertaste. Medium bodied. Nice drinkability."
"I often question the freshness of many Maine beers when people buy them in singles or sixers at their local market. Whilst I am suer that the further north you go, the better your chance of getting fresh product is, for me in PA anything that we get is questionable at best. I learned a lot about Maine beer on my trip to Portland at the end of February, but the main thing is this: Maine beer *needs* to be drunk fresh from the tap. Sorry about that little rant, but this beer is no exception to the above rule. I had this on tap at several Portland-area beer bars. It's a nice ruddy brown colour that is not opaque, but is almost black. Their are some red highlights though if you look at this one closely. The head is small and consists of thick white-ish foam. Lacing is there, but minimal in nature. The aromas of this brew are classic UK Scotch ale. Big beefy malts, and a big sweetnes, are barely balanced by some nice leafy UK hop variatels. Taste is malty and sweet, with some nice smoky/oaky/scotchy notes that are there, but partially hidden by the huge maltiness of this brew. Mouthfeel is medium modied>thick and drinkability is very good. A very solid example of this style, done up right by one of the best breweries that Maine has to offer. Don't take this place for granted all you Maine BA's."
"This is a good Scottish Ale and one of my favorite styles this time of year. There are much better beers of this style out there, but this one is solid."
"Another great beer from this fine brewer. Chestnut colored with a fat and foamy and somewhat lumpy off-white head that lingers long. Thick rings of foam and spotty lace line the glass as I drink. Aroma is light, and consists of sweet malt and some hops. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel followed by a sweet malt flavor upfront, with toffee and caramel, plus some hops, in the finish. Light brown sugar emerges in the aftertaste. Veeeery drinkable."
"Notes: A nice beefy Scottish ale, reminds me of some of the strong Scottish bitters I had many years ago in Edinburgh. A stogy beef stew would be a great pairing with this one."
"Strong malt aroma. Poured an amber-copper, with a nice decent sized head. Taste was malty with a definite alcohol presence. Initially sweet, then an alcohol bite at the finish. Had a somewhat oily mouthfeel that was medium bodied. Ok to drink one, but I'd rather try another brew."
"Oh, well, not until I taste it. Bummer. Maybe it's just the sixer that I bought, but this is really carbonated, light in body (like, light! Dang!) and light in flavor. Nothing much to say about aftertaste, but, really, I'm just so bummed that I've got a whole six pack of this to drink."
"EDIT: Ok that bomber I had may have not been up to snuff. I have had subsequent 6-packs that have been much more flavorful and rich. Still not fantastic but better than I thought before."
"The tatse is a major letdown. Very un-scot like. Some decent toasted malt and caramel up front but the ending is just horrible. Very bitter and hopped. Not what I call a scotch ale by any stretch."
"Medium body, average carbonation. Overall a pretty average beer."
"Not a bad brew, but a bit of sharp flavors that aren't balanced. I think the alcohol is bit too much present. pat"
"Pretty average on the drinkability stakes..could have been a lot better."
"Overall a drinkable brew. I'm not so sure I would go so far as to call it a scotch ale. To me a scotch ale is very malty with some alcohol notes and not much hop bitterness. This was more like a dark IPA or ESB to me. But to be honest I have had much worse that was called a scotch ale."
