It's not a terrible beer, but should be labeled a light brown ale or something. This does not remind me of the Scottish style ale in the slightest. It tastes like a watered down brown ale. Won't be getting this again.","SpenCycle","Feb 14, 2015"

Goes down very easy and wanders on the tongue with a hint of deep a roast.  A roast almost coffee-like and I don't like coffee. But this Scottish ale is a winner and will be consumed in my household for a long time. It is not an all day beer by any means. A good one to have after a meal of chicken over rice, pot roast or just a can of Pringles!","Rddymk","Jan 27, 2015"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and brown sugar aromas. Taste is much the same with toast, nut, and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with solid aromas and flavors for the style.","UCLABrewN84","May 31, 2014"

Now this beer is still quite cold, freshly poured after coming out of the "regular" refrigerator, but most of what I'm getting from the aroma is an almost tart fruitiness. As this warms it opens up a little and I get more malt with sweet caramel and toffee, bread, and hints of dark fruit. Taste is mild toffee and caramel up front followed by some tart and dark fruits for the dry finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sugary mouthfeel. This one is a bit weird. There's a tart almost metallic thing going on the aroma. The body is a bit to thin for the style and the flavor should have more rich caramel/burnt sugar maltiness in it, but it doesn't.

2.55,-29.2,3.5,3.5,2,2,2.5,"O: The seas of good beer flavor are never at rest, presenting new challenges for microbreweries every single day. That’s why I can pick up four cans of Sun King’s Osiris PA and be perfectly content, but four of these would bring me nothing but disappointment. Ah well, it just goes to show: not every beer is great, and not every brewer has its styles down. Give these guys a few years and they might be sending this one out with the strength and flavor I know they can deliver. At least that’s what I hope…","BarryMFBurton","Jun 01, 2011"
3.18,-11.7,3.5,3,3.5,2.5,3,"My first thoughts upon first taste were disappointing but that improved with the rest of the beer. I thought the beer was light on malt taste and seemed to light for the style. Perhaps I had higher expectations since I picked up in Indy on my way back to Wisconsin.","Redsoxnation","May 21, 2011"

3.78,5,4,3.5,4,3,4,"D/O- A real thirst-quencher, better than other Scottish Styles I've reviewed. Would be great in the summertime on the beach as opposed to a bland BMC. Thanks for the hookup dannyfrost!","Duff27","Apr 06, 2011"
3.63,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: This would be a good beer for those not liking beers with a character. Something I would drink when mowing the lawn or doing some outside yard work.","brewdenver","Mar 19, 2011"
3.35,-6.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Wee Mac Scottish Style Ale is the first beer I have tried from the Sun King brewery. Sun King is one of a growing number of craft breweries that cans their beers. Pint cans. It pours a lovely brown with a nice malty aroma (although when I opened the can at first I could really smell the yeast). Little head. It has a very nice malty flavor. You tell they don't use alot of hops in this. Well, it even says it on the can. It also says it has a hazelnut/tofee flavor. I don't know if I would say that, but it has a good flavor so that's enough for me. I would buy this again!","flyingspatula","Mar 11, 2011"
3.55,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O- I will drink em again. It's not going to blow your mind. But you're not going to be upset about it either. Slightly above average.","tykees88","Mar 10, 2011"

4.69,30.3,3.5,4.5,5,4,5,"D: Very drinkable. A fantastic example of the style. Probably about 60, while Robert The Bruce is about an 80 with some hops... Very different from each other but this one is probably better. Impressive.","pwoods","Jan 20, 2011"
3.85,6.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Following the Crack & Glug, I was looking at a mild cascade as the beer produced two thick fingers' worth of mocha-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep orangish-brownish amber with coppery highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was as malty as advertised and definitely had that hazelnut character that they mentioned. I am ambivalent about hazelnut in that I do not mind the flavor, but I would not want a cup of full-on hazelnut coffee, either. Mouthfeel was medium and the good news (for me) was that the hazelnut was, indeed, reduced by the cocoa flavor. Yes, it was a very malty beer, but I CAN appreciate such things, despite being a self-avowed hophead. On the flipside, though, one CAN at a time is probably enough for me. The finish was sweet, but not cloyingly so, as some beers in the style are.","woodychandler","Jan 09, 2011"

4.15,15.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I hope to see Wee Mac Brown in cans soon, as hinted at in the tasting room: the can is just as outrageously designed as Osiris and Cream Dream. Yahoo, Sun King! Keep up the good work!","salvo","Jun 05, 2010"

4.32,20,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Sun King is 2 for 2! I could drink this beer all the time. Id really like to pair it with a cigar, and help bring out all those tobacco flavors hiding behind the malt. Im not sure I would call this a Scottish Ale, but call it what you want, it's fantastic. Sun King, please make your way to South Bend.","JToad","Dec 30, 2009"
3.7,2.8,4,4,3.5,3,4,"D- This is a decent, above average Scottish Ale. Its very light, sessionable and drinkable. Also seems to be an interesting, somewhat unique brew. Its nice to sample someone else's locals occasionally and I'd like to trade for more local growlers.","PittBeerGirl","Aug 22, 2009"
3.98,10.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice coppery brown color, with a nice bit of head. Decent scent, very sweet and malty, although not very deep; has some slight caramal in the nose. Nice taste, a decent maltiness with a bit of toffee/caramal in the flavor; little hop characteristics, which is fine for the style. Slightly thin for an 80 shilling, but goes down quite well, a very nice near-session Scottish ale.","JamesS","Aug 21, 2009"
