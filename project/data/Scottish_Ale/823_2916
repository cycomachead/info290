3.86,6,3.75,4,4,3.25,3.75,"Pours a nice amber color with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell has a bit of alcohol but underneath is a lot of scents, vanilla and caramel as well as some citrus and smoke to give it a complex smell. The taste was just as layered with the flavors from the malt and the hops as well as some wood on the finish making a very well balanced beer. One of my favorite growlers to pick up when I can.","WhiteHillsStore","Dec 10, 2014"

No head on the pour, but a slight ring of bubbling was present. The beer had a very sweet aroma, with some nut and coffee bitterness. I was preparing for a creamy feel, but surprisingly enough this beer is a bit effervescent and bubbly, while still being on the creamy side. The beer's flavors are toasty, with chocolate and coffee characteristics in the forefront. The beer is like Hershey kisses melted in a cup of coffee. The beer is light, and the aftertaste is chocolate sweet, with a slight lingering finish of burnt characteristics.","GarthDanielson","Jul 26, 2011"

Flavor is malt, boozey with a slight bit of pepper. Some breadiness as well as some caramel. A bit of an overall sourness to this one. This is a solid choice for a drinkable beer which is helpful because I usually only see growlers of it. Overall, its a good local beer. Worth having again.","PicoPapa","Mar 08, 2011"

The taste is more of the same, the caramel malt really stands out, and that is a good thing, there is enough hop in there to just hold the malts in check.

Very pleasant and pronounced blend of coffee, caramel, and cocoa powder in the nose. Tasted of caramel and coffee, dissolving to more maltiness midpalate and finishing on a smoky note. Nicely smooth, not overly carbonated medium body. Very sessionable, and one of my few repeat table visits during the 'fest.","donniecuffs","Jun 13, 2010"

I had seen this one at the brass city brewfest but didn't get the opportunity to try it. No idea what to expect here. Nice dark brown color with some serious head on this beer. Smells grainy and malty. Tasted kinda smokey. Rough at first but I eased into it. It has a very nice mouthfeel, strong but pronounced. I really like how this one goes down.

Poured from the growler into a pint glass, this one showed a slightly hazey dark iced tea color with a modest off-white head and fair scattered lacing. The aroma was a somewhat malty rye, a touch grassy but mild and mellow, pleasant. The flavor was a very nice blend of spicey rye and mild brown sugar malt. Mild but effective carbonation in a medium bodied silky feel. I really like this with it's polite hint of bitterness, somewhere between herbal and citrus. This tasted better than I remember it from the tap some time ago, so I will be sure to snag a growler for home sometime soon. Well done!","Durge","Beers"

The body was average for the style, with light carbonation, mouthfeel was average, but if it was 90 degrees out the mouthfeel would be exceptional. Very well balanced. I had no problem finishing a growler and a half. This is what I reach for after mowing the lawn. A winner in my book .

Up front flavors of toasted malt and smoke lead to some lemony hops with chocolate and molasses. Light carbonation, medium body, leaves a very clean, crisp mouthfeel, a little thin for the style but it works. The malt is very well controlled and balanced by the hops, there are so many different flavors. Too often, the smoke takes over the taste of this style, not here. Amazing drinkability for the style, I had no problem finishing this growler on my own. My favorite CT beer to date.","scottg","Feb 10, 2008"

There appears to be some peated malt in there, but it's faint. The hops add some bitterness, but not enough to make it interesting. The mouthfeel is average as well.

I couldn't get past the funky and infected flavor enough to get further in the taste evaluation. There is a medium to full body, but again, I couldn't get past the flavor.

Anyways, this beer was a decent all around brew, and I would order it again. I had it with a burger and it paired quite nicely. However this beer may not be completely loyal to its style. I found there to be more hops in the beer than I feel a Scottish ale should have, however for my personal taste I enjoyed it. If rating based on loyalty to style alone, subtract a half point.

The taste is a bit different from what I expected based on the nose -- there's a touch of brown grains in the middle, but the first sensation I get from this is a dry hop bitterness that sticks around through the finish. The mouthfeel is also much thinner than I had expected, with sharp carbonation and a slight alcoholic burn.

The hops and heather character carries over into the taste, producing a reasonably well-balanced brew that tends a tad toward the hops.

Quite malty along with some slight peat aromas, but very little. Could of used a little more peat-like aromas, but that's ok. Taste was nice. Slight toasted malts that seemed sweetened slightly. Some brown sugar was also in there to add a little more sweetness to it. There was some peatness to it, but it could of used a little more.
