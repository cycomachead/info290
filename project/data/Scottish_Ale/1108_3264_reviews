"O - I enjoyed this, a well put together scottish ale with some nice flavors."
"Beer is medium bodied, with medium-low to low carbonation, resulting in a slightly foamy (1/3) and mostly smooth (2/3) mouthfeel that is appropriate for the beer and the style. Closes dryly, with significant dryness and stickiness on the palate and lips."

"Food match: In the words of the wise Carl Weathers: ""Whoa, whoa, whoa. There’s still plenty of meat on that bone. Now you take this home, throw it in a pot, add some broth, a potato. Baby, you’ve got a stew going"". In other words: Stew."

"Overall: I certainly like this one, even if it doesn't do anything highly original in the end. It's just a very solid Scottish ale with strong bitterness and a nice balance."

"Like the cask version, it had a clear mahogany body with an off-white head: the nose a nutty, semi-sweet malty feel to it. The taste was malts all the way: chocolate and toffee being the strongest flavours within the maltiness. Dryness, with a pronounced bitterness comes later with the hops showing their worth as initial maltiness drifts away. The cask review is just pipped at the post by the overall niceness of it being Christmas!"

"Overall well made, delicately flavoured, sessionable Scottish Ale."
""
"This Scottish ale delivers enough flavor and punch to win over the most enthusiastic Scotch whiskey fan, but light and drinkable enough to caress the palate of their opposition as well."
""
"Not bad stuff."
"A really nice beer; near dark amber colour, a light aroma with vague hints of of the taste character, a thin off white head and stable body, quite bitter to the taste with a coffee finish but still very flavoursome. This is, to my view, a beautiful beer, more often than not this will be in my selection if I am on a Scottish ale run! If you see it give it a shot!"
""
"O - A very sessionable ale that is recommended."

"My nephew hooked me up with this beer following a trip to Scotland. Clear copper-amber pour with two finger head with great retention and lacing. Earthy, malty nose with hints of toffee, tea, caramel, brown sugar, and just a touch of metal. The hops that were predominantly absent from the nose, really jump out in the taste in that classic English fashion. Toasty malt, brown bread, tea, caramel, and just a touch of vanilla round out this well balanced beer. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a nice tangy, bitter hop bite on the finish. This, coupled with the low ABV make this highly drinkable. A very solid Scottish Ale. Thanks Kevin!"
"O: Maybe I tried this beer at the wrong time, or maybe I was just burned out on Scottish ales, but this ale did absolutely nothing for me. This is unusual, as I generally like Inveralmond's products. I have a feeling I'll be revisiting this beer in the future, though I will not making a point of rushing to do so."
"This beer poured out as a nice amberish copper color with a foamy looking white head on top. The smell of the beer gives off a nice soft earthy aroma with a subtle sweet malts and grains on the nose. The taste of the beer is sweet with some subtle hints of caramel. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth and lightly carbonated. Overall this beer is pretty good, I would try this one again someday if I came across it."
"A nice well balanced Scottish Ale to enjoy as session beer."
"A dark amber/brown colour with a thick head, with a very foamy texture. smells a bit metallic along with hops, some chocolate there too. taste of aromatic hops with a malty taste to back it up, the malt and the hops kind of blends together, really well balanced."
"D: Quite a easy drinker. Nothing overpowering but it's not weak on anything. Would make for a great session beer."
"D: Good Scottish Ale, easy drinker. A nice brew while relaxing at home. I imagine this would be best on tap at the local pub."
"The nose is has pleasant hints of blackcurrant and chocolate suggesting a malt heavy beverage. The beer tastes more tart than I was expecting, a chocolate raspberry affair with considerable carbonation and more biscuity and herbal flavours in the aftertaste. A good sipper."
"D: Light, but weirdly sour and not that great. It's pretty good at first, but can't even last half a pint. Grab something else."
"Taste is toasty bread crust, dryish, woody-earthy leaves, hint of chocolate. Balanced sweetness and bitterness, the latter just dominating the finish, which is earthy, leafy, and a little spicey-peppery. Feel is firm."
"One of several birthday presents from my in laws! Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. It wasn't as dark as I expected especially since the label states ""Dark Scottish Ale," but still pretty good looking. It comes out a little bit of an orange brown color, ""rusty"" if you will. Very hazy and a thick creamy white head, very decent lacing. The smell isn't overly strong, but it's got complexity and depth and overall pretty good. A little citrusy and bready. Almost like a orange loaf of pound cake. It's followed by dark sweet malts. Taste is good, malty, but not too aggressive. Caramel and toffee, not too sweet though. There is a good balance between the malt and hop flavor, citrus hops. Not really bready like the smell. Mouthfeel is good, fairly light, almost smooth. A little complex, not as creamy as other Scottish Ales I've had in the past. It's strange, not really like any of this style I've had in the past but really enjoyed this. I like the balance and it's very unique. Good, I'd get it again, but more of a summer Scottish Ale, I like it."
"A decent beer on cask. Nothing special, but enjoyable for what it is. Worth a try if you see it on cask."
"Other notes: Bought in a brewery gift pack from a visitor centre shop on the outskirts of Perth"
"D: Drinkability was fair, though one would be it for me. Rather boring, lacked maltiness, and incentive to have more. A bit thin and almost watery at times makes this go down rather easy but the lack of flavor and heart certainly don't help matters here and made me hesitant towards the next sip. Overall a good aromatic experience that goes down hill from there."
"D- Hops are refreshing throughout the flavour but malts are too minimal for me on the tongue to be trully sessionable."
"Wow, i was very very impressed by this...and it was my first pint so i know my tasters were on it. One of the best browns i've had period."
"Drinkability: A pleasant, easy-drinking Scottish brew with an appreciated low alcohol percentage."
"Real solid thick moutfeel with lots of malt and chocolate notes coming to the fore kinda like porter mixed with a Scottish Ale. I thought the beer was much stronger than its 4.7ABV with all the flavour packed into the finish. I would definately buy this again as it combines complexity with drinkability in a sessionable package."
"Not bad but I believe I've had stronger versions of the style. Highly drinkable and easy to enjoy but far from the best example I've had. Worth a shot if you're a fan of the style."
"Drinkability: I could drink quite a few of these beers if it weren't for the price ($5.99 per bottle from the store). Low in alcohol so the legs don't get wobbly after a few."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty light amber color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dry English hops with lingering peats malt notes (or maybe I was dreaming but seems there was definite smoke notes). Body is quite full with good carbonation and light alcohol level makes this even more enjoyable. Easily drinkable though quite complex - finish was maybe a tad too dry."
"Some day i need to have this ""in country"" over in Scotland."
"The apple/caramel combo I think would pair nicely with caramelized scallops, or maybe a hot doughnut at a festival. A salty beef pie(think of scottish food) would be nice. If this were reduced down and made into a apple/ale compote. It could make a nice pastry filling for flaky fillo dough"
"D: easy to drink, if not altogether my favorite"
"This one is the first beer of Scotland i drink. In the appearance, have a brown tamarind color, very opaque, regular foam head, in the logo have a landscape; the smell is fresh, with essences of plum and peach; in the logo says ""distinctively rich"" and it's true; frutal taste with flavors of peach, a little coffee, orange and banana; the mouthfeel is citrus, light carbonation and medium bitterness, it is acceptable, and the flavor in the mouth lasts; in the drinkability, possibly be too citrus, excellent to accompany any food"
"Thin on the mouthfeel yet somewhat slick on the tongue. Low carbonation make this one finish slightly dry. Good beer indeed."
"Lots of character in this ale, still very balanced."
"The hops - Challenger, Fuggles and Cascade - according to the label - play a supportive role to the toffee-ish chocolate-y maltiness that is not quite rich, but works well to produce a well-balanced tasty treat. Very drinkable/""sessionable""!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Superb beer."
"This beer improves as you progress through, still a bit light on flavor for my tastes."
"Taste is a bit more watery than I'd like, but there's a great crackery malt backbone balanced very well by a lightly herbal hop bitterness. Light clover honey sweetness. Old school flavours here, it's not hard to imagine the highlands while drinking this. Clean and simple, medium body, and it dries nicely in the finish. Mild carbonation. I could session this no problem, it's really tasty and slides down really easily."
"D - No problems putting a few of these away."
"Not as complex as some Scottish ales I've had, but it's certainly not bland, either. A good session beer - wish I had more than the one."
"D: This is an excellent brew! Beautiful flavours,well crafted and is highly drinkable given its relatively low ABV. I could definitely see myself drinking more than one of these in a night. I look forward to my next one! A great find."
"Has a wonderful copper color, if just a little on the light side. Not much of a head, but wonderful lacing all around. Has a great malty/peaty scent that fills the nose without overpowering. Great warm scotch ale flavor, a nice and deep maltiness with a bit of smoky peat. Does have a slight hint of chocolate, though not as much as promised. Goes down exceedingly well! It will not be a problem at all to finish the 1+ liter bottle."
"The beer dispense from the 500ml bottle an almost opaque brown with tinges of ruby at the edges, head admirable, creamy and light tan in color, stays for a while, then leaves the lace to conceal the glass. Nose has a deep rich malt sweet aroma, caramel, toffee and a bit of peat, maybe a twig of heather, quite nice, clean and crisp to the senses. Start has a sweet malt presence, touch of spiciness at the back, light to moderate in feel. Finish has a pleasant acidity, the hops understated, but adequate, sweet toffee to the dry end, quite a good drinking beer, seems I find less and less Scottish ales."
"A tad thin at times on the mouth, but a nice thick finish. A good session Scottish."
"Didn't really do it for me, though. I found it a bit metallic and medicinal with a thin mouthfeel for the style. Certainly easy to drink, though, with interesting flavor characteristics that you don't find in most American ales. I'd get it again if looking for something different, but I prefer most other Scottish ales / wee heavies I've tried."
"500 ml bottle, bought at Peckhams, Glasgow. Deep amber to copper coloured beer, decent off-white head. Lovely fruity aroma, also notes of malts and caramel, hints of spices. The flavour is fairly fruity and moderately malty, with distinct hops throughout, also notes of toffee. Well balanced. A very nice bitter!"
"that bitter chocolate follows the nose into the taste of the beer itself. not at the start, but in the finish of each mouthful (well, not the very end...buut close). there's some big hop character at the end, as well. all in all a very different scottish ale. it's thin and doesn't sport the typical sweetness and chewiness. in fact, it's really not sweet"
"Highly recommended."
"It pours a cloudy brackish brown with little head and only slight lacing. The smell is the best part of this beer. You get a nice blend of bready malt, some hops, and some sweet fruit aromas (maybe raisin or currents or figs). The consistency is watery and pretty thin and light bodied. I would have preferred something heavier. The taste is nice, but again, too watery. The sweetish malts are pronounced and then it dissipates. You get a bit of a burnt flavor. There is very little carbonation in this beer. There is a smallish bite in the aftertaste where the hoppiness comes out. It is the dissipation in the mid to end of the taste that is the most troubling and which compromises this beer. The mouthfeel is very light. There just isn't enough here to sink into. Not a bad beer though."
"A 500ml bottle poured into a pint glass. It was a cloudy brown with a thin head that had an oily sheen to it. Nice aroma: toffee, butterscotch, dark fruit. However, something happened between the aroma and the taste. Initially sweet, then nothing was there, then some sharp hops showed up. Not a very pleasing taste. Doubt that I'll try this particular Scottish Ale again."
"This was great in all aspects until it got to the mid-taste on the palate, then it fell off sharply. What a shame. Still, it was good, and I'll give it a 4 on Taste, but just barely. Its certainly better than a 3.5. I can't say that I would keep a ready supply on hand, but I would drink it again on occasion. Might be helped by a good cheese to fill in the dead spot. I'd recommend it, but there are other examples of the style that are better. If you like a bit of a crudeness to your ales, then definitely give it a shot."
"Maybe a little thin, not much carbonation at all. It's very smooth, and the head stays around long enough to be mostly creamy. On the light side in alcohol and body. This is a sessionable Scottish ale."
"Gives a good dark-amber hue with a nice head, Nice smell with woody essence but notes of malt and hops nicely balanced for style. good smooth sweet taste also fitting of style, however it would be nice if it had a much more full body. The tastes are good however not as prominant as personally desired."
"D- Pretty easy going down, kind of light over all drinkable beer."
"Aroma is a rich dark deep malt, quite roasty. Flavor is of strong hops, very sharp, with a pronounced yeast quality (what a surprise). A bitterness reminiscent of overboiled coffee finished it for me- not recommended."
"Notes: Session would be out for me as it is not very refreshing."
"M&D: softly carbonated on the palate, quite light for the full flavour; A malty+fruity Premium Bitter style beer, with a complex hop flavour and and a much lighter body than the flavour suggests, yet ever so quaffable. Now I really wonder if my previous encounter with the cask-conditioned version suffered from the ""nearly off"" factor, as the hop characteristic was too mild to be noticeable."
"This is a nice toasty ale that is a great session beer. It has an abundance of flavor."
"Poured a deep brown with a reddish hue with a thinner light brown head some chunks and floaties swirling around.Light aromas of choclate malt and caramel maybe a hint of hard water or iron.A very soft malty flavored brew up front light chocolate and caramel flavors with an underlying herbal English hop flavor that comes thru more in the finish and as it warms.A thinner bodied beer but very sociable, a nice Scottish ""small"" beer."
"Drinkability: A very pleasant Scottish that is marked down a bit for its mediocre finish"
"Chestnut color that cant be beat. Chunky, fluffy white head that looks almost like rice pudding from the top! Sweet,caramel and malt aroma. Slight sherry tinge. Malt dominates the flavor. Very mild hop bite to it. Treacle and toffeeish flavors. Nice malty sweetness in the finish. Great body for the listed abv. An excellent beer-very full and well rounded. Retired? Damn shame."
"Drinkability is good, I could have more than one if I had to. I really need something with more hops."
"Well carbonated, good summer drink. Brown, big initial head of cream. Lace and off-white head. Malt and sourness significant contributions. Scotch, barleywine aroma. Grassy,hops present copper of UK ales, fine when you share the bottle. Easy drinking."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent that is full of roasted and caramel malts. It is dry, yet sweet with a bitter hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a solid ""amber"" base consisting of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It is sweet on the swallow and bitter on the finish. It has a sweet malty character that is well balanced with hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good Scottish ale. It's full of malt flavor along with a good hop character; a fine sessions beer."
"Dark copper with a weak head. The aroma is very malty with a hint of peat. Its also heavily sweet with caramel and brown sugar. The flavor isnt overly sweet (the aroma would have fit a cloyingly sweet beer, so it wouldnt have been unexpected), but does have a cake-like malt quality that complements the aroma nicely. Theres virtually no bitterness. The body is a bit thin, however."
"This is a very easygoing, Scottish ale that is very highly drinkable except for its above average price tag."
"Pours a deep amber colour with a creamy head which dimishes to lacing left all the way down the glass. A good malty nose with some faint hops making themselves known. The citrusy hops were a surprise in the taste for a Scottish beer and the caramel malts balanced out the hops nicely, and the beer finished pleasingly bitter. Slightly thin mouthfeel but nevertheless smooth. A nice ale, although I prefer Inveralmond's Ossians Ale, but certainly a decent offering from the folks in Perth."
" A classic example of a Scottish Ale ( 40 Shilling give or take ) and while pricey and not earth shattering, worth checking out."
"Lia Fail is good beer that makes no missteps during the short journey from bottle to stomach. I would prefer that it have a bit more heft and a more assertive flavor, but then it wasn't designed as that sort of beer. Devotees of the style could do much worse than this fine, representative Scottish Ale."
"An easily drunk beer, but thats about it. Doesn't give me anything out of the ordinary."
"Medium bodied, not bad it just didn't do much for me."
"16.9 ounce bottle. According to the label should be a bitter. I can believe that. A nice session beer."
"A very enjoyable light Scottish Ale and an easy choice for a session beer. Solid. Though ... I would have preferred a bit more malt backbone."
"Really like this beer even though my personal preference this side of the Atlantic is Belhaven Wee Heavy."
"Defineitely a damn good beer, definitely worth anyone's time, but have to wonder if it's really worth the $5.29 I paid for the 500ml bottle...once, or twice, maybe, but not too often."
"Pours with a off-white two-fingered head that fades and leaves some lace. Clear, deep amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts with a rich mix of malts and hops, finishes smooth with a trace of hops; good Scottish ale. $4.20 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"I have to say that when I bought this beer I had no idea what to expect... it comes in an attracttive 1 pint 9 oz bottle that talks about the Stone of Destiny... also called Lia Fail. It states that it has won an award in the Premium Bitter category - this however is not a bitter. It's more of a session scottish ale... maybe what would be called a 60 Shilling Ale in Scottland. Pours a slightly hazy deep amber with a thin but persistent tan head that leaves behind some patches of lace. Aroma is a mix of caramel, toffee, and some light bread notes with a touch of espresso. Flavor begins sweet with malty notes of caramel, and chocolate, finishing with some smokiness, notes of tobacco, and a touch of coffee. Bitterness is low, and mainly just there for balance. Mouthfeel is light with low carbonation. This is a mighty fine Scottish Ale... very easy to drink but quite complex. One hell of a good session ale!"
"This is an easy quaffing ale. Good for a hot summer's night."
"There was a good deal of complexity and overlapping flavors to the malts, nicely balanced with the hop overtones. This was a nice drinking beer, and I enjoyed it. Definitely worth a try."
"From the Inveralmond Brewery in Scotland comes an astonishingly full-flavored session ale. Its slightly hazy (it's bottle-conditioned), deep copper colored body borders on chestnut; resting gently geneath a long-lasting head of creamy white foam as its very fine bubbles slowly rise to the surface. The nose displays a distinctly rich, caramel-drenched maltiness. The body is surprisingly full, adding to a fuller perception of malt in the flavour; and its very fine, natural carbonation leaves it exceptionally creamy and smooth across the palate. In the flavor, a hint of some darker malts (perhaps a touch of roasted barley) lend depth to its rich, caramel side; and some subtle, delicately spicy and grassy hops round it out. The maltiness is perfectly balanced by its firm bitterness, and leads to a dry finish (that's again surprising given its full maltiness). A really well brewed beer that shows a clean fermentation and impeccable sense of balance. Quite exceptional, and certainly one of the best Scottish ales available at this time!"
"Medium brown and clear appearance. Sturdy pale yellow head, long lasting and creamy -- settles at under 1/2 an inch. Laces in partial drips. Nice aroma, toffee with jazzy nutmeg and a definite floral hopping showing through. Smooth mouthfeel, a little light but quaffable. Starts with butterscotch and some maple sugar, very nice transition to a cinnamony and prickly hop. Finishes lightly but continuing in the enhanced bittering, like a sound turning up. A thumb's up brew in my book, composed, subtle, but making a point."
"Drinkability is very pleasant but nothing outstanding."
