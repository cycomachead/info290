3.51,-8.8,3.75,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,"Microbrewer in Avion, Indiana let's give it a go!!! Pours almost blood orange crimson brown, definite ruby highlights when held toward the light. Aroma has some dirty malt, just a touch of Wheaties mixed with hints of cardboard box, added to that is some cooling fresh baked browines. A slight underlying dark plum juiciness exceeds out of the complexity of this 8% Scottish Ale. Heavy cereal grains, layered dark chocolate, quite a messy malt driven complexity with more wet cardboard and uneven lost in translation carbonation carrying it across the palate. A very rough abrasive beer, I hate to say that but that's what I'm getting thus far. It goes from smooth roasty to acrid acidic with a linger wet cardboard off putting note that I can't erase from my memory. Overall the harsh mouthfeel weak carbonation isn't expressive of the whole picture, there's a good beer somewhere here, preserve what you have and get through the rough patches of starting a brewery in 2010 not the best beer yet, but there's potential in the glass.","WVbeergeek","Feb 08, 2014"

Its not at the very top of my list but really quite a nice combination of flavors and very drinkable.","kaplunk02","Dec 20, 2013"

They did a good job of picking various flavors to bring out a unique beverage, which is becoming so difficult to do among the many many competitors. Recommended? I'm not sure. I guess it depends. it would be a great "I want to go out on a limb and try something different, and I'm in a store with this right in front of me" brew. I don't think I'd go looking for it, and I don't think it would be the end-all "I'm looking for a great scotch ale, this may be it" choice.","karengarys","Jul 11, 2013"

Great caramel flavors, as well, with hints of toffee; huge sweet malt flavors, nice earthy hop finish; nice peatiness as it warms up. Goes down very well for a bomber of 8% ABV. The guy at Big Red called this one quite well.","JamesS","Dec 06, 2011"
