4.6,16.8,4.5,5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"It poured a little thicker then it's base. Very little head, A little stayed around the edge of the glass. The smell had vanilla, toffee, and small amount of fruit in it. Definitely alot of bourbon coming out in this one. The taste matched the smell, very nice bourbon notes, when taking the tour I saw the barrels they used are from Heaven Hill. The fruits definitely came thru in the middle and then ended very smoothly. The mouthfeel was low to medium carbonation, it held had great consistency and was not thin at all. Overall this is a great BA brew, go pick some up, it is one of the best BA I have had in GA.","dbrelsfo","Beers"
