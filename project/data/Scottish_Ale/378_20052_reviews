"Overall: I generally like Atlantic's offerings, but this one just did not hold up to previous Scottish ales that I have tried. This drinks more like an imperial porter and is missing a lot of the Scottish spices that I associate with the style. For me, this is a pass."

"Mild start, but it becomes dark and quite smoky, almost like a Rauchbier. Smooth finish with a short aftertaste. I detect some dark, unsweetened chocolate with some dark cherry deep in the background. The body is a bit thin with an elevated carbonation level."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, ruby coloring, almost black in the depths, with a thin, off-white head remaining a dense, low profile while you drink. Nose of rich caramel sweetness, with hints of smoke, scotch notes, and floral highlights. Flavors are rich and robust, with a scotch undertone and slight booze warmth supporting a caramel highlight and smoky blend. Smooth and slightly robust body, with a rich, robust, smoked aftertaste. Rich, sweet linger on a slick, slightly cloying finish. Big beer, but solid."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but nothing I would seek out. I can think of other scottish ales I'd rather drink over this one."

"O - Overall it's alright, it's a little rough around the edges, the fruity character almost tastes off and doesn't add to the enjoyment. I like that they brewed this true to style, with heather nibs, but not the best example I have had."

"This was a fun one. Not only was it a great beer but we only had one glass so my wife and I passed it back and forth in front of a campfire. Good camping beer."

"Poured a 1/2"" latte head of brief life. The body in masstone is a deep burnt umber brown and held to the light there is zero light penetration. Smells of toasted malt. The taste has moderately rich malt which is followed by a dark cocoa finish. Kind of reminds me of a lighter porter. Decent beer, easy drinking, but to me it's not a standout of the Scotch ales."
"Overall: It was a decent beer. Something I would sip on perhaps while cooking on the grill or BBQing. Not my first choice, but if it was there I would have it again."

"D/O- overall one of the better Scottish ales I've had. No bottle date but I'm thinking this has a year or two on it...not negatively affected though, actually compliments it I feel. Thanks mikeyv35."
""
"overall, a nice little (or big as it were)scottish ale, and pleasant enough to sip on, just a touch to sweet for me."
"Dr. A big beer, filling, plently of flavor, but kind of muddled. It's good, but the flavors are so blended that I can't sort it out. It will NOT be a problem to finish off the bomber."

"This beer poured out as a nice deep color brownish red color. The head was pretty nice. The smell is floral and earthy. There is ani e hop aroma too. The taste of the beer had a good floral flavor to it, with some spicy flavors. The mouthfeel is very nice, plenty of carbonation and soft at the same time. Overall this beer is way bed tree than the dub el in my opinion. Nicely done!"
"O - Awesome scottish ale. I'll definitely get this again for a larger tasting of this style."
"Overall, a decent brew. I would have this again."
"Beer is thinner than expected and has this peaty flavor to it, smoky on the finish but it is not overpowering. Not the best beer I've ever had but I see why it is so highly rated. It is a sipper overall not bad. Well balanced between the malt and the smoke, not very complex but I'd have it again."
"Pours a clear copper-brown color with an average off-white head and some sparse spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings through a moderate amount of bready malt along with some light caramel and a bit of a nutty character. The flavor adds some light smoke, which works well in tandem with a bit of roast and toast. Mild character comes from the heather tips, which dry out the finish. Medium body and some fizzy carbonation. Good smoke element in the finish as well. Nice beer."
"Overall this is an interesting, good, smooth interpretation of a Scottish Ale. Not mind blowing, just solid. Worth a go because of the fair price tag, but I don't think this is the best example of the style as it currently rates on this website."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Has a deep mahogany wood look with a nice reddish hue when held up to the light. Comes with a 1 finger eggshell head that slowly dissolved to a nice ever present lace. Lots of great aroma on this one. Standard toffee, caramel, dark malts present like in all scotch ales, but what makes this unique is the light floral component that is definitely present. On tasting, the floral/heather component was even more pronounced. Very unique compared to other scotch ales I've sampled. It makes the beer extremely drinkable, and it tastes ""lighter"" than other scotch ales I've tried. In fact I don't really pick up on the alcohol at all which is somewhat surprising considering it comes in just shy of 8% ABV. Nice hint of smoke/peat which is something I want in my scotch ales as well. This stuff is rock solid and I will definitely seek it out again. If you like the style and want to try something a little different give it a try."
"Overall not bad, but not great either, some nice malty flavors, a touch of the herbal hops and heather give it a strange mix, nothing too off of it, but could have used a bit more carbonation, otherwise not bad."
"This is a drinkable scott and the sweet roast makes easy to drink"
"This is mellow but complex at the same time. Creamy with low carbonation. One of the more drinkable Scottish ales I've had."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid burnt toffee and smoked malt scent along with hints of heather and a dry finish. The taste is decent. It has a malty flavor that boasts of crystal and smoked malts. It goes down slow and rich with some light esters and a bone dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average Scottish ale. It's flavorful, but it's definitely not a strong recreation of this style."
"*Also seems to go well with food."
"Picked up a 22 oz bottle on August 19th 2010. Color is dark brown not quite Guinness Dark. Little or no head but did have some lacing. Hardly detectable alcohol,. Very complex flavor I could swear that someone put black licorice in the bottle, this is followed by a nice somewhat hoppy finish. Very well balanced and drinkable."
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle with no lot code or expiration date. Sampled on July 20, 2010. The pour is a rich mahogany brown with ruby red highlights but little in the way of head or lacing. Black currants or cranberries seem to be the first noticeable ingredients in the aroma followed by vaguely smoked malts. The mouthfeel tends to be oily and of medium body. The taste has a kind of black licorice element to it with heather tips, light malts, and a very nice hopped ending. It is easy to drink."
"A thick brown black color with a healthy oatmeal colored head and decent lacing. The aroma is an odd swampy malt, sort of a seaweed deal. The flavor is similar with a nice herbal chocolate hop and sweet red wine. The odd herbal theme dominates with a smooth mid-bodied feel. Mildly carbonated and pretty easy drinking. Different and worth a try."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a coca cola brown color with a decent frothy light brown head, quickly disappearing, fair lacing. Aroma is peat smoked and roasted malts, a touch of chocolate, and a bit of earthiness. Flavor is roasted malts, smoke, chocolate, raisins, and grapes. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, dry and bitter at the finish. Warms well. Pretty good beer, although a little light for the style, almost quaffable."
"This is a highly drinkable beer due to the smooth creaminess. The alcohol is not detectable, except a little in the aroma. Great all around beer."
"Re-review on 4.11.10. This bottle was nowhere near as good as the first, which was amazing. I guess a little quality control is in order...or maybe the bottle was old, but this should age well. Flavor and mouthfeel was thin...like I was drinking a totally different beer.. Not saying it was bad, but it didn't blow me away like the first one. Will give this another try, but my local beer place had some of these in closeout so maybe its retired? Oh well...there is always Old Chubb..."
"Palate was creamy with a subdued carbonation that was just crisp enough to go perfectly with the (surprisingly excellent) barbecue served at Atlantic's own brewpub. Marvelous job."
"Out of a bomber picked up at the brewery this ale was a deep, nearly opaque brown color with one-finger of khaki head. The aroma was of roasted malt, sweet malt and peat smoke. The flavors were a little unusual, I kept thinking 'good BBQ sauce'! Roasted malt, peat smoke, caramel malt and a good hoppy bitterness that nipped the very end. Slightly acidic but not unpleasantly so. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation perfect, the body medium/full. A good beer, but I bet it would make an even better marinade!"
"Notes from 10/9/06"
"It's an interesting, delicious, smooth interpretation of a Scottish Ale that is oh so easy to drink."
"Flavor is sweet and slightly smokey or peaty. Easy drinking with only malt flavors to speak of, no hops or ABV present. Nice malty brew."
"smells a tiny bit smoky, sweet and roasty. taste is initially sweet with a sharper bite on the finish. a little oily on the mouthfeel, lingers on the tongue. easy drinking for a pretty strong scottish ale."
"22oz bomber from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a nearly opaque dark brown/black body with ruby-red highlights and a thin film of light tan head. Smells roasty, slightly peaty, with chocolate notes. Tastes sweet and malty, with roast, caramel, chocolate, and hints of peatiness. Medium to full in body with moderate carbonation. A good combination and balance of flavors, though it reminds me of some mid-point between a Scottish and Scotch ale. A solid and flavorful beer."
"22oz bomber purchased at Downeast Beverage in Portland."
"D : Pretty good beer, wouldn't mind having it again"
"Drinkability: this was extremely eay to quaff and would be a nice session beer despite the slightly higher alcohol levels."
"D: Better then average drinkability with a nice mineral touch."
"Wow, that is a great tasting beer. It has a nice subtle smokey taste that I really like. It cuts the sweetness very well. The alcohol, although noticeable as a smell, is not overly present in the taste. It has some nuttiness to it and a very nice finish. I really like this one, another solid beer from Atlantic."
"The alcohol in the aroma is missing in the taste. Very smooth drinkable beer. Heavy on the malt flavors as par for the style. Caramel with a bit of earthy spiciness in the finish. Excellent mouthfeel. Medium bodied and just chewy enough with out being too thick. I would love to have this one again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, kind of filling, nice kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to relax with and drink slowly, but after one bomber I think I'd be done."
"Not too bad. I held on to this for a while, and I don't think it was to it's detriment at all. It just can't match up to some of the authentic examples from across the pond."
"Not a fan of strong Scottish ales but this is one of the better ones I've had. A smoother feel would have aided this beer I think, maybe remove some of the alcohol tones."
"I don't find this to be all that exciting, and it's rather straightforward and not very complex. Still, it is tasty and is a beer I'd have again if I came across it."
"Unlike other scottish ales I've had, this one is less sweet, amazingly flavorful and drinks much lighter than it is. If you get a chance to try one definitely go for it."
"Very drinkable... About 20 ounces to go too!"
"The finish leaves a smoky backwoods taste that makes you feel like your sitting next to a fire. Without being overwelming. A must try for scottish ale fans!"
"Has a nice big body with very little carbonation. The alcohol cannot be detected. A small bit sweet, but the finish dries out the palate a bit. Very easy to drink for a big beer. I wish I had a steady supply of this."
"Pours a deep, rich brown color. No real head going on. Moderate aroma-caramel and a slight peat smell. Malty flavor dominates. Peat flavor is very evident. Theres a spicy/floral flavor that I am assuming is from the heather the label says it contains. Good mouth feel to it-the caramel leaves me smacking the top of my mouth for more sticky goodness. A very nice scottish ale-maybe a bit heavy on the peated malt but very enjoyable overall."
"it's alot like an american brown. not bad; not on to style, but i forgive"
"I would be curious to know the proportion of peat-smoked versus not malt in this beer."
"Pours with nice colours, mahogony/auburn brown, and sparse bubbles rising along the outside of the glass. Lovely appearence. Equally nice aroma. Caramely-cola malt, light booze, and hints of heather. The flavour is a different story alltogether, not at all evident from the aroma. The two features really offer different things. Taste of burnt wood, alot of smoked peet. A great deal of solid malt. A really, really nice offering."
"Pours a clear brown/red, thick off white head forms, lace spots, decent retention, keeps a thin layer. Smell is very malty, some floral/herbs, earthy, with some toffee, very neat. Taste is very earthy and malty, floral, quite mild in the flavour but pleasant, little bit of smoke and alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. A nice drink, thanks northyorksammy!!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is on the plus side of medium bodied. The carbonation is low but well incorporated. This is a very easy to drink beer. I enjoyed the beer from start to finish. I would gladly drink this beer again."
"Clear, dark brown beer topped by a bit of coarse foam that produced a little lace. The aroma was mostly malty, nutty, and floral, but there was also a bit of cola nut and a faint hint of smoke as well. Mild flavour, plenty of malt, roasted malt, and cola. Bitterness was low and hop flavour was mostly floral with a bit of herbal character. Medium/full bodied with fairly low carbonation, decent texture. This stuff is pretty good. I particularly liked the combination of malts. Thanks for sharing northyorksammy!"
"The beer was picked up in 22 oz. brown bomber with a Scottish tartan label background framing the image of a Scotsman shepherding in a highland pasture. The beer poured Coca Cola brown in color, with a similar evaporating fizz. The head was nonexistent, and the beer was also quite still after the first few seconds of activity. The aroma was malty and smoky and smelled like coffee, dark chocolate, and sawdust. The taste was mellow and the texture silky. The spicy hops (or was it heather) were more noticeable than typical, and a peat smoke dryness was persistent in the aftertaste. Almost a Porter, this Scottish Ale was quite different than others that I had tasted before. This was much less fruity and more bitter. Good on its own merits I suppose.."
"Big white bubbly head. very brown. Alcohol aroma. Good mouhfeel with biscuit and graininess.Herbal element from heather. scotch and malty and faint smoke, a tad of sourness at end.Cross-style, and understated achievement.Better than it smells, like an aged ale."
"drinkability is good. very tasty and balanced beer."
"Drinkability is okay. This one is pretty easy to put down but doesn't offer much to draw me back in for another bottle."
"This offering from Atlantic Brewing tempted me from the moment I saw it. I love Atlantic Brewing Co and now there presence in MA is growing. This Scottish ale pours a dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is malty, caramel, nutty, fruit, raisins, earthy floural hops, heather flowers, honey, a very complex aroma. The taste is smokey, chocolate, tangy, a bit bitter with a herbal presence but nicely mouthfeel on the palate. The finsh is fruity sweet with a little acidic feel on the back end of the palate. I paired this beer with turkey dinner and all the trimming and it was a great match."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light brown head over the clear dark burgundy brew. Aroma is dominated by smoky maltiness, with flowery notes. Taste follows right along with the nose, exactly as predicted. Mouthfeel is super smooth and soft over the tongue, tremendously drinkable. My mouth tells me this ain't no 7+%, but my head will probably verify the abv later. Excellent brew."
"Up until then, though, pretty tasty."
"A clean dark brown beer with deep mahogony highlights. Has a nice creamy light brown head with some nice lacing. The first aroma to hit you as you pour is a tangable but sweet smoky character. Hints of nuts and some light dried fruit dance in the background. There is an initial burst of malty sweetness at the start of the taste. Followed quickly by a quick ghost of smokiness and again the nutlike hints mixed with some dried fruit notes.The smokiness returns in the somwhat dry finish. The alcohol does not real make it self known until the end of the glass. So .. a Wee Heavy? I think not. A delicious Scottish style Ale ...Yes!"
"An interesting take on the genre. I'm predispositioned to Scottish & Scotch Ales, and I enjoyed this one. It does a good job hiding the almost 8% ABV, so be careful of the 22ozs. Atlantic did a nice job walking the line between Scottish Ale & Wee Heavy. Those of you looking for a nice autumnal brew or an interesting take on the genre should check it out. Could see this going great with a cheese soup as well. Well done, Atlantic!"
"I've tried many Atlantic offerings, with enjoyable results. This is no exception. It was a very dark brown, with a thim tan head. It had a roasted (quite) malt aroma, as well as some floral/grassy hints. Good hoppy taste, a little sweet. I thought I could taste a little honey. Fairly substantial, a beer to savor."
"Well my 2nd beer from Atlantic Brewing up in Bah Habbah, neat offering and the 1st time I've seen this. Pours nearly black in color, smell of sweet malt. Taste is of malt, roasted (almost burnt) malt and some grassy flavored hops, like mown lawn. Mouthfeel is not thin, very nice. Drinkability? One to savor. I think a lot of people would think this is some kind of stout, but it's a Scottish Ale. It says that it's hopped with heather. I can't taste it but it's still a really nice beer."
"Appears a dark reddish hue with decent sized tan head. Some rings of lacing were left as this was consumed. Sweet malty aroma with some fruits and caramel. Lighter earthy notes mingled about. Sweet fruit blended with a bit of dark chocolate started off the flavor. Light smoky and earthy herbal notes mixed in well. Pretty full and interesting taste. Easy drinking stuff that is smooth going down and the last sip is as tasty as the first."
"Damn ... you ... MacFoochie!"
"Overall- a decent Scottish Ale that is a good sipping beer. Nothing outstanding here."
"Pours a deep rich brown with ruby highlights, topped by a small khaki head that vanishes almost instantly. Aroma of roasted caramel malt, some molasses, and a hint of piny hops. Palate is well-balanced and complex: a backbone of sweet roasted caramel malt, accented by slightly spicy and piny hops, with an underlying fruity sweetness. The alcohol provides a nice, warming finish. Body is smooth, but not too rich. Definitely a good Scottish ale, and one of the best offerings from Atlantic."
"Finishes quick with toasted nuts on chocolate."
"My first impression about this ale was that it would be like most Scottish ale's, with a relatively easy drinkability, but lacking in the over taste and mouthfeel; this was not the case. Atlantic has brought a great beer to my table, with a wonderfully dark, almost pitch-black colouration, and a exceptional aroma of beautifully balanced hops. There was no malt aroma or flavouring, which is a plus. The abv is certainly not a factor, and is not noticed. This ale has a wonderfully smooth feel, and very easy drinkability. Overall, I would most certainly rate this beer as an A."
"many thanks to brewguru for the bottle!"
"Pours a cream, one finger-head that goes quickly leaving no lace. Clear deep amber almost black color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is floral - no strong hoppiness. Starts and finishes with a light complex of flavors - peat, malt, bread. Smooth, alcohol is not noticeable. $7.59 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"797"
"Cream crenellation of head to start that falls down to just a shawl of all-sized bubbles. Very clear but deep brown hue with burgundy touches and some flitting action. Light peat smokiness on nose with a mossy presence and light floral note, which Id take a stab at as being the heather. Great smoke on mouth right away, malt finagles its way through quite nicely with some caramel, toffee, and Sumatra coffee notes. Well-balanced ale with just the right amount of burn."
"Dirty, earthy aromas of peat and grape skin. Alcohol is noticeable but seems to fit in nicely with the cola-like caramel notes that assert themselves. Smooth and, at times, almost oily, this has a chewy malt flavor with a light alcohol astringency that seems to fade as the beer sits or as I adjust to it. Either way, the beer tastes and feels quite natural. The finish isn't quite as distinct or abrupt as some beers. It's much more cohesive and well-rounded, presenting a solid malt flavor throughout and somehow just ""feeling"" balanced in the end. Must be the heather. Top notch stuff."
"Drinkability is very solid. Heather is an acquired taste and sometimes flat out does not work. However, with this beer the combination and transitions are excpetionally well done. Very nice brew."
"Wyll-"
"Best Scottish ale I ever had! Good session brew with a lighter mouthfeel and sweetness."
