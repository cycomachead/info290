"Very interesting and tasty ale but I prefer a touch more complexity on the tongue for the style."

"Great beer, a perfect ""Orcadian Ale"" enhanced by the whisky aging. The best from the brewery and personally it surpassed some russian imperials and scotch ales that i usually hold dear."

"A lovely interplay of complex flavours, it is malty and fruity with vanilla and oak, big presence but so smooth drinking, one to try for sure."
"Body feels a bit light."

"I poured the beer into a glass chalice. It was dark. Some light got through, and the color was dark brown. The head was coffee with cream color. I could smell some fruit. The taste started out heavy on fruit and vanilla and oak. I couldn't taste much peat or other flavors I associate with whisky initially. As I worked through the bottle, more roasty and peaty flavors came out. The beer was easy on my mouth, thick and rich. I noticed a warmth from the alcohol instead of a burn."
"O-an intesely dark ale that slaps you across the face with its boldness. Could have perhaps benefited from another 6 months in the bottle."

"D - nicely done, the aroma is much better than the flavor, but everything works well in the end."
"Two finger head that dissipates rapidly on a jet black body. Aroma is stronglyof whiskey and scotch, mint, molasses, cinnamon. Flavors are very dull, with the whiskey understated in sharpness but still providing flavor. Supporting notes include dark chocolate, citrus, earthy hops, rye breads and licorice. The aroma is great, the flavor is a little mild but still keeps the whiskey flavor while staying very drinkable. Very nice whiskey aged brew"

"Beautiful dark brown pour with a one finger beige head with minimal retention and crazy lacing. The nose is earthy with rich dark caramel malts dominating along with hints of mocha. As it warms, a strong vinous character emerges along with evidence of the barrel aging and hints of whiskey. The taste follows suit, dominated initially by loads of roasty cocoa, espresso, and dark chocolate. As with the nose, the taste really opens up as it warms. Unlike some big barrel aged beers, it's not in your face. The woody vinous notes are subtle but so delicious. Hints of oak, vanilla, whiskey, and dark fruit round it out nicely. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a subtle sweet and dry finish. Overall, this is my definition of a comfort beer. Big, but not too big, rich and bold, but not in your face. A world class beer!"

"Bottled April 3, 2012, poured Feb 1, 2013z Pours dark brown almost black. Big very light brown head. Very pretty. Aroma is sherry, peat whiskey, hints of chocolate, raisins, anise, licorice, and a bit of roasted grain and smoke. A lot going on here. Flavor of a nice scotch, took my breath away on the first sip. Really not expecting that. Not boozy but lots of peat and whiskey here with a warm finish. Only medium thickness on the palate. Lasting explosion of chocolate that leaves a bit of sweetness on the palate. Smokey oak with a red wine (merlot) quality about it. Very intense sipper, but surprisingly drinkable as the alcohol is not strong (though the scotch flavor certainly is). Something everyone should seek out. Awesome bottle and labeling, too. And I can recork this for later, which is nice."
"It is a bit strange that I get more wine barrel than whisky cask in terms of woody adjuncts, given the proclaimed Orkney-local production methods. Oh well, esters are a funny thing, they can act as the chimera, rendering things in a slightly different manner from what they truly are. Anyhow, this is a splendid Scottish ale, with strong dry stout predilections, well integrated barrel notes, and a much more subtle alcohol profile than I was led to believe up until quite recently. Worth the wait, indeed, and I feel that I have not let today's celebratory poet down, at least not yet."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, dark fruits, port, whisky, and wood. Taste is much the same with a slightly sour fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and rich."
"Overall - Obviously a far cry from Dark Island, but that isn't a bad thing. Hell of an expensive bottle, but that doesn't surprise me so much these days. Good beer and very different from normal stuff I drink."

"O. Aroma had me a little concerned. Taste didnt dissapoint. I was pretty impressed with this beer. Has really good qualities of a Scottish ale and Imperial Stout. Good beer. Lots of flavor and smooth to drink."

"Hey - I wasn't blown away initially (3 years back) by this, however, drinking it now, I've probably for the first time experienced a ""cellared"" (if not ideally) strong ale. Interesting. Some things to take forward..."
"This is a great beer. The price point suggests it and the beer delivers. At the price, I probably wouldn't buy it, but if you have a chance to try it (or go in halvsies), I highly recommend it."
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottled in late 2011. Pours a magnificent almost black with a 3 inch dark tan head, with beautiful lace. Smell is dark fruit, leather, tobacco, apricot, smoke, dark chocolate, and whiskey. Taste is all that, apricot starts, with leather and dark chocolate, and obviously some whiskey in the finish. Body is medium to heavy perfect, great amount of carbonation, a little dry as expected, and drinkability is exactly what you would expect. Thanks Tom for bringing this to celebrate my daughters birth, excellent beer!"
"Overall a very enjoyable beer."
"Decided to crack this one Saturday night while relaxing and wacthing the Stanley Cup finals. Poured into a snifter. Dark black with just the slight trace of a tan head. Smells strong of whiskey, some choclate and vanilla, some fig/dried fruit, some roastiness, but alot of whiskey, i feel like i'm about to take a sip of whiskey rather than beer. Taste is much the same, although luckily not quite dominated by the whiskey as much as the aroma is. Also, definitely got better as it warmed, (probably should have let it sit a bit before cracking it),the other flavors shine through more. Definitely not a lot of carbonation here. Overall, maybe a tad too much whiskey for my liking for this beer to truely blow me away, but still made for a very enjoyable Saturday night while sipping on this one. (slept well too.)"

"Overall - An excellent barrel aged brew... highly recommended if you can track it down.."
"O - Was not a very big fan of this beer, but it could very well be taht I didn't understand the style well enough. That being said, I just didn't really like drinking it a whole lot."

"Opened this and shared a bottle with my cousins at my grandmothers 80th birthday party over the weekend. I had been super excited to try this one since I got it a few months ago. The Beer poured out black, and thick looking. There was a thin brownish colored head on top that hung around for a good while but since I was sipping this for over an hour but the time I finished it was gone. The smell of this beer is awesome, the aromas of whiskey, wood, apple, cherry, roasted malts and chocolate all spew from the glass into the nose. The taste of this beer is really really nice, the aromas that are on the nose come full force onto the tongue for a really crazy joyride of flavors from start to finish. The apples and cherries come in a little tart up front but the roast malts keep it sweet and then in the aftertaste the chocolate dominates without and doubt. The mouthfeel of this beer has a really nice semi-thick body to it with some light carbonation. Overall this beer is very impressive. Hands down it has to be Orkney's best and I really enjoy Skullsplitter. This one just has so much to offer, it's not cheap by any means but I could see myself having this one again someday."
"Great contrast to the normal Dark Island. A big beer, and one put away for sure."
"Note: Since this was in a swing-top I took the leftover beer home and tried it again the next day. I discovered that I actually liked it quite a bit more. I'll still probably end up baking with a portion of this beer, but I'd argue that this is best appreciated on a clean palate."
"The taste is powerful, a lot of sweet maltiness, quite a bit booze, some roasty bitterness and a full delicious body to wrap it all inn. Too bad it is a limited edition."
"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this beer.  It is a really nice barrel aged beer that is recommended!"
"This is a good beer with a stunning based but the barrel aging process has drawn out the beer and made it a bit thin making the beer less delicious from with the fruitiness and barrel notes not having enough malt and body to support them."
"Bottled March 27, 2010. Served from swing-top bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, alcohol, wood, and chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, alcohol, and slight mothballs (oxidation perhaps?). It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall I was not really a massive fan of this one. The slight mothball flavor coupled with the alcohol made this one tough to get through. The mothball flavor wasn't very strong at all as it was quite muted, but still present nonetheless. Upon opening this thing I was concerned I would take a sip and drain pour it, but I was actually able to finish the full bottle. Just took quite awhile..."
"D-this has an interesting aspect, lots of booze and sweetness with a strong malt presence. somewhat straight forward and rather sweet."
"Notes: Overall I really liked the mix of whisky and rich chocolaty malt along with a good showing of dark fruit. I liked the mixture of sweet and whisky, neither are too powerful and work well together."
"Pours an oil-slick black, smallish head, no lacing. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, and molasses. Taste is a mirror image of dark chocolate, molasses, and vanilla. Medium-full body with light carbanation. Drinkable and in a beautiful bottle, but a bit expensive for not being a standout."
"This is excellent, just like everything else from the brewery. A great combination of smoked peat and fruits. It really melds together well. It becomes more and more vinous and wine like as this warms up. Very unique. Something I highly recommend."
"Maybe the bottled version is better."
"Its a really cold night tonight and thought this be a nice one for sitting by the fire,it pours a dark chocolate hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head and some sporadic lacing that slowly settles down to resemble a whiskey and cola,it has a very distinct aroma of whiskey,some peat,oak and dark fruits lingering in the background,it has a really nice mouthfeel to it which feels complex yet finishes very smooth and easy with tastes of whiskey,caramel,plums and some spicy oak and to be honest ill easily finish this 750ml bottle without doubt its an interesting brew that would buy again and store as i did with this one."
"I had it on a couple of occasions and while not too cold it sure need not be too warm since it loses some of its drinkability and strangely enough the nuances and long range get blended into one losing a bit its sense. Slightly above cellar temp might be best..."
"D - The whiskey and alcohol character is pretty timid, surprisingly, although the vanilla presence was definitely a welcome addition. Ultimately, this fell a bit short overall, and the flavor just drops off too quickly without ever reaching the ""dark island."""
"D - I enjoyed this -it is a tasty beer, but not outrageously good. I was glad I got to try it as I liked the original, but I couldn't justify going out of my way for a repeat - taste - Thanks to FooFaa for sharing this!"
"D: At 10%, this is a beer to share. A nice treat that I don't think I'd normally seek out."
"Not spectacular but a very pleasant drinking beer. Lots of nice balance between sweet and roasty."
"A very good brew all up - lots of character and extremely full-flavoured. While it lacks something a little in complexity, it surely makes it up with big ballsy roasted stoutness. Stays surprisingly smooth and drinkable throughout. I'm a fan."
"Hand bottled in September 2008. Pours dark brown/black with basically no head. Aroma is some smokey peat as well as caramel. The flavor is slightly sweet with some caramel malt, roasted malt and some smoke and chocolate. Medium mouthfeel. Very creamy mouthfeel."
"Tasted alongside a bunch of really big beers, toward the end. That I was able to taste what I could taste in this beer, after the bruising my palate took up to this point, shows me what a fantastic beer this is."
"750 ml from Bruisin' Ales. Pours dark grey with bubbly head, looks caskish. Scotch whiskey in the nose. The tasting begins with scotch whiskey, nuttiness, and ends with some roast malt, chocolate and smoked peat in a long finish. Very good, it must be shared."
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Gyle #4. Aroma is definitely very, very strong of whisky, with some toasted malts. This should be interesting. Definitely a sipper, very strong in alcohol taste. Almost seems like maybe some whisky was left in the barrel and blended into the beer. I would think that this would be difficult to pair with food and may only be paired with a cigar. Bottled in September, 2008, now a year old, I think that actually the beer will benefit with even more age. Not my favorite style, but I appreciate the eff out of this effort."
"I found the taste to be a little less than I was expecting from such a grand bottle, but I could pick out the enjoyable elements right away. Clearly, this sipper was one of those one could sit back and enjoy with a quality cigar."
"D- A real treat that I've been looking forward to for months. I'll have to pick up one of these myself and repay the favor at some point."
"D: Not quite as good as I had hoped for. Still recommended though. Lacks some balance."
"I'd been looking forward to enjoying this bottle for a few months, after having picked it up while in Kirkwall during mid-March. While it has been great fun to try, and I generally enjoyed it, I must confess that it is probably my least favourite of the different Orcadian beers (approx. 8) I had there. Still, a fun treat."
"Really tasty brew. Very unique. Love the whisky hints throughout (could do without the price though)."
"D: Nice sipper. Seeing as this is a pretty rare beer, and at $25 a bottle, I don't expect to have it again. But I'm glad I picked it up and tried it."
"d: a bit rough around the edges but will mellow nicely with age, I plan on buying the next bottle for aging!"
"Rerate, 750 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10%. Brewed 23rd Sept. 2008, bottled 10th Dec. 2008. Pitch black colour, moderate brown head. The aroma is still vinous (sherry), oaky and roasty - also notes of chocolate, vanilla, figs and dates, hints of Christmas spices. Full and rich mouthfeel. The flavour has loads of malty sweetness, a moderate roastiness, oaky and vinous notes (sherry and/or port), some chocolate and a hint of liquorice. Moderate hops in the finish. Terrific beer! Original rating: Bottle, at RBESG 2007 in Glasgow, Grand Tasting. ABV was 10%. Pitch black colour, brown head. Lovely vinous, oaky and roasty aroma, some sandalwood too. Perfect! Vinous, roasty and oaky flavour - a wonderful beer!"
"The aroma is toasted and slightly sour with fruit, licorice, and oak. The appearance is black with almost no head. The flavor is like the aroma with a burnt finish. The palate is watery. Overall this is not very good. It's certainly not like most barley wines."
"Orkney Dark Island Reserve is certainly sticks around in my mind long after I've had it... while I wouldn't go out of my way to get this one, if you see it at your local bottle shop and are in the mood for something subtle and memorable, consider picking it up. At the very least, the bottle will look great on your mantelpiece. Reservedly recommended."
"Notes: I got this as a Christmas gift, 2007 (no way I would've spent the approximately $25.00 on myself). Consumed in October of 2008."
"D - I had this on a foggy, cool beach night and it was perfect. On a hot mid-day, I may not have even enjoyed (or at least not appreciated) such a beer."
"Bought in a ""touristy"" shop in Scotland and price tag £9.35 = about $18. So it aint cheap here either. I had not seen this before though probably not looking. Certainly at the top end of the market. This was a treat from my brother, cheers bro! Very much for a special occasion and to be treated like malt whisky, enjoy one at length for this luxury. Try it at least once but you will definitely come back. Funny to have the Grolsch top on such a beer. Unlike a malt I finished the bottle in one go."
"Drinkability: A fine, reasonably complex beer packaged in a classy-looking bottle."
"A great, great beer-complex and very unigue. I dont know how much I could do in a sitting but this is a really great sipper and goes down like velvet. Pricey yes. I will get one to cellar but have been dying to pop this one since I bought it several months ago."
"Pours pitch black with 1/2"" tan bubbly head that leaves a little lace. Smells of sweet roasted malt with a warm scotch overtone - peat and smoke. Taste - YUM! Starts off tasting like a nice mellow scotch with roasted malt, chocolate and a hint of cherry thrown in. It has an aftertaste that is a little sweet but nicely balanced with a little heat, and the peat and smoke shining through. I was immediately impressed by the complexity of flavor, excellent balance, and completely unique flavor. I have never had a beer that tastes like this. Very full bodied, this beer is tipping the Scottish Ale scale toward stout. It has a creamy texture and a slightly alcoholic finish. This is a tough one to classify for drinkability. It is not that it isn't driinkable. On the contrary, I thoroughly enjoyed every sip. It is a slow sipper that is completely unique. On the other hand, it is pretty expensive and very rare, so I will probably never get to taste it again... Buy it if you can find it. Split is with a couple of friends, and expect a very unique experience."
"A somewhat murky brown color with a thin off-white to tan head. The aroma was port, figs, peat, and maple. I tasted big boozy flavors of port, dark fruit preserves, figs and cocoa. Full body for sure. It had a warming, oaky finish with nicely integrated alcohol presence. A fire-side sipper for sure. No doubt. Quite expensive, and yet not really, considering the price of pedigree wines and Sam Adams Utopias. If I had to live in an old Scottish castle (or Welsh for that matter) I'd have to make a fire, wrap myself in a thick carpet and have a bottle of this stuff on hand. If you see it, don't be a fool - buy it."
"An interesting beer and one assumes the lofty price tag is due to the extended aging in scotch whiskey barrels. However, at the price they're charging for it, the beer almost might as well be singe malt. Frankly, I found the beer to be a bit too much of a good thing, though perhaps age will mellow this beer somewhat. However, I just did not find the beer to be so exceptional that I'm likely to plunk down another $25 (including tax) for it any time soon."
