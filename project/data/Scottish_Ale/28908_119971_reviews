"Squatters guys, Don't misunderstand, I love  your beers despite our screwed up Utah laws and this is far from a drain pour."

"Deep brown in color. Turns to an orange hue when held to light;  1 finger cream head that left some lacing behind, but not too much. Smelled woody and earthy, along with some caramel malt; tasted like bbq'd wood, toasted bread, smoked malt, smoked cedar, with a slightly sweet and dry and caramelized smoky wood aftertaste. I also picked up a little earthy spice as well. On the light bodied side for a 5.6% abv. Overall, a good beer!"

"Mellow and malty with a nice edge of dark roasted grain and a touch of woody astringency. I think it's a very drinkable a tasty Scotch-inspired brew. From the Utah State Liquor Store in Sugar House."

"Spicy nose with fruit and peat smoke. Pours brilliant chestnut under a 1‚Äù lightly tan tinted foam cap that dissipates to a thick film. Big malt flavors sweetened by caramel finishing with spicy malt flavors, a touch of butterscotch, light toast and a balancing hop bitterness."

"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, with a nice one-finger creamy off-white head, leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, with some nuttyness. The taste is malty, and nutty. Medium body. Overall a pretty tasty brew."

"beautiful new packaging on the squatters stuff, totally expert rebranding. i like this beer less than the bumper crop with similar label, but i like it well enough. good as a scottish, but minimally smokey and not as rich in feel and flavor as some of the better examples of the style. lots of malt on this one, obviously, rich molasses color, nice and heady, tan and lasting pretty well. it smells like candied dark fruit and raisins, as well as a hint of maple to the grain. no hops at all, but they dont really belong in the style anyhow. i wish for more body personally, its a little too light (and super low abv) for the style, but i like the flavors a ton, and the carbonation is right where it needs to be. not as complex as others either, maybe a good scottish style for someone who doesnt really know what to expect from the style. easy drinking beer like this is great though, making huge styles into session beers is rad. not amazing by any stretch, but i would absolutely buy this from time to time."
"Overall not the best Scottish Ale ever but a very respectable one. I will not be turning one of these down at a BBQ."
