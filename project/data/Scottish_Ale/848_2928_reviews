"Laughing Lab is a classic example of a Scottish-inspired, American-brewed crafted ale done well. But it needs more boldness in character, depth, and dryness to compete with the best that Scotland has to offer. But any fan of Porter or Brown Ales won't have any qualms about this beer in their glass."

"O-This brew is a touch underwhelming. I prefer a bit more chutzpah in beers of this type, whether that means more spice, toffee/chocolate, or caramel...whatever. On the plus side, this beer does provide a nice, long finish, without cloying sweetness. In sum, this is a fair representation of a Scottish Ale that should appeal to those looking for something with a lighter, easy-to-drink flavor profile and feel."

"Nice Scottish Ale. Easy drinking. Sweet and malty, but finishes light enough to enjoy quite a few."

"Laughing Lab Scoth Ale poured a nice deep amber color with a fan head. The head in the std pint was two fingers and kept a consistent one finger with nice lacing for the duration. The smell was malty with hints of caramel and mocha. The taste was true to style with a sweet malt front, and finishing with a toasted note and just enough hop for balance. The beer had nice body and finished clean. Overall this is a solid Scotch Ale and worth the effort to look for. Cheers!"

"Hazy brown-red. Pours a decent enough head that quickly fades. Very little lace. It takes a bit of swirling to coax a malty aroma from this brew, where there appears to be a bit of caramel sweetness. Very dry compared to the majority of Scottish Ales I've had. Not much going on flavor wise, but this is possibly due to age (purchased 6 months ago, stored refrigerated). Mouthfeel is where this beer shines. Rich, soft, creamy, consistent flavor from start to finish. A mild hint of earthy bitterness at the end."

"This beer is crisp and light body beer. Goes down easy and with little stress to the system. Perfect for anytime of year, activity or food."
"I purchased this at a local beer/wine store in a mixed 12 pack. The label indicates it was bottled in late October (and it is now December 19th). It poured a dark brown, clear with very small head to it. Excellent carbonation with a nice mouthfeel to it. I find it on the thin side in taste, as I was hoping for a more robust beer. However, It definitely has roasty malt overtones. Its good if you just want to sit back and watch some TV, but I am not a huge fan."
""

"Pours a clear, brown color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of caramel malt, slight earthy malt, hint of nut, slight chocolate, and a hint of grain. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of caramel malt, sweet malt, hint of earthy malt, hint of chocolate, and a hint of grain. Overall, poor appearance, but good aroma, body, and blend."

"atmosphere is good. nice head and lacing. nose is sweet and grain components. flavor is grain and sweet but has a synthetic feel. overall this is a pretty decent quaff."
""

"Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Not nearly as boozy as I am used to for the style, but that's not really a bad thing as it does make it more drinkable. I wouldn't have more than one, but I can see the appeal of this one. Try it once and see what you think."
"O - Consistently good local brew. Always a pleasant treat, as I tend to pass it up because it is always around."
"not a scotch ale as i am used to having them, but distinct in its own way. pours a lighter shade of brown, with a fair head. nose is sweet roasted malts, and a hit of smoke? burnt sugars in the taste, this is a very very sweet beer. doesnt quite stack up to the best scotch ales ive enjoyed, but a decent brew nonetheless. has a nice warming effect and goes will with just about anything in the fridge. above average"
"D - A very fine example of the style. Nice, malty and simple, this one I'd have again."
"Overall: I thought this was a decent beer, but so far nothing in this style has truly inspired me."
"On tap at Springs Orleans in Colorado Springs. Ah, a nice Scottish ale. It's a little peaty and a touch smoky, with a clean caramel and toast malt character. It's simple and tasty. I like it. The body is lighter and balanced. As in, it's easy to drink. I'll have another."
"Poured a clear reddish-brown, not too dark, with little to no head to be spoken of. Aroma was of sweet malts, caramel apples, and other light fruits. Taste of caramel malts, Mary Janes, and some indistinct fruit. Not bad, but a little weak overall, in flavor, body, and in alcohol. A 5.3%ABV is quite low for a Scottish ale, though I suppose that adds to its drinkability, yet I really didn't have a desire to have any more after one session."
"The abv felt higher that what's listed here, but then I'm not used to the elevation either, if it matters much. I was very impressed with this beer. Why in the hell didn't I buy some to bring back home with me?!"
"The beer that this brewpub is known for. It's a pretty deep red that's clear with little foam. The aroma is thin with a hint of malt and grain. The taste was good, nice malts with caramel and pine. It's fairly smooth but the body seems a bit light for a scotish."
"Compared to all of the other local brewing companies, such as Trinity and Phantom Canyon, I think this scottish ale really stands out. The head, once the beer is poured, is manageable. I'll definitely continue to drink this in the future."
"Props to Bristol's on this brew, there's nothing intense about it but it's well made and constructed with a good knowledge of the style. A bit less carbonation or increased sweetness could've done this some good, appreciable grain and malt feel."
"O: Easily one of the best beers I've had, and the best Scottish ale I've gotten to try. It is a very balanced brew that leans toward the malty side of things, but doesn't go overboard. The hops are minimal but detectable, which is appropriate for the style. If you're a fan of Scottish Ales this one is more than worth a try, and if you're not a fan of Scottish ales this one might change your mind. An awesome brew. 4.9/5"
"A nicely balanced copper/brown beer with a medium white head, nice retention, and ok lace. The smell is of sweet malts, toasted grains, caramels, toffee, and earthy, grassy elements. Nutty flavors with a hint of roasted qualities. Nice toasted malts, caramels and sweet toffee with some earthy, grassy hops balanced in well. A nicely balanced, medium bodied, very drinkable beer. Very well done."
"Had this one on tap yesterday at the Bristol Brewing Company in Colorado Springs. A favorite of both my wife and her friend yesterday, I found it to be not so bad myself. Poured a reddish brown color, with an ecru head on top. Aromas of bread dough, sweet malt and earthy hops. On the palate sweet malt, caramel and a very slight smokiness."
"D: Nothing about it really blows me away, but the decent taste and good moderate body make it quite drinkable. This is definitely a beer I can return to."
"Drinkability: Very clean finish leaves just enough flavor on the tongue to make you want to refresh the tastebuds of the flavor and have another sip."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. It doesn't have such a strong flavor that you need to recharge afterwards, and it tastes very smooth. Despite not kicking your taste buds, it certainly has a nice flavor to it. A good poster boy for the brand."
"(I should have brought back more than a six pack.)"
"D: Very nicely done. Super drinkable. Flavorful and sessionable. It is nice to see a flagship brew in this style (especially at this gravity level/strength). Some how in this style, like too many others, competition takes a hold. People expect Ur /- beers Jeez people - there is a range to the style. I have, um, found some of those... ahem, unclean bastards to be right nice - but not every Scottish beer needs to make kilts fall off."
"D: Smooth, I could drink this all day."
"Drinkability: Has a great flavor and isn't too big, very drinkable."
"Pretty good. There is plenty of diacteyl here. Scottish Ales often have diacetyl, but there are usually other characteristics that help balance that. This is not over done, but a little more than I would like. Still, a beer that I enjoyed. Worth a try."
"Has a bit of a buttery diacetyl flavor emboldening the sweet caramel and slight peat flavors. Pseudo-scottish/amber ale? Hints of sour malt and thin for the style. Flagship brew, hmmm...there are a few other Bristol brews I like better. It is a fairly pleasant, easy drinker, but falls short as a Scottish style ale. Drinkable? Yes. Introductory? Maybe. Certainly is better on tap as a local option."
"Not bad."
"The beer pours a murky orangish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is very malt with bready and toffee notes, but I really expected some sort of peat smoke aroma. The flavor is peat smoke as well as toffee and caramel malts. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
" Even though the alcohol content isn't that high, I wouldn't consider this to be a session beer. One for a sitting after dinner is good, just like I would have with a nice single malt Scotch and a snifter to bring the aroma out. There isn't as much of a ""nose"" on this beer, but it's still worth finding and enjoying before a night is called. I wouldn't mind having another one once the weather cools off a bit more!"
"Pouring a deep dark amber, vigorously for some head which soon dissipated to leave me with an unremarkable, albeit quite drinkable ale with hints of chocolate and coffee. Comfortable, refreshing, a light feeling for a darker ale. Not something that I would seek out specifically, though happy to drink it!"
"Nice chestnut brown color with a head that disappeared very quickly. It has a malty smell that seems pretty nondescript. The flavor seems right in line for the style but subtle. Malty, a little bit of smokiness but not overpowering like some Scottish ales I've had. Very easy to drink and I could probably have had more than one of these in a session."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a thin crÃ¨me head. Nose is leafy with a fruit tone. Flavor brings a hearty fruit tone. Seems slight apples. Smooth. More sweet than earthy. Feel is low on carbonation and liquid is fairly smooth. Easy to drink. Medium level of complexity. Pretty nice."
"Every bit as good as 90 Shilling. Don't overlook this hidden gem. Luckily there's a lot of support for this beer in the Co. Springs area. It's a much better go-to beer than Fat Tire or Avalanche in my opinion."
"Notes from: 12/31/05"
"Copper in color with a slight beige head. Sweet and malty in smell. Slight fruity smell. Sweet in taste. I get notes of apple, oatmeal, and brown sugar. Kinda rich in taste also leaves a little on the tongue. A drinkable beer that is a mild Scotch Ale. I do like this beer, but mainly, because I like the style. Very sweet."
"D: Not much here at all, not as malty as I thought it might be. It comes off thin and carbonated and no particular flavor shines though. I hope I got a bad bottle. It isn't horrible, but not pounding back many of these."
"Drinkability is fairly high, in view of the low ABV, but this beer seems not to style."
"D: Very flavorful and not too filling. Definitely a beer that grew on me. ABV and body will bring me back to this one."
"D: I didn't like this much right out of the gate. But it grew on me the more I drank it. The low ABV and mild body make this a nice session beer."
"Love the lable and quirky name."
"Easy drinking, much better on draft, but a nice session beer in the bottle"
"D - Not bad. Looks and smells great, and the flavor is average. The mouthfeel is a bit anemic IMHO, and this doesn't really stand out in the crowd."
"Opinion: This is a decent beer. It is not flawed in any way, but it is just really mild on the palate. The flavors are in balance, but the overall presentation of the beer left me wanting for something. I personally just think that they are either just using the wrong yeast strain, or their mash temp is just too low. The beer has a good flavor, but it leaves me thinking that something is missing."
"This comes out of the tap a rich mahogany brown with a fine-bubbled head. Aroma is strong, spicy, malty, with a hint of hops. Flavor is rich and smooth, with hints of hops, caramel, smoke and cloves; the sweet nicely balances the hop bitterness. It goes down lively and sassy."
"My mother discovered this brew on a recent trip to Colorado Springs and had to buy it for me since she had never heard of it. I had never had a Scottish Ale before and was pleasantly surprised to see the dark color. Nothing stood out from the smell. I found this brew to beer a little harsh to drink, but was very good, having been my first voyage into the Scottish Ale style."
"Toasted grains and mild herbal bitterness/astringency up front. Nutty, caramelly, doughy malts come forward. Slightly soapy quality. Sweetish fruits and a little brown sugar mid-palate. Hint of anise and leather. Light herbal bitterness in the otherwise malty finish. Moderate body, with a pretty creamy feel. Not bad!"
"An amber color with a below average tan head. Nose has soem sweet candy, mild malts and dark fruits. The taste has a scotchy sweetness mixed in wit the fruits and candy. Well balanced by soem floral hops. A mediuym body and nice carbonation. A drinkable mild version of teh style."
"The body is mid to light. There is a sweetness that leaves an under attenuated feel in there. For me could use more body, take the roast out completely and fix some of the flaws (not paws)."
"D - Extremely drinkable and goes with pretty much any meal (even breakfast sometimes). A great representation of a Scottish ale."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and a nice representation of the style, although I am not crazy about the grainy element"
"Poured a mahogany/red color low co2 and a very low off-white head. Lacing is sticky. Aroma is of malt, molasses, caramel, and lightly earthy. Caramel flavor with malt and a very light hop finish. Palate is light bodied and effervescent with a hoppy finish. IMHO: a fair representation of the style, but fairly one-dimensional."
"I like this beer. I may be taking the cute Lab for a walk more and more often. Give it a shot."
"This maybe the only American Scottish Ale I've had, can't recall another. I love the style, this one did not dissapoint. Very nice....cheers!"
"D - I'm not terribly impressed, tho I recognize this beer has won several awards and medals. Maybe I would have had better luck if it had never been in the fridge."
"A fresh example of this could easily be a decent session beer, but we're lightyears from freshness with this bottle. If I happen to find myself in Colorado Springs, I'll give it a try on-tap, otherwise I won't be needing to try this again."
"Drinkability - very good to drink"
"Drinkability: Good flavor, but a little watery. I expect more bold, rich flavors from a Scottish ale. Overall, not bad, but not great."
"Picked a bottle of this up while traveling in the Denver area for the GABF in late 2006. The beer poured a clear amber color with a slight tan head that lingered a bit but gave way to a slight ring on the end of the glass. The aroma was of sweet malt and a touch of creaminess. The taste was mainly malty, creamy and sweet but with a touch of hop bitterness to round things out and make for a solid and easy drinking ale."
"Drinkability - Very easy drinker, great for sesions, or any other occasion."
"Dark copper color with a little bit of off white head. No lacing to speak of. Smell is very malty, mostly chocolate and caramel. Also a little smokiness. Sweet malty flavor with some smoky peat mixed in. Just a enough hop bitterness to provide a little balance. Creamy mouthfeel, but not too heavy. All in all a pretty nice beer, this would be a great session beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a creamy 3/4"" light tan head above the clear coppery brown brew. Head fades slowly, popped bubble by popped bubble, with lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is minimal, little to anything good or bad here. Taste is lightly peaty malts with a light hoppy close that lingers. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both likable. Not a bad brew here."
"Very mellow beer. Makes me think more of a brown ale in flavor. Slightly burnt malts. Burnt biscuits. Bit of peat too. Molasses and brown sugar. Medium body. Seems to tingle on the palate--kind of odd. Slightly dry."
"12 ounce bottle. Laughing Lab Scottish Ale pours out a dark brown color with a huge, off-white head. Sweet aroma with some fruit, but there is a definite cardboard aroma that isn't pleasant. The flavor is sweet, with the caramelized sugar flavor typical of the style. Just a bit fruity. Finishes with a cocoa flavor and a touch of hops. Good balance. This beer is almost very good. It has a nice flavor, but it doesn't taste as fresh as it should, and I don't think my bottle is particulary old. I would love to try a fresh bottle to see."
"Body is light, way too light, with big bubbles of carbonation that lend a very flat, watery mouthfeel and slick, wet texture. Another pass."
"This is quite par for the course of a microbrew Scotch Ale. Really quite average and it reminds me of the stock attempt at a Scotch Ale of any McBrewpub."
"This is easy to guzzle down (or slowly nip) but rather uninteresting. I was disappointed."
"Had on tap at the Bristol taproom during a summer vacation through Colorado. Poured a dark amber color with slight head that dissipated very quickly. Smell is somewhat lacking as I don't really smell much of anything, maybe a very slight sweetness. Taste is sweet at first with an earthy/mossy aftertaste. The smell of this beer becomes more apparent the more you drink of it for some reason. Still a sweet/malty smell. Mouthfeel is good although there is very little carbonation this beer goes down good. Overall not a bad scottish style but I've had tastier ones than this."
"Typically, I look for something in a beer that stands out as a remarkable feature, something that makes me want to try that beer again. This brew is an exception. The drinkability is enhanced by the fact that nothing really stands out. It's extremely well balanced, at least to my palate. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Overall, I didn't care for it much. A little too sweet and the off flavors and mouthfeel turned me off."
"Dark amber/red. A wisp of a head. Tiny bubbles ceate a wave appearance on the top. Sweet candy nose. Medium mouthfeel. Some bready malts, but very limited compexity. Just a hint of alcohol. I'm a bit disappointed in the lack of flavor develpment. No apparent flaws, just fails to develop well. Markedly sweet finish is to style."
"Tastes of baking powder bisuits with a dash of cocoa, and a smack on the tongue with a cedar plank. I'm thinking of the last sensation of a salmon filet when it's stuffed into a smokehouse, right before it's smoked beyond recovery. This would be good by the pitcher with smoked salmon, dill mayo, pickled things and rye bread and lightly sweetened whole wheat crackers. It's got a nutty aftertaste."
"Appearance is a mahogany/red color low co2 and a very low off-white head. Lacing is sticky. Aroma is of malt, molasses, caramel, and lightly earthy. Caramel flavor with malt and a very light hop finish. Palate is light bodied and effervescent with a hoppy finish. IMHO: a fair representation of the style, but fairly one-dimensional."
"Thanks to tavernjef for sharing this after bringing it back from the SouthWest."
"This is a very nice scottish ale although I sense it teeters close to the Brown Ale style. Still, I would recommend it."
"Dark rust, somewhat clouded, barely a head appeared but what did, stayed on top awhile, very minimal spotty lace. Aroma is faint of burntish toffee, a bit buttery with some slight earthyness of peat moss or wet wood. Taste is bit bland with some slight roasty factions in the start which linger throughout. Some slight hops of herbalness and pale leafyness makes its way towards the finish. Feel is a bit empty in the middle, start is mildly roasted and ends a bit dry and buttery with slight nut shades. Overall feel in body is thin, but some of the flavors keep it going somewhat to make it worth drinking, but its pretty average for a Scottish Ale."
"Pours a nice-looking deep reddish brown with a small, creamy head. Very nice aroma of roasted malt, toffee, oak, and a light whiff of smoke. Slightly sweet and sticky up front, with notes of toffee and treacle, balanced by a robust malt profile. Finishes with a sweet, oaky flavor that lingers in the back of the mouth. A little sweeter than I tend to prefer in a scottish ale, without the hops. Nevertheless, a decent offering."
"This is quite drinkable and generally amiable. A fresh sample might even be killer."
"The name got me expecting the big malt fatty. Close. Burnt amber under thin fingers of lace. Wonderful nose of Autumn and the fallen leaves of Sugar Maples strewn about the forest floor. Smooth and malt and balance and smooth. This is a perfect Wintertime ale suitable for fireside contemplation or joyous snowball affairs in the front yard."
"A very drinkable brew. Someone else said it has chocolate somewhere in its makeup. Not really. But still a nice drink on a hot day."
"(old) - need to taste a fresh version again but I remember this being quite a good brew when fresh."
"Thanks to Arctic Liquors for the sample."
