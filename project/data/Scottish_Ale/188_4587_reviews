"A rather unimpressive beer that lacks any real taste at all. Simply one of the cheapest beers available on-tap in Scotland. It lacks any flavour notes or character. Fine as a beer when you have already had a few, but not something you want to start your night out on."
"Bought on the train from Aberdeen to Inverness. At best, a party beer: mass produced with all the industrial smells from the popped can opening, soda-like carbonation popping out the top like a coke. In a plastic cup, the yellow liquid is limp and sad as the carbonation fizzes out, leaving little head--or flavor--behind. I'm happy the company was good: oil riggers back on dry land after two weeks in the North Sea. Order something else if you can."
"I enjoyed this. There is nothing sepcial here, just easy to drink with a little more going on than normal macros (UK or American). Most places I have been to in Scotland carry this, and is a good standby if no quality cask is available."
"Avoid like the plague."
"M/D- This was brought to me from Scotland and I was told it is very popular. I would have preferred a bottle but oh well. This is definitely a session brew that has a smooth mouthfeel."
"The malts jump my taste buds, caramel, brown sugar, bread and faint fruitiness. A great malty (most are) Scottish beer."
"Despite its low alcohol content I'm not sure how much I could drink. Probably because of the sweetness and the fact that it doesn't taste great. I mean, its not terrible - about on par with the majority of english ales I've had. But decent at best."
"Flavour is, again, a little corny and adjuncty. Mildly refreshing and not as sweet as some others in this style, although it gets sweeter as it warms up. Light mouthfeel, but not too bad. I think this beer would be significantly better on tap or especially on cask."
"Quite a pleasant experience."
"Pours a dark copper, with a half inch off-white head, good lacing. The beer has a really inviting hops aroma coupled with nutty/caramel malts. I really enjoyed the taste, it had elements of burnt toffee, caramel,a toasted wheat flavour, slight nuttyness and just a little hops. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel was quite good as well. The beer is light/medium bodied, and ends somewhat dry. Overall, i really enjoy this ale and would drink it anytime, either as a session or just to enjoy one."
"A great all round beer, readily available in Scotland, except Edinburgh (don't know why)."
"Beer was a dark copper with a white bubbly-fluffy head that was good initially. Nose was a hint of the malts and not much else. Has my nose gone bad in the UK? I am not sure why this is called a scottish ale as this was very hoppy. There was a light to medium mouthfeel but lively on the palate. At 4.5 abv this was a very sessionable beer."
"There is a slightly smoky, roasted somewhat creamy caramel malt flavour here which coupled with refreshing carbonation makes more impact than one expects from the wrong section of the supermarket aisle. There seem to be just enough hops here to give it some bite. If I have to buy a can for less than a quid this will probably be the one."
"Pours thick with a medium head. Good hops and malt in the smell. Very good physical appearance. Taste is stronger than a lot of IPA's, this being more full bodied and darker. Slight peet character? Overall, this is great India Pale Ale. This is on par with mcewan's Scotch Ale. I will drink this again, cost permitting."
"A terrific starter beer for th evening. Looks richly copper and moderately carbonated. Just off from white head with good retention and lacing. Smells sweet with malt, caramel, and slight bitter and sour. Tastes of caramel and malt sweetness. Underlined toffee, toastedness, butter pop corn, and mild fruitiness. Fruits of plumbs and peaches, although mild. Also a bit nutty. An also buttery coat to the mouth with a medium body. Thins through the finish, revealing more nutty and hop flavor."
"A most drinkable session ale, fresh from the tap..I think this beer is underrated."
"yeah, im not so great at picking out the subtleties of malt heavy beers. so sue me."
"A decent ale, perhaps a bit unbalanced however, too fizzy aswell"
"This ale is all about toffee. I like my Scots less sweet, a little more herby/peaty and even-tempered. That said, this is a delightful ale. Smells like pungent toffee - as if toffee could spoil. Tastes sweet and toffee-ish which gives way to a modest sour, bitter carbonation finish, redeeming the ale which *would* otherwise strikes a cloying, syrupy mouthfeel. Note the conditional. At any rate, the beer ranks somewhere this side of the line toward ""very good."""
"The ale to serve when your friends claim that beer ain't food."
"This is nothing more than out-of-date IPA. It's the same colour with the same aromas and tastes as their IPA, just a bit more ""stale"". The mouthfeel is also that of ""wet cardboard"" and the drinkability suffers a great deal as well. Not that this stuff is horrible, but, the regular IPA is much, much better!"
"In my database it is a 9.3 out of 10 and in my top ten out of a little over 500 beers. It's also a decent value compared to most of the other Scottish Ales."
"Notes: Wasn't expecting much ... didn't get much. Subpar taste dragged down this brew's drinkability."
"My first introduction to Scottish style ales, and got me hooked. Definitely smoother with a little more kick than what passes for beer from American mainstream breweries. I still like it, even though I have expanded my exposure to Scotch ales. A little thin on pouring and when it first hit the mouth, but makes it extremely drinkable on all kinds of weather. If you want to introduce a friend to this particular style, this is the one you want."
"Not much else to say althouhg it was very drinakble and was priced wher eit should be in quality."
