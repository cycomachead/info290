3.79,-0.5,2.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.75,"Overall â€“ The mouthfeel of this brew in conjunction with its moderately sweet, but rather malty flavor really make this brew a nice drinker. A very interesting scotch ale that tastes much bigger then it should (at least in terms of its abv.). A rather nice brew overall.","Darkmagus82","Mar 18, 2014"

3.76,-1.3,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"This was given to me from the can so I can't describe the appearance, however the aromas and flavors were typical of a scottish ale. Sweet malts, toffee, nuts. Its a little lighter than say Dirty Bastard or Old Chub, but the flavors come together nicely and id consider this a good, sessionable/drinkable scottish ale. Better than the Babbling Blonde I had previously.","Bone53","Beers"
3.93,3.1,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"Equally tasty but a little on the flat side. Malty sweetness with a good bit of toffee and dark fruits. Perhaps a tad too sweet, for me anyway.","micromaniac129","0"
3.78,-0.8,3.25,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall: I thought this was a solid beer. Price is good and the beer is tasty. I think most anyone would could like this. Especially non-beer lovers. At 5.1% ABV I would say pretty sessionable. I would have no problem drinking this again.","austina3214","Feb 27, 2014"

3.24,-15,4,3,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Overall - Pretty simple, basic and easy drinking. About the mildest, lightest scotch ales out there. Nothing special, would be a nice starter beer for scotch ales.","wvsabbath","Apr 30, 2013"
3.73,-2.1,3,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,"OVERALL: I drank a six pack of this like nobody's business. Lighter bodied for a scotch ale, but with good malt flavor. To revert to the traditional, antique ""schilling"" scale, consider this a 60- schilling, which would indicate a Scottish ale of lighter body and strength.","Stinkypuss","Feb 27, 2013"

This beer poured a dark amber without much head or lace. The smell and taste was bolster by a malt with slight roast goddness. The body was light and had smooth carboantion. Overall its a decent lighter dark beer,,,,call it mild dark>","WoodBrew","0"
