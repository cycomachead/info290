"A refreshing traditional treat."

"This has some potential, but it seems to thin out not long after the initial hit. If it were a little more firm, I think it'd be better. Feel is decent. Overall this is okay. I'd like more of a punch though."
"I have had this beer many times and was never disappointed, and it is just a nice pub beer that would fit on any decent menu. It would be great if I could get it on tap somewhere, but the bottle is fine."
"Quite a nice sweet and milk chocolatey flavour that seemed more like a light milk stout than a Scottish ale but an enjoyable offering regardless and one that I'd have again."
""
"Overall: I was expecting something different here, as the word ""Heavy"" is displayed prominently on the label; this bottle was a couple of months past its prime but I don't think that made too much of a difference"
"Flavor has some light sweetness, with more caramel and toffee present. Nothing in the way of peaty or smoky character at all, though. In fact, the maltiness falls far short of what I expect in a scotch ale. Has some subtle intimations of fruitiness with a touch of hopping in the dry finish. Overall, a rather bland representation of the style. Should be called a ""Scottish Light - 20 Shiling Beer"". Prosit!"
"1480"
"Certainly Scottish but not very wee heavy, this is about as thoroughly average a beer in this style as I've had. Color, aroma, taste, feel... all average. Nice, but average. Can you say ""Mr. Five?"" Worth a try on a chilly night in New England, but not something to save for a special occasion. Enjoy *one.*"

"I liked this more in the beginning of the pint. Lacks depth and intensity. Drinkable and not filling, but it is a trade off. Just OK."
""
"this is a good beer, a little thin, but good."
"Pours a dark copper hue which leaves a creamy two finger head that quickly dissapates and leaves sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is very subtle with aromas of light burnt toffee,caramel and candied figs,the mouthfeel is just over lightbodied and only average but the tastes are abit better with hints of burnt toffee,candied figs,wheatgrass,fruity malts and finished with a subtle bitterness and overall its above average and easy to knock back but wouldnt buy it again cheers."

"O: This is a decent enough Scottish ale, and would serve as a fitting introduction to the style. In the end, it doesn't bring anything new to the table and will need a bit of refinement if it is ever to stand out from the crowd. Don't pass this one up, yet don't go out of your way to find it either."
"sweet and caramelly, but hardly mouthy or big. a touch of hop flavor just because. ""heavy"" it is not, and probably not 80/-, either. right? but it is quaffable (and i'm not reviewing the label)"
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a thick fluffy head. Much like the ingredient list on the back, there are scent of malted barley, malted wheat, hops, and yeast which gives it an almost caramel scent. Starts out making you think this will be a heavy tasting beer with its malted ingredients like a stout but instead it finishes rather light. Drinks rather smooth as the malted ingredients really hit the taste buds. Finishes rather clean smooth. A decent beer with a rather interesting drinking experience."
"Another Williams Brothers beer which is very likeable and with more potential than the score might indicate. But because it comes across as a sort of out of style beer, with as many red ale qualities and that of an 80, I find it hard to give it a higher recommendation."
"O - This is a great session beer, but I think I'd prefer something with a little more hops."
"Overall: Flavorful. Far from overdone. Highly drinkable. A great session ale."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable. I would have no problem drinking more than one of these in a sitting because itâ€™s not very filling."
"This one pours an attractive deep brown with a fairly substantial off-white head. The aroma has a lot of sweet caramel with a bit of earthy, peaty malts. Coffee and brown sugar finish off the nose. The taste is a bit watery at first, but pulls through at the finish with nice caramel malts with just a touch of peat, some coffee and chocolate, and a bit of earthy hops and fruits. The mouthfeel is nice, it's coating at first and then finishes drying. The drinkability is very good. Overall, an enjoyable beer that's very drinkable."
"Ehh, nothing special, lacking in any sort of depth of flavor and complexity..."
"This is a lighter ""Heavy"" that is for sure,is this the traditional way of the style?Poured into an imperial nonic a rich mahogany with beige colored 1/2 finger head that faded quickly,the rich color got the high mark.Caramel toffee aromas along with some brown sugar and a slight metallic note.Lighter feel for such a rich looking beer,I know the abv. is low but I was expecting a little more richness and fullness.Very malt accented to be expected,caramel and firm toffee to go along with lightly sweet biscuit malt element.Its not overly sweet and its not smokey like most American versions of the style,but its not nearly as rich and/or complex either."
"If this is their heavy, I'm really curious to see what their 60/- offers. It's a real sessionable ale no doubt, but I need a wee more flavour. Perhaps toning down the bubbles and/or roasted barley will do it? Attractive bottle, by the way."
"I love a good Scottish ale. It's just too bad that this isn't one. It's a beautiful beer, no doubt...deep brown with rich reddish hues and a soapy off-white head. The aroma is lacking...very mild, a touch of malt, and that's about it. The taste is light, drier than expected, and disappointing. There is a little toast-crust flavor, but it's not the rich scotch ale that it could be. A little too much carbonation. Very weak in body. This one is forgettable."
"Pours a wonderful deep copper/burgandy color with excellent head and lacing. Very nice malty scent, hints of peat in the nose. Great flavor! A wonderfully deep and satisfying, thick maltiness with nice caramel and toffee tones and just the slightest hint of peat in the background. Goes down wonderfully well! This has a lot of flavor for a low abv brew. Wonderful stuff!"
"Not many Eighty Shilling Ales make it to the US ... we have a dark session ale among us. This beer is brownish garnet and crystal clear, with decent lacing that lasts for the duration. Burnt malt aroma of lightly roasted coffee and brown sugar are in the nose. This brew has a lush smoothness with some body. A faintness of toffee with a drawn out, dried- hay graininess and faint dried-plum fruitiness are all present throughout this beer. More watery char flavor shows up in the finish. This is an OK beer that lacks depth. The watery burnt flavor takes away from the drinkability a bit."
"Very easy to drink and seems to be a lot stronger than the 4.2% ABV it claims because of its depth of body. An ideal cold weather beer."
"Simply superb microbrewed Scottish ale. Also one of the most flavorful beers I've been able to find in the States in the 4% ABV range."
"Taste is lightly sweet-sour fruit strong up front then joined by toasty caramelised bread crust, dry leafy-woody & tea-like hop with hint of pepper. Startig lightly sweet-sour, it becomes balanced and drier. It has some subtle complexity at firts, but this fades and it soon becomes flatter and less multifacted in character, mostly dryish darkly toasty with light caramel, faint hint of winey sweet-sour fruit and faint hint of woody-tea hops. Drinkability is always high."
"Pours a clear, dark rust color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, slight dark citrus, hint of roasted malt, and hint of spice. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight yeast, coffee, hops, and slight grain. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Scottish Ale."
"Notes: True to style but lacking a touch to make it memorable in this incarnation."
"From the 500 ml. bottle with an expiration date of July 2011. Sampled on July 17, 2010. The pour is copper-amber with a little red hue held to the light and great clarity. There is lingering lacing on the glass. Malts are the main aroma. Malts and sweetness. The mouthfeel comes in at about medium with a sweet and dry malty taste. It is actually very easy to drink."
"Pours a clear chestnut brown color with a tight khaki colored head, settles into stellar cap. The aroma is of brown bread, light grain, some brown sugar, honey, and some peat. The aromas are not over the top but are very solid. The taste is of a woodsy chestnut brown malt, a touch grainy, some mineral or metallic flavor, and a tea like dry and lemony flavor. There is some light milk chocolate notes as well. I must say for a 4.2ABV brew this has some great flavors. The Scot has a moderate to heavy feel with soft and airy carbonation; starts sweet and finishes a bit astringent. This is an excellent beer considering the ABV, heck it is a good beer not factoring in the ABV. Where can I get a case of this stuff, I can drink it all day during football season."
"500 ml bottle, best before July 2011, label says ""Scottish Heavy/Eighty Shilling Beer"". Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is toffee, toasted malt, and some butterscotch. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some nuts and dark fruit noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. And with just a 4.2% ABV, it would be a decent choice as a session beer. It certainly wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these at a time. Not a bad overall brew."
"The mouthfeel was about right for a beer of this style, decent and above medium in the mouth. At 4.2% it is a good all night beer, but the lack of significant flavours would make me look at another 80/~. William Bros normally produce very good beers, but this is a bit disappointing."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable because of the abv, but I did not feel as though the flavors were as strong here as I have had in other examples of this style. An average beer that I will have again, but nothing to rush for."
"A good drinker, if not all that outstanding."
"Very nicely done for the style. Sessionable."
"Very nice beer, easy to drink, interesting and amusing."
"Drinkability: Awesome beer, well balanced moreish flavours with a silky feel. Definitely the best in the Williams stable, and one of the best, if not the best, Scottish Ale I have had the pleasure to try."
"D: would definitely drink again!"
"Teak brown, solid and thick with fiery highlights ranging from blood orange to Meyer lemon, capped with a smooth, cappuccino-beige head. Delightful, beguiling nose floats spicy pine, grass, and citrus notes atop a well of chocolate, Earl Grey tea, caramel, and sweet grape- and strawberry-like fruitiness. There are earthier tinges of resin and roasted peanuts as well. Robust but quick flavor, surging with a rush of coffee, cocoa, nuts, and orange oil before closing with a bittersweet finish that leaves just a shadow of acrid roasted char. Sprightly carbonation works perfectly with a thick, malt-forward mouthfeel to achieve an overall balanced and dry impression. Complex, robust, and at only 4.2%, a wonderful session beer!"
"M&D: effervescent on the carbonation, medium-minus bodied, and pretty light on the palate as far as a malty ale is concerned. Not a bad beer, not even boring if one considers the flavour profile typical for a 80/-, but the quality of malts used in this brew is not impressive enough to result in a remarkably intensive malt feast in the glass like some of its counterparts have managed."
