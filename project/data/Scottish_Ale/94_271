Color was a brownish-copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich and sweet with malt - caramel, cocoa, toffee. Oh my. There are times that I question my buying habits because as a hophead, this is not in my wheelhouse. The head fell in an unusual way, collapsing down and in on itself. Mouthfeel was medium and the richness of the malt almost threw me into diabetic shock! It was tasty, though, more like toffee than caramel. Finish was sweet, but not cloying, so I did not have any problem drinking all of it. This is one that would be more suited for the Winter season, if I were to get it again.","woodychandler","Jun 24, 2014"

The nose, while muted, has a nice complexity. Toffee, biscuits, and a tobacco aroma all make themselves known. The flavor profile leads off with malts that definitely lean more towards biscuit and bread than caramel and toffee. There's a sharp bitterness next that's entirely out of place. A subtle tobacco and herbs blend delivers the finish. The mouthfeel just lacks the fullness of body that I'd expect for a malty winter beer, though the carbonation is appropriately subdued. I don't often reach for Long Trail beers when I'm browsing at my local bottle shop, and this HIbernator isn't going to change my mind.","axeman9182","Dec 16, 2012"

Aromas of rich caramel, both sweet and smooth, a touch of hops bitterness, and some floral jasmine highlights. Very smooth and balanced aromas. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a scotch and caramel backbone that is sweet, but balanced. Malt profiles expound as the beer covers the palate, giving rise to some bready and molasses characteristics. Light bodied despite the rich flavors, and when combined with the lower ABV this beer becomes very drinkable. Sweet, slightly tart aftertaste with the hops presence resurfacing for a touch of bitter and spice to clean the palate. Crisp, clean finish with a touch of spice linger. Tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Nov 21, 2012"

It's pretty neutral, so I can see IPA and Ale fans enjoying this...while those that like a darker and heavier fare try a few of those for a lighter alternative.

The taste of apple skins are noted with a mild piney flavor from the hops which are very tasty combined with the scottish yeast. Overall I really enjoyed this beer -so much flavor for a relatively low abv beer. The way it finishes is mostly dry yet clean in general without too much in the way of what counts - a nice balance of the yeast, malt and hop flavors.","Slatetank","Dec 24, 2011"

Aromas are sweet (somewhat caramelly) and grainy, a bit simplistic for a beer of this style. Flavors are consistent with the nose, but add another layer on the finish by contributing a tea-like or earthy bitterness that balances the malts. Such a well-crafted, medium-full body should be more flavorful in my opinion. This beer has a pleasantly hefty weight and feel but lacks the flavor strength to withstand a hunk of basic cheddar. If the maltiness were more assertive, I'd give this two thumbs up.","droomyster","Feb 20, 2011"

Not much happening in the nose - I get some toasted malts off the bottle pop, but the aromas really dissipate in the glass - perhaps a medium-malt backbone with some earthiness, and a bit of berry or dark stone fruit. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a light, toasted character and a citrus quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a little bit of citrus astringency and a pleasant, even carbonation.

Head is actually creepy looking as the larger bubbles pop and fade resulting in a thick head that has an uneven, crater-filled surface... intersting. Nose is slight malt with a faint amount of hops, and a bit of grain. Taste is a little more bitter forward than others for the style. Also tasting grain throughout and a lingering partially metallic aftertaste. Medium feel, low carb. Not bad overall.","stakem","Dec 21, 2009"

It's kind of weird in terms of style. The name, maybe unintentionally, suggests a doppelbock, and the sweet malt profile in the taste and smell are also similar to the style, though a little more nutty. That's where the similarities end, but it still doesn't seem like a Scottish ale, as it's classified here. Pretty darn good though and a classic winter seasonal in the northeast, so maybe the lesson to be learned is not to overthink it.","BeefyMee","Dec 20, 2009"

This is a medium bodied, traditional malty winter warmer. There isn't much carbonation, the head is a very nice off white, creamy and frothy. There are ruby notes to this beer and it is sufficiently cloudy to add some intrigue to its presentation. It retains and laces. The smell is dextrin malt maybe a hint of spice in the allspice family. The taste is a bit complex in that the malty sweetness, the spices, the butterscotch notes are most pronounced on the front end.

Smell is of dry grain, doughy bread, caramel, toast...not bad. Taste, lets see...Im getting more of the toast and grain flavors, with a mild backing of chocolate towards the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bordering on light perhaps. This is a very easy beer to drink for the cold Fall and Winter months.

There is the tiniest amount of hop bitterness at the finsih, but is almost indetectable. The malt rules here, as it should in a scotch ale. There's a slight metallic taste in the finish, but it isn't strong enough to detract from the overall experience. It has a fairly full mouthfeel, which is appropriate.

The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, hops, brown sugar, herbs, and a very slight sweet honey appeal. Not overly impressive considering the label stated that it would be. The tastes that came from the glass were of hops  floral and citrus (very slight), a carbonation bite, sweet malt, watery feel, pine trees, flowers, slight lemons, roasted nut, barley (when it warmed), bread/yeast (slight) and a slight alcohol (warmed). The aftertaste was hops and slightly dry. I tasted more hops in this beer then malt, even though the label stated that it used 5 malts in the brew process. I noticed the malts more in the nose then on the tongue. And as for the honey, I only detected a small hint in the nose and none on the pallet. Medium bodied, but I was hoping for more.
