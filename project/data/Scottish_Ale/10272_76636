3.8,1.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into snifter, best before 4/2015. Pours slightly hazy bright orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toasted bread, vanilla, oak, apple, plum, herbal, light pepper, and herbal/oaky earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toasted bread, vanilla, oak, apple, plum, herbal, light pepper, and herbal/oaky earthiness. Light herbal/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toasted bread, vanilla, apple, plum, oak, light pepper, and herbal/oaky earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good oak aged Scottish ale style. All around good complexity, balance, and solid robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. This is a bit lighter in body and flavor than the Rum barrel version, but is still nicely enjoyable.","superspak","Jan 31, 2015"

Moderate to soft carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Spiced touch, vanilla cream & anise flavors are displayed in the middle, peppery & sugary flavors as well.. Long sweetish finish is touched by subtle woody hints. Kind heat & slight fruity on the aftertaste. As it warms intense vanilla, toffee & ripe apricot are felt.","GONZALOYANNA","Jun 08, 2014"

This made this beer very appealing to me. It may not sound appealing and I would agree but it actually was a good part of this beer. taste whys I honestly cannot tell if I like this beer. It is a difficult decision. It's a bit of a heavier beer so definitely not a session beer. Again, the taste is so hard to tell, the first pat of the sip isn't the best but then it gets sweeter and turns to honey. Totally unique and different from any other beer I've had. I do like.

This canned version is only a slight improvement over the clear bottles we've been stuck with previously, due to the lack of skunking. I can understand why some people aren't so big on this beer - with all the sweet notes and relative lack of hop balance - but I still have a soft spot for this stuff, and most people I offer it to seem fairly satisfied with it.

The taste has some vanilla and mild wood notes, with an earthy hop note, pale grain sweetness and slight toffee. Feels light, maybe a hair medium bodied, clean, with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinks easy enough. Not sure if I find this to be a Scottish ale to style or Scottish ale because the brewery is Scottish. Oh well, its not half bad if you can avoid the skunking.","EgadBananas","Jul 22, 2013"

Nose has vanilla then light oak followed by light biscuity malt tones. The tasting reveals much the same as the nose, lightly sweet maltiness and vanilla notes. Light and smooth mouthfeel, an easy drinker. The finish is on the sweet side, a bit more hop would make this quite a bit more interesting but as it is, just an easy to drink ale with an emphasis on sweetness and vanilla oakiness. Ok but a one trick pony.","beerluvr","Jul 20, 2013"

Oak and toffee are immediately appearant, with vanilla and fruity esters coming next. All of this over a biscuit malt backbone. Great aroma, really quite unique. Taste follow with big oak, toffee, vanilla and fruit. With all that toffee and vanilla, it gives the impression of sweetness without actually being sweet, not much in the way of hops though, I think they would benefit from a bit more hopping for balance. Oddly enough the oak lends a bit of bitterness to the mix. Mouthfeel is smooth and foamy. Overall a good beer, aroma was the high point for me.

3.5,-6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought that it was a solid example of the style and a simple yet good oak aged beer that is very true to style. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and flavors held my attention, I could see drinking a couple of these on a cool fall night. What I liked most about this beer was it's balance and simplicity, it wasn't overdone and was exactly as advertised. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness and that it comes in a clear bottle, those were the only flaws I found with this beer. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a good and simple oak aged beer, it's not too expensive and tastes good, I recommend giving this beer a try, it's a good beer to get into the style with. All in all this was one solid oak aged beer, Innis & Gunns seems to be a pretty good and solid brewery, I have yet to have a bad beer from them, good job guys, this one worthy Oak aged beer.","StoutHunter","Jul 26, 2012"

A small alcohol bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry woody and vanilla aftertaste. Almost bourbon like, nice and mellow, with a big flavor.","OWSLEY069","Jul 03, 2012"

3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear amber-yellow pour with two finger head, decent retention, and nice lacing. The nose is really subdued compared the other Innis & Gunn beers I've tasted. The signature oak and vanilla are there, along with hints of bread and straw. The taste is a bit more up to the usual standards with buttery oak and vanilla up front, with hints of caramel and toffee as well. It definitely opens up as it warms and the flavors become more bold. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly creamy with excellent drinkability. It's a bit subdued overall, but still a solid offering from a great brewery.","beerdrifter","Jan 26, 2012"

3.97,6.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Innis and Gunn original pours a golden honey colour with about a half fingers worth of sticky foam. Smell is primarily of bready malts, toffee, and a faint scent of vanilla. Flavour has a mellow oak taste, with big malts and a touch of toffee/vanilla sweetness. It's slightly nutty on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Overall, it's a good beer to have. Worth trying, and worth stocking up on.","slitherySOB","Dec 23, 2011"
