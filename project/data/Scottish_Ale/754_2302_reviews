"Very smooth great taste. I love this beer I highly recommend it"
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of raisin, plum, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, light smoke, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. A bit too fruity in the nose. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, plum, apple, light nuttiness, light smoke, light herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Minimal earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, plum, apple, light nuttiness/smoke, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light-moderate fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Scottish ale style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"Appearance 3.5, Aroma 3, Flavor 3, Palate 3.25, Overall 3.25"

"This beer is very smooth and for a darker beer it does not have the heaviness that others have. The beer is full of flavors."

"I love this one, any its petty easy to get in my area,  loads of flavor caramel and sugar, strong hints of toasty bread, I love Scotch Ales and this one goes down very nicely"

"Having had this fantastic Scottish ale in bottle form, the tap version is just as good if not better. Pours a deep amber with light quickly dissipating head that leaves light white lacing. Smell of caramel, toffee, fresh biscuit, with a light peat smell. Taste is excellent with rich caramel malts and peat malt shinning through. Silky smooth mouthfeel, refreshing for a beer coming in at a higher ABV. Light toffee taste in the back with caramel malts and almost zero bittering hops. Excellent as always and one I would suggest to turn newbie beer lovers onto as well as the experienced beer nut. Cheers."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. This was a hard beer to rate. I had one the night before and rated it YUK. I had two more to drink and liked them, so I guess I got a bad one and for that reason had to do a split decision here. The beer looked like gas, poured a weak head that was tan. The beer smelled sour the first one and tasted sour. Next two next night did not. I uess I would try it again."

"Overall, this is a good example of a Scottish ale. The sweet toffee and mineral characters are great, while the beer is light enough to drink in droves. The only detractor for me was the leather like quality in the aroma."

"Strong but , I consider it a session brew ... ideally, when you've got some cheese and meats around for buffering the stomach and not getting too warped ..."

"O: Overall a great beer and one of my favorite offering from Erie Brewing, will always seek this out when the goal is to ""Get Bent", thanks to the crew at Erie for a lways doing a great job."

"O- I didn't know what to expect with this one, but it sure did surprise me. Not my favorite brew, but not offensive."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice beer, I might not need to try this on tap however and I doubt I will ever buy a case. It's a definite try though since I could see some finding this beer fantastic."
""
""
""
"O: a decent brew, despite the poor nose. Higher ABV evident in feel but not the flavor or aroma."
""
"O - The flavor profile of this beer has promise, but everything about it is so muted and soft, except, perhaps the ABV, that it seems a shadow of what it could have been. It's inoffensive, and definitely not at all hoppy, so it might be an acceptable introduction for someone wanting to move up from BMC and see what the craft fuss is about, but a more experience pallate is likely to find it wanting. It's classified as a Scotch ale, but it strikes me as recipe that started out as a slightly flavored wheat beer, and when they went to brew they discovered they were out of wheat, so they used golden toasted malts instead. Once this six-pack is gone, I can't imagine buying this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not too over the top (too sweet or too boozy) like some Scottish ales, but yet has a very nice flavor. The only thing taking it down some was a poor feel due to the high carbonation. Worth a try though if you get a chance."
"O: This beer is a good representation of the style and isn’t that difficult to drink, especially since the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This would pair nice with food. I agree with the person who said that this could be given to Macro-drinkers. It is a pleasant beer, but at 6.8%ABV, I wouldn't want more than one. I probably will not be returning to this beer soon, but it is a good effort, and it would pair good with food."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not so good.. I mean it's okay but really nothing that I'd want to drink again. It's got a lot of malty earthy notes, so if that's your thing then check this beer out. I wish I would have bought a vibrant IPA instead."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: pretty solid scottish ale. sort of interesting to see a beer that has won gold at GABF have a mortal rating on BA...."
""
""
""
""
"So, if you like a nice malty beer, definitely give this a try. But if your heart is set on the ""typical"" Scottish ale, you might end up disappointed."
""
""

"Poured an almost clear ice tea color with a small fizzy off-white head. Fruity malt aroma with a touch apple vinegar and spice. Not at all what I expected from a Scottish ale. The taste is equally conflicted. Big sour front end moderating into a malty midlife and finishing off fruity sour apple peel bitterness. Light-medium body with a lively mouthfeel. Tangy. I liked it, but it was unusual and not at all what I expected for a Scottish ale. I downgraded it for missing the mark for its style. I upgraded the overall score because I liked the beer even though it tasted more like a bier de mars or a farmhouse."
"This beer pours a bold, clear copper with minimal foam and no lacing. The aroma is complex with caramel, roasted malt, fruit, and nuts. The flavor is also very complex with mild grapefruit to start followed through with bread crust, toffee, roasted nuts, ginger, and a hint of smoke. There's a mild hop snap in the finish. It's mouthfeel is medium. Erie Railbender Ale is a good brew, complex, and very drinkable. Recommended!"
""
"Dark deep hazy orange with an off white 1.5 finger head. Very tasty and full of flavor. very much on the malty side with a hint of hops. not to heavy and not over powering with food such as burgers and hot dogs. well rounded overall and worth every penny of the price."

"o: dont think i'll try this again. the aftertaste turns me off. other than that its not a bad beer."
""
"This is a tasty, easy drinking beer. Would go great with a bbq."
""
"God bless stumbling into this thing at an Applebees off of St Rt 2 in Sandusky, OH!"
""
""
"D - Meh. Nowhere is it great - or even very good. It doesn't seem overly scottish to me either. I don't think I'll buy this six pack again."
"Flavors of lemon bread and light grains along with some orangey caramel notes. Seems a bit artificial in nature and has an odd 'bitterness' on the close. Feel is moderate but the finish detracts a bit given the additive type flavor profile. Overall the finish has a sweet component but is really rather dry and a bit chalky in nature. A rather light bodied Scotch Ale which still manages to mask its might with ease."
""
""
""
"O: Not a flawless beer, but a darn good one. Lots of malt flavors and aromas, and well balanced. It hides its 6.8% well, so I could see this being rather dangerous."
"O-really enjoyable, if looking for something a bit different, this is it"
""
""
""
"This is a ""meat and potatoes"" kind of beer. Nice Irish vibe, nice Scottish Ale, really nice for the style.. I'm surprised it's taken so long for me to try this one, but I'd have it again."
"I find this to be a fantastic ale. Has made me decide to seek out more scotch ales. I love the complexity while still having a high drink ability."
"This beer is what it is, doesnt go over the top and doesnt try to compete with bigger scotch ales. It wants to be a drinkable scotch ale and it does it well."
"The taste is that of roasted cocoa beans with a nice hoppy aftertaste. It finishes pretty dry, and the slight carbonation helps to bring out and balance the sweetness in the beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear red-orange color with a small head. Aroma is biscuity malts and grains, that's about it. The taste is good, if uncomplex. Sweet malts and grains dominate for a while, but the aftertaste is the most pleasant thing about this ale, with a lingering biscuity malt taste. The mouthfeel is fairly well-carbonated with a medium body, and the drinkability is good. It's a fairly average beer, all said and done. Could be good to give to macro drinkers, as it has a bit of ""that taste"" with the grains and sweet malts, but with a much higher quality of ingredients."

"Trying the Eric Railbender, which was brought back from PA by my boss over the Xmas holiday. The beer poured a clear amber with virtually no head and obviously no lace. The smell includes sweet malt and a waff of alcohol. The taste was a decent amber ale with nice sweet malt and just a touch of hop for a clean finish. Mouthfeel is medium body with ok carbonation. Overall it is a good beer which could be sessioned."
"O-its fairly drinkable, but i'm not a big fan of this one. its a unique taste but its just not the type of taste i want a whole glass of. it gets old quickly. i'll pass this when i see it"
""
""
"Roasted malt bready mouth feel dominates giving way to caramel with some bitter burnt sugar notes. Finishes dry with a slight bitter herb taste. An excellent beer with big malt flavor."
"Overall - I don't normally drink this style of beer.. they gross me out. This is the first one that didn't, although I wouldn't drink more than one bottle.."
""
""
"This is a very refreshing beer. It's easy to drink and offers a very smooth, balanced flavor. It's a little more carbonated than I would like, but nonetheless, enjoyable."

""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some malts are apparent. Tastre is also mild, some malts, a touch of fruit, delicate flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall this is a mediocre beer."
""
"not bad but this is a tad harsh and not sessionable...2 or 3 is about it."
""
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer. Lots of nuts and caramel malts and pretty easy to drink. Would have again."

"D- Highly drinkable, this is defiantly one of my favorite Scotch Ales."
""
""
""
""
"i really like this one. a red ale (not sure why it says scottish?) but its a red through and through, all malty and sweet, but this one has a nice hop kick as well, and a really jivey carbonation which makes it really drinkable. medium body, medium abv, great palate. the nose and taste are both overloaded with amber malt and crisp american hops. i think it is erie's flagship beer. would like to see this one get a little broader distrobution. nice local product for northwestern pa, otherwise a beer wasteland"
""
""
""
""
"Tasty brew. I just wish there was more info on the bottle"
""
"O: A decent brew. Flavorful, but unexciting. Would have never guessed it was a Scottish ale."
"Pours a nice clear copper. Small to medium sized head. Smell is pleasant sweet malt. Toffee. Taste has mild sweetness. Toasty malt. Some herbal and grassy hops. Very nicely balanced and tasty. Very clean and crisp. Medium bodied. Very nicely carbonated. Great feel. Overall, a really nice beer. Very drinkable and sessionable. Doesn't show its abv at all."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy amber color. There was a very small off-white head that didn’t linger or leave any lacing. /decent enough nose. Caramel malt, maybe some traces of fruits, grain and maybe a faint earthiness. The taste is pretty good. Some sweet caramel malt, grain, just a faint bit of roast, bit of dryness to the finish. Maybe some breadiness also. Worth a repeat purchase."
"O: very easy drinker, had a second with no hesitation. A nother good beer from Erie Brewing."
"Overall: The aroma for be was a little sour and vinegar like which I wasn't a fan of."
"Final Thoughts: Very nice. This is very malt forward and it showcases some great flavors. It's very nice and tasty. Could be one of my more favorite scottish ales."
"This wasn't anything outstanding but the alcoholic kick tied in everything together well, since the malt was not grainy enough to be in the foreground. Most people associate this style of beer with the colder months but it's smooth and weak enough to be enjoyed all year round. Fans of Scottish Ales will be pleasantly surprised by the easy drinkability and nice mouthfeel of this take on that style."
" Overall I have drank this beer quit a bit due to my brother liking it.Its not the best example of the style by any means but solid. Drinkability is above average. If you see this around give it a shot."
"O: A nice Scottish Ale. Would like to have had a little less smoke and more of the tobacco flavor, but still and enjoyable beer."
"Notes: Very tasty and very drinkable. Cheers."
"This is a pretty decent brew, it is a good sessionable brew and has a decent alcohol level. It really is rather middle of the road though as far as scottish ale's go. Pretty good stuff."
"As I've said elsewhere, the downside of the current beer explosion in America is the river of average or below-average beer crashing into stores everywhere. The trick is picking out the good beer from the cases of junk. I like a beer adventure as much as the next drinker, but I do get tired of dragging home one crappy beer after another. This brew plops neatly into the crap trap: beef-broth color and beef-broth taste from the beginning all the way to the tired, bitter end. And not good beef broth, either: it's the ick your grandmother used to make from 10-year-old bullion cubes that had been sitting in a glass jar with a red rooster on the label. Avoid. Or, if you must have beef broth, make it from cow bones."
"Railbender pours out as a deep brown color with some red highlights. The smell of the beer gives off some earthy aromas along with some roasted sweet malts. The taste of the beer has some subtle dark fruit sweetness to it that's backed up but a dry toasty finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall it's not the best Scottish Ale out there but it might be worth trying."
"Overall I thought this was a slightly above average Scottish ale. When it come to Scottish Ales I tend to like the Wee Heavys but I was looking for something a little lighter this time since I tend to overlook most Scottish Ales and go straight to the Wee Heavys. This beer had all the good flavors I would expect from the style, it was just all together more lighter, subtle and drinkable then a Wee Heavy. This brew seems to be a good match for a stormy spring day. The only things I would change about this brew would be to add more carbonation and add in some more hops to give it a little bitterness to help balance out all the malts. I don't think I would seek this beer out again when Dirty Bastard is much more widely available and a better value, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered one because it is pretty smooth and drinkable. If you tend to like your Scottish Ales on the lighter side and not as robust and strong as a Wee Heavy then this may be the beer to you. I would like to see what other brews Erie Brewing has to offer."
"Good, not great. Not sure I'd fill my trunk with it, but fun to try out if your in the area I'm sure."
"Overall this is a somewhat bland brew that certainly was drinkable but not too memorable. However, beer is beer and that's good. Enjoy!!!"
"Poured a hazy amber with a small, white head. Aroma of malts and a bit nutty; reminiscent of an amber ale. Taste was pretty plain; sweet malts and sorta bland nuttiness, with some caramel notes coming through. Not quite as sweet or tasty or alcoholic as other Scotch ales I've had. Medium body, and moderately drinkable, but a bit lacking in the flavor department."
"On tap at a beer festival poured in a sampler glass. From notes: Small tan head with fair retention and lacing. Clear amber with copper hues. Nose is malty, grainy, lightly sweet, honey, bready. Med/light body, soft carbonation, lightly chewy. Fairly dry maltiness, caramel and sweet grains, a hint worty but in a good way.Light toffe notes as well. Finish is almost dry, lightly fruity, not bad."
"Overall, a solid and pleasant brew. Nothing really wowing, but tasty, and a good example of the style,which is what matter sin any beer."
"O - Quite a different tasting critter. I could enjoy this as something completely different every now and then."
"O - Highly recommended. Tastes great. Try it for yourself."
"Give it a try!"
"Pours a clear light brown color with a small amount of off white head. Leaves a lot of sticky lacing on the glass. Gives of tones of vanilla hops, and malt. Has a well balanced sweet vanilla and fruity flavor. Has a medium body with medium carbonation. Has a really good smooth finish. Very drinkable with a meal or as a session beer."
"Dr. This one is tasty and will be gone way too soon. Yummy."
"Finally, the taste was metallic in which ""our industrial heritage shines through"" but it was smooth, pretty typical for an ale taste."
"Worth a try but was not for me because I am not a big prune guy so the flavor just threw me a bit. Not a bad beer overall though.."
"Overall this was a decent light beer. I can't say that I have had anything like it, but I wasn't blown away either."
"This tastes similar to the smell. This is a mild beer. I am new to this type of beer and I like it. It reminds me a little of an Irish ale. This is light in the mouth and nicely carbonated. I would call this very drinkable."
"A very drinkable beer. I can't really see a damn thing wrong with this beer."
"Interested to try this again in the future I think. But I can't say it compares favorably within the style considering my fondness, experience, and criterion with this style."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer worth drinking for a while."
"D- This is a good beer, but I feel it it could be better. I think that the taste could be much bigger, but it is still very drinkable and enjoyable. My cousin had been really hyping up this beer and I finally tried and it didn't live up to his hype, but I still really enjoyed it."
"D- a decent brew and really a nice scottish ale. I am not a big scottish ale fan but this is drinkable for me."
"A lackluster beer that goes down smooth."
"D: Goes down easy, pretty tasty, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style. I'm usually not a big fan of Scottish ales, but I could easily have a pint or two of this."
"I've had a version of this called Ryebender (which is simply Railbender brewed up with some Rye malt) and it brings this beer to another level IMO. They don't bottle it though. Draft only."
"Drinkability: The aftertaste lingers a bit too long for me to give this a better drinkability rating. Although the flavor is good, and the aftertaste isn't bad, I probably wouldn't want to have too many of these on my breath."
"Drinkability - this is a good session Scottish ale. Not too high on the hootch and tasty enough to enjoy several of."
"DB- This beer just tastes like the hard candy I mentioned above, almost exactly. It is not bad but not really what I was expecting."
"Pours a nic elight copper with minimal head. Scent is malt forward - sweet, carmelly, bready and nutty. Taste brings the malt to the front, with the same profile as scent, a decent hop background also present but some sips seem muddled rather than coherent. Medium bodied, light carbonation. A decent ale, but nothing spectacular."
"Overall, this beer is just slightly above average. But for the price, I still consider it a bargain."
"Pours a mostly cloudy, burnt-orange. Thin off-white head. Smell is slight sweet breads, clean, and organic. Taste is moderately toasted, bready malts. Finishes with a grapefruit-like hops hops. Feels creamy and smooth. Drinkability above average. A decent, tasty brew that reminded me of a decent amber ale."
"True to form, this has a malted sweetness that is warm to the swallow without an extreme alcohol bite. There is a faint hop pepper in the swallow. The aftertaste is short but creamy. Rich bodied as expected. Overall, this is an example of the style and very easy to drink."
"Good enough and easy drinking. Would have again."
"Pours a copper color. Scent is full of caramel and nut. Has a creamy white colored head. Has a nut flavor to it that goes down very smooth and has a wonderful caramel almost vanilla flavored after taste. Very good beer very drinkable. Has sort of a nutty after taste."
"Not one I'd choose again, but not a bad beer either."
"12oz bottle. Pours copper amber in color with a thin, off-white, short lived head. Aroma of caramel, fruit and some brown sugar. Medium, smooth, slightly sweet body. Flavor of caramel, fruit with notes of earthy hops. Medium bitter-sweet finish. Pleasant, easy drinking, unremarkable ale."
"Drinkability: A really nice and malty Scotch ale. Nothing horribly out of the box, but a solid beer I could have a couple of."
"D = Went nicely with a roast chicken dinner. Would also be good sipping in front of the fire on a crisp autumn night."
"Overall: A good, strange beer. See above."
"Scottish Ales can be a little tough to find so if it's cold outsude and you find a sixer or two of this puppy on the shelf grab 'em and start a fire! Great job by Erie here with their American version of a Scottish Ale."
"Pours amber colored hue with light head, disappearing quickly. Medium to light bodied for a scotch ale. Comparatively less dense than Old Chub or Belhaven. A very flavorful session/ pub beer. Warming with spices and slight roasted flavors up front. It's chestnut season, so maybe I'm reading into it...but there's a nuttiness in there. Nice lingering spicy finish. Perfect for late fall/ winter."
"D= Very nice beer from this brewery. Very Drinkable could have a few of these no problem.."
"D: Very drinkable. Overall a nice example of Scottish ale. I will buy this again."
"D/O- As Scottish Ales go, this is a good example. Alcohol levels in the aroma/taste areas are well hidden, which gives this beer high drinkability. If you're in the mood for a nice malt centered ale, give this one a go. Cheers."
"I really like this beer. The appearance is cooper color with not a a lot of white head to it, but leaves a thin lace around the rim of the body. The smell is very inviting of sweet malts and a hint of hops and a little bit of fruit. The taste is outstanding of sweet cherries and a little bit of hops. The mouth feel is very smooth and is very drinkable."
"Pours clear red with white bubbly head. Smells of alcohol, molasses, maple, and vanilla. Tastes of maple, raspberry, slight booze, vanilla, and some dark cherries. Medium bodied with light carbonation and a thick on the palate feel that slicks the tongue. From dark fruit to molasses to booze, this scottish ale hits all targets."
"This was an all around decent beer. Very sweet, Very malty. Not quite a Scottish ale, In my opinion maybe closer to a Dopplebock, Easy to drink. I wouldn't mind drinking more of these although it's nothing special but it still works for me. The price was right too!"
"D: Much more balanced than what I expected, very mellow and at 6.8% AVB dangerously drinkable."
"This beer is just more proof that great beer comes from PA. Beware of its drinkability."
"Erie Railbender Ale is very clear and brown with a white head that quickly vanishes. It has an odd aroma, with notes of fusel, spoiled fruit, resin and cardboard. It's medium-full bodied and pretty smooth with a slightly ragged finish. It tastes better than it smells, but it's a very boozy flavor and fusel is present. There is a slight sweetness, like sorghum, with notes of wood resin and chocolate. There is an herbal bitterness at the finish. This stuff burns all the way down."
"Aroma is crisp, more fruity than malty, and just a bit sweet. It pours a nice dark orange amber with a rather persistent off-white head. Flavor is malty and somewhat spicy, mainly cinnamon, with a fruity hint. Texture is quite fizzy and tingly, lively and sassy."
"This is a nice drinkable ale and a great deal for the price. It is not a top notch beer but it is excellent for the price. I will buy it again."
"Drinkability: The sweetness wears on you over time, but overall this brew is pretty decent."
"Overall a good and malty beer."
"D - Well I could easily see finishing a sixer despite of the ABV but the boring on dimensional sweetness would get tiresome. If I see this in a variety case it would not ""derail"" me from buying it!"
"Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is okay. Just a bit boring, but a good offering, nonetheless."
"This was an ok beer, very easy to drink but there wasn't as much flavor as I would have expected. I might give it another shot if there is nothing else interesting around but otherwise not something I will look for."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall a decent beer, but not one that I would seek out. It bordered on being boring."
"the positives are it is a nice color, it is not very expensive, and it will quickly do the trick if catching a buzz is your goal."
"Drinkability- actually very drinkable, like this alot more then some of there beers I have had in the past this is a sweet beer but still not overally cloying, good fun beer, not world changing but not bad at all"
"nice amber hue,not much lacing or head retention.sweet caramel,slight floral hop aroma,somewhat nutty. taste is of caramel covered fruit,slight toasted biscuit flavor,bit of bitterness near the finish,has a lingering delicate floral/herbal hop flavor.a little bit less than medium bodied,overall pretty good."
"Pretty average looking Scottish Ale, chestnut brownish orange coloured body and little head which faded into almost literally no head. Smell is very faint, but what *is* there is sweet malts and a little bit of fruit deep down. Taste is pretty uneventful save for the usual sweet-ish malts you'd expect to see in this style. Finishes up with a pleasant bitterness; not too overdone with the hops. Mouthfeel doesn't exactly fit the style and at only 6,8%, there's more detectable booze than there should be. Not a terrible beer, but I don't think this is for me."
"D - Scottish ales are generally a style that I don't care for too much but I really enjoyed this beer and followed it up with a second one worth trying sometime if you can get it"
"D) An alright brew. Not a favorite."
"Pours a clear amber/ brown with a one-finger thick head with good retention and some lacing. The aroma has nice, clean, sweet caramelly malts. Some earthy hops come out in the end. Taste seems right on for the style, loaded with big caramelly, bready malts. There's some hops in the finish/aftertaste, and not enough of them to really balance the malts. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, kind of sticky and coats the mouth on the finish. Drinkability - the smoothness would allow me to drink a few of these, but I would prefer some more hops to round out the taste."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is rich but not too thick. Very drinkable scottish ale, will have to remember this for St. Patrick's this year."
"A drinkable beer, especially considering the reasonable price. Wouldn't go out of my way for it, but wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"D - A very nice Scottish Ale, although a bit one-dimensional. Still, it's relatively inexpensive for the style, which makes it a good score."
"D- Overall, not a bad brew. Worth a try."
"D - Tasty but a bit on the heavy side for me."
"Drinkability: A beer where, if it weren't for these notes, I would have forgotten about it entirely. It's acceptable, I suppose, but a bit of a disappointment, considering this is Erie's flagship beer. Ah well."
"Value: Pricey. I paid over 2 bucks for a single."
"Overall- Thin body, well balanced."
"Drinkable, but pretty much a middle of the road brew...meh..."
"."
"(Bottle into pint glass) Poured a nice dark amber, almost red with a small rocky white head. Aroma was of nondescript malt and hops, with little else going on there. A little slick in the mouth, there was a lively carbonation that diminished farther in the glass. Flavor was nothing to really write home about. Nothing stood out, but nothing was terrible either. Frankly, I tried this one because of the label, so I was not overly disappointed, but one was plenty."
"Negligible head and lacing, needed a hard pour. Garnet and ruby notes in amber body. Bready malts in the nose, little hop presence. Raisins and a good dose of leather on the tastebuds, with some caramel malt sweetness, some floral hops. Nice carbonation on mouthfeel. Fairly complex taste proflie. One is enough, glad I tried this, but not the best Scottish Ale I've had."
"In the end, the beer is a nice but obscure ale that doesn't give as much earthiness, rich maltiness, or complex grains to compete with true Scottish varieties like Belhaven's Wee Heavy. Too much sweetness and not enough maltiness makes a big difference."
"Review from notes taken on: 12/20/09."
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness/bottling date indication. Pours clear, dull coppery amber. The head is slight, light khaki and quickly goes bye bye. Leaves just the faintest of tiny bubble films and minor bits of lace. The nose is equally non impressive, with just a moderate wiff of malt picked up. Malty brew, smooth and easy enough to knock back. A bit of smoke, a bit of earthyness and a respectable, maple tinged malt carraige. Easy drinking malty ale. NOthing earthshattering going on here, but decent enough. Would work as a stronger sessioner. Good to keep some of this type of sweater brew around for the base of a meaty marinade"
"F: Finishes still heavy and slightly sweet, thick and syrupy as it lines the mouth very slightly. Slight bitterness. A nice drink, but not a lot to it. Lighter than expected for the style, although it has a nice mouth feel. Should have had some more booze, a little more sweetness, more flavors overall I think."
"D-I guess if one were so inclined you could pound quite a few of these back. Think keg parties, quarter toss, beer bong, beergammon. That is the role of this brew. Thanks guys, I'll pass....don't wait up, I'm going out to fill my tulip with something savory with a bit of flavor..."
"D: This beer has some nice flavor, but just not enough of it, flavor and mouth feel taste just a bit watered down. However this beer has a special place in my heart as it is one of the first beers that turned me onto craft brewing."
"While the look and smell weren't distinct, the taste was very nice. Has a graham cracker and bubble gum taste. Crisp, malty."
"D: Good, but I wouldn't do more than one in a night.. a little too much of the carmel/ malt extract taste for me."
"Drinkability: I've been drinking this beer off and on when I was living near Erie and I definitely drink it when I see it on tap, as I think that it might just be the best beer made in the city of Erie. When I go home I try to get as much as I can, similar to when I lived in Ohio and would go back home and drink massive amounts of Yuengling."
"M/D: Smooth, with fairly high carbonation. Alcohol isn't discernible. I could session this beer. Nothing amazing, but a solid, drinkable ale."
"Poured into a glass mug. I have to say up front I had no idea this was a Scotch ale, if that was what they were trying to present than I should grade it lower but I'm chossing to ignore the lable and just review it as I tasted it. Great clear copper color with a small head that rapidly disapates and not much lacing. Malty aroma. Sweet caramel taste to this one. I thought it was well balanced and I loved drinking it. In fact I downed 3 of them rather quickly."
"The heat in the finish makes this drink like a 6.8% beer, although there are meany wee heavies that have better drinkability than this scottish ale."
"Beer is light in body and in flavor. Drinkability high, I will try to decipher the subtle of this beer. First, its not bad at all. Slightly bitter, slightly sweet. Bitterness lingers in the back of the mouth for a while. There again is some fruit like / sweet apple like character to the beer. Its interesting, but not my favorite."
"Railbender Ale from Erie Brewing Co pours dark copper with an off white head. Got mine from an Erie sampler pack. The flavor is of malts and a little smokiness thrown in for good measure. Nothing seems to stand out to me. Could use some beefing up. While this beer is drinkable, i probably won't seek this one out again."
"Drinkability rates high, a beer with great flavors and easy to drink more than a fair share. Dangerous with the ABV but this is a very good beer."
"Pony up the extra dough and buy a good beer."
"This is a great ale for sessions, sitting around a campfire comes to mind."
"D - A very warm and inviting beer, reminds me of winter. A real hybrid between long-term sipping and refreshment drinking. Maybe it's the fact that I drank it in an Irish pub, but it felt very English to me."
"D- not much flavor and quite honestly, a little boring. not sure I would drink again."
"Drinkability: the more I drink the more I like it. This beer is so well balanced and as the beer hits it's optimal drinking temperature where all the depth of the malts come out. great stuff"
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. The beer has a deep golden hue with a moderate white head, decent lacing. The aroma is malty, bready. The flavor is weak, bready, and ahint of smoke, IMO it could have used more of each. The beer is light to medium bodied, average to light carbonation. I think this beer needs to be bigger to hit the style better."
"Overall: this is an average scotish ale. Full body, rich malt profile, proper use of hops, low/medium carbonation, soft water. The only minor complaint I have is that the roasted notes are overdone just a little bit. Is this worth buying? Absolutely. I've had better & I've had much worse."
"its so hard to find scottish ale in my part of pa. what a great beer found a six pack in wegman wish i had a case of this beer. the beer has dark reddish color .perfect scottish ale color. the frist taste takes your breath away its that good. a good scottish ale beer made in pa. hope to have more of this"
"d- wonderful beer that is easy to drink. Heavy taste that would be wonderful for chilly days and nights"
"D - The difference between the aroma and flavor is interesting. It's a good Scottish ale that I'll keep sipping away at but it's not incredibly drinkable by any means. The alcohol isn't noticeable though so a few may sneak up on you just a bit."
"D - A very sessionable scottish ale... Lacks the full flavor and rich mouthfeel associated with better Scoth and Scottish Ales, but there is something charming and memorable about this brew..."
"Pours a murky brown with little head and a viscous looking texture. Aroma is bready with some caramel. I couldn't recognize this as a Scotch Ale.. seemed like a really good British Strong Ale to me but it's definitely within style guidelines. Very sweet in the taste with most of the flavor coming from the caramel malt. Extremely drinkable. This is something I'd want to have a keg of at a party. Unbelievably smooth. Had on tap at Murphy's Law in Rochester."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on October 7, 2009. The pour on this brew is amber-copper but quite hazy. There was limited to almost zilch head on this one. Sweet caramel and malts lend themselves to the aroma with added strength followed by a little bready, overripe fruit on the tail end. The mouthfeel is smooth and honey-like, a mouthfeel that is always appearing to me. The taste is mainly of sweet malts, caramel, and toffee with neutral hops to balance it out. But it leaves a rather malty aftertaste. I would not go out of my way for it but I would drink it again if the opportunity arose."
"drinkability: an alright beer but I wasnt expecting much."
"D- Not all that impressed, 1 is enough of this one, very basic."
"Update: This POS just won a GABF gold medal!?!? WTF!?"
"Smooth, thick mouthfeel. Goes down ok but I'm not in a huge rush for the other three."
"Pours a dark amber color with a decent one finger head. The smell is of some floral hops over a bready malt. The taste has a malt backbone with floral hops over the top, however, not very bitter. The mouthfeel is of low carbonation and is slightly creamy. Drinkability is good, it is smooth and easy drinking with a good malt backbone."
"Overall a decent and easy drinking Scottish Ale."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the slightly cloudy dark amber brew. Head recedes gradually, with slow-falling lace. Aroma is rich, a touch of smoke, and a slight undercurrent of sour. Taste follows the nose, with tartness coming on at the close more than one would hope. Mouthfeel is soft on the tongue, and drinkability is pretty good. Wouldn't mind trying this one again."
"This is one of my go to beers. It's not going to completely wow anyone anytime soon, but it is a beer that I personally find incredibly palletable and hyper-drinkable. The beer itself looks like a standard amber ale with a nice frothy white head. Mainly caramel in the nose with light floral hops. The taste is rich caramel sweetness which is balanced nicely with floral hops. The mouthfeel is good but not exceptional finishing sweet. This is definitely a session beer that is easy to forget that there is almost 7% alcohol."
"Pours a frothy ivory head with a clear amber body. On the nose some floral hops. On the palate; softly sweet and hint of caramel maltiness blended with a nice hop flavor."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours an orange-red color with a fair, frothy off-white head, pretty decent lacing. Aroma is of caramel malts, nutty, bread, and a hint of earthy hops. Flavor is again caramel malts, nutty, and a little bit of a fruity hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied with a touch of bitterness at the end. Pretty good beer, doesn't strike me as a scottish ale, but whatever....a little too sweet, maybe."
"4.0 D"
"D:A very drinkable beer these go down very smooth and you cant taste the alc. at all. I can see my self buying this agian many times."
"Overall not a bad beer, especially for the price."
"Poured a fizzy red with brownish tints with a quickly dieing, but rather large, head. Nice mix of caramelized malt and hops, although a little more hoppy than I expected. Good blend of sweet malt and earty, citric hops as this beer seems to pop on the tongue yet pass down smooth and easy. A little sticky at times but for the most part easy to drink and not a bad beer to try."
"Taste is, again, just malt with a bit of earthy nuttiness to it. Mouthfeel a bit too thin, but it tastes good, and is certainly quaffable. This is a beer that knows what it wants to be and wastes not time getting to it."
"There is a time and a place for this beer, unfortunately the time is not now and the place is not in my mouth... Just too sweet and heavy for a May evening."
"Drinkability- Very good. I find myself wanting more. This is a very nice beer."
"D- A good beer - not my favorite but still a good sessionable beer and the alcohol is pretty high but very well masked"
"It's okay, though in almost every way forgettable. Nothing off in the flavor, just blah."
"Medim bodied with good effervescence. Aftertaste is a nice, fading malty one. A good beer but keep your nose out of it, you'd just be wasting your time."
"Overall, it seems to be OK for the session tonight on a rainy cool spring evening, but I'll probably not buy it again any time soon."
"Merely ok"
"at first sight it was a nice copper tone with a decent head kinda off white.. sweet was sweat hints of hops..taste was smooth with a hoppy malty taste.. with a sweet after taste.. hops was nice with a carmel taste.. not very overpowering just right a smooth .. cheers"
"first pour brought out a coppery color a little lighter than I expected. Head was short but lacing was good throughout. Smell had a hint of smoke but on first swallow all that I thought of was wow! for a style I usually don't seek out this is damn good. Slightly sweet but not enough to last in your mouth and be intrusive this beer went down quickly. In fact if I hadn't planned on 4 being included in 6 pack mixes for a few friends back home I would have enjoyed more than the 2 I did. Will buy again but the price at my store 9.99 may make that infrequent."
"Tasty brew. Interesting enough to have another, but fairly sweet which may hurt how much you really can drink of it."
"medium body, with average carbonation. pretty drinkable beer, but i couldnt see myself buying this all on its own. its worth a try, but i wouldnt suggest going out of your way to pick this up."
"Attractive bottle label which means nothing but caught my eye. This appears to be yet another of the ever improving small brewery offerings in the WNY and nearby PA regions."
"Pours a nice craggy white head with nice lacing down the glass. Smooth, quaffable brew with some fruity flavors, although light. Doesn't blow anyone away with the scent of the beer. Is almost an Oktoberfest looking beer and kinda tastes like one. Not sure it is a scottish style ale, more of an O'Fest. Very pleasant and extremely easy to drink and quite strong, at a fair price."
"D- An acceptable beer for the style. Wroth giving a try. This beer would be sessionable with its mild flavors and low ABV."
"Golden brown in color but not too light; even color. A little sour taste up fron but it lessens in your mouth. Rich, malty flavor lingers long after you finish. Lighyt on the tongue and keeps its fizz, doesn't flatten out immediately. It has a high abv for some but i like it as a session beer."
"Finishes nicely with a balanced aftertaste leaning a bit towards sweetness. Alcohol appropriate and a bit hidden in the malt. Not too hoppy, but easy to drink. I could down three of four of these, which I could not do in a more ""pure"" version of a Scottish ale, which--for me--is a compliment. (Maybe its distance from type inclines me to favor it more than otherwise.)"
"Nice red glow to this brew. Sweet smell touching on a waft of brandy. The taste is smooth and makes me think of a hardy german beer. More malty, less hops, but an okay balance and a nice taste. The taste stays with you for a while and doesn't sour or go dirty on you. I could drink a few of these in the same sitting. It's a nice malty break from all of the IPAs I've been drinking."
"This one you see alot locally maybe because it has a cool name...try one to make sure its not for you but I am not impressed by the lack of risktaking."
"This beer pours from the bottle a clear brown color with a wispy head. The aroma is composed of grainy malt sugar fruit, and a light note of spicy hops. A somewhat complex malty profile on palate: biscuit, sugar, and grain. This medium bodied brew finishes with just a hint of hop bitterness, providing some balance. This is a decent brew, but a little more depth would help it."
"M/D: Slightly over-carbonated with a texture that is a bit too thick for the style, in my opinion. Enjoyable beer, but I wouldn't drink it all night long..."
"Overall a pretty delicious beer. They're a bit stronger than average but it feels easy to drink a few. Not the best thing ever but worth trying out."
"While dining out with my wife at one of our local eateries, I noticed that a new ale appeared on the menu. Not having tried Railbender before, I ordered one. The glass arrived at my table with little head and the ale was brown and clear in color. I noticed nothing different or distinctive in it's aroma. I began to think that this was just another run of the mill ale. All that change with my first taste. It was very smooth with a mild hoppy taste that for me added intrest. Needless to say, I now have a higher incentive to continue dining at the restaraunt than when I first entered."
"Clean copper color with a thin off-white head. The aroma is sweet - almost like kool-aid or bubblegum - with some stone fruit like qualities, and maybe a touch of caramel. Flavor is on the lightly malty side, but not as sweet as it smells. By any standard palatable, but not notable or outstanding on any facet. Well made solid Scottish style beer."
"D- This beer has some nice malt flavors but there are some off flavors that take away from the flavor and the hops are kind of dull that make this beer taste a little drab."
"The aroma is malty with caramel, cereal, and hay. The hops are there I think but very subdued. The appearance is amber with a small head. The flavor is like then aroma with a cereal finish. The palate is thin but OK. Overall I like it. It doesn't seem to just jump out at you as great but it is very solid."
"Bought a six pack at Consumer's on Klein at the suggestion of their ""beer guru"" Wish I wouldn't of. It points out how everyone has different tastes...and I don't have the same as his. Very disappointing beer that seems to missing something. Pours nice amber color with head that leaves quickly. Smells nutty and of caramel malts. Taste is underwhelming with a certain degree of thinness. Not a real good tasting beer and with a fairly high abv, I wouldn't want another. Looks like I'll be pawning the five left over on my brother-in-laws."
"D Good but this is, IMO, an unispiring beer."
"Drinkability: I would give this a higher drinkability because it seems like an ale that could be used for a session. It isn't going to overpower you or get you wasted with an obscenely high ABV."
"D - This wasn't a bad pick up for a mix-a-six...but I would only get it every now and then...good beer though!"
"D: ok drinkability. Good for a few, don't know if I would invest in a six pack."
"Overall, this is an interesting and tasty take on the Scottish ale style. I would label this a good cross-over beer, and it would certainly qualify for a solid session beer if the ABV wasn't a skosh high. Very easy drinking in any case, and a must try for people who like beers that centre on hops rather than malts for an occasional change of pace."
"Pours a dark brown amber color with a thin tan head that fades fast. Smells like a sweet brown ale with hints of spiced hops. Tastes like a nutty brown ale with a mild hop finish. No bad bite, goes down very smooth. Sweet flavors give a good mouthfeel. No alcohol taste either.. I'll recommend it."
"A really tasty beer. Quite drinkable. It could be easily sessionable, but would be a nice comfort beer in cool weather."
"D: This is the kind of beer you could drink all night. It has a rich flavor but isn't heavy that it fills you up."
"Pours a hazy amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, with some slight spice, caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, caramel, and some spice thrown in. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"D - This is a pretty good scottish ale, but not the best. It is very drinkable, but not the best representation of the style."
"Meanwhile... if you want a decent beer with a good kick to it, definitely give this one a try. Honestly, this beer's greatest strength seems to be its well-hidden alcohol strength."
"I'm a bit confused by this brew. The website calls it an old ale, I don't sense much Scottish quality about it and I'm leaning towards a mild American Pale Ale or an English Pale Ale. Either way there is a nice hoppy aroma mildly bitter. Golden copper color with a small head and lots of lacing. Mouthfeel is fine. Nice calm taste. Abundant maltiness with a sharp bitter hop quality. The aftertaste is kind of funky. Overall not bad but it didn't raise my eyebrow."
"Clear amber color with a thin white-ish head. I smell some juicy caramel malt stuff and a little UK style ale fruity business. Tatses like it's going in the same direction except I detect a slightly unpleasant alcohol presence. Smooth over-medium body with a little bittering hop finish that does not go well with the aforementioned alcohol notes. I wouldn't come this away again, but it is not particularly bad either."
"The smell was comprised of biscuity malt and possibly some chocolate malt. The taste was real chocolately and didn't have much of a hop profile. It was pretty thin in the mouth and left a real odd after taste that I couldn't get over. All and all I won't buy this one again."
"D - This beer is quite sweet and non beer-enthusiasts will find it accessable. It was the perfect yang to my salty pretzels, but by itself this is simpily an average beer with a carmel taste and I found myself liking it less and less as I went through the bottle. My big brother bought this as a gift. The price on this stuff is outrageous at $9.00 a six- I don't plan on ever purchasing this beer. Still hides it's high alcohol content wonderfully..."
"Drinkability: Not the best Scottish-style ale I've ever had, but not too bad either. Again, this brewery seems to find the path of least resistance and goes for it. I wish it had a far better aroma, and I wish the mouthfeel was a bit more flushed out. Still, a decent beer."
"Thought the mouthfeel was very smooth and easy to go down. Could drink a lot of this, and did."
"Pours copper and clear. Smell is malty and toasty with light grassy balancing hops and a dash of sour milk, somehow... Taste is mildly malty and dryish toasty tartness. Fairly hopped for bitterness without much hop flavor, though. Medium to light bodied with a high amount of carbonation. Crisp. Average."
"D- lighter body does make for a drinkable drink, another smash for my non-ale drinking family, but i've had some pretty good examples of the style lately and after one of these, i'd opt for something more substantial."
"Drinkability is good. This beer was/is worth a shot, especially for the price. Nothing to write home about, but if your in the right situation this is perfect. Would make an excellent session beer."
"Drinkability is not bad. Not an real powerhouse of flavors, but it's a nice subtle sipper. Definitely an above average beer that is worth a try, and actually pretty easy to drink."
"12 oz bottle: Pours a clear amber/golden color with a huge off white head that lingers around for a while. Aroma is Malty, caramel, and a bit of smoke. Taste is malts, caramel, yeast, bready, and a decent brew. Overall, I think it good not one of the top tier beer that I've ever had but good all around."
"Medium copper body with golden edges. Solid finger of dense beige head. Decent lacing. Bread pudding malty-ness on the nose. Some fruit (pear, candied apple), butterscotch, and faint vinous notes. Doughy sweetbread malt flavors up front. Light toasted edge. Sugary fruits and caramel malt fill up the palate. Hint of banana and brandy before some light herbal bitterness in the finish. Lingering sweetbread. Medium body, with a soft, lightly-carbonated feel. Not bad, but a little light for an old ale."
"pours a med. copper color with a 1"" yellowish-white head which dissipates quickly leaving a moderate lacing in my snifter ; a moderate smell, steely grain mostly, w/ a buttery/toffee/raison note to it ; a rich malty flavor w/ a nutty caramel/date undertone throughout, some woody hops and a touch of metal present as well; a med. bodied beer with a moderate co2 level, almost a bit flat feeling tho ; a very tasty brew, does not drink like a 6.8% ABV brew at all..."
"D = Pretty easy drinking beer."
"Well brewed and delicious."
"Certainly a drinkable ale."
"D : I enjoyed it and I could see drinking it again."
"Drinkability: Its just OK; easy to drink and easy to forget"
"6.8% brew, this would pass for a 4% session beer - watch out for the sneaky alcohol. Tasty freakin' brew."
"Poursa a clean orange-ish/ amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, grapefruity hop and a small sweet maltiness. In the taste, sweet maltiness, and small hints of citrus. Quite smooth, and a medium bodied mouthfeel, and a small dry maltiness, and somewhat clean aftertaste. OK, clean, kind of a palate clensor, and hides the alcohol very well."
"Somewhat pale, hazy orange color. Rather soapy looking head. Not a lot of aroma. Pretty much just ""there"". Metallic and simply smells of beer. Strong malt flavor. Moderate hop bite to it. Decent enough mouthfeel though the finish is rather dry considering the sweet, malty flavor. A notch above average."
"D- A very well balanced beer. Goes down easy and has flavor. Maybe one that I should try a session with in the future. Wish it was more available near my home."
"I had this beer out of a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a nice dark, amber color with very little carbonation. About 2 fingers worth of foam that settles down to some small islands. The taste is of deep malt flavor with a perfect touch of caramel finishing with an easy touch of hops. I would definitely recommend trying this beer if it is available to you. After 4 or 5 cases I decided it was time to write a review. This is the tastiest 6.8 % beer that i have tried, and I would even drink it if it were only 5 %."
"D- A decent drinkable beer often enjoyed a couple at a time."
"Drinkability: I had a few of these straight from the bottle (gasp) before finally getting around to reviewing it. An easy drinking flavorful beer that may not take home any prizes, but is still solid."
"D - Nothing really stands out with this beer except for the drinkability. Really does not feel like a 6.8% Scottish Ale, which in turn makes it go down really quick."
"I'm not sure if this is a good example of a Scottish Ale but it isn't a bad Ale."
"Pours a nice light auburn/orange color, with a decent head that rapidly diminishes and a good bit of lacing. Malty, but weak scent, nice and crisp but not strong at all, with hints of bananas. Same for the taste, a nice bit of sweet maltiness, although no real peat or smoke flavor. It goes down fine, nothing great but nothing bad, either. A very average ale."
"Pretty easy to drink, but for me does not fit the profile of scottish ale at all, and therefore i was disappointed. if i wanted an IPA this one would be easy to session though."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours an amber color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is caramel malt, bread, and just an overall fruity aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's malty and bready, but there's also some grassy hops and peat noticable too. Mouthfeel is nice, it's very smooth and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good too, it goes down very easy and the 6.8% ABV isn't noticable at all. It seems like the beer isn't that strong, but it does kick in later. Overall I think this is a decent brew. I've seen Erie Brewing beers around here for a while and never picked one up until recently. I thought it was a pleasant surprise, I'll have to pick up more of their beers in the future."
"D - Pretty non-abrasive and mellow taste. Not much really going on with this brew. Has a very old world ale kind of vibe. Can't really detect the 6.8% ABV. Pretty good offering, but not too complex."
"This is one of the BEST ales I've tasted in years! It was smooth, rich tasting with a lingering sweetness which made me want more. It is a perfect blend in my opinion. Although 6.8%, it has no bite! For me it went very well with a nice dinner meal or as a stand-alone ale. No true ale drinker will be disappointed with Railbender' Ale. I love it!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Initially the texture is prickly and borderline overcarbonated... halfway through the tasting it mellows, but never becomes anything exciting. Since the taste and overall enjoyment of this beer defines the drinkability score, it doesn't fare well at all... I couldn't suggest this or promote it in any way."
"My first bottle of this had some leathery off-flavors but after a second sample I found this beer to be quite drinkable."
"D - Very smooth and easy drinking. A pleasant beer....nothing to complain about but would like a bit more flavor. Not really what I call a ""typical"" scottish."
"Poured into my favorite Great Lakes pint glass. Pours a lighter copper hue with a pretty thick looking head. Kinda malty at first with a little grassy hop taste. Almost seems to be a little ""spicy"" maybe the hops coming through? After letting it warm a little, a hint of caramel came through on the smell. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Seems to be yeast? floating around in it. Fairly malty which is what I didn't expect from it. Very good flavor to me. I would recommend it. Surprisingly doesn't have the ""kick"" in the taste for a slighty higher ABV than most beers. A good offering from Erie Brewing in my opinion."
"Drinkability: decent but not great. This beer came across a bit too sweet for me, but its worth a try."
"Picked up a six-pack solely based on a recommendation. What a surprise! A very interesting beer. Poured into a pint glass, it looked like a copper hefeweizen, very hazy with particulates. Smells kind of fruity. More so than it tasted. Had a hint of bubble-gum at times. It's a challenge to describe, never had a beer quite like this. Not too hoppy, but not really sweet either. Although, these characteristics were both present. You could easily have a few. I would recommend, but try before you buy."
"Mouthfeel is good. Average carbonation. Smooth and creamy. I would buy more of this if I see it again."
"I don't know how well this fits in with a Scottish Ale - In fact, I am very dubbious about this style. Seems like a strong...well...trying to be strong...old ale? I don't know. More English-type than Scottish-type. Who knows. Whatever. Regardless of style, this is mediocre anyway. It has a little bit of several things, but it doesn't all come together and there's not quite enough of anything (except maybe alcohol). Not ""good"" not ""bad""...just there."
"Flavor is as nose suggests with all malt caramel and toffee and some brown sugar, no real hop presence. I also dont get the 6.8% ABV. A well crafted beer that is easy to drink. Good stuff for those maltys out there."
"This beer has a great taste. Not too much to offer in smell or appearance. I have to say that the alcohol really creeps up on you in this beer."
"Honestly, not overly impressed here. Kinda seemed thin all around for a ""BIG"" altbier. Not nearly as malty as the appearance suggests & where the hops go? Was worth a try..had in a variety pack with the even more average Mad Anthonys Pale Ale, (what is it 31 or 51 IBU's?) and their pretty decent Presque Isle Pils, again not very floral or spicy but this is about Railbender...overall its just an average amber ale that I probably wont bother with again, and if someone from Erie reads this- you're on to some thing here just add some hops please."
"Pours a dark orange amber with a decent initial head that fades to a healthy cap and leaves some pretty good lacing. Aroma is toasty with dry malt, a touch of honey, pineapple, and with quite a rich breadiness. Taste is a little softer, but still has a lot of that dry malt flavor and perhaps some orange marmalade flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and polished and easy drinking. By far the best of their bottled beers that I have had."
"I guess there's more to Erie PA than walleye fishing and gas stations."

"Purchased at a local Beer Distributor. Good beer! Good price! So far a considerable change in color when chilled in the beer fridge. Basic clear amber to clowdy amber. Thick head with smooth finish and no harsh bite or tang. The moderate alcohol content would infer a bite....but not so bad. Good beer/good price."
"Give it a try; they're relatively small market, and I suggest trying their ""Cease and Desist."""
"Had on draft at Friscoe's Grille, Columbia, MD. Pours a deep amber, almost brown, with a light brown head. Smells malty weet, a slight smokieness underneath. Tasted very sweet, almost cloying, some smoked malt in the background. Medium on the tongue, but overall very sweet. I may enjoy more of these if I wasn't drinking any other beer, but they were rather sweet for my palate."
"This is a very good session beer, But the alcohol will snwak up on you."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer and would certainly buy it again. If you think of Old Peculiar as the standard against which to measure old ales, this may seem way off base. Of course, I'm not at all sure that Old Peculiar really is the standard for an old ale, and this interpretation is both interesting and quite nice to drink."
"The appearance was a darker amber color. There was a malty smell, maybe with some hop presence. The beer had a light but malty taste. Had a carmel or honey smell. At first, there was a flavor of carmel or malts. But the aftertaste was a bit more bitter, you could sense a small hoppy presence. It had a slight alcohol aftertaste, but a good finish. Smooth going down overall, had a medium dry mouthfeel. It's a decent drink, but nothing special that I would go out of my way for."
"D- high ABV is hard to detect and its pretty easy to drink overall."
"D: Ok and a beer you can drink easily without tasting the alcohol. Not a beer I would seek out, but ok."
"Awesome beer during the old $2 Thursday special days at the bar. Good enough to buy a case of every once in a while, but nothing overly spectacular. Definitely better from the tap than from the bottle."
"An OK beer. Really enjoyed it to start, less so as the glass emptied."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date. Pours a hazy honey color with a small white head. Smells of bread, orange, lemon, and salt. Very complex aromas. Nice grainy taste to it - what I love about the style - with a bready aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer. Would gladly have another."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very smooth, sweet up front before becoming bitter with a gritty, semi-dry finish."
"I was pleased to see this one flowing on draft tonight at Lancelot's in Wintersville, OH...appears a copper amber tone with an off white cream head leaves nice lacing around my glass even with each sip. Aromatics mild caramel and warming nutty edge very light herbal hops rather clean with a slight mineral character as well. Flavor is clean with a good mix of hops and malts nutty caramel tone with a clean mild herbal hop finish. Mouthfeel is in the light to medium body range with moderate carbonation very nice stuff. Drinkability is really good stuff not the most complex brew but quaffable beer from up in Erie...one of my first bottle reviews I take it back not bad at all."
"Well rounded brew. Not my style, but good for a change up once in awhile."
"Very drinkable for sure but nothing I would go out of my way for."
"I can now say with finality that Erie Brewing Company beer is not to my liking. I bought three bottles during my last trip home to Ohio. After being disappointed by the first two, I placed what little hope I had left in Railbender. Unfortunately, it failed to meet me halfway. Not recommended."
"The smell is mostly of malts but not very strong. Some alcohol and hop flavor comes through too. The taste is of amber malts all the way through, with some hops and a bit of fruit coming through in the finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat flat, while the drinkability is fairly good."
"D: The beer is odd, different in a good way. Well worth a look."
"It's very thick, and with a surprisingly strong alcoholic bite to it. It is a smooth beer at first, but once it goes down it has a surprisingly thick and heavy chaser to it. I could probably only drink one of these at a time."
"Drinkability  This beer hides its alcohol nicely with its well balanced flavors so I could see one putting a few of these down in a sitting. A decent Scottish ale. Give this brew a try if youre a fan of that style."
"Overall, I can't call this drinkable because it isn't very well-balanced, its somewhat high in alcohol, and the sticky and dry aftertaste really stays with you. I won't be reaching for this again."
"Sample at AleFest Dayton: Clear amber color with a medium foamy light beige head. Spotty lacing. Equal parts hops and malt in the nose. Medium-bodied and clean on the tongue with mild malt and hops flavors. Some fruit is present too. The different flavors dont really click and nothing really stands out though. The finish is short and malty. Average overall."
"Overall, a decent example of the style, but nothing mind blowing."
"Not a bad beer. I'd buy a case of it for the summer time but it wouldn't be a permanent beer to have on hand."
"D-This is a fairly drinkable beer."
"A good bit of sediment in the bottom of the bottle. A careful pour produces a mostly clear, medium amber beer with a tinge of red. Almost no head, just a small ring of slightly off-white bubbles. Smell is of mild citrus and grain. Nothing all that special. More of the same in the taste, along with some rather unpleasant yeast flavors. It has a medium-light body, dry texture and moderate carbonation. Overall, it wasnt a very good beer experience. Its not bad, but theres nothing about this beer that would ever make me want to pay that much for another."
"Drinkability: Something that was better than I thought it would be. Here I thought that this beer would be watery and bland for some reason. Overall a nice tasty and very affordable session beer. Something I might pick up again when I go back to PA."
"This was a big seller last night at the Pizza Plant quite popular with the patrons,poured a dull lighter amber with a thinner off white head.Fruity malt and brown sugar in the nose with some lighter sweet dough notes as well.Lightly sweet and somewhat fruity definently malt tilted,some brown sugar and cookie dough in the finish.Hmm not a bad ale quite good but seems its just misisng something to make it a real winner but still good as it is."
"Pours a nice rich amber. Thin head, and nice lacing. Aroma is of sweet malts,and fruits. Taste is smooth, and sweet from start to finish. Yes, this beer is on the light side, but still good tasting. I enjoyed it, and would buy it again. Give it a try sometime!"
"Bit of an odd scotch ale. Pours dark amber with a little bit of a white head. Smells and taste of rich, carmelized malts. Not bad, but not that great either. No hops, but some fruit and bitterness (almost too much). An average scotch ale, nothing special."
"Poured a small, yellow head that faded quickly to a film. Transparent copper colored beer. Smells of floral hops and a pinch of caramel malt; not very inviting. Moderately sweet biscuit and caramel malt, some hop tea, and little grainyness in the flavor. The finish is moderately bitter, and a bit much for a Scottish Ale. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy. It's missing those sweet dark malt flavors. It reminds me more of a big English Pale Ale then a Scottish Ale."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry and semi-musty malt scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It has some breadlike character. The taste is good. It has a nice malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and breadlike. It's rich in crystal and bisquit malts with a light peated feel. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, but not the best Scottish style ale on the market."
"Overall, this wasn't a bad beer. There certainly was nothing overtly offensive about it. It was easily drinkable for the 6.8% ABV, but left me wanting. Nothing stellar, but I'd buy it again based on the drinkability."
"The mouth feel moderately carbonated and is on the lighter side of medium body."
"I thought that this was a real working-class beer in the sense that it works hard to give a memorable distinctive flavor throughout. Good beer to drink on a cold blustery day on the shores of a Great Lake."
"This is a decent pour; hazy amber color with a qicuk fat head, then a frothy lace remains. a slight hoppy smell. I find the taste to be really satisfying, as of oats and wheat roasted to a medium degree, which really covers the alcohol content well, which happens to be 6.8% I think this might be Erie's best beer so far. there is not any after taste either, which I really enjoy, so it makes to be a good drinking beer, one I would keep reaching for one after another. it's worth a try, you might find yourself drinking more than one!"
"Glad to see Erie Brewing Company is still out to try and make good beer. This one came looking like a hazey amber color with a very small head and laced the glass well. After pouring into a glass, had a malty nose to it, full bodied scent. Malty taste right off with some sweet caramel afternotes. Good taste, easy going down. This was one of their first good brews."
"Tasted: 03/11/05"
"I did grab this case of mixed for my Dad, since this was his birthplace and made a fun gift for a split with him, in his venture into following me into the world of craftbrew."
"Hazed copper appearance. Thin white head that leave stringy rings of lace. Sweet malt, peat and candy come together nicely on the nose. The flavor contains some sweet malt and candy, but also some bready and yeasty tones that are pleasant and incorporated nicely. Some nice doughiness as well. Mouthfeel is mildly spritzy. Body is about medium or so. Quite a pleasant beer."
"I realize the Erie Brewing Company is small, but if you have a chance to try it, definitely do. I feel it's their best beer (though there are few), and it should get more hype than it does."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a very interesting brew, unlike anything I've had from PA. The first beer I've had from Erie, and I must say I'm impressed. It's not the best beer I've ever had, but definitly a welcome change. I could pound a few, but more than 3 may be to much. Try it."
"Enjoy!"
"D&N: Smooth drinking, but a bit too heavy on the ETOH to have more than one or two of. If the alcohol were masked a bit better, this would be a beer I'd recommend."
"A pretty good beer from Erie... who would have thought? Pleasant maltiness, gentle alcohol warmth, a slight hop presence... this is not representative of most Scottish ales I've had, which I'm pretty sure is what it's intended to be, but still an enjoyable beer."
"s.d."
"Poured a nice copper. Malty at first, thinning out a bit and then finishing somewhat dry. Some caramel malt, with moderate hopping. A some mineral water flavors. Seemed more English than Scottish in nature. Nothing particularly noteworthy, but not bad."
"Bright, medium copper color with amber highlights. Topped by a cream colored head. The aroma is primarily caramel notes backed by a light hoppiness. The taste echoes the caramel notes, along with a very nice bitterness and finishes very clean. The mouthfeel is solid and well carbonated, and the drinkability is good. A solid offering from Erie Brewing."
"Medium amber/brown with thin creamy head. Light hop nose and light carbonation. Very smooth and slightly undercarbonated. Slight bitterness offset by malt sweetness. Finished dry. Taste is often overpowered by food. Very subtle and pedestrian. Needs more carbonation or more flavoring hops."
"A rough pour brings up a full, frothy ivory head over a clear, deep reddish-amber body. The head holds fairly well, then drops to a nice creamy collar, and leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma offers some nice soft fruit and gently spicy & floral hops above a mildly sweet malt. The body is medium with a very fine & moderate carbonation that leaves it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor offers a softly sweet & gently caramel-tinged maltiness that's well-balanced by a thread of grassy hop flavor and a supportive bitterness. A touch of alcohol is sometimes noticeable but actually seems to add to the character of the beer rather than distracting from it. It finishes softly with a mild drying alcohol, a dull bitter note and a sticky maltiness. Nicely done, and actually quite unique. There's much more to this beer than the first impression gives. Worth trying."
"Pours small head from a hard pour, ruby tinted brown color, leaves light lace on glass.  Railbender is smoothly yet very lightly carbonated.  Goes down smooth and leaves you quickly with an empty glass, a relaxed feeling, and yearning for another.  Smell is a delicate roasted fragerance scent with no notable hoppy smell.  What matters the most, taste, is good.  This brew offers a very mellow, slightly bitter, but overall well balanced flavor.  Flavor gets better as the beer warms slightly; don't serve this beer really cold, because if you do alot of it's subtle flavors will be numbed, and most of its flavors are subtle.  Try this brew; it, like Erie's other two year rounds, is a very solid beer"
"Pours a clear, lovely dark amber, with an off white head that thins and laces down the glass. Crisp toasted malt flavors lead to a subdued but balancing hop finish. Plenty of malt and true to style, but leans towards the hop accented Scottish Ales. A tasty pizza and wings beer."
"Good stuff here. Could easily quaff down several of these. Very nicely hopped for a red ale. Nice dark ruby color and malt balance too."
