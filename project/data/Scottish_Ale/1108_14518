The nose has a strong dark fruit, prunes, figs and dates, nose as we'll as some dark sugar and malt notes with zero hops to be found. A lot of those same flavours are in the taste along with some roasted nut and bready notes. There is a hint of bitter hops in the back end of the finish. It had a nice medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. A nice scotch ale that was quite enjoyable.","Svingjo","Dec 15, 2014"

4.02,3.3,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured into a Duvel Tulip Glass. This beer is a little different in color than I expected. It has the orange/amber glow color as a double IPA or Belgian Pale Ale. Not much clarity to it, it has a creamy white head, but it goes away pretty quickly, not much lacing. The smell is very good, but doesn't really smell too much like a Scottish Ale. Hoppy with some sweet malt flavors, and a little buttery. The taste is a step up, again with the sweet malts, caramelized, a little bit of a butterscotch flavor and a hint of liquorish flavor in my opinion. Grainy taste and has a Hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very good. Full bodied, creamy with a slightly dry finish from the hops. Slight bite, and good carbonation tone, very drinkable. Haven't had it in about 4 years, the first real import I had and what got me interested in trying new beer. Even though I've had many different Scottish Ales in the past, this one is certainly different from the rest. Good beer, I'd recommend anyone to try it.","AndyAvalanche","Jul 07, 2010"

The flavor is nicely earthy and hoppy with some fruitiness and overall very dry and woody. This beer improves quite a bit as it warms, which is wild because I opened it at room temperature.

4.42,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Medium-colored and slightly foggy with a deep head, somewhat off-white and large-bubbled; almost like iced-tea with a root-beer-float head. From the first sniff I could tell this would be a good Scottish ale; it has plenty of malt in the aroma with a teeny bit of a sting from hops; perhaps a little bit sour as well. Some caramel and even a little WW bread is present as well. The body is not too dense but there's a enough resistance that it doesn't feel all that thin; low carbonation makes it feel a little heavy as well. Caramel and lightly smokey malt predominate in the taste-- I could have had five of these except at 7% ABV I'd be wobbling across the kitchen in no time. A pint was enough for this evening, but I'll be buying more.","gfreed","Feb 27, 2010"

I'm not a big fan of Scottish ales, but this is an enjoyable beer. It's not too sweet or too syrupy, but it's still strong and rich. The flavor reminds of a doppelbock, which I mean as a compliment.

3.85,-1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Just arrived at the store today. Therefore I had to give it a try. The beer pours a dark amber with a finger-thick, off-white head that settles to a fine film on the top. Lacing is nice, but has a bit of a soap suds look to it. The nose is sweet, with a nutty character and hints of caramel. The flavors of this brew are better than the nose. It starts nutty with caramel and brown sugar, but finishes pleasantly dry. This beer is full bodied, and yet does not overwhelm the palate. It's a solid brew, and definitely worth trying.","WYVYRN527","Jul 17, 2009"

Mixture of tastes, there's a definite maltiness, a deep smokey flavor, a burst of sweetness (as a milk stout), followed by more smoke and a not very well covered alcohol hit.

The smell is sweet malts, a little whisky, burnt sugar, and some other floral sweetness. The taste is full bodied, brown sugar, sweet whisky, burnt malts, perhaps a little burnt straw too, maybe some molasses with a raisiny flavor. Although this beer has loads of malts, there is some hoppy balance too, the aftertaste is not cloying sweetness, but it is a warming alcohol on the tongue. The mouth feel is a bit heavy, and you would think this beer closer to 10 ABV with its heaviness, and alcohol in the aftertaste. If you like the burnt sugary malt flavors of a Scotch ale, then you will like this ale. It doesn't have as much of the burnt flavor as other Scotch ales I've tasted, and it is a little sweeter, but it is still a nice representation of the style. L'Chaim.","albern","Aug 19, 2007"

Despite its alc. strength, the tremendous hop bitterness and burnt flavour both render it a more-ish and quaffable drink. The flavour doesn't boast as much toffee and peat-smokeness as many of its counterparts, but the end result is all the same - solid and delicious.

I also can't help but think a dark, darker than I have ever had, brown sugar. While the malt notes are rich and concentrated, this beer still manages to finish a bit on the thin side, though only at times.

It smells like my homebrewery does while I'm mashing the grain. The head falls to about an eighth-inch collar of foam enhancing the appearance. The body is full, which to me, is an important quality in a stronger Scottish ale. The brew is all about the cookie or biscuit-like malt flavors mixed with a nutty character and a touch too much bitterness for the style but I'm guessing some of that might come from amber or roasted malts. Despite some style issues and possible over-hopping, this is a damn fine ale.","marcobrau","Oct 27, 2005"

Aroma of hops and roasted malts, with some sweetness. Also, for some reason, this beer made me think of an IPA, like there was a hidden hop somewhere in the mix. Taste is solid; flavors of hops, caramel, wood and toasted malt go amazing well together. Mouthfeel was kind of syrupy and thick, but still very palateable.

Bitter, burnt sugars can be compared to Italian nougat or Scottish toffee. Tangy brown spices and parroasted coffee beans join with seasoned hardwood and nutshells.

The head retention is quite good (especially considering it's alcohol content), and it leaves some very nice spots and splashes of lace about the pint. Smooth and mildly creamy across the palate, it's very fine and natural carbonation helps to enhance it's maltiness. It's firm bitterness, however, is wide and unyielding - anchoring it and leading to a drying, semi-sweet and bitter finish that lingers with notes of burnt caramel. Floral, grassy, and leafy hops swirl here-and-there throughout it's deeply caramel accented, toffee-ish, toasty, nutty, slightly candy-sweet, and subtly roasty maltiness; bringing it to life and lending it a delicate charm that leaves it amazingly drinkable. It's not overly complex, but the interplay between the hops and the rich maltiness is exquisite. Finally, fruity notes from the yeast surface almost immediately as it warms, and lend another level to it's character; leaving it as an almost perfect session ale! And the only thing that hinders that is it's alcohol content of 7%, which is entirely cloaked throughout the first serving at the very least. Impressive!","NeroFiddled","Dec 13, 2004"

Also in the nose was a nice smokiness that mixed well with the sweetness, but overall the aroma was a bit mild. Taste starts of with a big fruity sweetness that is mixed with a bit of caramel and chocolate. The smokiness is quite noticeable in the taste as well. Mouthfeel was a little lighter than expected.

In flavor, the dominant malt impression is of molasses sweetened whole grain biscuit. Diacetyl undertone adds an agreeable richness complementary to the static, mild caramel malt presence. Hints of roasted barley along with the light hop bitterness facilitate a transient drying sensation, which is superceded by an agreeable surge of buttery dark chocolate and nutty brittle mid palate. A touch too light in body to match malt character, but dangerously drinkable as a result. Finishes mostly clean, with hints of treacle and woody hops fleeting quickly. Quite a tasty and well crafted brew that's intermediate in character between an 80 Shilling and Wee Heavy. Superbly drinkable and soft on the palate. Very tasty.","marc77","Jul 08, 2004"

Taste has small and easy front, a bit empty, smooth and gentle caramel work there way in around midway. Some toastier factions come to play with a toffee roast and hard grain breadyness. Hops help finish it off with a leafy and dried variant thats biting more so in texture then with bitterness. Keeps its toasty edge fairly long and even later smaller efforts of the caramel make their way through too. A long holding finish. Feel starts out light and smooth with a gradual building base of malts and toast and a eager little finish with a good lasting quality that was the clincher for me into liking it. But it could have a bolder, richer body throughout, it really only has a strong hold towards the finish and within the finish. Still enjoyable enough for a Scotch Ale.

Caramel and lots of grain on the tongue, plenty of crisp hop bite too. Hints of peat are noticeable here and there. Hops are of rind-like character, and they come out a bit more than the malt in most places, making for a very crisp brew all around. This kind of hopping you don't find often outside of the States. A very enjoyable beer, but I'd pick Belhaven's over this one for the style (out of what I've had, we don't get many Scottish ales here in Arizona, or Scotch ales for that matter, much to my chagrin).
