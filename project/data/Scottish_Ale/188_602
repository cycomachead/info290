Smell is distinctly muted, the nitro really taking a toll here. Light caramel malts show, along with a minor hop note. You can tell that there's more to be had here, but the format just won't let it come through. Taste is better, deep caramel is at the forefront with roasted grains and just a touch of coffee as well. Light hop notes in the finish, with a bit of scotch as well. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but has plenty of body, and drinkability is quite good. Not bad, but I'd much rather get it without the nitro to see what it really ought to taste like.","Mandrake","Jan 01, 2007"

The head ever so slowly disipates, leaving a small amount of lace. Herbal hop scent upfront, with some malt, toffee and caramel lingering in the nose. Taste is light and sweet. Some toffee and caramel candy, slight bready taste, and enough grassy and herbal bitterness to make it refreshing. Bes of all, this is a smooth beer. It's almost like drinking homogenized milk smooth. Creamy, delicious, full body and nice. Very drinkable, both as a session beer and as a complex beer as well. Overall, delicious.","slitherySOB","Sep 25, 2006"
3.31,-12,3.5,2.5,3,4,4.5,"Final Statement: A Scotish take on an Irish cream ale? Lackluster. Looks good, but has little flavour. Stick to Kilkenny.","MMansfield","Sep 12, 2006"
3.83,1.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a clear coppery red with an expansive tightly packed off-white head that is here to say for the night. The aroma is lots of malt, some toffee, and a bit of wood and smoke. Finally, after months upon months of hoppy beer madness (which I definitely love), it is nice to finally have a malty scotch ale to welcome the fall. Sweet malty front, getting plesantly woody and Fruity (mainly raisins) in the middle, with some mild hops and raisins creeping in at the end. Mouthfeel was smooth and somewhat thin, and not cloyingly sticky. I am looking forward to the fall, and hope to try more fine ales like this.","tatterdash","Sep 06, 2006"
3.55,-5.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Other comments: I was surprised at how crisp and hoppy this beer is(relatively speaking for a Scotch ale).

4.67,24.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The taste is truly great, very easy to drink with a great combination of roast malt with a hint of caramel, sometimes bordering to a very slight hint of chocolate. Once swallowed this leaves a suttle refreshing hint of citrus. Not too heavy that it can't be drunk all night, but meaty enough to enjoy just a couple of. Excellent both on tap or in the bottle.

It starts off with some interesting flavours but leaves too much sugar in the rinse. Still it's pretty good for out of can.

Taste is sweet, grassy peat smoked middle, some smoky caramel in the finish, a nice nuttiness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Tons of flavour for the ABV and a bargain at just over $2 for a pint can. I think this will be my session beer of choice from now on.

4.12,9.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I love the way these cans pour. Poured a hazy, browninh-amber liquid with Creamy tannish head. Smell is a delightful combination of toasted malt, dark fruits (dates, plums, cherries), and a strong whiskey scent. Taste is also superb, with a goodly amount of toasted malt and caramel combining with an almost milk-like creaminess. It almost feels as if each taste is giving me a milk moustache. More caramel in the finish, which is very pleasant. An excellent easy-drinking beer.","tgbljb","Dec 14, 2005"
4.48,19.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"If you see a can, buy it. You will not be disappointed as it truly is the closest you'll get to a REAL Scottish pint even though you're 5 hours behind the pubs in Alba. And it comes in a can.","haggis","Nov 04, 2005"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"M&D: smoothness resulting from the good structure between maltiness and (restrained) bitterness is clearly felt deep down the palate, while the freshness of this beer's condition makes it consistently lively on the tongue. Overall a delicious malty bitter at such low alc. strength and a rare treat on cask deep down south in London rather than up north in Edinburgh... it could even be a good session beer~~","wl0307","Oct 10, 2005"
3.98,5.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured a deep rich amber color with a thinner slightly off white head,sweet malt dominated aromas but that was expected,caramel and cherry with maybe a little brown suger thrown in.Mild but flavorful in my opinion caramely sweet and nicely toasted grain but some herbal/minty hop comes thru in the finsh adding to the drinkablity of this nice little ale.A real session ale here something that could be drank all night socializing.","oberon","May 26, 2005"
3.93,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall: As one of locals in the Pub retorted ""Tasty stuff that Eight Bob", and it sure was a real pleasure to cross its path again. A solid performance from this Cask Ale. Recommended - well at least if you dont mind the maltier Scotch beers that is.","TheLongBeachBum","May 22, 2005"
3.93,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Quite nice really. A dark reddish amber brew with a soft head of light khaki foam. Aromas are of sweet caramel malts, a bit of booze, some scotch undertones, and faint (near dead) hops. The taste is sweet and boozy up front with soem nice hints of scotch flavor, and caramel malts in the middle. The finish is sweet, with some toffee flavors in there as well. Mouthfeel is nice for a cask brew, pretty full bodied, and the drinkability is good as well. A nice scotch ale on cask in it's homeland ;-)","francisweizen","Nov 17, 2004"

4.6,22.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Clear coppery amber with an extremely dense tan head. Excellent head retention that leaves a very thick lace on the sides of the glass. Very clean, mild malty and nutty aroma with noticeable toffee and very light hops. Caramel, toffee, and toasted malts are well balanced by bitterness that lasts throught the finish. Some grain character comes through in the flavour and contributes to the dry finish. The low carbonation lets the silky smoothness shine through. Medium to light body. Highly drinkable, especially on nitro-tap. A truly great session beer.","DrJay","Jul 05, 2004"

4.3,14.4,4,4,4,5,5,"I'm usually not much for nitro cans, but I thought this stuff was great. The four pack was gone in one sitting. Incredibly smooth and creamy, without the characteristic nitro metallic flavor. It didn't seem deadened out from the nitrogen, either. This is one of those beers where I can't help but take long pulls from the glass, draining it way too quickly to properly savor, without another immediately after. Excellent.","UnionMade","Jan 13, 2004"
4.1,9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This 80 shilling scottish ale is a real treat whether in a can on tap.It pours a lovely copper brown with a slight head.A nice caramel aroma that carries on thru the taste as well.Goes down smooth and its hard to believe the ABV is only 4.1-a lot of flavor for such a small beer.Overall a great session beer-you could drink a lot of this from those great ""imperial pint"" glasses you get in Scotland.Between this,Mcewens Export and Tennents Special-the ""average man's"" Scottish beers are hard to beat.","lackenhauser","Jun 20, 2003"
3.75,-0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I tried this ale on tap at a hotel bar in Paris. There was no indication on the tap where it was from, so I assumed it to be French or maybe Spanish. Upon the first gulp, however, the unmistakable Scottish Ale peaty flavor shined through. The barmaid didnt know where it was from, so I took my notes and looked it up on the net when I got home. Ah ha! Scotland! This gave me a boost in confidence that I was beginning to understand small nuances in beer styles. Miles and miles to go, but this beer sampling is a never-ending quest! Dull amber with a creamy off-white  not overly carbonated head. Sweet malt, tea and dried peat aroma. Thin herbal malt and tea like bitter hops and a lime finish. Interesting! BTW - I think 801 is an area code, though I'm not sure about that.","BeerResearcher","Apr 17, 2003"
2.06,-45.2,3,2,2,2,2,"Not really that good, very creamy palate, with a soft butter-toffee flavour, very light and an extremely short finish. A tiny bit peaty aswell. In the end though, a bit thin and slightly sweet, not my type of beer.","rastaman","Aug 05, 2002"
3.65,-2.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My tasting was a draught pint can with a widget ball, which obscured some of the ale's flavor.  Much lighter than I expected of an 80/-, but, again, some of that may have been the nitrogen infusion.  Very smooth, with some grape notes emerging from the malt.","Brent","Feb 11, 2002"
4.7,25,4,4,5,5,5,"Notes: I never knew a beer in a can could be so damn good? A very toasty beer, and a lovely light Scottish Ale. I'll have another please.","Todd","Nov 06, 2000"
