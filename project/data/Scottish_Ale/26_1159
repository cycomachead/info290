Almost sessionable due to its light nature.  If you like malty beers then give this a try.  I could easily enjoy a couple of these at the pub.","Vogie","Feb 18, 2015"
3.96,2.3,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Overall / Drinkability:  Easily could drink more, tasty, but not overpowering or really strong in flavor.  A finely balanced scotch ale that goes really well with food (gyro pizza in this case) and I think would be really good all on its own.  I'll have to try to get back to South Park Tavern next time they have it on tap and I don't have to get back to work right away.","damndirtyape","Feb 18, 2015"
4.54,17.3,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"This is one of my favorite styles,  but unfortunately not a lot of brewers are making it. This is beer is so deliciously malty, with the smokey peat you expect from the style and hints of caramel and toffee. I love scotch ales and to me this rides the difference between the lighter Scottish ales  (90 schilling, Laughing Lab and Wee Mac.) and the bigger scotch ales out there (Old Chub, Claymore  and Wee Muckle). It is an easy drinking sweet, malty delight. Great gateway into the bigger but less made malty beers. I think 3Floyds kills it in every style they try.","CO-Bloom","Feb 16, 2015"

Taste was impressively balanced, there is a little sweetness, but never cloying. Lots of caramel flavors, some dark raisiny fruit coming through as well. Mouthfeel was very full, rich and round. The carbonation is light, but it suits the style. Just a delicious scotch ale.","HuskyHawk","Oct 05, 2014"

3.93,1.6,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"if you like the scottish style ales, this is one for you, a true beauty on the malt bill, and while not as complex as some of the other three floods beers, it certainly exudes the same high quality and attention to detail as the others. dark caramel in color with a nose that smells like caramel in the works, sugar melting into butter, with just a slight burning toast character. not much more than a quarter inch of tan foam on it. the flavor is awesome, and it comes in layers, with the sweet part of the malt coming and going quickly with a saint brown sugar flavor, but it moves into a richer, more bready, almost german malt complexion, with maybe the faintest hint of smoke as it finishes. rich is the best way to describe it, but not decadent, just full flavored and even fuller bodied. i find it remarkably drinkable nevertheless, and enjoy the punctuating carbonation. one of those beers that wins awards because its well done and real true to style. i love the grain flavors on this, its different than most, with even a hint of maple or honey as it goes down. i like this a lot in fall weather, but it works here in early summer too, especially in a morning drinking context, especially because the alcohol isn't stupidly high for no reason, i could have multiples of this no problem.","StonedTrippin","Jun 01, 2014"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a tumbler, pours dark brown with a single finger head. Smell is loaded with malt, lots of roasted barley, Caramel. Taste is full of roasty malt, tons of grain, some subtle dark fruit, small hop presence. Overall this isn't my style but it is very good, very grainy, great balance of malt and hops (traditional FFF hop excessiveness , in a good way), some dark fruit flavors, very drinkable. Not the hallmark beer of FFF. It worth trying for sure.","brewtus","Mar 08, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, plum, pear, apple, raisin, toffee, bread, floral, herbal, light pepper, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, pear, apple, raisin, plum, brown bread, light chocolate, floral, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, pear, apple, raisin, plum, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Scottish ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2013"

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"picked up a 6er from the brew pub maybe an hour ago. enjoyed from beer hunter taster glass. brew poured a chestnut purple with a massive head (truth be told, the bottle got shook up quite a bit on the journey from the car)...as the head dissipated, left nice lacing. nose is nutty and brown sugar with very earthy malt. taste is really nice, but more of a brown ale than a scottish ale. tasty, but missing something for a wee heavy. big brown sugar notes and earthiness...some dark fruit. medium bodied. definitely a scotch ale, but tows the line of a brown ale. glad to have a 6er and really diggin this one, but not a classic wee heavy.","cosmicevan","Oct 21, 2013"
3.61,-6.7,3.75,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,"This brew has plenty of pop and character, but it never quite comes together for me in the way I'd like, especially considering the promise suggested by the aroma. It's flavorful and intriguing, albeit a little heavy handed, and the alcohol is distracting. Then again, Three Floyds were never much for subtlety. This is worth trying, but not something I'd seek out.","MaximalC","Oct 21, 2013"

4.11,6.2,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"The beer pours a nice dark and syrupy ruby-brown with a little head of miniscule, light tan bubbles that fizzle away to the smallest of rings around the glass. In body, the beer is clean of particles, but dark and a little murky, like looking through a bottle of Aunt Jemima’s syrup. On the nose, the beer smells richly of bready malts. Brown sugar-coated raisins mingle with soft peat smoke and light bacon scents atop the rich, caramel bread smell which gives this beer’s nose a backbone. There is a light touch of sweet alcohol, and definite rich biscuit, chocolate, and bread notes as the beer warms. On the tongue, this beer tastes richly sweet with malts. The beer finds balance through light bitter roast and light savory bacon flavors from the smoked malt. Ever-so-soft herbal hops also gently bitter the tongue beneath all of the other tastes, while slightly cloying alcohol does touch on the middle of the sip. On the tongue, the beer feels medium in body with a lightly chewy, yet velvety mouthfeel and a very soft carbonation and prickle on the tongue. As the beer warms, the mouthfeel seems to thin out a little, which is too bad. The flavor begins as sweet raisins and light bacon and peat smoke, slowly moving slightly towards a cider-like flavor and then swiftly to warm caramel bread with a touch of cola. Faint herbal bitterness can be sensed throughout the sip, and the beer finishes with a nice long touch of bacon-like flavors and a touch of chocolate and bread. The aftertaste lingers with smoke and caramel sweetness while the tongue feels oddly scraped and dry. Slight maple syrup flavors can also be sensed. Overall, this is a nice beer with great malty complexity and a terrific transition of flavor as the beer warms. The closer you get to room temperature the more maple syrup notes you get from the malt, but you also get a touch more the herbal hops. A beer to try for sure.","Maxwell","Oct 11, 2013"

Aroma is filled with dark roasted toffee, mostly figs and plum. Lots of caramel in their too. Hints of citrus as well. Taste is smooth with the toffee and sweet caramel combining very nicely and even. Hints of a orange note and also some butterscotch. Mouth feel is medium bodied, lower ABV make this one a easy drinker. I think this scotch ale can stand up to most of the other ones on the market. I'm glad more and more three floyds is making its way to Ohio, I have a feeling that our dreams might come true and get full distribution sooner than later.","screamking","Sep 01, 2013"

I haven't had too many Scotch or Scottish ales from the Midwest (other that Founders' Dirty Bastard, and maybe one or two more), but it's definitely a region that makes them the right way, and I think because the hoppiness is pungent and earthy enough to round up the assertive malt bold properties. While I could do without the excessive sweetened, boozy finish, I could definitely have this again. Pairs very well with all kinds of food. Recommended for fans of FFF.","magictacosinus","Jun 10, 2013"

The flavoring remained nicely fruity and sweet, spicing things up stylistically, while the malts took a back seat until thoroughly warmed. Soy sauce saltiness and pale honey sweetness helped keep things a bit more serious, but the residual sugars did become a bit much by the end. The nose felt comparatively cheaper and thinned through. This beer drinks decently but never quite melds as much as you want it too. While I definitely bled with William Wallace, I’m still not sure if I will bleed with Robert The Bruce.","TheBrewo","Apr 17, 2013"

Flavor is malty and a little sweet with a slight roasty-bitter kick on the back end. Unfortunately it tastes way too boozy for a 6.5% beer. I shouldn't be able to taste alcohol at all, but I'm definitely getting a little bit here. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. Overall, this is a good, not great beer from 3 Floyds.

Opens with the taste of toffee, cocao nibs, bread, and a bit of smoke. Roasted malts join in as the hops that have been present, but in the background, surface to add a bite of bitterness on the finish. Smooth Medium body and a medium level of carbonation.

The nose is that of roasted malt, dark fruits, sweet caramel, and a hint of chocolate. No hint of alcohol at all. The flavor begins with the roasted malt and is soon merged with the caramel malt sweetness found in the nose. A subtle chocolate flavor blends well with a dark fruit tone. Mildly bitter. Finishes creamy and smooth with a lingering caramel sweetness. A little dry. Medium bodied and creamy. Nice mouthfeel.

4.12,6.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"No date code, but I think this is a seasonal and I believe my sample is fresh. Beer pours out a brownish color with a tan head. Not much lacing or anything too remarkable. Smells like toffee, some faint dark chocolate, molasses, and yet no smoke which I find sorta odd. Tastes nicely bittersweet, some rich dark roasted malts, with a slight bitter aftertaste. Nicely balanced. Not very earthy or peaty like I have found with other Scottish inspired ales. I swear years ago this was a different beer, big earthy malts and sweet alcohol but now it reminds me of a nice brown ale. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer but quite uncharacteristic of the style and somewhat ""normal"" for a Three Floyd's beer. Mouthfeel is fine. Overall a decent beer but kinda marginal for such an awesome brewer. And please, date code your beer guys...","Star80","Nov 01, 2011"

4.25,9.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours to a dark amber color with a creamy head. Great retention. The malts really come through on the nose of this beer. Lots of caramel with a hint of toffee and bread. As with almost everything Three Floyds produces, I really enjoy the taste of this beer. Very malty, but with a subtle estery sweetness. I taste the caramel notes and the finish is wonderfully bitter. Very smooth with a creamy full body. This is a very good beer. An interesting and refreshing take on the Scottish ale. Nice work again, FFF.","osusullins","Oct 29, 2011"
3.97,2.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is very light and thin with very mild carbonation, a light body that borders on medium and a slightly bitter finish that’s sweet as it slides down like there’s caramel or syrup in milk. Not a session beer for me because it’s not my favorite style, but this beer went down very easy for 7% ABV and I did enjoy it quite a bit.","CHickman","Oct 29, 2011"

4.03,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Robert the Bruce is an uncomplicated ale; malty, sweet and smooth, with a whisper of bitter to finish, I could easily put down a few of these in an evening.

4.12,6.5,3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep amber color with a chill haze. Little, silky head dies down to nothing. Aroma is full of roasted malt, peaty, and a touch floral. In the taste, malty, notes of chocolate, moss, peat and smoke. Mild bitterness combatting big roasted malt and brown sugar. Herbal, tea like notes along with a suggestion of American bittering hops. Fairly complex and completely delicious. Medium bodied, smooth & a good carbonation level. Overall, a fantastic Scotch ale with bold, yet enjoyable flavors.","Stinkypuss","Sep 30, 2011"
3.73,-3.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O - This is a nice Scottish Ale that had the perfect roast on the malts and really let the caramel and toffee flavors come to the forefront...with the higher ABV I couldn't see myself having more than one or two of these","thain709","Sep 28, 2011"
3.68,-4.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"O - This is a good beer, but nothing I'll be looking to get again anytime soon. The most impressive aspect of this one was drinkability. Goes down very easily, and the alcohol is masked very well. That being said, I WAS hoping for a more robust and bold beer, given the ABV. I don't have much experience drinking Scottish ales, but I'll be looking to try more in the future.

3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This brew is really nice, the brew pours as a nice brown color with a light tan colored head. There isn't too much lacing but the retention holds for a while. The smell of this beer is sweet with malts and it also has a little bit of earth of in there too. The flavors of caramel and malts set this beer off in the right direction. The aftertaste is a little nutty and dry. Not major bitterness in this brew at all. The mouthfeel is really easy to drink, could put a few of these down pretty quick if you wanted too. Overall this is a very nice Scotish Ale.","Knapp85","Sep 25, 2011"
4.05,4.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: solid beer, but may not be worth the 3F's billing. They have plenty of other beers, and this is not their best. It's not even the best Scottish ale in the world, but it's fine, and there aren't many available so here it is. Only better scottish ale I had was a home brew.","Holland","Sep 23, 2011"

3.65,-5.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Overall, I would order this beer again. It was $3.50 pint night, so I couldn't pass up a value like that on a beer that's normally $5.

3.92,1.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O - Over all a good Scottish ale that deserves respect. A little watery but the taste makes up what is not there in the mouth-feel. I don't really know the style that well so its kinda hard for me to judge this one. Thanks Dave!","SDtastentune","Aug 28, 2011"

4.07,5.2,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D: this is not a beer to be paired with much food: the amplitude of all its flavors would crowd most things out. Like its namesake, it's strong and defiant, aggressive even, but you're not put off because it's on the right side.","Veillantif","Aug 05, 2011"
3.62,-6.5,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"O: Very drinkable--the 6.5% ABV is virtually undetectable. Goes down well. This is my first example of the style, so I'll have to try other varieties to really get a sense of how this compares. I like it, though. Mellow, rich, malty beer.","shamsoftabriz","Aug 02, 2011"

3.53,-8.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clean mahogany color with small cap of off white head, little retention and lacing. Scent is a big initial whiff of heavily toasted malt with dark caramel and notes of prune and fig but seems to disappear quickly. Taste is mild, a initial dry toasted malt before light sweetness comes in in the form of dark caramel, definite nuttiness, fig and notes of earth and chocolate poke through. medium bodied, smooth and clean. Some good notes but light and unremarkable for the style.","rfgetz","Jul 26, 2011"

3.97,2.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, oatmeal, and chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, and milk chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was quite a nice brew. Really nice for the style which is hard for me as I usually don't enjoy this style too much. The flavor was very nice on this one with the sweetness aspect going on here. Kept me coming back for more. The aroma was quite inviting as well.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Thanks to dgfair for the extra. 12 oz bottle (no date) poured into a dimpled mug. Pours a rich mahogany with a thick, fizzy cream-colored head that quickly dissipates to very thin lining. Aroma is big dark malts, caramel being the most pronounced, with a bit of raw sugar, scotchy peat, and fresh bread. The first sip bursts with complex malt flavors, and the chocolate makes an appearance. A tiny hoppy presence smooths out the chocolate up front and leads into more standard malts, as bread and caramel fill the palate next. Something is hiding in the depths of the flavor, maybe a touch of maple syrup? Smooth, a bit creamy, but not heavy. ABV is just right, unnoticeable but enough to give the beer a backbone. Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Overall a good American Scottish Ale!","CuriousMonk","Feb 11, 2011"

The head was a bit thin but hung around for a bit. No lacing threw the glass as it was consumed. The aroma was hardly noticeable for this style. Most brews I have had in this style the aroma is not as strong as other brews but this particular brew was barely there. The taste was up front bitter hops with only a hint of a malty background. The malt was not forward enough for this particular style or really my preference. The carbonation was over done and pushed way to much of the hops forward. I was left with a acidic taste and feeling in my mouth. I was looking forward to try this brew as it is one of my favorite styles but was unable to stomach it. Hopefully I had a old or bad bottle. Probably with age is that I will never know due to the lack of any dating on the bottle. I will give this a try again in the future and re-review if needed.","BZero007","Feb 08, 2011"

Flavor continues the malt-forward theme, easing from sugar to caramel sweetness, with just enough roastiness and alcohol to keep it from being cloying. yeast contributes some dark candied fruit notes. No hop aroma to note, just a bit of bitterness indistinguishable from the effect of the dark malt. The balance leans more toward the roast as the beer warms, which is a good thing for it.

The main tastes are of brown sugar, clove and ginger. The fact that this beer was on cask made it all the better. The mouthfeel was nice even though it was warm.

Hints of caramel, vanilla, a little fruit, and some wet earth. The flavor is not as impressive as the aroma but it is still a good example of the style. Mostly caramel with a slight herbal edge in the finish. There is a alcohol flavor at the finish as well. This is not overly sweet which is a good thing in my book. The alcohol in the finish hurts the body a little. It starts off as having the sensation of being thick and rich until the alcohol comes in and it seems to evaporate the beer off the tongue.

Knowing the reputation of the brewery, though, I had to give it a try. The color is as dark as can be while still being able to see the ruby red glow shining through the middle of the glass. A one-finger fizzy head forms with the pour, but it disappears after a few minutes, leaving only the dark, reddish liquid that looks like a glass of Dr. Pepper. The aroma is grainy, but in a more positive way than I normally use that term, with an underlying caramel sweetness. The flavor is relatively smooth and mild but is still quite sweet and bready, especially as it warms. The texture isn't very robust, with only a very fine carbonation saving it from being too thin yet almost syrupy. This one is certainly interesting, but it is not a reason for me to want Three Floyds to expand their distribution.","devilben02","Aug 04, 2010"

Pours a deep purple/burgundy with a finger of tan head, slowly disappearing to just a collar of head atop. Took a whiff form the bottle and got some hoppy notes, but pouring this out, little hoppiness comes through in the nose. Very malty, with lots of raisin, grape, plum and other dark fruits coming through. Bit of alcohol in there too. Taste follows the nose, sweet with some roasty malt and a tiny bit of bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is there, but not at the forefront by any means. Mouthfeel is pretty full, and the carbonation is medium to low on this. Not really well versed in Scottish Ales, but this one was quite decent.

Not much hop character, but a strong malt profile. This beer has candy sugar notes all over my palate. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but not too bad.

A dark hazy brown in the glass with some tan head that sticks around a while. Smell is of some caramel, dark fruit, a hint of chocolate, and something that I can only describe as ""bock-y-ness"". Typically bocks are not my favorite beers due to something in the malt bill that I can't put my finger on. I know that's a broad claim to make, but there seems to me to be the same quality here. Taste follows suit with some nice notes of chocolate and caramel, but then that bock flavor hits again... reminds me of an artificial grape flavor, really. Little or no hop presence to be noted. Creamy and smooth, the MF isn't bad at all on this beer, and drinkability is a little limited by the fact that I'm not a huge fan of the taste.

You could also taste that smoked malt and alcohol. I thought the alcohol taste might of been to much. Felt heavy in the mouth. That might of been from the smoked malt flavor.

Tastes of roasted malts up front, slight hop background, sweet malts, an almost toffee flavor, and then a smooth roasted malt finish.

Sweet malts like caramel and bready malts make this a sipper, and it passes over with a moderate malt flavor and finishes smooth.

However, the slight alcohol kick still tweaks me a bit. It's definitely worth trying if you're a fan of Scotch Ales, but I honestly think Three Floyd's makes better beers.","Jekster","Feb 21, 2009"
3.9,0.8,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"The appearance of the beer is a very dark copper colour with a nicely coloured white head, about an inch in height. With a lingering nice fluffy head, the beer looks like a quite nice Scottish Ale. Smelling this beer is quite different than I expected, I get quite a bit of chocolate flavours and a slight bit of roastiness, but not much melanoidins. No hops at all, which is good. The flavour is incredibly malty and sweet. There is a huge amount of sweetness coming form the malts, but there is a chocolate flavour that comes out near the end. There isn't a complexity to this beer as I would expect, but a great solid sweet flavour with a very small hint of chocolate. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel that aids the sweetness in the beer. There is also a nice sweetness. If I was in the mood for Scottish Ales, I could drink a lot of these.","swizzlenuts","Feb 17, 2009"

But the nose of this is dominated by malt and a burnt sugar sweetness. The taste is likewise light on peat, heavy on the toated malt and sugar. A spicy toffee rules over very thin hops and a hint of smoke. A surprising aftertaste of scotch whisky followed me all evening. Medium body with significant carbonation tends to cover some lack of depth.

Taste follows nose. Finish was dry with a suggestion of wood and some other subtleties that I couldn't quite place. Mouthfeel was between light- and medium-bodied; lightly effervescent.

Caramel malts are the backbone supporting roasted nutty notes and and subtle whiskey flavors. Some citrus hoppiness peeks mid-way and provides a sweet and slightly bitter challenge to the sweet caramel malt that would otherwise have full control. A medium to full body with very active carbonation and sugary sticky lip coating quality.

4.22,9,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a deep garnet red hue with hazy clarity. A pale biege three finger head forms a dense and creamy cap that holds well and leaves spotty lacing. Extra malty nose like dark caramel and deeply toasted grains with a hint of roasted barley and chocolate malt. A mellow vinous aroma and suggestion of dark fruit ester form as the temperature rise, along with an herbal and earthy english hop note. The first sip is ripe with sweet caramel and crystal malt flavor and a robust dextrinous grainy tone. A flash of roasted barley and soft chocolate malt preceed the semi-drying aftertaste that puts the flavor in near perfect balance. Lush hop leaf flavors like minty tobacco leaf and earth/woody resins complete the hop to malt ratio and a subtle but ample bitterness rounds out the formidable malt sweetness. The body is medium with a light and gentle carbonation that allows the dextrins lto inger and adds to the rich and viscous mouthfeel. This makes for a satisfying beer, but also one that puches the boundaries of Scottich ale and leans more toward Scotch ale. Thus the drinkability suffers some, but the finish is still remakable clean considering the vast array and depth of malt character. The residual sweetness that does remain dries fairly quickly and the mint/wood hop flavor hangs on with it. A grape tannin and slight plum ester devlop more fully near the end, but does not detract too heavily from the drinkability. A good beer for people that like thier Scottich ale in the 80-90 shilling range.","PBRstreetgang","Oct 04, 2007"

Sweet notes of toasted cereals and grains dominate without question with perhaps a modest touch of caramel. There is even some fairly easily identifiable candied fruit nuances in this one, as well. Taste begins with a sweet malty flavour that almost seems to border on being chocolatey, but not quite. The middle is very slightly bitter for only a fraction of a second, and then the sweet grains return for a smooth, pleasantly sweet finish.

Mild alcohol, anise, carmel, little to no fruit notes, the bitter hops is much tamer then most three floyds, but still there.

It tastes marvelous but to be honest, I would have rated this higher had the hops not been so dominant. It seems I get far more hops than I should for the style. I love hops, but I wish this were a beefy version of the style instead of a hops infused one. Carbonation is active but not in your face. Mouth feels very big.

Very faint hop aroma, almost not there. Upon tasting there was no hop bitterness (which is as per the style), but rather a very mild, very pleasant malt taste that was not overly sweet, and then finished with faint taste of roasted malt without acridness that sometimes is result of roasting.

But this beer is first and foremost about the malts--sweet, earthy, raosted, caramelized and peaty. Nice balanced with the hops. However, I have a hunch that if the hops were milder/lesser the malts would seem kind of thin. The hops support the malts and really bring them out. Medium body with a slight bit of heat from the alcohol that comes across as a spiciness. Tough to put this one down.","MuddyFeet","Mar 03, 2006"

I must say that this is one beer that is certainly more desirable on tap than it is in the bottle. The mouthfeel alone is a good point better out of the keg. One other particular note that I must also mention is that it has a nice sage brush aroma that is rare in a scotch ale. Otherwise this is a strong brown ale. I don't find much strength or peat in it. The alcohol is too well covered. It reminds me not of Scotland or any other scotch ales. If there were a scotch ale light, this would be it. It is quite a nice beer but not a very good scotch ale.

Like the Alpha Klaus Porter, this seemed watery, and overly bitter, without providing the hoppy joys of Dreadnaught or Alpha King. I didnt find much balance or the expected maltiness in this beer that Id hoped for. Unlike Dark Lord, which really re-defines its category, Robert the Bruce just seems like a bit of a failure. It doesnt seem to know if it wants to be a New World, hoppy, Scotch Ale (at which it fails for me); or something entirely new (which it doesnt seem to achieve either).

There are also notes of a slight earthy hoppiness that seem to emerge now and then. The sweet malt hits the palette first with ripe dark fruitiness that seems covered in a slightly bitter dark chocolate. There is a bittersweet aftertaste that is pleasant and lasts for a while.

Deep, dark lovibond, toffeeish caramel malt with a burnt roasted barley tinge upfront in aroma. Mellow floral hops and butterscotch surface after a deliberation. Trace minty ethanol upon swirling. Stately and welcoming aromawise. In flavor, the prevalent malt impression is of slightly burnt, well buttered toffee. Savory, salted biscuit undertone offers contrast. Hop bitterness is comparatively high for style, but serves to offset malt sweetness and facilitate dryness conducive to dangerous drinkability. Ashen pine wood hop flavor. Thinnish in body, with a lanky, dilute mouthfeel that falls a notch short of adequate malt support. Fruitiness of a singed raisin nature develops as the beer breathes. Finishes with lingering hints of molasses drizzled almond, yet oddly remains dry, with mild ethanol warmth. A Scotch ale with a definite American flare. A bit over attenuated and shy in malt depth, but certainly fits the bill as a fine AMerican strong ale. Quite tasty, and superbly drinkable, indeed.

The taste was mellow, slightly malty, but lacking in any real punch-there were no overpowering tastes, and by the time it is on it's way down your throat you are a bit pressed to describe exactly what it tastes like.

Taste is sweet and malty at first, somewhat doughy then ends on a hoppy/bitter/metalliic note. Suprisingly not much alcohol detected in the taste. Mouthfeel is much thinner than expected...quite nice. This beer actually reminds me of the recent batches of Salvator (Which were nowhere near as good as a few years back).

3.65,-5.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"This one pours a deep amber color with an almost non-existent head. Subtle notes of sweet malt linger in the nose, but aren't nearly pronounced enough. Taste is pretty good with that sweet malt flavor and notes of alcohol throughout. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but for a beer of its epic proportions, it's fairly easy to drink. Not Three Floyds' best, I was a bit disappointed with this one. Still a good beer, regardless.","Jon","Nov 30, 2002"
3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Smooth and quite a darkish brown color.  Notes of chocolate and sweet malt cover the tongue on tasting.  Quite rounded and drinkable.  Quite rich tasting and would be a good cold weather brew.  Tasted at the brewery on tap.","frank4sail","Oct 18, 2002"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep amber with a quickly dissapating tan foam.  Very malty in aroma and taste, athough not very sweet, with a bitter finish.  High alcohol, is detectable, and has a warming effect.  Pretty high in carbonation for a Scottish Heavy Ale, with a medium body.  Not one of Three Floyd's best brews, and not one of the best Scottish Heavy's I've had, but a solid offering nonetheless.","zerk","Aug 31, 2002"
4.12,6.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured a dark reddish amber color with a white head that didn't hold and left only a small amount of lace.  It had an aroma of malt and caramel.  The taste was of malt, hops and caramel.  The body was lighter than other scotch ales, but sweet with a slightly dry but bitter finish.  Not the best scotch ale, but no slouch, although it could have been a bit heavier in body.","Wildman","Jul 23, 2002"

4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This one pours with an average, slightly off-white head, amber colored liquid with a malty nose..not much hop presence at all. Tastes slightly sweet, then quickly drys out. A little on the light-bodied side for a Scotch Ale...not 100% true to the style, but still very enjoyable nonetheless. Quite deceptive given it's strength. Good beer from a good brewery.","beerluvr","May 25, 2002"
3.23,-16.5,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"I remember it well, up in MN after seeing Braveheart. Suprisingly drinkable for such a horseshoe. Nice deep reddish-auburn. Smells of hay and a little skank. A bit tart on the finish which was bizarre.","packetknife","May 02, 2002"
3,-22.5,3,3,3,3,3,"With the scottish ale type I was expecting less hops. Hop flavor overwhelms what would be a nice Scottish ale and it is a bit thin. It did get better the closer to the bottom I got however. Color lacked a lot of the reddish color that a lot of the really good scottish ales have.","aracauna","Apr 26, 2002"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice bright amber with a thin head that dissipates quickly.  Caramelish malt and light citrus hops in the nose.  Sweet malt shoulders the flavor but gives way to a nice tangy citric hop flavor.  Tangy and smooth on the palate and highly drinkable.  This is a bit thinner than some scottish heavies and quite a bit hoppier, but I like the variation on the style.  A well made beer.","Murph","Apr 07, 2002"
3.78,-2.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Deep in red in color that finishes off with a fluffy head. Very well balanced medium hop taste. Very drinkable for the alcohol content. Beer label is very cool!!","Reverand","Mar 21, 2002"
3.9,0.8,4,4,4,3,4,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is a bit thin. Other than that, it's a nice brew. Nice, brown color, just as I would expect a Scottish ale to be. The taste is a combination of sweet and tangy, actually quite pleasant. Strangely, I hardly noticed the alcohol. Again, this beer was a bit thin for my taste. Still, it's generally impressive, and I'll drink it again.","mophie","Mar 02, 2002"
3.53,-8.8,3.5,3,4,4,3,"Some smell of alcohol...Flower and spice early in the sip, feels well-bodied in the mouth...malt is slightly bready.  I like it though its more ""scotch"" than ""scottish"" in its noticeable alcohol body and presence.  Its style is not advertized on the bottle as heavy, so I was expecting a strength more like a bitter...","ADR","Feb 25, 2002"
4.4,13.7,4,4,5,4,4,"I find this brew quite flavorful, perhaps a little thin compared to say...Belhaven. But it's clearly a Scottish ale in style and not a Scotch ale.","John","Oct 18, 2001"
3.66,-5.4,4,3,4,3,4,"Dark bronze color, with no particular aroma.  The malt was mellow with caramel notes that had a sweet rather than roasted quality.  The hops finish was restrained.  Mouthfeel was fairly thin, and even in consideration that this is on the lighter end of the Scottish style, I felt it needed a little more substance.","Brent","Aug 06, 2001"
