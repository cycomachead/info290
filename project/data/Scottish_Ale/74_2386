Aromas of scotch and caramel sweetness, with a subtle roasting. Tangy sweet flavors of scotch and floral thistle, with a boozey highlight. Very smooth across the palate, with a clean, hoppy bitterness at the end. Rich, smooth feel across the mouth, with a slightly scotchy and sweet aftertaste. Smooth, clean, slightly drying finish.

The body is in the medium range or maybe just a bit under. The taste is upfront sweet and malty with licorice and a moderate bitterness. It ends off-dry.

Not much at all going on in terms of aroma - faint toffee notes, malt. Goes downhill fast - sort of buttery and not much balance. Muddy malt, lacks any sort of character that good Scotch Ales do - no nutty, smoky, etc. Kind of carboardy, and just bland and watery. Leads to not such a satisfying beer I have to say. This is not a good representation of the generally good beers that Gritty's can churn out. Pass and get the Pale, Bitter, Stout, or Halloween Ale instead.","twelvsies","Jan 23, 2011"

There is no real lacing on this beer, just a small ring around the edge of the liquid. Also it has very good clarity. Smell is good, not great, but good. Actually when cool it really doesn't have much of a smell at all. After it warms up a bit the nose gets a bit stronger. It's big on the malts, very sweet, even a little rich. The taste is a step up. Again it's very malty, caramelized with a bit of a butterscotch flavor. It doesn't taste very hoppy, maybe a little bit of a citrus hop flavor, but it unquestionably targets your bitter taste buds. The mouthfeel is excellent. Creamy and smooth with a clean bitter finish. No carbonation bite at all. Full bodied and well balanced overall. This beer has good drinkability overall. I would certainly get it again if the opportunity arose. This beer won't blow you away, but it's pretty unique for this style.","AndyAvalanche","Feb 23, 2010"

Paired this one with some bread and sharp cheddar cheese, which actually brought out a little bit of sweet malty flavor in the beer.

It has a very light peated flavor along with an alcohol zing. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This has got to be the least enjoyable Scottish ale I've ever had. It lacks depth in the malt bill. It lacks body and it lacks aroma. Down the drain it goes.","WesWes","Aug 21, 2007"

Taste is a caramel maltiness with an over-balance of bittering hops. Taste is not bad, just off for the style. Mouthfeel suffers from too much carbonation of a soda-like nature. The trait I expect from scottish and scotch style ales is a fresh malty wort-like flavor and aroma that is robust and up-front. The caramel banana fruitiness of the ringwood yeast makes me think more of an autumn or winter ale. Decent beer, just not a good representation of the style.","mshallah","Jun 01, 2007"

Very fruity aroma, with notes of sultana raisins, cakey malt, and mild banana bread. Maybe a faint whiff of alcohol as well. Sweet, malty base with mild, yet sturdy, hop bitterness. Mild caramel with a bit of fruitiness. Hop flavour made its presence felt in the finish, where it melded with a gentle combination of alcohol, malt, and bitterness. Nice level of attenuation, still some residual sugars left. Decent texture, medium/low carbonation. Not a bad beer at all, but the high level of esters really seems out of place. It would definitely work as a local session though.","DrJay","May 23, 2007"

A fair sized head is present, slight tan color, which breaks down somewhat quickly but is not leaving much of any lacing. Also noticed this with the last one that I had a couple of nights ago. The aroma is malt, caramel in scent maybe some citrus in there as well. Not a bad smelling brew but not the most inviting Scottish Ale I have had. The feel is relatively smooth with tastes of roasted malt being dominant. Slight hop bite at the end that seems to be somewhat muted but finish nicely. Seems to have more flavors coming out as the brew warms a bit, a somewhat earthy tone.

However, there are far worse things in the world than a beer that appeals to all senses and can just be enjoyed without much thought over a session, one after the other.

Buttery diacetyl is still there, but I get some moderte herbal hopping with a moderate hop bitter finish. Also good caramel sweetness. Not quite what I expect from my scottish ales. I'd like some peaty or smokey character and not with the hops. Feel is moderate with a full moderate carbonation. The hopping is really not working with me on this one. It should be more sweet and with some peaty or smokey phenols. Just okay.","kmpitz2","Jan 17, 2006"
3.83,6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The smoky character teams up well with the hops and malt, although I would have liked a bit more body. Overall, this a decent Scottish ale with respectable complexity.","Shovelbum","Jan 05, 2006"
3.65,1.1,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"I'm not usually a big fan of the Gritty's line of beers, but this one caught my interest. Pours with a real orange/red/amber color and a decent enough head. Has a nice classic ale style nose and taste with ample bitterness on the finish. It could have had a little bigger mouthfeel; but all in all, a damn fine winter brew.","MattBrooks","Dec 09, 2005"
3.59,-0.6,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start and finish, while the finish has a soft buttery caramel aftertaste. Medium bodied. Nice drinkability.","Gavage","Aug 14, 2005"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"I often question the freshness of many Maine beers when people buy them in singles or sixers at their local market. Whilst I am suer that the further north you go, the better your chance of getting fresh product is, for me in PA anything that we get is questionable at best. I learned a lot about Maine beer on my trip to Portland at the end of February, but the main thing is this: Maine beer *needs* to be drunk fresh from the tap. Sorry about that little rant, but this beer is no exception to the above rule. I had this on tap at several Portland-area beer bars. It's a nice ruddy brown colour that is not opaque, but is almost black. Their are some red highlights though if you look at this one closely. The head is small and consists of thick white-ish foam. Lacing is there, but minimal in nature. The aromas of this brew are classic UK Scotch ale. Big beefy malts, and a big sweetnes, are barely balanced by some nice leafy UK hop variatels. Taste is malty and sweet, with some nice smoky/oaky/scotchy notes that are there, but partially hidden by the huge maltiness of this brew. Mouthfeel is medium modied>thick and drinkability is very good. A very solid example of this style, done up right by one of the best breweries that Maine has to offer. Don't take this place for granted all you Maine BA's.","francisweizen","Apr 14, 2005"
3.65,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a good Scottish Ale and one of my favorite styles this time of year. There are much better beers of this style out there, but this one is solid.","Hibernator","Feb 23, 2005"
4.3,19.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Another great beer from this fine brewer. Chestnut colored with a fat and foamy and somewhat lumpy off-white head that lingers long. Thick rings of foam and spotty lace line the glass as I drink. Aroma is light, and consists of sweet malt and some hops. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel followed by a sweet malt flavor upfront, with toffee and caramel, plus some hops, in the finish. Light brown sugar emerges in the aftertaste. Veeeery drinkable.","far333","Apr 03, 2004"
4.12,14.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Notes: A nice beefy Scottish ale, reminds me of some of the strong Scottish bitters I had many years ago in Edinburgh. A stogy beef stew would be a great pairing with this one.","Jason","Mar 15, 2004"
3.48,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Strong malt aroma. Poured an amber-copper, with a nice decent sized head. Taste was malty with a definite alcohol presence. Initially sweet, then an alcohol bite at the finish. Had a somewhat oily mouthfeel that was medium bodied. Ok to drink one, but I'd rather try another brew.","edchicma","Mar 03, 2004"
2.75,-23.8,3,3,3.5,1.5,1.5,"Oh, well, not until I taste it. Bummer. Maybe it's just the sixer that I bought, but this is really carbonated, light in body (like, light! Dang!) and light in flavor. Nothing much to say about aftertaste, but, really, I'm just so bummed that I've got a whole six pack of this to drink.","charlesw","Feb 29, 2004"
3.72,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"EDIT: Ok that bomber I had may have not been up to snuff. I have had subsequent 6-packs that have been much more flavorful and rich. Still not fantastic but better than I thought before.","ViveLaChouffe","Feb 06, 2004"
2.48,-31.3,3,2.5,2,3,3,"The tatse is a major letdown. Very un-scot like. Some decent toasted malt and caramel up front but the ending is just horrible. Very bitter and hopped. Not what I call a scotch ale by any stretch.","yankeeheel","Jan 09, 2004"

This was more like a dark IPA or ESB to me. But to be honest I have had much worse that was called a scotch ale.","purplehops","Feb 14, 2003"
