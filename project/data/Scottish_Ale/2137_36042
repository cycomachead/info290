There is a nice biscuity/herbal/spice flavor that is tasty and enjoyable, but it just doesn't quite reach that upper echelon. Worth a go (especially when on sale like I got it) but it's not going to become a staple in my fridge.","FreshHawk","Jan 08, 2011"

3.51,-4.9,4,3,4,3.5,3,"D: Hard to put the drinkability any more than this, since, while it tastes good, the amount of sugar simply put hampers the drinkability, almost making it barleywine like.

3.75,1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a deep mahogany brown with strong ruby highlights when held up to the light. Light beige head forms nicely leaves fine speckled lacing behind. Aromatics offer up some nice earthy hop accents amongst a nice brown ale/nutty slightly smokey malt backbone. Impressive to find this in West Virginia, all I saw was the ESB I wasn't paying attention to the Extra. Not so much an ESB I'd say Scottish ale is definitely more appropriate if I had to slap a label on this one. They did away with the 471 no it's just their Breckenridge symbol. I had a nice meal with some good beer about six years ago at the LoDo brewpub across from Coors Field. Slightly tart semi sour malt, a bit astringent with dark tea tannins. Nutty dark malt semi bitter finish, tea leaf, tobacco, and earthy smoked peat malts pave the way in this Extra ESB. Mouthfeel is bit thin I could use more body to match up to the bold flavors but it makes it drink pretty easily, mild carbonation. Drinkability is solid I wsa surprised by the alcohol by volume it doesn't seem like a 7.8% abv brew but it's a start for getting WV folk into these types of brews.","WVbeergeek","Beers"
4.35,17.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a great deep burnished copper color with some nice initial head, a bit of lasting head, but very little lacing. Nice malty scent, very deep, with hints of peat. Excellent taste, a very thick and rich, deep and malty flavor; hints of caramel and peat; the slightest hop undertone at the end to help with balance. Goes down very smooth for such a strong beer.

Decent off-white head with retention that leaves a nice lacing. Aromas are earthy, sweet, caramel, toffee, with a slight pine and citrus hop background. Mouth-feel is medium and slightly thicker than expected - debris is unnoticeable. Coats the palate fairly well with a mild oily hop resin. Flavors are also very earthy - it's sweet right off the bat and the alcohol is definitely present, but is quickly held in check by some bold overtones - caramel, toffee, more hop presence than expected, it's piny with some hints of grapefruit which adds to a nice balanced bitterness. Overall, this was an enjoyable American version of an Extra Special Bitter, or as they call it Extra ESB - extra alcohol? Imperial ESB? Name fits as is.

Aroma is hearty grain husks and hints of sour. Taste hits fast with the deep hearty grain character, goes a bit sour in the middle, and closes with some muddy hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is quashed by the off aftertaste, and drinkability is really not that exciting. A disappointment for me here.","ppoitras","May 06, 2008"

3.88,5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Bottle from West Point Market in Akron. This beer pours a clear deep amber color with a medium thick and fluffy off-white head that has decent retention. Thin sheet of lacing on the glass. Earthy malt and sweet caramel along with a bit of floral hops in the nose. Medium, smooth body with rich and sweet malt and toffee flavors backed up by floral hops and spices. Hops bitterness begins to assert itself a bit more as it warms, as does the alcohol. The finish retains the sweet malt and caramel base, and leaves a lingering hops aftertaste. Overall this is a fairly sound ESB across the board.","Dogbrick","Mar 01, 2008"

Unique, malty licorice like, very belgiany smell for some reason. Oh and lots of alcohol. Taste is like a dark belgian, but with a load of alcohol ruining what pleasant qualities lots find in the aforementioned part. Metal, some light bitterness and the drinkability on this is horrendous. Couldn't stomach more than about 3 ounces. One-of-a-kind, and thank god for that...","JDV","Feb 20, 2008"

A good balance of sweet and bitter, though I would like to see more of a balance between aroma and flavor hops on top of that. Afterall, the aroma is very good and hoppy, but it tastes more like a malt bomb. It would definitely be much more drinkable if it were built more like a traditional ESB.","neonbrown82","Feb 14, 2008"

Stats with bread, then goes to a hot, syrupy fruit. The alcohol sticks out quite a bit in this beer. Even when its straight from the fridge. A bit hard to drink from the burn of alcohol.

In the taste, a sweet malt and lots of piney hops. A smooth and very small bite in the mouthfeel and sweet piney hops in the aftertaste. Hoppy more than bitter, almost IPA-ish more than a bitter.","OWSLEY069","Jan 16, 2008"
3.81,3.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"My pint was served with a thick, dense cap of dark beige foam covering the clear, deep amber (nearly chestnut) brew. It had impressive head retention and produced thick, solid lacing. The aroma was mostly caramel and citrus, with some earthy malt and fruity esters in the background. It had an earthy bitterness with notes of grass and delicate citrus hops, some toasty and caramel malt, along with some fruit character and hint of alcohol. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, light warmth and a good texture. Very tasty stuff. It just seemed like the balance was off a bit, maybe due to the increased abv, but it was still a very enjoyable pint.","DrJay","Jan 09, 2008"

3.77,2.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"It pours a deep copper color approaching a rich mahogany color. Very thin head that quickly dissipated. The beer does leave small bits of lacing on the glass as well. I smell a great deal of caramel going on in the beer with a blast of hops I wasn't really expecting. I like that though. Toasted malt also makes an appearance about half way down the beer. A very nice balanced flavor of hops and malt. The hops take stage first but the sweetness of the caramel flavors tones it down quite a bit. Toasted malt really comes to life as well on the finish. This is much more in your face than other ESB's I've tried. The mouthfeel is actually quite nice and full. Low carbination with a nice bite both on the front and back of the palate. Very drinkable, but personally it would not make a good session beer for me.","TheodorHerzl","Nov 20, 2007"

Nose has a rich malt sweetness, caramel and Â“ La Touche FinaleÂ”, a hint of floral spiciness. Start is nicely malted, sweet with a hop bite at the back, top is moderate in feel. Finish continues the malty sweetness, the acidity peaceful. As it warms to the glass and room, the hops really Â“POPÂ” out, a bit of a Â“RogueÂ” as ESBÂ’s go, but I like it.","Gusler","Nov 10, 2007"

Pungent aroma, hoppy and warm caramel, mouth-filling and chewy. Being a Londoner, I always associate ESB with Fullers, but this is a lot more concentrated and alcoholic. The former is for quaffing; the latter is for sipping.","AylwinForbes","Oct 22, 2007"

4.57,23.8,4,4.5,5,4.5,4,"I can tell you that it is not a standard ESB. It has too much malt to be considered an ESB but the malt does an excellent job of balancing the bitterness of the hops.

Smell is sweet, heavily toasted, citrusy and piney frmo the hops, and has a medicinal cherry cough syrup aspect. This tastes rather messy with it starting off really sweet with an odd and certainly out of place banana flavor. The esters in this one are weird. Finishes with a bit of citrus and pine and with an assertive bitterness. Very mild acidic edge in the finish as well. Warms the throat with alcohol. Mouthfeel is nearly flat with a light yet slick body. Not a fan of this.","goochpunch","Sep 23, 2007"

Smells and tastes of toasted barley, nuts, good dowse of piny hops. Nice, clean finish. Lingering aftertaste of the hops. Not a strong beer, but nicely balanced. Moderate mouthfeel, appropriate to the style - not too watery or too thick. A very drinkable beer, quite delicious, you could have a handful of these in a row.

The nose delivers a surprisingly out-of-style American hop aroma, and a non-surprising Colorado beer-making attitude. Flavors are round of moderately toasted malts, leaving a bit of toffee and caramel, to add character to the moderate malt taste and body. Finishes clean and lightly, minty-dry due to hops and assertive alcohols. Good beer, but if you want a true ESB, then go with an English brewery.","BEERchitect","Sep 01, 2007"

I don't mean that they are overpowering, but that the hops are what you smell. And they dominate the flavor, too. There's a hint of roasted malt, but the hops overwhelm everything, including the alcohol. It's way to much for me to drink more than one or two at a time.
