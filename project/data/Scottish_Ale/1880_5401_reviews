"Local beer for me. Only beer Empyrean makes I'm find if and they hit it out if the park."

"TASTE: Light-bodied, smooth, crackery, nutty malts, golden syrup, tea leaves, golden fruits, gum, faint watery smokiness, bone dry finish, lingering smoke"

"O. Suggest for people who like New Castel Brown Ale. A bit of a heavy buzz for 5.3% ABV. Not a bad beer but not amazing either."

"Overall - Alright at best. I would never buy it again, nor would i recommend it to anyone. While it wasn't so bad as to lead me to drain pour it, nothing impressed me about it. Dirty Bastard is one of my favorites of this style, and this falls way short of that. If you're going to buy this kind of beer, just get Dirty Bastard or even Loch Down."
"Not bad but far from being a beer I'd run back to. Weak and underwhelming all around.There's a mild charred grain and brown sugar depth to things but it's pretty wimpy overall."

"Altogether a bit light on the ""Scottish"" style but a nice enjoyable brew on it's own merits."

"Pours a nice copper in color with a small off-white head. Lots of lacing was seen with each sip. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of roasted malts with some caramel sweetness. Very pleasant. The taste was even better than the aroma actually with a touch of smoke. Very easy to drink and no harsh bitter aftertaste."

"O: This was a solid Scotish Ale. More peaty/smokey then most I've had but I enjoyed it. I don't know if the sediment in my bottle was normal (which i don't mind) or not but it seamed exesive."
"someone explain to me how this is a scottish ale? unless its a dumbed down sort of version for the masses, because theres nothing authentically scottish about this. the pour is mostly clear golden, maybe a tad darker, like so many of their beers. a good inch of head on top. the nose is sweeter, but the malt profile is indeed lighter than i am used to in the style not much hops to speak of, but an earthen character that makes me ready for a big gulp. refreshing, too light for the style again, but crisp in the finish for the sweetness. nothing too interesting here, but a sessionable english pale ale style with a medium to light body and enough bubbles to wash away some of the spicy food they serve at lazlos there. overall im not too impressed with this, but theres nothing wrong with it either. kind of par for the course, maybe a little better for nebraska."

"Overall, I do enjoy this beer, but it's almost too damn drinkable. It's got some good notes in the taste profile, and with the low ABV it makes it a good session beer."
"on its own merits this is a better than decent beer, though other than the smoke character in the flavor (which isn't exactly per style either) there is nothing that really screams scottish. Just a bit of a chocolate character and it'd be closer to Northern English Brown, another highly drinkable style. again, fairly tasty beer, flaws are easily ignored and it drinks easy. I'd have it again...just not when looking for anything authentically scottish."

"Overall, a very straight-forward beer. Not to much going on here. Very average."
""
""
""
"This beer's good. It's easy to drink and flavorful."
""
"Overall- This is what a Scottish style should be light bodied with a little smoke finish. This style can be confused with a Scotch ale that has an much more body and smoke flavor. Burning Skye is an excellent example of what I enjoyed in the Scottish pubs. Very sessionable and flavorful. This will be a regular in my beer fridge."
""
"Overall, it has a few certain things to it I cannot put my finger on. It is an enjoyable brew. If you can find it or live in Nebraska, try it."

"Would I buy a sixer of this? Sure"
"A dark yet clear amber color. More carbonation than I would have liked. The beer came with absolutely no head. I don't know if the bartender messed up or if this is how the beer is supposed to be poured. Appearance wise this is not what I was expecting. Smells of sweet roasted malt and caramel. Tastes pretty much exactly like it smells--- sweet roasted malt and caramel. Dry finish. Overall I thought this beer was a poor representation of the style, but was still a decent brew."
"Comments: Good beer. Really refreshing, with a great copper color."
"D: I've had a number of these now and it is pretty decent."
"Drink- I was already six deep at this point and I wanted to try something different and this didnt help. I was not a fan and if I go back to NE probably wont have this one again."
"D: Very drinkable Scottish for a less cold and blustery day. A summer scottish?"
"D - This is an okay ale but it falls short of looking like a Scottish ale and doesn't deliver as much flavor as I expect in a Scottish ale."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Perhaps this beer would be more appealing if it were a different style."
"At first I thought this was just OK, but as the beer warms, there's more & more strange - and not good strange - flavors coming off of it. Doesn't rise to mediocre, & am not planning on polishing off all 12 ounces. Disappointing."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, ok representation of style, body is a bit thin. Flavoring is quite muted - drinkable but not one that I would reach for again."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (enjoy by 7/10) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange with a lot of carbonation, way out of style. A light scent of malts in the nose but not much there, after letting it warm a bit I can sense a little smokiness in the backround. Taste is pretty bland, not much malt presence for the style, some toast/bisciut, almost has a slight sourness to it. Mouthfeel is thin and the carbonation level leaves the mouth dry. Not a very good example of a Scottish style ale."
"D) Not a great beer. I wouldn't have another one."
"Even though the ABVs on most their lineup are low enough to have been legal in Iowa prior to the recent change in the alcohol laws, Empyrean beer only started appearing on local stores in the past several months. After trying Third Stone Brown and now Burning Skye Scottish Ale... we weren't missing much."
"D-Very high, this is the quintessential session beer. Great flavors in light amounts. I miss Empyrean Ales, they do a fine job."
"D - Very easy drinking, especially for a scottish ale. ABV is low, very sessionable. Not filling."
"D- While not the most interesting of beers, I don't have any problems with it at all. Its pretty easy drinking and certainly would go well with a pulled pork sandwich."
"D - Yeah, it also is on the thin end of the style."
"D: A pretty tasty offering from Empyrean; this easy going session beer is pretty good in any season; there is, however, something slightly off puting about the sweetness over time"
"My first foray into scotch beers and I loved it."
"I had this beer on tap at Lazlo's in Lincoln, NE. The color of this beer was lighter than expected. Most Scottish Ales I have had were darker and had a rich earthy nose. The color and nose of this beer is much lighter. It is a light orange-gold in color with a very light malt nose. The flavor is very light as well. I do pick up malt and a very slight smoky / peaty flavor but very little overall. The Mouthfeel is very light with moderate carbonation. While it's one of the best I tried from the Empyrean Brewing Company, it still comes off as watery and too light in body."
"An interesting beer, sweet and light makes for easy consumption but will also give you cavities. Overall a little to tangy but kind of tasty at the same time."
"Decent brew that captures some of the intended Scotch Ale peat, campfire character, and with crisp, well-attenuated malts. Enough hops to balance, but not enough to compete with the sweetness or the prominant smoky character. Lightly phenolic (plastic and smoke) with a big bruised apple flavor and quite yeasty. Finishes mostly crisp, with a linger of the apple, fruity flavors. Good beer, but the apple is a bit distrating, and a better malty body would have drastically improved the beer."
"I drank this brew on New Years Eve after a couple of domestic brews and I drank it straight from the bottle. The first whiff of this brew was nice, a semi sweet fragrance. This brew has a great mouth feel and a nice finish. This is my first experience with a Scottish ale, but I like it enough to sample some more."
"Ah the Skye is burning me lads! I've had this beer a few times and I always have felt I got me shillings worth. Pours a light amber into the mug. Maybe a caramel color is a better way of saying it. Mine are out of date as they say drink by 10/12/07 or something like that. Maybe that's why the head is a bit weaker than I remember. Tis a good beer to be sure. I like the malty profile with the sweet butterscotch finish. I remember reading somewhere that this beer goes good with barbecue chicken, Jolly Ho! I believe whoever said that was on to something. One must sip this beer to enjoy it. I plan on getting some of these for next Summer when I fire up the grill and smoke some leg-quarters. Will make a good fire putter-outter as well as thirst quencher, mind ye, I don't be using just any beer for pouring over my BBQ!"
"Body is a touch light but it's plenty drinkable. I've had better but it's still a fine Scottish ale."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, some sticky lacingin around the edges. The nose is malty, slightly piney, and lots of caramel. The taste is bitter, malty, piney, and lots of caramel. The finish is dry. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice tasty brew."
"Flavor is decent with some caramel and toffee and just a bit of grain again. Some general sugary sweetness too. No hops or alcohol anywhere on the flavor. The beer drinks very easy but isnt the most enjoyable flavor. Decent but certainly not great."
"Overall a very clean drink. Wouldn't hurt for some more complexity, but what can you do without using hops..."
"Drinkability: Good. This is a great example of a 90 schilling ale. Very clean and complex."
"The body is fairly full from all of the caramel malts. Carbonation seems a little much for the style, but it still feels fairly creamy even despite the prickly burning sensation on the palate. A decent all-around beer. Definitely one of the more unique examples I've had, though that isn't necessarily a good thing (nor is it really a bad thing... it just is what it is). I would definitely consider drinking it alongside a glass of scotch whisky, which means I might pick up a bottle or 6 in the future."
"No aroma to speak of, if I inhaled hard enough, I could pull in some malt notes. Taste was more of a hoppy PA than Scottish ale  but it did have some subtle notes of malt and caramel to at least make it average. Watery and thin, I wouldnt spend any hard-earned cash buying a sixer."
"If there were a 6th cattegory for Sound, this one would get a 5 for the Snap-Crackle-Pop."
"D - More or less nondescript...not a bad representation for the style, but not a top pick either."
"Pretty good beer for the style, just not my favorite, I wouldn't recommend consuming more than one of these at a single sitting."
"received in a trade with jhammerly"
"Enjoyable, clean and refreshing."
"Poured into an Imperial pint glass. A bright clear honey-orange color, slightly hazy. Mild white head, about a 1/2 inch thick, receded to a slight filmy lace. Smell is mildly sweet like caramel, a bit of honey/floral notes. Taste is predominantly malt but there is the slightest hint of hops. Honey is present but not overly sweet. A subtle smokiness blended in. Mouthfeel has a nice crisp carbonation, medium bodied. This is very drinkable, could easily be a session beer."
"Drinkability: Good easy drinker. Not sure how representative of the style this one is though. Pairs well with certain foods as suggested foods in the menu."
"Drinkable and interesting, although definitely not much of a Scottish Ale."
"On tap at Buzzard Billy's Lincoln, Ne. Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly no lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet smokey nose. Starts sweet, clean finish, malt comes through late, hops in background. $3.75 for a 16oz glass."
"Drinks pretty good& I enjoyed it. But the sweetness prevents this from being a session ale. I reccommend it just the same. A pleasant suprise!"
"Several of Empyrean's beers seemed like watered down versions of the beer types they were supposed to represent, including this one, their oatmeal stout and their honey gold. I thought this was strange. Maybe in Nebraska they play it safe with their brewing (although Thunderhead in Kearney gets everything right so that theory doesn't hold water)."
"cheers..."
"I remember having this beer a few years ago. I haven't bought it since and might not again. Doesn't measure up to Empyrean's brown or porter."
"The taste is mostly malt but sweet. Like syrup or a molasses. At the end there is a citrus hop flavor that is light and blends with the malt. But really, it seems too much hops. The body is light and it has a slightly watery characteristic to it."
"Nothing is saying, take me home and I will be your significant other. A not unpleasant brew this Burning Skye Scottish Style Scottish Style Ale from Empyrean Brewing Co. but its not blowing up my skirt either because in my humble opinion... this is no Scottish Style Ale."
"Special to Brent (Bditty) for sending in the package of NE beers."
"All in all, the cask version of Burning Skye Scottish Ale is an improvement over the other versions of the beer, and is definitely something I'd enjoy to have again in the future."
"Sampled from bottle, traded with bditty187 from NE. Pours a clear copper with a collared white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is very subtle with just a hint of crystal malt and a floral/candy sweetness. Flavor is semi-sweet, smokey with a small floral, pine and spice hop flavor addition. Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. An interesting interpretation of the style."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy deep apricot color with two fingers of head that die off quickly. There is no lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty. Some orange and white grape aromas. A little bit of a yeasty character as well. The taste is also sweet and fruity. Pear and grape flavors and a little bit of caramel sweetness. Certainly doesn't taste like a Scottish Ale. The mouthfeel is just a little watered down. The drinkability is good though. A good beer, but definately not a Scottish Ale."
"Thanks to Bditty for the bottle!"
"707"
"Overall, a solid beer, but it's not what I expect from a Scottish style ale. Big thanks to bditty187 for the bottle!"
"Props to my friend bditty187 for this one."
"Felt a little thin, but with the mix of flavor, and the mildness of the flavor, I could drink many of these."
"A rough pour brings up a good sized head of frothy off-white foam. It drops shortly to a half inch or so, but holds well from that point on and leaves some minor lace. The amber body is just slightly hazy, and fine bubbles can be seen slowly rising towards the surface. A touch of smoke and a gently toasty malt are present in the nose. The smokiness is far from overwhelming, and accentuates the malt nicely. The body is medium, and the soft carbonation gently caresses the tongue - it's smooth and lightly creamy across the palate. A softly sweet and mildly biscuity/toasty malt carries through the majority of the flavor, only truly revealing it's subtly smoky side in the finish. Well balanced. Well brewed. Satisfying and very drinkable!"
"All in all, a complex and very tasty Scottish ale from Nebraska. Thanks to bditty for sending it up here!"
"Pours a medium amber color with a thin and creamy white head that quickly fades into a collar of lace. Nose is sweet with notes of dark malts and honey. Light to medium in body and thinner than I was expecting. Taste is sweet toasted malts and grains blended some notes of honey followed by some mildly bitter hops, but the sweetness wins out. Not great but certainly something Id drink again if I had the opportunity. Thanks to bditty187 for the sample!"
"Clear coppery-bronze hue, slight tawny influences too, it is a pleasant color but I cant help but think it is going to be thin tasting. This is not a good first impression. A very hard pour is required to produce a head of a finger in height; it faded quickly to a very sparse soapy collar. Subsequent lacing was absent. This is my number one grievance with Empyrean, the head retention of all of their core beers are lousy! The nose is unique with a mix of chocolate malt, honey-like sweetness, and a trace of faint hops spice. The potency is very limited; it seems more inadequate on this sample that I am reviewing than others Ive had over the years. Ill still review it, as I smell it. The palate reminds of an Oktoberfest-style lager with smoked peat/barley and chocolate malts added, the hoppiness is a little strong for a Scottish Ale, which this beer is trying to be. On the other hand the maltiness is a touch thin. But with both of those negatives stated I find Burning Skye to be a tasty beverage, it works well with BBQ. It is on the simple side but I find it tasty. Medium in body, the carbonation is low and typical for the brewery. It is also plenty drinkable. It is a solid offering from Empyrean and a beer worth trying if you are visiting the Cornhusker state."
