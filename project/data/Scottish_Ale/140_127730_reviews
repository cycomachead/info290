"Mouthfeel is on the slick side with mild carbonation, a medium body and a malty sweetness that trails off grainy and hides the ABV completely. This was the last of the Beer Camp mixed 12 pack and was just an average beer overall, maybe above average for the style."
"An interesting Scottish ale brewed with sweet potato. Great flavor, nice caramel malt. Definitely a worthy beer to check out."
"3.43/5.00"
""
" Really just an average brew all the way around. Not worth the time or money unfortunately. It is the worst in the pack by any means, but still not anything to write home about. I see it pairing well with bread pudding with rum sauce or the classic sweet potato pie. It gets a 72/100."
"A well crafted brew, but it's not something I would go out and buy.  One is plenty."
"I Pop!ped the cap and commenced another light pour down the side of the glass in consideration of its age. I still got a finger of dense, light-tan head with great retention for a cap as the result! Color was Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, "
"I thought that the sweet potatoes would give more mouth feel than it had. Not disappointing, just lighter than I expected. Good beer though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is almost as weird as I wanted. The sweet potato aroma and flavor is just subtle enough that it works. Unfortunately, as a Scottish Ale, this is somewhat lacking. Still entertaining."
"I thought the beer looked a lot better then it tasted."

"Picked up a growler of this to accompany NFL conference championship day, poured into my mug. Color was outstanding, mahogany, but more red maybe. Not a ton of head. The flavor however wasn't great. Usually you get more flavor out of a Scottish ale, and this one was lacking. Some hints of wood and malt. The flavor was similar. Somewhat disappointing."
"Deep mohagany with some ruby hues and a tan head that settles to a cap and laces really well, it's a pretty beer.  Aromas are of toffee, caramel, earth, really light citrus and a touch vegetal.  Aromas are very muddled and really needed to be focused on to pull out.  Taste follows with some nice toffee and burnt caramel notes, a touch of citrus mid palate gives way to an earthy and vegetal note in the finish that I assume is from the sweet potato.  Not overly bitter and very drinkable.  Medium body with lower carbonation and a really nice creamy feel that coats the palate well.  I can't say I was over the top with this but I found it enjoyable all the same."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am impressed with this I haven't had many Sweet Potato brews and this one was pretty damn tasty."
"Mahogany to dark copper body with a sparse tan head. Aromas of caramel malts, brown sugar, a touch of spice.  A tad sweet, finishing with a sharp hop bite. No easily discernible yam flavor, though I can see it a bit since I'm seeking it. Whatever."
"O - Not too much going on in this brew.  Its an easy to drink ale, but was hoping to get more of the sweet potato in this one"
""
""
"Very good taste, but with a little too much front end hops to taste for style. Dark color, satisfying 7% ABV. Cut late hops in half and this is an ideal beer for me as far as Scottish beers go. Great malt flavor"

"Overall, not bad, especially considering Scottish Ales are far from my favorite style. Feel this one utilizes the sweet potato much better than Tired Hands attempt at marrying it with a Marzen."
""
"11/26...BCAA 9/12...pours deep reddish brown, light through in the bottom blocked at the top. Laces along the sides. Amber ale smell - caramels, toffee, breads and a little earthy. Taste is very peat-y with a scotch whisky blend. The sweet potato flavor is modestly apparent. Backed by a nice hop bite. Interesting."

"Nice. The flavor profile flows like a spectrum rather than clicks from taste to taste. Very smooth, sweet and easy to drink. A nose like my dorm room on a Sunday morning after a party (which wasn't a bad thing if you're a beer geek). Yay sweet potatoes!"
""
"Real nice Scottish ale, brewed with Sweet potatoes, honestly I cant pull much of them out. It really tastes like a nice Octoberfest to me. Has the perfect balance of flavor and a nice light body. Overll, I would definitely like to see this brewed for mass distribution one day~"

"Pleasing and nice aroma. Crisp bitterness balances the malt well"

"o: A different Scotch ale, not as malty as others of the genre but with a smoother texture than most."
""
""
"Overall, I thought that this beer was OK. The beer appeared a nice deep, dark color that had a very nice, off-white, rocky head that was very well retained. The beer gave off a nice, sweet malty aroma, but it was tough to distinguish any distinct part. The flavor of the beer was good, malty, but like the taste, nothing too distinctive. The beer; however, was nice and creamy and had a good fell to it with a nice mild, but slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall, a slightly better than average beer."
"Dark broom, semi-opaque, big brown fluffy head, good retention and nice lacing. Smell is vegetal and sweet malt. Taste is pretty sweet malty, with some caramel and grassy hop notes. Mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy, with a nice bit of carbonation to add just the right feel. Overall,  it was OK, but I've certainly had lot better scotch ales."
""
"Worth trying."
""
""
"Overall:"
""
""
""
""

"Taste improves the overall outlook of the brew with potato muddled caramel, a nice creamy texture and some spice.  Touch of molasses on the finish and some cocoa spice.  Smooth creamy feel.  Overall a good blend of flavors, interesting yet not really memorable."

"3.88 | 87 | B+"

"Overall not a bad beer to try, a different spin on the Scottish style."
"Overall a very good beer but not tasting much sweet potato."

"A standard pour yields two plus fingers worth of rich voluminous crisp medium khaki colored frothy goodness...  Really good retention...  The color is a medium to dark brown with just a touch or murkiness mixed in...  A moderate bit of moderate paced carbonation...  The aroma is rich with sweet potato, marshmallow and toffee...  A hint of milk chocolate and brown sugar as well...  Very pleasant aroma all the way around...  The flavor is rich and robust but a significant deviation from the aroma...  Roasted malt, coffee and peat materialize after not being detected on the nose...  There is actually a fairly potent hop bite, especially by style standards...  The end result is a highly complex and highly enjoyable flavor profile...  The mouthfeel is a tad bit thin and on the lighter side of medium bodied...  Crisp with some prickly carbonation...  A rather enjoyable beer...  This style seems to be falling a bit out of mainstream, but it is one that I still greatly...  It's brews like this that remind what an exquisite style it really is..."

"O- I liked the taste of this one, but there was a bit too much bitterness to this. Don't know if it was hops or sweet potatoes. Strays from the style just a bit."
""
"O: Interesting idea to use sweet potato, and I did taste more than I expected. Still, not super impressed by this one."
""
"an okay beer, but one of the weaker beers in the Beer Camp pack."
""
""
""
"Another solid offering from tge Beer Camp. Poured reddish brown with a tall puffy head. A little taste of alcohol compliments a slightly sweet taste and a nice malty finish. Very good Scottish Ale"
""
""

""
""
""
""

"Pretty drinkable scotch ale with some nice flavor.  The sweet potato adds a hint of uniqueness although you probably wouldn't detect it if you weren't looking for it.  All in all, a decent brew and worth trying if you can get your hands on it."

"Pours a rusty brown with a medium off white head. Aroma is of grains, light fruity notes, yeast and malt. Taste is similar to aroma with a grainy slightly rustic cooked vegetable flavor with mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. Finish is sweet malt, fruity with a rustic grains barley flavor and some bitterness for balance. Upfront flavor is more rustic herbal vegetable, on the back more sweet fruity mild Scottish tinge. Overall interesting not my favorite of the Sierra beer camp rotation.but still good brew."

"O-SN really missed the mark on this mix pack.  Almost to the point where another mess up they are off my list of ""I'll buy everything they make just because"""

"enough complexity to provide interest. definitely a unique idea of something that I would have said is super weird to start with."
""
"The beer pours a bubbly slightly tannish head that dissipates very quickly. The beer itself is a clear and brown copper. The beer smell has strong sweet and caramel notes with a bit of the sweet potato. The sweet potato is fairly distinct from the other notes. The hops are barely noticeable but give off a floral aroma. The taste has the same notes but at different strengths. The hops are slightly stronger and the sweet potato is more noticeable and stands apart from the rest of the beer. The malt and caramel notes are not as strong as they were in the smell and are covered by the sweet potato. The change is not bad but could have been better incorporated even though it still works. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy bodied and thick but light enough to be smooth with the biting carbonation. Overall, a decent beer and okay."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a very good blend of flavors, and very little actual sweet potato, way too sweet and candy like, the weird bitterness doesn't go well with the sweet candy, not very enjoyable. Another poorly done Beer Camp beer. 3.25"
""
""
""
""
""
"Light starchy malt on the nose with some floral hop notes. Some lemon and tea leaf malt in the back. Very smooth flavor but I don't get a lot if sweet potato. There is an earthy gourd like flavor but I struggle to find it. Instead it's just a nice smooth malt like barley grain, tea leaf and burnt toast. Some fruity hops, lemon I think, along with a bit of pine compliment the malt. Not an overly complex brew this has a lot of great flavor to make it stand up against the rest of the 12."
"Bottle from a mix pack from Tipples. Pours deep orange then settles as dark amber with a two finger off white head with some orange hue. Aroma of sweet malts and SN characteristic yeast, sweet caramel, breadiness. Flavor is sweet caramel malts, some other interestingly sweet notes that I assume comes from the sweet potatoes, the same characteristic yeast or water or something that I get from every SN beer, black cherries, bitter straw to balance. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, slightly resinous with a dry finish. This was interesting, sort of like a light bodied old ale. Lots of flavor very dominated by the malts. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is dark amber in color w/ an off-white head. An aroma of sweet, roasty maltiness mixes well w/ the campfire. Flavor comes off slightly nutty & sweet. It also has a breadiness in the mouthfeel that finishes like caramel. Not super in your face like other Scottish/Irish Ales."
""
""
"Overall (4.0): I think this beer is better than the sum of its parts. The appearance is almost on the next level, the smell is very solid but not outstanding, and the flavor is absolutely on par and hitting all the right notes, but nothing in particular sets it apart. That said, it all comes together to make an exceptionally well-integrated beer for the style, smoothly incorporating the sweet potato (which I’m guessing is actually just a yam, but that’s another conversation entirely and immaterial to the subject at hand). Very good stuff."
"Overall I don't get much from the sweet potatoes but I wonder if the abundance of sugars in them might have boosted the alcohol without any buffer. I don't want to say it is alcoholic but for 7% it does have a bit of a harsh edge when this combines with the somewhat medicinal fruit flavors (which grow with each sip). I appreciate the malt flavors here and they are the best part of the beer (along with the aroma) to me but it just doesn't end up sitting well on the palate towards the end."
"Mouthfeel is clean and pleasant with light flavor and carbonation upfront and some light linger sweetness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I really enjoyed this beer but perhaps it is because I also really enjoy sweet potatoes; one of the more creative and interesting beers in the box"
"D:  Not the best Scotch I have had but a solid offering in the Camp pack.  I like how the sweet potatoes are perceptible yet still in balance with the base brew.  I think a Scotch style Ale was a good choice to deliver some nice malty sugars with those starchy taters."

"O:  not bad, has some unique elements that make it interesting."
""
""
""

"Clear dark garnet pour with a small tan head. Really nice light nice malt aroma. Flavor is mildly sweet with light caramel and spices upfront. There's also a bit of pine, a little alcohol warmth and just a hint of sweet potato. Finishes with a flavor that has earthy hops and light roasted malt. A little different but good."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber with a 2 finger tan head that lingers. It laces the glass nicely and legs run quickly down the sides of the glass. Its very sweet smelling. I get a decent amount of caramel, toffee, and what I think is sweet potato at the very end. I wouldn't know what that smell was if they didn't advertise it. Pretty typical for a scotch ale but a bit subdued. The flavor is very mild and not nearly as sweet as I expected from the nose. I get some toasty notes at the finish that are preceded some mild fruityness and toffee. I don't think the sweet potato comes through at all. The finish is fairly dry with a low bitterness. Medium body with a low carbonation. Overall, I am not a fan of the style and I think the use of the sweet potato was a general miss."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes sweet without being cloying, with that smack of caramel and a touch of pine. There’s some green, piney, sticky hops contrasting with the sweetness, and it all works well. This was my first of the Beer Camp beers. Off to a great start!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste and Mouth feel - Very dry and starchy. A bit of a honey taste with an odd root beer note at times. Plum notes. Easy to drink for the 7% ABV. Overall not a bad beer but not one I'd look for in a six pack."

"O) I'd say of all the collaborative efforts in this years camp, I was probably most leery of this offering. It was actually quite enjoyable. Glad to have tried it."
""
"Overall it is good, not a big fan of Scottish ale but this twist on it was g oodm."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a ton going on, beer was solid but not what I expect from a Scotch Ale. Didn't have a ton of malt to it"
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep caramel color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of toffee is well-balanced against the sweet potato notes with light spices notes. Taste is also dominated by sweet potato notes with some semi-sweet caramel malt notes with light spices also noticeable. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well balanced mix between sweet potato, light spices and a scotch ale."
""
""
""
"As for the potatoes, I absolutely would not have tasted them had the beer's name and label not prompted me to.  The very back end has some complexity to it that kind of tastes like yams, I guess, although I'm probably just projecting that flavor onto it."
""
"Overall, not bad and by far not the worst sweet potato beer I have had."
"Overall: Decent beer overall. I don't get any sweet potato notes from the the aroma or flavor which was a little disappointing. It's worth trying, but there are definitely better beers available in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly light and easy drinking, bunt kind of lackluster for the style."
""
""
""
""
"Carbonation seemed a bit too high when fresh but was just right a few months later."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp from start tot finish and a hearty aftertaste. Easy to drink beer."
""
""
"Overall, this ale has character, a pleasant enough taste, and a good story.  The Asheville Brewers Alliance and Sierra Nevada are pushing the envelope here, and it works!"
""
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass with a 1"" of light khaki head that left a solid lacing.  Beer is a mahogany brown, very good looking!  Toasty sweet malty smell with a alcohol hint.  For a scotch ale it had a good slight hop taste but lacking the scotch ale taste for the most part.  Taste like a mix between a pale ale and a Scottish ale.  Has a carmel malty taste and once it starts warming up I start tasting the sweet potato.  Fairly smooth creamy beer with the perfect amount of light carbonation. I think it's a pretty good tasty beer but just wish it had more of the Scottish ale taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer.  Personally I would prefer more kettle caramelization.  The sweetness would have done well with the earthy sweet potato.  (3.8)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tater Ridge delivers as promised.  Smooth malty goodness with a nice crisp start with the ""Taters"" coming in a close second and yes it is sweet.  There's no doubt that this is a Scotish Ale.  This beer along with the others in this year's camp offering hits the mark on the collaborative effort - I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark, hazy reddish color with a finger with foamy head.  Head retention is good.  Lacing is mild.  The aroma was good at first pour but was hard to decipher after starting to drink.  There was a mildly boozy, sweet aroma.  Some caramel.  Possible sweet potato.  Smooth caramel malty taste with sweet potato at the end and aftertaste, mild bitterness.  The beer is actually tasty.  I just wish there was a little more of a hop bitterness to it.  Not very strong for a scottish ale either."

"This is a pretty good beer; definitely a solid malt-forward entry. It's sweet, but not overly so, and balances the flavors nicely in an approachable package. I'd definitely order this at a bar if it were available."

"Overall a nice, rich beer. Unbroken record of good brews so far in the Beer Camp Across America pack."

"Taste is rich and sweet, again with elements of earthiness, and a pleasing hint of bitterness. I didn't detect much of the sweet potatoes used in the mash here, but this one was still an easy-drinking 7% ABV, and one I enjoyed with no problems whatsoever."
"Iced tea, mahogany brown body topped by a creamy tan head with sticky lacing and excellent head retention. Roasty malt, caramel, toffee and yam aromas and flavors. Malt forward, sweet and rich."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Beer pours a dark amber with ruby red highlights. The coffee colored head is full and rocky leaving thick gobs of lacing. Smells sweet. Some caramel, toffee and maple. More of the same is the taste. Easy drinking smooth mouthfeel. Slightly nutty taste as well. Low level bitterness. Just enough to balance out the sweetness. I can't pick out the sweet potatoes, but I'm sure it's adding to the sweetness.  Nice straightforward ale with no flaws."
""

"O: The sweet potatoes add some nice body to the brew and thicken it up a little. The herbal and floral notes work very well with the light roast and nut/chocolate combo. Definitely a different brew, but a nice change of pace and welcome addition to the 12-pack"
"Poured into a MacAndrew's thistle glass. Pours a dark, hazy mahogany brown with a half finger khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, an earthy, sweet smell that does resemble sweet potato, hints of vanilla and peat. Flavor is interesting earthy malt, mild toasted malt, sweet potato, coffee; finishes with light grassy hops and mild biscuit malt with a faint peat component. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. A rather subdued Scottish ale, with light malt flavors, little smokiness. Redeemed by the interesting sweet potato taste, this would have been kind of boring without that novelty. A pleasant enough mild Scottish ale that could have used some more intense character. One of the beers from the pack I was looking forward to, but it's not my favorite."

"Overall: A pretty decent take on a Scotch ale. Lighter but has some nice toasty malt notes."
""
""
""
""
"Like the sweet potato qualities but I feel the scotch ale portion has more yo be desired. Less hops and more malts would help. I wonder if they mashed too high or used a super attenuative yeast strain."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really great dessert beer that isn't overly sweet or cloying. Really great flavors - I would definitely drink this again if I could!"

"I like this.  I always liked this style.  Sweet caramel overtones with an earthy finish.  Wonderful mouthfeel with the proper dark, ruby colors."
""
""
""

"Again, I'd dial back the carbonation to allow the sweet potato to further accentuate the overall flavor."

"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with ruby hues and a 1/4 inch of head. Moderate amount of lacing. The aroma is earthy with some caramel, booze, peat and bread. Earthy taste as well. Starts with the peat and caramel followed by some warming alcohol. Not getting much of the sweet potatoes but it is a pretty earthy tasting beer so maybe it's in the mix. Ends slightly sweet with a boozey, malty finish. Medium bodied with a bit of a slick mouthfeel. Overall, nothing special but a decent Scottish Ale none the less."

"This is another meh beer. I am not generally a fan of Wee Heavy beers and this one was no letdown in that department. I was hoping for a better beer and because it was a collaboration from my home region I will probably give it more than it deserves, but it was an average beer at best. Truthfully, Old Chub is a better representation of the style and I much prefer the new NITRO version of that over this. It was worth giving a try but it was about as I expected. Not much. I will say that I was not expecting the amount of hop bitterness going on in this beer. Not that it really has any hops in it to speak of, but it was more bitter than I was expecting which gave it more balance than most in the style."

"Overall, a nice enough beer, but not one that would have me rushing out to buy again. As with Chico King, I'm afraid this one might be the victim of high expectations on my part. At least this time, the expectations came from my own fondness for sweet potato and Scottish ales rather than a boastful label."
""
"From the 12 oz bottle as part of the 2014 Beer Camp box, purchased at Liticker's Liquor in Ocean Beach. This is about my favorite of the over-hopped litter."

"O - This was very easy drinking for a Scottish ale. I expecting a sweeter less hoppy flavor, but good nonetheless."

""
""

""
"The body was much thinner than I like in the style, and finished semi-dry. Drinkability was OK, the beer went down easily enough, but wasn't particularly notable. Overall, a pleasant enough brew, but 1 was certainly enough for me. YMMV."
""
""
"Medium-dry to close, the beer's sweetness and rich textures are persistent and the beer squimishly develops the complex dryness of authentic versions. Its light warmth is accompanied by mild evergreen and rye bite in a long-lasting finish."
""
""
""
""
"A tasty, easy drinking Scotch ale."
""
""
"O: More hopped up and less sweet than I was expecting, but pretty good nonetheless. Interesting use of sweet potato. I liked that aspect of the flavor."

"Overall - Boring beer, Nothing special, complex or unique. Right on par for a brown ale."
""
""
""
""

"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Asheville Breweng Alliance. Pours a clear dark amber color with ample head. Has that brown sugar nose, with a hint of a vegetal component, I'm guessing that is the sweet potatoes coming through. Really smooth scotch ale, dark and malty with that nice balanced sweet potato coming through. This isn't a Belhaven Scotch Ale but its a pretty good representation of the style, a little lighter than expected though. Overall, it's quite drinkable with no real off flavors, another win for Beer Camp."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've had Scotch ales but (apparently) never a Scottish ale - compared to those this was lighter in feel, drier, milder, more subdued and low-key - the feel and weight were not unlike some English ales I've had, but with a woodsier, earthier flavor profile; a good drink but not typical of what I return to."
""
""
"o: ya know what….i was expecting more. there not much depth of flavor in here, and it seems a little light. there is a bitterness in here that i'm not really digging either - i think that plays a part in the harshness i was speaking of. probably one of my least favorite from the Camp"
"I really enjoyed this one! I don't usually try too may Scottish ales, but I can tell that Tater Ridge has a lot of originality to it. It smells sweet with notes of mocha, hazelnut, and bread. Its not a potent aroma, more subtle and I really like that about it. The taste fully lives up to its aroma as well. It is rich with hazelnut, fig, dark chocolate, and a wonderful sweetness that brightens it up and ties it all together. I would definitely buy this in a six pack when it starts getting cold outside!"
"O - not a bad beer, but I'm also not digging it at all. I don't think the sweet potatoes were a good idea. This is the first one I didn't like in the Beer Camp Across America box."

"O: I thought this was a pretty enjoyable brew, it had a lot of similar flavors to other Scottish Ales but has some notes of a Happoshu due to the fairly moderate amount of sweet potato presence in the flavor/aroma. I would grab this one again. Easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden."

"O: The sweet potatoes make this beer unique, but it doesn't taste much compared to other Scottish Ales, and seems like it could have been maltier."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 6/4/2014. Pours lightly cloudy deep ruby/brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, raisin, brown bread, herbal, grass, light roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light roast, light nuttiness, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and unique scottish ale. Good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"The Verdict: I like it. I’m not a yam eater, but I approached this with an open mind and was pleasantly surprised by how well it came out. This is by far the best sweet potato brew I’ve ever had (it’s also the only sweet potato brew I’ve ever had). Very smooth Scottish Ale with a unique twist."
""
""
""

""

"O- This could be a nice sweet potato scotch ale if it weren't so damn hopped up."
"O: A touch sweet & simple. I would prefer a bit more dry malt and a kiss of hops"

"Overall it is enjoyable, but it just does not remind me of a Scottish ale and is really missing the toasty and caramel notes I associate with this style."

"Overall: Good beer. I don't get sweet potato but I like the overall profile of the beer. Somewhere between american porter and hoppy amber ale."

"Bitter and malty with a light piney hop presence. It's a little bit astringent which detracts some. Vague dried currant, dry wood, maple. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall a little bit lacking, the sweet potato doesn't really come through and the astringency isn't a positive either. Despite it's flaws I still finished it, no problem."
"O-Not my style. Flavor is better than the aroma, which is always a good thing. A beer brewed for a specific consumer; not me."

"O: A very American take on a Scottish ale. The more heavy-handed use of hops (for the style) is welcome, as it would've gone cloying without it. As it stands it still toes that line. The sweet potatoes would have almost certainly been overlooked were it not for knowing they were there. The sweet and earthy flavors blend right in with the base beer."
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this. It's not the Scottish Ale flavor I expected. It's got a characteristic Sierra Nevada malt profile (that I quite like) with a twist of some cherry and spice that works. Don't expect much sweet potato though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a very characterful brew. The sweet potato shows up in aroma, but not flavor."
""
"O- An enjoyable brew, and another solid but somewhat less then stellar beer in the beer camp series. And now I am off to find me some sweet taters!"

"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer was a crystal clear, ruby-blood coloring with a dense, frothy, clingy, cream colored head. Nose of rich caramel, earthy notes, and subtle floral highlights. Favors are earthy and sweet forward, with scotch notes, caramel candy, sugar, thistle, and subtle bitter characteristics. Smooth and mid-bodied, with a tangy, richly sweet aftertaste. Smooth finish. This beer was a nice drinker, with very decent flavors coming off of those sweet potatoes."

"Sweet potatoes in this style is, all in all, pretty genius stuff. A great intro for me into the Beer Camp Across America series."

"My fourth brew today from the Beer Camp 12 pack. The color is amazing, dark plum. I took a picture of it and sent it round to my friends. It smells like a Belgian, super sweet with some dark fruit notes... but it lacks the malt backbone required for the style. It tastes interesting, again - like it wants to be a Belgian. I don't get sweet potato from it, but I do get sweet, like cotton candy sweet. Still, there's a lot here to be admired and I'll freely admit to an afternoon of drinking. If you get a chance, definitely try this. I'll review it again my second time round... picking up a second box tomorrow."
""
""
"O) It's good, but nothing special. If you like this style, Founder's Dirty Bastard is the way to go."
"O. I find this to be a very good Scotch Ale. It's a little lighter than some, with far less stone fruit qualities and overall heft than most. But it has an excellent toasted grain quality that is at once savory and refreshing. A hearty and enjoyable experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a dash of sweet malts bit the hop bitterness expresses itself like a waterfall crashing into the river below. Almost syrupy. I have a few more of these Beer Camps to go through but regretfully this is my least favorite of an otherwise impressive set."

""

"It's okay, nothing really stands out in this beer"

"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a dull mahogany with a slight haze to the clarity. Head is off-white and sudsy and 1/8th of an inch in height. Nose is very hard to detect - perhaps dark fruit and an earthy and/or medicinal quality. Taste follows nose - dark fruit is muted and flavor profile is dominated by pale malts. There's also a slight herbal/medicinal bittering towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even, consistent carbonation. Overall - style consistent, but flavors are fairly dull."

"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice but light, the brew smells like caramel/bready malt and sweet potatoes. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some toffee, nuts, earthiness and some light piney hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. Overall I think it's an OK brew."

"A good baseline for the style, especially the American version. I expect this to be a trend."
"i am surprised to see this rated as poorly as it is on here, i think its one of the more inventive and well executed beers in the box. maybe the only memorable one for me so far (just a few bottles left to try). nice yammy color really, orange glowing and clear, short of a brown ale, but moving toward that hue. head is bubbly and off white, and it sticks around. smell and taste are similar. big earthy sweetness at first, i really do get the potato, with some honey or candy in there too, it reminds me of the marshmallow sweet potatoes on thanksgiving, has that feel. hints of roast from the malt, but its too clean and light to fall into a brown ale category real neatly. i dig the finish too, earthy again, really different, with a unique sweetness, more molasses this time. well integrated flavors in this one, and just a really creative beer. not starchy at all in feel, quite tidy really, and clean for the sugars in here. bubbles are dialed right in, and while the body may be just a little thin for a real fall ready brew, i like this a lot in that context, and would love to see it make a return for the season. highlight of the box for me so far maybe."

"I think it's a lovely brew and could drink this all fall/winter long."
""
"O- Many of the beers in this 12-pack have suffered from a slightly excessive amount of alcohol presence and, while this one is no different, it's more manageable than others. Either way, it's tasty and worthy of representing Asheville beer."

"This poured out a dark ruby-amber color with a substantial 3/4ths inch head that shows no signs of fading away. Aroma is a bit lacking, with some light sweet malt--very light. On first taste, there's more bitterness than I expected, but it doesn't get in the way of the essential maltiness, which gives medium caramel notes. There's really not much else here, and the finish is rather dry. Not very to-style. I don't know what the sweet potatoes contribute, but I can't taste any at all. It does have a nice creamy body, but otherwise, this is just a good-looking, pretty generic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thick rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, earth, and slight citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, earth, toast, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has earthy qualities, but I am not getting anything that I could consider sweet potato like."

""

""
""
"O- An interesting take on a Scottish Ale, but overall it fell a little too far on the sweet side for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a pretty good Scottish ale. I can't say as I can identify the sweet potato elements readily, but it's still a good beer."

"I probably would enjoy this beer more in the winter, and not when it's 90 degrees outside."

"Overall: Fairly sweet but tasty, and certainly within my expectations for a solid Scotch Ale."

"Pours into my Isle of Arran glass a deep rich amber with a full one and a half finger off white head that slowly settles into a frothy mass leaving broken chunks of lace as it does.Some spiced sweet potatoes show thru in the nose along with some brown sugar and malty cakiness.Not overly sweet on the palate with sweet potatoes being quite noticeable in the back end,pretty rich in maltiness.I think I like this a little more than most,it has subtle nuances that I catch,a good beer."
""
""
""
"Malty with no real sweet potato coming through. I do taste some additional spices. It's tasty, anyway."
""
""
""

"Overall - Nice brew, and it fits well within the scotch style. That said, it probably won't knock anyone's socks off."

"Bottle from the 2014 SIerra Nevada Beer Camp Across America. Light carmel color. Malt foward with a buttery body and overall sweetness. Extremely smooth, the sweet potatoe taste is in the background and just adds a slight sweetness and creamy taste. Overall a great beer, one of the best in the packs."

"Pours out a caramel brown with a thin khaki head. Smells of dark malts, caramel, and dried fruits. Tastes of big caramel malts, some toastiness, fruity esters, firm bitterness in the finish. Starts off sweet, but finishes not too cloying. Moderate body and carb in the mouth. Solid Scottish ale. Don't pick up sweet potato, but I like it."

"The aftertaste is strong and satisfying. I am so looking forward to the beer camps (this is my first of this year's batch) - I picked up two 12's."

"Overall 4.0: Great beer and certainly one of the best so far from the 12 pack. They nailed the style, but more importantly, they produced a beer that is outstanding and well worth a try. Maybe a little goofy, but those darned 'taters contributed positively to the taste of the brew. I recommend this brew!"
""
"I enjoyed this quite a bit. Glad I have a few more to sip."

"Wow. A very interesting take on a Scottish Ale made with Sweet Potatoes from North Carolina. the appearance was dark brown with a bit of a haze and a tan foam that left nice trails down the glass. The smell was sweet but mostly malt. The taste was similar in that there was a lot of amazing malt flavors, but you could still get hints of the sweet potatoes on the end. Reminded me of Thanksgiving. Also the mouthfeel was full, but not overly thick. Really enjoyed this one and made me excited for the next eleven out of this years beer camp."

"Translucent brown pour with a ruby cast. A skien of khaki foam. Smells sweet and malty. Taste is malty, lightly sweet, almost cola like. A very light washing of bitter keeps sweetness from being cloying. I suppose there is a shadow of yams in here at least I think I'm getting something. Body is medium light. Mildly carbonated. This is an average Scottish ale..maybe with sweet potatoes but I can't be sure. Decent."

"Overall, this is a nice Scotch Ale, but the sweet potatoes are barely noticeable."

""

""

"O- Overall, one of the best brown/Scottish ales I've ever had (which isn't really saying much). The beer is akin to a highly refined Newcastle or Honey Brown that isn't overpoweringly sweet and packs a respectable amount of ABV in the punch. If your expecting a delicious sweet potato beer, you will be disappointed. If you are of the rare few that love Scottish Ales, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one."

"Overall- Above average to good beer. A survey of the ratings have shown this to be the lowest among the Beer Camp 12. That is a very good sign for the rest of the beers in the box. An okay representation of the style. I would probably classify this is a fruit/vegetable beer rather than a Scottish ale."
