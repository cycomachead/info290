3.87,1,4,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,"Dark brown, almost black.  Tan head, leaves generous lacing.  I never like the aroma of Scottish styled ales, but like all others, there is a strong malty...butterscotch-like scent.  The flavor is malty, caramel and butterscotch-like as well.  The carbonation is light and the body is heavy.  I like these attributes in stronger beers.  Enjoyable.  I'm not a huge fan of Scottish ales (except Founders' Dirty Bastard) but this is not bad.  I only wish it had a little more strength than 7.5% ABV.","HawbakerBrewery","Mar 21, 2015"

The aroma is mildly toffee-ish with a wisp of molasses. The texture is airly robust even for a Scottish ale. A sip can be a mouthful. The overall taste has both the sweet & bitter of burnt sugar with a solid malty background. In a word substantial. I had to look twice when I saw a mere 5.2% as the ABV. It has all the character of the bigger bolder choices out there. Pretty unique, in a good way.","seedyone","Nov 11, 2014"

4.41,15.1,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, perfume, and peat. The taste is a nice malty balance of toffee, caramel, and hints of peaty perfume. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the better Scottish Ales I've tasted. I can see myself drinking this beer regularly.","KarlHungus","Feb 03, 2012"

3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D - A solidly executed Scottish Ale - I had no problem finishing a 12oz bottle on my own and I'd gladly drink another. Love the affordable Wisconsin price point too. Probably not a big enough beer to benefit from barrel-aging though.","MasterSki","Jan 28, 2012"
3.84,0.3,3,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall: Nice smooth scottish ale with almost a belgian dark ale twist on the front end of the beer. Enjoyable and a great offering!","4DAloveofSTOUT","Jan 28, 2012"

I think this would be a nice candidate for CW barrel aging program. Could be a Backwoods Bastard type beer? I'll keep my fingers crossed.","jera1350","Jan 12, 2012"
4.42,15.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"An excellent Scottish ale from one of new favorite breweries. It pours nice and black with a little head and a little lacing. The smell and taste are both rich and smoky, with chocolate and peat notes. An excellent sipper for a cold nice. Almost taste like a stout or extra rich porter.","sacrelicio","Jan 11, 2012"
4.41,15.1,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"o 4.5+ not always in the mood for a scottish ale, granted, but what a fine example this is. i might turn up the hops and peat the slightest fraction of a degree, and add some chew, but then perfection would be the result.","brewmudgeon","Jan 09, 2012"
3.62,-5.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O - Another terrific offering from this sleeper 'Sconnie brewery. I'm a confirmed hophead but thought I'd try a Scotch Ale on a chilly Wisconsin night, and I'm glad I did. This is one big sweet malty complex beverage and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you, Central Waters and Slainte to you!","joefeidt","Jan 06, 2012"
3.83,0,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer had a nice dark pour and the bitter, slightly sour taste that I expected (and like) from a Scotch Ale. There was also a subtle sweet aftertaste that I enjoyed. This one seemed to lack a little bit of the kick that I like from the Lake Louie offerings so hopefully my score reflects that I like this beer but not as much as it's competitor.","mjpolzin","Jan 01, 2012"
4.42,15.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: For a much-debated style, it's pretty good. A maltier, boozier bitter, it scratches the itch, and is a very, very drinkable beer for a very, very agreeable price.","wschmit","Beers"
3.58,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O) Admittedly, Scottish Ales are not one of my favorite styles, but I tend to enjoy most Central Waters offerings. Having said all of that, I still found this to be just okay. I would not likely seek this one out again.","RoamingGnome","0"
3.96,3.4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Velvety smooth feel, wisps of peat smoke, and woody bitterness in the aftertaste, with some light malt sweetness up front. Some fruity yeast lends indistinct grape or currant notes. Finishes fairly dry and woody, not too sweet overall. Really enjoyable stuff, will look for more while it's in season.","emerge077","Dec 21, 2011"
4.36,13.8,5,4,4.5,4,4.5," ~ This is another fine addition to an already proven line-up of brews offered by the crew at CW. This is one I hope they keep putting up on the shelves here in Central Wisconsin.","cdkrenz","Dec 18, 2011"

4.13,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall, I was surprised by how much scotch ale type flavor this beer has. With the low alcohol I expected a much lighter beer but this has tons of flavor. It could use a bit more hop flavor but it's such a small issue. This is a sessionable beer with a huge amount of flavor, I'm a huge fan. I'm hoping Central Waters decides to turn this up a couple notches and make a full on scotch ale, maybe even something bourbon barrel aged.","adman08","Beers"
3.96,3.4,4,3,4.5,4,4,"overall: a pretty good beer by central waters. ive never seen this one before, but its definitely worth a try. its got more flavor than most scottish ales ive had before, and its more smooth as well.","mobius387","0"
