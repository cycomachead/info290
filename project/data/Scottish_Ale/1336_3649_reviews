"Scottish 80 - I like this already. Deep garnet orange in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a light beige foam with medium low retention. Rich, strong malty aroma with toasted and bready malts and light caramel notes beneath. No hop, esters, or alcohol notes. Heavier than medium in body with a slightly viscous feel. Medium drying carbonation through the middle that restrains the maltiness a bit. Light hop bitterness through the middle with no hop flavors. No esters. Surprisingly dry finish considering the balance tips heavily toward the malty side. Overall this is dead on for the style. Easy drinking and incredibly malty. "
"On tap at Appalachian in Lititz, PA.  Pours a deep amber-red, a really pretty beer. Tan head goes away quickly.  A lot of malt, plus some coffee and a slightly bitter finish.  Medium carbonation.  Quite smooth."
""
"Once again, this one brought back from Nashville. Pours a clear brown color. Flavor is sweet malt. Caramel and some chocolate aromas. Light body and a little thin in the flavor. Missing some of the typical scottish ale characteristics."

"An average Scotch if that.  Not outright bad, but boring and falls short of the better Scotch ales.  Wouldn't turn my nose up at it, but ABC has better offerings."

"O: Wow, this went downhill fast. Started off tolerable and really just nose dived into unpleasant off-scents and off-flavors. I'm not dumping it or anything - let's be real - but not a whole lot of redeeming factors. The one I had directly from the bottle seemed better."

"Overall, a simple and serviceable scottish ale. A good beer for people who love malt flavors, although I usually prefer their stronger scotch brethren."

"O-pleasant scotch ale with easy drinkability at this low ABV"
""
""
"Pour's tall and fades fast. Drink's smooth for ghost's of the past. The soft bready malt's provide hint's of butterscotch and caramel. It's an easy tea bitterness taht settles in after the malty smoothness. It's light and refreshing for those with a sweet tooth. Easy to get and well worth seeking out."

"Poured deep cola brown with some amber/mahogany hues in the light. Mild beige head that lasted a while and left trails of lace. Smell is of sweet caramel and crystal malts, touch of toast, and a bit of smokiness. Bready caramel opens up the palate to notes of raisin, malts, and a grassy bitterness in the finish. A light leathery smokiness is apparent in the aftertaste. Lower carbonation is working well for this beer, but somehow the finish is dry, not sweet like I usually expect. No big deal though. A decent Scottish ale worth seeking out if you want a better example of the style."

"o: A very pleasant surprise."
""
""
"Reddish mahogany pour, dark but translucent, with a couple of stray bubbles on top, but otherwise no real head to speak of. Pretty typical for the style. Aroma is distant but expectedly sweet and malt-driven. Taste is a bit bland, but sweet and malty, slightly woody, caramel and brown sugar with a touch of dark fruit and phenol. Medium body, fairly smooth and drinkable, with a much tamer ABV than your typical Scottish ale, which is not necessarily a good thing, but I suppose it appeals more to the masses. Not bad, but nothing I'd get again."

"Out, out, brief head! I had a finger of light-tan head initially and then I took a short break (ahem!) and when I returned, it was wisps. Color was a deep reddish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was sweet, rich and even a little hot. Mouthfeel was approaching full, slightly viscous and as expected, it was a malt bomb on the tongue. Phew! It seemed bigger than the reported ABV. Finish was likewise very sweet. It was a fine beer for the style but just not my cup of tea."
"Overall – Nothing too special here. It has a decent lightly roasted flavor, but is somewhat boring; nothing to really go out of the way for"
""
"Mouthfeel is solid at medium carbonation and a moderately big body. Some residual sweetness after the finish is nice. Not bad overall, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"O: Nice scottish ale, all of the usual characteristics are here and are well balanced. Would like to try this on tap."

"Overall - This was very average and easily forgetable. Drinkable but boring."

"Overall: Not a bad scotch ale not sure if I will be seeking this one out again however"
"O- just not a very good beer. Will not drink again"
"Out of a chilled bottle the beer was a clear amber color with lots and lots of rising carbonation. The khaki colored head retained well and left spots of lacing down to the end. The aroma was of slightly toasted malt, nuts, a little earth and bread along with a slightly musty note. The flavors were nice, a blend of sweet malt, citrus, apricot, a touch of figs and a caramel malt finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation frothy. Very easy to drink and quite pleasant though not as assertive as many beers of the same ilk."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is on the lighter side of the Scottish Red Ale style. Not as smooth as a Killians per say. Reminded me more of a Lager with red coloring with a hint of smoked malt. Definitely a beer to try. Just a tad more carbonation bite than most Red Scot Ales."
""
""
""
"D: This was a decent Scottish ale, but not in the top tier. The scent and taste were good not great. The body was great and it was easy to drink. Not bad but not memorable."

"O: This is nothing too spectacular, but a good beer nonetheless. I probably wouldn't purchase this, but I sure as hell would drink it if someone was giving it to me (which is what happened in this case.)"

"I remember this being a lot better. Maybe my palate has changed completely. This is a average brew at best. Try their Batch 666 even though it's considered their Winter Warmer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and caramel. Taste is also malty, some caramel, a bit on the sweet side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer."
"This poured out as a nice deep amber color with a tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer had a healthy amount of malts and grains on the nose. The taste of the beer was slightly sweet with a nice earthy tone in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer was decent, nothing too out of the ordinary here. Overall this beer was pretty good I thought."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice amber color body with very little head, that doesn't stay around long. The smell is sweet and carmely. The taste starts off sweet, then the hops and malt comes through on the middle and back of the tongue. Very nice mouth feel and Overall a good and drinkable beer."
"Smooth and slight sweet flavor of the malt and oatmeal. Amber to dark amber in color with a hint of red. Nice to the nose and very good to the tonge. Over all we found this beer to be eveything it was advertised to be. Worth having again, would go well with shepards pie or a spicy dog."
"O: This is one of the better beers that I have found in the Scottish style of beer, it is better then the samuel adams variety"
"Overall, not bad but not my favorite interpretation of the style."
"Pours a clean mahogany color with small spots of off-white head, some sticky lacing. Scent is of caramelized malts with a splash of roastyness, light fruitiness and earthy hops. Taste follows scent, the caramel notes are clean and not overly sweet, roastyness helps cut through that. Lightly holy and fruity on the back end. Medium bodied, lightly sticky. A nice Scotch ale, not overly sweet or sticky, quite clean overall increasing drinkability."
"Pours a deep red color. Aroma of caramel, toffee, light peat and bread. In the flavor, nice roasted flavor, burnt sugars, flash of herbal hop for balance. Tastes like a standard Scottish Ale, malty, sugary but not overdone. A well crafted, quite decent brew. Like most Appalachian offerings, this one is easily drank."
"Quite drinkable example of the lighter version of what I still call Scotch Ale. Would be a good quaff on tap."
"o - Overall a decent scotch ale. The body was a like too thing, but it had a nice nose. Worth checking out if you like the style."
"A good drinking beer."
"O - Ehh, no thanks. Boring, forgettable example of the style with a mouth-feel that kills it."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is caramel malts.Taste is caramel,biscuit with a hint of sweetness.Pretty smooth goes down relatively well.It would work well on a hot or cold day.I would recommend and most likely purchase this again."
"S"
"Drank well with a MonteCristo sandwich. (dash of powder sugar on top no dipping jelly or syrup)"
"D: a good beer but the mouth feel distracts from the taste a little bit and once again being so exclusive to the pubs cuts from the overall drink ability."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Nice, clear oily lacing, not too sticky slides on the glass. Aroma is of sweet caramel malts, some phenol alcohol and some brown sugar. Taste is sweet and caramel-like, with some pitted dark fruits. No alcohol noted in the taste, easy to drink, quite tasty actually, pleasantly surprising."
"Poured into my Appalachian Brewing pint. Medium copper color and one finger head looked beautiful in the glass. Not much lacing but still OK. Smell was sweet malt and true to style. Pretty nice flavor for a PA produced Scottish Ale. Mouthfeel was medium thick and minimally carbonated."
"This is a pretty decent example of the lighter Scottish Ale. The sweet malt character comes forward much more as the beer warms giving it a nice amount of traditional flavor and aroma."
"D: BOMC suggest the beer really opens up as it warms and I have to agree. This is especially good as a nice sipping beer at near room temperature."
"This is a good beer, but just good. Nothing to make it stand out as excellent."
"This beer was received at my front door delivered by UPS from the Clubs of America Beer of the Month Club. Poured into a standard pint beer glass and allowed to warm to the appropriate temperature as instructed in the accompanying club newsletter. Beer was dark red in color and exhibited little or no head. Wonderful malty smell and tasted were noted. Mouthfeel was good despite the aforementioned lack of a head. This brew was very drinkable for a Scottish ale. I would recommend it to folks who like this style of beer."
"D - I like this beer. I've only had limited exposure to the authentic 'lighter' Scottish ales, but this one hits the spot nicely, even if it lacks some of the peat-like qualities I like in the Scottish brewery versions. The carbonation is a bit high and that somewhat detracts from it overall."
"Remember the commercial , I'd walk a mile for a Camel? Well I'd walk a mile for a cold brew, but since this one arrived at my door from BOTMC I only had to walk about 10 feet. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the top yields a molasses, honey and caramel smell. Pours to a slightly cloudy dark orange bronze. No head at all, that doesn't seem right. I have more to try and will edit review if there is a change. Taste is brown ale-like with a very dry chaulky hop flavor. Mouthfeel has good carbonation despite the lack of head but it is kind of thin and watery, not much body. Taste is consistent throughout, although the finish is sweeter than the start and middle. A respectable beer but nothing too special."
"Had I not know this was pretty low ABV, I never would have guessed -- even at its moderate level, there's not enough to hide the alcohol. I also would've thought this was a Belgian dark, with the dark fruits & alcohol content, creating a ""muddled"" kind of flavor I find so often in that style. Can't say I'm really impressed, unfortunately."
"D: Not terrible but not really a brew to look far and wide for. Needs an upgrade in the maltload department."
"This is one of the more drinkable Scottish ales I've had and would be a good session beer."
"this is my favorvite scottish ale a good beer from pa . pours a dark copper color , with a big white head,the taste is sharpe and crisp , a great mouthfull and drinkability is excellant i could drink this all night and have , its a winner so go enjoy this beer"
"The flavors in this beer were certainly in-line with the Scottish Ale style - roasted malt, a touch of malting smoke and some sweet caramel and toffee notes. Overall, however, this seemed a bit like ""Scottish Ale Light"" as the body was lighter and the flavor profile more reserved thany the prototypical Scottish Ale. Pleasant, but not memorable."
"1230"
"A surprise gift from a friend led to a pretty good beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A good example of a Scottish Ale. One of ABC's best offerings IMO. I also love their Major Hops Old Ale on cask."
"Overall this is a solid scottish ale and try as I might I still can't get into this style unless it's Americanized with more smokiness. Worth a shot if you like the style."
"Pours a clear, brown/amber color with a lighter tan color along the bottom of the glass. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, yeast, caramel, and slight chocolate. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, yeast, slight sweet malt, slight caramel, hint of dark citrus, and slight grain. Overall, a good body, blend, and aroma."
"It's overall quite solid imo. Would definitely consider more of this as well as more from this company, as like I said I haven't had any others. Kudos."
"Drinkability: While this beer is good to have one, I don't know if I would want another. The flavor is so powerful it took me aback a little bit. If I were to get this again, I could only have one in a given night."
"Poured a clear attractive ruby red with minimal head which receded quickly to nothing, no lacing whatsoever. Earthy smell as expected for a Scottish Ale. Taste is earthy with smoky malt with touch of hops, more fruity than I would have thought. Sweet. Mouthfeel was ok, a little cloying for me. I thought it drank easily, had no trouble drinking several in a sitting. Decent beer, pretty pricey at least where I purchased it so probably won't buy it again."
"Smooth and perfectly carbonated, with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Medium bodied, easy drinker."
"Notes: This Scottich Ale is very close to a dopplebock in taste although it is thinner."
"Reviewed from my notes. This beer has a very dark ruby color. It pours clear, but it is too dark to see though. There was almost no head; what bubbles were present disappeared quickly. Not much of an aroma, just a bit of caramel malt. Interesting mouthfeel; it feels light, but it isn't really that light. Not too much carbonation, but more than the ABC barleywine. I can taste a bit of hop flavor and some caramel up front. There is an interesting flavor in the finish, perhaps raspberry? It is hard to say, but it is vaguely fruity and it lingers after you swallow. Very nice."
"D - A solid all around Scottish Ale... I could drink these easily one after another... However, there is nothing overly memorable that takes this to the upper echelon of Scottish Ales..."
"Looks nice. Ruby hued brown color with a tan head. Nose is basically nothing. Flavor is tangy and malty as is usual when this style is brewed in the U.S. Sweet and edgy, it isn't horrid. But it is no more than a sipper as it might be a bit much for some to deal with."
"Overall a tasty and simple Scottish Ale. It lacks full depth however."
"Not sure if I would seek this one out or not, but I have to admit it is not really that bad."
"Drinkability: This beer is very simple and straightforward. A nice malty sweetness throughout, no bitterness and it's creamy texture make this a very drinkable beer. However, it's lack of complexity does leave me wanting a beer with a bit more oomph."
"D= I found this to be a very enjoyable Scottish ale and would gladly drink a few more if I had easy access to them. Very sessionable!"
"D: A couple of these would definitely go well on a cold, rainy evening. Not a spectacular beer, but solid and enjoyable."
"D- Easy to drink a few of these as they are smooth and go down easy."
"In the end, this was a nice little session quality Scottish Ale from ABC. I thought it could have used more smoke and a few more roasted flavors, but it's fine where it stands. Would I ever drink it again? I'd probably would."
"D - Easy drinking scotch ale, and a nicely done example from ABC. An easy transitional beer for new to craft beer type friends to try out."
"This beer may not land a spot on my top 5 favorite beers list, but it is surprisingly good. I would definitely buy a six-pack of this again."
"Don't drink and review."
"Notes from 10/12/04."
"Pours a chocolate brown with with a small white head that dissipated into the slightest of rings. The aroma is of caramel, buttery malt followed by some wet wood aromas. The taste is of smooth chocolate, caramel, hint of smoke and wet wood. Nice and malty. The feel is thin for a malty brew, has moderate carbonation and finishes slighty chewy and dry. Probably my favorite out of the sampler 12 pack. It has nice malty flavors, though it is a tad thin."
"D- Not bad, I wouldn't turn one down. Its not my favorite style but its good. Its a good alternative beer for people who like red or standard brown ales. I could down a few."
"D: This is a great session ale, smooth with a robust flavor that doesn't push you around."
"Poured a medium brown with a deep red tint, it has a thick fluffy head. The smell is sweet and of malts, butterscotch, and a flowery sent. The taste is smooth and sweet with sweet malts, butterscotch, a slight hoppiness, and a very satisfying after taste."
"D: A nice combination of mouthfeel and taste, but the burnt, earthy taste was a little overbearing later. A nice session beer overall, but I would say that is about it. I would not expect to be pounding these back all night."
"D: Fairly good beer, a smooth drinker but also kind of filling."
"D--Not a bad take on this style. Unique. I think that the next time I am at ABC I will order this. Really one of their better offerings."
"D- i am not sure if i will ever have this beer again unless i do the ABC tour. Its worth a try but not worth the 6-pack buy."
"Pours a nice deep amber, although with very little head and almost no lacing. Decent scent, nothing deep or strong, though, like I'm used to, but a nice malty scent. Very stong malty taste, as well. There really wasn't much in the way of a smoky peatiness, and the malty sweetness was almost too much, but only almost. It was still pretty good, and probably a good way to get someone to try a more smoky scotch or scotch-style ale in the future. It goes down very easily, as well."
"Overall drinkability I'll rate as good considering the taste. It's got a nice flavor and the body is heavy enough to make this a bit harder to drink than the average. I've had 3 at a time, and that was about all my belly could handle. Solid showing."
"D: A nice change from my norm, but if I had this and nothing else I'd get tired of the sweetness before too long."
"Between the sourness and the thinness, this was okay with the meal but nothing I'd seek out again."
"I got this beer a while ago from friend Paul who brought it back from out east. So it's a i bit old. Anyway, it poured a foamy tan head with gold highlights that acted like a soda pop - foamed right up and then down to zero. No lace. Both aroma and flavor are caramel, malty sweet with a hint of alcohol. Body is unremarkable. Finish is same way. Altogether forgettable."
"D: Nice on a cold night, While not a session beer for me I found it to be real nice. I've been drinking this beer for years. It seems to get better as I get older. A keeper"
"Glowing burgandy colored beer with a short cream colored head. Lightly sweet caramel malt in the aroma along with dark fruits and a hint of tea. There is a good amount of dark malt in there with hints of red wine and cherries. There is also an overriding cocoa flavor that, while it does not taste bad, seems very out of place. Mouthfeel is thin and almost watery. Scottish ales are typically quite drinkable, but even so the mouthfeel in this one is a bit lacking. A good beer, but not a good Scottish Ale."
"The drinkability is ok but not on my shortlist to try again. MK"
"Do not expect anything over the top, just an easy to drink well crafted ale. Very well done. An everyday brew. Looking forward to the rest of the 12 pack."
"For me, this beer just didn't do it. Faint aroma, very mild flavors, and thin mouthfeel. In fairness, I did drink a 3F Robert the Bruce prior to this beer, and I really enjoyed it. This beer may have suffered in comparison. However, I have tried 5 different beers by ABC, and none of the others have done much for me either. This is the last for a while."
"Cheers!"
"A good description; it wasn't very hoppy though at all with a smooth malt flavor, a dark color and almost no hop presence. A nice beer to pair with the food though at ABC."
"I'm thinking about picking a six of this up for poker tomorrow night, so of Course I'd drink it again!"
"ABC is a good company that puts out consistantly good beers. I think it is one of the areas best kept secrets."
"Pours a dark amber with a quickly-disappearing head. Smell is of sweet caramel and malt; maybe a little roasted, too. Tastes of smokey malt and some caramel lingers after swallowing...thinner than other Scotch Ales I've had. A good occasional brew, but not as drinkable as I had hoped from the aroma."
"On tap at the ABC Abbey Bar in Harrisburg over the Memorial Day weekend. The beer poured a amber color with a thick white head and slight lacing into a standard pint glass. The nose of the beer gave me some hints of malty sweetness. The taste was a nice mix of caramel tones and malts, very pleasing to the taste buds. The body is medium and easy to drink by my estimation."
"The taste is fairly dry up front, but picks some sweetness through to the finish where it is most apparent. This beer has a bit of a phenolic edge to it that seems like it might be derived from a bit of peat smoked malt. The beer is actually pretty light on the palate, but it is quite rich and flavorful with lots of malt character. Again notes of toffee and caramel are prominent in the flavors, but it is not just this, some light roasted grain notes and some interesting toasted grain notes round out a full suite of malt character that is a bit more complex than I have described."
"Drinkability: not bad, but I felt this leans more towards a red ale than anything else. So-so offering."
"Out of the four beers that came in the sample pack I recieved from Appalachian brewing co, this is undoubtedly the best."
"Pretty thin in the mouth to the point of almost tasting flat. Drinkable, but I certainly didn't order a second pint."
"A nice American scots ale. Looks close to cherry coke with a tight off-white head and quite a bit of lacing. Smelled of carameled malts a ghost of smoke a hint of alcohol and some grassyness in there too. Tasted quite like I thought from the smell, well rounded caramel flaovrs meet with a slight bitterness and a hint of smoke. Decent and flavor full but a tad thin in the body, but pretty drinkable all the same."
"Price - $8 for a six pack; not too bad."
"Served from the tap in a standard pint glass at ABC's Harrisburg location. A deep red, copper color with a nice substantial head. The scent was malty with hints of caramel and sweetness. Flavor was malty and roasted with an almost sourdough bread taste and a slightly smokey element. It finishes with a bitterness which leaves with an aftertaste of the same."
"I picked up a sixtel of this for the home kegerator; the label said it was filled on 6/24/05. The price made this very attractive; it was a good 10-15 dollars less then the other micro sixtels at Exton Beverage. It poured a nice reddish-brown with a 1/2-inch light tan head that reduced to a collar quickly. I didn't get a great deal of aroma, a sweet earthy smell but I had to breathe deep to get it. A bit of sweetness in the beginning, then ended with slight hop bitterness, not much flavor, good for the style. It drinks pretty easy, has a creamy texture with low carbonation, and a dry finish. The price in a sixtel makes this a great buy."
"Another Pennsylvania craft brew I've sampled, thanks to my distant cousin, woodychandler. This 12 oz bottle pours a hazy, cola copper body with a 2 cm, tan head that quickly drops to a cap, with good patchy lace. Lovely Scotch Ale aroma, with toffee and caramel maltiness, and a hint of smoky peat. Mouthfeel is nice, with moderate carbonation and a light medium body. Taste is primarily toffee maltiness, with a dry hop bitterness for good balance. Faint smoky character resembles peat. Not at all chewy, as some have noted. Body thins a bit as it warms, improving drinkability. Even finish with a smoky malt aftertaste and a note of bitter hops. Very good drinkability. Definitely worth a try for fans of the style."
"presented as a deep copper color with modest head. Smell is very light and nothing significant noted. Taste is very light and not what I would expect in this style of beer. Mouthfeel is a slight sweetness, but very restrained. Would be a decent session beer, but not what I expect from a scottish ale"
"Whenever we visit Harrisburg from Atlanta we try to bring back a few bottles as this particular beer is not available here."
"Drank 2 pints and it was enough. Decent for the style, but I remember this one tasting better to me a few years back."
"This brew is a deep ruby color with a frothy brownish-tan head. The aroma has a pleasing toasted grain and malt quality. It has lots of toasted nutty sensations in the aroma, with less of the syrupy malt smells that many Scottish ales present. Very light hop smell (almost an afterthought). Taste is moderately sweet, moderately malty. Caramel and very faint smoky flavors. I expected more sweetness and fullness of flavor, considering the 80 Shilling on the label. Finishes just slightly bitter, wish a fleetingly soapy sensation. Medium body. This brew is pretty good, but not particularly inspiring."
"My overall impression of this beer is that it should be labeled a Marzen. I mean seriously, this one looks, smells, and tastes like one. Weak example of a Scottish Ale."
"Overall-quite an interesting beer, certaintly the most interesting and flavorful beer I've had from Appalachian yet there was something in the taste that just didn't work for me, not sure whether it was the style of beer or this particular one but still, an interesting beer that DEFINITELY warrants a try, give this one a shot."
"Overall - I really enjoy this beer. Scotch/Scottish ales are one of the styles I personally like, but for some reason are not nearly as common as other styles in my area. Glad to see a local brewery producing this."
"When I had it, I was thinking this was a damn weak Wee Heavy, but I didn't realize that this was just a regular everyday Scottish Ale. In that case, it certainly was fantastic, and one I wish to have in the future."
"First sip, average carbonation, with a decently thick body. Flavor is all caramel up front and is all malt overall. I do get a bit of a grainy biscuit flavor on the finish. This brew is very smooth and easy to drink. I will drink this one again!"
"This beer has very little or no head. Has a nice red/tan color and looks nice in the glass. Has a faint smell of malt and little hops. I like the taste. It is a mix of malt and berries with a slight hop aftertaste. The mouth feel is soft, has a little body, but leaves a fresh clean feel. All and all this is a beer I stop for when I am having more then one."
"Drinkability: If anything, you could drink multiple Jolly Scots and not get bogged down. The problem is, I'm not sure you'd really want to. I still like the beer as a whole, but I've had better examples of the style. I'd love it if they tweaked this into a Wee-Heavy and beefed the flavors up."
"This was a very interesting Scottish Ale. I was expecting something a little darker and heavier. It poured a ruby to dark brown color with an off-white head and lots of lacing. The overwhelming aroma is one of maoltiness with a bit of hops underneath and a bit of pepperyness. It is a really flavorful beer with a nice balance of the malt to the hops, which lends just a slight bitterness. There was a hint of carmel as if some of the malt may have been carmelized. It was relatively full-bodied with a nice but not overwhelming carbonation. This one was good from start to finish, which caused me to want another."
"The Jolly Scot is a Scottish ale that is dark brown with a slightly reddish tint to it. This beer has no head at all as well as no aroma about it at all. The malt is kind of mild but hold nice and the hops are just as mild as the malt but all blends well in the end. The Jolly Scot is available year round and it is a tribute to the Irish, Scottish & German immigrant that founded the city of Harrisburg where the Appalachian brewery is located in. over all pretty tasty. ABV 5.32% IBU18.20"
"Good local brewski."
"Slightly hazed ruby/scarlet appearance. Not much of a head on the pour. A thin and slightly bubbly light brown collar encloses the surface of the beer. Nice little subdued sweet maltiness on the nose. Maybe a little herbalness and peat as well. There's a little bit of a harshness on the palate. I'm not sure if it's coming from indgredients (peat malt?) or from a flaw. It's not overwhelming, but not that enjoyable either. Some sweet malty tones are evident as well. And some bitterness, that I'm not assuming would be coming from the hops. Hmmmm. This one's throwing me a little. Nonetheless, it's not one of my favorites."
"Served as part of a sampler tray at their brewery. I remember enjoying this beer from the bottle earlier in the year and the draft version didnt disappoint either. A very light Scotch ale indeed! This version is more hoppy than malty. I think of a malty beer when I think of a Scottish ale, but this tastes just fine. Nice fruitiness in the flavor, too. In itself, this is a very good and easy drinking beer, although I would like to see a ramped up version of this beer. Maybe the Jolly Scots big brother? Or the not so jolly Scot? hmmm...."
"A very well rounded scotch ale. This stuff pours a dark red colour with a small, fizzy head. The aromas are of scotch, alcohol, and heavy malts. The taste is very scotch-like, soothing, warm, and boozy. The mouthfeel is heavy, but not overly heavy and the drinkability is damn good."
"Deep copper body beneath a tan head. Mild, sweet malt aroma with some noticeable fruitiness. The taste is very mild with a somewhat distracting and misplaced bitterness. Malt sweetness pushes through mid-taste. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin for a scottish ale, and the drinkability is OK. It's a decent beer, but not all that notable."
"Cheers to the BA Victory Beer Exchange for the sample!"
"Malts dominate with a rich sweetness. Very nice roastiness character joins for a good balance. Toffee really comes in to add a bit more complexity. The body is medium to full with light carbonation making for a very smooth mouthfeel. It is also a pretty good drinker. A few at a time would be no problem. A very nice scottish ale."
"of caramel malt, buttery toffee, and biscuits. On the palate more of the same with a caramel maltiness, bicuity/ breadiness, light fruitiness, and a little on the sweet side as it warms but still very enjoyable. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth. Nice brew."
"Acquired at the Philly BA Gathering Beer Exchange."
"A creamy ivory head rests lazily atop a deep-amber/copper body. It's crystal clear; and very tiny bubbles rise slowly towards the surface. The head retention is good, and although it drops fairly readily, it does maintain a very nice collar and lacy surface covering throughout the pint. The nose expresses a very clean, lightly sweet and caramelized/caramelish maltiness that's touched ever so lightly by a background roastiness. The body is medium/full and it's quite creamy and smooth in the mouth. Caramelized sugars dominate in the round maltiness; but it's also accentuated by a very light fruitiness, a whisp of hop flavor, a cusp of gently acidity from a touch of dark malt, and a sublime bitterness. This is an exceptionally well-done version of an 80 Shilling Scottish ale, and it might even be too clean to be considered authentic! Great drinkability! I'd love to try this cask conditioned. Well worth trying."
"I was a bit surprised when the barkeep planted my pint of Jolly Scot before me...despite a nice dark, clean red hue, it held a very thin head with practically no noticeable carbonation. There was no apparent lacing, and very little head retention. It looked nice, but kind of flat. The smell was a little more reassuring with a sweet malt and subtle hop hints. The taste held a pleasing maltiness, with a good balance. It was smooth, and full, yet had an almost average overall taste for a Scottish Ale. The Ale was very active in the mouth, with a tingling, prickly sensation. Not too full, decent mouthfeel all around. ABC's Jolly Scot is not a bad Scottish Ale, but I wasn't extremely impressed. I'd gladly down a few of them, but would probably seek out another Scottish Ale if in the mood for the style."
"Deep auburn in color with a fairly thick tannish head. Light carbonation noted as the head subsides. Smoky roasted malts dominate the nose. Really good roasted malt taste to match the aroma with a very slight hop bitterness coming through about mid-glass. Decent lace. Overall pretty well balanced and smooth. Thin mouthfeel but overall pretty drinkable."
"This beer has a dark caramel / nut color as it reflects in the glass.  A surprisingly thick head that seems to last.  It drags down the glass as it leaves its lace.  Beige in color.  It has a sweet malt aroma and a slight sweet malt flavor with hints of flower and hops.  Good beer."
"Enjoy this one, and support these guys if you ever see them. The cashier had to practically vacuum these off before scanning them. Sad fate for such a good beer."
"Yet another solid brew from Appalachian.  This is probably one of my favorites from this Harrisburg staple.  It is nice and dark with a little hoppiness and a slightly sweet aroma.  The head is moderately thick and remains that way for about half the glass until it gets lacey.  A very drinkable bier, this is one to try when you have the opportunity to try the brews from this Pennsylvania brewery."
"Great beer from a quality brewery.  Nut brown in color with a slight hint of redness.  Nice foamy head.  Smell is of sweet flowers for fruit.  Coats the entire mouth, goes down smooth and packs a wollup. Dorn't drink and drive!!"
