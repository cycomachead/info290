Taste is also dominated by caramelized notes with some grainy cereal notes. Body is light with good carbonation. This one is short on complexity and balanced.","Phyl21ca","Jan 03, 2015"

Taste is muted caramel, earth, a tad spice, some citrus. Bright carbonation a medium to light body. This beer is very mild all the way around.

2.7,-20.6,3,3,2.5,2,3,"overall, a poor attempt at the style. maybe brewed with the delicate scandanavian palate in mind? either way, if FBC wants to make an ale of this style, make it more authentic please. this just comes off to me as a pub grub washer downer with a little bit of flavour for good measure.","budgood1","Aug 30, 2012"

2.49,-26.8,4,2.5,2,3.5,2.5,"Overall - Certainly not the best Scotch out there. I'd like to see the sweetness matched with a little peat or roasted flavor and the carbonation toned down a little.","randum32","0"
3.5,2.9,3,3,3.5,4,4,"On tap at JL Beers in Grand Forks, served at adequate temperature into a pint glass. Poured a rich brown, fairly clear and without much action, and therefore not much head or lacing. I've never been able to pick up much aroma in a bar, too much air moving, but some faint grain was distinguishable. Taste was on the lighter side, but for such a low ABV beer it was to be expected... some caramel malt, not all that peaty but some nuttiness perhaps. Mouth was smooth and solid for a lighter beer, went down way too easily and way too fast. If by some miracle I could replace Bud with this beer as the light easy to drink standby, I'd be perfectly happy with that. I like my Scots a bit beefier than this, but for as light a beer as it is it performs fairly well.","objectivemonkey","Dec 29, 2011"

3.41,0.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer arrived a dark mahogany color with a decent cap of foam. The beer was ice cold. Even as it warmed the aroma was difficult to ascertain, but faint grains were lingering. Light and a little carbonated on the palate. The malt flavors mainly consisted of caramel flavors, but was not very strong. I would like to see some more assertive malt character from a Scottish ale. Overall, not a bad attempt at the style.","BeardedBoffin","Beers"
4.17,22.6,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Another great on from Fargo brewing. Had this on tap at JL beers in Fargo. Pours a see through dark brown colors with a nice thick white head that leaves a nice creamy white ring. Smell is of sweet malt caramel and with some nutty smell. The taste is very smooth up front it's malty and carbonated with a very sweet nutty after taste. Well done again keep it up guys!!!","bobbypaulson","0"
