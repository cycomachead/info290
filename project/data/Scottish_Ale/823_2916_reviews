"Pours a nice amber color with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell has a bit of alcohol but underneath is a lot of scents, vanilla and caramel as well as some citrus and smoke to give it a complex smell. The taste was just as layered with the flavors from the malt and the hops as well as some wood on the finish making a very well balanced beer. One of my favorite growlers to pick up when I can."

"Overall another poorly done beer. Under attenuated and left to continue bottle conditioning for way too long. I admit it's probably too old but still doesn't seem well done. I'll def have to try this again."

"Light, slightly citrus, but not watery flavor with the yeastiness I expect fresh beer to have. Goes down easily."

"o: A brewing disaster. Dunno what fouled this but it is nasty. Drain pour city. ""Taste a bit of history"" it says on the bottle label. I love history, but I'll have to pass on this part of it. Nevertheless, will probably risk buying more at some point, since I like Scottish ales and this is supposed to be a good one."

"Clean, light, and drinkable. No hops to speak of. A speck of chocolate malt in there. Nothing groundbreaking, but simple and classy."

"Overall: A nice and sessionable Scotch ale that hits all the right points but is never overbearing. I could have several pints of this. I like Scotch ales and have had several, so this is above average compared to all Scotch Ales, but is still a treat."

"Pours medium dark brown with very little foam. Some light gets through, but not much. Cola/caramel smell. Very faint. Taste is a nutty/caramel blend with medium carbonation. Some hop pokes through at the end. Some vanilla too. Very drinkable, solid flavorful brew."

"O - very solid, easy on the eyes, highly drinkable Scottish ale. good start as my first beer from this brewery."

"Wasn't sure of the style when I tried. I thought it was a solid english amber ale. Worth a try if nothing better around."
"Decent ale and you can tell it is a Scottish Ale."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a muddled amber-brown coloring, very cloudy to the point of being opaque. No head on the pour, but a slight ring of bubbling was present. The beer had a very sweet aroma, with some nut and coffee bitterness. I was preparing for a creamy feel, but surprisingly enough this beer is a bit effervescent and bubbly, while still being on the creamy side. The beer's flavors are toasty, with chocolate and coffee characteristics in the forefront. The beer is like Hershey kisses melted in a cup of coffee. The beer is light, and the aftertaste is chocolate sweet, with a slight lingering finish of burnt characteristics."
"D - An average at best Scottish Ale... I'm not quite sure what it is, but there something on the palette that is bit off about this one that I just can't get by... There aren't many Scottish Ales that I've head that I would recommend or reinvest in, but unfortunately this is one of them..."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a robust head , good retention and excellent lacing. Full bodied mouthfeel. Smooth start to finish. No aftertaste. Excellent drinkability. Will have to look out for this again."
"Beer is thinner than it should be and has a papery / cardboard flavor to it. This might have been a bad fill of this growler. The toffee notes are present, they are a little harsh, the finish has an unpleasant aftertaste. Perhaps something went wrong with this."
"Pours a light copper color with a short light tan head and a spot or two of lacing on the way down. Thin color throughout. The nose brings some light oxiized sherry and cherry character with some caramel and grainy malt. Flavor brings light fruitiness with a lot of grain and light oxidation. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Not a big fan of really anything with this beer, unfortunately."
"O: Goes tremendously well with smoky food right from the grill. This has been my go-to BBQ beer for years now. Looking forward to the bottle of TPA Reserve I bought with this today."
"Not bad at all. One of the best tasting prepackaged growlers I have had. Sealed very well, unlike some I have purchased. Definitely, worth a shot if you find it."
"On tap. Pours a dark semi translucent dark mahogany color with a half inch of head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is boozey, pepppery, bready, and malty. Flavor is malt, boozey with a slight bit of pepper. Some breadiness as well as some caramel. A bit of an overall sourness to this one. This is a solid choice for a drinkable beer which is helpful because I usually only see growlers of it. Overall, its a good local beer. Worth having again."
"I tried this beer on a whim when I saw it at the local liquor store. Very impressed. This beer doesn't look like much, but has a very unique and very nice, powerful taste. The smell is almost off-putting, as it smells very pungent, almost flowery. The taste however, is amazing, strong and smooth. Absolutely worth trying."
"I had this on tap at a bar in Waterbury, it poured a very nice ruby brown with a decent off white head that disappeared quickly. The smell is nice, real caramel malts, a hint of pepper, and a bit of yeasty bready in the background. The taste is more of the same, the caramel malt really stands out, and that is a good thing, there is enough hop in there to just hold the malts in check. The body is nice and creamy with low carbonation, very smooth. Overall a malty treat."
"This is not true to style, but is a very good beer."
"Note: I detect some resemblance to Penny Weiz Ale, perhaps they use the same yeast?"
"D: Nice kick, nice representation of style, not too filling, this is a nice beer to have a few pints for an evening."
"D - It is drinkable, but the style gets kinda tired after one. What is kinda cool is that there are no preservatives in this guy, so if you try one it pretty much has to be fresh. Worth trying but not a ""must find""."
"Medium bodied, good carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. Went well with the wings."
"Just found my notes recently from last summer's Northwest Connecticut Brewfest. Poured dark copper, with a finger of off-white head, good retention, and good lacing. Very pleasant and pronounced blend of coffee, caramel, and cocoa powder in the nose. Tasted of caramel and coffee, dissolving to more maltiness midpalate and finishing on a smoky note. Nicely smooth, not overly carbonated medium body. Very sessionable, and one of my few repeat table visits during the 'fest."
"D- at first I said forget about this. But after talking with other folks later, I think the poor performance was all the fault of the serving method. Got it at Red Robin and the tender put it in a frosted glass. I'm betting that the glass was poorly rinsed and gained a lot of condensation when pulled out of the cooler. I wanted to do a retest before leaving New England but it just wasn't meant to be. So take my review with a grain of salt."
"All in all, I do recommend this beer - if you can get it. As it says on the company's website, it doesn't travel well since it is unfiltered and contains no preservatives. Those of us lucky enough to live close to the brewery (how I wish we could have gone to their festival yesterday that ended in an overnight camping experience!) can enjoy the flavor of this truly wonderful treat."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable ale. I really like the smoky and earthy flavors and the balancing caramel sweetness. Great beer."
"Sweet and earthen and has that perfect balance of complexity and accessibility that mark my favorite beers. Great stuff."
"On tap at flatbread with Larsonstyle. The bartender told me they kicked a hooker tap off because they wanted to put micro brew on... I had seen this one at the brass city brewfest but didn't get the opportunity to try it. No idea what to expect here. Nice dark brown color with some serious head on this beer. Smells grainy and malty. Tasted kinda smokey. Rough at first but I eased into it. It has a very nice mouthfeel, strong but pronounced. I really like how this one goes down. I wanted to try the Dirty penny next but it seemed there was a problem with the keg as the head was unbelievable. I thought it was a very solid offering and I am anxious to try more from this brewery."
"M/D- medium bodied, good carbonation. easy drinking. could easily polish of a growler of this in the course of an evening."
"I am very impressed. Different from most scotch ales I have had. This beer has it all. I must have bought a fresh growler because a small ring of head stayed throughout the entire pint. The mouthfeel was excellent, lingering for a while after. After the first pint I had to have another. The mixture of caramel, a slight smokiness and tinge of hop lingering was just too good. I can't wait to try another style from this brewery soon!"
"Drinkability: I usually pick up a growler every couple of weeks of this. Goes down easy, its enjoyable."
"The taste has some light fruitiness along with sweet grain and a very light caramel finish. Light brown sugar and a very slight toast are found in the finish. The mouthfeel is light with high carbonation, which takes away from the flavor of the beer. In the end this dulls the beer down a bit. It tastes good, but it's nothing really exciting. It's not at the top of my list as something to grab, but I enjoy it."
"It tastes like a popcorn ale and has a fruity taste of bitter citrus and then some malt sourness. Interesting flavor."
"This beer is an unknown at my work. Obviously it can be a little ominous or intimidating to some, but of course I have no fear in trying new beers!!! I took this bad boy home and quickly opened to it to my surprise. A very good beer was inside. hey I'm kinda rhyming, weird. Anyway, this beer has a good head, good lacing. Tastes very good, don't go drinking it in all at once now, ya here!"
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day, and tried to once. I don't remember much, except it was the best Tuesday ever. I'm kidding, but seriously, this is so smooth, I literally could just pound it back all day, not a care in the world."
" nice on-tap!"
"D: This is an easy drinking ale. Goes down easy but nothing really exciting about it to make me want to go back for another one."
"Pours a cloudy golden light brown color, nice carbonation, very nice two-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hop note, slightly sour/citrus note. The taste is malty, hoppy, soury, with some caramel. Drinkable, not a bad brew, nice to have had a chance to try it."
"A very nice beer, i have it every time i'm at the Hartford airport. Wouldn't mind a little more flavor, but a great session scottish."
"This is a nice easy drinker. Something to enjoy on a hot day. I have never had a scotch ale and I was expecting more of a whisky taste. What a nice surprise."
"A very refreshing and authentic Scottish pint - well done."
"Was glad to see this offered at T. Pic's bar in Waterbury, CT (soon to be The Publick House, go there!!). Poured from the growler into a pint glass, this one showed a slightly hazey dark iced tea color with a modest off-white head and fair scattered lacing. The aroma was a somewhat malty rye, a touch grassy but mild and mellow, pleasant. The flavor was a very nice blend of spicey rye and mild brown sugar malt. Mild but effective carbonation in a medium bodied silky feel. I really like this with it's polite hint of bitterness, somewhere between herbal and citrus. This tasted better than I remember it from the tap some time ago, so I will be sure to snag a growler for home sometime soon. Well done!"
"Drinkability: In growler form, I've found a new brew that is oh so satisfying. I love how the maltiness and the hops cooperate with eachother perfectly to shape out this wonderful treat. An excellent offering from a local brewer and I will definetley have to pick up more of this soon."
"3.4/5"
"This could be a good go to beer if the selection isn't that great, which in this case it wasn't. Drinkable, didn't seem to have a high abv at all."
"I wish this had more of a scent to it. There are a ton of late hop additions to this, but none of them seem to contribute any aroma, but then again maybe thats what they were going for with the scotish style...so what do I know? I do know I will look for this beer and other by Olde Burnside Brewing Company."
"My favorite session beer, crisp. clean. One finger head that stays throughout the pint. Malty aroma, a bit smoky. A citrus/grass hop note. The body was average for the style, with light carbonation, mouthfeel was average, but if it was 90 degrees out the mouthfeel would be exceptional. Very well balanced. I had no problem finishing a growler and a half. This is what I reach for after mowing the lawn. A winner in my book . I've got to make it a point to get down to the brewery, I would love to have a fresh pint."
"Pours reddish and clear with a lively head and good lacing. Not much aroma. The flavor is crisp and malty with a slight bitterness. there is relatively little in the way of finish, however. The mouthfeel is thin but not unpleasant. This is a good, drinkable beer. You won't be disappointed to find it in a pub somewhere."
"Pours a clear amber color with a one finger plus white head that has good retention with no lacing. The aroma is dominated by sweet carmelized malt. Up front flavors of toasted malt and smoke lead to some lemony hops with chocolate and molasses. Light carbonation, medium body, leaves a very clean, crisp mouthfeel, a little thin for the style but it works. The malt is very well controlled and balanced by the hops, there are so many different flavors. Too often, the smoke takes over the taste of this style, not here. Amazing drinkability for the style, I had no problem finishing this growler on my own. My favorite CT beer to date."
"My recommendation is this - Drink Ten Penny Ale because the rest of them are just beer."
"Hazy Orange-Brown color with a nice off-white tan head that laces the glass. It has a nice roasted malt smell with some hop bitterness. The flavor is pretty good. It tastes of roasted malts as a base and a good hop bitterness to balance out the flavor. The mouthfeel is good with a nice velvety feel and a bit flatter than it had to be. The drinkability is pretty good though. I like this beer, gotta support your local brewer."
"Drinkability: Flaws aside, I find this quite drinkable. Its watery mouthfeel may actually help one polish off the whole growler in one sitting. While at the same time, the malty aroma and multifaceted taste keep you interested."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a fruity yeast scent along with a mild pale and light crystal malt aroma. There are some hops in there as well. The taste is average. It has a weak and watery malt flavor. There appears to be some peated malt in there, but it's faint. The hops add some bitterness, but not enough to make it interesting. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a forgettable brew. I wanted to like it, but it's just not very good."
"This beer poured a clean brown with a thin head. I was quite impressed. The aroma smelled of cigarettes, butter, coffee along with something that was rather funky, possibly an infection. There was an earthy, still funky, cigarettes, butter and infection flavor. I couldn't get past the funky and infected flavor enough to get further in the taste evaluation. There is a medium to full body, but again, I couldn't get past the flavor. The growler may not have been clean. I found it too funky to be enjoyable. Maybe I can review it again and be more positive."
"Ten Penny is a very reliable Scoth Ale and always available in growler form. I've had it on-tap, and it's pretty much on par, but I prefer the former. Definitely recommended."
"D: One of these is interesting enough to drink, but that's probably enough for me."
"This one almost has potential, and I would like to try again, as I think this might be a bad batch. I remember having it at a beer festival in New York City and liking it more (though I do remember it being a bit out of style). This one was brought to me by friends who bought it cold, put it in a cooler, then a fridge and given to me only a couple days later. The chalky character was relentless."
"This is the second time I had a ten penny ale on tap. The first time I had it I thought someone made a mistake when storing the beer. Having it a second time at Adam's Mill restaurant in Manchester CT, I realized that first time I had it it was either skunked, or the tap lines contaminated. Anyways, this beer was a decent all around brew, and I would order it again. I had it with a burger and it paired quite nicely. However this beer may not be completely loyal to its style. I found there to be more hops in the beer than I feel a Scottish ale should have, however for my personal taste I enjoyed it. If rating based on loyalty to style alone, subtract a half point. However I liked it, good session beer, and would drink it again."
"M: A bit to much carbonation and no mouth. To watery."
"This is a beer you could easily drink all night and is great for a group who may not like more full-flavored ales."
"Originally reviewed on May 21, 2006. Julios Spring Beer Festival. Nice glowing warm strong pomagranate juice aroma, with an aged Gruyere twist. A touch of smoke. Pour of hazlenut ambered orange. Flavor is a rich warm sweet fruit, filled with oragnes, lemons, cranberries and light malt. Then a rounding dusky peat smoke and a dash of bright hops for a good rounding effect. Well Done!"
"Mouthfeel was full, rich and creamy."
"Pours a bright caramel color with ruby highlights and a deep darkness in the middle. Tight, soft head. On the nose, tons of toffee and vanilla notes, plus some dry graininess. The taste is a bit different from what I expected based on the nose -- there's a touch of brown grains in the middle, but the first sensation I get from this is a dry hop bitterness that sticks around through the finish. The mouthfeel is also much thinner than I had expected, with sharp carbonation and a slight alcoholic burn. Overall, very enjoyable in spite of not being what I expected -- an easily enjoyable, quite drinkable beer that represents its style well."
"Overall a drinkable Scottish Ale. Could have used a broader grain profile in my opinion."
"D: This beer is tasty, but it’s a bit filling. It’s worth drinking, but personally, I might look for something else."
"D - which leads to a great drinkability, even my father, who's a High Life man, likes this beer"
"Additionally, only choose the growler if you have to. This beer pours much better from a tap then a bottle."
"Amber-orange with a white head, good lacing. Smells sweet and faintly of roasted caramel. Taste is sweet and smooth with subtle roasted and caramel falvors. No big flavors here, but a very nice beer nevertheless. Easy drinking and tasty, a good NE craft brew for the uninitiated."
"Mouthfeel is the weak spot on this beer, very watery, but doesn't take away too much from this well done ale. I'd rate the drinkability, as high, on this one."
"Had my roommate pick this beer up for me while he was visiting home in Connecticutt for Thanksgiving break. Sat in my fridge for about a week and a half, with no noticeable degredation of flavor."
"On tap on a regular basis after work at the Bungalow in Watertown, CT. Very pleasant mouthfeel with a slightly sweet taste balanced with just enough hops for my preference. Pours a reddish-brown color with a small head. Be careful not to serve this beer to cold."
"Pours a clear old copper penny color. Thick foamy, sponge-like head that took its time receding. Nose is very mild; only malts and barely there hops. Taste was better than expected. Malts were coming through strong with slight toffee and caramel. The hops were there, but something else that reminds me of a heather ale. Mouthfeel consisted of a fairly light body with perfect carbonation for the style. Very drinkable with a fairly low ABV (I presume) that I found to be a good beer to drink as I watch the ball game."
"A slightly cloudy amber beer. Has a big creamy off white/beige head with some nice lace.There is a light earthy grainy note to the aroma with a caramel sweetness in the background. The flavor starts with light sweet malt character. Followed by a nice prickly hop finish. Good thirst quencher on a hot day."
"Draught: I was happy to see a local beer at the airport while waiting for a plane in addition to the usual macro swill. The beer pours an amber color with just a bit of head. There is some lacing to go with it. The aroma has a hint of peat with a slight burnt nose. I liked the maltiness of this beer. Not overly malty, but still having a full body. Hops balance is good. Not overpowering, just a hint. A very good beer."
"On draught at Locks Landing in Bradley International airport (Hartford). Pours dark clear amber with a medium thin off-white head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is lightly hoppy with scant malt and caramel. Medium-bodied and tart, with hops, citrus and mild spice flavors. The finish is smooth and bitter but not very flavorful. Definitely a pleasant surprise during a long layover and easy drinking to boot, not to mention my first beer from CT."
"Reflection: Scotch ale? I would have sworn this was a brown ale but it was still a good beer and worth picking up."
"I was a little surprised to find a growler of this stuff in BBC country-but nonetheless I decided to give it a try. The bottle description was not very informative, only after I looked it up on BA did I find out what specific type ale it was. Reminds me a little of Belhaven, but fresher. Dirty cooper color, with hints of Raspberry, you can taste the alcohol. Overall a very plesant beer."
"From a growler. Poured a rich caramel with a decent initial head. Smell was mainly malt with a light molasses undertone. I was hoping for a touch of smokiness that I had noted in other Scotch Ales. Taste was a bit one diemensional, with mainly a malt sweetness with a slight bitterness on the finish. On the drinkability scale, it was a tad thick. Mouthfeel was medium in quality with a slightly oily quality."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a creamy 3/4"" off-white head above the caramel-hued brew. Head settles at about 1/2", holding steady, with heavy foam lacing. Aroma is of earthy, floral hops, some heather character, with an undercurrent of pale to caramel malts. The hops and heather character carries over into the taste, producing a reasonably well-balanced brew that tends a tad toward the hops. Mouthfeel is a little rough, but after a few mouthfuls you are good to go, and the drinkability heads on up. Enjoyable brew."
"A mild and quite tasty version of the style. A growler of this is a perfect fit given that I'll probably drink at least a few more of these tonight. A solid session ale IMO."
"Please note that this was served in a plastic pint glass, I would have enjoyed this even more if it was in a pint glass. It was my session beer for that evening. This was the smallest micro on the scene at The Meadows. I plan on picking up a growler of this next time I am in CT. This beer is worth checking out if you are in the Hartford area."
"This sample came to me (through no small adventure) as part of BIF 10, and many thanks to spiritdeus for sharing this gem with me."
"I looked at the bottled menu and saw just plain macros, so I had to ask what was on tap to see if anything can save me here. And to my surprise they had this on tap, so I quickly ordered a pint of this stuff. Came in a 16oz pint glass and appeared to be a nutty brown color with some nice carbonation in there. Quite malty along with some slight peat aromas, but very little. Could of used a little more peat-like aromas, but that's ok. Taste was nice. Slight toasted malts that seemed sweetened slightly. Some brown sugar was also in there to add a little more sweetness to it. There was some peatness to it, but it could of used a little more. But the flavors did blend in well which I liked about this beer. I do have a bottle of this and I'll see how these two compare. But on-tap, this is pretty nice."
"After drinking a few more growlers of Ten Penny I have come to realize that this beer is extreemly drinkable and always provides that extra hidden power punch needed to get you toasty."
"Wyll-"
"Smells of hops and weeds with a tiny smell of carmel-corn in the nose. Poured a deep copper hue with a load of lacing. Grassy heather taste with sweet and spicy hops, not enough malt for me (which is typical of heather ales I guess,) the taste was not particularly exciting, middle-of-the-road. Dry mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation, drinkable but a bit too average for me to have more than one. Came in a cool blue 750ml bottle that I'll hang on to though."
"From a growler, poured nutty almond in color, with a noticable chill haze, white head and left some lace. Hops in the nose, malty flavor profile, nuts, and apricots, some grainy hoppyness coming in late, nice finish. Decent scottish ale, could use some more malt, and smoothness to get a higher rating from me, decent stuff, classy small brewery, worth checking out there brews, if youre in the Hartford, Ct. area"
"While I was watching the football on sunday my crew and i decided to try some new beers. One of those was Ten Penny Ale. I was surpised by it. It was like a poor man Bass. The color was a little lite, but it was darker than domestic beers. As i took a wiff of it, the smell was quite pleasant. It had a pleasant taste also, went perfect with my hamburger. Plus it wasn't too bubbley like some beers sometimes are. And it went down easly, with a mild after taste. This is perfect beer fot grilling and tailgating."
"What's going on with this beer? Practically nothing. Booor-ing. I did not order another."
"A well balanced scottish ale. Lots of off flavors, although I've had this on tap and it was terrific. The inconsistency of the flavor prevents me from making this a regular in my beer stash. Sometimes it's great, and sometimes it's so-so."
"Notes: To me, this was extremely reminiscent of a Long Trail Ale, but with a fruitier aftertaste. Very enjoyable beer and highly recommended. Will try soon in the growler."
"Being that this beer is brewed about two blocks from where I grew up in East Hartford, I tried it as soon as a saw it for the first time. I've had many beers since then and this one has grown on me. From its half gallon tub Ten penney pours out a thick fat head, yet is not very carbonated. The hops are strong in this one. I go back to this beer every couple of months."
"Dark amber color, with a dark tan head full of big frothy bubbles. The head lingers long and laces nicely down the glass. There is a strong hop aroma with nuances of esthers and yeast. The carbonation is low, and the flavor imparts a strong hop bitterness. Not too malty, but sort of a dough flavor with hints of apricot and pine. Light for a Scottish ale, but a very nice offering from a new young brewer."
"After trying this on tap a few times I cant get enough of it.It has really grown on me.I've changed my review %"
"Store-bought growler. Amber with full head that dwindles. Exceptionally grassy aroma that suggests intense hops. This Pacific coast flavor is present in the beer and it is surprisingly hoppy for a Scottish ale but maintains its balance. Not too bitter, hints of peat and smoke in malts, but no caramel goodness that's in most malty beers. Venom did a good job of describing this brew. It really is too tangy with grass and grapefruit flavors, but a good aftertaste. It is unique, and commendable for that. I like it just fine and you gotta love a CT brew."
