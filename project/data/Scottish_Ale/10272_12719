This was one of the brews that first introduced me to a life beyond Molson Pilsener and other industrial lagers. It is widely available and the description on the bottle sparks considerable interest. Whiskey and vanilla eh? Alright. A reddish bronze beer with unassuming white foam, smells like mellow brown sugar or butterscotch, what I would describe as a corn sugar sort of sweetness, hints of floral vanilla and green grass, and a dry oakiness that evokes whiskey. Tastes much like it smells, with the same basic elements just listed except that the taste is much more woody, dry, and somewhat earthy. Less sweet than the aroma would suggest and feels somewhat like a lager: Thinnish body and rather assertive carbonation. Hints of bread crust, tobacco, and some other floral note flit in and out of the whisky-like, woody, semi-sweet murk. Its just OK in my view. I prefer a few other Innis & Gunn offerings. The vanilla is great but I'd tone down the barrel flavor and amp up the caramel, thicken up the body and add a few extra layers of flavor.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 14, 2014"

A little more sweet than I normally like, but this is not a downfall, as it is pretty balanced. Reminds me of juice or vanilla cake. A little less complex than I imagined but this was brewed very well and there are other beers by Innis & gunn that have darker, more bitter notes. Definitely no hoppy taste in this one.

While each component was decently represented in quality, the variety of fruits, malts, oak, and liquored flavoring was quite impressive. With each sip you were given all of that European whiskey flavoring, without all of that fusel alcoholic afterpunch. The feel was thin and overly prickled for the style, contributing little, and only minimally enhancing the experience. Otherwise the aroma and the taste were wrought with sweet and bready esters which, by the end, effectively drowned out a lot of those initial intricacies.","TheBrewo","May 20, 2013"

The nose has a decidedly lager like character with faint notes of caramel malt and oak. Not really getting any of what I would classify as Scottish character. The taste features plenty of oak, mellow bourbon and vanilla character, and again a dry bready lager yeast character. The taste is rather thin and seems to have more flavor from the oak than from the base beer. Mouthfeel is way over carbonated with a very light body. This one is not working well for me. Kinda reminds me of the AB Winter Cask Ale, bland and watery with some vanilla and oak character.","homebrew311","Jan 24, 2013"

It has some complexity, but it's too sweet, with too much toffee and vanilla - these flavours dominate everything else. It would be improved by a more robust maltiness that stands up to the oak and creates a better balance. Anyway, try it for interest, once.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 10, 2012"

This one was sweet with some hints of vanilla and caramel. I was expecting a little more of a sour flavor to it but it was way sweeter than expected. The sweetness dies down a bit the more you drink. The finish is grainy and dry with not a lot of bitterness. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, the carbonation was low also.

3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"12 oz into a Duvel tulip. Probably not the correct glass. I guess the correct glass came in this gift pack. Oh well, the tulip probably brings out the truer nose anyway. Appearance isn't very exciting. Clean clear body with a moderate head. However, as soon as I take a whiff, this beer gets interesting. Lots of woodiness and a hint of aged whiskey. Perhaps I am imagining that, as I'm not sure they even used whiskey barrels. Mellow hops balance the beer, but it is a little on the sweet side, even for a UK style pale ale. Alcohol content is high and it hides it well. Has a lot of energy in the mouth and is smooth. Not something I'd drink every day, but recommended to try. A good example of how to properly age beer in barrels.","chicagoabbot","Nov 06, 2011"

While the bottle was clear, the set came in a cardboard box, so the contents were kept safe and tasted fresh. Opened a bottle with a pot pie dinner. They color was a bright copper color. I was a little concerned about this being too spicy, but the scent is surprisingly mild. And while it is sweet, the taste is not overpowering. Definitely has an oak aged taste, but it is surprisingly light and drinkable. The mouthfeel was very light, but had an appropriately complex aftertaste. At 6.6 percent there is no strong tinge of alcohol either. It is overall a good beer, but exists in a grey area where I would not want to have 4-6 of them, but it did not feel special enough to be content with just one. Kind of a novelty, but overall well done.","edwardhopper","Nov 04, 2011"

The nose is kinda weak, comprising light toffee, honey, very light greens, sweet flowers, and a touch of wheat bread. The taste is more robust, with notes of caramel, vanilla, light wet oak, maple syrup, light honey, sweet flowers, and wet heather. It's a unique flavor combination to say the least, but it all ends up making me smile. The body is a light medium, with a mild carbonation and a slickly smooth feel.

By far the most distinguishable and prevalent character of this beverage. The texture is light, well carbonated and super creamy. The vanilla flavor from the nose is true to taste along with big rye whiskey character. That's what I'm talking about!! Very nicely done!! The oak aged treatment is really significant and it lingers REALLY NICELY in the aftertaste...adding significant value to the entire experience. Surprisingly low ABV...only 6.6%. All in all, a VERY DRINKABLE ale!! Very nice effort from the folks back in the home country.

I don't know if I liked it or not. There were huge flavor of oak and toffee candy. So that aspect I liked. But, it almost tasted artificial to me; like an additive.

There is a mild bitterness, but the sweet caramel malt is balanced mostly by the oak tannin. The finish is astringent with some nice woody, bourbon flavor that really lingers.

It is because it is a completely different class of beer. The whiskey's natural oils present in those oak casks definitely add flavor dimensions that have made me even reconsider the way I do beer tasting from now on. It has simply set the highest standards possible and although a very expensive beer, it is a fantastic example of a truly "great" one. The nose is strong and promises what it preaches: vanilla, caramel, whisky-tinged oak cask taste, with a hint of citrus in the undertones of the beer. Taste up-front is harsh and the drinkability is not the best ever, however it gets much more impressive the more you drink it (literally with each sip) and you become more accustomed to the wide palatte of flavors before you.

This is a light bodied beer as well. The oaky wood so strong in the nose is a few shades toned down in the flavor. More pronounced is a vanilla, almost cream soda syrup sweet malty taste. There is some smoked straw like scotch flavors in the beer and the antique butterscotch is also present throughout. The 6.6% ABV is completely hidden and unnoticeable and I would have expected a much lower ABV beer from the taste. The beer is a touch thin and there really is no residual aftertastes and the mouthfeel is quite slight from a light bodied beer.

I'm pretty sure that this beer wasn't stored properly, as my main problem with it is the skunking, which probably was caused by lack of refrigeration and light damage. However, I'm not 100% sure it was entirely the store's fault, as many people have commented on the skunk. Still, this beer fights through it and was enjoyable.

Taste is predominantly malt characterized by toffee, vanilla, caramel, with the most predominant taste being the vanilla taste. Overall, the beer is very sweet, as expected. Light body in the mouth feel and moderate drinkability. Overalll, this beer is a little sweet for me and doesn't have enough body to support how sweet it is. Average brew.

Lots of flavors, very complex, hard to pick out one overly strong trait. More of the smells are present in the taste including woodiness, nuts, smoke, and some whiskey flavors that linger.

4.52,20.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Pours out a clear caramel hued amber, not much head on the pour, but a thin layer of retention that struggles to cling on. The aroma on this ale is a knock-out, truly impressive. Whiskey is what immediately greets the nose, sour mash bourbon no doubt, accompanied by a rich toffee, wood and peat characteristics, finished with some citrus. Wow. The flavour is just as good. Earthy wood notes with some sour whiskey, dates and currents blending in the middle with some vanilla bean, with a mild dried fruit finish accompanied by lemon, and a lip-smacking vanilla aftertaste. Wow. The mouthfeel is light, smooth and velvety, I had expected a denser texture for the flavour, but this makes for an easier quaffer, in fact deceptively easy to drink for the abv%. Easily a fine session ale, I am incredibly pleased to have stumbled across some of this, and will be stocking up on a lot more in the near future. Will recommend it highly to my friends, and anyone else who'll listen as well. My lips are coated with vanilla bean oil at the moment as I find myself at the bottom of the glass, I am very content.","IronDjinn","May 09, 2005"

4.23,12.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From a foot away I can smell the caramel. Sweet luscious malts are hidden under that pillowy white head... Smooth and soft, with the subtlest of oak nuances, it delivers an easy-drinking ale. Hardly the barest hint of hops at all. I could drink this all night long, if only I had more. It is a beautiful beer.","Garin","Apr 08, 2005"

3.52,-6.4,4,2,4,4,4,"Presented in a clear (why?) bottle and no visible freshness date. It pours a light copper with a nice white head that leaves some foam on the glass. Some malt and whiskey notes make through the rather overwhelming smell of run-over-three-days-ago skunk. I've had better bottles of this, but this one is really bad. Why should they put it in clear bottles and let this happen to an otherwise lovely beer? Not impressed. Sweet honey and malt in the taste with some oaky and whiskey hints. Mercifully not much of the skunkiness. A rather tasty beer, and certainly very good when you have a good bottle of the stuff. Nice mouthfeel and drinkable, but why the clear bottles. I shouldn't rant. It is a good beer, just plug your nose.","foamer","Feb 06, 2005"

4.25,13,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5," I wasnt overly impressed with the first bottle but this is actually quite a good beer. The flavor takes a bit of getting used to,similar to a "rauch" style beer. Very enjoyable.","lackenhauser","Oct 09, 2004"
4.25,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Fresh bottle drunk on a rainy morning in Belfast, for breakfast (thanks Bob). This pours a pretty clear, dark amber colour with a creamy head of off-white. The aromas are of WHISKEY! Whiskey malts, slight subtle hops, caramel, and more. The taste is very creamy and smooth with some sweet caramel notes that ride along the waves of complex, smokey, whiskey flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a real "cask-like" feel to it. Drinkability is very good, even for a breakfast beer. Shit, this stuff is damn good, thanks again to Belfasts finest BA (only BA!? ;-)","francisweizen","Jun 24, 2004"
