3.8,2.7,,,,,,"Pours clear and orange brown with a crimson blush. Has good clarity adn you can see a stream of bubbles coming up from the center to meet a loose head of tan foam that falls fast and does not leave lace.  There is a nice honey hue around the edges. Nose is malty. Bread, rich malt and a some earthy peat. A good fruitiness that is deep in the beer so you can't really name it and maybe a faint bit of grass. Taste is outstanding. Before your realize ti you have swallowed and what resides on the  palate in the quick remembrance of an exceptionally  smooth malty experience. There are several factes to this malt. The breaddiness which is dry and crisp and not too deep. There is dry cracker that keeps it light. And the earthy  peat that could favor a variety of different malty expressions but finds caramel in this one. It's a bit sultry it's a bit dapper.  The fruitiness is the middle and this finishes with a subtle rise in hops to a light grass and a faint bitter underneath the beer to push ti along the palate and finish it with a lovely lingering malty sweetness. Tall in the glass and not too sweet I loved this and thought it was excellent.","utopiajane","Aug 21, 2014"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, plum, brown sugar, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, plum, brown sugar, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, biscuit, fig, plum, brown sugar, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Scottish ale. All around good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink.

The flavor isn't quite as bold as the aroma, with the primary characteristic being a sweet graininess that is reminiscent of maple and brown sugar oatmeal, but there are also the light fruitiness from the aroma, as well as a rich caramel finish. The texture is a disappointment, with a thin, light fizzyness that doesn't match the rich malty flavors.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Thirsty Dog Brewing Company doesn't get enough credit in a state that also includes Great Lakes and Hoppin' Frog. Twisted Kilt Scotch Ale has been available on-tap for years. Luckily for those of us who live out of state, it's now available in bottles.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 09, 2010"
3.65,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A story of toasted malt, a significant caramel. A decent serviceable Scottish. A moderate smokey aroma, a little peaty taste. Dark yellow colour, modest off-white head. Creamy mouthfeel. Satisfying, spot-on style, though not terrific.On the sweeter sugar syrupy side.","Sammy","Oct 23, 2010"

2.99,-19.2,3.5,2,3,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Not an especially tasty Scottish Ale overall, but not bad tasting, either; not too heavy and a pretty moderate ABV that's not going to overwhelm anyone; not really something I would seek out when I'm in the mood for this particular style.","bamadog","Sep 24, 2010"
2.91,-21.4,4,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"12oz bottle into my ommegang glass. Apears a light amber color. Head is bubly and disapates within a couple minutes. Not much to smell here, a slight woody smell with roasted malt. Taste and mouthfael both feal water downed to me with to much carbonation. Bells ca blows this out of the water. I could drink a decent amout of these because of the abv but wouldnt want to.","beer1018","Sep 03, 2010"

3.25,-12.2,4,4,2.5,3.5,3.5,"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip pours a nice crisp brown with a frothy lasting eggshell head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is smooth burnt caramel and brown malts. The taste is loads of sweet caramel malts with a hint of sweet and dried fruits. The beer is light bodied, but a bit overly sweet. This is an interesting Scotch ale, but not likely one I'd pick up again.","atsprings","Jul 14, 2010"

4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Appears a clear deep ruddy amber hue with a bright lighter khaki hue with even finely spread lacing around the chalice. Aroma strong smoked peated malts an amazingly light smoked meats tone going on. Flavor is great a rush of smokey sweet malt light brisk malt character this is really well made Scottish ale, there's body moderate carbonation wonderful mix of flavors in this beer. Sturdy herbal backing earthy hops this stuff is great really drinkable I'm glad I gambled on a bottle. Definitely one I will look out for I wanna try more Thirsty Dog brews, these are solid standup players in the Ohio microbrew scene. I heard there brewer used to work at Great Lakes and he helped formulate some of the famous Great Lakes brews so my next stop will be their Dortmunder Lager aka Labrador Lager.","WVbeergeek","Jul 11, 2010"

4.05,9.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Copper colored brew with a small ivory head. Good retention and lacing from the residual layer. Sweet malt level with noticeable alcohol component. The nose portrays lots of malt and little bit of a spice overlay. The feel is full and creamy with lots of smoothness. Good drinkability for an obviously high ABV beer.","AtLagerHeads","Dec 17, 2003"
4.25,14.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a deep amber color with a thin off-white head and some lacing. Aroma of malt, alcohol and cinnamon. Warm and rich malt flavor with a somewhat syrupy finish. Another foray into higher-ABV beers for Thirsty Dog, this is good stuff. It's nice to see a new Scotch Ale on the market!","Dogbrick","Jan 12, 2003"
