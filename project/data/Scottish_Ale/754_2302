3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of raisin, plum, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, nuttiness, light smoke, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. A bit too fruity in the nose. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, plum, apple, light nuttiness, light smoke, light herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Minimal earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, plum, apple, light nuttiness/smoke, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt and light-moderate fruity/earthy yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Scottish ale style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 21, 2015"

3.98,9.3,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Having had this fantastic Scottish ale in bottle form, the tap version is just as good if not better. Pours a deep amber with light quickly dissipating head that leaves light white lacing. Smell of caramel, toffee, fresh biscuit, with a light peat smell. Taste is excellent with rich caramel malts and peat malt shinning through. Silky smooth mouthfeel, refreshing for a beer coming in at a higher ABV. Light toffee taste in the back with caramel malts and almost zero bittering hops. Excellent as always and one I would suggest to turn newbie beer lovers onto as well as the experienced beer nut. Cheers.","Brutaltruth","Jun 14, 2014"

It's inoffensive, and definitely not at all hoppy, so it might be an acceptable introduction for someone wanting to move up from BMC and see what the craft fuss is about, but a more experience pallate is likely to find it wanting. It's classified as a Scotch ale, but it strikes me as recipe that started out as a slightly flavored wheat beer, and when they went to brew they discovered they were out of wheat, so they used golden toasted malts instead. Once this six-pack is gone, I can't imagine buying this one again.","BuckeyeSlim","Oct 13, 2012"

Light-medium body with a lively mouthfeel. Tangy. I liked it, but it was unusual and not at all what I expected for a Scottish ale. I downgraded it for missing the mark for its style. I upgraded the overall score because I liked the beer even though it tasted more like a bier de mars or a farmhouse.","chickenflea","Jun 24, 2012"

The mouthfeel is fairly well-carbonated with a medium body, and the drinkability is good. It's a fairly average beer, all said and done.

The trick is picking out the good beer from the cases of junk. I like a beer adventure as much as the next drinker, but I do get tired of dragging home one crappy beer after another. This brew plops neatly into the crap trap: beef-broth color and beef-broth taste from the beginning all the way to the tired, bitter end. And not good beef broth, either: it's the ick your grandmother used to make from 10-year-old bullion cubes that had been sitting in a glass jar with a red rooster on the label. Avoid. Or, if you must have beef broth, make it from cow bones.","gfreed","Jun 01, 2011"

When it come to Scottish Ales I tend to like the Wee Heavys but I was looking for something a little lighter this time since I tend to overlook most Scottish Ales and go straight to the Wee Heavys. This beer had all the good flavors I would expect from the style, it was just all together more lighter, subtle and drinkable then a Wee Heavy. This brew seems to be a good match for a stormy spring day. The only things I would change about this brew would be to add more carbonation and add in some more hops to give it a little bitterness to help balance out all the malts. I don't think I would seek this beer out again when Dirty Bastard is much more widely available and a better value, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered one because it is pretty smooth and drinkable. If you tend to like your Scottish Ales on the lighter side and not as robust and strong as a Wee Heavy then this may be the beer to you.

Sweet caramel and malts lend themselves to the aroma with added strength followed by a little bready, overripe fruit on the tail end. The mouthfeel is smooth and honey-like, a mouthfeel that is always appearing to me. The taste is mainly of sweet malts, caramel, and toffee with neutral hops to balance it out.

Mouthfeel is nice, it's very smooth and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good too, it goes down very easy and the 6.8% ABV isn't noticable at all. It seems like the beer isn't that strong, but it does kick in later. Overall I think this is a decent brew.

Seems to be yeast? floating around in it. Fairly malty which is what I didn't expect from it. Very good flavor to me. I would recommend it.

3.85,5.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Hazed copper appearance. Thin white head that leave stringy rings of lace. Sweet malt, peat and candy come together nicely on the nose. The flavor contains some sweet malt and candy, but also some bready and yeasty tones that are pleasant and incorporated nicely. Some nice doughiness as well. Mouthfeel is mildly spritzy. Body is about medium or so. Quite a pleasant beer.","Bighuge","Mar 02, 2005"
4.4,20.9,4,4,4.5,4,5,"I realize the Erie Brewing Company is small, but if you have a chance to try it, definitely do. I feel it's their best beer (though there are few), and it should get more hype than it does.","asabreed","Jan 16, 2005"
3.87,6.3,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability and Overall: This is a very interesting brew, unlike anything I've had from PA. The first beer I've had from Erie, and I must say I'm impressed. It's not the best beer I've ever had, but definitly a welcome change. I could pound a few, but more than 3 may be to much. Try it.","santoslhalper","Dec 03, 2004"

3.4,-6.6,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D&N: Smooth drinking, but a bit too heavy on the ETOH to have more than one or two of. If the alcohol were masked a bit better, this would be a beer I'd recommend.","JackTheRipper","Mar 26, 2004"
3.35,-8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A pretty good beer from Erie... who would have thought? Pleasant maltiness, gentle alcohol warmth, a slight hop presence... this is not representative of most Scottish ales I've had, which I'm pretty sure is what it's intended to be, but still an enjoyable beer.","brewman1526","Sep 08, 2003"

3.53,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a nice copper. Malty at first, thinning out a bit and then finishing somewhat dry. Some caramel malt, with moderate hopping. A some mineral water flavors. Seemed more English than Scottish in nature. Nothing particularly noteworthy, but not bad.","Brent","Aug 02, 2003"
3.51,-3.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Bright, medium copper color with amber highlights. Topped by a cream colored head. The aroma is primarily caramel notes backed by a light hoppiness. The taste echoes the caramel notes, along with a very nice bitterness and finishes very clean. The mouthfeel is solid and well carbonated, and the drinkability is good. A solid offering from Erie Brewing.","aaronh","Jun 07, 2003"
2.96,-18.7,4,3,3,2,3,"Medium amber/brown with thin creamy head. Light hop nose and light carbonation. Very smooth and slightly undercarbonated. Slight bitterness offset by malt sweetness. Finished dry. Taste is often overpowered by food. Very subtle and pedestrian. Needs more carbonation or more flavoring hops.","psugrad98","Feb 19, 2003"
3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A rough pour brings up a full, frothy ivory head over a clear, deep reddish-amber body. The head holds fairly well, then drops to a nice creamy collar, and leaves some nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma offers some nice soft fruit and gently spicy & floral hops above a mildly sweet malt. The body is medium with a very fine & moderate carbonation that leaves it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor offers a softly sweet & gently caramel-tinged maltiness that's well-balanced by a thread of grassy hop flavor and a supportive bitterness. A touch of alcohol is sometimes noticeable but actually seems to add to the character of the beer rather than distracting from it. It finishes softly with a mild drying alcohol, a dull bitter note and a sticky maltiness. Nicely done, and actually quite unique. There's much more to this beer than the first impression gives. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Dec 25, 2002"
4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours small head from a hard pour, ruby tinted brown color, leaves light lace on glass.  Railbender is smoothly yet very lightly carbonated.  Goes down smooth and leaves you quickly with an empty glass, a relaxed feeling, and yearning for another.  Smell is a delicate roasted fragerance scent with no notable hoppy smell.  What matters the most, taste, is good.  This brew offers a very mellow, slightly bitter, but overall well balanced flavor.  Flavor gets better as the beer warms slightly; don't serve this beer really cold, because if you do alot of it's subtle flavors will be numbed, and most of its flavors are subtle.  Try this brew; it, like Erie's other two year rounds, is a very solid beer","allboutbierge","Nov 01, 2002"
4.33,19,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear, lovely dark amber, with an off white head that thins and laces down the glass. Crisp toasted malt flavors lead to a subdued but balancing hop finish. Plenty of malt and true to style, but leans towards the hop accented Scottish Ales. A tasty pizza and wings beer.","QXSTER1","May 15, 2002"
3.76,3.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Good stuff here. Could easily quaff down several of these. Very nicely hopped for a red ale. Nice dark ruby color and malt balance too.","John","Dec 17, 2001"
