This is a cloudy copper beer with decent head retention. The smell is wonderful - a sweet, flowery honey. The flavor is all about malt, which seems par for course with the style. There's more of a slight tartness than any discernible hop flavor. Honey and malt are predominant. Add some carbonation to that, and you've got a delicious beer. If this were in a nitro can, I'd pass. In the big brown bottle, you can't go wrong, as long as you like the style. I sure do.","angusdegraosta","Jan 16, 2013"

Left a few lace patches to complement a brownish-auburn body that is somewhat seethru. A nice, spicy smell for some reason, not much malt but floral hops abound, and I picked up faint notes of citrus and even berries. I also picked up something like butterscotch, so maybe my nose is out of whack (I swear there's a butteriness in the smell, though). A very hoppy ale, but it is complemented by chocolate and toffee malts and rounded out by caramel. Overall, a well-balanced ale that goes down smooth but has a quasi-dry backbite. This is one of those beers that is not going to be very sought-after, but for how cheap it is and for how good it is (and the fact that I couldn't keep my glass down), this is a must-try and a session beer.","clayrock81","Mar 16, 2008"

That said, I do really enjoy this beer. A very solid ale, with the quality I have become used to with Belhaven. It looses points, however, because the beer is completely revealed at the first taste. Many of the best beers seem to give increasingly more to the drinker the longer the liquid is held in the mouth, like a hint of spice, citrus, or what have you.

On the palate, sharp hops come out first, along with some juicy fruit esters and light, sweet caramel notes. Good acidity towards the end. Pretty unassuming carbonation that lets those sharp, acidic hops dominate. Overall, this is quite good. Excellent session beer.

Caramel and butter, woody notes. Some fruitiness and a touch of spicy hops, barely noticeable, linger deep in the background. Taste is better balanced, and not so sweet. Still plenty of caramel, but with a peaty sort of smoke permeating it and taming the sugary character. Diacetyl, to be sure, but in an understated sort of way, and mild spicy hops throughout.

Not much in the way of hops in the smell, but theres just a fleeting hint of smokiness. The taste is earthy and malty, with less sweetness than the aroma would indicate. The brew has straightforward and uncomplicated flavors, with a lightly bitter finish. Light-boarding on medium mouthfeel. I thought that it could have been a little sweeter.

Interesting seemingly cherry nose with malt backing. The mouth is light and well-carbonated. There's a very rich, complex and interesting taste here. Grape and strawberry accent the bready malt in the opening, followed by the very clear and unmistakable peat moss flavor so noticeable in several single malt scotches. There's not much hops here, but the peat provides a good dry background, lingering well into the aftertaste. As it warms, sweet sugary cherry emerges ever stronger.

A little almost mild ale of near amber golden color with a chunky head. Smells of smokey peated scotch with a gentle under current of sweet malt. Tastes of long boil caramelization with a nice upfront but not overpoaering smokeyness that could come from the way the malt is kilned. The more I drank the better this beer got and it was nice and light which kept the smokeyness from holding to the palate to hard.

Fruity esters rounded the flavour out too. Mellow smokiness lingered in the dry finish.

Hops have an herbal quality, plus there is some lingering sweetness in the finish. Complex, but a little odd to me. At first this beer was a little off-putting for me, but I've warmed up to it after half the bottle. Admittedly, Scottish ale isn't a style I have a lot of expirience with.

3.65,-4.9,4,4,3,4.5,4,"OK - this is much better than the Belhaven Scottish Ale. This one picks up where the creamy ale leaves off by adding color and hops. There is still the creamy texture but the hops cuts that so the mouthfeel is not as silky. But the added hops allows you to taste this beer. It is far more enjoyable in bouquet and taste and texture. I highly recommend this one.","AtrumAnimus","Dec 27, 2002"
2.9,-24.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Actually, I may have gotten an old 6-pack, since this was hidden away on a dusty shelf in a wine shop that does very little to sell their beer. Maybe a fresher bottle would change my opionion.","feloniousmonk","Nov 26, 2002"
4.1,6.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Another nice beer from Belhaven. A bit lighter in color than the average Scottish offering, it was a medium copper. Head was tan and persistent, lacing was similar to this breweries Wee Heavy, it was prominent from mid glass on down. I detected some roasted nuttiness which was very tasty. A solid winter beer. I enjoyed this with a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich on a cold gray day.","Mark","Nov 24, 2002"
4.15,8.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Another top notch brew from Belhaven, this is every bit as good as their regular Scottish Ale. This is a nuttier, dryer, and maybe milder beer. Amber with persistent head, lots of grassy aromas and flavors, some traces of smoke as you dig further in, and up-front big nutty brown ale flavors. Not especially bitter and a wet finish, perhaps a spikier hop element would work here, but then again it is a pretty complex beer and each sip gives me a different impression. A step away from Scottish ale into the Brown ale direction, but still plenty of grassy and smoky flavors. Cold-cut sandwich pairing suggestion is dead-on. I imagine a lot of golf players drink Bud or Coors Light after a game, which is downright insulting when a beer like this is available.","Thrasher","Nov 11, 2002"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Wow really liked the earthy undertones to this beer.I love to drink a good scottish ale like this when nice and cold outside.Had some nutty qualities to it really liked this beer and will get it again.","oberon","Sep 21, 2002"
3.95,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I liked this better than by drinking companion BigEmail.  The appearance was amber with a short-lived head that left excellent lacing.  As with BigE, the aroma and flavor to me were both malt.  I did not notice the nut flavors or mustiness that others have, but I will revisit this to try to discover some of the nuances.  A highly drinkable beer.","ryanocerus","Aug 26, 2002"
3.98,3.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The label says, "The Home of Golf."  I love it! That is a genius way to win beer converts, IMO.","DarthMalt","Aug 05, 2002"
3.1,-19.3,4,4,2.5,3,3,"Pours a tea color with a very small head.  The smell is great with notes of roasted caramel sweetness.  The taste is a malted roast with an aftertaste of musty socks?!?!  Taste almost nothing like the smell has you thinking it will.  Kind of like talking to someone on the phone and then meeting them later...they never look like what you thought.  This a light-bodied beer, kind of watery.  After smelling with high expectations, I was actually disappointed in this one. Sorry to be the wrench in the gears.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jul 16, 2002"

4.54,18.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Hazy light brown in color with a fairly thin head.  The aroma is quite appertizing and is comprised of nutty, bready and sweet crystal malt notes.  There's just a hint of earthy hop nose, but I wouldn't of noticed it if I weren't looking for it.  The carbonation is perfect, being low enough to provide for a smooth mouthfeel, but high enough to help carry the malt flavors.  Caramelized wort flavors (from perhaps an extended boil?) are accompanied by delicious nutty malt notes and barely balancing hop foundation.  St. Andrews finishes w/ a slight roasted malt bitterness.  Wow.  For a beer this light, it is highly flavorful. An absolutely ideal session beer.","marc77","Apr 06, 2002"
4.13,7.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: Well balanced and quite drinkable, does not rock the boat yet play well with mixing malt and hop flavours. This would pair well with a smoked turkey sandwich on sour-dough bread.","Jason","Mar 15, 2002"
4.35,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another Belhaven classic and like the Scottish classics, it's often imitated but never equaled. Malty sweet without being overtly so, with the perfect hop balance. Just a touch of alcohol warms the back of the throat. A true pleasure to drink.","John","Jan 14, 2002"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Rich and malty, giving way to a pleasant tartness.  Hops tended to be more acidic than bitter.  A good choice with a coldcut sandwich.","Brent","Aug 07, 2001"
