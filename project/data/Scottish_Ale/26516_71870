3.86,0.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.75,"The flavor profile is intense, complex, well balanced and is borderline outstanding.  It begins with a sweet burst of molasses and dark fruit that quickly yields to a roast bitterness.  Under the bitterness, caramel notes emerge in the middle.  Subtle smoke characteristics emerge right before the finish, gain in intensity and come to the forefront as the finish fades over a subsiding caramel and molasses sweetness.  In the lingering finish, prune notes are evident as well as a slight alcohol burn, subtle dryness and bitter pucker.","tillmac62","Feb 22, 2015"

The pour produces a solid 2 fingers of frothy, tan, shortlived, head that leaves a sheet like webs of lace. Aroma is dark malty roast, molasses, vanilla, butterscotch, some dark fruit & a hint of smoke. Taste is heavy roast, dark malt, molasses/caramel/vanilla, hints of dark chocolate, roasted nuts & a little earthy coffee with a buttery, smokey & faintly boozy finish.

3.91,2.1,4.25,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Overall, the best thing about this beer is, well, it’s a tossup between the aroma and flavoring. That said this is, as a whole, arguably a tough sell for the style, as the butteriness and smokiness are rather subtle and subdued by the end of the glass. The smoke actually enhances and billows with warmth, matching the thickness of the beer. It does hit all of the desired and required notes you would expect at least once, but is generally just a bit weak. This is a tasty local swing at an admittedly challenging style, and while they don’t execute perfectly, it should satisfy for someone looking for something on the sweeter, maltier side of the craft beer spectrum.","TheBrewo","0"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, slight smoke, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel.

Poured a deep red brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, caramel, caramel hop, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk chocolate, wood, subtle smoke, nutty, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. If I am honest, everything for this brew’s style was pretty close to being spot on. It could have done quite nicely with a bit more complexity to carry it into a new realm, but it was fairly enjoyable for the most part with what it had going on. Not the best thing I had on the day of ticking, but definitely not the worst. I would try it again in the future.","thagr81us","Aug 27, 2012"

They could have had a great beer like this one.","dogchasecats","Aug 08, 2011"
4.05,5.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall: A quality scotch ale. It's got an inviting richness to it without being bloated and enough soothing alcohol without being boozy or putting me in a coma for the evening. Yes, it's fair to say I enjoyed it.","ChainGangGuy","Beers"
4.08,6.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Comes out of the tap a barely transparent chocolate brown with a fine-bubbled light tan head. Rich, malty, chocolaty and spicy aroma invites a taste. Mouth-filling malty flavor has a spicy undertone and hints of chocolate and toffee. Strongly tingly texture leaves a persistent fizz behind.","Cyberkedi","0"
