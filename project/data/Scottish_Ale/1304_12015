It's a rather thickish brew with a certain creaminess in spite of the substantial bitter streak running through it. Throw in a fair amount of carbonation and this is a brew that goes down quite easily. Caramel, burnt brown sugar and cereal grains are prominently featured, while hints of molasses and white chocolate appear nown and again. Earthy hops linger in the finish. While it's not boozy at all, it drinks ""bigger"" than you'd expect from a 5% beer. Well done.","PDXHops","Oct 11, 2010"

3.68,3.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Overall, this is a decent example of a Scottish Style ale. Perhaps it could use a touch more in the flavor profile. I'm glad it doesn't have that metallic/tinniness that many other Scottish Ales have. The fruitiness isn't too assertive and is actually well balanced. All in all, not a mindblowing in-your-face beer, but a good sessionable brew that can fit many occasions.","DmanGTR","0"

Toasty and super sweet malts upfront, just a splash of hops give this scotc ale a light earthy aire. Some candy notes in the middl with just caramel grins through the finish.

3.65,2.8,4,4,3.5,2.5,4,"Flavors pretty much mirror the aroma, with a slight salt-and-smoke accent that usually comes up in this style, but these are very subtle back-notes, and unfortunately the body is a bit too thin to carry them through as they should be. Definitely thinner in comparison to the on-tap version I had. I tasted this first on-tap at the brewery/brewpub. It was much better then. I wonder if it's been sitting in the bottle too long? I bought it from the cooler at Pelican on Oct. 1. Of course, no date on the bottle...still a fine brew though, just not what I expected after the robust fresh version I had that night.","Metalmonk","Sep 14, 2007"
3.45,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Dry-hopping with Centennial hops gives the cask-conditioned version of MacPelicans Scottish Ale an incessant greenness which burdens much of the underlying ale with a vegetal quality. Thats too bad because the MacPelican of course deserves no concealment. The dark bronze body is silken textured and delivers striated lace. But the late infusion of hops is not very Scottish and only conflicts the taste. My advice: save dry-hopping for the IPA.","RedDiamond","Aug 05, 2007"

Toasted malt aroma with a little bit of sweet fruit. Medium, smooth body with a malty flavor. Touches of hops and fruit as well. The flavors dont stay firm for very long though. The finish shows a little more hoppiness. Overall this beer doesnt have the legs I was expecting but it is still an easy to drink Scottish Ale.","Dogbrick","Dec 02, 2006"
3.43,-3.4,3.5,3,3,4,4.5,"Mohogany colored with a thin head that disappears quickly. Smell of caramel and malts. Taste of grain, malts with only a slight evidence of alchohol, having a light - medium mouthfeel. A light, creamy and smooth ale that goes down easily, a good drinker, but the lacking body needed. Makes for a good darker summer ale.","Bookseeb","Nov 11, 2006"

3.98,12.1,3.5,3,4.5,3.5,4.5,"A very clear copper and not too much head. A small amount of sediment at the bottom makes for a hazier second pour from the bomber. The aroma is vaguely reminiscent of metallic lagers, not really distinctive or inviting. Broad, sturdy malts lead the way with elements of caramel, butter, bread crust. There's not much of the usual shortbread flavors one can often find in a Scottish-style ale. Some nutty elements and very slight toffee. The hoppiness is appropriately muted, not really grassy, a bit more citric like Pac NW beers; it's scarcely noticeable other than to give the malts a slight tweak. The beer can at times seem watery but never unpleasant. Eventually, a Scottish malt quality reveals itself, deep down, but it only shows itself intermittently. At other times, this beer oddly resembles a copper lager, as the Munich malts take the reins. Again, this is lacking many of the more familiar Scottish qualities, but it will serve nicely as a regular session ale, one with a reasonably sweet malt background and thin, refreshing mouthfeel. It's also not as cloying as many Scottish-style ales, so the drinkability is good. Perhaps it is wrong to consider it a Scottish-style ale at all, maybe better to think of it as your standard American micro amber. It's a step up from the Cream Ale and will not alienate those who dislike Pelican's intimidatingly hoppy IPA. I can imagine how good it would be through a handpump, although I preferred it on the colder side of cellar temp. I'll venture to say this is Pelican's best regular bottled beer for session drinking (unless you're a stout fan) and it should go very well with most pub-style fare, esp. burgers and such.","Thrasher","Aug 30, 2003"

3.53,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Quite a rich copper color, a thin head, and equally thin aroma. There's hints of malt, but no hop aroma worth mentioning. This carries over into the beer, as its mostly a nice combination of malts, and a somewhat unique combination. The creamy pour and smooth body aren't quite there and the beer is somewhat transparent in flavor, and a quick dry finish. With no bitterness to start or finish, it a somewhat incomplete beer.","freed","0"
