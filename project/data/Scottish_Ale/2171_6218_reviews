"Overall- This is a ok/good beer that has some nice toasted caramel malt flavors but a little too light at times. Definitely grows on you as warms up, so serving at at least 45 degrees would probably be best. Worth the try and maybe worth going for again."

"16 oz. pint on tap at JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge in Phoenix, AZ; unknown bottling/packaging date; poured into a standard pint glass and drank over 30 minutes"

"Fabulous finish on this ale!"

"Aroma is peaty and lightly smoky, phenolic, with sweet caramel and nutty, toasted malt. Flavor reveals cola-like notes, with nutty, toasted malt at the base, and a dry, nutty finish. Specialty malt fruitiness adds intrigue. Not as peaty in flavor as aroma. Flavor was actually slightly disappointing, as specialty malt fruitiness dominates."
"Very malty, good"

"This really is a good beer, just not totally my style. The copper color is fantastic and it has a decent flavor. Had it on tap while going through AZ and that was better. When on tap it seemed to have a little bit more of a nutty flavor that stood out to me. Of coarse I had just been hiking around Out of Africa, so that might have clouded my judgment. I still say drink some."
"Thank you Kerry4porters for the chance to try this beer."

"O: a bit too light flavored for style, but then ""flagship"" brews are usually tame."
""
""
"A good malty ale, clean and bright although it seemed a bit too fizzy with the mouthfeel."
""
"Very nice beer. I would certainly get some more."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly hazy and cloudy orange copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, raisin, toast, bread, floral, light peat, and floral earthiness; some light phenols as well, but not too bad. Some nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity; the phenolic note knocks it down a bit. Taste of caramel, toast, raisin, pear, bread, floral, light pepper, light peat, and floral earthiness; slight phenols noticed after the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, toast, bread, floral, light pepper, light peat, and earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of flavors with solid complexity; good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. The phenolic note was noticeable, but not too detracting. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Scottish ale. Good balance of malt/fruity flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"I had this beer on tap in downtown Phoenix while on a trip for a concert. Must have drank about ten of them by the time the weekend was over. The taste is hard to describe, however I absolutely love it. Very packed with caramel and toffee notes with a smooth hop profile. I love this beer."
"Glad to see a solid attempt at a style that seems to not get a lot of attention, and even happier to see it in a place I expected to be awash in bad beer. Arizona, you did not disappoint!"

"Overall: Not bad for the style, just doesn't have any distinguishing qualities."
""
""
"My Crack & Glug produced a finger of light-tan head that disappeared like Xi Jinping (this is a current events allusion and may be Googled at your leisure). Color was a tea-like brownish-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was quite sweet, like liquid caramel. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the maltiness was just too much for this self-avowed hophead. If it is going to be this sweet, it should have some more body to it, IMHO. It lacked any subtle smoky quality, which is what I really look for from the style. This would be a malt lover's dream but for me, it was over the top. Finish remained very sweet and I was happy to have tried it, but it was a once-and-done for yours truly."
"Another beer courtesy of the creator of the can quest, woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a deep brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, malty. Taste is malts, molasses, a good bit sweet, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"If you have never had this, go out of your way to try it!"
"This is a pretty unusual style to see available. And I'd have to say that this one is pretty good. Nice caramel roasted tones with sweet aspects that don't overdo it at all. Well rounded and smooth, as much as can be for this style. Nice to be able to try this one out."
""
""
"O: Great dark ale, very flavorful, enjoyable and paired well with my food."
"Poured a clear, deep amber-brown with a thin ring of off-white head. It looks like a nice ale, not bad. Scents of roast malt, toasted malt, fruity esters and some nutty scents. Quite nice, suggesting a nutty, roasty yet sweet taste. Flavor of sweet malt, some fruity sweetness, a bit berry-like, slight toffee and vague hints of alcohol with a faint hint of roast malt on the aftertaste. It's almost cloyingly sweet, far too much for my tastes. The roast and nutty scents do not carry into the taste at all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and a semi-drying finish. It's quite easy to drink from that perspective. Overall it's not a bad beer, just a bit too sweet for my tastes. On other occasions I've had this beer it's been a lot more roasty and nutty, and I really enjoy it a lot when it's like that, it just seems to vary from batch to batch and this batch was a sweet one."

"Drinkability- pretty good scotch ale, I would have it again."
""
"Overall not too bad but I don't feel the need to buy it again."
"Overall Impression- A very nice, clean Scottish ale that suited the style well! Lucky to have tried something from this brewery while I was in the airport during a layover. Highly suggest this beer!"

"O - simple yet good. Considering everything else I have seen readily available to me as I have not been seeking out craft bee, this is the best option. Easy to drink."

"O – As a “Scottish Style Ale” it’s kind of a fail, as there isn’t really much peaty taste I normally associate with the style. But as simply a beer, it’s pretty darn good, with no major flaws. Bonus point for being by far the best craft option on tap at many a bar and restaurant in Arizona."
"While on a work trip to Tempe, AZ recently we tried Kilt Lifter by Four Peaks and loved it. Kilt Lifter goes well with traditional pub grub. It looks nice and smell nice as well. It has a very good drinkability. I would order Kilt Lifter again in the future."

"for a scottish ale, this is outstanding - not exactly my favorite type of beer since they do tend to be pretty bland, but this is one of the best of its style."

"O: This is a very solid Scottish ale, and you really don't see too many of these on the market. Seek it out."
"Mouthfeel is thickish and slightly sticky. Overall, I'm glad I picked it up."
""
""
"Four Peaks Kiltlifter Scottish Ale: I got to try a bottle of this brew at a conference in Phoenix. Deep amber color, thin head and little aroma. The flavor brings malt notes to the fore, and not much else. Feels a little thin for a Scottish Ale. This is a decent offering to partake if you are in the area. May as well support the local brew. It does not set the Scottish Ale world on fire, however."
""
""
""
"This one is all malt but isn't too sweet -- the flavors come together nicely."
""
""
""
""
"O: This certainly doesn't lift my kilt."
""

"Had a bottle from AJ's in Tucson. This is just a nice, clean Scottish ale with mild caramel and a touch of roast. The aroma, like the flavor, is all malt, but with more of a bready bent to it. The softer caramel taste rolls over your tongue with a lighter carbonation and a very slight herbal, earthy edge. I wouldn't call it peaty, but it's close. Worth a try."
""

"Mouthfeel is pretty good. I find it pretty clean and crisp, probably the cleanest Scottish Style Ale I've ever had. Pretty drinkable . Overall it's pretty tasty. I like Scottish Ales and was happy to get a can of this. Thanks huadog for the sweet extra!"

"Another great beer offered at Four Peaks. It has a rusty amber color to it, and always hits the spot. The smell is consistent with an amber Scottish ale, and the taste is exactly what you'd expect from a Four Peaks beer. Rich and flavorful, and a bit of hoppiness to it, but not too much."
"D/O: This is a fairly tame contribution to the style, notably but appropriately lacking in hop qualities. It offers a level of compatibility with other flavors that really shouldn't be surprising in a malt-focused beer of normal strength."
"Overall: I'm lucky to live in Arizona, with so many quality beers made in recent years. This one is the Four Peaks Flagship, I think, and deservedly so. To think I can buy 12-packs of this deliciousness at the QuickTrip on the way home, too. Hooray."
"Russet amber color; bubbly head reaches high. Sweet toasted malt aroma of brown bread, doughy biscuits and treacle. No doubt this brew has some body to it—the smoothness runs just as deep as the body is thick. Full malt jacket wraps around the taste buds with toasted, sweet and grassy flavors. Hops in the back stay in the back, even while providing some balance. Sweet malty finish with a hint of alcohol. This malt bomb kills it, brewed to style, and is quite quaffable for the body size and strength."
""
"Poured an amber color, finger width head. Roast malt and buttery nose. Awfully light taste for what I was expecting. Malty finish. Mouthfeel was very thin, unfortunate. Overall it was a good beer, I just wish it ran a little thicker."
""
""
"Pours an transparent amber with a creamy, finger-deep head, minimal lacing. Carmaal-sweet odor with a hint of hops at the end. Very smooth mouth feel and easy to drink. Alcohol content is unnoticeable under the sweet, caramel taste. First time tasting this local beer and won't be the last."
"Fairly rich and highly drinkable. I'd call it more of an American Amber, though it's less bitter than many in that style. It's OK on tap, though I would prefer the more carbonated bottle version. On tap at the Bass Pro Shops restaurant in the deep suburban expanse of what might be Scottsdale."
"A ubiquitous AZ beer that always hits the spot. . . Pours a clear amber with creamy head, little lacing. Smells is of sweet caramel, and upon tasting is complimented by a touch of hop character and ends with some alcohol warmth. Overall very smooth, drinkable, and delicious."
"Caramel (deep golden orange) in color, clear, with a white head that dissipated quickly. Very nice color. Aroma of sweet, toasted, and caramel malts. The flavor is very similar to the aroma with the addition of a subtle smoky flavor. Four Peaks' description of this Kilt Lifter is spot on with what I tasted. Medium bodied with an effervescent mouth feel. It finishes with some sweet malt and smokiness. Very drinkable."
"Overall: It was ok, compared to the rest of the line up that day it was way be hind, but on its own, not bad."
"Kilt-lifter has floral notes in the odor, and a pleasant although misleadingly bland flavor after smelling. It would be nice if it had a bit more hops in it, and the carbonation is weak although adequate. I like this beer overall, but at 7.50 USD I think I can do better. However, for a local AZ brew it is not bad, as there are not that many good brews created here."
"Beer is medium in body and has a nice finish to it. Beer is sweet, clean finish, mild graininess through the beer but this was a staple of mine in college. It is fun when a blast from your past. Beer is seriously drinkable and has a great, subtle, candy / toffee flavor that makes me want more. All the beers I grew up on have such horrible reviews on beeradvocate, people no longer know what good beer tastes like."
"I am missing dark malts on this brew, has a lighter, caramely aspect. This is like an Amber Ale with a British twist. Yeast throws off lots of fruity esters. It is strangely enjoyable though, and easy to quaff. Creamy mouthfeel is nice. Forgettable, but certainly not regrettable."
"Overall I am not a huge fan of this taste, but I am pretty sure this one is more spot on the flavor profile for it's style than many of the East Coast IPA's I have had recently. I mean at least Scotland is across the pond and is excused for using European hops and yeasts when recreating the brew. Thanks to SpiderMonkey for this sample."
"O: Meh. Wasn't the my favorite. I haven't had that many Scottish ales but can name several better than this."
"The CPJ"
"Toffee and caramel malt flavors, followed by a toasty/breadiness that matches the smell. Plenty of sweetness all the way through. Medium bodied, extremely smooth velvety mouthfeel. When looking at it in the glass, it seems like medium carbonation, but the cask conditioning is apparent in the feel."
"D- Overall, a delicious thirst-quenching brew that would easily serve as liquid bread. Very full-flavored and satisfying, but also accessible to craft newcomers."
"Would I buy more of it? - I need to get myself a mixed-pack of Four Peaks beers. Combining this with their Kolsch and IPA and I think you've got the makings of quite the weekend."
"D: A pleasant--though simple--scotch ale (maybe not quite to style, however); nothing mind blowing here but pleasant and quite drinkable"
"My overall impression of the beer was average, but it had hints of promise. Although not a traditional scottish style ale in my opinion it did have some interesting aspects. The malts created some interested flavors which I would love to explore again. This beer is average is a bottle, but might be a completely different experience from the tap."
"Feels like they were a bit timid in the process. Probably due to the proximity to a college campus, they wanted to make a beer with more mass appeal. Still worth a try."
"A fairly mellow but solid enough Scottish style ale, and pretty true to style. I'm a little surprised this only rates a B. Perhaps a little dryer than most, but still enjoyable. Pours copper with a fairly thin head. Smells nicely malty, and a little nutty with the smell of toasted oats. Nicely balanced in the taste, with slightly chewy malt, restrained earthy and spicy hops, some dry graininess on the finish, and a touch juicy in the middle. I enjoyed this."
"My first pint had a low level of acetaldehyde, which really put me off. I'm not finding that tonight, which definitely increases my enjoyment of the beer."
"D: overall this makes for a great drinker.."
"D/O- CAN a CAN increase drinkability? I think so in Four Peaks Kilt Lifter's case. You wouldn't guess it's 6.2%abv...drinks like a macro with some decent flavor."
"Pours clear brown with no head, laces nice but falls away quickly. Smells malty, rich malty and strong alcohol. Tastes good with nice rich malty flavors, alcohol that i smelled is not so prevelant in tasting. Sweet tastes up front that fall away to a dry caramel finish. Pretty good for this style, a little on the lighter side than other styles. But i could see how this would fit right into the warm arizona climate down here."
"3.5/3/3/3.5/3"
"D: I'm not sure I've ever done more than one, but so many people I know drink this all the time that I have to yield to them on this."
"One of the better local Arizona beers. This is a great beer. I had a pitcher at the brewery. It went very well with my dinner. It pours a nice golden amber color. THe aroma is delicious and smelled fresh, obviously brewed wih clean and clear water. The carbonation was average and the taste a bit sweet, which left a nice aftertaste on my pallette. A very good beer indeed. Definitely one of the better local AZ beers I have had."
"Overall I thought this was a solid and easy-drinking beer for the style but it's nothing for which I'd clamor to have again. Worth a shot to see for yourself."
"D: Easy to drink and really enjoyed being able to try this several times."
"D- easy to drink, the exact opposite of hoppiness"
"This is pretty inoffensive, it seems accessible to non-beer geeks. There could be a lot more going on with the style, and even with this beer. It seems like they used plenty of malt but it just didn't shape up."
"D - This was above my expectations. It was a beer you could drink. Maybe not session. But more than just sip or sample. I had a couple cans and liked it more on the second can than the first. It would pair well with BBQ."
"The Kiltlifter was a dark carmel in color with a small to non existent head but there was plenty of carbonation in the flavor. Flavor had a combination of light smoke, dark malt, subtle hops....in general very well balanced. Overall this is a very good Scottish and was my beer of choice even over some less interesting pale ales."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The color is a moderate brown with a bit of slight haze. The nose is some light caramel, toffee, bread, and hints of dark fruits. The taste is along similar lines with a bit of brown sugar and molasses. Light date flavors and caramel. Good body and everything lends well to the flavor. Drinks pretty well, but nothing too special about it."
"Nice. Very easy drinking."
"Once in my mouth, this Scottish-Style Ale attempted to make up for the lack of nose by warming my entire body after each sip. So this is what 6% ABV feels like! I dig it. After my initial surprise at the quick warmth spreading through my chest, I found I enjoyed the light body with lots of carbonation doubled with a spiciness that snagged at my taste buds with each swallow. It did end a little dryer than I would have liked, but it also cut back on any aftertaste, which is always fine with me. I don't know why, but I just can't seem to handle aftertastes well. The pleasant spice was dutifully accommodated by a smooth swish of caramel, smoky malt, and that unnameable fruit."
"Not too bad overall. I wouldn't seek this out or even purchase again if I had the chance. Just OK"
"Drinks: like a classic. This one's Four Peaks' best seller, and it's easy to see why. A little light on flavor, but eminently drinkable."
"Noticably more enjoyable tonight than what I remembered. I say go for it."
"Brown with copper highlights, minimal head and lace. Slightly sweet smelling, malts and a bit of flowery honey. Taste has the same malty sweetness, not much hops, pretty decent for the style. Tastey brew, worth having another, always will support a local brew if I have the option."
"D: A real nice little beer. Malty and delicious. This is as common as BMC in the Phoenix metro area and clearly superior."
"Drinkability - Good beer with a good balance. I could see myself coming back to this one a few times."
"Drinkability: This is the reason why you'll drink this beer. You can easily drink 3 or 4."
"A solid flagship offering even if a bit thin for the style. Reminds me of some nice ambers with a dash of smokyness. Seems pretty spot on for a lighter version of the style, which is welcomed by me as I am not big on Scottish Ales."
"I'm liking this one more and more as I drink them. The first one didn't impress me too much. Pours a light orange with about a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet malt and a hint of hops. Like I said, the first one didn't impress me, but I'm really partial to darker stouts and porters. This one took a bit of getting used to, but I'm really starting to enjoy it. The flavor is a really sweet malty, bready flavor, A hint of bitterness, which I take for the 6% alcohol. It also has a really subtle smokey flavor which I think must be the peat that people have mentioned. It has a fairly large amount of carbonation, but I think it fits this one. I'm enjoying it, and if it's still early, I'll have another. I work tomorrow..."
"Overall, this is a solid beer with good components but nothing that really stands out in particular. Just a bit above average."
"Pours a transparent orange brown color with a small white head that quickly dissipates to nothing more than a fine ring along the edge of the glass. Sweet caramel malt and possibly cherry in the nose. Coating and sweet but not to the point of annoyance, a good and balanced American made interpretation of the style. A slight sour twang late on the finish is my only complaint and its a small one at that."
"D: Had some trouble finishing this brew if it were not for some roasted penuts on the side. Maltiness with some yeast tired me out."
"Drinkability: Jorge hyped this one up quite a bit; and while it didn't live up to that hype, this was still an enjoyable experience. If I lived in Arizona, I'd happily buy six packs of this to support the local economy."
"Notes: This is not the best example of a Scottish Ale, but certainly popular with the locals and is a great gateway beer for the masses."
"Still, I'll have some from the tap at Four Peaks next time I'm in Arizona...."
"The beer pours orange copper with a large, off-white head. the aroma is very sweet, with some caramel and apple notes. The flavor is caramel, apple, sweet malt and some other fruits including cherry. No real smoke or peat character. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation."
"Enjoyed at the Scottsdale location, brewed of course at Tempe brewpub. Their very popular but merely serviceable beer has a dark yellow coloured body and a white head with white lace. Their is light smoke in the aroma and more in the taste. Average mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Overall: A good example of the style with no major flaws, but not outstanding. Worth the money and the time, but not a beer I would seek out again. I am drinking it with a fluffy and wholesome piece of bread spread with butter... a good combination!"
"D; A drinkable beer, which is important to success in a college town where kids expect to quaff rather than appreciate. This beer definitely reflects a house flavor, though, which is generally subtle but inoffensive. I'm drinking it now because I bought it, but I long for a Belhaven."
"The bartender poured this one into a glass for me, and it was a nice rich caramel color, but no head to speak of. Smelled of malt and caramel, and that's pretty much what it tasted like, with some butterscotch thrown in. A pleasant flavor, even if this isn't my favorite style. Fairly drinkable, though I don't think I'd have more than two."
"This beer is not very enjoyable, and sadly it's par for the course when it come to Arizona microbrews. A good Scottish Ale deserves more flavor, while this brew has been made for the masses. I would like to buy more local beers, but beers like this remind me of why I have to look elsewhere..."
"D: Okay. Could use some more carbonation and would taste a bit better without the medicine like component. Just Okay overall."
"Serves a nice red amber without much of a head, but minimal lacing. Not much in the way of aroma, maybe a hint of malt and subdued hops but nothing stands out. Taste on par with the smell, subtle malty notes and just the faintest whisper of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is kinda thin and unsubstantial, but drinkability is great. I could see myself throwing back a few of these if it was the only decent brew on tap."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear rich amber color with about a finger of tight off white foam. No lacing to mention. Smells and tastes of medium toasted grain, nice and malty with a good amount of caramel, mild smokiness, and biscuits. Medium in both body and carbonation. Glad to have had the chance to try this one."
"Calor is a dark amber color with a small off white beige colored hear. Good lacing. Aroma is all caramel malt with just a touch of smokiness. No hop aroma. Flavor is also that of caramel malt and a little bit on the sweet side, could use a little bit more hop bitterness to balance the beer. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Not the best Four Peaks beer but not the worst either."
"Drinkability was good and the mouthfeel was medium bodied. A nice beer."
"D - To me this is an ok beer the style isn't my favorite but compared the the other beers from the style I've had this doesn't fit too well with them try it if you want"
"All in all, if I'm eating a nice greasy dinner and there's not a lot of variety on tap, this is a decent choice."
"D: Not a great version of the style compared to others I've tasted, but it's an easy sipping 6% pint nonetheless. Wouldn't rush to get more (I tried other brews from Four Peaks I liked better) but I'd have again and recommend for a try."
"Drinkability: yes, very much so. A definite recommendation."
"Poured a copper color with a small head but that is all that was going for it. Nose is off, not real convincing. Lots of caramel malts. Taste is caramel malts and seemed to be the only real taste to distinguish this beer. Taste was below average, nose was decent and mouthfeel was to light for a scottish."
"Tap @ Patsy Grimaldi's. Served a little cold, so the rating probably suffered a bit. Poured hazy orange-gold with a short white head. Minimal lacing. Caramel and butterscotch nose with some earth. More cake batter than peat in this one. Solid, firm motuhfeel, some stickiness, long finish. Nice, sweet maltiness that lingers. Again, caramel and butterscotch dominate, with no real hop presence. Kind of like drinking a snickerdoodle cookie."
"D - I enjoyed the one bottle sample I had but now it's time to move on."
"D - nice overall beer. I'd imagine this is a nice draft beer in the local AZ area"
"Drinkability: Thanks, but no thanks. This is unacceptably bland! The things that pass for an ""award-winning flagship ale"" these days. Yeesh."
"Sampled out of the bottle on a hot ass day in Scottsdale, AZ. Poured out a clear, copper color with some hints of amber. Khaki head about a finger thick, good lacing and good retention too. Fine lookin' drink. The aromas were peat-smoked malt, caramel malt and some alcohol. The flavors were toasted malt with some of the peat up front, then an earthy character followed by some herbal hops. Carbonation is a little lively at first but it settled down to be pretty drinkable and rather smooth. For my first beer from this state I was happy, But not impressed."
"Overall- Aside form the alc. being a little ""fumey", pretty good. You'll be feeling this 1 after about 3! (Thanks Dana!)"
"Despite the flaws that I see in this beer, it's not as bad as what I make it sound; I'm not having any problem drinking up so I guess I'm getting ""used"" to what this brew in my glass is all about. ;^)"
"Kudos to Four Peaks for creating a Scottish ale that straddles the line between Scottish ale and Scotch/wee heavy. I wish they had done a little more with it, though. Less earthiness and more peat-smoked malt would be good places to start. Thanks to tayner for the toss-in."
"Not a bad brew but thin in the body. I feel like this one could have something else to it to make it more interesting. Worth trying but buy a single not a sixer."
"On cask, it's a reasonably authentic Scottish-style ale. Not necessarily tops of the style, but what you can expect to find on a tap in the U.K.: malt-driven, light-bodied, minerally, and warm."
"Prosit, MK"
"I could and would enjoy multiples of this beer if need be in a session, it is both smooth and satisfying."
"The flavor was a nice blend of zesty hops, allspice, dark, toffee malts, and a kiss of alcohol. Nothing was too overbearing, here, and a balance was nicely attained. The brew was a bit overcarbonated, but the medium body left a nice spicy bite on the end. This beer sits a bit heavily on the stomach, but for a Scottish Ale, I enjoyed it about as much as one could."
"All in all, a decent brew. Would be good with a burger or even pizza, but I don't think I would pair it with Haggis (Granted, I don't think I would eat Haggis)."
"Not my favorite, but not the worst I've ever had."
"D- Super scottish ale with big malt profile that is well-balanced and one of the most drinkable I've ever had, I probably drank this more than any other craft beer while I lived in Arizona, so I am a bit biased."
"Again, tastes almost like a mild ale, save the full mouthfeel. As it warms, more of the caramel and peat flavors come out, but so does a somewhat unpleasant flavor that I usually associate with oxidation. Maybe I taste the peat on the finish, but it could just be suggestion. It's very drinkable, though, especially considering its higher-than-average ABV. A decently tasty ale -- not a bad offering from this brewery, which is new to me. Looking at their website makes me want to hunt down their Hopsquatch barleywine..."
"The mouthfeel is well done - smooth and velvety. Not a quaffer (but what scotch ale is), but given the rather low abv of this for style, it is not as drinkable as I would expect."
"Drinkability is good. This is a nice ale, easy to put down even with the 6.2% ABV."
"Not a favorite of mine and will not bother to purchase it again!"
"D: Very drinkable, this is a great sipping ale with the wonderful smoked malt body."
"I'll by it again, if in the area, but I don't think I'd make it my regular beer (if I lived here)"
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin as well. Coats the mouth well and the flavor lingers. I thought this was going to be over carbonated but it didn't show up as I expected. Decent drinkability...definately easy to put back but nothing outstanding that would keep me coming back."
"Drank very easy, nice take on the style & loved the subltleness of the smokey peat flavor. Finding this & old monkey shine was the highlight of my trip to AZ!"
"D-i enjoy this beer. it is easy to drink and since it's brewed locally, it's easy to find it just about anywhere in bottles or on tap."
"I hope if a try a pint on another occasion it won't be watery as some reviewers have experienced. This pint is full-bodied and silky smooth."
"D- dry, but smooth, very drinkable, a good brew, nothing extraordinary, something to drink while watching a ball game"
"This brew will likely be in one of my future sessions. I would like to thank my in-laws for picking this up on vacation in AZ."
"Thanks to Solomon420 for the desert treat."
"Attractive copper color, with nice consistency. Tan colored head, good retention. Sweet malty aroma. Could be imagining things but I think I smell a little caramel. Taste has nice hoppiness at finish. This medium bodied beer has a clean crisp feel, very enjoyable. One of the most drinkable beers I've had."
"This Scottish Ale is just too soft spoken and flawed for me to want to drink this again (or any more). If the maltiness was louder and firmer, I think, many of the problems would be solved. Nevertheless, thank you Uncle Rick & Aunt Kathy for shipping me this beer from AZ. This is my finial review from the beers you sent. Thanks for all of them."
"A good drink."
"D- Very tasty, but the flavors in here are too sweet to be sessionable. Maybe keep this one a round, if not, it is a treat to have every now and then."
"Very drinkable, a staple."
"Dark orange/reddish with a good sweetish/bready nose. Head is creamy and sticks around. Taste is very smooth and pleasing with a satisfying grain aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is on the low side. I find it hard to describe scottish ales. They generally remind me of a less robust oktoberfest. This one seems faithful to the style and a generally good 'anytime' beer."
"This doesn't quite beg for another sip, but it is a very enjoyable brew all around. I'm glad I got to try another small local beer from somewhere else."
"I have really come to love the Scotch ale style. Four Peaks does a good rendition of this malty, rich tipple. Who knew a desert brewer could make this weighty style work. Maybe it was the fact that I had spent 8 plus hours hiking in the desert, maybe it was the wonderful desert air but this brew was silky, smooth, malty and delicious. This brew paired nicely with a chicken caesar...I was in heaven. rich deep brown color with notes of chocolate and caramel...a slice of heaven in a pint glass."
"The beer empties from the 12-ounce brown bottle a clear deep copper color, the head piles high on the body, its texture semi-creamy, the color a winsome light tan, with its demise the lace forms a nice concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, hints of caramel, fresh, crisp, and clean to the senses, start is mildly sweet, the grain profile pleasant, the top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a benign carbonation, the hops perfect in their modest spiciness, the aftertaste dry and long lasting, what else can you say but its a darn good drinking beer, and worth a sample."
"The label reads ""smooth full bodied Scottish ales"". Smooth it is not. Further ""with the slightest hint of peat-smokey barley"". This I can believe. That might explain some of the clovey sting. Md-light body with moderate carbonation. I enjoyed the experience of this beer, but wouldn't seek out another. It just doesn't fit the bill for my sweet malty loving palette. I can, however, think of many fans of belgian beer that I think would love this beer."
"Pint at a restaurant in Tempe."
"There is also a nice level of hop bitterness in this beer that adds just enough bite in the finish to help balance the malt. I also think that some of the fruitiness found in this beer is from the flavor hops used. This is a nicely quaffable brew, and it has a fair amount of complexity for a beer of this strength."
"It's ok, dog."
"Pours a orange-brown color with a decent but not long-lasting head. Smell is of muted malts. Taste is of sweet caramel malts and a hint of biscuity grain. Mouthfeel is very smooth, thick, and lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is good. This is a great session beer for before ball games or happy hour with friends."
"Overall impression: Very drinkable session beer. Nice solid flavors, nothing outstanding, but certainly nothing to turn me off the beer either."
"Clear amber body with a tall cream colored head. Some light lacing was left. Sweet caramel malts stand out over a light fruitiness. A bit of smoke is in the back as well. Taste starts of with more sweet caramel, a touch of fruit and a light roastiness. Very malty all around as expected though a bit of a lighter flavor. Ends on a sweet caramel note. About medium with a creamy feel. Easy drinking stuff and it doesnt come off as overly sweet. Thanks to Secret Bunny 05 and nvsblman for this tasty treat."
"Slightly hazy, color was orange-light amber with an off-white head that poured like it was very carbonated. Head dissipated slowly but wasn't terribly rocky or dense. Aroma was mildy malty, perhaps a bit underwhelming. Flavor was great - malty sweet, maybe even a bit too sweet - the malt character struck me as perhaps non-Scottish (different than like Golden Promise), but good, and indeed the label said its North American malt. No matter - this is tasty and delicious. Mere touch of hops keeps it from being cloying. Nice full body and high drinkability. Thanks Secret Santa 2004 nvsblman!"
"This poured with a hearty head of creamy tan foam. Super carbonated and slightly hazy orangey gold in color. Sweet lemony notes rises from the glass. Hidden deep behind that are touches of dark molasses and sweet malts and a chocolate peatiness that borderlines wet musty cardboard. The taste is surprisingly effervescent and refreshing. This beer really makes me belch  and I mean that in a good way. The high carbonation almost makes the beer seem creamy. Spritzy and velvety going down. Whoa! The second pour turned out to be a bit of an explosion. My cup runneth over! Sweet and tangy with black licorice notes. Overall, an interesting beer, with some unique flavors. I liked it."
"I ended up having two pours -- mainly because the bartender misheard me and I wouldn't let the beer go to waste, otherwise I would have sampled another brew."
"Copper. Moderately aromatic, with scents of herbs, grass, smoke and toasted malts. Flavor is very similar to the aroma with an added hint of caramel, toffee, wood, smoke and vanilla. Toasted malts are very evident. Very sweet for the style. Very light in nody. Mediocre."
"Very pleasent, highly drinkable brew, recomend it to anyone"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" of slightly off-whitish head, which provides slight lacing. Clear amber in hue, with a malty, somewhat smoky aroma, and something else that escapes me but seems odd. Flavor is a showplace of medium malts such as caramel, with a smoky twist, which makes it distinctive. Mouthfeel is smooth, and its nice to have a smoke flavor that isn't all about the smoke, but rather an accompaniment to the beer's already present flavors. Very nice Scottish style ale."
"Comments  A big thanks to Gusler for sending this one up to Seattle."
"My final beer exchange from Tempe Az. My first impression was a stricking appearance of a clean dark amber brew with a fair sized off white head. The aroma was sweet toffee and caramel. That aroma is reflected in the taste as well as a malty smoked barley with a background of earthy hop. The mouth is left slightly sweet. an all around good scottish style thats drinkable with most any meal or as a sweet dessert offering. Thanks mrpicklerelish, I look to find others from Four Peaks."
"Cloudy amber pour, malty sweet aroma, nice slightly carmel taste, very satisfying mouthfeel, although the flavors aren't real bold, its hard to find any fault with this brew, the sweetness lingered nicely to the end. i will definitely get a 6'er of this if I have the chance."
"Dark amber color, medium head. Aroma is fruity with a touch of smoke. Malty flavor, nearly smoky, somewhat sweet. Medium bodied ale. Nice smooth smoky flavor as per a scotch ale. Mouthfeel is round and full. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet."
"I was really surprised by the flavor. It's malty, w/ a definitely creamy mouth feel. I could detect a slight hint of smokiness in the taste. I enjoyed this one."
"Thanks go to Gusler for providing."
"Pours a clear, golden amber in color with a fast fading off-white head. I'm left with a thin collar of foam in almost no time at all. Aroma is earthy and malty. There is a smoked graininess there too. Taste is sweet malts and an alcohol warmth. There is a mild hop bitterness to add a little balance to the mix. I'm picking up an almost smoked meat quality too. Finishes on the dry side. Average body & slightly undercarbonated but overall fairly drinkable. My thanks to Gusler for the trade."
"A bit mellow and understated for the style, Kiltlifter tasted more like an 80 Schilling than a Wee Heavy. After a bit of contemplation, I guess that Four Peaks may well have been shooting for that style. In either case, I thought the beer was slightly over-carbonated, slightly uncomplex and all around an average experience. Kiltlifter tasted more like a Maibock than anything Ive had out of Scotland lately Id drink this beer again if I were in Arizona, but only after I confirmed that Mogollon was unavailable."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange-amber with a short and foamy bone-white head that dissipates shortly. The nose expresses a sweet malt and a touch of smoke. The body is medium with a fine and restrained carbonation that leaves it lightly creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is exactly as the aroma indicates with a sweetish, honeyish malt that has a thread of peat-smoked character running through it. There's some minor hop flavor in there as well, but it's character is hard to pin down... it's somewhat floral and a touch leafy (the bottle lists Goldings and that appears to match up). It finishes drying with a short lingering residual maltiness and a touch of residual hop flavor. I'm not sure where it would rank in the Scottish / Scotch Ale category. It's loaded with sweet malt, but not nearly enough to fit the 110 -/- or Scotch Ale style; and yet a bit too full to be an 80 -/-. Regardless, it's an interesting and enjoyable beer with poor head retention being it's only drawback. They've brought on a new brewer who was at Alaskan for a few years, and they've also acquired a ""real"" bottling line (to replace their Meheen) so I'm looking forward to trying their beers again soon!"
"An amber brew with a small head that dissipates quickly.  Lots of points lost in the head department since it completely disappears after a while.  Roasted grain in the aroma, coffee and chocolate.  Smells like a porter in a way.  Caramel and peat in the nose as well, letting you know that this is a Scottish ale.  The flavor is more impressive, spicy and sweet peatiness with a bit of the roasted grain from the nose.  Caramel malt has a big presence.  Coats the tongue with sweetness as this style should.  Not the best Scottish ale I've ever had, I would prefer more body and richness, but it's certainly a good try at the style and is highly drinkable."
"What can I say, it's not often you find a scottish ale at a brewpub.  Apart from the absence of a head of any sort, which might have been due to bar glassware, this is a very solid beer.  Tasty and drinkable."
