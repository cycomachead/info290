It takes a bit of swirling to coax a malty aroma from this brew, where there appears to be a bit of caramel sweetness. Very dry compared to the majority of Scottish Ales I've had. Not much going on flavor wise, but this is possibly due to age (purchased 6 months ago, stored refrigerated). Mouthfeel is where this beer shines.

It poured a dark brown, clear with very small head to it. Excellent carbonation with a nice mouthfeel to it. I find it on the thin side in taste, as I was hoping for a more robust beer. However, It definitely has roasty malt overtones. Its good if you just want to sit back and watch some TV, but I am not a huge fan.","agirlandherpen","Dec 19, 2011"

Taste of caramel malts, Mary Janes, and some indistinct fruit. Not bad, but a little weak overall, in flavor, body, and in alcohol.

The flavors are in balance, but the overall presentation of the beer left me wanting for something. I personally just think that they are either just using the wrong yeast strain, or their mash temp is just too low. The beer has a good flavor, but it leaves me thinking that something is missing.","SkeeterHawk","Jul 28, 2008"

The beer poured a clear amber color with a slight tan head that lingered a bit but gave way to a slight ring on the end of the glass. The aroma was of sweet malt and a touch of creaminess. The taste was mainly malty, creamy and sweet but with a touch of hop bitterness to round things out and make for a solid and easy drinking ale.","ggaughan","Apr 27, 2007"

3.44,-8,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a creamy 3/4"" light tan head above the clear coppery brown brew. Head fades slowly, popped bubble by popped bubble, with lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is minimal, little to anything good or bad here. Taste is lightly peaty malts with a light hoppy close that lingers. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both likable. Not a bad brew here.","ppoitras","May 08, 2006"
3.18,-15,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Very mellow beer. Makes me think more of a brown ale in flavor. Slightly burnt malts. Burnt biscuits. Bit of peat too. Molasses and brown sugar. Medium body. Seems to tingle on the palate--kind of odd. Slightly dry.","MuddyFeet","Apr 10, 2006"
3.46,-7.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle. Laughing Lab Scottish Ale pours out a dark brown color with a huge, off-white head. Sweet aroma with some fruit, but there is a definite cardboard aroma that isn't pleasant. The flavor is sweet, with the caramelized sugar flavor typical of the style. Just a bit fruity. Finishes with a cocoa flavor and a touch of hops. Good balance. This beer is almost very good. It has a nice flavor, but it doesn't taste as fresh as it should, and I don't think my bottle is particulary old. I would love to try a fresh bottle to see.","beveragecaptain","Mar 30, 2006"

Smell is somewhat lacking as I don't really smell much of anything, maybe a very slight sweetness. Taste is sweet at first with an earthy/mossy aftertaste. The smell of this beer becomes more apparent the more you drink of it for some reason. Still a sweet/malty smell. Mouthfeel is good although there is very little carbonation this beer goes down good. Overall not a bad scottish style but I've had tastier ones than this.","loren01","Sep 04, 2005"

3.8,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Tastes of baking powder bisuits with a dash of cocoa, and a smack on the tongue with a cedar plank. I'm thinking of the last sensation of a salmon filet when it's stuffed into a smokehouse, right before it's smoked beyond recovery. This would be good by the pitcher with smoked salmon, dill mayo, pickled things and rye bread and lightly sweetened whole wheat crackers. It's got a nutty aftertaste.","gbontrag","Mar 05, 2005"

3.38,-9.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Dark rust, somewhat clouded, barely a head appeared but what did, stayed on top awhile, very minimal spotty lace. Aroma is faint of burntish toffee, a bit buttery with some slight earthyness of peat moss or wet wood. Taste is bit bland with some slight roasty factions in the start which linger throughout. Some slight hops of herbalness and pale leafyness makes its way towards the finish. Feel is a bit empty in the middle, start is mildly roasted and ends a bit dry and buttery with slight nut shades. Overall feel in body is thin, but some of the flavors keep it going somewhat to make it worth drinking, but its pretty average for a Scottish Ale.","tavernjef","May 30, 2004"
3.47,-7.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Pours a nice-looking deep reddish brown with a small, creamy head. Very nice aroma of roasted malt, toffee, oak, and a light whiff of smoke. Slightly sweet and sticky up front, with notes of toffee and treacle, balanced by a robust malt profile. Finishes with a sweet, oaky flavor that lingers in the back of the mouth. A little sweeter than I tend to prefer in a scottish ale, without the hops. Nevertheless, a decent offering.","ElGordo","May 14, 2004"
