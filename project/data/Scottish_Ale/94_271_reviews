"Overall: Solid winter offering. This bottle was kind of old and also fell out of the refrigerator prior to serving so conditions were less than optimal. Not sure they still make this one - a little bummed if they don't."

"I popped the cap and let fly, watching breathlessly as the pseudo-cascade took place, slowly morphing into two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. Color was a brownish-copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich and sweet with malt - caramel, cocoa, toffee. Oh my. There are times that I question my buying habits because as a hophead, this is not in my wheelhouse. The head fell in an unusual way, collapsing down and in on itself. Mouthfeel was medium and the richness of the malt almost threw me into diabetic shock! It was tasty, though, more like toffee than caramel. Finish was sweet, but not cloying, so I did not have any problem drinking all of it. This is one that would be more suited for the Winter season, if I were to get it again."

"Overall: I love this beer. Hibernator might be a slight exaggeration in the sense that this really isn't a ""heavy"" beer, but, it is most satisfying. Strong enough for winter but light enough for spring."

"o: Fortunately neither the initial hints of vinegar nor the medicinal tinge lasted. However, this ""Scottish Ale"" did not offer much other flavor.."

"The Rest: This one doesn't do a whole lot for me. Body is medium and carbonation is fine, but the aroma is slightly off-putting and the taste didn't really make up any ground. Drinkable but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I bought a 12-pack for my wife and I'm glad that she likes it, because I wouldn't really jump at the chance to have another one. Not a terrible beer, but just doesn't suit my tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Advertises as a good beer for a winter night. I agree, especially since better dark beers are a lot more expensive. Overall not a bad beer at all."
""
""

""

"Medium body with an early bumrush of carbonation. Works for drinkability. Booze never oversteps its boundary."

"Another good beer from Long Trail. This is a good company. Beer pours a massive 3 finger head with a sticky lacing all the way down the glass. Scents of peat and grassiness on the nose. Taste is medium bodied with a bit of unbalance, only drawback. It is an easy to drink beer and good enough to session. Not sure why it's classified as a winter beer, but Hibernator is a nice alt style beer, although classified as a scottish ale."

"O: Nice for a winters night for sure. Not great but worth a try."
""
""
"The aroma, of toffee, is mild, complementing a lightly sweet flavor that is rather hoppy for a Scottish ale. The taste and mouthfeel bespeak not so much deep autumn as Indian summer. Pleasant. Sessionable."

"Drinkable en masse, despite terrible style claim. It's a mild bock type thing. Drinkable and not terrible."
""
""
""
"Overall – Not bad. While the combination of flavors upfront was not too appealing, with somewhat off transitions, as the brew warmed more it took on a bit more sweetness allowing for a bridging of the flavors in a smoother transition."

"This is not a Scottish Ale, regardless of what Long Trail claims on the website. But I don't know what I would call it. Long Trail describes it vaguely as a malty, winter ale on the bottle, and this makes more sense. This is definitely quaffable, but it's not exceptional in any way. I don't regret buying a 6-pack that was on clearance for $6. Win."

"Hibernator pours a slightly hazy burnt orange. Maybe a finger of bone colored foam crowns the beer, and fades cleanly after a minute or two. The nose, while muted, has a nice complexity. Toffee, biscuits, and a tobacco aroma all make themselves known. The flavor profile leads off with malts that definitely lean more towards biscuit and bread than caramel and toffee. There's a sharp bitterness next that's entirely out of place. A subtle tobacco and herbs blend delivers the finish. The mouthfeel just lacks the fullness of body that I'd expect for a malty winter beer, though the carbonation is appropriately subdued. I don't often reach for Long Trail beers when I'm browsing at my local bottle shop, and this HIbernator isn't going to change my mind."
""
"Overall this was a solid brew and I enjoyed a few of them just to make sure. While not very complex or robust, this beer knows and serves its purpose well. Extremely approachable, sessionable and easy to drink, this is a definite safe option brew in macro-havens. Not a must-try by any means, but a solid choice when options are limited."
""
"Hazey orange hue looks as if there is a lot of yeast still in the mix. Bottle says unfiltered so I assume this is the reason. Almost homebrewish in appearance. smell is dominated by hop aroma. Can't taste sweetness. More crisp hoppy flavor that also has a bite of hops at the tail. I'm not really getting any spice either so for me this is not a preferred winter beer offering."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, vibrant, ruby coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy surface coating of head. Aromas of rich caramel, both sweet and smooth, a touch of hops bitterness, and some floral jasmine highlights. Very smooth and balanced aromas. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a scotch and caramel backbone that is sweet, but balanced. Malt profiles expound as the beer covers the palate, giving rise to some bready and molasses characteristics. Light bodied despite the rich flavors, and when combined with the lower ABV this beer becomes very drinkable. Sweet, slightly tart aftertaste with the hops presence resurfacing for a touch of bitter and spice to clean the palate. Crisp, clean finish with a touch of spice linger. Tasty brew."
""
""
""
"Not bad at all."
""
""
"A so-so ale and a descent Scottish, a bit bland ultimately. Interesting and worth a try as it goes down easy but presents a good body and a stronger flavor, but probably not something I'll return to in the future."
""
""
"To say it quickly, this beer is good. It looks by the label to be more of a 'winter' beer. But it isn't at all. It's not dark, or heavy, or has a distinct taste. But it is good, and I can see it being relatively easy to drink several of these. It's pretty neutral, so I can see IPA and Ale fans enjoying this...while those that like a darker and heavier fare try a few of those for a lighter alternative. Long Trail is a fine brewery that makes some great beers...this one probably ranks slightly above the median of its offerings. Enjoy!"

"Notes: Drank on 5/7/2012. 10/25/2011 stamped on the bottle, I assume this was the brewed-on date."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the malty inclusion, and the eventual complexity to the flavoring. While not all the flavors were necessarily well blended, that malty complexity of toffee, caramel, chocolate, and coffee all coming together was nice. We felt the nose to be a bit mild, and ultimately the beer need a bit more sweetness to fit the classic stylistic guidelines."

"Overall a good take on the scotch ale but one that's not for me. With the other had hitting winter warmers this one takes a backseat. I still find myself buying it though."
""
"Taste is straightforward with caramel malt leading the charge, decent creaminess, soft carbonation, toffee in the aftertaste, not much of a hop presence but it's not sorely missed with this beer, lightly spiced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was an interesting spin on a winter seasonal. I can’t say It followed the Scotch Ale style much, but it certainly had nice complexity and I’ll definitely look for it again. It was very similar to a Fordham Scotch Ale, only with a winter spice character."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with prickly carbonation. Overall this one is real solid. Well crafted and tasty for sure."
""
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped 112111-1732. Sampled on March 2, 2012. The pour is a slightlu cloudy medium amber with a silkly, fluffy light tan head. The aroma is full of caramel and other sweet malts. The body is smooth, creamy, and about medium. The flavor is fully malted up front with this delayed bitter hop bite toward the end. It ends clean. This is a nice beer."
""
""
""

""
""
"A good scotch ale and very drinkable. It would be better if there was more depth to it, but it's enjoyable regardless"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a quarter inch off-white head with short life. The body is a hazy amber/peach, almost a simple tea color. It smells simply of malt. And the taste is malt, too, with a slightly nutty aftertaste. The body is lightweight. There's an exceedingly long bitternut finish. Frankly I find this sample one dimensional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Goes down well and is a nice little brew"
""
""
"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a perfect pint. Served cool. Nice billowing toasted marshmallow head and a cola colored body. Grassy, metallic smell. Nice varied malt flavor. Sweet front. little hop bite in the middle. Sweet candies in there too. Medium carbonation and smooth. Good beer. I guess for a scotch ale I imagine some smoke. Don't get any here. But a good beer nonetheless."
""
"O-A winter warmer...what is that spice??"
"O-Not a bad beer. something you can have a few of and not get sick of. worth a try."
"This is a Scottish ale? Could've fooled me. A winter warmer, maybe. Poured into a stem glass, a darker amber color with a slight haze, and a nice cap of foamy white head that left some attractive lacing on the glass throughout the session. Aroma of sweet malts, slightly nutty. Sweet taste of malts, honey, brown sugar, bready, with light fruit notes, and some grassy hops. No real characteristics of any Scottish ale I've ever had, and a low ABV to boot. Still a nice beer overall. Medium-bodied, and went down pretty easy and smooth."
""
""
"Extremely well-balanced and warming without the overkill of some winter releases. This is a nice Scottish-style winter warmer to drink if you want to have more than one and don't want to get buzzed too quickly."
"Good fridge beer, but not particularly memorable."
""
"O: good for the style, awesome to me, always look forward to having this every winter"
""
""
""
""
"An okay winter ale, doesn't offer much beyond that, definitely improves with warmth."
""
""
"O-There is nothing off putting in this beer. However it has a bunch of malt and little else."
""
"Overall this is a great beer. Definitely my favorite from Long Trail."
""
"Call it a hybrid of a Scottish Ale, British Winter Warmer and hoppy Bockbier. Got me. I have another..."
"Overall: A supremely solid beer. I'm quite pleased knowing I've got five more of these. The carbonation is a tad much for my preference but all-in-all I totally dig this brew."
""
""
"Overall: This is a nice take on a winter beer. I would have liked just a touch more sweetness, but not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
" I really like the way this starts clean and as it progresses it becomes more expressive with light fruit tinges from the yeast blending with the slight toasted graininess in the malt profile. there is a hint of pepper with the mild accent of caramel malt in the mix. The taste of apple skins are noted with a mild piney flavor from the hops which are very tasty combined with the scottish yeast. Overall I really enjoyed this beer -so much flavor for a relatively low abv beer. The way it finishes is mostly dry yet clean in general without too much in the way of what counts - a nice balance of the yeast, malt and hop flavors."
"O- in the bottle it's good, on tap it's better."
""
"O-- overall i think this is a very drinkable winter ale. its a good everyday beer, nothing too special. but not a let down. i wasn't expecting a big beer with a thick body. and for the price. im pretty happy with it. 9 dollars a 12 pack. if anything its a good in between beer when trying a lot of other beers."
""
""
""
"O-- Long Trail's got a little ways to go here, but one thing's for sure: they picked grains that would make this beer look and smell excellent. Now, they just have to get that to the taste buds in a much stronger way. I'm sure those malts can come through much stronger, and when they do, those batches will be phenomenal. This is still a very good beer that I'd come back to next winter."
""
""
"O: I can't pick a winner here. Both descent Scottish Ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite from Long Trail but worth a try this winter."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, nice brew, i remember the flavors as more pronounced from previous years versions, but this is still one of my favorite long trail brews."
""

"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 091211. Pours a cloudy dark brownish mahogany color with minimal head. Good lacing. Aroma is slightly boozey with some malts and earthiness. Maybe some caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma. Some sweet alcohol flavor along with earthy malts. Hints of toffee. Medium bodied. Alcohol aftertaste. Pretty solid winter brew. Overall, I will look for this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden brownish reddish with a low off-white head. Low aroma of subtle malt and cracker. Flavor is malty upfront, biscuity, semi sweet, notes of toffee, nutty flavors, subtle caramel. Even mouthfeel, low carbonation. Overall a tasty easy drinker, not over the top, but a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Long Trail in my opinion makes good beers. Thier like a second tier brewery and they try hard but this is just an average scotch ale, pale ale,amber ale, whatever. I like this beer perhaps out of a tap in Vermont it would be better but today it's just average."
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth but leaves you wanting more. Not quite the umphh you'd expect from a winter seasonal. Overall, Hibernator is a enjoyable malt-forward beer for a cool winters evening but it lacks the strength to make it stand out in a crowded field of winter brews."
""
""
""
"a fantastic seasonal brew that i look forward to every year. recommended."
""
""
""
""
"D: one minute peat, one minute malty, the next a little bitter. good complexity on the body of this thing. a tasty winter brew that is perfect for the falling of the leaves. i wish there was a little more on the body here, but otherwise solid."
""
""
""
"Great beer but not exactly something id use to battle the cold months of winter. Definitely good though."
"O: a good scottish ale, though I have had few of the style, I enjoyed it"
"This is quite nice and at a decent price point. I guess I get the classification as a Scotch style."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will get more in the near future."
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color with a thin tan head on top. This beer has a malty sweet aroma with some earthy aromas too. The flavors of some light spice back up with some roasted malts and caramel. The mouthfeel of this beer is drinkable, it's not really thick and has a decent carbonation. Overall it's not a bad brew, it's got some warming spices in there that are nice but I'm had better Winter beers."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable winter beer. It is not too heavy, and the flavors work for the season."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are really nicely balanced, especially the spices. The slight hop presence is also very nice."
"O/D-Hibernator is not too shabby. Its hard to go into a store looking for a winter seasonal and not come out with Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. A six-pack of Hibernator won the battle once...only once."
"It may not be a true Scottish Ale. But I think this is one they got right - no matter what you call it."
"O: Overall the beer was very good. The beer balances sweet with hops very nicely, and leaves a nice aftertaste. I would highly recommend this beer to all drinkers. I think hopheads will be enjoy the amount of hops that come through in the end."
"This is a nice session beer, however, I would expect a bit more malt and a little less hops for this style."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark copper with one finger of off-white head with decent retention properties. Aromas are sweet (somewhat caramelly) and grainy, a bit simplistic for a beer of this style. Flavors are consistent with the nose, but add another layer on the finish by contributing a tea-like or earthy bitterness that balances the malts. Such a well-crafted, medium-full body should be more flavorful in my opinion. This beer has a pleasantly hefty weight and feel but lacks the flavor strength to withstand a hunk of basic cheddar. If the maltiness were more assertive, I'd give this two thumbs up."
"Going against the grain on this one. From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a partly hazy amber, off-white head. The flavor is sweet, brown sugar, malts, caramel, some earth. Malty, caramel aroma, brown sugar. The finish is an earthy, floral hop bittering. Thin/medium to medium in body. This beer didn't put together for me at all."
"Overall, I am disappointed with this beer. I had heard good things. It's not as rich or flavorful as I would have liked and I fell it has a rather weak body contrary to popular belief. By no means is this my favorite style of ale - but even so, I expected something that stands out. This beer seems rather bland to me."
"Drinkability: A decent and somewhat sessionable brew for the winter. Both a little hoppier and heavier than I expected originally, which turns out to not be a bad thing at all."
"I thought it was pretty good...the original taste had me question it but it won me over...a good winter beer and i recommend it"
"Hibernator is a good name for a doppelbock, which I thought this was when I picked up the bottle. When I tasted it I thought it was a hoppy amber. Now, I see that it's supposed to be a Scotch ale, and it might be a good one if the malt bill was beefed up."
"D: A nice winter ale from Long Trail. Brings a good malt punch in its moderate ABV package."
"D: The beer went down very smoothly; I would have no problem having more than one of these at a time."
"D-I wish it was a little maltier and richer, but overall a decent sessionable winter beer to enjoy since its so easy to drink."
"I'd say below average drinkability just because it seems a bit off."
"D - Overall, a tasty brew though I wouldn't call it overly special. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to a Belhavens. Another solid beer from Long Trail."
"This would be a good sessionable brew to get drunk off of, nothing to make you stand up and seek it out. But if the price were right it would be ok to session. Just not a stand out brew."
"medium bodied, medium carbed mouthfeel. goes down easy enough, just seems to me there are far better offerings to be had."
"D: Considering I've had 4 of them tonight...with 2 more lingering in the midst... I think this is one of the winter seasonals that went under the radar. Pretty good!"
"This is likely the most drinkable Scottish ale I have had, but it isn't very interesting. If you love Scottish ales but never have found one to crush, try this."
"Not bad, i wouldn't have guessed this as a scottish ale, but i thought it was pretty solid."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Pours a translucent amber with a frothy, half-inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually dissipates into a thin, fairly consistent skim, with a few slashes of lacing. Not much happening in the nose - I get some toasted malts off the bottle pop, but the aromas really dissipate in the glass - perhaps a medium-malt backbone with some earthiness, and a bit of berry or dark stone fruit. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a light, toasted character and a citrus quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a little bit of citrus astringency and a pleasant, even carbonation. A solid Scottish Ale - perhaps not as malty as I would prefer, and a bit on the simple side; however, quite an easy drinking brew. Definitely one of my more favored beers from their regular line-up."
"3.5 D: Not a bad drink if nothing better exists, but no reason to seek this out."
"Medium-full body, but still too thin. This is a sessionable scotch ale. Needs more smokiness, needs more strength. These could go down easy, but you can do better. Still, one of the better ones from this brewer"
"Great drinkability. This brew is great, and isn't overkill when it comes to scottish ales. Great job by Long Trail."
"D - Na their really isn't much to rave about this beer. It came off more like a red ale with the sweetness and really didn't seem like a winter sort of ale. Needs more body and maybe ABV."
"M/D: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very clean drinking. Overall its not bad. I would drink it again, but would prefer to try some others in the style to get a better handle of what a Scottish should be."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin but that leads to excellent drinkability."
"D - a good scottish ale, haven't had too many of these. good cold weather beer, would be great with a holiday dinner."
"D- I would think that this is a drinkable ale. Makes you want to be the bear on the label."
"Nice winter beer, really tasty."
"This is a pretty mediocre beer overall, but that doesn't make it unpleasant. I like a bit more body on a cold evening (hell ya I do), but this is a pretty easy drinker. This is basically one of those 'not bad for the price' beers."
"Taste is very malty and peaty with a nice sweet finish. There's a bit of a metallic taste but it's not too bad. Overall for a scotch it's a bit tame however that means it's real drinkable and good for people who haven't had the style too many times."
"D - Very drinkable malt-centric brew that doesn't forget the hops."
"HV"
"Long Trail Hibernator poored a dark amber color, with a small head. There wasnt a very strong smell, but it had a slight sweet smell to it. It tasted hoppy and almost had a slight sweetness to it. It didnt leave much of an aftertaste and was very easy to drink. Overall this beer was very good, its a shame its only a seasonal, but it is one of the better beers for winter."
"At this price point, not alot better out there in my opinion for this type of beer."
"D: Long Trail makes this one easy to drink and delicious at the same time. Not too strong or heavy and easy to keep going on a few of these."
"Pours deep clear copper with large fluffy head. Aroma is malty, carmelly. Flavor is sweet, malty, with dark caramel and toffee. A little overripe floral hop character, but relatively little hop bitterness - its there but like a subtly spicy tea. Mouthfeel is relatively thin. Not deep, but a good winter warmer."
"In short, this might be my favorite regular brew from Long Trail outside of their big bottle offerings. Good body, nice flavor and easy to drink. Glad to have this brewery close by."
"I would buy this again. Nice winter ale."
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these on a cold winter night. Not sure if I'll go back to it again, but it is definitely a good try and I think, it would make a great session beer."
"D - Nothing spectacular about this beer. It is a scottish ale I guess but it serves it's purpose as a nice winter warmer. Nice if you are looking for a decent pint. Very sessionable."
"Pours a light honey brown color with a small yet tight khaki colored head that left some clingy lacing on the glass. The aroma is bready with some caramel and has a light lemony sourness. The taste is of a big bready malt with a rusty metal/tin note followed by a bitter hop. There is some light fruitiness from lemon and some sort of berry. The flavor is a bit harsh. Moderate body with plenty of fizzy carbonation, starts sweet but does have a bitter aspect. An ok scottish ale, would like to see more of a malt showcase with less of the bitter aspect. I wouldn't turn this down but wouldn't pick it up if I were looking for a scottish ale."
"Cheers!!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops and malts. Taste is very hoppy and downright bitter, not to my liking. Feels light and bitter in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not a beer that I really cared for."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A good winter brew in the vein of Bells Christmas, Brooklyn Winter, and Stoudt's Winter. More of a session winter than a warmer in my opinion."
"Hibernator is pretty drinkable, but lacks any form of malty richness."
"Pours a clear amber color with 2 fingers of slightly off white head. Pretty decent retension and an ample amount of lacing. Head is actually creepy looking as the larger bubbles pop and fade resulting in a thick head that has an uneven, crater-filled surface... intersting. Nose is slight malt with a faint amount of hops, and a bit of grain. Taste is a little more bitter forward than others for the style. Also tasting grain throughout and a lingering partially metallic aftertaste. Medium feel, low carb. Not bad overall."
"Right off the bat this one looks great. A dark rusty transparent body is capped off by a generous head that gives way to some decent lacing. It's kind of weird in terms of style. The name, maybe unintentionally, suggests a doppelbock, and the sweet malt profile in the taste and smell are also similar to the style, though a little more nutty. That's where the similarities end, but it still doesn't seem like a Scottish ale, as it's classified here. Pretty darn good though and a classic winter seasonal in the northeast, so maybe the lesson to be learned is not to overthink it."
"Drinkability rates relatively high, and it is interesting to drink a rather hoppy Scottish ale. A nice twist on the style from Long Trail."
"Drinkability: Meh. Nothing I'd go out of my way to pick up, but I've definitely had worse beers."
"D - Very strong and satisfying flavor even on big sips. Enjoyable and easy to keep drinking."
"Drinkability: I would expect a bit more malt to make the flavor profile more interesting; the grainy aspect just doesn't work very well for me"
"D - Very drinkable and tasty, but not overpowering in any way."
"The usual humble, clean, and leisurely Long Trail traits as applied to a Scottish ale."
"D - overall pretty good, i'm enjoying this one."
"D- A good beer on a long, cold night."
"The Long Trail Brewing CO. will never disappoint."
"D: This was a solid brew and I enjoyed a few of them to prove the point. While not very complex or robust, this beer knows what it is and serves its purpose well. Extremely approachable and easy to drink, this is a definite safe option brew in macro-havens. Not a must-try by any means, but a solid choice when options are limited."
"CHEERS!"
"D- Light in alcohol and I wish I picked up more of this. Not expecting much I was quite surprised at the outcome. Give this one a try if you have not had it. A very drinkable scottish ale that does not stray far from the style. good stuff."
"light to medium body, hint of texture towards the finish. carbonation is moderate but a bit fizzy at times."
"Copper color with big, off-white marshmallow head. A very subtle aroma pulls through: burned sugar, malt, slight spice. Medium bodied with notes of bread, toffee, malt, slight hops in the center, some ginger, and a light fruity undertones at the finish. A malty session brew that fits for the fall season but that's where the appeal ends."
"First of all, with the name Hibernator, why couldn't this be a doppelbock? Anyway, this was a decent, but not overly impressive brew. It looked quite nice, an opaque tan/brown with a nice head that receded to a thin film. Smell was pretty neutral malt and hops, nothing special. I think I was expecting more in the flavor and mouthfeel - it's malty but not sweet, hoppy but not in your face, and dryer in the finish than I'd like. I also caught a lot more warming alcohol than I expected from a 5.6% beer. Not bad, but not worth a whole 6er. Double Bag remains my favorite Long Trail brew."
"Good drinkability. Good taste. Nice balance. A good beer to relax with on a cold night."
"(D) A very delicious Scottish ale. More hops than most Scottish Ales."
"Pours a clean, clear, light-red-orange-brown with a very thin white head which disappeared almost instantly. Smells of butterscotch, molasses. The taste starts with a strong, sweet maltiness then ends with a nutty finish which hangs around on the tongue. Goes down smoothe and easy."
"Drinkability: Fine for one, but I think I'd switch after my first to try something else. I do have to say that this was my first sample of this beer and based on the ""-ator"" in the name I was expecting a Doppelbock and not a Scotch Ale. Nonetheless it was a worthwhile brew."
"Pulled out of a mixed case. The appears is a simple brown with a white head. The aroma leaves a lot to be desired with a plain, too-clean mix of mineral-y water and a hint of toffee. The flavor gets a little better with a deep caramel and toffee flavor and hint of chocolate. It's not perfect, the flavor is too weak for the style, but overall this is an OK beer."
"Not bad overall. Kind of basic on all fronts but a nice tasting beer."
"Looking at the style on this profile now makes sense -- given the name, I was expecting a Doublebock & felt it fell short of the style. Not a bad brew, but not one I'd search out."
"Overall, a good beer to try, but not my favorite from Long Trail."
"Notes: A good beer to have on a cold night and one to keep in rotation as it was very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Good beer, more seasonable than most winter ales."
"D - I was turned off by the smell...but after my first sip I was hooked...a nice beer that I will be enjoying again"
"A great beer to have on a cold day. A tad bit heavy but not too heavy and would go good with a nice steak."
"Pours a hazy orangey brown with a nice thick 1/2 cm head. Aroma is sort of like Raison D'Etre.. very raisiny that suggests of alcohol or a Doppelbock with a good balance of malt and hops. Taste is extremely malty with well placed hop bitterness finish and really tastes like it has more alcohol than it really does. A bit of a grainy sandy mouthfeel to it. Usually I'm all about malty beers but this one is just rubbing me the wrong way at the moment. Something about the suggestive alcohol content, although it's only 5.6% is getting to me. Not bad, but I'm having a hard time finishing it."
"Taste is where I really liked this beer. Nice Malt backing with a slight bitterness. Not too much malt and not too much hops, very good balance. Excellent session beer. I had several!"
"It's odd. I had a Long Trail sampler pack this summer in upstate NY and recall really enjoying it. Is the winter sampler pack all that different? Something tells me I'm not going to dig the Milk Stout or the hoppy IPA, either."
"D: A good choice for lunch, the ale won't knock you out despite its decent flavor profile."
"Another trade with co-worker. Had several of the Long Trail offerings previously and the Hibernator follows along. A good solid beer. The color is a deep amber almost brown. Pours with a small off-white head that disappears shortly. Very smooth taste. The beer feels very dry on the tongue, and leaves a distinct but pleasant aftertaste. This is a good choice for the winter season."
"(rated Feb 6, 2007)"
"D- It's not ""bad"" but it's not ""good"" either. I'm a Long Trail fan but this one was a disappointment. It's like a watered down Double Bag."
"My only complaint is that I didn't read the label close enough. I picked this up thinking it was an olde ale style. You know... warm fireplace, bear looking cozy, etc. But I got a lucky surprise that it was a pretty decent Scottish Ale."
"Appears a deep caramel amber brown with a large off white khaki head, forms a thick head that leaves behind even bands of lacing. Aromatics sweet baked holiday breads with a touch of peated malt, overall really sweet caramel tones with a touch of alcohol. All of their beers have that touch of maple syrup in them especially the Triple Bag I had on ta last night. Flavor isn't overtly too sweet a rustic somewhat balanced with hard edges of herbal notes and earthiness, kinda stuck on the tobacco leaf kick. Mouthfeel is medium bodied a tad cloying not overly heavy in anyway but something just doesn't sit well with each sip, I thought their IPA was rock solid but so far I can't say Long Trail is one of the greats through their whole portfolio. Drinkability is pretty weak with this offering not the brew I would look for again anytime soon."
"12oz bottle from the local Shaw's. Pours a hazy but translucent brown body with a thin half inch of off-white head that leaves some nice lacing. Chocolate and caramel and toffee notes as well characterize the aroma. Chocolate, roastiness, caramel sweetness, just a tinge of peatiness. Medium-bodied with ample carbonation. A pretty easy-drinker. A fairly simple, straight-forward Scottish ale, but a good drinker for a winter night."
"D: definately drinkable, gonna keep this one on ahnd for a while"
"Pours a rich deep ruby, with a blossoming khaki head falling back with excellent lacing. he smell is soft cherries and subtle malt undertones. The rich juice flavor delivers those before exploding into a grapefruit bitterness and then calming into a enveloping biscuty finish. It rolls smooth across the tongue despite the biterness in the middle and would be excellent for an outdoor weekend by the fire. All in all I'm suprised at how all over the place the reveiws are as this is an imeninantly drinkable beer."
"Although it's not heavy and the abv is relatively mild for a winter brew, there is a limitation on the drinkability - maybe just that it is anything particularly special, IMO. Worth checking out though, as a lighter winter ale."
"A good sipping session brew for winter. I want to be just like the bear on the bottle, cozied up in front of a fire with a blanket across my legs and this beer in my hand. Long Trail seasonals have never quite impressed me, but this Scottish ale winter offering is better than par for them."
"Blah. A subpar Scottish ale. Aroma was weak. Stale caramel malt with not much else. Pour was an average cloudy medium amber with no bubbles and just a hint of a thin tan ring for a head. Taste was very average. A hint of roasted malt, but mostly caramel with no hops apparent. Little carbonation."
"Drinkability: I am by no means a Long Trail guy, I actually can't stand some of the beers they put out because they have alot of potential with their ingredients but never seem to come through strong, but this is a damn good offering. Smooth, robust, and just right for a cold autumn night. Kudos to Long Trail for finally hitting something on the head!"
"Poured from a bottle I received as a sample from Longtrail. Pours a dark amber, medium carbonation. Smells malty with butterscotch hints. Tastes slightly hoppy, a little spicy up front, finishes smooth but a little blah. Easy to drink, decent beer from Longtrail."
"Normally I'm a big fan of scottish ales or the wee heavy style but this one just wasn't doing it for me. Just clearly not enough flavor or taste for the style. When I get a scottish ale, I want it to be smokey and malty like Old Chub from Oskar Blues. This one poured a nice red color, but the smell was nonexistent along with the taste. Usually Long Trail has some good stuff but this is decent at best.. I mean it's highly drinkable because it has no taste but that's not a great thing."
"Probably not the best Long Trail I've had but it's close. Pours a copper color with a medium sized head. Aroma is malty and a little sugary. Flavor is malty, nutty, slightly sweet with brown sugary notes. Spicy and warming. A good one for the colder weather."
"Out of the bottle and into my glass this beer is an amber color with some reddish hues. Off-white head laces a little but not much retention. Nose of roasted malts, hints of caramel. Palate is predominantly malts with subtle hops underneath. Unbalanced. Caramel, wheat bread, slightly sweet. Medium carbonation, decent mouthfeel, but not as filling as I was expecting (or hoping for in a winter seasonal). About par for LT and it does display their usual drinkability and smoothness. But there are far better Winter brews."
"Long Trail Hibernator hasn't taken very kindly to hibernation. A 5.6% beer won't last forever, but I'd expect it to have held up better than this in the 9 months or so since bottling. Fresh Hibernator is probably a different (and better) story."
"Nothing special..."
"Pretty good, but this just seems like an unfiltered and watered down version of LT's Double Bag. The Hibernator is good, and it's cool that its unfiltered. The smell is predominantly malty, some sweet nuttiness. My main problem with this one is the mouth feel, which seemed too watery to me. Goes down relatively easily for a ""winter brew."" Just buy Double bag instead unless you're sick of it."
"D: Enjoyed this beer and could easier down a six pack with friends"
"Very drinkable, in the winter I could have many of these."
"Overall - Not bad, I used to be a huge fan of this one but over the years it can't really hold a candle to some of superior ones in its class. Still, I drank this sixer without a problem! Definitely recommend trying this brew."
"Long Trail Brewing company's Hibernator pours out the bottle and inot the glass a dark copper color. The head is relatively nice in size but short lasting. The initial smell is of spices, with malt and yeast breaking through. But overall the smell is tantalizing. The taste is a tad bit bland, not matching the spicy aroma, with malt being up front on the buds. There is a late arriving metallic bitter bite. A descent beer, but not one would I recommend rushing out to buy."
"I knocked this one down a bit in the drinkability category because it has a slightly harsh bite in the aftertaste that is unwarranted. The beer overall is pretty good, although I don't know if I would call this a Scotch Ale since it does not really have that burnt or smokey straw distinguishing characteristic. This is a medium bodied, traditional malty winter warmer. There isn't much carbonation, the head is a very nice off white, creamy and frothy. There are ruby notes to this beer and it is sufficiently cloudy to add some intrigue to its presentation. It retains and laces. The smell is dextrin malt maybe a hint of spice in the allspice family. The taste is a bit complex in that the malty sweetness, the spices, the butterscotch notes are most pronounced on the front end. The hops show up towards the finish and add a nice balance to the spices. The slightly off aftertaste detracts from an otherwise pretty good beer. The mouthfeel is slightly tilted towards the dry end, although there is a creaminess to this beer that is an overall asset."
"drinkability is moderate. it is a malt forward beer that's a touch off balance for me. it's not interesting, but it is quite drinkable, winning points for not being offensive."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable brew, full bodied without being heavy."
"Pours a dark amber with a thick lacy off-white head that sticks around for a while. It smells of roasted malts, a bit of hops, and some winter spices. The taste is good as well. Nice malty base with some hoppy bitterness to balance it out. The more complex spices were nice mixed in between the two and had some hints of caramel too. The mouthfeel is pretty good and it had the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability was pretty good as well. I could drink a few of these before I retired for the evening."
"Had this one in the winter survival pack. Its appearance is a brownish amber with a nice, creamy head that stays along after awhile. Its smell is steadily sharp with malts and spices for the holiday season. The taste is a little off from the smell, but not in a big way. Surprising hints of caramel with those hints of spice. Really dry aftertaste that makes it pack a distinct punch but is also not expected. A great body makes this thick enough to last you for the winter. Overall, a straight and narrow scottish ale."
"D: Average. I enjoyed the artwork on the bottle more than the beer itself but overall, I'd have another. I would rather go for the Double Bag that Long Trail offers instead."
"Not your typical scottish ale but still pretty good. This ale is just a little light in every catagory than I would expect out of a scottish ale."
"I'm not a huge Long Trail guy but the more I try their product, the more I become a fan. They keep putting out good stuff like this and I'll be an even bigger fan by 6 pack end."
"D- It goes down easy and is nice for a winter beer but I think the contrast of sweet malts coupled with spicy finish would get to be too much after a while. The malts come in smooth and then the finishes throws off the balance. Overall, a solid choice for winter."
"Certainly a decent session beer, but I was expecting something a little more interesting from a Winter Offering that spins the Scottish Ale style."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with a thin white head that fades quickly. The smell was somewhat disappointing, I wasn't getting too much from it. It smelled sweet and malty with a subtle hop aroma. The taste is similar, with a good deal of malty flavor with sweet notes and a somewhat bitter finish. A very light mouthfeel, I was expecting something heavier, but a good balance in flavor. Not a very powerful beer, but enjoyable. This is an easy drinker, not the first beer I would choose for a winter beer, but still tasty."
"Pours a very dark ruby that is fully clear. Nose is very perfumed at the start. Soap is also there. After a very short while it turns into a milder sweet toned leafy character. Flavor is smoothly sweet with that perfume coming out again over my tongue. I get an odd aftertaste that is like someone sprayed perfume in my mouth. Odd. Slightly sticky on the liquid and low on carbonation. Overall I feel like this is a ""new world"" scottish ale. A bit too hyper and vibrant and not subdued or mature enough. Decent enough, and definitely well made. There are just better examples of the style out there."
"D: Definitely a drinkable brew. Tastes very good, especially the slight honey presence in the aftertaste. Goes down nice and smooth, making for a nice, enjoyable beer."
"Pours amber brown. Not much head,and only a trace of lacing. Aroma is malty,with a hint of brown sugar,and hops. Body is thinner than I expected,with some carbonation. Taste is sugary, with some bitterness in the finish. Way too sugary for me, but you might like it."
"pours a hazy brown color with one finger of off white head leaving average lacing. The Smell is mostly of malts with a tiny hint of light hops sneaking in. The flavor start bitter with hops going into a solid malty back bone ending clean with a small hop bite. Not as thick and malty as some of the style, but a pleasant and easy to drink beer."
"Mouthfeel-good carbonation and bitterness are the inital sensation and taste. A roll on the palate gets a sweet, grainy malt flavor. I try avoid the term balanced but this winter brew is with a slightly hoppier than malty edge. Finishes like an Alt with a kick. VERY sessionable, pleasing. Long Trail always pleases, Cheers."
"# 2 in the sampler was this one ; pours a hazy med. copper color w/ a very thin head which dissipates rather quickly leaving little to no lacing in my nonic ( crap, noticed an oily film from my lip balm on top) ; a sweet malty smell, rich w/ alcohol and some hop and diacetyl undertones ; starts w/ a stronger than expected hop bite, followed by a malty, alcoholic ""whiskey""-like flavor, a little hop flavor present as well ; a med body w/ slight carbonation, true to style, feels a little thick w/ all the hop bitterness lingering ; not a bad beer at all, just a little too hopped for the style..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The mouthfeel is king here... creamy and slick, it's almost perfect for the style. With the right food, preferably a stew or some slow-cooked crockpot meal, this would be great."
"A beer with a great mouthfeel and balanced flavor. I'm not a big fan of Scottish ales, but this one is pretty good!"
"D: Would have liked to have tasted more of the warming alcohol but it is a drinkable beer. Enjoyable but not a favorite."
"Pours a dark red color with a thin head. Aroma is a bit smoky upfront with the malt showing through nicely. As it warms up, this aroma gets stronger. Taste is smoky on the tongue with a nice balance showing through. It's nice and subtle and not your typical winter beer. The smokiness isn't overpowering either. I like the aftertaste. Not a bad beer at all. I just never gave it this much thought."
"Medium almost light mouthfeel,smooth,with a bit of cloying. Goes down easy just don't think it a beer i could drink more than a couple of."
"Deep copper color. No aroma really. Rather metallic and plain. Malty enough flavor with a touch of bitterness. Decent enough mouthfeel. Overall quite average or maybe better. Could use a more pronounced malt flavor and lose the metallic flavor and aroma. Too close to their regular ale. Doesnt really compute."
"poured a redish copper color and with a slightly forced pour got a two finger off white head that faded to just covering the beer with some lacing. caramel and roasted malt along with some fruity esters for smell. taste lots of caramel, toasted bread, very sweet, but i could not pickup on the honey. i have a slight cold and that may be the reason. mouthfeel light, good carbonation, sweet but not cloying on the palate. tasty, easy session beer."
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer, interested taste. Would try again."
"Pours an orange copper color with an attractive off-white head. Good lacing. Aromas of grainy malt, spicy fruit, and some hops as well. Taste is great, big bitter malt flavors, mild hops, some mellow alcohol notes hits the tongue along with spice and honey. This is a great ale, not the usual scottish but with a great twist. Highly drinkable and delicious. Nice label artwork too, I can't help but laugh when I look at that bear all cozy near the fire."
"D---A solid well made ale. Not what I would expect from Scottish ale with all that bitterness but the malt supports it well. Also it is really dry from the honey addition. I like dry beer but I'm sure most people expect Scottish ale to have a higher final gravity. This is very drinkable and a solid session beer."
"Poured a clear mahogany brown with a tight formed one finger sized white head leaving a broken ring of lace as it slowly settled,somewhat muted aromas mainly sweeter malt like that of brown sugar and dark fruit there was a hint of herbla hop but it was faint.Obviously malt tilted and pretty basic brown sugar and caramel sweetness mainly though not overly sweet a touch spicey hp comes thru in a rather quick finish.Not bad its drinkable but I got a bit bored with it in the end."
"I doubt I'd buy it again. Drinkable, sure, but little of interest."
"Poured into pint glass. A dark orangey brown color with a slight head that disappeared quickly. Slighty warm malty aroma. Looked like a good beer. Taste was ok, but not what I was expecting for the beer. Slighty bitter with some malts and a hint of spicy. I was expecting more spices. Very easy to drink and felt ok in the mouth. Not a bad beer, and since it's fairly easy to find in New England, much better than the BMC usually on tap."
" Edit: after posting this review , I read others and am suprised that this is an example of scottish ale . Maybe the -ator threw me a curve ...But it seems more bock-ish to me ...so there .."
"12 pack at Shaw's for 11.99 (with your Shaw's card) Pours dark brown, very little head retention. Smells quite malty. Tastes quite malty, some hop bitterness in the back with spices (not sure what kind though) Good mouthfeel. Overall it's not what you expect for a winter warmer, but it is a good session beer. Not too bad, worth looking for."
"I love the image on the front of this beer...makes winter seem that much warmer and cozier. Anyway enough about that, the beer pours a nice looking copper, almost ruby color, with a small white laced head. It is also surprisingly clear, with champaigne like bubbles floating to the top. Smell is of dry grain, doughy bread, caramel, toast...not bad. Taste, lets see...Im getting more of the toast and grain flavors, with a mild backing of chocolate towards the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bordering on light perhaps. This is a very easy beer to drink for the cold Fall and Winter months. While this may not be an earth shattering beer, it delivers in my opinion....nothing too extreme or offensive with this one, simply a beer you can rely on. I wouldn't mind seeing this one all year round."
"A little chewy, but nice. As it warms up it becomes a little more cozy. Nice mild maltiness with a slight honey kick to it."
"D: This one has some decent flavor to it, isn’t as filling as most winter releases goes down quite easily. Most winter beers are typically sippers, which this one could be, but it could be a very good session beer as well, especially if you’re ok with the sweetness."
"Clear amber-hued copper. Moderately short-lived head. The nose is sweet, floral, vinous, with notes of concord grapes. The palate is by turns malty, sweet, and still firmly bitter, with toasty elements combining with a lingering bitterness into the finish. The honey, while fortifying this brew, does contribute to a mild tartness that seems to chime in from time to time, which is a little distracting. My bottle may be a little past its prime, but I'm guessing that this beer was probably not too much more than a decent, mostly unoffensive winter offering."
"This one really surprised me. It has a lot going on. There is a very consistant, soothing/refreshing taste that is quite memorable. It felt lighter to me then many of its scottish counterparts. I found it very palitable and smooth with just a hint of tartness. overall, it has become one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: A great session beer with a good aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Nicely drinkable if you like a nice malty brew. Try it, everyone will have a different opinion on this one."
"				~Benjamin Franklin"
"I bought a 12 oz bottle of this for the Super Bowl. Wonderful dark, rich color. A nice medium head, that sustained itself for aroudn 60-90 seconds. Smelled like honey. Tasted good, quite smooth for a Scottish Ale. Overall, this will be one of the reasons why I like winter next year."
"Body is medium, softly carbonated, with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and cottony texture. Another easy drinker."
"Mouthfeel is medium in body and is mildly carbonated."
"Drinkability: After several sips, the grapefruit hops interfere with the nice breadiness. I would probably not choose to drink more than one of these, possibly a couple."
"d: I like this and enjoy drinking it. A bit more bitterness than I normally like, but this one isn't over hopped so the bitterness is pretty good."
"Regardless of that, this is still a nice brew in the end and one that I'm happy to pick up each season."
"M & D: Good mouthfeel with a whole lot of malt. Very smooth with a nice aftertaste thats not too bitter. Drinkability is pretty good. This definately is a nice winter beer."
"Happy holidays!"
"Overall, great beer! I wish they made this year-round. When I can get it for $9.99 a twelve-pack at the grocery, it's a winter staple in my beer fridge."
"Notes from the bottle: Hardy and robust, this full-bodied, malty brew with a smooth finish features a blend of 6 malts and a dash of honey. A great Winter Warmer!"
"This pours a dark coppery color,it looks like a glass of maple syrup,but the head is a little smallish.The smell is a little floral,but it's mostly a sweet honey scent with roasted maltThe taste is very creamy and finishes with alot of hoppiness.The m/f isn't as well balanced as I would like.It does have a slight watery aftertaste,but this is a good beer from my favorite Vermont brewer."
"Poured a crystal clear medium copper color with respectable tannish head that slowly fell leaving nice lacing on the glass. Smell is big and malty, with nice tones of dark fruits. Taste is a bit suprising, with a strong hop character overpowering the promises of of malt in the nose, though it does taste good. Finished with a nice blend of the malt and hops giving a nice combination ending. Very pleasing to drink. Quite enjoyable."
"I have wanted for some time to try this delightful brew. Now that I have I can say it was worth the wait. This is a nice entry level scotch ale. Balanced to the malt side of the family tree with a fruity, peaty, floral nose and a tan head that leaves nice lacing. Overall a nice winter brew to enjoy with friends. No this is not a thick and rich scots ale but it is a nice intro to the style and great to enjoy if you are having more than one."
"Hibernator pours a reddish amber with a thin off-white head. Aroma is slightly hoppy, but mostly floral with some malty notes. Taste is caramel sweet, with some nuttiness with a definite contribution from the honey used in this brew showing up in the finish. Not overly sweet, but not bone dry either. Fine carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, but I don't know how well it fits the definition of Scottish Ale, This shouldn't keep you from giving it a try, though."
"Oh yeah, I could definitely spend a cold Vermont winters night curled up in front of a fire with a book and a six pack of this."
"Pours a nice deep ruby with a decent head that fizzles out quickly. Nose consists of caramel notes with some hoppiness. Taste is pretty good, rather bitter with some mild sweet tones. Flavors have a decent balance. It lingers around for awhile, not too crisp. Overall, a pretty OK beer, good for its style."
"pours a clear brillant red amber color with a decent thick white head. sweet malty aroma with some honey standing out in the end. very balanced and subtle taste, not much stands out in the way of malt honey or hops...very easy to drink though...could go for a few of these...but they might get to be too much after awhile."
"Finger licking good."
"A clean dark amber/brownish beer. Has a nice off white head, with a good lace. The aroma is a malty sweet with some caramel and a hint of coffee. The flavor is light malt with a quick note of chocolate and coffee just before the hop finish. Not enough of an alcohol warmth to be considered a strong WeeHeavy."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth and sweet caramel and roasted malt scent with a dry yeast aroma. It has a slight hop presence that adds balance to the aroma. The taste is good. It has a rich and creamy malt flavor with a dry hoppy finish. It goes down easy and finishes with a sweet caramel malt and hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is good as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine Scotch ale. It has good flavor and aroma; an excellent drinker."
"A bit of aroma. Bitter, even acidic and some malts. Dry metallic and pepper aftertaste. Medium mouthfeel."
"Overall: For a winter brew this is pretty good."
"12 ouncer with bottled on dating (bottled 10 days before this review!) Pours almond and clear, minimal head is off white, next to no lacing. Nose is a boring sniff of malt and perhaps some smoke. Malty ale is the deal here, honey sweetness adertized on the label and picked up on the palate, decent sessioner, but not much more."
"Nothing more than an average ale IMO. Good flavors, slightly unbalanced. Nothing unpleasant regarding flavor, but nothing special either. I'll pass on this one next time."
"This beer strikes a fairly impressive image. A beautiful dark ruby color. It has a small head, but it sticks around forever and leaves a great lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma isn't very strong. What's there is obviously very malty, but also earthy in a very scotch-ale type way. The taste is very malty with a wet earth touch in the background. There is the tiniest amount of hop bitterness at the finsih, but is almost indetectable. The malt rules here, as it should in a scotch ale. There's a slight metallic taste in the finish, but it isn't strong enough to detract from the overall experience. It has a fairly full mouthfeel, which is appropriate. The drinkability is OK, but since I've discovered a love of the hops, I yearn for a bit more bitterness to cut through the malt sweetness."
"Happy Hibernation."
"Thanks to the monk for trading up some scraps from his mighty beer table!"
"Light to medium body with some good carbonation in here to make it a soft brew. This could go down a little too quick. Quite an enjoyable scotch without the cloying sweetness in it. A nice winter pick."
"Pours a dark amber with lighter tints and a slight fizzy head. Smells of slight floral notes, bits of honey and butterscotch. Very subtle sweetness to this brew. The taste is a high carbonation crisp clean feel with earthy tones followed by a mellow sweet hint of honey and bits of hops. The butterscotch and honey finish off strong and balance this beer very well. Very tasty beer for a nice cool night."
"Toasty & biscuity. Some caramel / toffe flavours & again honey. Finishes with of touch of floral hops. Rich & malty, yet not cloyingly sweet. Brown sugar lingers on the tongue. Medium-full body, gentle carbonation."
"Thanks to PBrian for this one."
"Beer was bottled on 11/06/2003 and was a 12 oz."
"A perfectly respectable winter beer, nice little entry from these guys, and thanks go to rabidawg for providing!"
"Light cream colored head that leaves just a tad of lacing. The color is somewhere between a dark copper and a ruby bronze. It smells like skunky hops, not all that appealing.The flavor is not too strong, mostly hops that are just barely bitter, a bit of burnt malt and butterscotch hold it back. The body is light and the beer is pretty carbonated, it's almost like swallowing a frothy beer."
"Overall not bad, but nothing to write home about. There are better winter brews out there. I might have been expecting too much with the -ator name, I wasn't expecting a doppel, but I did want something more than this."
"Drinkability: A nice winter ale, somewhat lacking in body, but a hell of a sniff between sips."
"Notes: A more than decent pick for the big influx of winter brews in this year (2003) ... just enough hops to tame the body. Quite an enjoyable malty brew."
"The taste is what I was hoping the Harvset would be but wasn't. Lots of sweet caramel and toasted malt with a underlying sweetness of citrus and sugar. Slighlty buttery and chewy in texture. Very nice mouthfeel. Super smooth. Moderately weak hop finish, but enough to balance all that malt. Great beer."
"Tastes spicy and sweet. Fruity with those smooth honey flavors underneath it all. Medium bodied with a light hoppy finish. Sour aftertaste. Good winter/holiday beer but not outstanding. Would rather have a Harvest Ale given my choice, a bit too sweet."
"Happened upon this brew in a lost little store in the middle of nowhere. Being a cold night, I figured it was only appropriate I pick some up. Pours a deep honey amber color with a quick ivory head. Aroma is malty and sharp with a hint of honey and bread. The flavor is initailly sharp with a toffee undertone and an aggressive bitterness. The sharpness smoothes off a bit with a bold alcoholic warmth ebbing into a coffee finish. This brew leaves quite an impression on the palate. Good for warmth, but a bit too sharp for a warmer evening."
"This beer poured a orange/brown with red highlights when held to the light. It was very clear and well carbonated. The head was a medium brown and was chunky, creamy and foamy, and this was also mirrored in the lace that it left behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, hops, brown sugar, herbs, and a very slight sweet honey appeal. Not overly impressive considering the label stated that it would be. The tastes that came from the glass were of hops  floral and citrus (very slight), a carbonation bite, sweet malt, watery feel, pine trees, flowers, slight lemons, roasted nut, barley (when it warmed), bread/yeast (slight) and a slight alcohol (warmed). The aftertaste was hops and slightly dry. I tasted more hops in this beer then malt, even though the label stated that it used 5 malts in the brew process. I noticed the malts more in the nose then on the tongue. And as for the honey, I only detected a small hint in the nose and none on the pallet. Medium bodied, but I was hoping for more. A better then average beer, but IMO not a great example of a scotch (strong) ale."
"Has a nice dark amber color, pours a nice 1/2"" head which thins out but never disappears.spicey aroma with a very little licoricey taste, even though I don't think they add either. Very tasty winter brew that is not too cloying or overly spiced. You can drink a few of these at a sitting. Got them for 11.99 a 12 pack so you can't beat the price. Always love going to Vermont and having my cousin pull one out of the fridge, lets me know I'm in Vermont."
"Excelent carbination levels. The label has a nice by the fire scene of a bear presumably doing what all of us would like to do in the winter by hibernating. the beer was a nice treat after sledding all day in northern VT."
"Clear amber color, minimal head (pretty much a small ring of lace). Aroma is malty sweet, butterscotch, and a slight nuttyness. Flavor is initally malty sweetness, with some brown sugar and honey making up the aftertaste. Minimal (if any) hop presence."
"The beer pours a crystal clear mahogany color, the head moderate in size, the consistency frothy, beige in color and the residual lace a nice thick covering sheet. Sweet malt nose, with a hint of butter, candied apples also come to mind, a pleasant sniff. Ambrosial start, malt a plenty, the top middling, somewhat tart finish that has a purposeful spicy hop bite, carbonation middling, and the aftertaste bitter and long lasting. Quite a quaffable beer and one that suits my palate, and worth the sample."
"Hibernator poured a dark cherry red color with a smaller than average thick foam head.The aroma is of malt The first taste reveals wheat and malt..lots of it.The taste seems very complex.Very crisp fizzy mouthfeel leading now to a slight bitter finish.Rings of lace circle my glass with every sip.A full body that leaves a dry finish.Roasted grains and a hint of a biscuit are noted.Hibernator is a true winter brew that would take the chill out of the coldest of winter nights.Leave it to Long trail for another solid offering.The ABV has to be between 6 and 7 on this one."
"nice aroma of spices, sweet malts, and hops that is just perfect for the winter season. lots of malts and spices dominate the flavor of this beer. it has a nice warming character that makes it a great winter drinker. very smooth with a nice rich body, it goes down great."
"Sooo drinkable - a toasty malt flavor starts off, with caramel, toffee, and a very slight diacetyl flavor rounding things out. It starts to get a bit more bitter mid sip, and finishes like a more bitter, slightly drier version of the start with added hints of cocoa and slight hop spiciness. The flavors are very, very clean - no off flavors at all. The mouthfeel is a touch on the light side, but it makes this brew massively drinkable. One of my favorite winter seasonals primarily because it lends itself to day-long consumption and I'll never tire of the flavor."
"Cheers"
"Bronze hue, w/ excellent clarity. Thin, but dense head leaves loose lace. Dark caramel malt, mild chocolate and light roasted barley sharpness. Mild earthy hop nose. Malt profile is dominated by dark caramel malt and biscuit, w/ an undertone of bittersweet chocolate and roasted grain. Light diacetyl adds richness. Lightly bodied, borderline thin mouthfeel. Moderate hop bitterness hinderse malt sweetness until the finish, which reveals a pleasant brown sugar note. Hibernator is a no frills, malt driven brew that falls slightly short in body. Its main strength is its overall balance and drinkability. Tasty. Thanks to Murph for the bottle."
"Golden toasted golden to light brown color. Minimal off-white head. Nice sweet toasted malt aromas and subtle honey presence. Taste is rich malty and sweet. Toasted carmel malt, the honey adds a thin sweetness to the end, ever so slightly. Not overdone. Not real spicy either, very nuetral flavored. Medium bodied. A good balanced, beer, not overly done."
"Bright red-amber body, topped by a three-finger off white head of microbubbles. Excellent lacing. A sweet aroma, familar, but I can't quite place it. Read the label: honey. That's it. Taste is malty, sweet but not cloying, with a wonderful depth to it. Body is full and round. Drinkability is easy. A very good winter seasonal. Give me honey and brown sugar over pumpkin pie spices any day. Exceeded my memories of previous years."
"415"
"Smooth, sweet and malty up front, a bit bready with hints of fruitiness, the hops are there in with a nice dose of bitterness to help balance it out. A lasting sweetness on the finish. Pretty good beer, but not one of my favorite Winter beers."
"Pours a deep copper color with a big creamy tan head that lasts forever and leaves a great looking lace all the way down the sides of the glass.  Huge, creamy, and sweet maltiness dominates the nose of this brew with some spicy alcohol notes thrown into the background for good measure.  Smooth and sweet maltiness all the way to the end.  There are faint smoky peat flavors that linger only for a second before being swept away by the finishing alcohol spiciness.  Greatly creamt, this brew remains very drinkable throughout.  I would highly recommend this one to anyone who can get their hands on it."
"A touch of honey on the nose.  A bit of the signature Long Trail toastiness on the tongue but that and the hops are overwhelmed by the malt and honey sweetness.  The first one is quite enjoyable, the second one is hard to finish due to this mouth-coating sweetness."
"I liked this alot, it is everything I want from a ""winter brew"".  If I was a bear, this is what I would stock my cave with for the winter."
