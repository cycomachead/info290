"Best Scottish Ale I have had (and I have tried many!).  Full flavor, not bitter and a taste that lingers on the tongue perfectly.    Very slight nuttiness.  Great with a hearty meal or even better all by itself.  Strong recommendation!"
""
""
""
""
"O - Nothing too outstanding here, but that's where it shines. Very smooth and easy while still having some complexity to it."
""
""
""
"I like Robert the Bruce!"
"Best Scottish Ale that I have had so far!"
""
""
""
"Interesting . In a category all its own"
"It was ok, but not great. The taste was not that memorable but this is a good easy to drink Scottish Ale."
""
""
""
""
"I lucked out and got the last 6'er from the local beer store tonight, and damn. I can see why this stuff sells out so fast. It's smooth, it's tasty, and you get six, not just a bomber. I'll be picking this up every chance I get. One of my new favorites."

"My first Three Floyds experience.  I realize this one doesn't garner the hype like the rest of their lineup but nevertheless this didn't disappoint.  Almost sessionable due to its light nature.  If you like malty beers then give this a try.  I could easily enjoy a couple of these at the pub."
"Overall / Drinkability:  Easily could drink more, tasty, but not overpowering or really strong in flavor.  A finely balanced scotch ale that goes really well with food (gyro pizza in this case) and I think would be really good all on its own.  I'll have to try to get back to South Park Tavern next time they have it on tap and I don't have to get back to work right away."
"This is one of my favorite styles,  but unfortunately not a lot of brewers are making it. This is beer is so deliciously malty, with the smokey peat you expect from the style and hints of caramel and toffee. I love scotch ales and to me this rides the difference between the lighter Scottish ales  (90 schilling, Laughing Lab and Wee Mac.) and the bigger scotch ales out there (Old Chub, Claymore  and Wee Muckle). It is an easy drinking sweet, malty delight. Great gateway into the bigger but less made malty beers. I think 3Floyds kills it in every style they try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice flavor that is very drinkable."
"O - 4.25 - One of the best ""standard scotch ales"" that I've ever had. Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
"Excellent, Smooth. Wonderful tasting brew from Three Floyds. It is one of the best beers that I have tried overall. I highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it, as it can be quite hard to get from what my local beverage store said. Worth the price, but it is fairly expensive. Keep in mind you are getting a high quality beer."

"this is FFF most underrated beer.. I love Scottish Ales so theres that too..."

"Not a huge fan of the style, but I prefer WeeMac from SunKing a bit more."

"O   Not my favorite Scottish Ale. Overall, offers a very enjoyable, complex palate"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this seems to ride the line between an 80/- and 90/- Shilling. It's richly malted and quite drinkable considering it's 6.5% ABV, though avoids becoming cloying. It's an excellent attempt but doesn't quite match the better Scottish distilleries. Still a pleasant and enjoyable beer."

"O-Decent beer for it's intended style, I was honestly expecting more, but pleased nonetheless."

"Overall I really liked this one.  I just kinda discovered English Milds and Scottish Ales this year.  I found one locally that I really enjoy, and this one is better.  I wish I had more than a 6 pack . . ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding winter favorite. Smooth as silk with a chocolate finish."
""
"Real nice Scottish Ale, monster malt bill. Has an almost chocolatey/malt ball taste. Could almost be confused with a light porter or possibly a bock if I didn't know better. It's a deep red, the color is really beautiful. Leaves a faint after taste maybe tobacco? I can only compare this to Founders 'Dirty Bastard' I will say Founders has a bit more full high octane feel. Maybe more balanced and smoother. This is ever so slightly more watery... However, this is very drinkable and has good medium body~"

"Sneaky brew.   Great taste, lots of flavors.   It packs a punch but doesn't seem strong.  It's my new favorite.   I order it every time I find it on tap."

"Poured from bottle. Color is a deep rich red mahogany. Just gorgeous, nearly fully opaque.  Smell is candied yams, and caramel.  Taste was impressively balanced, there is a little sweetness, but never cloying. Lots of caramel flavors, some dark raisiny fruit coming through as well. Mouthfeel was very full, rich and round. The carbonation is light, but it suits the style. Just a delicious scotch ale."

"Overall: Well brewed example of a 80 Schilling, nothing stands out here though as special. The sulfur in aroma really detracts from the overall beer. I won't go back to it, but it does hide its alcohol well."

"O: This is a good beer, but not great for the style. The slight twist on the flavor profile is welcome, but the strong carbonation distracts from this."
"if you like the scottish style ales, this is one for you, a true beauty on the malt bill, and while not as complex as some of the other three floods beers, it certainly exudes the same high quality and attention to detail as the others. dark caramel in color with a nose that smells like caramel in the works, sugar melting into butter, with just a slight burning toast character. not much more than a quarter inch of tan foam on it. the flavor is awesome, and it comes in layers, with the sweet part of the malt coming and going quickly with a saint brown sugar flavor, but it moves into a richer, more bready, almost german malt complexion, with maybe the faintest hint of smoke as it finishes. rich is the best way to describe it, but not decadent, just full flavored and even fuller bodied. i find it remarkably drinkable nevertheless, and enjoy the punctuating carbonation. one of those beers that wins awards because its well done and real true to style. i love the grain flavors on this, its different than most, with even a hint of maple or honey as it goes down. i like this a lot in fall weather, but it works here in early summer too, especially in a morning drinking context, especially because the alcohol isn't stupidly high for no reason, i could have multiples of this no problem."
"Dark mahogany color with a quarter inch of beige head. Good clarity. Plenty of Brussels lacing. Nice sweet,dark malty aroma. Lots of sweet,dark malt with a trace of smokiness in the fade. The mouth is a bit sticky and chewy. This is a very subtle beer and I really like the aroma."

"Great example of a well executed scotch ale. Haven't had one of these in a while and it sure hit the spot."

"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a tumbler, pours dark brown with a single finger head. Smell is loaded with malt, lots of roasted barley, Caramel. Taste is full of roasty malt, tons of grain, some subtle dark fruit, small hop presence. Overall this isn't my style but it is very good, very grainy, great balance of malt and hops (traditional FFF hop excessiveness , in a good way), some dark fruit flavors, very drinkable. Not the hallmark beer of FFF. It worth trying for sure."

"Good overall bottle of scot. I enjoy it and glad I can get it. That's it. Really, I have to leave 250 word comment on this beer? OK I rank it up there with one of my favorite scots, good stuff, buy it if you can. Ok? Not enough BS, come on guys, its really good, it's three Floyds what do you expect?"

"O: A very solid interpretation of the style. Perhaps just a bit more hoppy than average, but all marks are hit. A quietly enjoyable beer to drink."

"O- It is a well balanced beer with flavors that work well with each other and it also goes down very smooth."

"O-Rich, malt bomb with some nice smokiness and a little sweetness. Easy to drink with low levels of alcohol bite that many beers of this style contain."
""

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, plum, pear, apple, raisin, toffee, bread, floral, herbal, light pepper, light chocolate, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, pear, apple, raisin, plum, brown bread, light chocolate, floral, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, pear, apple, raisin, plum, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt and yeast ester flavors; with nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Scottish ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall – This is a sweet and malty brew for sure. A fantastic beer for a nice fall or winter day. Lots of sweet sugary taste with a nice brown bread flavor."

"picked up a 6er from the brew pub maybe an hour ago. enjoyed from beer hunter taster glass. brew poured a chestnut purple with a massive head (truth be told, the bottle got shook up quite a bit on the journey from the car)...as the head dissipated, left nice lacing. nose is nutty and brown sugar with very earthy malt. taste is really nice, but more of a brown ale than a scottish ale. tasty, but missing something for a wee heavy. big brown sugar notes and earthiness...some dark fruit. medium bodied. definitely a scotch ale, but tows the line of a brown ale. glad to have a 6er and really diggin this one, but not a classic wee heavy."
"This brew has plenty of pop and character, but it never quite comes together for me in the way I'd like, especially considering the promise suggested by the aroma. It's flavorful and intriguing, albeit a little heavy handed, and the alcohol is distracting. Then again, Three Floyds were never much for subtlety. This is worth trying, but not something I'd seek out."
"O- a malt lovers beer, packed with caramel, bready and toasted malt flavors, amazing mouthfeel to compliment the flavors. A style I should explore more of"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a foamy (2/5) and smooth (3/5) mouthfeel that seems fitting for the beer and the style. No impression of ethanol on throat or in nostrils. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a nice dark and syrupy ruby-brown with a little head of miniscule, light tan bubbles that fizzle away to the smallest of rings around the glass. In body, the beer is clean of particles, but dark and a little murky, like looking through a bottle of Aunt Jemima’s syrup. On the nose, the beer smells richly of bready malts. Brown sugar-coated raisins mingle with soft peat smoke and light bacon scents atop the rich, caramel bread smell which gives this beer’s nose a backbone. There is a light touch of sweet alcohol, and definite rich biscuit, chocolate, and bread notes as the beer warms. On the tongue, this beer tastes richly sweet with malts. The beer finds balance through light bitter roast and light savory bacon flavors from the smoked malt. Ever-so-soft herbal hops also gently bitter the tongue beneath all of the other tastes, while slightly cloying alcohol does touch on the middle of the sip. On the tongue, the beer feels medium in body with a lightly chewy, yet velvety mouthfeel and a very soft carbonation and prickle on the tongue. As the beer warms, the mouthfeel seems to thin out a little, which is too bad. The flavor begins as sweet raisins and light bacon and peat smoke, slowly moving slightly towards a cider-like flavor and then swiftly to warm caramel bread with a touch of cola. Faint herbal bitterness can be sensed throughout the sip, and the beer finishes with a nice long touch of bacon-like flavors and a touch of chocolate and bread. The aftertaste lingers with smoke and caramel sweetness while the tongue feels oddly scraped and dry. Slight maple syrup flavors can also be sensed. Overall, this is a nice beer with great malty complexity and a terrific transition of flavor as the beer warms. The closer you get to room temperature the more maple syrup notes you get from the malt, but you also get a touch more the herbal hops. A beer to try for sure."
""
"Pours a see-through reddish-brown with little head and very little lacing. Aromas of cocoa powder and caramel waft from the glass. Nice. Pleasant roasted malt hits the palate first. Sweet, with a hint of smokiness that ends a bit dry. Very smooth. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this is an extremely well crafted beer. Very drinkable for a beer of 9% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nicely balanced brew and highly drinkable for the style. The nose and body are a bit lacking. The whole though is greater than the sum of its parts and The Bruce finishs strong for me!"

"Dark red/brown pour, with a thick off white foamy head. I must say three floyds beer never disappoints in the looks dept. Aroma is filled with dark roasted toffee, mostly figs and plum. Lots of caramel in their too. Hints of citrus as well. Taste is smooth with the toffee and sweet caramel combining very nicely and even. Hints of a orange note and also some butterscotch. Mouth feel is medium bodied, lower ABV make this one a easy drinker. I think this scotch ale can stand up to most of the other ones on the market. I'm glad more and more three floyds is making its way to Ohio, I have a feeling that our dreams might come true and get full distribution sooner than later."

"O: quite nice and highly drinkable, but lacks the boldness and complexity of a world class version like Skullsplitter."
""
""
""

"O: Malt forward, flavorful, scottish ale. I think this beer is overlooked from the 3Floyds regulars since its not hop forward. is a shame! a sham!! drink it, love it, repeat."

""
""
""

"Overall this is good, but can be somewhat cloying. Went well with a burger at the brewpub but on its own is somewhat overwhelming."

"Rich, medium-full bodied mouthfeel that pushes all the way back across the palate. The beer has so much richness that it feels almost off-dry although it is very clean. Really a wonderful sense of balance in this beer. Great job with the American version of this style."

"A solid offering of FFF, although gets way too sweet even with the finer fruity and malty textures that it has to offer. I haven't had too many Scotch or Scottish ales from the Midwest (other that Founders' Dirty Bastard, and maybe one or two more), but it's definitely a region that makes them the right way, and I think because the hoppiness is pungent and earthy enough to round up the assertive malt bold properties. While I could do without the excessive sweetened, boozy finish, I could definitely have this again. Pairs very well with all kinds of food. Recommended for fans of FFF."

"Good depth. Moderate carbonation. Slightly syrupy going down. A malt-lovers dream no doubt, this beer is malty to the max. Caramel, toffee, mild pale fruits, sweet-tea like finish. A treat of a beer. Not a style I visit often, but this reminds me why I should revisit this time and again. A nice beer here."
""
"This is a nice Scotch style Ale, but it's not mindblowing. The sweeter notes blend perfectly with the bitter hops and slight smoke and it makes for a very nice and easy drinking beer. It's a good and solid example of this style, but nothing to get too excited over."

"Pretty solid stuff. Good looking tan fizzy head. Deep red in color. On the sweeter side for an already sweet style. Tons of sugary, toasted malt. Some bready yeasty flavors and of course biscuit. Can be a bit cloying and heavy at times but it has its own twist and unique character. Dark sugary fruits. An enjoyable beer but one is enough for me. Almost like a dark real kola drink."

"Overall, the thing we liked best about this beer was its complexity. The flavoring remained nicely fruity and sweet, spicing things up stylistically, while the malts took a back seat until thoroughly warmed. Soy sauce saltiness and pale honey sweetness helped keep things a bit more serious, but the residual sugars did become a bit much by the end. The nose felt comparatively cheaper and thinned through. This beer drinks decently but never quite melds as much as you want it too. While I definitely bled with William Wallace, I’m still not sure if I will bleed with Robert The Bruce."

"O - Definitely try this if you enjoy scottish/wee heavy ales, but personally I prefer the Pipeworks Last Kiss and the Founders Dirty Bastard."

"Overall: Another solid brew by three floyds. The first beer by them that I have rated above above average, but they have all been good. this is a good beer that is well done and drinkable. certainly worth a try if you can get your hands on it"

"Overall - A nice, easy drinking beer, especially at 6.5% ABV. Most of the time I prefer something a little hoppier, but this is still a quality brew that I'll drink on the occasion that I'm craving a crisp malty ale."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad but this seems to fall short of my prefered examples of the style and isn't among Three Floyds stronger work. It's easy to drink and is a nice little pause from my usual stouts ad IPAs."

"O- I know of lots of people that really don't like this beer or think it's a subpar offering from FFF but i disagree. I really enjoy the malt and bitterness that comes from it."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a rich looking dark brown with an overzealous off-white head that thinly blankets. The nose is slightly metallic, roasty, caramel, a touch of booze, and uncharacteristically unbitter. The taste presents a decent amount of caramel, very little bitterness (surprisingly), and a lingering bready maltiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, bready, and sweet. This beer is tasty, but I'd prefer a FFF hop monster any day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"the Robert The Bruce is definitely my favorite among the Three Floyds. It does have a bit of a bite, but i enjoy that in a good ale. It has a nice dark amber look to it, and has a good balance of flavor. Savage's Ale House in muncie indiana is where i always go to enjoy this ale on tap."

""

"O: I wasn't expecting great things from this beer, but I am still let down. If a fairly new homebrewer tried to do a Raison d'Etre clone, this might be what it would taste like. I'm not sure if I'm even going to finish it. Ugh."
""
""
""
"O: Good, would be a decent regular beer. Doesn’t stand out but tastes decent."
""
""
"Poured a very stout and strong two finger head, with a dark copper coloring that impressed me greatly. The scent has a bit of a fruity note, kind of sweet like apple. It may be my imagination but I got a pear like taste with a smooth alcohol finish. Very nice finish but a pronounced ale flavor that makes me think I will buy this again"
""
""
"O: its decent at best. Not exactly my favorite style but I do like the intense caramel this style has to offer. With that being said, I don’t find much balance in this brew. I feel that the grassy hops are too much and they quickly take away (what would be) an excellent sweetness created by the caramel and vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems very easy to drink compared to some of the other beers in the style."
"O: I was hoping for a little bit more peat smokiness in my scottish ale... This is a little easier to drink than a lot of other offerings in the style as it is not as sweet as they often are. A very solid offering and one I would have again."
""

"O Love this beer. Have a nice selection of 12 oz bottles in the fridge and this is old faithful. Delicious, refreshing and goes down oh so easily. Well done Three Floyds!"

"I've had this brew many times. Finally getting around to a review. Thanks to Dave for bringing a bottle over. The beer is dark amber with burgundy highlights. Aromas of toffee, brown sugar, yeast. Brown breads and malt with yeast and a touch of hops in the finish. Alcohol presence is moderate. Medium carbonation with a growing sweetness. This is alright."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep mahogany color and thick white head (from what I could see in the dimly lit bar). Malty smell with a touch of caramel and chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel giving way to the malts and caramel sweetness - quite nice. Of the small number of Three Floyds beers I've tried, this one is my favorite so far, though I think I would find myself reaching for an Alpha King more frequently."
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a thin white head. Smell is of caramel malt, it's nice, but a bit one-dimensional and not all that prominent. Flavor is malty and a little sweet with a slight roasty-bitter kick on the back end. Unfortunately it tastes way too boozy for a 6.5% beer. I shouldn't be able to taste alcohol at all, but I'm definitely getting a little bit here. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth. Overall, this is a good, not great beer from 3 Floyds. On the spectrum of 3 Floyds beers, this is one of their weaker ones, but on the spectrum of beer in general, this one is certainly above average."
""
"Pours a reddish dark amber bordering on brown with a two finger off-white head. No lacing evident as the head recedes. Notes of caramel, chocolate, and roasty malts on the nose. Opens with the taste of toffee, cocao nibs, bread, and a bit of smoke. Roasted malts join in as the hops that have been present, but in the background, surface to add a bite of bitterness on the finish. Smooth Medium body and a medium level of carbonation. Malty goodness, but not quite as peaty as most other Scottish/Scotch ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An above-average beer, and one I'd happily drink again. With Founders and what some would argue as their ""flagship"" Dirty Bastard less than 10 miles down the road, though, it's hard to put this above the Founders offering."
"O - If you love scotch in your beer then avoid this one. It's a great year round offering and an easy drinker to boot."
"Poured a hazy, reddish amber color into a Russian River pint glass. Smell is nice, smoked malts, Caramel and toffee. Taste is amazingly well balanced for a scotch ale. Peated malts once again, some dark fruit, toffee, somewhat bready and not to heavy. Surprisingly seasionable. Thanks Rudi!"
""
"O: Smoother than I was expecting. A fine prelude to my trip to Scotland. Even better as it warms. Love those malts."
""
""
""
"O- This was a nice beer, but nothing spectacular. Easy to drink, nice flavor, but nothing that stands out against other beers. Nice offering from FFF as a year round offering available in 6-packs."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a good showcase of malt, per the style, but a bit on the sweet side. I would gladly drink another!"

""

"M: Medium bodied. Really lighter than it looks."

"I totally dug this beer, but it just seemed to be lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. I don't know if I sat on the beer for too long (it was sitting in my fridge for about 3 or 4 months), but I'd totally be willing to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good enough, though not a typical variation of the style--also, not particularly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O- Very tasty! I could use a little more aroma though."
"This beer pours a super hazy dark amber/brown with only light getting through. It has a unique spiciness for a Scottish ale and it also has a notable hop presence, it traditional of Three Floyd's and is slightly fruity and piney but not too noticeable. The malt flavors are roasted malts and a tiny bit of dark fruits, some caramel as well. This is more bitter then most Scottish ales but is pretty creamy smooth at the same time. A pretty darn good scotch ale, hands down."
"O: I am really enjoying this beer. Nothing bad to say about it. Nice drinkable ale from FFF!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is pretty smooth. Medium in body."
"O: This is pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of scotch ales, but I'm diggin' this beer. I'd drink this again if given the oppertunity."
""
"O - One of the better scotch ales that I have had. No one flavour dominated the nose or palate. Very complex and very well balanced."

""
""

""
""
""
""

"The title its not normal sums this beer up. Poured into my trusty pint glass. golden color with nice head. smells a little strong and taste smooth as candy. Moutful feeling for a nice 6 pack to have on a daily basis. I would recommend this scottish ale"
"Overall: I don't think I have had any other Scottish ale, so this is my benchmark. I quite enjoy it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice bold fruity sweet Scottish Ale with more of an alcohol presence than the ABV suggests..."
""
""
"Overall: another impressive brew from a great brewery. Flavorful, close to the true spirit of the style with the mouthfeel to improve the drinkability."
""
""
"D/O: A fine example of a style that often runs way too sweet for my liking. I appreciated the balance in this beer, and would certainly repeat this in the future if the opportunity presented itself. That said, I have a second in my fridge right now, and will opt to instead open something else up."
""
""
""
""
"O - Tatsy, but not very inspiring. It is a really easy drinking malt and smoke forward beer though."
""
""
""
""
"O - It's a pretty good, malt/dark sugar brew, but presents just a tad too much burnt/bitterness to make it jump to the front of the pack. I'll definitely buy more because I enjoy the style, and it's close - like a pitch on the corner - but it's not the best in its class. I'd like to see the finish linger longer, and feature more of a straight-ahead caramelized malts with just a touch of peat smoke quality where I'm left remembering the malts and sugars rather than the hops."
""
""
""
"Very chewy malt backbone, and a malt lovers dream. Well right after Doppelbocks of course."
""
""
""
""
"O= This is a solid example of an underepresented style. Great malty character with a nice display of the complexity malt can have on a beer. Worth trying over and over again."
"Overall, it's just sort of blah. It's malty, with some overcooked-broccoli hops. Meh."
"Slightly disappointed in this one. I think I was just expecting something else."
""
"Most likely my favorite Scottish Ale. They are usually way too boozy for my taste. Thank you 3 Floyds. Highly recommended. Looking forward to dining at the brewpub for my birthday this weekend."
"Poured from bottle to pint glass the beer arrives a mahagoney amber brown color with a 1 finger off-white head. Excellent retention and lacing. The nose is that of roasted malt, dark fruits, sweet caramel, and a hint of chocolate. No hint of alcohol at all. The flavor begins with the roasted malt and is soon merged with the caramel malt sweetness found in the nose. A subtle chocolate flavor blends well with a dark fruit tone. Mildly bitter. Finishes creamy and smooth with a lingering caramel sweetness. A little dry. Medium bodied and creamy. Nice mouthfeel. Overall, this isn't a style I flock to though this is a good beer and one that I would enjoy again and again. Recommended."
"O - Amazing scent, but pretty average (slightly above) after that."
""
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, creamy and smooth on the tongue. This is a really nice scotch ale without an overbearing booze presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"poured into a tulip - a deep burgundy pour with about an inch of off white fluffy head. smells of chocolate, berries, oak, and toffee rise up quickly. very chocolatey tasting, a musky grape backbone with toasted grains. very rich and creamy and a bit fun on the cheeks with the combination of sweet malts and roasted grains - this is delicious, of course another great 3 floyds beer (what a surprise..)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - what a great tasting brew from FFF. This is one I could enjoy every evening. Malts are plentiful and tasty. It's flavors are complex enough to keep it interesting yet remaining well balanced. Robert the Bruce is way up there on my 'go to' list and is hard to pass up everytime I see it on shelves. What would I do without FFF. Just a solid and great tasting beer."
""
"Overall - I would and will purchase this one again, really nice flavors here, alcohol is hidden perfectly, and there are so many nice flavors here to enjoy. Stands up well to flavorful salads and pizza. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
"Pretty easy drinking but not what I would expect from a scottish ale at all. This reminds me a lot of Pride and Joy from Three Floyd's in that it is a decent beer, but far from close stylistically to the beer it's labeled as."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid, especially for the style. Nice depth of flavor. Tons of malts and sweetness, but it's never overbearing. It mystifies me that Three Floyds can make something this malty and turn around and make their hop juggernauts. Skill."
"Medium body, low carbonation, crisp and smooth. A different take on the Scottish Ale style, and I like it."
"Pours a hazy mahogany with ruby highlights and thin tan head which quickly dissipates. The carbonation is moderate and mouth-feel is smooth. The nose is caramel malt, dark fruit, vanilla and Oak?. Taste is caramel, roasted malt, burnt sugar, tangy dark fruits, good bitterness and vanilla towards the end. It’s well balanced and very drinkable."
"M. Medium bodied, sticky texture complements the heavy flavors within quite well, carbonation is high enough to frame the flavors properly without being distracting."
"This here beer is therefore a standard bearer, meaning it is to some degree beyond reproach. (That ain't the only degree, though, because otherwise Sierra Nevada Pale would get a perfect 5 on this here site). Mostly, though, it pulls off the rare feat of blending a brewer's completely unique, completely recognizable identity with enough of a style's signifiers to still count as belonging to that style without being a boring, boilerplate example of that style."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is a bit too dark for how drinkable it is. The body is smooth and slick and does not become sticky or coating at any point. The carbonation is just fizzy enough to increase the drinkability without inhibiting the flavors."
""
"overall - while the flavors are above average and enjoyable for a sessionable malt fix this beer is lacking some alcohol heat"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is on the light side of medium. It goes down pretty slick and finishes chalky and dry. Overall it's a good beer, but struggles to live up to 3F's other offering. Perhaps not being hop-centric is a hindrance on that, yet the flavor is solid and I would certainly drink another."
""

""

"O- A very nice winter beer, one that holds up to the nip in the air and warms you up. While I would normally suggest pairing a beer in this style with salmon, here I am thinking perhaps chocolate cheescake or perhaps bacon wrapped apricots."

"T: complex and well balanced, all the aromas are present, the body is heavy, the aftertaste is bitter and the alcohol is noticed, more smoky flavour than sweet caramel"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - FFF really killed it on their take of a Scottish Ale. All the sweetness is there, that you would expect of the style. Their ""not normal"" take is to add a nice balance of hops to go along with the sweetness. Great stuff."
"Overall: From the aroma I wasn't wxpecting the sweetness up front. It was a nice welcome though. Definitely a decent Scottish Ale. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""

"O: A very good scotch ale. I enjoyed the slight hoppy undertone I've come to love throughout the FFF beers. Very well balance."

"Overall, I like this. I had my first Scottish ale about 2 weeks ago when I cracked this six pack so I don't have much to compare to but once again 3Floyds puts out a quality product."

"Overall: Pretty hoppy for a Scottish Ale, giving it a little more complexity than most. However, I feel that the bitterness is a distraction from the malts."

"O: Well, my review makes this look like a bad beer. It's not. In fact I think Three Floyds has made a very good Brown Ale here. It's light, sweet, and has just enough delicate roast to it that makes it highly quaffable. But I grade to style and Robert the Bruce misses the mark in that regard."
"O- Simply put, just wonderful!"
"O: I think this a fantastic brew, and one that pays homage to its respective style"
"No date code, but I think this is a seasonal and I believe my sample is fresh. Beer pours out a brownish color with a tan head. Not much lacing or anything too remarkable. Smells like toffee, some faint dark chocolate, molasses, and yet no smoke which I find sorta odd. Tastes nicely bittersweet, some rich dark roasted malts, with a slight bitter aftertaste. Nicely balanced. Not very earthy or peaty like I have found with other Scottish inspired ales. I swear years ago this was a different beer, big earthy malts and sweet alcohol but now it reminds me of a nice brown ale. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer but quite uncharacteristic of the style and somewhat ""normal"" for a Three Floyd's beer. Mouthfeel is fine. Overall a decent beer but kinda marginal for such an awesome brewer. And please, date code your beer guys..."
"Overall, this was a bit nicer on draft as the flavors are bolder. Great brew and im sure glad I have access to it year-round."
"Pours to a dark amber color with a creamy head. Great retention. The malts really come through on the nose of this beer. Lots of caramel with a hint of toffee and bread. As with almost everything Three Floyds produces, I really enjoy the taste of this beer. Very malty, but with a subtle estery sweetness. I taste the caramel notes and the finish is wonderfully bitter. Very smooth with a creamy full body. This is a very good beer. An interesting and refreshing take on the Scottish ale. Nice work again, FFF."
"Mouthfeel is very light and thin with very mild carbonation, a light body that borders on medium and a slightly bitter finish that’s sweet as it slides down like there’s caramel or syrup in milk. Not a session beer for me because it’s not my favorite style, but this beer went down very easy for 7% ABV and I did enjoy it quite a bit."
"O: Pretty decent, I would even venture to say 'good' though this style isn't my favorite. A hearty malt-forward beers with good body and fairly decent flavors."
"This is one of my go to beers. Very enjoyable. Very drinkable. A good take on the style."
"D- I really enjoyed this one. It was a bit pricey but I'm certainly happy to have bought it, not my favorite of the style but tasty and complex none the less."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium as well. This a good scottish ale; however I would have preferred a bit bolder flavor. Good beer overall. Now I am going to don my kilt and start to dance...."
"Robert the Bruce is an uncomplicated ale; malty, sweet and smooth, with a whisper of bitter to finish, I could easily put down a few of these in an evening. This ale is comfortable and familiar, easy to have around and pleasant to drink. It won't shock the tastebuds, but will instead embrace and console them. Give ol' Robert a try!"
"Overall - Not great, but not bad. Glad I tried it. Nothing bad about the beer, just not so interesting. It's a style that I don't know a lot about, but it seems to me that this beer wants to be bigger than it is."
"O- haven't delved too much into Scottish ales...just dirty bastard which isn't technically a scotch ale. But this was pretty good."
"Overall Impression- Not one of FFF's best brews... I thought I would never see the day that I would say this but this one just wasn't bodied enough for me. Also should have had more richness and flavor. Will be moving onto my next FFF beer and will probably not come back to this anytime soon..."
"I saved two bottles for myself out of the 6-pack I purchased for myself and friends so this will be revisited in the near future."
"O- Not my favorite pick from Three Floyds, but nonetheless a solid beer. With a couple tweeks it could be even better."
"O- Now this is a Scottish Ale. One of my favorites from the Scdottish and Scotch Ale family. Big, deep, robust, malty flavor. Very enjoyable and well done by FFF"
"Pours a deep amber color with a chill haze. Little, silky head dies down to nothing. Aroma is full of roasted malt, peaty, and a touch floral. In the taste, malty, notes of chocolate, moss, peat and smoke. Mild bitterness combatting big roasted malt and brown sugar. Herbal, tea like notes along with a suggestion of American bittering hops. Fairly complex and completely delicious. Medium bodied, smooth & a good carbonation level. Overall, a fantastic Scotch ale with bold, yet enjoyable flavors."
"O - This is a nice Scottish Ale that had the perfect roast on the malts and really let the caramel and toffee flavors come to the forefront...with the higher ABV I couldn't see myself having more than one or two of these"
"O - This is a good beer, but nothing I'll be looking to get again anytime soon. The most impressive aspect of this one was drinkability. Goes down very easily, and the alcohol is masked very well. That being said, I WAS hoping for a more robust and bold beer, given the ABV. I don't have much experience drinking Scottish ales, but I'll be looking to try more in the future. I was fairly impressed with this one, but I'm hoping to try some that are a bit tastier."
"I like this beer. From 3 Floyds, though, I always expect something exceptional. I wouldn't shy away from this one, regardless."
"This brew is really nice, the brew pours as a nice brown color with a light tan colored head. There isn't too much lacing but the retention holds for a while. The smell of this beer is sweet with malts and it also has a little bit of earth of in there too. The flavors of caramel and malts set this beer off in the right direction. The aftertaste is a little nutty and dry. Not major bitterness in this brew at all. The mouthfeel is really easy to drink, could put a few of these down pretty quick if you wanted too. Overall this is a very nice Scotish Ale."
"O: solid beer, but may not be worth the 3F's billing. They have plenty of other beers, and this is not their best. It's not even the best Scottish ale in the world, but it's fine, and there aren't many available so here it is. Only better scottish ale I had was a home brew."
"O - It's a nice tasting beer with an alcohol kick, which I like."
"Lingering malty sweetness that finishes on the dry side. A hint of dark roast malt sticks around."
"O - A very satisfying brew, this would be easy to session and not grow tired of after the 3rd or 4th. I don't say that about many a beer, so FFF must've done something right."
"O: Delicious ale that did lack hop bitterness I would expect of this style. It is a sweet malt bomb that I would definitely enjoy again."
"O: Nice Scottish ale. very malty. I am happy that I was able to try it. I would order this again."
"Rich taste -- malty sweet up front with hints of maple, peat, and dried dark fruit. I didn't catch the hops presence in there, but even without, this is a superlative ale worthy of repeat purchase."
"Admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of the style. But this beer acquits itself just fine. Not something I will purchase on a regular, or even semi-regular basis, but a beer worth trying. Now, it's time for pizza."
"Overall, I would order this beer again. It was $3.50 pint night, so I couldn't pass up a value like that on a beer that's normally $5. If i'm in the mood for something a little heavier with some more flavor, especially in the coming colder months, I'll know where to turn for a solid brew."
"O: I like it. Perhaps my least favorite FFF I've had so far, but that's like picking the least favorite of a Lamborghini, Ferrari and Bentley."
"O - Over all a good Scottish ale that deserves respect. A little watery but the taste makes up what is not there in the mouth-feel. I don't really know the style that well so its kinda hard for me to judge this one. Thanks Dave!"
"Overall: A good beer and one I would happily enjoy, but I think I expected a little much."
"O: This one is difficult to rate. I had high expectations for my first Three Floyds beer and I really like big, malty Scottish brews. This one didn't quite meet those expectations, even though it is a good beer."
"A very robust and tasty Scottish Ale. Big thanks to Eric for bringing this treat by!"
"Overall i've never had a scotch ale like this. It's different not really smokey, or even malty, but it has some fantastic characters that make it extremely appealing. Really a distinct beer that blurs the lines."
"Overall: A bit too sweet if you ask me, although no one did. I would have liked a little more balance, but not bad at all. Not sure if I'd have another or not."
"Overall: I had heard and read good things about this brew, so I was pretty let down by what I found. I love FFF, and love this style as well. Unfortunately, IMO, a good Scottish ale, does not Three Floyds make. It came across as a mediocre homebrew."
"O: great overall, very balanced scottish ale. Looking forward to moving along the FFF roster."
"Having said that, this is still a flavorful and easily drinkable beer. I hope to someday meet Robert again, and see if we can't get along a little better."
"D: this is not a beer to be paired with much food: the amplitude of all its flavors would crowd most things out. Like its namesake, it's strong and defiant, aggressive even, but you're not put off because it's on the right side."
"O: Very drinkable--the 6.5% ABV is virtually undetectable. Goes down well. This is my first example of the style, so I'll have to try other varieties to really get a sense of how this compares. I like it, though. Mellow, rich, malty beer."
"Cheers!"
"To be honest, I am a little surprised by just how much I loved this beer. I usually consider myself more of a hop-head, and don't really ever venture into this kind of malty territory. With that said, all I can really do at this point is raise my glass to another stellar offering from Three Floyds."
"Pours a clean mahogany color with small cap of off white head, little retention and lacing. Scent is a big initial whiff of heavily toasted malt with dark caramel and notes of prune and fig but seems to disappear quickly. Taste is mild, a initial dry toasted malt before light sweetness comes in in the form of dark caramel, definite nuttiness, fig and notes of earth and chocolate poke through. medium bodied, smooth and clean. Some good notes but light and unremarkable for the style."
" Overall another solid beer From FFF. A nice straight forward easy drinking Scotch ale.Not very complex but nice.The more I have from them the more they move up my list of favorite breweries."
"D- the alcohol sneaks up on you on this one average drinkability but not something I would have many of. Overall a solid Scottish ale that hit the style with FFF absurdity. I like it."
"O: A pretty good beer, its not blowing me away, but quite drinkable for style."
"o - pretty tasty and seems to fit the style, but i can't imagine having more than 1-2 of these in a night. it would be like ordering 2 desserts and realizing halfway through the second one that it was a bad idea."
"O- it's alright, worth a try of course. I won't revisit but doesn't mean you shouldn't"
"the aroma is malty , roasted, chocolate, caramel. the taste , very nice nose. the taste is quite similar than the nose, some spices comes. Almost no bitterness, the aftertaste is caramelish, malty but very short. Very good beer afterall."
"O: I'm not a fan of scotch ales but this one is surprisingly tolerable."
"I like it, and I like Three Floyds. And I like Robert the Bruce and I like Braveheart. And Mel Gibson is okay, but he’s not real cool anymore and might be clinically insane."
"Kind of a cross between a scottish and brown ale. A very nice and drinkable dark ale by 3 Floyds."
"O: Not necessarily a true to form Scotch ale but I really enjoyed this one. I will definitely buy again."
"O: a really enjoyable session beer. I wish I had more access to it."
"O: A well executed Scottish ale."
"D - Very flat, no carbonation. slightly sweet and mouth coating."
"On tap at Three Floyds. This is a medium translucent caramel brown color. Smells include brown sugar and molasses. Taste is sweet brown sugar and aged oak or maple. Medium bodied and very drinkable. This is not overly exciting, but solid and refreshing."
"O- Eh, it was ok. I've had much better than this. Probably the only beer from 3F that was ok, I guess. Wont seek this one out again."
" ~ This is a beer I enjoyed while it was in my household. However, I will not be seeking this beer again, and will not recommend it to a friend."
"O: I enjoyed this beer, and I would recommend it to anyone that wants to experience this style. I will definitely buy this again if I can find it!"
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, oatmeal, and chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, and milk chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was quite a nice brew. Really nice for the style which is hard for me as I usually don't enjoy this style too much. The flavor was very nice on this one with the sweetness aspect going on here. Kept me coming back for more. The aroma was quite inviting as well. Definitely worth trying for any fan of the style or for anyone curious about the style in general."
"This is one of the more stick-to-your-ribs kind of beers I have ever had, would be excellent I think w/ bbq or maybe as a digestif paired w/ chocolate cake."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of Fata2683!!). Pours clear mahogany with massive tan head. Active carbonation and some lacing developing. Aroma has caramel, dried fruit (apricot and dates noticeably) and some florals. Taste is sweet with caramel malts and dried fruit again. Medium bodied with slick texture and very smooth finish. A really easy beer to drink. Nice!"
"To sum this beer up… it’s good, not great. Now, may I have another?"
"This beer wants to be a barely wine but isn’t strong enough for it. This beer wants to be some kinda of Belgian style but doesn’t have the yeast. I’m not sure I get the Scotch ale but we’ll go with it. I don’t get why this is the 12 bottled 6 pack from them…many beers they make are better for this, but it is still a nice beer."
"Had a ""meeting"" with the boys tonight at a place called Scoreboards....was I surpirsed they had three floyds and more!!!! Anyway had RObert the Bruce as my starter. The color was a dark brown with rich foamy head that laced quite well. The aroma and taste was dominated by malt and caramel. The body on the beer was a little too weak I would have liked to have a bit more heavy body. The mouthfeel was ok. Certainly could do 3-4 of these....no problem."
"Solid scottish ale, appearance a dark burnt sienna with some auburn around the edges in the translucent areas. Nose was somewhat muted and the malts didn't come through in a big way. Taste was well balanced and enjoyable, a solid scottish ale for sure."
"The CPJ"
"Draft to plastic pint glass. Appearance is good; deep amber/bourbon in color. Smell is almost nonexistent, with a subtle malty undertone. Taste is good. Malty. Just not what I expected (although it's still good). Mouthfeel is good; low carbonation for easy sips. Overall, a good beer, but a little subtler than I expected."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer. Very drinkable with a 6.5% ABV. Also had one of my favorite labels... very neat to look at ha"
"Pours a nice dark chestnut color with a fairly thin head that fades to a ring and thin swirly cap. Lots of firm malt with a tofee and Horlick's powder aroma. Similar very firm maltiness in the taste with a bit of a sweet almost vanilla finish as well as some earthy and piney hops that play a supporting role to the malt. Long finish and almost chewy mouthfeel make this fairly nive as well. Quite decent."
"O - Good sweet notes and some good bread grain. Overall a very good Scottish Ale. Quite delicious even though this is not my favorite style."
"Addendum - I got another growler of this recently. I don't know, I guess I really like it! I have to regrade the nose and give it higher marks. When I was drinking this growler, I found myself holding the empty glass up to my nose after finishing a serving of this. I freaking loved the aroma coming out of that glass. It had this nice nutty, sweet, rich home-made pie kind of smell. This beer is definitely growing on me."
"O - Pretty good beer, not a fan of Scottish Ales in general, but this is easy to drink and non-offensive. Wouldn't mind drinking it again."
"O: An excellent beer. One of my first of the style. A good representation of what I'm told it should be. My favorite FFF beer."
"Overall - Nice to see a Scottish Ale in bottles. Very quaffable even at this ABV. Happy to have tried it, but I'll seek out other FFF's brews before picking up more than this."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It was kind of a malt showcase, but there was enough roasty bitterness on the finish to balance things out and keep your palate interested. Pretty drinkable, given the ABV."
"Hard to tell on appearance, but it was nice and black. Smell is tons of malt and subdued hops...appropriate for the style. Taste is pretty smooth. Although I'm Scottish, this isn't my favorite type of brew, but plenty respectable. Mouthfeel is exceptional on this, surprisingly smooth and easy to drink. Overall, I like it and recommend it as a fine example of its style."
"I must say that I have never had something bad from Three Floyd's and this is true with this one. I don't believe I will ever run into one of their beers that is not above par. Thanks to CaptainNomihodai for this one."
"O: Not the strongest effort from FFF"
"Overall- It is a nice beer, but not my favorite. I love the label, but I could list out a dozen other beers from FFF that I would choose before this."
"Overall, good beer. I like the flavor of it, and it's a well crafted brew."
"Enjoyed the complex character and drinkability of this Scottish Ale. Although not well versed in the style, the taste profile of Robert The Bruce appears spot on."
"D-Really like this beer. Very balanced and easy to drink. LIke to drink this on a cold day or even a nice summer evening!"
"Overall: This was a pleasant surprise from 3Floyds. This beer does not get enough love; it is one of the best Scotch ale's brewed stateside that I have had. Another success for a great brewery."
"To sum it up, it's caramelly and chocolate in the front, small roasted and coffee notes in the back. All in all, one of the best examples of style I can think of. Complex, drinkable, and impressive."
"I was really impressed with this beer and how drinkable it is. Usually malty ales like this are something that I enjoy, but savor. This beer is quite quaffable and a nice change of pace from my usual beer choices. Too bad it is not easier for me to get my hands on."
"This is a drinkable Scottish ale and is more bitter than others I have had. I feel like this is a blend of 70% brown ale and 30% Scottish ale."
"D: Could easily down a 6 pack, seems a little weak. Not my favorite 3 Floyd's; don't go out of your way for this."
"D: ive never been one to drink many scotch ales, but purely because of the super malty nature. this i could have a few and be ok with it. quite nice, and recommended."
"Overall not an overpowering beer. Too complex to call it a session but very drinkable with little carbonation. Taste is quite malty for an ale, in fact if I did a blind taste test I would probably think I was drinking a german schwartz bier (black beer)."
"D - Not too bad to drink, but I couldn't drink more than one. The sweetness on the palate becomes overwhelming after one pint."
"D: So long as I was not smelling this, and just drinking it liberally, I could drink this all night, quite drinkable in that regard. Otherwise, I would only purchase this once in a blue moon to try and recall if this is no good. I will, however, likely try this again once I get another bottle."
"Thanks to dgfair for the extra. 12 oz bottle (no date) poured into a dimpled mug. Pours a rich mahogany with a thick, fizzy cream-colored head that quickly dissipates to very thin lining. Aroma is big dark malts, caramel being the most pronounced, with a bit of raw sugar, scotchy peat, and fresh bread. The first sip bursts with complex malt flavors, and the chocolate makes an appearance. A tiny hoppy presence smooths out the chocolate up front and leads into more standard malts, as bread and caramel fill the palate next. Something is hiding in the depths of the flavor, maybe a touch of maple syrup? Smooth, a bit creamy, but not heavy. ABV is just right, unnoticeable but enough to give the beer a backbone. Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Overall a good American Scottish Ale!"
"D: I wouldn't want another glass of this; if i have it again it will probably be for a re-review at the insistence of someone else."
"D - Pretty drinkable, but this style isn't my first choice when looking for a sessionable beer."
"Pours a crystal clear ruby color with no cloudiness what so ever. Head formed with only the slightest help, with a off white hue. The head was a bit thin but hung around for a bit. No lacing threw the glass as it was consumed. The aroma was hardly noticeable for this style. Most brews I have had in this style the aroma is not as strong as other brews but this particular brew was barely there. The taste was up front bitter hops with only a hint of a malty background. The malt was not forward enough for this particular style or really my preference. The carbonation was over done and pushed way to much of the hops forward. I was left with a acidic taste and feeling in my mouth. I was looking forward to try this brew as it is one of my favorite styles but was unable to stomach it. Hopefully I had a old or bad bottle. Probably with age is that I will never know due to the lack of any dating on the bottle. I will give this a try again in the future and re-review if needed."
"A clear ruddy brown ale with a head that quickly fades to a thin but persistent ring. Aroma is toasted malt with a little hint of chocolate. Flavor continues the malt-forward theme, easing from sugar to caramel sweetness, with just enough roastiness and alcohol to keep it from being cloying. yeast contributes some dark candied fruit notes. No hop aroma to note, just a bit of bitterness indistinguishable from the effect of the dark malt. The balance leans more toward the roast as the beer warms, which is a good thing for it. Overall a very pleasant and sessionable beer with the ABV well-hidden if you're not hooked on hops."
"Drinkability: This was very easy to put down. The carbonation was delicate and light, and the beer itself is solid."
"Poured into a tulip. Dark brown with a nice initial head, dissipates quickly. I don't get much for smell. A little malt but I have to work at it. I was a little disappointed. Taste is mostly malt with a little hops. Kind of dark roasty & sweet. More hoppy than I expected. Most of the flavor is towards the middle and finish. A good heavy but not my favorite."
"It has excellent carbonation and is light to enjoy multiples of. Overall I just can not get past the excessive maltiness. If you like that style then you would probably love this beer. I tend to prefer more hops, so it is hard for me to see past that."
"D- This really isn't my style but I found this particular example highly drinkable."
"D - it's easy to drink, and it doesn't taste offensive. it's a pretty drinkable beer."
"Notes: Like some fast cars, this bad boy looks nice and smells nice, but doesn't deliver out on the road."
"D - A highly drinkable Scottish Ale. I wish I could pick up a 4 or 6'er or whatever they bottle it as here in Ohio, but sadly... not so. Thanks for this one Josh!"
"Recommended for those seeking a maltier beer with little hop presence. I usually like my beer very hopped up and I found this brew to be a very nice change up."
"drinkability: very solid scotch ale and one of the best Ive had in the category"
"Overall: Lives up to the hype."
"D - Very nice, easy to drink beer. Good for a cold (take that with a grain of salt) winter's night in So Cal."
"D: Nice drinkability. Perhaps not a true Scottish Ale by definition but pretty close. Good drink."
"This beer pours a light bodied, burnt mahogany in color with red accents in the light and with no head. The aromas are of sweet malt and a moderate nuttiness, probably a hazelnut. It's solid but nothing special. The flavor is solid. I like it for the style but it isn't anything too special. It drinks pretty light in body and leaves a sweet, nutty after taste behind. I'd prefer it a little heavier. It's just ok and drinking it is no problem at all, if you want to."
"I poured this into a pint glass thanks to Kirkpjr. I was greeted with a finger worth of tan head on top of a ruby brown colored body. The aroma was nice and malty sweet with a little toasted note found in there as well. The flavor was sweet toffee and lightly roasted coffee with a slight alcohol heat. There also was a slight bitter present as well. The mouthfeel was medium with light carbonation. It was a easy to drink high ABV scotch ale. I think I could have drank a couple of glasses of this, but I might run into trouble with anymore."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. So many better brews by FFF. Don't worry about trying unless you're a fan of the style."
"D: Lower drinkability because of the finish. Glad I only have one that was in a mix six from Casanova's."
"Brown with reddish hues and a bit of white head around the edges. Lots of roastiness on the nose that comes across on the tongue first and foremost. A hint of fruitiness as well on the tongue and some crisp carbonation. A very good representation of the style :)"
"This beer pours a deep amber color. The aroma of this beer smells of almost like a scotch or whiskey smell. There is a malt aroma which reminds me of that. The taste is malty and sweet, with a good hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is medium and is a drinkable beer."
"D: A good beer to enjoy on a cold, lazy winter night, but not particularly outstanding in any way. One or two would be fine - any more would probably be a bit tedious."
"D: Not too bad. More than one pint would get boring, though."
"Overall impression: Nice brew here, recommended."
"Notes: It's still a good offering from the FFF, and a nice beer at that, and while it sure manages to retain some of the malty sense, and feels rather tasty, the hoppy side makes one not want to file it as a Scottish Ale..."
"D: A style for the beer drinker with a sweet tooth, Robert the Bruce doesn't dissapoint. However, its not as deep and full bodied as I'd like overall. Definitely worth a try as with almost the entire FFF line-up."
"D. Very good. A friend recommended this to me awhile ago. I'll definitely be picking up more of this in the future."
"The beer is served surprisingly with a finger of ecru foam (though not carbonated in any way) atop a dark brownish red body. The aroma is of hops, caramel and clove. I also detect a hint of herbs that I really don't know the origin. The taste is pretty darn good. It's not a wow beer, but it's really pretty good. The main tastes are of brown sugar, clove and ginger. The fact that this beer was on cask made it all the better. The mouthfeel was nice even though it was warm. And it drank like bottled water...oh so smooth. I would definitely recommend it in this form."
"Nice to see this on cask 'round here. It pours a clear dark amber-brown topped by around a finger or so of dirty white foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, light maple syrup, nutmeg, walnuts, and a light bit o' wood. The taste holds notes of light roasted malts, rye bread, brown sugar, flowers, corn, wheat, and toffee. The body is a straight medium, with barely any carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a nice bit of ale, something that could, in cask-conditioned form, catch on if offered more often."
"This is a six-pack beer? Oh, how luck the people of Indiana are. This is a pretty incredible beer to be put into six-packs of 12oz. bottles. One of my very favorite scottish ales."
"overall - fun to try a bottle aged a year, but it really didn't make that big of difference. I'd be interested what a couple more years does to it. This beer is too nutty for my preference."
"D - Easy to drink. Sits well with the palate. One of the better Scottish Ales to have with a meal I would say."
"The body is medium to medium/full with a pretty low carbonation level and a with a decent residual sweetness . All of these combine to just not please me that much. Even with all of the above noted problems is still is a drinkable beer but I feel like it could be improved and refined into something much better."
"Poured a dark, clear ruby red. Minimal head gone in seconds. Nose of roasted malt and slight alcohol aroma. Am I imagining peat malt? Taste of sweet caramel malt up front. Mild hops at the finish. Medium body with mild carbonation. Decent drinkability."
"This went superbly well with a shepard's pie."
"D- I have had this beer before when I wasn't really into the good beer. So I guess I kinda forgot about it. Now that I'm converted to the good beer, I really like this beer and will get it again."
"This is a great beer. It has a lot of flavor with a fairly low abv. I have had it before and will certainly have it again."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. At first I kept thinking how much it tasted like a brown ale and wasn't going to review it so high, but after some research it's right on the money. Easy to drink, taste great, wish I traded for more."
"D: This beer is drinkable, but not something I would really seek out. This, like all Three Floyds beers have just failed to impress me, but are still drinkable. 3.5/5"
"Alright, but this one needs a stronger body."
"Pours a very hazlenutty brown color with a small tan head that leaves nice lacing for it's style. Aroma is caramelized brown sugar, raisin and some figs. Also has a nice malty aromas that is perfect for the fall. The flavor is big time caramelized malts, almost like a piece of raisin bread. Big toffee notes followed by some sweet caramel notes. There is a nice smokey component that leaves way to a bran like cereal note. The mouthfeel is perfect with medium carbonation. This does have some astringent flavors that leave the palate dry and a bit austere. I really like this the second time around, may e it's the fall now, or the beer came to it's own, but this is really good."
"I poured this beer from the bottle into an imperial pint glass. The smell of this beer is very enjoyable to me. The first thing that hits nose is a nice whisky smell followed by carmel, coffee, and fresh wet earth. The color is a nice dark golden brown with just a little quickly dissipating head. The taste of this beer is an almond and carmel with a coffee and wet earth finish. The beer really changes in your mouth is what i like about it. You experience all the different changes of flavor. This beer is full of nice rich flavors but also light and earthy enough to be very drinkable. I can never go wrong with a Robert the Bruce."
"Crimson brown color with a small head that did not last long before settling to a thin layer of suds. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. Rich malty aroma. Hints of caramel, vanilla, a little fruit, and some wet earth. The flavor is not as impressive as the aroma but it is still a good example of the style. Mostly caramel with a slight herbal edge in the finish. There is a alcohol flavor at the finish as well. This is not overly sweet which is a good thing in my book. The alcohol in the finish hurts the body a little. It starts off as having the sensation of being thick and rich until the alcohol comes in and it seems to evaporate the beer off the tongue. One of the better examples of a somewhat unexciting style of beer."
"An easy drinker overall. Kinda like a toned down barleywine."
"D: ""It's Not Normal"" is the FFF slogan. This is definitely not a normal Scottish ale - If it were, it wouldn't have been so dang drinkable."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this one, it was bready and malty sweet but didn't become too cloying for me, I could handle a couple three a night."
"doubt I could have more than 2 in a sitting. the combination of sweet and malty, along with it being medium bodied would make me too full. doubt i'll pick up another 6 pack of this, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered one."
"D- Not too high, considering Three Floyds isn't distributed out here. If it were available to me all the time, I'd probably get one every once in awhile."
"The body is full, but the flavor is lacking and watery so it is confusing to drink."
"D: This is bready malty goodness; I was really surprised by how much I liked this beer; I think the chewy, somewhat sugary breadiness does become a tad tedious but all in all this beer is solid"
"Robert the Bruce is my first Scottish Ale and I like it. However, being a big fan of Scotch Ales/Wee Heavy I miss the fuller-body, sweeter heavier caramel and roasted malt of the Wee Heavy."
"Drinkability -- Honestly, not my favorite FFF beer; the roast malt sweetness isn't quite deep enough in complexity, the hops are too pronounced for the style. While not a favorite of mine, it's certainly not a bad beer, and definitely not normal."
"Smooth, tasty, and on the lighter side; you could drink a few of these easy."
"D= a nice ale for a cold day. Serve with beef or lamb stew, or a spicy cigar."
"Smoked fish with capers, meatballs, maybe lasagna, or a mac and cheese."
"Poured a nice deep cherry maroon with a thin white head. Spotty lacing, hazy and somewhat murky. Nice deep caramel and brown sugar, touch of molasses but lots of fruit with a light cocoa dusting. Sugar plum happiness. A tinge of metallicness that kind of offsets things but I'll forgive. Rich and moderate bodied with comfortable carbonation. Quite drinkable if I say so myself. Review from notes."
"Unfortunately, this is the only Three Floyds beer at the store I visited on a trip to Indy for the Final Four. Knowing the reputation of the brewery, though, I had to give it a try. The color is as dark as can be while still being able to see the ruby red glow shining through the middle of the glass. A one-finger fizzy head forms with the pour, but it disappears after a few minutes, leaving only the dark, reddish liquid that looks like a glass of Dr. Pepper. The aroma is grainy, but in a more positive way than I normally use that term, with an underlying caramel sweetness. The flavor is relatively smooth and mild but is still quite sweet and bready, especially as it warms. The texture isn't very robust, with only a very fine carbonation saving it from being too thin yet almost syrupy. This one is certainly interesting, but it is not a reason for me to want Three Floyds to expand their distribution."
"Overall, solid offering and Scottish Ale from FFF. I like the flavor balance of the different malts. With todays craft beers trying to make the biggest and baddest DIPAs and a balance of malt and hops; its nice to get a beer that has an interesting bouquet of MALT flavors..."
"ABV is not too high. If you like scotch ales, this is an excellent example and a great session beer."
"D - Good drinkability, rounds out nicely. Very easy to go back for another sip."
"Neat to try, but prolly won't return to it."
"Beer is simple and smooth, mostly roast in the back of the mouth. Not much else happening really. Just a plain ol' beer."
"Drinkability is very good. Very well-rounded beer."
"Poured into a pint glass a deep brown nearly black color. Light fluffy one finger head that recedes to a collar. Some really nice lacing as well. Smell is mainly malt with brown sugar and coffee undertones. Taste has a malty almost briney like characteristic to it a bit sweet as well, reminds me of brown rock sugar . Mouthfeel is chewy yet light. I could have a lot of these and would lve to try this on tap sometime."
"D: this beer does not have the overt smokiness that some Scottish ales do, but it is still quite delicious."
"D: A great all around Scottish style ale, one that has great complex flavors. With the slight lack of creaminess of other of the style, it offers a better drinkablity. Crisp on this brew is not only refreshing for all season drinking, but it could play into the part of the complex flavors. Seek Out, great brew."
"-not one of my favorite styles, but this beer is definitely drinkable. i like the roast in it and would indeed enjoy a pint of it"
"Poured from a 341ml bottle into a tulip, bottle courtesy of AJacob81! Cheers. Pours a deep purple/burgundy with a finger of tan head, slowly disappearing to just a collar of head atop. Took a whiff form the bottle and got some hoppy notes, but pouring this out, little hoppiness comes through in the nose. Very malty, with lots of raisin, grape, plum and other dark fruits coming through. Bit of alcohol in there too. Taste follows the nose, sweet with some roasty malt and a tiny bit of bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is there, but not at the forefront by any means. Mouthfeel is pretty full, and the carbonation is medium to low on this. Not really well versed in Scottish Ales, but this one was quite decent. I could definitely put back a couple of these, drinkability is quite good. Good, but not great beer from 3F."
"D- For a Scottish ale with more malt kick, pretty easy to drink. Won't buy it every time, but a good change up."
"D- great! This brew goes down smooth and does not have the sweetness overload that most Scotch ales are plagued by."
"This is easily one of the best Scottish Ales I've tried. Aside from tasting great, the structure is most impressive. This bottle has been sitting in the fridge for several months; I have no idea how much it differs from a fresh bottle, but it's fine the way it is. Recommended."
"Poured a slightly dark brown that has a dark amber color when held up to the light. Not a very big head on this one. I smell dark fruits and a little bit of chocolate. I also get some roasted malts. Hmmmm...the taste is very interesting...A bit overly sweet though. I get prunes, raisins, and plums in the aftertaste. Not much hop character, but a strong malt profile. This beer has candy sugar notes all over my palate. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but not too bad. The drinkability is not very high considering it is a little too sweet. I'm not against sweet beers, but this has too much of a sugary taste to me."
"D: This is a strange one, 6.5% is considerable, but really nothing for both this styles or other big beers. Either way there is a sure presences of alcohol in this one after a few sips. I only have three....but I've been drinking one each day, that must mean something. Not what you'd expect from a Scottish, but still enjoyable."
"D: I've had this beer a couple times and this time around I thought was a little tastier due to the freshness. Glad ii got to campare with a much fresher one. Very easy to drink scottish ale"
"Lightly sweet, has a somewhat bitter aftertaste, with decent carbonation and a medium body. Overall, not the best Scottish Ale I have had."
"D: The beer finishes pretty crisp. No real lingering flavors, and no palate fatigue. Overall, a decent Scottish Style Ale."
"EDIT: 02/14/12. Had another bottle of this tonight. Bumping the nose from a 3.0 to a 3.5. Nose has a lot more toasted and roasted malts to it, and some nuts. Pretty nice....I like this much better then the first time I had it."
"A very nice effort from the folks at 3 Floyds."
"Bottle. Thanks to mikesgroove for this Ubercool extra. Dark but clear brown colored pour. Aroma is quite sweet, reminds me of other american malt bombs like alesmith wee heavy. It leans towards molasses, some candied fruits, strawberry and also some peat. Taste is quite sweet, with a nice peppery touch from the alcohol. Palate is light and sessionable, some alcohol warmth. While it's not the best beers I've had overall, I just couldn't find any flaws. As good as it gets for a thin and malty brew. Glad I rate this style with the best. Thanks a bunch Mike, it is a great start!"
"Meh...this one just isn't doing it for me. It is drinkable, but the grainy backbone makes this one a little on the weaker side."
"One of these is enough on a night; I wouldn't turn one of these down, but I'd not buy a sixer of it."
"This is not a particularly drinkable style to my tastes, but this is perhaps more drinkable than average. Something beyond an introductory Scottish, but not quite up to the best efforts."
"D-Being my first 3F beer, I definitely enjoyed this one. I would consider smuggling one back to Ohio in my checked baggage if I get a chance to stop at a bottle shop on my way to the airport"
"D: While very drinkable, it's a bit too clean for the style. it reminds me more of a brown ale than a Scottish ale. Otherwise, it does taste good, and is definitely worth a try."
"D - Robert the Bruce is a pretty good beer. I've had better for the style and I do think 3F does a much better job per style with some of their other beers."
"D- easy to enjoy and very accessible to the non craft drinker. Good stuff."
"Glad I tried it, I would pick up a sixer in a second. It's kinda low in abv which calls for a few of them. Simple not outlandish, robert comes through."
"(D)- A solid beer. Great for the fall months when the leaves are falling. I could have a few of these then, but for the summertime its a little out of place. My only complaint is that this reminds me more of a brown ale than a scottish ale in my opinion."
"Smooth, carbonated...malty mouthfeel. Flavors are mild...and not really complex, but sweet and roasted. Tobacco and char flavors are light, but noticable. The warmer this beer gets, the better it tastes. Very drinkable. A nice, solid beer from FFF."
"Taste - Sweet with only the slightest hint of hop bitterness. No detectable alcohol and a smooth maltiness that really fills out the medium mouthfeel."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Flavors are middle of the road but I think I could put this stuff back all day long."
"Pours a deep tannic brown with a light creamy head that dissipates rapidly. Lacing is almost nonexistant. Smells strongly of roasted malts with some vanilla and toffee in the background. Taste was very mellow sweet malt with a slight hop kick at the finish. Some heavy carbonation going on with this beer. Light mouthfeel with a easy drinkability and nice abv. Good stuff. Nice offering in this style for 3F."
"Drinkability is good--an easy to drink beer, but very malt heavy."
"D: High marks here as the taste combined with the low ABV makes for a beer you could have a few of."
"pours a dark ruby red with a one finger light tan/white head, good lace. smells of robust sweetness, grapes, chocolate, and nutty malt. the taste is smokey with caramel malt solidly backing up the flavor, and a bit of sweet chocolate complimenting it nicely. Again, robust, forward, and bold, ending with a candied sweetness and soft peat. mouthfeel is leaning toward light and slick. this was my transition beer from BMC, and i appreciate it to no end."
"M/D- medium bodied with a good touch of carbonation.good mouthfeel and good drinkability. smooth."
"Delicicous beer. Would track down again."
"Flavor matches the nose, with a very drinkable balanced finish, excellent afternoon beer, just not over the top. I would like to retry this in the bottle as the 3Floyds are known for their hops, which are not dominant here off the cask, well done but there are better out there."
"Drinkability - Not bad, one a night would be perfect for me though."
"Others have said how it's more like a Strong Brown ale, which the mouthfeel totally gives, but i do get a bit of earthy peaty notes like i do from most scotch ales."
"A pleasant departure from the hop heavy stuff I've been drinking lately (yes there are other beers out here)."
"Very drinkable even with the higher alcohol content. Received this sixer as a gift, will definitely spend my own $ on more from Three Floyds."
"D- This is an extremely drinkable beer in my opinion. so smooth and subdued. I wanted to stay with this tonight, and almost did."
"This is my first beer from Three Floyds, I loved it."
"D: If it weren't for the ABV I'd say this beer could be sessionable. The feel is there, solid but not thick, the flavors are bold but not overpowering. Good stuff, but I think it suffers from deflated ratings because it is not a typical Three Floyds hop monster."
"Overall, a decent scotch ale, but nothing impressive. It was good trying it, but I wasn't amazed. Fairly drinkable if I wanted to drink more of it of course."
"Thanks to my friend Diana for picking this up for me. Pours a dark copper body, topped by a beige, medium sized, foamy white head. Aromas are huge malts, brown sugar, biscuits and bread. Candy too. Taste is sweet brown sugar, huge malts, mild smoke notes, bready, earthy. Good! Finish is slightly boozey, sweet and bitter. Good overall example of a scotch ale. 3F does it again!"
"Pours a ruddy dark brown without much head. The aroma is sweet and malty. The taste is slightly smokey, but mainly it's just a malty sweet taste. Relatively clean tasting excellence that really impresses me as an everyday beer form a brewery that seems to be mainly known for its epic beers. I'm so glad this is now available in Ohio after being unavailable forever."
"D: I have a growler of this and I expect it to be gone by tomorrow night. I love FFF. Having growlers now at Party Town in Florence of FFF is a dream come true."
"My first experience with Three Floyds has been a good one. I Look forward to trying more of their offerings. Recommended"
"Searched high and low for this brewery's stuff, and finally found this. Pours deep red brown with tan head that flattens to a murky surface. Aroma is sweet malts, light roasted malt, ripe fruit, and alcohol. Deep malt complexity with a roasted malt flavor that lingers. Smooth and refined with no afterbite. Nice middle of the road mouthfeel. Light hopping to balance. I was pumped to try my first Three Floyds brew and I was not let down. Looking forward to scrounging up a different one."
"I've had this on tap and from a bottle, and I must say that this is probably my least favorite FFF beer. That's a good thing though, since this guy isn't that bad. A dark hazy brown in the glass with some tan head that sticks around a while. Smell is of some caramel, dark fruit, a hint of chocolate, and something that I can only describe as ""bock-y-ness"". Typically bocks are not my favorite beers due to something in the malt bill that I can't put my finger on. I know that's a broad claim to make, but there seems to me to be the same quality here. Taste follows suit with some nice notes of chocolate and caramel, but then that bock flavor hits again... reminds me of an artificial grape flavor, really. Little or no hop presence to be noted. Creamy and smooth, the MF isn't bad at all on this beer, and drinkability is a little limited by the fact that I'm not a huge fan of the taste. I can see why people like it, and technically, I think it's a pretty well-crafted beer, it just doesn't appeal to me THAT much."
"The amount of earth and sweetness impede the drinkability a bit. A good beer, but this is a little less exciting than the other 3floyds beers I've had."
"After sitting unrefrigerated in my garage for at least a year or more, I finally rescued this one for a try and boy am I glad I caught it before it turned on me. It showed a deep ruby mahogany color with a full light tan head and good lacing. The aroma is simply a sublime malt with a hint of whiskey, really great. The flavor is very smooth malt, heavy but blended so nicely with a mildly hop sweetness. There's minor alcohol presence with good drinkability, medium bodied. A beautiful malt experience."
"Pours a lovely dark amber brown color with a small white head that was gone quickly and no lacing. Lots of nice aromas coming out of this one. Chocolate, lots of caramel, light smoke, and barely any hoppiness. Taste is loaded with rich caramel, light chocolate and some roastiness, little to no bitterness. Medium mouthfeel but very little carbonation. An all around enjoyable and drinkable scotch ale."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. Maybe not 100% to style in some areas, but its mostly there, and if we all made the same scotch ale, then all of them would be boring. I like the dryness on the finish, i like the extra hop presence (even if it isn't that much extra, its fun to see what its like) and i really like how drinkable this beer is for the style. An excellent beer, would love to try the barrel aged version as i think we might have a backwoods bastardish experience. A very nice beer."
"D-Better than I remember. This is a very pleasant and well craft brew. I could see myself putting down quite a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really liked this one. It was very tasty and went down very easy. I would definitely buy this one again."
"Solid Scottish ale. As the alcohol is well hidden I could put four or five down before getting tired of its sweetness."
"This one pours a dark brown, Coke-like, with a 3/4"" head, leaving big lacing all the way. Smell moderately of malt, and tastes moderately of malt and caramel. I normally don't much care for scottish ales as they tend to have too much caramel, but this one is a little on the light side which works for me. Carbonation is about right, and it's very drinkable. One of the better scottish ales I've had."
"Overall - Well done scottish ale. It's easy to overlook the bruce with all the amazing brews FFF has to offer, but I'd stack this up against any other scottish ale out there."
"This poured a clear mahogany with almost no head. It smelled like brown sugar and rye bread and roasted barley, with some alcohol. It tasted like roasted barley and copper hops with some brown sugar and a bit of oak. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty good scottish ale, but wasn't one of my favorites. It had a clean taste, but the malt wasn't terribly rich or delicious. It had good body but not great, and the alcohol was noticeable. It was still pretty easy to drink and enjoy, but was unimpressive."
"D: Pretty drinkable. It's not particularly noteworthy as a beer, but it is definitely easy on the palate."
"First review!"
"Notes: This is a great brew when you get a hankering for malt. Not quite as good from the bottle as it is on-tap, but still one that's nice to have around often. Surprisingly, it has a little more kick to it when from the tap, while many beers mellow slightly on-tap."
"Drinkability is very high. This is great for the style. FFF is one of my favorite breweries out there because they seem to be able to nail just about any style, and don't shy away from brewing ""boring"" styles in favor of ridiculous huge -bal aged beers. Good job, guys."
"D: Great. While sweet, it isn't cloying and I would be able to enjoy another of these. The smoky/peat character (whether accomplished by the yeast or malt) is there but not distracting. Reminds me of a Scottish ale with a German Alt twist--a tasty creation from 3F."
"Don't remember where this bottle came from but I suspect bret27. Pours a dark brownish amber color with a medium beige head. Aromas of bread crusts and caramel, simple but not bad. Flavor is similar but a little less robust than the aroma. Toasty with a hint of nuttiness. About what I would expect for my first Scottish Ale."
"Decent tasting Scotch but could use a bit more ""wow"". Like it a lot though."
"pours a clear dark brown color with a amber hue with minimal head with a beige ring and sticky lacing til the end..the smell was toffee , caramel, malts a slight roasted coffee smell..the tatse was sweet malts caramel and toffee/coffee..it was very good maybe a little to sweet for the style..the mouthfeel was good but not robust as i like... it was a tad watered down..this is still a delicious brew in the winter or with a meal..it is above average in drink ability with no alcohol detected ..you can easily knock back some of these..3fff is a great brewery in which i have access to and am glad to hoist their brews anytime/anywhere"
"D-I have been a FFF for 4 years and RTB is a good flagship beer to pair with Gumballhead, Pride & Joy, and Alpha King."
"What can be said about Robert the Bruce that he cannot say himself. Just take a sip and get lost in the nearly overpowering flavor explosion and the creamy tingly mouthfeel of this wondrous scottish ale. When Three Floyds brews a beer they usually do it right and RTB is no exception. Great beer to start the night off, or to pair with a big-ass deep dish pizza"
"3.5 D: No big flaws, but not show stopping either. A decent brew."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer that I haven't had in a little while and was a pleasant surprise to revisit. I would recommend to almost anybody."
"(edit) website is showing thie recent batch is 6.5%, might explain the thinness."
"D - Quaffable, without a trace of the 7% abv. Definitely worth a try."
"OVERALL not boldly peaty, but super smooth and easy drinking. Very good beer. I could session it."
"Will have to head back over to Indiana to pick up some more of this through the holidays."
"Taste is a bit watery. Certainly not unpleasant, but for a 7% brew I am shocked by how little flavor is here. There are small amounts of biscuit and caramel, but really not much else. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a lot of carbonation. I suppose if you were looking for a slammable 7 percenter than this would be a good choice but really I don't see the point of this beer. Either be a lower alcohol session beer or come with a little more flavor to reward careful drinking."
"Nothing groundbreaking here, alas, but this is very enjoyable and easy to drink and a good take on the style."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It is dark caramel with reddish highlights, a decent head forms and does not stick around very long. The aroma is caramel, peat, maybe smoke. The flavor follows, sweet and smokey. The alcohol is very well hidden, the finish is dry. The beer is smooth and creamy. This is a beer I could drink all night."
"Drinkability - I'm a fan of scottish ales, and this beer transcends the category. It's a FFF take on a scottish ale. As one of their least hoppy beers it shows that FFF's can perform more than adequately when they must constrain themselves to a more traditional style."
"Pretty easy drinking. I think the alcohol is well hidden. Nothing crazy and groundbreaking, just a solid malty scotch ale."
"D: This is a terrific malty brew that you could easily have 6 of before you knew it."
"Overall not the usual toe curler from three floyds. A rather drinkable session beer nonetheless."
"I really enjoyed this. Good flavors and nice balance."
"Served with a medium, off-white head and no lace. Color is a very dark amber with brown highlights. Aroma is very malty, sweet, a bit roasty, a hint of peat, caramel, toffee, and nice. Flavor's about the same. Perhaps with a touch more peat. Body is perhaps very slightly thin and good carbonation. Finish is pleasing; with a tad bit o' booze. Nice drinking beer. Seems like it's tamer than it used to be."
"Could drink this regularly for sure and the first I recall having in the 'scottish ale' category."
"Poured a deep ruby red with a 2 finger light tan head that faded fairly fast. Smells roasty, caramel, fresh coffee. Tastes VERY malty. not a huge fan of malty beers but this is decent for the style. I wouldnt seek this out again just because of its maltiness."
"D: A good sipping beer, just slightly out of the sessionable range"
"Not incredibly heavy, more medium I would say, although, despite the clingy head I thought the carbonation was a bit on the flat side, which I guess isn't that horrible considering the clean malty flavors. Not a bad scottish ale by any means, but i did feel it to be lacking in the flavor area. particularly with the clearly evident hoppiness, which I don't particularly like to find in my scottish ales."
"D - The appearance is disappointing to begin with but the nose is right and inviting. The flavor coupled with the mouthfeel really brings the glory out of this beer. Rich and complex it's worth reveling in but one will go far enough for me."
"Good finish and makes me thirsty for more."
"Pours a pretty dark reddish brown with practically no head. Smell is toffee, molasses, and toasted malt. A hint of chocolate, too. Taste is more toasted malt with some sweetness in the back, then again more toasted malt. A nice balance of flavors with the maltiness and sweetness. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Good drinkability, a delicious brew."
"A very solid beer. I could have another but i'm not one to pound back scottish-style ales."
"Notes: A nice overall beer that has good balanced elements, one of my more favorite scottish ales. I like the big malts, but sometimes it can be overwhelming, does a good job of being both malty and sweet and hoppy without covering either one up by overcompensating."
"Drinkability is impressive - alcohol stays tucked away and hidden, flavors are rich and yet balanced, complex and flavorful. Very nice beer."
"the brew didnt have much head, and was a muddy brown colour. the nose was quite malty, but still had a good amount of hop in it. the taste was exactly like how my home brew tasted, so maybe they're doing it wrong or i'm doing it right. the hops are the most noticeable thing in the brew, they seem to cut right through the medium malt body. the alcohol also sneaks up on you. overall the brew is a good one, but nothing of which I would want to have too much."
"D: Drinkable for the style, but definitely not a session-type beer, and doesn't have the complexity to really sit and savor."
"Picked this one up incognito at a nearby bottle shop after the owner returned from a trip to Chicago. I never picked this one up when it was available here, not sure why. Poured into a shaker glass. RtB appears a hazed copper color with about an inch of cream light rust colored foam. Tastes and smells of molasses, caramel malts, as it should, somewhat fruity, biscuits, sweet, malty, toasted bread. Medium in both body and carbonation. Worth a try if you like scotch ales."
"All in all a very good beer. I'm not a huge Scottish ale drinker, but this was a great example of one, and I'd readily have more."
"Final thoughts: I think everything that needed to be said was said. Kinda sweet, more like a porter than Scottish ale. Kinda big alcohol hit with spice and warmth as well as taste, deep fruit, chocolate, roasted malts, and charred earthy tastes. Very complex beer that needs quite a few sips to really experience it. I better keep sampling... for science."
"Not bad, but FFF has done much better."
"D - It's overwhelming flavor paired with its medium body doesn't lend towards a very drinkable beer but it's certainly good!"
"I would drink this if it was more readily available, but not if something like Alpha King or Moloko were available as well."
"Drinkability is high due a combination of good taste, middle of the road ABV and the mouthfeel."
"This has a good mouthfeel...light and crisp with a good, spicy finish. Drinkability is average, but doesn't mean I would crack open another one of these...the sweetness is well balanced, and the overall taste is very solid."
"Bottle thanks to FlssmrBrewAlum. Pours brown with a small ring of white head. Aroma of sweet malt, nuts, and peat. Flavor of sweet malt, some vegetal notes. This is the top Scottish ale? This confirms my previous opinions about Scottish ales...meh..."
"I enjoy this beer and it meet my expectations. Rich, but not so much that a 2nd would be out of the question. Well done."
"Decent enough, but there are much better examples out there."
"this beer is strange.i want it to have a thicker mouthfeel,it is reminscent of really water syrup.however,this beer is incredibly easy to drink.it's really quite strange."
"This beer has a very interesting taste, almost stoutish by mild, but yet at the same time a very big mouthful. There hints of tea, and hops at the end. This beer is so-so couldn't drink a ton of it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly flat, the only real unappealing aspect of the beer."
"Recent: Just found out that my next door pub has a great selection of beer on tap including Robert the Bruce and I must say that on tap I could easily give this beer an A-"
"A dark brown with a tiny head that disappears quickly. The aroma is magnificent malty, not coffee but maple syrup. The taste backs up the smell with a maple sweetness, not syrupy though. Very nice. I'm going to be off the normal curve on this one. A little oily on the mouth feel. This is more of a sipper than a guzzler."
"Pours a deep red/brown with no head at all. Has a great malty roasty nose on it, very appealing! Taste is really malty smooth and a little under carbonated but it's quite tasty. Has a good roasted taste that lingers. I think this is really quite good, I'd like to have it again!"
"Poured to a nice two fingered head with big bubbles. Head was a darkish white in color. Brew itself was dark brown. Kind of reminded me of some type of cola drink that had ice cubes in it. Had some lacing just not a lot. Smelled of chocolate, alcohol, and smoked malt. I thought it had a strong chocolate flavor. You could also taste that smoked malt and alcohol. I thought the alcohol taste might of been to much. Felt heavy in the mouth. That might of been from the smoked malt flavor. Ive had a few FFF brews and I thought this one wasnt typical of what Ive had from FFF. The higher alcohol content was evident. You would have to be carfull with this one. I couldnt make it a session beer."
"Overall, I'd call this a no-frills, Scottish drinkin' ale. Perhaps I got hold of an old bottle, but the flavors just didn't seem fresh or vibrant to me. However, the taste was pretty good, so I'm inclined to give this another go in the future. Pretty solid otherwise."
"Robert the Bruce is an ""okay"" beer, and the smell is quite tantalizing. Still, I expected a little better from 3Fs. The mouthfeel in particular disappoints. It seems to me there has been some misstep in its production. Probably won't seek it out again."
"This is the first Scottish ale I've ever tried and I must say I definitely picked a great example to open me to this style. Robust, flavorful and yet delicate and mellow in the flavors that peak and subside with each sip. A nice choice to end a fantastic evening of good food and good friends."
"A rather enjoyable Scottish Ale, great on cask. Recommended."
"But if you're a malt lover , this is your shit! you have to try it."
"D. Good scottish ale, not a favorite style of mine, This ale is definately a birdie, but not quite an eagle."
"D - abv is abit high to make this a session, but the flavor and relatively small body would make for a at least a couple in a sitting before changing it up."
"Highly recommend."
"""A full bodied Scottish-style ale with a well rounded malty profile and roasted biscuit-like notes 24 IBU 6.5% ABV"""
"Parents brought me a couple of bottles on their trip here from Indianpolis. Poured a small tan head that continued to hold up. Deep amber in color, with ruby highlights. Aroma is big time caramelly malt, a little biscuit, and just a wee bit hint of peet (probably from the yeast). Flavor is big time malty, again rich caramel, and slightly biscuitty. Medium mouthfeel. Finished sweet, but there is enough hop bitterness to keep it from finishing cloyingly sweet. Overall a very nice beer, I will buy a bunch of this whenever I can find it!"
"Just pick up a sixer and enjoy. This is a Scotch ale at it's finest and I've had many. Richly satisfying and a rewarding expierience for you're taste bud's to enjoy. Don't miss this one !!!"
"Very nice, another great FFF."
"Overall: GIVE ME ANOTHER!"
"Very smell and drinkable."
"a big thanks to sirsketch for sending this to me in the 80's bif."
"ok...so let me review...ive had three FFF beer tonight and all of them have been a let down to some extent...i dont know if it was the trip down here or maybe im being a little harsh because of all the hype that surrounds this brewery..i have a bottle of dark lord stored away for later i hope its not as disappointing as the ones ive reviewed tonight..thanks go out to beerad666 for letting me try these brews..."
"D - Fine example of a Scottish Ale. I was expecting something a little off-kilter from FFF, but instead I was treated to a very traditional, flavorful ale. While he wasn't much to look at, Robert the Bruce proved to be a tasty, malty brew that is a worthy flagship ale from FFF."
"Overall, this is a very good scottish ale. It is well balanced, smooth, and quite easy to drink. I will definitely keep my eyes open for it."
"D - This is my first Scottish ale. If I didn't know what it was, I might guess dopplebock. Good thing I like dopplebocks! I spent more time smelling this than actually drinking. I was surprised at the detection of alcohol, but it didn't detract from the experience. It was easy to drink, but I could see this becoming too sweet after a while. This would really hit the spot on a cold winter night."
"D: A good beer, but much too sweet for my tastes. I could probably force another beer down if I had to, but I'd rather switch to something a little lighter on the palate. I was hoping for a FFF twist on this beer, thinking there might be a higher dosage of hops than the average Scottish ale, but they most certainly were not there."
"D - This is a good beer, but I do prefer Dirty Bastard to this."
"Not a bad Scottish Ale, but nothing extraordinary. Brown in color, kind of on the drab side, not very exciting. The basic characters are there - nice peat and slightly smoky, malty and a bit nutty, but nothing really jumps out and grabs me. I tend to prefer drier beers but for a Scotch ale I'm really looking for that malty robust sweet flavor and this one isn't giving it to me. Not much in the way of spicy hops either, which wouldn't have hurt. However this was a nice and mellow brew, maybe I just wasn't in the mood."
"D: This is a very drinkable Scotch Ale. This is a good malty brew to pick up in a sixer if you just want a sweet beer that can kick back and have few of in a sitting. The slightly thinner body does help with the drinkability, making this go down pretty easy. I would absolutely seek this out if it was available nearby as a regular beer in my beer fridge. Just a good flavor that really stays with you. Dig it."
"D - There are only a handful of scottish ales that I can drink more than one of. This is one of those. The flavors are big but not overpowering."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, and some coffee aromas. Fits the style of a Scottish Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malts up front, slight hop background, sweet malts, an almost toffee flavor, and then a smooth roasted malt finish. Wow, for all the malt crammed in this brew it is still very easy to drink (almost deceptively so). Overall, this beer doesn't have a very good appearance, but makes up for it in flavor."
"I'll confess that I'm not a big fan of Scottish Ales in general - so take my comments in that context - I find them a bit too sweet. But I liked the Bruce pretty well because it tastes good. My complaints are that the body was a bit thin and I coundn't raise a head no matter how badly I abused it during the pour. Otherwise the appearance, etc., is about what you'd expect. As I said before, it tastes good."
"D: While I prefer the flavor of Dirty Bastard, this balanced offering from FFF is certainly a thirst quenching Scottish Ale. This is far more sessionable than some other similar beers."
"Drinkability: Very high. The flavors are very bold, but well-balanced and complimentary. I love Three Floyds, so there may be a little brand bias here, but I enjoy this beer more and more every time I have it. I""m surprised the overall score of this beer isn't higher - if you like Scottish Ales, one of my favorite styles, you'll love this beer."
"M/D - Rather thin mouthfeel, but ridiulously easy drinking. A touch more carbonation would be good."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep dark red color with a half finger of head that dissipates quickly, leaving just a ring of bubbles around the rim of the glass. Smells oaky and kind of bourbony. Taste is very smooth and oak flavored in my opinion. Medium-bodied mouthfeel that covers the tongue and leaves a malty taste on the tongue. Very drinkable, I finished the glass within ten minutes with no problem and wanted another. Another phenomenal beer from Three Floyds."
"drinkability: i'm enjoying this one. could probably have 2, maybe 3 in one sitting. i'm not well versed in scottish ales, but i will definitely have to try some more. i will buy this one again."
"D - I have tried several Scottish ales before, and I have to say this is by far my favorite. First ale I have had which I can definitely tell has a very ""bready"" taste. Nice flavor and easy drinkability. Alcohol content is hardly noticeable. Highly recommended."
"Poured a dark brown body with a minimal head and some lace patches. Roasted and toasted malts in the smell along with some dark fruit and hints of sugary sweet malts. Medium-bodied but still a little thick and viscous at times, this was a mostly sweet brew with some sour notes for balance. Sweet malts like caramel and bready malts make this a sipper, and it passes over with a moderate malt flavor and finishes smooth. I didn't even notice the ABV until this beer warmed (I nursed this one) and picked me up a little. I could sip on this again some slow night."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: This beer has a nice level of complexity for such a light bodied beer. If you enjoy smoky, nutty, grainy aromas and flavors you will be quite the fan of this beer. I have to admit, as I slowly sipped the pint it did start to grow on me. However, the slight alcohol kick still tweaks me a bit. It's definitely worth trying if you're a fan of Scotch Ales, but I honestly think Three Floyd's makes better beers."
"The appearance of the beer is a very dark copper colour with a nicely coloured white head, about an inch in height. With a lingering nice fluffy head, the beer looks like a quite nice Scottish Ale. Smelling this beer is quite different than I expected, I get quite a bit of chocolate flavours and a slight bit of roastiness, but not much melanoidins. No hops at all, which is good. The flavour is incredibly malty and sweet. There is a huge amount of sweetness coming form the malts, but there is a chocolate flavour that comes out near the end. There isn't a complexity to this beer as I would expect, but a great solid sweet flavour with a very small hint of chocolate. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel that aids the sweetness in the beer. There is also a nice sweetness. If I was in the mood for Scottish Ales, I could drink a lot of these."
"Drinkability: I'd say moderate for this. The ABV is a little on the higher side and the sweetness is too much for personal preference. However, with that being said, I'll openly admit that Scotch Ales aren't in my all-time favorite styles, but I feel this beer is a great and true representative of the style."
"D: A great drinking flavorful beer that I'd go back to. Maybe to big for a session beer, but definitely worth keeping around."
"Not a bad beer, just very average."
"M/D - Overall, I really like this one. I'm not a fan of most scotch ales, but this one is subtle and it makes it very appealing."
"D - Like I said before it seems light for the style but there's enough flavor there to make this an enjoyable beer that I could easily put more than a few away in a night."
"It has a smoked nut taste with a lot of carbonation in the back of the throat. Very very burnt flavor, perhaps too burnt for my taste. The aftertaste is quite sour."
"Not a repeat buy at $10 a sixer. Not unpleasant to drink, but wow, there's so much else that's so much better at this price. Finds a bad middle ground where it's too heavy to session, and not interesting enough to want to sip on for a while. I kind of kept wanting this to be a Scotch ale, and that my have been a source of my middling reaction here."
"Poured into a pint with a deep glowing coffee color with medium rough head that left only a little lacing throughout. I don't normally love scottish ale (it's the peat). But the nose of this is dominated by malt and a burnt sugar sweetness. The taste is likewise light on peat, heavy on the toated malt and sugar. A spicy toffee rules over very thin hops and a hint of smoke. A surprising aftertaste of scotch whisky followed me all evening. Medium body with significant carbonation tends to cover some lack of depth. While it's one of the best (to my taste) Scottish Ales I've had, I wouldn't see this as one to drink all night or after the snow melts."
"Pours dark copper with a thick and foamy off white/tan head. Flavorful and powerful aroma. Tastes a little nutty, seet and oak. The hops seem a little overpowered by the alchohal, which might be right on for the stlye. Still smooth and easy going down."
"Thanks again to Thirstybird for sharing some of his FFF booty. Served in my DT tulip. Poured a couple shades lighter than mahogany; almost opaque with some ruby red highlights around the edges. Head consisted of an off-white skim with a band around the edges - no lacing adhered during the tasting. Nose was malt with some dark fruit/vinous qualities and a suggestion of alcohol. Taste follows nose. Finish was dry with a suggestion of wood and some other subtleties that I couldn't quite place. Mouthfeel was between light- and medium-bodied; lightly effervescent. Brew smooths out considerably as it warms. Great drinkability for the style and abv was well-hidden - I really enjoyed the balance on this one."
"Good beer, but feel like this growler fill is lacking a little carbonation, not sure if that is the style or my particular growler...I do remember enjoying this slightly more a few months ago from the bottle."
"D: I like this beer quite a lot. I'm drinking it for the the first time, and already I'm sure it'll go into my buying rotation. Heavy for a session beer, though. Egészségedre!"
"Definitive of the Scotch ale style, to me. I've had and enjoyed a handful of others, and they tend to exhibit the characteristics of this one; all malt, sweet, with a very particular tartness that I've only found with this style. I suppose it's the peat or what have you that's supposed to be in scottish ales, but I can tell you that it's good. Not the most drinkable beer in the world, but a great sipper."
"P.S. the guy on the label looks like the bastard child of a Scottish king and a Russian nutcracker doll."
"I used to have this periodically before 3F stopped distributing to OH. I just picked up some more from Chicago over the holidays. The beer is dark red brown with a real thin head. The aroma is malty and roasty, kind of bock-y. Same with the taste, very sweet malty flavors, a long-lasting sweetness in the after-taste. Very little hops in the flavor. Scottish ales aren't really my thing, but this one is very good."
"d: a decent scotch ale but i feel it could be more flavorful"
"D: I think this would be a nice beer but for me, the bittersweet balance wasn't right, so one in a sitting was just right for me. I am no expert on Scottish Ales but I did like this one more than others I have tried in the past. Nice quality beer."
"This pours a reddish brown with caramel colored edges. The light brown cap is a shade darker than tan and about two fingers tall. Little to no lacing is left behind as the cap drops to a thin band around the edges. The nose is caramel malts with just a hint of citrus and leather,not a huge nose,but a pleasant one for sure. Caramel malts are the backbone supporting roasted nutty notes and and subtle whiskey flavors. Some citrus hoppiness peeks mid-way and provides a sweet and slightly bitter challenge to the sweet caramel malt that would otherwise have full control. A medium to full body with very active carbonation and sugary sticky lip coating quality. I enjoy lingering sweetness and this one fails to keep it going for more than a few seconds(my only complaint). Good drinkability for a Scotttish Ale,wish I had two more."
"M/D: Medium body, I thought that it was going to be thicker than it actually was, good carbonation level and very easy to drink, but probably would not want to drink to many at one setting. The alcohol was not really noticeable. This is a beer that I will pick up from time to time when I am in the mood for it."
"Overall, one of the most drinkable Scottish ales, and a tasty pick."
"Drinkability: A solid beer, and a good Scottish ale. Not my favorite of the 3Fs I've tried thus far in my journey, but a good beer nonetheless. The alcohol is not unreasonable nor easily detected, and the flavors are interesting and well-balanced enough to make this one pretty darn drinkable."
"D- Moderately high, fairly low ABV and not a strong beer. Not my favorite style so most likely not sessionable IMO."
"Taste is caramel, some heavy malt and some more dark fruit. This is very creamy and smooth on the mouthfeel. Would like to see a bit more carbonation, but the flavor is very nice. Good solid, regular offering from FFF."
"D- A nice take on the style. Nice and easy drinking for the ABV and for the style, which is usually a real sipper for me."
"Overall, a pretty good drinker though nothing to go crazy about."
"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and mild scotch ale with a nicely proportioned profile and a great malt complexity. cheers!"
"A: Deep ruby red, nice layer of head, crystal clear - 4.75, S: Strong aroma of ripe cherries with a hint of maraschino, a subtle herbal or earthy hop aroma 4.25, T: A good amount of caramel, again - some ripe fruit likely cherry, a little hop bite on the tail end of the beer, flavorful but not out of this world - 3.50, M: A touch on the side of runny syrup - 3.00, D: I have high expectations of Three Floyds and this one missed the mark in my opinion, a decent beer but not one that I'd seek out - 3.00"
"this brew pours up a nice dark brown color with a very thin tan head. the nose is a malt bomb! subtle chocolate, malt, malt, and more malt. WOAH! the taste is maltylicious! coffee, chocolate, caramel, subtle hop balance, medium to full body, low carbo. An awesome beer! Hands down!"
"D: Not too bad"
"At 7%, this beer drinks extremely well. The alcohol is very well hidden and is scary sessionable. Handle with care."
"HV"
"D - This beer seems to get ignored a lot when people talk about good beers from FFF. A great, asertive, balenced, and delicious beer here. Great fall beer, and among the best American examples I have ever tried."
"This is a very good beer. Though it does not hit the spot as far as Scottish Ales go. That being one of my favorite styles, I am a bit more harsh on my review. If it had more peat flavor this might be one of my favorites of the style."
"Similar to a Scottish Gruit style brew."
"D: It was a truely wonderful Scottish Ale. Very well balanced yet complex. It may be a bit much for a session beer but I think it could stand up well over a moderate session."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep reddish brown color with a thinnish white head that quickly dissipates to wisps on top with spotty lace on the way down. Smells mostly of caramelized sugars with hints of alcohol raisins and prunes. Sweet and malty with enough hops to keep it from cloying. Sweet dark and caramelized sugars mixed with some dark dried fruits with just enough hop and ethanol to keep it from cloying, Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet sticky bubbly mouthfeel. Wow this seems like a very different beer than the one I reviewed in 2008. I really enjoyed this beer this time, I guess the last time I tried this maybe I got one that was ""off""."
"I think this is my first Scottish Ale. One of my friends gave it to me a little while back, but he really didn't have too much to say about it. Overall, it seems like a very dark, strong beer. Other than the pine character, there doesn't seem to be too much else other than the mild bitterness. However, it compliments it well so I can't knock it too much. Take it for what it's worth - try it if you can but don't be too sorry if you can't."
"Maybe not Three Floyds' best ever, but a decent stab at the style. Needs something that I can't really identify to make it really ""wow"" the tastebuds. Maybe they could ramp up the creamy sweetness and the peat, just make it bigger, like most of their best beers. But then it wouldn't have the considerable nuances a Scottish Ale must have. And as always with FFF, an absolutely great label."
"D= This is a dangerously drinkable ale for the ABV. My only complaint is that it was a bit too thin, but otherwise all around a fine ale."
"Pours a deep amber/ copper color with a small off white head. In the aroma, roasty sweet and a small peetiness. In the taste, caramel, small hops, and a small peet like spice. A small bite with a medium to big mouthfeel, and a semi dry caramel like aftertaste. A great Scottish ale, nice caramel flavor."
"Overall I'm glad I had the chance to try this FFF offering. I won't seek it out again, but if you're in the mood to roll your R's and say wee a lot, give it a shot."
"Overall it's not the best beer Three Floyds makes but it's definitely very solid and tastes damn good. I've had it on tap and it seemed to be a bit smokier and better tasting overall."
"Pours deep copper with a small off-white head that dissipates quickly to a collar leaving only traces of lacing. Smell is grainy up front with a big caramel malt backbone and sweet toffee on top. Taste starts with the grain as well and gives way to the caramel and chocolate malts. There is an underlying molasses sweetness that lingers through the finish as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and sticky with fairly low carbonation. This is a very good Scottish ale and one I would seek out."
"This beer has a great deep brown coloring. Light has the slightest trouble trying to escape. The smell is very subtle, but there are slight nutty aromas. When this beer hits the tongue is when it all comes together. The texture is very heavy. Surprisingly creamy compared to how it looks. There are notes of vanilla and oak. Easy to drink more than one."
"D - a little too sweet to have more than one."
"D- Pleasant taste, great balance, light body...im sure i could have several of these in one sitting."
"Drinkability: Fairly tasty, but I am missing the peaty complexity I would expect from a good Scottish Ale"
"Aroma is a potpourri of caramel malt, toasted grains, fig, toffee. Wonderful. And those are the flavors that dominate, plus a hint of tart citrus on the back of the tongue. Basically, big malt flavor in each smooth, creamy mouthful. I love Scottish ales, and this is certainly a fine one."
"D: An amazing scotch ale. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who likes malts brews. Very subtle for 7%."
"This was a good beer that I would probably limit my consumption if drinking while out but worth a shot at polishing off the growler at home. Even with help we backed off in order to save some for the next day."
"D: Goes down fairly easier but i was hoping for more from a FFF beer."
"Overall not a bad scotch ale at all. Not my favorite for the style or from Three Floyds, but still a very solid effort overall. If this were available locally I would have no issue with trying to track down some more of it, it was very solid."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is relatively low and flavors are alright, so it's fairly easy to consume."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Tons of malt again, very similar to the nose; caramel and toast, slight alcohol, hints of dried fruit. Not much of a change in flavor from start to finish. Medium in body and carbonation, this stuff goes down pretty easy but isn't overly interesting. Still, a very good brew and one I'd gladly drink again."
"I liked this beer, it's one of the better scottish Ales I've had."
"D: Although 7% isn't really considered session material, this would still be great during a night of cards. Very smooth and easy to drink and doesn't sit heavy on the palate or 'over work' your taste buds."
"poured a deep reddish brown with an off-white head that settled down rather quickly. Smeel of caramel and fresh bread. taste backs up the smell almost identically. Very heavy on the caramel malt taste. clean mouthfeel with little to no aftertaste. Very easy to drink and very good beer to introduce to people who are hesitant to try craft beers."
"D: I didn't find this beer interesting enough to buy a six-pack. It is easy enough to drink, but too expensive to be worth it."
"Very interesting beer...still have two left so I'll be looking forward to them."
"The same goes for the taste. It's smooth, pleasant, nice and malty. But this is far from overwhelming. It's...nice. The mouthfeel is a good assist, with the creaminess adding a nice finish to Robert the Bruce. I'm more than willing to admit that Scottish Ale is not my favorite style. Representatives tend to be nice and malty, but not very complex. This needs a flavor boost. Diverse and bolder malt selection would do wonders for a nice, steady beer. On the whole, pretty good."
"Not everything I had been hoping for."
"Very drinkable, great brew. I'm going to buy more of these so that I can pound them down."
"Robert the Bruce is a pretty straight forward Scottish Ale without any ""normal"" crazy 3floydish standout qualities. It is decent, but does not rival most of this brewery's other offerings."
"There's a subtle hop smell and taste, but there's a good smokey taste to it that's not overpowering. There's a rich toffee and nutty - smooth and creamy but big body. There's a hint of smoke and chocolate on the finish. This goes down easy and the subtleness of the ABV makes this a sessionable beer."
"D- A very nice brew that I could put a few done of. Alcohol is hidden very well and this brew is very tastey."
"Copper to maroon color with some light lacing and a lasting beige head. Transluscent beer. Smells of signature Three Floyds hops moreso at first and fades into a light but pleasant mild peaty maltiness. Taste is smooth, mild maltiness with some tartness and a touch of peat. Pretty tame flavor overall, I thought. This one is still pretty drinkable but not to remarkable, I thought. Good for a style I'm not fond of, I guess."
"D: A good beer. Didnt do anything special for me but I surely enjoyed it."
"D: It seems like FFF's interpretations of a scottish ale, but not particularly to style."
"Drinkability is high, this is a very nutty-tasting brown ale with muted aromas and fair texture, easy drinking and masked alcohol presence at 7%, great ""session"" brown ale that lacks some of the boldness seen in other FFF beers"
"Drinkability is very high. I'm pleasantly surprised as usually I keep reaching for more of this at how easy it is going down. I very much am enjoying this beer."
"Medium body with a light tangy feel. Good drinkable beer,just not interesting enough for me,have had a lot of better beers of this style."
"I'm hoping I received a bad bottle (it was the last on the shelf), because other than its flatness, this was a very tasty brew."
"Not one of Three Floyd's best efforts but still pretty good, expected it to be more aggressive as far as taste goes, friend rants and raves about the barrel aged version he had on tap back east, recommended if you are a fan of scottish ales but not worth the price I paid for it"
"another treat from three floyds. comes off as an ""imperial esb"". definitely recommended!"
"D- Overall, I found this to be a big disappointment esp given the other beers that I've had from 3F. It was not too complex and rather watery, which makes it easy to drink a lot of but not really makes me desire to go and drink a ton of these. It does have a cool label though as all 3F do. I'd put it in the categories of beer that i would maybe buy for a party or to get drunk off of because it is so light but not one I'd really relish sip after sip. Maybe have to try it again to see if It was just the bottle I had this time or something."
"Robert the Bruce pours a murky, light-brown-amber sort of hue, without much flourish (not much foam). The head falls fairly quickly and leaves and a thick collar of foam with some minimal, but thick lacing. The ""Bruce"" has a big malt aroma with heavy caramel, toffee accented with raisins. Tastes of heavily caramelized malt (but not burnt) mixed with dried fruit. Hops have got to present, but they're certainly not making themselves known in this beer. This beer has a rather viscous mouthfeel and full body. If this to be called ""Scottish"" and not ""Scotch"" Ale, it is definitely a 90-shilling (or more). Much thicker than I remember, but that's alright. Overall, this is a bit of at hick malt bomb (I don't dare to think of the calories), but a relatively enjoyable one. I would drink this again but only winter or only wet, cold day."
"This ale is a bit of out balance. While 90 and 120 Schilling Scotish Ales should have a prounounced maltiness, they should not be cloying. The cloying sweetness detracts from both the taste and drinkability."
"D - Very drinkable. One of the litter scotch ales I've had the pleasure of drinking. Could put down a few of these bad boys."
"Poured dark brown. What little head accumulated faded almost immediately. Good smell. Aromas of dark chocolate. Slight sting. Taste of alcohol. Slight cranberry taste. Roasted nuts. Decent beer. Good alcohol content. Nothing special."
"D - Extremely drinkable and it's a damn shame I can't get that stuff on a regular basis here"
"I could drink a couple of these, but even after one i feel like hops are growing on the back of my palate and tongue.. would be hard to drink more than 1 or 2 at a time, tops."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. The low-ish ABV helps, as does the smoothness of the beer. Very good beer that does not overpower but has a nice taste, you could drink several of these in a sitting."
"D - A little too sweet for me."
"Drinkability: This is a beer your drink slowly and enjoy."
"I grabbed a six-pack and poured this dude into a tall pom glass due to a lack of pint glasses at my house. The bottle itself is a work of art and the beer isn't far behind. For being a higher ABV beer, it went down pretty smooth. One of my favorite TF beers. Mmmmm."
"T - A nicely balanced brew that has a dominate malt character. The malt is very toasty with hints of caramel and burnt chocolate as the alcohol warms. A mild hop character helps keep this beers balance in check."
"What I found was lack of complexity. Since the style inherently has muted hop flavor and aroma, one must work the complexities of the malt, yeast, and cellaring processes in order to compensate. That is exactly where this beer fell short. I felt like this beer was simply a well attenuated, crystal-malt darkened American pale ale labeled as a Scotch. Sure, it was drinkable, but as far as developing the nuances of a completely unique style, I was left hanging."
"drinkability - Very tastey, glad I got my hands on one of these since they are no longer found in new england."
"I could purchase these often. This drink is something I will definitely go back to time and time again."
"D-This is one hell of a beer. I would consider this a cross between a IPA and a Scottish Ale."
"Poured an attractive brown color with hints of red. Nice slightly off-white head that hung around for a while. Aroma is of caramel, chocolate, and roasted malts. Flavor is of the same and taste improves as it warms slightly. Lacing on glass was decent and mouthfeel was very nice. Drinkability was good for a beer of 7.2% abv. Good stuff."
"Overall: It's 3 Floyd's what can I say. I love all of their beers. They take common styles and put their own spin on them. Not a big fan of scottish ales, but when 3 Floyd's got done with it, this one is a winner."
"Beer poured out smooth with an excellent head. It had a wonderful deep, copper color, one of the darkest scotch-style ales I've had. Nice scent, not overwhelming, with a nice malty and roasted aroma. Good taste, nice roasted and malty taste, but not as strong as other scotch ales I've had. Great going down, though! This is probably the smoothest scotch ale I've ever had. I will absolutely be picking some more of this up next time I'm back in my home state."
"This was unlike any beer I have had previously, and I spent a lot of time with just the 12oz I had. Fun and interesting to taste, but I don't know how many more I could drink in a sitting."
"The taste is bountiful yet the mouthfeel remains light on the palate, leading to a smooth, easy drinking beer."
"Pours a deep garnet red hue with hazy clarity. A pale biege three finger head forms a dense and creamy cap that holds well and leaves spotty lacing. Extra malty nose like dark caramel and deeply toasted grains with a hint of roasted barley and chocolate malt. A mellow vinous aroma and suggestion of dark fruit ester form as the temperature rise, along with an herbal and earthy english hop note. The first sip is ripe with sweet caramel and crystal malt flavor and a robust dextrinous grainy tone. A flash of roasted barley and soft chocolate malt preceed the semi-drying aftertaste that puts the flavor in near perfect balance. Lush hop leaf flavors like minty tobacco leaf and earth/woody resins complete the hop to malt ratio and a subtle but ample bitterness rounds out the formidable malt sweetness. The body is medium with a light and gentle carbonation that allows the dextrins lto inger and adds to the rich and viscous mouthfeel. This makes for a satisfying beer, but also one that puches the boundaries of Scottich ale and leans more toward Scotch ale. Thus the drinkability suffers some, but the finish is still remakable clean considering the vast array and depth of malt character. The residual sweetness that does remain dries fairly quickly and the mint/wood hop flavor hangs on with it. A grape tannin and slight plum ester devlop more fully near the end, but does not detract too heavily from the drinkability. A good beer for people that like thier Scottich ale in the 80-90 shilling range."
"D - A nice flavorful Scottish Ale."
"The last of my two 3F sixers from Dark Lord Day 2007, I've thoroughly enjoyed this beer. A good scottish ale - rich caramel in color, buttery toffee on the nose, and nice dark brown sugar taste with a hint of roastedness. More than anything though, this beer (along with Dark Lord) represents a day - a very memorable day where I met a ton of cool folks and had a lot of awesome beer. Recommended."
"Good offering from a wonderful brewery."
"Poured a nice head that disappeared a minute latter leaving a small ring of lace around the glass. The color was an amber brown with a light carbonation. The smell of roasted barley and nice fruity yeasty bread. Taste of fruit bread, prune, raisins, toffe, and ripe fruit. A great beer for the style."
"Clear dark amber/brown and very short appearance from a fizzy beige head leaving behind scant lace. Sweet malt and caramel in the nose with some faint tropical fruit aromas wafting about. Excellent nutty malts, roasted grains, whole grain bread, brown sugar, cream soda, hints of coffee in the middle, and tart notes at the end. The finish is of burnt sugars, dry, and some tea herbals. Frothy mouthfeel, on a smooth consistency, tingly carbonation on the tongue is lasting. Nice complexities here and quite enjoyable."
"Poured into a mug a nice brown that shows some copper highlights when held to light. The beer is topped with a decent head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma is of brown malts and a hint of caramel, a little weak, though. The taste is a wonderful blend of malts; some caramel, dried fruits and a hint of smoke. The beer is medium bodied with low carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer for the style."
"Poured into a nonic glass. Pours a clear dark brown with a decent head that fell leaving a little lace. The aroma is of big malt with slight coffee tones. I taste a small stout and alot of malt with a slight hop note. A very smooth beer, that is rich and creamy. Medium bodied. It is a very drinkable beer that I like to session."
"Drinkability- Although kind of tasty, I was expecting something more like Old Chub but I got Old Chub Light. Its still a good beer and very drinkable its just lacking all the big flavor that I expected."
"D: Very drinkable beer. Stays consistent as you are drinking. Always maintains a nice flavor and is not too heavy yet still has a nice body to it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is good. Goes down pretty smooth. I probably wouldn't session it, but it's reasonably easy to drink. Overall, it's a good scottish ale."
"Flavour-wise, there's a bit of licorice, caramel, cocoa, plum, raisin, and definite alcohol. Enjoyable herbal character to it as well. It's not as complex as a lot of Scotch Ales I've had, but it's enjoyable and the flavours all stand on their own, not muddy or awkward. Mouthfeel is medium carbonated, and the body is much lighter than I was expecting. It's really quaffable, and at 7% you can have a couple at least."
"This is a real nice scottish ale from FFF and one I'll have again for sure."
"Recommended. A nice, tasty Scottish Ale. Not overly different or unique, but definitely tasty."
"D: A quite drinkable beer, a good effort from 3 Floyds, not something I would seek out though. Above average, in conclusion, I'm glad I tried it, as I am a fan of Scottish history."
"Another good choice from 3F."
"A fair Scottish ale, but I think it could be better. It pours a deep caramel color. Little aroma, not much head. Up front, there's a solid maltiness, and something that reminds me vaguely of peat, though I'm pretty sure nothing in here is peat-smoked. There's not much middle at all -- it kind o disappears on your tongue, until an aftertaste with a mild but pleasantly sour tang and a hint of alcohol comes in. A good beer for drinking with food, I think, but nothing to get excited about."
"update: have had this many times since...i wish they made less of this and more of some of their other stuff...how many times have i seen this and p+j as the last 3Fs stuff on the shelves...sometimes i think people only get this stuff (although i know a few who are fans of it) b/c they didn't have the chance to buy gumball or zombie."
"D - A nice treat, sorta sweet, pretty hoppy, and a good representation of the style."
"D- Great taste, and unique enough that I would enjoy this one again and again."
"Even a gentle pour yielded an enormous pillowy head the remained in place for ages atop the slightly hazy orange bronze body. The smell was quite powerful and made its way to my nose in less than 5 seconds after removing the cap. This brew is all malt, for certain. Sweet notes of toasted cereals and grains dominate without question with perhaps a modest touch of caramel. There is even some fairly easily identifiable candied fruit nuances in this one, as well. Taste begins with a sweet malty flavour that almost seems to border on being chocolatey, but not quite. The middle is very slightly bitter for only a fraction of a second, and then the sweet grains return for a smooth, pleasantly sweet finish. This is a good representation of the style, and a great beer! Too bad this isn't available in Ga. Regretably, I had only this one."
"Note: if you're expecting a true to the form scotch ale, this isn't your beer. At first it struck me as the lovechild between a brown ale and a scotch ale. Don't get me wrong it's very good, and I will gladly consume more in the future."
"A decent beer. It doesn't really stand out too much, but it's pretty drinkable and it's got some interesting flavors, just nothing that really stands out overall. I'm not sure i'd get it again now that I've tried it, but it was definitely worth a go."
"D - Good. I would pick this up again for sure. This is a good beer, but it's not really up to snuff for 3F as it really does't compare to some of their other brews."
"Another fine brew from the 3 Fs. I drink drink a bunchabout three of these before the flavor gets a little annoying, but in a bar next to a Heineken I could drink this one all night. A decently malted brew, my next trip to Indiana will certainly include a trip to Three Floyds with ol' Bobby in mind."
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Light colored head, moderate lacing. Dark red/amber. S: Sweet, some light coffee notes with dark fruit. Hops only slightly detectable. T: Firm malt/maple syrup backbone up front, followed close by plums, blackberries, lots of sweetness. The hops register on the finish but only slightly. Really great balance for such a sweet beer. M: Moderate carbonation, a tad thin. For a high ABV the alcohol is nearly imperceptible. D: All around very nice, though the label made it seem much more malty than it actually was. Very drinkable, Id definitely buy it again."
"overall this is a very nice brew, i really enjoyed it, could be very refreshing on a hot summers day i really enjoyed it, not sessionable though"
"Overall, its a very, very drinkable beer, one I'd definitely get again (particularly because its the best available Scotch Ale around, probably). But I was really hoping for this beer to be the top of the crop for my Scotchy addiction."
"This was a throw in bottle was courtesy of Cresant. Thanks again!"
"D: It is a heavier beer, not great on a hot day. That said great with a heavy meal or when its a bit cooler out."
"Pours light brown into pint glass. Very little/no head with aggressive pour. Very minimal lacing. Aroma is roasted malts with a little carmel. Taste is very nice toasted malts with cocoa, coffee, and dark fruit. Bit of floral hops at the end makes for a dry finish. Slightly too roasted for my taste but still very drinkable."
"D: One of the tastier examples of the style. Sweet malts are the star of this brew and they show well. Drinkability suffers because of the sweetness. Nice beer."
"Took the bottle out of the fridge about 90 minutes before pouring it into my glass. Color was a very slightly cloudy deep amber/brown. Very little head even with an aggressive pour. A little smell of carmel, but barely detectable. Nice smooth taste. Very little carbonation. Medium/full body. No flavors really jumped out at me. A little hop taste on the finish. Almost seemed a little buttery on the middle of the tongue."
"Being a resident of the three floyds hometown I feel obligated to try their beers and am rarely disappointed. Robert the Bruce is another example of fine brewing, with a nice hoppy flavor and good head. while far from my favorite this Robert the Bruce is a solid beer and ranks high as a scottish ale in my view, certainly better than the Mcewens I usually have."
"Pours a nice head that falls immediatly, but doesn't break. It has a very nice lacing and very dark brown color to it. The smell is hoppy with some caramel and a slight sourness. The taste is very caramal-like, there's some nice hops that go with it. Almost none of the sourness comes out like in the smell. The mouthfeel was nice, didn't have any bite or wateryness, it's a medium bodied beer. Overall this is the best Robert the Bruce I have ever had, I may just drink the last one in the fridge tonight."
"This is a tasty Scottish ale, very enjoyable."
"Beer poured a nice deep red color, very clear with a nice head that quickly dissipates. Love the aroma with hints of caramel and toasted malts. Very nice mouthfeel with a medium body. Slightly warming on the way down. Very sweet malt flavor with just the right balance of hops behind it. Caramel flavor really comes through on this beer with just a hint of smokiness lingering in the background. Overall this is a wonderful drinking beer. Very well balanced."
"A good friend of mine brought us a load of Three Floyd's, a six-pack of Robert the Bruce included. Drank a 12 oz bottle of this. From the 2006 batch, I'm guessing. Served in a pint glass. Pours a clear, dark ruby color with little to no head. Smells very strongly of toasted malt and caramel. Really love the caramel aromas. Some hints of nuttiness in there, too, which makes it smell closer to a Brown Ale than a Scottish. Taste has a nice, clean center of toasted malt. Almost no bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp and light-bodied. Overall a nice, easy beer - good example of a Scottish Ale."
"Lovely deep mahogany, and a lot of effervescence going on. Thin rim of retention. Awesome nose; fruity, woody, and just plain inviting. The taste doesn't stray from the enticing aromas. This has the right amount of malt, and yet doesn't feel flat and lifeless on the tongue. Very balanced, and highly drinkable. This beer is superb!"
"M&D - the malts give this beer a great smooth mouthfeel with a nice mouthcoat and easy down, especially for a higerish ABV, a splendid beer from an amazing brewery."
"Incredible huge head that has great retention. I poured into a pint glass. Smell was chocolatey. Taste was fairly good. Nice malty flavor, very chocolatey. Not a lot of complexity though. Nice mouthfeel, good, but not great. Easy to drink, a decent session beer. Definetly worth a try. I have one more and will drink it soon."
"Overall not a bad beer, but I would expect better from three floyds."
"Poured a dark red amber color with an off white head that quickly disappeared. Nothing particular jumped out at me in the smell and it is a medium bodied scottish ale. Very good flavor, although not very hoppy, and a few could go down quickly in one sitting. Wish there was a little more carbonation that would add to the mouthfeel which is otherwise a little flat."
"Note: As i finish my first bottle and open the second my belly warms considerabley from the alcohol, which by the way did not show itself in the nose, nor in the mouth."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark amber color with a small tan head that leaves some spots of lace. Smell has a light aroma of roasted malt. Taste is mostly roasted malt with a slight presence of floral hops in the finish. This brew seems to have more body than I would expect due to it not having bold flavors but is still easily drinkable and would make a good session beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber with a thin white head that doesnt last very long and doesnt leave much in the way of lacing either. Aroma is slightly smokey with some toffee and caramel in there as well. Taste is similar with a little fruitiness in there as well with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin in my opinion. Despite the 7%, this is pretty drinkable showing no signs of alcohol."
"Pours a nice brown color that's hard to see through. Not quite clear with a slight orange hue. Don't blink your eye or you'll miss the off white head. A sweet familiar malty aroma and a little smoke with a hint of alcohol. The flavor is a smooth sweet malt and a little chocolate, with a nice surprise at the end. Dryer than the first sense. Medium bodied and easy to drink. I didn't realize it was 7% - ""It's Not_ _ _ Normal"". Thanks to jhammerly for the opportunity to try it."
"Taste is sweet and caramellic with some syrupy notes. There is a weird kind of perfumy taste to it, reminds me of heather. Could that be in there? For me this beer is not what I have in mind with a Scottish ale, which are usually sweeter and more pronounced by the yeast flavors. Body was medium and aftertaste was sweet and short."
"Drinkability: Another flavorful quality brew from Three Floyds. Hmm, this one could make for a surprisingly good session beer."
"Surprisingly small for such a big beer. Almost has more of an English mild meets Scotch ale sort of taste. Very nice though overall and I beer I wouldnt mind having again."
"Poured out a dark opaque brown, close to cola. Corwned with a super fine off white head. The nose is malty with alcohol, figs, raisin, and some mild spicyness. The taste is HUGE, a whallop of malt rounded out by coffee, a bit of cocoa, and some dark dried fruit. Mouthfeel has mild carbonation, slightly creamy. Finishes a bit cloying and heavy, balanced towards the sweet/malt/alcohol side."
"Drinkable, yes, but it's flatness hurts the score."
"This beer is very drinkable. I'm surprised its not bolder, given the other offerings from this brewery. I found this beer to be pretty mild-mannered for a Three Floyd's product."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle that I got while visiting the folks in Indiana. Poured a nice brownish mahagony with a small head that quickly dissipated. The aroma was of roasted malts with good sweetness in there as well. The mouthfeel was good. The taste was perfect. It was smooth and had a great smokiness to it. Could see myself drinking plenty of these. (4.5, HR, T, Y)"
"Overall, pretty much dead on for style. Very drinkable. Two thumbs up and pour me another."
"Dark amber, with some light brown highlights, a thin head with tiny bubbles. Sweet malts, light hops and traces of alcohol on the nose--simple but nice. Up front, a twangy hop bitterness, to be expected from 3F. Caramel malts, a very slick and smooth texture and body; piney hops residue lingers for a while, there are some noticeable dark fruits and raisins that come into play. The finish maintains the mentioned hoppy-bitterness and slick body, just a trace of alcohol detected. A mighty fine Scottish ale."
"D- It is pretty good. Kind of subtle on taste and aroma. It is a easy drinking beer. Isn't anything big and offensive though."
"With a name like robert the Bruce, you can't help saying it with a silly Sco'ish accent. ""If it's not Scottish, it's crrrrap"""
"D: It was a pleasure to drink this offering from Three Floyds. Smooth and soft with big flavors. Another good one from these guys. Big thanks to Josh for this."
"Medium body, low carbonation. The balance on this one is excellent. Even with the big malt aroma & flavor, the hops come in nicely in the finish to keep it in check. Alcohol content is well hidden...I'm still not sure I believe it's 7%. Very clean, with excellent drinkability."
"Taste: Very mild and not nearly as sweet as I was expecting. The sweet malt was more evident in the aftertaste that anywhere else. The flavors upfront were more fruity, with cherry and a little raisin. The finish had a surprising amount of hops bitterness for the style, which dried out the beer and countered the late-emerging malts. There was a little warm alcohol on the finish, too."
"Overall, a good Scottish Ale and recommended."
"The beer pours brown with some maroon tints to it, with an off-white head. It smells mainly like piney hops, along with some peppery spicyness. However, it tastes a bit different than it smells. It tastes like caramel, sweet malt, floral hops and some pepper/clove spicyness. It starts off sweet, and then has a hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is light/ medium with some slight creaminess. The drinkability is good too, as it's smooth and has relatively low carbonation. This is a pretty decent beer, another good offering from Three Floyds."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades slowly to a shallow layer leaving some lace. Deep amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Faint caramel nose. Starts balanced with some caramel sweetness, smooth, finish some hops showing up but a nice Scottish Ale. The ABV is vague, their site lists it at 7.2ABW?? That's 9.1% ABV. $1.59 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, Ia."
"D: Pretty good beer with good flavor and nice balance. I really liked the spices and would recommend this beer. Despite some flaws, it's good enough to get again."
"Pours a dark brown in color, nice carbonation, fizzy tan head, some lacing around the edges. Scents of malts, slight hops, and some caramel. The taste is sweet malts, and a nice touch of caramel, nice clean finish. Medium body, well rounded brew. Drinkable, a nice little brew from 3Fs."
"I dig this one, excellent sipping beer. Alcohol is well regulated. I'm really glad I've got an extra bottle, will try this again down the road from now."
"Every now and then I buy a six-pack of this and after about four bottles over the course of a few weeks I get kind of bored with it. I dont know why. IMO, this beer is the weak link in the 3F portfolio. At best I find this a situational beer. Robert The Bruce is available in six-packs in Council Bluffs, IA. Worth a try."
"Slainte!"
"That said, this beer does pour up a deep amber hue, clear and very nice to look at....very little immediate head but a nice cap sticks with the brew. The smell is piney, effervescent and almost all rich hop, with some citrus shining through as well but in the back you can still pick up the trademark toasted malt that comes with the scotch. The taste mirrors the aroma...hoppy up front but that quickly gives way to the toasty coffee flavor which is abruptly followed by a cascade of herbal hop noise again...pretty complex and not bad to drink. The mouthfeel is very good, smooth and creamy, possibly a bit under carbonated. Overall this is a quaffer through and through....go try some."
"D - Easy to drink, doesnt tire out your mouth at all. Not bad."
"I've heard a lot of good things about this beer, and I was slightly disappointed. It was good, but not great. The combination of flavors started out well but ended up being conflicting and distracting. I'm not an expert in this style, but overall this did not match my palette. I would definitely give this another try, though. (And damn, that's some fine artwork)"
"wish i could taste more booze in it. thats just me"
"My first Scottish ale. Seems like an exact cross between an old ale and a porter (at least in this beer). Very nice flavors, an excellent malt presence, and heavenly carbonation structure. Recommended for sure!"
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It has a defined malty edge that stays in control the entire time while there is enough hops, roast, and alcohol to keep the beer balanced and very drinkable. The caramel is pleasant, and gets more so as the beer warms up some. The thing I like the most is that there isn't one particular flavor other than the caramel that is truly defined. This beer is very well crafted and I would certainly drink it again."
"Poured a dark brownish red color with a tannish head leaving no lacing. Caramel, toffee, and roasted barley, plenty of hops present as well. Sweet caramel and toffee paired with roastiness, a lingering cocoa finish. High carbonation, medium to full bodied. Pretty decent beer to have once in a while, worthy of a try."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but be careful that alcohol can creep up on you."
"Drinkability: Yes, I would/will drink again. This is a good example of the style."
"This beer is every bit as good as it was the first time I tried it. Absolutely wonderful."
"Dark ruby red/auburn color with a decent-sized, rocky tan head. Slightly roasty, sweet malt smell. Rich, toffee-malt sweet taste with a slightly bitter, earthy hop finish and aftertaste. Medium body, smooth, with light carbonation. Nice, malty ale that goes pretty well with food and goes down easy for 7.0% ABV."
"It poured a rich brown with little to no head (meaning it foamed a bit at its initial pour, but rested comfotably at a lace.) It smelt of a typical Scottish ale with emphasis on molasses. On the tongue, it was full-bodied with little grittiness. No discernable fruit flavors or herbs that I could place. Quite the lager of Scottish ales. Very average, but a well-done average Scottish ale."
"Pours a dark brown almost black, like black licorice. Held in front of the light there are red high lights. Medium head that slowly dissipates the contrast between the body and the head is lovely. The sent is not as strong as most three floyds I've smelled, but this is still very pleasant. Mild alcohol, anise, carmel, little to no fruit notes, the bitter hops is much tamer then most three floyds, but still there. The taste is great, I haven't had too many scottish ales, but I really enjoy this one. The mild sweetness of the finish coupled with the bitterness is excellent. This is definitely a beer I could drink."
"This ale poured slightly hazy, dark chestnut color with tan foam that settled flat. The smell was sweet and malty with notes of caramel and a touch of hops. The taste was sweet and very malty with caramel malt prominent and a hint of cocoa. There was mild to moderate hoppiness. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and low carbonation feel. Caramel and malt flavors lingered in the aftertaste. This was a nice Scottish ale."
"This beer is a about the color of cloudy sweet tea. There was a very small head. The smell is caramel like. The taste is somewhat bitter. It is like a blend of a red and a brown. There is an aftertaste that stays a while. The Beer is fairly smooth and there is a slight hop bitterness but this beer is more about the malt. The drinkability is fine. I may try this one again, but no big deal if I don't. Only slightly above average to me."
"All in all, another great beer by Three Floyds!"
"I could stand it even stronger tasting - I've been on a kick for that lately, but that said, this oddly named brew (three different men's names) satisfied my insatiable beer appetite."
"Body is amber and bordering on brown. Head is a half finger of white foam. Damn what a malty nose! Lots of caramel and grapefruit. As for taste, it's a world of caramel, syrupy cherry, a slice of wheatbread, and lots of hoppiness. It tastes marvelous but to be honest, I would have rated this higher had the hops not been so dominant. It seems I get far more hops than I should for the style. I love hops, but I wish this were a beefy version of the style instead of a hops infused one. Carbonation is active but not in your face. Mouth feels very big. I know I complained about the assertive hops, but this does taste really good. I wouldn't reach for this first when looking for a Scottish Ale but I would reach for this when looking for something malty and tasty."
"Drinkability: Strong but also funky. Snuh"
"I was initially planning to buy a sixer but opted to get a few other singles instead. I will definitely pick this up in the future."
"Drinkability: I surly didn't have a problem drinking this one down. I could probably drink this one again if no other 3 Floyds was available. I think if Robert the Bruce was alive he might have been proud that his name was on this 3 Floyds beer."
"Pours a hazy red/brown, small off white head forms, settles to a ring quick, nice lace though. Smell is sweet and malty, toffee, chocolate, and then citrus/pine hop finish, I love 3F! Taste is very malty, toffee and chocolate again, grainy and rich, pine hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth, clean bitterness."
"Drinkability, very easy, I usually have problems having more than one beer in a sitting. This could have a little more body though."
"D - Over all a fantastic beer. This is a good example of how to capture a malty flavor without it beening undrinkably sweet."
"Drinkability: This beer seems typical of a lot of Three Floyd's offerings, very hoppy, especially considering the style. Not as malty and creamy as I like my Scottish Ales."
"Drinkability is slightly above average for this beer. I probably wouldn't consume more than 2 or 3 in a sitting before switching to something a bit lighter."
"Extremely smooth with upfront malt sweetness and a touch of smoke. Midsip a wave of alcohol takes over, but is quickly replaced by a caramel sweetness & viscousy mouthfeel that envelops the tongue.	Spot on for style, though alcohol is a tad high. Definitely worth seeking out, though at this price, not an everyday brew."
"Drinkability: This is quite drinkable and a welcome change of pace from a brewery known for its love of hops."
"I was hoping for a little more body. As it is, it is a light medium body. Alcohol becomes warming but by no means does it detract from the overall feel and flavor of the beer. A little watery. Slick stickiness to the tongue and teeth."
"A good Scottish Ale that I would recommend to anyone."
"Thin/Medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. 7% isn't knock you on your ass crazy, but it never shows through and this could be a very good session beer."
"Drinkability: Good - a FFF take on lower shilling scottish ales, which compares favorably to other ""90 shilling"" ales like Odells or Sam Adams. While this has a hops flourish not found in other examples, it achieves nice balance and a super finish."
"Pours dark chocolate brown with a cream colored head that fades quick. Stongest aroma is a sweet evergreen, piney hoppiness, behind that there is some malty sweet aromas of ripe strawberries, raspberries, honey, and a little fig. Taste follows the smell pretty closely with piney hops followed by sweet berries, and finishing peppery, a little smoky/ roasted character as well. I was hoping for a little more from the malts and less from the hops, but a decent beer overall."
"This is not my favorite Scottish ale, by any means, but it's a good interpretation of the style, and one I'd recommend to anyone."
"Pours a deep mahogany color, with some ruby edges. Thick off-white head hold rather well, and when it does disappear, it leaves some nice patches of lace. Aroma is of candied fruit, caramel, and a hint of ripe fruit. Flavors are strong cararmel, toffee, slightly toasty malt, a hint of smoke, and candy fruit. The fruity flavors are subtle, but do not seem to be citrusy. Low carbonation, and a medium body. Overall, a good brew, maybe not what you expect from a stronger scottish ale, but still soild and drinkable."
"Did not like the way it finished. Another beer I wouldnt turn down, but wouldnt go out of my way to purchase."
"Very nice session beer, the 7% is invisible, you could have told me this was a 5% beer."
"Big thanks to hero27 for the bottle!"
"This was a delightful departure from many of the West Coast hops-up-you-ass beers that I often drink (and love of course) that illustrated the other side of beer - malt."
"Drinkability- Very nice session beer. I'm a confirmed hophead but I just love this one. Three Floyds simply doesn't brew a bad beer and this one is great."
"Smooth drinking."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty creamy and smooth with a lager like feel. pretty easy to pund down if it wasn't 7% abv. A malty sweet palate mostly with very little hop bitterness. Its almost like the malts play double duty wth the sweet and not-so-sweet."
"D - very, very tasty brew if you like malty beers, as I do. Not all that similar to other scotch/scottish ales, but very tasty. Despite the fullness in the body and sweetness, highly drinkable and not all that filling."
"Once again, thank you MABZ for helping my get such a great beer."
"Medium mouthfeel. My tongue felt a bit scorched. It's a reasonably good Scottish, but not my fave."
"taste reflects the aroma well. dominated by a caramel, honey sweetness with a nice smoky character. prickly carbonation and a medium-heavy mouthfeel. finish has the barest touch of alcohol. complex and enjoyable, and gone before you know it."
"d - pretty drinkable, I could have a couple of these no problem"
"Tastes smooth- chocolatey, malty, smokey. Mmmm...alcoholey. Very drinkable. Nutty and balanced...it only gets better when it gets warmer. Leaves my stomach with a warm, happy feeling."
"Overall, it is a drinkable, and enjoyable, beer. It's a somewhat different interpretation, but seems to work."
"Deep chocolate amber brew with a rich malt aroma. Settles on our tongue like a cool fog on a small town. Yummy beer that makes you want more, but doesnt make you think have incredibly subtle flavors, but doesnt hit you in the face with hops or malts. Nice hearty beer that you can have more than one."
"Pours copper hue with significant carbonation but only a thin buttermilk head. Not much going on aromawise, although if the minimalist head retention was specific to my bottle or pour that may have had something to do with it. A fizzy, fairly viscous sweet brown sugar greets the tongue with a faint bit of hop bitterness at the finish. Tastes an awful lot like a brown ale to me, maybe a little bit sweeter. Sweetness/bitterness pretty well balanced though nothing spectacular. Overall, a fairly vanilla offering from the venerable FFF brewery. Its a shame that this is one of the easier to find beers from that label, and so far its been the only one to really let me down."
"This poured reddish brown with a light tan head. Good sweet malt nose and a bit nutty. The taste was sweet malty, I was expecting a bit more peaty/earthy. There was a good roasted malt component as it warmed up. I couldn't pick out any hops. It has a medium body and is very drinkable with a dry finish."
"Clear chestnut with a short, light tan head. Decent retention and some lacing composed of fine bubbles. Hops hit you as the bottle's opened, but the intensity diminishes quickly after the pour. Malty nose, with lots of caramel, a bit of chocolate, roast, and toffee. Delicate hints of fruit, hops, and vanilla as well. Mild sweetness with a fairly strong bitterness and hop flavour. Some caramel and maybe a bit of citrus in the finish. Mild warming in the finish. Medium body and carbonation. The bubbles were a little rough initially, but settled into a creamier texture after some time. Overall, an interesting beer with a few rough edges. I was a little let down with the simple flavour after experiencing a thoroughly enjoyable aroma."
"The beer pours a clear dark amber with an off-white head. The aroma is of malt with heavy tones of dark fruit, then a bit of floral hops in the background. The taste has the good malty flavor you'd expect from a scottish ale, but it's also backed up with a healthy dose of dark fruits, and has a nice floral hop finish. The feel is medium, smooth, and oily. This beer was a wonderful find. I was looking for a good scotish ale and this was the only offering. I was not disappointed and will be purchasing more when available."
"D: Eh. I was really expecting a lot here. A scottish ale from Three Floyds....it should have been great. Instead they pulled on the reigns instead of letting the beer run wild. Nice taste but not very complex."
"This is a great brew. I really enjoy the woody, earthy character. Recommended."
"D: Certainly a nice break from a hop bomb. I think its the first of its style that I've had, and I would like to have it around. I am starting to really like Three Floyds..."
"I could drink a load of these beers. It's not too high in alcyhol, and has a great hop component that keeps you thirsty. Not a bad little scoth ale at all."
"Nice scotch ale here. I am not crazy about the style, but I am crazy about 3 floyd's and they have a great brew here. Very malty with nice caramel, chocolate notes. Not many hops as true to the style. Little head retention and pretty nice micro-smell. Highly drinkable and a nice session brew."
"D: extremely high. I would drink gallons of this stuff if it were available in Mass. Full of flavor but not too viscous."
"Also beer is very refreshing after a hard day at the office."
"Pours a deep clear chestnut with an off-white head. Aroma of sweet malts and dark bread. Taste is toffee and treacle and whole grains. This is a rich malty drinkable brew, Some notes of smoke and molasses round out tihs rare treat."
"The mouthfeel is also good but not great, becoming a tad too thin when the carbonation wears out. This is very drinkable."
"""Cerevisia Supra Omnia"""
"D - This is a great session beer."
"Bottom line: I can't remember the last time I had a beer of this style made in the US but..this one's a goody. Give it a try."
"Moderate body is not too heavy to lend itself away from being easy to drink. Spectacular stuff, give it a shot!"
"Thought the simplicity of the flavor make up is compensated with malty richness, breadiness, and caramelization, it still lacks the refinement of the true Scottish Ales of Tranquair or Belhaven."
"Alpha King is still my favorite Three Floyds brew but this one ain't bad. + The warmer the hoppier it gets."
"Very enjoyable - perhaps the least hoppy beer I've had from this brewery. Fairly balanced though and another satisying beer from Three Floyds."
"drinkability: very drinkable"
"Vigorous pour resuting in 1/2 inch head that rapidly subsided, and almost no lacing. Nice deep redddish brown color. Aroma was malty, not overpowering and not too sweet, and ironically did not have the slight acridness of roasted malt even though bottle says it is roasted malt. Very faint hop aroma, almost not there. Upon tasting there was no hop bitterness (which is as per the style), but rather a very mild, very pleasant malt taste that was not overly sweet, and then finished with faint taste of roasted malt without acridness that sometimes is result of roasting. Very smooth and full mouthfeel. I rather enjoyed this (even though I am a hophead), and had another and will have after that -that is, this very drinkable, and something I would get when taking a break from hops. Another great offering from TF."
" you by surprise if not careful. Remeber, it's not normal!"
"Pours a clear but dark brown color with a reasonable off-white head. Smell is pretty malty with the blend of hops that I have come to associate with Three Floyds. The malt flavor is fairly complex, with roasted and smokey flavors, sweet caramel and toffee, and finishes with a slight tang of herbal hops. The mouthfeel is more or less medium with slightly low carbonation. Overall, fairly well balanced and easy to drink."
"Drinkability seems pretty good. I would love to sample this on tap."
"Quite a tasty beer here but it isn't quite perfect. Pleasant Scottish Ale but I would have liked a bit more intense of a flavor. I could see buying this if it was $10 or so a six pack."
"A slightly hopped up version of the style. And I say that ""hopped up"" lightly. The hops are more than just a whimsy of the senses in this beer. But this beer is first and foremost about the malts--sweet, earthy, raosted, caramelized and peaty. Nice balanced with the hops. However, I have a hunch that if the hops were milder/lesser the malts would seem kind of thin. The hops support the malts and really bring them out. Medium body with a slight bit of heat from the alcohol that comes across as a spiciness. Tough to put this one down."
"Easy drinking ale here...another goodie."
"Dark mahogany brown with a very fine tall tan head. Aroma is surprising for the style- big shots of dried flowers from the hops are front and center, underneath that is a hint of roast malt, caramel and dried berries. It comes across more fresh and airy than earthy. It is still nice once you get used to it. Palate is full with, again, quite a bit of hoppy bitterness for the style. Caramel is dominant but the roast malt and flowers linger on the finish. For a big beer this is quite quaffable."
"Very nice."
"I have a had alot of scotch/ scottish ale this winter and this one really knocks em out of the park. Its like a big soul-warming bear hug."
"Poured a dark amber-hued caramel color, slightly hazy, thin off white one finger head fell slowly to light sticky lacing. Smell is sweet and malty with hints of caramel, toffee, and a slight smell of alcohol. Taste is primarily sweet malt with little hops present in the background, hints of coffee/ bittersweet chocolate, also slightly smoky. Excellent level of complexity mixed with suprising drinkability. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, silky smooth, somewhat creamy, with carbonation on the lower end of the spectrum. Drinkability phenomenal, very good beer, easily drinkable. Would seek out again."
"-UF"
"Smuggled a bottle back from Madison in my luggage, picked it up sort of as an afterthought. I need a six pack of this. Scratch that, I need a constant supply."
"Cheers!"
"Jen: I am not a fan of Scottish ales, but this one doesn't seem to hit as much of a ""sour"" note with me. It is quite malty, which makes this somewhat sweet, and is backed by the mild flavors of chocolate. It has a ""barely there"" hoppy ending. This is smooth, but nothing spectacular."
"D - After a quarter of the beer my saliva became viscous and it started to gather in the back of my throat. It is not a sessionable beer. The flavor is great, but drinkable it is not."
"As a big fan of Scottish ales, I was eager to try this offering from Three Floyds. The dark brown color is very inviting for drinkers of darker ales. The smell is pleasantly malty and sweet. The robust flavor smacks of a combo of roasted malts and chocolate. As with any good Scottish ale, this one succeeds at being both full and smooth. This very drinkable beer packs a punch but is also balanced and smooth. Highly recommended; especially on-tap."
"Verdict- Not quite as chewy as other Scottish ales, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"D: A bit filling, but not as much as I expected. If you couple that with the smoothness and it’s more drinkable than I thought it would be, but after a few bottles you may feel a little full. This beer might be something that is better to drink along with a meal. I’m not much of a cuisine-pairing-guy so I have no idea what type of food would go best with it. I haven’t had any beers of this style before, so I’m not sure how much this beer represents the style. Honestly speaking, I did like the beer and if I had more, it most certainly would not go to waste. However, there are other beers that I would choose over this one."
"d - Haven't tried Scottish Ales before but I really like this one. I would drink it again."
"This is one of the best Scottish Ales I've ever had, worth trying even for a weissbier / golden ale lover like me. I'd reccomend it."
"D- Nice drinkability. not too overpowering..something nice to relax with"
"The flavor is malty, a bit roasty and chocolatey. Has a nice toasted malt flavor too. It is medium-full in body and is drying in the finish. Its a nice drinker."
"Nice dark carmel color in the glass. Slight head that quickly dissipates. Limited lacing. Sweet raisin and carmel aromas. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Slight bitter up front taste gining way to a raisin carmel type taste and finishing with a sour resin taste. Not a bad beer. I would have it again."
" I'm not real familiar with scottish ales, but I will tell you that some friends and I drank a keg of Robert the Bruce at a 4th of July party and were out trying to track down another one. I'd guess that's drinkability."
"Deep mahogany in color. There was a very small head when poured that was creamy tan in color and disappeared quickly, but left a halo that provided good lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, malty caramel, perfumy hops and cinnamon bread. Sweet on the taste buds. Caramel flavors with raisins and finishes a little bitter with the taste of hops. There was just a hint of the alcohol as swallowed. Hard to believe the alcohol content was 9%. This was one of the smoothest scotch ales I've ever had. Creamy, smooth and easy to drink. Yum."
"Drinkability: Three Floyds has once again made a dangerously drinkable brew. Again I am not sure if they hit the style right but dam is it good."
"I was expecting something a bit heavier on the palate for this beer. After all it is fairly dark. Despite its color it feels fairly light on the palate and goes down like water. Has a good level of carbonation that compliments the malty character of this beer. Not hard to drink at all. This beer is easy to drink and I can see myself buying more of this in the future."
"In brief... When I was young this was my favorite Scotch ale. Then I discovered the great Dane and it became my second favorite. Then Lake Louie came along and all the Scotch Ales on earth were suddenly less than adequate. Today this one hovers high on the drinkablility list but low in all other categories. I must say that this is one beer that is certainly more desirable on tap than it is in the bottle. The mouthfeel alone is a good point better out of the keg. One other particular note that I must also mention is that it has a nice sage brush aroma that is rare in a scotch ale. Otherwise this is a strong brown ale. I don't find much strength or peat in it. The alcohol is too well covered. It reminds me not of Scotland or any other scotch ales. If there were a scotch ale light, this would be it. It is quite a nice beer but not a very good scotch ale. That being said, I still enjoy it and will continue to drink it from time to time."
"Overall - Great example of style. Any ""malt-bomb"" lovers will enjoy this beer through and through. Grat job 3 Floyd's."
"This just isn't that good. Note that this is rated within the style, but it's too flawed and boring to interest me in drinking more of it."
"Probably won't purchase again, but overall a pretty good brew."
"Taste: roasted caramel malts, there's just a hint of chocolate and coffee, and a bit of a hop presence in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Overall this is a pretty nice, easy to drink beer. Glad I picked up a 6er of this."
"A nice american version of a scottish ale. Easy and drink and pleasant through and through. I'm glad I picked up a 6'er of this one."
" Overall taste was just what I expected from Three Floyds they always give me something different from what I was expecting."
"After dinner I tried this Three Floyd's brew for the first time and it capped off the meatloaf very well. For a Scottish ale with such a noticeable roast and rich malt, it isn't too filling that you don't want another one."
"Happy to have met this one...."
"Drinkability:"
"Beautiful amber pour with hints of warm oranges and autumn reds when held to a light. A steady stream of delicate bubbles flows up towards a thick, creamy, retentive head. Some malts smells, but a strong floral hoppy scent. The beer is somewhat light, with a definate roasted malt flavor which gives way to a hoppy bitter finish. Alcohol is hidden well. A very easy drink. Decent Scottish Ale."
"Bottle: Poured a brown color ale with a medium dark-white head with low retention. Aroma of hops is clearly detectable with some caramel malt. Taste is lighter then expected with some caramel malt and a bitter finish. Watery feel at the end is very unpleasant. Body is definitely too thin for my liking and alcohol is very well hidden. Definitely not the best from 3FL and not even close to the best of the style."
"D - Goes down smooth but I think this one would get old if you tried to drink more than two. The ABV also must be watched out for."
"Pours a reddish-brown into the pint glass..moderate off-white head. Aroma is surpringly hoppy..I figured this to be a much more dominantly malty brew. Taste is very bittersweet, and the alcohol is very well hidden. I would guess more around 6-7%, not 9. Great blend of malt & hops, and it's definitely a quality scotch ale that doesn't skimp on flavor. Nothing mindblowing, but definitely another solid offering from FFF."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Medium bodied with good, smooth carbonation that drinks amazingly easy for a beer at 9%. This makes a delicious dessert beer that could accompany chocolate cake or tiramisu, as I am getting some chocolate flavors now too. What a surprise... I had no idea this would be so good."
"D - While this has a pretty high ABV, and slightly bitter, I could see this being a close to regular beer. It is a solid beer to drink midway through you session and doesn't totally kill the pallete or leave you fall over drunk."
"Drinkablilty: Just like my last scotch ale review, this one would be great in a six ounce snifter and drinkable like wine after good food."
"overall: disappointing as this brew has a lot of potential. lots of flavors in there, they just don't seem to meld well together. carbonation is almost nonexistent as well. so close to being excellent in many points but just missing on all of them. so overall just average."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with alarge fluffy white head. The aroma is malty with some alcohol peaking through. The taste is malty, but not very strong. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, a lot little than other wee heavies I've had. Overall, this is an average brew at best. There are a lot better wee heavies to be had."
"Worth checking out if you're a fan of the style and want a brew of the style that you can really drink."
"The beer looked reddish amber with a one finger thick head, and decent lacing. The smell was earthy, spicy, floral, nutty, and slightly smoky. The taste was malty sweet and chewy, and continued on into nutty, spicy, and chalky flavors that lingered on, and faded into peat smoke. Reminded me quite a bit of a Dopplebock, but was a little more sour. The mouthfeel was thick and sticky, and aftertaste soothingly sweet. A complex beer that you dont have to sip."
"Light caramel malt flavors dominate. A bit of nuttiness as well. Some sweet tea notes in the finish. Tasty. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin feeling. Coats the mouth well but dissapears quickly. Drinkability is good due to the good overall flavor and aroma but its hard to drink too many brews with this octane level."
"Super easy to drink, a perfect example of this style."
"Pours a crystal clear dark amber with a one-finger off-white head. Aroma is your typical wee-heavy, caramel malts and alcohol with condiderably more hoppy spicy/floralness. Taste follows the same pattern, sweet caramel malts, a hint of chocolate, some citrusy fruit, and a nice floral hop/alcohol kick at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation as well. A very drinkable wee-heavy here, dangerously so for 9%. A solid offering from 3 Floyds here, and also my first."
"Drinkability? As far as flavor, this is a very drinkable brew, but a little thick to be drinking more than a couple at a time. But one should do you well anyhow."
"12 oz bottle. Big time chocolate and roast with hops in the background to keep you going. Garnet, brown and red, tones. Thin tan head. Chocolate and roast with supporting bitterness. Flavor seems to fade as beer warms. Too much carbonation. Maybe too thin. I like this beer a lot, but best characteristics faded as the beer warmed."
"Robert is a muscular chocolatey brown, with a small head. His appearance does not belie his overall qualities; he is a fine, manly brew, yet possesses a delicate sweetness. Hops and chocolate dominate his delectable odor and taste, and Robert is a man of excellent balance. He feels thick and chewy in my mouth. Robert compares well to another fine gentleman who has been kind enough to bless me with his company, Dirty Bastard. I love you, Bobby."
"Their web page states 7.2%"
"Neat picture on the label.Poured a deep amber color with off-white head that fell to a thin ring. Smell is sweet and of caramel with toatsed malt and vanilla present. Taste is is sweet, caramel and nice malty texture. Leaves a nice sweet taste in the mouth that is very enjoyeable. Very good drinkablilty for a 9% beer."
"Overall a very satisfying experience. Or in my two-year-old daughter's words: ""I wike dis one!"""
"This beer means a lot to me. I have never been one to drink beer ever. Not even in college. Never liked the flavor. A waiter suggested this, and it changed how I look at beer. I still don't like major brand beers, and I still would rather not drink those. But, beers like this are very flavorful and enjoyable. It is this very beer, Robert the Bruce, which made it so I can appreciate beer. It has been my all time favorite, my cornerstone beer. I would recommend to anybody who is looking for a non-miller to give this a try. Caution: it has flavor. It will accost the taste buds of those who like lite beers. For me, that is what beer should be for."
"The mouthfeel is also worthy of an upgrade--from 3.5 to 4. The drinkability is average, although when paired with the proper food, I could see it getting much better."
"A solid 4 beer. Everything about it was right on for a strong scottish ale. A deep Red that gave it a beautiful ruby stained glass color. It had a nose of toffee candy mixed with fresh cracked malt. It wonderfully hid the alcohol and was a delightful drink of carmalized wort sugar meet with a light touch hop spice. Slgihtly thin body that lent it to a very easy drinkable beer."
"As smooth as the body is, I would rate this beer as easily drinkable. I will buy this again."
"Drinkability- Not my favorite style of brew, but this one hits home as one of the better ones I have had of style."
"Drinkability: This beer is not organized enough for my personal preferences. It just does not have any solid characters that would lead me to persue another glass. An exercise in anonimity in my opinion."
"Decent flavors and good balance although a little rich."
"Notes: A strong brew in the alcoholic sense but a tad thin in the malt department with the loss of body and sweetness, oddly this adds to its drinkability. More of a Double Brown Ale IMO rather than a Scotch Ale."
"""Freeedooommmm!!!"""
"Could be more complex in finish, but overall wonderful."
"I've been hanging onto this one for a little bit now, and I think its about time I imbibed. Pours a thick mahogany with a surprising amount of yeast flowing into my glass as well. Not what I expected from this style. Hardly any carbonation or head. Rich chocolatey malt aroma, which follows into the flavor. Smooth textured, mostly from the lack of carbonation. Makes for a good focus on the sweet malty characteristics of this one. I thought this would be a bit hoppier, and could probably use a tad more bitterness for balance, but honestly, I liked it the way it is...quite delicious. One I'd have again for sure."
"Beautiful dark mahogony colour with a thick off-white head. Lightly spicy on the nose, with hints of brown sugar and molasses. Nutty and milk-chocolatey flavors mix with a strong malt presence and a slight orange rind bite on the finish. Full-bodied but never heavy or cloying, a fabulous drink."
"I have read the reviews. No answer there. The only solution to the problem of which is best (bottle or tap) is further research! LOL"
"D- This is a great example of a wee heavy and has the good rich malt complexity. It has a nice malt flavor with hops playing in the background. The smoky flavor is very faint and is more of malt that taste smoky than any peat smoke. Very well put together beer."
"Pours a muddy dark brown color with thin head that dissipates to a fine film quickly. Light level of carbonation. Very sweet smelling (molasses and chocolate) with some slight hops floral citrus overtones. Sweet taste up front. Enough bitterness to pucker your cheeks a little if you hold a sample in your mouth but generally very smooth. Slightly oily mouthfeel and a medium/heavy body. High ABV is well hidden. Could drink too many of these pretty easily."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable...not too intimidating given the ABV. Good for cooler weather, as its a bit heavy."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It has a creamy, toastey aroma. The taste is good. It has a very smooth, malty flavor that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It has a dry and slightly warm finish. It hides the elevated abv. well. This is a highly drinkable, high alcohol beer. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good Scottish ale. It's not the best I've had, but it drinks well."
"12 oz bottle pours dark amber almost brown with a huge foamy clingy off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my pint glass, has a sweet fruity, bready and citrusy hoppy aromas. Nice sweet fruity cherry, caramel and vanilla flavors, nice bitter-sweet finish, medium to full body with a smooth creamy mouthfeel, hoppy for the style, but what is not from this brewery."
"AWARDS: Gold Medal, 1997 Real Ale Fest"
"Pours a dark amber copper color, with a small frothy and creamy tan head. Toffee and caramel nose, followed up with a citric hop profile. Very different and unusal for a scotch ale, but hey, isnt that what FFF is all about. Spicy and woody flavor upfront. There is a definite alcohol presence, but its not offputting at all. Hop bitterness is definitely noticable, unlike most other examples of the style. The citrus flavor may seem out of place at first, but once used to it, it seems right at home. Mouthfeel is medium full, could be a little thicker, but not bad. Highly drinkable for the 9% ABV."
"Pours a deep dark garnet, like a juicy pomegranate. No head. Nose is too mild...expecting a heavier maltiness, but hey, I'll play along. Taste is oily smooth up front, again a too mild maltiness, and then...hops...not pale ale hoppy, but a touch of hop bite. Interesting, like a hybrid style: Wee Hoppy. Mouthfeel is medium up front and then it waters down in the finish. Surprisingly drinkable, just don't buy this expecting a typical Scotch Ale."
"This is my second Three Floyds behind the Alpha King I had on tap a few months ago and I like what I see so far."
"Clear cerise color with a thin beige head and very small yeast particulate floating about. The aroma was pure malt with no detectable notes of hops or peat. The peats were either submerged or absent to the taste. Instead, I tasted a slight touch of vanilla that was oddly appealing. It was also a bit sugary with low CO2 and stray lace. Not bottle conditioned."
"Anyone who enjoys barreled spirits will like this, especially scotch. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer with some wonderful flavors in it. The 9% is hidden very well."
"A clean dark brown beer with amber highlights. Has a big foamy beige head with some lace. A nicely sweet aroma of chocolate and caramel with a hint of spicey hop in the background. The flavor goes from a milk chocolate character to some light caramel to a bittersweet chocolate at the end with a quick dry finish."
"Overall: Malty and thick, but not fantastic. Kind of expensive for what it is, although I didn't mind drinking it."
"This one is definitely an easy drinker, though it is a sipper for sure. I'd be happy to sample it again."
"I was expecting something more than what came across to me. It's like requesting a luxury rental car, and getting stuck with a vanilla midsize sedan. Not the worst fate, but not what you were hoping for, either. The bulk of the experience was tasty, but once the main part of the flavor fades away the heavy bitterness takes away from what came before. It's basically drinkable, if you can plow past that lingering distraction. You don't have to be brave of heart to drink this, but keep your expectations in line or you could well be disappointed."
"Dark brown with a light colored head. There is a caramel aroma, but it's not as strong as in most Scotch ales. Hops aroma as well, which seem out of place in this style of beer. The flavor starts out with sweet caramel malt, but quickly becomes very bitter with hops. The flavors seem to clash together in a way that doesn't work well. Not much roasted flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, just pretty average."
"Medium to full bodied."
"Backwash: Thats two disappointments from 3 Floyds in a row. Im coming to the conclusion that 3 Floyds doesnt really do great versions of classic UK styles (or chooses an iconoclastic approach which I dont quite appreciate yet). Like the Alpha Klaus Porter, this seemed watery, and overly bitter, without providing the hoppy joys of Dreadnaught or Alpha King. I didnt find much balance or the expected maltiness in this beer that Id hoped for. Unlike Dark Lord, which really re-defines its category, Robert the Bruce just seems like a bit of a failure. It doesnt seem to know if it wants to be a New World, hoppy, Scotch Ale (at which it fails for me); or something entirely new (which it doesnt seem to achieve either). Still, 3 Floyds still makes some stupendous beers, and I look forward to the next one I try."
"Truly a nice beer. The assertive hops don't seem to fit in with the classic examples I've had from across the pond, but I find the hops an added layer of excitement. Maybe not as complex as Traquair House, but a more enjoyable brew for me. Thanks to cja711(Joe), for the tasty beer!"
"I only picked up a single since I am hurting for cash and wanted to try something new, but didn't want to be disappointed with a whole 6 of brews. I most certainly could have drank more, but it certainly couldn't stand in place of the 60 minute IPA (which I have developed quite a strong affinity for since my store started to carry it) I picked up along with this single."
"Drinkability/notes: An oustanding example of the style, highly recommended."
"Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light and crisp on the tip of the tongue with a decent hoppiness. A little bit weak in the middle for a Scotch Ale. The lightness continues through through the finish and leaves a soft malt aftertaste as well as a pleasant (albeit understated) hoppiness. Mouthfeel is very nice - rolling and round - slightly frothy without being foamy. The lack of thick middle is uncharacteristic for this style, but makes it wasy to drink."
"Overall Impression: A unique high quality flavor with a great finish. While rich tasting, the moderate body would make me think about a possible winter session. Another really good beer from Three Floyds. A hearty Scottish thanks go out to that wee lad mattcrill for sending another tasty brew my way."
"I'm not familiar with scottish ales, my preference leaning toward IPA's. That said, I found a lot to like about this beer. Nice even head, and a fruity aroma with smoke characteristic of scotch (I should have guessed as much). Mouthfeel was good, and the flavor complex, tasting like it smelled...roasted grain, smoke, and malt, although less than I would have expected. Very smooth going down, with a nice light dry smoke finish. I guessed 6% abv, not the reported 9%, so this one could definitey sneak up on you. Very nice. I'll have to explore this variety of beer further."
"Slàinte!"
"Pours a dark brown, with a tan head that usually goes away fairly quickly. Lots of malts, sweet malts, some chocolate in there too, but not much. Basically malts, with a nice hop aftertaste that doesn't rip your tongue off like everything else FFF brews. Highly recommended, this is the staple beer at most of my friend's and I's parties in the winter."
"Drinkability and Overall: Wow this was a dissapointing beer. Hopefully this was just a bad bottle or something, but this was rough. Not the quality I'd except from FFF. I have one more I'm going to throw in the cellar for a bit to see if it evens things out at all. Hopefully it does, cause this brew needs it."
"Drinkable."
"Bottle, but had on tap at Isaac Newtons recently as well. The Tap version seemed hoppier. Anyway, deep brick red, with a thin tan head, and clear. Very malty aroma that includes carmel malts and fruitiness. Reminds me somewhat of Stone 8th, but I digress. Flavor is big and malty, with darker malts coming through, and a pleasant hop bitterness coming out from underneath. Smooth and drinkable. A little hop bitterness and flavor lingers in the finish. I think I like the bottle better."
"I haven't had a lot of Scotch Ales so I don't have a lot to compare this to. I was expecting more of a malt presence that really didn't show. This beer was done really well but it didn't blow me away or anything. Still, it's worth trying once. 3F's never disappoints."
"Pours a deep copper color with an light tan head that subsides to an even ½ layer of foam. Excellent retention, lacing moderate. Earthy and malty nose with moderate hoppy notes (especially for a scotch ale). Strong malty, chocolatey notes with an herbal, hoppy astringency that lasts well into the finish and aftertaste. I'm not really sure I've ever had a scotch ale this hoppy. A good winter warmer. Very tasty and extremely enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is nice and not too heavy or viscous. The carbonation suits this wonderfully. Drinkable? I suppose so, but again, I don't typically toss back more than one Scotch ale and I might not look for another of these. Very nice though. The 9% is very well hidden amongst the maltiness. If only 3F's products were cheaper. At least the distribution is starting to come around here on the east coast."
" Drinkability is good strange to smeel and taste a noticable hop presence in a scotch ale but that make this one good in my opinon. Thanks to merlin48 for providing this sample."
"A favorable beer that can be handled fairly easily, but after a couple it may start to effect the noggin as the 9% is hidden very well."
"A deep brownish red with a fizzy white head. A little lacing can be seen on the glass. A slight grassiness to the smell - there are plenty of hops here. The taste starts off a little bitter, some good hops in there. It quickly changes to a smooth maltiness with the slightest hint of chocolate, and finishes smoothly with some alcohol aftertaste. There is a roasted malt flavor that shines through. Although the alcohol is noticeable, it is a pretty good blend of malt and hops - a good ale."
"Mildly crisp at the start and finish. Malt and caramel flavors last on the tongue. Superb drinkability even with the higher alcohol levels."
"Oddly, I recently had this beer on tap at the brewery and found it quite lacking. In the bottle, its much better."
"Beer poured a reddish brown, amber color. Decent head that disappated after a few minutes. A similar beer to Skullsplitter, but with noticably more hops. Not a very heavy aftertaste, which was welcome. Not bitter at all. I was suprised that a micro brew here in america could create such a refreshing, tasty scottish ale. I recommend this beer to anyone."
"A surprising combination of malts, hops, barley in a scotch aroma. Chicory and roasted malt. Doesn't all quite work out that great, but different as you would expect from this brewery. Layers of taste that evolve as you work through the bottle. Mild taste, medium to even thin mouthfeel. Barley doesn't work all that great in it, like a homebrew. Bitter aftertaste. Needs food to offset. Thanks Wohlfs."
"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a deep amber to almost brown color with a meaningful sized frothy head that slowly evaporates leaving a fine coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet with malt, hints of hops and a bit of fusel alcohol, fresh and appealing, the start nicely malted and somewhat sweet, top is middling in feel to the palate. Finish is delightfully carbonated and the hops delectable in their spiciness, dry linger aftertaste, a fine drinking beer, just wish Three Floyds were more readily available here in Arizona."
"This beer pours a reddish brown color with a light brown head. Smell is slightly smoky and has notes of alcohol and some bitter hops. Flavor has a different malty taste. I get some english toffee in here but its not straight up, its more like the result of the malts and hops mixing together. Also, the alcohol really seems apparent to me but oddly this was quite drinkable. There was a lack of complete malt substance and the alcohol seemed to take its place. Body is a bit weak but somewhat creamy as well. A bit of an odd beer but one that I don't mind, still not the best scotch ale."
"Beer is good. Happy Wee Heavy Beering."
"Starts with light whiskey and peat malt flavors. At mid-palate, a wisp of smoke and butter cookies come in. Lightly bitter tang carries on into the malty finish. Nice, medium-big bodied, creamy feel."
"The aroma is sweet smelling and a tad hoppy. There are also hints of coffee and maltiness. The taste is, at first, kind of nutty, followed by a week coffee. The aftertaste is very malty and dry, but smooth. With the 9% alcohol, I expected more in the taste, but it was noticable, yet not overwhelming."
"This brew--which I was thankful to find at my local bar here in Wyndmoor, PA--struck me as very much modeled after the McEwan's Scotch Ale--although I might grant it the edge in terms of drinkability and mouthfeel."
"12oz. bottle poured into a flute glass. It pours a deep brown color with two fingers of head. There is almost no lacing on the glass. The smell is full of roasted malt, bits of toffee sweetness and some alcohol. The taste is also heavy on the malt. It has some caramel sweetness and a bit of molasses. A little bit of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is very nice, thick yet smooth. The drinkability is good for a 9% brew. A sweet beer from Three Floyds!"
"P.S. I found this in a little gas station/beer store that I always stop in here in Statesboro. Don't ask me how they got this, I haven't even seen this in Atlanta, and I'm sure 3F doesn't normally distribute here."
"Not much I can say except that this is a great beer, it's very easy to drink and you'd never know by the taste that ABV is so high. A definite winner. Next time around I'll have to pick up more than one bottle."
"A very drinkable Beer, hard to beleive it is 9% ABV. Drinks easier than a lot of 5percenters in the same style. This beer will quickly find a spot in my fridge on a semi regular basis."
"This beer pours a nice deep ruby brown color. There is no head to speak of. The nose is nice roasted malts, a little bit of caramel, a litle bit of lightly roasted coffee. The flavor on this one is fairly roasty, nice deep caramel, just beautiful. The aftertaste is really nice caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the flavor makes up for it. Drinkability is phenominal. Thanks to clvand0 for bringing this one by."
"3F's Robert The Bruce is quite quaffable and it's hard to believe the ABV is as high as listed here. The alcohol is very well disguised. Smooth, well balanced and sporting a robust and varied taste, Robert the Bruce is a tasty brew worth trying out."
"i'm not a scottish ale fan at all. but this one is a good example. a dark ruby transparent with an off white head. smell is malts which i use to love but can't stand too of much these days. it does have good hop flavor, as good as a scottish ale gets. it hides it's abv well. i just noticed that it's 9% and have decided i should only have one and switch. if you like scottish ales, i'm sure you'd love this one."
"Mouthfeel is nice...possibly a little too light...but it goes down smooth and is easy to drink. This is 9% abv and I can hardly even tell. Drinkability is good as well...I could definetly down a good 2-3 of these babies. When I want a nice chage of pace and nice malty brew I will turn to my new friend Robert the Bruce."
"A good beer! Admittedly I have little experience with the style, but I liked this one enough. If I could ask for anything it would probably be a little more hearty of a mouthfeel."
"Pours a dark carmel color with a sizeable head at first that works down to a think one quickly. Aroma of lightly roasted malts mostly, slight raisin tint to it as well. Taste of slightly smokey malt, blending into huge malt... ending with a pretty big hop burst for the style. I like this beer, alcohol is hidden fairly well for what it is, and it's a easy drinker. Perhaps my favorite from 3F."
"This poured out a light brown with a strong reddish hue when the light hit it. It had a decent sized beige head form that dropped quickly leaving sticky sheets of lace to decorate the glass. Very strong chocolate malty smell rises from the glass that is backed by a slightly sweet fruit presence. The warmer the brew gets the more the chocolate seems to stand front and center. There are also notes of a slight earthy hoppiness that seem to emerge now and then. The sweet malt hits the palette first with ripe dark fruitiness that seems covered in a slightly bitter dark chocolate. There is a bittersweet aftertaste that is pleasant and lasts for a while. Alcohol adds a little bite that comes out when it warms. Mouthfeel is about medium with good carbonation and a smooth feel over the tongue. Drinkability is good, this goes down easy and I could definitely handle a few more. All in all a pretty good interpretation of the style from Three Floyds, that I would recommend you try if you havent."
"I love deep, complex, nutty flavored brews and the Bruce doesn't disappoint. I think the taste is well balanced considering the alcohol content and a couple of these will ease your pain quickly, especially after work on Friday. An outstanding beer at a reasonable price (7.99 a sixer in Chicagoland). I also love Three Floyd's label artwork in general and Robert the Bruce in particular."
"This has been a staple of mine for at least a year and I just now realized that I've never properly reviewed this beer. It pours a nice amber color with a quickly disappearing tan head. Aroma is wonderful. Notes of chocolate and a little bit of roasted malt. Very pleasant just to sit and sniff. Taste belies the aroma as a nice malty backbone is present but notes of chocolate are notably absent. There is also a nice hop bite to this brew which hides any evidence at all of alcohol. Body seems a little bit thinner than what I was expecting. This beer seems to be straddleing the line between a heavy desert bit and a malty session beer. For me, it's a perfect complement to my U2 ""Elevation"" dvd in the background and I definately will be seeing more of this brew in my future."
"Pours a light brown and orange color with a tan head that sticks around, but leaves no lacing. Nice aroma: strong in the malt area and some smoky essence and chocolate roastedness. Extremely smooth flavor - chocolate is the dominant characteristic, but there is also some smokiness and a slight hint of alcohol. This is a very well-made beer."
"Poured a medium brown with red highlights. Not much head or lace. Smell of roasted malt with some vanilla, and coffee. Taste is a sweet roasted malt with coffee, vanilla and alcohol coming through. A ""light""porter if there is such a thing, that is except for the alcohol content. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy for me, but is good for the style - its more of a nice cool autumn night kind of a beer. Since it is a bit heavy it does not have great drinkability. Its more a a hang out and savor type. Give it a try if you get a chance."
"Sampled from a 12 oz bottle. Appearance is very dark with a reddish brown tint. This bad boy smells of caramel & dark roasted malts. I'm tasting a little caramel and a touch of toffee flavor making it a bit sweet. There are also some subtle, but distinguishable hop flavors coming through, making this brew a bit more unique. Medium to full bodied & quite flavorful. On the sweet side, but relatively easy drinking. Overall, an enjoyable take on the style."
"Nice"
"Final Thought: This is quite a remarkable final product, my first brew from Three Floyds and definately not the last, I thank the providers of the 'Midwest Taster' for this addition!"
"I am a big fan of this beer. It has a level of chocolate and coffee flavor usually reserved for much heavier stouts, and manages to generate those flavors without becoming too bitter. Much more subtle than other similar scotch ales (i.e. Dirty Bastard). This beer has a complex taste with chocolate, scotch, malt, and hops all playing off each other. The color is a dark reddish brown. High carbonation and smooth going down, this beer hits all the marks. It could have more of a nose though."
"Thanks to deejaydan for the sample!"
"Dark brown in the glass, kind of translucent. Good, chewy maltiness. Heavy burnt malt, but quite a good selection of malts make it a great balance. Not much notice of hops, but they are there in the background. I could probably drink this all day. I'd love to try this on tap."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the reddish brown brew, and laced okay. Slight aroma of sweet dark malts with a slightly apparent smoke component, which is as a Scottish Ale should be, as noted in my on-tap review. Nice to see the on-tap and bottled presentation be similar. Taste followed the nose's lead, with the smokieness a bit more prominent. Alcohol not noted in the taste, but the lip-smacking stickness illustrates that it's in there... Mouthfeel and drinkability great for the style."
"So I bought another 6er recently and its no where enar what it was. possible bad batch. It was more barley winesque then anything and was plain harsh in the mouth. I dropped my scores based on that. It was harsher but still was a good beer just not as enjoyable as my first tasting."
"I will try anything by Three Floyds, and I could drink several of these, but given the choice of an IPA, Stout or Porter, I would probably choose those; especially Three Floyds Alpha King."
"Overall: Definitely a quality brew, and exceedingly drinkable considering its alcoholic content. I feel like I could drink this one all night if I were so inclined. I will definitely make a habit of keeping this one stocked in the beer fridge."
"Plenty of hops, plenty of malt, plenty of flavor. I love this beer. Perfect for an evening by the fire."
"Well it sure smells hoppy, don't know why... Hop flavor and bitterness is strongly evident also. The malt flavor is barely there with a slight carmel flavor. Mediocre beer but a crap scotch ale. It ssems to be lacking all the good qualities of the style and throwing in a few bad traits from others too. I wish they had called it something else so I could have avoided wasting my time. What the heck am I going to do with the other 5?"
"I really like this a lot....just short of being outstanding...I would buy this again if I ever see it...recommended if you like this style...alcohol is not noticable....wish it was just a bit beefier...."
"overall a good sipping beer and I will probably order again."
"Believe it or not, Robert The Bruce is only the second Scottish Ale that I've ever had. I'm not sure if my lack of enthusiasm (it's good, but not great) is because I don't care for the style or because it isn't a great representation of that style. Only one way to find out... drink more beer. What a great idea."
"as for taste, very hoppy. At room temperature I could only enjoy the hoppiness for about half the beer, but slightly chilled the hoppiness was very nice till the last drop and the feeling the high-gravity leaves on your tounge compliments the fruity aftertaste. An exotic beer.. almost spicy... A manly adventure well advised"
"Drinkability: Excellent for a Scotch Ale, due to subdued alcohol prsence. Quite smooth drinking. This beer could easily get you in to trouble though quickly."
"resembles some of the barley wine that ive tasted (again probably because the 9% abv), but with much more malt and roasted flavor. while this isnt my favorite beer to date, its nontheless a good one."
"The color is a beautiful dark mahogany that is clear and has a thin tan head. The aroma is malty with a little bit of everything (caramel, nuttiness, smokiness, and slight chocolate) except that there is no discernable hops. The body is malty, yet it seems a bit thin for the style. It is slightly smokey and nutty with a sweet fruity finish. The carbonation is a bit too much and there is also a tinge of alcohol throughout, but overall an enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability - good Scottish ale, I'd buy it again. A style that I'm beginning to enjoy more."
"Overall a good beer that I will probably buy again."
"Extra smooth and silky in the mouth, with light carbonation. So smooth and tasty, it goes down with no effort. A delightful brew."
"Nice looking mahogany tone to this brew. Thin, creamy beige head. Lacing is adequate. Nose is smokey and chocolatey. Some roasted grain in the background as well. Pretty nice. There's a nice charred malt presence on the palate, with some peaty and bittersweet tones as well. Taste is very nice. Nice chocolate characteristic. Just damn smooth and enjoyable."
"Beer had extremely low carbonation, which I thought suited the style very well. The mouthfeel was a combination of smooth and oily that was fine. Easy enough beer to drink, but Im not sure you would consider this one a session beer."
"This brew is a deep mahogany color with a thin dark beige head. Fair lacing. Heavy malt in the nose, along with sweet caramel and a touch of chocolate. Rich bodied, just how I like my Scottish Ales, with flavors of malt, caramel/butterscotch and chocolate. The finish is lightly bitter with hops and a touch of coffee. Pretty good!"
"A Scotch ale on crack, which is what 3 Floyds is all about. A very solid beer, and I'd love to have some of this again."
"This is a very drinkable beer, the flavor is certainly there, but not in your face."
"Pours a deep amber/brown with a pretty thin head that is gone pretty quickley,a subtle aroma of alcohol,caramel and a little earthiness.Taste is mildy sweet and pretty earthy for a Scottish ale with a raisin like finish and aftertaste.A pretty thin compared to many Scottish ales I think but still pretty good and highly drinkable for the style."
"The half-brother of the Alpha King. The caramel malts cause an exceptional smoothness to this ale. It just plain feels good to drink. The nose is all malt and caramel. The same flavor is what hits first. In the midst, there is good hopping for a scotch ale. I'd expect nothing less from the Floyds. Finally, the beer gives way to the malts again, which just hang at the back of the throat. This beer could cure many an affliction. One of my absolute favorite scotch ales."
"Pours out to a dark brown to almost black in the glass with a light head. The aroma reminds me of liquor, specifically bourbon/scotch/whiskey. The taste is good, with a fruit-like presence coming to the forefront, mainly plum and raisin-like. The finish is decent, but there is a bit of alcohol present on the swallow that isn't fully masked."
"Pours with a thin light brown head. The beer itself is a deep amber-red color, and is pretty clear. Aromas of dark fruit, malt, and a hint of alcohol waft from my glass. The taste is sweet, malty and fruity as well. Some of the fruit seems to be hop derived, though the hops are fairly subtle here. There is a hint of roast malt in the finish, which adds a nice stylistic touch. This is quite a malty brew, with notes of caramelized malt, cherries, and raisins. This is most definitely a good straight forward example of a Scottish ale"
"Glassy deep garnet hue. Lean, but steadfast light beige head leaves sparse lace. Deep, dark lovibond, toffeeish caramel malt with a burnt roasted barley tinge upfront in aroma. Mellow floral hops and butterscotch surface after a deliberation. Trace minty ethanol upon swirling. Stately and welcoming aromawise. In flavor, the prevalent malt impression is of slightly burnt, well buttered toffee. Savory, salted biscuit undertone offers contrast. Hop bitterness is comparatively high for style, but serves to offset malt sweetness and facilitate dryness conducive to dangerous drinkability. Ashen pine wood hop flavor. Thinnish in body, with a lanky, dilute mouthfeel that falls a notch short of adequate malt support. Fruitiness of a singed raisin nature develops as the beer breathes. Finishes with lingering hints of molasses drizzled almond, yet oddly remains dry, with mild ethanol warmth. A Scotch ale with a definite American flare. A bit over attenuated and shy in malt depth, but certainly fits the bill as a fine AMerican strong ale. Quite tasty, and superbly drinkable, indeed. Thanks to Kennywoodbrew for the delivery."
"I once had this at their brewery and enjoyed it then. As far as I can tell this is the same beer I remember. A quality Scotch Ale and, as the the style goes, one of my favorites. Thanks to qarre for the beer!"
"Dark brown color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty, nutty and sweet, with a touch of peat. A medium bodied scotch ale. Malts are nutty and sweet with a touch of peatiness. Its very hoppy for a scotch ale, yet its not at all bitter. Extremely smooth with a nice sweet finish. Hides the 7.2% alcohol very well. An eminently drinkable ale. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Overall, a good scotch ale. Big thanks to TwelveVoltMan for the bottle!"
"Update  I originally received this back in 2003 in my first ever BIF and was lucky enough to get a bottle of 2006 vintage from BeerGuy. The only thing that struck me differently is that it looks so much better. It looked good before, but now the head was just perfect, just off-white, retentive, and depositing some of the coolest lacing I have ever seen. Im raising the Appearance to a perfect 5.0 and calling it a day. Cheers to Frank!"
"Very, very drinkable. Why can't 3F's be a Maine beer company? It's not too late to relocate."
"Deep mahogany color with a light fluffy head. Smells of sweet grapes and a light smokey aroma. Sweeter malts are also clear. This is a smooth beer with a medium body. There are flavors of chocolate and a cake like feel. Nice blend of hops and a generous amount for this style. All the flavors work very well together. The aftertaste is a crisp dry taste with a great finish. I didn't know this was a 9% brew until I checked out the website...very well hidden. All together a solid beer."
"The Bruce produces a medium size head that dissipates pretty quickly. It is a deep deep amber color, maroon even. The smell was interesting, a bit hard to describe to my uninitiated nose. I could detect a vaguely coffee scent, and it was somewhat fruity. Taking a sip yields a very, very smooth mouthfeel, the beer felt deceptivly thin for such a dark beer. The taste was mellow, slightly malty, but lacking in any real punch-there were no overpowering tastes, and by the time it is on it's way down your throat you are a bit pressed to describe exactly what it tastes like. It is so smooth that you could drink quite a few-and then be flat on your back, because this bad boy packs a punch. Definatly will have to have a few more of these, just to make sure I gave the beer it's proper due."
"Deep copper in color with bubbles that cling to the sides of the glass. Good sized off-white frothy head that dissipates slowly to a good lace. Big malty aroma that has notes of caramel and sweet bread. Only a hint of hops in noticeable on the nose. Rich, sweet, malty brew with a nice medium mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Some hop spiciness picks up towards the end along with some roasted notes. The finish has notes smoke that last through the aftertaste. Just a touch warming at the end. I really enjoyed this Scotch Ale. Very drinkable and well balanced. Ill look for this one again."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a hazy dark amber, with a decent head and some fine lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted malt, with a slight hint of hops. Taste is again more of the same. I really enjoyed this beer, but it is my first scottish style ale, so it is hard to rate it against style but I know what I like and this I like."
"Pours a glowing brown with marron highlights. Delicious white had is formed with a little help. Aroma is sweet malt, subtle peat and eath and some spiciness. Taste is full caramel and toffe malt that the color would indicate with a little spicy zing on the back end that is a little scotch and a little bit spice. Feels very smmoth in the mouth and really hides the relatively high alcohol. Kind of scary in fact because these go down easy, too easy."
"Set 'em up, Joe."
"Nice amber color with a light tan head that kept its presence for a little bit. A good amount of bottom carbonation. Nice nutty and breadlike aroma. This has a nice flavor compared to many scottish ales. I taste a tiny bit of caramel with the first sip. The alcohol is not overpowering, but you are aware that it is there. It has a dry finish and an overall nice mouthfeel. This beer, but would not choose to drink more than one in a sitting."
"Pours a clear deep brownish copper with a light tan head. Aroma consists of chocolate malt, roasted coffee, caramel, in addition to hops buried underneath it all. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and coarsely carbontated. Almost to the point that it detracts from the drinkability. Not smooth all. Some hop bitterness and bitter chocolate on the tongue. Finishes with flavors of roasted malt and a dry lingering hop bitterness. Not as complex as I expected and hoppier that I had hoped. This is the 2nd offering I've had from 3F's and so far I haven't been that impressed, unfortunately."
"Also, this beer's reminscence to coca-cola is not appreciated."
"Drinkability: Noy my style, but if you are a malt lover, try this one when you can."
"I got to have this straight from the brewery tap. Of all the regular 3 Floyds beers, this is the one that's not insanely hopped. Rather, you have a nice roasty malt flavor, just a trace of smokiness. A big, big malt taste, but one that doesn't leave any aftertaste. In other words, smooth as pudding."
"Thanks to San Diegos finest BA, xlperro, for this one."
"Deep mahogany in color, little head or lace present. Aroma is sweet, caramel and mild hop tones (citrus, pine) are noted. The taste is smooth malt tones with that mild sweetness coming into play but that is about it. Nothing really going on with this beer. It seems to be lacking more flavors. It just starts to get interesting then comes to a quick stop. Yea, you could drink this all night but with the missing flavor, why do it. Overall it is ok."
"Overall, a very nice experience. Wish I had brought several more of these home."
"But all in all, a very drinkable strong beer."
"12oz. Bottle fresh from the brewery. Dark amber with a small head that dies down quickly. Nutty malty sweet aroma and smelling really fresh. Smooth body with a big malt feel. Hops are there, but ever so gently so not to overpower the terrific malt blend. Flavor leans towards a roasted malt yet I taste a subtle hint of cocoa in there. Not anything like most other Scottish ales which I find too malty and sweet. This one is really quite nice in my opinion. Really fresh tasting."
"A much better example of the style since I last tried it. Three Floyds seems to have toned down the hops to within something you'd recognize as a scotch ale. Very nice."
"ng"
"This beer is a dark red/brown color, with a tan head that crumbles down to nothing quickly. The nose is a nice caramel scent. As for the taste it is mainly a malty caramel character, with a slight chocolate taste mixed in. This is my first scottish style ale, so i am not the best one to compare it to the rest of the field, but i think this is a pretty nice drink."
"This is probably the worst Scotch Ale that I have ever had, yet it's not too bad either. It's pretty much like a lighter McEwan's Scotch Ale. The color was pretty much average, but with a little bit more red color to it. The head was light and died out quickly, which is a bad thing in my book. I guess the cool thing about it, was that the alcohol was almost nondetectible, so you had a chance to taste everything else. All in all though, it's not too bad."
"In general Three Floyd's has gotten the edge back. They are brewing their own beer now and the beers are back to previous standards. This is a fine example of the Scottish ale."
"This ale is wonderful for its mild flavor, which masks a strong alcohol content, and allows one to relax over the beer, knowing that the alcohol will come in due time. Overall a beautiful, smooth beer which packs a notable punch, but which I appreciate when available in bars and always at home."
"This beer is exceptionally well colored in the body. The look is of a dark amber that has red hues making something between copper and mahogany - almost precisely the color of a buckeye nut when fully mature. This clear body is topped by a thin tan head that leaves nice lace down the glass, although this lace is quite light. The nose is of rich caramel malt and also a bit light. Plenty of flavor as the strong malt base impresses itself immediately and lends a sense of alcohol warmth as well. A decent feel from the moderate body, but too rich for great drinkability."
"This beer pours a very impressive apperance. Other than that it is seriously lacking. It has a bite that is quite raw and it is void of any interesting flavor. The mouthfeel is remincent of brackish dishwater and I would take a bud lite over this any day."
"Hotstuff and I went on a tour of their brewery. For $5 you get a 12oz glass of 3 of their beers. I thought this beer had a wonderful aroma full of hoppy smells. The head disappears very fast but was mixed with large and small bubbles. It had a heavy taste with just a little after bite. The color was very dark brown and you could not see through it. The beer was the best of their beers that we sampled. Hotstuff gave it a 4.5 rating."
"Very drinkable, rich beer. The taste is mellow but still has a lot of character. Hints of coffee and caramel. Many sottish ales are too strong for easy drinking, but Robert the Bruce is easy going but still has all the body and character you expect in this style. Smooth and rich."
"Rich, clear copper color with some active carbonation but a minimal head. Scents of caramel and sweet malts dominate the pleasant nose. Like the smell, the taste of this beer is pleasant. But like the smell, the taste is also rather weak. Mouthfeel is pleasant enough but the overall feel and flavor is too watery. Sweet malt greets the tongue at the onset and gives way to a distinctively warm finish. There are better Scotch Ales to be had, but this is worth a try, particularly if you consider the McEwans of the world to be *too* syrupy sweet."
"An axe wielding Scottsman with a broad grin stares at you from the label. This beer pours a clear brown (red when held up toward light), with a small head which vanishes to all but a trace very quickly. The aroma of roasted malt comes through both during the pour and when lifting the glass for a smell. The taste is very good, it is mild, with smooth malt and a bit of hops. It has an overall very enjoyable taste. Very smooth in the mouth with a medium to full body. A highly drinkable beer, it is not overpowering in any aspect and is very enjoyable glass after glass."
"-F"
"(Tasted this beer at the Blind Tiger's Three Floyds event)"
"P.S. Much better on draft; guessing that sitting around brought out and balanced out it all  bottle had less malt presence in multiple areas."
"Mellow finish, that just disappears. A bit more light bodied than I expected but that didn't detract from the mouthfeel. High abv 9.1% is barely noticed. Another winning beer for me. Tip of the hat to MJR for including this one."
"Loaded with malt, this brew also has a nice roasty characteristic as it dries out. Full-bodied and very smooth all the way through. This is very easy to drink, and just a wonderful brew. It is my first one from 3 Floyds, and it really has me looking forward to more."
"It's a bright Indian red color. The head is large and fluffy for about a minute and then recedes to a nice lace. Caramel and toffee are in the aroma, pleasing. A medium bodied brew, the flavors are mostly caramel maltiness, and then some hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is definitely a little thin, but not watery. It's a malt dominated brew, but stays mellow overall. I too do not believe the 9.1% ABV listing. There is no hint of such. I enjoyed this beer very much. Five more are in the fridge and they will be consumed happily."
"Found this at my local in Ohio, haven't seen any 12 ounce offerings in Ohio yet, since Three Floyd's came back. I notice the beer label has the same Robert the Bruce with some shiny new reflective gleam compared to the old labels. Nice to see it this fresh bottled on 2/25/14, maybe this will be a sign more fresh 12 ounce bottles coming our way. Pours a dark mahogany brown hue with ruby highlights, light cream colored tan head with fine speckled lacing. Aroma has hints of dark roasted malts, nutty cereal notes...full on malt assault maybe a layer of herbal hops for a bit of balance. The label states it best ""this ale will bring a smile to any malt lover's lips!", I'm a malt lover at times but please guys send us some Zombie Dust!!! Flavor has hints of leather, big fruit malt notes, raisin, charred malt, with roasted malts. Some herbal hops in the finish but truly a nice Scottish Ale, this weighs in at 6.5% abv and it's relatively well hidden between sips...no burn in the backend. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy textured, tame natural levels of carbonation no off flavors between sips, full malt bodied drinking ale. Overall, I wish I liked this style more, because truth be told I know this is one of the best examples of the style I've ever had, just not my cup of tea."
"A medium-pale, copper colored ale which pours with a fine foam layer atop. Smell is fully a malt character, with some metallic undertones. Taste was a bit surprising to me -- not outside the realm of its aroma (which very closely matches), but in my expectations from the bottle's labeling: ""Scottish Style Ale."" After further information I realized I was not dealing with a bold peat-smoked variety, but rather one from an alternate style in which malt predominates. All in all I found it subtle such that at any given session I might rate it a bit low or a bit higher (thus, fitting average)."
"Pours orange/amber hue with a small white head. Strong butterscotch flavor. Medium to light body, yet an interesting malt profile. I really enjoy this beer. Not the typical scotch ale, yet a neat interpretation. The purist might not go for this one. Yet I find it tasty and smooth."
"I know this is a 'Scottish' ale and not a 'Scotch' ale, which are heavier and maltier, but I'm tired of these wimpy, bland brews calling themselves Scottish-style beers. I want a thick, chewy, malty Scotch ale...I guess I'll have to brew one myself..."
"Rich, medium chestnut brown body is topped by a rather thin, off white head that recedes to a thin layer of foam. A very subtle lacing results as the beer is consumed. The aroma is fairly subdued, with a touch of malt a caramel. The taste is sweet and very malty. Caramel and smoked peat dominate the flavor, with the creamy sweet malt behind them. A bit of bitterness shows up in the finish, noticeable only because I was looking for it. The mouthfeel is like homemade milk caramel that is still warm: very smooth and creamy, it virtually sticks to your teeth and tongue. For the advertised ABV, it is not a bit noticeable. It is every bit as drinkable as a rich Oktoberfest offering. I really like this beer. Next trip to the beer store, I will definitely put more offerings from Three Floyds in my beer portfolio."
"Just got this one home....9% eh? Packs a punch but I don't know about 9%. Anyway, on with the review. Pours a nice golden caramel color, not quite as dark as I expected. Nice 1/2 inch head full of tiny bubbles that sticks around..smells. Not a real strong scent here...mainly alcohol & sugary malt scents. Taste is sweet and malty at first, somewhat doughy then ends on a hoppy/bitter/metalliic note. Suprisingly not much alcohol detected in the taste. Mouthfeel is much thinner than expected...quite nice. This beer actually reminds me of the recent batches of Salvator (Which were nowhere near as good as a few years back). To sum it up, tastes like an american hopped doublebock if there is such a thing. Good, but not great.. worth trying if you enjoy the german doublebock style as I do. Maybe they should rename this one."
"A decent, simplistic Scotch ale, but nothing to shout about."
"This beer pours into the glass a medium red/burnt orange color, very clear. Carbonation present. The head was creamy and beige in color, somewhat lasting and there was some lace stretched on the sides of the glass. The aroma was faint, I had to swirl it and cover to get something. I nosed caramel, malt, fruit (faint) and some hops (faint) and alcohol. The taste was surprisingly decent. Tastes of roasted malt, some mild hops, fruit and alcohol all became present on my tongue. The end feeling after this left me a little warm on the inside, d/t the alcohol (not drunk, just that warm feeling you get from alcohol). Three Floyds makes good beers, this one is not disappointing."
"Burnt orange brew with a thin tan head. A little bit of lace clings to my pint glass. Deep roasted malt aroma is foremost with a tinge of pungent hop burried beneath. Thin mineral taste comes across at first...going to let it warm up just a bit and see what happens...The mineral taste is gone now that the beer has warmed, much better. Smooth malts are coming through now with a slight hop note. Slightly sweet, well carbonated with a decent mouthfeel. Keep 'em coming."
"Dark copper in color. Not much of a smell for my nose, probably due to the complete absence of hops which results in a flavor that I am not so used to. I am sure that is indicative of the style, but this brew lacks flavor altogether, indistinct malts, little to taste at all. Surpisingly, even the alcohol did not get noticed. Love Three Floyds, but this did not impres me. May have to edit once I gain more experience with the style."
"Deep golden brown color, tan foamy head that dissipates fairly quick, sweet, toffee-like, malt nose, sugar sweet, malty, mildly roasted flavor, buttery feeling. The finish has notes of caramel and slightly bitter. The high alcohol content is noticable, the effects are nice."
"Generous, creamy head, aroma includes toffee, vanilla, soft caramel notes. Dark brown in color. Solid malt here, but very, very hoppy. Sweet, mild, but still a stout and hearty ale, very enjoyable. One of my favorite Scottish Ales. Hail Robert the Bruce!"
"This one pours a deep amber color with an almost non-existent head. Subtle notes of sweet malt linger in the nose, but aren't nearly pronounced enough. Taste is pretty good with that sweet malt flavor and notes of alcohol throughout. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but for a beer of its epic proportions, it's fairly easy to drink. Not Three Floyds' best, I was a bit disappointed with this one. Still a good beer, regardless."
"Smooth and quite a darkish brown color.  Notes of chocolate and sweet malt cover the tongue on tasting.  Quite rounded and drinkable.  Quite rich tasting and would be a good cold weather brew.  Tasted at the brewery on tap."
"Deep amber with a quickly dissapating tan foam.  Very malty in aroma and taste, athough not very sweet, with a bitter finish.  High alcohol, is detectable, and has a warming effect.  Pretty high in carbonation for a Scottish Heavy Ale, with a medium body.  Not one of Three Floyd's best brews, and not one of the best Scottish Heavy's I've had, but a solid offering nonetheless."
"This beer poured a dark reddish amber color with a white head that didn't hold and left only a small amount of lace.  It had an aroma of malt and caramel.  The taste was of malt, hops and caramel.  The body was lighter than other scotch ales, but sweet with a slightly dry but bitter finish.  Not the best scotch ale, but no slouch, although it could have been a bit heavier in body."
"277"
"This one pours with an average, slightly off-white head, amber colored liquid with a malty nose..not much hop presence at all. Tastes slightly sweet, then quickly drys out. A little on the light-bodied side for a Scotch Ale...not 100% true to the style, but still very enjoyable nonetheless. Quite deceptive given it's strength. Good beer from a good brewery."
"I remember it well, up in MN after seeing Braveheart. Suprisingly drinkable for such a horseshoe. Nice deep reddish-auburn. Smells of hay and a little skank. A bit tart on the finish which was bizarre."
"With the scottish ale type I was expecting less hops. Hop flavor overwhelms what would be a nice Scottish ale and it is a bit thin. It did get better the closer to the bottom I got however. Color lacked a lot of the reddish color that a lot of the really good scottish ales have."
"Pours a nice bright amber with a thin head that dissipates quickly.  Caramelish malt and light citrus hops in the nose.  Sweet malt shoulders the flavor but gives way to a nice tangy citric hop flavor.  Tangy and smooth on the palate and highly drinkable.  This is a bit thinner than some scottish heavies and quite a bit hoppier, but I like the variation on the style.  A well made beer."
"Deep in red in color that finishes off with a fluffy head. Very well balanced medium hop taste. Very drinkable for the alcohol content. Beer label is very cool!!"
"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is a bit thin. Other than that, it's a nice brew. Nice, brown color, just as I would expect a Scottish ale to be. The taste is a combination of sweet and tangy, actually quite pleasant. Strangely, I hardly noticed the alcohol. Again, this beer was a bit thin for my taste. Still, it's generally impressive, and I'll drink it again."
"Some smell of alcohol...Flower and spice early in the sip, feels well-bodied in the mouth...malt is slightly bready.  I like it though its more ""scotch"" than ""scottish"" in its noticeable alcohol body and presence.  Its style is not advertized on the bottle as heavy, so I was expecting a strength more like a bitter..."
"I find this brew quite flavorful, perhaps a little thin compared to say...Belhaven. But it's clearly a Scottish ale in style and not a Scotch ale."
"Dark bronze color, with no particular aroma.  The malt was mellow with caramel notes that had a sweet rather than roasted quality.  The hops finish was restrained.  Mouthfeel was fairly thin, and even in consideration that this is on the lighter end of the Scottish style, I felt it needed a little more substance."
