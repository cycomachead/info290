There is a faint blueberry skin in there, but not the dominant aroma.  Taste has a bit more blueberry, fairly juicy, a touch meaty.  Acetic acid isn't as strong as I thought from the nose, a fair bit of it through the finish. Some rubbery notes mid palate. Fuller body, a bit granule, very dry and moderate carb.","cpetrone84","Sep 25, 2014"

4.52,3.4,3,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.25,"Poured from bottle. Pours a chunky purplish red with visible remnants of blueberry flesh and skins, somewhat hazy appearance. Not sure if all bottles pour this way or if this needed more time in the fridge to settle out. Appearance isn't the prettiest but I'm going to let that slide due to the strengths in the other categories. The nose has a very classic flanders red nose with heavy oak, strong acetic qualities as well as some tannic notes. Tart blueberries bring a brightness to the acidity and pair well with the wine character. The taste is expertly balance as per Side Project fashion. Blueberries come through with strong tartness and a hint of juicy muffin like sweetness. This quickly gives way to heavy oak and Chardonnay notes. Finish is tart and leaves the palate wanting more. Mouthfeel is well carbonated with a medium body. Overall, delicious. The fruited brews that Side Project has released so far are ridiculously tastey (as are the others) and I will continue to seek out the future releases.","homebrew311","Aug 05, 2014"

It haunted me until today. Really glad that I got a chance to try this beer! Nice twist on the Flanders Red style using blueberries, it actually makes this beer smell and taste more like a fruit lambic that of a Flanders Red style sour ale. Irreguardless what a fantastic sour beer! It did not dissapoint at all.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Aug 01, 2014"

4.35,-0.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The beer pours a dark garnet maroon color speckled by coarse sediment and topped by a thin off white head that fades quickly. The nose has a slight blueberry/cherry acetic kick, some funk and saline, and bb muffiny malts as it warms. There is mostly Flanders upfront, but it finishes with lingering tart, acidic blueberry skin. It's a surprisingly tart and acidic, medium bodied, and minimally carbonated Flanders, that has a subtle, yet distinct blueberry profile. I don't pick up tremendous oak, and the expected cherry-like fruitiness is neck-and-neck with the blueberries. I would gladly drink this beer again and expect it to develop in a really fantastic way.","ThePorterSorter","Jul 25, 2014"
4.45,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall, this is a very good beer, but I really have no frame of reference with another blueberry sour to compare it to. Personally, I would have liked to see this one stray a little more towards the blueberry profile and away from the flanders acidic sour qualities, but that being said, it is still among the best flanders reds I've had. And the blueberries add a great dimension.","boilermakerbrew","Jul 25, 2014"
