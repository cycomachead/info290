3.98,25.9,4,3.5,4.25,4,4,"This was a surprise to see on shelves. For being open for a little over a year, Grey Sail has put out quite a few good beers in a variety of styles. They're a class act and I'm happy to find another reason to support them. This is not an overwhelmingly sour beer, but it's got a unique flavor with a lot of brown ale characteristics. Really enjoyed this one.","RoninTK3","Beers"

As a big fan of sours I was excited to see this local offering, unfortunately it smelled like an unwashed mash tun after a few days. I tried to drink it but the taste was like licking the walls of said mash tun, an unfortunate drainpour.","lucas1801","0"
