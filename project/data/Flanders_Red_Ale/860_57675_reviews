"Overall, wish there was a lot more brett in this beer, but still enjoyable."

"cool but inconsistent beer, different every time i try it, and this latest batch may have been the least impressive of the lot. its murky amber in color, almost flat from the tap, with a foot smelling funk that shows weird sour mashing, a little off, and an overall weirdness to it. definitely a wild ale, but just so much funk, gym socky and sweaty and unsettling a little in the stomach. i remember it differently though, as an excellent flanders red, vinegary and fuller bodied with a lot of rich caramel grain character. it has always been like that, but the funk seems way higher than the lacto part now, and like some of those spontaneous overpriced italian wilds, this one is unfamiliar in a way im not sure i like. backyard bucket type beer, maybe batch variance is intentional, but i liked previous editions far more than this latest brew."

"Dark gold color with a thin and quick to vanish head. I like my Flemish Reds more red. Smells more like strawberries rather than cherries. There's a nice wet straw rustic tone that carries from the aroma into the flavor. Flavor is a again more strawberries than cherry. Not nearly tart enough."

"A tribute to the renowned Greg Noonan. Poured into a snifter, a hazy rusty amber color with a fizzly, short-lived, white head. Aroma of grass, white wine, tart berries, with a touch of Brett funk. Taste followed the aroma; this beer wasn't overly fruity, but there was a definite berry tartness to it, lightly sour, a bit of grassy barnyard funk. Nothing too extreme or too hard on the senses / palate. Slight metallic twinge in the finish. Medium body, nicely drinkable, quite good overall."

"Pours a slightly cloudy deep amber color with a wisp of a head that was gone before I knew it. Smell is tart and sour with a hint of funk. Lemons and tart cherries with a barn yard earthy edge to it. Taste is tart fruit and lactic up front with an earthy funky flavor that comes in mid to finish. Slight plastic phenol pops up but quickly goes away thankfully. Medium body with a crisp level of carbonation and a tart acidic mouthfeel. Decent sour, but not world class."

"overall - pretty good. Nice to drink when I'm out."
"Taste is very good, sharp and tart and lots of acidic and funky flavors throughout. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a sharp finish."

"Carbonation seemed low for the style and detracted from what probably should have been a crisper, cleaner experience. Decent but certainly not outstanding."
"Pours a hazed copper color with little spots of off-white bubbles. Scent is quite light and made up of equal parts damp grain, wet earth and medicinal bandaid. Taste comes across as light when served cold, needs to warm before the funk comes across as rounded enough to be more than just musty and damp grain and earthy, light medicinal off notes blend with a touch of tart dark fruit. Light in body with ample carbonation, dry. This beer took a really long time to grow on me and was best opened up after time exposed to air and warmth, most of the time i spent wondering how bland this was."
"D - Tulach Leis is an approachable sour beer with a pleasant fruity tartness and adequate funk that never loses control."
"On tap at Mondiale 2011. Medium red colour, a little head. A good mouthfeel for the style, as they added significant malt. This also served to take down the sourness from what I would have expected. A nice beer,no poems to be written about it, I enjoyed it and found it good drinkability and would gladly have it again."
"Overall, this is an interesting Brett beer but not much of a Flanders. A good experiment, though, and I'm glad I tried it. It's always nice to go into a brewpub and see they're trying something different."
"While I honestly hate to rip on any beer made in tribute to Greg Noonan (and especially one made at the VPB) but I thought that this beer was really boring. I mean I liked the look and feel here and it seemed like a Flemish Red to me and I could pick up the brett flavors but this overall just didn't pull together like I would have hoped for. Even my wife, who is a BIG fan of tart/sour beers repeatedly, remarked me to how bland this seemed considering the description. It was unfortunately a chore to get through the glass. Ah well."
"A fitting tribute to the man. Greg Noonan. You must have one in his honor!"
