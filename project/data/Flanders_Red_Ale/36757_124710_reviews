"O: I like this overall though the progression on the palate seems a bit disjointed - hard to describe, it either needs some unifying element or to lose the bitter. Still definitely recommended and I like the tartness, it made my mouth water"

"Muddy red with a tiny white head that's quick to dissipate.  Amazing funky, fruity aroma with sour cherries most prevalent. Not tart and tangy enough for my taste, though, and too light bodied. It's not bad, but doesn't hold up to the classics."

"Overall, a bit one dimensional with the sweet and tart cherries, but I enjoyed it."

"O - This Flanders Red style that is comparable to New Glarus Oud Bruin."

"Definetly sour,,,I'm having a hard time finding much other flavor though"
"Has a really earthy bitter flavor.  Did not care for this at all."

"this folks have to be some of the only ones putting sour beers like these into cans, so thats pretty cool right there, maxing the exotic more accessible. i like this more than others from them so far, its extremely sour too, with a major pucker and not quite enough of a caramel malt base to balance it out in the finish, i found the acid dominating. i do like that its not as vinegar forward as the belgian ones, and not quite as complex either, i dont really get the wood, and the maturity, but the taste is really nice, and i can see this getting enormously popular as a result of its availability and overall quality. amazing how many beers these guys have launched into the market all at once, huge takeover it seems like. bright rust color with a soft inch of tan foam on it. looks the part just fine. i think it may be a little one dimensional with all the acidity, but i appreciate what they are shooting for with it. some serious cherry flavors before the finish, dried, tart, and sweet all at once. very glad to have canned options like this in the market."

"Cherries through and a slightly vinous finish, pretty good."

"O- A nice American version of a Flanders Red and a pleasant surprise. Many of the American versions I've had are too medicinal and not tart enough but this one is wonderfully balanced. A great beer for the price too."
"Falls a little flat. Wish it had more of that sour zing,"

"Poured in a tulip, needed to have this twice to confirm my thoughts. Beautiful deep red/maroon color with nice head retention.  All downhill from here.  Smells like canned tomatoes, tart and metallic.  Starts sour, taste of tart cherries and ripe plum.  Dry and very metallic finish.  Like sucking on a penny.  Glad this only came in a 4 pack, not something I'd get again."

"12 ounce can.  Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy reddish/copper color with about an inch light tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like sweet and tart cherries, vinegar, caramel, and bready malt.  Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also some plum, wood and a bit of brown sugar noticeable too.  I think it's mostly tart with a bit of sweetness.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with low/moderate carbonation.  I think this is an enjoyable brew, certainly worth picking up if you've never had it before.  $8.99 a 4-pack."

"Looks like muddy sludge.  Smells vinegary and stale.  OK cherry flavor but a stale bready malt backbone takes over, similar to the taste when a DIPA stales into a crappy barley wine of sorts.  Honestly tastes like a crappy sour cherry barleywine without the alcohol punch.  Many thanks to the BA that extra'd me this but a definite miss by the brewery on both style and taste."
"Wild Sour pours a reddish color with a small lacing head.  There is a very sour aroma, hints of sweet fruit.  The taste has a noticeable sour, sweet fruit, very dry crisp aftertaste.  Great flavors, great body.  Overall a top notch sour."
"Poured a non head copper color, smelled like a sour should but a bit more grainy. Had a great taste reminded me of the Here gose nothing from this brewery but this had a bit of rye at the end. Light watery feel. A nice beer, it is not like a traditional Flanders but still has its own character."
""
""
"Pours brown wood like in color with a slight crimson hue and a thin fizzy off white head. Smell has some tart fruity aromas of brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, cherries, plums, currents and an acidic finish. Taste has a dominant cherry acidic tartness forward with sticky sweet malt backbone in the mid section and more plum and prune in the finish. Mouthfeel is tart, sticky, acidic, moderately carbonated, medium bodied, with a dry semi tannic finish. Not exactly to style, but a good sour bomb."

"Lactic, lightly acetic, bready caramel malt, tart cherry, very light oak tannin, lemon peel on finish"
"I love Flanders but this just fell short of what I consider a true Flanders .  There was a weird off twang/metallic taste to it that didn't do it for me."
"Tart cherry on the front, it ends short."
""
"O - Unlike many classic Flanders reds, Destihl's Wild Sour really amps up the lactic sourness which I'm a-ok with. The malt profile and fruit notes are still there as is the lingering, though much more subdued, sweetness on the finish. I much prefer this beer on tap as opposed to the can (no knock on cans!) but it's damn good either way!"

"Flavor dies on the finish. Not oak-aged and no trace of any lacto. An authentic Flanders Red would have these characteristics."

"Really interesting beer.  I doubt the brewers intended it to have that kraut undercurrent, but it's there.  It's subtle enough to not be a turn-off, but I can't really call it a plus, either.  Kind of a ""bonus feature"" that made this a fun one to figure out."

"Tastes essentially like their Gose (which is awesome) with some darker malts. Not really anything in the vain of a Flanders Red"
""
"A perfectly fine beer, and quite enjoyable at that, but it doesn't really bring one back to other, more classic takes on the style."
""
"Not sure if we had a bad batch, but flavor was horrible.   Looked and smelled like a typical flanders but taste was off."
""
""
"The Taste and the Feel of this beer is where it really fell apart for me.   The taste and mouthfeel of a Flanders can only be achieved successfully in my mind by blending young and old beer together and I can't imagine they did that with this beer.   What appears to have happened is a non-barreled aged Flanders style red released to the public in an unblended version that is thin, watery, and lacking the desirable complex flavor typically associated to a Flanders Red, and instead finish's sweet, and like candied apples due to possible under-attenuation and oxidation.     It doesn't appear to have Brett, or be barrel aged, and it certainly isn't an outstanding example of a Flanders Red."

"Destihl Brewery Flanders Red -----4/5."

"Overall: Here Gose nothing was a pickle, salt, and brine bomb. The Flanders Red seems like it has a similar flavor profile to it.  I really am pretty disappointed that this wasn't better because I would love an affordable canned sour beer that is readily available to be a real situation...  Destihl Wild sour series is now 0-2 in the canned sour line up. This is nothing close to a Flander Red style sour ale; buyer beware."

"D: Looks smells and tastes like plum. Not too sour at all."

"This is a full-flavored sour ale that strikes a good balance between fruitiness and sourness. Many of the traditional flagship Flanders reds tend to be a little too sour and one-dimensional for my tastes, so this was a pleasant change of pace."
