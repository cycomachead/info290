"Another great sour style beer. To me this is just a classic that all must try."
""
"This is what a Flemish Sour should be. Its darn near perfection in a glass; it pours a brilliant, ruby-red color with minimal head and little lacing. The tart smell, reminiscent of a natural, crisp, hard apple cider, is a delight to the olfactory buds.   The flavor is also crisp, modestly sour and has a very clean finish. If you enjoy sour beers, you should give Strubbe's a try. I believe it will be your gold-standard on which to compare other beers of this style."

"Pours a dark brown color with hints of some hints of copper and mahogany. Ltos of head, which goes down quick, the smell is of red wine, cranberries, lots of fruit. Taste is purple grape, not too sour, less acidity than a sour, and the sweetness is mellow.. Carboation a yeast taste like champagne. Serve with black-berry pie, cream-cheese dishes, stuffed calzones/pizza."

"Not bad at all. This Flemish had very subtle vinegar qualities.  Some hints of cherry,and other fruit. Not bad at all, but not great."

"Pours out a reddish brown with a thick off-white head.  This has one of the strongest noses of any Flemish sour I've ever had.  Loads of berries, vanilla, caramel malts.  A whiff of vinegar.  Flavor is very sour with an excellent dryness in the finish.  Vinegar isn't overwhelming as in some other Flemish sours.  Very fruity with a mild toastiness from the malts.  Mouthfeel is light and effervescent.  This is easily one of the greatest of the style that I've had."
"Good flemish red. Vinegary finish. Good balance of sweet and sour."
""
""
"The pour looked promising, a reddish brew with a brown cast. Light brown head that held. But the aroma had a muted sour with a sweet component. The taste followed the aroma. Some sour, but not much. Some cherry, but not much. This gave way to a malty sweet on the finish. Yeast present, but subtle."

"Ovearll- A solid Flemish Red Ale I would recommend this as a starter for people just getting into the style, if you have never had a Flemish Red Ale or a sour try this...CHEERS"
"Overall - Very tasty. An above-average Flemmish Red Ale, but not the best either."
"Overall: An easy drinker but lacks funk and tartness when compared to some of the better examples of the style"

"Poured a nice, dark, deep reddish brown with red tinting at the edges of the glass and a thin off-white head. Quite nice, very appealing and pleasant to look at. Scents of Balsamic vinegar, sour cherries, overripe fruit, sour funk and faint caramel malt. A good sour aroma, quite appealing. Flavor begins with sour and funky notes alongside sweet, moscato-like white grape, moving into some indeterminate fruity flavors, sour apple, caramel and earthy mustiness. The finish is tart, with some sweetness. An excellent flavor profile that blends sour and sweet into a lovely whole. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a slightly sticky, semi-drying feel. Quite nice. Overall this was a great Flanders Red that has an excellent aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. Highly recommended."

"O - 3.75 - Great sour beer. Would have it again. Belgium is pretty good at this stuff."
"D: A wonderfully reserved sour. Waves of varying fruits (again, reserved, not over the top). I'm starting to really appreciate blended beers like this one (50% young beer blended with 50% beer aged in Bordeaux wine barrels). The aging softens this brew and adds a nuanced extra layer of complexity. This is one you'll want to take your time to enjoy even though the ABV is a very agreeable 6.5%."

"O - It isnt the greatest Flanders red ale I've had, but far from the worst. It is quite sweet and slightly tart, but not really that sour for me (I love sours). I probably wouldn't buy it again for $12 a bottle at a bar, but if I saw it on the shelf at a beer store for cheaper, I might consider it."

"Overall (2) - The sourness of the beer didn't agree with me, but the citrus flavors were good."
""
""
"Live life drink beer!!!:-)"
"overall... not much lacing on the glass- seems a bit thin, but flavor is there. i like the sourness of it and i like the general style of these brews. often wonder why no american brewer attempts a 'sour' . . . . do americans just not 'get into' these types of beers? i love 'em!"
""
""
"Overall- This is a good Flanders with a sweeter approach. I like my Flanders to be a little more tart, but this is solid."

"Pours a deep reddish brown with a light brown/off white head. Nose is vinegar, cherry, grape, caramel, apple cider and a sharp citrus hidden way in the back. The taste is much less vinegary (thankfully). Cherry, sour apples, grapes, berries, slight vinegar in the background and a little lemon. The body is light and the carbonation is a little lower than I thought it'd be. The sour level on this is way lower than expected. Just a slight tartness. Not the best flemish red/sour etc but pretty good nonetheless. It says best before 2017, so maybe the vinegar would mellow out and it'd move a lot up the ladder."

"Beer is medium-bodied with low levels of carbonation. A bit undercarbonated for the weight of the body, leaving the mouthfeel to be smooth, but turgid. Finish is dry, as expected, but little sourness can be felt on the palate."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color with an off-white head. Balsamic and red wine vinegar on the nose. Some malt sweetness, a touch of oak, and a bit of grass. There's a weird coffee sort of aroma in there, maybe a bit of chocolate, too. The flavor is a bit on the sweet side, but there is a fair amount of acetic sourness to it. Some red wine vinegar, oak, leather, and grass. Somewhat dry on the finish, a bit of coca cola in there as well."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some fruity grape juice and grape jelly aromas. Taste is much the same along with a slight vinegar flavor as well. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but I think it smells better than it tastes."
"This is a nice flanders red ale. It's pretty direct and not really complex or unusual, which is a-okay with me. It's nice to be able to get a beer of this style that works and fits to how it should be. As usual, the first hit really zaps your mouth, but it's happy trails from there on out."
"OVERALL- The oak really pops out in this beer. It is not the most complex example of the style I've had but the tannin should make it fun to age a few bottles. Very fun beer to drink and a great sub for red wine."
""
""
"Overall - Pretty interesting brew overall. Not a bad taste, and pretty intriguing to think about."
""
""
"A very nice sour. Good intro sour, but also a good sour for veterans."
"D: Certainly not a bad beer, but really not that interesting. I forgot the price, but if this was cheap it would be worth it as a nice refreshing beer. Otherwise it's overshadowed by others in it's class."
""
"There's some good stuff going on, all the hallmarks of a flanders red, but it just doesn't come together great for me. Not bad for the style but passable."
"Pours brown - purely brown without even a red glow. Definitely sweet for the style, the sweetest I've had. Still enough sour to get the idea. Big on brown sugar and musty wood. Also some cherry, raspberry, and fig along with a woody, peppery spice. Much more Oude Bruin in my opinion. Good enough, not great. Between this and the Duchesse (the 2 regularly available Flanders Reds in Oklahoma) I'll go Duchesse everytime."
""
"Where’s the tartness?? Where’s the refreshing quality?? A very average Flanders Red. Sweet in the wrong way. A tough style to master, for sure, and I love to try them all. This one is pretty true to style, so I give it that. Not a mockery, by any means. It’s just that I’m used to quality, and this doesn’t have much of that. If you’re like me and love these ales, then I must say it’s worth one spin. One and that’s all. You’ll know what I mean. 3.5"

"Not all flanders red's are the same. Strubbe's is a good one, and one that is a little sweeter than the crowd. Possibly a good choice to those who want to get introduced to the style."
"The liquid comes out looking dark reddish in hue with some brown strokes set within. A nice fuzzy coca cola like head skims up with some tightness and a off tan color to it. No stick on the glass. Smell is pretty much deep vinegar with some faint cherry scent and some grain. Trace amounts of caramel notes, but this one is all about the vinegar. Taste is sweet over sour and it's very apparent. Vinegar, cherry, cola, sweet malt, you get the picture. Very reminiscent of Duchesses. Feel is less than medium, a nice crisp carb and not acidic, not a pucker inducing beer, but pleasant, I just cant stand the vinegar. I could only drink 6oz of this before passing on it."

"O: Tough category to be in, because there are a LOT of delicious Flanders Red Ale's. I feel like the ""average"" flanders red is pretty damn good. So this one is a little above average. It can hold up against the big boys. I like the balance that's struck between the acetic and sweet qualities."
""
"O/D-Not bad at all. Didn't have any trouble finishing the bottle. Although, after some sips it tasted a bit off. Quite a good time however because it mostly tasted damn good."
""
"Aftertaste is vinegar then crab apples."
"Good balance of sweet and tart. Nice yeast profile and went down very smooth. I will be buying more of this."
""
"Overall: This was another delicious treat to start off the new year. Belgiums grow on me more and more and only one thing to do, go there. I think I would have liked a little more sour and oak to the beers, but after being aged for a while, these things may have mellowed out and let the tart fruits come out. Still a good beer to enjoy again."
"Tartness starts out slow & buikds, still a touch sweeter than I like my Flanders Red, This needs some age I think, but would be a great entre to the style"
""
"Aftertaste is slightly bitter and sour."
""
""
"Taste is less funky than I expected. Tart with a sweet malty backbone. Almost tastes like a brown ale with a hint of sour. The finish is quite dry and the sour stays on my palate for a while. Still, on the whole it's well balanced overall and very drinkable. Would have liked more fruits and complex funky flavors to come through, but that might just be my expectations of the style talking."
""
"Dr: Very drinkable, which isn't often observed in beers of this style. A good, a relatively above average ABV, and good quality make this a beer every beer advocate should try."
"Not a bad Flemish Red, and pleasantly smooth. I really like a good bite of acidity to the style though—to me, this is a quenching, refreshing style of beer, and this one misses that somewhat. That's not to say it's not an interesting example, however."
"Taste follows this, caramel malt sweetness, mild tartness, something oddly vegetal, then it finishes tangy and dry. Thankfully not sweet as some pretenders to the style can be. Malt sweetness shows through, at room temperature there are some mild fruit and vinous qualities that are hallmarks of the style. Overall ok, though i'd probably grab Rodenbach over this any day. Still, it's something to try for fans of Flemish sour ales."
"Recommended"
"Taste is sweet-tart cherries, iron, hint of dark bread, finish of caramelized topast and grain, light hint of peppery bitterness. It is excellent, with good complexity and depth and a very nice, full character with good balance."
"Someone told me this tastes like what Rodenbach used to taste like, not really sure what that means, but lets find out. It pours out a hazy dark rose color, with a creamy one finger of white heading. Husky grain is the first thing I notice in the smell, followed by some chocolate and red berry. Very vinous as far as the taste is concerned. You definitely get cherry, but not especially sweet. A hint of black pepper can also be detected here. The mouthfeel is pretty thick, and layered in complexity. This is one big, beefy rendition of a Flanders Red, and a damn tasty one at that. Super rare steak and this beer need to come together soon."
"Nice prickly carbonation up front, a balanced sweet malt and tart berry middle. Finish is dry and lightly puckering - I'd say overall it's a very refreshing balance and this is one of the more easy drinking Flemish reds I've had. It does well after some warmth allowing the bugs to bite a little more - would be interesting to try one with some cellar time. Not the best, but a very good intro."
"O: A very nice example of this style. I would easily put this into the ranks of Rodenbach. Very drinkable and quite delicious!"
"O: Not a bad beer, kind of on the lower end of the style for me, nothing really here to come back to. As a stand alone beer it's a B, just not very good to style, compared with Rodenbach or La Folie, there's no contest."
"Worth a try for sure and perhaps a good cross into reds. It does blend better as the temperature increases. Perhaps I began at too low a temp. Worth trying not my favorite."
"Overall. Decent refreshing sour beer, nothing to right home about, I would drink it over any other common main stream beer but only as a last result."
"Notes: Well balanced, but lacks depth especially for the style. A sour beer that since it isn't so sour would be good with food."
"Overall this is a a little rough around the edges although certainly above average."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 33cl bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours a hazy mahogany with a half inch bright white head that dissipates into a frothy skim. Some spots and thin slashes of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose is tart, acidic, oaky and sour cherries. Taste is consistent with nose; however, not as sweet as anticipated. There's also a bit of yeasty character in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation (perhaps a little creamy towards the middle) that culminates in a semi-dry finish. An easy drinking Flanders Red that would make a great gateway beer for someone just getting into sours."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable ""Flemish"" ale, and one which other non-sour drinkers found very interesting and inviting. I hope to get more to see if the Brett and Lacto improve or get funkier with a little more time..."
"Very drinkable and very nice. This is a beer that the inexperienced and experienced will both like. Good with lots of food profiles."
"Taste matches the smell (sweet) but soon gives way to a very tangy flavor, with an oaky, bourbony (if that's a word) presence."
"D - An interesting, complex & tasty beer. Well worth trying & something I'd buy again."
"I could not taste the yeast in this beer, but this seems to fit the Flemish Red Ale category definition perfectly, and while it was too sour from my perspective and definitely not a session beer, I still found it somewhat enjoyable. This is a good beer and worth trying."
"33 cl bottle pours a mostly clear, rusty brown body with a small and fleeting beige head. Specks of lacing left on the snifter. Aroma of earthy wood, cranberries, cherry skins, and caramel. Light medium body has a subtle, but effective, carbonation. Taste is mostly sour, with cranberries and cherry skins. Some apple cider vinegar notes, as well. Earthy and woody notes pervade from start to finish. A hint of caramel keeps the sourness in check. Very well executed and pleasantly drinkable."
"Poured a nice orange toned brown color from the tap into a very nice looking goblet style glass. The head was non-existant, but I can't say if it was the beer or whatever the bar happened to wash the glass with. After a few sipps the head on the side of the glass remained. The flavor was sweet and sour with a tart aftertaste. Very light in the body making this a highly drinkable beer. My first beer of this event, so I was hirsty, but still a good start regaurless."
"served a clear dark orange with minimal head. Smell is of balsamic vinigar with a hint of sweetness. Taste mimics the smell. Crisp. dry aftertaste. Infinately drinkable. Light body and not too much of anything but more than enough to be interesting. Excellent."
