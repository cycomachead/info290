Aroma is nice, the brew smells like sweet and tart cherries, vinegar, caramel, and bready malt.  Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also some plum, wood and a bit of brown sugar noticeable too.  I think it's mostly tart with a bit of sweetness.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with low/moderate carbonation.

The taste and mouthfeel of a Flanders can only be achieved successfully in my mind by blending young and old beer together and I can't imagine they did that with this beer.   What appears to have happened is a non-barreled aged Flanders style red released to the public in an unblended version that is thin, watery, and lacking the desirable complex flavor typically associated to a Flanders Red, and instead finish's sweet, and like candied apples due to possible under-attenuation and oxidation.     It doesn't appear to have Brett, or be barrel aged, and it certainly isn't an outstanding example of a Flanders Red.","nppeders","Dec 29, 2014"

I really am pretty disappointed that this wasn't better because I would love an affordable canned sour beer that is readily available to be a real situation...  Destihl Wild sour series is now 0-2 in the canned sour line up. This is nothing close to a Flander Red style sour ale; buyer beware.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Nov 17, 2014"
