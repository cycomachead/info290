4.41,14.5,5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Pulled a 2.5 year old bottle from the cellar and am drinking it one day before its best by date. Even after some age it still has a very big cherry nose with touches of sweet and tart and a hint of fresh compost. It is one of the most beautiful beers I have seen. It pours a lively brilliant cherry under a very rocky pure white 1” foam cap. Very rich cherry palate with herbal, black cherries, lemony tartness and over ripe fruit. While there is sweetness in the background, there is an overall dryness and a balancing tartness.  The beer is effervescent with a fine bead. Midrange between sweet and sour, well balanced and put together.","pat61","Mar 07, 2015"

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, candied sugar, strawberry, and sweet tarts. The flavor was of sweet malt, strawberry, cherry, sugar, cherry syrup, and subtle sweet tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I will warn all who approach this brew that it is a lot more sweet than some other Krieks out there. This does cover up quite a bit of the subtle flavors that were present as I could not pick them out unfortunately. For what they were aiming for it really wasn’t too bad if I honest as the sweetness did carry throughout, but it wasn’t overpowering to the point where you think you are going to get diabeetus from drink a glass of it. A fairly well done brew that I wouldn’t mind having again in the future if more funky Krieks are not available at the time.","thagr81us","Dec 18, 2012"

Smells of sour cherries and brown sugar with a hint of vinegar. A light bit of lactic with enough sweetness to keep some balance. The flavor is lots of tart cherries and lots of sweet and brown sugar with just enough lactic tartness and a hint of balsamic. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet tart almost syrupy mouthfeel going on. I love cherries, and this one did not disappoint on that front. That being said, as a Flanders red this one falls a bit short for me. It really needs more tart. This feels like a wine cooler to some extent, I'll bet this is pasteurized and back-sweetened ala lindemanns.

The expected tartness isn't really there, replaced by a very blunt sour cherry flavor. The wood returns as well, adding a nice oaky backdrop to the proceedings and repelling any tartness that would have wanted to show itself.

This is a little thin and watery for the style, some interesting spices added, not nearly as sour as it could be, and a little too cherry sweet, lacking that soury punch needed for the style. I like this beer, and would drink it again, but if I want a genuine Flemish Red, to Duchesse and Rodenbach I will venture, and so should you.

4.52,17.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"nkish red hue surmounted by a pink off-white head. Nice nose with that oak cask wood thing going on that seduces me like always. Woody with weird almost smoky notes. Leafy balsamic vinegar notes and of course an honest mostly sweet cherry base. Palate is balsamic, very refreshing, oaky vanilla, but acidity level remains low enough to be accessible. Excellent!","Rastacouere","Apr 12, 2004"
4.32,12.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I thought Goudenband was a good Flemish red ale, but this is much better, maybe because its not really a Flemish red ale. Does the addition of cherries make it no longer a true blue Flanderish brew? Whatever, it tastes damn good. Like a dollop of palette cleansing sorbet after a spectacular meal.","nomad","Feb 16, 2004"
3.8,-1.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"A deep red color. The aroma is sour, with note of vinegar, and it definitely has good cherry notes to it. The taste is refreshing and dry with a sour cherry character. This would be a great beer to drink on a hot day. Fruity, but not at all cloying with a nice balancing tartness.","Gueuzedude","Jan 27, 2004"

4.22,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a strawberry tea color with a very fizzy pink head the dissipates rapidly. The smell is somewhat wine-like with a tart grape and warming alcohol aroma bilowing from the glass. The taste starts with a carb bite sliding into the tart fruit and warming alcohol and ends with a cranapple type of bitter-sweet finish. This is a light bodied brew that ends on a lightly sweet note. This could go wonderfully with certain dishes! Although very tasty and positive in every other way, the drinkability would suffer a bit because a little goes a long way (with all due respect). Thanks to belgianbum for the chance to taste such a beer! Op uw gezonheid!","BeerAngel","Oct 19, 2003"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Smell is a souring cherry tinge and wild oaky sweetness with some yeasty meat-like bacon notes. Taste has a quick hold of souring cherry, substantially biting and sweet oakyness with a nice little tart kick. Notes of yeasty uncrisp bacon laying on the side of the oak character, kinda weird but nice. Simple and pleasing, not a overbearing cherry fruitness, just alot of cherry character in the sour and tart areas which it has a good portion of. Pretty full feel upfront with a quickening hit of souring then eases out and finds lots of tart cherry dryness and oaky sweetness. A pretty decent, quite powering little brew, a pleasure to drink. Another thanks goes out to jeffboo for the bottle.","tavernjef","Sep 02, 2003"

Still has the stinkyness, meat and blood of the bottled version, but the palate didn't feel the same.","rastaman","Apr 14, 2003"

3.86,0.3,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Rereview (4/14/03): OK, who am I kidding? When I first reviewed this beer, I was new to the site and must have been reviewing in comparison to other sour beers (eg, Goudenband). And comparitively, it IS average. But this is a really tasty beer, and the blend of sour and cherries is delightful. Very tasty. More points from me the second time around.","marburg","0"
4.15,7.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"This beer pours a clear medium dark brownish red with a largish quickly dissipating pink effervescent head. The mouthfeel is moderate. The smell is of faint sour cherries and oak. The taste is oak mild cherries sweetness offset by a sour acidity. This is a very oaky acidic pleasing not overly fruit beer. Quite nice.","fattyre","Feb 26, 2003"
4.1,6.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Pours a blush-wine red. Minimal pink head fades to nothing, with soft carbonation fizzing up. Very little aroma - gently fruity with the barest hint of solvent. Tartly sweet at the front of the tongue, shifting to sour cherry as the fluid moves back on the tongue. An interesting sensation. Sour/tart nicely balances the initial sweetness, which otherwise would be cloying. I had this as an after-dinner drink, for which it was ideal. About the only other time I could see myself wanting this beer might be as a shady sipper on a hot summer day. Not a versatile beer, but quite pleasant at the right time, in limited quantity.","Brent","Feb 25, 2003"
3.53,-8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A brew from the rare beer store at realbeer.com. This one pours cherry red with a fizzy pink head that vanishes like one on a soda would.The aroma is very much like a sour cherry soda with a slight woodiness and cherry pits.It has a fizzy light body that holds tart cherry flavors and a little almond with not much in the way of malt.It finishes very dry.I feel that it probably would go well with some sweet/rich stews made with pork or chicken- it makes a better addition to food than as a stand-alone beer IMO.","jeffboo","Feb 20, 2003"

3.57,-7.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours an opalescent sanguineous color, the head fair in size, frothy in texture, but settles quite quickly, leaving a spindly lace behind. Nose is sweet and sour fruit, something like raspberries and ripe bananas, light hints of malt, and not unpleasant. Front is malt with a very light sweetness, but the sourness of a Flanders Red Ale hits the palate almost immediately. The top is cadaverous, the finish is caustic, meagerly hopped, the aftertaste bone-dry with a lingering sourness which is expected in this style. I must admit it is a bit thin, or better yet watery.","Gusler","0"
