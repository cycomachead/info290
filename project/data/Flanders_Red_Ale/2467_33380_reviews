"Sourness is nearly puckering and sharp; seems a bit immature, whereas I would imagine that with age, would become a much rounder flavor profile. I have to say that I might prefer this (like my women) young, tart and a bit immature.... however I'd also like to cellar a bottle for a time to see how/if she blossoms with age.  lol"

"This is weird, but perhaps not as weird as I expected. There are some nice sour and funky notes here, but it also tastes simultaneously too old and too young. Maybe this was not the best year. I might try this again."
"It's a soured version of the barrel it lived in. Could stand to dry out a little and pick up a bit more of a tart edge, but the base flavors are in there. Pick up a bottle and sit on it for a few years and it might be worth the sticker price."

"O: not bad coming from Italy... one of the more delicate, subdued examples of the style... obviously well made, but lacking life a little... reminded me most of a darker-tasting Rodenbach (Grand Cru)"

"The beer pours a gorgeous, muddled pink, almost like a fruited Berliner Weisse. It sits in the glass a regal, dark purple color with maroon and ruby hues. The beer pours with a head of miniscule, creamy white bubbles that form a pillow, and then quickly settles into a fat scrim around the beer. In body, the beer is dark and hazy, but clear of particles and cloudiness. On the nose, the beer smells of light vinegar, cherries, leather, and nearly vinous. Touches of grape and soft plum dance on the edges of the scent along with rich vanilla from the oak. The funky leather and cherry scents are earthy and rich with vinegar, which I adore, but they are also constrained and mellow. The nose of this beer revels in subtle complexity; it is funky, but not in a way that would kick your nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart with acidity, sweet with fruity malt, and bitter with oak tannin. The oak leaves a strange twinge to the pucker in your cheeks. The beer finishes dry and tannic. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet plum juice, tinged with tart cherry leather, this bulls head on into a wall of rich, oak tannin that blankets the middle of the sip, all but obliterating the fruity notes and bringing vanilla, earth and finally a touch of chocolate into play. Touches of grape juice and rich red wine can also be sensed in the start of the sip, while the finish is long and decadent with oak, vanilla, touches of tart grapes, and bitter herbal tannin. The aftertaste is hard to distinguish from the finish, as the beer has tremendous lasting power in the mouth. For all intents and purposes, the finish and the aftertaste are the same. In body, the beer is on the light side of medium, with a middling carbonation that gives a nice pillow to the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth, if a bit watery, providing superb drinkability until the beer hits the back of the palate. In the back, the tannin does touch with a quick bite of astringency, but this quickly fades to just leave a bit of tightness in the tongue. The mouth is left slightly dry, with just a touch of saliva oozing in to cancel the lingering acidity of the beer. Overall, this is yet another superb Flanders Red. This particular beer revels in the rich character it gained from unique Bordeaux cognac barrels. Admittedly, I have not drank a lot of cognac from Bordeaux (I thought Cognac could only be made in a region surrounding the town of Cognac?) but I think an experienced Cognac drinker would definitely find subtle hints within this beer reminiscent of that drink. This is a Flanders Red of subtle intrigue and beauty, like a fine red wine. It unfurled on my tongue like a puzzle, and I very much enjoyed that. My chief complaint with the beer comes from its thinness. I want my Flanders Reds to be medium bodied, and this one is just a little too far below this bench mark for me. It is superbly drinkable, but loses a little oomf. The beer’s tannic structure also allows it to grip the mouth quite nicely, and provides some amazing complexities, though it is a little too raw for my personal tastes. In the end though, it’s a great Flanders red."

"Overall a very good Flanders red ale; my only critique is that it might be a little one-dimensional, but it's still very enjoyable."
"Overall, very good, but maybe not outstanding enough to be excellent. It's fairly subtle, with good but not great depth. Very nice and worth drinking."
""

"Very good sour, made in Italy! The Italian beer scene has really made its mark and this is one offering that helps support that cause. Next time a wine drinker reaches for a pinot noir to go with a chicken or salmon dish, this could probably be swapped out. I'd also love to try this with sauerbraten."

"750 ml bottle, 2012 vintage, Batch #15, Bottle #1184. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like tart cherries, oak, green apples, funk and vinegar. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like tart cherries, grape juice, dark fruit, oak, green apples and vinegar. Even though it's mostly tart, there's some fruity sweetness noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating and is well carbonated. I think this is a good, tart, enjoyable brew. Definitely worth a try, I'll have to get another bottle to age and see how it turns out. $16.99 a bottle."
""
"Panil Barrique is a nice Flemish Red that crosses over into American Wild Ale territory. It has great sourness for the style, although it's not as sturdy as you might hope. Finishes cleaner and shorter. Actually, very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is not strong and not overpowered by the sour flavor. The oak aging is not as prevalent, just a hint. Overall, this is pretty tasty but mild. I would drink this again but it's not my go-to sour beer! Wish the flavors were bolder, as I think the oak aging would be fantastic. Batch #16, bottle 2505."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass; Bottle #1048, Batch #9, 2007 vintage. Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of sour cherry, green apple, red grape, pepper, clove, floral, oak, hay, red wine vinegar, funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast notes with moderate oak barrel presence. Taste of tart cherry, green apple, red grape, floral, clove, oak, hay, red wine vinegar, funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity and earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, green apple, red grape, clove, oak, floral, hay, red wine vinegar, funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity, tart, and earthy yeast ester flavors; with moderate malt, oak, and acidity; and a great sweetness/acidity balance with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Flanders red ale. All around nice balance and complexity of fruity, tart, and earthy yeast flavors with moderate malt and oak balance; and very smooth to sip on for 8% with the moderate acidity. A very enjoyable offering."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"O-not as tart as other Flemish reds which I prefer"
""
"O: pretty great example of a Flanders here. Adds its own unique touch as well. Would pick up again at some point in the future."
"Tried this a second time at Tipples Rare and Barrel Aged Beer Tasting on July 13, 2014. Like it much better this time. Still pretty ugly, but a nice sourness to go along with the sweet black cherry flavor, oak, and very nice sourness going on. Big chewy oak here intermingled with nice tart cherry fruits. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I like this beer its really solid to style with good flavors and easy to drink. That being said I defiantly want to see how it can develop with a few years on it as it was not very sour and a lot more juicy then tart. If it develops how I think it could it could make this beer a lot beer, but for now its good but tacking in some aspects especially in strength of taste though the feel is pretty good. I would recommend this is worth a try if you can get it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A different take on a Flemish red. The tartness seems very toned down by the extensive oak aging (Cognac barrels probably are the root cause). Still a nice and easy sipper, but not nearly as complex and bold as other reds."
""
""
"O-This brew is a winner. I like the oaky, subtle complexity of it all. There are beers with more pucker power and this beer clearly does not try to hit you over the head with acid. Instead, this one really shines in the use of oak to give an dry, earthy, complex tartness. A complex and drinkable example of the style."
"O - Overall this was a darn good Flanders red, which I was expecting it to be. Always see this in stores, glad I got to try it."
""
"I've increased my ""overall"" score by .25 to reflect what I feel is more accurate."
""
""
""
"O - Not as sour as some other beers in the category I've had. It's still well done and definitely delivers that lip puckering goodness that I sometimes crave."
"A good sized head atop a clear dark reddish brown fluid. Some nice lacing and a light covering. Smell is vinegar and and oak with a healthy funk and and light fruit component. Some oaked alcohol with faint vanilla lightly showing. Taste is vinegar and malt sweetness. Oak and cherries that really come into balance as they warm. Vanilla and cherries with a grape blend. Dry woody finish that leaves a tart sourness lingering. Juiciness leaves the mouth dripping with saliva, Nice dry feel with a good carbonation that gives a velvety drinkability. A good solid Flanders Red with a complex construction."
""
"Batch 15-2012, bottle 265"
""
""
""
"Batch #12. 2010. Bottle #1057. Served in a wine glass. Pours a fairly-clear reddish-mahogany color with a good white head that fades relatively quickly before falling to a thin cap. The nose brings a nice acidity and underlying red fruits plus a bit of oak and lactic acidity. Flavor pushes those components a bit further, but also has an underlying tannic graininess that detracts a bit, especially from the mouthfeel. Not a bad beer by any means, though I preferred the nose to the flavor/palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Impressively complex. A good blend of tart red fruits, barrel aged mustiness, and sweet brown ale. Good to age, this could have lasted even longer. Cheers."
""
"Dark red is the color, and surprising great lace is just a bonus feature of this beer. I expected the jose to be along thelines of this; sour and tart. A lot like strawberries in this case, and a little oomph of sour. A little less sour and a little more sweet is the taste, which is strawberry sweet. Modest sourness, not mouth puckering. Medium bodied beer that finds itself getting a little light in places, yet overall providing the excitement of a good Flanders Red."
""
""
""
"While in the vein of Rodenbach, I strongly endorse this Flemish sour as a worthwhile comparison. While intensely sour, the beer offers a more restrained complexity than that of Rodenbach but also exchanges some variations when compared to Duchesse du Burgogne and Bacchus. It's worth seeking out for all fans of sour ales."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some fruit, vinegar, and woody aromas. Taste is much the same an acidic finish with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice sour. Uneventful, but tasty. Not worth the money though. Silly prices on Italian beers."
"Pours a vibrant amber color with an 1"" off white head that dissolves quickly. The aroma is tart with a heavy dark fruit aroma ( cherry and fig most notably). The taste is pleasing, although not living up to the tartness I was getting in the aroma. Once again, dark fruit with an acidity similar to a balsamic vinegar. The oak was balanced very well, not overpowering by any means. Good carbonation and pretty dry. Certainly a very good beer but I felt the price tag to be a little high."
""
"Note: Batch #14, 2011"
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is acidic with mild alcohok inclusion that evolves as it warms. Quite a nice sipper. The flanders style sometimes is not my favorite when there is a huge cider/vinegar presence. This one however was quite nice. I would have gladly taken multiple pours of this and would certainly pick this up if i found it with a decent pricetag."
""
"I have been eyeing this one up for some time now but the price tag always steered me away. Good but not worth the $20 price."
""
""
"D: good, not great. very horsey. not sure if more time would help here..."
"batch number 14, bottle 635. a real well made sour. pours thin semitransparent brown with a smallish off white head that leaves nice lacing. smells like brett and bourbon, with some malty sweet backing and hints of dried fruit. flavor is similar, not overwhelmingly sour, but fairly strong in that regard. sour cherries and oak flavors are quite strong as well. alcohol is totally hidden from the flavor. aftertaste is both sweet and tart, really nice and complex brew. feel is good, middle of the road carbonation and a drinkable medium body. this is an excellent beer, but is it worth 20bucks a go? id have to say no. the price will keep me from drinking this again, but i sure am glad i tried it."
""
""
""
"O: Not a fan... Too much roastiness. Not completely awful, but far too expensive to be on the low side of mediocre."
"It is pretty expensive, but I don't think it is worth it. The Duchesse is way better, so is La Folie."
""
""
"This is a real nice, very well balanced sour."
"O: not a huge fan of the flabor profile here. the mouthfeel is pretty good though."
"o - Overall a good beer. Would put it right under the Italy version due to the lack of carbonation. Nice and sour, definitely worth checking out."
"Batch #14/2011/Bottle 2288. Pours a murky, dark, reddish brown color. Medium white, fluffy head that diminishes quickly. Scent is quite lovely. Cherries and dark fruits with a nice amount of oak. A bit of sour funk and red wine vinegar. More oak. Taste is a lot better than I was expecting. From reading some of the reviews, I have always passed this beer up. Right now I'm kinda wondering why...it is quite the treat. Immediately I get wooden oak flavors...like literally licking a piece of oak wood or something...which instantly changes to tart cherries and blackberries. Just a slight off-putting metallic flavor, but it comes and goes, so not really detrimental to the overall taste. I could see why people say this beer is somewhat watery...but I think it's just more balanced and oak forward than a lot of sours we get here in the states. Could have something to do with the cognac barrels this is aged in, as I do get some alcohol flavors lingering on the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is light-medium and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a tasty beer. Not as sour as I tend to like my sour beers, but the oak flavor is great!"
""
"Overall - I was built up on the appearance and smell and was disappointed by the taste/mouthfeel."
"Taste is a bit odd, sour and a bit vinegary, but also earthy. Mouthfeel is big and very carbonated. Finish is sour and tart. Overall it's decent but not too special."
"O: This beer is very soft on the palate and thoroughly enjoyed. I'd like a bit more sourness to come thru, but all-in-all a pretty okay beer."

"(D)- Overall, tasty and fun to try, though I think it is a bit young and oaky I think. Looking forward to revisiting this in a year or two."
""
"A very nice red sour, and quite the surprise. My first beer from Italy is a hit!"
"O: Bellissima birra. Balanced in all senses. Refreshing and, at the same time sour and tasty"
"O - This is a very tasty Flanders Red Ale. Pricey but good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a very easy beer to drink, but not all that impressive. Maybe a more current vintage would change things a bit but the flavors seem quite mellow compared to my expectations after reading the detailed description and the elevated price tag. A good beer, but not worth the outlay of 20-plus dollars. Wll not be revisiting anytime soon or will I recommend it if asked."
"O - Not bad, not great. For the pricetag I will pass on this in the future, unless I here newer vintages are significantly better."
""
""
""
""
"O: I can appreciate the style, but flanders red ales are definitely not my favorite."
"Bottle. Batch 12, 2010, bottle 796. Pours. Murky reddish mahagony color with a light white head. Cherry, acetone, and slight oak, ligh mouthfeel with carbonation. Sweet and tart start with a nice fruitiness to it. Not overly sour by any means. Ends with a slight tartness with a little bitterness. Overall, not bad but a little sweet."
"Overall Impression- This was a REALLY great sour. My first from Italy, it was very pleasant with nice complexity. I would turn people to this one for a Flanders Red but wouldn't have for myself again... Too many more out there to try!"
"O: Really wish this had more body to hold it. Great sourness though. Makes it a really tasty beer."
"Drinking this sour thanks to a buddy of mine. This is a great tasting sour. It has a funky malt vinegar smell to it. It pours a purplish/red-brown color. The taste is very refreshing. Right away I get an apple/malt vinegar taste and then its followed by a sweet/tart sourness. This would be an awesome sour to drink all summer long."
"Drink- It was okay, didn't blow me away but was still pretty solid."
"Pours a light reddish brown. a nice bit of white head. Very pretty. Smells wonderful. Tart and sour. A nice sweetness compliments well. Smells oaky as well. Tastes sweet and fruity. Raisons and tart cherries. Some oxidation perhaps. The fruitiness is quite wonderful. A very enjoyable beer"
"D. Very drinkable with nice tartness. Drank well on the front porch on an Ohio night."
"Drink (3/5) - I'm not hugely experienced with this style and I'd love to compare it. It was certainly an interesting taste for a beer lover, but not something I'd imagine you'd want to have as a session."
"I corked the bottle with maybe 5oz left to try with a dessert tonight. I don't know how it will hold up over 20ish hours with the top off, but I'm willing to risk it to pair it with some sweets."
"Good all around. Not mind-blowing but enjoyable through and through."
"Reminds me of a lambic with a very nice fruit bouquet. Not as acetic as some Flanders. Solid and worth trying at least once."
"O: at 18 bucks a bottle, it's a bit steep, but a fine example of a sour ale."
"O/D - Good. Quite nice and very smooth. Not a trace of alcohol and good to sip and explore while being complex and tasty."
"Murky brown, ruby notes in the light, nice white head, some light lacing on the glass. Smell is of sour grape, tart, wine like, yeasty and some barn like notes. Taste is sour, tart, ripe cherry, yeasty, nice oaky presence, lightly salty....the oak makes this quite lush. Light to medium weight, good carbonation, nice feel, chalky feel in the finish. I really enjoyed this and I knocked off the 750ml no problem, glad I picked up a few of these."
"o - damn man, for 20 bucks a bottle i dont think i could do it again. certainly nothing to write home about although i would try it on tap if i ever had the chance. theres always next time.."
"Nuanced feel of a dab of cinnamon to it, could just be the wood. Price is a tough part, $18 for a bottle, have to knock its overall score down a tad because you could have 2 bottles of Le Terroir or Dissident almost for this price."
"D- For a sour it's extremely drinkable. It has a lot of character I struggle to describe, but it's also pretty simple and smooth at the same time. The only alcohol presence I really found was that it was a bit hard on my stomach. Aside from that it was nearly impossible to detect."
"D: I find the acidity is balanced enough with the tart fruits to make this quite drinkable. This would be great to sip and enjoy on a patio in the spring or summer. Glad I tried this."
"O: A great version of the Flanders Red style. My only real complaint is the ridiculous price tag."
"Leave it to the Italians to save a unique, traditional, distinctly artisanal and near-extinct gastronomic treasure. Somewhere Carlos Petrini and Slow Food is proud. After all, Italians didn't earn their reputation as discerning gourmands and sensual hedonists for no good reason. This is a masterful ale that is well worth whatever the asking price. Recommended."
"O: Disappointing sour ... one dimensional funk, not enough soul."
"O - A good beer. A style that I am new to and am developing a taste for. This one was good for someone who is new to sours like me."
"Overall, I was really impressed with this beer. I'm typically not a huge fan of Flanders, but this one is done very well. Exceptionally smooth throughout. Right up there with the Rodenbach offerings. I could drink this all day. I highly recommend picking up a bottle if you see it."
"Overall a great sour, but you have to dig the style to appreciate it. Pricey at $14. But easy drinking; I polished off an entire bottle and I could easily have another."
"Incredibly drinkable and balanced for a sour, could easily finish a 750 (I did), the ABV is nowhere to be seen. Wish this hadn't disappeared in the LCBO so quickly, it's not everyday there is a sour available at your local LCBO!"
"Well hot-damn! Those Italians made something that I actually like (kidding the Italians make lots of stuff I like :) This beer is tasty, approachable, sour and overall just delicious. I would suggest this beer to anyone who says they don't like beer but claims to like champagne. It's just a great thing really."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good for the style."
"Drinkability is surprisingly decent. I'm not a lover of things sour but this has some appeal. Not sure I'd drink them back to back mind you."
"I'm glad the LCBO in Ontario brought in a real sour. Pours a murky amber-brown colour with huge white head. Lots of lacing covers the glass, great head retention. Smells of oak, apple, with some fruity vinegar. Very sour flavour, I wasn't expecting it this sour for some reason, but quite nice. There is still a lot of sweetness too. Great carbonation level on this. I plan to buy a few more bottles before this runs out!"
"This was a pretty beautiful beer. Not quite as sour as I had expected but certinally as dry and oaky, very wine like. There was a little bit of vinegar like flavor but the gorgeous eartiness saved it indeed. Throw in some fruit flavors like cherry perhaps a little plum and you've got it. This was great."
"D - This is a very drinkable sour beer. It is not astringent or excessively ""barnyardy"". It has a nicely balanced fruitiness and sourness with some wood-aged complexity. Hides the alcohol well."
"Oh, by the way, this is an '09. Expensive, but I say worth the odd purchase every now and again."
"Drinkability: At 8%, I could drink this entire bottle very comfortably. Easy to drink."
"Tasty sour ale, - I would like to try a more 'fresh' example as this was a 2007 release. Batch #8 bottle 1779."
"Very nice."
"had it again... vintage 2005 bottle in the summer of 2011... a exceptional flemish red. intense wet saddle leather saltiness... tart of balsamic vinegar, cherries, tobacco and tannins that i've only come across in wine. excellent."
"As I would assume this beer pours a nice garnet red color with a finger of off white foam. The smell is raspberries, strawberries, and sour oak. Since I know that was the intent of this beer to smell like that I will give it the benefit of the doubt, though I must say candidly it really was not my favorite. The sour oak flavor comes through even stronger in the taste. The fruit characteristics are still there, but instead this is a bit more intense and souring on the tongue. Again this from what I've been told is by design. Aside from the sourness the mouthfeel was syrupy but fairly close to the target. As far as drinkability it's pretty easy going for a beer, but due to my opposition to the taste I have a large problem rating it any higher than I am. I won't drink it again, I'm sure it's good for those who love sours."
"2009 vintage, batch #11, bottle #268, from my beer-of-the-month club. It pours a murky amber that heads toward brown in the center, all topped by a finger of off-ecru foam. The nose comprises funky red grapes, moss, kale, cardamom, and lemon wedge. The taste follows this path, along with some oak and sour blue raspberry, which all then tapers into some sweet blueberry and black grape in the end. The body is a solid medium, with a light carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a decent sour brew, though nothing entirely exciting or great. Nice to experiment with, though."
"Drinkability: At 8% you would never know it but by the end of the bottle my body sure did. Very drinkable."
"D: Not a good example of the style. Would not recommend it. On the plus side, the 8% ABV is nearly imperceptible."
"Drinkability: I split the bottle with two other people, though they weren't enormous fans of this beer either. I don't know that I'd pick it up again, though I would love to try this again if someone else was cracking it open."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: If you like a sour ale, it's huge. If you don't like a sour ale, try this one; you'll probably like it. I'm not sure what a good pairing would be - stinky cheeses, perhaps - but at 8% you'd better pair it with something."
"Final note, the tobacco notes are similar but much more muted and nuanced than the flavors I found from Haandbryggeriet's Akevitt-Aged Porter. A very distinct flavor."
"If you enjoy the style, you must try this beer. I don't think this is actually the only unpasteurized traditional brewed Flanders Red, but it does have a singular subtlety among its peers."
"I have a habit of trying the top beer in a style or grouping with the first one I get. The first kriek I ever drank was Cantillon and everything else paled in comparison. I may have done it again with Italian craft beers. This is my first and if this isn't the best then what is yet to come should be magnifico! Oh how I wish had some prosciutto and mozzarella to go with this."
"overall - aaah, ok, now I get why people like sours. This was my first real sour experience, and I'm loving it."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, mild kick, decent representation of style. The mouthfeel was a bit off for me, as it became extremely watery in the finish."
"D - Not my favorite sour, but pretty drinkable at 8%."
"- Very good sour... impressed. I love the style, and am glad I tried this one.. certainly spot on and delicious. I let it warm up a bit, and poured into a fitting glass."
"D: Pretty easy beer to drink, but not all that impressive. Maybe a more current vintage would change things a bit."
"I had this from a 750ml bottle, 2009 batch #11, bottle # 876...The beer pours a dark mahogany, light tan head, ok lacing...The aroma is light a little sour and vinegar, same with the taste but this beer is severly lacking to other great flanders. Lightly tart but not enough punch or vinegar. Really kind of boring and disappointing. Maybe a good flanders red for the beginner."
"Notes: Batch #8 (2007 Vintage), Bottle #2680"
"D - A definite sipper... Complex with some distinct red wine like qualities... Loaded with complexity... A bottle with exploring and sharing... However, I'm not sure it's a must try, especially given a fairly high price point..."
"D - Drinkability is decent. That is about all that can be said for this one. The flavors seem to work well together even without any suds. The combination of oak, fruit, and earthiness is done pretty well. A 750 ml bottle is no problem in one setting but I'd like to see some changes made before trying my hand at this one again."
"Panil Barriquee is a rather big disappointment for me. I was excited about this one, and held on to the bottle for quite a while. Maybe it diminished in that period of time. The biggest problems are the lack of flavor, the medicinal taste, and the lack of bubbles. Fix those things and it'd be all the better for it. Can't recommend it at this point. I don't recall exactly what I paid for this, but whatever it was...it was too much."
"I'll gladly try it again, but it's not at the top of my sours list."
"Drinkin from a Satan glass"
"Though soaked in casks formerly used for cognac and wine, I note that it is considered kosher because there is no real wine, it's not considered the actual flavour by the science of kashruth. I had previously spoken to the head of the most senior inspector in Canada about this and I can pass on details if anyone is inetrested."
"Definitely worth the purchase."
"D - This is a superb brew, especially at this age. I have had fresher samples, two years old, and they are not quite on this level yet."
"D: I'm always thankful to try a beer I haven't had, but now I know I don't need to purchase this one or seek it out."
"Pours a wonderful deep ruby with an off white head, super retention and some tight lacing. Light sour aroma, oaky, fruity. Mild musty basement in the background. Lovely vinuous quality to the flavor, almost dry but not totaly dry, tasty berry fruit flavors, pleasantly tart but not sour. Drinks easier than some other of the style. Great beer enjoyed it a lot but don't know if I could put down more then a 750ml. One thing is for sure, best sour red I have had."
"D- Noth the best sour red ale I've had but very good. Surprised Italians made such a beer."
"Great stuff in an evening of sampling some classic sour ales. This one poured with a nice off white fine head and some lace. Color is a copper amber. Aroma is floral, berry, yeast, malt. Flavor is similar and rich. Body is full and round. Body is outstanding and so is carbonation. Finish is like the flavor. Lots of character yet easy drinking, pleasant. A masterpiece. Perhaps a session for sipping."
"So, there were a lot of strong opinions about this beer at the tasting but I really enjoyed it. Beer is kind of sweet at first, strong funk in the middle palate of the mouth, alcohol flavor and it finishes slightly dry with a woodsey aftertaste. Its better than most thought but its not my favorite. I would drink it again."
"drinkability: I thought this was going to be mind blowing sour after 5 years. no more than a rodenbach clssic. but a very good sour."
"D: A bit disappointed... I had hoped for a nice, complex brew - tart, crisp, dry, with the added oak notes to kick it up a notch. Price was a little high considering the product (~$17). Perhaps a newer vintage would be more to my liking, and if I see one, I'd be willing to give it another shot. Until then, though, I'm not too convinced."
"D - the smells are headed in the right general ballpark, and even the flavor isn't terrible per se. Also quite drinkable in a literal sense; the 8% booze is well hidden. But still a big disappointment."
"Pretty drinkable. Probably the best Italian beer I've had, not that that is saying too much."
"Batch #8 2007 $16 750ml. Dark red like a flanders should be. Smells quite good at first, funky, complex, yeasty, almost like lambic or gueuze. the flavor is nice, sour, woody, pretty nice without beating you over the head with sourness or vinegar. The only drawback is that this beer is way too thin, the alcohol is not noticeable but it still feels a little watery."
"D: On the more mild side of the style, darn drinkable."
"D: Easy to drink due to mild funk and no carbonation. Actually, I missed the carbonation. It does have some booze in the background and I think it could use a little more age."
"Batch #10 Riserva 2008. 750ml bottle. Bottle conditioned. Served in the second gen. Boulevard Chalice. Poured a dark reddish brown with little head. There was very little carbonation to this. Fruity aroma with some cherry. Slightly tart cherry flavor, some sweetness. Light bodied. Bit of oak in the finish. Also a little sharpness in the finish. Flavor improved as it opened up a bit, but I was a little disappointed with this."
"light and champaigny. refreshing. to be honest i can't really tell that it's oak-aged. perhaps oaky vanilla just doesn't adhere itself to this style, or perhaps i would notice if i had an unoaked batch to compare"
"Solid drinkability. No idea that this guy is 8% ABV. A surprisingly quaffable sour."
"D: While the beer smells and tastes nice, the thin watery mouthfeel just doesn't do it for me and really negatively affects the beer. Still a pleasant experience overall but not something I would necessarily choose again unless I knew the thinness and severe lack of carbonation was a fluke of this particular bottle."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a small, bubbly light tan head that was gone quickly, falling to some medium sized bubbles and no lacing. Aroma is full of buttery oak, acidic, some notes of cherries, apple skins, light citrus, some mustiness, Belgian yeast, and a touch of vinegar. Flavor is dry and tart. Cherries are the most predominant of the fruit character, but it's a tart cherry flavor and yet not completely sour. A little bit of caramel and brown sugar lie deep in the back of the flavor profile, but it's there only momentarily until the dry, tannic tartness washes it away. Oak is not as noticeable on the tonuge as it is in the nose, but it is there, and adds a nice touch. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, on the medium-light side, and the warming alcohol is noticeable on the finish. Not as refreshing as most Flemish Red's I've had. It's definitely a sipper, especially at 8% ABV. This is pairing nicely with the beef stew I'm enjoying at the moment, as the acidity is cutting nicely across the savory beef, herbs, and spices."
"The only problem is that it's a little expensive."
"Overall: This beer would be better carbonated. i dont know what went wrong. Other than that, it is pretty good though."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, minus the price tag, all in all, a decent sour beer, but comes up lacking in the nose and in the mouth. All the right things are there, but just not quite strong enough. Fair amount of good flavors, but there are better examples. Entirely too expensive for what you get in the bottle."
"D- I enjoyed it but am glad I shared the bottle, A 750 of this would be a bit much for me. A good beer that I always enjoy but won't go out of my way for all the time."
"The mouthfeel is a bit watery at time and the flavor dropped off quicker then I anticipated."
"The beer is medium bodied with low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel."
"D - Good presentation of balance, if that can be said of Flanders Red."
"An interesting beer none the less."
"light, almost watery, but overall surprisingly smooth, punctuated by acidic and tannic notes, plus spritzy yet mild carbonation, giving texture and flavor lift."
"Pours out red, almost brown, with a dense yellow/off-white head, leaving n ice lacing and having some decent retention. I'm really impressed, looks much better than I'd expect. The smell is a very deep and light funk. Not very strong, and just a bit less than I expected. This one comes out with a bit off sourness, quite a lot of tartness, and a pleasant sweetness. This one reminds me a bit more of beer than the average Flanders Red. Has notes of raisin, chocolate, caramel, and a tiny bit of breadiness. The sourness comes off first like sour candy, then comes in with lime juice, and finishes with a bit of woody sweetness. I like it. I've had a few which are more impressive, and I may be a sour hound, loving every one I taste, but I think it's got everything it takes, but not the wow factor. The carbonation is just perfect, pleasant great. The body is quite full. Moreso than I expected, and it almost feels warm at 50ish degrees. Very nice I'd say. This one goes down very pleasantly, not too bold, but has a high enough ABV to get at you. I'd recommend it to anyone - especially if you can afford it."
"Pours out a pretty dark color for the style. It is brown with ruby hints coming through the edges. There is no head at all, but that could be due to the gentle pour. The aroma is of oak, cherries, and alcohol. A definitely tart qualities shocks the nose as well. The taste is very sour with notes of oak and maybe some sugar. Glad I wad able to try it...love that Italians are starting to make some awesome beers"
"D. Not a bad sipping drink. I enjoyed it for sure."
"D - I'm not going to entirely rule out drinking this beer again, but I'd only consider a fresh one."
"Massively quenching."
"batch #9, 2007, bottle#860. the reviews for this beer are sort of all over the place. i love flanders style reds, and i rather love this interpretation. masterfully crafted, silky smooth, lightly carbonated, just the right amount of oak... a true delight. a lot of oak in the nose, which is on the slightly faint side, but the taste comes out nicely balanced with all the proper cherry, lemon, plum and sour vinegarish flavors of a great FRA. this was a real treat. bacon is the new vegetarian, 40 is the new 20, and italy is the new belgium."
"(3.2/5)"
"Mouthfeel is kind of plain. The lack of effervescents make this a slow go. Still a good beer."
"A light tan two finger head is short lived leaving just a skim and no lace. Body is a deep brown with ruby hints as light brings out the colors on the edges. Nose is decisevely tart with tones of sour cherries, crisp raspberry and powdery candy. There is an initial sour feel on first sip but it is quickly mellowed. There are crisp apple notes that are quite green. They mix with some mineral based rocky notes that add nice balance. Not quite as complex and dynamic as some other sour brews but very good. Mouthfeel longs for the next sip with a dry sour based thickness on the back of the tongue. A very nicely drinkable sour ale."
"Bottle shared with fisherman34- thanks Kris! Pours a hazy off red with fluffy long lasting white head. Nose- very earthy, wood, light cherry. Taste- tart cherry, green apple, very dusty and earthy. Medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Finishes thicker than most sours. Nice stuff"
"D: I have been eying this beer for about a year and a half and finally gave in and bought it. This was a really nice beer. A good mix of sour and the barrel. Time has mellowed this I think. It has an interesting and complex taste. Recommended."
"2007 Batch 8 bottle 1222. Pours amber with a light white head that fades quickly to a ring aroung the outside of the glass. Aroma is tart, lambic, slight wood and funk. Flavor is smooth, some sour but not overwhelming. Vinigar stronger than lactic in this sour. I like it better the other way around but still a solid sour. Carbonation is weak but not flat. Finish is dry, would like to see more lactic and a more dry finish."
"it pours up a reddish brown color with almost no head at all. the nose is dark malts, red grapes, subtle chocolate notes, sour aroma. the taste is chocolatey for sure, sourness, sweet malts. its a sour fruit and chocolate malt fusion in my mouth! its like liquid truffle! very good"
"2006 vintage. Perhaps my first Italian beer, this poured a muddy mahogany with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like a blend of cabernet grapes, oak, apple cider and mulled spices, and some citrus hops. It tasted like leathery and oaky malt, tart grape/wine hops, and spicy apple cider. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting tart aftertaste. Overall this was half beer, half wine, and all delicious. It had a great, unique flavor that was intricate, clean and drinkable."
"The only thing that could be improved is the bottle, it does not do the beer justice."
"Overall: One of the most unique beers I have ever had and truly a standout in the style, id like to try a younger bottle and compare. Not as sour as RGC but still very tasty and very very complex. Great cheese beer. If you like the style and dont mind the price tag, this is a must buy"
"Note: Review transferred from the other listing for this beer, as the bottle I consumed looks like this bottle and not the bottle pictured in the other listing."
"It nails the style, and tastes great. The fact that it's from Italy makes it even more the appealing brew. A real treat!"
"D: Can't really notice any alcoholic presence, so it's obviously masked really well from the sour fruitiness and probably partly due to smoothing out from the aging. For a sour, this is pretty drinkable. Cost is the only thing preventing you from going nuts."
"2007, 750ml bottle at SD Toronado and at a pretty good price. Outstanding sour. Shows the barrel aging with the texture and hints of vanilla. Dark cola color. Refreshing brew, bring acidity and citrus aromas. Dosn't taste like it looks. Kind of approaches a Lou Pepe but not quite. Would recommend this to sour beer drinkers and the best Italian brew I've ever had!"
"Bottled in 2006, and by this time it is quite flat, but also still quite sour. Pours perfectly still, with no head at all, and a cherry red in color tinged with brown. Softly acetic and richly fruity with sour cherry and plum and even a bit of mango, and a touch of spice at the end. More than any other beer I've ever had this tastes more like a wine than a beer. Gently sour and with full on cherry and earth ponot noir flavors with some lemon and spicebox notes. Highly unusual to say the least. There are also some gentle tannins on the finish. Mouthfeel is tart and smooth. I'm totally sure I like this, but it is interesting. reading the other reviews most seem to have carbonated versions and I think I'd probably like that better."
"D: I like this a lot and could drink a lot of it."
"'07 bottle Pours a ruby color with mild offwhite head. Smell is oaky and sour cherry. Taste is mainly the same two flavors as in the nose with no real offensive funkiness at all. Still tart and some vinegar qualities, but one of the more drinkable sours that I've had, for sure. Nice as far as sours go, overall I thought, but still not my cup of tea."
"I'd drink it again, but in terms of bang for the buck, either of the Rodenbachs is a better deal. But this is a fair sub if you can't find them."
"Flemish Red Ales are my true favorite style, but Panil is not my favorite Flemish Red. It is growing on me as it settles, but I much prefer Duchesse, Rodenbach, and Monk's over this. It pours a hazy deep amber with plenty of haze, head, lacing, and retention. The smell is typical of the style, albeit with a less pronounced vinous aroma. The taste is where things wildly diverge. This ale is a bit too vinegary, not nearly mouth puckering sourish enough, not nearly as candied cherry tart flavored, and a bit too watery and carbonated. I'm obviously very particular in what I prefer in the style, and this beer doesn't measure up nearly enough as I would have liked. It is also quite expensive. I'm warming up to it though, and I'm not panning the beer by any measure. I just feel that if you want the real deal, go to the Belgian font and experience true heaven in a bottle, rather than an Italian imitation. As the beer settles in, there is less vinegar, more complex flavors emerging, but it is lacking the explosion on the palate that you'll find in other beers of the style."
"Tart, brown sugar fruitiness, mild horseblanket, some cherry, apple, grape maybe. More tart than funk, but much more funky than something like Duchesse."
"Notes: Hmmm a tough one here. Pros: Depth of flavor with interesting twists. Cons: Mouthfeel is dead and the beer looks lifeless. I'll take flavor and bumb this up to a solid above average offering."
"D: Goes down incredibly smooth. Drinks very vinously in nature with an incredibly drinkability finishing with a nice carbonation bite."
"Pours a hazy brown/ deep amber color with a white head. In the aroma, sour dark cherries and white grape-ish. In the taste, small sour dark fruit, mostly cherry. A medium smooth and small sour mouthfeel and a dry sour fruitiness (cherry) in the aftetaste. Sour in the nose and in the aftertaste, yet not overly sour in the taste, and very wine-ish."
"Pours an almost completely flat ruby red with next to no head. Very strong sour nose of sour cherry and sour fruit. Taste is a very vinous sour fruit flavor. Goes down like wine as it is almost completely flat. This is a fantastic sour red, aged in oak, and is strongly recommended for a red wine substitute. Drinkability is nice, but the flatness will turn away many beer fans. Great brew."
"Pours a very dark brown amber. Looks ruby tinted when held to light. Nose is mild cherry woods. Stays consistent and never waivers. Flavor is mildy sour. Mild wood character. Really; mild is the key word here. Feel is thick a bit on the liquid and good on the bubble. Overall pretty drinkable. Seems a bit rough around the edges (though it isn't much really). Definitely a very good version of the style, but not the absolute greatest. This might be a good introductory beer for newcomers to the style."
"D: This is not my style so I found it hard to enjoy and doubt I will indulge again. It was too reminicent of dry white wine for my taste."
"Drinkability- Despite is thin nature, it's got a good light sour taste and is pretty drinkable. The alcohol hits towards the finish."
"Drinkability was good but not great. I have had better sour beers, but this one was good. Glad I got a chance to try it, but won't be rushing out for more, as after tax it was around $20"
"This is truly a special ale. Bottled in 2005, Barrique poured a deep, cloudy and unfiltered red / brown (like dark raspberries), into a small wine glass. After a vigorous pour a half inch of smooth head formed and some gorgeous lacing remained as the glass emptied. A wonderful presentation all in all. Sour grape and wine-like aromas predominated with an accent of sweet malt. After the initial sour shock on the taste buds, this Panil turned out to be quite well balanced, with enough malt presence and even some tasty hop bitterness in the far background. Very subtle taste; a connoisseurs beer. A distinctly red wine-like mouth feel and flavor predominates. I found it to be extremely drinkable and I highly recommend it as a choice for pairing with food. It was absolutely perfect with the porterhouse steak I just ate. One of the best Ive had in recent months."
"'06 Vintage. I was so loking forward to drinking this beer, however I was underimpressed. I was ready for a big sour aroma. It didn't happen. Not much sour and not much oak. Virtually zero head. Really kind of a bland beer. I don't think I even finished the bottle. I have a feeling that I didn't get a representative bottle. I bought this at Green's on Buford this past spring. I'd like to try a fresh bottle as I love this style of beer."
"D - The aroma of this beer is fantastic, but the flavor doesn't quite match. It is extremely refreshing with what I would consider a high level of acidity, even for the style, but it is a little too acetic for my taste. The oak character is also too assertive, or at least too coarse and woody for me. On the plus side, it has a great, complex earthiness, especially in the nose, and the roasted notes in the finish are an unusual and interesting touch. Overall, it is quite a good beer, but at nearly twice the price of Rodenbach Grand Cru it should be even better."
"Drinkability is good as far as the beer itself is concerned, but not so good with respect to the price. This is pretty expensive stuff, so it's for sipping or special occasions only."
"Cheers"
"Drinkable, but this will be my last Barriquee unless I can find the other version."
"Because of its thin body and light sourness, this is actually significantly more drinkable than most Flanders Reds I've tried previously. All in all, quite nice, and something I'd be willing to share with a friend.... but probably not something I will seek out for $19 again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fizzy up front but mellowing out, light funk, low acid, and apple lingering."
"Originally reviewed on November 28, 2006. 2005. Aroma lightly bold of cloying syrup and sweet aromatic brett sugars, more wild sourness and acerbic grape skins. Deep oaky mahogany pour, with a faint oliy slick of ivory. Flavors are subtle and breezy, honed well and designed with balance in mine. Independent bold and unique. First full of bright fruity cherry-skin aroma, followed by long sweet, lightly caramelized malts. So perceptively balance, and moving. Stewed apple amongst mixed coarse Indian spices in ghee. The cognac shines through and mellows with sweet alcohol notes. Graceful, delicate and well balanced. Refined."
"Bottle: Poured a light beige color ale with a huge foamy head with perfect retention and lacing. Aroma is sour with some tart and oak and is also reminiscent of lambic but maybe a tad lighter. Taste is a mix between some sourness; tart some subtle oak with a long dry finish. I would probably have liked more sourness overall but I thought this was still very enjoyable. Carbonation is very lively and body is quite full with minimum filtration. I am now very curious to taste their other offering."
