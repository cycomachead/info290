"Reddish brown with a ring of off-white head. Well carbonated. Light vinegar and dark fruit on the nose. Plums and raisins make their way from the aromas to the flavors. Nice and tart. Seems a 'lighter' version of the Grand Cru, and appropriately so. Definitely more of a regular treat than the granddaddy. Delicious."

"Średnio wysycone, z dobrze ukrytym alkoholem. Idealny trunek do sytych obiadów. To piwo to kolejny belgijski klasyk i choć są inne, być może lepsze wariacje tego stylu, to Rodenbach jest jeden."
""
"This is a good option to enjoy while decompressing, as it is refreshing and cleansing."

"Had this at the Pig & Fiddle on tap. The nose is big fruit, citrus, plum and cherry with tartness and traces of funk. It pours brilliant deep cherry red with a thin film of a cap. The palate is tart, lemony, fruit, plum and cherry. The texture is exquisite and rich with a good balance between sweet and sour."
""
""
""
"Overall: Save the second half of the bottle for the next day, still a bit carbonated. I for sure liked the Grand Cru more, but this beer was still excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really liked this beer a lot, loves me some sours!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a good entry level ale for those who are new to the Belgian sours. Very mild, highly drinkable. slight malt vinegar taste and smell."
"Overall: A pretty good sour for someone who has little sour experience. Like how accessible it is. Very drinkable, and light on the sourness"

"Glass- Snifter"
"It was ok but not my favorite. I had two others in similar style. I prefer the lighter colored Flemish ales. Birthday gift from garys in basking ridge"
"In my opinion, this is the standard by which all Flemish reds should be judged.  Tart and perfectly balanced.  I don't like to pay for it, but I love to drink it."

"Ruby red in color, head has good retention. Vinegar odor. Taste sour cherry, red-wine vinegar, light carbonation. Finishes dry. This beer has grows on me each time I revisit it"
""
"Did a blind side by side with Half Pints' Old Red Barn. Half Pint's was far and away the winner.  Rodenbach was cloudy with a distinctly artificial cherry note and not much sourness. Muddled compared to their modern local contemporary..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Way too old. I'll have to re-review this when I have it fresher."

"Nice balance between sweet and sour, with hints of cherries and red wine. The aroma also reveals subtle caramel flavours. A fine example of an underrated beerstyle."

"refreshing and tangy, with a fluctuating (im pretty sure), but well hidden abv. one of the original examples of the style in my opinion, one of the best. dark red color to it and a lively tan head with excellent lace and retention. it smells puckery but more on the vinegar side of lacto than the citric side, which is fine in this instance because its balanced by sweeter amber malt and a nice buttery nutty front end that only eventually and reluctantly gives way to the acidity. clean and bright in feel though, shaking its weighty start and finishing really quite expressive and delicate for what it is. way more drinkable than the grand cru, with notes of dried fruit and molasses still in this one, but its so much more approachable, especially for the uninitiated. top quality stuff, but everything from rodenbach is."

"I'm really crazy about the Grand Cru so thought to give the Red classic a try.  Some barnyard/earthy scents.  Also a touch of sulfur scents.  Flavor is tart yet malty.  Kinda simple and not much complexity.  Not the most flavorful of the Flanders Red style but still an ok option for reasonable price.  Not really interested in buying again."

"Bought this on clearance for $1. Thinking it is pretty old. Poured dark like a Coke. Aroma is slightly boozy with some apple fruitiness. Mild flavor. It has a sharp bite on the tip of the tongue, followed by some apple flavors. Actually taste pretty good. Not sure what it would taste fresh, but not bad old."
""
""
"Almost like a fruit soda pop. Smell like sweet malts taste like esters from the yeast. The hop presence for me was non existent. There is a slight acidic twang. Very enjoyable and very different from what I expected. The beer is complex and highly drinkable."
"Pours a very dark but mostly clear dark red/plum color, with thin khaki colored head, rings of lace halfway down the glass. Smell: cherry, balsamic reduction, herbal and vanilla oak, sweet. Taste: caramel, cherry, blackberry, tart grape, herbal and mildly acetic. Finish is sweet with mild vanilla and tannic flavors."
"New style for me, wasn't prepared, so surprised a bit. Have to taste it once more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's got all my favorite things - mildly sour yet this red flemish is flavorful without being very hoppy."
"It was new for me!Ruby color with medium white head. Aroma of winey fruit. Taste is balanced tart , winey, sweet an sour. Pleasant acidic finish"
""
""
"Very clean, lightly tart and acidic. Wine-like. Solid and easy drinking for the style."

"O: Not too impressed since I expected the taste to jump out more like the Grand Cru did. Still an excellent beer and worth buying if you can get it in the little singles like I did."
""
""
""
""
"O: A fairly unique beer that is full of unique flavor. A bit too sour and sweet for me, but very different and I'm glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"(O)- This is a drinking Flanders. One of those you would always have a bottle on hand when you are in the mood for one. Milder, but shows more fruit than sour acidity. While I will say I prefer the grand cru, this is still quite good."

"The front of the palate impresses, but that quickly goes away. A decent step behind the Grand Cru."
""
"Rodenbach is a wonderful beer. I really love Flanders Reds, but I've only had a few in the past, so it's hard for me to evaluate this to style. Nonetheless, it is absolutely delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Its tangy wine finish, carries an inherent honey balance that seems of confectioner's delight, yet pierced by its earthen variety for an effortless close with lingering vinous, lightly powdered astringency and surprisingly refreshing vinegar dryness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I found this to be pretty tasty. Nice balance of sweet and sour. Nothing too overwhelming, which makes his beer a good go-to when your having a sour craving."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is nice. Brownish red color. I like the smell a lot. Hard to describe. The taste is excellent. This is my first sour beer. Buying it I didn't know it was a sour beer. The initial taste is good. A cider lite oak taste. I like the aftertaste a lot. I would drink this beer again."
""
"O- Fine example of a balanced Flanders Red. I prefer a little more sourness, but this is certainly a top quality version of the style and one Id definitely recommend to others, especially those just getting into sours."
""
""
"M: Well-blended and smooth. A good Flemish Red-Brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours nicely although barely any head. Smells a little like dark cherries. Medium carbonation. Fruity but not as much as a lambic. Refreshing. I could have it for brunch, lunch or snack. Not something to taste in detail."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a good beer and a good way to be broken in with sours"
""
""
"O - still getting a handle on the style,but this seems to be a solid drinkable offering."
""
"O - One of the best introductory sours out there. Sweet and sour without being overbearing. Very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice beer and a good example of the style. I have to admit I really liked the oakiness that was present. It really made a difference."
""
""
""
"Pretty drinkable. Will try the grand cru at some point."
"O-I am not a fan of the sourness but it really was a good beer overall. I may have one again."

"Overall: Pretty classic Flanders red. It has been some time since I have had this beer and I'll make sure i have more sooner in the near future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- great cherry notes with just enough tartness to keep you wanting more, one of the more drinkable I've had of the style as well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"getting more into Belgian red/brown ales. this ones smooth balanced and flavorful. hints of vinegar and sour fruit on the aromas. cherry, cranberry. flavor is a bit tart and sweet. hints of herbal spice. not a really deeply complex character, but some good tart and fruity notes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As stated in previous reviews, this would make for an ideal introduction to sour beers. Sweet and tasty without being overwhelmingly sour. Smooth and sessionable."
""
""
""
"O: This is the first sour I have enjoyed, probably, as others have said, because this is a gateway sour for me. I had Lips of Faith and found the sourness too much. This Flanders Red is much more palatable for those wanting some sour, but not seeking a sour bomb. Nicely done, I will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours murky brown with a finger of off-white head. The smell has sweet grapes, cherries, some wild yeast, and some vinegar, although the taste is not as sour as the nose suggests. A low level of sourness is met with a sweet red wine taste and a clean, effervescent, sparkling water finish. Carbonation is high and the body is light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid, good beer as I expected it would be. Doesn't do anything particularly special; it's simply an effective and consistent beer. I would give it a try. Probably not a repurchase (except maybe on tap)."

"To be fair, I think this was my 6th beer of the evening so not sure how that will factor into my opinion. Picked up this beer as part of a mixed 6 because I love the Grand Cru. Good looking beer with an excellent smell. Smells clean, sweet, and tasty. Taste is great, not as sweet as grand cru but very good and clean, nothing to complain about. This beer surprised me, not sure what I was expecting but somehow did not expect it to be this good. Not a great value but I would revisit if I could find it as a decent price. Definitely worth trying, excellent beer, and one I plan to revisit."

"I was a little disappointed in this one but it's not a bad beer. It lacks complexity."

"Beautifully complex & sour, yet not quite as sour as I was expecting. A nice mix of fruits that add some sweetness to proceedings. A great beer to sip away at."

"Tasted on 11-8-2013. This was a new bottle purchased locally. Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass)."

""

"O: A solid beer; drinkable and pleasant, but the Grand Cru puts it to shame."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was surprised to find myself not enjoy this as much as I wanted - I'm relatively familiar with Rodenbach's vintage releases, so I felt this would be simple and refreshing in its own realm. Nevertheless, it's a little too underwhelming overall for what it is, and lacks complexity and unique flavors that I love in the style, as well as in Rodenbach's capabilities. Not bad for a toned down Flanders red, but not something, given the price tag ($10) that I'd revisit any time soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"well priced and something I could session, a nice beginner Flanders and I can see this making a great gateway brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A lovely, balanced Flanders Red ale - sour, yes, but sweet, fruity, and nicely tempered by the musty, woody factor. Enjoyably quenching - not something I thought I'd reason about a sour ale, but there it is."
""
"A very approachable if not most affordable Flanders red ale. I could see this impressing everyone from the most sophisticated of palate to a guy (like me) looking for an affordable sour beer on occasion. Try it!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too bad, but I was expecting better. The aroma was very good, although it lost the zing that the initial pour provided very quickly. The initial and finish of the taste was very nice, but let down by the flabby and bland middle. Overall, I quite enjoyed this beer, and would definitely have another without hesitation. Quite and easy-drinking sour, what it lacks in complexity it makes up in approachability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer held up a lot better then I thought it would for being a ~30 year old bottle. The aroma when I first cracked the bottle was actually one of the best aromas I've experienced in a beer with the perfect balance of tart cherries, vinegar, and malts. It's a shame it couldn't have lasted a little bit longer. Overall the bottle definitely showed it's age put was without a doubt a pleasure to drink."
""
"Very nice sour beer. Fairly complex, easily drinkable. There's enough sweetness and malt character to not allow the sourness to overwhelm."

"O- wonderful sour at a great price, great everyday sour as its affordable and easy to obtain. No seasonal, or limited run status here. 1/4 oak aged, 3/4 young beer. If you enjoy sour beers, vinegar, pickles, or anything tart give this one a shot."
""
"A very well balanced sour ale, good flavor but not to overwhelming. A great sour to introduce yourself to the style, but one to come back to for fans of sours as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a nice dark red/amber color with a slightly hazy body and filled with carbonation. The head is thin and dissipates rather quickly, but forms a nice thin ring of lace. There are plenty a fruit aromas coming through, apple, grape, lemon and figs too, but I also pick up a very faint vinegar scent. It’s sour and sweetens up as it hits the corners of your mouth, light bodied and very refreshing. The woody flavors do come out as you swallow, but the very faintly and the sourness does linger. It goes down quit smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very delicious for the age and low abv. It strikes a great balance between very mild taste that is still very complex. I will certainly add more of these to my cellar, it is a great beer to just enjoy and not be overpowered with in your face sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"*Overall, this is a really special beer. It's got everything a great sour Belgian beer should have. And to boot, it's not that alcoholic or hard to drink like some Belgian beers can be. I will diffidently be picking this up again for sure!"
"O - Easy drinker overall. Not what I would go for if I was craving a sour ale, but it has a nice tartness and smoothness common to the style. Makes for a great beer for the summer time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle at Stubbies in Gaineville poured in Rodenbach tulip. Not what I was expecting after having their Vintage 2010. Really more of a quad, dubbel, or Belgian dark. Pours dark brownish res with a thin fluffy head on top. Aroma of plums and cherry, with verry littke sourness. Flavor follows, with some additional strong malt flavor and a bit of molasses, black cherry and a hint of funk. A very good and flavorful beer but not on style here. Medium to heavy slick mouthfeel, soft and smooth on the palate."
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather enjoyable brew with a nice blend of sweet and tart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, quite good, but the Grand Cru is much better."
""
"O - very drinkable sour, though not my favorite. however it may be good for those who dont like an overly sour beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, but doesn't rise above the crowd of sours. Still, it's a good one to grab off the shelf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer. It has all of the hallmarks of what I expect a Flanders Red Ale to be. It's highly drinkable and refreshing while being a bit tart. I prefer the Grand Cru to this, but this is definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Based on the way this is made (25% 2 years matured and 75% young) I think it is ready to drink immediately. This is a good example of beer/food as culture."
""
""
""
""
""
"From the 12 oz bottle in a six-pack bought at Liticker's Liquor & Deli in San Diego for a quite reasonable price. Interesting to discover this brewery is now owned by Palm of Belgium, which makes some hack beers of no distinction at all."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nicely tart very cherry forward easier drinking Flemish red. Nothing like the super complex and sour ones with more old beer in the blend. The young beer gives it a nice a malty base while the small percentage of old beer in there provides just enough funk and sourness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark mahogany color with only a small, fleeting bubbly head. Deep, acidic aromas of vinegar, black cherry, berries, red wine, and wood alongside a nice, rich creaminess and a touch of vanilla. Tart, fruity flavor with some oak, and a balancing malt sweetness. Medium bodied, acidic, and crisp. Very drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: good beer but the hype it definitely does not live up to. Honestly this is probably my first flander's red ale, and I want to try more before I put them on the ""beware"" list. Salud!"
"Interesting style..I may have to hunt down a few other examples of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is much darker than anticipated. ..deep ruby brown with slight white lacing. Smell is so complex. Lots of sweet toffee english malts and oak but a huge cherry tartness is dominant. Taste is nicely tart cherry but so balanced with the sweet toffee malt and oak. Its super dry as expected and easy to drink. Its a great is example of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and from what I can tell it's a good example of the style, but this is my first of the style, so I don't have much experience with this style at all but it seems to be close to the description BA provides for the style. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, and the flavors kept me interested, but the high amount of sweetness would prevent from having another, one of these small bottles is the perfect amount. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma it was pretty nice with lots of tart fruit aromas. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, a little more head and lacing would make this beer look pretty good. I would buy this again when in the mood for a nice and tart beer, it's not too expensive, especially for a beer from Belgium, I recommend this to anyone who want something with a little bit of tartness to it. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it had just the right amount of tartness to it, and the cherry aspect was pretty nice. This beer made for a good first impression for this brewery and it has made me want to try more of the style, good job guys, this is a pretty tasty and unique brew."
"A local package store has Rodenbach in 6-packs, and I want to GO BUY IT NOW!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: if you are in to Belgian sours you will like this beer, sweet and sour elements are well balanced"
""
"O: One thing that deserves to be mentioned is how inexpensive this bottle was - about $1.75 for a single 11.2 oz bottle. It's not the greatest sour ever, but as a refreshing thirst quencher, I'd take this over many standard fruit beers any day. It's cheap (for a sour), it's well made, and it's a panty dropper. Enough said!"
""
"O- Wow. I was very skeptical about trying sours but this thing was just unbelievable. This was highly drinkable and very enjoyable, and I am excited for future sours if they're anything like this."
""
""
""
"Medium weight and medium carbonation in the mouthfeel. This is enjoyable overall - has a nice nose and the sour adds a good profile to the flavor. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing Flanders Red Ale, just behind its older sister the Grand Cru. A beer that keeps growing through the tasting session, simply excellent."
""
""
"O- A solid beer. A lot of feel for the size. A great introduction to the style."
"An impressive brew - this is certainly one of the more idiosyncratic styles to come out of Belgium. It fascinates me how allowing a beer to become innoculated by a range of microorganisms and then aging it in wood produces such a complexity of character. The smell is just as you might expect, though the flavour seems thinner and less intricate than the aroma. The body is also somewhat watery and insubstantial. Good, but falls short of greatness (I suspect that the lack of bottle conditioning might have contributed to this). Nonetheless, a classic beer that is well worth trying; grab one if you have the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was a little worried in the beginning, but where this beer lacks in first impressions it more than makes up for in the end. Not all that complex but it is a solid brew none the less."
""
""
"Complex malts, somehow it's sugary without being sweet. Subtle tartness with more funk than I was expecting. This is a solid Flanders that focuses on malt and fruit more the tartness/sourness."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good Flemish Red. Not too sour and not too sweet. Very refreshing."

""

"O: Complex, yet refreshing. The first time I had this beer a couple of years ago I thought it had turned bad. Now it’s a beer that I return to over and over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The sweetness and tart flavor will for sure surprise those who are not familiar with this style (Like myself) or turn them off completely. All of that aside, this is a good beer that I throughly enjoyed and I look forward to trying out more from Rodenbach in the future."
""
""
""
"Very drinkable. I wish this had a bit more funk as it's a tad papery for me. Still good stuff though."
""
""
"This beer pours a light bodied, chestnut brown with ruby highlights and a one finger, creamy off white head. The nose features light sweet cherry with light vinegar. The flavors are both sweet and tart. It features a touch of sweet cherry with an acetic tartness but also has this odd, lager yeast and pale malt characteristic that is both stale and really strange. It's too light and that lager aspect is really distracting. It drinks light with a decent amount of residual sugar but the flavors don't all come together very well. I wouldn't buy this one. It is well below Duchesse let alone their Grand Cru."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Jury out on this one for me overall"
""
""
""
"O: Very refreshing and sweet, this beer goes down way too easy."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied throughout, with a moderate carbonation that leads to a subtle foaming on the palate. The result is a slightly creamy, yet crisp and satisfying beer. Finish is very dry, as expected, with little stickiness on palate."
""
""
""
""
"Half finger head on a murky brown with golden hued body. No lacing really. Aroma is very fruity with syrup, caramel and sour cherry. Flavor is similar creamy with sour cherry, caramel and syrups. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Nice flavor. Interesting brew, not sure if I have had any from this style before. Complex and more drinkable than you would expect."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is very drinkable that is light and refreshing. It would be a very mild and approachable offering for someone who might have had anything similar to this style before. A classic, I couldnt help but think anout the endless array of foods this could be paired with. I'll be picking this up again."
""
" Stay Fiscal My Friends!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This was good, packing in some good cherry flavor but then also having a nice acidic bite to it. The body on this really did a solid job of keeping those flavors accessible as well. This is well worth picking up. It’s very drinkable for what’s involved."
""
""
"Nice carbonation level and again a very drinkable Flanders red"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good Flanders Red. A benchmark for the style in a lot of ways. It's crazy-drinkable, but don't expect a depth of flavor (or a significant sourness)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This may be my first Flanders Red ale, and it is a beauty. Light, almost airy in feel, with a pleasantly tart flavor, this is supremely drinkable. Despite having such a light feel, the flavor is not lacking in the least. Letting it linger on the tongue amplifies the tartness to a point of over-stimulation; this ale lets you know that despite a delicate appearance, it will pack a punch if you let it. I definitely recommend, especially as a starter beer for the evening, or as a dessert beer after a meal."

"Overall: Really solid beer. This one is all about robust and balanced flavors. Very nice beer!"
""
""
"Plenty of flavors to keep you busy. Very well balance and incredibly drinkable. I'll definitely be having this one more in the future."

"Overall this is a solid representation of the style. It is very well balanced, but I would appreciate a bit more sour. I think a bit of time (6-12 months) in the cellar could improve this one and take it to the next level. Let this warm up a bit and the subtleties really come through. Not the best I've ever had but a very good representation of the style. Recommended to any fan of Belgian Sours or any funky beer. Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a very different and enjoyable beer. My first Flanders Red and I'm very impressed with the depth of aroma and flavors they get in a relatively small 5.2% ABV beer. Well done!"

"O - I think the ageing had something to do with it. I had an older bottle of Duchesse last week, and lost almost all the malt, and was more of a cider. The malt stayed quite nicely in this aged brew."

"O: Age got the best of this with regards to taste, but the smell is still holding up quite well. Either way, it was a fun beer to try and the oldest I've enjoyed to-date."

"A well balanced sour."
""

"250ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Dark mahogany colour, a bit like red wine with a brown tint, small tanned head which disappeared fast, clear from the top but thick from the side. Smelled malts and red wine. Tasted grape, was like a light sour red wine, notes of oak, yeasty sour finish. Mouthfull smooth with deceptive carbonation. Overall I'd say the more I get used to the sourness the better I like it."
""
"O- I love this beer. It is the perfect introduction to sours, but not a true sour. I drink it like a world class session beer. Extremely complex and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into tulip glass. Appears a deep maroon with mild clarity. Tan head persists nicely with spotty lacing left behind. The nose is heavy with notes of red grapes, a touch of vinegar and oak is present as well along with some sweetness in the back. The taste has a mild tartness which mingles with a considerable amount of fruity sweetness. Tons of grape character all over, finish falls a little flat with almost a watery character. The mouth feel is less carbonated than I would hope for this style, the body is light. Overall, this is a drinkable and affordable Flanders Red. It is very approachable for those interested in the world of sours but not ready for overly mouth puckering brews."

"O: A very drinkable and accessible sour; obviously not as sour as the Grand Cru--though the aroma hinted like it might be--but still a nice, balanced example of the style"
"D - Liked it, but wouldn't actively seek it out again."
"pours a very murk brown with a white head. best before date 08-22-12. Lots of tart sweetness on the nose. Some citrus, raisins, lemon rind, green apples. Mildy tart, not over the top tasting. Low amount of effervescence. Malty sweetness up front, almost buttery, slides around the sides of the tongue and bright fruit sourness kicks in to balance. A wave of subtlety (for a sour anyway). Hidden notes of oak, lots of deep complex flavors if you wanna look for them. Pretty smooth and well balanced. I usually don't like sours but the sour flavors lend a nice balance to this one."
"I love the aroma of sour cherries and malt sweetness. You can taste the base brown ale and almost seperate it form the sourness. After Trying numerous other sour beers, I can always come back to this one. Great for a refreshing experience in hot weather or for something special over dinner."

"Deep reddish brown, not quite opaque, no head, didn't really expect one on a beer like this one. Really nice fruity aroma, but kind of one dimensional, not picking up any funk or wood, maybe just a touch of yeast. Exceptionally delicious beer, and while I appreciate subtlety in a brew with sour character, they don't all need to be special occasion bottles that demand constant attention and reflection. This is an outstanding go to just-felt-like-a-sour beer. What I'm trying to say is that no, this isn't a hall of fame Belgian sour, but yes, it tastes absolutely incredible and is an outstanding value. What it lacks in a depth comparison to the grand cru it makes up for in casualness. Anyway, great medium body on this beer, very pleasant carbonation. All in all, like I was saying, a totally worthwhile beer, but if you came for the funk you might leave disappointed. If you wanted the sweet-tart beer combo in a sessionable beer at a legit price, this is your huckleberry."
"O - An easy drinking Flemish sour. Not as sophisticated as the Gran Cru but a nicely balanced and surprisingly complex beer."
""
""
"The flavor brings a beautiful combo of cherry and oak with accompanying acidity. Body is nice and creamy with some perceived fruit sweetness. Dry finish after a somewhat-chewy body. Really a great example of the style."
""
""
"Light bodied with modest carbonation. Almost watery. This is not as good as the Grand Cru, in fact it isn't even close. That's not to say that this is a bad beer, but it pales in comparison to the Grand Cru."
"O-not as powerful as Grand Cru. this is only the second of the style I have had. But this is pretty good."

"Overall. Good beer. A little sweet for me, but I enjoyed it."

"On draft at brewery. .25 l into Rodenbach tulip.  Dark ruby.  Off white head, soapy lacing. Aroma, vinegar, sour. Mouth puckering, biting in the back of the mouth and top of throat. Smooth finish, Michael Jackson called this refreshing,I guess for the first time I understand what he meant. Delicious. "

"Has a rusty red color. Red almost comes through in head, in a pinkish khaki color. Head holds well and clings to glass. Beer is clearly filtered, (zero sediment) which really negates beneficial cellaring. Smells good and well matured though. Musky maltiness along with sharp yeast notes. Wide range of mouthfeel and flavors from yeast and bacteria varieties. Bitterness is present and suiting to the rest of the beer. Oak isn't too much and really compliments the flavor profile. Aftertaste is pleasant. Solid tart/sour character. I find this to be an approachable beer for anybody, even though it has a true sour beer."

"This beer pours a murky brownish red color. There is about a finger of off-white head resting on top. The head has decent retention, and there is some whisky lace left behind on the glass. The nose is of sour fruit up fruit, mostly cherries, raspberries, and some apple. There are some aromas of vinegar and oak. I am also getting just a little bit of funkiness coming through. The taste follows the nose pretty well. It starts off with mostly sour cherries, but the raspberries and apple flavors are their as well. There is some vinegar and acidicness. There is some oak, as well as some earthiness and yeasty esters. The finish leaves some lingering sour cherries behind on the palate. This has a medium body and high carbonation. It goes down nicely and has a good amount of sourness to it. It has some earthy bitterness to it, as well as some acidicness. This has good drinkability. The taste is quite nice, and I enjoyed it a lot. This is my first flanders red, but I definitely look forward to getting my hands on some more. I recommend checking this one out."
"This is to sours what Sierra Nevada is to Pale Ales. Very refreshing and drinkable, not too sour but lots of flavor with a full body. This isn't the most complex sour, but it's a great intro and, eventually, stand by. With such a low ABV, I like finishing my night with a Rodenbach. Go home with the one that brung ya."
""
"Perhaps I shouldn't have drank it right out of the fridge, I think letting it sit would have opened it up a lot."
"O - This beer definitely has some winelike qualities. The low ABV makes it easy to polish off in a sitting."
"O: A very rich and flavorful beer with a complex flavor profile. The flavors seem much more integrated than many other examples of this style, probably due to the strong blending experience at the brewery."

"O - The tame and subtle flavors combined with the crazy smooth body make this a really fantastic beer. The appearance and aroma were a bit of letdown, but the other qualities balance those out. I doubt aging has improved this beer, but it sure as hell can hold up to a few years of cellaring."
"Overall a very nice beer, tastes a little like an aged wine, with the initial watery feeling, but fantastic over all"

"Good version of this style and a bit more accessible than their vintage version of this. Have not yet had the chance to try the grand cru."
""
"Taste is enjoyable. Mostly tart cherries with a subtle sour characteristic that would pair well with food. Mouthfeel was medium to light bodied and the carbonation was high but appropriate. An excellent brew."
"O- A solid Flemish Red, doesn't have as much going on as the Grand Cru, but still an great beer. Would probably be a good intro to sour beers before moving onto some more aggressive lambics."
""
"D/O - very, very drinkable. I admit, I liked this more the first time I had it. Now that I realize it's not sour at all, I find myself wishing it were. A great beer to start on, if you're not used to the style. Honestly, compares slightly more to an Oud Bruin in my opinion (having it after a Monk's Cafe) than a Flanders red, mostly because of its lack of sourness...the two are very, very similar. I absolutely love both styles, though, so still, a great beer to drink!"
""
"Poured a 3/4"" beige head which dissipated pretty quickly. Deep burnt umber brown color almost like coffee. Smell is a little bit of malt and a lot of pickle juice. Taste is the reverse, the pickle sour is more subdued, and it has some fruitiness such as cherry. It's probably the mildest sour I've had."
""
""
"O: very muted and dark compared to grand cru. Not that impressed."
""
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brownish/red color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is alive with fruits. Taste is tart, cherries, some other berries, lots of flavor here. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a very good beer worth checking out."
"Good carbonation, somewhat dry finish, crisp and refreshing. Enjoyable and easy to drink; falls shy of the much more complex Grand Cru."

"O: Overall this is a decent affordable sour for someone looking to get into them. I remember this being one of my first and me raving about it to everyone. Now that I'm a bit more experienced in the sour field I decided to try it again and it tastes completely different."

"Overall this is a great take on the not-so-sour kind of Flanders beers out there. Some of them end up tasting like juice; this one does not at all. I also like that it comes in six-packs."

"Overall- I am surprised that I am saying this, but I would like this to be a little more tart. This a great beer if you want to get into the style. 4/5"

"Another excellent though not world changing beer from Rodenbach."
"Overall this is really good and surprisingly drinkable."
"Would I get this again? yes"
"O: This is about as sessionable as sour beers come. Not huge with flavors but really well balanced between the sweet malts and sour flavors. It's extremely refreshing."
"Overall: Nice entry-level Flanders Red. Beers in this style really fall somewhere on a spectrum of of sweet to sour and the blending percentages of this one definitely push it towards sweet. Tasty stuff and I can't wait to try the Grand Cru."
"Overall, a really nice flemish sour I was glad to try. Nothing is overly complex or sour, but everything is pleasant, enjoyable, and well done for the most part. I would get this again."
"I'm new to Flanders Red Ales, and this is a little sweeter than I prefer, but a very good overall."
"Definately worth trying and a excellent example of the style a must have and seems readily available as well."
"Pours a dark brown/crimson into my snifter w/ an amazing two finger cocoa head. Incredible lacing on the side of the glass. Good carbonation as well. Really a looker. Nose is apple, grape, oak, funk, maybe some prunes as well. Very smooth for the style, and not overpowering. Taste has the same profile as the nose, with the grape really coming out in the aftertaste. Very easy, nice drinker. Almost like drinking wine. Feel is smooth, but funky w/ high acidity as well. Really nice. Overall, this is a great Flanders- and I'll pick this up again for sure."
"O - Very pleasurable and easy drinking yet an excellent sipper. With cork topped bottle and ample carbonation, this is a great choice as a beer for celebrations or Italian foods."
"In reflection I wish for a little more complexity. But I’ve been spoiled thanks to the goodness that comes out of Russian River."
"bottle from half time pours are dark amber color, small off white head with fair retention reducing to a light lacing cap. scent is tart with cherry and plum. taste is a surge of sour and sweet dancing on the tounge. sweet prevails over the mighty sour army. dark fruits say hello. mouth is light to medium with nice belgiany mouth. alchohol is hidden. more please."
"Light and full-flavored without becoming too puckering. Nicely balanced."
"Very tasty and refreshing. I have tried the Grand Cru before, but will have to bring a bottle home and try it in a more controlled environment."
"O- I don't know what to think about this. Personally I don't like wine, but this combination is interesting. I could see myself getting into the style. Once the beer sits for a bit this feels more like that."
"O-a pretty good tasting and easy drinking belgian sour. its not a world class beer, but there also isn't anything keeping me from being able to enjoy this at any time. the more i drink it, the more i find that i love it...the subtleties of the flavors really start to pop out."
"this isnt the first time with a flanders so i was kinda hoping it would have that cost efficient sour taste im looking for, it wasnt to far off. this poured a solid murky dark red brown, with little head if there was one its just a ring of little bubbles now. the nose on this came off with some vinegar but not overpowering and then led into a solid sour fruit wave. the taste is similar to the nose except not as strong and the flavors had a slight apple juice taste to it and definitely has a cherry ending, not overly fruity but its all you taste. the feel of this beer is good though, lots of jumpy carbonation in it and a very nice dry finish. overall its a decent beer, if it had more sour fruit and a little less vinegar i think i would score it hire."
"Really delicious and a great beer. Loved it."
"As a relative noob to sours and a total noob to this style, I can still see how this is considered a classic. Does everything I expected it to do and does it well. I can’t really say if styles such as this are my cup of tea as I’m just in the experimental stage right now but I get the appeal."
"O- I've only had a a handful of Flanders reds, so my points of comparison are somewhat limited, but this is a pretty good beer. Would be a nice introductory sour for a wine lover, for sure."
"This is a great beer which is truly a great example of a regional Belgian style. If you want to really branch out, and try something very different, than this is a great beer to reach out, and try. Great maroon color, with a nice white head lacing. Smells of nice cherries, grapes, and (I hate to say it) sourpatch kids. The first sip gives a nice tart cherries, with some real nice sour ""funk"". This is a great beer! Very drinkable, and is one that I feel is a must try for everyone, and is definitely one I will go back to when I am in the modd for something sour, but which is still very drinkable."
"Overall: The taste doesn't live up to the presentation. The appearance and nose built up my anticipation but the taste while not bad was muted and very plain. I'll have to try the Grand Cru."
"Overall Experience-easy to drink, very enjoyable, seems to sit in my stomach though. probably not advised as a session beer. a great sipping beer even though it is not a high gravity beer. a staple as a Flanders red in my opinion."
"Absolutely delicious. I'm not a Flanders red ale expert, but I do know that I highly enjoyed this beer. I have to applaud the balance here...it's not too sour, not too fruity. It's just good."
"Rodenbach Classic poured a very dark amber color, with little, fizzy head. There was a sweet berry like smell. The taste was dry, fizzy, had a nice tartness, and hints of different berries; the taste was similar to a red wine. Very easy and nice to drink, good strong flavor, carbonation worked out very well for this one. Overall this beer was a bit out of the norm, but very impressive and enjoyable."
"O-I prefer the grand cru. This is a great comparison point in terms of understanding how much of a difference the blend makes."
"Very clean and easy to drink however. Carbonation keeps it lively enough. No alcohol what so ever. Not a style I have much so I guess this is pretty good? Nice on a hot night."
"The color is dark red and medium brown in the glass. Little aroma, but plenty of sour, sweet, lightly malty taste. No hops bitter to speak of—that’s not the style. This is brown malt and fruity, sour, sweet fruit on top and a touch of earthiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is clean, crisp, and rather light with some prickly carbonation and bright acidity. This isn’t the most sour sour beer; it isn’t the fruitiest fruity beer; it isn’t the maltiest brown beer. But it is a very nicely balanced sour, fruity, red-brown beer."
"750 ml bottle into oversized wine glass, best by 11-28-07. Pours crystal clear red color with a small off white head with decent retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lasts. Small bits of lacing cling to the glass as well. Aromas of cherry, vinegar, oak, and some spiciness. Decent aromas here, a tad bit more muted than I was expecting. Taste of big cherry, oak, vinegar, and apples. Nice sweet taste with a slight bit of apple and cherry tartness on the finish. The finish is surprisingly dry, with only some light sweetness and tartness on the finish. Medium carbonation and body. Very smooth drinking with no alcohol in the taste or finish. This is quite a refreshing and easy going beer due to the light amount of sourness present in this. Overall, a very nice Flanders red, I would like to try a younger bottle of this sometime."
"Tastes delicious! Freshly picked wild berries with some acidic sourness reminiscent of granny smith apples and its also tartly crisp. Malts are light in the mouth but still offer a nice background. It's an approachable sour beer, as the sourness is not overly intense. I would not mind if it was a bit sourer, but that would take away from the extreme drinkability of this beer. It goes down so damn easy, I could drink a 750 by myself with ease. Excellent brew."
"Pours a murky brownish red with tan head that fades yet reappears with some swirling of the glass. Smells of balsamic vinegar with some brown sugar notes. Maybe a little fig or slight raisin notes. Tastes sour yet has a sweet brown sugar like quality. I also get flashes of cocoa and maybe some vanilla notes likely from the barrel aging. A fine beer. A great beginner sour For those just getting in to 'em. This one has a light to medium mouthfeel wiith bitter and lighter sour notes. Glad I picked this one up!"
"O: A great beer, very nice flavor profile with a perfect level of tartness. Would have certainly ordered another if not for the price. Something I will probably grab some bottles of."
"Overall: Excellent brew, I prefer the grand cru though"
"Rodenbach is tasty in many ways, it is tart which makes it almost refreshing based on the relatively low abv-5.2% and the slight yeasty smoothness in the flavor combined with vanilla oakiness which is fantastic alongside the subtle cherry tastes in the malt and yeast combination. The fruit elements are so dominant which says a lot for a beer that doesn't contain fruit. This was probably too much for the meal I paired it with -succotash and scallops with a chili rub, but I enjoyed how the fruit sour elements combined with my wife'c coconut curry basmati rice and firecracker shrimp. I could enjoy this red about any time it doesn't stand up to the high level of drinkability and flavor quotient of the Grand Cru, but hey for what it is Rodenbach is a decent all around beer."
"I don't have much experience with this style of beer, but from what I'm getting from this, I certainly will seek out more in the future. Really enjoyed this."
"Dark purplish red clear body, several small trails of rising carbonation, minimal head with quick dissipation resulted in thin broken layer on top of body. Nose is pretty funky, musty horseblanket balanced by fruit esters, cherry, plums, lemon, minimal hop presence, a bit flowery. Taste is more sour than tart though in nice balance, rich oakiness from the tuns. Mouthfeel is medium-light, lip smacking tart, dry finish. Relatively good drinkability for the style. Superlative, wonder how this improved in the bottle with several years of aging. Hope I have the patience to repeat this experiment."
"O: On the whole, this is an extremely drinkable, flavorful, likable beer."
"Overall: my first ale of this kind, I will pursue the genre further. I liked it, but it doesn't stack up to the maltier ales for me."
"Overall this is a winner as it is exceptionally drinkable and not overpowering but allows the avid beer drinker the enjoyment of a Flanders style at a session feel... CHEERS!!"
"The CPJ"
"O: not a great Flanders red at all for me. Pretty standard and a little too sweet."
"This beer poured out like a dark red wine. Not much carbonation here. The beer didn't leave much in way of lacing either. The smell of the beer was pungent on the nose giving it the sour aroma. The taste of the beer was tart and had a light sour cherry flavor to it. The mouthfeel was on the flatter side and not overly exciting. Overall it's a decent beer in my opinion. I'd like to give the Grand Cru a try sometime."
"Rodenbach Grand Cru it ain't."
"$9 a 750ml"
"Wonderful mix of sour and malt. Slight sweetness with floral notes that contrast with sour and acid. Relatively flat, consistent with sour, though with enough head to release lovely aromas and contribute to mouth feel. Lots of body and flavor for 5.2% beer. A 750ml that you can open without considering how early you need to get up the next day."
"O- Very refreshing, a good beer, but Iwould like a little more sourness."
"D - This is, of course, a classic example of the style where the acidity is assertive, but not as intense as in the Grand Cru. There is a lot of rich, dark and fruity malt that creates both balance and interest by contrasting the sharp acidity. Carbonation is another important point that is hit upon with great accuracy and it pushes the intense flavors aside in the finish, leaving only a light, dry and acidic fruitiness lingering on the palate. A beer that everyone interested in good beer must try and a perfect introduction to sour beer."
"Overall an ok beer. Don't think I would try it again. I need to try the grand Cru still"
"D: high. Easy drinkin'. Very repeatable. 4.0"
"O - Good overall, the flavor is lacking just a bit but the beer is quality across the board. It could be due to the fact it's on the cusp of the best by date but it's hung in there regardless. Methinks I may have to nab a fresh bottle!"
"D - This one was great for taking a break from the IPAs, DIPAs and stouts I have been drinking lately. The flavor is unique with a good balance of sweet and sour. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will drink again."
"Supper drinkable and a great feeling tasting beer. I am not a cider fan but this is almost a cider persons beer for someone who prefers beer more than cider, bringing in all the good qualities of cider into a beer right here, with just a touch of Saison brett and goodness."
"This is really nice, and reels it in a little bit toward the traditional side of the sour ale shore, if you've been O.D.ing on the more powerful, sourer American versions. Not exactly as exquisite as I'd remembered and hoped, but an excellent springtime quaff nonetheless."
"Pours a beautiful deep brownish red color with a massive fluffy beige head that impairs my ability to pour a full glass. Smells of cider and vinegar as soon as I pop the cork. Sweet fruity tartness fills my nostrils; cherries, vanilla, and hints of oak round out the nose. Luckily the vinegar is not as present as when I first opened her up. Taste is more fruity than tart. Slightly tart cherries strained over a sweet malty base. Bits of oak and acetic acid in there, really not what I was expecting. Lots of bubbles, medium to thin body, chalky sugary fruity mouthfeel. Decent easy to drink beer but a lot sweeter than I was expecting. Maybe I've totally wrecked my palette with American sour ales, but I thought this beer is a bit too subtle."
"WHAAAATTTT!! Surprise Surprise Surprise….a Belgium that is pretty dog gone good. Cloudy Brown, big cider/vinegar smell, but the taste is very light and refreshing…..crazy! I would not go crazy and would shy away from doing a session…just too sweet and tart."
"O - Overall, a pretty interesting and good beer. Can't say I'll seek it out again but I enjoyed it."
"Classic for a reason."
"This beer is like listening to a song where a vocalist can hit some cool notes, the drummer can make a nice back beat, the bassist can try to add harmony, and the guitarist can rip a clean solo, however they just can't seem to work well and harmonize together. Overall, this is a very good beer despite my criticism, and I will seek it out again!"
"Rodenbach has a red colour and a small head that fades quickly. It smells like berries but is a little sour. The taste is sour and a little fruity. The aftertaste is sour with a hint of honey. The texture is bubbly and pretty decent. Overall, pretty nice. Better than the last Flanders red that I had."
"O: A true classic in every sense. The pinnacle of the style from the true masters of Flanders Reds."
"Overall: This is a very balanced anad smooth beer. I could have a few of these in a session, the sourness isn't too overpowering. I'm definitely open to having this one again."
"O--Overall, this was one of the best beers I have ever tried. It was my first sour, and after trying this I am going to try many, many more."
"Cheers."
"D : very drinkable and refreshing"
"Appropriate carbonation and body, and an easy drinker. Worth your time to try this one."
"D: OK but thin and watery, not decent aftertaste, you have a sip and 30 seconds later there's no taste in your mouth, where's the Flanders red ale?, where's the oak?"
"I'm a fan"
"While certainly a good beer, I think this one pales in comparison to the grand cru. It doesn't have the rich fruitiness, complex acidity, and barnyard funk of it's big brother. That said, it is just as refreshing and easy drinking. This would be a nice introduction to sour ales as it is less intense on the palate, and is still a wonderfully crafted beer."
"Had this on tap somewhere in California. Reviewing this from my notes. Pours a dark brown colour with hints of amber. Thin off-white head, leaving nice lacing down the glass. Smells of sour cherry and sweet brown sugar. Flavour has a really nice tartness to it, complemented by the sweetness. This is insanely delicious."
"D - A slow and savory drink. Not something you're going to throw back."
"Drinkability: I love this beer. I want more!"
"D - Very drinkable, almost like a cherry soda."
"D- its about as easy a drinker as they come. I do enjoy the grand cru a bit more but if seen on draft it would be a hard pass up."
"Again, not bad, but a little disappointing given the rich smell. Not nearly enough follow-through, but easy-drinking nonetheless."
"D= This is a great beer and its wonderfully refreshing. The drinkability is extremely high as neither the sourness nor the sweetness get out of hand. Highly recommended."
"From the 750 ml. bottle with no expiration or brewed date. Sampled on 1/11/11. The pour is a nice looking amber-brown with about an inch of silky but quickly fading head. Some ruby hues when held to the light. The aroma is a lot like vinegar which is a bit of a turnoff for me. I get a little hint of malts. The body is in the medium range with a fizzy carbonation. The taste is quitre sour and boozy."
"Overall- Drinkability is very high. Though I was hoping for a bit more overall. This is a nice inexpensive Belgian."
"The flavor is crisp and refreshing with the sweetness up front of juicy cherries and berries finishing with a dry brut like acidity. Very mellow as far as the sharpness of the tart side is concerned. There is a chance this is almost four years old now so maybe the age has mellowed the whole thing out a bit. Very juicy tasting up front with the dry tartness rounding out the end, but not in a way that overrides the sweetness. This brew ends more balanced than I remember other examples of the style ending. All and all this is simply amazing as far as texture and drinkability go. The mouthfeel is only slightly chalky and is far from thin or heavy or watery. The drinkability is like Powerade when you're really thirsty. (I can drink Powerade pretty damn fast hungover). Super tasty. Soda like fizziness as well as a bit of brown ale mellow malts too."
"Overall: Very drinkable and balanced. Not as sour as many other Flanders ales. Restrained funkiness, compared with others."
"A refreshing, thrist quenching beer."
"Tate is really sharp an tart, sweet and fruity with a crisp finish. The mouthfeel is light and creamy. Really well done and drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin for such a robust and oaky flavor. Carbonation is gentle, adding just a fizz. Drinkability is about what you would expect. I wouldn't want more than a few ounces."
"D -- Very nice, being as how this isn't as acidic as most of the Flanders I've had in the past, I can see where this might make a more palatable beer for some people."
"Cheers!"
"I could easily take a bath in this beer. What's not to like? Not as sour or tart as other Flemish reds, but enough sourness to make it clear you're drinking something exceptional. The healthy hit of Pez-like sugar in the nose is inviting, then the light body and the tightness of the taste-- without the balsamic twang of other beers of this style-- just keep raising the glass all by itself. Low alcohol means you can drink several at one sitting. I'm sorry I had only one bottle in the house at the time."
"D: This is one amazing beer. I must seek it out again."
"Coming back, there's an almost lactic tart on top, drying out the middle of the tongue in time, and a touch of sweetness curling around the sides of the tongue near the tip late. Really only some cherry as far as fruity tones as a whole with hints of raisin and/or weak phenols coming real late. Not a whole lot of depth to the malt either, but nice for what it offers. I'd try it again, preferably with some Belgian pub fare."
"TASTE: sweet; sour; oaky; fruit leather; this is a blend of 75% young ale and 25% old ale, matured in oak casks. A bit more sweet than the Grand Cru bottling, and not quite as complex either."
"D- Very easy to drink and great complexity. Not sour to the point were drink a 750 mL by yourself is too much, but still sour enough for when you want a sour."
"Very easy to take..."
"Bitter, sour and sweet. A nice balance that lingers in the aftertaste."
"drinkability - has some refreshing qualities, great complexity, rich fruit and sour/tart/woody notes"
"330ml bottle best before 10-06-2010. Bought at Capital Market, Salem darker amber almost cola coloured ale..small delicate light brown head. Good sour and fruity aromas,slightly phenolic and earthy. mainlly very malty with sourness underneath,very balanced. Some astringency at the end, but its welcomed. Smooth and balanced again on the palate Overall very refreshing, but not sour enough for me."
"CHEERS!!"
"750 ml bottle. Pours hazy brown with a tanned head, nice lacing. Aroma is of sour dough, dark fruit and some woody notes. Full, smooth, creamy body. Pleasant sweet-sour taste is of yeast, fruit (mostly cherry) and wine like woody notes. Long, sweet-sour finish. Wonderful beer."
"D: This is okay but I don't quite understand the obsession with the style. It is not a very complex brew."
"Slight toffee, bready, malty, sweet."
"Drinkability is great...very inviting but not the best beer I've ever had."
"Solid, above average drink. I'm just starting to try and appreciate sour beers, and this is not overly sour for me. So far so good, so I will press on..."
"D: Excellent. Very nice, smooth and tasty."
"d- smooth, easy drinking. this is a top notch classic sour that i would drink again."
"Reddish in color with brown tones, light tan head with a little lacing. The nose has notes of pears, vinous qualities blended with acetic qualities that kick with a pungent finish of green apples. Very refreshing. A thin beer with a pungent finish. An extremely drinkable beer that begs to be drunk quickly."
"I like the red aged before a fresh bottle, and I like the red before the grand cru. This is one I could have a field day with. Now if they would only un retire Redbach, than i'll be sitting pretty."
"D: it drank quite well and was a little dissapointed on the overall tart bite it had. Don't get me wrong, it was still a pretty tasty beer. I think i'm just spoiled after having their alexander."
"The only place I've ever had it on tap was at the New Albanian Brewing Company Public House (formerly known as Rich O's Public House)"
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability rates fairly high. I will be buying this beer again, a great example of the style."
"The perfect beer for a warm summer night"
"D - Goes down easy with lots of complex tastes. Very nice. More sessionable than the Grand Cru but not as much of a heavyweight."
"Overall I remember this one being more tart than it was here, it's a bit too subdued for the style. Still, it's a well made beer that's worth a shot, especially for those just getting into sours."
"Hazy copper body with a thin off-white head and very nominal lacing. Aroma is some nominal tartness with big earthy qualities and faint berry notes. Wood comes through faintly on the finish, earth on the forefront with a pleasant immediate vinegar and lingering tartness on the finish. Very drinkable thin mouthfeel with very clean finish."
"Finally, a place that has this on tap so that I don't have to buy a bottle (I'm cheap). You rock, CK! It pours a seemingly clear, though rather dark, ruby topped by over a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises light vinegar, mandarin oranges, pineapple, maple syrup, sour grapes, and raspberries. The taste begins with some o' those sour grapes and vinegar notes, followed by some wheat, lightly roasted malts, and nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, a tasty Flemish offering, but not necessarily something I see myself drinking too often."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer for someone who is interested in trying out a ""sour"". The experience was not overwhelming for a novice to the category such as myself. I could see drinking two or three of these, but definitely taking my time, sipping and enjoying the flavors. If you like a really sour beer, this one maybe a little too tame for you."
"Very nice drinking beer that has the tart characteristics that a Flanders Red should have, but is not overly sour (sorry sourheads). Well-balanced and easy to have 2 or 3. Glad this beer is readily accessible in so many places."
"Notes - Im a fan of the sour/tangy/dry beers and this one is right there. Great taste, easy to drink. Well done."
"D - I have enjoyed this brew for so long... Though this version is less sour than the Grand Cru, it is more consistently excellent; really every bit of the brew is perfection and archetype."
"Darker-than-copper brown, pretty hazy, los of rising carbination bubbles. Bubbly, cream colored head. Scent is kind of barny, sour, dark fruits. Pretty sour taste, kind of has an ""old"" taste as well. Taste becomes bigger as it warms, this beer should be served above the temp in your fridge. Different fruits-apples and grapes come to mind. Mouth is pretty active."
"Beer is light in body and mildly acetic, sweet on the front end and slightly tart on the back. Its highly drinkable and really nice. The other is considerably more sour but this is a perfectly serviceable beer."
"The beer pours a hazy brown-red color with a white head. The aroma is vinegar with some sweetness and some oaked notes. The flavor is a great mix of sweet and sour with some oak and vanilla notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Flanders Red."
"D-easy drinker right here, good sweetness balanced with a light note of vinegar, tartness and dark malt."
"This is the kind of sour that I could easily drink a few of. Lots of really good flavour but with a solid backing of refreshing tartness."
"Not heavily carbonated, but extremely refreshing."
"Quite a balance of sour/tartness and sweet maltiness, combined with the smooth mouthfeel this is one infinitely drinkable ale. Wonderfully well put together."
"Drinkability: Delectably drinkable and nicely quaffable. Good interplay between the sweetness and the sourness throughout. Works well as an apéritif as now I'm hungry. Sandwich anyone?"
"D: The low alcohol content makes this beer highly drinkable."
"D - Very good. This seems like a it would be a good introduction to this style of beer. I will be seeking out the other beers that Rodenbach makes very soon."
"Drinkability: Another nice intro sour from Rodenbach. I could certainly put down a couple glasses of this. I would get this again."
"D - This is truly a wonderful beer that's a classic example of the style if you see a bottle do yourself a favor and buy it"
"Not sure how much having this from a can made a difference. I drank from my Duvel Tulip but am curious and will try the bottle version before I drink the other can I bought."
"2006 vintage. Beautiful mahagony brown, amber tinted pour. Nice creamy beige head that resettles to about a half inch with a swirl of the glass. Yummy balsamic and port aromas. Taste is less than what the Grand Cru has to offer, but still nice. The balsamic notes and Sweet Tarts are all firing, but are more muted than the GC. Mouthfeel is slightly watery, but still very smooth. Drinkability is great. Definately a sessionable beer. While this is still a shadow of Rodenbach Grand Cru, it remains enjoyable and I am pleased to have a ready supply of this outstanding beer once again."
"kinda a yawn for me, just not that interesting."
"drinkability: ok - not my favorite"
"As far as Flanders reds go, this one is passable. It certainly sated my sour cravings -- at least for one night."
"Overall: Can't beat a good classic Flander's Red."
"I prefer the Grand Cru, this is an average Flanders Red, but It is cheap and easily available."
"Overall this is a classic Flanders red ale. If you like this style beer this is certainly worth a try."
"The pour is solid, mildly hazy deep red with a thin beige head that vanishes quite rapidly. The nose is quite excellent, a beautiful blend of vanilla, brown sugar, cherries, red wine and a little vinegar. Tannin character is quite low, this is fruity, tart and quite vinous. These flavors are replicated on the palate, opening vinous along with vanilla, cherries, brown sugar, and drying on the finish with a some vinegar. Medium-light in body with a moderate level of carbonation, this beer is just very very enjoyable and very refreshing. I've had aged bottles of this, and I have to admit, I like this better fresh."
"D - quite good. 4.0"
"The cataracts of beer pulse into my life, paste a delighted tongue and into my soul. The sour nature is bulbous, no sharp edges but fully present, hints of fresh fruit, fine wine, early apples and old love. This beer is truly a delight, candy for the soul."
"Overall, this is very drinkable. Wish I had some more."
"D: A very refreshing and mildly acidic Flanders Red. While the appearance might not be the most appealing, this is still a nice beer."
"Poured from a 750 ml. bottle that was caged and corked, into a pint glass. No freshness date on the bottle. About an inch of thin head that quickly disappeared. A small amount of carbonation. Color is a redish brown. Smells of malts and grapes. Sort of a sour grape like flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty watery. Does not have a very high drinkability to me. All and all I am glad I tried it, but would probably not reach for it again. Probably a brew a wine lover would enjoy more than me."
"Drinkability - This is a very enjoyable sour beer. Sour enough to accentuate the fruit flavors, but probably not sour enough to turn off people who aren't sour fans."
"D- Not as sour as some people make it out to be, though it is sour. It is not unbearable won't have you reaching for a handful of jellybeans to negate the bitterness. Very smooth and unique and I definitely would drink this with a nice roast, maybe even for leisure. I recommend this beer to everyone!!"
"The nose is strongly reminiscent of balsamic vinegar and flavorings are also found in taste. This is certainly a little acid following the fruity side but there is light. It collects woody notes. There is also this beer a little winey flavor that gives this side bittersweet highly characteristic. The finish, meanwhile, is quite sour but still very sweet. A beer with a nice balance and a unique taste but can easily divide the beer lovers. If the old logo mark was ""Hate it or love it", it was not for nothing."
"D: Pretty easy to drink for a sour. Could definitely have a couple of these if need be"
"Taste is tart, sour cherries and light vinegar, with a background of raisin-y sweetness to balance. Carbonation is good, and keeps the beer feeling very light in the mouth. VERY drinkable, you could just keep tossing this one back. The finish has good length, with faint wine-like viscosity."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a murky chocolate brown color with some reddish highlights. The aroma is of tart lemon and strong oak, which gives the aroma a wine like character. A touch of an raw sugar sweetness. Overall the aroma is not overly strong. The brew starts off tart and dry with lemon, grapefruit and oak flavors. These flavors melt away to a smooth and sweet malt, with some brown sugar and raisin. The transition of flavors is quite unique. The sour plays very nicely with the malt producing a strangely balanced beer. The feel is on the lighter side with soft carbonation, starts sour and ends sweet. The flavors work on you and by the end, this is quite the drinkable brew. Not a big fan of sour beers but I enjoy the balance in this one."
"Conclusion, this was a great beer, and I'd love to have it again."
"Though this might not appeal to everyone, it'd be great with dessert or pork. I'll pick up another bottle or two if I find any."
"Overall: can I say that this is a beautiful session flemish red? It doesn't knock you around to extremes, it just gives you a quaffable ale with an irresistable tartness."
"Notes: A classic! Certainly not an over the top sour beer. An excellent introduction to sour beer and an amazingly refreshing beer and amazingly drinkable for a sour beer."
"Eight dollars for ten ounces and worth every penny of it."
"D - nice easy intro to sour beers."
"~ Purchased this 750 ml bottle from Big Z Beverage in Huntington NY. This beer is dark amber in color with a decent head. Smell is complex, funky, and sour. Taste is the same. Absolutely refreshing! I could drink this all day long. Rodenbach is an intriguing brew and one that is definitely worth a try. ~"
"Drinkability: An incredibly drinkable beer. Sitting at 5% alcohol, a medium to thin body, notes of sour and tart, fruit and a little oak... well crafted."
"D: Good, a tasty easy drinking sour."
"The palate is a bit less, its thin in flavor. Very one dimensional, i get the balsamic and a bit of cheery, but not in any kind of nuanced or developed way. Very disappointing."
"Overall, another good beer from Rodenbach. Considering the Grand Cru is a dollar more a bottle I might stick to that in the future."
"The taste is sour, but not overly, it has enough sweetness to make this most drinkable. If you're thirsty, get yourself a Rodenbach, it is most refreshing."
"I will re-review this one once I gain a bit more perspective on the style. This is a handicapped review, but it will be good for going back on when I gain a wider breadth of knowledge."
"Very well balanced and easy drinking. Fairly mild flanders red."
"Pours a nice russet brown with strong ruby highlights and a compact off-white head, that diminishes to a film and leaves a few spots of lace. Sour fruit aroma, mixed in with sweet vinegar, oak and spice. Upfront sour cherries and apples hit first, but the sourness is restrained and kept in check by a light sweetness. Oak adds some spicy complexity to the middle of the brew before vinegar begins to assert itself in the finish. Well balanced, with increased drinkability for keeping the sourness in line. Light, thirst quenching mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. An interesting beer - highly drinkable without being exceptional. Grand Cru light?"
"Sour, dark, kind of sweet, and softly alcoholic."
"D: Not excited by this one. I've heard better things about the Grand Cru, so I guess that's what I'll pick up next time."
"M/D - Smooth and on the drier side of things. Medium body with excellent carbonation levels. All of the flavors play off each other very well making this a very drinkable beer."
"drinkability is very good - even though i split this 750ml i could have drank the whole thing"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, the 375ml is not big enough. This compared to the Grand Cru is better. I think I will like the Grand Cru more with age, it needs atleast 2 years in bottle."
"Very light mouthfeel."
"this one lacks a little in comparison."
"Truly an outstanding Belgian treat, this beer could be just as much ""session"" worthy as it is gourmet. If you pair a Rodenbach Classic with some Alaskan king crab, clarified butter, and a loaf of fresh bread, Bill Gates would not be able to top that (yes of course he probably could, but surely by now you get the point). I love everything about this beer. Enjoy"
"It smells and tastes sour, but way to sour."
"The reddish brown beer produces a creamy head that is a strange greyish brown color. The head does not stick around. A nice tartness dominates the nose, it smells refreshing. Surprisingly, the flavor is not that puckering, The sourness is balanced nicely by a touch of sweetness. The mouthfeel is a slight let down, a bit oily and I would like a bit more carbonation. Drinkability is, however, very high. Yummy, very yummy. The bottles are tiny, less than nine oz."
"Dark brown with a head that dissapears faster than my dogs at bath time. Smells of sour cherries, wood, and pepper. Has that distinctive worscestire smell of a Flanders red. Taste is tart, malty, and very, very smooth. Not too much of anything. Outstanding! Mouthfeel is slick but a touch thin. Drinkability is phenomenal. It goes down quickly. It's my new friend."
"750ml corked bottle served in a chalice. Bottle conditioned. Poured a dark copper with a quickly dissipating off white head. Lots of fruit in the aroma, mainly sour cherries. Not very carbonated, fairly light body. A little sweetness up front. Nice tart flavor with more fruit. Very drinkable. If you are new to the style, this would be a good starting point."
"Overall - I wouldn't normally choose a sour ale over a hoppy or malty one, but this certainly worth a try just to experience how a beer can taste so much like a kriek without using cherries."
"drinkability: very easy... I could session this at a nice dinner"
"drinkability:i like this beer ,its tasty and smooth the smell is bigger then the bite but don`t be turn of from this brew try it for yourself ."
"This is an excellent beer and benchmark to the style. There are other more sour/funky versions, but this is just a classic ale."
"Light tan head. The body of the beer is a dark red. Smell and taste is, of course, headlined by the sourness of the ale. The aroma of the oak comes across better than I thought it would. The taste has a certain fruity quality, like raspberries and raw rhubarb."
"Sat on this for a year. Thanks Linda."
"The taste is a little different and lighter, mostly lightly tart with a slight sweetness and only very light sourness, but with strong fermentd fruit - mostly a very strong character of turned raspberries - along with some toasty, very faintly buttery grain/cracker that peeks through in the aftertaste along with a hint of woody paper. The feel is light, zesty, and a bit fizzy. It's distinctve and holds up well with definite character, fairly refreshing and interesting, and fairly easy to drink but a bit one-dimensional, not really my style, and not something I would readily choose."
"Drinkability? Depends on your tolerance for a little funk in your beer. I'm not hugely into it, but it's agreeable enough with the sweet and sour chicken I'm having."
"3 M&3 D: to my surprise, the body and flavour are both much lighter than I expected; while this little brother retains a reasonably refreshing and crisp texture, it's outshined by the Grand Cru by a large margin in complexity and depth. If I've tried this beer more often than the Grand Cru rather than the other way round, I might've felt more at ease drinking this. But now that my palate is tamed by the sharper but much richer Grand Cru, I really find it hard to adjust to the milder version... not saying that it's not a decent and distinctive brew, though."
"Drinkability is high, there's a reason this is a world classic and benchmark example of the style. Also, due to it's light overall sourness, it's really a great introduction to sour ales. The low ABV also means that if you'd be able to session this if it wasn't expensive (and now rare, at least in the US, until import resumes)."
"I myself like a little more punch to the sides of my mouth in my sours. It takes a lot for me to pucker up and this certainly doesn't do it. However, it serves as a decent example of the style."
"Very specific taste. Don't advise drinking after a stout as I made the mistake of doing. Once I absorbed the initial shock the taste grew on me. Decent mouthfeel. A citrusy taste is the predominant overtone, hence the ""sour"". By the time I got to the last two swills I was a fan. Not for all tastes but highly recommended for those ready to explore."
"D: Very drinkable and at 5% you don't have to feel bad about drinking a whole one and wanting another."
"Tasty beer- makes me want to check out more of this style."
"Anything good? It LOOKED fantastic. Good lacing... That's about it."
"750ml bottle $7.49 at Beverage World in Ft. Oglethorp, GA. Bottom of the bottle is dated 28/11/07 so I hope it that was the bottled on date not the best by. Dark red bordering on brown with no head. Smells like sour, glue, vinegar, cherry cough syrup and a hint of wood. the flavor is nice with just a hint of sourness and a hint of lemon and glue ( I swear I didn't eat glue as a kid!). A very approachable sour/wild, much more so than La Folie or even the duchesse which might scare off the newbie."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, although the syrup-sweetness detracts somewhat and keeps the score from rising."
"D: If you're down with the taste, it slips down well. Red wine drinkers should appreciate these beers."
"250 ml bottle, simply called ""Rodenbach", courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.2%. Very dark reddish brown colour, moderate beige head. Nice aroma of red wine vinegar, sour cherries and farmhouse kitchen. The flavour is moderately sweet and sour, notes of musty fruit, funk and red wine vinegar. Some oak in the finish, minimal hops. Not nearly as complex, powerful and interesting as the Grand Cru, but okay."
"750ml bottle purchased at the liquor store in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours a murky, neary opaque brown-red with red highlights. Smells malty, fruity with some nut and banana. Tastes nutty, fruity, with some banana, and some nice acidity in the background. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with low carbonation. Despite the complexity, this beer is balanced, somewhat subdued, refreshing, and all-around pleasant."
"D: Not as overly tart and sour as some of the Flanders Red's that I've had which can be nice. Not quite as flavorful, either, though. Tasty and drinkable nonetheless."
"A nice, refined Flanders Red Ale. I really enjoy the tartness of Flanders Reds, and this beer mutes these flavors a bit with the oak-aged part of the beer's blend. The tartness is refined, the oak is refined, and I would prefer either flavor to be less refined and more forward. The mouthfeel is gently fizzy and sticks very pleasantly on the palate. The flavor is generally tart, in a fairly gentle way, with light sour cherries and oak notes in the background. There is a tiny bit of vinegary in the aroma. It's very drinkable, but, of course, it's not a cheap beer. If it was, I could have a number of them. Anyway, it's a very nice sour that is on the more easily likable end of sours."
"Rodenbach poured a very dark reddish amber color. Not much head. The smell was of super sour cherries. Tart and crisp. Taste matched the smell, tart and sour cherries. Enough to make my lips pucker. Mouthfeel was ok, a bit sticky at time. Drinkability was good. Overall I enjoyed this beer a lot. I am really enjoying this style of beer as well. Hope to try more."
"Body isn't heavy, but it has a presence, the aftertaste is fine, no nasty metallic feel or cardboard dryness here. Just those cherries."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"This is not available in my area, so if I were in another part of the country and saw it in a store, I'd buy a couple, sure. I just wouldn't go out of my way to search it out."
"Pours a clear dark red, ruby and brown highlights in the light, medium sized light tan head forms, quickly settles down to a medium ring around the glass, some lace spots, looks nice. Smell is great, very funky and sour, cherries, lots of fruit, bread/caramel, acidic, oak, sherry, a bit of oxidation, raisins, brown sugar, pretty neat. Taste is nice, well integrated, very smooth flavours, brown sugar and oak, some vanilla, sour cherries, fruit, red wine, grapes, light bit of acidity, very drying finish, more drying than I remember the Rodenbach Grand Cru being. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, nice sourness, light puckering tartness. Nice Flanders, smoother than the Grand Cru. I could definitely drink this one all night."
"Dark red pour with no head. Oaky, vinuous nose with a sour cherry lingering in the background. Very nice, smooth palate. Cherry, sour malt, and some champagne in the taste. Somewhat of a cheryy cobbler taste, but much sourer and with only a hint of brown sugar. Mildly acidic, but not overpowering."
"Pours a dark cherry red/ mahognay browncolor with thin, foamy off-white, slightly pink head. Sour aroma of cherries, oak and other dark fruit. A nice balance of sour and sweet with neiher to overpowering. Very tasty and refreshing with hints of sour cherry."
"Drinkability: While I would like more tartness and oaky complexity, this is very easy to drink"
"I might drink this again, but it is unlikely I will buy it again."
"I had two bottles in my stash and it took every ounce of my being to resist quaffing down the second bottle as soon as the first was finished."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a deep murky amber, almost purple color. A decent white head, but little retention. The aroma is quite complex; initially sour and woody, the sweet fruits and candies stand out also. The flavor is nice, but also very drinkable; an initial sourness, and lots of notice of the aging process, woody oak flavors throughout. The boy of the flavor is full of sweet chocolates and cherries, some light yeast also. The finish leaves quickly and clean. I found consuming a lot of this to be quite easy and fun. A good beer for sure."
"Taste is tart, very tart. Wow, this is hard. A woody taste under the tartness with a fake sweet sauce covering this all. A hard to drink beer with an artificial sweetness and a agrresive sour."
"Corked and caged 750mL bottle. There's a slight haze to the deep red/brown colour of this beer. A skim of fine beige bubbles and collar of rocky ones appeared after the pour and clung to the glass in spotty clumps during each sip. Earthy and tart aroma. Notes of tobacco leaf and wood, strawberries, mild acetic acid, sour cherries, and cotton candy. Same traits in the flavour, very well balanced. It finished with berry sweetness and acetic tartness with a dash of musty wood at the end. Medium bodied with smooth, airy carbonation and a lightly astringent dryness. Very easy to drink, even with the tartness present. A solid beer all around."
"D - Great session beer!"
"Drinkability: I have to say, I really enjoyed this a lot. This is a beer you could sip along with dinner (especially Italian food) the way you would a glass of wine. If you are a wine drinker of any kind, or a fan of red ales (and I am both), I strongly suggest you try this beer. At the very least, it will be like no brew you've ever had before."
"Drinkability is very solid, I enjoy the tart taste and smooth finish."
"Still, a good effort."
"Light, crisp, and refreshing with superb drinkability."
"Notes: This is a very complex and interesting beer. It is a slow sipper that is very enjoyable small amounts."
"Drinkability: Excellent, I could sip a couple of these all night. I will definitely have to try more Flanders Reds."
"Drinkablity: Very drinkable. A bit cheaper than Grand Cru so it is great for a session."
"3/21/08. I wanted to try a new style, read good things about Flemish Sour beers so gave this a try based on a recommendation. I was however quite skeptical after reading reviews. Vinegar? That doesn't sound appealing at all. So the beer pours a murky brown color with a small head. It does indeed smell and taste quite a bit like vinegar. The flavor is dark fruits with some cherry and vinegar. It is a little sour but not as sour as I was expecting. There is a winey presence about it. The finish and aftertaste is a bit weird and bland. Overall it's not horrible and easier drinking than I feared but I don't really like it. The first sip I had was a little gross but it grew a little on me. Still, I would have been perfectly happy with a small 12 ounce sample. As is I had a big bottle and halfway through I didn't even want to finish it. Of course I did finish it and honestly it was better as it warmed a bit. If I ever have it again I'll note to let it warm a little."
"D-Tartness takes some adjustment, but ultimately it is refreshing, with that subtle sweetness pulling me back for the next sip."
"This is my first Flanders Sour, and it's quite good. Very different, but not unapproachable. Would love to find more of this stuff."
"Another one bites the tart...an heir to the Flemish king, Grand Cru. Cola stripped of its sugar; replaced with dry lemon peel and yogurt zest. The sour squeeze is irresistable, never overstepping its boundaries. Kiwi burn and Cabernet alliance to create one of the most grandly mysterious, and overly erotic ales to bless the human race. Rodenbach sets a standard as well as an example to follow. Bravo!"
"The Rodenbach Flemish Sour ale is a treat to drink. This beer marches to the beat of its own drum. The deep reddish abyss of color is unlike any beer I have ever seen; a category of its own. A sour smell that stings the nostrils makes you question if this is a beer at all. Now for the drink, thick, lightly carbonated with a smooth mouthfeel that slides right down. A sour aftershock hits the palate with a vigor reminiscent of wine. This is the beer of the gods; let us drink and pray."
"D: This is like the training wheels of sour beers. Very good beer. The low ABV makes this a nice pseudo session beer. My lust for funky and or sour beers was sated for one evening. The hunger grows now..."
"D - I haven't had many sour beers, but to date this is the best one of the bunch that I have had. I actually finished off the entire glass."
"From the start I knew I wouldn't like this one very much. It was way too much like a wine than a beer. The thing that turned me off the most was how tart this beer was. I'm used to the more sweet and complex abbey ales so this was a real shock."
"Approachable yet still an interesting Flanders Red. Low ABV helps drinkability. I could not drink this everyday but it would be a nice change of pace every once in awhile."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this isn't usually the kind of beer that I drink a lot of, but this one was pretty decent."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Subtle fruity sweetness leads into flavors of tart cherries, red wine and balsamic vinegar. Light on the tongue, very refreshing and drinkable. Significantly less complex than the Grand Cru, but this is still an excellent brew. Good for a hot Summer day or paired with food."
"This is still a very drinkable beer, but it is noticeably the lesser of the magnificent Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"Served in my Delirium Tremens tulip. Poured an opaque purplish-brown with a 1.5 inch off-white head with copious ringlets. Head subsided to a half-inch cap within about a minute before eventually dissipating into a thin skim of foam that coalesced around the shoulders. Some spotty streaks of lacing with good retention. Nose had a vinous quality with sour cherries and a mild vinegar-like character detected towards the back. Tasted of sour grape juice and again, a mild vinegar quality, but not overpoweringly so, with a mild oakiness in the background. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and left a light tingle on the tongue and a pleasant dry, tart finish. I liked this much more than I anticipated, but this is definitely not for daily consumption in my opinion."
"A dense purplish brown body with a pencil-thin white head; intimidating yet beguiling... SOUR--but not sour patch--fresh and flowery... intense... light-bodied but the presence is apparent; clean (no tracing on the glass is proof), so much that the mouth could forget the experience seconds after... WOW: a tartness early, with sugary sweetness throughout--and yet a mellow, fizzy finish! The beer's as fun as it gets, pleasantly poppy and refreshing, especially on a humid evening such as this..."
"D- this is a style i could get used to. i expected something good, but this was almost mind-bending. thoroughly complex and sophisticated, like a lambic crossed with an english pale ale. not something i'd want to gulp down without noticing the subtleties, but i easily could. worth the money for me, and i will surely have several of these on hand at all times."
"Nice crisp refreshing Flemish red. Smell is sour cherries and funk, taste again the sour fruit with a significant presence of cider vinegar. Not as sweet as some of the Flemish Reds, but that helps the drinkability considerably. I would consider this the perfect beer to match to some seafood (mussels, clams, ...) for lunch on a hot day. If at all possible I would recommend getting the 6 pack over the 750ml as this is the perfect afternoon beer to have one or two of on a nice day."
"D: Refreshing and not one of the usual summer beer styles (wheat beers, etc.). Very drinkable and would imagine it would pair well with certain desserts (plain cheesecake for example). A different style than I am used to and certainly one I will return to in the future!"
"Drinkability? Three words: all . . . day . . . long."
"A fine example of a Flanders Red. It's got all the familiar characteristics that lovers of the style will enjoy, but it's mild enough that novices should not be put off. Perhaps not as complex as the Duchesse, but still very good. I can't wait to try the Grand Cru. Recommended."
"I love to drink the sours on a hot day. It is very refreshing and I finished the bottle with no problem at all."
"I must admit I did not like this at first, but the taste kind of grows on you as you drink more of it which I truly respect. Very drinkable and highly recommended if you are looking to try something new."
"The body is moderate, a bit fuller than what I'm looking for but still good. Carbonation is present but not over powering. Overall a great beer for sure."
"Taste: almost like it smells with a mellow sourness backed with dark cherry and a tinge of alcohol and sweetness. In a word, ""complex."" Don't drink this too cold or you'll lose out on its nuanced silkiness. Not a fan of Lambic/fruity-styled beers, but this I liked."
"D - Awesome, I enjoyed this much more than the Duchesse. I will be getting another for sure."
"Wonderful brew!"
"D - Very good Flanders Red. Low alcohol means you can really do some damage. Want something funky and quenching? Drink a 750 of this."
"Palate is right up there with Duchesse du Bourgogne - hard to distinguish. Passion fruits, pleasant vinegary sour note, and a slight soapy component on the finish (yes, my glass is clean)."
"Pours a very deep ruby color, almost opaque with a nice big red tinged head at first but quickly dissapates. Smells like straight sour apple, some oak and black cherry, very intense. (This one may be turned, it is well out of date and I am only trying it to sell if it is still sellable at the ABC Liquors I work at.) According to the bottle though it says a ""sharp bouquet."" Taste is a bit bland (as I said it is out of date by a year!) but still has a sour apple and mild oak to it. Very metallic aftertaste and virtually no carbonation. Doesn't taste skunked so this may be its true taste. The sour taste isn't too overpowering and yeilds some sweetness on the palate. I believe this one is still salvagable!"
"This is my first experience with the style, and I have to say I like it very much. This would make a great alternative session beer, but its pretty one-dimentional, and lacks the complexity I normally look for."
"Had this on tap at Summits in Snellville, GA a while ago. Poured a ruby red tinted with dark brown. Slight head that faded to a ring. Quite acetic on the nose and with aromas of muscadine grapes, tart currants, and some muskiness as well as vinegar. Taste is similar, and and quite tart on the finish but slightly more mellow up front. There is a nice bitterness that helps temper the acetic qualities as well, and also some tart raspberry throughout. Mouthfeel is smooth and sour, leading this to be quite a refreshing beer. Not as complex as the Grand Cru, but simple and quenching."
"I think this beer would nicely cut through a fruit laden cheesecake or any high fat dessert that also has fruit. I've never had anything like this beer before."
"Drinkability- Very to be brutally honest. Tart, but doesn't pucker your mouth. Leaves you wanting more with a short lived aftertatse and has a nice low abv for drinkability...plus the added fact that it's to the point with it's cherry flavor."
"D-It's drinkable, but I'll pass. I'm not too familiar with this style, and it's interesting, but it's not for me."
"Very tasty, an after dinner brew for me. This was my first try at a Flanders Red and it hit the expectations, but I need to expand my tastes in this variety so I can get a better grasp on this unique brew."
"D- pretty good, nice easy to get sour ale for a good fix"
"I'm not in love. I much prefer the Grand Cru or a Duchesse. Still a tasty beer but if I'm going out of the way for the style, I'll look for others first."
"This really puts the Duchesse to shame. Try with artisan cheese, grilled meats (duck), or even Chinese food."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D: No matter how much i like the taste i can't get through more than one..."
"Smooth fine texture, and very drinkable."
"The only red in the beer is found in the hues of this tawny brown creation. Sour funk in the smell, and a smell that's tamed. The flavor seemed a little muted by the carbonation that hits the tongue, but the balance is good. The sour and tart taste is pleasant, no question about that. It's the low amount of overall flavor though, that's reflected in the taste score I'm giving it, that keeps it from being a highly recommended pick. Nonetheless an interesting beer in an interesting style."
"Humboldt Fog made for an interesting pair with this. The low acidity seemed to cut the creamy richiness, with a lingering farmhouse aftertaste of the cheese."
"I have been slowingly getting into sour beer and this was a very good mildly sour and sweet beer. It poured out with no head and a beautiful reddish brown color. You could feel the carbonation tingling your mouth and the taste was very good. This is a must try for people trying to get into more complex beer."
"Pours a dark ruby hued brown that has no head. Nose is a pretty smooth mix of wood and fruit. Flavor has that sour tone to it and definite fruit and wood as well. Smooth feel with a low but biting carbonation. Nice to drink, but you'd have to be able to appreciate the style to really enjoy this one."
"Pours a nice red brown color. Bubly but very little head. Apple vinegar aroma, but not overwhelming and even a tad sweet. Very tingly but not too intense carbonation. Lightly sour taste with apples and cherries. One of the most drinkable sour ales I've tried. Not particularly exciting (it's missing the complexity and tart-ness of many of these beers), but still an enjoyable beer and probably a good introduction to this unusual (and, to some, shocking) style."
"I have read many reviews/posts/forums/etc. about how this isn't the beer it once was. That may be true, but I never had that version. All I can say is, holy cow, I love this beer!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately carbonated, but the finish is too sticky and unclean. Pretty drinkable nonetheless."
"I enjoy the Rodenbach Grand Cru much more but this is still one of my favorites."
" I really enjoy this style and find it really easy to drink and enjoy."
"Poured a dark reddish brown. The smell is mildly tart. The taste is also tart with some red grape fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smoother and less spritzy than their Grand Cru. This beer is not as intense as the Grand Cru and is a fine sour beer."
"This one poured ruby, with a beautiful color and cloudiness from all angles, but there was absolutely no head in any way, shape, or form. The smell was yeasty, with both grapes and vinegar showing up strong. The taste was extremely tart and extremely fruity and in a lot of ways reminded me more of Strongbow than any other Flanders Red I've had. It had a more severe bite than I personally prefer, but it was still pretty smooth going down. Frankly, I think this one was okay, but if another Flanders Red was available, I'd take that instead."
"D: The alcohol is nice and low, eluding detection throughout the glass. The slight tartness is welcome and the fruitiness from the spontaneous fermentation and aging is quite enjoyable."
"This is a wonerfull example of the style. Quite complex, yet well balanced and pairs well with many dishes. Best with some strong cheese, nuts and fresh fruit. Also a nice palate cleanser between courses for any fine meal."
"D - Have to be careful with this one. Very drinkable, kinda reminds me of the cough medicine dimetapp, but sweeter."
"ok, before i get panned for the low scores, let me just say that either the rest of you are lemmings scoring it high because you think you should, or you just enjoy this really unique, challenging style of beer. i wanted to like this beer. i tried to like this beer. i didn't like this beer. it poured beautifully: on-tap at 3F's pub, a deep reddish amber, mostly clear, with a super-thick, rocky, creamy, big-ass lasting pinkish head and lacing. nose was of cherries/berries and acetic sourness along with some musty barnyardy aromas. taste was sweet upfront dominated by sourness. kinda like drinking turned/old juice. light bodied, spritzy, with a drying, sour finish. tastes more like a sparkling rose wine that beer. no hop presence per the style. this might go well with a cherry pie."
"750 ml bottle. I picked up two bottles of this and two of the Grand Cru from Healthy Spirits in San Francisco. I've had the Cru before, but I should drink them back to back for real fun. In any case, while this isn't quite as good as the Grand Cru, the 'regular' Rodenbach is reasonably close, giving you about 70% of the Grand Cru experience. A because it has a bit lower ABV, the Rodenbach makes it a better session beer. Like the Cru, this is a defining example of the Flemish Red style."
"Poured from a 250ml bottle from PP bottle shop into a new belgium snifter. Poured a brownish red color with a thin head that faded like a soda pop head. Smell is a faint sour cherry smellwith hints of wild yeast sourness. Taste is a little more foward but still not very powerful with cherry, raspberries, a slight oak vanilla flavor, and of course a slight tartness. The mouthfeel is medium body with a moderate carbonation. This is a very drinkable sour red ale which makes it a classic but with some many extreme and well crafted sour reds out their I would say just above average and not the very best of the style."
"Some of this finally made its way to SD and I was fortunate enough to get a pour of it at O'Briens. Poured a very reddish brown with very little head and a light carbonation. Only a slight lacing. The aroma immediately hit me with cherries, both sour and fresh. There is a definite vinegar presence but not overpowering like some examples of the style. Possible hints of oak as well. The taste is incredible. Dominated by tart cherries, some vanilla and minimal vinegar that only helps the balance. Also some ripe apple. The mouthfeel is nice and coating, allowing even the smallest sip to linger. It's actually a very refreshing example of this style and the more I get to know it the Flanders Red is becoming more of a friend than an acquaintance. Really want to try the Grand Cru now as I heard it's much better."
"D: A very smooth and silky drink with a great gentle sourness makes for a good desert beer."
"D: Delicious, I could have another, but it isn't really a session beer, especially not at $7 a glass."
"Had heard a lot of great things about this beer and the people at O'Briens were ranting and raving about it a few days ago, so I had to see how it was for myself, very good for the price, would drink again in the future, want to try their Grand Cru because I have heard that is even better"
"My first Flanders Red. poured out into a flute, billowy head, lacy retention. Nice dark-tea color. Big aromas of raspberries,cherry, fruits,wood aromas. Flavor is exactly what what I was hoping for. Tart, apple-like. Crisp, dry finish. A little vinegary, but thats what I expected. This beer would make a great apertitif as opposed to the common glass of champagne. will definatly buy again. I really enjoyed this beer, makes a great start to a round of reviews."
"D: I really dug this beer, would like to have it again, but it was $7 for about 8 oz. so it will have to be a rare treat."
"The aroma is right on style-wise. Very similar to Duchese. Horse blamket and very sour aroma. Next to zero head and gone in 60 seconds. Dark puple-brown color. Initial flavor is heavy sweet as is the finish, which iis a good thing. I would buy more of this, but it's not as readily available as the Duchese."
"This beer pours a dark ruby color. The head is small, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of sweet and sour cherries, oak, and hints of vinegar. The taste is sweet with a tart sourness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a fine Flemish Red. I will certainly drink this again."
"An excellent example of the Flanders Red style. often imitated but never duplicated. The beer has a red almost burgandy color to it. A generous tannish head sits atop that body. The flavors hits you with a genorous helping of sour/sweet while ending in a balanced malt profile. A classic example of the style."
"I would also note, the barmistress stated firmly that the alcohol content was 4.8 percent, and not 5.0 percent as advertised. She knew her stuff."
"I am not sure why I have not tried this brew before since i really do like the Flander brews and the sour aspect of them. This brew poured to a color that has a red tone to a brown profile. had a nice light tan colored head that holds for a bit. The aroma shows of its tart/sour side from the get go with a nice fruit mix. I know that this is a blend of brew that was in Oak but I am not sure if I am or am not picking up the oak notes. While I like the aroma, to me it seems to be more one dimensional than I would like. The flavor of course highlights the fruit and sour profile but to me seems to be a little more harsh with a stronger acidic note than I would like to see. Again just like with the Aroma I am not picking up the properties that I would expect from a being aged (part of it) in oak. To me this is a solid brew, like this type of brew but in my book it is not in the same book as Mestreechs Aajit, Monks or Duchesse. I would get this brew again but would reach for these others before this one, just mu opinion."
"If you are big on wine, and sour patch kids, then you are going to like this. Looking at the review, people do like it. Hats off to you."
"Nice to finally try this beer. Body really has a nice reddish color to it with a nice head as well. The head fades pretty quickly. The aroma has a sharp edge to it, but a lot of nice fruity smells in the as well. Flavor is sharply sour at first, but more of the malt profile comes through as you sip. Mouthfeel is ok, but seems a little thin. Drinakbility is also OK. I enjoy it, but I couldn't see drinking more than one of these in a sitting."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with one-finger head. Aroma is nice and sour upfront with fruitiness showing through that's reminiscent of sour apple in some ways. Taste is somewhat sour upfront and fades with a mild pucker towards the back of the throat. Again, it reminds me of sour apple in some ways. Not too sour either. I've never really had many sour ales but I would say that this one is a good introduction to the style it claims to represent. Very drinkable too!"
"D: would recommend as an intro to sour beers from now on. Have always shy'd away from the funk but my now be a little more open for experimentation."
"Don't drink and review."
"very fine example of a flemish sour ale and i can understand why it is the standard. i thoroughly enjoyed it, but i still prefer the duchesse."
"Obviously a staple for the Flanders Red style. Pleasantly tart but not over the top; very well rounded."
"Mouthfeel is fine here but not as good as other flemmish ales I have had. Still for the price, it's a good buy."
"Drinkability - Really good for a beer of this character. It is definitely not a beer that everyone would like, but if you are into this type of brew it is really easy drinking, really tasty and goes down very smooth."
"The beer seemed overly carbonated and felt that way. It was almost like drinking a less sweet cherry cola. I wasn't overly impressed, but it wasn't bad. It was easy drinking, but mainly because there weren't any overpowering flavors."
"I'm not the biggest sour ale connoisseur, but this one seems pretty mild. Not overly sour or sweet, a bit lighter than expected."
"D - Very tasty....one of my tops Flanders sours....maybe only second to The Duchess."
"Drinkability : Archétype des oud bruin"
"D - Not something for every day drinking but a beer that I'll be drinking again for sure."
"Nice, low key sort of garnet color. Decent level of carbonation. Quite fruity and somewhat funky aroma-sour cherries. Fairly sour upfront but not offensivly so. Moderate fruit flavor. Slight woody taste. Good mouthfeel-tends to be a bit sweet in the finish. Very nice and enjoyable beer. I havnt had very many sour beers. Really liked this one overall."
"Pours a dark mahogany color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy head, tiny islands left behind. The nose is sour, tangy, cherry/raspberry, and some malts. The taste is sour/tangy, lots of cherry/raspberry, there's some funk going on in there. Medium body. Drinkable, not that impressed with this one, I've had way way way better Flanders in the past."
"Interestingly, contrary to what I expected, the on-tap version seemed a bit better."
"Red body, hints of a more cherry oak color. The head is pretty thick, but only about 1/2 inch tall, off-white in color. I could smell this from across the room: huge raspberry, black currant and lemon scents. The taste is mostly lemon and hops, with raspberry and black currant coming through on top of it all. The carbonation kind of pops in your mouth, very tart and tangy, but the sweetness keeps it in check. This is a very refreshing and wonderful beer, but definitely not for everyone, or every night..."
"Light body with sharp prickly carbonation. Very dry. Refreshing. I haven't had a lot of sour beers and I don't generally think they are all that, but they can be nice when I'm in the mood. Rodenbach is the first I've had that I could imagine myself really getting into."
"drinkability is great for wine-lovers. brew-lovers will also appreciate the smoothness and subtle flavors at work here. this is a great example of a flanders red and an excellent brew to try. cheers!"
"I could see how others may not like it, myself personally however, I found it to be quite a lovely treat. I was quite amazed with it actually; it has such unique character. And even more to its credit, I doubt the one bottle I had was enough to really understand this beer, to fully experience its character. I must revisit."
"Sweet-sour flavors. Again, quite different from anything I've ever had, but not in a positive way. The body is the best part of the beer."
"The taste is sweet, tarty and sour. With hints of fruits and spice. The finish lets me know I am drinking something good, it grabs hold and does not let go."
"D-This is tasty indeed."
"I was lucky enough to try this beer at a tasting with a Duvel representative, so I got a taste of both the beer and the history. The beer itself was like nothing I've had before. A crisp dark red color with a red-tinted, creamy head. The smell was sour and fruity, letting you know that you're in for something different. Hated it at first taste. Got used to it by the second. Loved it by the third. A unique, pwoerful sour, acidic taste, with cherries and grapes as the dominant taste that goes with the malt. It was almost more like a wine than a beer. Full, delicious, and unique. As far as the making of the beer, I learned that: 75% of each bottle is freshly made, while 25% is front a pervious batch; there are 20 types of yeast in the beer; it is aged 2-3 years in oak barrels. Not your typical ""beery"" kind of a beer, but definately worth adding to your repertoire."
"Amazingly my first try of this beer its not a style I seek out much but this is a classic,poured into a large tulip glass a mix of brown a cherry red a light fluffy sticky light brownish colored head atop settling into a creamy-like mass leaving spotty lace.Big tart cherry in the nose with underlying vanilla and oak a iron not is present as well but its somewhat faint,somewhat spritzy mouthfeel light and drinkable.Starts out with a big tartness that wakes you up after that some toastiness and oak shows thru into the finish the puckering tartness is always there it never really totally leaves.A nice complex but refreshing beer it is a classic for a reason."
"D: Never had this style before, this beer is definitely worth trying. I think it would be great for a hot summer day. Recommended."
"I'm a fan of this style, and this might be the best example I've had. It has a nice amber-cherry color and that classic aroma with a hint of barnyard (yes, that's a good thing) and some sourness. The initial flavor is sour cherry and some orange peel, with some floral qualities and a clean tartness that sparkles on the tongue. What pluses this for me is the finish, which had a faintly bitter crispness. Both complex and refreshing"
"Overall: A good Flemish ale, a bit subtle, perhaps due to age? It was consumed fully 3 months beyond the best by date, though Im not sure what affect if any that would have had. Not my favorite within style by a long shot; it was too mellow and undefined for my tastes."
"D: This is a standard in my beer drinking repertoire. Everyone I meet who has never had a Flemish Sour is amazed that I drink it, as it turns off a lot of people. But I find it an excellent change of paste from other styles of beer."
"D - First Flanders Red I've tried, it's not bad I guess. Usually I find sour beers too sour but this one was okay. Probably wont have again though."
"I love this beer and could drink it all night. Sometimes it seems a bit light to me (possibly the differing meals I'm drinkng it with), but the complexity of flavors and oveall balance is fantastic. I like the level of sourness for an ""everyday"" beer, but wouldn't mind more sourness on occasion, possibly the Rodenbach Grand Cru will accomplish that but I've not been able to hunt that down yet. While looking I won't mind drinking this one.. possibly even daily after Ironman Lake Placid."
"Pours a reddish brown with an adequate off-white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma reminds me of champagne and green apples. Cider vinegar. A little sour candy in there too. Very interesting brew. The taste is pleasantly sour, and contains hints of all the previously mentioned aromas along with the background malt. Slightly watery. Overall, it's good, but just doesn't quite flip my pancake."
"D- This was good and a unique brew. I will have it again. The smell kinda turned me away and one every once in awhile is probably good enough."
"D - Although I can respect where this is coming from, and I may actually buy it again for it's outstanding complexity and uniqeness, I would not care to drink this on a regular basis. Drinking more than one in a sitting is out of the question due to the tongue-scathing acidity."
"Body is a touch thin, but it is still a good beer."
"Drinkability: So refreshing. So tasty and unique. Highly drinkable."
"Poured into a Rodenbach glass a very deep amber, with a very nice white lacing on the glass. It has a sweet aroma and the taste is all about tartness and dark fuits, even so small. This is one of those special occasion beers, not an everyday kind of thing, even though it is fantastic."
"D: Quite easy to drink, light in body, ABV, etc. Has a fresh, clean sweet/sour quality that makes it as good to drink on a warm day as a cool one. A nice apertif/digestif, too."
"Pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. The aroma is dominated by cherries with a candy sense to it. The taste is almost like a sweet wine with some malt characteristics. An interesting blend of cherry and grape flavor with a slight sweet malt presence. The beer is somewhat heavy due to the fruit bitterness. The bitterness definitely makes this one a sipper. This is a very unique brew, but nothing I'd seek out that often."
"Being my first venture with this style wasn't really prepared for what I got when I poured it into the glass. Poured a slightly reddish brown color. Light head with plenty of lacing. Smelled of Cherry and Raspberry with a back note of vinegar.Taste comes on first with a sour vinegary note that is not overpowering but definitely let's you know it's there. Smooths out after initial taste to reveal fruits of cherry and wood tones. Nice pleasant aftertaste that has more of a malt characteristic. Some nice carbonation and silky mouth feel. As I said first time trying this style but won't be the last. Thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Overall: this was one of my first ventures into the style, and I loved it. I have had a few of the New Glarus beers made with souring yeasts, and this was atleast as good as them. I liked how the sourness remained balanced and let the other flavors shine when they were suposed to."
"Overall this is a very unique brew. The several stages in flavor lead to a nice complexity. I would not go out of my way to get this again, but it is definitely worth a try and I will again soon, I'm sure."
"Overall - A pretty good Flanders Red.. Not quite up there with the Duchess de Bourgogne but certainly recommended..."
"Pours a nice homogeneous shade of mahogany. Decent 1/2 inch fizzy head that disperses into a very thin ring. This appears to be light and crisp with a very wine-like oak aroma. Beyond the sour tones up front you can smell a light sweetness in the background. Sour cherries, raisins, and grapes. The taste is tart up front with a flood of unripened cherries and a slight tweak of malt. It then drops off slightly into a very mild pure carbonated water taste. Very strange flavor profile. Not quite sure what to make of it yet. I'm relatively sure that this isn't my kind of thing. I have tried Duchesse De Bourgogne a while back not knowing that it was a Flanders Red Ale and I remember it having a more full flavor and more continuously rich flavor profile. This one sort of drops off in such an abrupt manor. Not enough alcohol for the oak aging to really do much for IMHO. Overall, I was glad I tried more than one of this style for relativity if nothing else. Quite an interesting style, maybe I'll try the Grand Cru in a couple of weeks to see if the extra alcohol brings something better to the table."
"Beautiful example of an exceptional style."
"Very dark brown color with a beige cap thats pretty slim. Dominant vinous nose with some oak and a slight molasses sweetness. Dry, bitter canvas for its bold flavor of fermented berry tartness, burnt grains. Displays some yeastiness but one sided, could have used more depth here. As is warms fig and prune notes come out and all the flavors start to blend together for a smoother, balanced flavor. Finishes dry with a light fruitiness and slight tartness. Full body and an even mouthfeel. Carbonation is low but exerts just enough crispness to make it quite enjoyable."
"The beer pours a dark red body with an off white head that leaves a little lacing. The aroma and taste go hand in hand with a sharp sour fruit notes that are quite pleasant. The carbonation dances on the touch with a slight cheek puckering sour tartness. The beer is a pleasure to drink and very refreshing."
"This is a new style for me, so the flavor profile was a little unexpected, but it was definitely a good surprise. The appearance is a very dark red brownish color and there was very little head with a gentle pour from the bottle. A very good looking beer. The beer smells fruity with hints of apples and grapes. The apple and grape smells follows in the taste which is fruity with the hint of sour for which this style is named. The sour flavor is present although not overpowering or unpleasant in any way. This lends well to the drinkability. I could have a few of these."
"re-review 1/24/13-11.2 oz bottle, 5.2% ABV. Apparently filtered. 75% young, 25% 2 year. I've found that the flavor now is quite restrained compared to my prior review, and the metal flavor is quite strong, interfering with the enjoyability of the beer. Now, I much prefer the grand cru. The mouthfeel and body are quite light. I'd have a hard time drinking more than 3 of these, which would give me a pretty bad case of heartburn. The current rating is what I think of this beer as of this review."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both exceptional. Previous problem with Grand Cru aleviated with acquisition of a case. Now I need a case of this too."
"D - Overall I would have to say this was not bad at all. My first taste of a sour ale was not really to my liking but this has intriqued me a bit more. This was much much better. I actually really enjoyed sipping on this while I was easting dinner and has opened me up to some more of the style. Definalty a sipper due to the strongness."
"Overall: Definitely an interesting brew. Huge sour and tart notes, so expect over the top. Worth a shot if for nothing but curiousity's sake."
"d - the more i drink this beer the more i am liking it. not very familiar with the style but this is starting to become one i'll look for every now and then."
"Drinkability - this is good, but not great."
"This is a beer that is put together pretty well. It's worth having for its unique character, and fairly easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is deceptively light due to the high carbonation, and drinkability is..ehh."
"D - Great. I actually ordered two of these in a row because they were so good. I won't hesitate to have this again."
"Poured a slightly hazy red amber with a light tan head that slowly dropped to a half-inch and stayed. Aroma was crisply sour, sour milk and cherry, pungent but clean. Taste is acidic fruit with malty undertones and a chewy finish. Tastes like another! (If only it wasn't so damn expensive. . . )"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were both good. Thus far, the highlight of my beer drinking day."
"Funk, yet refined this was a great beer to try. Not overwhelming like a few lambics I've tried, but still nothing a great example of the style. The wood character was evident along with very tart cherries, grapes and apples. Flavor was subdued at first until the beer warmed up. Reminds me of La Folie with a bit more fruit but not as rich in flavor."
"Mouthfeel was very zesty at the beginning and smoothed way out toward the end as it warmed. Medium to light bodied. I would love to drink this one again in the future."
"Appearance more brown but with a red tinge. Good head and lacing. Utterly amazing aromas with sour cherries and chocolate (Cherry Ripe), some marzipan in there as well. To taste, very tart and sour. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery, but perfect tingly fine carbonation."
"Pours a dark red-brown with a nice head that dissipates quickly. The smell is very fruity. Taste is similar - very fruity with a sweet taste up front and then a nice sour bite that's not overwhelming. The sourness and carbonation provides a great mouthfeel and feeling on your tongue. The fruitiness of this beer makes it almost like a sour carbonated wine."
"the flaovr is pretty rich and complex, malty yet not to heavy, just enough sweetness to off set the sour, fruity and applilish, sour and sharp but not over the edge. i think this beer would go well with a good beligian mussles."
"While this beer might be somewhat harsh on its own, it is a nice appetizing beer that would go well with rich, creamy cheeses and sourdough bread."
"Overall, this is very, very easy to drink, especially if you like the sour styles. Me, I'm a big fan of Flanders Red, Berliner Weiss, etc. This drinkability, however, comes at the expense of character. After all, water is pretty high on the drinkability list too. This one isn't devoid of character by any means, but it could be so much more. Many other examples of intentionally sour beers are out there, and many are better than this. This is mild enough, in fact, that I'd say it would be a great beer to introduce others to the style, before moving on to sour brews with more ""oomph"". Good, and recommended, but could have been so much more."
"A good showing for a flanders red and if you're in to the style you would probably love it. Avoid if you aren't in to the whole sour fruit beer scene."
"Poured out a dark cranberry color with thick foamy head that thins out quickly but laces nicely. The nose smells strongly of cider, with caramel and spiciness. The taste has an initial sour apple flavor with a dryness that turns into sweet caramel maltiness in the middle. It finished with a sour cherry like taste and moderate dryness. The mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Light body, medium carbonation."
"Drinkability - Wow. I want more of this. The suprising feature of this beer is the low alcohol content. This makes for a beer that would pair well with a nice steak to be savored over the meal. I would highly recommend this beer as an excellent representation of the style."
"Rodenbach Classic is a disappointment. I've come to enjoy this style and was expecting an explosion of tart, funky, oak-accented fruit... and didn't get it. I don't remember where I finally located a bottle, but from now on, whenever I get the urge to drink a beer of this style, I'll be content with the Monk's Flemish Sour Red that I can get mere minutes from my front door. Here's hoping that Rodenbach Grand Cru blows the roof off the joint."
"D = Very drinkable."
"Quite a remarkable drink. I would drink one glass as an aperitif. I couldn't have it as a session beer."
"As the beer warms a bit, there is a much more earthy flavor coming out. It really gets woody after it sits for a while. After you have been sipping this beer for a little while, there is a noticeable acidity that lingers on the back of the throat much like a Stout beer, but without the coffee like aftertaste. It leaves a cherry-like impression to linger for some time. This is a nice beer. It is nice to have a beer that is this light on the alcohol, yet still this big on flavor."
"I found this to be a really disappointing beer. Aroma wasn't bad, but the overwhelming sourness once I tasted it turned me right off. Reminded me of drinking apple cider and had apple cider vinegar overtones. It was a chore to drink a 10.5 oz glass of this."
"I usually keep some of this on hand in my cellar, and I'm always glad for it. For me, this is a classic, a really unique beer. One of my favorite comforting beers."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Try if you want to experiment. Not for all tastes. Drinkable, don't get me wrong, but in limited quantities."
"The first time I had it was about '98, when the waitress brought me one when I had ordered a St. Rogue Red. I tried it just to be a good sport, but sent it back. I tried it again over the next few years and hated it every time. Funny, now it's one of my favorite styles, and I was excited about it after it had not been available in the US for some time. Now I can't wait to crack open my Grand Cru!"
"Notes: After being disappointed with a bad bottle of Grand Cru (tasted like carbonated vinegar), I was ever so pleased with this beer. Wonderful flavors with a great level of tartness. I will get this beer again without a doubt."
"This is a fine sour ale. I consumed the 750 with no effort. Need to pick up another one of these...."
"I've been wanting to try the Rodenbach beer's for quite awhile now but been unable to find em. Yesterday I was in Eugene, OR at the Bier Stein and ran across some much to my delight. 275 ml bottle poured into my New Belgium Globe glass a dark amber color with a small head that laced up fairly quick. Looks great. Smell is of tart cherries, oak, and just hint of vinegar sour twang. Smells awesome. Taste was not a let down, cherries, oak, rich malts, hint of wheat towards the end with a pleasently refreshing sour finish. Mouthfeel was smooth, a bit sticky, and tart. Really pleasent. Man if I could get this stuff in town I would drink it all the time. I absolutely love it. This is a brew that can be enjoyed on a hot afternoon to refresh you, or as a dessert for after dinner."
"Big downfall is appearance, which is a murky, not very attrative brown. However, it does pour with a nice head which maintains as a purplish ring throughout. A good aperitif."
"A wonderful beer and a great example of the style. It doesn't have the slightly metallic taste that some others in the style show."
"The beer poured a lightly hazed deep red-brown. The head started out about an inch in height, but it dissipated pretty quickly like a glass of soda but left some spotty, wildly patterned fine lacing around the inside of the glass. The nose is complex and intensely - dare I say it - almost intimdating at first: fairly heavy oak tones with numerous fruits with a fairly heavy dose of a tart quality to it. The flavor itself initially is a subdued oaked-woodiness that is followed by the substantial lactic/sourness and pocedes to multiple layers of oakiness as the flavor itself feels like it spreads outward from the direct center of the tongue. The mouthfeel is full, but it's dangerously drinkable and enjoyable. I am quite surprised that something of this quality if fairly easy to come across here in town; although, don't allow my surprise to be anything to prevent someone from trying this. I will probably return soon enough."
"Pours a murky orangish-brown with a hazed clarity. One finger of dense, pale tan foam holds well and leaves spotty lacing. A complex aroma of cidery farmhouse yeast , some background peach/apricot fruitiness, and a musty french oak with toasted malt overlapping. Caramel taste briefly sweetens the flavor, followed by a malt vinegar bite. Aftertaste is tart and dry, with a funky belgian yeast flavor, and lingering sourness. No hops to speak of, but this balances fine without. A crisp, medium-high carbonation and medium body accentuate the acidic kick, and produces a very lively mouthfeel. Finishes pleasently tart and highly drinkable. If you're you're into the brett. thing, this is for you."
"The caramel sweetness took a lot of the edge off this one and made it very easy to drink."
"Last swigs: Tart red apple sour sipper. A true classic."
"Very crisp and refreshing. For a light bodied beer this has an exceptional fullness to the mouthfeel without being oily or filmy. Easily sessionable. I could drink this stuff all day long. It has a really nice tie between the mouthfeel, complexity of tastes, and drinkability."
"Grab this one if you can get your hands on it, it is an excellent value. 75% fresh ale, 25% aged in oak."
"Easy to drink, but the flavor did take a bit of getting used to. I'd drink this again."
"Cheers!"
"This beer pours deep mahogany with a fluffy off white head, nice lacing and retention. The smell is woody and sour/tart vinous fruits. The taste reminds me first of a gueze or a lambic but not quite as sour/tart. There is also a slightly preceptable flavor of woodiness. The mouthfeel has a strong body without being overwhelming. The carbonation is also nice. There is also a nice amount of dryness. Overall, highly drinkable, a lovely beer. A great one to mix it up with for something a little different."
"My first dive into ""sour"" ales. Poured a dark reddish-brown with a tan head that left some lacing behind. The smell is unlike any other beer I have had. Sour vinegar with some dark fruits and a sweeter bubble gum like scent. The taste is ... wow ... sour! I know I should have expected it but it hit me hard. It's like someone stuffed some cherries into a bottle of apple cider vinegar. This may be true to style but it's not for me. I gave it a 3 because I am assuming that is how it should taste. Well...it was an interesting experience for sure, but I had to feed this one to the sink."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light body. The beer has a very crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. This beer is a definate thirst quencher. I will definately be partaking of Rodenbach again. This is just a very solid sessionable beer."
"Pours a very dark red color with a tan head. Smell is tart and sour cherries. Taste is surprisingly crisp and refreshing! Sour and tart fruit dominate the taste that finishes incredibly dry and crisp. This brew has an extremely high drinkability. Even though I recommend the Rodenbach Grand Cru slightly higher, this is an absolutely wonderful brew."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Overall: My only complaint is that this beer could be a little more sour."
"I'm glad Palm started importing. Super complex, refreshing, and fun."
"not more than one glass, but very impressive"
"For muggy summer evenings, forget the IPA's and wheat beers. This is the one! Very refreshing and ridiculously drinkable."
"I am beginning to love these sour and tart beers especially in the warmer weather. This one is super drinkable, quenching, and enjoyable. I will be back to this throughout the summer."
"Drinkability: unbelieveably drinkable; you just want to keep going back to the well with this one. Undeniably a stunning example of the style. Worth every penny and a beer I will constantly be on the lookout for from now on."
"A nice example of the style and worth trying if you would like to sample a Flanders Red Ale."
"reddish amber color, with a foamy collar. nice color but the head isn't super. it's got a sour fruity aroma. i'd say cranberry is the fruit i detect most strongly. the sour character is even more distinct than the aroma. the fruit is less distinct than in the grand cru, which i prefer, but this is nice too"
"A very nice example of a Flanders Red Ale. Pours from the growler as a very dark brown, verging on red, color. There is a brief white foamy head. The smell is sour (thinking apples here), and plesantly so. The taste grows on you with each sip, being rather sour. The carbonation brings the sour taste up to the palate very nicely. A good brew worth giving a try, if the opportunity presents. This would go very nicely with a big Thanksgiving meal revolving around Turkey. Find it and enjoy!"
"Drinkability  One of the more sessionable sour ales that Ive had. The obvious high quality of the ingredients makes this a pleasure to drink, and the 25% ale aged in oak infusion makes this a smooth drinker."
"This ale poured a deep, red-brown color with creamy, tan foam that settled but clung to the glass and left a bit of lacing. The smell was tart and a little wild with some lactic overtones. The aroma faded as the glass sat. The taste was tart and lactic with flavors of sour cherries and a hint of sweetness. There was mild maltiness beneath the tartness, and a faint hint of cinnamon or spices. The mouthfeel was tart and fruity with medium body and good carbonation. This was a very nice beer: not too tart and leaving you wanting more."
"750 ml brown bottle with best before date of 3/6/06. Pours a medium dark brown with some red hues. 2 finger head, OK longevity and prety good lace. Smells fruity, sour and wine like. Tasty. Sour and fruity again with some wine like qualities, but definate malt presence. Dry and crisp. Not as ""big"" as the Grand Cru and easier drinking. Carbonation is fairly high. Not as flavorful, rich or smooth as its big brother but those lesser qaulities make it easier drinking and still a tasty beer."
"The tame version of its big brother, the Grand Cru, this golden-brown beer starts off with a distinctly tart aroma that includes crabapple. Big-time sweet/sour acidity takes hold of the palate. It's like drinking sour candy. Wow. This tartness, while intense, stays just on the safe side of mouth-puckering. I think this was my first Flanders Red Ale. As such, it was a unique and eye-opening experience."
"Aftertaste is mildly sour with some woody notes - stays in the nose for minutes afterwards. This beer is probably mild enough for npeople not accustomed to flemish reds to easily drink it."
"This is definitely a ""Desert Island"" beer, one of the very great beers one should always have around. Yet it's so hard to find in parts of the US."
"This had a nice winey aroma with a good solid head when poured. It had a wonderful sour flavor in the Flemish style with hints of black cherries. I also taste some metallic hints, but did not detract from the flavor at all. This was very crisp & clean in the finish. Good carbonation led this to be very drinkable & quenching. I would definitely get this again, but the price makes it slightly prohibitive."
"It pairs well with a wide range of soft, buttery and/or earthy Brie-type cheeses; and alongside a crusty loaf of whole wheat bread it makes a wonderful small meal. Some red grapes on the side only help to delineate it's character. Seafood is another choice to consider, as it's acidity clearly cuts through, and mussels in red sauce is a classic. Finally, it also works well at the very start of a meal as an apertif, or with salad (think vinaigrette and soft cheese); and at the end of the meal as a palate cleanser."
"D: This is my first time having this style, and it is very interesting. The tartness is very intense, making me glad that I tried the 250 ml bottles instead of the 750's, as I think a 750 would be difficult to finish in one sitting. Definitely not an everyday brew, but definitely one that I'll add to my repertoire."
"I think a few of these would be welcome, but certainly not a session beer."
"On tap at McNulty Bier Market in Cleveland. Pours a dark red, ruby color with a very thin white head that disappeared in an instant. Slight sour cherry and vinegar aroma. Tart flavor of sour berries. Flavor ends quickly. No bitterness. Quite differnet from the Grand Cru, I was expecting it to be more sour. Light to medium body. Refreshing, and pretty drinkable."
"Overall I'm really impressed. This is one of those unique beer gems that isn't ""normal"" and is all the more amazing for it. We wouldn't want everything to taste the same, would we?"
"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle into a Rodenbach glass. Picked up a case a few months back at the Beeryard and have been trying them little by little ever since. Just has this one tonight. The beer pours a deep redish brown color with a slight tan head with some good lacing. The aroma gives a big kick of cheeries with some earthy notes in the background. The taste is a cluster of cherry tartness with a good balance of carbonation and more of the earthy notes I got in the aroma. I find this beer very drinkable and although not my favorite flemish red, it is very near the top of my list of favorites."
"Seems to be a medium bodied brew. Tartness is only initial and then subsides. A bit of carbonation adds a refreshing edge to this. Very drinkable for the style."
"This beer is crisp and refreshing. Good drinkabilty if you can handle the intense sweet and sour tastes. Gets a little too tart to have too many."
"D- I can really see how this style is nicknamed the ""red wine of beers", but this beer is more than that. The complexity of fruit, malt, and wood are really nice together and this is a good beer to be sipped slowly and not quaffed."
"Poured this beer from the 750ml bottle into my Konings hoeven goblet. It is a dark red-brown with a quickly fading tan head. It has some light lacing and high carbonation. The smell is a musty cellared smell. It has a very clean taste for a Flemish red ale. An initial sour berries flavor peaks in a sour mid-note and fades to an oak sour finish that lasts. It gets better as you sip it and become familiar with it. Not my favorite Flemish Red by far. The flavor isnt near as complex as my favorite beer Duchesse de Bourgogne or its sister Vichtenaar. However, I like this beer far better than Rodenback Gran Cru."
"Maybe I've been ruined since the the flanders red's I've had the most are la folie and rodenbach grand cru, but I'm not overly crazy about this. 3/4 lambic, 1/16 belgian strong ale and the rest water, well.... I can understand it, I'm just not a big fan."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a complex scent that boasts of Belgian crystal and roasted malts along with a tart yeast aroma; very nice. There is a slight oak essence in the background. The taste is great. It has an intensely tart flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and sour. It has a nice mix of crystal and roasted malts along with some oak notes. I can't get enough of this tart taste; damn it's refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good beer. I'm relatively new to this style, but I really enjoyed it. I'll be seeking this out again soon."
"Pours a deep amber to red color with a 2 finger head that falls to a solid coat over top. Nose is so very nice and sweet with tartness to balance it very well. Good notes of cherry and acetone sweetness (I always liked the smell of acetone) with a sharp tartness that is so nice. Flavor is very well balanced, with the sweet cherry hitting first followed by a moderate sharp sourness that turns to a light residual sweetness on the finish. Very clean and incredibly tasty. Feel is on the light end of moderate with a full moderate carbonation. Very light and clean, keeping it disappearing from my glass at a high clip. A very tasty and drinkable beer. I like the balance of flavors and I think the nose is even better. A wonderful brew."
"I should have read the label more carefully. This is a Flemish SOUR ale. I like to try new things and I never drank sour ale before but I did not anticipate how sour, sour could be. To me it tasted like vinegar. I spent half an hour trying to drink the blasted stuff hoping that I would ""develope a taste"" for it. But that never happened.It tasted like vineagar from the first sip to the last. The bottle cost me $7 (750ml) and I consider it money well spent since I now know that sour ale is NOT for me. There are many good reveiws of this ale, apparently there are those who like sour tasting beer, but it is not for everybody. When I drink Belgian, I will stick to the classic Belgium Stong Ales frm now on."
"I was very much looking forward to popping the top on this world renowned brew, especially since I've had very few in the style. It poured with a largely beaded, off-white, and bit inconsistent head. It has a gorgeous pure mahogany color that is incredibly inviting. Wow, the smell is very vinous, almost like a merlot. Among the odors include; sweet malt, cherry, oak, and sour grape. Its surprisingly medium-bodied and very liquid in mouthfeel. I immediately notice that this is a very different and complex beer. The sour character is evident from the first sip. I'm sensing sour cherries/grapes, prickly fruit notes that engage in a serious tug of war with the sharp sour notes that result in a highly acidic character. It finishes more tartly as the sour notes fade, also somewhat dry with a touch of grit. Wonderful oaken fruit notes remain. The complexity is amazing. Even if you're not into the style, its something you have to try once."
"I think I prefer the Classic to the Grand Cru at least from a pure drinkability standpoint. I found this refreshingly tart though not as vinegar like as the Grand Cru. Poured deep ruby with a thin head and persistent light carbonation. Aroma was sour cherries, and some other funky aromas that I could not put into words. Taste is delightfully sour and refreshing. Tingly mouth feel is heightend by a mouth puckering sourness and persistent light carbonation. Mouthfeel is light and overall this is a very drinkable brew."
"250 mL nip bottle, best by 10/20/05 - ah well - probably still good. Pours a ruddy red/brown into the flute with a 1 finger tan head that sticks fairly well and has a hint of red. It has scents of earthy malts and a musty sour/farmy character. The taste is the same with an acidic sourness and fruits (cherry? raspberry?). The body is medium, initially tingly, and fairly drying. An interesting style - maybe not the best, but good enough and I've got another kind (Monk's) to compare it against."
"I had this on tap at the Mellow Mushroom in Charlotte. It was poured into a tulip glass a deep brown with ruby highlights topped by a light fluffy white head. Fruity aroma. Some cranberry, a little sour apple. Taste is tart. More cranberry, a little orange, some fresh bread. More citrus on the finish. Slick dry mouth feel nice drinkability. It was great to finally get a chance to try this classic. I cant wait to compare it to a bottle"
"A nice find on tap at the soon to be no more Blind Tiger ale house. This little lovely poured cloudy reddish amber, with a tiny bubble slight head, leaving fine, wispy lacing. Nose of semi sour cherries. Flavorful, complex brew with notes of sour fruit, moderate but not overpowering in intensity. More drinkable then other ""reds"" I've tried. Tasty, fruity, intense. A fine experience in drinking."
"Hazy deep chestnut with a medium beige head which laces well but should have stuck around for a while longer. Smells halfway between a wood fire and vinegar. Tastes like toasted apple cider vinegar. Smoky, oaky, and old, a little sharp, but not fresh. Feels slick for one second, then makes a 180 to sizzly. The sourness has a nice finish to it, but overall the flavor just doesn't do much for me. It does not have enough complexity or drinkability to make me really want it again. This may have been the old standard, but it has been far surpassed by now."
"If you've never tried Flanders Reds before, I recommend getting a smaller bottle or trying one on tap somewhere first. Not a style that everyone will like."
"I would have no problem polishing off mutliple 750s. I can taste why this brew has been around for centuries. Looking forward to see how the Rodenbach Grand Cru stacks up to the Classic."
"Carrying an almost legendary air about it, when Eulogy had it, I decided, I had to as well. And Im certainly glad I did, as it is a nice example of well-crafted blended complexity. Not to say its the most complicated offering out there, but it does hit on various levels. And its surprisingly crisp and quenching, driving the drinkability skyward. And yes, I did indulge that asset, what with a DD in tow. Theres a certain mystique about this beer, and Ill be more than happy to revisit it the next time it comes around. I just hope I dont have to wait too long."
"750 ml bottle. $9 in NC. Says 5.1% ABV and 75% fresh/25% aged in oak silk screened on bottle."
"Poured a minimally cloudy dark ruby with big, but rapidly diminishing white head and excellent lace retention. A pleasant blend of juicy fruits, oak, and wine-like sourness in the nose. Very rounded and exceptionally well-balanced flavors. Ripe red fruits intermingle with woody oak and finish in a moderately drying yeasty flourish. Moderately light in body, with the expected big carbonation. Stunningly drinkable and poised."
"I could enjoy a few glasses of this one, but at $7 a glass, this would be a one and done for me."
"A nice and unique brew. Bright vibrant red color, no head on this one. Smells woodsy, with hints of cherries and other bits of sweetness. Taste is much the same, but more complex. It's a tad sour, but not nearly the sourness I was expecting. Definately wild and woodsy though, I love that freshness. Mildly sweet and fruity as well, with a solid dust taste. Really interesting. I'd like to try the bottle conditioned version sooner or later. A complex, refreshing, well made beer."
"An interesting and unique brew. However to me, one youve got to be in the mood for and/or have an appropriate pairing. Clean, bright nose with hints of cherry. Taste is strong cherry, noticeable lime, a hint of sugar, and a nice tart dry finish. A nice balance of the tart/sweet that really makes the brew refreshing. Mouthfeel is weak. Too light, too craft soda like for me. Very reminiscent of a Stewarts Black Cherry soda. If in the mood, warm day, etc...a very nice beer, but not for all occasions by any means. That being said, well crafted no doubt."
"Upon pouring this beer into my Unibroue Tulip glass, a slightly tan creamy head swelled up about 2 fingers in depth. The head on this beer was absolutely remarkable with a certain frothy texture popping with blue and red micro bubbles. The beer poured a dark brown with a hint of deep burgundy when held up to a lamp. The smell was of pungent sour cherries, vinegar and grass. The initial taste was that of a malty brown ale that immediately transformed into a tart cherry and grape and finished clean with a ginger-like flavor. I sipped from this glass for about an hour and then re-poured from the 750ml bottle with remarkably similar results. This is a fantastic beverage to sip throughout an evening with company. While I am an amateur in the realm of Belgian/Flemish sour ales and lambics, I highly recommend this brew to anyone interested in the style as it has certainly turned me on to exploring other varieties."
"On tap at Zenos in State College, PA. Just got it because it was something I hadnt ever heard of or tried before. Didnt know it was a flanders until I tried it. Not one of my favorite styles of beer, but a good change of pace. Pours a hazy reddish-copperish-dark brown with a small, off-white, tight, creamy-looking head with good retention. Excellent, thick lacing. A bit sweet smelling but with a sour tinge to it as well as expected. Fruity (cherry and grape), bready and woodsy smelling with a hint of vinegar. The sour smell and taste instantly give away its style. Very typical aromas and flavors from the brets. The taste is mostly fruity with a light malt backbone. Kind of reminds me of some apple cider I recently had that I let get a few weeks old to where it has that nice zing to it. The taste seems to be a little one-dimensional, but I havent had too many flanders ales to know if this is typical of the style or not. I mean, the taste was good, but there wasnt all that much of it, nor did it last very long on the finish at all. Medium-light body, moderately astringent, and soft carbonation. An interesting ale, and good but not great, though I blame a lot of that on the style. Not my cup of tea, but probably a little above average compared to other flanders Ive had. I'm glad I tried it."
"Surprisingly refreshing. A perfect counter to the salty foods (wings, burger, fries) I was eating at the time. If I read my own description, I would probably not want to try this. But it actually tastes really good. A great beer to drink with a salty dinner."
"I love this beer, period. Is it worth an arm and a leg.. no. but if it is around at a reasonable price this is something to have out often. So well rounded it is mind boggling. This is one to enjoy rather than break out the science kit and analyze all night. A simple plate of mild cheeses like jack or even a nice cabot would go great with this."
"I actually remember Rodenbach being a bit better the last go 'round in the States but maybe it's just me."
"I was excited to finally find this and the Grand Cru in my area. This didnt disappoint. Pours red-brown with a thick, luscious off-white head. Sour aroma full of sour cherries, grapes, cider, a touch of cider vinegar, and some barnyard funk. Perfect amount of tartness is tempered by a slight raisin sweetness. Some spiciness in the finish. I loved this beer, cant wait for to try the Cru."
"The drinkability was a notch above. This was my first overly drinkable funkadelic red."
"Thanks for sharing Gabe!"
"Drinkability is phenomenal. This beer is just flat out sexy, in my opinion. After a week of all Belgian Blondes, Dubbels, Tripels, and Wits (all of which, of course, have their own strengths), this is a fresh taste, and certainly a beer that I plan on continuing to drink as regularly as possible."
"I bought this while in Brussels from Beer Mania. Sampled from a 25cl bottle into my nifty new Alesmith Decadence glass. Pours a dark redish brown, has a garnet likeness, tops off with a light offwhite-tan head, doesn't leave much lacing on my glass. Aroma is quite the funk, smells of a barnyard backed up by sweet thick figgy malt and a hint of vinegar. Flavor is like figs and sour cherries, the scales sway back and forth between sour and sweet, slightly bitter and peppery spice. Quite a complex flavor profile going on here. Mouthfeel is crisp with carbonation that dances on the palate, medium to light coating and finishes with an astringent dryness. I like the Rodenbach, this is my second time trying it and I will surely try it again."
"Listen, what can I add to what has been said? On draft at Monk's in a classic glass from the brewer. Reddish brown, almost opaque. Tastes sweet of cherries and/or raisons. Then tart. Hints of oak, tannic acid. Tart is the finish that sets this apart from every other experience. A home run as it were. Maybe not a session beer, but one I always look forward to at Monk's. This stuff is terriffic. Truely one of my favorites."
"Light yet mouthfilling, persistent carbonation, very refreshing. The beer world's answer to the kir royale. The end of each sip strips away all that went before, leaving you ready for the next sip or bite of food. I can certainly see salad or seafood with this. I had it with brunch, a nice feta cheese omellete, and it was perfect. A great and distinctive beer, deserving of it's reputation."
"Drinkability and Overall: This beer is devilishly smooth, delicious, and drinkable. This is one I wish I had available to me all the time. My choice for a session beer. Thank you D's for bringing in this marvelous creation."
"Poured into a Rodenbach glass. Red/Black color with minimal head, aromas of lactic sour and cherry. Tastes incredible, even smoother than the bottled version. Smooth and creamy, more drinkable than almost anything I can think of. Once again I am amazed at the caliber of this brew."
"This beer is highly recommended. It's probably not for everyone, but what a great representation of the style!"
"Just sipping another in 2006, not as good as I recall. Tasty still but the flavours somehow seem muted"
"Tap at Andy's. Three glasses full with Slander and Mkobes (and Tony Forder for that matter). Seductive looking tulip glass. Burnt orange hugh, nice head on top. Not really clear. Rich soured apple and cherry aromas. Flavors are tart and malty. You can pick out apples and cherries in that sweet and sour combination of fruit and malt. Decent mouth feel. Tart finish. Drinkable to the max. A session beer with all the trimmings."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Perfect in every regard... slick and moderate, smooth and inviting. Everything about this makes me want to try one more sip, one more glass. Totally thirst-quenching and a feast for the senses, I am so happy to have sampled what might be perfection for this style. At $7 a glass, I didn't care... four went down the gullet inside of 3 hours, and when I tell you that I enjoyed and savored each taste, I mean it."
"On tap at Monks, this came in its own glass and looked delicious. The beer has a deep ruby color with hues of brown, a head of foamy tan lace and a moderate amount of carbonation. The smell didn't really impress me, with a bit of a sour note that felt drowned out by rather flat malt and some residual carmel sweetness. The first sip was surprisingly smooth, without the sharp acidic bite I'm used to from this style. This instead has a sweet brown sugar flavor, mixed with some sour cherry and fruity esteric malt. I really wasn't amazed, and yet I still liked this quite a bit. I think it's worth trying in a bottle just to see if the flavor is more defined. In any case, not a bad offering especially if the sourness of this style is a turn off. A nice, balanced version with plenty of malt and sweetness to smooth the edges."
"well, im surprised by how much i liked this beer. ive seen it in the shop quite a few times but always passed it up for something else. very happy i finally gave up the $8 for this bottle."
"Fruit (I believe cherries) in the smell and up front in the taste. Ends with some tartness. Not overwhelming Cantillon-esque tartness. But a tartness which makes this incredibly drinkable."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4"" over the clear bright reddish amber brew. Lacing is is good, even though the head has faded to a bubbly film. Aroma is malty, yet funky and has sour tinges as well. Taste is pleasantly tart, with a reasonable malty body, and minimal funk, for better or worse. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth even considering it's tartness, and as such, drinkability for the styleis superb."
"Reviewed from a 25cl bottled with a date of 20/10/05 on the back. Pours out a dark reddish brown with a light tan head. Some lace was left around the glass. Aroma is mild, but notes of tart fruits and a slight mustiness are most evident. Cherries seem to be the only fruit I could really pick out. Flavor starts off with a sweet and tart fruitiness with mainly a cherry component. Some other sweet flavors are mingling about like caramel. Pretty interesting stuff, it balances the tartness with sweetness quite nicely. Finished with a lightly tart note. Mouthfeel is a bit bubbly and crisp. Pretty refreshing stuff. Great drinkability as well."
"A masterpiece, red and brown appearance, with the rich smell of a good wine and cherry. Sour cherry and sweet fruit simultaneously. A tad of other spice and is it the oak that brings this all together? A full mouth experience. Sure liked it a lot more than their Grand Cru. Just as good on-tap at Eulogy In May 2005."
"After drinking the grand cru last night, i tried a regular one today. Colour looks to be less dark but a great autum colour; no great head but a spectacular nose. Litle sour but lots of cherryfruit and overal more then plesant. Taste is full, litle sour, cherry and oak. Great beer however I think it's not what it used to be."
"Drink one. Drink two. Drink three. Drink all night. This is a perfect beverage."
"Bottle drank at le Cirio in Brussels: Poured a light red/brown colored beer with a nice head with better then average retention. Aroma is mostly dominated by the oak/cherry smell but not as strong as for the Grand Cru. Taste is surprisingly more refreshing then expected with again the oak/cherry taste and some light sweetness. The end is a bit sour and watery. This is not on par with the Grand Cru but it would wonderful to drink this during a hot summer days beside the pool."
"An interesting beer, worth a try."
"Excellent. Utterly delectable."
"The taste off the bat brings those cherries down to bear in an almost lambic fashion. Black cherries take on a sweet and sour lemon, with balsamic edge, which is both mouth-puckering and refreshing. This tiny bottle went far too fast. Hard to locate the hops until well after the cherries have left the building. Notes of mint and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Carbonation comes out as creamy in the forefront, with a medium blast in the throat, all at the same moment. Then returns to being creamy and rolls down the throat. Pleasing."
"Drying and inviting, very drinkable. Great complexity and subdued Belgian funkiness. Light notes of sherry, vanilla, ever so slight almonds. A classic Belgian that dissapeared like a perfect spring day."
"Pour is dark caramel, completely opaque with a medium cream dark tan head, lasting for a bit. The smell is fruity as the taste, in terms of rather 'frutti di bosco' sorta fruits (red stuff I guess), very pleasing combination within a very dense body."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is very malty and sweet, with cherry, red grape, and a hint of alcohol. The taste is also fairly malty, with sweet fruits and a little spice. The finish has a slight tartness to it. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and heavy. The drinkability is fairly good too. A solid Belgian Red."
"Dark red color. The smell is winy and woody. The beer matured two years in wooden barrels, so its not really a surprise. Im kind of scared because I usually dont appreciate this kind of beer very much. Cherries, wood and fruity wine flavors come in the taste. Raspberries and blueberries. Sweetness. Definitely cherries. The mouthfeel is light. The real surprise for me was the sourness, mixed with some slightly bitter aftertaste. I didnt expect the tart but it was very deep in the brew. Good, but not one of my favorites. Too sour for my taste."
"Taste is much like the smell. Sour cherry and vanilla in the body followed by musky chocolate, hints of oak. Lightly sour finish. Not nearly as full-flavored or sour as the smell would indicate but nicely balanced. A bit thin with a lingering sourness on the tongue. Very smooth and pretty drinkable for the style. Not nearly as sour when I last had it some 8 years ago but I will chalk that up to a maturing palate. A real treat and a classic."
"This one changed my idea of the normal ""beer"" flavors. Rodenbach packs a very complex flavor different from other sweet fruit beers or Belgian ales, and I'm glad I tried it. While I respect the flavor, it's definitely not something I'd come back to  not really my thing  and the high cost in the U.S. means I'll have to stick with other Belgians I like better."
"If I wanted a drink this fruity I would have a glass of wine. Gimme something with hops that bite and malt that greets me without and shyness."
"Pre-palm vintage, perhaps a 1993? This stuff is dark brown with a small off-white head. Aromas are of smoky malts, cherries, acidic funk, chocolate, and more. The taste is chocolate-like, with smoke, cherries, funk, and lambic-like acid all in the mix as well. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner thinner than usual, and the drinkability is still absolutely awesome. Wow this is so different than fresh, post-palm rodenbach. I wonder if the reciple changed? At 10 years old this stuff is starting to have the complexity of a Hardy's!"
"Bottom line: Most BA's present thought the age of the keg detracted from the flavor of the beer. One former brewmaster thought it improved with the age. I thought the aging changed the beer a little but in a neutral manner. Although I prefer the Grand Cru and the Alexander, Rodenbach is a great example of what is right about Belgian beer. Refreshing, unique, and highly drinkable."
"Thanks Alan."
"This was, amazingly enough, a bottle from 1988, served at Kroegske. Appearance: Mild head, bright dark red color, very clear. Aroma: very strong sourness, still enough malt to balance it out, with an incredibly smooth balance. Flavor: Tart and very mellow. Malty is subdued, and vinous flavors. Dinkability is dominated by tart finish. The sourness wonderfully masks the age; the only way you would have any idea how old it is would be that they don't make it this well anymore!"
"Thanks to schoolteacher & biruchan."
"A truly lovely beer! It's a shame that I had tasted the Grand Cru before I tried this as it's kind of like a ""Grand Cru lite"". The oily taste of the ""Grand Cru"" isn't as noticeable and the mouthfeel is not as big. However the woody/cherry flavour is still there along with that wonderfull tartness. I will be drinking this again...... and again."
"Originally sampled on 19 April 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This beer is a reddish brown color w/ a dirty white head. It has a slightly sour taste, but overall is well balanced. To me, sour ales are a bit of an acquired taste. This one is on the milder side. For this style, it's a middle of the road beer."
"Lovely looking beer - a nice dark brown. Murky. Almost didn't catch the head. Very thin and fleeting. No lacing at all. Smells of sour apples. Tasty. Very clean and very light. Hardly any aftertaste at all. A perfectly neat, clean finish. This beer is turning me on to the sour types!"
"A great beer.  Nice sweet/sour flavor though not as much as their Grand Cru (understandably).  Much more easily drinkable than the GC, but also less flavorful.  Overall a very nice beer."
"Wierd, but good, chocolatey, sourish, refreshing and somehow works, very drinkable. I'd love to try it on tap."
"Sweet and sour. Full bodied yet clean and drinkable. Tart faintly cherry nose. It's hard to believe this is brewed without fruit."
