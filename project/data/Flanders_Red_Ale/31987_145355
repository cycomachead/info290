4.75,10,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,"Overall: An amazing beer, just happened to find it on the bottle menu and thought it sounded wonderful.  And it really is wonderful.  Sour without being hard to drink, something I would love to drink a ton of.  I know this will be the only time I get to drink this, and that is disappointing, because I would gladly buy bottles for home.  Within reason of price, of course.","MadCat","Feb 19, 2015"
