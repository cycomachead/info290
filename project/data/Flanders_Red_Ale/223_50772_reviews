"One of the best beers I have ever had, hands down.  A revelation.  Fruity, sour, complex, and extremely well-balanced.  An accomplishment.  Only downside is that other beers don't taste as good anymore by comparison."
""
"This is the first beer that I've ever given five stars. It's perfect in every way - smell, taste and balance."
""
"This beer is a super example of the style.  I use it as a benchmark."
""
""
"Perfectly blended mix of funkyness and acidity.  Nice tart fruit forward taste without being sweet."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/30/2014. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red/brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, light cocoa, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big sour cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, light cocoa, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Large amount of acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, raspberry, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, leather, musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a nice sweetness/sourness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Flanders red ale! All around fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink even with the high level of acidity. An insanely delicious offering."
"This is the sour that got me hooked on sours.  Deliciously tart and acetic, complex but not much funk.  Let it warm up a bit and get all the great flavors of cherry, nutty, oaky, etc.  I only wish it wasn't so expensive!"
"There are better Flanders Red's out there"
""
"On draft at the #grognbpt  earthy nose with a tangy tart flavor.  The tartness mellows out to a smooth finish"
"Dark reddish brown with moderate, long lasting head. Sour cherries with vanilla notes, slightly sweet with a strong tart finish.  So much like the Monks Flemish Sour Ale in taste and appearance, I wonder if they are not in fact of the same style instead of being classified as an Oud Bruin."
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite sours. It's less fruity than more wild ales and less vinegarish than other Flanders Reds. Sharp tartness, but not extreme and excellent middle-to-aftertaste."
""
"Great on tap. The nose definitely points directly to the taste. A very pleasing sour with notes of tart blueberry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  If Wild Cherry Pepsi grew up from a quirky teenager into an eccentric mad scientist, this would be the result. Delightfully flavorful beverage that masterfully covers its alcoholic notes with bold essence of wild cherry and berry. Extremely refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very delicious...many flavors come through as you sip...great finish"
""
""
"Very fruit forward sour, like a produce market in your moutg"
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  this is a great beer.  Love Flanders red style and this is a great example.  Amazing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's on the sweeter end of sour beers"
""
"Don't get many Flanders style beers in my part of the world, so I was happy to find this at Julio's Liquors in Mass last time I was in the state. Pours a light red; head dissipates quickly. Really well-balanced overall; sour nose and taste without being overwhelming or lingering too long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Slightly drier than Dutches making it more much drinkable. Sets the standard for sours."
""
"Is the Flanders Red secretly my favorite beer style? I can't help but smile as I enjoy one of these... is it just the tart punch to the face that makes me look like I am smiling? So many questions... this reminded me a lot of the Duchesse, save the interesting mahogany hue when held to the light, increased 'punch' of the tart cherry flavor, hint of vanilla, and slightly drier finish. I rated Duchesse very high, and this one would be just a bit higher. What it loses a bit in balance, it makes up for with the intensity of flavor. Eye-opening. Again, I scored the components high, but the overall package is so much more complex and gratifying. Perfection in my eyes. Seek this out. ASAP."
""
""
"Had this one on tap at the finest craft bar in  Western MD...Always Ron's in Hagerstown.  This is  very fine sour red ale.  Not too much funky or horseblanket on the nose.  Moderate sourness and some slight sweet complexity going in this beer to help balance slightly.  Not quite up there with a few other more complex sours but still extremely well made and enjoyable.  Definitely fixed my sour beer craving that has been missed for several weeks.  Will never turn this one down.  Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost tastes like wine haha"
""
""
""
"So this is my first time tasting this type of beer.  Still not sure what to think.  It pours a red wine clear color with no head or lacing on the side of the glass.  Not sure if this is typical for the type, so I will rate it low for now.  Has a tart grape, sour apple aroma.  Very tart sour apple taste.  It is good, but it can be hard to finish the beer due to the tartness.  There is a tart aftertaste, but I don't remember it being that strong."

"Fantastic stuff ! By far my favorite sour beer. As far as Flanders are concerned I consider this to be the standard."

"I bought this on tap at the Cafe Bruges in Carlisle, PA.  I was immediately struck by its beautiful, lustrous dark red tint, and it smelled delightfully of cheery and other tart flavors.  When I tasted it, I got a strong, almost vinegar-like hit on my tongue, followed by some flowery accents.  It's sour and good.  The mouthfeel was also very smooth, with a medium body and a little carbonation.  Overall, I really like this, and I think I really like these brews in general.  I'm going to keep going back to these Belgian ales.  Most definitely."
""
""
"Sour beer. My tastebuds are freaking out.  Yes, I'll have another!"
""
""
"Overall: this is a sour for sure but a little too much sour with not much else going on would not rate this world class, definitely had better"

"O - This is a damn fine Flanders Red. This has a great nose and straight forward tart flavor. Awesome."
""
""
""
""
"O: An honest-to-goodness sour beer. Not simple, but purposeful; doesn't spend time on complexity when all you want is sourness and red fruit. I'll be searching for it again."

"On tap.   Lovely flanders red ... great balance of fruit and tart.   The sourness is pretty mild ... tart is a better term than sour for this beer.   Just perfect for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best sour red in the world hands down!"
""
""
""
""
"big sour smack, blended complexity, tangy finish leaving you wanting more. The best sour I have ever had."
""
""
""
"Sparkling sourness convinces from the first glance, with a tongue-drying, vinous aspect, among high carbonation. It has a gentle fruity note of overripe grapes, which goes well with the sharp vinegar bite, resulting in a very pleasant taste, which reminds me of a good, medium-bodied wine. This brew has a fantastic complexity compared to its relatively low abv, with an intense, dry sourness, which gets especially recognizable during the finish, which is like the rest of the beer just very enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall - This is an excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Potent Potables in Jamestown, NC. Very good sour. Excellent balance. Dark red, so dark I initially though it was black."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Super, super sour.  Would be better if the acidity were dialed back a touch to let the other flavors come out a little more."

"On tap for ""Sour Night"" at The Brew Kettle in Strongsville, Ohio during Cleveland Beer Week 2014."

"Deliciously sour and bright. Apple and fruity flavors with a crisp finish. Im a huge sour fan and this is one of my favorites."

"Next to the magnificent reds from Rodenbach, this is probably my favorite Flemish Red (although Duchesse de Bourgogne by Verhaeghe comes close). I have been fortunate to have it on tap numerous times at the hidden gem, The Anchor, in Wichita, KS (of all places). Typical of the style in most respects, although a bite more tart and slightly more bitter (and less sweet) than others. Dangerously refreshing and delicious, one could drink liters of this if not careful."

"Nice ruby amber color. Weak head with some lacing. Mostly clean aroma with tart fruit. Aggressive acidic flavor. Raspberries, blackberries and cranberries. Subtle vinegar flavor in the finish. Medium bodied. Well carbonated. Bone dry finish."
"This beer is awesome, totally refreshing and highly drinkable. Grab this if you see it."

"O: love it. A wonderful balanced full-flavoured beer that doesn't go over the top."
""
""
"Amazing sour beer. Sour sweet sour. Thin mouth feel. The flavor is strong enough to clean your palate when eating any food even rich meals but dont try another beer after it. Numbs your taste buds after a while. Awesome beer!! My new go to Sour Beer."
""
""
""
""
"Certainly the best sour I have had to date outside of Grand Cru.  Amazing appearance, balance, taste and mouthfeel.  Just the right tartness.  Will definitely be in my go to list."

"Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle date 4/14 into a 12 oz. tulip. Scant one finger head that dissipated quickly. Beautiful red color, nice tart aroma, significant sourness, fruit notes, slightly oily mouth feel. Intense and delicious."
"O- a world class beer that's packed with fruity puckering flavor, it seems to get more complex as it warms   4.5"

"Had this at TORST in Brooklyn.  I'm hooked on Sour Beers now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything a Sour is suppose to be, in my estimation.  Great tartness that lasted to the last sip. Nice Cherry flavor."
""
""
"Mahogany beer with 1-finger tan head. Aroma of dried fruits and vinegar. Taste is actually sour, sharp, slightly fruity. Too severe for the style, imho."
""
""
"O - Very nice beer, tons of flavor for the low abv. Personally I prefer other reds like rodenbach grand cru or the duchesse which are not quite as acidic. Nevertheless an awesome beer that is really refreshing."

""
""

"O - WHen i go to the liquor store and nothing catches my eye I always leave with this 4 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unfortunately the cooler this was kept in isn’t functioning correctly and the beer is served too warm. For me this is a beer that does need to be at least somewhat chilled. This had a great head and lace. Had a very aromatic, pungent aroma. Cant pick up some of the finer qualities as they’re lost in the acidity that more fully expressed with the warmer temps."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this direct sour was what I was in the mood for and it nailed it. It is a Flemish Sour, unlike some adult cherry soda's I've had from other breweries (and brouwerij's). Will revisit. Perhaps often."
""
""
"D: This was a fantastic sour, with juicy and delicious scent and taste. The body was ok, but the finish was ultra smooth. So it was easy to drink, but should be sipped and savored. A true delight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark red, almost black until light is shown through it. Light of white head. Smell is cherries, lime and grape funk. Taste is full of fruit cherries citrus, very tart. Feel is light bodied, refreshing, astringent and sour. Lively crisp carbonation. Overall very good cuvee, not too sweet and very refreshing."

"Pours a deep, slightly opaque red with an off white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Subtle carbonation. Aromatics are of sour cherry, discernible vinegar and faint wood. Sour cherry and light vinegar are present on the pallet. Slight oakiness and berries present. Complex, not too tart. Excellent starter beer if you're new to sours."

"O - The core of Cuvée des Jacobins Rouge is quite similar to Monk's Café and Duchesse in that it's an amber-based malt profile that offers quite a bit of sweetness and mild dark stone fruit notes but the difference with this beer is that it's sour; like, twice as sour. The other two are more than respectable brews but don't quite offer the sour kick seasoned sour beer fans are looking for; they're the 'training wheel' sours. Cuvée des Jacobins combines the best of both worlds."

"O: What better way to celebrate Independence Day than with a beer from the country that brought you French Fries and knocking USA out of the 2014 World Cup? I could just savor this all day. Naturally, I need more of this in my life, right now in fact."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"On tap poured into a tulip glass at barley's brewhaus in overland park, ks.  Halfway on my 20 mile bike ride i needed some refreshment.  This is not only one of the best Flanders Red, it is one of the best beers I've had.  Tartly sour and refreshing.  Perfect for a bike break."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This is a great beer. In North Arlington/North Dallas, it averages between $3-5 per bottle, and it is worth every penny. I'd love to find this on tap."
""
""
""
"O: I like a nice tart sour, and this one delivers on that end. But the mildly fruity taste I get underneath (maybe even unsweetened cranberry) is very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Awesome brew that wakes you up!  Drank in Stratford, ON, May  2014 with my brother in his back yard."
""
""

""
""

"Good for the price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When I had my first sour I swore I would never have another. But I keep going back, because of ales like this one."
""
""
"Pours a brilliant ruby, with thin off-white head; settles to a thin ring. Smell: nectarine, cooked apple, hay note, vinous, vanilla. Taste: granny smith, sweet cherry, cranberry; acetic, mild graininess, herbal and vanilla notes. Medium-plus bodied, low but creamy carbonation creeps in, finishing sweet, drying, and oaky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent drinkability. Excellent Flanders Red Ale..."
""
""
""
""
"Sorry! I know I'm going against the rating rules but sour beers aren't the greatest brewed beers... It can be a bios opinion but I don't like them, especially when they're rated in the top 250. That being said maybe I'll appreciate a sour beer at some point but as of now I do appreciate the brewing and creation and idea of them."

""
"O-Overall a great sour."
""
"O: no expert with the Flanders red ale, I found this quite enjoyable and very repeatable - tart and fresh, bright and sweet - a great start-point for the introduction to sours, as it was tart but also warming and almost creamy in feel at times; fans of the cranberry will surely dig this ale."
"Excellent sour, and a good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice red beer. A bit of carbonation forms. Smells typical of red Flanders, acidic, funky, musky, maybe some raspberries. Taste perfect for a red Flanders, sweet, malty, sour, lambics doing their work. It has that bitterness, or dryness, at the end. Good beer to drink, possibly aged in barrels. One of the stronger ones, as in taste."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas."

"Poured a ruddy cranberry color with a slight head. Aromas of tart cherries, earth, and wood. Tartness and cherry flavors are quite pronounced and dominate the flavor profile. Mild funkiness and earthiness are slight and you kind of have to search for it. A good mix of sweet and sour, but the sourness wins. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. A good example of the style, although you really can't beat the style defining Rodenbach."

" In summary, a very tasty beer with a good mix of the sweet and sour, though not everyone's cup of tea with its strong, long-lived sour aftertaste. Hats off to the LCBO though, for taking a chance on selling this unusual style of beer. CJR is quite reasonably priced at $3.30 per 330 ml bottle, and I'd recommend giving it a try if you're looking for a style that's out of the ordinary."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really tasty sour, though it lacks a bit on depth. It mostly only has a tart fruit profile and not much else. Could go for a bit more earthy tones to round out the big lactic sourness."

"A very refreshing beer with lots of tartness compared to Rodenbach Grand Cru. Where that beer excels in barrel complexity and fruity sweetness, this has aggressive tartness throughout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An excellent, easy-to-find sour. Pricey, but then again all sours are. Doesn't always have to be rare to be good."

"pours dark red. getting sourness on the nose, it reminds me of tomato juice or ketchup, and maybe some sweeter overtones as it warms. slightly offensive. the flavor is very well done. its tartness is muffled, pretty friendly. sour apple, definitely strawberry or raspberry notes. do not over chill this, the best came out as it warmed a bit"
""
""
"O - well balanced, subtle complexities under a huge tart punch with exciting flavor changes from start to finish"

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Very nice Flanders red, probably the best shelf Flanders red I've come across. I certainly enjoy this more than Rodenbach Grand Cru, but the price point ($20 for a 4-pack) does deter me a bit even though I know sours are usually more expensive."

""

"I enjoyed this beer, especially as it warmed more, but I still didn't detect a lot of the complexities that I would have expected. It was good, but not my favorite sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I love this beer. One went down way to quickly, I'd love to drink a couple of these at a time."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a perfect Flanders Red and I recommend it to everyone who can get it. The price may look daunting, but it's worth it and relatively cheap for an aged beer like this one."
""
""
""
"O - not able to surmount the acidity to really get any of the flavors I found in the aroma, I felt from the nose I was going to get more complexity. This example is a little one dimensional. It is rather enjoyable none the less, with an approachable price point. I wouldn't mind grabbing a few more for the celler, it's just not blowing my mind."
""
"o: by far my favorite flanders red. If you are the kind that likes the more extreme sours... this is for you."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice example of the style. The flavor is quite intense and enjoyable. While the light sweetness gives a good balance, it hangs slightly in the finish, and I think I would have preferred it to lean even further in the sour direction. Perhaps a few more months in the bottle would round it out nicely."
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Buy if at all possible if you like sours or reds, or traditional Flemish brews. If anything above sounds unappealing, it's there in spades, so buyer beware."
"Overall- One of the best flanders reds I've ever had. Well balanced with great flavors going on."

"I think ""Whoa"" was the first thing that came out of my mouth after I had my first sip. Really hits you with sourness. More sour than any other sour beer I've tasted. I get a lot of tart apple and cherries up front with a lingering sour aftertaste. Enough sweetness in the middle to balance it out. The dryness makes it a very drinkable beer. Just noticed it's almost gone as I'm writing this! A great price for a sour."
""
""
""
"O - This reminds me of New Glarus Enigma, but with much more acidic quality. This is a fantastic Flemish sour and worth the price; $22 a 4 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sours are still a broad style I'm exploring and getting use to. With that being said, this is most enjoyable sour I've had to date. It's smooth and the sourness is perfectly rendered. What a treat!"
""
""
""
"This is a benchmark Flanders Red Ale, we were so fortunate to have it at a great price at the LCBO recently. Full of flavor and depth. Worth seeking out."

"I have had this beer a lot. This my go to sour. I love it. It is never wrong. Sour is supple but elegant. Good price. You can find it on the regular. No haze. Just good old Belgian sour. Please go get yourself one. You won't be disappointed. The red a stand out, but the sour makes this beer"

"This beer is actually fairly simplistic, it is satisfying and tasty though."
""

""

"Nice example of the style, and very easy to drink. Seems like it would be a good gateway beer to the style, because this one is well balanced, and doesn't smack your tongue around with tons of sourness."
""
"Most Flemish sour ales have a moderate amount of sweetness, but this version was exceedingly tart and acidic. Cuvée Des Jacobins Rouge reminded me a lot of a fruit-infused American wild ale. While this might not be the most balanced example of the style, it is nevertheless a very tasty and interesting rendition."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a one finger off-white head that fades fairly quickly. Smell is lactic sourness, tart cherries and a little oak. Taste is a little dry and fairly tart with tart cherries flavor. Medium mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Overall a great sour very crisp."

"It's definitely a Flanders Red. Sour. Cherry. Red wine. However, I really don't get any oak or vanilla flavors."

"This is my first venture into the sour beer world and I am pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this beer and I can see how many people find this type so enjoyable. It has me thinking about similarities between styles as well, as feel it is similar to others not in this category."

"Deep red woody color with a modest head that quickly forms a foamy ring. Aroma is bright and sweet with cherry, apple, maybe lemon. Very nice clean mouth watering smell. Taste is very tart, fruity, spicy, zesty, and purple. A fun beer indeed. Carbonation is perfect. Easy drinking aside from the tartness maybe. This beer is pretty awesome!"

"A pretty good Flanders Red but I would not call this world class."
"A: Color of a rose wine mixed with iced tea, nice ring of foam around the edges along with renegade spots scattered about the surface, crystal clear – 4.50, S: Wonderfully tart and crisp nose, lots of dried cherries and cranberries, dry chalky yeast, quintessential Flanders Red Ale – 4.50, T: Quite dry and mildly puckering, a good deal of tartness and sour cherries, hint of vinegar – 4.00, M: Body is pretty light and mouth feel is crisp – 3.75, D: Very drinkable beer and great representation of the style – 4.25"
""
""
"Great red sour. I'm still newish to sours this seems like a good baseline."
"Overall Drinkability: World class."
""
"Poured a reddish body with minimal head and an aroma that was a strong tart aroma of cherry and a hint of sour apple. Also get a little bit of vanilla, wood and alcohol. Medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink, amazing how tart and sour this beer can be yet doesn't make me pucker at all. I get some cherry and apple flavors, almost wineline one could say, a woodiness and a touch of sweetness add minor balance. A great sipping ale that is worth trying by anyone, fan of this style or not."
"Bottle: Poured a red color ale with a large pink color foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of oak, sour cherries with tart notes is quite nice. Taste is a very drinkable mix of oak and sour cherries with some tart notes and very little acidic notes with light lingering sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. This si a solid version of a Flander red beer."

"Overall: The sourness is intense at first but certainly not acerbic. The tart fruit flavors are very enjoyable especially the dark cherry notes. I think my favorite part of this beer was that gentle, sweet orange note at the end. Overall an enjoyable, complex sour red ale. Personally I would split the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Brownish-red colour, one finger of whiteish head, light lace as well. Smell is of cherry and soru fruits, oak and some vanilla, bit of sweetness as well here, apple skin and some acidity. Taste is a mix of sweet and sour, cherry and acidity, oak finish with vanilla, moderate tart flavours with a bit of malt in the aftertaste. Med-high carbonation, med-full body. Quite nice but left me wanting a bit more, good but not outstanding."

"Overall: by far my favorite sour and probably my favorite Third Beer whenever I can find it on tap. Get a little tipsy with something else, then sip slowly and enjoy."
""
"Cuvée Des Jacobins Rouge is a beer probably worth twice the price I paid for it. While it doesn't have quite the depth of the style's best, on the same hand, it has a degree of approachability and refreshment that any increased intensity would compromise. Bottom line: this is an easy, affordable sour to recommend to just about anyone."

"Flemish reds have never been my favourite style, but I quite enjoy this one. Clean flavours, with balance where it's needed."
""

"O: Overall, I loved this one. Great sour qualities, but a sweetness to balance it out nicely. Awesome beer. A must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Interesting brew, one of few flemish styles I've had. The cherry sourness is nice, but the vinegar is to strong here."
"overall the best flemish red ive ever red. loved this one."
""
""
"Atmosphere is excellent. Nice body, decent head, serviceable lacing. Nose is fruity and powerful with a bit of a woody or earthy tone. Mouth puckering sour fermented raspberry. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"Reviewing this one again since its been a few years and I believe it deserves another shot. This poured out as a vibrant red color with white head on top. Some light thin retention and scattered lacing. The smell of the beer give off some big oaky sour cherry aromas. The taste is tart up front with plenty of sweet & sour cherry flavors there is a bit of oak and vanilla. This beer finishes with a slight malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, smooth and dry in the finish. Overall it's a very good Flanders Red. Really glad to have tried this again. Worth checking out."
"(3.75) D: This is quite good, but a little too vinegar-like and not enough fruity-sour focused for me. Additional dryness would be welcome."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Definitely a sour Flemmish Red. Not as much sweetness as you'd expect to balance, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Tasty and complex. Nice one."
"I had low expectations for this based on my experience with it on tap. Luckily, it didn’t meet my low expectations, and blew me away. Great complexity. Very fruity up front with some nice toasted oak complexness, tart berries, a hint of damp funk, and a nice finishing dryness with a tartness that lingers. So tasty, so complex, so worth it. Go buy some if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light and extremely smooth when entering the mouth, a spritz of carbonation quickly subsides into the sourness coating your tongue and leaving the back of your throat tart and tingling."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is tasty, but I feel as though I've had better beers in this style (Rodenbach GC, and perhaps Petrus?)... Nevertheless it's definitely a nice one to have around and perhaps a good one to introduce non-beer folk to."
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm just starting to tread into sour territory. Before this I've had Supplication, and a few Petrus sours. This is way up there, if you are familiar with sour beers or if you are new to sour beers, I would recommend this one."
""
""
"Overall - A really impressive beer. It's very sour/tart but it still allows for some other nuances to come through. Subtle flavours can be detected throughout. I might even be able to have a few of these, which isn't something I can say about most sours."
"O - this is not a sour for the timid. It is very aggressive with big, bold sourness and a complex range of fruit and oak flavors. A real winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
"This is delicious, but not for beginners! Really takes the style to a new level, away from the more trivial, straight up vinegar or far too acidic versions of the style. I really love how predominant the red and dark fruits are in particular, as well as how well blended this is. The barrels these guys use must be fabulous stuff indeed. With the low ABV, complexity, and refreshing aspects, this is definitely world class stuff. I should try it in the bottle as well, as I'd imagine it would be even more puckering. A must try for fans of veteran sour enthusiasts."
""
"Seriously awesome beer, and I can't believe you can find this stuff on the shelves regularly. Well... at least whenever they release a new batch. I believe this is aged for about 18 months in oak barrels, and you can definitely tell. Super complex, tart, dry, layered; completely drinkable despite the heavy acidity and sharpness it provides the mouth. Top notch and highly recommended."
""
""
"Great stuff here, a top-class Flemish sour. I find myself drawn more and more to the sour, dry Belgian fare, and this brew does the job terrifically. Certainly will stock up on some of these while I still can."

""
""
""

"This small bottle sure was packing in the sour and tart goodness. I guess bottle size doesn't matter when in comes to the amount of sour and tart fruits. A very good delicious Flemish Sour. Would I buy it again? I will and in fact I've already done that."

"Beautiful deep mahogany color with a small, but densely creamy head. Dark cherry, wood, and malt aromas combine seamlessly before meeting some mild, dusty funk and acidic notes. Wow...big, tart, juicy flavor. Sour fruit: cherry, apple, and berries, light spicy wood dryness, and some sweet, creamy maltiness buried beneath it all. Not quite as mouth-peeling astringent as some other Flemish sours, but nicely dry and refreshing. Lactic sourness and a medium bodied, slick mouthfeel. What a treat! Too bad it's so hard to come by around here."

"O - Nice looking beer with a complex nose. I knew there would be a bit of sourness to this but the aroma left me vulnerable to the taste onslaught. After I finish my sip I can still pucker up simply from licking my lips. Fun beer and though I love my sours, this was reaching my threshold."

"O- very good Flanders red. Has more sourness than most for the style."
"O: Surprisingly good. I am impressed. I would recommend this to anyone that loves tart wild ales."
"5.0 D: Easily in my top five most drinkable sours. It's not the most flavorful, but it is perfectly capable to keeping my taste buds entertained. The beauty of this beer is that I keep wanting more well after I finish my last sip."

" I'm very glad I was able to try it. While not the cream of the crop, certainly an above average Flanders Red that I'd happily drink anytime."

"On draft in a CCB snifter at Gainesville House of Beer. Pours very dark red, nearly no head. Vinegar sour cherries on nose, some pleasant cream aroma here. Very nice. Flavor follows suit with massive sour cherry and vinegar, but with a beautiful smooth and crisp finish. Easy drinking and relatively light mouthfeel. This is one of my favorites in the style, and put it right behind Duchesse and Rodenbach Vintage. Good stuff."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: very well balanced - great depth, great tart/sour - not unique, just well-made - shows a balance between the uber tart and lightness of a Rodenbach Grand Cru and the thicker, sweeter qualities of Duchesse"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Far and away the best Flanders Red I've ever had. Expensive at $26 a 4-pack, but completely worth it. My favorite ""shelf sour"" beer."
""
""
"O- I've only had 3 or 4 flemish sours so far, but this is up there with the best of them. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow! This is by far the best Flanders red I have drank. Super sour yet underlined fruit notes that bring this all together quite nicely. Hops and yeast really makes this better than an average Flanders that is just straight sour. Get this when you can. Cheers!"
""
"Poured into a Flanders goblet from a 33cl bottle. Pours a nice, dark reddish-brown with a fizzy head that quickly dissipates. Smell is of some sour fruits. The first few sips are almost like sucking on a lime it's so sour! Tastes like sour cherries and green apples, delicious! Great carbonation. This is in my book one of the best sours out there. Definitely the best I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Found this one in San Antonio during my honeymoon, I'm excited to try it. Poured from a 33cl bottle into a goblet, code of 03 on the back. This pours a slightly hazy dark brown with hints of read and a smaller fizzy short lived head. The smells are very tart and vinegary, sour cherries, brett, some barnyard funk and a hint of vanilla. The feel is medium, high carbonination. The taste is amazing, extremely tart / sour, almost overwhelming, but then you get a hint of sweet balance, some vanilla, plenty of sour cherries. I wish I bought more of these, this is excellent, one of the finest sours I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most complex, intriguing, and delicious beers I've had. Truly something you could sip on for hours and continuously discover new things. A favorite for sure."
"Terrific beer, and a great reason to try the style."
""
"Overall I was not expecting much from this beer as I had never heard of it before but I was super pleased and surprised by the above average complexity and flavor profile. For a moderately priced shelf sour I am super pleased with this and will definitely revisit this going forward when I need a sour fix and the inventory at home is low."
""
""
""
"Overall. A great Flanders red with more sourness than most. I like that."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"One of the better/best sours I've had. Great balance of flavors with some nice complexity in the flavors that blend really well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Truly fantastic brew. If you see it...get it!"
""
"It's hard to think of a beer that better exemplifies a sour ale, however I would have liked a bit more nuance and complexity. With that said, this is still obviously a high-class brew that does one thing extremely well."

""
"Overall: a good beer, and the huge sourness has a refreshing quality and is an incitement to drink more. Great drinkability, a side effect perhaps of its relatively low complexity in flavor. Would definitely have again."
""
""
"O - Just a marvellous beer. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it. Up there with Russian River Supplication."
"Wow this was lip smacking sour with just the right amount of sweetness. More funky brett presence than I expected. My favorite Flanders Red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the finest examples of the style I have tried yet. I rate it right up there with Rodenbach Grand Cru, which I consider the gold standard for this style. Someday, I shall have to try a head-to-head to more closely see how they compare to each other."
""
""
""
"o: just can't get past the ketchup on the finish, feel like i'm ten years old and my mom put cherrry medicine in my ketchup to get me to take it."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium to dark reddish mahogany amber. Thin, fine off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Vinous aroma of cherries with light vinegar and wood. Flavor is intense cherry, acidic but also sweet, little malt presence. Finishes dry and sharp with a hint of wild yeast; I'm not detecting the oak from the aroma in the taste.. Light to medium bodied and the mouthfeel is good from the combination of carbonation and the acidic nature of the beer. I'm not a big sour beer fan, but this flanders red, with its clearly defined and strong flavors, is quite nice. The intense cherry element is very fresh tasting. Finish is a bit medicinal, but the balance of the flavor progression is great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A killer beer. I tend to like the more fruity beers so this was a winner for me. Great balance, great flavors. Definitely check this one out."

"Overall: Very drinkable for a sour. Light, crisp and delicious. If it were cheaper, this would be a regular beer of mine."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with medium to medium-high levels of carbonation. A bit overcarbonated for the weight of the body, but this initial sharpness dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a fairly smooth, enjoyable mouthfeel. Sourness is able to be felt as it puckers the throat and lips a bit, and the acidity can be felt on the back of the throat afterwards. Finish is dry, as expected."
"I was talking to my local Ommegang rep about Rouge and lamenting its loss. He told me to try this at it's the closest beer he knows of to Rouge. He was right. Not quite the same, but damn if it doesn't remind me of it in the best possible way."

"Bretty nose and pretty tart for a Flanders Red, but turns out to be a classical example. Sour, but relatively balanced. Nice smooth mouthfeel on it. Tart cherry and maybe a faint trace of plum. Quite nice, and a good, a bold example of a Flanders Red."
""
"This is a fantastic sour to me, probably the best I've ever had, but I've not had the chance to have any RR or that crazy stuff people go nuts on here for, whats it called, candle poon? I don't know. This stuff is amazing to me. I'd drink it every day if I could."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not my favorite sour, it reminds me of ketchup, bit do far everyone I have told this looks at me like I have three heads, I don't know what it is, I think it is a combination of the sweetness and the vinegar notes that just seay my palate that way. I wish the sour fruit notes took more of the drivers seat, but I seem to be an acception to the rule. @ least in the circle of people I imbibe sour beers with."
""
"O-I like. If you're into sours, I can safely suggest this."
"O - A nice sweet/sour beer. Lots of fruit/berries."
"Pours a murky reddish-brown with a slight ivory head that fades to a thin ring. Lovely aromas of cranberry, tart pie cherries, oak, red wine vinegar, and a touch of vanilla. Taste is similar to the nose, lots of cranberry, oak, and vanilla. Not as tart as the nose may have suggested, instead this is gentle and smooth, with a superb balance between tart and sweet. Expertly done. Mouthfeel is light and dry, with a medium body and ample carbonation. Overall an excellent Flanders Red, this stand up with some of the best easily."
""
"O - Delicious. Of course I'll get it again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really great, and love the availability."
""
""
"O: One of the best flanders red ales I have had thus far. Certainly picking some up when I see it."
""
"Held up to my window this beer shines a mahogany-red color; a small, slightly off white cap with tiny bubbles sticks to the surface. Cherries, vinous, astringent, it really does a number on the nose if you want it to. Sweet, sour, and very smooth. Cherry juice and a sweet background – apple pie maybe …it’s just delicious. Dry but not as dry gueze or etc. and it’s awesome."
"Lighter in body with lively carbonation that helps fill the mouth. Overall an outstanding Flanders. Not one of my favorite styles, but I will be picking up a single of this every once in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A straight up classic."
""
"O- A delicious Flanders red. You have to appreciate drying acids and funky yeast to love this one as it is loaded with intensity on the palate."
""
"D - This is a classic Flemmish red with a complex balance between the sweet/fruity and sour/funky notes. Nicely done and reasonably drinkable despite a strong level of sourness."
""
""
"Overall- this is my favorite example of the style. I love how it starts sour pretends it is going to sweeten but doesn't before leaving with a dry finish. My only complaint is the $6 for a 11.2 oz bottle but it doesn't stop me from semi regularly buying one or two."
""
""
""
" find it on tap."
"A good beer that fits the style well. A bit more sour than I prefer, but still damn tasty."
"Liked this one a lot. Yeah for whatever reason I gett BBQ out of it so it's a winner automatically. Perfect amount of tart. Thanks egrace84,"
""
""
"Similar to Russian River consecration but slightly less sour. Medium brown to burgundy in. color, slightly carbonated with a head that disappears quickly, medium in body with slight acidity. Overall a well balanced and very refreshing beer. Serve after a few minutes out of the cooler."
"Drinkability – A very good sour. Goes down very easily, though it is only 5.5%."
"O: An interesting beer. My knowledge of sours is minimal, so this was a learning experience. I appreciate the sweetness to counteract the sourness, because this guy is VERY sour. A beer to relax to."
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn Gina! Girl, that's all you had to say! Ok, so this beer was the shit. It's really a Flanders Brune in my humble opinion but it was strong and delicious. I would have guessed higher alcohol because of the complex richness of the beer. Color of this is reddish Brown, not brownish red. Very nice sour, if you're into that sort of thang."
""
""
""
"If you're a fan of sours and have never tried this one do not pass it up. You won't be disappointed at all. At $6 for an 11.2 oz bottle in my area it's not too expensive but I could definitely could go broke drinking this beer. However if you're not a fan of sours I would steer clear of this one because it has a lot of sour notes to it."
"Overall: I'm new to the sour, Flemish red style but I am enjoying this more than I thought I would. Very high marks and I can't wait to try the Duchess I have."
""
"Overall this is a really nice sour. Not super mouth-puckering, with a nice depth in character. The barrel aging lends its flavors nicely. I'm excited to see how this one develops or degrades over the years."

"A different league of beer altogether here. Vast complexities, yet all of the usual tasty delights to get fixated on are right there and upfront for you to savor. A model Flanders Red, without question. A rival to my Duchesse and Rodenbach Grand Cru. Will buy up as many as I can."

"T: A great sour punch in the mouth right off the bat. Lots of tart red cherry/red apple sourness with a good lactic twang. Red currants, lemon and a bit of vanilla on the finish. Super drinkable and really delicious."
"O: A wood-aged sour can go a lot of ways, but this one seemed to be just right in the palate. This Rouge is a blend of balanced flavors that would put a smile on any sour fan’s face, and one that I will definitely be trying out again soon."

"Poured a murky mahogany red color with a thin ringlet for a head. Woody aroma, bready malts and cherries, a bit acetic, which is no surprise for the style. The taste mirrored the nose pretty accurately: sweet and sour cherries, lactic and acetic notes, bready malt base. Soft and chewy, medium body, low carbonation, and quite drinkable for the style. I think I prefer a Kasteel Rouge to this, but it's surely not without its charm."

"On tap at Sessions in Greensboro.Poured into a tulip glass a deep ruddy brown mixed with a cherry color with a fluufy off white head atop.Deep sour cherry and dry sherry notes in the nose,a little intimidating for a non-sour lover like me.Sherry-like woody flavors mixed with sour cherries on the palate,when I say sour I mean sour like sherry vinegar and tart cherries.IT's a great beer for what it is,Iam not a huge fan of the style but I know it fits the bill very well."
"If you can get your hands on this brew- drink it!"
"Wow, this is a great Flanders Red. So much flavor & sensation packed into this beer, it almost needs an intermission. One of the best Flanders Reds I've had."
"O: Not nearly as sour as I thought it would be. It's there, but much of the palate is mildly sweet as well."
""
""
""
"Dirty light brown head falls quickly enough that it's dropped by half by the time I get a picture. Distinct sourness in the nose along with a sharp cherry supported by dark fruit, malt and clean oak. Puckering sourness, fresh cherry and sweet malt in the taste the lingers pleasantly. Acidic punch lessens and the oak expands as it warms, improving the balance. Assertive and well blended, Cuvee des Jacobinsis a classic of the style."

"O: B+"
"very interesting beer here! pours a sensational deep daunting ruby red color with incredible richness and a more than 2 inch tall off white head thick as whipped cream. smells like sour cherries, crab apples, and funky yeast. there is quite a strong sour hit of vinegar in the nose. the flavor is curiously vinegary. very tart cherry essence, and some mild spice from the yeast. i find it to be a bit heavy on the vinegar front for me, its a way different kind of sour than the brett beers. feel is good, well carbonated with a fuller body. i think its perfect for the complex and weird flavor. overall not a bad beer, in fact a very well crafted beer, but too much vinegar sour dryness of flavor for me personally. im not sure id like to have more than one of these at a time."
""

"Pours a red tinted dark brown with a thin off white head. The smell is mainly apples with a hint of cherry and wood. There is also some vinegar in there too. It tastes sweet and sour with lots of cherry and vinegar, with some hints of fresh green apple. The beer is thick with low carbonation and a tangy dry finish. I really enjoyed this sour, I think it's one of the best ones I've tried."
""
""
""
"reddish copper pour with no head. The aroma is a touch of sulfur, vinegar, and some modest sweetness. The taste paints a different picture with ripe, tart cherries, a little woodiness and very modest sour bite. It wouldn't be a real sour without a slight stomach ache, but it burns so good. This beer is an incredibly modest Flanders and I can see why it's so highly rated. So $3.33/ 12oz, I must be in heaven. It's something I can't wait to grab in bottles."

"O- Sours are not my thing. As sours go, this is one of the better I have had, so I don't want to rate it poorly."
"The flavor hits the palate with both sour tartness and sweet maltiness, and what a glorious balance it is. Cherries are luscious and juicy at first, but grip the sides of the palate with a sharp, tart bite. Very much like sour cherry pie, with the crust included. A hint of cocoa and oak barrels flash in the middle before the finish of dry, crisp sourness. Although Rouge is a sipper, it never once tires the tongue. Very drinkable, and the tart medium body is perfectly carbonated. I'm exuberant to have this sour beer distributed in Texas, and the price point makes it all the sweeter."

"Pours a clear deep ruby red color with a thin edging which leaves strands of sticky lace around the glass. The aroma is faint and is of vanilla, cherry, and faint oaky notes. The taste follows suit with a big cherry vanilla taste which gives way to a great sourness. There is also notes of oakiness and spices when you let in play on the tongue, almost like a red wine flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall this is a very good beer, the aroma was hard to get to, but the rest of the beer was very good. The taste was well crafted with a nice complexity and smoothness."

"I'm impressed, to say the least. A fine example of the flanders red ale, if I may so inexperienced-ly may say so. Amazing flavor, cascading, and complex, just as the label mentions."
"This really reminded me quite a bit of Duchess, but more fruity. I thought Duchess was the fruitiest Flanders Red, but this one takes the cake. I think I'd rather have something that doesn't taste so fruit juice-ish, and more beer-ish to be honest. It was interesting, but maybe a bit young. I know the alcohol content suggests it shouldn't be aged, but I'd like to see what happens to this beer in a year or two. I'm thinking the sweet juice flavors might take a backseat to some other complexities that would develop."

"12oz bottle $5.99. Dark red-brown color, good head at first and then a film of bubbles. Smells a bit like cherries, wood, brett adn possibly pedio(?), I anticipate it will be sour.

"This beer is more of a slow sipper than some other Flemish Sours due to its extreme tartness but very refreshing nonetheless. Extremely enjoyable and complex Flemish red."
"D -- A must try for any self confessed sour fanatic, and a fantastic representation of the style. Amazing."
"11.2 oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a very reddish brown with a finger of off white head. Bottle conditioned. Sour cherries and vinegar in the aroma. Light bodied. Very tart and acidic, more tart cherries. Sour pucker in the finish. Little bit of oak. Very drinkable. Nice to see this in bottles."

"Overall: Such an enjoyable, drinkable, complex, and flavorful flanders red. From the introductory nose of black cherry, and vanilla to the beautiful brilliance in its clarity, to the bright tart fruity and sweet acedic flavor, to its long drawn out dry oak finish, this is an incredible beer that I will have on hand at all times."

"(D)- Color me surprised, but this is just an excellent example of a Flanders. A bread I have never heard of, but I always welcome finding a diamond in the rough. A great sour for your money that does not break the bank either."
"Recently learned more about sour beers after a California vacation and sampling some RRs and the like. Had this beer on tap at the Blind Tiger in NYC in a little tulip glass. Pours a dark ruby red, great whif of sourness that'll nock your socks off. First sip, you're hit with the wonderful sweet and sour combination, definitely taste the cherry as well. Can smell vinegar. For anyone who has never had a sour or wants to explore them, this is a great one to try first!"

"To keep it short this is probably the best Flanders Red I've ever had, Oude Tart can give it a good run for it's money though. Flanders is my favorite style as well so I've tasted a few in my life.

"Too easy drinking and thrist quenching A great beer shore to please."
"Pours a clear cranberry juice color with a light tan head that settles to a thin cap. A foamy curtain of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour and tart cherries and berries and some slight woody aromas. Taste is of sour and tart cherries with some slight berry flavors and an earthy and funky wood flavor. There is an acidic quality that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some very nice sour and tart aromas and flavors."

"O: Amazing and a beer I could enjoy regularly if it was significantly easier to procure. Love the intensity of the sourness and the complexity of the beer."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the sourness. It was so tart, and so delicious. The musk and funk comes through insanely well in the nose, and doesn’t disappoint. The feel is also something to brag about. This beer goes close to being over the top, but never overwhelms the drink. This was a true treat."

"Going from one historical reference to another... This one pours a clear scarlet-garnet topped by a finger-and-a-half of off-cream foam. The nose comprises red wine vinegar, oak, tart black cherry, light caramel, and light tomato juice. The taste holds notes of tomato, red vinegar, black pepper, raisins, toffee, deep cherry, light oak, and hot cinnamon. It all comes together very well without coming across as abrasive or stinging. The body is a slight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a tasty Flanders red, one of the most enjoyable of the style I've yet encountered."

"Bottle to fluted tulip. Looks good; very little head and a deep mohagony. Smell is good too. You can definitely tell it's a sour red. Tastes GREAT! Like an upgraded Monk's Cafe. Mouthfeel is great too, considering it's style. Overall, a great beer that is my new favorite of it's type."

"11.2 ounce bottle, with an 01 stamped on the back label. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy reddish/brown color and has about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like tart cherries, oak, vinegar, and a bit of vanilla. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like tart and sweet cherries, vinegar, oak, dark fruit, and some sugar. Even though the tart flavors are stronger, the sweet ones are still noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and is well carbonated. I think it's a good brew, I liked it. $4.99 a bottle."
""
""
"O: This is a near excellent Flanders red ale, though I feel that in terms of depth it does not compare to any of the authentic Rodenbach offerings. Still, it is good and is yet another step in the right direction for Brouwerij Bockor. Hopefully, I'll get the opportunity to try this again in the near future."

"On tap at ChurchKey poured into a sampler glass. Poured a cloudy brown color with a mostly lasting frothy light brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy sour tart cherry, fruit and yeast aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy sweet&sour dark fruit flavor with a medium to heavy sour dark fruit finish of moderate to long duration."

"Dark rusty red. Solid finger of beige head. Sour cherry with hints of leather and tobacco. Flavors are similar to the nose. The sour cherry is the most dominating. However hints of leather, caramel, coffee and tobacco come through. Medium creamy body. Great all day sour for my money. Every time I go somewhere that has this i end up drinking several glasses. Can't wait for bottles to hit the states."

"DRINKABILITY: This is a sipping beer and I wouldn't want to have more than one in an evening -- probably as a first beer.

Definitely a big ""wow factor"" here but once you get used to the sourness, the flavors really start to pop out."

"O/D-What a great Flanders Red. I love how intensely sour this is. Definitely a sipper. But very, very tasty. Happy to have had a glass."
"Taste is very tart with little to no carbonation. I am not a sour fan, however I have had quite a few because I have friends that keep trying to convert me to the sour side. That said, I like this one. Very tart, but the fruit sweetness balances it out. A pretty good beer."
"O: This is a very good beer. Definitely worth seeking out. A very big surprise to me."
"Nice mouthfeel, prickly carbonation and smooth. Nice, dry finish."
"medium/full bodied with a nice acidic bite to it. Very good feel as well. This is a real quality sour and gives just the right amount of sourness"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Easy drinking and enjoyable at first, it is nice and sharp. Overall a good representation of the style but I was not enjoying it as much through the 2nd half of the glass. As it got warm, it got less enjoyable."
"Good wine-like fruit qualities on the nose with a great balance of fruit and acidic flavors on the tongue. Plenty of drying and puckering moutfeel as well. A well rounded Flanders red."
"As it went on I found this to be quite a chore to drink. Probably still not quite my thing."
"I can't wait to have this beer again. It's truly a memorable pour."
"Being new to sours, I don't know if I could drink it over and over, etc... but I enjoyed this one thoroughly and it was a great beer to enjoy with salty food."
"Overall: i will drink this beer again the moment i have the chance. really wonderful stuff."
"deep and dark red in color with a light tan head that came up to a height of around two inches before settling back down and leaving tons of lace all over the sides and bottom of the glass while never really falling much below the one inch level. The aroma was lightly tart, sour cherries, hints of earthy and spicy notes and even a touch of what seemed like brown sugar or something along those lines. Really very well done and quite complex. The flavor was a little less tart then what I would have liked but I have to admit was still done very well. Rich and full, it was never flat or boring and I have to admit I found myself returning back"
"Great balance of acidic sour and sweet fruit flavors. A delicious and classic example of the style--disappointed I couldn't pull off more aroma from this one."
"D - one if, if not the, best flanders red ales red I have had. Super sour and nice vinegar flavors."
"Overall Impression- Very complexed, sour, and gives the Flanders Red Ale style a good name! Such a huge amount of yeast in this beer, it was crazy when I received my glass! Fantastic ale once again @ Naja's!"
"O: I think Cubee Des Jacobins Douge is a very bright, lively Flanders sour ale--a pleasure to drink on a Friday afternoon. "
"When i first had this a few years ago I actually couldn’t finish this complete as the tartness was a bit much for me…even for the style, which is something I thought I liked. It actually started to hurt my stomach. But upon having again now, it was delicious and not a problem to drink. Maybe my palate has changed, or maybe the first pour years ago was more sour somehow. Anyway, this is worth a try if you like sour Flemish reds."
"Overall - a solid sour. I was surprised at how tart it is. Really enjoyed this one. I'll definitely order it again should I happen to see it."
"Cuvee Des Jacobins Rouge pours a deep brown, with significant cherry highlights when the beer is backlit. There's a thin bit of dark cream colored foam that tops the beer. The nose is about what one might anticipate from the style. There's a definite acidic presence in the nose that's counterbalanced by a cherry pit aroma that nicely displays both some fruity notes and woody ones as well. I just wish that those aromas would have stood out more against the sour aspect of the nose. Cherry fruitiness definitely gains prominence to balance the vinegary nature of the beer, but at the expense of that nice subtle oak presence that is in the aroma. The body is nice and light, but the carbonation is a bit overdone and is distracting at times. Overall a solidly brewed Flanders Red Ale, though I still haven't found one that quite measures up to Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"Lighter body, good feel from the carbonation. Very nice for the style."
"I just had this on draft at Always Ron's in Hagerstown, MD. The beer had a very nice bronzy red color with a nice opaque head. You could tell from the smell that this beer was going to make you pucker in a good way. The taste was everything I hoped it would be. The sourness was immediately apparent but their were some other nice notes of dark fruit and fresh bread. It had a very nice carbonation in the mouth that made it feel very refreshing despite the beautiful tartness. If you dig sour beers, this is one to drink."
"On tap at Brugge in Indianapolis for Sour Night. It arrived looking like a Coca Cola without carbonation. It smells of sour and tart cherries, granny Smith apples, and pears. It's very interesting yet pleasant. The flavors too are heavy on the cherries and sour apples. It's very nice. The sourness is very well meshed with the fruity sweet finish. It drinks well and is definitely worth trying again. This is a fine beer."
"As with the Rouge, the beer is like a vinegary and lactic acidy version of a Dr. Pepper with some beer style carbonation and characteristics added in for good measure. The flavor is truly remarkable and unique. It is something I would definitely go out of my way to have again."
"O - Really nice for the style. Maybe a bit too puckering for the style, but that is just my personal preference."
"O- loved this on tap it was sweet and tart a treat to drink"
"Sweet tasting with loads of cherry flavor. Nice sour bite, with a lasting feeling of acidic etching on my enamel. Pretty much spot-on for the style, maybe a bit too much vinegar for my tastes but it fits the Flanders Red bill. Light carbonation and low ABV make this easy to pound, but I kept it at a leisurely nursing speed. Recommended."
"Never had a Flanders this intense in terms of its lactic sourness, a nice development. Can really seem like you get the gritty red wine tannins up in this one as well. But the body is so light, not murky brown alesque that some lesser examples in the style will have. Very clean, takes on its own green appleness later. Clean and complex, how did they do it? Wouldn't be surprised if there is raspberries to this one as well, the color is bright enough, reminscient of Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus."
"Overall: This really connected with what I was after at the moment. The combination of dark fruits and a fire hose blast of sour really rocked my palate."
"Overall a pretty tasty beer that seems to have an interesting mix of good qualities. Not aggressive and an easy drinking abv to go along with it."
"Overall I was really happy with it!"
"Overall: A very nice and smooth sour beer. The balance is quite nice as well. I enjoyed this one very much."
"I like my sours on the extreme side, and this beer definitely delivers! I only had one glass. Not sure I would want more than that in one session. I feel like a little goes a long way, but I sure do enjoy a little!"
"overall: very very good"
"Overall -- Very nice. Quenching would be an apt description. Nice depth of flavors and tartness level to remain a contemplative beer while still being easy-drinking. Paired perfectly with my Belgian frites."
"Big thanks goes out to my doppelgänger for picking this one up at GBX and sharing with me this past weekend! Served from growler into a Stone nonic. Poured a dark yellowish brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk. and a nice floral followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a damn good brew. For the ABV on this one it wasn't overly easy to drink large quantities of this one surprisingly. I did manage to knock out half a growler in around an hour though. The floral followthrough was quite refreshing on the palate and seemed to wake it up for your next sip. Pretty nice aroma and flavors going on here. Really glad I got the chance to try this one as it was quite enjoyable."
"This is a very well done Flander's red ale that retains just enough malt character to add balance and complexity to the sourness. Where vinegar and cidery overtones are a general flaw, the basalmic and fresh crabapple sturdiness is as much an asset as a deterant in this classic example."
"O - Very good ale and I would recommend it if you can obtain it."
"You can almost always expect a Flanders Red to be a treat, and Cuvée des Jacobins is another example you can put on that list."
"An hour later I can still feel the woody sourness. What a great vinegar this would make! Had a tulip glass at the Pizza Port in Ocean Beach (San Diego)."
"O: a refreshing drink. Might be too sour for some. I would try again."
"O: This one is very easy to drink if you like sour beers."
"Drinkability is not very high, from a sessionability perspective. The sourness here is mouthwatering. I love it, but I can't drink it fast, or even more then one a session. But oh, that one, wow - pain is pleasure!"
"Although I haven't had much experience with this type of beer, the flavor is very potent and a little goes a long way. But it's very good. I would order this beer again if I had the chance."
"On tap at Rattle 'N' Hum. A very good sour, dark reddish body with no head. Simplistic,simply very sour cherry .A little vinegar balanced by some malt. Medium mouthfeel, though some fruitness as if the skins of the cherry there. Some lace dots. I cannot pass up this style.Suitably carbonated."
"This is a very balanced Flemish red, one of the best I have ever had. Great drinkability and flavor left me craving more. A great find if you can get it!"""

"review #420... possibly the best flanders red i've ever had. or is it an unblended old lambic? makes me wish there was a rating between 4.5 and 5.0. clear brown with a tan head that has decent retention and leaves some chunks of lace as it goes. nose is brighter, cleaner, purer and less sweet than it's more commercial counterparts. dark fruit, vinegar, wood, a touch of almost salty minerality, and some really nice earth as well as just a hint of bretty cherry pie. hard to explain what i mean by clean or pure here, but the funk seems unadulteratedly natural. taste is balance and harmony of all of the above with sweet and sour at near perfect levels. medium body is soft and silky with enough pucker power to make me salivate, and nowhere near cloying or sticky. just seems to go down sooo easily and way too quickly. flavors explode on the palate to be wiped clean by acid and mild carbonation. truly a great experience. amazing beer."
"From my experience, this is one of the best examples of a Flander Red. It's almost like drinkable vinegar, which sounds weird, but once your palate has adjusted is completely addictive."
"D - This is a really delicious Flanders Red Ale. Glad I found this one on tap."
"taste is delicious - refreshing, dry sour cheries, mouthfeel is nice very puckering and nice carbonation mmmm"
" D- This beer is really easy to drink and the full tartness is very pleasant. There is a nice blend of tart and fruit flavors with the oak offering good support. This beer goes down fast and so does the next glass."
"On tap at Toronado in San Francisco. We don't have many sours in Ontario, so I made sure to make my way through every sour on their tap list. Pours an amber-brown colour with off-white head. The smell was both sweet and sour, with cherry and raspberry I think. Nice combination of sweet and sour in the flavour. Smooth mouthfeel. Very nice beer."
"Overall very tasty, delicious beer at much cheaper than most sour/flemmish beers."
"Very drinkable..."
"This is a delicious Flanders Red that I thoroughly enjoyed. The only thing keeping me from having another is its high price tag. At $8/glass I have to consume it as a once in awhile treat rather than an everyday guzzler."
"D- first time trying this style and I was pleasently surprised, I found it refreshing and look forward to drinking it again."
"I'm on snifter #2 as we type. This stuff is truly irresistible."
"Pours a nice cherry red with a bit of brown as well. Nose brings forward a good deal of sourness as well as some cherries and oak. A bit of an acetic character. The taste is vinegar, cherry, oak, and a bit of sweetness. Great, creamy mouthfeel. Drinks quite well, although the acetic character gets to be a bit much after awhile."
"Came out with a finger of off-white head that retained itself nicely and left some lacing. Deep garnet/ruby body with lighter tinted edges. Strong vinegar scent, but I can clearly make out cherries, wood, and ""grandpa's old coat"" must smells. Tastes of sour cherries which give way to funky yeast and grainy malts with a gently lingering aftertaste of cherry, now sweet, and wood chip flavors. Dry, crisp, and clean with a light body and fair carbonation. Extremely refreshing and very tasty, this is a beer that I wish were bottled for sure!"
"My first Flanders Red, and by the looks of it, I got my ""cherry"" popped by one of the best!"
"Eh. Not my cup of tea normally, but pretty good."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thin tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has an excellent malt scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It has a nice caramel malt sweetness with a very nice sour yeast character. The taste is sensational. It has a very aggressive sourness that hits you hard up front and leaves you puckering in the finish. The malt character is great. It has a sweet, caramel flavor with some subtle roasted notes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a perfect flanders ale. What a work of art!"
"D- I do enjoy my sour and this is a good one. I'm ready to get some probiotics up in me."
"Pours a deep amber with creamy dense head. Aroma of citric acid, with strong sour cherry presence. Sour cherry carries into the taste, and is joined by tart blackberry and granny smith apple. Lactic acid comes on strong, with an astringent puckerieness. Leaves my mouth feeling puckered a dry. Refreshing and delicious--a classic Flanders red, sour and assertive without the velvety complexity of oud bruins. Yummy"
"Found on tap at the Lion's Pride in Brunswick, Maine this has a dark cherry tinged mahogany color with a decent slightly pink cream colored head and nice lacing on the tulip glass. The aroma is a tart cherry, baked apple and seven-up with a slight maple malt hint and pepperwood. Nice except for the somewhat soda-like hint. The flavor comes on with bright tartness, sharp sour cherry with maple and oak malt suggestions. I get pineapple over some sweet fruit nougat, but the theme is, of course, tart berry in a medium light bodied brew with very tasteful but lively, fine carbonation. Very drinkable if you like the style, and I do! Beautiful."
"I had a twelve ounce glass of this at the Amsterdam Ale House in Manhattan's Upper West Side. This is one of the best Flanders Reds I've had. Great sour flavor with great malt character and all in a beer under six percent. Aroma was not the beer's best character but i can't wait to go back to the bar and order another."
"Pours a hazy, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of dark citrus, tart malt, hint of alcohol, and strong sour notes. Fits the style of a Flanders Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is a strong tartness and sourness. One of the most unique mouth feels I've had. Tastes of slight sweet malt, slight tart malt, slight citrus, slight alcohol, and strong sourness. Overall, I've never had a Flanders Red Ale, but this was an awesome experience."
"Excellent Flanders Red and I always order it when I see it on tap...now only if we could get some bottles so I can start hoarding..."
"D: Very intense... but I loved it. Sure, I couldn't drink it all day, but beers like this are showing me how much I enjoy this style."
"Pours a dark garnet color with a a light thin head sitting atop. The taste on this one is incredible it is complex and strong with a bold and refreshing tartness. The mouthfeel is one of the coolest things about this beer. It has a high acidity level with strips the palate and the leaves a tannic chewiness in its wake. A simply stunning example of the the style if you enjoy sours I can't imagine anyone not liking this one."
"Jacob pours in the glass with a dark deep plum red with dark brown interwoven. Just some sparse bubbles on top barely nothing, no lace. Smells include big cherries and plum and a nice vanilla sweetness with oak big as well. some chocolate and small vinegar nose. Taste is great with a nice mix of cherry flavor backed by a small chocolate bite, like a hershey kiss. Plums and vanilla with some sweetness and tartness, not overly sour. Not funky, just oaky. woody allen. Flavorful. Feel is smooth from some malt and a chocolate vibe but it's also tart and bold. Id say medium bodied with light carb. I like how the vinegar is low, if it was more I would not like this. Is this the same beer as Ommegang Rouge, if it is, this has a bit more of a body on er. Very similiar. This is quite drinkable, in fact I ordered a second from a very eclectic tap list and a rarely order the same beer twice at a bar. Good stuff."
"The beer pours a dark reddish-amber with a tan colored head. The aroma is very wine like with some tart grapes and cherries as well as some woody notes. The flavor is very dry with lots of medium tart cherries and grapes. There is also some tannic oak notes. This is a very wine like beer that is very easy to drink."
"Nose is reddish brown, not much visible carbonation,thin layer of head after careful pour. Nose features the funk with cherry notes, little if any hop presence. This is one funky tasting sour, good dose of tartness. Medium mouthfeel with nice tart finish. This is my first stab with this little known brewery, and while this offering may lack the complexity of Rodenbach, etc, this is a nice interpretation of ht style with high drinkability. Most definitely worth a try for fans of the style. Recommended."
"Toronado. A good to very good Flanders Red, which is always a treat. I tried this beer against Rodenbach Grand Cru, and, though it wasn't quite up to that world class beer, it still had a quite good showing. Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge looks about the same as any Flanders Red, perhaps leaning toward red rather than mahogany. Small white head. This beer smells and tastes of raspberries, cherries, oak and sour. It's actually not too far from the Rodenbach beers - perhaps three quarters of the step between normal Rodenbach and the Grand Cru, though without that beer's lovely feel. The beer was a bit more acidic than the Grand Cru, and it was fruitier and sourer to the GC's woodier, more refined nature; still quite good. This was a satisfying Flanders red and a very good beer."
"D - Starts to run a little too sour on the end to drink tons of, but not bad. Got through the glass easily enough."
"D: GOOD!"
"D-Really easy drinking for a sour and a good introduction to the style, but I like mine a little more mouth-puckeringly sour."
"Tasted on draft at Quenchers. Pours very dark amber with a thin white head. Nose of brett, vinegar, red apple, citrus, and some cereal. Flavors of red wine vinegar, sour raspberry, red apple, and quince. Carbonation is very lively with a lighter body and a medium finish. This is a great example of what a sour beer should be. It isn't the best, but a prototypical example."
"At Toronado. Pours a dark amber/brown w minimal lace. Strong funk and tartness up front, cherries, green apple, hops and lime. Flavors are intense sour cherry, apple, raisin and the slightest vanilla and tobacco. This is a rich, young and explosive sour beer, easily aged for another decade."
"The sourness does not overwhelm, and shockingly to me, I found this to be an easy drinker. I'm not sure I'd get it again, but happy I tried it."
"On tap at Toronado. Crimson-hued with a thin white cap, nice clarity and color. Smells like sliced cherries soaked in balsamic vinegar. There's a light funk, a bit of musty wood. Firm acidic bite on the tongue with a touch of sweet dark malts beneath. Cherry skin and flesh, tart red apple, light oaky astringency. Acetic acid is at a nice level, prominent without being stomach-churning. Drying woody finish that ends on a green apple and cherry note. Really enjoyable stuff."
"M/D - a bit of a zip to the mouthfeel, good flavor and mouthfeel, I would definitely drink this again."
"Drinkability - Very refreshing and enjoyable."
"Had stayed away from this based on a friend's bad review, but I must say that I really enjoyed this beer. Fantastic nose: Green apple, funk, and a bit of vinegar. Taste has all the Flanders Red requirements: dark fruit heavy with cherries, funk, and a pleasant lactic sourness. Crisp and dry. Utterly drinkable. Glad I took the Metro tonight."
"Very approachable to a novice sour drinker, but with enogh complexity and purity to staisfy a more demanding palate. A very fine and true example of the style."
"D: One of the better examples of a Flanders red ale that I've had lately. Very nice acidity and fruit flavors. I look forward to having this one again."
"D: great Flanders Red Ale, somewhat similar to La Folie or Rodenbach with a very assertive sour profile and just enough wood and fruit to make it something interesting"
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied, but I found it a little bit harder to put down since there was more sourness than flavor."
"Sour grape and mild vinegar sharpness in the nose, a mild level of funkiness (of unknown origin). Sipping this, there's a clear fruity component of lemon, sour grapes, and cherries. Puckering at first, leading into a drier finish. It's moderately sour, not as sharp as La Folie, more to the level of Rodenbach. It was very crisp and quenching. Well made and drinkable, this would be nice in warmer months."
"D: Weighing in below 6%, with a solid flavor and not too much acetic tartness, what's there not to like."
"Beautiful deep ruby red with red highlights, this beer is very attractive despite the lack of head. The nose has a beautiful sour character with a great acetic bite that is well-complemented by vanill and sour cherries. Fruity and awesome. The palate is so like the Ommegang Rouge! A big acetic bite to open things off, refreshingly so, there's a pleasing amount of vanilla and ripe sour cherries, fruity and tart. Low in tannins, this beer finishes dry and tart with a pleasing vinegar character. Light in body with medium-high carbonation, this beer is insanely refreshing."
"Well-attenuated and pleasant flavor, with lots of green apple sourness, cherry sweets, and a touch of vinegar acidity. Carbonation is high but not overly done. Easy to drink a glass, but not much desire for another. A well-done but not world class Flanders red."
"First glass very drinkable. Second one gets you with the acidic nature. The bartender said at 5.5% he could drink it all night long. I could not with the acidity. Having said that, I loved this."
"Palate is smooth with mild acidity and lively carbonation. Body is medium-light. This adds to the drinkability, which is high for a more sour beer like this. Big fan of these Flanders reds, and this is a good example of that style."
"This beer hurt my face when I drank it. My whole face puckered when I drank, the corners of my cheeks ached. My face kind of aches just from the memory. What I'm trying to say is holy sour batman. This is one sour mother of a beer. So tart, but the beer finishes cleanly. A good palate cleansing beer. Body was a little thin, but the drinkability is fine. Interesting and good beer."
"Served in a tulip. Poured a hazy plum with a two inch, creamy, off-white head. Nose was dark fruit with some hints of wood. Taste follows nose - extremely flavorful; dark fruit and vinous with a pleasant tartness. Mouthfeel was light-medium with some astringency and a tartness short of a pucker that stimulates the salivary glands in the cheeks. Incredibly flavorful, particularly considering the abv. One of my favorite examples of the style."
"Mouthfeel is good and this is very drinkable despite its tartness."
"The guy who filled my growler said this beer was more or less the same as Ommegang Rouge -- that Bockor had been brewing it under contract. It's definitely very similar, but, as he also said, a little fresher. Looking forward to seeing this one in bottles some day."
"drinkability is great. a very easy-going and mellow flemish red with a drinkable character and an approachable aura. could be more sour but still very well put together. cheers!"
"Served in a Delirium tulip glass @ Lucky Baldwin's, Pasadena, CA"
"D: This is a good example of the style all around and has a real nice mix of tastes. No problem drinking this one down, nice to have a good beer from a brewery I've never heard of before especially in this classic style."
"On-tap at toronadoSD. Had just finished a dogfish 90minute ipa and was in the mood for something new and different. Poured into a tulip. A little too cold fresh from the tap, as is often the case. Nice amber color, good aroma. Letting it linger in the mouth reveals some nice underlying malty brown ale-like flavors underneath the sourness."
"Seek it out and drink it down."
"A really dark red beer with some visible carbonation. It smells a little fruity, mostly cherries. The beer also tastes very cherry, with a serious sour after taste. The beer was very light and carbonated - almost tasting fizzy. Enjoyable and really pushes the idea of what to expect when you sit down to drink a beer."
"D- Not too sour and very well balanced. Overall, a really good example of the Flanders Style ale without being too vinegar-y."
"D- I enjoyed trying this beer, but could not consider ordering another 12 oz. glass... the sourness and dryness of the beer becomes overpowering with time (perhaps as the beer warms?), and I prefer to have the accompaniment of ""sweet"" with this style."
"Bring on the Funk, Bring on the Sour! A great pour of dark cherry red. Smells of dried cherries, a little lemon and Belgian Funk! The taste is even better. Gives that great sour cherry pucker at first, then you get the great funk you get from good Belgian beers. Nice dry smooth mouthfeel. Not a bitter sour but a good sour."
"This is a very sour and refreshing flanders red. Dare I say I like it more than La Folie, gasp!?"
"Very well done example of the style. Tawny red in color with a tightly compacted, meringue-like head which dissipates quickly. Sharp lactic notes upfront with a measured amount of acetic acid and a refreshingly dry finish. Dried dark cherries, lactic acid, balsamic vinegar and wet leather predominate on the nose with a slight chocolatey/toasted malt undertone. Medium-thin mouthfeel. I know it's a bold statement but this rivals both Rodenbach Grand Cru and Panil. If you can find it, try it."
"Notes: I was hesitant to order this at $9 a pour, but I found it to be a very nice and unique red, somewhere between Rodenbach Grand Cru and St bernardus ABT 12 with some gueuze to lighten it up."
"Draught at Dirty Truth. Pours opaque dark red without much of a head. Smells surprisingly sweet, with lots of typical sour cherry. Pretty acetic. A bit of barnyard 'funkiness', though that's really in the back seat here. Tastes of sour cherry, with artificial sweetening pretty evident, unfortunately. Quite fruity. Not what one would expect of a sour/lambic mix."
"D - Super-easy to drink. A very good sour!"
"D - Could drink a bunch of these. Very smooth was so glad I got to try this very good !!!"
"Taste is quite the kick, strong sour/tart presence but after the first few sips you get used to it, good fruity presence with good carbonation, not thick or sugary or cloyingly sweet either, a good balance overall and a good sourish selection for a new Maine beer bar to have."
"Reccomended especially if you like sour, funky beers. Great example of the style."
