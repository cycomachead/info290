"O- decent, strange aftertaste"
"Check it out and share with someone not familiar with the style."

"This tastes like it could have used some more time souring. It's interesting, and not a bad Flanders Red, but it's not particularly exceptional in any way. Might be worth a try, might improve over time."
"it's citric and decent up front but has no depth or complexity. That's about it."

"For a random shelf grab American made Flanders Red, this is pretty nice IMO. A good level of fruit flavors and that nice acetic tartness characteristic of the style."

"Overall- Solid effort from Grey Sail and I look forward to possibly more sours to come from them."
"This was a surprise to see on shelves. For being open for a little over a year, Grey Sail has put out quite a few good beers in a variety of styles. They're a class act and I'm happy to find another reason to support them. This is not an overwhelmingly sour beer, but it's got a unique flavor with a lot of brown ale characteristics. Really enjoyed this one."
"I wanted this beer to be good and it looked fine, but that is where it ended. As a big fan of sours I was excited to see this local offering, unfortunately it smelled like an unwashed mash tun after a few days. I tried to drink it but the taste was like licking the walls of said mash tun, an unfortunate drainpour."
