"Certainly one of the more balanced flanders style beers I've had. Nice sweetness and a mellow tartness. Worth trying."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/2018. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, cherry skin, vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, musty funk, light leather, caramel, toast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of tart cherry, earthy/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, caramel, toast, vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, light leather, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, cherry skin, caramel, toast, oak, clove, vinegar, hay, straw, light leather, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of tart/sweet cherry, earthy/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt sweetness; with a good sweetness/tartness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly slick/acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Flanders red ale. All around good balance and complexity of tart cherry, earthy/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"o - Overall a nice flanders/kriek style beer. More sweet than sour but lots of cherries, which I love. Worth checking out but not really a big sour."
""
""
""
"Overall: I've been impressed with almost every Logsdon beer I've tried and this one is no exception. One of the most refreshing higher ABV beers I've had as well. Worth picking up if you can find it. I'd also be interested to see how this ages as well."

"Overall a pleasant beer by Logsdon. Complexity is not tremendous but the flavors that are there flow nicely. Drinks lighter than a Flanders red and not as sour as lambic krieks. I like the subdued characters as the drinkability increases. Makes for a nice summer drinker."

"O: It has good flavors but it could be a little louder. Good balance though and the sour doesn't dominate at all."

"This is very good, very light and has the effervescence of champagne."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is an easy drinking kriek but overall middle of the road by all regards. It is very mild and approachable but I wouldnt purchase this again."
"O: This is good, but I've had much better. (Like Rodenbach Grand Cru). Anyways, I would recommend it to people who like the style, but I would not have another."

"Overall: this beer is good, but I don't feel like it is living up to all it could be. This isn't a particularly subtle style, so this beer oughtn't be holding back, yet it seems to be. It's quality, but it doesn't seem like it's doing enough."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad Flanders. Well worth a try."
""
"Light body and highly carbonated, lightly prickly on the tongue. A little disappointed with the taste of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is OK. It's pretty light, but there is a burn from the alcohol, what stands out fairly glaringly against very little else. For the cost and patience to cellar, I thought this would be choice on the first really hot day of the summer. While I suppose it's quenching, it a bit too subtle and hot."

"O: Somewhat disappointing. Very mild cherry and Brett with oak dominating the taste profile."

"Overall- Really nice offering from Logsdon. Definitely a unique kriek/Flanders, looking forward to trying their other stuff."

"A-"
"Overall Impression- Awesome Kriek! I'm interested in trying more American sours and this one was a great example of the style. I'm hoping to find another bottle of this or their Peche and see how they age. Recommend if available!"

"This is a graham color with some cherry hues. Theres a solid sheet of light tan foam. Smells like cherries, oak .some grain, funk and metal. Tart, sharp, cherry, oak, water, bits of soil and musk come into the flavor. It's a little watery and carries some one dimensional tartness that seems simple without the complexity I'd expect from a soured beer. Thin with light carb and a dry finish. This is interesting, hopefully there is a solera style coming out of the barrels allowing for further growth and complexity in subsequent batches."

"O- This was a nice kriek that I definitely enjoyed drinking however I probably would say it's a little bit of a disappointment next to Peche n' Brett and Seizoen Bretta. I thought it was nicely balanced with a nice subtle funk to it. It was a little bit too spritzy and the flavors could have been brought out a little bit more. I'd definitely recommend at least checking out this beer."
""
"Overall. A nice beer that's kind of a combination saison/kriek/flanders red with brett! What's not to like? I'll hang on to one for a while and see what happens."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great effort for the style and a decent drink too mild all around. Everything seems muted."
""
"Served in a tulip. Thanks, Aaron! a bit of cherry. Flavor is mild cherry and light acidity, but not quite up to the level of the rest of Logsdonâ€™s beers. It seems like this was on the right track, just not quite all the way there. Hopefully this gets made again, as I'd love to see the progression in batches of this one."

"Beer is grainy / bready with a decent finish but nothing too fruity happening. There is a mild cherry / fruitiness to the finish but overall this is just a saison. Mild peppery notes on the palate as well, hard to detect too much else. I don't think I'd have this again unless it were on draft."
"Another excellent beer from Logsdon. Pours very hazy and a somewhat reddish brown in it. Small, dissipating head. The aroma has lots of cherry flavor and funk. Some lemons and a a bit of caramel. Oak. The taste is sourer than expected. Good tartness. There's some caramel malt and cherry sweetness, but it's far from cloying. Some oak tannin in the finish. Very nice beer. Feel is full with some pucker in the finish. I've heard a few people compare it to the NG fruit beers. I think it's sourer and lacks the Belgian fruitiness. At any rate, I'm getting to be a huge fan of Logsdon."
""
"Overall - Not sour. Not terribly interesting, either. Cherry and not much else."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice funky and sour Kriek-style with some nice cherry flavor and some great funky yeast character."
""
"Pours a murky reddish-brown with a foamy brown head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some sour cherry and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild sourness and a slightly acidic finish on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and some nice flavors."
"Very interesting beer as the brett and cherry fight for control. I would have preferred a touch less brett since it got a bit overpowering as it warmed, but a unique experience nonetheless."
""
""
""
"This isn't a good example of a kriek or a Flanders Red, but it is still a tasty cherry beer. This may not live up to expectations, but taken completely on its own, it's still a very tasty beer."
""
""
"O - Lighter body and milder flavors than I was expecting. A very nice summer sipper."
"O: Tried this after peche n brett, and it was a big let down. I'm hopeful this develops some after a year, so we'll see. Lacks complexity."
"O: Easily drinkable, but could really use a little more body. I'm very interested to see how Logsdon tweaks this beer in future vintages, as well as how these bottles evolve over time."
""
"Other comments: This is highly carbonated. When I uncapped it, it immediately erupted and I lost a few ounces to the kitchen counter. This has happened with a bottle of Seizoen Bretta, too. I know they prime their beers with pear juice, so maybe that's giving some erratic results?"
