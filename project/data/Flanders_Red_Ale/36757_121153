3.77,-1.8,3.25,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,"O - This a clean, refreshing sipper that works well in the summer heat, but I would not call it a Flanders Red. The Sourness and carbonation are too ""in your face"" and it is the wrong kind of sourness, compared to Belgian originals. Rodenbach and the Duchess feature more acetic, vinegar-like character, not the lemon tartness of a lambic or Berliner weisse that this beer features. Also, I'd expect a much bigger emphasis on malt with some sour complexity, a totally different approach than this beer takes.","Radome","May 27, 2014"
