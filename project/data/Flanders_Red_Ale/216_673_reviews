"RGC was my first introduction to Belgian Sours. Nice warm, honey reddish brown color with a thin carbonated head. Vinegary, smooth, warm, sweet bitter sour. Absolutely love this beer without a doubt."
"Color is between red and brown. Nice aroma of red fruit and red wine. Taste is mixture of sour and sweet and is a bit vinous. It has a bit more character than a regular Rodenbach, hence the slightly higher score I gave it."

""
""
""
""
"My palate is pretty intrigued by this Flanders red ale. It has excellent complexity, as well as focused and controlled intensity. Much in the same way there's an art to integrating the alcohol of high strength beers into their flavor seamlessly, I think this ale artfully integrates sourness in a way that keeps it intense yet doesn't overwhelm."

"Excellent stuff here. Not sure if you like sours? Give this one a whirl. Highly recommended."

"I really like the Rodenbach...I drink it like they give you the option in Belgium...with a little bit of pomegranate syrup at the bottom....delicious!!!!"
"If this is the same Flemish Red I had at the Toronado, this is currently my favorite beer."
"This is an amazing beer. It is sweet and tart and has lots of tart fruit/etc flavor. Yet is still tastes like a beer. At only $9 a 750ml I will definitely be picking up a few more of these."

"Tart, fruity lemonade nose with light barnyard and over ripe fruit. It pours brilliant chestnut with cherry highlights and a very dense, persistent, finely bubbled, off white foam cap. It attacks with a light sweetness and then the tartness explodes with unsweetened lemon, plum, a little orange, and dark cherry. The sweet and tart oscilate through your mouth culminating in a sweet and sour finish that lingers in a long fruity aftertaste. The carbonation is above average but it has a very fine bead giving the beer a very light, creamy texture."
"It's not for me,but not bad"

"Sour but not hoppy.not bad"

"Overall a little too sweet but that's stretching for a complaint."
""
"Very dark, almost prune juice like. Grape on the nose with red wine vinegar. Grape again on the taste with a little vanilla in the background. Welchs grape soda anyone?"
"This is the classic Flander's Red.  It has quite a bit of sweetness with a very clean sour finish.  Malt and sour combine to a great complexity.  This would have received 5's from me if it were a bit more sour.  That is certainly a personal preference of mine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very impressed by this amazing beer. Reminds me of Monk's Cafe, only in my opinion a little better. Very much worth the price of 11$ for 750ml."

"My wife says it smells like hairspray. :P"

"Light brown, thick cream color head, light on taste, fruity with a refined finish. Similar to a fine wine"

"Verdict: A staple of the style, remarkably balanced and well rounded. The complexity is there, though it feels effortlessly simple to drink and explore. It hits the mark for anyone who loves a good sour, especially a Flanders Red and should be the beer that all others get compared to within the style."
""
""
""
""
"I got mostly grape notes from this, almost like a tart wine...the sourness is sharp but it finishes very clean, and it is balanced excellently with the fruit notes."
""
"Pours a clear brown with a dark ruby cast.  Above normal head volume, good lacing and retention for the style.  Excellent nose of slightly sour tart raspberries (most prevalent) and cherries over a light caramel sweetness with notes of oak.  Almost light medium bodied with a nice smooth texture that has bursts of creaminess in the finish.  Well carbonated with effervescence from the middle on.  The flavor profile is World Class and hits the marks on intensity, complexity and balance.  It begins with a slightly sweet burst of raspberry with cherry undertones.  These flavors effervesce into a nice tartness in the middle with just a touch of sourness underneath.  Coupled with these are notes of oak over a balancing caramel sweetness.  As these progress towards the finish, tartness becomes prevalent and a mildly sour puckering effect sets in.  The somewhat dry finish is a fade of fruit flavor remnants over a lingering mildly tart sourness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A lighter, flavorful sour.  A good everyday option."
""
""
""
"My new favorite beer! Hands down this is the best sour beer that I've had. Stocking up on this tomorrow! Liquor outlet boonton nj"
"Great brew and for the price a steal almost."
""
""
""
"I really fell for this beer... even read some notes on the style prior to trying it. Looked awesome in the glass, with the deep reddish, brown hue... little to no head going on here. Amazing nose, including the vinegar note (which I loved for some reason), and some crazy dark fruit medley  as well. The taste was unique, and amazing with all of the aroma notes joining the party. Pucker up! The mouthfeel was very dry, and left me wanting more. Super clean and original. Damn, just damn."

"Overall: I love sour beers and it's really difficult to find fault with this one- perfect in pretty much every respect, although some might find the slightly vinegary smell a bit offputting. Probably not the ideal starting point for sour ales, but if you don't try it you'll never know."

"I've been wanting to try this beer ever since I heard michael jackson talk about it in one of the beer hunter episodes and and additional interview, it does not disappoint, to me, this is beers answer to wine, it's very vinous and tart, tastes of dark fruits and cherry (only a bit) it is delicious and it is definitely worth your time, hint (as with most beer, have it colder rather than warmer)"

"Rodenbach Grand Cru is my go-to Flander's red. It is sour, funky deliciousness in a bottle.  The beer is also an unbelievable bargain and can be found for $10-12."
"Malt, bread, a lot of cherries, very ripe, full of flavor. Perfect chewy, tart sourness, with a fruity cherry sweetness. Decent complexity, still easy drinkable. Malt underlines the cherries till the end, holding the sourness at bay. Great balance, fruit stays in the foreground the whole time, resulting in a chewy, sour aftertaste."

"Body is light with lots of fine carbonation."

"O – This is an example of sour ale at its best. Tight but complex, light yet satisfying, and again very, very refreshing. Fantastic blend, well-balanced.  Would drink this any time, anywhere."

"Overall - This beer is a masterpiece. I'm a bit new to sour beers in general, so I was taken aback initially by the sour/spoiled fruit character, but after the first few sips or so, it just got more complex, more interesting, and more delicious until the entire 750ml bottle was gone... What a kickass beer - these Belgians really know what they're doing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have not had this beer in about 9 months so I was a little anxious to see if it would be as impressive as I remember it being after drinking many new beers. It is. It's hard to say if I'd change anything about it. I'd perhaps opt for a darker vanilla head, accompanied by a little more funk and sweetness on the nose. Tastewise perhaps a little more funkiness and weirdness. I'd love to try this beer at 10-12% just to see what the additional viscosity could do for the mouthfeel, although it's already superb. A must try."
"Tastes as much of fruit as of beer. A sour apple dum dum is not a bad comparison. Pours out brown as a bottle, 2.0 puckers out of a possible 5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very refreshing - not too heavy, not too sour, not too fizzy and big on flavour. A bit of a cherry brandy/port influence going on."

"Pours a cloudy mahogany red color with a bubbly reddish tan head with decent retention and nice lacing.  The nose…ahhh, the nose is just wonderful! Lots of toasted malt, ripe fruit sweetness, cherries, hints of oak, some subtle acidity, leather and whispers of some tart barniness. The taste is equally complex and yet so drinkable.  Really pronounced red fruit (cherries), but some deeper ripeness in the form of raisins; some toasted malt and caramel, white pepper, leather, oak.  The body is full and round, yet light on the tongue with lots of carbonation, but in no way over-carbed.  Wow, this is just a fantastic complex, subtle yet highly drinkable beer.  Truly delicious!"
"Overall: definitely the best sour beer I have had to date. Lots of complexity and an fantastic, smooth-yet-sharp mouth feel make this one a must have, even at a price of AU$130+ for 24 x 330mL. Maybe one every now and then as a treat."

"o: what an absolute delight of a beer. it's sour, fruity, tasty, and refreshing. i'm glad to have had the opportunity to taste this, and i'll definitely have this again in the future if i ever see it"
"O- Probably my favorite beer in the world; certainly my favorite of this style. I have been fortunate to try some of the vintage examples from Rodenbach, which are worth the effort to obtain."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brilliant amber with red highlights and a lingering, frothy khaki head. Aroma is laden with balsamic vinegar and oak. Tart cherry surfaces late. Flavor is slightly sweet, but the balsamic vinegar acetic notes counter to balance. Cherry notes mingle with oak, and somehow, there's an almost creamy mouthfeel. Not as tart as some, but very characterful. It's sweeter than I recall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I understand why people call this the best shelf sour you can buy. Would buy cases of this stuff next time I see it. An absolute gem, and a must-drink for any beer connoisseur."

"O: Expensive and rated high. Certainly unique, my first of this type. Not sure what to pair it with- some lighter cheeses, perhaps even blue cheese would go well, sharp cheeses like cheddar, sour fruits like cherries or raspberries, medium to light body with medium to light carbonation. Actually good at room temperature. It’s a VERY aquired taste and needs to be considered when to drink this beer. Black chunky floaties near the bottom."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice red beer, able to see through. Not many bubbles forming. Aroma is good, like lambics or gueuzes, and you can smell the sour nature of the beer. Taste is good, sour, yet sweet. It is not a straightforward sour, it is more of a cherry lambic, but very light. Mouth feel is also light."
""
""
"If you're afraid of sours...as I am...treat yourself to this. You'll probably like it more than you imagine."
"O:  great sour.  Not over the top.  But good.  Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer the regular Rodenbach. It’s in the middle between bitter and sour, slightly sweet. Although this one has a great color. It smells like wood, like it has been in a casket for a long time. It has an aged aroma. High carbonation. The sour wall hits you in the face. There is not much flavor other than sour. No wood flavor. Not really beer flavor. This should be classified as a spirit. Hard lemonade."
""
""
""
""
"o: for fans of the sour that gravitate to the sweet and sour side of things, this is a pretty amazing example of the Flanders style. Not too tart, not too sweet... right on the mark."

"Excellent beer overall, I definitely recommend trying it on tap if you can find it, although bottled is also very good. One of the easiest beers to get someone started in sours if they've never had one before moving on to some really funky stuff. Will have again."

"I had planned to add a disclaimer that a 4.9 or something here should not be construed to mean I like RGC any less than those I've ""had"" at 5. Turned out not to matter, I can find no nits to pick. This is a perfect beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a finger of tight white bubbles on top and impressive lacing. I get young grapes straight away on the nose, followed by apple pulp, a bready character, and a bit of oak from the barrels. This one starts out really sour with a lemon taste, but soon becomes much sweeter with a big red grape presence. There are slight notes of bread and vanilla, but the grape taste dominates. It gets a more puckering again on the finish with a green apple skin tanginess. The whole thing is pretty well carbonated and it's as light, dry, and easy-drinking as champagne."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rodenbach Grand Cru pours a brownish color with a small lacing head. There is a a pronounced sour aroma, with wine like notes, and subtle oak notes. The taste has a nice noticeable sour flavor, with a sweeter aftertaste, with hints of a earthy oak. Great feel, and very easy to drink. Overall its a very tasty, and easy to drink sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is smooth, with plenty of tartness and sweet notes, quite wine-like in tone. Definitely plenty of berries in there, cherries maybe, and a touch of lactic acid and wild yeast are also detectable. This one's like a melding of a saison and a sour ale. Very good, and very complex here. Enjoyed this one for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - really great all around, but I wasn't prepared to tackle the bomber myself. The sweet/tartness just gets to be too much for me with this style. Ideal serving size is probably about 10 oz."

Though not exactly my favorite take on the Flanders red style, this beer is unforgettably unique and would make for a great dinner beer; I could see it pairing with countless dishes."

"i have to thank my friend paul for sharing this with us. what a legend, thanks man. killer beer of fame here, not sure i would ever find one, but sure enough. not quite a flanders red to me, not quite an oud bruin, but some dynamic synergy of both, greater than either, and about as complex as beer can get, just so much going on in this one. hazy very dark amber color, as much brown as red, with an inch of tan head that doesnt fade at all. it smells like nutty grain on the front end, but carries with it a palate watering acidity and tartness thats short of fully sour, but lactic and enticing. the first part of the sip is malt heavy, its sweet, brown sugar and candied red grain, but it moves swiftly into a whole mouth experience that draws unusual connections between acidity, oak, and earthy grain. the sweetness doesnt last at all, and the tartness that replaces it is both surprising and welcomed. even after the swallow i taste this for miles, some preserved lemon vinegar as it dies out, but i am amazed by all the layers here. massive body, but i like that the alcohol is so manageable. so many of these get too enormous for much drinking, but this stays right in the comfortable range. as much flavor as ive seen in a beer at 6% abv. enough carbonation, i wouldnt call it lively, but its not flat either. somewhere in the upper medium range, which is a nice compliment to the complexity. i wish this came to colorado. thanks again paul for sharing such a high end and unique beverage."

"Overall: Nice tart sour ale. Very grape soda like and easy to drink. Not a huge fan of this beer, too much like drinking grape soda."
"For $10 a 750ml bottle that is year-round, I daresay it doesn't get better than this. So many flavors, combined with a predominantly soft and creamy wood aged texture, as well as delightful fruit and wine-like notes, this is a world class Flanders red. It won't kick the crap out of you, but its profile to be extra flavorful and yet so easy to drink (as well as easily pair with food) should be noted. Want to turn wine-only drinkers on to beer? This is the one!"

"A unique brew in a class of its own. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour are great - very sour and fruity. Plenty of vinegar notes. The only aspect I'm not sure about is the oxidation - I can't tell if this would be present in a fresher bottle. Lovely body that tantalises the tongue. An intriguing drinking experience and one that I must repeat (and possibly re-review). Well worth sampling if you have the chance."

"Finally got to try this classic and it did not disappoint. Poured a reddish brown body with one finger a head on top of an aroma of a lot sour and funky fruits, mainly a tart cherry aroma, a touch of wood and/or wine-like qualities and a a touch of sweetness. Beer is light bodied and smooth and not as sour/funky as it smells. The sour/tart cherry aspect is aplenty but there is a great balance of sweetness (whether it be candi sugar or fruit derived) and the funk aspect is minimal so it's not a overpowering, puckering sourness or tartness but just hits the right spot. Great carbonation so beer is lively and finishes real crisp. Just a great beer to sip with after dinner."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my favorite ale. I started drinking it in January 2014 and I haven't been able to stop. I really love the taste of vinegar, so I really enjoy that aspect of this beer. With that being said, I imagine that for some this taste could be overwhelming or even unpleasant. I really love this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer, and much like Duchesse, it is reputedly a benchmark for the Flanders Red style. Admittedly, my favorite Flanders Red was bordering more on kriek territory, with a teeth enamel-melting sourness to it, so perhaps this style isn't my favorite in the world. I am curious enough about aging it to go get a second bottle so that I can sit on it until closer to the 'drink by' date."

"O: This is only my second tart beer. (1st Cuvée Freddy). Sour beers are such a shock to my taste buds and mind that I can't even say with conviction that I like the taste. It's unique. And I don't hate it."
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent tart beer. The oak flavor really plays well with the tart fruits."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is brown in color supporting a crisp dissipating head. Smell of prominant fruity sour with some wild yeast and oaky aromas. Taste has a very nice balance of sweet and sour with the yeast and woody oak. Mouthfeel is medium light with good carbonation. Not much on sours, but one of the better sours I've tried."

"The king of the Flanders reds perhaps, there could very well be better tasting examples of the style out there but this one is widely available and a relatively recent arrival to Alberta. A russet reddish to brown color with around three inches of tan head comprised of noticeably small bubbles. Aroma is that of red wine vinegar, grape candy, tart cherry juice, red berries, and lemon. Very sour and makes the nose tingle (in a good way). I also get some light earthy malt beneath the sour assault. Taste is dry, sour, woody, fruity, carbolic, and sour. Complex and somehow manages to juggle a bright, intense fruitiness with a strong sourness such that neither component gets trumped or dominated by the other. Tastes like dilute balsamic vinegar, sour pie cherries, lemon, tamarind, raspberry, nectarine, and tea leaf, but there are also some light sultana raisin and brown sugar notes in the background. Pucker-inducing to my palate. The ABV does put in a brief appearance here and there. Body quite thin with a moderate to high degree of carbonation. Reminds me a bit of the chokecherries you could snack on in the Northern Saskatchewan bush if you were so inclined, albeit much, much tastier. I am tempted to introduce this beer to a few wine snobs I know."

"O-my first of this beer style and I was not disappointed, great beer"
""
""
""

"Notes: A fantastic beer that would be a great alternative to champagne due to the carbonic bite and sweetness. You can definitely smell the barrel in this beer. I’d like to try it directly from the finishing tank."
""
""

"Rodenbach was my revelation beer in 2013, and Grand Cru is more of the same. This is an excellent beer across the board, for someone who truly appreciates the complexities of the style, to a complete novice in wild-type ales."
""
""
""
""
"Dark, even very rich appearance, little or no head, pleasantly sour as described on the establishment's beer list minus the term ""pleasantly"". To my disappointment, it was the only sour on tap. From which I can gather that my taste buds have rare company or/and it's just not a popular taste. I'm fine with that..."
"O: Glad I found this one for such a cheap price. I wanted to buy it earlier but it costs over $20 at the local store- found it for $10. This is an awesome Flanders red ale and reminds me of Jacobins Rouge. It comes in a huge bottle as well so that you can enjoy it for a long period."
"This is very good, very tasty, and nice all around. My only complaint is that it seems to be holding out the real strength that lies within."
"O - A near perfect Flanders Red. Having it on tap is a surprise for me. I have never seen it anywhere else than my local bottle shop."
""

"O- The fruity flavors that come from this beer are amazing, considering there is no fruit used to make it, a fine beer."

"How on this world have I not reviewed this I'm sure I've tasted this before but after seeing no rating from me my memory is asking the question have I ever tried it and after a 2litre growler purchase ill be sure and on popping it pours a cherry red hue with a creamy off white two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere a beautiful looking red,the smell is musty,funky,slight oak and red grapes and highly approachable,the mouthfeel is borderlining on perfection it's medium bodied with moderate carbonation and like most have said before the taste of this Flanders is one for the non believers of this crazy beautiful style and its red grapes,beautiful funk,cherries and the finish is sour tart and bloody refreshing and overall now I'm confident I've tried this and the 2lt purchase was a great choice by me as its not on your face like most of this style and a great step in Flanders territory for virgins of the style and even veterans like me cheers."

"The Grand Cru pours a very dark and murky red-brown with a think light tan head that slowly dissipates into a thin frothy top. The smell is sour and tart like sour cherries and rotting pears. There are also elements of yeasty maybe baking bread scents. The taste starts with a punch of tartness and flows into sweet cherry flavors with hints of vanilla and oak in the rich finish. The mouthfeel is on the low end of being medium bodied and very silky and smooth. I love this beer its very nice and as far as on style I think this is the benchmark that I judge all other Flanders Red Ales by."

"O: Not particularly enjoyable. Sour, on the watery side for a dark beer ... it feels like there's just something missing. I've heard it compared to champagne ... and I guess if you want a beer glass of middling champagne, this works."

"So overall, as a beer, this is very solid as its a bridge, I feel, between an acquired style (not one that I necessarily have) and a standard beer. As I said above, a mildly adventurous beer drinker should try this to see where they might want to experiment next."

"Amazing representation of the style. Flemish red at its best. It's sour just enough but not overpowering. Smells and tastes like fresh juicy cherries. Ruby-red color and a perfect head. Some oak is present and woodiness is mixed with the fruit taste for sure. Grand cru is more refined than the regular rodenbach and for some reason I keep finding it cheaper.  Cheers to that."

"Such a unique style done to near perfection - you don't get this combination of flavors in any other style. The complexity is outstanding and the balance of sour to sweetness is amazing. Whether you're new to craft beer or a seasoned veteran, if you haven't tried this beer you need to seek it out."

"overall: for a shelf beer at $12 a bottle, this is a fantastic option for anytime. very fruit forward, so you have to like fruity beers, but this one isnt too sweet or overpowering. if it had a bit more oakiness and more sour/tart to it, it could be a top shelf flanders. but its still a great beer and even greater considering it sits on shelves. if you are in need of a sour power day, and dont want to raid the cellar, look no further"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red grape, balsamic vinegar, oak, red wine, clove, light leather, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of tart fruity ester notes with good barrel presence; and good strength. Taste of tart cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red grape, oak, clove, balsamic vinegar, red wine, light leather, light funk, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate tart acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart dark fruits, oak, hay, balsamic vinegar, red wine, light funk, light leather, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of tart fruity ester flavors with moderate oak presence; with a great malt/acidic balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately slick and acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Flanders Red ale! All around great balance and complexity of fruity/acidic flavors with moderate barrel presence; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"Very interesting first sip: Sweet, a little sour, very complex. Some cherry up front, but quickly turns less fruity than the fresh bottle earlier had been. The age makes it smoother than the fresh bottle. The sour component is preceded by a dark brown sugary malt that is quite sweet, and just the right offset for the sour. The long finish makes it easy to sip. I'm not the biggest fan of sour beers, but this is delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: A beer with amazing complexity and depth. Deftly skirts the line between beer and red wine, sour and sweet, and biting and smooth. Best described as a beer dressed up as a red wine with a sour kick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's nearly room temperature by the end of the bottle and it's still fantastic. Tons of flavor and a very enjoyable beer to drink."

"The mouth feel is nice for the style; thin, bordering on medium; my only complaint is that the carbonation in my bottle could have been higher. There isn't much more that I can say about this beer, other than the fact that it exceeded any and all expectations I had. I'm a big fan of sour beers, and I sure do love my American Wild Ales that stretch the palate towards unobtainable levels of tartness, but this beer proves that you can be both sour AND complex, and when done properly, it's a wonderful thing to behold. The fact that it's fairly readily available may be the biggest wonder of them all."

"Overall: Excellent sour, very tasty and refreshing. Its not too sweet, not too sour but everything is put together just right to make it a nice sipper on a summer or winter evening, whatever season it is. It's a versatile sour beer that would be a good introduction to sours due to it being balanced and not too over the top.. and the price is right for a barrel-aged Belgian sour- $8-12 for a 750ml is a great deal. (4.25)"

"Yep!"

" This taste is pretty incredible, lots of fruit presence as in the nose with some dark cherry and slightly tangy cherry flesh flavor with a nice amount of malt and yeast adds that lactic tang with a nice wood flavor rounding out this fine flemish red. Overall I have had this on a few occassions and it really is a treat. I was glad I could enjoy a 750ml myself but the acid was a little strong as it warmed for me- a highly drinkable Belgian, well worth having multiples of."

"Overall this is one of the best Flanders Reds I've had, right up there with Cuvee des Jacobins. This hits the perfect balance of sweet and sour. So layered and complex, I can hardly believe this is just water, barley, hops, and assorted bugs. There are just so many fruit flavors here, and the added vanilla/barrel character just brings it to that next level. The best part is its widely available and cheap relative to the style. I could drink this every day. If you are a fan of sours and haven't tried this one you need to. If you are wondering about trying a sour beer, this is a great place to start. Cheers!"

"Some Flanders red ales come almost comically close to being balsamic vinegar with alcohol, but this one is amazing and balanced. The nose belies a red-fruit sweetness, hinting at figs and cherries with a hint of plum, and when you taste, you get what you came for. Sometimes you want that Balsamic vinegar thing, and I feel this beer has enough tartness and sweetness to at least satisfy that desire without being an overpowering note. Very well-blended beer, a delight to drink, without being scary for the unprepared (my first Flanders red was way heavier than this, and might've scared me away from the style... ) all around enjoyable offering from Rodenbach, and one of my new favorites."
""
"Overall: This is my first brew of the Sours category (Flanders Red in this case), and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I was very pleased with the outcome, and with this price tag it is a must get."

"This poured out as a nice deep red color with a fizzy white head on top. Hardly any lacing and retention on this beer. The smell of the beer is slightly sour, with notes of oak and cherry. The taste is really nice, it's got a subtle tart cherry flavor with a slight sweet malt backbone. The flavors are very well balanced. The mouthfeel is light bodied, with a solid carbonation and very drinkable. Overall this beer is very good. Would drink it again anytime."

"I recieved this as part of the sours for dummies bif, poured from a 750 into a tulip. Pours murky brown with a big white head. Lots of cherries, balsamic vinegar, on the nose. The flavors blend nicely, cherries, oak, lactic acid. The beer is slightly drying, good carbonation, refreshing. A great beer, exceptional flanders."

"Very pleasant beer for the style. I love good acidity in a Flanders and this one doesn't fall into the trap of being a vinegar bomb like most. The sourness is noticable and pleasant yet restrained."
""
""
""
""
"As hearty as everything comes and as thoroughly as things express themselves, there is a very bearable lightness in their collective being. An evanescence somehow pervades, even in spite of the lack of that dark beauty, Amy Lee. Dammit, this shit just turns out to be so drinkable because of this. There are worse burdens, I s’pose."
"Its just so drinkable and tasty...get it now. If you like the style you will love this. Its damn near perfect and a guaranteed palate pleaser."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Dark and fruity with a strong wood impact, not overly sweet, well balanced."
"O: Overall this beer is not quite as tart/sour as one might think from an initial sniff, making a little more approachable for people that are new to the style. The beer is fairly easy to drink with a lighter mouthfeel, lower ABV, and not too intense flavors."
""
""
""
"The Grand Cru displays an elegant dark red body, with a slightly tanned head, and carries a well-balanced aroma with caramelized malts and discrete hops. The taste has a carbonated and refreshing acidity, well-harmonized with the hops. The aftertaste retains a little bit of the acidity, reminding you that you just had an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was delicious. I was excited to have found it on tap. It has a tremendous flavor that is complex yet drinkable. The tartness isn't overpowering either which helps the drinkability. This is not a style I typically go for, but when I saw the chance to try this one I jumped at it. I would definitely have this again. It was very enjoyable."

"Clear-ish, deep ruddy chestnut topped with a slender, bubbly cap. Tart cherry, acetone, caramel malt, mustiness, and some roast in the nose. Juicy cherry tartness, oak, dark fruit, and malt flavor. Super slick, very dry, tart, and quite refreshing. Very nice..."

"O: This was my first take on a Flanders Red. Its not what I was expecting, much sweeter and not as sour. I enjoyed it, but I much prefer the lighter feel with greater sour notes of Lambics and Gueuze's. I would drink this again if it were on draft somewhere and I was in the mood for something different, but its not something that I want to go out and buy another bottle of or a beer that would make my regular rotation. Worth a try though, for sure."
""
"Had this beer on tap at a wonderful new little bar / bistro in Stowe, VT called Crop. I am exploring the world of sours and when I saw this on tap I knew I had to get it, that and they just ran out of the Hill Farmstead Double Galaxy IPA, that was my first choice. The beer is light and refreshing with hints of cherries and a medium sourness. The flavor that is left in your mouth as you put your glass down is the part where this beer really shines. Nice to pair with a bland smooth cheese to reset your palate. I will most def. order this again."

"O: What a great beer. This is one of those beers that I keep on passing and ignoring when shopping, so so glad I finally gave it the attention it desired and well deserved. The balance of this Flanders Red is spot on, very enjoyable brew. I find myself stopping from typing to keep sipping this mouthwatering liquid. A must have."

"In my opinion it tastes better than any good champagne. Close to perfection, awesome beer."
""
""
""

"Very complex intermingling fruit and malts, sour but not puckering. It's sweeter than the Classic red but is more tart. One of my favorite Flanders."
""
"VERDICT: A magnificently-crafted beer (that I wouldn't doubt was better before Rodenbach was bought by Palm). One of the more effervescent, thinner examples of this style - seems like a bit of a joke grouping this with Duchesse, but I get it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I've never enjoyed a capped bottle of the Grand Cru previously (only draft and C&C bottles), but this was quite good. Very young and ""fresh"" for a Rodenbach, but quite tasty nonetheless."
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"O: A outstanding Flanders and a world class beer. The fruit and that sourness are strong but in balance with the other element. I'm partial to the Flanders Red style so I'm trying not to let it bias my score but this is almost perfection."
""
"O - Very drinkable with a nice depth of flavors and aromas balanced nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers, but I've only been able to have it on trips to other states until now, when it has become available in Texas. This is a great beer to be paired with many foods, but it does especially well with certain thai dishes where the sour and/or hot flavors could overwhelm many beers. It's great with pickled foods, and also with tex-mex. A classic."
""
"Overall: I am really impressed with this and I definitely will be buying this again when it’s available around me and when I’m feeling a top shelf Flanders Red again. This sits on top of the list of Belgian Red Ales so far for me. I definitely recommend this to anybody who hasn’t had this and already enjoys this style of beer and to anybody that wants to start somewhere in the range of Flanders Red Style Ales."

"Overall: This one is awesome, along with being a great value. Smell threw me off but the taste made up for it. Highly recommend to any sour enthusiast. Very refreshing and drinkable."
""
""
""
"O: A very good Flanders red, with just enough tart fruit to combat the oak. Very good price point at under $9 for a 750 mL bottle, too. Probably not the best intro for sours because of the complexity and overly funky nose, but aside from that, this is very good"
"just poured the second part of the large bottle and the color is incredible. i am truly excited about this brew. i can understand how some folks wont like the vinegar and the tartness, but i love vinegar and this is an absolutely special product. if there were a score between 4.5 and 5 available, i'd give this a 4.8. but since there isnt, i have to give it a 5 for overall. i mean, i dont think there is another beer out the which i could 'session' like i could this one, or the petrus...."
""
""
"O/ strange, bizarre ale. Honestly I can't say if I have enjoyed or I am only surprised."
""
""
""
""
"So smooth. I get a perfect amount of tartness coating my mouth and a nice cherry/ mixed fruit and then it goes down smooth and sweet. Not too acidic or cloying like the Duchesse, and the price is way too great. $9 for a 750ml may be the best beer deal next to Old Rasputin 4 packs."

"Flanders Red might be my favorite Belgian style, and Rodenbach Grand Cru is one of the best I've tried. Tart cherry & grape flavor causes the most pleasant of puckers. Nice, mild carbonation is enough to tingle your tongue and it has a synergistic effect with the tartness. What a fantastic beer."

"Poured it from a 750 ML bottle. Nice dark rusted reddish hue with a creamy 2 finger head that disapates slowly. Light lacing on the glass. Aroma is all dark cherries and toasted oak and vanilla notes. Smells tart and sour almost metallic. Taste is all sour cherries and raspberries. A little spice lingers on the palette. Mouthfeel is medium body with mouthwatering acidity and long finish. I like this as much as the Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge."

"The beer pours a murky brown like melted brown sugar, and there is a nice light cream head on top that circles the glass but leaves the middle clear. The second pour produced a bigger head with some slight tanning to it. The beer is quite dark and very murky, but there are some light carbonation bubbles. There is also a nice dark rose tinge to the color. The beer smells big and sour with strong cherry leather wafting. The alcohol is also a little present at the back of the nose, leaving a slight spicy burn. The beer also smells richly caramelly, but this is over powered by the vinegar sour which stings at the nose, and the cherry leather which plays with the caramel. The beer tastes wonderfully cherry tart with terrific and strong esters coming off the yeast and suggesting green apples and slight pineapple accents. Of course this beer is mostly about the big sour taste, and it delivers beautifully, bringing big sweet fruit notes over the tongue while it puckers the sides of my mouth. The initial rush of flavor is big with sour cherry, but as the beer opens up it really highlights the esters beautifully. The aftertaste is very strong with the apple esters and the remnants of the sweet cherry. As the beer warms the apple esters also become more dominant. The mouthfeel is prickly and effervescent with carbonation, leaving it a little harsh on the tongue, but the beer is soft and chewy, leaving the palate wet with lots of dry patches and wanting more as it puckers with the sour after-shocks. Overall this is another tasty Flanders Red that is quite cheap and easily accessible making it a great introduction to the style. I liked Oude Tart a little more than this I think, as it was thicker and got a little more caramel into the sour, but this is a terrific sipper and is worth a try."

"I think I have found the sour beer for me. It's a very reasonable price and probably the best tasting one I've tried."

"Served from tap into a Rodenbach Grand Cru tulip. Poured a deep dark ruby red with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, wood, vinegar, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, vinegar, fruit, wood, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I have had this one before out of the bottle and I have to say that It carries over quite well on-tap as well. The vinegar touch on this brew is what keeps me coming back to it over and over. This also includes the various Vintage versions that I have had in the past as well. Really enjoyable and definitely brings the pucker along for the ride to keep you on your toes. An absolute must try as Rodenbach is doing good things with this one."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with higher-level carbonation that foams the beer substantially across the palate. Overall mouthfeel is at first fizzy, then smooth and creamy, suitable for the style. Closes dryly, with notable lingering tartness on sides of palate."
"Overall: Blended vinegar and cherry juIce. Decent cold, but warms close to jelly an that's just weird."
"Flanders Reds are weird. This is no exception. On the spectrum of a ""dank sponge in a basement"" to ""straight-up vinegar," this is on the vinegar side. Nicely complex, but a little too sweet for me."
""
""
""
"Overall, good drinking, prefer this to their Classic."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Just an all around fantastic beer. The flavor is so delicious and unique that it stands out and a totally different style of beer to me. I will for sure get this beer again."
""
""
""
""
"O-I really enjoyed this. If I were looking for a sour that I could drink easily without overpowering everything else on my palate, but something that is still concentrated/interesting enough to be worth drinking, I would go here."
""
"Drinkability – A great sour beer because it's not overly sour."

"O-outstanding brew for the style and $8 will not be beat,this is in a top tier rung for the style"

"O: classic!"

""
""
""
""
""

"An exceptional beer and one that I could drink all night, the flavours and aromas had great balance and all seemed to work well together for the better of the beer. At first I thought the sourness would prove to much for me but it settled down a little with great depth."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - currently my favorite sour as of this review. Very solid brew."
"O/D - A nice Flemmish Red. Lot's of easy flavour with complexity while being easy to drink. A good one."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. There is a light effervescence and it is overall very easy drinking with low alcohol impact. I really enjoy how well blended and flavorful this beer is without being face crushing/puckering sour. It has just a bit more tartness and is overall more dry than the base. Nicely done and even more enjoyable than the rodenbach red."
"A pretty good sour beer. Not anywhere as good as Russian River’s Supplication that I had recently, but good overall. My slight cold may have hurt or helped this rating as well."
""
"Rich ruby red edges and a small tab head that rings the glass and leaves some nice gobs of lacing that slide back down into the glass. Nice nose of rich sweet malts a hint of acetic acid and some nice cherry pie notes. Tons of cherry pie in the body with a syrupy malt sweetness that delivers some soy sauce. Much more malt than I had expected though and it distracts from the light sourness in the body. Very nice beer, that finishes well."
"Overall – While not really my favorite beer style, this is a nice and sour Flemish with a good flavor profile. It is classic for a reason."
""
"O: A wonderful beer! Wild yet tame. Drinkable and enjoyable."
""
"Pours a clear reddish color with brown tints around the edges. There is a one finger tan head which gives way to edging. The aroma starts out with a sweet bready and cherry aroma before a big inviting vinegar smelll takes over and dominates. The taste follows suit with a sweet cherry and tart dark fruit flavor starting and then a sour vinegar flavor. Well blended. The mouthfeel is smooth and stingy. Overall this is a fantastic beer a must try."
""
"O - Perfectly balanced and drinkable. Exemplifies the style. Can be enjoyed by people new to sours and is a classic to those who love them. A perfect beer to serve to wine lovers to try to convert them."
""
""
"O: Refreshing but boring. I doubt I'll ever have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights under the light. There's a 1 finger head and lasting lace. The aroma is of dark fruit, a yeasty mustiness, and wood. The flavor has dark cherry, plum, and vinegar notes with a hint of wild yeast. It's mouthfeel is medium with a mild lasting warmth. Rodenbach Grand Cru is a good beer. Highly recommended."
"M: Low-medium carbonation allow for the full delivery of complex flavor. A very complex and refreshing beer. The slight vinegary character took me a few sips to acclimate to, but this is an awesome beer I will drink anytime I get the chance."
"O: One of the better sour beers that I've had. The sourness is quite powerful and it adds to the quality of the beer."
"Definitely at the top of the Flanders Red game. A great beer."
""
"Overall, a very unique beer and quite enjoyable in my opinion. Not something I would drink all the time but is a wonderful treat on occasion."
""
""
"Overall this beer defines the style. Expertly crafted, exactly what it should be."
""
"The mouthfeel is nice and dry. The aggressive tartness makes for a beer that isn't as easy to drink as it could be, but everything is just fine. Overall, this is about as great as you could ever expect a Flanders Red to be. In this day and age of scarce fruit lambics and overhyped American Wild Ales, this beer still exists as an affordable option for that sour fix."
"Overall this an intresting beer because its a sipping thirst quencher. How can that be?"
""
"This is how to do a Flanders. Loads of tartness, sourness, yet subtly sweet and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, great, glad to finally re-visit this beer/brewery, definitely wasn't disappointed. A 750ml might be best to split though. Great price for the style, I surely will be buying more of this in the near future."
"This beer is delicious. It really doesn't taste like any other beer I have had. But it is the only one of it's style I have had. It has a distinct apple cider vinegar taste... sour and tart . But the taste will definitely grow on you. Pours with a nice reddish color and a thick head. Sour, creamy full mouth feel leave you ready to take another slash. I've only seen it in bombers or on tap. Excellent beer for special occasions. Try it, you'll like it!"

"On tap at a wine bar in Findlay Market in Cincy. This was several hours ago, so notes will be vague. Poured an opaque reddish-brown. Very effervescent. Cherries, balsamic, umami flavors. Moderately tart with a dry finish. Much more pronounced oak flavor than I am used to with the Flanderses. Very good."
""
""
"O- I drank this and a Rodenbach Classic from 1984 side by side. They both had similar smells with this having a little bit more raspberries coming out. The Grand Cru definitely tasted a lot better though having a lot more sour fruity presence and wasn't as watery. Overall this beer held up fantastic for having been brewed almost 30 years ago."
"O- great stuff...excellent sour"
"Had on tap at Max's. My first Flanders Red Ale (I think?) so I'm curious to try. Pours a nice ruby red color, nice tart aroma. Taste is a bit sour, with tons of cherry flavor, more balanced and drinkable than I thought it would be. Delicious beer with tons of flavor, finishes nice and clean. Count me in as a fan of this style, would definitely try this one again."
""
""
"O - I thought this was going to be an amazing work of art, but the body brought it down to just a dang good beer. Well balanced and good to look at."
"O: Not a fan of anything sour but glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a ramped-up version of the Classic Red Rodenbach, showing stronger sour and tart fruitiness. Very enjoyable and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a quintessential Belgian sour--and not nearly as sour as I remember it being--but then again I have grown in my love of sours since first sipping RGC"
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): It's easy to understand why Rodenbach Grand Cru is considered a benchmark of the style and one of the great Belgian beers. Grand Cru is the full package: its aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel are all of top quality and remind you of few other beers. It's definitely an odd one, but that makes it even more of a treat to consume; I have yet to taste a better sour ale. Highly recommended."
"Overall: what a tasty and wonderful beer. As noted above, this is probably the archetype for the style."
""
"I really like this style and I think this is an excellent example- medium body, nice tartness, light to medium carbonation. I would recommend it."
""
""
"O - Very good Flanders red. Amazingly fruity. This is one I'd like to keep around often."
"O: Very good"
"It's actually not a bad beer, rather it's pretty good, but it's an acquired taste. While not as sour as a kriek, it's still got a vinegar bite that will chase some away. I couldn't drink a lot of this, but I'm glad I had the bomber I did. Will be a while before I have another, but I'll definitely have one again someday."

""
""
"Overall. Easy drinking, nice medium-light sourness with some great fruit flavours. What's not to like?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Complex mix that presents a multitude of opposing flavour combinations. Interesting brew in how it so closely resembles a red wine. While I'm not a fan of sours generally, I find this brew complex and intriguing."
""
""
"T: like smoking my first cigar; I'm coughing; incredibly flavorful and complex; very sweet and sour; would be ideal as an appetizer"
"This ale carries all of the hallmark characteristics of the style. Woody, mostly cherry tartness. Makes the back of your mouth pucker a little and do funny things. I'm really building this up quite nicely, aren't I? This is closer to the wild tones of a lambic or wild ale, so you better know what you're getting into. Bottom line: this is a grand cru that deserves the title. Gotta love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its evident why its a classic. Perfectly balanced, layers of flavors, and not one of them a bad one. Still doesn't match up to the Cuvee des Jacobins in terms of complexity for me, but its pretty close."
"O: A very solid, approachable and drinkable sour. I hate to compare to Duchesse, but at the same price and availability, it's hard not to. I much prefer this beer, due to the less vinegar and more oak presence."

"O: Contemplative and excellent. I will definitely be looking for more of this. My highest recommendation and my favourite Flemish Red. I am predisposed against this style, so that's really saying something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like this beer, only my second Flemish ale, very nice."
""
"O- A truly unique beer, I really have not had anything like it. The astringent nail polish is a very unique taste, probably not everyone's cup of tea but I liked it. It is a sour and funky beer, I have had beers that are more sour, but this is definitely a sour beer."
"Note: 2/1/2012 date on bottle. Consumed on 2/15/2012."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1 inch fizzy tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of balsalmic and red wine vinegar, funk, and some woody aromas. Taste is of sweet and sour cherries, vinegar, funk, and a dry woody flavor on the finish. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel but with a drying quality in the mouth with each sip. Overall, this is a very good beer that is better than the classic Rodenbach but not as good as the 2008 Vintage I have tried."
"O- Wow. A tart beautiful beer that drinks so easily and reminds me of red wine, but still retains the underlying beer qualities. I'm glad I finally got my hands on this one."
""
"Not a very good looking beer but a really tasty one and a must try if you like sours."
""
"This is a world classic and I'm glad I finally took the time to sit and review it. Fans of sour beers, Lambics, and American Wild Ales should seek this one out if they haven't already. What a perfect way to welcome the coming Spring!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While I haven't had many sours, this is awesome. Some of the others I've had, have just been all pucker and nothing else. This one allows you to taste the malt and some sweetness balancing out the sourness quite well. Will happily recommend this beer to others looking to have a well balanced sour."
""
""
"Overall, this beer's a great price and is easily accessible. It's highly drinkable due to its muted sourness, modest abv, and tingling mouthfeel."
""
""
""

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little above average. Overall it's very good beer and a classic version of the style. It has a very good range of flavors but manages to bring them together very well. Very nice overall."
"O - A very good Belgian. Worth seeking out if you like Duchesse de Bourgogne."
""
""
""
""
"O- very good beer with a lot going on and it all comes together in my mouth so well! Definately getting some more of this."
"O: overall, a delicious beer. Unique finish for a Flanders as well. Would get it again"
"O: Really good beer. I honestly have not had very many sours so it is difficult for me to compare this to other beers of the like, but this is just downright tasty."
"O- I love this beer and maybe I like sours more than I thought I did"
""
""
"O: Rodenbach Classic is great and this one ratchets up the sourness to the next level. I think a little bit of the complexity is lost due to that but this one still has the same flavors with an extra dash of tartness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall great, this is one of the staples for a flemish red style, great tart fruit, sour brown malts, light lactic acid, but smooth and juicy, and still somehow decently drinkable."
""
"O: I love this style and this beer. A wonderfully refreshing sour that is reasonably priced. I will always welcome a chance to enjoy this beer."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a brownish head. Good lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is super tart, with vinegar, cherry, some oak and a very acidic quality. The taste is very similar in profile, but a little more complex. The oak comes out more in the taste, along with other berries. Feel is tart, with a mouth puckering effect. There's also some fruit sweetness, as well as a mellowness on the fringe. Overall, very solid brew, I like it."
""
""
"33cl into Rodenbach tulip. On draft at brewery. Off white head, fluffy, high retention. Much darker than classic, almost black. Aroma more pungent, this time puckering my entire face.  Tongue smacking. Balsamic in nature. An amazing and memorable experience drinking this surrounded by the oak tuns. Wow. "
""
"O- This could definitely be intense for someone who's not used to sour beers but IMO it's one of the better beers in its class. I'm still not a fan of the aroma, but it tastes great."
""
"D - Probably the most drinkable deeply sour beer I've ever had, would be great with a nutty hard cheese."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall the best representation of Flander Red ale i've ever come across... period."
""
""
""
"Enjoyed at SourSunday in Berkeley, CA. When I think of Flanders red ales, this beer comes to mind. It is the epitome of the style. Pours a deep rusty red with a small enjoyable head. You can taste the sour more than you can smell it. Immediately sour, but balanced by it's complexity and yeasty smoothness. The mouth feel is sharp and crisp, but quaffable. The oak also comes into play here and gives the beer a recognizable oak flavor which melds well with the exotic tart and yeast esters."
""
""
"O- really nice sour here and I'm glad that it is so available because it is truly an incredible representation of the style."
"This is a genuine classic Belgian, a must try. I look forward to aging this next time."
"O-I have never had a beer anything like this beer before. Never had a sour of anything along those lines. But this is really good. Drinks more like a wine. I really like this beer. I will be looking for more like this and i highly recommend this one."
""
""
""
"O - Wow, I don't know why I put off trying this classic beer for so long. It's my first Flanders Red Ale and I really enjoyed it. Now I might be able to justify buying the $20 2008 vintage version soon."
""
"Overall this is a tasty beer. A good basic sour that's very drinkable. Not the most complex, funky, or sour of beers, but that's ok too. The sourness is well-incorporated into the beer and it has some definite winelike characteristics. And at $10 a 750 you really can't beat the price for a decent sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- wow, this beer is really tasty, so much flavour. really, really like it."
""
"O: Changed my mind about Flanders Reds. The sour cherry aspect has me thinking this is a nice, nostalgic soda, but the body fills out, and even at only 6%, it feels very very big. It's the kind of beer that makes me never want to see the bottom of my glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: great beer, overall it's pretty good for the price of $9. Can't believe I found it where I live."
"One of the all-time greatest beers in the world, hands down. An incredible drink. Highly reputable."

"Overall: I really like this beer. Excellent complexity of flavor and a great value."
""
"A vibrant dark red with auburn tones. Half an inch of head that fades out into a ring around the glass, but leaves significant lacing throughout. It has a pleasant vinegary smell. Taste-wise, it has a crisp tartness. It's sharp and acidic at first but incredibly well balanced by a slight sweetness of dark fruits and berries. It's light bodied and has the perfect carbonation topped of with a dry finish. I haven't had many sours, but this is definitely one of my favorite beers regardless of the style. Nearly flawless. I hope to have it again very soon, and it's definitely worth the price."
""
"Anyways all around i give this beer 5 stars. Very good beer and everyone should try it once, if not twice."
""
""
""
""
"4.5 D: Really great beer. I'll have to be sure to not overlook this one in the future."
"Rodenbach is my ultimate standby. Always have some ready to serve. It's cheap, readily available, and nearly the best sour available."
""
""
""
""
"O: Mother of God, this beer is unlike anything I've ever tasted. Tart, complex and simply amazing. I feel the need to drink more sours other than fruit lambics after drinking this beer."

"Overall - really enjoyed this, not a lot of room for criticism, just a great sour/Flanders, exemplary red ale"
"Tasting notes? While you're at it, smash the Venus de Milo so you can describe the calcite particles in the marble. This beer is oxidized like a great sherry, tart like a great cherry, bound together by wispy acetic vinegar vapors that, once they're in your sinuses, have something very important to tell you. But you should hear it for yourself, not from me."
""
""
""
"O: This is a personal favorite. Maybe all the lambic I've been drinking lately has messed with my palate, but I feel like this used to be more tart/acidic. Still, all it takes is a tiny sip of this super concentrated brew to fully appreciate all of its flavors. Often overlooked in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - In keeping with styles, this is one of the very best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"World class and the benchmark for the style. Not much more to say, except that I'm so thankful this beer is available to me year-around. Why are some regularly spending $30/bottle on hard-to-find mediocre American sours when this stuff is sitting around for 1/3 of the cost all over the US?"
""
""
""
"D: The best of the style I've had, a real treat. The don't make them like this often."
""
""

"Good, but I'll pass for other sours most of the time."

"Im a new fan of sour beers and im sure this was a major contributor"
"Cracked this one open after Thanksgiving dinner. Looks nice in the glass, but that's where the compliments end. Smell isn't bad necessarily, just lopsidedly sour with nothing else to balance. Taste is like drinking balsamic vinegar straight up. Bottle said it's supposed to have a ""sweet-sour"" taste and it absolutely did not. It's also so dry in the mouth that a couple sips totally ruin the palate. Very disappointing."
""
""
"O: Great Flanders. Glad I decided to give this a try. As good as many of the ""rare"" sours."
""
"Poured a dark reddish brown, mocha head with great head retention and some splotchy lace. Nose has sour berries, oak/vanilla/general barrel character. Lots of dried fruits. More tart berry flavours, sweet and sour fruit notes throughout. Oak, vanilla and a touch of brown sugar. More barrel character. Exceptional balance. A phenomenal sour, fantastic feel and flavour."
""
"Brownish red colour, ring of white head with some lace. Smell is tart with lots of funky yeast, fruity, cherry/berry scents, acidic and wine like. Taste is quite tart initially that lasts the entire time, funky, lots of fruit, cherry/berry flavours, yeasty with a tart finish. Medium carbonation, medium body, solid feel. Very drinkable and quite a treat, could have this every couple of weeks without getting tired of it, really good stuff."

"A dark brownish-mahogany color with a big frothy tan head and decent lacing. The aroma is a woodsy sour lemon champagne idea. Light but distinctive. The flavor delivers a maple caramel sweetness under a sharp lemon-lime highlight. There’s a clear sherry booziness and a champagne grapey grain idea as well. The body is medium plus with a very smooth, frothy feel with champagne-like carbonation. As is to be expected, the sour rules the day. Very nice."

"This really impressed me, so much so that ordering a second quickly on the heels of the first was in order. Fabulous beer, a very pleasant surprise. Highly recommended."
"Pours deep, dark cherry to brown in color with thinnish tan head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving nice lacing. Aroma is vinous and fruity with apple, raspberry, cherry and grape notes. A touch of nutty or biscuity malts lurks in the background. The flavor brings out some stale malt with plenty more fruit flavors. A tad sweet but not nearly as much as what the aroma hinted at. Definite sour, earthy overtones, with a kick of moldy barnyard funk almost reminiscent of some strong blue cheeses toward the end. Medium bodied, fairly mouth-puckering feel. Nice and refreshing with just enough complexity and funk to make a lively, interesting beer."
"Grapes and cranberries intertwine with some earthy tannin and oak flavors, with a biting sourness. A great, widely available example of a great Flanders acid ale. Glad this one is popping up again in my area. For the price, it is the definition of a bargain. My only complaint is that it isn't bottle conditioned. I would love to see what some yeast in the bottle may do to this one with time."
"O: A for sure. It's definitely a world class beer. And I love that I can find it whenever I want another...."
"I admit I've only had maybe 15 sours, but this one stands miles above the rest. This is just to die for and I'm going to buy another bottle after work tomorrow. I'm not sure how one can improve upon this other than finding a way to make sours smell better."
"O: Great beer, perhaps unfairly held back in the sub-ratings by others that I've had and enjoyed more. The balance and light mouthfeel mean that this is a beer you can spend the evening with, offering something new with every sip. Furthermore, $10 for a 750ml of a Belgian sour? I can't think of many other Belgians or sours that meet that price tag– I'll be certain to pick this up again, and highly recommend you grab it if you see it."
"This is one of the best Flemish reds I've ever had-- truly worthy of the hype and representative of the style. Mestreechs Ajt Red is another good example if you enjoy this one."
"O: still expanding my horizons on sours, but DAMN this is good! Just the right amount of tartness. Will buy this again and again."
"Cellared almost a year to the date. Flute glass pour and I am met with a nice dark brown colored ale with accompanying brown/beige foaming head that lingers. The smell has nice oak and different dark fruits in the mix. Just a touch of the vinegar in the aroma. Very pleasant. Amazing taste. Sweet and sour are blended perfectly. You get the fruitiness up front followed by a slight acetic dose of sourness on the swallow. Very dry finish and the salivation keeps me coming back for another sip. Carbonation is there but that's to be expected. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Not overly sour or harsh like some sours. Just a great blend as the Rodenbach crew knows exactly what they are doing. Great stuff!"
"T: Incredible stuff. Juicy red delicious apples, plum, vanilla and some dark cherry tartness. Has a great smack of tartness without being overly sour."
"Can’t believe I am just getting around to reviewing this one now; sometimes my notes go missing for months at a time. This is one tasty beer though. Reddish brown, dark cherry soda appearance. Not much head or lacing although the cork popped nicely on the review bottle. Aroma is tantalizingly tart and sweet, with the faintest hint of vinegar in the background. Cherry in there, too. The flavors are the same; the vinegar note, while noticed, is small and muted enough that non sour aficionados can enjoy this one too. Very fruity, mostly cherry but maybe plum/raisin/cranberry as well? Super tart, crisp, clean, refreshing. Excellent carbonation. I had this one at the end of a very very long day of teaching, followed by a memorial service in a sweltering church, then cleaning the house till midnight to prepare for guests. Hit the spot in a big way."
"O: Very very good. I could drink this all the time."
"O: Was on its way to a rave review until the bittering hops started to bug me. Excellent in every way otherwise though, and like I said it may have been a food thing and not really the beer's problem at all."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. If you're a fan of sour beers, this one is definitely worth trying."
"O - Glad to have tried. A good example of the style, and one that is easy to acquire."
"it's been a while since I've had a rodenbach and I was quickly reminded how good it was. A real quality sour that is just as enjoyable"
"O: Really truly I could never have expected to pour such a gem from this bottle. I had kept it in the back of my cellar with the intent of opening it when SundaySour was willing to drink it. She had been on champagne for many months now, but she finally caved in on this night. It was divine intervention, as this bottle was in its absolute prime. This beer is truly a magical blend of flavors. The young beer is vibrant, the old beer is wise, and the barrel is the time in between. After drinking this beer, I felt like I had watched a fine film. My mouth applauds. Truly though, this was exceptional in its balance, with an in check vinegar."
"O: I was surprised by this beer; the elegant bottling made me think this would be a half-hearted game of peekaboo for a sour. But it didn't hold back. I'm so glad that brewers worldwide finally make an acceptable drink for closet vinegar drinkers like myself. Very yummers, a must-try for horrible mean sour people like yours truly."
"D - A refreshing wonderful beer. Glad I got to try it on tap too."
"O: very good and definitely buying more as my girlfriend even enjoyed this! Very smooth and very refreshing."
"I haven't found this as sour as some sources make it sound. This is a good beer and seems perfect for a sort of warm up to the Russian River sours I've got in the fridge. I put put it around Duchesse's level, very good but possibly just below, as a possible introductory red sour ale."
"M: Very nice balance of sweet/tart. Good carbonation and overall a joy to drink."
"O: I am not a big fan of sour beers but i do enjoy this beer, and is always a treat when i want to drink something other than IPA, roasty stouts, or strong ales. A great beer and a textbook example of the flanders red ale"
"Is this the best beer I've had? No, of course not... But does it hit the spot? Absolutely. This is the beer I think of when I think of a Flanders red."
"D: definitely was drinking great and this brew has been one of my favorite flanders stlye brew for awhile. We'll see how this one holds up with a little time."
"I've had it in the bottle and on tap. It was equally enjoyable both times."
"750ml corked and caged bottle served in a Spiegelau tulip. Best before 09/04/13 printed on the base of the bottle. Pours a brownish-plum hue with a murky clarity and a loose half inch, off-white head that immediately disperses into a cluster of bubbles and ringlets around the edges with a residual soapy slick across the surface. Not much in terms of lacing; just a few spots and a thin slash here and there. Great nose - tart cherries, toasted oak and a buttery quality. Taste follows nose with the addition of citric acid a suggestion of cork and a light saltiness. Mouthfeel is medium-light and perfectly carbonated for the style - not too lively, but also not still. Acidity lightly stimulates the salivary glands and leaves a residual presence on the back of the tongue. What can I say that probably already hasn't been said - this beer is an archetype for the style. There are definitely some distinctive variations on the theme out there but this is a great place to start if you are looking to gain an understanding of the style."
"O- This basically epitomizes the Flanders Red style and is a great intro to sour beers. A must-try."
"This beer pours a dark brown with reddish tint, when held up to the light it reveals a vibrant bubbling red. Has a light tan lasting head. The nose is strong of tart cherries, sweet fruits and sourness, a smell that reminds me of a barbershop but not in a bad way, its clean and refreshing. The taste is of red grapes, overly ripe cherries, dark fruits, that are sweet and tart. Mouthfeel is a high carbonation that is refreshing and a lasting tart bite. This is a great beer that I plan on keeping on hand at all times."
"Yep."
"I have to note that I drank this with Thai food, (Prik khing) and it blew my mind. Perhaps the best pairing I have had to date. Get this and eat thai... tomorrow."
"O/D-For $7.99 a 750 ml, this is a pretty good deal. I find it to be a great intro into the style. Tasty and unique, I would recommend this as a beer that is far from the ordinary for a beer gumshoe."
"O: A superbly drinkable beer, beautiful in its details. More elegant and well developed than Duchesse, the only other Flanders Ale I've tried. I'll definitely be getting more of this."
"O: A new and happy experience for me. While I'm all alone in the dark, the aromas and flavours bring a lot of memories and other stuff to my mind - I think I'm going to enjoy more of beers like this in the future."
"O: favorite Flanders red so far"
"Very well made and very drinkable, even for a non lover of this style."
"Pours dark copper/red. Nice compact head which persists. Woody on the nose with floral and fruity notes. Definite vinegar notes as well. The palate is somewhat one dimensional with lots of sour cherry and a whack of vinegar. The vinegar and acidity actually cause a sting in the throat. Everything I believe that I know about beer tells me I should hate this one, but I really like it! Guess I don't know much after all. The final result is a super refreshing and super fruity beer. It almost tastes like a Kriek, and the sourness is definitely Lambic like. Very cool beer."
"O - Great beer, nice and sour with a sweetness in the middle, dry, fruity, oaky, funky. Glad I went just to get this, would love another, and will definitely be seeking this out again."
"Overall - This is a robust, complex and authentic Flemish sour. I can appreciate that it is true too the style and beloved by many. I have tried to keep an open mind when reviewing this beer but have come to the conclusion as some others have said that this is just one you either love or hate. MY GOD IS THIS A FUNKY BEER!!!"
"Overall – I have heard about this beer and have never picked it up until now. From what I can tell, this is about a 2-3 year old bottle. That said, I’m not sure what I was expecting. The red vinegar flavor was a bit too much. I understand the style, but it was just a bit too much for me. May give it another try with a fresher bottle."
"If you like sours, Rodenbach Grand Cru is a very enjoyable beer."
"O: this is everything I expected from reading descriptions of flanders reds and more. This as an amazing beer with some unique notes that I will be searching for in the future."
"Overall: Excellent brew, clean and sharp sourness. fantastic"
"O: I have over the past year and half become a very big fan of sour beers. Rodenbach Grand Cru is delicious. It is a complex mix of sweet and tart, sour fruit combined with earthy and dry biscuit notes. It is a completely different type of taste from many other types of beers and, because of this fact, might not be loved by everyone. Its flavors are much more like a combination of wine and crisp cider than a normal beer. If you are interested in trying a sour beer, Rodenbach Grand Cru is an excellent place to start."
"Great beer. Better than La Folie and much cheaper at $15.00/ growler."
"I used a very gentle pour so as not to stir up any lees that may have been in the bottom of the bottle, resulting in just a little bit of light-tan head that quickly fell to wisps. Color was a gorgeous mahogany with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both wood-like (oak?) and vinegar, causing my mouth to pucker. Mouthfeel was medium and my initial reaction was TART! on the tongue. Once I recovered, I tasted what reminded me of my uncle's sour cherry wine, along with the vinegar/wood combination I had noted on the nose. Each successive sip became more palatable and as it warmed, I really got the oakiness more prevalently. Finish was tart and dry, perfect for this sweltering afternoon in my A/C-less house. I am celebrating just having hung a mesh curtain across the back doorway that is allowing a nice breeze to blow through without giving access to flies and other pests. One Beer Pest in the house is enough!"
"O - What a surprise to have this keg at the party...an excellent addition to the tap line up...my first Flanders Red and I was impressed...probably one of the best out there that I'll have"
"Rodenbach Grand Cru may no longer be the most sour, complex or even most elegant ale on the market, but let's not forget it is precisely because of Rodenbach that we even have these other beers around in the first place. This is still a beer of great beauty and sophistication and, above all, one that is bound to open up some doors for any individual first trying it."
"Mouthfeel is moderately dry, nice and smooth. Overall, this beer is excellent."
"O: Nice sour Flanders red."
"O - Wow. Looked past this one so much. I definitely must go buy more to cellar for a good while."
"Overall: This is just an exceptional beer. Smooth, with a complexity that may come from the blending of the barrels or from the yeast strains, but I would recommend always having this one available. Right now this is the front runner for my favorite Flanders Red."
"O: A sipper of a sour; good tartness with a bit of funk."
"Out of all the sours I've had, this one has one of the most well-integrated sour characters I've ever come across. Ya it's a bit like those warheads candies, but it's tucked in such an incredible silky richness. The flavors are varied and complex and the delivery is impeccable. And for a sour, there's none of those rank, barnyardy tones either which would make this, I think, a good first sour for someone who needs their sour cherry popped."
"Benchmark."
"O- This beer surprised me, I heard fairly good feedback on this one, although I was expecting it to be a little more sour, the surprising sweetness was enjoyable, really easy drinkability, would definitely drink again."
"O: Awesome Flanders Red, one of my favorites yet. Really drinkable and delicious with great fruit notes and tartness."
"A well balanced, tart, sweet sour. Incredible!"
"Overall: I will never understand why people continue to seek out the rarer, younger ""sexy"" sours out there when they have utter perfection at their fingertips with the Rodenbach Grand Cru. Trust me, once you've had this on-tap, you will never go back. For me, this one will always be that first crush that you never really truly get over. Absolutely delectable."
"O--This is a great beer. It was my first sour and I'm pretty sure I started with a great one."
"O: This is a well made, easy drink and vibrant brew. Well worth a try."
"O: My palate was not ready for this style, so I will definitely mark this as one to have to re-review, but I think sour beers could become something I like."
"Overall- This is not my favorite style of beer, but I found this to be exceptional. Not too sour, but also not god awfully sweet and juicy like a lot of these flemish reds. Real easy and pleasant drinking, highly recommended."
"Not the most beautiful beer on the planet, but it carries a nice balance of sour notes in the nose. Cherries especially come through, with a slight note of under-ripe plum or blueberry. Same notes come through in the flavor, but with an added malt sweetness and even some slight vanilla. Smooth beer with nonaggressive carbonation."
"Overall: This is seriously and all day, all year beer. I'm loving it on this warm summer night, but would never complain about having to drink it in the middle of winter. With an ABV clocking in at only 6%, it wouldn't beer hard to drink all night long. I'm glad to have come across this beer and if I ever see it again, I will be buying the store out."
"2nd in 1st day of Summer tasting w/ Vistica. Bottle from O'Shea Brewing in Laguna Niguel. Pours dark amber with a tight white head. Flavor is tart raison/plum and fig. Beautiful balance between sweet & sour leaning towards sour. Medium carbonation with smooth little bubbles. Finishes with the same balance."
"Drink it up. What a brew."
"I could drink this all day. This is pure magic in a bottle, and much tastier than the classic. Complete total beer enjoyment."
"M: It is nice, as the main mouth-feel is sour the bitterness and the sweetness are set aside but at some point the beer-like sensations is present with a medium lasting ending not to easy to process. Good but rare beer feeling."
"Overall – I've only had a handful of flanders red ales before, but this was by far the best one I've encountered. The taste is complex but too over the top. It's got a lot of flavour punch but it's still quite drinkable. I'd buy this beer again."
"O: A great beer, fits style pretty much spot on. Great flavor profile and mouthfeel. Look forward to picking this up when I get back to the states."
"O- Enjoyed this a lot. Nice blend of sweet dark fruits and tart cherries/rasberries. Would definitely get again."
"I had a rather poor experience with this beer before. I happened to have gotten a past dated bottle and it was not pretty. Im glad that it was only a single time incident and not a consistent problem. I am much more impressed this time so here's to ya, cheers."
"Poured into a tulip glass, an opaque reddish brown with a small, beige head that receded to a thin film. Aroma of sour cherries, and vinegar. Very kriek-like in the taste, with sweet, light sugar up front, followed almost immediately by tart cherries. Light spice, yeast, and maybe a touch of grapes finish things off smooth, but a little bitter. Medium mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable. My sister-in-law doesn't like beer, but she liked this one a lot."
"Drinkability really depends on your enjoyment of sours. It's hugely sour, to the point that I though it damaged the overall complexity of the beer."
"Dr: Too sour to drink repeatedly, but overall a good beer, and an affordable one in Belgium."
"750 ml bottle. Pours brown hue with a small, short lived, tanned head and some lacing. Nose is of spoiled apple juice, vinegar and some yeast and malt. Medium, very sharp, acidic body. Taste is sweet and sour barn yard which requires getting used to."
"D-Very easy drinking but I was definitely hoping for more tart, acetic, vinegar notes."
"overall just what i needed and really set me back where i needed to be"
"O: fantastic flanders red/oud bruin. tons of layered and complex flavors. a sipper for all weather and seemingly appropriate for all occasions. This could replace Sunday morning mimosas, after dinner aperitifs, and even fireside scotches. Well perhaps not that last one. Still, Not much I could suggest to improve this one. 5.0"
"This is an amazing beer and an amazing value to boot earning a permanent spot in my cellar."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light overall as it does not taste ""heavy"" at all. It finishes crisply with no notice of the alcohol. A superb brew. Highly recommend this one."
"I really appreciate my improved understanding for this beer. I recommend this as a good example of a sour."
"Narrative: She sat there day after day, painting landscapes in the Garden at Giverny. Her flowing red gown seemed ill at east in the summer breeze, yet inviting. Each day you would feign the pretence to visit the shores of the recending lakeline, prod about in the muck while wondering what the glowing red countenance had to offer. The air was redolent with bluebell that fateful day you crushed the poppy flowers and closed the distance. So sweet in demeanour you introduced yourself, and were treated to a laundry list of compound curse words that would make a Press Gang blush. So sweet in appearances and introduction, you could take your new baroness anywhere, to the Salons, to the racetrack, to Tinpenny alley to bet on cockfights. She was your patient, yet offensive muse. She likened your grandmother's face to pachyderm ankles, but you dont care, you love the sweet and the sour that she presents."
"I'm conflicted on this one--I respect the crafting of this beer--the two year process, the blending and the funky yeasts...but the taste is a little out there for me. That said, I feel like a phillistine for underrating a legend."
"Very refreshing. Taste of sour cherries and sweet dark fruit. Not overly sour. Vinegar not as pronounced as nose suggests. Dry finish with some bready malts. Taste improves through the bottle. Very drinkable."
"Nicely drinking for a sour. Well done and decently priced for the category. This is a good intro/evolving into sours beer. Not too sour, but plenty there to showcase the style."
"Pours a reddish brown in color, off white head forms and crackles away. Aroma of balsamic vinegar, very tart fruit, some sweetness. In the flavor profile, a nice pronounced sour. Acidic and alittle lemony, sour, lip puckering goodness. Alittle oak influence with some woodsy tannins showing late. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated and slightly dry. Overall, a sophisticated sipper, nice sour, worth revisiting."
"Solid, refreshing, interesting, and good with cheese."
"This is more sour than I was expecting, and in a pretty unique way. Glad I tried it, and I'd have it again, but it's different from what I was expecting. The acetic component is sharp and different from the usual aspects I pick up on in sour beers."
"O- i really loved the flavor of this beer. im kicking myself for not picking it up earlier. something ill definitely try again and soon."
"This was a good enough beer, I guess I just thought it was going to be excellent, and it was merely a good beer. No alcohol noticeable, which is nice. $10 a bottle, just kind of meh to it. One bottle left, may update the review if it is materially different, I kind of hope so."
"O - ABV is kind of low but overall very enjoyable ale that I would highly recommend it."
"I would love to recommend this beer. I would take this beer to show someone the great spectrum that the beer world consist of."
"Overall: Very enjoyable beer. Especially for the money. $8 for the 750 is far and away the best deal I have seen for a sour style. I will make this a regular in my fridge to hit my sour fix especially when on a tight budget. This beer is a great value and I would highly recommend it for those looking to introduce themselves or others to the style."
"Glad I picked one up. I was told that this was the true embodiment of the style, and I can't say that I disagree. I'll have to throw it into one of my tastings for sure."
"Mouth feel is smooth, smooth, smooth. Contains some corn, so that may account for some of the softness. Also, obviously, the aging mellows things some."
"Drink- Very nice beer. The sours/wild ales are starting to really become a fixture in my rotation. This was sweet/sour and well done. Not overtly wild but well done."
"A unique beer a totally different taste"
"D - Very drinkable. Fairly bold flavors, but still very nice and smooth. The sourness is rally nice and strong, without being too much."
"It's my 2nd foray into the style, after Duchesse de Bourgogne. pretty similar in taste and quality. overall a very good, and interesting beer."
"M/D: A medium amount of carbonation that balance out the beer. Very refreshing, a clean and dry finish, which makes this beer highly drinkable."
"Overall: This beer is very smooth and good. I love the sweet and sour notes together. Overall I like this beer and would definitely have it again."
"O) An excellent example of this category"
"Taste is sweet and super tart. Some earthy malty flavor as well. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall quite good."
"(D)- A great flanders. Smooth and mellow, yet has a great sourness, fruit, and dry oak."
"Mouthfeel is nice - light, a bit sticky, decent carbonation."
"750ml bottle purchased at McKinnon's. Pours a murky copper-brown body with a thin film of khaki colored head. Acidity permeates the aroma with notes of dried fruit, bread, chocolate, and caramel. Sourness encompasses the flavor as well - a profound tasty pleasant sourness - but noes of apple skins and flesh, bread, and caramel are also present. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Each sip invites another. Having only tried a handful of this style, I'm having trouble wrapping my head (and tongue and nose) around the complexity of this brew, but it is certainly far and away one of the best sour beers I've had."
"m/d - Body was on the thin side. Served in a snifter, at 6% this was drinkable. My second sour, enjoyed it more than the other, I think the low ABV made it tolerable."
"Interesting, a must try if you have not had one."
"D: While this is refreshing and pretty tasty, it's too sour to be a real easy drinker. I definitely need to take my time."
"O - This beer is good, but I kept on wanting something more from it. Maybe 'cause it's relatively low in alcohol content and so fruit-centric, I just didn't really yearn for each sip. I'm glad I had it, and it was tasty, but this is not one for the ""absolutely seek out", IMO."
"So this is the first time I've had this style of beer. Words such as ""sour"" usually send me packing. That said, I really enjoyed this beer. Nice Hazy brown, a little red, with a tan head the quickly recedes. Taste has some nice tart fruitiness to it, I get the apples more than the cherry that others have noticed, and thats fine. My palate isn't as ""refined", one day though. Anyway, this wont be a regular staple for me but I'll certainly pick it up again, and look forward to trying others of the style."
"A nice full bodied Flanders Red that I'm surprised took me this long to try cause i've had it's sister beer many times before."
"I'm not as enraptured with this one as others I've talked to, but hey tastes are different right?"
"Drinkability is out of this world. I wish I had more than just one of these bottles available right now, because this is a beer I would love to drink more of. Gets better with every sip. A tremendous beer."
"Pours a mostly clear red-tinted dark brown with two finger dense khaki colored head, settles to a thin cap leaving big splotches of lace. Smell: sweet black plum beneath a blast of tart fruit, apple vinegar, and a touch of pipe tobacco. Taste: red plum, reduced/sweetened apple vinegar / granny smith apple, a little tart tropical fruit. Mouthfeel: ultra smooth and creamy with a drying soft and tart tropical fruit finish. Quite good."
"Drinkability: Oddly refreshing with great complexity. My Flemish Red/Brown experience is rather limited (only had about 4), but this is my favorite among what I have had."
"Overall- I will be drinking this again. You could almost call this beer refreshing. The price point bumps the drinkability even higher for me."
"Drinkability: Would be higher if it weren't so sour. Would be an amazing summer refresher, but as I'm drinking it early February it's a rare treat."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thin brownish white head and a ton of lacing. Smells of tart cherries and of Belgian yeast. Tastes of tart cherries, brett sourness, and Belgian spices and yeast. Mouthfeel is medium and it has a mild but pleasant carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"D- Must adjust taste buds, but once acquainted its a very enjoyable unique experience. It grows on you."
"D: This is a nice Flanders Red. I enjoy it because it is considerably less sweet than Duchess. I'm not huge on Flanders Reds, but this is one of the better ones out there. I'm happy to see it back in the states!"
"Notes - I love reds, sours, lambics etc so this beer ranks up there with me. A must try if you enjoy any of those types. Rodenbach original is a common beer in my usual arsenal but the Grand Cru returns now and again for a special treat."
"Deep copper pour with a large frothy off-white head. Sour brett aroma with notes of apple, pear, cherry, sweet dark fruit and oak. Strong sour cherry flavor that makes you pucker on the first sip and finishes with a deep earthy oak flavor. Nice medium body with a very gentle carbonation and dry finish."
"O - solid flemish red/brown, great complexity, superb balance, although slightly on the acidic-side."
"Light to medium bodied, above average carbonation. Finishes somewhat dry and tart. The mouthfeel is luxurious, and could not be better. This is an excellent Flanders Red Ale. I recommend it highly."
"There's just a wildness and a big snap of sour that just impacts the mouth more than most sour beers I've had (notable exception being Cantillon Kriek Lambic, hi to all the folks at Cantillon). Not bad, but just really couldn't handle very much of this."
"From the 750 ml. corked bottle. Sampled on January 7, 2011. It pours opaque bown from the heavy duty bottle with ruby hues and an inch thick silky beige head that fizzles down to nothing quickly. The aroma reeks of bourbon and wine with a cherry or grape maltiness evident. The body is smooth. The taste is very tart like grapefruit or cherry. After it settles it reminds me more of wine than beer but nowhere near as dry."
"D - Very nice, but quite sweet. Strong carbonation makes it a bit of a handful but would still be quite easy to drink... just would've preferred a little bit more beer flavour here."
"DB- Really like the acetic flavor with the yeast finish. Really like this style so far."
"D: A terrific example of the style, I definitely recommend this beer."
"Drinkability is quite high. One of the classic examples of the style, indeed."
"Improvement could be slightly made in the lacing and head retention, only if, this would be the first beer that I would rate as a perfect 5. This is a must try for everyone!"
"D - A very drinkable beer. I would not recommend this as a session, although the abv is fairly modest. A very good beer, i could see this going well cheese."
"D: High. World class beer for sure"
"drinkability - very drinkable, almost like a juice. especially for the price. will buy again"
"D - If you like Flanders-style beers, this is a great treat. I can enjoy a bottle myself though it's better to split as the tart and sour qualities become redundant after a while."
"D - So easy to drink - thin to medium mouthfeel with just right carbonation makes this go down easy. The somewhat lingering sweetness is cut by the high carbonation. I found myself drinking this one quickly."
"Drinkability: A great sour beer that will satisfy a craving for funk without being overpoweringly sour. Complex, without being something that requires too much though. A thoroughly enjoyable brew."
"The nose is sweet, with earthy/mushroomy elements interwoven. Auburn brown color; frothy head. This has a similar sour/sweet balance as the Duchesse, although this is a bit more sour. Whereas the Duchesse is sweet on the finish, this is more tannic/cement-like and spearminty on the finish; a bit fruity; slight sweet balsamic note. This is a blend of 67% old ale (2 yrs) and 23% young ale matured in oak casks. I prefer this over the Duchesse as well as the regular Rodenbach bottling. This might be my favorite Flanders Red that I've tried."
"This is a delicious and funky beer. Nice mild sour taste with a warm, smooth aftertaste. This went really well with the house salad, which I highly recommend. Because of the tartness, unless you love sours this a bottle to share, especially considering its rarity in most U.S. markets."
"I have come to the realization that there is a particular brand of sours that I don't care for. It is these dense, super fruity, acidic and sediment ridden ones. I'll keep revisiting the style though as I know Rodenbach is a staple."
"Always happy to drink this. Classic stuff."
"Very good beer. I'd love to age a bottle of this and see if it dries out."
"Sour grapes, vinegar, lemon peel. Lots of flavor. This one lingers for quite a while. It sticks with you."
"D: Flavorful, goes down easily, good representation of style, it's a decent beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for a sour beer."
"I have a few more Flemish reds to try but I think at the end I'll have to do a blind tasting between this and the Duchesse de Bourgogne to see which is king (queen?) of the reds."
"Overall - I'm not as impressed as most are, perhaps i'm too new to the style."
"D - No complaits here - this one lives up to its reputation, and goes on my list to have again. Held up well to food also."
"Drinkability: The sourness prevents this from being a chugger, but why would you want it to be?"
"D - Got a bit intense toward the end of the glass, so one should be good for me. Also, I need to pop a TUMS. Worth it though."
"Verdict: Fantastic but expensive ale that is a must find."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and surprisingly good, considering I described it as tasting like vinegar and raisins. I really like this beer!"
"D - Yeah, wow. Such a potent Flanders. Throw in that great high, crisp carbonation and the tartness and this is one really, really exceptional brew. The two play off one another so well, and each tart refreshing sip leaves me craving yet another."
"A good intro to the stranger side of Belgian beers."
"Light bodied and nicely carbonated. Not too much of an aftertaste from the sourness."
"Pours like coca cola from a 12 oz. bottle with a quickly dissipating beige head with lively bubbles. A light sourness followed by a huge vinegar kick dominates the aroma and flavor, and to me, nothing could overcome that vinegar phenomena. Kind of tough to get through the whole bottle, to be honest. Not great at all; no cherry, oak, or other expression making it complex or noteworthy beyond the slightly unpleasant vinegar character. I've had good beers of this style and though according to many it's a benchmark, it's not enjoyable to me in the least."
"Crisp mouth feel, leaving your mouth in wanting. Definitely an experience best enjoyed slowly to bring out all the flavors. At 6%, the ABV does not come into play in a heavy sense, meaning you can enjoy this one solo or with a close group of friends."
"Very good -- not my favorite for the style, not the most complex I've encountered, but still pretty awesome. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but one or two is enough for this rich brew."
"Overall, this is a great beer for anyone who likes the various styles of sours. Drinkability is good for a sour, but I would hardly consider any sour beer to be highly drinkable."
"A nice dark browinsh red. Whiffs of cherry and sour patch kids. A great first sip, tart, crisp, a great kick to the taste buds. Nots of cherry, oak, which ends in a great balsamic vinegar sweetness. What a great brew!! Gets more complex with every sip. Sour is a bad term for this beer. Its more a great tartness with hints of fruit. And stil you get that hint of vinegar at the end. Can drink lots of these!!"
"Decided to try this out based on the reviews I saw on this site. To be honest, this was the first time I've tried a well-rated beer (based on this site's ratings) that I absolutely hated. I'm sure it's a great choice for some people, but both the smell and taste of this beer reminded me of a very sweet and sour vinegar. After trying it out and being suprised by its taste, I asked a friend to try it out and he totally agreed with me."
"- This is a world class beverage, and one to be respected. The flavors of all worlds of sours and aged beers are right here in one bottle. Very well worth the purchase, and one I will most certainly buy again."
"A rapidly descending head loses marks and somewhat detracts from the experience, but as a world class ""food beer"" there is little one can say that detracts from the greatness that is Rodenbach. Compared to where some are taking the style this might be considered a rather simple offering, but like I said before, if you've got brie and bread what better pair is there? This beer is to wine what wine is to Capri Sun. Sold."
"Terrific and very easy to drink. Nearly did a cartwheel when I saw this for sale (and not over the top either -- $11.). Great great beer."
"D - This is a very enjoyable sour beer with its great flavor this is one that I'm not going to have a problem finishing the bottle worth hunting down to try"
"Refreshing mouthfeel."
"Beer is mildly sweet and acetic biting sour on the backend. It leaves the mouth with an apple flavor, sour apple. Beer is light in body and goes down smooth with minimal carbonation on the palate. Its good, drinkable, less sour than I remember / was expecting but still not for amateurs. Enjoyable."
"not for everyone, but for me, it drinks wonderfully. the interplay between, tart, sweet, sour, acidic, and vinegar flavors with a tingly mouthfeel just works for me. Not many 6%abv beers would be worth $10+, but this one is. maybe an introductory into the sours, but you could do worse as a starting point."
"Pours a dark crimson with an off-white head. Good deal of lacing as it goes down. Smell is vinegar and lactic acid with some dark fruits, cherries, and currants. Taste is quite similar, with the acetic acid coming through. Also a sort of cream-soda-type taste. Mouthfeel is very nice between the sourness and the creamy body. Good drinkability. Not the best Flanders Red, but up there, especially considering its availability."
"D -- Buy it, drink it, be amazed."
"Pours a very dark, murky brown with beautiful dark red glow when held to light. Medium off-white, almost hazel colored head. Scent is lots of vinegar, cherries, and sweet fruits. I also get slight oak scents with some great funk. The taste is very interesting. Upon first sip, the sweetness comes first, followed by a cherry tartness. The vinegar taste is present but not overwhelming. Not as sour as I was inspecting. The oak and wood flavors follow through in the aftertaste along with hints of vanilla. The mouthfeel is like nothing I've tasted before...kinda an awkward feel. Very airy and somewhat ""fluffy."" Not necessarily bad, but just very different and weird feeling. The drinkability is somewhat high as long as this mouthfeel becomes more inviting."
"I like this one alot more then the Duchesse I recently had. I would drink again for sure if I was able to find the smaller bottles."
"D-this is a world class brew, it has a fantastic nose and great flavor profile. it has a very nice balance of sour and acidity to the sweet ripe fruit flavors. well done!"
"D - Wonderfully complex and simple at the same time. Very easy to drink for a sour."
"D - Spectacular, this brew is a major winner in the sour/tart category. I love it and could put this bottle down myself. So enjoyable!"
"Drinkability, easy drinking sour Belgian at 6% abv? yes please!"
"Loads of carbonation. Medium body with a dry finish. Pretty refreshing overall. Each sip demands another."
"D: Very refreshing and easy drinking."
"Bottle. Pours a really nice red/brown color with a surprisingly nice frothy head. The aroma is sourness followed by fruit and oak. The taste does not disappoint! The initial taste is of tart and sour fruit flavors followed by a a mild vinegar taste. Acidic. Light /medium mouthfeel. An excellent example of a Flanders Red Ale. Re-Rate: Having tasted this next to Amorosa, Temptation, and Consecration, I have since re-rated this beer to be below those. Grand Cru is very good and easily accessible but it is a little sweet."
"D-a delicious beer that is amazingly complex and vcan easily be enjoyed all night"
" The price was more than reasonable considering it's near Consecration in taste and quality, but costs half as much."
"d - A decent flanders with some decent sour fruits. Would try again."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite refreshing because the sourness is not overpowering."
"Mouthfeel is right on the mark with a blast of carbonation, and a wonderfully light body. Think sparkling red wine but brighter flavors. A 750ml easily polished off."
"almost opaque ruby brown color with spare off white head, spare lacing, and average carbonation. strong balsamic vinegar like smell that followed through in the taste but wasn't nearly as potent. very sweet sour and tart with some fruity like hints. the blend of the sweet and sour was almost perfect. light body and a thin slick texture. long flavor duration with a very tart finish. very different and unusual flavors that were very pleasing. definitely worth a try."
"Overall, I love this beer and drink it FREQUENTLY. Great with dinner. A nice steak or delicious pot roast. If it wouldn't be such a waste of good (and expensive) beer, I'd love to cover a good roast in this and slow cook it for 8 or 10 hours...mmm"
"Drinkability: Not terribly high for me, despite its excellent taste and reasonable ABV. Two would easily do it and send me on my way to something else."
"Corked and caged bottle poured into a chalice. Nice reddish brown and very murky appearance with a large bubbly light-tan head which fades slowly. Nose is lemon and citrus zest with oak and sour cherries. Some vinegar in there too. Taste is really nice with a mild sour/tart combined with a sweet and deep tannin bite. Noticed a cherry and red grape skin combo with a crisp oak finish. Prickly carbonation makes this really drinkable. Overall, a great ""sweet-tart"" sour blend. A favorite for sure."
"M&D- Wonderful carbonation that makes it so easy to drink. Very smooth in your mouth and all the way down, I would gladly drink this all day. . . unless too many gave me a sore stomach, I guess I will have to find out."
"D: It won't be much to drink a whole 750 of this, however I think a little bit more sour would really make this beer top notch. Nice beer, glad to try it."
"Had this on tap in a goblet at Pepperland. The appearance is a dark mahogany with a hint of red. A centimeter of off white head sits on top with very thing lacing. At first whiff all I got was a nose full of red wine vinegar. It really reminded me of a fresh garden salad with a vinaigrette on top. At my second go towards a smell tart cherries and raspberries penetrate through a big vinegar nose. The fruit is very welcome company to this one. The taste seems a little more balanced. Nice and sour with a forefront of tart cherries followed by a vinegary aftertaste. Oak notes underlie fruit and sourness. The finish is rather a little sweet, making this a very ranged beer on the pallet. Nice to drink and it went very well with my corn chowder. I thought the carbonation was a little much but overall, this one drank nicely."
"d: excellent. I could drink A LOT of this."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a very well done Flanders. Nice sourness. Sweetness cuts down on the drinkability a bit, but otherwise very enjoyable. Had a good time splitting this with three others. Great to sip with blue cheese. Looks like I should check out the Alexander Rodenbach if it crosses my path in the future."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but would be better with less sugary sweetness. I would imaging some age could do this beer well."
"Excellent brew. I will have to try this once more, fresh, to see if the taming of the colors is what led me to this pass."
"D - This beer was fantastic. Even though some of the characteristics reminded me of a vinegar this was a delicious beer. Two glasses worth was enough for one sitting."
"Shares many of the same characteristics as the on-tap version I had at Le Trappe SFO last month, would reinforce lack of head, resulting in thin layer of carbonation on top of garnet red body, minimal effervescence in mouthfeel. On the positive side, a very complex taste, cherry-line esters, certainly a lot of oak character, and a refreshing sweet and sour tart finish. While I wouldn't hop to drink an entire bottle by myself, my buddy certainly enjoyed his first Rodenbach beer. Not sure if this would have benefited from any more cellaring, but this was certainly a worthy brew to enjoy on my birthday. World class."
"D: Like many of the other sour style beers, this one is difficult to drink a lot of because it is so flavorful. The tartness starts to get to me after about 12 oz. It is still very delicious and at 6% alcohol, I could drink a lot before feeling the effects."
"A suprising change of pace."
"Overall, a very sweet tasting sour. Decent drinkability but too sweet for me and I just can't stress this enough. I enjoyed it, but one glass was enough for me."
"D - Incredible. I wouldn't mind 3 or 4 more please. 5.0"
"Overall - Good stuff. I've had people tell me that this is their favorite beer in the world, and I can at times see flashes of why that is. It's not mine, though."
"Notes: The personal reference, and more and more as I share it with people close to Spain, is that of some natural ciders form the North of the country. It is not the same at all, but the memories of fermented apples in a complex fruity range are there. The finish and depth has nothing to with them in the end, with a broader woody and yeasty range. Prepare people for a sour, and this works great too as a socially stimulating drink."
"D- Rating drinkability to this style is almost an oxymoron, and while this would be very difficult to session, its a great drink for the right time."
"While it's been a while since I've tried the original, I believe this is sweeter and more nuanced than the standard Rodenbach. Well worth seeking out if you enjoy the style as this is among the very best I've tried."
"EDIT: For about 2 hours after finishing this beer I craved nothing but cilantro."
"Served from a 12 oz. bottle, poured into a snifter. The color could be aptly described as red, but there was brunette rivaling for for dominance in the color-scape. The head was a beautifully fluffy, candy coating that was enduring. The smell was deep and fruity, evoking plum and a hint of grape. Sour and sweet, there is sharp acidity, there is sugar, a dose of oak, a depth of fruit character akin to plum, raisin, and a splash of cherry. It is sour and it coats, almost like a good vinaigrette. This beer has as much charcter as can be fit into a bottle. Complex, earthy and lasting."
"Drinkability: An all-around admirable brew that's surprisingly refreshing. As my astonished roommate said of it, ""How dey do dat??"" Some things are best left unsaid, man."
"D - Perfect for a warm summer evening."
"Very refreshing, not too tart. Great with food or alone. Now I know why this is the benchmark for the style."
"D - I was expecting one very sour beer and I was not let down. Easily the most sour beer I've had and also very complex. This is an amazing beer."
"Drinkability: For me this is excellent though those not enamored with sour beers may find it a chore. I've held onto this bottle for a couple of years and it may have mellowed slightly. I will have to pick up another this week."
"D-Very easy, but this beer begs for the slow appreciative approach."
"My score would be even higher, if it were not for newer, harder to find offerings that I have not yet reviewed. Rodenbach Grand Cru is a world class beer and I could see upping these scores once I figure out a way to round up a tasting of Flanders-style sours."
"Pours a reddish brown with very little head at all. There is a very noticable amount of sediment down at the bottomm of my glass. The aroma is slightly fruity and extremely vinegar-like. The taste is sour and refreshing with an intense vinegar characteristic. This was my first ever sour almost two years ago, and after that time I finally bought another bottle to reconsider. This is an amazingly drinkable sour and a great way to introduce a non-sour drinker to the wonderful world of sours."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is very smooth and only a slight sour bite. Very drinkable and something that I will certainly have again."
"While I enjoy these sour Belgian red beers, this one is definitely strong in the vinegar department. It might take more adjustment for some than other similar beers. For those unfamiliar with this style, be prepared to share it with a friend (as I've only seen 750 mL bottles), or grab a smaller bottle of Duchesse De Bourgogne."
"D - Feels pretty darn good, but leaves the mouth a bit dry, that's my only compaint."
"Mostly tart cherry in flavor and with a firm bite of carbonation that tingles the palate. A bit of smoke and wood appear briefly then a moderate fruit sense returns. Just a bit rich in viscosity through the finish to truly grab my attention. Carbonation holds up well over an hour yet drink is kept in check as the tartness numbs the palate somewhat, though paired with food this would surely not be a concern.."
"Tasted from a 750mL bottle. Pours dark amber with a thin white head. Nose of red wine vinegar, vanilla, sour cherry, and grenadine pomegranate sweetness. The first flavor is of vanilla and cinnamon oak, sour cherry, and somewhat sweet on the back displaying the pomegranate. The body and carbonation are both medium with a long sour finish. Overall, this is the best Flemish style beer I have had. It is super balanced and really showcases the perfect use of oak in this style of beer."
"At Toronado, pours slight haze dark amber red. Nose of ripe red apple, caramel and citrus. Flavors are ripe and mellow with a fine acidic backbone. Tart cherry, apple sauce and balsamic vinegar on finish, a funky character lingers until closing time. Complex and rustic, feels aged and at prime. Nice smooth and sophisticated."
"overall: exceptional brew with a lot of history behind it. I was expecting this to be good but this blew me away fantastic brew"
"Soft and smooth, it's not a flashy beer, but it does encourage you to drink more and drink it quickly. This has to be my favorite example of this style."
"Overall this is one of the most well-balanced sours I've ever had - everything is present and in almost perfect proportions. Undoubtedly worth a shot."
"This is an interesting style. I will be trying out other one's when I get the chance and hope to re-visit RGC again in the future when I have developed a better taste for it. Recommended for anyone interested in expanding their horizons."
"M/D - good flavor, smooth in the mouth, not overly puckery, nicely balanced brew"
"D- Not something that you could knock back a few of, but incredibly tasty and complex with each sip. At first I was taken aback a bit since it was my first of the kind, but I'm happy to have tried it and look forward to having it, or something of the like again."
"There's so much going on with this beer! Big vinegar tang up front, followed immidiately by a semi sweet and tart fruit flavor, followed again almost immediately by a massive funk! Big oak and wood flavors throughout. Mouthfeel is medium body, semi complex, high carbonation. This is one interesting beer. I have a feeling this would do well with age as it would most likely mellow out. The vinegar is almost repulsive...but the rest of the beer is outstanding and so inviting. I love it and hate it at the same time! With that said, I'd have to conclude this is definitely a top class beer!"
"Overall, the 2008 just continues the long tradition that Rodenbach Grand Cru has been known for: a refreshingly transcendent experience among Flanders Red Ales."
"The body is medium and carbonation has a bit of a sting. Overall this beer is a style standard, there is no denying that. World class."
"Rusty bike chain, leaky D batteries, fermented cider, and deep inside, a robust Belgian beer. I shall drink it 'til I get it right! It is part of a bounty I captured at my new favorite place on earth. It is the 7th Belgian I've tried and is very distinct in character. At first taste I believed it to be bad. I quickly inspected the bottle cap looking for signs of rust. There were none. I proceeded to google. To my fiscal satisfaction, it's supposed to taste that way. I will inspect every drop."
"So. Will I drink it again? YES! If only to satisfy a small morbid curiosity that I didn't have a ropey bottle or that the rest of the world wasn't barking up the wrong tree."
"D- this brew is so perfectly drinkable. Its sour but balanced so well with the sweetness and oak that I have on more the one occasion had one after the other for hours."
"D - Are you kidding? Ridiculously luxurious."
"Overall, a very fine example of the style, grab a bottle when you see it."
"A legendary beer I was very glad to finally try. Superbly intense nose of sherry, oak, nuts and a port like aroma. On the palate is just as unique with a lot of the same flavours creating a really cool, unique sour beer worth trying. Probably helps to be in the mood for it, but this is awesome."
"Notes-The Flanders Red is a unique style that everyone should try at least once, I did with this beer and I can say I'm glad I did. Now I can't say I liked it so much I'd go out and seek it again, but the experience of trying it at least once was worth the price."
"A- (A for the original formula)"
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Belgian-style goblet. The color is dark red, almost brown, slightly opaque with a fair amount of head. Good amount of lacing left behind. Aroma is almost solely sour apple, or lively tart yeast funk that one comes to associate with Flanders Red Ales. Taste is very balances; the sour notes are there but don't overwhelm other elements of the beer. Mouthfeel is very lively, but just enough to make the beer extremely drinkable. Very good overall, a good representation of what has quickly become my favorite style."
"Tastes pretty damn good. Sour green apple and cherry flavors. The finish keeps going for a good 30 seconds. Yes there is sourness, but it's very well balanced, not overpowering. That pucker up quality really adds to the ale's drinkability which is further enhanced by the moderate carbonation."
"Drinkability: This will end up in my crate again for sure. I can't remember how much it was, but I think the price was pretty reasonable. Around $10 or so I do believe for the 750mL bottle. This has a really nice set of flavors, quite a bit of sourness (not as much as La Folie, but because of how sour La Folie is I think this is slightly more drinkable)."
"When I realized I gave it an A+, I kind of second-guessed myself, but I stand by it. This is a phenomenal Flander's Red. World class IMO."
"Not so much my thing, but *way* complex."
"Notes: Really nice vinous beer. Oak/vanilla flavors, while not strong, are really nice and complimentary of the beer."
"D - The cork was stuck in this beer so it took me a while to open this beer. It was fate telling me not to crack this beer by myself. It's far too tart to drink a bottle by itself. Any more than one glass is going to be a challenge."
"overall a well done red ale."
"D= Pretty good. The smell was a bid turn off at first but the taste mad it better. Nice beer but I dunno if I'm gonna get it again."
"D: Probably the best Flanders Red I have ever tasted. I forgot how good it was. This beer will mellow with age, but I don't think it will get much better than it is now."
"Drinkability: Super tasty and light and refreshing, the perfect beer for a special occasion in the spring or summer time."
"unfortunately, i had bigger expectations for this brew. i really love flemish red ales, but i think this one could do without 2 years of cellaring, because this was very vinegar-y. i would certainly try it again and see if it's better balanced than this time around."
"this is really tart and sour, I couldn't see having more than one glass in one sitting (I have to put the rest of the 750ML for later drinking, I dont think I can drink anymore of this tonite), maybe because this is my first approach to this style of beer. This is good, but would take a little bit more of getting used to. This is certainly a unique style, to me its less a beer and more of a malt beverage."
"A well-balanced sour ale, if that's even a thing, though not quite the sort to knock one over the head, like some of its brethren. Easy to drink, fruity, and a tad funky - good stuff."
"Drinkability: So good, I can't really say any more. A bargain at $9."
"D- A pretty good beer but I think it is a little sweet for me to have more than the bottle. I think this would make for a good dessert beer. Different than most beers out there."
"Pours an attractive reddish brown with whispy khaki colored head, very good retention and lacing. Smell is a tart blend of cherry, currant, wine grapes and lemon backed by a faint kiss of oak and vanilla. Taste is a wonderful blend of sour and tart cherry and currant with touches of wine grapes, balsamic vinegar, sea salt, lemon, earth, vanilla, oak and dried grain. There is a slight pucker upon first sip, but it maintains a quite plesent level throughout the glass. Medium body, great prickly carbonation that lasts throughout the bottle, minimal pucker or sour aftertaste. Not terribly complex in the ingrediant profile that are put into it, but just an amazing beer all around due to the aging and yeasts."
"Cheers!"
"D: Personally, could only drink one. Very interesting."
"One of the finest examples of the Flanders Red Ale/Sour style. Don't miss a chance."
"Rodenbach Gran Cru, what an exceptional beer. Obviously a sour ale, which doesn't appeal to most, but shows me that the Belgian's know there shit when it comes to beer. Pardon my language. You can taste notes of wood, maybe oak, Tart cherries, and vinegar, all giving this beer a sour taste. While not too sweet, this beer is very drinkable, but not yet drinkable by some. This beer is very good, and is a famous addition to any ones beer collection."
"Had this side-by-side with a Rodenbach 2007, a limited-release vintage. BEAUTIFUL"
"D: Pretty good, a solid sour. Tough one to drink all alone though."
"As for drinkability, the best ever. Hands down the standard for Flanders and perhaps all sours in general. Classic business here, thrilled to have had it on tap."
" D- This beer has a nice flavor with notes of old and young beer in good combination. It was a pleasant surprise of malt flavors coming through as the beer warmed."
"The nose is less loaded in balsamic vinegar but it'is more acidic and more aggressive, it also feels aromas of old wine. The taste is certainly a little more acidic than Rodenbach because the flavor of vinegar found it more strongly, coupled with hints of red fruit not yet ripe. The woody notes of oak, perceive themselves more distinctly, and tannins. The finish, in turn, is a bit more sour and there receives the acidity of currants. Always side with the winey and sweet and sour, it is remains rounder and more pleasing than the Rodenbach."
"Drinkability is actually quite drinkable. This is the beer folks wine."
"Drinkability: The thin body and huge complexity would be a wonderful combination leading to a massively drinkable beer, but the super sourness makes it a serious sipper. It was rather enjoyable and a good introduction to sours."
"I enjoyed this beer; wonderful style. Not my favorite for everyday drinking, but it's a definite addition to my repitoire."
"It's very tart, almost lambic like. Strong flavors of cherries and perhaps a little bit of raspberries. Some vinous characteristics that make the beer exceptionally interesting. The sourness is what keeps me away from beers like this. It's good, but I can only stomach a glass of it at a time."
"2007 vintage. Beer pours reddish brown with a small white head. The aroma is a mix of sourness, oak and tart cherries. The flavor is a medium sourness with sour fruit (cherries) and some oak and vanilla. Not as sour as some of the beers I have had, but one of the best overall sours I have tried. Very drinkable."
"Overall: I loved the classic sour, and I love Monk's sour, and now I love this Grand Cru version. It's not for everyone. It's a bit more out there than the classic, but if you like the classic and you're up for a special treat, this is great."
"Good carbonation, nice and smooth body, this has clearly been perfected and I would not hesitate to recommend to anybody that enjoys a good beer. I cannot believe that there is only 6% in this one, completely stunned by this revelation"
"Taste is sweet and sour, tastes like cherries fermenting in oak barrels, a huge step over Duchesse. This isn't the offensive vinegar horseradish tasting harseshit that I have associated with this style, Well done."
"Fantastic beer - the 3 ounces was not enough to apprecitae it fully, but I will be seeking this one out."
"This one is absolutely wonderful and at only 6.0%abv it could be enjoyed on a regular basis. Now, if only I could get it at my local liquor store, instead of having to travel/trade to get it..."
"Did I mention that I love cherries? I know it's not ""made"" with cherries, but the critters in this stuff make it taste like tart dark fruit. Delicious! It's got a light red-brown color going on, and a really lace head. Like some lingerie. Sexay. Sour. Tart. Lip smacking. Tonguing the inside of your mouth for residual flavor. Good."
"This one pulls off an amazing feat: successfully walking a tightrope over undrinkable sourness. Delicious."
"drinkability - i could have this with my dinner everynight"
"D - delicious and interesting. one of the few sours readily available here that dont cost an arm and a leg, and so worth every penny."
"D: As previously mentioned, this beer is pretty much *the* example of a Flanders Red. It's a really solid beer and a great one for wine drinkers like my cousin that I shared the bottle with."
"Overall, a classic example of the style and a beautiful beer. Pick up one of these if you haven't had it before and are open to new tastes."
"Drinkability: I loved this beer. A nice sour end without being too sour. I love the cherry taste and could have several of this beer."
"Overall a great beer. I love the push pull of the sweet and sour fighting for my taste buds attention. Nice and lively. A great after dinner beer."
"D: It's light bodied yet immensely complex. A small sip spreads an grows across the palate, lingering long after."
"I can see why they describe this as a Flemish Red Brown Ale on the bottle. The different elements keep each other in check and produce a very balanced beer. Although sour, its definitely not overpowering by any means. A great and lively mouthfeel, with prickly carbonation keeps things interesting. I'm glad I finally found a place that carries this and I'll be getting more in the future."
"D: Unbalanced compared to other Flander's Reds that I've had. A bit too tart and alcoholic as it warms. Mouthfeel takes away from the blending of the different flavors."
"Alas I did not get to see the freshness date on the bottle. I have the feeling that this beer was a little aged after reading some of the reviews. This is possibly why I feel this beers drinkability and appearance are a little slacking compared to what others have rated. It was just a bit too rough with the vinegary sensation to be supremely quaffable, though twas still quite quenching. My suspicions about the age might also be the reason why this beer had next to no head upon pour which was also a slight downer. Regardless this is a magnificent beer which I'd love to try on tap or at least a fresher bottle."
"D: After the disappointing standard Rodenbach, I found this a much more impressive and enjoyable beer."
"The thing that really impresses me about Rodenbach Grand Cru is that its insanely drinkable in a style that I usually struggle with after the first half of a bottle (see Vichtenaar). I'd be really happy to sit down with a bomber of this and that says something about how well-balanced it is."
"This was an excellent example of the style, everything working in harmony to pucker you up without blasting you away. I wouldn't have ever imagined a Flemish red as overly drinkable but this one changes my mind - I would gladly sit down with a bottle or two of this. Cheers Rob!"
"Overall, this is a hell of an intriguing and very sour brew. It's certainly worth sampling."
"Don't hold your breath waiting for this one to get better."
"World class, without a doubt."
"Much smoother and maltier than the regular Rodenbach, concord grape juice meets a tannic malbec. The sweetness really melds so well with the sour aspect, it is utterly ridiculously drinkable. I could finish a liter of this in less than 10 minutes and enjoy every last drop. Amazing beer, just like it's regular (red) brethren. Muy delicioso!"
"D - unique and refreshing. I'd have one or two of these by themselves, but these would be best paired with food."
"Though I've heard much about it, this is the first time I've tried this beer. It's excellent and very unique."
"The beer pours a darkish brown color with some red highlights. The beer also has fairly good head retention and lacing, with an interesting aroma of vanilla, cherry and sour funk. Flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except the sour tartness really dominates this beer. I do get some underlying vanilla and chocolate, but it's really dominated by the sour component. Mouthfeel is fairly light, with some prickliness from the sour. The alcohol is pretty well disguised, but the amount of sour in this beer is a bit much, and detracts a bit from this beers drinkability. Nevertheless, this is a pretty solid red flanders beer from the folks at Rodenbach."
"Drinkability: While being refreshing, I don't think I'd want too much more of it than I had just due to nature of it. But as a sour, it's great and enjoyable, a bit heavier than expected, but tasty and enjoyable. Not quite as tasty as Duck Duck Gooze though, which immediately followed this, but then again, not a whole lot else is."
"I had no problem finishing the large bottle by myself. I'd definitely like to grab another to keep in the fridge... but would definitely only have one a session."
"The color is incredible. Has a reddish tint when held up to the light, but the brown color is soft and full. The consistency is muddled in the smell, but the smell is quite round, rolling into the taste. The flavors and alcohol are overpowered by the tartness and, while smoky and oaky and slightly spicy, are dominated by the plum, apricot, and framboise flavors. Tartness also dominates the mouthfeel, but dissipates quickly with the awkward and rather late-blooming carbonation. But it drinks like a Belgian brown, with its complexity and fervent porousness. Excellent finish."
"the body is lite/medium with a lighter than expected carbonation.. very complex..."
"Overall I'm glad to get a chance to review this one. I had this for the first time less than two years ago and it really got me into sours beers. I've yet to find another Flanders Red that comes close."
"A world class beer, firing on all cylinders."
"Rodenbach Grand Cru has a ton of flavor but manages to remain balanced at the same time. This is one of the best Flanders I have had, and is certainly the best that is readily available and reasonably priced."
"D - Easy to drink for how much body this seems to have. Very pleasant."
"An extremely tasty beer. I've never had this before, somehow and I could easily finish this bottle by myself even if it's not as sour as I thought it would be."
"Now this is one sickly brew although it pours a decent colour with head. However the taste was getting so appaling after a while that i could not even finish a half pint. The smell is kind of telling it has slightly sickly hop notes and off malted with some sour grapes and apple. The mouthfeel again is kind of good but hard to segregate from the taste. I hope this was a bad sample"
"In all, this is a very fine beer, the pinnacle of its style. I can't say I'm completely hooked on the style, but when the occasion suits me, it's a fine thing to behold."
"Rodenbach Grand Cru is the classic Flemish Red Ale. Rich in its oak and fruit characteristics, along with a rich complex acetic quality. The luscious mouthfeel, and attractive visuals are all icing on a cake. I am happy that this beer is available once again, and for only $10 it is a relative bargain. This is a beer worthy of sharing at on any happy occasion, or enjoying by oneself on a fine evening. Outstanding."
"drinkability: it was a rough ride but I thin I'l appreciate it later."
"This one pours out a hazy, dark, orangey-reddish brown with about a 1/2"" head that dissipates quickly into a bubbly, cream coloured film. Not much in the way of lacing is left on my glass. Aromas of sour cherries, malt vinegar and rhubarb come across very strongly with subtle notes of vanilla and rich chocolate fudge (likely from the oak) in the background. As it continues to warm, I pick up some definite cheese aromas as well (fresh Gorgonzola comes to mind). Taste is quite tart and vinegar-like throughout with a sour green apple and cherry backbone. I pick up just a touch of ripe tomato hidden away amongs the other flavours as well. The finish is very sour and almost bone dry with a peppery twang on the linger. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very crisp and leaves somewhat of a tart, oily feeling as the high acidity of this brew causes my whole mouth to salivate. This is an exceptional sour that is quite complex making it a fun beer to pick out all the different flavours that arise as it warms in your glass. Because it is so sour, I'm not sure if I could handle more than 1 of these. However, this is a beer that should be savoured in order to really appreciate what's going on inside your glass. All around, a beautifully crafted Flemish Red that will test the palates of BA's of all levels."
"Drinkability: Right now, Im not a fan of this beer. It is reminiscent of the 07 Panil Barrique, which I did not enjoy, but LOVED the 05. Hopefully I can get my hands on a few of these to age and maybe I'll think differently about it."
"This is my favourite beer, but you have to like the style to like it."
"While I'm not a fan of sours, I actually enjoyed this and it was a pleasure to drink. Perhaps this will be a gateway beer for me."
"Simply great! That's all folks!"
"Great beer all around, but I like Duchess with Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes better."
"MF is crisp with the body being medium. It's very refreshing."
"If you want something sour with bite this is your beer. Great every once in awhile."
"This beer requires some time to be appreciated. My first bottle went down the sink after 3 sips, but those that followed were the most refreshing thing one could desire on a hot summer day. However, due to high level of acidity one at a time is enough."
"despite the bottle being over 1.5 years old, this brew has stood up well - quite a feat considering the ofttimes unreliable state of chinese warehousing practices..."
"D: This is definitely a love-it-or-hate-it beer. And even the most diehard Flemish sour fans would likely have trouble finishing more than a bottle at a time. Everyone should give this a try at least once simply because there's no other beer quite like it."
"D: This is a strong flavored beer, but with a nice sweet to sour balance that makes it pretty easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Both fair. The beer is quite sharp due to the apparent acidity but balanced. Drinkability is moderate as the beer is massive in flavor."
"D - Exceptional. I could drink plenty of this and it goes down so well. Plenty of flavour and interest."
"More interesting to taste and smell however. One whiff tells you this is going to be sour and one taste blows you away. I was not sure that this was how it was supposed to taste until I read some of the reviews here but this is by multiples the most sour beer I have ever had. The cherry like sour taste grabs hold of your tounge and does not let go. Right amount of carbonation for this type of beer makes it easier to drink than one might think. I'm not sure I could drink this on a regular basis but it is one hell of an interesting beer."
"Notes: If I didn't know better, I would be sure that this was brewed with cherries. Its crazy that they achieve that level of fruitiness just through using various strains of yeast."
"Poured into a snifter glass. Decent head, but did not last very long. The body has a dark amber color, with a tan head. The aroma is the first thing that popped out to me. Extremely robust aroma, smells very sour with nice roast malt smell. This beer has one of the most interesting taste to it. It's a sour beer but not overwhelming. The sourness is first thing your front palate picks up but is than followed by a nice roasty malt flavor to counter-act the sourness. Slightly bitter on the back palate and after taste. I probably couldn't drink more than two or three of these in one spot. But this is definitely a great beer, very rare in my opinion."
"Edit- After having this a few more times in bottle and draft, I just cant seem to get away from the over abundance of vinegar and sweetness in this. I still love this beer, but after having different versions of rodenbach, this grand cru version is not so grand in my eyes."
"Drinkability? Well, if it's Belgian sour you seek, this is apparently the blueprint. It's a sipper for sure; would pair well with cheese, or even a sweet dessert."
"D: A fantastic beer that is very refreshing and at the same time showcases a deep and rich character. Very complex and well balanced. Great vinous character."
"Poured into a goblit, the appearance is a light red color with a one finger head. The smell is tart, cherry, faint sugar. With a taste sour like the normal Rodenbach, but the Grand Cru to me seemed not to be as sour, but still interesting to say the least. With a tart, sweet taste, but not overpowering in my humble opinion. Mouthfeel is full and flavorful like most Flanders. Drinkability is pretty good for such an interesting and unique beer. Not a beer for someone who has only been exposed to bud light. But if you have tried some other styles and wish to expand your palate, start with the regular Rodenbach and then try this Rodenbach Grand Cru, it is worth your efforts."
"D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for a sour beer."
"Drinkability: this is a fantastic brew one of the best beers of this style out there ,i like sour brews tremendously,(to give you an idea of my taste) .over all great beer."
"Some acid to the taste, a big beer feel, but easy to drink, this is a classic"
"This one was my introduction to the style. Reviewed from notes, but I still remember the experience vividly almost a year later."
"pour is a light murky reddish brown with a decent head. beautiful nose. tart, cherry, wood, vanilla with a bit of dough. palate is actually quite nice. mellowed out tart in comparison to some bottles. predominantly cherry, but plum and blackberry fruit also. the skunky nature comes through in the food wood interaction like in a traditional lambic. a wonderful vanilla. with a wood that sits in the light doughy quality like a headboard. a 'german' apple malt finish with a light sense of smokiness even. some grape. very gentle but in the wood grain giving it a earthy acid similar to coffee. never really notice it before but i can say they this is one of the best bottle i've had. a mild earth that gives way to meaty seasoning herbs. a blend of thyme and rosemary mostly. quite a successful earth though. wonderful. one of the best."
"Awesome stuff. With the right food partner - (something that don't mind a bit of acid - salads, seafood, fried fish etc) - you could drink it forever."
"The Grand Cru is certainly better than the plain vanilla version, but I am not sure it beats Dutchesse, and certainly Panil has surpassed it. I would like to age one and see how it goes."
"A damn fine example of the style, arguably the best."
"Very smooth mouthfeel, and a very drinkable sour, as a dry finish takes away every sip."
"Incredibly drinkable, I find it hard to savor for very long. At 6% you could drink them as long as you could afford them."
"4 M&4 D: initially sharp on the texture but softens, while the soft fizziness sustains throughout the drink and provides a refreshing palate. A thirst-quenching, or thirst-provoking, beer with great complexity and depth. I can't pretend that I'm a great fan of this style, but this one surely is something really worth savouring once in a while--especially in summer."
"D: Very drinkable. Best paired with food (lighter fare, seafood, salads, etc.) than on its own. Definitely one to seek out!"
"Pouring from a big bottle, came out deep deep red. I couldnt wait to get into it. Smell gave many thoughts, superfruity, vinegar, sour. Hit the sourness I was looking for in the taste, and then that sweetness that comes out of no where. I knew what I was getting into and couldnt wait. very smooth and light in the mouth, carbination pushes the beer through. Very Drinkable, but wouldn't be on it an entire night."
"Overall, an excellent and complex brew."
"blurring the lines of aa lambic ,fantastic and worth checking out for sure"
"Drinkability? I won't have any trouble polishing of this bottle. Price is fantastic. A really great all around sour."
"overall this is a fantastic beer...i want more of it...and plan on getting more...the sours are growing on me"
"Poured a deeper amberish/brown color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of woodiness, vinegar, and sour cherry. Tastes of vinegar and sour dark fruits. If you don't like vinegar, skip this one for sure."
"UPDATED: APR 27, 2013 First sour ale. Been putting this one off for ages, but realised it’s 4 months past it’s use by, so time to face my fears! Head lasts for all of two seconds before dissapearing without a trace. Dark, fiery, ruby red, perfectly clear. Aroma is sweet red wine (lambrusco?), vinegar, stale sweat, more vinergar, sweet plums, vinegar, raisins, brandy, and more vinergar. Taste is (surprise!) vinegar, unripe plums, astringent lemon peel. I can feel my stomach shuddering in protest. No where near as crazy as the aroma though. Rather pleasant actually, after a few sips. Phwoar! This is once crazy mofo style right here! Cherry and other dark fruits are apparent after being desensitised to the vinegar. Slightly watery, with active carbonation giving it extra tang (as if it needed it). No way I’d be drinking more than one of these in a week, let alone a night. However, this is my first sour ale... Crazy crazy crazy. UPDATE: Now that I’ve tried my fair share of sours, I’m really digging this.... bloody awesome."
"Overall, after my disappointing experience with the Dissident I decided to give this a go as it was relatively cheap at $10 a bottle and pretty available. This is definitely going to be my go to beer when I'm craving something on the sour side. Highly recommended for new and experienced beer drinkers alike."
"750ml bottle $8 courtesy of Beverage World in Ft. Oglethorp, GA. Nice dark ruby red color. This smells awesome, glue, vinegar, sour, lemons. The flavor seems to lean more towards eating glue and sucking on a lemon at the same time but is definitely a little more sour than the regular Rodenbach. For only $8 this was an outstanding value."
"The drink is light in body with a touch of puckering that fades quickly and a near-perfect sizzle of carbonation. Positively quaffable."
"The overall impression is simply.... WOW! What started as a beer I really did not like, quickly became a beer I was fascinated with and wanted more of. Wow."
"D- Extremely good beer, and pretty drinkable. It took a while to tag off the 750 but was a joy, none the less. Given the acidity, it's a sipper. Definitely will drink again."
"D: You know, I'm partial to american wild/sours. The Belgians, with their mix of sweetness and heavy vinegar flavors, don't afford me the same appreciation. I'm glad I tried this. It's a solid, well crafted beer. But it's not my preferred sour."
"This is a standout beer and one of my top rated active bottled beers for this style."
"I am a huge fan of this style, but this is not AS amazing as Ommegang Rouge- still amazing though. The flavors are extremely layered and rich, but they don't quite blend as seamlessly at the front as they could. But if left to linger, what you have is utter deliciousness- a party in your mouth...and a very good beer overall."
"Not a big fan, might eventually try again to get the hang of it."
"Date consumed: 27 July 2008"
"The mouthfeel is crisp and light. Carbonation is a little high but it fits very well. Extremely drinkable, as this is probably one of the more refreshing beers I've had of late. I didn't get tired of the tartness or sourness at all, even after a few glasses. I'm definitely going to try this on a hot summer's day. Highly recommended."
"D: For the style, it was a pretty drinkable beer with a pretty good mouthfeel and taste combination. However, this style is a pretty acquired taste, like sushi. If another style was available, I might have went for that beer over this one."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Drinkability is very good here. I can get this at the local shop and def. will be doing just that."
"D - Solid Flanders Red through and through... Everything one would expect with great taste complexity that proves a pleasant surprise..."
"Pours a cloudy, darker copper with a rocky off-white head. Oak, cherries, sour yeast, an ethyl. All the Flemish sour tastes are there: cherries, funky yeast, oak. Nice blend with a sweeter malt which gives off a bit of a graham-cracker taste. Kind of like a very, very tart cherry pie with some funk. Thought this was better than their classic."
"Pours a very dark amber color with a foamy off-white head. Very sour fruity aroma with hints of oak and vanilla. Intensely tart and acidic with a nice amount of sour cherry as well as oak and vanilla. Very sour with a puckering dry finish."
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is slightly astringent yet delectable, viniger like element also play a part in the mouthfeel."
"D - A great beer to be sure, but the sourness deters from overall drinkability."
"D- I really need to get my hands on some more Flanders Red Ales...I enjoy this style. At 7.99 a bottle this is a good buy."
"D - This is a great beer that you can enjoy all night."
"I would definitely pick this up again."
"d- i could drink this until i die. very nice experience. very pleasant and different yet still very approachable, i'll have to spread the word on this one."
"This is a fairly amazing brew that would challenge many peoples perception of what a beer is."
"An amazing beer. Personally I prefer the regular Rodenbach over the Grand Cru as it's not quite as sour, but even still this is an awesome beer. Highly recommended."
"Go Phillies!"
"One of the most drinkable beers i have ever had. I love this beer."
"Extremely enjoyable, perfect session beer for a warm summer day"
"Wow, all I can say is wow. I did not expect anything nearly this good coming into this. Very drinkable in small quantities. I wish I had someone to share this 750 with because now I'm stuck drinking the whole thing. This beer may have singlehandedly changed my opinions about sour ales. I can only hope that others I try in the future are as good as this."
"This was truly exceptional and unexpected. I had tasted the Rodenbach before and had not particularly loved it. This Grand Cru is a different ball game. I poured it in a Duvel glass. It poured a nice reddish color with a good solid head that collapsed quickly. I loved it at first sip. First there was the tartness. Just perfect. I love kriek beer but always found it a bit too sweet. This tasted like a kriek that was not overly sweet. Then the taste lingered and left a long lasting pleasure that truly pleased my palate. I will seek it again. This was great."
"Drinkability is high. The flavor on this beer is just awesome and the alcohol is pretty low making for an easy to consume beer. I really want to guzzle it for some reason."
"M/D - Full bodied and excellent feel. Incredibly drinkable. Wow, I was about to give up on the crazy Belgian sours, but this one has me hooked."
"Drinkablity: Wonderful, absulutely wonderful. I've never had anything like it."
"Label says its a blend of 1/3 young beer with 2/3 2 year old wood aged beer. Good stuff!"
"I just recently developed a taste for the style and this is one of the best I've had so far. Highly recommended."
"Deep red in colour, a crystal clear apart from a few floaties from my heavy handed pour. The head is small and retreats back to a persistent collar thought the carbonation is lively. Smells of tart cherries, sherry with a funky brett edge. Solid sourness in the mouth, not just on the tongue but all around. Complex tart fruit and malt flavours. The balance is exceptional with the sourness a counterpoint to the rich malty sweetness. The beer feels full bodied and sweet yet finishes bone dry. A wonderful experience of contradictions with a touch of funk. Truly a world class beer."
"Drinkability: ""Arresting"" at first, but you get used to it. Acidity does burn at the back of the throat toward the end of the glass. On the whole, I'd have to say a little overrated."
"I will place another recommendation for this brew. If you are into sours at all it's a must try. The drinkability was great I easily finished the bomber myself while sitting in the yard enjoying the last of our New England summer"
"Poured a dark clear red like polished mahogany. Nice two finger head of tan bubbles displays good retention. Moderate lacing. Strong alcohol aromas with yeast and sourdough, sweet like overripe fruit and sour like vinegar. Wild. And what flavors! Incredibly complex and demanding. Maintains the interesting seesaw of malty sweet and sour. The sourness is acidic in a fruity way like the lambic made from cherries. Tart, tart, tart. Like a fortified wine (port, sherry). An oaky backbone holds it all together. Medium body and good mouthfeel. Highly drinkable but odd. This is probably the most unusual beer I have ever found myself liking. Very German, it reminds me of sauerkraut. Unique!"
"I have had a few 'Reds' in my time, but this one was very true to its style, a rich sourness prevails throughout and althought not a favourite style of mine, you can't help but appreciate the complex mix your senses are given by this beer. Whoever blended this brew did a fine job."
"D: I don't know what people are griping about here, compared to some other beers this one is sweet in comparison. A little drying on the back end by thats the point really. All I want it another sip! I'm sad I let this beer hide on me for so long."
"Acidic and fizzy, lovely. A great sipper. A sipper at 6%, this could go all night and I would with this one. I wish I had some good cheese right now. Next time I will plan accordingly. Soo good."
"D - I know this style isn't for everyone but I love it. I could drink it anytime."
"d: Refreshinglt tart and superbly drinkable. This could become a regular in my rotation."
"again... VLAAMSVEST '08 (Paeters Vaetje, Antwerpen)"
"Drinkability: I want this on a hot sticky day; refreshing beyond belief. I'm glad this is a 750ml bottle. It's welcoming and just a complete surprise. This is something to introduce a non-beer drinker to."
"D: This is an extremely tasty beer and one that I would never get tired of for years to come. It's also fairly easy to drink, especially if you do not mind the tartness/sourness of this beer."
"Looks and smells like a dirty, sour pond. Or like a sour apple and stinky cheese plate. Tastes fruity with strawberries and cherries. The taste is really different from the aroma but everything works pretty good. I definitely enjoyed this the most out of all the Belgian reds we tried."
"Pours dark maroon with a very light beige head. Smell is sour cherries and perhaps some cinnamon. Taste is tart cherries, vinegar, with maybe some funk. A bit creamy, and nicely carbonated. A tart and enjoyable sour."
"Unlike a lambic, I could drink this all day. It is so refreshingly amazing. The acidity is not over powering, while the tartness is great. The mouthfeel is sparkling and keeps the mouth sour puckered, hehehe."
"This would be my first sour ale. I am thinking because of high marks on this site that this is probably a good example of a style that I simply just don't like."
"On a side note, I enjoyed this brew while speaking to the owner of 21st Amendment Brewing out of San Fransisco, a guy named Sean. Great guy and a pleasure to share a beer with!"
"Served on tap, this pours an opaque ruby color, with a small white head that quickly dissipates and little or no lacing on the glass. The smell is faintly of apples. The taste is intensely sour, accompanied by a strong tart apple flavor as well as a less strong cherry flavor. Who would have thought this would be so light and easy to drink? For me, the Flemish Sour Ale has been the final frontier in beer style appreciation. This is definitely a beer to be enjoyed by the glass, rather than the pitcher. That said, this is a humdinger! Very enjoyable!"
"11.2 oz bottle:A wonderfully floral sour apple aroma, cherries, somewhat of a sugar note, and a tartness. Appearance is deep dark red with a medium sized tan head the diminishes into nothing. Taste is an upfront tartness with the carbonation bubbling on your tongue. Then falling off quite quickly and building back up again into a light sour apple taste. Palate is tart, very carbonated on the tongue and a surprisingly clean aftertaste. Overall, This is a really interesting beer in what it does inside your mouth with every sip. Wow, I am really enjoying this one. Worth the 12.99 a 4 pack."
"D: This goes down very easily"
"Drinkability: Fairly easy to drink, but the acetic acid catches up with you after a while."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a thin creamy head. Aromas of apple, alcohol, and some dark fruit. Up front taste of a sweet apple cider blends with cherry, raisins, and a tart green apple flavor to form an almost brandy like flavor, very complex. High carbonation, medium body, this beer coats and cleanses your mouth awakening your taste buds. The combination of sweet and tart is fantastic. An absolute must try for anyone who appreciates great beer."
"Pours a reddish brown in the glass that creates a nice, fluffy white head. The head slowly goes away to leave light lacing on the glass. Smells sweet and fruity but I can;t place the fruit immediately. The taste is very distinct and very sour upon first touch. The sour gives way nicely to a sweet almost wine taste as it rolls back on the tongue. It as a very light and crisp mouthfeel that goes down smothly. I would not be able to drink more than one, but that;s just my opinion. As I become better versed in this style, that may change."
"The style is my favorite, but I prefer the Rodenbach Alexander which blends both the 18 month and the 6 month ales. The Grand Cru is for purists and only has 18 month aged ales. The result is that it is a bit more puckerish, a bit more vinegary, a bit more acidic, less pleasantly sweet and vinous, a bit more oaky, and a lot less cherryish than its better counterpart. The beer pours a slighly hazy ruby brown, with some head. The smell is a delight in that you get the nice oaky, cherry, fruity, musty, and slightly vinegary aroma characteristic of the style. The mouthfeel is very good as well, and you feel as though you are having a nice aperitif, port, or other vinous after dinner drink. The style is eminently unique, unlike almost every other style of ale made, so in that sense it is a must try. Within the style, I prefer the Rodenbach Alexander and the Duchesse de Bourgogne. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability - Don't think I would have more than a couple of these at a time, but I would have a couple every night if I could. I actually bought a bottle of this on my way out of the city and had it with a friend the other night."
"Mouthfeel is exceptional. The first sip is always a kicker, but then it settles in and I can't stop drinking it. I love this stuff!"
"The complexity of the Grand Cru definately makes it superior to the more one-dimentional Rodenbach. A thoroughly enjoyable brew."
"This was a very interesting ride for my tastebuds, and I expect that I will need to try more of this style before I can fully appreciate this beer. Nevertheless, even to my inexperienced palate I can tell that this is a fine brew, although the vinegar qualities are somewhat of a detractor."
"Found a case of this in the back of the cooler at the liquor store I work at. It is well out of date but I hope it was aged. I am sampling this beer for free to report back to my general manager so we can still sell it at a reduced price so here goes.... Pours a nice deep tea like color with a pretty good but fast dissapating head. Smell is strong of oak and sour apple and cherry. Very intense bouquet. Taste is very thick in the finish, just clings to the back of the throat with oak, sour cherry and green apple. Very smooth with a big tang on the tongue. I couldn't stand the whole bottle at once though."
"Why does this fingernail polish taste/smell so appetizing? Very acidic and juicy feeling, begs to be drunk."
"Very good mouth-feel, thin yet crisp and refreshing."
"This is my first Flanders red and I actually liked it. I was a little iffy at first but really enjoyed it in the end. Went great with a Greek salad... mixed well with the olives, feta, and vinagrette."
"Exceptionally delightful. The tartness provided a perfect balance to all the other intricate flavor characteristics. A little like an extremely drinkable dry sherry, with fruit and nut notes playing on each other. Not much to report in the oak flavor department, I guess those huge oak casks that have been used for decades are well beyond adding oak flavor characteristics. My wife, who only likes the finest of beers, raved about this one."
"I can drink an entire bottle of this, and might even want seconds, which is rare for a 750ml serving of any beer, regardless of how much i enjoyed it."
"This is a fantastic example of the style. Very complex, very well done."
"Served dark burgundy with red highlights and a tan head. Looks brilliant in the glass. Smells of sour apples and apple cider vinegar. Very pungent and sharp aroma. Tastes very tart, almost striking for how malty the beer looks. It's not though. Drinks very dry with lactic and acetic pricks throughout the drink. There's some lingering oakiness in the aftertaste too. Outstanding beer. It's not as complex as other Flanders reds I've had before, but it's extremely straightforward and a remarkable beer."
"It shows up black-red with a thin head but not much lace. There's something in the color that promises a lot somehow. The smell is cooked cherries, dark chocolate and a sour note that is just mouthwatering. The taste is surprisingly sweet, with a sour note thrown in for good measure. It has a very dry finish, reminding me of cherries and leather. Just wonderful, really. The mouthfeel is too thin, which is surprising given the depth of this offering. The drinkability is great, with the dry finish not dry enough to offset the good flavor, leaving a very, very drinkable beer indeed. Get some of this and horde it!"
"D - a nice beer to sip although I wouldn't look to have more than one at a time."
"The first thing you notice is the huge head. The bartender at Monk's had to top up twice to get about an 80% liquid to head ratio. The color is a beautiful translucent reddish brown. The first taste has crisp Granny Smith apple tartness, but nice roundness in the mouth and just a little malty sweetness going down. This is a really fine beer. It doesn't really taste like sherry but if you can imagine the depth of a good dry sherry reborn as a Belgian ale you'll come close to the Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"D: The beer has great flavor, but I can't see myself drinking more than 1 or 2 of these in one sitting. The sourness and tartness is wonderful, but definitely not something that could be enjoyed all night long."
"D- this goes down quick and makes me want more and more"
"Poured from a small bottle into a tulip glass, it presents a thick, off-white head that dissipates quickly, leaving only traces of lacing down the glass. The color is dark -- a deep reddish brown. Smell is sharp, like vinegar, with lots of fruit. Taste is tangy but rich, with some figgy notes and plenty of citrus -- tangerine, more than anything else. It feels thin to the palate but fills up the mouth very well -- a tad viscous, but not too much. It's a sipping beer, for sure, but goes down easy."
"Great beer, thoroughly enjoyable. It wants food, and the last glass paired well with some Dubliner cheese."
"D: Not a session beer only because of the tartness and complexity. What a shame that I must mark it down for these delightful characteristics. The drinkability of a single bottle is high, but two bottles would be too much. This beer is SO tasty."
"Medium body and perfect carbonation. The only knock here is the puckering of the mouth and the charring of the throat. Drinkability is also affected by this, but if you love sour beer, you can drink this all night."
"D: A nice drinking and smooth sour beer that is very polished flavor wise, clean and easy to drink."
"d - Man, this was an eye opening experience for what beer can be. This is out there in terms of aroma and taste. It's an amazing experience, but it's so extreme that I don't think a drop more than this 11.2oz bottle would be appropriate or palatable. It's a must try, but the price and intensity are going to keep it from being a regular."
"Liked the Rodenbach and was curious to try this one, thought it was slightly better than the classic red, not many complaints here but lacked some complexity and sourness in my opinion, would drink again, recommended"
"Honestly, drinking a lot of this may be too much for the palate and for the stomach, but while it's good, it's fantastic."
"Overall: A wonderful beer with an engaging aroma, great taste, a nice win-like finish & brings just enough sourness. Love it & would definitely buy again. I think this would be a great beer to introduce a wine lover to beers."
"Drinkablity: Very tasty and consumable. A challenge at first, but worth getting used to."
"Drinks a bit too slow. I remember this being an easier beer, maybe my tastes are changing? Or maybe I'd try this one after my taste buds were whacked in the past! Not as harsh as the laFollie though"
"That said, this still has plenty of charm, and I like it quite a bit more than their Classic."
"Good."
"I really wanted to love this brew but it wasn't quite what I expected. The vinegar and acidic qualities of it put me off a bit. It was my first of the style and a very, very interesting brew so I will definitely give it another shot down the line."
"Drinkability: Amazingly drinkable. A wonderful beer."
"Had this at a restaurant with a nice hearty steak and potato dinner. Poured ruby red with a slight head. Smell was sweet with some cherry notes. Taste was tart and refreshing not cloying at all and very easy to drink. I enjoyed this beer and would like to try it on a nice summer day. Overall and excellent brew."
"D: It's not that drinkable because the flavour is so strong."
"Drinkability: I'll have this one around on special occasions or when I need to treat myself. Good brew! But a few of these would be a little to much for me to handle...but a great break from the ordinary."
"I love this beer! I have had it bottled before and can still get bottles of it a few blocks from my apt. I just had it on tap two weeks ago at Town Hall Brewery in Minneapolis, MN. I also just had a bottle of it that had been aged in a friends cellar for an extra year. If you like sour, aging it an extra year made my mouth almost cringe! The pour is a ruby or deep rich red in color with a very slight hazyness to it. Aromas of cherry and plum as well as a tartness on the nose. Taste is complex. You get the dark fruits of cherry and plum as well as vinegar and mustard seed. A nice champagne feel in the mouth. Great beer!"
"astringent, biting palate cleansing, appetizing. Cherris, vanilla, smokieness for the oak, slightly sugary cranberry-juice like finish. This beer is a little sweeter than the Rodenbach classic red, due to the sweetness of the vanilla notes from the oak aging. hugely drinkable, very refreshing. Could be consumed anytime, maybe try pairing with a turkey, wild rice and cranberry sauce."
"A really good sour beer that is very easy to drink. Not so acidic that it's hard to drink. I liked this one very much, one of the better (though I've like many of them) sour beers I've had."
"This was an excellent oak aged Belgian red ale. It had a pungent aroma and grape-like undertones. The mouthfeel is slightly sweet, extremely acidic and fruity, and deliciously sour. This is definately one fto stock up on when available. It was great from the beginning to the finish. This is a complex beer and not your typical Grand Cru."
"D: Not my style...but I could learn to love this if this were the norm rather than the exception. Reminds me of a fine dry red wine...rich and satisfyingly. I'll go there again but I doubt this could be a session beer for me."
"Pours without much head. Cloudy semi-transparent reddish-brown. Smells of sour fruits--cherries, grapes, and pineapple--along with the sweet scent of brown sugar. An intriguing sour taste, like a mildly carbonated fruit punch with pineapple and cherry cider notes as well as a bit of a vinegar streak, but the flavors hold together to make it quite drinkable. The mouthfeel is light and the tartness--like a cider--is crisply refreshing. This is a beer with a presence and a unique complexity that makes one ponder as it is consumed."
"D - Very good red ale. Does not really go down very smooth but that is what I look for in the style. When I'm looking for a sour red ale, this is one I would pick up. Recommemded."
"Sour beers are not my favorite style, but this beer was very enjoyable, and will be what I compare all Flander's Red Ales against."
"If you can find it for ten bucks a four-pack like I somehow did, go for it!"
"Taste is much the same as the smell but much more enjoyable. A very good amount of tart taste. Lots of dark fruits in the taste as well. Grapes, plums and raspberry. Very crisp, tart and lively on the mouthfeel. This is a good brew."
"D: The bottle suggests pairing it with seafood and 'dishes garnished with lemon,' which could be a nice choice. I'd think it would work well with a nice cheese plate, too. A spectacular drink. I've gotta get more of this."
"Delicous Flander's Red. So powerfull yet one of the most drinkable brews in the world. Pairs better with most dishes than many fine wines."
"Plenty of body with a slight astringency. High drinkability and a Flanders to be reckoned with."
"I was pleasantly surprised at the drinkability of this beer. Sour beers really push my personal boundaries in the beer arena. There is plenty of sourness to go around, but it is somehow tamed down- perhaps from the 18 months of aging this beer undergoes. There's a definite sour grape taste going on that for me takes on the main characteristic of this beer."
"While this is a little puckering even my girlfriend enjoyed it, and she's rather skeptical of this entire style of beer. The mouthfeel is nothing crazy, but it's very drinkable for a flanders beer. I could've had more than one 12 oz easily. I would also say this is better than the Rodenbach classic but not by a ton, they're both fantastic. This just may be a little more mature."
"D- Wonderful balance of sour acidity and sweet fruit, truly a stand out sour ale that I would highly recommend, this was much-beloved among even the grizzliest of raters at our table"
"D: An exceptional beer from Rodenbach, would be a great thirst quencher, would drink a lot of this if it wasn't $4 a bottle, glad it finally came to Orange County."
"This beer pours a dark ruby color. The head is large, pink, and fluffy. Lacing is thorough with thick chunks of foam sticking to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of passion fruit, bretta, oak, honey, and lavender. The taste is of cherries with a harsh tartness, followed by a stinging sourness, and ending in a balance of sweet and sour. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, there is a lot going on in this beer. It seem I find something new with each sip. I will certainly drink this many, many more times."
"Although the flavours are strong, the beer is very drinkable."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. One of my first experiences with the style but I'll start searching out more of these after this one!"
"I've been very excited for this one. The appearance is a deep amber rust. Smell is a little sharp but very fresh (not warm or spicy)- orchard, ahhhh, apples, and acerbic. The very first smell is the oak followed quickly by the sour fruit. Slight undertone of malt. Taste- tart up front, like sour apples, slightly sharp on the tongue, some carbonation. Soft sweetness on the back end to balance the taste. More balance than other red ales. Overall, extremely pleasing and above average drinkability. No head, no lace. Resembles the body of a wine. Direct relative of the orchard. Warms the stomach. It's been a treat. I would love to try it on tap."
"really good with cheese, my gf loved this beer"
"Pours a deep ruby, not as much head as I would have expected, less than a finger maybe. Not very much lace along the sides of the glass, and the head pretty much dissipates to nothing. Aroma is fruity, some plum and tart raspberry scent. Some underlying malt tones in the nose as well. Lots of wild yeast. Very tart/sour bite in the taste, mimics the aroma, sweet plum and cherry flavors, some orange as well. Some malt sweetness to balance out the sour. Couldnt detect any hops at all. Mouthfeel gives loads of carbonation, medium body, making this pretty tart beer very palatable. Refreshing and invigorating, extremely drinkable. Flemish sours arent usually the first beer Id order, but this was very good."
"750 ml bottle. Apparently nearly impossible to get through normal retail channels in California. Had to order mine through Liquid Solutions.THE definitive Flemish red. Sour, fruity, yeast, with just a hint of citric acidity. Wonderful. If I could find a source in the Bay Area, I'd buy a case, or perhaps a bottle a week."
"Everyone should try this."
"Light bodied, very spritzy and dry. Extremely drinkable. My impression is a fairly clean fruity flavour combined with quite a funky, complex aroma. I doubt either would work on its own, but the combination is fantastic."
"Drinkability - I love sour brews. If you enjoy sours, the drinkability of this beer is pretty much perfect. Although I shared this bottle, but I don't think I would have a problem finishing this one off. It is a damn shame this isn't sold in my area, otherwise I would drink this all the time."
"I didn't have any food with this, but that would probably make this beer more enjoyable."
"Pours a mild ruby/brown ale with a one-finger head. Aroma is a decent sourness upfront that is reminiscent of cherries. Very tart, much more than Rodenbach Classic. Taste is very tart and nice with the mouthfeel taking on the essence of cherries. Not too sour at the back of the throat. A second sip brings about that wonderful tartness that I'm starting to develop an affinity for. Excellent! Drinkable as well."
"11.2 ounce bottle, says best before 11/16/07. I hope a month doesn't affect it that much! It pours a brown/red color with no head at all. No lacing either. The aroma is cherries, oak and booze. It smells much stronger than the 6% ABV. Taste is similar to the aroma, although the alcohol isn't strong in the taste at all. Sour cherries is the strongest thing I can taste, along with some other berries. There's definitely an acidic tart taste, but there's also a good bit of sweetness there too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with moderate carbonation. It's a bit thin, but not watery. Drinkability is good, it's not something I think I could drink more than a bottle or 2 at a time, but it's pretty good for when I'm in the mood for this style of beer. It's definitely worth a try, not a bad choice."
"D- Very enjoyable to drink slowly"
"This is not a session beer but accompanied with the right foods this ale would make an amazing dinner companion. I liked this sour brown and would order it again."
"Murky reddish brown with quickly dissipating off white head. Nose is tart cherries, and some funk. Taste- pretty straight forward sour cherry. Slightly acidic but nothing crazy. Citrusy finish to it. Carbonation is high which suits the style. Very good beer, but not mind blowing. Some woodiness comes through as it warms. Definitely an approachable beer for the style."
"It's hard to believe that there is, indeed, NO fruit in this beer. That yeast is working overtime, I tell ya."
"Overall: This is truly a kick-ass beer that is unlike just about any ive ever had, Unbelievably delicious and refreshing and complex. Very highly recommended"
"Taste is full-on sour, with a palette-drying finish that really opens up the beer-like flavors in the aftertaste. They're otherwise (not surprisingly) buried in the overall profile of the beer. I'm not sure fruit is the right word to describe the complex stew of yeast byproduct we have here, but the beer is interesting. This is not something I would drink too often, instead spending my cash on Duchesse."
"Overall: I feel like my description makes it sound really gross when in reality the flavors work together; it's just very unique and certainly not for everybody. It's definitely more aggressive than American variations on the style such as that brewed by Monk's. You may want to try one of those before jumping up to the big boys, just so you know what you're in for."
"A fantastic and quite accessible grand cru, it does a great service to the style."
"Smells very tart, sweet...cherries, raspberries. Mmmm, I'm loving the nose on this. Taste is what would be expected from the nose. Extremely tart and puckering, sweetness, sour cherries, can pick up on the woodiness in the finish...almost musky. Mouthfeel is very thin, very carbonated, finishes ever so slightly dry. I'm huge on this style and love this beer, so I could sip on many of these."
"Rodenbach's best offering. It's beautiful deep red color and off-white head lead to a wonderful sour cherry smell. As for the taste it has a nice sweet, but sour start and finishes dry. It had the right amount of carbonation to perk it up in my mouth. This is one of my favorites!"
"O: Thoroughly delicious, slightly over the top for regular consumption"
"Drinkability : Une très bonne brune fruitée, très agréable et désaltérante."
"Had again 1/24/09 - modified review slightly, mainly format"
"D_This is absolutely delicious. Complex, challenging and at the same time approachable. I am wanting more and more of this."
"M/D: Medium bodied. Carbonation is around medium. Finish leaves a tartness along with a mild dryness. Pretty good drinkability. Would go nicely with food."
"Poured into a chalice a nice ruby red color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, traces of sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, good dose of cherries, raspberries, and caramel. The taste is sweet, tangy, lots of cheeries/raspberries. Nice little tingle of carbonation at first. Slightly dry finish. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice Flanders Red."
"drinkability is good for drinkers who prefer the taste of a flanders red, and gateway drinkers who have come fro mthe world of wines. overall, this is a great example of the style, and worth checking out for a different taste. cheers!"
"A very strong tartness. Worth pairing with a cheddar aged multiple years. A style that may not be suited for everyone. If you like something extremely tart, this is good for you."
"It'd be hard to session this beer but I think it would do an outstanding job as a food beer due to the high levels of acidity. it'd go great with steak or really any other heavy grilled meats."
"Drinkability- Very nice for a beer with this level of sweetness. Back to back I noticed very little difference between this and the regular Rodenbach."
"Drinkability: Nice, well-balanced and refreshing. Will not be to everyone's taste, but I quite enjoyed it."
"D: Good, but limited slightly by sourness."
"This beer was consumed as a tribute to Michael Jackson. His books and videos opened a world that I never know existed and that I enjoy much more immensely as a result. Thank you Michael."
"On tap at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia (never seen it on tap before). Poured into a tulip dark red with a frothy head. Smells of lemon, sour cherry, slight vanilla, and vinegar. Tastes like it smells only smoother. Sourness is definitely mellow and not overpowering. Finish is bone dry and tart. This is my favorite Flanders Red because of the fact that it is quite sour but at the same time it has a silky smooth quality in both its flavor and mouthfeel. Highly recommended."
"This is one of my favourite sour beers. I'm glad to finally have a whole bottle to my self instead of the shared samples I've previously had. Thanks to Goldorak for the bottle!"
"Pours slightly cloudy and reddish brown with 1/4 inch bubbly head and active carbonation. Smells sour with wet cardboard and green apple. The initial flavor is sweet and salty that transitions quickly into a sour aftertaste that picks up the green apples noted in the aroma. That apple flavor is relatively long lived, especially on the tip of the toungue. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a lightly oily texture and fizzy carbonation. This beer is interesting and complex but definitely not something I would drink very often."
"Drinkability- The most difficult beer I've encountered lately to actually enjoy based on its mouthfeel, yet the flavor and style execution is almost flawless."
"A medium body, medium effervescence, sour cherry/vinegary aftertaste fades fast. An extremely drinkable brew. I want more!"
"DA: not bad at 6% ABV."
"I split a 22 oz of this with SurlySober in a futile effort to empty his beer fridge."
"Not as oaked as New Belgium La Folie, more drinkable that Duchesse de Bourgogne and more wine like than Petrus Oud Bruin."
"I would suggest pairing this with a pot of freshly steamed mussels (and pouring another bottle in the pot if you are making them yourself)."
"Similar flavor to the nose, very light and tart. Body is light, with not a lot of carbonation, the powerful fruit blast stays on the palate. An incredible array of yeast strains combine to produce this outstanding wild Flemish ale. Very flavorful and easy to drink. As highly recommended a Red Ale as any."
"D - This is a greatly enjoyable beer. It is so well balanced that I find myself often overlooking the complexity of its flavor and aroma. Hard to find any flaws in this one."
"Very complex, wonderfully refreshing, a great summer brew, one of my favorites."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The aging smoothes out this beer very nicely, but it's difficult to see this as drinkable with the great degree of tartness. Yet, somehow it gets better the more I drink, strange. To sum this up in one word - peculiar, but I feel as if there's something more here than I'm realize. I'll come back to this one sometime down the road."
"Pours a deep amber color with a nice light tan head. It has the aromas of sweet dark cherries. In the taste, sour cherries, a nice malt and a tad yeasty. It is a smooth beer, well the sourness leaves a small sweetness behind. It has a great body nice and complex."
"can slightly appreciate the grape and winey side of it."
"Poured out rather dark when held up to a light revealed a redish hint with a nice cream colored head that faded quickly. Smell reminds me of vinegar and fruit with the sour yet sweet taste to follow and a hint of citrus. Tingled the taste buds with the carbonation and left me wanting another"
"Very surprised at the very faint sound when the cork was opened. My first thought was uh-oh!! Not to worry though. Virtually no head. Cherry, vinegar, and large amount of oak. No overpowering sour like some of this style. Good mouthfell - only a lishgt pucker. Surprisingly lively considering the lack of head and lack of any kind of pop with the cork. If this was the first sour ale I had I would be really iimpressed. But I prefer others over this one - slightly."
"Now as much as I enjoy these types of beers, I have always had a tremendously hard time drinking them with any ease. The sourness is beyond me and my capacity to handle them like a pro Lambic drinker is not something I can keep up with. So on that note I unfortunately have a hard time attributing a nubmer to the drinkability of such a beer. So since this took me a very, very long time to finish, I guess its my average? Damn good stuff though."
"Cheers!"
"d - very refreshing and pleasant to drink."
"This is fantastically delicious beer. I'd advise anyone who is interested in Flanders reds to start here before proclaiming their love, like or dislike for this unique style. Put me solidly in the 'love' camp. It's hard to imagine that La Folie is superior since there's so little room between Rodenbach Grand Cru and perfection."
"D: I would never drink more than one of these, but as a desert beer or with appetizers on a hot summer day it would be wonderful."
"D - I can see why people would be turned off by this type of beer but I dig it. Not for regular drinking but every now and then would be good."
"A decent beer though red beer not one of my favourite styles."
"I'd like to describe this in more detail, but I really am mostly getting tart, sour flavour out of this. Drinkable, but there's other beers I'd rather have."
"D- very easy to drink, low ABV and the complexity of the taste is a very enjoyable experience for your mouth"
"Overall, this was the first Flander's ale I had ever had; I forgot what complexity this style can bring. I must start getting these types of beer back into the regular line up."
"This is the James Joyce of beers. Its not for the casual quaffer and may leave you confused and upset at times but the experience makes you a richer human being. Well, perhaps that's stretching it but if you want a beer that is both shocking and enriching Rodenbach Grand Cru is a good choice."
"Mouthfeel was spritzy and medium in body."
"I had high hopes for this beer, and it is good . . . don't get me wrong, but it isn't some transcendental experience either."
"Drinkability is such that I'm distraught that I have but this one sample - for now."
"Pours a clear reddish-brown which resembles mahogany, with a huge head that settles down to about a finger and leaves somewhat spotty lacing. Has a nice yeasty smell to it. This beer even smells tart. As for the taste, this is amazingly complex. Simply calling it tart or sour is a huge understatement. There is a nice fruity sourness, specifically berries and citrus, that makes this especially enjoyable. In terms of mouthfeel this is light-bodied and moderate to high carbonation. In terms of drinkability this is great. While this is quite tart I found it very enjoyable. The amazing complexity of this beer makes it a pleasure. Bottom Line: this is an excellent beer that I would certainly recommend."
"A delicious beer, and it shows my love of sour beers that I don't find this particularly sour. It gets only a relatively minor response from my salivary glands, and finishes sweet more than sour. Still pretty tasty."
"Drinkability is great. Killed thi in no time and reached for the Duchesse to finish the night off. I think this style could take a bit more alcohol. I'd love to try a 9% version."
"RERATE: I like it this time. I'm jacking up drinkability-- this is actually very subdued. I'm guessing it was warm or oxidized last time; in any case, this is a fine sour beer. Fortunately I overrated last time, so the numbers will stay more or less the same."
"This bottle was labeled as best by 11/16/07 and poured into a chimay chalice consumed on 3/15/07. I drank this right after RR Suplication to compare two different sour ales. This one pours brown but the light makes it appear ruby colored. There is very little head. It has a very similar aroma to the Supplication with a very strong sour brett presence. The taste is also similar to the Supplication with a strong sour brett presence but is still very smooth. This is sweeter than the Supplication and has a slightly fuller body. This is a great example of a Flanders red."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a carbonation tingle that adds a bit of bite to the tartness, and the drinkability is really good, but I really like this style of beer."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer and again, it makes me wonder why in the heck we can't get beer like this in Texas. I really enjoy the depth of flavor in this beer and ones similar (like the Duchesse), but for some reason ""Texans don't get it"". A beer like this is one that you will either love or hate depending on your preference, but I really enjoy them. I would most certainly drink this beer again and would do so regularly if it were available in my area. As it is, I got a four pack (now three pack) in Florida to sit on an enjoy on special occasions. I would definitely recommend this beer to try and see if your palate is agreeable to it or not."
"A wonderful beer, however, I'm going to have to go with the Duchesse as far as pure drinkability and enjoyment goes. This is an amazingly complex and tasty beer worthy of it's reputation. I only wish that it was more full-bodied. Thank heavens I picked up a 4-pack!"
"Mouthfeel tingles the tongue and yet maintains its smoothness. I'd once said I couldn't drink this all night but I'd love to try. Screw that. I'd totally drink this until I fell over. Love it, love it, love it."
"Got this one on-tap into the snifter. Actually had a friend order it who couldn't end up handling it, so I gave it a shot. Color is reddish-brown with a fairly small to medium amount of white head; looks alright, but nothing to write home about. Smell is biting, lots of cherries and grapes. Taste is remarkably strange; I've never anything remotely like it. It's mostly acidic; lots of sourness that really knocks you on your ass. There's also a good amount of cherry and grape, but not much in the way of hops. Other flavors in there as well (which other reviews hint might be oak). Again, body is medium overall, with fairly high carbonation (maybe a touch too high for me). It's a pretty good beer, and extremely unique; it's just not something I'd go out of my way to drink that often. So not bad, but not necessarily fantastic either."
"I didn't find this Flanders Red very appealing. The astringent finish was the major turn-off for me. Perhaps I should have paired it with a lemon-garnished dish as they suggest, because it wasn't that enjoyable by itself..."
"Overall, the first few sips were not enjoyable but it defnitely grew on me the more I drank. Too bad I didn't have more. Beautiful to look at and the taste is an aquired one. Good for sipping. Very interesting."
"Body is extremely light and fizzy, normally this would be a bad attribute but it goes wonderfully with the flavors in this beer. A great example of one of my favorite and most esoteric types of beer."
"i guess i'm not much of a fan of this beer, i dont like the acid zing, and the body is a little to light for the aroma."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Brand flute glass. Pours a deep dark amber with a generous inch of off white, fluffy head. Aromas of sour cherries are most apparent followed by spicy yeast. Tastes of tart and sour dried fruits such as plum, prune, and cherry. The sourness lasts through the dry finish and then some. medium body and moderate carbonation. I did not think I would like this after my first few sips, but as I made my way to the bottom of the bottle, it sure did grow on me. Very well made."
"Pours a dark ruby-amber color with a tall foamy light tan head that settles into a heavy lace. Nose is sour cherries and vinous vanilla oak along with a bit of a berry sweetnessvery nice. Taste begins with a sharp cherry tartness that makes your mouth pucker for a second before immediately craving more. A tangy black cherry and dark plum sourness follows along with a nice balance of cherry and apple sweetness. There are also some woody oak flavors along with notes of vanilla and grape skin tannins. Very complex and thoroughly enjoyable."
"Drinkability: RThis is a fruity and complex beer that is very crisp and refreshing to drink. I have another one aging now."
"Still a refreshing sweet tart beer, but even with the acidity this feels like a far cleaner and simpler beer than the older crazier more variable brews. Absolutely worth it, just a bit faded"
"Very crisp and has a dry, almost tanniny finish, which is probably from the oak. Tart cherry comes through, as well as other dark fruits and some of the oak as well. Medium mouthfeel, with a nice sharp bite throughout. Despite the bite, surpisingly smooth. Although I didn't do this, I would recommend eating with some cheese, as it can get a bit sweet. I'm not a huge fan of sour beers, but this was really great and would be great to sip in the summer."
"I can finish a 750 in a sitting, but it's definitely one to pair with food (and share). The label recommends pairing with seafood or dishes with lemon garnish."
"Overall, this is a pretty amazing beer. I have seldom been a fan of sour beers, but the balance of sweetness and subtle bitterness all mesh perfectly. The smell was strong, teasing and enchanting; I spent the first 15 minutes basking in its redolence."
"The drinkability of this beer requires the mood for it. Maybe a good beer for those who haven't crossed over from wine to beer yet. There is no need for more than one of these, but it is an excellent sipper and a real treat."
"The taste is predominantly malty with plummy and grapey fruitiness in the middle, but a sour/tangy backbone, lingering finish. Intense stuff, for sipping and contemplating."
"Dark brown tint with a amber hue with a slight head of white foam. Sour vinegar sweet with a weird alcohol punch and large citrus bloom. The taste while complex is way too acidic in the finish. The favor of oak is present but the citris owns this beer and the heartburn is already starting. The malt comes through and the sourness would be pleasent but the vinegar note is sending this sideways. Maybe it might have been better colder but I thought cellar temps would be best. I finally polished off the 750 solo as the wife ran for the door at the first sip even though she usually like the sour beers."
"This would be a wonderful accompaniment to a vinegary, acidic dish."
"I have had Flanders Reds before, but never anything this aggressive."
"D: Without doing a side-by-side tasting of this and the regular Rodenbach, I cannot for the life of me explain what the difference is (I know what the brewing/aging differences are, but the *tastes* aren't appreciably different to me). I enjoy both. Regardless, the Grand Cru is a complex, fruity, crisp, refreshing, comforting and tasty beer."
"I tried this on-tap at the Speckled Hen Pub in Reading, PA. When I ordered it, I was warned by the bar keep that it was a real ""love-it-or-hate-it"" beer. It had a powerful, sour aroma more fitting to a dry cider than a beer. The mouthfeel was dry as well. In the glass, it looked like a kind of murky brew, as reddish-brown colored as the mahogany decor of the bar. It was much lighter on the tongue than its appearance and aroma would have suggested but had a very full complex taste full of fruity tastes and a pleasant, lingering aftertaste."
"Very drinkable, extremely refreshing and different."
"Overall an interesting beer. Personally I don't like blue cheese, and there is a lot of that characteristic here. I would definitely reccomend this to someone who does enjoy it however. Glad I tried it. May need to drink more of the style in the future."
"Dark brown with a red tinge when held to the light. It produced a good sized lasting head. The smell is an unusual mixture of chocolate and cherries against a vinegary sourness. The taste is very tart, pretty challenging, with some funky characteristics emerging as well on the mid palate that remind me of blue cheese. Mouthfeel is watery with little carbonation. Finishes very sour as well, with a lasting drying of the throat! I found this a struggle personally, much more so than other sour styles: definitely an acquired taste. I can see it benefiting from pairing with food."
"D: This is one of the best beers ever and we've bought it many times. But how can a beer that scrapes the skin off of the back of your throat score a 5?"
"Taste begins with the tartness, followed by cherries and oak. Sourness lingers after the other flavors disappear. Just a great balance of sweet and sour. I've been on a real sour kick lately and this was a real pleasure. A honor to try such a tasty and well respected beer. Worth the hype."
"11.2oz bottle - color of rust brown small whitish head short in duration - nose of sour dark cherries , malt , cinnamon , molasses , milk chocolate , and plum  taste of sour dark cherries , plum , and earthy / woody notes perfect balance of tart and sweet  body is light acidic / sweet  aftertaste plum sweetness and sour / tart of cherries"
"Pours a light cherry with a great carbonated, creamy white head. Smell is mainly cherries with a ""barnyard"" musky undertone. Taste is sour, sour, sour! Overpowereing in a way..very little hops and malts noted.Mouthfeel was light, but with a definite astringent quality. On a drinkability scale, this takes some getting used to...the sourness is there throughout. Perhaps when paired with the proper cheese, I might rate it higher."
"210907 1017; not quite sure what to make of the dating system, but I've had this bottle for about 3 months. Very interesting beer, almost no detectable sweetness. Intense sour ale characteristics, such as sourness, vinegar, pepper, metal, oak. It reminds me very much of Jamaican roots drinks. Spicy carbonation. Medium dryness. Very enjoyable overall, but not for the faint of heart or the uninitiated. Pair with a musty cheese. Cheers!"
"Overall- A sour/tart beer that was hard to NOT sip. Very tart but very tasty! Try it, you'll like it!"
"Better balanced than the Classic. The sourness is a little less angular."
"The sweetness and sourness will keep me from drinking a whole bottle in an evening. The alcohol is not noticeable at all. It went well with the grilled steak that I had for dinner. It also amazed a wine snob who was at my house. This is my first Flanders Red and I was very impressed and definitely will visit this brew again."
"D: It take some getting used to, but this is quite enjoyable. Not a beer that I'll drink a lot of, but definitely one I'd drink again."
"Drinkability: Yum. This is exceptionally flavorful, interesting, and drinkable, especially at only 6% ABV. A great match for goat cheese and fairly good with medium cheddar."
"When we first opened this one it had a strong vinegar aroma and flavor. This was beyond sour and unpleasant. However, after it warmed up, the vinegar subisided substantially allowng the fruity tones and sourness to come through. This beer has a hazy amber hue with a fizzy head that forms nicely and then snap, crackle, pops away. The aroma is predominantly sour with cherry and other fruits. The mouthfeel is puckering, quite lively and dries the mouth. the carbonation is high and it has a little body. Good Sour! Let it warm before you dive in."
"Pours a light brown with a red delicious apple hue. Big white head and nice lacing. strong sour smell immediately overwhelms the room. Wonderful sour tartness is the dominant taste, but it is well rounded with cherry/apple sweetness. Lingering flavors. Perfect amount of carbonation to mesh with the tartness. Strong wood/barrel aged sensation. Highly drinkable."
"Overall, the leading Flanders Red available in the US."
"Taste is brandy, sour apples, grapes, and even some watermelon. Very spritzy and lemony when colder, and highly carbonated like a champagne. Creamy mouthfeel, which was actually a little weird in this style of beer. Hoppy, cherry-like aftertaste, with a little bit of Coca Cola or something. Not as sour as I remember from the first time I had it, which is a good thing."
"D- a very interesting beer, this is my first time trying this style and I am impressed, I bought it because this is one of the few belgian styles that I had not tried yet, I'm glad I decided to buy it. A very good beer, not something to drink often, but every now and then something to enjoy, I want to try this beer with a food, see what it pairs with"
"Mouthfeel is bitter smooth and puckering and screaming drink me. Damn good drinkable beer.MMM"
"I find the drinkablity rather low, though I am quite enjoying it. The amount of tartness and sugar overwhelms my palate a bit. I think I might appreciate it in small doses, as a desert wine, but not at 750ml a shot. But in small doses it is wonderfully complex and dense and highly satisfying."
"Clear red-tinged brown colour. Medium sized head. Aroma of sour cherries, oak, oxidised wine, complex fruit and sweet, rich malt. Flavour is sour, vinegary, winey with suggestions of fruit (orange, citrus, passionfruit, raspberries). It's rich, malty and has some sweetness - like sour lollies. It's also irony and there's a slight burn of acidity. Lingering aftertaste. The mouthfeel is prickly, medium bodied and astringent. Wonderful sour beer. Very well balanced and drinkable."
"Pours dark rusty red from the 750ml bottle with a large sticky tan head that subdues to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The smell alone warns of what lies below; mostly vinegar on the nose (evoking thoughts of ketchup and soy sauce), but with hints of fermented fruit and yeast. Upon tasting, the vinegar aroma reveals itself as an intriguing blend dominated by sour cherries up front and tart green apples with a lemon citrus dryness at the finish, all wrapped up neatly with a bit of oak. Sweetish, very full-flavored and lively, but well balanced as it finishes quite cleanly. Certainly not a taste for everyone, but an outstanding example of the style."
"D: I can see this being hard for some, but for me, this stuff is great, refreshing, and I plan on getting some more. A bit harsher than the classic, but a great beer."
"Notes: Rodenbach Grand Cru has been redeemed! This sample wasn't even close to as sour as the first bottle I tried last May. It was harsh, carbonated vinegar. This bottle was a fantastic, flavorful, tart, refreshing beer, and I can't wait to have more!"
"This is a tasty sipper for sure with some great dynamics Id never before encountered in the style. I shared this with some friends whilst watching Gremlins and BA Doolar woke his girlfriend up to try some. Upon sipping she exclaimed, Why would you do that to me?! I guess this isnt for everyone. More for me!"
"Overall: I suppose one mans Flanders Red Ale is anothers cherry lambic, though of course the Flanders doesnt have any actual cherries in it. That fact seems academic, and I would say that Rodenbach Grand Cru is a great lambic style- brew, if you like that sort of thing."
"i've had this beer a few times now, and it gets better every time. seek this out and alter your definition of beer forever."
"Not very drinkable to me. This beer might be right for someone really into lambics or lactobacillus flavors but it's not for me."
"Deep brown cherry colored with a tall fizzy brilliant white head. Head reduces, lacing moderate, good signs of carbonation. Smell is strong on oak and sour cherries. In fact that was it for awhile but then some yeasty raw flavors came out and were really unique with their wildness yet restraint. Taste begins sweeter than I thought. Braeburn apples dipped in caramel. Sourness ensues. Sweeter woody flavors under but don't come completely through. Yeast funk rises instead. Sourness stays. Tart fresh picked unwashed cherries. Apple cider vinegar. Purely acidic finish. Wait, a touch of earth too. Mouthfeel is prickly from the carbonation and that's how it should be. Man this is enjoyable. Complex, easy to drink, flavorful, balanced enough. Me likey!"
"Medium bodied and easily drinkable with a 6% abv. Carbonation seems a touch foamy."
"The drinkability is a little bit lower because this is such an intense flavor. I highly recommend trying it if you have an experienced palate. Not for the faint of heart."
"Overall Impression: Easy drinking, which is a bit dangerous. The sour is firm, but it has enough base to keep the drinkability high. Enjoyed this in the Poperinge city square at Café de la Paix."
"This one pops in the mouth! Even more tart than the original with intense cherry/raspberry overtones that send your salivary glands into high gear. This beer doesn't ask for respect, it demands it. I'm almost forced to chew on this one, as the juices released in my mouth congeal a bit. Some subtle oak nuances are apparent, though I don't know if this is worth the few extra dollars over the regular."
"Notes: quite the tart and sour little treasure. Hops don't really make a presence and aren't necessary. One that I will pursue and purchase whenever possible and a worthy brew just short of greatness in the end."
" I still continue to find it impossible to grasp what it is that turns beer enthusiasts on when consuming the Rodenbach line, as there is nothing hedonistic about it. Lacking true Flanders red authenticity; and as much as I try to convince myself that this is an enjoyable product; ingestion is a definite struggle."
"The mouthfeel is right for the style but boy is it overpowering. Drinkability for me is on par or average. Because of the sourness I just can't see this as one that I'd make a session beer out of. I'm glad I tried it though as it's a very interesting style that I had trepidations about even drinking... Alas, nothing ventured nothing gained. I will definitely try others of the style"
"Pours a cool dark red color with a small tannish white head. Smell was extremely sour, very jolly rancherish. Also some cherries and a noticeable vinnegar smell towards the back. Taste was a bit better, with the sour flavors and fruit melding together. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied. This beer was simply too sour for me, and way too acidic for me to handle. Maybe it is just the style. Im not sure...this was my first example of the style. cheers"
"Nice muddy brown color but has a brightness to it. Some good red hues running thru it. Big head that dies right away. Good aroma-sour cherries and a trace of oak. Sour smelling. Incredible flavor-perfect blend of sourness and fruit. Just a hint of oakiness. The sourness is just right and balanced with a nice sweet finish. Nice fruit in the backround. Good mouthfeel-very full though quite refreshing and light at the same time. Very, very drinkable and enjoyable. I will be buying this again and again."
"High carbonation and thin mouthfeel. Kind of tough to drink through the tartness. But overall its above average."
"initial apple and raisin sweetness, then an overpowering lemon, cherry and grape sourness with a strong note of balsamic vinegar in the finish. fairly light feel and carbonation. unsparingly strong in its flavors, but the combination and finish are slightly off-putting."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, darn tasty and quaffable. Still, I think I might prefer the Classic over this creation. Hard to say, but I know I'm looking forward to having the GC again."
"After spending $10 for a bottle, I certainly wasn't going to pour this down the drain, but I did think about it. I forced myself to drink every last drop of this god-awful beer. I award it no points for being unique. Just a terribly unappetizing beer."
"D: One of the best beers in the world. My favorite Flanders."
"Thanks to Bjohnson for this bottle. For whatever reason,someone has deemed it necessary that this brew cannot be stocked in the Midwest. Well of course this is all about the sourness aroma was sour cherry, sour plum sour raisin,sour grape at times almost vinegary, amber brown color, the taste, jeez, pure sour and acidic fruit, definite taste of having sat in a barrel, the burps are burning my nose, but its wonderful. Becomes almost to astringent as it warms,but taken in small amounts while its cold, a fantastic late afternoon summer sipper"
"ABV not very high in this ale at (6%) its a little low. I would have expected a higher ABV. Still an excellent brew though."
"This Grand Cru poured a cloudy, light coffee-brown color with creamy, tan foam that settled but clung to the glass in places. The smell was sour and tart with aromas of dried fruit: prunes, currants, and faint cherries. The taste was lightly sour with the flavor of dried fruit, including prunes, and with a lightly malty undertone beneath the tartness. Very nice flavor. The mouthfeel was sharp, crisp, and tart, with medium body and strong carbonation feel. The flavors lingered briefly on the palate before they were gone. This was a very nice beer, though it did not seem greatly different than the ""regular"" Rodenbach. Nicely drinkable and thirst quenching."
"Body is medium, sticky, and has a soft, prickly mouthfeel. Each sip leaves you drooling for the next. Good stuff."
"Very pretty scarlet red, absolutely clear, with an off white head. Smell was both sweet and sour- vinegar and soy sauce, mostly. Sour fruits, perhaps. Taste left me conflicted, I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. Balsamic and regular vinegar with some berries added. Salad dressing came to mind. After much thought, I think this reminds me of a vinegary arbor mist. I'm still unsure if that's good or bad though. Mouthfeel was fizzy, like a champagne, perhaps. Weird beer, probably spot on for the style, but I don't know, I'm not sold on it."
"Nice puckery mouth that works very well with the carbonation. The interesting character of this beer adds to its good drinkablity."
"Still, all in all, this one's one of my favorites."
"Having said all of that ruminescent, romantic b.s., this is still a damn good beer. I am a sucker for these beers and this is still quite good. I can see this beer aging quite gracefully for some time. The acidity should round out a bit and a touch of oxidation should play up the rich malt character a bit more. In the end that is what this needs a bit more complexity to balance out the great sour character."
"Ran across this at the store and figured I would give it a try. I have never had a beer of this style so I did not know what I was getting into when I first bought this bottle. Pours out of it's 750mL bottle deep red in appearance with a sharp sour fruity smell, almost vinegar like. The taste sour but surprisingly pleasant. As the bottle warms up a bit, you can pick up some oak in the taste as well. Delicious! This was a pleasant surprise and is easily one of my favorite beers. It is not one that you can drink all night, but it sure is a unique beer that is a nice change in style every once in a while."
"D - The only bottle I had dissapeared fast, although I'm not sure how many more I'd want. A tasty and interesting beer nonetheless."
"900"
"Drinkability  This is a very intense FRA that begs to be shared."
"This green bomber was adorned with a silk-screened label, dull gold neck foil, wire cage, and cork, all combining to give the appearance of a package meant for a special occasion. The beer came out deep amber red in color, and had a slightly hazy appearance. The persistent head was one finger thick and the carbonation was light. The aroma of sour cherries and oak combined to form a wood glue like smell, which was quite mouthwatering (and no I dont usually sniff glue). The taste was balsamic vinegar sour and somewhat spicy as well. Both of these tastes made for a very dry beer that demanded to be gently sipped and be paired with some food, so I pulled out some Irish cheddar cheese from the refrigerator to accompany it. The earthy sharp cheese cut out the peppery spiciness, but the sour flavor became even more accentuated. The oak aged notes were never quite detectable under the evident acidity. I found this to be quite drinkable, despite being very different than the hop bombs I always seem gravitate towards. The mouthfeel was naturally dry and the body was on the thin side due to a near absence of residual sugar. Not one I would order very often, although that being a deficiency in my character rather than that of this beer."
"A truely fine example of a unqiue style of beer. The Rodenbach Grand Cru pours from the bottle a dark brown-red color, witha beautiful off-white foamy head. The smell is nicely sour (imagine apple vinegar). The taste is tart, as it should be. The mouthfeel is dynamic with sour flowing up to the palate, and then lingering on the tongue. A very nice brew. This fine brew should be searched out and enjoyed for it's wonderful uniqueness. It will be different than any thing you have probably had before so give it a chance,"
"This seems pretty spot on for the style though my experience with it is limited. Certainly not for everyone; it's pretty much a love it or hate it flavor profile."
"This is a very nice Flanders Red Ale."
"Holey Christ what a beer. I have had this in bottles recently and on tap but never cask conditioned. This was served at the Monk's Cafe Michael Jackson dinner this past Sunday and it was fantastic on cask. They said that this is the first cask conditioned keg of this fine beer to leave Belgium. The beer was poured into a wine glass from a pitcher and poured a bright but deep burgundy color with a slight tan head. The has a good sour nose to it and a bit of funk but slightly mellow. The taste was a wonderfully sour cherry delight but not overally sour that heartburt sets in. This taste was a bit more muted than the bottle or keg very and it my favorite of the 3. This was the last beer of the night and probably my second favorite overall, if not my favorite. With the taste a bit more mellow but still very strong, I found this beer to be very drinkable and was pleased to get a few refills before the night was over."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" light tan head above the somewhat clear burgundy brew. Head quickly fades down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with ample delicate lacing. Aroma is piecing sour musty funk. Cool. Taste is slightly chalky cherry tartness, which fades on through to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both nice for the style as well. A standard to which others should aspire and hope to supercede."
"An interesting taste, but it's just too damn sweet. It's dark, syrupy, acidic and very sweet. Too heavy to be really drinkable, and a flat, or possibly 2-diamensional taste."
"This beer is, at least by my experience, completely unique. Certainly worth seeking out."
"I think this is one of the best examples of a Flanders Red I've had to date. I love ""the duchesse", but I could drink more than one of these."
"overall i find the character of this beer in this size bottle more pronounced than smalls. the sourness almost puckers the mouth, the oaken notes are very strong both in taste and aftertaste, and I think I will never buy the 330ml again if this is available."
"Tantalizing style, but it may be a while before I try the other bottle. this is definitely a beer you need to be ready for."
"Slightly dirty ruby red body (has that aged in a barrel for a while look). Dense, small off-cream head. Musty sour compost fruit. An almost tart cherry fruitiness detectable along with mild medicinal spirits and vinegar. Starts sweet and almost fruity (like overripe cherries or grapes). This is followed by musty cedar/oak, a touch of vanilla, and a whiff of alcohol. However, sour acidity erases all this with a Pop-rock fizz on the tongue. Tart cherries and vinegar somehow mix as the sourness climaxes into the finish. Not puckeringly sour, but refreshingly sour, especially after the sweetness early on. I was prepared to not really like this beer much, but now I cant stop drinking it. Strange and delicious. Very lively, with champagne like fizz on the tongue that works wonders with the sweet/sour balance. Might not be able to drink pitchers of it, but better than expected!"
"I can possibly, maybe, see this beer paired with food and improving, but... it's a stretch. I'm actually a bit curious to sample this again (in the distant future) and see if I enjoy it the second time around. I actually wouldn't rule out the possibility that we got a bad bottle, but as it stands, this is the least drinkable beer I've ever had.. That said, it's certainly different."
"Perhaps this could be excellent with the proper food pairing, and served in a smaller vessel (I'm working on 2/3 of a 750 at this point). Lots of extra points for rather rare flavors to encounter in a beer. Overall this is a great beer that I can appreciate but not, perhaps, love."
"D: I cant drink much of this b/c sour really isnt my thing but I would drink it again just as something different. Not really my type of a beer."
"Drinkability: Truly a very unique beer that people should try for themselves. Next time I buy this, I going to get this in the big 750 size. The 11.2oz bottle is too small. A great beer!"
"Sour cherry taste with oak and vanilla. High carbonation. Refreshing but not super high carbonation due to the sourness. A very unique and tasty beer. Truely amazing since there is no fruit added to this beer."
"Aroma is sweet white fruits and balsamic vinegar. Amber/brown color with a smallish and mostly diminishing head. Fore is balsamic vinegar and tart cherries. Flavor range is narrow highlighting the vinegar and fruits and carries through to the dry acidic finish."
"Drinkability - I liked it less at first and more as I progressed. Generally, this isn't a beer I'd revisit, but it's not bad, just not for me."
"This is my first review of a Belgian Red Ale but here goes...pours with a light head and good lacing. The color is a dark, reddish amber that is fairly uniform. The ale smells of sour fruits and wine with a slight nutty hint. It smells amazing! The taste is where this ale declines in my opinion...sour grapes and cranberries are the primary flavor while the tartness tends to take away from this red ale for me. A little more sweetness to balance out the tartness could help. This ale is however very fruity in taste (however sour) and the acidic mouthfeel is somewhat unpleasent as well. Not something one could drink consistently I wouldn't think."
"mouthfeel probably could us 6 months to mellow and have the flavors blend, almost unripe, still easy drinking for a sour ale."
"This brew is certainly an aquired taste. Unusual and complex. This brew is good for a change of pace."
"Updated on 01/23/12 with a vintage bottle from the celler, I think from 2005."
"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a very sour scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts along with a yeast sour aroma; very enticing. The taste is great. It has a refreshingly sour taste that is solid on the malts and easy drinking. It boasts Belgian crystal and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good brew. It is quite refreshing. It has great malt character and an excellent yeast sourness."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, with a foil enclosure to boot. Best before date stamped on the bottle of the bottle. (There's a good place to put vital info...) Pours an interesting chestnut shade of amber, with a slight dark cherry hue. Well developed lacing emerges from a light tan puffy head, which exhibited moderate retention. Nose also, I would characterize as interesting, sweet, nutty and fruity. This brew is a classic of the style, sour, sweet,smoky,acidic, complex. Not for everybody, this style takes awhile for most to warm up to and appreciate. It goes well with food, particularily ""fish with lemon"" as noted on the label. Tasty, mysterious, interesting and thirst quenching. Get some, taste it, taste it again, come to love it"
"Dark reddish-amber color with a medium thick eggshell white head that lasts fairly long. Thick sheets of lacing. Aroma of sour cherry and grape, with a touch of sweet malt too. Medium-bodied and super tart and vinous and first, but smoother as it warms. Sour fruit is the name of the game here, with cherry and apple being dominant. Some light spices and malts are there as well. The finish is dry and fruity. Admittedly I usually struggle with this style but this is a complex and well-crafted beer."
"Drinkability: The acidity seems too much at first, but the bottle was gone before I knew it. Fantastic beer, maybe not for everyone (do you like sour beer?), but I think that's just the nature of the style."
"No doubt this is an acquired taste. I, for one, couldnt keep my nose out of the glass. What an aroma!!! Funky, fruity, sweetyeast, vinegar, spicemagic marker, sugar, oak, vanilla, cherries, sour-candies.you cant count all the smells. The taste is equally thrilling.sour and mouth puckering one minute, sweet and succulent the next. I enjoy this style by taking long, deep sniffs, followed by small, slow sips. I swear that you can experience something different each time. This brew is a little sweeter than expected, and very earthy. At times it seems to have a musty, woods-like quality about it. The tart, acidity is refreshing and really clears the pallet for another sip. The liquid is a deep brownish red, with a respectable head. Theres a lot of carbonation, and a medium body. Lingering, funky finish. Very easy to drink."
"Think I could use a smoke right about now..."
"Mother pucker! That one's taaaart. Right out of the aromas, barnyardy, vineous, and muskiness makes the mouth water and the eye twitch. Looks burgundy in color with a lightly creamy off-white head that fleeted quickly. Flavors of cider, cherries, and tart berries accompany the intense tartness. Though malt sweetness offers a nice mellowness, it never balances the beer correctly. It could have more sweetness. Alcoholic and lightly astringent in the mouth feel. A woodsy flavor persists in the aftertaste. I like it, but it makes my teeth hurt. Good for all Flander's lovers! Thanks SheepNuts"
"Overall: It's a good beer, but save it for special occasions. Would be good with a nice meal."
"The smell is of wine. No question about it. Maybe some hidden caramel in there too. The taste will take you if you are not prepared. It tastes like wine as well. A very distinct flavor af soured grapes. The mouthfeel is active. The carbonation comes alive. The drinkability is affected by the alcohol. If the alcohol was not so up front this would be a much better beer. I could not drink this much but it would be ok time to time."
"Drinkablilty - Very bracingly refreshing. A welcome treat when you have a thirst to slake. I found that the sourness while delightful at first becomes overwhelming at length."
"This was a 750 ml bottle that I saved for a few months for a special night. ""Best before"" date is stamped on the bottom of the bottle, but it's a bit hard to make out."
"M&Dr - had a wine like mouthfeel to it with carbonation befitting the style. Good sipping brew."
"Would like to do a side by side tasting with Rodenbach Classic, Duchess, Monks and La Folie."
"Drinkability: While the flavors meld and transition nicely, I don't see this as an ale meant for pounding. It is, however, nice for sipping, especially as it warms."
"Translucent ruby brown, tiny bubbled head, persistant ring and some lacing. Gobs of carbonation. The smell has a little aspirinish odor connoting a sour taste is coming. There is also a malty aroma, albeit twisted by the sourness. Tart starts it all off, but never puckering. The malt base washes through in the middle. Balance is not bad at all. Mouthfeel is thin to medium with a light body and carbonic finish. There are lots of bubbles in this one, plenty of sour burps. Not overpowering, actually pleasant for a Flanders and paired very well with grilled porkchops. Spouse really liked it, too, a first for a sour brew."
"From the sour start to the sweet center to the funky finish, it's a series of interesting personalities. It's a cider that's a wine that's a fine Flemish sour red. Granted, it's not for every taste, but if it is for yours, it would be easy to crave. It all comes together with a workable ABV to start and remain drinkable to the bottom of the bottle. It's the fun sassy taste of Belgium in a glass."
"750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Pours slightly cloudy, light ruby color. Thin off-white heawine like in the nose. Smells like port, slightly smoky, and some alcohol. What hits in the flavor off the bat is the sharp acidity. Very tart, fruity and sour. Hints of oak in the finish, but subtle. Medium body, with a good amount of carbonation. This is certainly one to savor. Some will be turned off by the sourness, but certainly a beer that you should try at least once to appreciate the differences."
"This bottle can't be very old as I don't believe they have been importing this for long. Cool silkscreened label."
"Red in color, very little head but creamy, with beautiful lacing. Smells pretty straightforwardly of sourness, like vinegar. I love the smell but know that many people would turn away. Mouth-puckering sourness with a superdry finish. Very acidic and dry. Boy that's good, and a great apertif. In my opinion, the most sour of the sour Flemish beers."
"Less evenly balanced, less sweet, more wood-toned than the classic variant. Very pleasing for lovers of the style, however."
"at the front a brief cherry sweetness that quickly gives way to a consuming sourness"
"750 ml corked bottle. The beer pours out a dark red color with a small head. Aroma of wood, vinegar, and funk. Flavor starts off sweet and sour, with some cherry flavor. Not overly sweet. There's a bit of a strange metal taste in the finish. This beer is pretty tart, but not cheek puckering. Medium bodied with a spritzy carbonation. Good drinkability. I never had the old version, but I liked this one a lot."
"Drinkability- One of the better Flanders for sure. Super easy to drink. Great sweet and sour combo."
"Mouthfeel is sugary, sour, and lingering with some lip smacking goodness."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't want this all the time but it was quite tasty. Everyone should try it once."
"From notes. Pours a deep deep ruby-hued amber color with a 2 finger head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was sweet and sour cherry, but not overbearing. Very clean and slightly crisp. Incredibly enjoyable. Right on where I expect things. Flavor was as good as the nose promised. Light sour cherry, creamy oak notes with moderate sourness. Just incredible. The beer left just a touch of sticky spit. It was moderate with a light carbonation. Overall, this was an incredible brew. Right what I want from the style. Incredible balance. Loved this beer."
"Drinkability: Wish it was bottled in a smaller bottle; while I enjoy the style for a change of pace, it is not something I can consume in quantity"
"25.4oz bottle. New version. This one pours a dark red color with a tall head that falls moderately and leaves some lacing on the glass. Very attractive. The aroma is full of cherry notes with sourness lingering in the back. Slight funkiness as well. The flavor is very much the same - very tasty - great mixture of the sour and the cherries. Extremely smooth. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good."
"Drinkability is good very tasty would enjoy more little pricey in TN 4.30 for the 33cl but already craving another."
"wish i could give this more for drinkability, but i couldnt see having too many of these in one night. however, with two flanders reds under my belt, i can say i have discovered a style i can definitely enjoy on occassion. very satisfying."
"Poured into my tulip glass a deep burgundy with a large blooming head,sour cherry to be expected dominate the aromas with a touch of iron and barnyard as well.This stuff can make you pucker sour cherry hits hard on the tastebuds but rounds nicely into a more sweet cherry-pie like flavor in the finish.It has an almost creamy mouthfeel to it as I drink more the more it grows on me once your palate gets used to the sour tinge this stuff goes down very easily,glad to try this classic."
"Draught: I didnt expect the aroma of this: It was a lot like a fine red wine. There were some notes of sour cherries in there, as well as some sweet malts. A dark reddish-brown/amber color. There was a bit of an off-white head with some lacing. Deliciously sour taste of cranberries/apples. Excellent!!!"
"This is some complex stuff. Redish brown in colour. Not much of a head, but a fair amount of carbonation. The aroma falls somewhere between sour cherries and cranberries, with a hint of red wine vinegar. The taste is quite similar to the smell, with some malt and cola notes mixed in as well. The palate was surprisingly light and fizzy, which made this beer quite refreshing. Overall, this isn't the type of beer that I could drink ALL of the time, but it's still fantastic."
"Pours a beautiful reddish brown, pretty clear, with a big off white head that laces. Smell is sweet with a very sour cherry type aroma. Taste is all sour cherries, cranberry juice in the middle, then a very dry tart finish. Very strong sour aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel, nice and thick, low carbonation. Excellent ale."
"The Rodenbach beers are of the highest caliber, and this is their finest. It's refreshing and exciting!"
"33 cl bottle. Best before 19/11/05. Thought I had rated it earlier, guess not. Purchased in Vienna, VA at either Norm's or Whole Foods. Label is in Dutch."
"A beer with a very clean finish, though not the most drinkable. The aroma is very welcoming, suggestive of a dry sour cherry like flavour. A complex flavour indeed. The flavour starts with an intense vinegar sourness, followed by hints of dry hops aftertaste. The aged oak taste is quite addictive and very much defines the character of this beer. Maybe I will try this one again with fish and chips for just an experiment."
"Samples were available for all who showed up at Eulogy for the Philly Crawl on Friday. I know that I'm a slacker. Where are the rest of the reviews. I can't wait for wider availability..."
"Bottle. Light brown and clear in color with a nice fluffy tan head. Candi sugar aroma. Sour tasting. Very tart cherry like . Tart cherries in the nose. Flavor is malty and sweet. Well balanced beer. Some oak in the finish. Finish is refreshing and tart. Drinkable and enjoyable."
"Bottle. Err...wow! Poured deep garnet with a reasonable head. Aroma just blew me away. Huge, sour acetic, lactic, medicinal (acetone almost) and funky. Taste was as per the aroma, reminded me of linctus phocodeine (cough medicine) that I used to take when I was a kid but with a little more funk and sophistication. What an amazing beer!"
"really enjoyed it. didn't expect it to be as sour as it was, but loved it. couldn't drink em all night, but fantastic with food or after dinner."
"Thanks to my good pal Evan for sharing this treat after fifty begs and a firstborn."
"I usually don't like sour beers, but I figured I'd give this a try as it was being reintroduced to the US and the brewer was in my friend's bar (Sean Bolans) at the time. Poured on tap into a Rodenbach stemmed glass. Sorta a redish dark ruby color. Initial smell is of sour cherries. Taste really surprised me. Not nearly as tart as the bottled version I had. Lots of sour cherries, lemon zest, and a bit of an acidic tartness. Aftertaste of the cherries lingers somewhat unpleasantly in your mouth, although others may like this. Not nearly as badly as the bottled version in my opinion. Couldn't drink more than one or two of these in a row though. I cleansed my pallate with a Dominion Real Ale afterwards :) Will never be my favorite beer, but then again I don't really like the style. Others seem to love this beer so by all means check it out."
"Michael at the Eulogy Bar was kind enough to let us sample this rare beer at his bar. Poured into an authentic Rodenbach stemmed glass, this beer looked fabulous from the start  Glowing bright amber in appearance and topped with a thin lacy head of foam. The aroma is exceptional and very misleading. Like a lamb in wolfs clothing! After the first whiff, you would think that this was going to be a very heavy beer with a big body. Freshly tapped maple syrup was the initial aroma, then came oak, vanilla and finished with tart bing cherries. The beer is truly revealed after the first sip. Light and almost airy, with a perfect sourness. The finish is crisp, clean and leaves a lemon zestfulness on the tongue. A real beauty of a beer."
"E"
"Reviewed from a 33cl bottle with a date on the back of 01/03/06. Appearance is of a cherry wood colored body with a light tan head on top. A bit bubbly in the glass this left a decent bit of lace. Aroma is quite rich with tart cherries and some sweet malt. Notes of woodiness also blend in quite well. The tartness had a bit of edge to it. Flavor starts off with tart fruits up front. The sourness is cut a bit by an underlying sweetness and woodiness. Not as balanced as the Red, but it works out better that way. A biting sourness with a hint of cherries is how this finishes. Mouthfeel is lively with carbonation and is very crisp and clean. Drinkability is exceptional. I should have got me some more of this when I had the chance. Very tasty and refreshing. This will definitely get me more into the style."
"Pours a deep red with a frothy light tan head which diminishes to a layer of bubbles on the surface. No lacing down the glass. Sour aroma, some fruits too. Strong sour flavour which lasts and lasts. Not too overpowering though. Nice, like lemonade. That's the closest thing I can match it to - lemonade, with some malt. A taste until what I've normally tried in a beer. I've only ever tried one gueuze before, and now this. Nice mouthfeel. This is an intriguing style. Tasty for certain, but I'm not sure how many I could drink. I do like the sour taste, but I'm not sure I could have many of them. Still, a nice enjoyable beer."
"I tried this beer with no preconceptions, although it was a Belgian Grand Cru. It may be my first Flanders Red Ale, but I've had quite a few oak aged beers in the past. I didn't like the taste. Too sour, very unique and lacking in a real beer feel. Tasted like Shiraz, in that it was dry and peppery, although it also had a watery consistency. Generally it was unpleasant, I don't think I'll be having another one, and I'll be noting my aversion to the style (not many beers of this style are available in Australia). A real disappointment."
"A multi coloured brew. Depending on how the light hits the glass, the colour changes. Sometimes, it's almost purple. Other times, cola black. Sometimes, red. Considering the colour it most appears to be is red, I'll say it's red. Sort of a cherry red. Quickly foams up, only to die down with no head. Glass is clean, so I know that's not the reason. Still, little whisps of lace stick to the glass. First smell is sour. Lot's of citrus, cherries, and some raw malt. First taste. Whoa, hits you unexpectedly. Sour at first, then finishes with some malt and vanilla sweetness. Second taste, the sweetness becomes a bit stronger, but the sourness does not weaken. Aftertaste is a bit strong of cherries. Not to my liking, but a minor setback. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and smooth. Pretty good beer. But for me, the cherry aftertaste is too strong."
"Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!"
"Truly remarkable"
"Overall, it's OK. I guess. Fans of lambics might like it, but I won't be rushing out to get more."
"I was looking forward to tasting this beer so when my friend got a hold of a bottle I was quite excited. The beer poured a cloudy brown with light read hues and no head on it. The aroma had a dry grape smell along with some sweetness. The flavor was just sour, sour, sour like a mean old woman. Also some flavors of cherry (kriek) and a bit of a yeasty flavor. But the cherry and the yeast flavors were getting the shit beaten out of them by the sourness, just like my palate. The beer was puckering in the mouth with a bit of a ferric character to it. Overall I was very disappointed in this beer. I had such high hopes but htey were dashed in a blaze of sourness. This beer was just too sour for my tastes. Thanks, but no thanks. Not my style."
"330mL brown bottle with best before date clearly printed on rear label."
"the finish is very light with a lingering tartness and wine flavors in the burp. QUite an experience, I really enjoy this style."
"The taste is a tart cranberry-chocolate malt (mostly cran), w/ soem oak wood flavors but not really dry (maybe like a Merlot Wine) w/ a mild aftertaste. The feel is a tart and bitey feel w/ tickling carbonation and a mild aftertaste. This was a ""new"" beer for me to try, so i was quite suprised and interested in this style now."
"Poured a dark brownish red, a pinkish white head and soapy lacing clinging to the glass. Nose was acidic, vinegar and like a dry red wine. Taste was quite something. The sourness shocked the tastebuds during the first few sips. But this diminishes as you drink, and some cherry flavour, some sweetness pokes through. Has qualities of a red wine. Mouthfeel was bubbly, finish was dry. But the tartness really limits the drinkability, at least for me anyway."
"Pours a dark red, effervescent, with a bubbly pinkish-white head, my friend commented that it looked really good (she like red things). Aroma of wild yeasts, winey, very good. Taste was tart, with a cherry/cranberry flavour right off, with some malts creeping in at the finish. The ingredients list corn, but I (thankfully) didn't taste any. This has a light bubbly mouthfeel, akin to wine. This was tart if not downright sour, but if you like sour (which I do) 'tis a grand Grand Cru."
"Drinkability: hey, it doesn't get much better than this. have it as an apertif, have it as a night cap. great range. great complexity. World Class!"
"Bottled..330ml crown top expirery date 06/06. Served at 48 deg.F in a thin stemmed tulip... it poured a brilliant ruby red-amber with a sticky off white cap that laces beautifully.Tiny bubbled ample effervescence. Aroma is a knock out!..concord grape, cherry tartness some herbal smells, acidic like dry cider. Taste? sure does!..glorious layers of berry like tarness, malty but herbal, some horse blanket... sweetness balances against sour cider tartness...what a ride! Finish is tart and dry like a strong cider. This is a remarkable brew...some will hate it some will love it (as I do) for its amazing flavor and refreshing fruity tartness. Recommended to those with no boundaries who want to experience one of the worlds most unique and well crafted ales...truely remarkable."
"I wish there were more commercial examples of this style available (in Canada). Its really incredibly."
"I was fortunate to sample this beauty complements of the famous Sam. Poured into my westmalle glass, apearance was a nice reddish brown with a small head forming at the top. First taste was a bit surprising and definatley pleasing. A bit sour but in a very good way, countered by a slight sweetness a la cherries. Although it may seem odd when describing a beer it truely was sweet and sour. The first swill coated my mouth and delighted my pallet as the sweet and sour played a beautiful symphony on my tongue. I know it sounds cheesy but if you have tried this beer you will know the rosy crap is from the heart. Every sip brought on a new appreciation for this beer. I was crying for more when finished and will definiatley have another go at this one. I had previously tried a ""sour"" tasting beer but didn't get it. After this beer I finally do. Those that have the privilige of trying this beer must do so at once."
"I can't believe this beer came into BC but dreams sometimes come true. The dark red colour is quite a sight in a nice chalice. The nose is sour, old and very different from any other beer including Duchesse de Bourgogne. The taste is oaky,aged , fruity and most importantly smooth. You can feel the time that this beer has spent in barrels gives a cellared taste that melds all the flavours into a fine blend. Not as intense as Duchesse or as earthy as Goudenband, this beer is truly a class act."
"Pours a dark ruby red with brownish highlights. Very small cap of head tops the beer. Smell is musty and vinegary. Smells of a German Cherry Vinegar i used once. Taste is similar, sour cherries, wine vinegar, pucker the cheeks. A note of horsey funkiness also creeps into the taste. Mouthfeel is nice, low carbonation. No real hops to speak of which probably wouldnt be to style any how. A nice beer with dinner or a salad. Definately not a session beer, but one that I would definately pick up again."
"This is not beer, it is red wine vinegar made with malt. Sour with an earthy base. Low carbination, medium body. Sweetness is present to balance the sour, but this is not chinese food, so I will pass on the sweet and sour combination. Smooth on the palate, the beer says nothing, if it does not say sour cherries."
"Absolutely a classic, and perfect for style. I could enjoy one of these any time of day, anywhere."
"Rerate: Drank it out of a proper glass this time, still a great beer! Original rating: 330 ml bottle, ABV 6%. Drank it out of a plastic ""glass"" (sacrilege, I know!) at cellar temperature. Cherry-like aroma with hints of cowshed and ensilage. Flavour is sour/acidic/red wine vinegar-like, with strong barnyard and ensilage elements (not that I normally eat ensilage, but still...). This was my first Flemish red ale, an exciting experience! It will not be my last beer of this style. (Okay, I know I wrote my rating of the Duchesse de Bourgogne a bit earlier today, but I actually drank the Rodenbach 4-5 days before the Duchesse)."
"Wow. Just one of those beers you remember like yesterday and informs every opinion of the Flemish Red style you've ever had. Gets the balance of sourness, fruitiness, sweet and cinnamon spice, and oak conditioning perfect for what the beer style requires. The bottle I enjoyed was past its ""best by"" date, and such aging was happily enjoyed. What an experience, who knows when and if I'll ever catch another one - only a trip to Belgium would make it possible."
"The taste was incredibly complex. It was tart and sour, somewhat fruity, and it very strongly tasted of red wine. There were oak notes hovering in the background. Truly a unique experience."
"Deliciously sour and tart. Dryness from the oak aging and lovely oak notes in the flavor. Mouth Puckering. Aged. More cherries and other dark fruits along with a few notes of lemon. Lingering. Everything I look for in the style."
"Mouth-puckering sour. Due to expire on my birthday, June 21, 2004, it had noticeable sediment from the oak barrel which prevented the last drops, and takes away from its georgeous red-brown colour with lacing. Cherry and tart real vanilla that works through the roof of the mouth before eating, Ranked up in fresher bottle sampled a year later. Had again 6.3 years later an just as good. As good in the style as can be."
"Drinkablity & Notes: A pretty exceptional brew, I have had better from this brewery in the past though this one still stands up to be a quality brew for sure."
"A legend in the realms of the flanders red. Some sweetness but generally overpowered and knocked into touch by a whack of acidic fresh fruit. The quintessential flanders red, sour, slightly sweet and fruity.... perfect"
"Bottle: Poured a reddish colored brew with a nice bubbly head with standard retention. Aroma is nice mix of oak and cherry with some acidic and tart note also noticeable. Taste is an extremely complex mix of oak, sour cherry (without the sweetness) and some tart and acidic notes also mix in there. The finish is quite bitter; carbonation is average and body is medium. Overall, this is a very complex beer that is also very refreshing. Now, if I can get my hand on some Alexander I would be a happy man."
"I'm also reminded of eating too many salt-and-vinegar chips at once...definite parallels."
"It pours a beautiful clear, dark mahogany with a head that dissipates fast. The first thing I noted in the aroma was wood. There is quite a bit of it and then the maltiness and a lactic sourness can be detected as well. It is very complex and elegant to drink. It is tart with some fruity cherry notes, there is some wood notes as well as some wine notes. The perfect marriage between sweet and sour with a somewhat dry lactic finish. The amazing beer is truly the standard for the style."
"Big off white head. The head is very sticky and lacing on the goblet. Lots pf carbonation (tiny bubbles) as well. Ruby color in the tulip shaped glass. Lively in the glass. The taste upfront is of sour black cherry with a thickish sweetness in the middle and a dry slightly bitter hop finish. Sour nose. Complex smooth mouth with a very dry tongued finish. Your tongue is left wanting more."
"Legendary. Pours a rubyish copper color with a generous beige hue. Small tuliped glass is recommended. Sour dark cherry notes and an intricate yeast profile as well as barrel aging is evident in the nose. Further dark fruit notes as well as the malt profile bordering on a chocolate-like profile. Lavish and extravagant. I'm not trying to hype the beer up at all, but this is the real deal. The right amount of sweetness balances out the lactic sourness of this beer. Complex; changes many times on the tongue with each sip. Really plays with you as it warms, I recommend the warmer end of the spectrum. Thoroughly enjoyable. Thanks go out to a friend whose parents live in Brussels and bring beers back from Belgium when coming back to the States. Quintessential; wish it was more widely available but I know the story."
"A totally opaque red-brwon color. The very fine head fades quickly but doesn't die. The smell is of vinegar. Sourness and tart, but with some fruity and sweet aspects. The taste is what the smell makes you expect. The tart and sour aspects are so strong that they're almost not unpleasing. I got an impression of baked cookies after a while (butter and eggs). The sourness fades as I got used to the brew. The mouthfeel is aggressive and thick. It overwhelms the palate and takes time to fade. I'll try to taste this brew again in a few months, to see if the evolution of my palate makes it more easy to drink for me. As of now, drinkable is not a word I could use for that beer, although I can appreciate its disturbing complexity."
"Other: I first tried this about 6 months ago without really knowing much about the style or the beer. An opportunity arose to try it again with slightly more experience under my belt, and I took it. Original review: 4.05"
"After having this 4 times in the last 2 weeks, I indeed can't see myself ever growing tired of it and raise the rating one point overall and there might be more to come!"
"Bottom line: ridiculously good, and a possible new favorite. Just amazing."
"Taste is quite sour and cherry tart. The fruity tartness overpowers most of the other flavors. Lots of cherry flavors in here. Hints of oak and vanilla way back there. My only complaint is that with the sour aftertaste there is also a strong coppery aftertaste which I don't find appeaing. Don't know if that is indicative of the style or this bottle is past its prime. Full bodied and flavorful beer. This was the flavor explosion I was expecting from the Rodenbach Red. Not nearly as balanced but still amazing."
"Rodenbach Grand Cru has a vasty different flavor from what most people imagine when they think of beer. This isn't something I'm going to start drinking daily, even if I could afford to, but it's a still a very interesting and challenging beer I'm glad to have tried."
"Served chilled, though not terribly cold. Aroma is wonderfully full, carmel-ish, and not sour. Refreshing initial taste, though perhaps too sweet for some. Flavor really opens up after the first sip -- cherries, I think, though certainly some citrus taste, as well. Finish is clean and even tart. Very easy to drink, not heavy at all."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown color with a tan head leaves behind webbed fine belgian style lacing. Aroma: Vinous and effervescent some tart cherry or raspberry tones to it leaves a woody almost cedar like finish to it an Oud Bruin in all of it's glory. Taste: Whopping array of tart tones but it's multilayered a tartness forms on the back of the tongue then sweet fruit grapes again the wine like tone very vinous and mild chocolate tones soften the mouthfeel by applying some sweetness to the overall profile of the flavor. Mouthfeel: High carbonation in that it's spritzy on the back of the throat but it still tends to be smooth going down a medium bodied masterpiece, a step above Petrus Oud Bruin in my opinion. Drinkability: The tartness does a lot to the palate and I believe this one should be enjoyed slowly in small portions there's alot going on relax and explore this beer there's no rush."
"**Highly Recommended**"
"i was utterly disappointed with this beer, the alexander is so much better. definately an acquired taste. it wasnt total crap, but i was wanting a lot more, and i can find it much better with numerous other belgians. worth a try, but again, its going to be one of those beers you either really love or really hate. im heading toward the latter."
"Medium weight in the mouth with an outstanding balance of sour fruitiness and malt. The earthiness is there again to add complexity. Unbelievable length, and excellent bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Great drinkability on its own, and incredible with food."
"Served in it's correct glass at the Bier Circus in Brussels, Belgium. This beer is Rodenbachs big brother. This is a darker, nearly brown coloured ale with a reddish/beige cap of foam. The aromas are just like that of regular Rodenback....but intensified to a new level. A new level of lactic, a new level of sour, a new level of cherry, and a new level of smooth. The taste is sheer perfection as fresh cherry flavor dances with the flavors of oak and tart sourness imparted into this beer by some unknown forces. The mouthfeel is excellent....creamy, smooth, great. The drinkability....once again WONDERFUL"
"Sadly, the drink left the glass too soon...can I get a magnum, please?"
"A somewhat nebulous ruby red to almost brown color, the head modest in size and frothy in consistency, light tan in color with some decent lace to coat the glass. Nose is tart cherries with sweet hints of maple syrup, yeast and a real dream of a nose. Sweet and sour start, the top middling in its feel, finish prickly in its acidity, hops perfect in their bite, very dry, vinous almost, wow what a great beer guess if I want any more I will need phone Belgium."
"Overall Impression: Having finally acquired a taste for geuze (and the like), I can definitely see the appeal of this beer. And why it's a ""hallmark"" of its style. Would be great to cook with in place of wine, too."
"Reddish color, slightly cloudy, small head. Very vinous nose (wine-like esters). Vinous taste, normal for Belgian red ales. Despite the vinous taste, there is a malty sweetness to the beer. Rich, full flavor that gets better the more you sip it. Definitely an acquired taste, but it is the best of style. Finish is clean, vinous and sharp. Aftertaste has a hint of cherry."
"I consumed the second half of my bottle with pickled herring in a white wine sauce with some sweet onion. They matched perfectly. The meal cost next to nothing, but I felt like I should have paid an arm for the joy I got to experience. It definitely never gets old."
"Devine!! ....Exceptional!!...A true classic. This is an incredibly challenging and assertive beer. I sampled it at around 8 or 9 degrees C . The lovely reddish colour and woody aroma are very inviting. It has a very oily and tart taste and the use of oak casks is quite obvious. There are also hints of fruit ( sour plum/cherry) and some slight vanilla notes. You must try this beer! Forget the port, have a Grand Cru."
"This is perfect, soulful, emotionally wrenching beer. It must be ranked above all other beers I know."
"Pours with a garnet hue and a white head. Aroma is mostly sour cherries. The taste is quite winelike with a cherry flavored tartness. This has to be the most under-rated style in the world. With beers like this out there I wonder why we don't see more flemish sour ales."
"(25.4 oz / 750 ml tall green champagne style bottle, corked, caged, and wrapped with gold foil)"
"Drinkability / overall: A delicious, intensely flavored, beefed up Old Bruin. Concomitantly rich and satiating, yet teasingly whimsical, beckoning the palate for more to attempt comprehension. This deserves to be in a 750 ml bottle. Outstanding. ""Best before 9/13/04"""
"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed an off white foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of chocolate, caramel and cherries. The flavor was of cherries and some malt and the sourness of it is definately there in the finish of the beer."
"Originally sampled 19 May 2003. Rodenbach Grand Cru is brown/reddish in color with a vinuous aroma. the sourness on the tongue is quite pleasant. This is a complex brew not for a beginner; however, it is certainly a beer that any serious beer drinker should try."
"While this is undoubtedly a finely crafted beer, it smells and tastes similar to a finely crafted sparkling apple wine. It pours a red tinted Oxford. A long-lasting, complex earthy aroma of malt, hops, green apples and a hint of alcohol are unusual for a beer. The medium malt body is thinner than it appears. There's a trace caramel flavor and a light sweetness to meekly counter the strong lemony citrus and acidic bitterness. Tart green apples, pear and oaky wood round out the flavors. A lemony dry clean finish leaves a slightly puckered mouthfeel."
"The result of ageing in wood barrel is manifest in the complexity of the smell and taste."
"Mostly brown body with some reddish characteristics. Head is cream colored with fairly large bubbles. Aroma is very sharp and wine-like. Fruity, but I don't know if it's cherries I'm smelling or just something about the beer that makes me think cherries. Even with that, the fruitiness is much more subtle than in the Alexander. The beer has stinging carbonation that gradually numbs the palate. There's a crisp tartness and again the flavor is very wine-like with some sweetness. The alcohol is pretty assertive in both the nose and in the flavor. I found it hard to believe that this beer was only around 6%. I could easily learn to enjoy this beer."
"Just an amazing beer, and really really complex. Well balanced sourness and hints of cherries, chocolate, and extremely smooth and refreshing, very yummy."
"I first had this beer on the recommendation of the bartender at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia and was immediately intrigued.  The beer has a tart, sweer and sour character that comes across in the smell as soon as you start pouring the glass.  One of the most unique and enjoyable beers I have had.  Hopefully, it will be available in the states again soon."
"Dear beergod, thank you. This is indeed one of the most refreshing beers on the planet. An absolute must try."
