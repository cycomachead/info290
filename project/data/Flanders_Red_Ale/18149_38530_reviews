"O: At $17 for a split i'm not entirely sure I got my moneys worth, but that's not to say it isn't lovely stuff. Heard people age this which had me suspicious given its only 5% (and has lager blended in?) but now that I tasted it i'm even more confused. If the fruit faded anymore it would be gone altogether. If I hit the bottle shop and cant find anything else to waste money on I may just put one away for a year or two. Glad I had it but... NEXT."

"O: Great beer.  I drink a large number of sours and this one stands up in its particular category.  It is aggressive and may not be for all beer drinkers, or even sour drinkers.  If you dig the style go with a classic American interpretation of it."
"2012 version, and oh so wonderful. Tart, and still very effervescent. Tasting more sour than fruity at this point (but isn't that the point of keeping it until now)."

"O: Not bad, good but not worth $16.99 for a 375 ml, I could see this being worth $9-10, maybe $12 for a 375 ml. Not a big beer, complex yes, but the price knocks me off, it was worth a try, not disappointed but not impressed. I am also not familiar with Flanders Red ales so it could just be me, cheers!"

"375 ml bottle from tread with Homer321. Thanks buddy! Bottle No. 2 of my Last Night of My 20s tasting. Pours dark reddish brown slightly murky, with a big airy khaki head on top. Aroma of lots of cherries, sour vinegar, oak, some toffee. Flavor is sour cherries, acidic tones, vinegar, and an unexpected wave of chocolatey flavors and vanilla oak tannins. Earthy spicy undertones. Interesting. Medium bodied, feeling a bit heft for only 5%, with lots of carbonation. Very interesting brew, and pretty unique."

"Best Flanders red I've ever had."

"With Red Poppy, Lost Abbey ages their sour brown with cherries in used wine barrels. What comes out is a great sour that really showcases the essence of the whole cherry; the skin, flesh, juice and even the pit. I really appreciated the strong vanilla character imparted by the oak barrels that is often missing in a lot of sour beer. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pleasure to drink and quite enjoyable. If you like a sour ale, this is it. Im not a huge fan of cherries so I was happy when the smell of them was there, but not so much in the taste. Taste brought me back in time for some reason, very old tasting and earthy with a smooth finish once you get past the initial tart. Also tastes a little wine-like. My biggest complaint was the price of this bottle. I dont think I'll shell out the money again so unfortunately this might be my one and only red poppy. Glad I tried it though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Hugely overpriced, to the point where it makes me slightly angry. It's about twice the price of La Folie per oz, which is in turn almost twice the price of Rodenbach Grand Cru. You get nothing for that mark up. It is a good beer though. It's fizzy and sour which leaves it feeling pretty harsh."

"Very tart! Cherries the big player in this sour. A very slight caramel taste. A real fruit flavored sour, and beer. One of the best sours. Full in body. I would say this is right there with New Belgium's La Folie. Both a brown ale sour. Very comparable."

"Overall, a more than competent offering on the Flanders Red Ale style, and one that I would gladly buy again were there not a similar option that I prefer slightly that is more readily available and comes in a 750 mL bottle instead of a 375 mL and for only a couple dollars more. Still, one that any fan of the vast tradition of sour-tasting beers from Belgium should try at least once."

"Fresh from tap, served in a tulip glass. Poured a light coppery brown with a fine head that lingered. Smelled tart fruit, cherries and plums? Moderate to high carbonation, on the thin side. Tart sour cherries with oak in the back, dry tart finish. I'm not overly familiar with these, but I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
"O: absolutely phenomenal take on this style by lost abbey. I wish it was a little less expensive but well worth it to taste this beer. I have to say I like this better than the classic of this beer style, Duchesse."
""
""
""
""
"Not going to do the average rating, all I'm going to say is this is a fresh 2014 bottle. I had a '13 semi fresh bottle maybe 2-3 months after it was released last year and it was great. This years needs a little age on it but it can easily be a high 4 with some age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer that will satisfy your sour craving. The balance of cherry and oak is very nice. The attention to detail in this beer is very apparent. It would be amazing if it had a bigger since of caramel, but other than that, I'm satisfied. I would recommend and buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep mahogany with a quickly dissipating cherry-tinged head. Aromas of sour cherry, melon and funk with hints of oak and vanilla. Gobs of sour on the tongue, followed by dark stone fruit. Very dry on the finish. Light bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, a very complex and refreshing Flanders Red Ale!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: So close to being really good, but just too much metal taste. I might try getting another bottle and letting it age to see if that flavor mellows out, but as it stands, there are lots of better sours out there."
""

"Not my style of beer. I think it is a solid Flanders Red. Appearance: dark murky brown ale; Light head; Heavy on the carbonation. Smell: sour cherries and good bacteria. Taste: sharp light and fast, acidic, carbonation, sour cherries was fulfilled, bacteria, no real finish very clean. Mouth feel: light and acidic."

"Reddish brown body with some light white lacing. Smells of tartness on the nose. Not really getting the cherry in the nose or in the body. The acidity drowns out most of the flavors I was hoping for. Given the pricepoint, I'd expect more balance, more cherry flavor. Very acidic for the style in my opinion."

""
""
""
""
"O: 9/10 - another solid offering from The Lost Abbey; I think that they picked it up spot on with the combination of brown ale and sour cherry flavors; I picked up a bottle on a recent trip to San Diego and wish that I had about three more...definitely recommended!"

"O - Overall a very tasty Flanders red. Tons of cherry, plenty of tart, nice woody notes and earthy funk. Balance of these aspects is very good. Don't buy this often enough. Have to make a note to pick up a few more bottles next time this one comes around."

"Raul is trying, Raul is trying to say something, but he can't. Like watching Renoir's ""The Rules of the Game", Raul is ineffable - pure beauty! Before, with Flanders Red Ales, Raulsky got that vinegar feel - but not with this bad sucker. Pure goodness. Like Christy Brinkley during the 90's - yes please!"
""
""
""
"This beer has a foamy, cloudy head that sinks quickly in the liquid. The color is that of slightly-muddled iced tea; some cloudiness, but not much. Funk is the primary aroma here, like well-ripened Roquefort, but a second after it smells slightly like caramel. Excellent carbonation, resonating on the tongue, but dryly. It's not as tart as I expected, considering the style, but it's very sophisticated; some flavors almost go undetected. I get tastes of lemon verbena, Merlot, blood orange, and balsamic reduction. I'm drinking this a little too quickly, but can barely contain myself."

"O - a well balanced and executed wild ale. While i wasnt crazy about the mouthfeel the aroma and flavors are very nice."
"M - Medium body. Dry and tart. Light to moderate carbonation."
"Pours a bubbly deep ruby-brown color with a finger width head. A fruity cherry aroma with a good amount of funk. taste is a beautiful biting tart flavor with a trace of the barrel aging mixed in. A carbonated mouthfeel and this beer rises above many others. Love it."

"O: This beer was solid. Loved drinking it. The only thing that threw me off was the smell. Not sure if it was good that it didn't smell like a sour or not, but it wasn't for me. I typically enjoy the strong standard sour smell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I didn't totally enjoy the sensation, though I can see how some would."

"Received from a good beer friend. Poured from a smaller 12.7 oz bottle to a tulip glass. Poured a deep brown-red hue with a 1/4 inch small head. Nose of sour cherries with some hints of fig and oak with sour funkiness. Taste was verytart and sour up front with a surprising nice hop bite. Good lingering sweetness and hoppiness. Good mouthfeel, easy drinking and refreshing despite its complex flavors. Overall, this was an awesome beer that I would love to have more of. Definitely a beer to seek our if you enjoy flanders reds."

"This beer is indeed top notch and the sour in this beer is not to overbearing at all. There is a hint of cherry that jumps in to grab you as it hits your pallet. I would NEVER pass this beer up, snag it in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nice example of the style. I think it could use more carbonation and just a bit more sweetness, but I'm very grateful I was able to try this. Plus, it is easily one of the most beautiful bottles I have yet seen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A sour beer of arrival, one should love tart sours before approaching this one. Tart, fruity, vanilla, tart and oak with a touch of vinegar acidity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very well done, but I don’t think it’s worth the price tag."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is tasting great and it's really standing out for me. One to try, one to buy, and one to put away to see how it changes over time."

"Enjoyable, but Love Child 3 toaster in the night was better."

"Overall: I enjoyed this beer mostly for its uniqueness. The brewing process was well thought-out here, balancing the acids produced by the wild yeast with the mellowing and sweetening effects of barrel aging and cherries. I would be interested in trying this beer either from a fresh bottle or on tap for comparison. Although this is an excellent beer and worthy of much of the hype surrounding it, I don't believe it's great enough to justify the $20 price-tag."
""
""
""
"OV: A very well done Flanders style Red Ale that would match any from the region itself and I've had my share of them being a fan of sours. The flavours on this are very tasty and the sour note is just right with acidic tartness and not too much of a vinegar aspect. A definite sessionable sipper that offers good flavours and cleanses your palate at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a stunningly powerful beer. I would like to try this side by side with La Folie as they seem to have similar characteristics, from what I remember."

"This is as good as it always is. One of the best Flemish Reds out there. I only wish Lost Abbey would make more of this and do it more often."
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: it often doesn't make sense for the ""overall"" to have a higher rating than any other category, but really the whole is greater than the sum. All of the features really play into each. It's like alchemy."
""
""
""
"O: Good, and quite drinkable given the low ABV and light level of sour, but the flavors don't quite come together as well as they could. This is leaps and bounds above the 2012 vintage (which I rated a 2.75), though, which had a very offensive, funky aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer. The sour cherries really work well with the vinegar and tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the tongue, it still only hints of cherries, but it is certainly tasty. Even though this has seen 6 months in oak, the oak is restrained. It's quite tart, and really light and satisfying to drink. At 5%, this is one I could drink all day and all night. If I have any criticism, I'd say it's slightly under-carbonated. But that's a tiny quibble. It's a delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a beautiful beer. I wish I could drink this every day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice balance of sweet, funk, and oak. I really enjoyed this one. I'm curious what a bit of age would do for it - I'll have to try and find a way to wrestle up another bottle."
""
"I'm pretty new in the world of sours, but this is exactly what I had in mind when I was jonesing for one tonight. I was hoping for a bit more crimson on the pour, because let's face it, I like to be shallow and judge my beer by its looks at first. It was more of a brownish color, with a hint of blood to it. I used a tulip, and it foamed up right away. I had to let it sit to finish the bottle, and as it fell, it left some nasty-looking splotches on my glass. Since the looks didn't quite work out, I had to go after the personality. First off, it just blew sour cherries in my nose, followed by a tart, sour cherry flavor, and then a crisp, satisfying finish of, you guessed it - sour cherries. It wasn't that eye-closing sour, but indeed it was tart. It didn't linger too long, leave too much of a puckering aftertaste, but instead was watery enough to do its thing and then pick up and go home. I genuinely loved this beer, but for the price, I'd only have it again as a gift."
""
""
""
""
"O-As a Flanders ale fan (and on the date of the Tour of Flanders bicycle race, no less), I had hopes for this beer, but I am a bit disappointed. The flavors are not very complex and the missing tartness/acidity really hurt the smell and taste score. On the bright side, the mouthfeel is nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I decided to pop this 2013 vintage of Red Poppy to get as much sour cherry flavor out of it as possible. Unfortunately, the cherry was surprisingly muted, and the overall flavor profile seemed raw and poorly integrated. This was definitely not worth the $18 I paid for my bottle."
"O: I really enjoyed this, probably wouldn't buy again for the price though. It isn't on the level of Supplication, but it's a good AWA."
""
""
""
"O. Has great smells! that carry into the flavor.. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wish I would have read my own post before purchase; where is my DeLorean?"
""
"O: This beer is incredibly easy to drink, especially since it isn't that tart or sour. I really enjoyed this and would definitely try it again."
"O: Overall this is a really enjoyable beer and is quite easy to drink, especially for the style. Nice amounts of tartness without the over the top tartness/vinousness. Good flavors contributed by the sour cherries and a good amount of complexity."
"O: Nice flavor profile, great balance, its one hell of a brew, and this will be one that I will most likely seek out int he future. Only wish is that it was in a larger format, because I'm left wanting a second glass"
""
""
""
""
"I like Supplication a bit more overall, but Red Poppy is a bit more complex."
""
"O - as a Flanders fan, it's hard to find a fault in this beer beyond the $16/12oz. price tag. I'd rate it higher, if it had a little more vinegar in the flavor, but really enjoyed it ""as is"". There are more assertive Flanders at much lower prices, but this beer made me appreciate balance for the style. If money and variety weren't a consideration, then I'd be glad to drink this quite often."
""
""
""
"It has a very distinct nose and decent sense of what might be coming, but the palate just doesn't deliver, the wet grainy taste is a real disappointment."
""
"Lovely sour that's just my speed. Very good beer that's damn close to excellent. My wife has proclaimed it her favorite sour ever...which is saying something."
""
"on a side note - the name ""Red Poppy"" seems to conjure up a particular flavor that I didn't find here (lemon poppy seed muffin?!) - has anyone else had a similar thought?"
""
""
"Fresh bottle. Pours an opaque orange brown with only a hint of the red color I expected. A fluffy white head formed in the tulip that lasted without any lacing. Smell is vinegar, funk, oak barrel, cherry. Taste is similar, sour vinegar cherries, funk, vanilla spice and smoothness from the barrels. Very easy to drink for something so sour, great Flanders red. Too bad it's so pricey"
""
"Verdict: A good rendition of a Flanders Red from The Lost Abbey. Certainly not their finest work, but this is sure to satisfy anyone who enjoys a sour beer or who loves cherries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another winner from Lost Abbey. This one ranks up there as one of the best American takes on a Flanders Red. Price tag is a bit of a deterrent, but still worth picking up a bottle if you can find it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Truly one of the most creative and well-executed American-made sours. A deft balancing act, and a delight to drink from start to finish. Wort the price of admission if sours are your thing."
""
""
"O: A really enjoyable beer, and one of the more cherry forward sours I have had. It really showcases the featured ingredient. I could stand for this one being a slight bit drier on the finish, but that is just my personal preference with sours."
""
""
""
""
"Definatly one of the better examples of the style. Similar to oude tart. Not super funky, but definatly intensely sour and full of bright cherry flavors."

"Attractive: ruddy red-brown color, murky, with a thick ringlet of off white foam. Aroma was slightly tart and woody, notes of cherry and vinegar. Similar taste, biscuity malt base, light cherry, apricot, decently balanced acetic acid, tart but not quite puckering, slightly woody. Pretty strange that this uses a brown ale base, because it barely resembled a brown ale at this point of its life. Medium body, medium carbonation, drying effect in the aftertaste. Nice overall."

"The beer tastes largely sour with definite notes of sour cherries, though they are weaker than I would hope for. Caramel malts are present in the background as a faint hint, but the sour cherry funk is the dominant thing. Yeast notes give a slight sour apple and slight barnyard and hay notes, as well as slight buttery notes in the middle of the taste, and the beer is nice to sip slowly. The mouthfeel has strong under-pricklings, but overall the beer is smooth and creamy. The tongue is left slick with saliva and a slight after taste of cherries and sour apples, the middle of the tongue is also dry but sticky. The real star of the mouthfeel, however, is how the beer mellows its own effervescence out into a smooth velvety embrace on your tongue. Overall this is another tasty Flanders red. I didn’t like this as much as Oude Tart, but I think I liked it more than Rodenbach’s Grand Cru. It’s worth a try for sour lovers, and I am very happy to sample a full bottle from The Lost Abbey, though their pricing on the East Coast is a far too much for my budget. Worth a try, but not worth continued sampling."
""
""
"O: Easily the sourest and tastiest of the Flanders Red Ales I've had (although my experience is limited). It has all the makings of a top tier sour. This one is one that not only am I glad I tried but one that will forever be on my wants list. Thanks again RocPorterFanatic...I am eternally grateful for the chance to drink this beer."
"O: A great Flanders Red - a very nice lactic sourness balanced by dark fruit and vanilla sweetness with a great sour cherry taste. I could use a bit less sourness, but this has been sitting for some months now."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $17.99 for a 375 ml bottl"
""
""
""
""
"O- I haven't had too many Flanders Red, but I would probably say this is my favorite so far. It had a nice cherry flavor that finished with a decent tartness that wasn't overly tart. If you like cherries and sours I would definitely recommend trying this beer out. A little bit pricey from the bottle, but definitely worth the $7 for a glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not huge on sour ales, but this one is excellent. The sour cherry gives the first half of the flavour an addicting taste that leaves me wanting more. The latter half of the flavour tempers this, with a more moderate, developed flavour profile. Recommended. Would have again."

"O- 6/10 sourness. Very good Flanders Red. Not as sweet and a little more sour than others of the style I have had. Worth it to try once but not one I would buy again because of the price."
""
""
"DOA"
""
"O: a good beer overall. Not extremely complex, but enjoyable and thankfully carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"First sip there was too much going on. I love tart and sour in candy but this beer was unlike anything I have ever tasted.This went right down the drain after I had it. It does have lemon and other citrus flavor to it, but it is a malt with way too many strong flavors that all seem to over power one another."
""
""
"O - Pretty good beer. Would like to see a bit more sweetness to it to compliment the tart and funk."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer, the tart cherry flavors are vivid and delicious but also kept in great balance with the malt sweetness and barrel character, awesome stuff."
""
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is about as good as it gets as far as Flanders Reds go. If you see it, buy it. Yes, it's pricey, but it doesn't disappoint."
""
"Nice bold Flanders red, with a lot of sour."
""
""
"o - Great beer!"
""
""
"Overall: as much as I enjoyed this one, I can't see myself buying a lot of it at 18 dollars a pop. It's kind of a ""buy a bottle once a year"" type beer. That said, it's a really well-made Flanders Red and I'd imagine it being a good candidate for cellaring."
""
""
""
"O- This beer has some nice tartness with hints of barrel and brett notes with a good support from the malt, but it has a thick heavy body that really makes it slow to drink. The tartness is more from fruit than yeast character so it doesn't have that classic Flanders Red yeast profile but it is still nice to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Wow, what a treat. Not too sour or tart on the taste or mouthfeel but rather on the nose. Enjoyed the subtle character, giving it more of sweet and profound cherry notes. Will be looking for another bottle of this and hopefully going to age!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Sours rarely seem to be complex beyond words like ""funk"" and such but this is damn good. I know that much. Pricey but it's a great beer to try once. Or twice."
"Exceedingly tart on the tongue. Various light berry bits, dry fruity finish, tart from start to finish. It's a style that I am far from acquainted with. From the few samples I can recall, though, this one sits right at the top."
""
""
""
"Pours amber with a deep ruby red hue and a three finger light brown head which dissipates fairly quickly. The smell of cherry and oak is clearly present. Opens with a sour blast of cherries, vinegar, and funk which transitions to the base brown ale. The finish is tart, oaky, and dry. An extremely balanced Flanders Red, never too sweet, just the right amount of tartness, and the oak barrel flavor blends well and adds some complexity. Definitely among the top tier of American-brewed Flanders Red Ales."
"Awesome brew. Good variety of flavors. A little light on the body, but not really in a bad way. This might give the duchess a run for its money in my book."
"Cheers!"
""
"o - really excellent beer and probably my favorite lost abbey so far."
"The Lost Abbey has a noticeable barrel flavor in their brews. It represents Red Poppy very nicely, but I look for more sweetness to balance the sour and woody qualities. Still an excellent brew and an upper-class Flanders Red."
"A damn fine flanders. Delivers the sour you crave without overpowering. This isn't terribly complex, but it has quite a bit going on."
"O - Nice one from Lost Abbey, but not quite up to Rodenbach Grand Cru or Cuvee de Jacobins for the style. Looking forward to seeing what some age does this to this."
""
"O - Very well put together, not overly sour, and not overly ""winey"". This was very refreshing, tasty, but not sure if it's worth the cost per bottle. Glad to have tried though for sure."
"I already yearn for next time..."

"Muled back from my LA trip! This is #BOTG 43! Poured from bottle into 512 Farmhouse glass. Pours a very hazy brown/reddish color. nice fluffy head fills the glass, an offwhite color. Smell- tart cherries, sour cherry pie, a little bit of a salty aroma as well. Layers of cherries and sugar in the aroma. Taste- hot dr pepper! a nice tart and funky blast of cherries, puckering sour at the end. The tight carbonation makes for a dry finish. Some horse blanket funk coils with the tart sweetness from the cherries. There are layers of flavor with this, its wonderful. One of the better Flanders styles I've ever had."
"O: I like this quite a bit. The funk is really integrated, and the sourness is up front but not un-checked by great depth and oaky spice. I like the combo of clean, lemon-like sour flavors and a vinegary sweetness."
"Poured into a snifter, the beer is a deep, hazed, auburn-brown coloring that pours with a ton of carbonation. Low profile, thin, off-white head that quickly settles out into a filmy ring around the surface. Aromas of juniper and jasmine floral highlights on a dark, rich, black cherry and currant sweet backbone. The increased carbonation keeps the body thin, and gives the sour notes an extra punch. Syrupy sweet flavors transition into an earthy, wine barrel characteristic. The aftertaste is sour and sweet at the same time, with an effervescent feel. The finish is sharp, but light, with a bubbly feel left across your tongue. Tangy and puckering at the end. Good brew."
""
"overall: solid stuff - really enjoyed"

"Pours a murky dark ruby brown with a thin dense cream head that fades to a thick collar and minimal lace. Aroma of oak, light vinegar, apple sauce, tart cherry; pleasant blend of acid and sweet. Flavor is oaky and mildy cherry and vanilla sweet through the body before a strong acidic sourness builds long into the finish. Medium thick body with light carbonation. A little too harsh and acidic in the finish, but a nice oak and fruit presence otherwise."
"Poured a dark brown with a thin tan head. The aroma had the expected Brett notes along with some fig and green apple. The flavor was intense in a good way, some dark fruit flavors mixed with a decent amount of funk along with some fig and plum flavors. The mouthfeel left you with a thick coating of sourness on the tongue that lingered after it goes down. Overall this was a very enjoyable beer, however at over $20 for a 12.7 ounce bottle I don't know if I'd pick one of these up again."

"Good beer though. Better than there Duchesse."

"Picked up a bottle and was rather amazed it was still on the shelf. Score. Poured from corked 375mL bottle to Cuvel tulip the beer pours a dark amber brown, opaque and cloudy. The red tones of the amber are highlighted in the edges in the light. 2 finger off-white/tan head with nice retention and lacing. The nose is a blend of sour, oak, vinegar, funk, dark fruits, and tart apple. Blended well together the aroma is appealing. Similarly the flavor begins with an oaky funk at first that develops to a tart, slightly sour, vinegar cherry sweetness. Mildly bitter and well balanced. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Finishes tart and sweet with a lingering full palette sour. Very good. Overall, the price tag has kept me at bay for years but I am glad to have pulled the trigger finally. Very enjoyable."
"Overall I really enjoy this one but the pricetag just really sucked. Not the breweries fault."

"I usually like Flanders, but this one was a bit overboard. There may have been some good things there, but all I could really taste was vinegar."

"O- I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. With so much flavor it's hard to believe its only 5% ABV. This brew really reminded me of RR's Concecration which is a good thing. At 15 bucks for a 375 ml bottle it will be hard not to get a couple RR sours instead."
""
"nearly 17 bucks for a 12.7oz cork and cage setup. sexy packaging. major prestige for these guys in my mind, as their stuff is rare and always exquisite. the angels share stands as one of the all-timers, so i was pumped up to try this. pours a murky brown ale color into a wine glass with a really bubbly tan head that slowly relaxes to just a lacing. smells like a flemish sour. hard. some sour cherry essence in the nose and a nice sweeter brown ale malt complement. flavor is outstanding. huge sour brett-like sting at the front end, but maybe not even brett, tough to tell, could just be the cherries here. big malty woody middle where the vanilla and spice of the oak come to the fore, balanced out by some fairly hefty chocolate malts. tart finish. this is one of the best feeling beers out, totally effervescent carbonation gives life to all the subtle complexities going on, and the medium body feels lighter than it is. i say they make a double red poppy, which is now on my must try list. this beer is fantastic, but the price keeps it a drink for the elite only. sad but true."
""
""
"Great beer but it's a huge price. $20.00 for a 375! I made the decision to purchase it because it was the last one on the shelf and I knew it was kinda of rare. It was one of those things I would only do once because I certainly not spend another $20 for a bottle like this. The price is just way too steep."
"Pours a clear brown-orange with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour cherry, vinegar, and funk. Taste is the same with a mineral flavor on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors."
"O: I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Great balance between caramel and fruit. And the texture is magical. If it wasn't so expensive, it would be one of my regulars."
""
"O-a bit too sour for my liking"
"O- I like this beer a lot, it is not the best of the style, that being said it is still delicious and its one of the most sour beers ive ever had, the big thing that would keep me from buying this again is the price, way too high for a 12.7oz bottle, other than that it was a pleasure to drink"

"Just opened my first 2012 vintage and couldn't believe it was the same beer. This year's is significantly better to the point where I'm surprised it's even the same beer. I'd give the '12 somewhere in the 4.15 range."

"D - A solid Flanders Red Ale that is an assault on senses... Potent would be an understatement... There is nothing subtle about it... Not my favorite for a style, but a rather extreme American interruption on the style..."
"One of Lost Abbey's finer beers, almost makes you forgive them for past sins."
""
"O- unbelievable, a $18 drain pour. Maybe this is a bad bottle, but I'm not going to spend money again to find out."

"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a high level of carbonation. I say high carb but it is not overdone. It lightens the overall feel and makes it fairly easy drinking. The alcohol is very well integrated and only provides a mild warmth down the back of the throat. While this was a really enjoyable brew, I found the aroma to be the best aspect of it. I wish the flavor packed as much character as the aroma. If you haven't tried this yet, it is worth a shot."
"Pours a beautiful deep amber almost brown color with good visibility through the pour. A small bubbly head fades quickly and leaves nothing behind. The aromas are huge with vinegar, cherries, and funk. Taste is sour yet smooth. Plenty of fruits and earth tones are present and isn't overpowering in any way. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with great carbonation. Overall this is amazing. I would love this aged."

"Thanks Ryan for such a top notch extra!"

"Pours a reddish brown with a finger length head disapates quickly. Aroma of vinegar and funk, cherries not present in the nose. Taste follows nose but brings in sour cherries in finish.

"Originally I'd opened this bottle to share with my girlfriend but she's bowed out leaving me to savor this one solo. This is a palette-challenging, complexly woven sour brown ale. Certainly one to enjoy slowly but also a bottle that might be a tall order for moderately-skilled sour connoisseur like myself."
"Big thanks to Soonami for hitting this want. 375ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash tulip at 48 degrees. I believe this is last year's vintage (2010?). Pours a brownish hue with reddish highlights; clarity is semi-translucent. Head is loose, one inch and tan-colored and eventually settles into a consistent 1/8th inch skim. I love the nose on this beer - tart cherries, vinegar, cork and a faint briny character. Taste is somewhat consistent with nose; however, the sour cherries have definitely faded, but there is still quite a bit of residual tartness and acidity as well as the merest suggestion of the barrel. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light). The carbonation is very assertive and a bit prickly; however, not gassy. The carbonation, coupled with the acidity, leaves quite a bit of residual tingle along the sides of the cheeks and across the tongue. Finish is actually quite dry. Overall, I have to say that I prefer this beer fresh as you definitely loose the tart cherry in the flavor profile. That said, this is a very good beer and for someone who really digs the sour component; it will definitely improve with some age."

"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Flanders Reds are not exactly something I drink very often, but I do enjoy them from time to time and this is one that I would definitely have again."
"Reddish brown, mahogany color. 3/8 of an inch of tan head dissipates leaving minimal lacing. Big sour cherry aroma. Wet horse blanket and loam fill out the nose. Huge acidic tartness up front. Sour cherries in abundance mid-palate. Barnyard funk, oak and wet hay fill out the flavor profile. The finish is dry and tart. Feel is light with a fizzy level of carbonation, which adds to the experience. Red Poppy is a wonderful example of a Flanders Red. Tart, dry cherries and a light fizzy body make this a joy to imbibe. A perennial favorite."

"Red Poppy ale pours an amber color w/ a sliver of cocoa head. Lots of sediment in this one. Excellent smelling brew- Sourness, cherries, berry, yeast are the main things I get. Really smooth, and not too bitter. Taste steps it up a notch. This is one of the best beers I've had in this style. Sourness, cherry, and oak are the main things I get, and the brew improves and opens up w/ warming. Feel is smooth, tart w/ a decent amount of acidity. Overall, this is a winner- glad I got to try it. Cheers-"
"Overall: This is a really good sour. Very sour and still very easy to drink. I would definitely have another."
"Overall I greatly enjoyed this beer. Nice depth and flavor with a great mouthfeel."
"Deep ruby-burgundy color. Creamy khaki colored head. Head holds just ok and won't cling to glass. Very high carbonation. This smells fantastic, and I never use that word. Intense cherry aroma, also cherry-like brett. character, tart to the nose, deep roasted oak. This is like a darker malted Belgian Kriek with little to no wheat character. Low Ph, with an appealing range of acid flavors. Tartness is very enjoyable. I'm glad I aged it. Balanced perfectly. I'm really impressed, this is the best American Sour I've had. Somewhat similar to the Gargamel from Allagash which I also really enjoyed."
"Overall: wonoderfully sour. Complex. Drinkability is high. Good balance between fruit and sour."
"D- A nice winter and fall beer, the acidic feel leaves me wondering how much of this I could drink in one sitting, one bottle is enough. Overall a wild beer that is very tasty."
"Enjoyed this more than the Jacobins Rouge. It's a fine line for me I guess with the implementation of the sour."
"375 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky brown color with some tints of red, and about a half inch light tan head. Head retention was OK, and there isn't much lacing left on the glass. Aroma is mostly tart, the brew smells like tart cherries, oak, vinegar, and some funk. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some red grapes noticeable too. There's also a long lasting tart finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it has high but soft carbonation which eases up some as the beer warms. I think this is a pretty good overall brew, it's easy to drink and quite enjoyable. But because of the high price ($16.99 a bottle), it's going to be a very long time before I consider buying it again."
"Overall - Not a balanced Flanders Red, but definitely a tasty one. I'd like to get a bit more complexity out of it, but it's just cherries all the way."
" Overall I kind of new to sours but I have had a few and they were a good bit easier to drink than this. Decent flavor profile,I will have to try again onced I'm better versed in the style."
"Great beer. Has an elegant simplicity but oozes class and intrigue at the same time."
"Acetic mouthfeel and very drinkable really. Was very impressed by my first brush with Lost Abbey beers."
"Drinkability: The vinegary taste makes it one to sip--but a delicious one. I was excited to find this one in my cellar--what a treat!"
"Appearance is reddish brown, dense and with some bubbles. The nose on this flanders is sour, but more sour than any flanders from my recent memory. Some cherries come out too and and spice. Upon sipping it from a tulip glass, I pucker up. Red poppy really delivers on the sour quality. More of the cherries, gummy sweetness. This has a crisp body with funk in the finish. A very good beer, albeit a pricey one."
"O- not the best I've had, but still very damn good. Lost Abbey puts out some good stuff when their QC issues are under control"
"The price per ounce of this beer, in my opinion, is a bit overpriced. It was, however, one of the absolute better Flanders Oud Bruin’s I’ve tried but not something I would stock up on when there are just as good ones available at a more reasonable price. I was glad I was able to try it and thank Nick for splitting the cost to make this easier to swallow."
"O: <3333"
"All in all, a beautiful example of the style. Well done Lost Abbey (again)"
"T: There's a great sour punch right off the bat and the sourness lingers on the tongue forever. Vinegar and dark cherries make up the body of the flavor with a hint of bready malt. The carbonation is absolutely perfect in this as well."
"Glad I can still find this on tap every once in awhile. Looking forward to the next bottle release this winter."
"O: I wish I hadn't lost a third of my bottle, because this is one tasty treat. From the looks of it, this one is readily available in certain areas of the country during certain times of the year, so I'll be sure to pick up a couple more bottles then."
"O-WAY overhyped. Doesn't even begin to live up to the price. I would take a Rodenbach Grand Cru over this any day."
"Pours deep ruby in color with light brown head. Aroma is terrific. Tart cherries, a bit of wood notes, and a solid malty base. Love it. Taste is not as tart as I expected, but tartness is definitely very playful on my tongue. There is a bit of fruit sweetness and wood tannins. Medium body. It's not just about sour cherries. A lovely ale that I picked up in my travels to CA. Glad I have another bottle."
"This is my first Lost Abbey beer, and overall I thought it was amazing.  I really need to seek out more Flanders Reds and Flanders Ouid Bruins; this and CL Rosso E Marrone are among the best sours I've had the pleasure of having."
"O - A very solid beer though I would say it is a touch of a let down, especially given how amazing the nose was. Certainly a good beer and I would not mind having one to lay down for a while."
"O - Very enjoyable. The oak helps balance out the tartness, and the flavor profile just screams cherry."
"This is a very good American sour. There is a lot of complexity that makes this a great beer. The only sticking point is the price. I'd rather go for some Russian River Supplication which is several dollars cheaper and slightly better."
"Wow, tremendous beer. Lost Abbey layers the flavors and aromas nearly flawlessly. This may just be my favorite Flanders. As much as I enjoy La Roja, I wish it tasted like this. Very drinkable, ridiculously enjoyable. If given the opportunity, this is a beer to try."
"Overall a great beer with awesome complexity."
"Sour delight! Wow this ale pours a murky reddish/amber/brown with enormous head, pillowy soft, very bubbly. Nose is simply enormous, rich, tantalizing, and full of sour cherries & bready/yeasty stuff. Wild sour cherries on the palate, some Belgian estery qualities, and a nice sour finish. Good body too, and drinkable. Wow, love this one except for the price, and fortunately for the Lost Abbey that isn't a review criterion."
"Pours a murky reddish/light brown color with a bubbly white head, leaving behind little lacing. It smells very much like sour cherries. It also has a bit of a lemony zest to it as well. It tastes very much like the nose would suggest. Very tart, makes you pucker at first, but not overly tart that it can't be handled. Very good beer to drink and one you can drink a lot of with a 5.5%abv if you can drink a lot of sour beers. Overall a beer I wish I could have much more of."
"O- Very good, easy to drink beer. Sometimes I have a tough time drinking something sour or tart, but this is pretty smooth. Glad I have a few bottles of this to open up over some time. Nicely done!"
"D - An absolute pleasure to drink, especially considering the lower ABV means one could have a few of these. Would love to try the ""double cherry"" version at some point, as I think that would offset a bit of the oak. Wish this one was year-round and on-tap more often."
"-Cheers"
"Overall Red Poppy is very well done. One of the best Flanders reds I have ever tried. This is well worth seeking out. Beers like this one are the reason Lost Abbey is so polarizing. Sure, they are known for their mistakes and poor customer service. But when they do something right, it is a truly exceptional beer."
"A near flawless example of the style. There's a reason I pick this one up every year. Thanks Lost Abbey!"
"O - Great beer, and great style. The cost is a little high, so I'll probably drink Supplication over this most of the time."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with very little foam at all. Very flat pour. The aroma is a bit tart from the cherries and a hint of vinegar. The first sip kind of gets you at your jawline, a bit tart but not overly so. There is a nice vinegary flavor coming through, alot of the cherry flavor is gone but still has that tartness. The body is very thin with low carbonation. Its still very enjoyable but definitely one that should be consumed fresh."
"O - One of my favorite brews from Lost Abbey, and this bottle did not disappoint. If you have not had the pleasure, seek this out."
"Overall: Good beer. Not worth the price I paid for it, but I'm glad I tried it. I prefer the RR sours by a mile, they are world class."
"D: Absolutely delicious and very drinkable, however, it's great to sip on and enjoy the complexity and balance.  One of the best Flanders that I've had this side of the Atlantic.  "
"This is a very pleasant brew that is similar to sours. The cherry flavor isn't overbearing and is just enough for a good balance."
"O: A very nice beer, but I obviously preferred the aged version to the newer, having found the flavors to mellowed, blended, and balanced more in the aged version. I guess the lesson learned is to let this beer sit for a few years to be fully enjoyed."
"Overall: When the bottle was opened I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the aroma, only to be let down a little bit by the flavor. It was good, but nothing about this truly differentiated itself from other beers in the style. Why spend the effort to track this down and pay premium money for this when there are better options that are both cheaper and more readily available?"
"Overall, a tasty beer. I'm glad I have another, but I don't know that it's worth the $16 price tag. Probably won't seek this one out in the future."
"Tasted a 2008 vintage (courtesy of Jeff) alongside the newer vintage from the BIF. Both pour a cloudy russet-sunset sienna topped by a half-finger of dirty cream foam. The nose of the '08 comprises light vinegar, cherries, cinnamon, raspberries, and a rich red wine. The newer vintage, on the other hand, comprises red apple, cinnamon, maple syrup, oak, graham crackers, and light chocolate. Definitely more tart fruit in the aged version. The taste of the '08 holds notes of tart-ish black cherry, raspberries, black currant, light cocoa, graham crackers, cinnamon, and clove. The newer version is somewhat similar, with notes of tart cherry, black currant, mandarin orange, clove, and sharp raspberry. Both bodies weigh in at light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, a great beer with or without a few years on it. I think I prefer the older vintage, but it's not too big of a disparity."
"D - this is a solid Flanders red. The cherries really popped out ofthis one and made this one of the better beers I have had from Lost Abbey. Recommended!"
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, mildly filling, mild kick, very drinkable representation of style. This is the first that I've had from The Lost Abbey and I am rather impressed. I'm not sure this is worth its price tag, but based on taste alone, I would most certainly drink this one for an evening."
"O: I love Red Poppy. It edges out La Folie as best American interpretation of the style, and I think it might beat the very best Belgians. I wish it were cheaper and available in Indiana, preferably on tap in my basement. Huzzah!"
"pours brown with amber highlights around the edges. alot of thick off white head that sticks around awhile. smells like red wine vinegar and wood. taste is sour tart cherries up front, then comes the wood, then theres the vinegar i smelled. has good carbonation but just feels watered down, very thin. i've had better beers of this style for half the price. cant get that vinegar taste out of my mouth."
"I really like this one. I always enjoy trying LA beers."
"Light body with a little bit much on the carbonation. Overall a pretty on point flanders. I think it's tough to beat red poppy."
"Overall this beer absolutely did not disappoint. I enjoyed every aspect of the beer."
"Pretty good, lacks the punch and flavor of other traditional Flanders Reds."
"PP (Price Point) - $18.99 for a 375ml caged and corked bottle is super, super overkill in price. I am not a big sour fan, but this continues on with the trend of Lost Abbey having underwhelming beers at overwhelming prices. Would be more appropriatley priced around $6-$8."
"2012 update: Big metallic scent, and more sugar then tartness. still good, but it gets knocked down a notch. Also, brew is SUPER dark ruby BROWN! Clarity seems to be in question. Much darker and lower carbonated then in years past. Still An awesome brew."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! 2011 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured red-brown with a half finger cream colored head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, wood, and cherry. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, wood, cherry, and raspberry. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The wood characteristic of this one really added to the overall enjoyability (is that even a word???) of the beer. The sour/tart notes were spot on and not too harsh allowing the cherry and raspberry to shine through as well. Just a well put together brew that I enjoyed quite much."
"O- One of the best from Lost Abbey, this was a 2011 bottle so I'm anxious to see what it does with a little time. I think it could really mature into something exceptional because it's already damn good."
"O- This is a solid sour beer, from the first initial smell of this beer I was expecting something fantastic but was a little let down with the taste, still enjoyed drinking this beer and would definitely drink again."
"Tart cherries hit you in the nose upon opening and really shine through in the taste as well. It's a very crisp refreshing beer that makes me wish I lived in CA to have this beer on hand a bit more regularly."
"As a lover of sour beers this is one of my absolute favorite beers of all time. It smells amazing and the beer is very effervescent and is extremely drinkable. Not a beer to start off sour beers on as it is quite sour but no acetobacter at all and is extremely clean. I recommend this to anyone that likes sour beer as it is one of the best around."
"O- One of the more pricey beers that I have sat on for awhile. Having tried it, would not purchase again. Cannot justify the cost."
"Split the bottle with a couple friends. Hell of a beer. I'm not always a fan of the Flanders sours, but this tones down the creamy sweetness of a Duchess into a mellow cherry and strawberry character over biting citrus and sour tang. I'm most impressed by the balance of the different flavors, rolling from one to the other instead of just covering each other up. Find this beer."
"It's a very good beer, but for the $16.25 I paid for it, I'd really rather have a Consecration."
"Overall: This is a solid beer, both for style and just in general. This is something that II wish came around more often and a little less expensive though I would still buy one once in a while at the going rate in Philly. Highly recommended for sour fans."
"O Highly recomended for the style. Worth the try and I felt really good."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with less than a finger of cream colored head. The nose is sweet and sour. Vinager and cherries come to mind. The taste is much the same but nicely amped. Lip smacking tartness upfront with some sweet cherry offerings. Delightful. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and prickly from the tartness. Super drinkable and damn tasty as well"
"overall - good flavor and nose but the price tag $17 for 375ml is way too much - one of those beers where after yo try it you can not justify buying another ever!!"
"Poured a brown-red hazy body with a short lived beige head. Aroma is sour and is obviously of bitty red cherries. Kinda earthy and super funky tasty. Woah. Cherry flavor isn't maybe as wild and fresh as I expected but that's fine. This beer is beery. Thought I tasted a tootsie roll for a second. Back to cherry. Feel is slightly drying. Delicious."
"Overall is a great beer. I would drink this all the time if it were in Oregon. After a day of IPAs I thought this would be the perfect finish and it certainly was,"
"O- Had this sitting my cellar for a few months and decided to pop it open. Glad I did. A well done Flanders Red with a crisp acidic bite to it. I would like to try this fresher o see if I get more cherries, but still very enjoyable."
"O - Enjoyed this flanders alot. Not quite sure if its worth the hype though as there are other flander's that deliver the tasty that aren't as expensive."
"O- A pretty good Flanders Red but sort of one dimensional, not as complex as was expected. For the price i would probably just buy something from Russian River instead, but please not, price was not a factor in this review, tasty brew none the less."
"Good drinkability on this one. Nicely tart while maintaining drinkability."
"O- its a good red but the cherries seem to be a bit over the hill and lacking the fresh sour hit. I would like to try the base beer without the cherries and see what that's like. Up against rodenbach gc its got some work to do."
"Medium thinner body, somewhat watery but really high carbonation. This keg was definitely overgassed, as it took the bartenders about 7 minutes to pour a glass. I'd like to give this a try out of a bottle so I can re-review it."
"What's the deal with the pricing on these? More than $1 an oz? Supplication is better and cheaper, so I can't really recommend this too strongly, worth checking out and special occasions, but damn its pricey."
"Enjoyed this brew thoroughly. Figured i'd enjoy it in a snifter which in turn made the ""sour"" cherry smell unbelievable! Poured dark red with a light pink head about half inch thick on top. Sweet/Tart taste was everything i look for in a Flanders Red."
"Red Poppy is undoubtedly one of the best Flanders browns in America. Complex flavors make it a joy to sip and ponder."
"While I didn't consider cost as a factor for my review, the question must be asked: is a 350mL bottle of this worth as much as a 650mL bottle of La Folie? Methinks not."
"O: A solid flanders, but not my favorite. After being blown away by Marron Acidifie, I'm having to downgrade this one slightly. Would like to try this one on draft too."
"O: This beer was right in my wheel house, sour and dry with some nice oaky flavors. I have one more bottle that I think I will save for a special occasion. Cheers!"
"Overall: This was a very interesting and enjoyable beer. It makes me want to try more sour beers! The biggest down fall is the price! At over 15 dollars for 12oz bottle this beer will be reserved for special occassions only!"
"O: as my second sour I am really impressed, it was enjoyable and will definatly look for it again"
" Flavour initially brings out the cherries with a touch of sweetness, but this is very quickly overcome by an intensely sour / tart follow-up, augmented with the oak barrel quality that seems to only intensify this puckering sourness. Definite red wine quality as well. This is one of my favourite style's , but this ale is more between rosso & marrone and a cantillon kriek , just to sour for the style! though I recognize the high quality in this ale."
"Overall this is one of the best cheery beers that I have tried. Great cherry taste with some funk and good mouthfeel make this beer a winner. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"Non-blind comments: This was both my first Flanders red ale and my first from Lost Abbey. I'll be seeking out more of both!"
"Drink- Very nicely done. A small beer to sip with dessert or on a hot day. Would like to have this one again."
"Overall I appreciate that Red Poppy is not as sweet, syrupy and acetic as a Rodenbach but there's a part of me that doesn't fully grasp Lost Abbey's approach here. It seems like some sort of weird middle ground between Flanders Red and American Wild. They've eschewed convention by making it more sour, so why not eschew convention some more and make it the best beer it can be? I guess that's what they did with Double Cherry Red Poppy."
"Had this recently in bottle format and WOW! What an amazing beer! I will say as a disclamer that I am not a ""sour beer"" guy but I found this to be a very approachable beer to the average craft beer consumer. The poppys left a distinct yet balenced aroma and flavor that lingered on the tongue pleasently as the sour notes fade from the pallet. The price for a bottle is in the ""premium"" category to be sure, but it is well worth it and I look forward to re-visiting this fantastic beer soon."
"All in all, this is very well balanced. The spice in the conclusion plays very well with that Flanders tart cherry/amontillado vibe. A top notch American take!"
"Feels soft, smooth, and is easy to drink. I like this beer quite a bit, and am glad I have more bottles."
"Pours a nice reddish brown with a nice frothy white head that dissipates quickly. Thick but not too syrupy or anything. Smells tart and sour. TONS of cherry on the nose and some subtle oak and vanilla. Tastes sweet and tart. Lots of cherry with a solid funk that really rounds out the beer. I'm really pleased with this one. Well carbonated. Tasty, just sour enough. Overall a great brew"
"O: Overall, a great example of the style. Though I must say Im sort of getting lost in Flanders type sours. I cant exactly say what would make this one stand out in the crowd. Given the price and availability of this beer, I cant see seeking it out again in the midst of other ""off the shelf"" Flanders options available to me. Still, a great beer in its own right."
"reddish-brown (with orange highlights?), tan head. not tons of lace or retention, but wasn't really expecting much. nose has a huge cherry presence that seems to be amped up by the vanilla flavors coming from the wood. lots of fruit, leather, wood, some vinegar and vanilla seem to dominate to me. taste is all of the above with some bretty notes mixing with the cherry seamlessly, and coming off in very good balance. sweet and sour and earthy, just like i like them. medium body. almost silky. good clean finish. well carbonated with a tingling sensation as it hits the palate. overall, very, very good. the price hurts, but good things take time, and that is where the high price tag comes from I suppose. wonderful beer. highly recommended."
"Notes: A tasty brew, but not quite as exciting as I was hoping. I think it leans a little too dark cherry for me. Would prefer a brighter, ""red-er"" cherry flavor. And I know you shouldn't judge a beer by the name, but ""Red Poppy"" makes me think it will be lighter and more floral than it is...just sayin'."
"Very dry, again. Finishes light but full of carbonation and action. A live beer. I am extraordinarily impressed by this Flanders Oud Bruin, and would seek this out whenever I could."
"Overall- Great beer. It just falls a little short in the Sour Brown Cherry notes category. I could smell it all day however!"
"O - For $16? Are they nuts? While it's a good beer, it's certainly not worth that in the least. Decent and drinkable but hardly worth getting again, for me anyway."
"This beer pours a dark and dirty creek water brown. It has a billowing three finger beige colored, frothy head that resembles that of a rootbeer float. It smells of both sweet and sour cherries. It has a superb tartness. The flavors are sweet and tart simultaneously. The cherry flavors are pretty complex and superbly crafted for the style. This is instantly one of the best Flanders Oud Bruins that I've tried to date. The finish is both dry and sticky. Overall this beer is phenomenal. It has great flavor and isn't vinegar ridden like some FOB can be. I greatly recommend this one."
"I shared this with friends a week ago, review from notes. The bottle was split into 3 snifters, bright red color, very effervescent head. The aroma is full of tart cherries, hints of oak. The cherries are up front, pleasant amount of tartness, notes of sweet vinegar, oak. It has a crisp tart finish. The body is light, high carbonation, acidic mouthfeel. A great beer, worth the high pricetag."
"O- This is a very flavorful beer. Its a little to pricey for me, but I really enjoyed this one. I still have one more, but I will be holding it back for a while."
"The more I drink Flanders Oud Bruns the more I love them and this is a hell of an example, my second favorite lost abbey beer to date."
"Narrative: They huddled in the cold dark holding cell, awaiting release ""You number 34724?"" A tense overseer inquires. He nodded with trepidation, awaiting the release, and at just that moment the cork gateway was opened, releasing him and his cherry bretheren, sour and full of misgivings upon the awaiting masses. ""DONT GET CAUGHT ON THE FRONT LINE, WE ARENT HERE FOR SWEET"" He had been told this many times, the initial sweet sentry tastebuds fell effortlessly under his tart scimitar. With an aerialists grace he imparted sweet blood on the front gates of the toungegrounds, charging directly to the back. This smash and grab had been rehearsed time and time again within the confines of his 6 month conditions, directly to the bitter, hit the sour and escape. With rote skill and a pike jump the bitter taste faction was seamlessly integrated, their sensory necks broken, neurons lithely hitting the ground as the tary cherry warrior continued his flay into the dark abyss. His job was done. The tart was communicated and his purpose was served."
"Overall this is one hell of a beer. I have never been into sours and never got the hype but this beer has me believing. Thank you lost abbey for a very enjoyable brew."
"Overall a very nice, solid beer, but not for the price."
"Boy oh boy am I glad that I have a few more of these because I know that they are only going to be better better with some age. This was a real treat for me today and was a perfect dessert for my Easter dinner. When it comes to sours this is where it is at, a great balance between tart and sweet and dry refreshing flavors. This is one of those beers I am going to say that you need to try and hunt down and fast! Go! Leave now and good luck on your search because when it hits the shelf's it usually is sold out quick. Maybe you can find a generous beer trader out there somewhere"
"O: Overall very tasty with a nice tartness. It definitely will kill the sour craving. Very nice."
"All in all, a very good, well-made beer. But the steep price tag doesn't really make this a practical purchase IMO. It needs to be genuinely world class to warrant $13.99 for a 375ml -- and while good, this ain't world class."
"Overall: I love sour cherries and well-done American wild ales, so I love this beer. Delivers exactly what it should."
"O: For a beer that is priced in this range I would hope for something nearly flawless. The metallic flavor in this beer, at this price point is unacceptable, and I know this is not an isolated incident, as I've had this beer twice and have noticed this in each bottle. I really like the flavors, and think it would be in the top tier of American Oud Bruins if not for the off flavor on the finish. An enjoyable, but frustrating offering from Lost Abbey."
"Mouthfeel is acidic but not harsh. It's very sour, but in a good way, and your mouth never feels like it's being attacked. I like that after the tartness fades, your mouth is almost as good as new; some sours will leave your cheeks devoid of moisture and tissue, but not this one. Drinkability is aided by this, along with the refreshing nature of the cherries in each sip. A tiny droplet is enough to bring about the sour beginning to the beer, and that's good since the beer is so expensive. Well worth it in my opinion though."
"I enjoyed this beer. I'm very new to sours and really still never know what to expect. Don't think it lived up to the hype it brings, but still an enjoyable beer."
"Pours a opaque light cola brown with an old gold coloration at the rim. Lightly carbonated though the bottle was a bit of a gusher. Nose has a heavy scent of red wine vinegar, tart cherry, a touch of vanilla as well as a healthy dose of barnyard funk. The taste is very clean if a bit one dimensional. The funk is gone and replaced by bright tart acidity, vinegar and a small whiff of cherry. Very drinkable and refreshing, could see it pairing well with a nice cheese plate."
"What a bland beer. Nothing about it stands out for me at all. For such a highly rated ale I'm not sure what the fuss is about."
"D/O: split a bottle; more sour than anticipated"
"Pours a deep brown with slight reddish hues. Slightly pink offwhite head that persists throughout. The head has decent lacing, but this beer quickly settles as I swirl it around the glass. The very fizzy head reveals a tart cherry, slight vinegar, oak, and acidic aroma. Some apples and leather in the nose as well. This is actually one fantastic smelling beer, which is why I was slightly disappointed with the flavor. Tart cherries, oak, vinegar, barnyard funk, and slight sugary sweetness. Very sour beer. Almost feels as though the flavor is a bit held back. Finishes with a rather unpleasant stale/rotten apple funkiness. Very well carbonated and dry on the palate. Not a bad sour overall, but I can think of several similar beers I would rather purchase."
"O: Well this one turned out to kind of a dud. Nothing horrible but nowhere near a great flanders."
"O: All in all, this is a good sour. For not being a sour guy, I enjoy this. Definitely try if you like the style. If you're not a sour fan, but open to it, try this if you have access."
"o - Overall a nice sour flanders I enjoyed. I loved the nose, as there was a lot of sour dark fruit, especially tart cherries. The taste was a lot of vinegar so if you like that in a sour, you'll probably love this one. I liked the Double Red Poppy better, but considering that is a beer only available on tap and this is easy to acquire, it's still very good. Would certainly have it again."
"Out of a corked and caged 375ml bottle and into a small snifter. The ale appears a slightly murky crimson brown color with two fingers of light tan foam. Aromas and flavors consist of cherry, plum, oaky vanilla, a mild citric pucker, light roasted grain, mild vinegar, nice and quenching. The Bruin is amply carbonated with a medium body and a lingering and pleasing sour, fruity twang. Very nice overall."
"D- Overall, very tasty. 12.7oz disappear way too quickly. The acidity combined with dark cherry makes this a very thirst-quenching brew. I'm definitely going to seek this out again to have a few bottles for the cellar."
"O: Really nice Oud Bruin, very excellent beer."
"All around a great beer, very nice for the style."
"D - Pretty good. Not much experience in this style but very similar imo to The Dissident. Easy drinking if you can get pass the sour, vinegar like taste. No problem finishing this bottle by myself. Would seek or buy again. Would like to see how this is with some age on it."
"O - I enjoyed this, but was hoping for much more. Initially I thought it would be a challenge to Oude Tart, but doesn't come anywhere close. Still, it scratched my Oud Bruin itch nicely!"
"This beer was worth the wait, I am not even a fan of sour ales but this one far beyond any I've had in the passed. Really nice!"
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. This beer is nice in the fact that it uses a good amount of cherries and has a high sourness to it. Not sure if it's worth $15, but it is tasty."
"O: I was really impressed by this. It has great balance between sourness and other tastes. I've had a bunch of sours I hated, not this one."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall its almost a perfect beer. Opened this one too cold, but was too afraid that it was going to gush out."
"A pretty good beer overall. I'm expanding my palate into the style and hope to develop a better impression for the sour branch of beers. This one's a little pricey for a 12.7 ounce bottle IMO."
"Oily mouthfeel, leaving a nice resonance. Very nice, mellow and a great symbol within the style."
"Pours a hazy, nearly opaque chocolate brown with a VERY thick tan head. The sample I got fizzed like crazy, so beware when you first pour it! Aroma is strongly oaky with malty and fruity hints and more than a bit of sweetness. Flavor has a strong oaky alcohol bite and some fruity and malty cherry tones - definitely a hint of cherry in there. Texture is fierce, attacking the tongue like a pit bull - this beer is not for the faint of heart or taste buds. This beer is intended to be sipped slowly and savored, like brandy."
"Overall- A beautiful representation of this style, and it was a great beer overall. Good job Lost Abbey."
"This was a treat and this is kick ass beer. Glad to have tried it. But if I can pick up 3 750's of Rodenbach Grand Cru which is imported mind you, what decision do you think im going to make between the two, even though I prefer this because of the absence of vinegar."
"This is one expensive beer, so savor it. Is it worth the price tag? Each person will have to decide that on their own. I personally think it is worth it in small quantities. This is one to save for that perfect moment in which you want to immerse yourself in a beer. I have another bottle that I'm going to age to see how it changes. Awesome."
"Pours murky ruddy brown with off white head that fades to leave chunky lacing. Smells of cherries, brettomyces, vinegar, malt, cider. Taste is sour cherry, citric, malt, white wine. Mouth feel is medium dry, carbonation is medium, drinkability is high. Overall a good bruin, but doubtful worth the pricetag."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. The carbonation is very fine though, and makes for a nice mouthfeel. This is a beer that I have been wanting to try for a while, and it didn't disappoint. I have a few more of these, and am interested to see how they will age. I've heard that this beer is better fresh, so we'll see."
"O- Wonderful flavors and something I would enjoy drinking except for the price"
"O: this is a great Oud Bruin. Nice balance of sour and sweet, the oak fits in nice, lots of depth and overall delicious. The price seems a bit high on this one but worth a try."
"O- there is a lot of flavor packed into this little (5% ABV) beer. ill check this one out again if a special occasion arises before its gone form the shelf. at almost $17 a bottle, its a little cheap for every day consumption."
"O: Great Flanders Bruin, but I would prefer it with a hint of age on it. The cherries are delightful, but stomping on a lot of those other subtle complexities. Great Barrel aged brew, one that I would love to revisit in years to come."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a large cream (off-white) head that doesn't look like it's goin anywhere soon. Amazing head on this beer. Scent is funky to say the least. Huge funk aroma coming from this along with red wine vinegar and cherries. This beer smells absolutely fantastic! Taste is just as fantastic! This is one freakin amazing beer! Sorry for all the exclamation marks, I just wasn't expecting to like this beer so much. This beer has so much oak flavor to it, it's ridiculous. Tons of oak and a hint of tart cherries with a bit of vanilla. Some great funky flavors throughout with red wine vinegar. Mouthfeel is nice and refreshingly dry, but not overly dry. Very acidic. Drinkability is very high... I'm wishing I picked up more than just two bottles of this, but Amorosa but a fat dent in my wallet. Overall, this beer is phenomenal. I wish I had more."
"overall: this beer is fantastic!!!"
"Definitely a well crafted beer from Port/Lost Abbey. Just wish I was a bigger fan of sour ales."
"I really like the taste and feel of this one. Sourness doesn't overpower the malts, fruit is well blended. Tartness comes on strong on the finish and doesn't let you forget this is a Flanders-style beer. Carbonation and relatively light ABV pay off to make this very refreshing and drinkable. Sure wish I had a 750."
"O/D- Why oh why is this bottle so small and super expensive!? I wish I had much more of this. One tiny bottle kills the wallet but boy am I happy to have tried this one. The flavors in this beer are great. The lightness of the body keeps your tongue screaming for more. Try it if you have some extra cash hanging around."
"O: Well done. Not quite my cup of tea, but a very well done flanders ale."
"Overall, a really nice and flavorful sour ale. I really enjoy the crispness, balance, and really deep cherry notes in here. I could definitely see this being considered overpriced, but I will definitely get this again. Definitely among my favorite Lost Abbey beers."
"Taste - lots of tart and some cherries. Aftertaste of cherries and some residual tartness but fades away very quickly unlike a lot of sours I've had."
"Light bodied and well carbonated. Tingly on the tongue and surprisingly clean, unexpected for this style."
"D: Very approachable ABV and great taste make this a very easy drinker. I could definitely sit back and knock back a few of these. Only downside is the price! $16.99/ 375ml. Crazy..."
"Drinkability - For how expensive this beer was, my glass emptied faster than I wanted. Color me impressed. I will have to get another of these and split it with my brother-in-law. I think he would enjoy the amazing cherry flavor as much as I did. Now to try a Cuvee de Tomme...hopefully that will impress me too!"
"A solid sour. And it is carbonated."
"It's a fairly sour tart beer. I can see a lot of people wanting the sour dialed down but it works for me. I will pick this up again but at $15.99/375 ml it won't be a daily thing."
"2011 Vintage, received in trade with mikedashg. Thanks! Pours a ruby brown color with a big white head that recedes. Carbonation continues to bubble up from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is sour, fruity, cherry, funk, and wine. The body is a little thin on the palate with medium to heavy carbonation. No Flat Abbey here. Flavor is sour, cherry, a little alcohol. The finish is very tart. Not as easy drinking as some others I've had, but an excellent sour ale nonetheless."
"Lost Abbey Red Poppy! I was right when I was comparing it to a Flanders red! Really great stuff. I love the classy label. This was a long time want!"
"I am a big American Wild fan so Flanders Oud Bruin seemed like a good style to branch into. Though my first one was a bit of a miss (Zuur), this one hit the spot. I just wish it wasn't so pricy. I'll grab at least two for the cellar though."
"This beer leans between the lines of a lambic, Flanders red and Oud Bruin - perhaps lacking enough malt presence to remind me of the classics in the Oud Bruin category. Nonetheless, nothing detracted on the score because whatever it is, it's tasty! Real fruity cherries, nice grassy funk with hints of barnyard, chewy wood, light sweetness, full bodied with jumping carb, light lemon-like acidic bite. Both refreshing and flavorful; well made, balanced, and appreciatively drank."
"A great example of the style, and deservedly up with the best. I can't really fault this beer on any count - thanks Eric!"
"D: Great."
"I think this beer needs a little more tweaking to get the flavors integrated a little better. All in all, an enjoyable beer."
"D - This is definitely one of the best sours I've had to date. Red Poppy beautifully blends cherries and oak to create an extremely drinkable and approachable sour beer."
"Edit: the fruit fades in this beer rather quickly so it should be drunk closer to it's release to enjoy it at it's full potential."
"D - This bottle has disappeared a lot quicker than I would have liked. Fantastic cherry flavor and plenty of sourness for me. I really really like this beer. I need to get more of this."
"The beer appears a crimson sunburst hue, with an eighth inch of head that quickly settles to a thin layer and holds. The aroma is fabulous, with funk, cherries, wild yeast, and oak. The taste follows suit, and makes my cheeks pucker in delight upon the first sip. Insanely good, I want to trade for more of this immediately. The finish contains a healthy dose of vinegar and acetic notes, but is no way harsh. Quite the opposite, I wish I had a growler of this. My new favorite Flanders Oud Bruin."
"D-this has some issues, the cherries are overshadowed by oak and acidity, notes of acetic acid in the finish and some random brett notes make this an overly sour slightly muddled beer."
"D - This is another fabulous beer from The Lost Abbey. I'll liking sour beers more and more each time I try great examples of the style like this one."
"From another bottle. Despite standing upright in a cool cellar for a month, this is muddy, flabby, overly acidic, boring, one dimensional. Why people rate this beer highly is beyond me."
"Served from 2009 bottle into a Surly Darkness snifter. Pours a murky brown with a very small amount of head-like bubbles that fade quickly. Cork made no noise when removed. Uh oh. This stuff looks like flat cola. With lots sediment. Smell is an improvement over appearance, but that isnt saying much. Has the familiar lost abbey wild characteristics, sour lactic acid, a bit spicy, sour cherries in the background. Maybe a hint of yeast as well. Taste is what I remember red poppy tasting like. Very sour with a hint of ripe red cherries, no residual sweetness, mostly just lacto sourness. Mouthfeel is pretty bad. This beer is still, the mouthfeel is medium heavy, and the sourness of the beer gives you the feeling in the back of your throat like you just ate a bag of sour patch kids. Some bubbles would have done wonders for this beer. Drinkability is low too due to the lack of carbonation. This one may end up a drain pour - the mouthfeel kills any potential this beer may have had."
"D - Pretty drinkable, but limited by the sourness. This is a good beer, but not a great beer by any means. It doesn't taste unique or outstanding to me in any way. Compared to other beers, sure, it's better than most, but it's just another sour to me. Certainly not better than the sours from the RR series."
"D: Half of a 375ml bottle was enough for me. This isn't really the type of beer I'd like to have several of in a night. It tasted pretty good, but was not as complex as I would have liked."
"Beer it Forward."
"Great long-lasted head this time. Dryer and more tart with the age, reminiscent of cranberry juice. Puckering and more tannic than when fresh. Definitely an improvement with some age."
"D - This is some awesome stuff I could drink this all day long love the tart flavor if you like sours this is a must hunt down and try beer"
"(D)- A great take on the style. Everything you would expect from the style too, if, with just some hints at a wild ale too. Great taste and aroma. I would like to have more of this please."
"D: very drinkable flanders that is very tasty and very glad to have a stash for future tastings. This one is definitely worth trying or trading for if you don't have access to it."
"Not as sour as I would've liked, but a very drinkable sour. I feel like it just holds back a little too much on the flavor and sourness, but still a very good beer."
"Medium consistency and a very low level of carbonation. The sourness is not too overwhelming and really lets the beer's own characteristics shine through. To me, I could drink this as an everyday sour if it were more accessible."
"Bottle. 2009 vintage. Pours a murky reddish brown mahagony color with really no head. Pops with very little fanfare just a little ""pop"". What head there is is just a wispy white head. Really nice sour aroma coming from the nose with a mix of cherries and some oak. Lots of lemon in the nose as well. The taste starts off subtle then builds to a nice level of sourness with hints of lemon and cherries. Some acetone type flavors as well. One of the most sour I have had in a while. The sourness really lingers on this one. Light mouthfeel."
"average of reviews."
"as a sour it is the most balanced... sours, typically hit me ad dont finish well, but this one really does."
"D: Dry, acidic, and actually quite refreshing. Gonna need a drink of water after this one."
"D: Another what-could've been beer from Lost Abbey. Properly carbonated, I'd think that this beer would be much better than its already-above-average-but-flat incarnation. Good subtle but dense flavor has nice complexity that carbonation might serve to separate well. Also, may spice up a mouthfeel that is a bit lifeless at times."
"Plenty tart but not super sour, seems like barrel aging at its finest! Balances the sour, wood and fruity tartness perfectly. Little bit of brettomyces comes through...WOW, this is incredible. I knew I shouldnt have shared this! I could drink one of these every day till the day I died, easily one of the top 5 beers I have ever had. In fact, I feel my review suffers because I didnt even want to put my glass down to write anything while enjoying the experience."
"Drinkability is hard to beat (although you'll probably want a glass of water to wash down the dryness after you finish it). Can't taste the alcohol too much, and clocking in at only 5% I could drink a whole lot of this. A 750ml bottle would suit this beer much much much better. Overall a lovely tasting drink but it just needs a little kick, lacks something: perhaps a beefier abv, a touch of sourness, one more of this or a hint more of that and this brew would be stellar."
"One of the better American versions of the style I've tried. I'd prefer a little more tartness but if you like the European versions like Rodenbach then this one is worth a shot. Just be aware it's a little more subdued."
"Brisk and refreshing with enough oaky complexity to sustain your interest. I wish I could get a 750mL bottle of this for the price, but this is a great domestic example of the style in any case."
"Edit: I just had this on draft at the brewery... it was a much different beer. It wasn't quite as tart and had a much spicier taste. It almost tasted like a sour version of pumking."
"The beer is light bodied, well carbonated and just balanced enough to not be too-sour. The low abv compliments the flavors well, and the dry finish and tartness of the beer invite further drinking. This is a good beer that I will definitely seek out in the future."
"Unnecessary side note: a milk stout tastes weird after two oud bruins."
"On deck for later tonight are a BBQ and a Flying Mouflan-- but I'm afraid this one will overshadow the others! Absolutely a great beer"
"The aroma is vinegary and oaky, with a touch of grape, berries, and cherries with non coming out on top. In the taste, the cherries do win the fruit battle, bringing a rich accent to the malty, funky, vinegar flavors. The mouthfeel is thick and slick, with a low carbonation and a little bit of astringency. I would have liked a cripser cherry flavor, with more lactic acid and a higher carbonation, but this is what the style is so I can't really complain too much."
"Draft at Memphis Tap Room Meet the brewer night on 2/23/10. Pours dark burgundy with very little head. Aroma of fig, prune, along with some cherry and dry earth. Just a hint of sweetness in the flavor, then an incredible sour cherry citrus. This was so incredibly balanced and not overpowering. Very clean feel with a nice aftertaste. Even without the head, lively carbonation on the tongue. Definitely glad I got to try this one!"
"Drinkability: Well, aside from: 1) the complete lack of carbonation; and 2) the odd blob of yeast that remained intact and was floating around on the surface of this one, somewhat scarily, this seems like it was a pretty good beer - well-made (substance-wise, not process-wise), low in alcohol, and refreshing. I think I have a friend with a 2010 bottle, so I hope to have the opportunity to review it in the spirit it was intended."
"One of the best beers in town at the moment. Worth every penny!"
"2010 vintage. The beer pours a slightly hazy brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is tart with some oak, vanilla, brown sugar and cherry. The flavor is heavy on the tart cherries with some oak and lemons mixed in as well. There is also a nice sweetness that resembles brown sugar. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An excellent beer. So happy I got to try this one."
"D: This is an excellent Oud Bruin, clearly well made and full of flavour. It's so ridiculously expensive, Rodenbach Grand Cru is 1/3 of the price, so not something I'll buy again unless it's on-tap."
"Overall, a very solid shot at an oud bruin from Lost Abbey. I'm generally very impressed by the sours I've had of theirs and this one didn't disappoint."
"375ml bottle of what looks to be the 2010 edition since it is the new style of bottle that LA and RR have been using. Thanks to mattolesh for hooking this up. It gushed a bit upon opening and had a super huge head. I have to ding the appearance because I got a ton of sediment all throughout this beer that was kind of chunky. The smell was sour cherry-like, not bad at all. The taste had some muted cherry qualities, dirty, funkiness a bit, and a good sour twang. This was not bad at all but compared to some of the other LA sours I was a little disappointed."
"Absolutely delicious. It's incredibly sour when first sipped, but has a warmer and sweeter aftertaste. Very pleasant to drink. It's foggy and dark red, almost resembling pomegranate juice in the glass. It doesn't look very carbonated, but was surprisingly bubbly."
"Drinkability is pretty good, not something you want to drink quickly, it's a nice sipper. Another quality beer from the Lost Abbey."
"Dark reddish brown color wth a small creamy head. Aroma is a pungent lactic character and cherries. The flavor is equally grand with sour tart cherries and a subtle complex mixture of vanilla, carmel, oak aged character. A very enjoyable sour ale that leaves you craving more!"
"O: This is a tasty beer - kind of a mix between Supplication and Duchesse de Bourgogne. Not sure how much more pronounced the cherries would have been fresh but they are still evident. Another solid sour from the crew at L.A."
"If you have crow's feet, they'll get a workout with this one. While this seems to be more or less true to the style, it's not something I really could say I enjoyed. Certainly a departure from what most people think of when they hear the word ""beer""."
"Flavor is tart, crisp, carbonated, fruity, tons of vinegar sharpness...and booze is a non-factor. Light and crisp mouthfeel...not complex. Not the best Flanders out there, sweetness is lacking...but completely delish at the same time! Oveall, a great beer from Lost Abbey!"
"Tart Tongues, rejoice! Red Poppy Ale is, without a doubt, outstanding beer. If you see it, pick it up."
"D - The beer is quite good, but without a doubt overpriced. So drinkability is less than perfect."
"Taste of a great strong tartness / sour cherry , brown sugar, oak barrels and vinegar. There is a high level of carbonation from champagne yeast I presume, and a thicker than I was expecting mouthfeel. This is great stuff, unfortunately only 12.7 oz which is all too easy to drink. I like being able to get a smaller sized bottle, just can hope it will one day be more readily available."
"D - a wonderfully crafted brew...simple, yet elegant. has all the characteristics of the style and pulls them off. just wish it didnt leave my mouth feeling like sandpaper, though i cant stop sipping it."
"D - Not super hard to drink, but between the weight and the not-sweet-sour it's one that is easy to put down."
"Highly drinkable and refreshing , but does have a high $"
"very well done. not too much of anything, anywhere. tons of flavor and complexity, but balanced. cost could be a bit less, and this would be a 5.0."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and the present carbonation compliments the beer nicely. it is pretty dry which I really like and allows a mouth puckering beer to be drank without much palette fatigue."
"Overall, this is ok, nothin spcial for an oud bruin, decent American effort."
"D: It's not bad, but if I had to pick a sour beer based on cherries, I'd go with Supplication or LP Kriek first, especially at $17 for 375mL. I know they're not technically the same style, though."
"Note- reviewing this does not do it justice. If you ever get a chance to try this beer, it will be in your favor."
"D: Pretty low points for me too much for me in the back of the throat."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is high. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice sour flavor to it. I've said before though that I'm very impartial to cherries, I just love them. Adding real cherry flavor to anything is a positive thing to me."
"Red Poppy Ale by Lost Abbey is a Flanders Oud Bruin style beer and 5.5%. It is a brown ale brewed with sour cherries and aged in oak barrels for over 6 months. It poured a beautiful copper red with a pinky full of a white head. It smelled of citrus, sour cherries and a hint of barnyard funkiness- kind of a one note nose. It tasted like dried sour cherries, Brett, and vinegar. The sour cherriness was pretty well balanced."
"A fantastic sour. Solidly drinkable. Reminds me of a lighter bodied Supplication or Cuvee de Tomme, but still tons of flavor for the abv."
"Cheers."
"Thanks to Ratman for a taste of this one. To state up front, I'm not really a fan of sours, so I approached this one with a bit of trepidation. Poured into a tulip of some sort, reddish brown, with a bit of carbonation. On the nose, I picked up red wine vinegar, oak and some tartness, but oddly (?) not a whole lot of cherry. This one was a bit funky on the palate; not a whole lot of sour going on, and somewhat lacking in cherry flavor. Again, not a huge sour fan, but this one seemed a bit restrained, almost a ""training wheels"" type of beverage. Pretty good, and one I'd love to try again."
"2009 vintage. Pours a hazy orange tinted cider color with negligible head nor Belgian lacing. I would have scored it lower if not for the foggy residue swirling about that caught my attention. The smell is full on aggressive malt vinegar (where's my Arthur Treachers?) over sour cherries and dark grapes. The flavor and feel merge into an immediate bright tart burst that's notches shy of 'puckering'. Taste is a good mix of grape and cherries. The texture is light body cleans up quickly...almost dry, but the fruitiness lingers nicely. It's not flat, but the carbonation is hidden beneath the zip from the sour character. A reasonable drinker. Really glad that i had the opportunity to consider it...many thanks to bmanning."
"D: amazingly drinkable, very mellow, approachable sour, cannot wait to have another"
"Dangerously drinkable! At least IMHO... Very pleasant to me, and I think I could down this like a non-alcoholic soda/juice even though I prefer to enjoy it slowly over time."
"D: I enjoyed this quite a bit... reminiscent of consecration and la folie... not quite as good as consecration, but probably better than la folie. Would like to see this one with some age on it."
"D= Nice sour. Not over the top or crazy at all but still really nice sour. Delicious."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and it has a nice playful carbonation. Drinkability is good as there is no alcohol flavor or harshness. Nicely done."
"HV"
"Glad I got a chance to try this. Not many made in USA like it."
"D: 2010 is drinking nicely. 2009 is still a tasty beer, just not as good as the new release."
"Pours to a cherry cola toned reddish brown body. Head is just a skim of rich tan foam. Nose has a nice creamy tartness with ripe cherry tones, cola and minerals with some zest. Enters the mouth with a sharp tart tone that is cherry skins. This tartness quickly mellows with mice dark maltiness that really balances the brew. Dark fruit follows all this with some accompanying tannins. Mouthfeel is thick and tart especially on the very back of the tongue. This beer is especially under carbonated. Overall it is nicely drinkable."
"D: Good beer but did not knock my socks off. The sour tart flavor is definitly not to my palate. If you are into trying somwthing very new, Red Poppy ale is the one."
"Red Poppy is an interesting enough beer, that could stand to be a little more effervescent."
"D: This is one of the more tart Oud Bruins I've had, but I enjoy that. The lower level of acetic acid is also a bit plus for me."
"Strong sour flavor, again citric. There are several late flavors, sweet, strong tart, hits me in the corners of my mouth. Drinkability is high, mouthfeel is good. Carbonation plays a role in the connectivity of the beer overall."
"The real downside for me is the low carbonation. Lost Abbey's struggles with carbonation have been well documented in their strong beers, but their sour beers have usually been fine. In this case I'm guessing it's the age, and it really doesn't hurt the drinking experience all that much. The light body seems to suit the style, very drinkable. This will be on my eternal wants list, and I'll actively trade for it each year it's released."
"Nice to try but would probably not get this again."
"3.5/4.5/4.5/4/4.5"
"D: Very good."
"Peter FM had a bottle, and after 3.3 years it stands the taste of time. Great sor finish."
"D: Quite drinkable. Fairly complex."
"Not bad, but definitely not my favorite. While I enjoy a good sour, this one is a little heavy on the lactic acidity without much else to back it up."
"Luckily a Flanders Red can still be somewhat enjoyed with no carbonation. Poured a murky red into my snifter followed by a slight fizz head that vanished as soon as it formed. Smelled pretty wonderful. Cherries, cider vinegar, and oak. Taste was pretty on par for a Flanders, tart cherries, wood, a little sourness and funk. Mouthfeel was a little lacking for obvious reasons, but the drinkability was pretty on point. If it would of had some carbonation it would have carried it alot more."
"Drinkability: Drinks above the ABV in flavor, and really very similar to something like Cuvee de Tomme, except with less hints of booze. Sourness is light enough to drink a good amount, as is the ABV, but the flavors do run together a bit by the end. Still, an excellent little sour that if more readily available probably would have a few purchased of it, but with La Folie being half the cost and infinitely more available, I'd probably stick with it first."
"Very good beer from Lost Abbey. This might be the sole purchase I make at their brewery this upcoming year, as it's one of the better Flanders ales that I've ever had."
"Amazing at turkey day dinner. Pours a murky brown red with minimal head. Lacing is ecxellent smells like fresh cherries. So ripe and delicious the sour level is huge and bLanced. One of my all time favorites from la. The levels of sourness is amazing I think lost abbey hAs a winner with this one."
"Good drinkability and a very well crafted beer. Only complaint was lack of carbonation. While there was a very small amount of carbonation present, a little more would have really added to this beer."
"First time was an A, second was a B. Overall I'll give it a low A-."
"A very nice take on a Flanders Oud Bruin by Lost Abbey. I would have liked a little more complexity in the taste, but overall I found it to be pretty solid. The availability and price tag is certainly a down side however."
"D - Drinkability is pretty good. The flavors work well together and the alcohol is almost completely hidden. It's very tart but also very smooth. This beer could be something very very special if not for one glaring problem. Even with a little carbonation, this one would be excellent. As is, it's still pretty good but that's about all that can be said."
"D: Drinking nice and easy though not quite as much as a lighter sour."
"Red Poppy was superb. Ample flavor here, but the biggest components are Oak, cherry and vinegar notes. The flavor is a fun balance of sweet and sour. I had multiple samples of this, Cuvee de Tomme, and Duck Duck Gooze. This was my least favorite of the three, but that is a reflection of how incredible the other two were. I would love to get my hands on a bottle of this, it was one tasty brew."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. The sourness, although intense leaves a refreshed feeling but also keeps it from being something to drink multiples of because you no longer have a palate."
"Just an amazing beer. Great oak notes follow the thick sour mouth puckering entry and middle. Full of tart fruits and berries cherry leading the way a nice acidic character on the finish and middle. Mouth is round and puckering and a beer I could sip on daily if available."
"Drinking a 2010 bottled version fresh and just wanted to comment a bit on it. The abv is lowered to 5% and it is not near as sour. I have heard many people enjoy this fresh, but I say to put some age on it. It develops more of a vinegar flavor but gets a lot more sour. The nose on this starts out odd, but then gets better as it warms. Not as sour as it turns out to be."
"Re-sampled in 2012, courtesy of bobertkuekn, and found the carbonation problems to be corrected - upping the Appearance and Mouthfeel scores, as a result"
"Poured a 375ml into my oversized Dogfish Head snifter. To start with, this has to be one of the sexiest bottles I have ever had the pleasure of looking at. This beer pours a muddy garnet with just a wisp of of a head leaving no lacing. I poured this pretty hard to try to work up a head but alas, nothing. Along with no head came no lacing. The aroma is amazing. Tart pie cherries up front, balsamic vinegar, oak, and a wicked lactic tartness. The flavor matches and exceeds the taste. Simply marvelous. Huge tart pie cherries and balsamic vinegar push up front but leaving enough room for fresh oak, lactic tang, and a sublte sweetness that lingers on the palate at the finish of the taste. The mouthfeel is exceptional. Just a light carbonation that prickles the tongue, leaving the palate slightly dry and craving another sip. This beer is exceptional."
"If it weren't so difficult to obtain, I could see myself making this a staple."
"D: Good, but not fantastic. I've come across many comments about this one comparing it to a lambic, but too me, it is more of a sour, fruit-infused Oud bruin than a fruit lambic (which is what it's categorized as on this site). It's not as complex as some of the better comparable Belgians, but still a very impressive beer. Nice bland of tartness, barrel character and fruit flavors."
"Drinkability: For a tart sour and dry brew its fairly drinkable."
"Overall, probably the best flanders I have ever had. Ignore the low marks for appearance, those are meaningless. This is a phenomenal beer and one I wish I had access to."
"Overall, very tasty and something for sourheads to try, though you may want to grab a friend to share this with. Hopefully by the time the 2010 batch is released Lost Abbey will have sorted out the carbonation problems that have plagued it this entire year."
"The mouthfeel is just not lively enough for the style... This has SOME carbonation, but simply not enough..."
"Overall this was a very good representation of the style and one I'm happy to have tried."
"Good example of the style though."
"I can't say that I find this completely drinkable, I continue to try and develop a taste for this style. You can tell this was a very good beer and I was happy to have the chance to try it."
"So unless you have a Cantillon or some other sour worthy of standing up to the tartness of the Red Poppy, this is your beer for the evening."
"The taste is much different from what I anticipated based off of the smell. Very acetic and a little bit vinous. There is a very well executed taste of vinegar which plays well with the high level of acidity. Mouth puckering tart sour cherries mixed with sour apples. The mouthfeel is relatively thin and is very sharp with the high level of carbonation. All in all, a little bit sweet, incredibly sour, and a fairly subdued oaky flavor all combine to make this beer a top choice for a flanders red. I could easily have continued to drink this beer all night."
"Lost Abbey is hit or miss with me and lately they've been a huge miss. Red Poppy managed to raise my opinion of them again. They can make a good beer when they show some effort and Red Poppy is one of the examples. Thanks for the bottle Bill, I really enjoyed this one!"
"My first time with Red Poppy. Overall, I hought it was pretty good. The QC issues definitely continue with this one. Would try again once LA has their act together."
"I could use more of the oxidization that I love in Red Poppy's Belgian counterparts, but this is excellent stuff nonetheless."
"When this beer is fresh, it has a wonderful cherry flavor, nice level of acidity and sourness that compliments the fruit notes. Carbonation is appropriate (spritzer-like at times), and with a low ABV, red poppy is pleasantly drinkable. I look forward to trying future batches."
"Although the Red Poppy is definitely sour to the last drop, it is at the same time very drinkable. While drinking this all night might make me slightly stoopid, I would definitely enjoy it! It's certainly a sipper though -- 1 12.5oz bottle took the 3 of us a full 20 minutes to finish off, at which point we all started wondering where we could find more."
"Very drinkable except for the flatness."
"I think this brew could probably age extremely well. It needs some time to let the funkiness set in and give it more of a complex taste. It's only downfall in my mind was the taste, but like I said, time might cure that."
"Overall this is definitely one of the best examples of the style that is brewed inside US borders. Not alot of solid oud bruins being made on our soil, but this is one of them. If the carbonation could be modified slightly this beer would be that much better. This is no cuvee de tomme, but it is a great example of the style and a well crafted beer."
"Drinkability: Would be much better with at least some carbonation; but I appreciate seeing so much flavor in a 5% ABV beer."
"Drinkability= I probably wouldn't have more than two at one sitting. I can't put it down long enough to warm up though! The smell, the appearance and taste tells me, red wine. The finish on the palate tells me, beer. Very interesting. Glad I got to try this beer."
"Poured into a tulip a brownish color, not much carbonation at all, tiny fizzy off-white head, if any, basically not much sticky lacing. The nose is malty, soury, cherries, slight spice. The taste is malty, pretty soury, cherries, and some spice. Medium body. Drinkable, even though not much carbonation, it still is tasty, thanks Bill."
"Pours light brown with a faint touch of red into a champagne flute. A very minute amount of head, almost none. Lots of dark cherry's, raspberry's, fig's, plum's on the nose with a bunch of tart mixed in...sweet yet tart, pretty interesting. Lots of tart and oak on the palate, really great. Mouthfeel is light in body, very little carbonation (I could use a bit more). I really like this one...a winner, in my opinion. Will drink again, 100%. Wish there was more carbonation, which hurt the mouthfeel & drink."
"D-This beer is awesome. I love it. Its a bit pricey; but well worth it (if I lived somewhere where it were available). My first of the special Lost Abbey Releases and it makes me want to find and try more of them. Very well done and perfectly drinkable."
"Another fantastic offering from Tomme, Really grew on me as it warmed."
"This is definitely a sipper. Its lack of carbonation and dryness affect its drinkability."
"Flavor is tart sour with notes of vanilla. Finishes very dry."
"As noted before, mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, with a nice acidic bite in the top/back of the throat, and a smooth, round body."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I highly recommend. I find Lost Abbey beers to be major hit or major miss and this one is a major hit. Wish I could get some of it but was lucky to get this so will have to keep searching for it. If available here, I'd drink several of these a year."
"Pours a murky brown with some purple, amber, and garnet highlights with the thinnest possible ring of head to distinguish the off-white color. Almost no retention but some spotty lacing. Smells very fragrant of sour cherries, along with wafts of earth, dry oak, and sugar. Taste starts out with loads of tart sour cherries that lasts the whole time. Some dank earth notes along with some oak and vanilla come into play as well as a light brown sugar sweetness. Medium in body with very very low carbonation, but with an acidity that seems to help give this beer a little bit of a pop feel. Very tart and sour, but not over abundantly sour, quite drinkable. I just wish the carbonation issue was fixed."
"Pours a rusty color that is quite hazy and not too pretty to look at. Smells of beautiful funk as I enjoyed the heavenly aroma for minutes longer than usual. ""Red Poppy...You have my attention!"" First sip is puckering sour that wakes the glands deeply from hibernating inactivity - I'm impressed. The taste is best described as chomping into an engineered hybrid fruit created equally from apricots, cherries and lemons. This is a clean sourness that bites you hard but with complete control. Red Poppy is in charge here...yes sir! I am only its lunch and I'm grateful Red Poppy picked me to attack. Mouthfeel is over the top. It first appears to be under carbonated, probably from its oak barrel rest - and it is. Then the beverage organizes like a Chicago teachers union and stomps the tongue with sourness like there's no tomorrow. The lowly 5.5% ABV tastes like a high gravity 10%'er and I am lovin' it!"
"Red Poppy is excellent beer. Given the rash of recent Lost Abbey criticism, I approached this one with a little caution. But, it easily lives up to the hype on its own merit. There's a whole lot to love here. What really stands out is its finesse. It has a very refined, excellent flavor and has minimal flaws. Yeah, it's a little dry and could use more body. But, I'm really grasping for straws. The flavor flat out rocks. Find a bottle."
"It has an increaibly dark reddish-brown color with lots of dark red coming through. I even have what looks like a chunk of a cherry flaoting around in my glass...ill make sure to fish it out at the end. The taste is awesome. It's got a nice balance between sourness and maltiness, the latter coming through more in the end. It will be interesting to see how this ages."
"Smell, taste, and drinkability...copy my notes from the 2009 but the carbonation definitely added some zip both to look and mouthfeel and the foam gave me some very nice lacing. The incredibly excellent Red Poppy just got kicked up a few notches!!"
"Overall impression: This is a very drinkable beer - frighteningly so consider the price! A good example of an American sour, but I am a bit concerned reading the other reviews that they may have a quality control problem. I didn't see any of the sediment mentioned elsewhere, or have the carbonation problems. Either way - hope they get it straightened out, I've got a lot of money sunk into the Sinners club."
"Given that it is among the most expensive beer out there, this is unacceptable to me. As such, I cannot give this beer anywhere near the ranking I would have given the 2008. It is a shame, because when the stars properly align, Lost Abbey truly does belong in the discussion of the best."
"I wanted to love this, I'll up date my review next time I try this."
"Bottle courtesy of Kegbear: Poured a deep clear reddish color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma of oak and sour cherries are heavily dominating. Taste is also a very nice mix between some deep oak notes with some cherry flavor also discernable. Very complex taste and some what similar to Rodenbach Grand Cru. I thought cherries would have been more prominent but they were somewhat loss in the mix."
"We drank this beer alongside a rabbit terrine that was wrapped in prosciutto and then cut into thick slices and laid down on the plate with a sour cherry marmalade. This was the best pairing of the night and possibly one of the best that I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Perfectly drinkable - not too sour at all, in my opinion. However, the flatness of the whole bottle was definitely a let-down."
"Can't wait until I can obtain a bottle and sit at my house and really pick this beer apart."
"Overall: I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer, but boy did it surprise me! In a good way of course. A great sour that I would I think everyone should enjoy. A must try. Cheers!"
"EDIT: 2.12.11 Getting more into sours, will have to try this one again sometime."
"Drinkability is good but not perfect as you really can't do too many of these back to back if at all."
"Huge thanks to TheBlackMallard for this one!"
"Thanks to srandycarter for trading this beer to me. Looked like a good choice for Valentines Day. Poured this one in to my Deakin University wine glass. Coloration is a beautiful murky dark rose with shades varying in different parts of the glass. Small white lacing for the head, and what looks like tiny bits of yeast sediment all around. Smell is mighty funky, with cherries, lactic acid, and oak. Quite sour, but not overbearing at all. The sour cherries really make themselves known, along with some lemon flavor, and that tiny Oud Bruin sweetness right at the end. Body is light, with no apparent hop profile, and less carbonation than was expected. Some might find this difficult to drink, but I love sour beers, so it was not a problem. Awesome beer from the Lost Abbey, those guys truly are great at what they do. Worthy of the hype in my opinion. An extra cheers to them for going for a style that you do not see all that often."
"I enjoyed this beer's complexity and suppleness. For me the combination of sour/tart/cherry and barrel aged flavor makes this a memorable beer."
"A great representation of the style. I can't believe this stuff comes out of San Marcos. I prefer this vintage to the first, though the Double Cherry Red Poppy is my favorite."
"Thanks for sharing this one!!!"
"There's a bit more funk than I was expecting as well. It seems the cherry aspect of this beer has faded over the course of the last year and has been somewhat muted by the other flavors. Allowing more funk and acidic qualities to come to the forefront."
"Poured a cloudy brown/copper color with no head whatsoever. Aroma is full of sourness and some cherry. Taste is an amazing punch of sourness on the tongue followed by a slightly bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while. Slight carbonation and medium mouthfeel lend this beer an awesome drinkability. I am so excited that I got to try this great sour for the first time."
"Drinkability. I could drink this alot. Will drink many bottles of this. I had last years release and it was not that great but this year is a winner. Glad I went to go pick some up. Thanks Lost Abbey!"
"$20 per 375ml bottle? Ha!"
"not a whole bunch going on... seems as if something is missing. though, it is in no way a bad beer! 7/4/7/4/15/3.7"
"Decent mouthfeel for a flanders style sour beer, but nothing incredible and the drinkability is extremely high. I think this would be a good gateway sour beer, and the only reason I didn't get a refill was to spread it around a little more. There wasn't a ton available. Overall very excellent beer, and will always seek out."
"Reddish brown color with a nice off-white head that retained pretty good. I got some cherries and cherry pits in the aroma, also a fair amount of sourness and maybe a touch of cinnamon. Taste was sour, some cherries, but didn't really do much to impress me. The complexity of the aroma didn't translate as well into the flavor for me. It was enjoyable, but again, it didn't really stand out to me. Fairly light body with medium carbonation. It was good, but I don't think I'll be worrying about getting this again, especially not at the price. Thanks to doubleo for the chance to try it."
"This has great tartness with a lot of depth added by the oak flavor. These two flavors balance each other out and make this rather drinkable. Consider that with the light, unfilling body of Red Poppy and it becomes a beer I could drink all night."
"So this will probably be my last attempt at any ""sour"" beer. I'm sure some people get down with this style but not this guy. I think I'll stick to stouts and IPA's from now on."
"Pours opaque red-brown with a white ring of bubbles. Sour cherry and oak with a nice buttercream and vanilla nose. Taste is a bit the same, but the cherries modulate between sweet and sour, with the sour being very similar to the Tomme. Brown sugar and malt back mixed with the brett to give it a funky finish."
"4.0/5"
"D- Incredibly easy to drink. I was thoroughly depressed when I finished my half of my only 375mL bottle."
"D: Wicked good, the Lost Abbey has nailed this one. Beware the yeasty sediment though, it saps some of the tartness from the ale."
"Drinkability- Right up there with the best Oud Bruins I have had. Not too tart and loads of cherry flavor. Wish I had some cheese to go with it."
"Hazy red/brown color with a minimal white head. Smell was of cherry, oak, fruits and a slight sour funk. Slightly sour, but well balanced and very drinkable. I quite enjoyed it and will do my best to get my share next release.."
"Notes from 3/5/08"
"This is one of the better Flanders ales I've had as it was complex and not overly sour. Very nice."
"I'm used to the Lost Abbey special releases being these huge, over the top beers, so this one came as quite a surprise. A flanders red all the way, but lighter, more delicate, and more refined."
"The nose has a very nice and complex blend of acetic and cherry derived aromas, with red wine vinegar, sour cherries and black raspberries. A robust leather and mildly earthy tone is present, rather umami-like. An excellent nose. The palate is a lot more robustly tart with plenty of vinegar, a blend of balsamic and red wine with a cherry skin tannins tempering and complementing the bright sourness. The cherry fruit itself has fallen off here, all that's left is the fruit pits and skin. Robustly leathery and earthy on the mid-palate, with a little vanilla for respite. There is some lactic acid that's also present, cleaning up on the finish.Light in body with supple tannins, moderate carbonation and cleaning lactic acid character. Not particularly funky, I imagine a blend of HotD Michael (at age 1) and Rodenbach vintage would taste similar. Nowhere close to what it was fresh-ish, but better than more recent batches IMO. Still very well-structured. 4.5/4.5/4/4/4"
"This is a very nice and well crafted offering here. While I understand that this may have lost some of its' cherry freshness from when it was first brewed, the character still seemed quite pungent to me and worked well the Brett to create a mix that was more refreshing tartness than sour. Another tasty work of art from Tomme and company at the Abbey."
"The poured murky burnt red to brown in color with a very thin head that dissipated pretty quickly. The nose showed some funk along with red fruit and spice (cinnamon, pepper). In the mouth it was tart and dirty showing more funk than the nose would suggest along with less fruit. There was a distinct bitterness that began in the midpalate and lingers on. The acidity in the midpalate was very well integrated and overall the midpalate was well balanced but gave way to the bitterness in the finish."
"Overall, a great beer."
"Very dry, medium bodied, it is mostly acidic and sour, with little to no sweet notes. Very good, but at times the wood notes become a little too much. Drinkability is quite low for the style, but still pleasant and flavorful for such a low ABV beer."
"This is one heckuva beer, I think it can be great after another 6 months to a year. I hope Tomme and the Port make this an annual release."
"This one poured a hazy, sort of murky, reddish orange with a smattering of soapy bubbles. A thin, fine cap appeared as CO2 slowly came out of solution and this finally settled into a thin collar. Some spotty, short-lived lacing clung to the glass and there was a slow, steady stream of bubbles rising to the surface throughout. Tart, fruity aroma of freshly picked berries still unwashed, cherry skins and mild vinegar. Quite earthy, with notes of tobacco and musty hay. Some bread and oak were present too. The taste was fruity and tart up front, a mixture of lactic sourness and just a bit of vinegar, with a raspberry quality yet more of a cherry flavour. This gave way to brown sugar and bread, plus a hint of toffee and chocolate towards the end. The occasional flash of vanilla appeared as well. Earthy notes of tobacco and berry skins, with just a bit of oak flavour, added some depth. Lingering, tart finish. Medium bodied with a bit of a sugary texture and lingering dryness from the oak tannins. Carbonation was average, perhaps a little on the high side. Highly drinkable, but definitely worth savouring. Great balance, very enjoyable."
"On tap at Lost Abbey for RBSG. Pours a rusty red-brown with no head. Tons of sediment. Aroma is dead-on apple pie, with an acetic sourness. Flavor is a balance between sweet and sour. Tastes like a caramel covered crab apple. Also some cherry notes in the tartness. Sharp with a mostly dry finish. Undercarbonated, but who cares? Delicious."
"This beer is very nice for the style. It doesn't get as sweet as a few of the well-known examples do, which is key. I am not a fan of the Flanders beers as much as I like more funky lambics, but this beer was very quaffable. Recommended..."
"D-Great flavour melding with that wonderful sour bite. I have noticed lately that I have become almost as big a fan of ""sours"" as I have always been with hops. I guess it is all about the extreme flavours. Red Poppy certainly lives up to the extreme flavour moniker. Nicely done, but who would expect anything less from Tomme? He has set the bar very high for himself....but he seems to keep clearing it over and over again!"
"Pours a murky redish orange with tons of sediment. offwhite head, some lacing. Nose- really barnyard funky, fresh cherries. Taste- bitter cherries, moderate tartness but not overwhelming. Not too sweet or too sour. Some wood in the finish. Exceptional drinkability."
"This is a really great Oud Bruin. I have only had one better and that was Aardmonnik but I will never get to try that one again haha. This one was just a really enjoyable beer."
"D - a very special treat."
"Port Brewing Red Poppy Ale is the second best Flanders oud bruin that I've ever had the pleasure to consume. Compared to the perfect symphony that is Liefmans Goudenband, it's slightly (very slightly) out of tune. It's still a tremendous effort from one of America's best breweries. Thanks to tayner for the bottle."
"Light bronze in color with a full, silky head of foam. Nose is nearly perfect, with hints of sour cherries, Pinot Noir, oak & funk. Flavor is outstanding, perfectly balanced and complex. Hints of lightly toasted oak, vanilla, sour cherries and Pinot Noir. Really stunningly good."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a smooth effervescence of tight bubbly carbonation as it flows down. It's quite refreshing with a nice interplay between the sweet and sour. A bottle of this to myself is truly a treat and I only wish I had more. A tasty treat of a beer from Lost Abbey."
"Taste: Sour Cherries, Lemon, Oak, Leather, Very Dry and Tart there is a bit of Fruity sweetness in there too. Medium Carbonation and Body. Very Refreshing."
"d: Huge thanks to barleywinebrewer for the chance to try this rarity. These are well worth seeking out. I look forward to trying more of this style."
"This ale paired nicely with some spicy, cheesy pan fried potatoes that my girlfriend made."
"Pours a cloudy chunky orange/red, kind of like grapefruit juice, thick white head, some solid lace spots, settles to a nice layer and thick ring. Smell is sour and tart, very acidic, cherries, bread, lots of fruit, quite intense, oak, nice. Taste is similar, very oaky, some caramel, vanilla, cherries, tart fruit, acidic, lemons, vanilla, acidic fruit in the finish, very nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and easy to drink. Fantastic sour beer, no rough edges, very nice. Thanks Scott!"
"drinkability is great. great depth to the funk and sourness. nice malt profile hiding in behind. balanced and highly enjoyable."
"D - Overall, this is a great beer that I could see drinking with some cheese and crackers as an apetif. It is a really easy drinking beer and one that just calls you back. It has such a unique flavor that I want a chance to experience more and more of it. Each sip is different and I can't wait to open up that other bottle I received from my trade. Wished I lived somewhere close that kept this stocked as I would easily drink this a lot more esp in situations where I have champagne but the celebration does not necessarily call for champagne."
"Drinkability- This is a really great beer that I wish I could drink anytime I'm in the mood for the style. It's ridiculously drinkable and freakishly tasty. I'm not sure how this stands up to some other Lost Abbey brews but if they've done any style as tasty as they've made this one, I'll be really pleasantly surprised. Big thanks to Tim for the opportunity!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary sweet, candy on the front of the tongue with vinegar acidic notes in the middle, and a semi-dry finish."
"Dark burnished orange amber with a nice small head of off-white foam that lasts for a short while lending some decent Belgian lace and nice leggings. Aromas of sour cherries with nice light biscuity bread, brett funk, and more. The aroma is also very wild with a great funky barnyard notes that are well integrated with the bready yeast and lend a definitive edge to this one. This is certainly easier drinking and more well integrated and balanced than beers such as the duchess and her brothers. Taste is sour cherry, funk, hay, and barnyard with a nice small biscuity malt presence and no real hops to speak of. Mouthfeel is sharp and acidic up front but super smooth and well done as well. Drinkability is like liquid crack for a red sour such as this. This stuff is pretty fucking fantastic. One of the best lost abbey beers that I have said and that is saying a whole hell of a lot!"
"T&M - pretty outstanding, I've had quit a few wild ales from Jolly Pumpkin Brewery. This beer is not as sour as those beers, but I think that compared to 90% of those beers this one is easier to drink. Tastes of sour cherries, very smooth on the mouth. Could sip it all night or slug it down in one gulp, Delicious!!"
"D: Definitely a very refreshing beer. At first I thought it wasn't so easily drinkable due to the tartness but as it warms and the more complex flavors come through the tartness becomes less and less noticable. Great beer overall and defintitely something worth trying. My first L.A. beer and defintely a good impression is made."
"While the oak is never overwhelming here, it does seem to get in the way of the funky-fermentation notes and the base, beer-ingredient driven flavors & complexities; I think about a quarter of the oak character would be perfect for this beer, keeping it nice and subtle and in more of a supporting role. The buttery oak notes really seem to dominate the aroma of this brew after a bit, though I wouldn't say that it get over-whelming, it just does overwhelm all the other aromatic components. Not bad, even quite good, but the dominant oak keeps it from being incredible for me, though I must admit that I love seeing all this flavor packed into a beer of only 5%abv."
"Awesome beer overall. I wish I had several more bottles to enjoy, but alas, this is a rare one. The funkiness is not as in your face as many lambics and gueuzes, but there is a lot of complexity. Well worth seeking a bottle out if you can."
"D: I'd like one more glass. I'm not feeling it at all. I wish I'd shared the bottle with only one other person! It's a small bottle for the price."
"Beautiful bottle, definitely really classy. I love the image of the poppy on black with the heavy glass, and I love the name. I guess Poppies will always be associated with Flanders after the ""Flanders Field"" association. Pours a murky reddish/orange brown with a slight head, but what head there is surprisingly sticks around as a swirl of light foam for a very long time. Smells quite acetic, with some red fruit, a bit of leather, and a touch of funk right at the end. Taste is marvelous, and quite complex. Starts sour with a bit of spiciness and more red fruit and plum. It becomes more minerally, funkier, and woodier. The finish is both spicy and funky with flavors of aged, runny cheese. The fruity sourness persists throughout. Delicious and very balanced. The oak contributes some funkiness, and some light tannins, but there is no flavor of new oak or vanilla. The mouthfeel is pure and acetic, but benefits from the light tannins lending some structure. A complex beer, as complex as much stronger beers. Tremendously drinkable and ebjoyable."
"Pours a fogged brown with basically no creme head. Nose is very antiseptic and funky and exactly what I would expect. Really, I could not expect more for the fragrance aspect. Flavor is definitely interesting. Total funky coming on the flavor. Again, this just seems like exactly what you would expect for the style. However. The fruit aspect of it is very shallow. I kind of would have liked to have just a touch more. Regardless, we are still bringing the funk here. Feel has a good liquid and carbonation to it. This is very easy to drink for a sour beer. Perhaps I am more used to it with my vastly experienced palate. Either way, this is an exemplary version of the style. Definitely worth seeking out."
"M/D: For what it is, a sour ale, it was very easy to drink. There was enough carbonation that it didnt seem syurp-y and the cherries did not taste at all medicinal like some cherry beers are. This is the first sour beer that i can say has not been a drain pour for me, so i am rating it as such with high marks. I have a couple more bottles, and i am not sure how fast they will fly out of the cellar, but someday i am sure i will get brave again :)"
"Drinkability: A very well executed sour ale, and what a top-notch, classy bottle."
"*Taster's Note: Special thanks to beerhandy for sharing this bottle."
"Drinkability/Notes: Another great beer from Lost Abbey. Lots going on here with tart, sour cherries, an underlying fruity sweetness and brett funkiness all aged in oak barrels. Extremely refreshing as its light, crisp and dry with a modest 5% abv. I could drink these all night and not get bored or sick of it. Highly drinkable. Absolutely seek this beer out. Highly recommended."
"D- It's good but wouldn't say it's one of my favorites from them. Is great for the style though."
"D- Keep bringing them on. This is a great beer and it is only 5.5% alcohol so you can drink this all night. If you can find that much of it!"
"Lost Abbey brews yet another fantastic beer, pretty sure this replaced Le Woody or is essentially the same beer, wish I had more of this stuff, probably will not change much with any age without brettanomyces, hopefully they brew more of this next year, best Flanders I have had, nice looking bottle with the new labels, worth all the hype, definitely would drink again and highly recommended to everybody"
"Had last night during Valentine's dinner with the wife. Poured from the bottle into an oversized wine glass. It pours a deep ruby red, with a thin white head that didn't last long. The smell is of citrus tartness, yeasty funk, and spicy malt. The taste is pretty tart up front, with the funky yeast flavor and malt sweetness coming through toward the end. The beer had a certain spice to it that was nice. Overall a little to tart to drink too much of, and it is a little more refined (i.e. less funky) then some similar beers I have had of the style, still a fantastic beer."
"Ok, I think you get the gist. More breweries should make this style of beer!"
"Overall - The 08 and 09 batches are outstanding. A Flemish style sour without all the acetic acid, and a great balance between oak and fruit. Later batches are solid but not as exceptional."
"Overall this one literally floored me. I have loved everything that has come out of Lost Abbey, and not being biased, but seriously, who else is this consistent with quality, I mean it seems everything new they put out is better then the one before that, its almost unheard of. This was just tremendous. A light fruity sour ale that had me literally giddy with excitement. This was something not only I would gladly have again, but that I would be actively searching for more of. One of the best I have ever had."
"Pours a murky autumn brown color with a half finger head that quickly dies down to a paper thin layer of bubbles which remains throughout. Swirling the glass yields a small amount of lacing, but nothing more. Smell is tart cherries, sour apples, and slight oak notes. Some floral aromas as well. I'm not too familiar with flowers, but there is a bit of a rose scent to it. Pretty funky in the nose through and through, but not overpowering by any means. Sour fruit tartness up front of cherries, grapes, and apple with a leather like flavor as well. The fruit on the tongue isn't nearly as strong as I had expected. An interesting malt character finds its way in the mouth as well. Aftertaste is a tangy wood flavor. This one really has a wonderful feel to it. Fluffy and smooth from start to finish with a perfect carbonation. Leaves the mouth dry and begging for more. The combination of the amazing mouthfeel and low abv makes this pretty easy drinking. What a truly unique beer."
"D- If you enjoy this style, or sour in general this is a great brew. 1 bottle is definetly enough for me. I think this would pair excellent with food."
"Very good brew, and I'm very glad I got to try it, but not my favorite offering from The Lost Abbey. I got my four bottles, and have already traded one away to a nearby BA. I'll likely enjoy my bottles sooner rather than later given that Tomme says there was no brett added to the bottles, so I'm not sure that this will change much in the bottle."
"Sampled in a small tulip at the release on 1-19. Tons of sediment in my glass compared with little to no sediment in the glasses around me. I though about sending it back, but decided to let it warm up and settle for 20 minutes while I waited in line. After about 2 minutes I started sipping it because i just couldn't wait. First aroma is that of overripe cherries with some brettamyces in the background. Mouthfeel was tart and slightly puckering aftertaste. Hint of green apples and caramel malt in the finish. I am new to this style but I loved the balanced effervescense which made it quite drinkable. Not as sour of a finish as its cantillon counterparts."
"I was also unprepared for the taste - light but very tangy. I didn't really like it at the time. It finishes fairly dry, and it took me awhile to grow into the tartness. I was also slightly off-put by the presence of the cork floating into my mouth. I'm going to hold on to one or two of these bottles and see how they are in a year, maybe the next time Red Poppy rolls out."
"Had a taster at the release in a small port wine glass. It was suppose to be on tap but for some reason this one was from a bottle. Poured a cloudy reddish brown with white head nice lacing.( the guy next to me had a clear reddish brown, guessing I got a sample from towards the bottom of the bottle) Nose is sour cherry with Lost Abbey funk and hint of malt and oak. Taste is smooth in fact very smooth for a sour. Nice balance with cherries that are both sour and tart, malt sweetness, and mild dry oak finish. Mouthfeel is medium body with a good carbonation level and dryness. This is a great drinking Oud Bruin very easy to drink for the style and very balanced and layered. Bravo"
"Wow, this one started to go downhill fast. I did hear from Tomme that this one should not be aged and I agree."
"On tap and poured into a small flute glass at The Lost Abbey. Pours a pretty clear but noticeably unfiltered light brown. The smell is tart, the cherries are apparent but definitely not as strong as when we sampled at the barrel tasting in August '07. The taste is tart, slightly acidic, the cherries come in mostly at the beginning of the sip, and it finishes with a medium dryness. It's definitely not as sweet I will have to re-update this review when I try a bottle."
"There's some malt sweetness in here, and maybe a hint of lighter fruits ... maybe some plums or figs. The overriding flavor, though is a semi-acidic soury base over oak. Delicious, very drinkable. The mouthfeel is a fascinating dry, champagne-esque finish that really makes the flavors in this pop. Perfect carbonation. One of the most enjoyable ""mouthfeelable"" beers I can recall. I love the dryness."
"Dark reddish brown color, a hint of funky sourness in the nose, very mellow cherry sweetness and sour flavor. This one just gets better and better the more you have it in the same day. Truly amazing. I had this one with Tomme and Vince at Port Brewing after getting out of work at Stone Brewing. They told me that this is essentially Le Woody Brune with a new name. Can't wait until it is released!"
