review_text
"Well this is officially the worst Flanders Red that I have ever sampled.  Not malty like a Flanders Red should be. Not sour... heck, not even much of a light tartness. Tasting alot of oak barrel.  Mouthfeel is watery and overall impression is bland and unwhelming.  Sad that this beer is a tribute to such an awesome historical beer figure as Michael Jackson.  Were you trying to insult the poor guy by brewing this beer? It was not much of a tribute. That is for sure."

"The flavor has dried fruit and mild cherry-like tanginess with slight burnt pie-crust flavor from the malt-vienna if I had to guess with slight nutty accent and mild medicinal element from the yeast with tangy flavors but not exactly extremely sour, mildly herbal and pithy type bitter flavor comes through in the dry finish. Overall I was glad I got to try this -a pretty decent flanders red with nice wild yeast character and dry quality with come complexity and mild alcohol presence with a gentle wood tannin in taste -recommended."

"O/D - A confusing take on the Flemmish Red style. Quite tasty and complex with some odd notes, but overall a pretty tasty one. I think this was about $30 so I'm a bit confused on the hype/rarity, but I'm trying to enjoy it for what it is. What it is, is good."
""
""
""
""
"O- I had no idea how this was going to be going into it but I was actually fairly impressed. By no means did it blow me away or would I say it was my favorite Flanders but it was definitely a quality beer worth trying."
""
""
""
"I'll reiterate that this beer is horribly overpriced, though I was kind of forced into purchasing it via the anniversary pack. It's not particularly offensive, but its very weak for a flanders red. My bottle was actually nicely carbonated and had a lovely garnet body. Woody, muted tart cherry, vanilla, oak. Not something I would pony up for in the future."

"Low D-"
"Above average. Good to try."
"Shared a bottle with my wife, the beer is red but very cloudy. The nose is Brett funk seems somewhat unrefined. The beers tastes is unrefined, sweet malt with Brett funk, a very odd finish almost alcohol with a strange bitterness. This tastes like the first time I used Brett in a homebrew, a complete mess. Very unimpressed."

"Overall. Never again, HOTD. I think I have one or two more of your beers in the cellar, but after that I'm done. Between this and the recent batch of flat Doggie Claws, I feel completely ripped off paying such stupid amounts of money for flat (or virtually flat) beer. Too bad since Matt was one of the better beers I've had. Oh well, there are plenty of consistent great beers out there to spend my hard earned cash on."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a subpar beer from HOTD. With their quality issues, who knows if this beer was actually supposed to taste like this. Not something I would have an interest in trying again."
""
"The beer pours a rusty brown color with a very loose off-white head that fades without lacing. The nose is pit fruity, floral, slightly vinous, with very little alcohol.4 The taste is definitely fruity and sweet upfront, consistent with the nose, followed by a faintly woody finish. There is not nearly enough oak or dryness. I'm assuming it would probably dry out/become more complex with a bit of age, which would make the mouthfeel quite supreme. This is a delicious Flanders, a bit too sweet, but with lots if subtle fruit flavor and great potential."
""
"Hair of the Doggie has been hit or miss for me, & this is a whiff. Flat, not very flavorful, & expensive. 0-3. Doesn't even touch mediocre, not a good beer."
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. So smooth and easy drinking. I felt it is missing some vinegar and more sour cherry notes indicative of the style but collectively its pretty nice. Maybe just a bit too much focus on barrel character but this was a nice brew that I wouldnt mind having more of."
""
""
""
""
""
"A big take on a Flanders Red. I was a little suspect of how this would work, but I am happily surprised. Another delicious beer from Hair of the Dog. Big fruit and a little funkiness and souring. Also can taste the alcohol, but not overwhelming for a beer of its strength. Goes very nicely with a cheese plate or even a good stew. Warming, comforting and at the same time very fresh tasting."
""
""
""
"It would've been a little better had it been slightly more tart, but it was still pretty damn good. Easily drinkable and refreshing, I'm not sure how old this one was, but I think it had some age on it. Nice wine-like characteristics and a big contribution from the oak barrel."
""
"D - A bit more oak and acetic than I like more Flanders beers, but miles better than it was on release. Alan's beers are built to age and this was no exception. Enjoyable at this stage, but still only a good take on the style. I'd drink it again"
""
""
""
"Poured a burnt brownish orange with reddish highlights and a thin bubbly head that barely left any lacing sticking to the glass. Plenty of sweet fruity aromas upfront on the nose consisting of cherries, dark fruit with a little vinous character, subtle vinegar, good acidicy and nice oaky wood presence. The dark fruit were more apparent on the palate with great cherry fruit accents, vinous barrel character, oaky wood notes with plenty of acidicy, lingering vanilla and a touch of brown sugar. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a fruity, acidic, semi sweet, oaky, mild vinegary and tart finish. Good lookin out beezler on this bottle, drank good and was solid all around."
"Overall a good beer but not amazing compared to other beers in the style. 4"
""
""
""
"The lack of carbonation hurts overall enjoyment and drinkability. I know this may have improved if I had aged it, but I am getting weary of breweries releasing beers that are not ready to drink straightaway. If it's not ready, don't sell it, guys."
"O-It was a good beer, but the lack of carbonation really hurt how good this beer could have been."
""
""
""
"O: A bit of a letdown. Flavor was ok, not as assertive or tart as I was hoping. The lack of carbonation was what really killed it for me though."
""
"O: Over oaked. A little restraint with the barrel and more carbonation would improve this substantially."
""
""
""
"O: The balance is key here - I cannot stand when this style is overly acetic or overly sweet. Rarely do I find one this well balanced. I'm very impressed - this is much better than past vintages I've had."
"Big thanks to Aaron for this one. Served in a Hair of the Dog tulip. Nose is pretty nice with a good level of acidity plus some baking oak and a fruit component. There’s some cherry along with mild dark fruits. Flavor ha the acidity and fruit down, but there’s way too much barrel character, as the tannins are nearly overpowering. Light-medium body."
""
""
""
""
"O - Oaky and dark fruit. Light body and cherry-citrus."
""
""
"O: This spent awhile in the barrels and it shows. Nose and taste are very different, but harmonious."
""
""
""
"o - overall interesting. glad to taste it but won't be seeking it out. the oak dominates bringing a big vanilla on the flanders. might be a better beer if not put in the barrel."
""
"O - A nice representation of the style. The fruit shows well with some decent tartness. The vinegar in the bottle I had wasn't dominating. It seems there is some bottle variation with this beer and I couldn't be happier to get a great one! Great US representation."
""
"The ’09 batch was a little muddled, but this one is both heavier on the funk and sour with brighter more intense cherry and vinegar to boot. A candidate for most improved beer of the year. I'll be buying a full allotment for sure."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being high. Overall it was a pretty solid sour beer. I really liked the funky, musty flavors in the aroma. The taste showed a little too much sweetness up front that seemed to overshadow some of the funky character. Very good overall though, I wish I didn't lose half of it upon opening."
""
""
"O - Nice to be able to try, but the people have spoken on this one. Even Michael (God rest his soul) would have thought this was average."
""
"Beer pours a hazy reddish brown with a nice white head. Smell is nice, mix of vinegar, sour and acidic. Taste comes up way short, however. The flavor has an interesting flanders red type taste up front, but it finishes very bland. It is not very sour at all, has a little vinegar up front, but nothing to follow it up. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer, but falls short of expectations."

"This was definitely an experience. Not what I expected at all from a Flanders Red style beer but Hair of the Dog really doesn't make anything ""normal"" per-say do they. A little too boozy for such a light ABV beer but still pretty good regardless. Don't break you back to find this as it was fairly unremarkable overall."
"Overall a very solid beer"
"Clear copper/orange pour, bottle was a gusher. Nose is bright, lactic acid, salt, red berries, metallic. Decent amount of sugars. Flavor is metallic and lightly sour, light red fruits. Light and bright compared to many beers of this style, but too many off flavors to really enjoy. This is typically not a style American brewers do well, possibly overall one of the least enjoyable styles out there because there are so many huge misses. This wasn't a huge miss, just mediocre."
"A complex ale. It’s not the greatest Flanders ever, but it is interesting."
"Updated as I just re had this beer and its getting better and better."
"It has a nice complexity of flavors. The age has definitely helped it out. I wish I had more of this to see how it continues to progress."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, and pretty nice carbonation that isn't over abundant despite the fact that it was a gusher. Still this is an interesting, unique beer that I am happy to have tried. Overall pretty good, as is expected from HotD."
"A tribute to the beer hunter. Heard this one was a gusher, and they were right. I'm usually pretty good at not missing my glass, but not so moose face. Pours a hazy reddish color with a thin beige head. Nice barrel presence. Not much in the nose or flavor. Good example of the style, but no defining qualities. Thin finish, lacks complexity."
"Bottle. 2009 vintage. Bottle opens with a pretty loud ""pop"" and pretty much started gushing right away. Poured into a NB tulip glass a murky brown red color with a big fluffy tan head that slowly recedes, leaving some lace. The oak is pretty evident in the nose right away along with a cider apple/fruit type note. Light mouthfeel with less carbonation than I thought given the gushing of the bottle. Slightly sweet and sour flavor gives way to a bitter oaky flavor that lingers on a bit. In all honesty, I'm not totally in love with this beer and expected more."
"Reviewed on 3/13/2010. Bottle thanks to scrizzz. Pours a semi-hazy dirty brown with basically no head just bubbles. Aroma of lots of oak, brett/acidic notes, light sweet malts. The aroma reminds me a lot of Fred from the Wood. Flavor is more sweet, just a touch acidic with light sour notes. This isn't like other Flanders red ales that I've had -- more like an oaky, bretty, sherry-ish beer. Anyway, it was pretty tasty, well done!"
"About two seconds after popping the cap a slow gush falls out of the bottle into a waiting glass. Obviously plenty of carbonation as a bubbly, dense egg-white head forms and has long lasting retention and thick, foamy clumps of lacing. Color is a murky, muddy rose amber. A small layer of sediment settles at the bottom of the glass. Aroma is strong blend of fruit, oak and vinegar. Alternatingly sour and tart with cherry, cranberry, sherry, and vanilla. Taste is at first abrupt and sharp, with the acidity of the vinegar notes taken the forefront. As the beer warms, the front of the palate starts with oak and vanilla spirit sweetness. Subtly the flavors shift to tart fruit and acidic vinegar. Finish is dry, acidic, mildly metallic and extremely long lasting. Smooth body with light carbonation this overall has a very sharp, strong and potentially off putting combination of flavors, but all things considered is very balanced. Very interesting and aging nicely I assume, I look forward to having this again."
"Sourness is in check with wood and funk aromas and fruit hints both on palate and on the nose. Some amount of balancing sweetness, but certainly not sweet. Goes down way too easy for $12 a 12ouncer. Could drink this happily all night, many nights."
"D: Very easy to drink, a real pleasure after being a little immature last fall (if I recall correctly, and if I'm reading early reviews accurately). I only got to try this as a quick sip or two at the Dock Sale, but never ventured to try one of my cellared bottles before today. Glad I waited - a tasty Flanders Red now and one that might develop even further (toward deliciousness) over time. Well played, Mr. Sprints, well played...a fitting tribute to The Beer Hunter."
"A good first attempt at the style. I heard this was flat and suffered from poor mouthfeel when this first came out, but that wasn't the case with this bottle."
"(D)- Wow, this one surprised me. A great example of the style in my opinion. Tastes great and has all that funk/sourness I am beginning to enjoy/crave. I would love to snag a few more of these to see how it evolves age-wise."
"Drinkability- Wonderful on a hot day. This is what my husband and I would fondly call a porch-sipping beer."
"- Overall a very nice sour, and I couldn't expect more from such a fine brewer."
"What an absolute mess."
"J"
"D - An excellent beer that I'm glad to be able to try. One of the more noticeable oaky wood flavors I've gotten out of any beer. Works in this one, although some might find it a bit heavy handed. This is a style that I really enjoy and this is a fine example...perhaps a bit on the fringes of the style, but well worth seeking out."
"HV"
"The after taste is kind of odd and earthy with the berries sticking around a bit. This is quite drinkable, but not my favorite flanders. I drank this kinda quick, so it goes down easy if ya like the sour, for some reason i did not want this to get to warm. An interesting interpretation of the style, this should do something in a year or two in a bottle, Cheers to Allen for tackeling another style."
"Overall, not the most traditional take on a Flanders red but very well done. Closest I could come to approximating it would probably be to compare it to Reinart Wild Ale, but I much preferred this. Unfortunate that it was a gusher, and I hope to try more of this in the future."
"D- this is a serious brew and the flavor and bugs will take its toll on you. My mind and palate are blown."
"D- I really enjoyed this beer. I could drink quite a few of these without hesitation. Get it if u can, but be careful when opening this thing cuz u could lose an eye."
"D: A pretty easy drinking beer, and I was interested to pick out the nuances of the beer. I wonder how this will get with age."
"Overall an excellent Flemish red ale. About on par with The Bruery's Oude Tart."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is on the lower side, as are most sours for me, due to the high tartness. Overall, I liked this brew, but the extreme overcarbonation and the weird twang at the back of the throat are this brew's downfall. Good, not great. Skal."
"D - Not very much like any Flanders Red I've had, but very good nonetheless. I feel like this was more akin to a Belgian Strong Pale in flavor, but that is a trivial thing."
"D: It's a good Flanders Red, but after thinking about it, I prefer Oude Tart quite a bit more. I enjoyed drinking it, but it's nothing to write home about."
"The beer is light bodied and well carbonated but it's almost too thin. There is a nice dry finish and the alcohol is well hidden. I was a little disappointed by this beer, normally everything from HOTD I have is top notch. Maybe some more time in the bottle would benefit this one."
"The flavor has a slightly funky tartness in the beginning that fades to a semi-oxidized finish of wet paper and mineral water. A pleasant cherry-like fruitiness hits in the middle, but the finish is just odd...borders on sweaty gym socks, but doesn't quite offend the palate to that extent. Mouthfeel is thin and juicy with a metallic-medicinal twang and low carbonation level. All in all, an interesting beer that I'm glad I got to try (thanks again Josh!), but not something I would seek out."
"Overall, I admire the work that went into making this beer, but it's a shame this was made in honor of Michael Jackson, as it this was a big let down. Maybe next time..."
"D- The under-carbonation gives this offering a flat, watery flavor that strangely adds to the drinkability, although probably not past a glass or two. However, somewhat confusing flavors make this not desirable past much more than one. Based on the brewery alone I would give it another shot with age (even though this already has three years from brew date). Great brewery from which I will seek all beer; you can't win them all."
"D: I liked it, I think it's a solid effort, maybe a little too much hops in a Flanders Red, but hey, I love this style, and I like that a Western US brewer is making it."
"I find this to be very drinkable and quite enjoyable. I also think that it will benefit from some more cellar time, perhaps another 3-5 years. I wish I had more of it to test that theory with. Sadly, this is my only bottle."
"D: Very. nicely crafted sour. Not for the extreme sour freaks, but for those who like an approachable sour it is a winner."
"Not surprisingly this beer was a real gusher. It is cloudy red in color and smells not only sour but woody, tart, and a little plastic. The taste is odd, sour fruit but not really reminiscent of a flanders red. This almost reminds me of sui generis from Avery. Its kind of thin and the barrel seems to dominate the flavor but its still not a bad beer. It just doesn't seem to fit they flanders red style very well."
"Smell is tart and a bit floral. There's more of the tart character in the flavor. This is very smooth in regards to mouthfeel. There's a strong oak flavor in the finish of the beer. It's a decent beer, but I honestly had higher expectations for this beer."
"Michael is texturally disappointing, but I like the originality and exotica elsewhere. HOTD have set the bar so high, not everything they do will be a mindblower. But I liked this just fine and was really, really thankful for the chance to try it. Thanks again, Brian."
"D: There's definitely a weird taste to this one which I'm not sure I like. Perhaps it needed a couple more years? However, the bitterness is noticeable upfront and doesn't really dissipate. Rather, it becomes more dominant at the finish. A bit dissapointing but I'd definitely like to try it again in a year or two."
"D: Overall it was a really nice flanders and enjoyed this 10 times more than I did the first time. I'm pleased with the progress this beer has made since November. Should only improve with more time!"
"This probably isn't the best Flanders Red I've had, but I really liked this one, even in it's present state. I think with some age this one will be even better as the brett starts to work it's magic."
"Drinkability- This beer just isn't quite there yet. It needs some time to let everything sort of mellow and let the yeast/bacteria do its thing. It needs some of the sour and maybe once that happens this thing will perk up a bit. Not bad by any means, just needs time to tighten up a bit. Thanks much Jason!"
"D: Pretty damn drinkable"
"Soft carbonation up front with an oily, vinegary body which is surprisingly malty. Very sweet and vinous with some tart vinegary sweet, dry bretty funk and a lot of dark fruit character. Lots of tart dark cherry, plum, raisin, grape and fig smoothed out by some vanilla oaky tannis. Sweet alcohol flavor but no heat/warmth to speak of. A bit too sweet and not as tart/puckering as I would like but still very flavorful and quaffable."
"Bottle in a trade at Ratebeer. Pours a nice dark red... almost brown, with a small beige head. Aroma is fruity and tart with barrel, vinegar and spice. Flavor was a little off - Fruity and slightly sour, but had a buttery quality that reminded me of Gargamel. This one might need to sit awhile. Palate was ok, but a little thin. Not a bad beer and I might give it another go soon."
"The beer pours a reddish, amber brown color with OK head retention and lacing. The nose is pretty interesiting, with considerable sour cherry and funk. It's not over done, and there's a hint of sweetness to keep the sour funk in check, but this beer is definitely on the sour side. Flavors replicate the nose pretty closely, though there's a bit more of a vinegar sour component then I was expecting from the nose. There's also a hint of bitterness and fruit skin in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the finish is fairly long. Drinkability is pretty good, though the amount of sour wears me out just a bit. Alcohol is well disguised, but the sour and funk would always keep me from drinking more then just a little bit."
"slight sour nose with a little sherry and oak, pours ruby in color with minimal head, slightly carbonated. Slight sour in initial taste with big oak flavors. There is a slight sherry flavor to the beer but it is abrasive to the palate. Very light and watered down. Any good flavors fade out quick and leave a tea-like taste in your mouth which equals a bad aftertaste. Hopefully some time in the bottle will improve this beer but unfortunately it doesn't seem like there is much room for improvement. If this beer was sour all the way through I would like it a lot better."
"Michael Jackson is such a man to be honored but sadly this beer does not even come close to doing it. It should be avoided if you are a flanders fan and others should be sought out."
"A swing and a pop fly caught in deep right center. I hope Michael Jackson isn't rolling around in his grave :p"
"Drinkability? This drinks much stronger than I thought would be the case for a 6.2%abv brew and darn it, the flavours just don't work for me. This isn't a brew that I'd seek out again but it is worth a go if you have the chance."
"Like too many HOTD beers, this one is basically flat and could benefit from some carbonation. I will be interested in seeing how some time in the bottle changes this one. At first I thought about rating this lower, but I enjoyed the last 1/3 of the bottle so much that I had to bump it up."
"i'd give it an A- and if carbonation and funk increases in the future an A."
"The beer is medium bodied with an all too low level of carbonation for the style I hope this beer shows more carbonation in the future. Overall, an enjoyable beer that I hope to see improve with age. I think an increase in carbonation and acetic character will do this beer well. At this point, 12oz is more than enough."
"Copper reddish body ( a bit of chill haze to start) semi-opaque (yeasty) body, and as with all HOTD beers except Blue Dot, minimally carbonated. However, there was a significant amount of carbonation clinging to sides of glass. Tart funky nose representative of the best of the style, cherries (Rainier, Lapin?) in the nose, medium bodied, not much hops to speak about. Tart lip-smacking finish. Though it will certainly benefit from a bit of aging, it taste pretty damn good right now.Not willing to push the envelope on drinkability right now, but this beer taste damn good, very tasty Given the fact it was just bottled about a month ago, I suspect the carbonation and funky edge will pick up a bit over time. Glad I have a slew of this stashed for my BA brothers smart enough to recognize that Alan Sprints (and his SoCal soul brother, Patirck Rue- now that's a collaboration I'd like to see!!) are on the cutting edge of West Coast Brewing. Very good now, and I suspect with a bit of patience, something to pull out and share with very very special friends. No doubt, The Beer Hunter is very pleased."
"4/4/3.5"
"Drinkability- A complex, slow sipper that would go great with the right meal and is very good on it's own like I'm enjoying it now. Again, I think more time giving the beer more carbonation would bump up this score. The rest of mine will be sitting in the cellar for awhile."
"Overall the oak, wine, apple and sour mingle together very well. As the glass empties, this is quickly becoming a Hotd brew I will not soon forget."
"On a closing thought I would like mention that this has been a side-by-side comparison with Brouwerij Verhaeghe's Duchesse De Bourgogne. I must concede that the Duchesse won me over this round."
