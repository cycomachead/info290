"Drinkability – The taste fell a little short on this.  It’s good, but not one of the top flanders reds in my opinion."

"I feel like lost in this beer somewhere is a really interesting character that would have added so many dimensions to this flat, flavourless affair. But there's just nothing here, at least any more."
""
""
"O: Delicious nose but I thought the taste fell short. Not bad overall, but definitely underwhelming."
""
"Overall: Logsdon should have a far better Flemish Red than this one. This is thin, weak and lacking complexity and verve. It has some of the basic characters, but just fumbles with them until it produces something really quite pedestrian. C'mon guys, you can do way better, surely."
"Overall, an alright beer, but there are at least half a dozen in the style that I'd sooner reach for. I like Logsdon overall, but this one just isn't quite doing it for me. That said, this might be a nice entry-style beer for those who are looking to get into beers in the sour end of the taste spectrum, but would like to take it on gradually."

"Overall: a tasty and quite quaffable Flanders red. Sour, but not too sour, with an interesting complexity that, while not mind-blowing, can keep my interest through the bottle. Good stuff!"

"Another nice beer from Logsdon's... surprise! As far as the style goes, this is not particularly tart or funky. It's good, but I think it could be more magical, given the yeast wizardry that this brewery usually demonstrates."
"Nice. Not the most complex take on the style but it's a good beer. Balance of tart and sweet."
""
""
""

"M: Medium bodied. Good carbonation (for sure)."
""
""
"Overall: An interesting take on the style. I enjoyed this, but considering the brewery (which I'm a big fan of), it's a slight disappointment. I'd recommend trying it if you can, but no need to go to great lengths to seek it out."
"O - It's a good beer, but for the price I was expecting a lot more out of it."

"dark reddish pour with thin off white head, aroma brought notes of cherry, slight oak, lemon notes, hints of nice red fruits, touch of earthy and lots of spicy notes come through. Taste is a mix of oak, earth, lemon, slight red fruits, touch of vinegar, lots of spice in there, finishing fairly oaky, slightly tart. Decent."
"O: An excellently crafted beer. The sourness is more soft than its inspiration Flemish Red from, say, Rodenbach. No flavor was overwhelming. The sour character and the malt bill balanced each other almost perfectly. This beer is crafted and bottled in a very traditional way, and it is evident in the product. I also appreciate the American farmhouse ruggedness it has, over the more Belgian sophistication of a traditional, top-notch Flemish red from Europe. I'd say it's the best American attempt at a Flemish red I've ever had."

"I'd drink this again if I could get it but it could be a tough sell with cheap bottles of Rodenbach on the same shelf"
"Not what I was expecting, but a great beer. Would be curious to try this with age on it - maybe it will seem much more like a Flanders Red as it picks up oxidized and vinegary notes with age - but I'm loving it fresh."

"T: Not as good as the nose, but still a pretty decent beer. A light cranberry tartness opens things up with some light red cherry, underripe red apple and a touch of vinegar. Some good sourness kicks in near the finish with a touch of cherry skin tannins coming in. Some soft bready malt, caramel and vanilla lurk way in the background. Carbonation is a touch high and the beer is a bit watery, but it's a really pleasant and refreshing tart beer."
"D - Fun to try but not one of my favorites."

"O: A pretty good example of the style and enjoyed."
""
"Mehhh.... not a bad beer, but nothing to get all that excited about either."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a solid Flanders style red. Much better than Cerasus. Not the most complex, in the subtle style to which Logsdon leans, but satisfying."

"3.9/10"

"O: A solid beer and worth trying. Needs additional complexity to shine, but I will say it was better than its older brother Cerasus which actually has the cherries in it."
""
"O: Extremely drinkable. I'd gladly drink it again. Great beer, I really enjoyed it but it's kinda lackluster when placed next to Seizoen Bretta and Peches (both of which are fantastic)."
"Overall - Surprisingly good. I haven't been impressed by Logsdon's ""sour"" offerings, but this doesn't try to do too much."
""
"O: It was decent, but having seen the price for this one in bottle, I would pass."
""
"Overall a really enjoyable sour beer from a great little brewery."
""
""
"O: definitely have been digging these logsdon beers, have to seek out more of their offerings especially for them being organic in all."
""

"overall: meh. wish I hadn't shelled out the cash for two of these"

"Pours a murky, reddish brown color. Gets more and more murky with each pour from the bottle. Lots of bottle conditioning going on here. Large, off-white head. Scent is not too inviting. Although this one is supposed to be the most sour from the bunch, it is not the most funky, nor does it hold the most tart aroma from the Logsdon beers. Scent is more spicy, and slightly tart. Unfortunately the aroma reminds me of not-so-great breweries that make an attempt at wild ales. The taste is a step up though. The flavor is much more complex and overall better than the nose. Taste starts off immediately tart with cherries and a great amount of oak. Cherry flavors are more sweet than tart. Still tart, but not sour. Wish this beer was more sour. Drinks a little boozy as well for a 6.5% beer. I've had Cascade, Bruery, and RR sours that have higher ABV that have less booziness. Same goes for any saison I've had from Fantome. Finish is very saison-like, and probably the best part of this beer. Drinkability is okay. Mouthfeel is slightly acidic...but hardly. Very carbonated with a light body. Overall, I was hoping for something better. When I read the label and heard about the bugs being used with the cherries...I had high hopes. This beer is a solid beer...just not worth the price tag. I would much rather spend $20 on a wild ale from Cascade or Bruery."

"Pours a brownish red. Very cloudy. Sort of a muddy look. Small off-white head that dissipates quickly. Not a very thick layer of foam to start, anyway. Lots of funky cherries in the aroma. Tends more toward fruit sweetness than Cerasus. The funk is a bit odd, sort of cheesy. Mild medicinal note. Some tannic woodiness. The taste is a nice tart cherry flavor, but it's a bit washed out and doesn't quite pack the punch that I was hoping to find. It's not super sour, though I wouldn't call it sweet. The finish has more of that tannic oak flavor. Mouthfeel is nice, though I'd prefer it to be a bit creamier and less fizzy. So far, this is my least favorite Logsdon beer, but my expectations have grown so much with each beer that it's probably not a terribly fair scale. Still, I probably won't be picking up any more bottles of this beer. On the other hand, I'd be happy to get a glass at a bar."
""
"Overall: A good sour but by no means amazing. None of the flavors really shone and it ended up being less complex than I would've wanted."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice Flanders red ale. Good barrel character and nice yeast flavors come through."
"O - Hard to place, smooth, woody, fruit and silky."
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some malt, fruit, and vinegar aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic finish on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall: Well crafted and enjoyable, like all the Logsdon beers I've had thus far."
