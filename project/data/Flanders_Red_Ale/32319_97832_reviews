"O-  Not bad with a nice unique twist on a traditional Flanders Red throwing in a fruity blueberry presence.  The base beer however was fairly average for me with a little bit too much acidity."

"Pour is a murky muddy purple with a thin pink head that dissipates immediately.  Not really much blueberry in the nose, tons of rubber, acetic acid, and plastic.  There is a faint blueberry skin in there, but not the dominant aroma.  Taste has a bit more blueberry, fairly juicy, a touch meaty.  Acetic acid isn't as strong as I thought from the nose, a fair bit of it through the finish. Some rubbery notes mid palate. Fuller body, a bit granule, very dry and moderate carb."

"Overall - The sourness is just too intense and unpleasant for me."

"Good introduction to the Cory King way, cheers!"

"O:  tastes like Fuzzy but with blueberries.  The blueberries really come through which is nice.  The yogurty, vinegary taste is a bit harsh but unique.  If you like blueberry yogurt, this is the beer for you."

"Verdict: A very, very enjoyable blueberry sour from Side Project. The base beer carries the fruit superbly well and stays bright and delicate rather than heavy and muddled. It's complex, balanced and very well developed and that pucker sensation at the finish is perfection itself."
""

""
""
"It's a fantastic beer.  Extremely sour, so if that's not your thing you probably won't like it.  The blueberries are well done and don't overpower, though I'm not sure anything can overpower the pucker."
""
"After drinking this, I have major trader's regret for giving up a far better beer, but oh well...at least I got to try it. Fuzzy got my expectations up a little too much I suppose."

"O- Very good, I'm not sure its worth what it trades for, but I'm very glad to have tried this one. Very good stuff, but I'm starting to get the sense that Side Project has that particular lacto flavour in all of their beers so far."

"Poured from bottle. Pours a chunky purplish red with visible remnants of blueberry flesh and skins, somewhat hazy appearance. Not sure if all bottles pour this way or if this needed more time in the fridge to settle out. Appearance isn't the prettiest but I'm going to let that slide due to the strengths in the other categories. The nose has a very classic flanders red nose with heavy oak, strong acetic qualities as well as some tannic notes. Tart blueberries bring a brightness to the acidity and pair well with the wine character. The taste is expertly balance as per Side Project fashion. Blueberries come through with strong tartness and a hint of juicy muffin like sweetness. This quickly gives way to heavy oak and Chardonnay notes. Finish is tart and leaves the palate wanting more. Mouthfeel is well carbonated with a medium body. Overall, delicious. The fruited brews that Side Project has released so far are ridiculously tastey (as are the others) and I will continue to seek out the future releases."

"Overall: I missed trying a sample of this beer a few years back when it made an appearance at 2012 FoBAB under the Perennial Artisan Ales brand. It haunted me until today. Really glad that I got a chance to try this beer! Nice twist on the Flanders Red style using blueberries, it actually makes this beer smell and taste more like a fruit lambic that of a Flanders Red style sour ale. Irreguardless what a fantastic sour beer! It did not dissapoint at all."

"This has developed nicely, the sharp acidity and tartness has died quite a bit which is a good think for this beer. Starting to get a little more blueberry flavors on the finish and it's actually moving towards tasting like blueberry pie-esque. I think more time will help this beer out even more. Really happy with the progress in taste on this beer."

"The beer pours a dark garnet maroon color speckled by coarse sediment and topped by a thin off white head that fades quickly. The nose has a slight blueberry/cherry acetic kick, some funk and saline, and bb muffiny malts as it warms. There is mostly Flanders upfront, but it finishes with lingering tart, acidic blueberry skin. It's a surprisingly tart and acidic, medium bodied, and minimally carbonated Flanders, that has a subtle, yet distinct blueberry profile. I don't pick up tremendous oak, and the expected cherry-like fruitiness is neck-and-neck with the blueberries. I would gladly drink this beer again and expect it to develop in a really fantastic way."
"Overall, this is a very good beer, but I really have no frame of reference with another blueberry sour to compare it to. Personally, I would have liked to see this one stray a little more towards the blueberry profile and away from the flanders acidic sour qualities, but that being said, it is still among the best flanders reds I've had. And the blueberries add a great dimension."

"O - Overall, this is a really good and tart sour full of fresh blueberry juice. I was really impressed by this and thought it was one of the better blueberry sours that I've ever had. Usually, blueberry sours don't have a lot of blueberry presence but this one was loaded with juicy blueberry goodness"

"Improved aroma and taste, no plastic or acetic notes. Fruit juice and melted Popsicle, very sour, hard to drink in quantity, but good. Raising scores across the board."
