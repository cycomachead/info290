Tart berry notes balance the acidity nicely. As the ale moved toward the aftertaste, one detects a hint of woodiness from barrel aging.

Pours a brown ale with cherry hues and a good broken sheet of light cream foam. Smells of sweet balsamics, some brown sugar and some oak. There is the vinegar tone, indicating the tart quality, but the nose lacks depth for me. Flavor has a nice tartness, cherries, oak, hint of bourbon, slightly bitter, and a hint of sweetness. I like the balance in this one. Medium bodied with lower carb and a dry finish. Nice beer, the nose does not match the flavor, but it is a nice beer.","harrymel","Aug 30, 2012"

Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a murky reddish/amber color with an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, it smells like vinegar, tart and sweet cherries, wood, green sour apples, funk and a bit of vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma. It tastes like tart and sweet cherries, vinegar, lemon peel, funk, wood, vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon flavor isn't strong in this brew at all, but I think the subtle bourbon taste works well with the tartness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and slick with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a pretty nice overall brew.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, tart, and subtle funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, tart, sour, wood, cherry, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really enjoyed this one as a nice followup to the 50/50 Eclipses we had previously. It did a nice job of cleansing the palate and still shining through with all its glory. The flavor was my favorite part as it was quite complex and very well balance.
