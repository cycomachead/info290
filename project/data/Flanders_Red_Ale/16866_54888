3.84,-10.3,3.25,3.5,4,4,4,"On tap at The Bruery poured into taster. Appearance is hazy brown-red with a tall white head that settles to a ring. Some lacing. Aroma is a little funky, but mostly sour, led by tart cherries, red wine vinegar, wood, and leather. Taste is strongly sour with acidic and vinegar notes. Some woody bitterness and malty sweetness offer some balance. Medium bodied, slightly slick, lively prickly carbonation, long puckering finish.","SierraFlight","Mar 01, 2015"

Excuse my ignorant-to-sours palate, but honestly, there are just a lot of the similar flavors. I do love their yeast or whatever the hell they use, though... this is (of course) puckering, with a nice bit of oak barrel character and some dark fruit and malt sweetness. I'm glad to have tried this beer, but I just would have liked it a lot more had it been my first Bruery beer. At this point, they're starting to taste too similar and just not worth their $20 a 750ml price tag. Regardless, if you like sours, you'll like this one -- Bruery still has some of the best out there.","Alextricity","Jan 10, 2015"

Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense light khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big ripe sour cherry, cranberry, raisin, prune, red grape, oak, vinegar, leather, clove, toast, brown sugar, light vanilla, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast and oak notes with a great malt/acidic balance; and great strength. Taste of big ripe sour cherry, cranberry, raisin, prune, red grape, vanilla, oak, vinegar, toast, clove, brown sugar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice amount of acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, red grape, raisin, prune, vanilla, oak, clove, brown sugar, vinegar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of sour fruity/funky yeast and oak flavors; with a great balance of malt/acidity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and nicely acidic/crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Flanders red ale style! All around fantastic complexity and balance of sour fruity/funky yeast and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the great malt/acidity balance. An extremely amazing offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

I am intrigued enough by this beer to drink a lot of it, and its quite enjoyable, but at this price their are other serviceable options to get my flanders fix. top quality as always from the bruery.","StonedTrippin","Dec 19, 2013"

Big time sour vinegar aroma, stronger than any other sour I have had. Maybe some light sweet apples and cherries as well. Flavor follows with a massive hit of sour, some light funky vinegar, and a bit of sour fruits. There is a big dry oak influence here that differentiates this from others I have had in the style. Light sweet malts remain on the palate. This was heavier than the Berazzled, and definitely hit the taste buds hard. Enjoyable.","BMMillsy","Nov 08, 2013"

4.05,-5.4,4.25,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Overall: Wow, this one was a lot more sour than I was expecting. Definitely the most sour of its style for me. Nice cherry and sour flavors in there, but just a tad sour for me - would prefer it if it were a bit more balanced. Still a quality brew of the style and quite tasty. I am wondering if this might be a bit older than my 2012 estimate from the carbonation and flavor profile.","Resuin","Oct 29, 2013"

4.37,2.1,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall, it was tough to decide what we enjoyed most about this brew, as it was a tossup between its nose, its flavoring, and its soft, fluffy feel. From the first whiff you get an idea of just how high quality and well thought out this beer is. The aroma is subtle and nuanced, but yet still knocks you to the ground with its bright sourness of fruit, wood, dangerously deep grain, and yeasty funk. The flavoring follows as best as anything could, with the same interplay of wild depth, generous fruit and tartness, and inlaid woody warmth. The flavors are sweet, but effectively tart, with the final blend striking an amazingly easy sipping balance that defies warmth and environment. This is helped along by the mouthfeel that affords high carbonation and nice prickle, appropriate to the level of pucker, but also gives big frothy creaminess on the swirl around the mouth, helping to add buoyancy and body to the diving deepness of the flavor profile. This is an incredible beer for the style, and for the brewery’s sour/tart lineup, and if you are a fan of either, then this is a must-have.","TheBrewo","Sep 05, 2013"

4.18,-2.3,4.5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Glad to be finally trying this stuff, especially considering my man Ryan has been lauding it forever. It pours a clear garnet (roby tones...?) topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises tart cherry, red wine vinegar, mild oak, light graham cracker, and a bit of sour blue raspberry. The taste brings in more of the same, the tartness in full form for most of the show, though a vein of very mild molasses seems to enter stage left near the finish and stays through the encore, mellowing things slightly and dancing provocatively with the graham cracker and oak. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine sour, not quite what I would think of when ""Flanders Red"" is spoken, but a thoroughly enjoyable American take on the classic style. Good times.","TMoney2591","Aug 31, 2013"

The malt, yeast, and bacteria all cooperate nicely leading to a final product that seeks not to challenge but to showcase some traditional qualities. None shine brighter in the final tally than the wood influence.","beagle75","May 25, 2013"

It pours even deeper than ruby, with a mahogany tint to it. Not as much of a tart smell as I've gotten in others, but the oaken notes come right out of the bottle and hit you from a few feet away. You also get the barrel in the taste, and it's not so sour that it curls your eye shut. It has a perfect balance of everything, and even has a bit of alcohol burn that I have never tasted in a sour. It has a clean finish, and doesn't linger past its welcome.","yankeepride","Apr 28, 2013"

The mouthfeel is sweet and then tart, finishing exceedingly dry. It's very drinkable and refreshing with my duck, venison, and veggie medley...yeah that's how I roll the day after thanksgiving.

Head retention is alright, and lacing is pretty sparse. The nose has lots of very tart cherries, along with a little bit of oak. The flavor profile has a bit of leather and tobacco to it, some kind of combination of oxidation and a little bit of brettanomyces. There's also the requisite vinous acidity and cherry notes, with that same subtle hint of wood from the nose providing the finish. There's a tannic, mouth-puckering quality to the beer, which I suppose is to be expected, The body is suitaby dry, but th carbonation just feels a little lackluster.

4.05,-5.4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with a half inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice but seems a little weak to me. The brew smells like tart cherries, red wine, grapes, vinegar and oak. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma. It tastes like tart cherries, red grapes, vinegar, oak, lemon, vanilla and also an earthy/leathery flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has low/moderate carbonation. I think it's a good beer, I enjoyed drinking it. It's a bit pricey at $18.99 a bottle, but I'd probably buy it again at that price.","bluejacket74","Sep 27, 2012"

4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a dark brown red with a creamy white ring of head on the edges. It’s too dark to really see through it and is hazy to boot, but there do seem to be bubbles traveling up the sides to suggest carbonation. The lacing stays on as a clinging ring of sticky dry bubbles. The beer smells like leathery dark cherry with a slight alcoholic bite in the back of the nose; it’s as if a dried cherry strip were created and then liquefied. Malt backbone is faint, but seems to be sweet and caramely. The tart cherry smell is the entirety of the bitters in this beer. There is also a faint note of creamy chocolate in the nose’s base which may also be the malt. The beer tastes puckeringly tart and cherry fruity with a faint chocolaty feel in the middle and a slight aftertaste. The tart cherry is the main taste in this beer though, and it shines through. Alcohol is completely hidden in the taste, blending in with the tartness to completely mask itself. There is also a great funk that hits the back of the tongue and suggests some fantastic spiciness. Vanilla notes are also present in the middle and aftertaste that provide a sweet and creamy taste. Mouthfeel is puckering and tart with the sour (obviously). The carbonation, however, is completely velvety and smooth, with a slight chewiness. Overall this is a fantastic beer. I already love the complexity of the beer’s flavor. This is admittedly my first Flemish red, and I am very happy with what it has proven to be. This beer is obviously worth a taste for anyone that’s a beer lover, especially sour beer lovers, and is also worth a try for anyone that loves sour tastes, especially Warheads! Try this beer.","Maxwell","Sep 13, 2012"

Huge lemony tartness with hints of barnyard funk hit right up front. Sour cherries and a hint of sweetness sweep across the gullet before finishing with a lingering sweet sour and funky aftertaste.

4.12,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! I was lucky enough to get to try the Oude Tart with Sour Cherries awhile back, so let's see how this one compares... Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a reddish brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, slight funk, cherry, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, funk, sour, and slight tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The key difference between this brew and the other was that the cherries aren't nearly as pronounced in this one. This cuts back on the sour/tart aspect of this one a little bit. However this one is still quite enjoyable. The aroma and flavor here are quite well balanced and keep you guessing on what the overwhelming note will be the next time you go in for a sip. Definitely worth trying or getting your hands on.","thagr81us","Jun 10, 2011"

I definitely like the body of this brew, it has some texture to it, but it is still fairly quaffable and the zippy carbonation helps to lighten things up enough. I feel like I shouldn’t like this as much as I am as it seems to be lacking in complexity, but damn, I am enjoying this quite a bit. The flavors are so well integrated and the oak / wine notes are at such a soft, integrated level that just makes this beer work quite well. Really it is the oak / wine notes that make this beer in the end, without them this beer would really need something or it wouldn’t be nearly as tasty as it is.","Gueuzedude","May 10, 2011"

Upfront on the nose it had a big vinegar aroma alongside oaky funky barrel, vinous, and mild acidic notes. The vinegar and vinous flavor are more apparent on the palate with cherries, oaky, funky, and dark fruit accents but with mild acidic tart character. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, acidic, oaky, and tart finish.

The pour is cola brown with a creamy, slowly dissipating beige head. The smell, while reminesect of Rodenbach, is earthier. Taste is along the lines of an aged Rodenbach - NOT the Grand Cru.

The flavor is balanced between sweet malts and tartness and acidity from the yeast and barrel aging. Flavors of vanilla, light caramel are very clear. Also dark berries plentry of oak and a little leather. Easy to drink thanks to the pleasant carbonation level. Body and tartness match up well.

4.6,7.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall this was just what it was supposed to be. It is truly a breath of fresh air what the Bruery is doing. So far so good. everything has lived up to and exceed my expectations.","mikesgroove","Jan 24, 2010"
4.3,0.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Draugh at the bruery. Red-brown with a big beige head. Oaky, tart, fruity aroma with some vinegar and burnt fig. The wine barrel influence really sets this appart from gypsey tart, and the sourness is about perfect, making it very drinkable but clean and dry in the finish while having a nIce malt character up front. A little mellow for a top-tier American sour ale, but the flavor complexity is there. Killer with food.","bulletrain76","Jan 24, 2010"
4.8,12.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Drinkability: This is by far the easiest drinking sour I've ever had. I could drink this all day...well, until I pass out, anyway.","weirdboy","Jan 22, 2010"

4.58,7,4.5,4,5,3.5,5,"EDIT: Patrick BMed me with some helpful information that has resolved my question re: Flanders Red vs. Oud Bruin. Methinks there are a few reds that are currently misclassified.","davod23","Jan 19, 2010"
4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This was the first release for 2010 for the Bruery and I was greatly impressed. This was one of the first beers made by Tyler and the Bruery gang and it has been aging in the red wine barrels for 18 months, so far a great start to 2010 with the release of this delicious beer.","Schmaltzy","Jan 17, 2010"
4.2,-1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"High drinkability. Overall a great Flemish red. Not quite Top 100 level as the current rAvg puts it, but very good.","nickd717","Jan 17, 2010"
4.05,-5.4,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The dark cherry was the standout nose, followed closely by oak. The taste was a very similar story and the dry cabernet-esque taste almost vaporized on the back end of the palate (nice). In a blind taste test I dont know if I could tell this beer from LaFolie, which is by no means an insult... I love the hell out of that beer. I just really hoped for a characteristic to grab me by the booboo","gregmoscetti","Jan 17, 2010"
4.47,4.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Outstanding, The Bruery's made another great sour. More classic and traditional in flavour than the Sour in the Rye which was great in itself, a beer to give Rodenbach Grand Cru a run for its money.","Halcyondays","Jan 17, 2010"
4.35,1.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: A very nice example of a Flanders red/brown ale. Some people compared it to Rodenbach Grand Cru, but I found it to be a little less oaky and vinous, and a bit more drinkable. I plan to drink these bottles fairly soon as they taste wonderful now.","womencantsail","Jan 15, 2010"

4.18,-2.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - I could probably drink one more...and then another. It's pretty delicious, and with the oak notes present, it probably would setup well for aging.","Kaiser81","Dec 26, 2009"
4.42,3.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Quite spot-on for a classic Flemish style, fairly handily the most authentic American take on it that I have tasted. Undoubtedly the long eighteen month maturation in oak had great results. Eighteen months ago The Bruery had only just begun brewing, and to have this kind of dedication so early on speaks volumes. This is a very tasty beer as it is, lots of cherry and tartness that appeals to my American sensibilities, but also an impressive version of a classic style.","vacax","Dec 19, 2009"
