"Decent aroma.  Very nice, fruity and quite tart flavor.  Minimal funk. Lacks the complexity, including the off-notes, of some Belgian versions."

"Bright glowing cherry red color, no head. Seems to be a theme with sour beers. Aroma is fantastic. Sweet and softly tart cherries, vanilla liquor (very slightly), and musky wood. Recognizable aromas but very well arranged. Taste is tart and perky. Fruity with an evenly spread funk. Oaky and almost a super tangy orange kind of tart, plus cherries of course. More people should have this beer."

"Hazy reddish color with a small, fizzling head. Sour, fruity aroma with cherries, oak, and malt. Not very acidic. Flavor opens with tart cherry, berries, light vanilla, low funk, malty background providing a pleasant sweetness. Some light tannins are mixed in and some tasty grain lingers long after the fruit fades. Puckering, medium body with a long dry finish. Delicious, authentic, and very well done!"
