Its moderate and medium tone will be the crutch for the die-hard Flanders fans, but for those just stepping into sour ales, Soulless will provide the much needed comfort.","BEERchitect","Mar 23, 2015"

3.59,9.8,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Bring on the Flemish! Looks like sherry in my glass after the head quickly dies down. Decent Flemish character on this. Typical cherries, mild wood, that somewhat sweet fruit funk. Not bad. Feel is slightly thin, but that seems to be a standard amongst American interpretations of this style. I am biased towards this style, but I think it is a good example.","RblWthACoz","Mar 06, 2015"

That being said, I have brewed more style-appropriate Flanders at home by kettle-souring the wort and fermenting with all Brett. I'm disappointed in this, and I was really hoping for more.","zimm421","Feb 28, 2015"
