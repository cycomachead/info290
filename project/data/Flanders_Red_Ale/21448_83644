4.06,6.3,3,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is sour and tart with some fruit, wine, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same along with a slight buttery flavor and an acidic finish on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and solid flavor.","UCLABrewN84","Beers"

3.7,-3.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a murky dark orange/amber color with an off-white head. The lactic acidity comes through nicely up front, lots of lemon to it. Only a mild funkiness with some oak, red wine, and a bit of must. A solid aroma. The flavor is kind of a let down. Itâ€™s a bit watery, but it is moderately tart with some grape, cherry, and lemon fruitiness. A little bit of oak and wine flavor, but very minimal funk. Would have been really good if not for the watered down flavor.","womencantsail","0"
