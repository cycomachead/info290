"Has an interesting red wine vinegar finish. Very tasty!"
""
""
""
"Incredibly complex balanced flavor that lingers forever."

"You can taste the oak. Great beer!"

"awful taste of malt vinegar with weird sweetness to it.  If this isnt a spoiled bottle there is something seriously wrong with the brewers cuz this is the worst beer I have drank including an infect Vanilla Noir from Prairie. I feel like this would work well poured onto an Itallian sub as dressing."
""
""
"Very enjoyable and complex taste, thus this one's well-recommended."

"If you like sour beers this is a great one."
"The nose was really vinegar'y. The taste was alright. The only thing I really liked about it was a little wheat finish"
"Sourness and tartness are extremely high, the beer has a light body and a nice carbonation"
"Tart nose with slight wet horse blanket, red fruit not much hop, malt with slight chocolate. Pours brilliant reddish brown, not a lot of head. On the palate ripe and over ripe fruit with cherries at the front with the sour coming on by the middle and then a slight touch of hops, finishes a little sweet â€“ almost like they added some sweetness to increase the marketability. Medium body, medium low carbonation, no alcohol, slightly creamy, very sweet finish. Overall Impression: the head was somewhat light, drinkable but too sweet. Lacking complexity. Should be drier."
""
"$20 a four pack and it is god awful...holy f'n s. This  beer blows!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Good example of a sour.  Tart solar to cider but with a pleasant malty sweetness."
"Cheers to Flanders and the Duchesse- try it! You'll certainly be trying something unique."
""
"Looks great, smells great, tastes like you're drinking straight vinegar - and feels like it on the way down! I appreciate a good sour beer but this is not one"
""
""
""
""
"O: This has been a drain pour the last two times I've tried it. Again, I'm a big fan of the style, but this seems very different."
""
"Maybe I'm just not into these types of Belgians, but it had a bacterial flavor to it that was not appetizing to me or my friends."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ok, so I really am not a fan of this style, BUT I can certainly respect every aspect of this drink. The bold fragrance that carried so much complexity to the taste the mirrored the complexity. vinegar, dark fruit, sour patch kid sort of sourness up front wit a slightly salty finish. Well balanced, well crafted and certainly (most likely) an icon for the style."
"For a Flander red I guess it's good but ick no one should really like drinking vinegar."
""

"This might be  the worst thing I have ever put it my mouth. The texture is fantastic; The color is also perfect. Let me say this, if you have always wanted to down a bottle of Balsamic vinegar then this is the best bottle for you. If you prefer a tasty sour beer do not go with this. I am extremely disappointed and puzzled why this beer has such a high ranking. It is $11-12 and I feel like I am now forced to drink it. Let me just drink a bottle of gasoline and anthrax instead. Bleck!!!"
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty amazingly good sour"
"If you like vinegar (specifically balsamic), you have to try this on draught."
""
"One of my favorites of this style. Smooth taste, easy drinking."
"O: As far as I am concerned, this is the holy-grail of sour ales. So enjoyable and interesting. I really like this beer, and would happily enjoy it over and over again. Definitely needs to be on  your ""to try"" list!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Way better on tap than in a bottle. I've had both and the bottle can end up soapy smelling."
""
"An amazing drinking experience, my first Flanders Red and what a treat it was. The obvious tangy sour qualities were marvelously complemented by an almost balsamic vinegar-like note that was both sweet and savory. A tremendous choice to accompany pasta with a rich, hearty Bolognese sauce due to that outstanding acidity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are very few beers that I will not finish and this is surely one of those. I'll admit the appearance of the bear is quite nice, with a dark brown/ruby like color. In terms of the nose, the cherries are the most noticeable with vinegar and pomegranate coming in a close second. However, the taste of the beer did not agree with me at all, although it is possible that this was just a bad batch. Overall, I felt there was way too much vinegar and when combined with the richness of the beer, made me feel sick enough to only handle a few sips. On top of that, the beer had a very metallic aftertaste which was very unpleasant and unlike any other sour I have experienced. My brother who was with me had the same experience tasting this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Amazing sour beer.. slightly tangy smell of wine with sour pomegranate taste with a tangy end."
""
""
"Taste:  Black cherry, plum, raspberry tartness at the end.  Some pepper in the middle and at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Such a fantastic Flanders red. Explosive and complex flavors abound. Starts or somewhat tart and finishes clean and fruity."
""
"O:  Tasty and refreshing with its slightly dominant vinegar note in scent its only major drawback."
"The rating below comes from multiple bottles over a period of several years: Pours a clear reddish to plum brown or ruby/garnet throughout when held to the light, producing 1.5 fingers of tan, finely bubbled foam, sometimes moderately lasting, sometimes shortlived head that recedes into a thin cap leaving a good coating of lace or sometimes no lace at all. Aroma is acetic & vinous, caramel malt, tart cherry, dark grape & cranberry with some woody, earthy hints. Taste is fronted by a battle of sweet & sour cherry, strawberry & some grape overlaying a thin maltiness backed by musty yeast, a metallic quantity and a peppery spice. The mid-sip is honey & grape with a ""Sweet Tart"" candy note. The finish is a faintly malty, sour yeastiness, dry with tart cherries, green apples & spice with distinct wood & metallic notes. The aftertaste is astringent & very dry with hints of oak, metal, cherries and apples. Mouthfeel is lively & medium bodied with decent carbonation, forward juicy,  finishing dry & drawing. Very Complex!"
""
""
""
""
"It has a taste that sharply distinguishes itself form other beers. Meant to be drunk in small quantities (as it tastes like red wine), not in huge gulps. Not really one that is meant to be brought into those ""crazy"" parties and events to get drunk. Rather, it is an essential for the beer connoisseur."
""
""
"Overwhelming vinegar and sourness made it difficult to drink."
""
""
"The sour taste is interesting but I really like it."
""
"All time favorite. The aroma is intriguing, with fruit and vinegar. Tart, slightly acidic taste but fruity and bold."
""
"Great Belgian sour red. Definitely enjoyed having this on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It does not taste like wolf pussy."
"O: This is my second sour beer, didn't enjoy the first one, but this one is a lot better. The sour vinegar aromas and flavors turned me off at first, but then I notice there is some subtle cherry, berry aromas and flavors in the beer. Highly recommend if you're into sours and will definitely drink again."
""
""
"o: I have been wary of Flanders Reds as well as Lambics and Saisons (although in the last category I have had a few exceptionally fine ones) because I am generally not a fan of sours and have had a bad ""drain pour"" experience or two with them.  But this is like an elegant strong hard fruit cider.  Looks great and tastes healthy while rivetiting your attention on the flavor."
"Damn near a perfect flanders red"
""
""
""
"O: Again, the style is not my favorite, but I can guess this is true to the style guidelines. Appearance was very nice, smell ended up being nice, the flavor just okay for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"Reddish brown in color, smells like  apple cider/balsamic vinegar. Mouth feel is quite pleasant, crisp and highly carbonated. Taste is like an aged balsamic vinegar with hints of apple cider vinegar and a touch of grape. Well balanced sweet and sour notes. My favorite of the Flemish Red Ales."
""
"A little vinegary, but pretty good overall.  Cherry, oak.  More vinegary than sour.  Tasty."
""
""
""
""
"This poured (12oz bottle) a deep, reddish-brown into my snifter. There were very small bubbles, and a 'soda pop' like carbonation which quickly disappated. The aromas of red wine vinegar were very dominant, and with some concentration a bit of oak was also there. This was quite tart on the palate (and I am pretty new to sours), lots of dark cherry notes, and a bit of the vinegary note on the back end. Very nice actually. A rich, smooth mouthfeel that coated the palate and hung around for a spell. Overall, this beer was far greater than the sum of its parts. While I enjoyed the components (taste, appearance, etc), as a whole this was one of the phemomenal beer experiences that I have enjoyed. Will seek out again, as well as dig further into the style."
""
"Definitely an acidity to the main sour note, and the oak is very present as well along with some peach and other dark fruit.  head was a little foamy for my liking."
"V - Good value, available in a single bomber and a four pack of bottles."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe this isn't for me. I thought it tasted just like vinegar"
"Not good from a bomber, as my bier waitress noted"
""
"This is supposedly a red ale but it's deep brown with a reddish-crimson tinge, never seen a beer look this cool. Has a short beige head that leaves small amounts of lacing. The aroma is incredible, smells of red wine, Belgian yeast, malts, cherries, plums, roasted sugars. The taste is outstanding, it is sweet and tangy but that is a over simplification. Reminiscent of a framoise, the beer is tangy and sweet but not a fruity sweetness, more of a light yeast and wheat and grains sweetness. The beer is incredibly balanced, there is no resistance, I could down this whole body without fail if I wanted to. But I want to savor it. It is full bodied but the carbonation is on the low side but is complimented by the other aspects of the beer. Overall, this might be one of the best beers I've ever had, sure it was expensive, but I won't come by a beer like this in a long time."
"A bottle from 2009 and may well be past its prime. Flat, thin, and sour upon first pour; it opened up nicely after standing with uch of the sour flavor that dominated the first sip dissipated. Some nice complexity remained and a nice Belgian red still wait in the bottle."
""
""
""
"Smells extremely sour and vinegary. However, the taste is much sweeter than the smell indicates. Initially I liked it a lot but by the end of the bottle it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Mouthfeel is one of the best I've ever experienced."
"This is my first sour so I have nothing to compare it to.  But I really enjoyed this beer.  I would definitely purchase it again.  Very refreshing & complex.  I will have to experiment more with this style."
""
""
"Love sours,  this tasted like vinegar only"
"Everything went as expected with this beer, until the taste. I won't lie, it was maybe too sweet for my personal expectations, but damned if I didn't drink every drop. Unapologetically sweet but still complex, it was almost like a red champagne, or one of those sparkling juices for wagon-riders. Would drink again, but I want an aged one next time, to see how that sweetness sours up."
""
""
""
""
"I generally don't like sour Belgian beers, but this one was exceptional, literally. Deep, fruity, and complex."
""
""
""
"A delicious, dependable sour. Pours dark brown, with a ruby hue. Acidity, sour tart, cherries, lots of dark fruit and malt complexity. Brown sugar underneath. Slight vinegar. Just delicious."
""
""
""
"O: Slightly sweeter than Jacobins. Making it slightly less drinkable."
""
""
""
"Great starter sour. Not overly sour or bitter. Very light refreshing beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sour definitely not tart, subtle maple sweetness on the end"

"O: I really enjoyed this beer, as I said at the beginning I had tasted this beer before but did not remember it. Looking back, the first time I tried it, I remember tasting pure vinegar, it was bad and disappointing, however it incidentally, (as I said before) it got a second chance to make a first impression and I'm glad it did. I was, while writing this review, initially questioning whether this beer had a purpose when placed next to abt. 12 on draft seeing as they are very similar, I have concluded that there is a place for both of these in your glass, when you can't afford to be knocked on your ass, this is a great alternative to abt. 12 since it's lower in alcohol, additionally, there is a subtle difference in flavor that is enough to justify this beers existence. very satisfied overall."

"Tastes like worcestershire sauce and vinegar, would make a good marinade. I don't know how people come up with tart berries or plums, but to each there own."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aromas of balsamic vinegar and dark fruit. I get a lot of vinegar in the taste but just enough to balance the sweetness of the plum and grape flavors. Mouthfeel is soft but well carbonated. Overall a very interesting beer. Much more complex than I had anticipated."

"Tart, with sour apple and cherry flavors emerging after initial taste.  The sort of sourness you feel in your jaw.  Initial flavor and smell is almost vinegar in its sharpness and astringency."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very interesting. Pours dark hazel/brown with a tan head that traces the glass. The smell is full of sour fruit like cherries as well as a little vinegar. The taste was heavy sour in the beginning with cherries and raspberry flavors which then mellowed and came back for a heavy finish. Very tasty. Mouthfeel was a tad syrupy but it worked for the style. Very impressive, would highly recommend."
""
""
"O: I appreciate the complexity in flavor of the beer, but for my tastes, it is overly sweet. I enjoy a more tart flanders red rather than full-bodied sweet flanders. Overall it was a nice drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance has a crystal clarity and a ruby brown color with a thin yet always present light tan head.  To the nose, there is wine like light vinegary aroma with no hop presence.  The mouth feel is effervescent and there is a tartness on the front of the tongue that doesn't have the dramatic pucker of some sours.  There seems to be an almost oakey middle with a sweet finish.   Overall nicely balanced RBA."

""
""
""

"Pours a clear red-brown, one finger of dense cream colored foam, delicate islands of lace on the glass. Smell: overripe apricot, quite oaky with herbal notes. Taste: tart nectarine, fruity sweet / acidic combo as in pineapple juice, white flesh plum, craisins and cherry juice towards the finish. Sweet fruit, quite tart, with plenty of oak character. Medium bodied and a bit syrupy with a sugary finish. Tasty, if not a little on the sweet side."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very similar to wine,  goes perfect with steak...."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really excellent brew.  Impressive layers shine throughout and venture into deep depths of complexity.  The finish is surprisingly crisp yet refreshing which keeps the drinker coming back for more."
""
""
"overall, this is quite good. the red wine similarities are evident, but i prefer this to a wine (duh, itâ€™s beer, itâ€™s not a soulless drink!). the sour notes are in great balance with the dark fruits, and the medium carbonation makes this all the more palatable. at 6%, itâ€™s quite easy drinking. will seek out again."
""
""
""
"I  personally love the taste and this is currently my favorite beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This fell short really only on the level of sour (for me..) Every other profile that the Flemish Red Ale is famous for, this one has. The deep red color, the tart aroma, the cherries in the flavor. Excellent."
""
"Cloudy ruby red pour with a beige one-finger head. Aroma is of dark fruit, vinegar and oak wine barrels. Very tart dark fruit flavor upfront. Can taste maraschino cherries, blackberry and light plum. Finishes slightly sweet with a slight tartness that fades fairly quickly."

"Pours a brilliant amber with a frothy beige head. Tart cherry and acetic acid open the aroma, with toasted oak and vinous qualities adding complexity. Flavor is very acetic, with toasted barrel drying out the finish. Tart cherries and balsamic vinegar are evident. Puckeringly sour, with cherry lingering in the finish. Slightly spicy, phenolic aftertaste."

""
"Though it's a great bargain at $13 a bottle, Duchesse ran into the same issue as many craft beers. Despite being one of my favorites not five years ago, the last few years have been much sweeter and has lost that perfect balance of sweet and sour. Get back to your roots Duchesse, we miss you already!"

"An excellent sour â€“ very typical of the style. The sourness gives a refreshing tang."
""
""
""
""
"This was one of those beers that I always eyed when I saw it, but not being a huge fan of overly yeasty belgians I always stayed away. Figured I'd give this a shot after looking into it and finding out that it was a sour. Its definitely one of those beers to 'experience' pretty unique combination of stuff going on. If you like lambics / sours its definitely for you, if not, you will probably not enjoy this."
""
""
""
""
"Tart and complex, loads of fruit and phenol, some elegant vinegar and tasty soil. If you like your sour more than unidimensional which seems to be the trend, this is the beer. Deep brown with tartness that can still come off a little sweet. Flavors are melded but all play the same part in a rich symphony."

"O: One of my favorite brews. In North Texas, price ranges between $3-5/bottle, and I'd say it's well worth the cost. On the few occasions I have been able to find the larger bottles (shaped like the apollinaris, volume like a bomber) I snatch up as many bottles as I can carry. Worth the money every time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark red, almost brown with short, but persistent tan head. Smell is complex and satisfying. Sour cherries, fig, molasses, and a Red wine vinegar tartness. Taste (after you get over the initial sweetness) is sour cherries, some wood, and maybe apple. Mouthfeel is a nice carbonation and a good pretty dry finish. Overall I like it, it's obviously a quality brew and easy to drink, but it's not my favorite Flanders, wish it was a tad more on the sour side."
""
""
""

"O: First time with this classic sour and I'm glad I finally picked one up. Sours are growing on me and I can't say I mind that!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25/5): Duchesse is a very good Belgian sour that gets a lot right: it has a great balance of tart and sweet, an excellent nose, and looks very nice in the glass. I do wish it featured better carbonation for sure, but that doesn't detract too much from the beer's overall quality. Very good, and I concur with others on BA that this is a good introductory sour."

"O - This is a great Flanders. Sweet, sour, and very well balanced. The perfect beginner sour."
""
""
""

"O-yay. Very good. More complex than Rodenbach Classic with a good wallop of tartness to keep sour fans happy."
""
"A good starter belgian. A bit too sweet for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: mostly mentioned above, but this seems like a soured up barleywine, or a tart semi-dry wine."
"Smells vingary at first. Great follow. Kombychka like. Awesome beer. If I could brew beers at hone I would give thus shit a shot. You need a deserni g palate for this shiz. Give it a whirl. Trying yo make a 250 word review and all I can say is ""You gotta Try this shiz"" not annormal beer."

"Overall: Great in all other aspects, but a bit of a letdown in the taste. There's some nice complexity there, but the sweetness is a bit distracting. If the sweetness were turned down and the sourness/acidity turned up a bit, this would be excellent. It's worth a try if you haven't had it, but if you're looking for a regular Flanders Red fix, just stick to Rodenbach Grand Cru"

"a very intense sour beer compared to the handful I've tried. big earthy almost grassy aroma, hints of alcohol, some cherry. just a hint of sour mold. flavor has lot of green apple and cherry, reminds me of a jolly rancher. drinks really smooth and clean and coats the mouth well"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on tap into a 10 oz tulip glass. A very deep red with almost no light transparency and a creamy off white inch head. It has a very red wine like nose with the bitter sweetness. This is my first sour so I can't judge too much but it has a good sour sweet wine taste like a dessert wine or something. It has a crisp mouth feel with a moist finish. Overall quite nice for my first sour. It was aged and cellared by my local Beer Shoppe and I was lucky to try it."

"Overall: Lots of fruity sweetness but tastefully held back by the nice funkyness, acidic bite and pleasant barrel notes. The comparisons to red wine make sense. I wouldnâ€™t mind trying an older bottle to see if the sweetness takes a step back to more acidic/sour notes."

"On tap at Global Brew. Smells of sour fruit, vinegar, earth. Deep ruby color with an inch thick head. Flavors of red wine, wood, sour cherry, subtle funk. Finishes clean. A very approachable sour and a good place to start if you're just getting in to them."

"Overall: Even though this beer is honestly like nothing else I've ever had, it still remains one of my favorites. It's complex yet very easy to drink; full-bodied and fun. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to try something truly new."
"Flanders red-brown ales never fail to impress and satisfy me, and this is no exception. Exceptionally delicate and nuanced, this is a fantastic brew, and should be accessible and drinkable even to sour novices."
"Overall - This is a good beer, will have to try more of this style. I recommend this though something tells me others in the style are less sweet and more sour. I still dug it."
""
""
"Nice looking beer. Pours auburn with pillowy off-white head. Cherry red lifesaver with vinegar after taste. Mouthfeel is nice. Aroma is melted sour apple slurpee and red vines. Not sure why this beer gets so much love. Get some cuvee de jacobins fellas."

""
""
"Overall 4.25: This beer is amazing. Complex, balanced and utterly enjoyable. If you have never had a Flanders Red, I would recommend you try this one. It reminded me of a Lambic, but perhaps how a Lambic would taste without the delicious fruit additives. What you get is an equally excellent beer, maybe even better in some respects, notably the bouquet. Sour and just all around excellent."

"Bottled, poured in a tulip glass. It pours a brownish red, with a light tan head. The head lingers around for quite some time. It has a strong aroma of fruits, tarts and some wine characteristics. It has a strong taste of fruits such as cherry and some melon. It is very palatable. It is an amazing beer overall!!"
"Overall- Good to really good. Doesn't hit you over the head like most of the beers in its style but is still quite enjoyable. A must try as it adds breadth to the style. I would buy again."
""
""
"This beer has a mouthfeel that is intricate and complex and delightfully light. It enlivens the palate and the senses.It drinks so easily and with so much character. The taste and the mouthfeel are intertwined and cannot be separated. The textures and the delightful and playful complexity brings forward fruit in both it's extremes. Sweet and tart. Lush, headdy, intoxicating."

"Wow, really had what I look for in a sour. Dark fruit tartness and strong sour acidity. After the first few sips I could really get all the tropical fruit tang although every few sips I do catch a whiff of a solvent like alcohol flavor especially on the back on my palate. But overall a amazing beer great for satisfying a sour crave."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Well, like I stated above this was my first of this style, so not quite sure what to think of it, I would probably try it again. Im normally a Stout/Porter type, but this is defiantly a interesting style with lots of flavor and mouth zing lol. I probably rated it lower than it should be, but that more to my mouth being in shock !"

"One of the best examples of a very difficult style to perfect. In fact, only the examples from Rodenbach are clearly superior. With all due respect to attempts from the U.S. (I know American Wild Ales do not count, as they are their own, special sub-style), none of them compete with the Flemish originals. Where I live, the price for this beer varies dramatically, so I suggest shopping around for a good price."

"Pours dark red with medium head that disappears quickly with no lacing left on the glass. Smells like tart cherries, beautiful. Bit of vinegar, heavy sour here. Taste is tart cherries., uckering on the palate. Bit of a dry woody oak finish. Crisp mouthfeel with good carbonation. Really enjoyable though a bit pricy."
""
""
"Overall, this one's a little on the fruity/sugary sweet side; I prefer Rodenbach or CuvÃ©e Des Jacobins Rouge. But, it's been about 3 years since I've had this one so I'm glad I decided to give it another go. Clearly a well crafted beer, just not my personal favorite representation of the style."

"For the price, I guess, my expectations were high. As one could tell I thought this was toot candy sweet. I did find it an enjoyable and like I say, every brew has it's place."
""
""
""
"Pours a barely translucent shade of reddish brown, with a soda-like head... Very nice! Fairly high carbonation level. The aroma reminds me of apple cider vinegar, cherries, port wine, a mossy type of earthiness, and rosemary herbs. I love the nice, tart flavor, which contains essences of cranberry, raisin, currants, caramel apples, citrus, funky Belgian yeast, and fresh red grapes. It's nice and light, going down easily. Slightly sticky mouthfeel. It's got a juicy finish, which leaves the drinker wanting more. Overall, this beer is simply exquisite... a fantastic sour that every beer advocate MUST try!"
"O: A perfect well made sour great for an introduction to sour ales as well a great easy access sour for that hot day."
""
""
"I've been meaning to try this for years. This was a small bottle, probably split up from a Duchesse gift pack (insert sound effect here). But now I suppose I need to get some of these to age, as this greatly exceeded my expectations. I have had a handful of harder to get, more expensive Flanders Reds. And this is really among the best I have ever had. Seriously."

"It's expensive, but worth it. Give it a shot!"

"My absolute favorite sour.  I explain it to guests in layman's terms.  It's like red wine, cider, and beer got together and created a new beer.  It changes as you drink it too.  Delicious!"

"Duchesse De Bourgogne pours a very dark reddish color with very little head. There is a wine like aroma, with sour fruit notes. The taste is much the same sour grape flavors, sweeter, similar to a wine. Full flavors and nice body, still a nice beer to sip. Overall a very nice sour ale."
"Poured from a longneck bottle into a chalice. Dark, deep mahogany colored, with medium head formation. The aroma can be smelled right away (no need to sniff the glass). A complex blend of acidic notes that brings out shoyu, balsamic vinegar and grapes. The taste is incredibly different, and at first I did not like it. It is the kind of beer that grows with each sip. After you get used to it, the flavor gets really interesting and very complex. It is kind of in between a beer and a red wine, with that vinegar thing always in the background. Amazing, classy drink!"
""
""
""
"overall: Haven't had too many sours, to me this tastes more like champagne than a beer, but I really enjoyed this. I mean really enjoyed this, even thought it's insanely expensive I will be purchasing this many times again, and curious to try other flemish sours. I've yet to have a less than mediocre beer from Belgium, any style, they know what they're doing."
"This is a full bodied slightly complex beer that is easily drinkable. The statements are correct that this indeed is a nice Flanders Red Intro."
""
""
"Medium bodied, a touch heavier than you may expect for a sour ale, with heavier carbonation as well, and a slick, almost oily mouth feel. Duchesse de Bourgogne is a decent way to soothe your apprehensive friends into accepting the world of sour beers. For people who are already deep into that territory, this beer won't be too exciting for you, so hopefully you can see it for what it is: a mild mannered bridge into a whole different type of beer."

"Just starting to get into/try sour beers and from I understand this is a legend. Pours a dark, dark ruby red. Nice tan head that sticks around for awhile. Smell dark fruit, banana, not really picking up anything sour on the nose but smells amazing. OOOHHH there's the sour lol it's all over the taste and mouthfeel. Tart, sour cherry some of the funky taste I recognize from beers with brett but not nearly as pronounced. This is very nicely balanced. Won't be an every day beer for me because of the price point but I'll be back for more."
"Not what I was expecting when I bought it, but didn't look into it before buying. It is very good, but not a style I'm a big fan of."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Filling, relaxing, fascinating, jubilant...you know when I start using adjectives that personify a beer, that I absolutely love it. Could be my new favorite. Don't tell my husband, but I might be in love."

"Balsamic vinegar, cherry, fairly sweet and tart, slightly soy sauce. Finish of tartness and rich fruit lasts longer than expected, and a musty taste is eventually left behind. Very refreshing and easy to drink. Quite nice if you like vinegar, fairly complex."
""
""
"750 ml bottle. Pours brown with white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of vinegar, caramel, brown sugar, plums and alcohol. Body is full and tangy. Taste is of barnyard yeast, cherries, plums, caramel, vinegar and brown sugar. Finish is long, sweet and sour. Amazingly delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If anything, this is something of a middle ground between Lindeman's sugar bombs and a proper sour ale. The sugary sweetness is quite prevalent, yet it doesn't overpower the tart qualities. I can see this being very approachable to sour ale beginners."
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol wasn't that strong in this either and even though I only bought one bottle, I could have downed quite a few in a sitting. Very beers are this smooth and accessible while not being overly strong, tart, or sour, but this straddled the edge of those quite well. I couldn't taste the balsamic vinegar here and there wasn't any spice either so if you're new to this, get it and give a go - I can't imagine anyone not liking this beer!"
""
"It's hard to relate the taste to a beer. So much port flavor, sherry sweetness and just the right amount of tart this is like drinking a fermented grape based liquor, with low alcohol. Very smooth, lots of crisp carbonation to help it down, this is very different from expectation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Probably a good beginners sour ... drinks like a tart cherry juice with just a bit of that funky sourness. Nice underlying sweetness."
"I've had this several times before and I'm not really sure how I've never sat down and reviewed it, a classic brew that I doubt will ever go out of style"
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer that makes me feel like i should be dressing up and pairing it with a cigar; it's easily the tastiest sour i've had to date and a new favorite. I'd score it even higher if it didn't smell so odd."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: A truly different sort of Flanders Red primary driven by its Brett yeast character and subsequent musty, barnyard flavors. Berry fruitiness plays in the background as well as malt sweetness. Hops round out but are not noticed in flavor or aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- better than i had expected. Crisp and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amberish-brown with a nice big beige head. Aroma is smoothly sweet and tart; some brown sugar, ssome fruits such as dark cherries, plum, raisins, some vinegar. Flavor was pretty much the same. A lighter mouthfeel to this, worked well for the style. Overall, a wonderful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really a classic in the realm of Flanders reds, and perhaps sour beers in general. This was the very first sour I had years ago in my initial craft findings, and I remember not minding the astringency as the fruitiness and bready, yeasty texture were both so predominant in the flavor overall. It's not as complex as other beers in its realm, but it terms of widespread availability and accessibility, it's definitely made its mark. This is a great one to use to introduce people to soured beers - tart, fruity, slightly nutty, and very refreshing."

""
""

""

"I am just starting to experiment with sours, so my frame of reference for this style is not as big as with other styles. The beer has a dark, brick-red color with a wispy head. Nose was vinegary although not unpleasant. Taste not as sour as the nose would make you think it would be and it finished with cherries and a little caramel sweetness."

This is the only bottle from them on our listâ€¦ I wonder what other beers they produce. Has anyone tried anything else from them? Oh well, this one is good enough for me to buy over and over again!!! Cheers."

""
"Beautiful chestnut colored body with a small, creamy pillow of a head that quickly reduces to a plush, bubbly ring. Oaky balsamic sharpness first hits the nose along with sour cherry, berries, caramel, and dusty red wine. Big, sour, well-rounded flavors like sweet, acidic fruit, tart cherry, wood, light tannins. Dry and puckering. This takes me back. Less vinegary than I remember. Excellent..."
""
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer. It's more candy than beer. It's not something you'd drink fast, as the flavors are so complex you want to savor every sip. It is honestly the most ""different"" beer I've ever tasted. I really enjoyed this one."
""
"Overall: This is absolutely fantastic. I am just getting into the ""sours"" realm, and this is just delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good stuff; a unique and fascinating flavour blend that no other style can match (though I suppose lambics come close). Simultaneously sweet and sour, the aroma and flavour exhibit fruity notes most reminiscent of balsamic vinegar. It looks nice, and the body is pretty good. While I don't mind Flemish reds, I do find them rather cloying - this is not a brew I would have twice in a row. Having said that, it is a exemplary take on the style. One to add to your must-try list."
"O - Great sour."
""
""
""
""
"O: Yum. Such a rich delicious sweet beer. Excellent. Think I liked roedenbach better though; doesn't feel like there were as deep of a flavor."

"Poured into a tulip. Deep, dark plum color with a beige head. The aroma is unique, sour fruit but a bit medicinal. Fruity, sweet and tart, cherries, ripe grapes, with a mild sour sting on the end. Medium carbonation and overall mouthfeel, An excellent and well blended sour ale that doesn't overpower."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 5/2014. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy cream colored with with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of green apple, cherry, raspberry, pear, apple skin, floral, hay, grass, oak, light vinegar, light red wine, funk, and grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity notes; with moderate malt sweetness and good strength. Taste of lightly tart cherry, raspberry, apple, pear, hay, grass, pepper, light vinegar, oak, light red wine, light funk, and grassy earthiness. Slight fruity and earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark and light fruits, hay, grass, floral, light vinegar, light red wine, oak, and grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity and spicy notes; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Flanders red ale. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"The taste....ah, really a thing of beauty. In fact, if I were to introduce somebody to sours, this is likely what I'd give them. That is not necessarily because it's a beginner beer persay, but because it has such a wonderful balance to it that some other sours really just don't have. While some sours are like drinking straight vinegar, this has more complexity and balance to it, which makes it an incredibly easy drink. I get a nice sweet fruitiness, perhaps of cherries predominately and maybe a hint of cranberry in there, upfront....along with a lactic tartness that I'd describe as perhaps half as sour as many of the new sours I've had that I think are going out of their way to be as sour as possible. Again, easy going. Never makes me grimace, always whets my palate for the next drink. That mix between the sweet berries/cherries and the lactic tartness is so well done, I really can't say enough."
""
""

"Nice, just not so interesting."

"Extreme well balanced beer, combining drinkability with flavor. Not too sour, perfect level (unless you dig a lot sour beers). Excellent. I am now curious to try it even more aged. I have the impression will continue to evolve."

""

"O: I've never had this one tap before. It's quite tasty, and an easy drink...but it doesn't blow me away - doesn't rise to the complexity of other sours. Still, I will enjoy more in the future."
""
""
""
"O - too sweet and sour to have more than maybe 2 of these. But the one is very good. I would certainly drink it. But for $8 - I will not order this again. Unless...Its for a desert beer. This would be perfect. But, this one was certainly a pleasure to have."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A very interesting full flavor beer. Full of contrasts, but balanced and not overpowering despite being sour. Complimented a full-flavor dinner (Chicken + 40 cloves) very nicely and was good to savor after the meal. A very nice beer overall but for me a one and done. It's good, but one glass is enough. Another bottle or another glass would be too much - one per evening is enough. I could easily have this again though, just not in one sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
"An absolutely incredible beer. The balance of fruit, floral and sour is incredible. Usually a beer this sweet would be way out of my zone, but the balance of the sour accentuates the fruit and floral notes. Love it, one of my favorite beers. Anyone who has not ventured into the land of sours should make this one of their first."
""

""
"O: Love this beer. Certainly up there in my favourites. The best of the sour reds Iâ€™ve had. Its balanced for a sour and complex. Keeps me wanting more."
"O - Although not as bold as some sours, its flavors are well balanced and satisfying. This beer is pretty unique in its flavor profiles, and its quality is undeniable. Always a joy."
""
"A very excellent beer. Hard to find faults here, and its really tasty. As far as the take on the style, it isnt as in your face sour as others, and seems to have a more balanced approach and flavour, with a slight roast malt sweetness on the palate that brings it all together really well. A great beer with a ton of flavour worth trying."
""
"I am not the most eloquent or well versed on such beers; this is just mighty tasty."
""
""
"Flanders!"
""
"O: one of my favorite beers - ridiculously delicious and satisfying - while I have lots of love for Rodenbach Grand Cru and the Cuvee de Jacobins Rouge (and this would compare closer to the Cuvee), it offers me what the other do not...a much more lip-smacking, berry-nectary intensity (but not overbearing sugary sweetness) - this wouldn't be something I would drink all the time...I revel in the excitement and anticipation, though, each time we cross paths..."
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely a good beer, but I've had other Flanders ales that were better and, most importantly, more sour. The sourness is what I love about the style and Duchesse De Bourgogne doesn't deliver quite as well as others. Even the bext most prevalant Flanders, Rodenbach's Grand Cru, does. So you're not going too far out of your way to get that extra goodness. I feel like I'm underscoring a bit, but for the price, I'm going to make sure I reach for Rodenback over this every time."

"O-Disclosure: Years ago, this was one of the first sour beers I ever had, so I'm sure there is some nostalgia coming in here. Anyway, I really enjoy the Duchesse. In particular, I could smell this beer all day long. The taste is a little sweet and the feel was merely good (not great), so perhaps this beer lacks the balance and complexity of the best sour red ales (Rodenbach Grand Cru, for example), but the Duchesse is still a great example of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a win! I will definitely add this beer to my rotation of Belgians as it deserves no less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very interesting beer. And a good one at that but very different from you average beer. This is much more vinious and tart that nearly all beer styles out there."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the complexity of flavor, and the unique balance of sweetness to even out the classic puckering tartness. From the moment of the pour we knew things would go well with this one. The coloring glowed, and the head stood tall and strong. The aroma gave us a lighter hint of the excellent mash of flavors within which, alone, would have you coming back for more. The feel only builds this desire, as there is nice frothy slurp to each sip. This is an outstanding beer."

"Overall- This is a beautiful beer. All around very well balanced. I'll be buying this again."
"O: Slightly above average here as this beer needs some time to become more rounded."
""
""
""
"Overall it through me a curve ball, but in a good way. I've never had a beer like it. Itwas just like red wine. I want to try this with steak or lamb chops sometime in the future! An A rated beer for sure!"
""
""
""
"A bit all over the board, but recommended. A nice well distributed Sour. Relaxing and unique for a Friday after a busy week."
"Overall, a tasty but not over the top complex brew. It would make a good introduction into the expansive world of wild Belgian beers."
"A good Flanders Red, but I've definitely had better. I did find it pleasant, however."

"Oh the dutchess... Shall I compare the to a summer's day? Seriously though, this beer is phenomenal. For one expecting a good sour ale this beer cannot be beat, though potentially tied. I got exactly what I expected and would not wish for this beer to change at all. I hope to be able to share this beer with my children, when they are old enough of course. (At least not until they hit double digits.) Thanks to all those Flemish folks for this amazing contribution to the world beer community."

"The sour beers are winning me over. Duchesse is one of my favorites now."

"Poured into Goose Island silver goose glass. Appearance is a deep brownish red with a thin layer of white head. A moderate amount of clarity and minimal lacing. Nose is oaky with a bit of funk. Lactic acid comes through with cherries and vanilla. The taste starts off with a touch of fruity sweetness. This is quickly countered with a healthy dose of vinegar followed by funk. This all gives way quickly back to a candied fruit quality. Notes of oak finish this off. Mouthfeel is light with light carbonation. Overall, this sour isn't as sour as I'd hope, but it does have decent balance."
""
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, citrus, hint of alcohol, hint of grass, and tartness/sourness. Fits the style of a Flanders Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of tart cherry, slight wheat, slight sweet malt, sugar, and slight hop. Overall, great appearance, good aroma, and good blend."
"O: Never had a beer like this â€“ Iâ€™m blown away. Though staggering on the first sip (and not necessarily in a good way), Duchesse De Bourgogne has confirmed something to me that I seem to have experienced a few times already: beer is art. Cheers!"

"Overall: bottle or draft, you can't go wrong. Such a cornerstone of a beer for this style."
""
""
""
"The vinegar smell actually fit well and thankfully didn't transfer into the taste. Top shelf here. An excellent all-around drink."
" O: a different outcome than expected of this beer. something i could sit and have with a home cooked meal for sure but not something to have more than one bottle of i feel. loving the woody characters arising and as always the dark fruits. recommend to try"
""
""
""
"O: A very nice beer. Great fruit notes but still has some malty and hoppy notes. I would recommend it."
"Well made beer, and nicely complex without being a flavour bomb."

"Duchesse de Bourgogne pours a deep chestnut brown, with a few scant ruby highlights apparent when the beer is backlit. There's a smattering of khaki colored foam atop the beer. Not enough for any real lacing or head retention though. The nose is very nice, with aromas of sweet cherry acidic tartness, and a bit of woody oak all intermingling and taking turns standing out. The flavor profile manages to be even more complex. Cherries and a definite vinous sour note are what immediately make an impression. The farther I get down the glass, the more some of background notes begin to come through. In addition to the oak, some biscuit and light caramel maltiness add another layer to the beer. The mouthfeel isn't quite to the same level as the aroma and flavor. Tje.body is alright, but the carbonation dies off at the front of the palate, leaving the rest of the sip to coat my palate a little too much. Still, Duchesse is a great beer, and I'm almost embarrassed it took me this long to try it."

"O - Super refreshing and delicious. Quite enjoyable and a solid brew for the style."

"Overall an enjoyable and unique beer which could do with less sweetness and Jack Daniel's in its profile."

""

"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red amber, moderate long lasting head and lacing. Fruit and sour aroma. Nice dark fruits with a rush of cherry, sour and sweetness in a well blended flavor. Sour and fruit finish. Wow. Sours aren't my favorite style, but this is excellent and beautifully made. I will buy again."

"O- love it. nothing about this beer tastes forced or artificial. its cohesive while being incredibly dynamic. one of the best flemish style beers ive had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable. Would have been a much better beer without that buttery slickness, but worth buying a few more before they disappear to see how it evolves."
""
"Pours a deep medium brown, with a dense beige head that leaves tremendous lacing. The aroma is pleasant but muted, with a faint, musty/herbal hop character that is reminiscent of old, wet grass (in a good way), which is contrasted by a light, fruity combination of berries and citrus. The flavor is more vibrant, with a bright and fruity combination of mixed berries and sour cherries that is not overly sweet, especially when cut by a kind of aged vinegar character. The fine, soft carbonation elevates rather than distracts from the sweet/tart flavor. Overall, the sweet and only gently sour profile of this beer makes it quite drinkable but still flavorful."
"O - Very refreshing drink featuring a good complexity and a perfect balance. Definitely a must try!"
""
""
""
"O - The metallic flavor ruined it for me to the point where I couldn't finish it. I was really disappointed with this one. I had high hopes and it fell flat. I will try it again, but this one just did not hold up to its reputation."
"Head is just right, aroma is sweet with a hint of sour cherry. Color is a nice crimson to amber. Mouthfeel is light and fragrant with a tart, crisp flavor. Finishes smooth and the lightly sour aftertaste remains right on the tongue beckoning for more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky crimson brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour and tart with some malt, sour fruit, red wine vinegar, and woody aromas. Taste is much the same with a woody and slightly acidic flavor on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but it's definitely not as sour as I remember it being from the bottle."

"I enjoyed this beer on draft at the Muddy Pig in St. Paul, MN. The waiter delivered the stemmed glass of mahogany colored elixir. The aroma immediately made itself known. The fruity, woody, funky mixture elicited pleasant memories of the good side of Worchestire sauce without losing its beer distinctness. The flavor expands on the palate into a fruity, cherry-like, sour, oak-laden profile filled with complexity. The waves keep coming, all complementing the central them of sourness. This is deep wonderful beer."

"cannot believe i only have the one bottle. makes me sad. ive always been intrigued by this style and feel i have now found its standard. and it is good!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow, very solid flanders red. It is nice that the sour is not lip puckering but instead smooth."
"Overall: I'm really impressed with this beer. The nose is quite tart but the taste is well balanced. Very good amount of fruit. I really enjoyed this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Still something i'd love to have anytime. But for 6$ a bottle? I dunno. I'm hoping to enjoy the Lost Abbey's Red Poppy a little more at 15$ a bottle."
""
""
"As for the taste, woah baby! This lady has class. There's a slight candy-sweetness up front that is balanced by a refreshing sour apple acidity. The mouthfeel is medium-firm and silky smooth. The carbonation seems just right. I'm no expert of Flanders Red Ales, but this one is a freaking work of art. It's not a mouth-puckeringly acidic as Rodenbach Grand Cru. The pleasant sweetness that accompanies the flavor makes this much, much more drinkable. I think I might actually prefer it."
""
""
""
""
"Fairly full body and creamy given how light it tastes."
""
""
""
"The taste is the perfect balance between sweet & sour with incredible drinkability. The aftertaste is slightly bitter and acidic. This beer is right on par with a good flanders red and is less sweet than a monk's cafe and less fruity than a rodenbach. Long into the aftertaste a malt graininess settles in, which is also an unexpected feature of this beer. Overall, this beer will make a wine lover extol its complexity and a non-beer drinker relish in its drinkability."
"Definitely good, to drink in great quantity."
""
""
""
"Highly recommended! And an excellent introduction to the style."
"A-"
"O: This beer takes me back to my youth when I would eat a roll of Shocktarts or a bag of Sour Patch Kids. The only down-side which might be a plus budget-wise is I can't have more than 1 of these in a sitting. Will buy a 4-pack of this next time instead of a single bottle. Also, really like to see a long best-by date printed on the bottle."
""
""
"A very tasty beer and I'd imagine a good example of the style. Price is a little much but it could be nice treat every once in a while."
"O- this beer did not disappoint. Only gave it 4's because it lacked some funkiness but still has that slight vinegaress taste. Will definitely get this again."
""
""
"O- Wow, I'm fairly new to the style but I can tell i'm a big fan of flanders reds. Nothing like a nice complex beer to finish the day."
""
""
"DOA"
""
"I haven't fully delved in to the world of sours, but I have had this one numerous times. An absolutely delicious beer that is totally"
""
""
"O-First Flanders Red. I like it a lot."
""
""
"Pours a ruby red-brown with about one finger of head. Smells like tart cherries. Tastes like balsamic vinegar with cherries but, in a good way. It's crisp with a medium body mouth feel. The finish is tart and bitter that makes my mouth pucker. I will definitely buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Loved it. Assertive, smooth and sour mash-up. Looking forward to trying more brown ales."
""
"O- At first the finish didn't work for me. but the more I drank it the more accustomed I got to it. By the time I reached the end it was a pretty pleasant Flanders."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours reddish copper with a fluffy tan head that leaves behind plenty of lacing. The aroma is of vinegar and sour fruit (perhaps cherry or apple). It's funky. The flavor is tart up front with plenty of carbonation. I can taste some apple flavor. The sour flavor isn't overwhelming and plays well with the carbonation. The flavors are definitely interesting, but in a good way. It's medium bodied with proper carbonation. The finish is dry. This is a sipper due to the tartness, but it's an easy sipper. Overall, I'd rate this an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, I've had this beer many times, I plan on having it again. It's currently my favorite sour."
""
"Despite the steak sauce sensation I was able to enjoy this beer. But the off putting taste keeps it well short of being great."
""
"O - This beer was my first ever sour, and while it was certainly an eye-opening experience, I still enjoyed getting to try a new beer within an unfamilar style. Even with the knowledge of what I was about to drink, I was still startled by the amount of sour/vinegar taste in this beer. That said, with each sip, my mouth started to adjust to the tartness, and the beer surprisingly became pretty addicitve. I don't think I could drink a beer like this too often, but am now looking forward to giving a few more sours a try in the future."
""
"Incredible beer, and highly recommended for Belgian lovers. One of my all-time favorites. A beer I pay full-price for and know I'm getting a treat every time. Great fresh, great with a few years on it. An amazing Flanders Red. 5.0"
"As sour beers aren't really my cup, this one surprised me in being more than quite enjoyable. It is light, fruity and pleasant. It is rather inoffensive and likely a good start for introducing people to beers with a more sour side to them."
"Overall. Great stuff. Maybe just a little sweet, but tastes gooood."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with excessive carbonation, this beer fizzes like Alka Seltzer in Dr. Pepper. The body is full enough to allow the flavors to not only register on the taste buds but to stick around for a good bit as well. However, the body never becomes sticky or coating, thanks to the effervescent carbonation. Despite all the fizzing, the carbonation really doesn't detract from the experience much and really helps to keep this beer really drinkable."
"This beer pours a beautiful, bold ruby red with no head but long lasting lace. It's aroma is of dark fruit, musty hay, and yeast. The flavor is mainly sour cherries with a yeasty, bread-like note. The mouthfeel is full with a warming finish. Duchesse De Bourgogne is an okay beer, very filling but a good representation of the style. Slightly recommended."

"O- i do not care for this beer too much. im a big fan of other flanders but this one does not do it for me. Dont think that i will be having this again."

"Pours a dark caramel brown with a slight off-white head. Stays around, but no lacing. Cherries, Raspberries and balsamic vinegar on the nose. Flavor begins with a sour kick of cherries, grape juice, red wine and mellowed vinegar. Not too tart or puckering. Hints of sweet raspberries, lemon juice and sour apples near the finish. Just a touch of wood as well. Nice balance, simple mix of flavors that work very well together."
"Mouthfeel is dry and champagne like. It literally disappears on the tongue, with rich malt and complex fruit and spice on the palate."
""
""
""
""
"The sweet and sour of beers. The Duchesse has a nice balance, but itâ€™s not the tops of the style. A good, entry-level Flanders red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one poured with a quick disappearing head and a brownish-red hue. Smelled of candied cherries and booze. Some scents of sweet red wine comes through as well. Taste is a bit pungent but super sweet. Cherries and sugar, with grapes and red wine. A bit too sweet IMO. Mouth feel is smooth and a bit dry. Liked this but could have been a little more tart/sour to make it awesome."
"O- Yes, it's quite tart and does very little to quench my thirst but, after your palate gets acquainted with those tastes, it's very well-balanced. I don't usually get into sours, but I wouldn't mind having this every once in a while. Hat's off to the Duchesse."
""
""
""
"Overall, I am rating this beer high because, in it's class, I haven't had too many that would touch it. That said, you definitely should know what you are getting into and be in the mood for a tart, fruity treat that you can only find with DDB."
""
"Overall, a terrific beer. Pretty remarkable the range of flavours going on here and well they all work together. Very tasty and also a great beer to introduce others to sour beers."
""
""

"Two finger rapidly dissipating head with a little lace on a clear near perfectly amber body. Near perfect sour cherry aroma with candy notes. Flavor is initially sour then sweet in the finish with a predominantly dark fruit backbone. This beer is excellent and very very drinkable. Medium body and moderate carbonation. I will be having this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750ml bottle. Best by mar. 2013 poured a redish murky brown excess proteins contributed to a chill haze. Smell of abundant fruit such as apple pear currant and soft bready yeast. Tastaste is overwhelmingly cider like very unlike a lambic or other sour beers this is more of a sweet and kinda sour expierence. Mouthfeel was light yet a bit syrupy and carbonation was minimal and head was not around for more than 10 seconds. Overall it was a good example of the style but not my cup of beer and would probabaly not revisit. I will say though this is a grow on you type of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Anytime I see this beer, i get it. Ive paid too much for it, but thats the cost of mixing two batches together and aging and importing and the rarity, and on and on and on. Great Stuff."
"Overall, a near perfect flanders. I can't give it a perfect 5 because that belongs to Consecration."
"Only problem I can find with this burgundy beauty is so noble, dignified and vinous it might destroy the wine industry if it caught on."

"I try not throw out a high score without justification, but I don't know how this beer can be improved for what it is. I find the look, lightness, and taste spot on. Not a beer I would drink all night, but used in place of a dessert wine or a sweet treat, look no further."
"98."

"O Nice beer. I'm newer to sour/wild/etc and this one had nice tastes that complimented each other nicely."

"Overall: My first real dive into a beer that is tart and sour, and while it certainly isn't unpleasant, it's not something I'd actively seek out again. However, it has not turned me off from trying different sours, as it isn't disgusting by any means."
""
"My first beer of this style. Pours a beautifuly dark red with a nice sized head. Recedes quickly to leave some good lacing on the sides and surface. Smell is tart with some mild fruit notes. Kind of like a fruit lambic. Taste is tart to begin. Spicy throughout. Rich earthy yeastiness in the finish. Red wine. There is a great background sweetness that makes this very nicely balanced. Really tasty. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Very easily drinkable. Overall I really like this- much more than I thought I would actually. Will have to seek out some more examples of this style."

"A decent beer for the style, ubiquitous, but I prefer the Rodenbachs."

"Love. Love. Love this beer. I am usually not a fan of sweeter styles, but the balance of sweet and sour make this beer fantastic. My only problem with it, is its metallic aroma, with a hint of metallic in the finish. Very pleasant effervescent mouthfeel.

"Just delicious, and probably the best example of how my taste has changed over time. At one time I found this beer barely drinkable, as it was just too sour for me. Now I think the level of sour in this beer is just right, and sometimes think it borders on being too sweet. Regardless, this is an outstanding beer, with an amazing amount of flavor given the 6% abv. This is the beer I think of when I think of a flanders red ale."

"Radiating a deep brown-amber hue, the ale was served in flute glass with an inch head. A fruity-sour aroma tickled the nose without much effort. The aroma was quite potent. As with most good sour ales, the taste was potent. A sour fruitness was the immediate impression; this included hints of tart cranberry and raspberry. The sensations continued into the tart and fruity aftertaste. The carbonation was a little more aggressive than I would have expected, but this did not subtract from the experience. Duchesse is a delicious and refreshing experience."
"A very invigorating and well balanced Flemish red ale. This was beer 1000 here at beeradvocate."
"I really enjoyed this beer but found that with the tartness, one was enough."
"Quite the beer. Belgium keeps impressing me."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is a fun beer to sip on. If you have friends that are into red semi sweet or dry wines, they might really enjoy this. Glad that I got to try it."
"One damn good bier."
"O - This is an excellent beer. I've had it many times but never really tried to break down the flavors and aromas before. It is unbelievable how much flavor they pack into a 6.2% ABV beer. World-class!"
"Overall, excellent. One of the best Belgians I have had."
"Overall, it's a solid drink with exceptional drinkability. Incredibly smooth as well. I'd definitely pick it up at least once. Considering it's from Belgium, the prices isn't too high either."
"CONCLUSION: This is my first Flanders Red Ale but will definitely not be my last. Hopefully others can stand up to this one. Incredible stuff."
"O: I think this beer surprised me at every step. Great balance in this little bottle."
"Pours a cloudy brownish-red. A thick, sticky, deep-tan head. Smell is tart, yet with some malt heaviness. Taste is puckering, but more sweet than sour. Lots of cidery apple and tart cherries. Sourdough malts. Feel is very nice, with some body, yet sparkling and effervescent. A tasty, complex brew."
"O - A tasty ale, and the first of the style I have tried. Unique would be an understatement. This is definitely worth a try."
"D-Overall i was not expecting this brew to taste this good. It had just the right amount of sour and sweet fruit flavors and a nice bitter funk to it. I love this brew and will get it again. I see why this is 5$ a bottle. Alittle steep but for a brew this good ill pay it. Def. pick this up if u can or trade for it!"
"O: A Flanders Red is always an interesting beer. This is no exception."
"O â€“ Terrific. I am enthusiastic about this one's uniqueness. I like the surprise of the sweetness after the funky aroma. I like watching the bubbles (which are still going!). I like that this beer has strong opinions about itself, and is not afraid to share them."
"Overall - This Flanders Red ale is an interesting intersection of a sour ale and barleywine traits. I liken it to a barleywine ""light"" that has similar complexitiy of flavors without the heaviness or maltiness of a barleywine. One can definitely appreciate why this is regarded as the ""Burgundy of Belgium""."
"O: This is a great beer and a great place to start with sours. The taste amazed me. So much going on but nothing became muddled."
"O - A nice beer for a sour one. I would even say its worth buying."
"Pours a brown/red color w/ a nice one finger cocoa head. Amazing carbonation and lacing. Lacing sticks around forever, and would probably be on my glass tomorrow if I didn't wash it. Beautiful red highlights when held up to the light, although you can't see through it at all. Nose is cherry, yeast, sourness, funk, and some vinegar. Very nice balance on the nose- and nothing's overwhelming. Taste is amazingly smooth for what I was expecting. There is some sourness, cherry, funk, but there's also a malt smoothness to it that offsets the others a little bit. Really nice feel as well. Overall, this is a great beer. It's a good intro beer for sours, and this style as well. I would definitely have this again. Cheers."
"Light amber with significant garnet highlights, goodly number of carbonation streams rising from center bottom of glass. Off white head, a good fingers worth, relatively slow dissipation with significant lacing. Nose is pretty sweet for the style, cherry and grape, little hops if any in the aroma, the yeast is fairly noticeable and dries out the fruitiness. Taste once again is pretty sweet, minimal tartness, not a lot of sourness, balanced well by sweetness, no hops. Mouthfeel is medium, ok effervescence, some residual stickiness. Really tasty, perhaps a better entry Flanders than some of the more tart or sour entries. In any case, very tasty."
"not your typical sour, overly infused with sour cherry and rotten harvest fermentation. surprisingly mellow with its dark pour. piquant and satisfying. pairs well with smoked cheeses amd pickled beets. quick in the mouth and somehow ancient. 4-pack night is worthy. cheers!"
"O- I have been on a sour kick as of recent, and the complexity of this one really blew me away. There is so much going on, but is so well constructed that you get to enjoy every piece individually and as a whole with each sip. Man did this go great with dinner!"
"O: Really enjoyable sour. Not as sour as many, but this is a good place to start for those interested in sour beers."
"Drink: Exquisite beer or fancy soda? Indeed, this is a beer, and quite an impressive one, but there isn't nearly enough tart to balance the sweetness for me. Very drinkable, almost dangerously so."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately low. I'm disappointed that after the relatively strong first impressions, this beer just falls off quick for me. Way too much vinegar, not enough tartness, and the vegetal notes in the finish are brutal. I had this at a bar tasting about a year ago, and it was my first sour. I thought it was pretty decent then, but it was just a small sample, and I guess my palate has developed a taste for different types of sours since then..."
"O: a typical B+ if you ask me. Nice, but there are better beers in this style."
"D = high drinkability, very refreshing, overall a very nice beer. Will have this one again."
"O: Great beer. Can't wait to see how the pie turns out. Flavorful, tart, delicious."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is a near perfect introduction to the world of sour beers. I would highly recommend this one. Just make sure you drink it fairly fresh. Once it reaches or passes the best before date, it's a vinegar bomb."
"A great introductory beer for the style, especially for someone who may prefer sweeter beers, but it's a bit too sweet for my personal likings."
"Overall this beer is uniqueâ€¦ prob wonâ€™t pick it up again but glad I tried it."
"The off white head flutters away with an afterthought of thin and scattered lace. Dark brown in color with dark red hues at the edges. Powerful sweet and sour fruit aroma; including prunes, ripe grapes, figs and raisins, along with burnt sugar and freshly baked brown bread and phenols. Vinous, grainy and tart to the tongue with a prolific amount of sour grapes and figs. A little honey and vinegar are also noticed. Medium mouth-feel with a touch of alcohol heat that is quickly forgotten. Not completely my thing, but that doesn't mean it's not a good beer."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Throughout this beer I found initially that it was mostly curiosity that motivated taking another sip, but as I adjusted myself to the flavors I was experiencing and as the beer warmed some I began to enjoy it more. Indeed, by the end of the beer I was ready to open another given the complex interplay of flavors. As I was ready to decide there was too much sweetness the sour would come in to play and as I was ready to decide there was too much vinegar sourness the sweetness would assert itself. Overall Iâ€™d say this is a beer that is well worth trying. Iâ€™m guessing that it is not for everyone, but Iâ€™d recommend that everyone give it a try but pay close attention to serving temperature and have 2-3 before reviewing or deciding they liked or disliked it."
"The balsamic vinegar flavor overwhelms any other aspect of this brew. Smells like wine, fairly carbonated, very sour and unpleasantly vinegar-y. A total pass for me though my female companion liked it. If you're more into wine than the typical Belgian beer then maybe you'll like it more. I'd rathe have a Chimay or Rochefort."
"tastes delicious. sour, sweet, fruit, wine, slight alcohol. interesting balance and well done. enjoyed this a ton! definitely recommend trying one out."
"Overall: A very unique, harmonious and elegant beer that has no evident flaws. I think it just surpassed Orval as my favourite go to beer."
"This beer poured a dark ruby color with a trace of off white fizzy head that retain and laces pretty well. The aroma has notes of sour cherries, dark fruit and some vinegar. The taste starts with the sour cherries and then has a strong note of vinegar... Not very good. The mouthfeel is on par for what a sour ale should be like, but I don't know if I got a bad bottle or what, but this was way too vinegary for me."
"Overall: One of my favorites. This beer is exceptional. Balanced and complex at the same time."
"One of the best Flemish Reds I've tried. I imagine this could be a gateway beer for wine lovers and girlfriends."
"Overall, awesome beer, nice switch from the fruity, tart sours"
"D: This was more like apple cider vinegar than beer, but it was very clean and enjoyable. The aftertaste was mellow, so it was relatively easy to drink. It could probably improve with age, but it's very enjoyable fresh."
"My first sour, enjoyed before dinner with my wife and our friends. Poured into a tulip glass with a murky reddish-brown color. Lighting at Falls Taproom isn't great though. Head was white and substantial. Smells a bit musty, malty sweetness also, and a hint of vinegar. Overall light aroma, nothing overpowering. Flavor was initially sweet and sour, mostly sour and sort of a balsamic quality. This flavor, while pleasant, departed quickly and the aftertaste was musty. Sort of like a wet dog smell that lingers on the palate. I've experienced this in the past (most notably with Arrogant Bastard) and my guess is that certain hops disagree with me. Unfortunately the aftertaste is what lingered. Mouthfeel was a little sticky, but light. Overall impression was disappointing. I was looking forward to a mouth-puckering vinegar experience (I loves me some deli pickles) but the aftertaste overwhelmed the initial sour flavors. This was my first ""sour"" so I'll probably try it again. Geez though they're always so damn expensive!"
"This is a good beer to have around for a celebration."
"O: it is thanks to this beer that I like sours, and it is still probably the one I buy most often."
"Mouthfeel - didn't really register as I didn't want in my mouth after my tongue had gotten hold of it."
"O: Enjoyable but subtle. This beer has great flavors but I wish they were a little more potent. Very easy drinking."
"I'd drink it again, probably"
"D - Too much for me. I have several friends who love this stuff and recommended it several times, but I can't get on the same page. Interesting brew, but not one for me."
"D: To me, this has such low drinkability because I want to enjoy it. That said, it's extremely drinkable."
"Pours a dark brown reddish color which when held up to light gives off a deep dark ruby red color. The beer is clear with strong visible carbonation and a slim head. Nice lacing is left of the glass. The aroma is big and hits you hard a nice vinegar smell rounded out by dark fruits sour cherries and plums. The taste is almost exactly like a champagne and white wine mix. The is a sour cherry tatse but also a green sour apple and white grape taste with a hint of oak at the back end. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean again this beer has the feel of champagne in your mouth. Overall this is a great beer nice big aroma and great taste."
"O - My favorite Flanders Red thus far. Reminds me of Rodenbach Grand Cru but even smoother; sourness is nicely sharp but kept in check well by oak aging. Sublime."
"Overall Drinkability - This is my first from this style, so I was careful with the ratings to leave room for the possibility of a better beer in style. After trying a few more, I'll come back and rate this one, but as a beer I'd give it all 5's."
"Overall: The only improvement I could suggest is toning back the cherry a little bit. Otherwise, it's an absolutely superior brew."
"O - One of the best Flemish ales I've had. This is a very good example of the style and it drinks really well on a hot summer day."
"I love this beer. I will seek this out and drink this again =)"
"Sticky in the mouth, really clings to the tongue. Little to no carbonation makes for smooth drinking."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this one, and might actually be my favorite Flanders Red."
"Overall pretty good"
"O: Having this on tap really caught me off guard and made me realize the dangers posed by getting this post international shipping. This is an awesome beer and already well worth getting in a bottle-- getting it on tap is a must if its available to you. Hats off to the Duchesse de Bourgogne."
"O: This really is just a classic. Definitely one of those beers you introduce to a new drinking buddy as an introduction to sour styles. The execution of this flanders is so clean and crisp, that to dislike it is as unholy as disliking your grandmother's apple-pie. Avoid such blasphemies, and take your time with this one. Explore the different flavor experiences to be had with different sized mouthfuls. Notice how she can be as sweet as you want her to be, and as tart as you want her to be. Revisit this one a few times before you come to any conclusions about it, each bottle is a variation on a theme. It's ever so sensitive to temperature and glassware, give her the care she needs. After many dates, hopefully you'll come to see her as the beautiful siren that she is."
"O: This is currently my favorite pick for a sour, beer, AND a beverage. It never lets me down with it's crispy tart holiness and mouth-watering goody goodness. Sometimes I wake up in the night and cry out for a glass of Duchesse, screaming until the dawn. ""Duchesse! Duchesse!"" It must be tasted to be believed."
"O: This went down really smoothly. I've just come off a bit of a wild ale kick, having just had a Supplication the other night. I was expecting something heavier, but was pleasantly surprised. This was a great beer after a long day. Will definitely enjoy the rest of the four-pack."
"Pours dark crimson-brown color with light tan head that dissipates quickly. Slight sour, very fruity aroma. Wonderfully balanced flavor between sweet and sour. Mild sour flavors with slight candied sweetness. Excellent body. Seemed like a bigger beer. Loved it!"
"O - Wish this one hadn't gone lost in the back of my fridge. I think the lesson is that the best before date has a lot of merit and don't age it too long. Sorry to give such a poor review."
"O - I'd been thinking about trying this for some time, but could never pull the trigger. Thank goodness I did, because this is a treat. An exceptionally good sour, and one I will continue to by from now on."
"overall i'm enjoying this. was admittedly a bit apprehensive at the outset but keeping an open mind has paid off. great beer."
"I am not a sour chaser and I really thought I would never find a sour beer that I really liked. Duchesse won me over on the first sip. Its complex flavor is completely masked by the smell. It's like the durian fruit of beer. While I'm sure its still not for everyone I think if your curious you should try a glass."
"O: A great beer. I will definitely be buying this to keep on hand when in the mood for a break from strong stouts."
"Bottle poured into a large tulip glass. Color is a strong reddish brown with around half an inch of head. Smell is sour cider and cherry, very acidic. Taste is a kind of sweet and sour combination, with lots of grapes and maraschino cherry flavors. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel. Very good drinkability."
"This pours a deep brown, there are hints of red but I wouldn't have known its a red ale otherwise. The head is a finger width and light brown, it quickly fades away but leaves a nice lace. This smells a little sour, woody and slightly unusual, hard to describe. Nice mouth feel, it gets very carbonated if I gently move it around on my tongue, I can feel the tartness. The taste is a little tart / sour at first but on the way down it seems to sweeten up quite a bit, this is definitely a unique flavor for beer, but I really like it. It kind of reminds me of shock tart candies I used to love as a child, this my second bottle to try and the aftertaste sweetness is more than I remembered. Overall this is a great beer and very well could be one of my favorites."
"Duchesse may very well be the best sour ale I have ever had and it pours a deep chestnut brown color with notes of tart fruit, notably cherries, and dark malt. Since this ale is aged in oak conditioned casks, Duchesse has a red wine like feeling to it. The array of sweet and sour flavors are perfectly balanced throughout this Flanders red ale, and itâ€™s velvety smooth from start to finish."
"Not familiar, but it seems to repeel the wife and kids, so it is a winner."
"This ale poured out as a fizzy looking deep red color with a light tan colored head on it. The head didn't last very long and neither did the lacing. The color was great on this beer though. The aroma of oak wood and fermented cherries on the nose giving this quite a sour profile. The taste is exactly what the smell told me. The flavors in this beer are big a powerful upfront with tart cherry and fresh oak. The aftertaste settles into a more semi-sweet and very nice yeasty cherry flavor. The mouthfeel is bubbly and kind of thin but didn't bother me. Overall this is probably one of my favorite sours, I'm not really into this style too much but I'll admit I did enjoy this brew."
"O: Excellent and very interesting beer. Often lambics are too sour for me but this style I could get into."
"The texture of Duchesse de Bourgogne is very similar to that of champagne, or prosecco--substantial, but airy thanks to the vigorous carbonation release."
"O - My first intro to the Flanders Red Ale as far as I know. Very solid, really enjoyed this one. It's a sipper, but at the same time I think I could drink a second one. Would like to try more of this style."
"Overall - As stated, I am no sour expert, but this is tasty, if not very complex. Single flavor going through, but a good flavor."
"D: I don't see how anyone could call this undrinkable."
"O- A very nice brew that I enjoyed drinking. This is a nice change of pace brew from my typical IPA/Stout/Pale Ales, and I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. I have a feeling I'll be coming back to revisit this one often, as well as searching out more in the style."
"Brown color with hints of red and a decent tan head. smells somewhat funky with belgian dark malts malts reminiscent of dubbels and quads. Hints of fruits, cherries perhaps. Ridiculously sweet in the flavor and a total shocker. somewhat sour, but the sweetness is overpowering initially. As I drink more of it, the sour notes come through along with some medicinal notes, almost like cough syrup. Thicker mouthfeel than expected though still medium-bodied. Overall, not my favorite of the style. The flavor profile is much too sweet for my taste and I would have preferred the sourness to be more prominent."
"Light mouthfeel, that actually seems somewhat creamy smooth. Odd to say for a tart brew. Easy to drink, this is an excellent brew. Highly recommend, especially for those who may just be starting to drink sour, tart beers."
"Overall: A pleasant little beer. Not too harsh. I would certainly try this again."
"An example where I can recognize the high quality of the beer but personally I don't really like it enough to repeat. Poured a 3"" head with a body packed with tiny effervescence. Gorgeous deep clear reddish mahogany body when held up to the light. Smell is a touch sour but interesting - has aspects of fruit and nail polish. Taste seems to be a hibrid of lager, cider, and a little pickle juice. And although this is technically not a sour beer it was a bit too sour for me. Very nicely done product but not one I would buy again."
"O: Ordered this beer randomly from a beer list without know anything about it. Ordered two more after that."
"O- Can't go wrong with this. This is a ""love it or hate it"" style and I think I'm a lover."
"Final verdict. This is one complex and peculiar little beer and one which I would love to drink with pork and sauteed mushrooms."
"Overall, this one contributes to my budget busting sour curiosity and tastes great."
"pours great with a good head. I find it best served slightly chilled or at room temperature. it has a beautiful color somewhere near a dark brownish red. the smell is simple and sweet and slightly sour smelling. the taste is stunning. passion fruit with a hint of chocolate are the flavors dominating. very sweet with an bit of an apple like aftertaste. goes down smooth, almost too smooth! the alcohol is not present at all, this beer is a great way to finish the night! Thanks, Bro!"
"Served from bottle into a Bell's tulip. Poured a deep reddish brown with a two finger off white head with a slight light tan hue that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, cherries, raspberries, and subtle wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, sour, tart, subtle earth, and raspberries. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall there is not a lot you can say bad about this brew. Once upon a time I saw this on the closeout section at Duckworth's, I drank the entire stock of 12 oz bottles they had. Oops... Definitely has an excellent and inviting aroma going on here and a great flavor to go along with that. Everything on this one just works really well together. A great example of the style if you ask me. An absolute must try for any sour fan out there if you have not already."
"Reddish brown hue with active bubbles. Very funky, sour aromas, cherry and wood are hidden in there. Flavors are very vinous and complex. Wet horse blanket and funk dominate over the mellow dark fruits and sour sweet finish. Very cool beer, and definitely a good standy sour. Mouthfeel is very lush and vinous, melts across the tongue. Funny to see the love/hate thing going on with this one, newbies think it taste like vinegar, but those in the know find it delectable."
"Overall - aromas and flavors reminiscent of cherries and apples with some nice, tart, acidic qualities; sweetness light and somehow very smooth and subtle and balancing with sourness; really, really enjoyable sour"
"A great intro to this very interesting style. The tartness is present but tamed. Flavourful throughout and highly quaffable."
"Mouthfeel is ok - at least I think it is. I'm overwhelmed by the sour flavour so it's hard to tell. Overall, I can't stand this beer but I know it's my own dislike for the style. I'm sure it's great for anyone who enjoys the style."
"D: It is a good beer, fun to split with someone, but not an all purpose beer. I cant see it being very civilized out of doors, not especially housebroken, but a refined anemic purebred that is for show and posterity only. However, the fleeting joy is like a puppies feet upon your shins, you jsut wouldn't welcome 4 or 5 in your home, for obvious reasons."
"Overall a great Flanders Red and at 10$ a 750 in my area, it is my regular go to sour."
"not super drinkable, one and done. i prolly wouldnt buy this again. i didnt really enjoy the vinegar and the nuttiness, but some good complexity."
"an interesting, elegant brew, a bit too soury for my own taste"
"I think it's useful to compare it with another readily available sour, the Monk's Cafe flemish sour. It's lower gravity, sweetness, and increased tartness/bite really serves the style in a more palatable way. But that's only if you're part of the musty/bitter camp like me. If you're sweet-toothed, grab one of these, you probably will love it."
"I find this beer to be a bit too sweet for me when fresh, but that really mellows with some age and the sourness becomes more pronounced, although still not exactly mouth-puckeringly sour. Nice balance here; cherry fruitiness and carmely malt blend together perfectly. Mothfeel seems to thin out as it ages, but I'll trade that anyday for less sweetness. A pleasant, easy drinking, lightly sour Flemmish ale...tasty!"
"O - A beginner's sour IMHO. Not as sweet as a Lindemans by any means. Good variety of flavors with decent balancing sourness. Sue liked it at Minnesota Town Hall Tap."
"A very drinkable, and very soft Flanders Red, but I prefer mine with a more robust acidity and deeper complexities from oak and tannins. Still, very enjoyable, very easy to drink and really very refreshing."
"M/D: Good carbonation, and not a bad beer in the least, I would advise letting the beer warm a bit because I found it to taste much better when it warmed up. The metallic flavor was gone. Still I found it to be too sweet, even for the style and could have benefited from being more on the sour side."
"On the whole, this is a nice and drinkable sour-type beer. Not overly tart, but packs much of the sour flavor profile that typically brings praise for this type of beer. Flavorful and pretty well-balanced. For me, this is a nice introduction to the style."
"Overall, a really unique beer. Great way to introduce someone who doesn't like beer to something different... ie, my girlfriend, who loved it. Can't wait to have this for brunch!"
"I love this beer. It is my new vice. It has removed me from all of the Belgian Heffes/Whites."
"P.S. The artwork on the sticker is great."
"O - I really liked this, it could be a great sipper when I'm not in the mood for something too tart. Definitely a nice intro to the world of Flanders Ales, have a Red Wine drinker try this if you want to convert them!"
"Smell has some sourness but not unpleasant. The taste is like a sour ale, not my style but reasonable drinkable."
"Overall, it tastes pretty bad, but nothing else is overly off putting, Get a Rodenbach instead."
"A unique style of beer and something I think most people could enjoy. I think it could be good on a hot day, though not more than one. I think it also has a lot of food pairing potential."
"O- If it weren't for the musky bitterness, I think I would have loved this beer. It was beautiful, smelled divine, but with that musky bitterness and how the beer's flavor changed so rapidly during each sip that it was hard to relax and appreciate the subtle flavors as they slowly evolve on the pallet. Don't think I will be getting another one of these any time soon, but I would certainly like to continue trying the wild/sour beers that the US and Europe have to offer."
"Overall, a pretty solid beer. If it had a more refined sour taste, it could probably be world class, in my opinion. Taste is too schizophrenic, though. Worth a drink, though."
"This one poured a dark cherry brown in color with a quickly dissipating beige head. When you hold it up to the light it is ruby red, like freshly stained wood. This smells like sourdough, vinegar, spoiled milk, and cherries. It instantly makes me think of Monks Cafe. The flavor is just ok. You get ALOT of sweetness though. I'd say it's cloyingly sweet before it goes into the slight sourness. You can actually pick of a trace of alcohol, which is very surprising considering it's only 6.2%. It's tastes of a mix of sweet fruits and condensed milk. Sweet Moses this beer is sweet! How do people drink a 750 by themselves? I kind of like Flanders Red Ales but this beer is far too sweet for me. It doesn't help that the sweetness is the prominent part of the after taste. It's just ok in my opinion."
"I like this. The sourness doesn't grate on you through the glass, and it's not a beer that make you pucker. I could drink a few of these, and I don't say that about many good sour beers."
"Poured from bottle (best by 9/2012 date stamp) into tulip glass. Pours dark redish brown with a quickly discipating creamy white head. Initial aroma is sweet fruit with slight vinous and/or acetic elements. Taste is sour apples/cherries and too much alochol for the low ABV. Body is medium full mainly from the younger of the blend. Depending on the age of the blend the sourness will vary. This sample was much more sour than others that I have had that have been almost cloyingly sweet. This is an interesting beer that attempts a balance between the younger more sweet beer in the blend and the assertively sour older beer. I was disappointed with this one. Not a fan of the style."
"O=I was apprehensive at first, but it's actually very good. For some reason it reminds me of afternoons I spent as a kid in my relative's houses out in the country. I would definitely get this again."
"definitely see myself getting this again (when i have the money to drop one a $20 four pack which probably wont be soon."
" ~ This is something I will seek out again. It is one of the best beers I've had the luxury to sample. If you have the opportunity to try it you should definitely take advantage."
"O: Good flavors, but it is over the top sour for me, a good sipper, but certainly not something I seeking out to have again."
"D: One of the more sessionable sours available. Not a beer I would recommend without a meal to go with it. This is not a good beer to be had alone IMO. I would recommend with chinese or japanese. Maybe even some indian dishes. Would also pair with saucy BBQ."
"D: The sweetness kinda kills the drinkability. I wish the sour was a lot more powerful to balance out the sweetness."
"The CPJ"
"Many say this a ""love or hate"" beer. I do neither, i enjoyed it but i don't think this is such a great one"
"I must say, I think I like Rodenbach Grand Cru a bit better, but the Duchesse is simply sublime. Just a hair on the sweet side, but that's just being nitpicky. This is a phenomenal beer."
"This is an absolutely amazing beer, if you are even remotely interested in sours, you must get this one."
"Drinkability- super easy. The lack of the heavy tart flavor makes this unusually easy."
"Poured into a chalice/snifter. It was a dark brown with flecks of red. It had a tan, two-finger head that left nice rings of lace. It smelled of sour cherries and malt. It tasted very sour with a little sweet kick. There was a good dosage of malt, too. It was crisp and sharp. It was medium-bodied beer."
"Drinkability: This is almost wine-like and lambic-esque in it's tasting...which I'm a fan of. With this in mind, this is so drinkable that it's almost off the scale. I've had this bottle for close to three years and I'm impressed by the flavor that is still evident from this bottle. Must compare it to a newer version to find what the differences are (if any). Would try again, in any form! A must!!!"
"Notes - I enjoy sours and this is one of my favorites of the type. Its always good, easy to drink and just an overall quality choice."
"All in all, I was mighty impressed by this beer. The smell turned me off a bit at first, but it was a small problem with an otherwise delicious beer."
"D couldnt get past the winish notes! not for me. not saying its bad just not my cup of tea."
"Light body, not overly carbonated. Quite drinkable but a sipper nonetheless."
"Drink- Not as bad as what I thought but for the top-20 rating in its style, I thought it was a nice suprice. Was nice to sip on while relaxing. Had a nice profile of sweet/tart flavors to it."
"Overall a really nice, warm weather, easy drinking sour ale. This is the perfect introduction to sours."
"I would like to try a bottle of this just before the 'Best Before' date to see if there is a difference"
"Not a favourite, but there is character enough to keep one exploring, albeit with more than a little trepidation."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. This was a unique style of beer having been my first Flanders Red but with that said, I would drink another right now if I had one :)"
"O - The bomber size is as about as much as I would want. I enjoyed the sour experience, but I hope to find something more to my liking next time I venture for something deemed sour."
"Even still drinkability is pretty solid. I would have this more often if it wasn't so pricey."
"I felt like every taste brought a new flavor to the table. It was incredibly dynamic and smooth. I really enjoyed this beer and I am glad I picked up a second bottle to age in my celar for future enjoyment."
"D-Wow, I was expecting quite a bit more sourness but this reminds me a lot of Lindeman's Faro with a bit of sour."
"Fantastic mouth feel, high carbonation. Taste's of sweet, sour cherry and beer, minor funk cuts through to make it interesting. Drink it too quick and all you get in vinegar, so don't. I'll be drinking this again."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The aftertaste is slightly sweet and slightly sour. This is a very nice Flanders Red Ale. I recommend this beer highly."
"Duchesse De Bourgogne has a reddish brown colour and a decent 5 mm head that fades to lacing quite quickly. The smell is sour and vinegary with a hint of sweetness. Some sour apple and.. some flavour... I can't put my finger on it... maybe umami. The aftertaste is smooth and good with smallest hint of bitterness. The texture is foamy pretty thick. Overall, a very nice sour ale."
"Very drinkable, clean and refreshing, unusual and interesting flavours, and well-balanced sour and sweet. Very complex, won't tire of contemplating the many nuances. An excellent beer I hope to be drinking regularly."
"O- I'm into this. I want to travel to Flanders now and get into all the sour shit they have. The beer was more sweet to me than sour, but not overly."
"Drinkability: I like this beer, but it is a bit too sweet for a sour ale in my opinion."
"Notes: The wonderful balance of flavor and body works to give it lots of complex character and drinkability. I would highly recommend to both wine and beer drinkers who like sours."
"The acidity stays with the beer as I drink but it mellows and there is a little sweetness before the sour takes over. My first impression of the taste was not great however as I drink I find this beer growing on me. It is very good for its style but not an everyday beer for me."
"D-Extremely drinkable. I think it would be perfect to have on a nice summer day sitting out on the deck or proch to end the day."
"D: The 25cl bottles are far too small for this beer. Very drinkable."
"Deep red, brownish color. Extremely pungent smell. Almost like vinegar. The smell almost overpowers everything else. The taste is much better than the smell. This stuff goes down much too easily. Very complex and drinkable, almost too drinkable. Dangerous. Very, very nice. We paired it with a brie with currant jelly. Very nice mixture."
"All and all a bit disappointing. I expected a sour treat and I got a sugar bomb. Oh well."
"D: An 11.2 oz is the perfect serving size for this style beer. More than one might be overkill. But I'll definitely buying a few more to stash and drink at a later time."
"Overall- Extremely complex. I love the Flanders red style (as long as they are well-constructed). This hits the mark."
"D- Easy to drink and enjoy. It is something that I would not like to drink a lot of, but it feels perfect for splitting a 750 mL with someone when have a nice meal."
"D - Brilliant. I could drink this for hours until I succumb to a happiness comatose state."
"D: This is terrific drinking and is not overly sweet or sour like others in its style."
"Drinkability: Amazingly drinkable, especially for a style that people seem to think is less accessible. I really enjoyed this a lot and could easily foresee drinking a whole bottle by myself. Great price, too! $10/bottle for something that is definitely as good as much more expensive ones."
"Taste is very complex, a bit almost too sweet, trappist yeast, interesting, but not the belgin I was expecting"
"As always, my 2Â¢ only..."
"Pours a clear, dark amber (almost brown) with a small off-white head that seems kinda creamy and fluffy. Great tart scents flowing off of this beer. Nice vinegar along with cherries and raspberries. Very nice fruity scent tied in with the vinegar. Taste is not quite as tart as it smells, but does not lower the quality of this beer at all. The sweetness is so complimentary to the light tartness, and this just blends to amount to a very tasty Flemish red. The cherry sweetness really comes through this beer along with some delicious oak and wood flavors. Mouthfeel is very creamy and nicely carbonated. Wasn't expecting this beer to be so creamy and full-bodied. Drinkability is quite high. I would recommend this as a nice starter beer for those trying to get into the Flemish style and move on to more sour ales. Very tasty."
"Pours excellent reddish brown with golden head 2-finger head, leaving some laces. Aroma partially disappointed me - notes of stale cabbage are a bit unpleasant, also fresher dark fruits. Fortunately, taste is quite well - similar to kriek, but, of course, more complex and slightly astringent - tart cherries, dark fruits, wine-like alcohol profile. Excellent carbonation tingles a tongue. Beer for Flanders ales fans."
"D: Have had it both on tap and in bottle, the tap is far superior to the bottles you will get at the local bottle shop...might have to travel abroad to get it on tap, but worth the trip, espcially if you are in Europe enjoying the vacation as well."
"P.S.: If you can find a fresh-er bottle, just do it, the acetic qualities of this beer come real fast as this beer ages."
"I love my first sour beer and Flanders Red Ale. Will power has kept me from having finished the glass already. While this sours might not be a go to, they are a new favorite. Duchesse is nothing extreme but very tasty."
"D. Easily drinkable from start to finish. I thought I would devour it when I took my first sip. It contained me well though. The flavor is so full bodied and complex, it both invites you to drink more and wards you off with a lasting and lingering pucker. Looking forward to another one day soon."
"Mouthfeel is light and dry, effervescent (still pretty darn carbonated). I'd never session such a brew, but it's still tasty and good."
"Highly drinkable despite the price of this beer, but it's totally worth it. Very tasty and easy to kick back."
"2nd- Drinkability - Glad I got to enjoy this beer again! Totally different aspects in tasting the 2nd time as first. Had a glass of water in between beers the 2nd time, and this was the obvious difference. Would drink a 3rd time too!"
"D: The sour pucker followed by the refreshing finish practically begs for another sip; that being said, I prefer to just take my time with beers like this one."
"My first true ""sour"" experience. I'm hooked already!"
"D- Very drinkable. Looking at the bottle, I wasn't sure if I would want to finish it all at once, but I can't help myself"
"Deep ruby color, off-white head with ample carbonation. Good head retention. Strong vinegar aroma, twangy with bready notes too. Raisiny malt. Sour flavor; heavy, earthy malts. Sweet and fruity too. Less vinegar in flavor but still quite acidic. Medium body and a bit on the sweet side. A nice and refreshing beer, good balance of sweet and sour, and with tons of flavor."
"D - the flavours are so interesting, wasn't sure i like it at first taste but a couple sips later and i couldn't stop myself, very easy to drink"
"Overall this beer surprised me a bit, I haven't been a huge fan of any Flanders red or brown ales that I have tried to-date, but this beer is fantastic. It is sweet, tart, has a complex fruitiness (despite having no fruit in it) and a wonderful finish. I will be drinking this again."
"For all the sourness on the nose, this beer ended up having a nice balance of sweet (with a slightly artificial note), sour, and malty that kept me sipping faster than I'd intended. I suppose I could have used a little more sour in the overall flavor balance, but this beer was still very enjoyable."
"I thought this beer had a great reputation, and it did not disapoint."
"Jake"
"D= good but not sure I could have more than two at a sitting since it is very sweet"
"D - Infinitely drinkable. A beer that novices & seasoned BAs alike should love."
"Notes - Well worth the 21.99 for the four pack I bought. Would actually consider buying this again. This would be a good beer to introduce to non beer drinkers that like fruity drinks. My sister doesnt like beer at all. She loved this enough to ask me for one of my bottles."
"I would definitely order this beer again if I ever see it. Would also be a good introductory beer if you're not used to this style."
"This beer has a really great mouthfeel, it is complex and has a very delicious and lingering finish."
"D: Very smooth and delicious, one of the most enjoyable sour type beers I've had to date. I'm thinking this would pair nicely with a large ceasar salad. But smooth enough that it makes a nice session beer -- enjoyed drinking the entire bomber while watching football."
"Notes: so far not my favorite sour ale but definitely a category im falling in love with"
"Did I mention that this beer is like sparkling cider?"
"Deep amber brown with a pillowy sand colored head that burns off fairly quick. Cider vinegar, cherry and oak with a faint ketchup kind of vegetal aroma. Tart cherry, toasted oak and vanilla with a citric sourness. The flavors meld perfectly and are well balanced. Medium light bodied and effervescent. Delicious."
"Ipoured from a bomber into a snifter. Murky purple in color with a nice sticky white head, lots of lacing. Tart, almost vinegar aroma. Sweet and tart flavors, oak and and a very drying finish. Light in body and full or carbonation, almost wine like. A nice change of pace for me, I enjoyed it as an occasional treat."
"Pours a clean orange-ish brown color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sour cherry and oaky hints. In the taste, sweet to sour dark cherry and a small oaky hint. A smooth and sour medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry oaky and cherry aftertaste. Nice oaky hints, with a nice cherry sourness."
"Great balance between sweet and sour. Exceptional drinkability. Outstanding. I'm extremely bummed I don't have another bottle of the Duchesse to sip and savor."
"Pours a nice off red color with a bit of brown. Very light off white head. Nose brings cherries and a bit of balsamic. Slight caramel flavor. The taste brings oak, cherries, acetic acid, and a little bit of caramel. Feel is moderate and quite creamy. A bit of an acetic character. Drinks really, really well and is still one of the best introductory sour beers."
"Poured into a wine glass with a lovely thick foamy head. A dark brown color with a red hue to it. Smells like fig and roasted goodness. Tastes very sweet with a strong note of candied cherries. Feels like a geuze and a faro combined almost. Very sticky on the tongue. Goes down smooth and is pretty drinkable but almost a little too rich. This is my second time drinking this, first on tap and I much say that I do prefer it from the bottle but it really is not great but quite good."
"A rich, sweet beer that came across as not too cloying because of the tart, dryness that went along with it. So much going on in here, though, that I don't know if I could have a whole one."
"My overall impression is that Duchesse is a good beer, but I think her true essence lies beneath the cloying facade."
"I'd definitely get this again."
"Overall Impression: unique and complex, this delicious red ale is reminiscent of a carbonated plum wine. mmmm...give me more."
"it's an ok beer, to be sure. but there are others in this style that I will go to."
"Highly recommended for this style."
"Actually, it's Verhaeghe VICHTE - sorry folks...Pours a beautiful dark cherry red with a half-finger's worth of creamy off white head...decent carbonation...Aroma is wonderful...Some funk, some spice, lots of black cherry and raspberry notes. Very nice so far, one of the best I've seen to this point. Wow!! Very sweet, to some it might be cloying. Brilliant flavors - mostly fruit like cherry and raspberry - very fruit forward to the point it's almost wine-like. This is lucious...The carbonation really rounds out the sweetness. It's really like a black cherry soda with less sugar and with added alcohol. Some may hate this, as it's less a beer and more a Lambic fruit ale, emphasis on the fruit. I love it and think it's awesome anytime of year...must find folks..."
"Mouthfeel is very creamy but fairly light. The light carbonation goes well with the sweet sour finish. Very drinkable"
"This is one great beer. Flavorful, complex, but doesn't overwhelm or knock you out. That said, two is probably my limit. Maybe I had expectation bias, but I went in prepared to love this & I loved it, so there you go."
"Drink - I have to say.. not one of my favorite beers. I can see how it might appeal to some, but this beer isn't for me."
"um... really wasn't sure what to expect from this beer but outside of the smell being a bit off-putting this is a real great beer."
"Drinkability: Overall, this one's pretty drinkable thanks to the silky mouthfeel and fascinating flavor combinations. It's not a session beer, but it has a lot of character, complexity, and new things to discover with each sip."
"This style may not be for me. I find the aroma to be a bit too much, but the flavor is well accomplished, different and complex."
"Taste is fermented plums and raspberries with hint of fig, oaky-woody Dr.Pepper-like character, light fruity-yeasty hint, mostly sweet with light sourness and aftertaste of grains, Dr.Pepper, and fruit."
"M&D. Nice light mouthfeel, not too syrupy or anything but becomes a chore to drink after awhile for me. Would be a great introduction to those looking to explore beers with more sour qualities without being overwhelmed. Dont think I'll be buying much more of this however, a decent offering but when I'm looking for a flanders red ale I'd rather spend my money on some others over this one. (Rodenbachs and La Folie come to mind...)"
"D - I could sip this all night. A great Flanders Red."
"Will be seeking this out again."
"- Overall a tad too sweet for my taste.. would like it to be a lot more sour... and it is a tad over-carbonated. Would like it better I think if more sugars were devoured and made into a 9% flemish. I bet it would taste a lot better."
"Drinkability: I wished I bought another. At 6% ABV, it's sessionable - especially for a Flanders Red."
"I'm not sure what the shelf life is with this beer but the best by date on this bottle is 10/2/10 and today is 9/10/10. I don't know if this beer is past it's prime or what but maybe I'll seek out a little fresher bottle."
"D- This was a good beer that I was glad to try. A perfect amount came in the bottle and left me really not wanting anymore. I would do yourself a favor and seek this beer out."
"Drinkability: A very desirable sour that is a pleasure to partake. Highly recommended."
"11.2oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Best before 10-07-09 indicated on the label (whoops). Pours a hazy chestnut brown with a loose, one inch, tan-colored head embedded with tiny ringlets. Burgundy highlights are revealed when backlit, and head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap revealing porous bands of lacing. Nose is very rich and complex - tart fruit, a little vinegary, a hint of vanilla and a vinous quality; somewhat reminiscent of a cabernet. There also seem to be traces of spice (cinnamon and...) and cork intermingled with the other aromas. Taste consistent with nose - distinctive aromas coalesce nicely into a complex brew; maybe with some traces of wood expressed in the flavor profile, as well as muted atomic fireballs at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light), with an even carbonation level that falls shy of lively and a finish that falls just short of semi-dry. Having never had this before, I can't tell if it's really past it's prime, but I have to say that I found it interesting and complex - a nice introduction to sours for those new to the style in my opinion."
"taste is a bit watery, slightly sour, a little sweetness in the back, dark fruits and cherries, malt, and salmon berry, ends a little tart."
"On draft. Short review as I am at the bar and in a rush. Sour fruit aromas. Acidic taste. Notes of nail polish remover and acetone. The acetone mixed with the sweetness of this beer really is a turn off to me. Reddish color with a tan head. Not terribly good but ok for the style. Light/medium mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is good. Starts off powerful, and finishes pretty mild. I wouldn't recommend this as a session brew due to the vinegar and sourness, but you can if thats your bag. For me, this is a good sipper beer."
"I feel like I'm really being generous with this review."
"All in all, a very good Flanders Red."
"Overall- A very strong strong Flemish Red. In the same realm as Kastel Rouge or Belgian Red but more sour and closer to the style of the Flemish Red. I will definitely drink this beer again. Definitely would pare well with a variety of desserts."
"none of the vinegar acidity i've had in other sour beers. just a really great light fruity tartness. light and full of flavor. i'm a big fan."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, I dig this beer, it's everything a Flanders Red should be. A touch too sweet for revisiting a few times in a sitting. But a nice sour and something that has served as a bridge into the genre for many."
"Again memories of fermented apples in a complex fruity range similar to some raw ciders from Northern Spain."
"overall - very tasty flanders. extremely easy to drink."
"D - couldn't be better. I can put away a 750ml bottle of this like nobody's business & probably do at least once a month. It's not too sour, so I'd absolutely recommend it to someone who's getting started on this style."
"While I don't think I could drink this everyday, the Duchesse is one of my favorite Belgians, and it is definitely worth a try. I would probably drink this on special occasions, or just because it's Tuesday. I would recommend it while having some form of bleu cheese."
"No real tartness, oak character, or yeast notes to speak of for me, just overly sweet thick fruit flavors."
"Seems like it would god very well with a rich steak, salty meats, subtle balsamic salads or nuts."
"I would imagine some age would dry this beer out and make it a truly delicious experiences that isn't quite so sweet."
"An interesting taste... Light drinkable, good. Poured reddish brown with a reddis hint of tan head. Smell kind of reminds me of soy sauce. Taste is complicated with various fruits and vinegar noticable. Sort of slick to the tongue Pretty drinkable for such an odd flavor and smell/"
"My wife has told me that if we ever renew our vows, The Duchess is going to make an appearance at the toast. It really is that good and classy. Try this now! Beer will never seem the same to you again!"
"O This would be a good apertif beer, I simply prefer a little less fruit. That is not to say this is a bad beer, it is quite good and full of fruit flavors. For those so inclined, you will like this beer. Too sweet for diehard hop fans but good for the Belgian beginner."
"D: Real easy to drink, but as much as I enjoyed this one, I wouldn't have more than one or two in an evening."
"D: Just a very nice beer. Both aggressive and mellow. A strange combination, and one I wish I had a few more bottles of. Very nice."
"MF is decent, a bit prickly, medium bodied, dry finish. Not as dry as I would have preferred, however. Sweetness on the back end of this one gets in the way of the drinkability, though this is a nicely crafted Flanders."
"Drinkability: Absolutely a new staple beer in my fridge. Great flavor thats complex and diverse enough to keep you interested, and tasty enough to keep you coming back for more. The body of this beer is perfect, and the ABV is perfect for sessioning. Absolutely recommend this beer!"
"Drinkability is great. What a great example of the style. I think I prefer Rodenbach though, the nose on this one is just a tiny bit off putting to me. Don't get me wrong though, this is still a top notch beer."
"A tasty, tasty beer. Lots of good here and while not easy to drink, it's the sort of sour I'd be back for in an instant."
"Taste is initially very sour and slightly funky, but the sourness settles down very quickly into ripened fruits (cherry, plum, jam, pear). The finish is long and lingering. The sourness almost completely subsides into the background and becomes just a tartness in the mouthfeel after 1/3 of glass. After that point it just tastes like a very interesting dessert wine, and very easy going down, yet tastes far from simple. Duchesse is a wonderfully smooth Flanders that can be drunken like session beer and hold my interest at the same time. I feel lucky to be close to pubs that serve it on the tap regularly."
"D: For a sour brew incredibly drinkable, this is such a fine and unique brew."
"d - excellent beer. just amazing."
"I will definitely try this one again soon if I can. I was surprised and impressed."
"Overall, I enjoyed this particular serving more than the other bottle I had about a year ago, which tasted more like vinegar and old stale wine to me, this serving may have been fresher as it was cleaner and presented with more fruit sweetness."
"drinkability - remarkably complex, very rich and flavorful, the excessive carbonation and the initial vinegar in the nose are this beer's biggest flaws but the rest of the ale is very well crafted, amazing flavor and great value"
"D. Wonderful. This is a wonderful sour that I could definitely see myself picking up again - especially since it's now available at the grocery store I regularly shop at."
"Impressions: I'll preface by saying that I've never had a Flemish Red before, but I really tried to keep an open mind. There may be a possibility that I got a bad bottle. This just was not good. I had a really hard time even finishing it. It was like drinking balsamic vinaigrette. I've heard this described as being ""wine-like", frankly if I had a wine that tasted like this, I'd think it had spoiled. This just tasted too much like vinegar."
"A lovely deep burgundy color, with a huge creamy head. Smell is interesting, woody/fruity/musty. Taste doesn't really live up to the smell though -- it's sour, fruity, and refreshing, but not complex, and the woody notes in the smell are barely evident in the taste."
"Great drinkability. I am loving this and am a little upset that I haven't tried it sooner. An awesome all around beer that I will definitely have again."
"This is a very enjoyable and pleasant introduction to the Flanders Red family, and leaves me not only wanting more of this style, but definitely more of this beer as well."
"D: My first Flanders Red. I loved it."
"thick pillowy head and lots of lacing. hazy amber brown body. Hits the pallete sweet, and then the earthy tannins take over and gives a nice dry finish. Grape and Wine characteristics, At the start of the sip i taste sweet red apple but that turns into tart Green Apple by the end. good viscosity and carbination gives a great strong body that with the tart finish stays very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Overall a solid representation of the style. Not something I could drink all the time but a nice change of pace to shock the taste buds."
"(D)- An interesting beer. Being the first of the style I have consumed, I am not familiar with it, but it is intriguing me. I am glad this was split, cause I might have had trouble if I drank one on my own. It fits the style as far as I can tell well. I look forward to trying more."
"If I had split this bottle with someone else, I would of had a much more positive review. Definitely a solid dessert sipper among friends but not as enjoyable alone."
"D - This beer is insanely drinkable. Before finishing my review my pour from the 750 ml bottle was nearly gone. I busted out my 11.2 oz bottle to enjoy some more. Fantastic flavor and good aroma with such a well-balanced flavor and finish. I could put down a 750 ml of this myself no problem. Thanks Bnieman for recommending this time and time again and thanks Todd for bringing it over!"
"Overall, I really enjoyed this brew and will seek it out in the future. Perfect way to start off the evening prior to enjoying dinner."
"Lighter in body with a good amount of carbonation. So refreshing. Very little trace of alcohol. This is world class."
"All around a great beer."
"Nice brown color, with good lacing, although it did not look promising initially. Not much of a nose, but a huge sour and fruit taste on the tongue...very intriguing. MF is thin, but good enough for the style. Drinkability is good, as I find with these sours - they always go too fast. Nice example of the style, recommended."
"Pours a wine-like garnet color with a medium sized white head, foamy around the edge. Aroma is like a vinegar dressing, not entirely sour, sort of like overripe fruit mixed with a merlot. The wine comparisons carry over to the taste, which starts out sweet like grapes before going sour, giving the beer a balance regarding those two characteristics. It's an odd sour, wine-like taste not present in other Belgian brew like classic lambics or gueuze. Easily the most wine-like beers I have ever had and one of the most unique."
"Finally bought this again and guess what? I like it a lot now. What used to taste like a crazy balsamic vinegar drink now tastes more like some sort of raspberry quad. I've bought two more and I think I'll keep going. My ratings stay the same though."
"Drinkability: a good beer and good example of this type. But, it would be hard for me to have more than one of these."
"pours a dark red brown with a tan 2 finger head from an 11.2 oz bottle..the smell is sweet and tart with berries and melon smells along with a sour patch vinegar smell..the taste is a sweet and very tart a dry berry taste followed with a sour patch vinegar shot for the palate ..this is a full bodied mouth feel ..its a sipper..and as it warms malts and a slight roast taste mixes with the tart fruit and sour vinegar taste ..this is well balanced and nothing overwhelms in this flanders..glad i bought the 11.2 oz bottle it was just enough.. i did like the label also"
"D- This is definitely a strange beer. I like it, but I think its going to become a bit cloying as it is quite sweet. I should have had someone help me with this bottle."
"An interesting experience."
"Really great beer. Poured into a NB goblet with some vigor. Great head retention with nice off-white lacing around the glass. The nose definitely gives off some decent tartness along with melon and grape notes common with the style; some faint wood in the background complemented by subtle coriander. The taste is really spectacular: great tartness throughout with a slight lingering acidic note on the immediate finish, soft fruit (grape, melon), great herbal character with very nominal medicinal quality on the mid-palate, wood noticeable but less so than on the nose. Clean mouthfeel with a bit of chewiness/stickiness on the immediate tasting. Some points off the drinkability for the simple fact this is a sipper; not likely to throw down a grip of these back-to-back."
"This one caught me by suprise. This beer (if you can even call it that) pours a clear reddish brown with a thin fizzy head that atually foams up after waiting a few minutes. The nose was loaded with red berries, citrus, sweet malts and yeast. The palate was loaded with red fruit and citrus flavors with some wonderful notes of bread, yeast and spice. Evryone should try this at least once."
"Cheers~"
"Slightly cloying in the mouth, but still manages to stay pretty fresh thanks to the acidity."
"I'm really enjoying this beer but it's hitting me a little like a lambic: a bit too sour to session. I feel like two of these might leave my stomach feeling like I just ate a few too many Cherry Blasters. I am enjoying this more than the Cantillon, however. I would definitely drink this again though and would be very interested to try other beers in the style."
"As a BA you hope and need to try every style out there, just to be well-rounded, so I attempted to enter the realm of sours, and failed when I started with a Supplication, just didn't get it. So thanks to Ed at Ledgers Liqours in Berkeley, he informed me that this would be where to begin. Now I know this isn't and American Wild Ale/ Sour, but i'll work up to that. This poured a deep amber, small head. Smell was sweet vinegar. Taste started pretty sour, but ended with a sweet vinegar taste. This is quite drinkable once you get going on it. Very good."
"Notes: Not a bad sour beer. It is a touch sweet for an acidic beer, but it isn't anything like say a Lindeman's fruit beer. Not the boldest or strongest sour out there, but it was a nice beer to drink. Worth a try and would probably be a good gateway to sours. Pretty well balanced and enjoyable to drink."
"D: The sweetness balancing some of the sourness makes this very drinkable and refreshing."
"d- this is a really top notch beer, that is a palate changer. this isn't overly sour, but gives just enough edge to make it interesting. i'll be drinking this again for sure."
"D: This is a nice beer, well blended, more of a sipper, but highly enjoyable beer!"
"D - Dangerously drinkable! Refreshing! Wow..."
"the drinkability is fair, after a half a glass it gets a little sweet. this would benefit from a little dryness, because it has a nice flavor, and really everything else about the beer is very good, it just gets a little soda-like after a while."
"The crisp finish and understated mouthfeel make this beer an easy drinker: three tasting swigs and I had made a serious dent in the tulip's contents. Overall a very nice, very different beer for me."
"Drinkability: This seems to me like a fine archtype of what a Flanders Red Ale should be: It has nice complexity, it is intriguing, it is challenging on the palate plus there is no noticeable flaws. I do think however that it could benefit from less sweetness. The alcohol isn't too evident, so there would be decent leeway to do it. Would have again and it makes for a good gimmick beer to shock your friends."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is low. Way to much sweetness to have any more than one. Overall, I was not impressed by the Duchesse. I did not think the flavors went well at all. The sweet and the sour are supposed to play off of one another, this did not happen here. I really thought it was somewhat of a mess. Won't be purchasing again. Skal."
"D: Again, I can see why these types of beers are known as the Burgundies of Belgium. Not only the colour, but they are delicious, complex; they have some wildness to them but are still completely distinct from the lambic beer family. I'd love to pair this with a venison steak and cherry reduction sauce, I think that would be amazing. The nice thing about this beer is it is very easy to find and not overpriced in the current price range of Belgian beers. It's making me wonder why it took me so long to revisit it."
"The first 2/3 of the glass went down easier than the last 1/3. I liked this beer alot, but I'm glad I found a small bottle and didn't have to commit to a bomber."
"One last thought: this abomination ruined half of a bottle of delirium nocturnum, the beer we chose to wash out this foul flavor."
"D - Easy to drink but not all that memorable. While the flavor isn't bad it just isn't all that exciting. I was hoping for more sour notes than this. I would drink this one again sometime but don't plan on seeking it out."
"Reviewed this according to the style discription. Lot's of stuff happening here flavour-wise. A sipper, not a session beer and really not one of my favourite beer style. An aquired taste IMO."
"Wow, a pretty special beer. Cherry, sherry, sweet vermouth kind of nose which was a bit of a surprise but pleasant all the same. Follows through with the sweet vermouth kind of flavours on the palate; low carbonation gives it quite a wine like feel. A beautifully complex beer worth trying and worth coming back to. This kind of beer just can`t be easily copied. Nor should anyone try to."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Belgian goblet. Pours a dark red, crystal clear with a good amount of head, leaving lacing down the glass as it disipates. The smell is sweet, tangy and oh-so inviting. I once heard someone describe the aroma as fermented ketchup and bowling alley shoes, but it's pretty damn wonderful if you ask me. The taste is equally amazing. A bit of sweet malt paired with a delicious tang that I've come to crave over time. Despite it's sour elements, the beer finishes pretty clean, although there's certainly a bit of the liveliness that lingers behind. Honestly, I could drink this stuff all day. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea (or beer rather) but the duchess will always have a space reserved in my beer fridge. Definitely worth trying at least once, it might even change the world of beer for you forever."
"D: This is too sweet to have many in a row, but it is quite mild and refreshing like sparkling juice."
"Drinkability: A real bargain for the $8.49 I paid for the 750ml bottle. Will be drinking it reguarly."
"D -- Again and again and some more. Please. This is the beer that introduced me to the style, and not many can even come close. Worth anyone's money for the experience alone."
"Easy to drink - if you like the style, which I do. It's really fun and deep."
"Drinkability: this is a freakin' delicious beer. I am sad I have never had this up until now. I would drink this daily if I had the money."
"A nose that directly think of red grapes and more particularly to wine (particularly in 75cl bottles where it is much more emphasized) but also harmonious tannins, probably due to a shift in casks. It also collects other flavors of red fruits, including cherries how. The palate is sweet tasting at first but it soon becomes sour. The finish leaves an impression of Red Flanders but more complex than his sisters and that's what makes it so valuable. Bubbly, light and far from being disgusting, it can boast of offering both unique flavors and easy to drink."
"When I drill down the review, this doesn't seem too great, but this is a go to beer for me nonetheless. Regardless of this being a bit late to taste, I did not notice any differences to that which I am used to with a fresh bottle."
"Of course, the whole experience was a lot better in the first place (the restaurant), but I have to admit that this is my favorite beer. And for 3,55$ the bottle, it is more than respectable for the great time you will have drinking this delicious nectar."
"D- Perhaps a little sweeter than I would hpe for the style, but a nice beer all the same."
"Overall: Easily one of my favorite beers and at $5.00 a fairly good value for something bottle conditioned and imported. There is so much going on in this beer- take your time and let it warm up (don't drink this any cooler than 50 degrees!). I would recommend pairing it with some homemade blackberry jam on whole grain toast, maybe some sharp cheddar on the side."
"D- Not my personal favorite but a beer i'll go back to for a different look on how tart can be mixed with malty sweetness."
"D - Not very high, but it is still an an enjoyable beer. One should enjoy this in moderation (not because of the alcohol content, rather, because of the acidity). I've got to mention this was my first sour beer ever, so my palate was totally unexperienced. I was still able to enjoy the beer quite a bit!"
"This would be really good with vanilla ice cream or a plain cheesecake. A killer reduction sauce could be made out of this stuff."
"D - A great sweet desert beer. Complex and interesting. Sweet but unmistakably beer."
"Overall, kind of disappointed with this one. I have a feeling that this might be a bad bottle, but if all others are like this, this definitely is not a good representation of the style."
"D- An interesting a refreshing beer unique from just about all other beers; almost champagne-like in nature and feel but with a nice tartness."
"D- the flavor of oak in this brew is remarkable. Being only the 2nd Flanders red I've tried, my respect for this style has increased exponentially. Such a perfect balance between sweet And sour is rarely seen in the culinary world Apart from some kick ass Chinese buffet. Not a session ale but definitely a winner that should come to me in bigger bottles."
"D: randomly picked this one and it is delicious, drinkable, awesome beer. will buy this one again."
"Ok so I haven't had many flanders reds and I know they are supposed to be sour so maybe I need to try more of them but this was tough to drink. It tasted like oaked cherry coke with a bit of port and chocolate in the background. It was a beautiful looking pour but it took me a WHILE to finish this one. It was better room temp. So let it sit for a while. I had it just slightly chilled to begin with which wasn't as good. Maybe it needed to mellow."
"Overall, a little disappointed but a nice take on this style."
"A little sweeter than what I prefer but works well with sharp cheese."
"D- Overall, not bad but the cider and vinegar can weigh heavy on your stomach if you have too many. Very pleasureable to drink though."
"Top score on drinkability - pretty sure I could've chugged this. Bottle is going down way too quickly."
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium a prickly amount of carbonation that is a little harsh."
"not quite the flanders red i was looking for. the sourness was too subtle however the grape flavor was nice. very middle of the road."
"I am pleased with this beer. It is a style I have tried once before but that one really lacked the complexity of this one. This one is a treat."
"Pours dark red with an off-white head. The aroma is tart fruit with a little bit of vinegar. The flavor is a great combination of sweet and sour. The flavors include oak and lots of dark fruit such as plums, cherries and possibly apples and grapes. You get some tart cherries as well as a lot of sweeter fruit to balance out the tartness. Thin mouthfeel and low carbonation. A great beer."
"This beer is a great introduction to sour beers, with a soft approach to the vineous flavors in the flanders style. As I drink more and more sour beers, this beer's back sweetened style is less palatable. But the complexity in this beer will blow the mind of someone who hasn't had a sour beers and it won't create a phobic sour beer hater..."
"D - unique, even for the style. just sour enough for some character, but the sweet fruits mostly dominate. wine lovers might like this, and also a good intro to the style."
"Overall this was quite an experience and I am glad that I revisited this style, but still not really a fan. Thanks hyempdaddy for picking this one up. Recommended to fans of the style and worth a look to those that are intrigued by sours."
"***Re-reviewed 5.18.2010 to edit review from 1.13.2010. The score changed to reflect a better nose, but more noticeable fillingness of the beer. Also, I seem to have missed a handful of details the first time I experienced this brew, so tasting notes were augmented.***"
"Overall, very good, very drinkable. Good with a variety of foods."
"D: More drinkable than say, a wild ale, and is much tamer in mouthfeel comparison. Nice distribution of aromas and flavors. Very stimulating and definitely palatable, might max out at two in a session."
"My biggest qualm with this beer is inconstancy. It's my girlfriend's favorite beer so I drink it alot but it's rarely the same twice. Sometimes sour takes center stage, sometimes sweet, sometimes its perfectly balanced and unilateral (which is when Duchesse is at her best). Sometimes I think I just haven't figured out an aging schedule, sometimes I think it's just an off bottle."
"D Very good indeed. After smelling the beer I was afraid that it may not be that drinkable but that sweetness makes it really approachable and I finished the goblet without much delay at all. 4.5"
"Drinks great, it's tough to find sours that are drinkable and this is definately."
"Beautiful burgundy appearance. Deep dark red, fairly clear. Smells like a fantastic sour beer mixed with red wine. I really liked the aroma except there was a faint hint of metal. The tast up front is fantastic. Great sour bite that quickly fades into an almost soda-like sweetness. The finish of the beer is very sweet, more like wine than beer. The mouthfeel is soft. Subtle carbonation. The beer is very well-crafted but the drinkability is negatively affected by the sweetness in the finish."
"Pours a very deep red with a ton of tan head. The head dissapears quickly, but leaves a hefty amount of thick lacing along the top of the glass. The aroma reminds me very much of malt venegar and is incredibly acrid. The taste is slightly sour, acidic, and subdued. It reminds me more of cherries than anything else. Extraordinarily smooth, this is an amazing beer. I will definitely buy this many more times."
"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this one. I had heart a lot of great things about the Duchesse but for me it really pales in comparison to Rodenbach and Rodenbach Grand Cru. Not a bad beer, just too sweet for me and lacking in that tartness that I love so much in this style."
"I had this on tap and thought it was brilliant!! After having this beer I became aware of how biased I was toward American craft beers. This beer pours a beautiful deep chestnut with limited head. The nose has sun dried fruit with a flavor that has a nice maltyness with raisin. mmmm!"
"Beer is sweet and sour, the sweetness comes first but its quickly overtaken by the sour nature of the beer. Beer is smooth and has a thin body. The drinkability is high and the midpalate is where the majority of the flavor is noticed. Its a good example of a sour beer."
"D - I will drink this anywhere, anytime. Nice stuff."
"I agree with others, this is one complex beer that in my opinion, really has to be tried on its own. You need to start the night with this, and really forget your preconceived notions of what a beer is. This is a unique and wonderfull drink."
"Pours a lovely deep dark ruby brown color with pillowy off white head. Smell is of balsamic vinegar, tart cherry with hints of pear. Taste is a quick burst of tart cherry and apple cider vinegar / balsamic vinegar quickly backing off into a nice blend of semi-sweet fruit with a very earthy grain profile. Body medium... prickly at first, mellowing out quickly. Very good taste without overpowering. Would be a very good introduction into the world of sour beer for the novice."
"D: a delightful example of the flanders red style. Good for those looking to get in to sour ales, since this one is somewhat tame."
"Medium bodied, maybe a little thin, medium carbonation. Duchesse looks good, smells fairly good, and the taste is good, but a little weird. That sharp acid upfront is just strange, but it balances out by the middle and into the finish. The sweetness of the fruit helps bring it all together. I could rate this one much higher if not for that vinegar touch, but it is still enjoyable for the most part. Good to try no doubt, but I won't be stocking up on these."
"This is one of my favorite beers for late fall, and through the winter. Guests are delighted to try it, and it pairs well with seasonal ingredients. A prize example of a Flemish red ale."
"Highly drinkable. I would prefer just a little more sourness with maybe a little less sweetness, but this is obviously a superb and easily accessible example of the style."
"Overall, I enjoy this beer and would drink it or other examples of the style. It is very interesting and refreshing."
"11-ish bottle to glass. Gentle pour leads to huge head, color is dark brown/red. Smell is somewhat sweet and a little vinegar. Taste is somewhat like soda pop in carbonation and sweetness, with decent sourness. Not as sweet as Monk's Cafe, a good thing. More interesting than drinkable for me."
"I was suspiciou at first of this beer. I am not generally a fan of Sours, but this one won me over. Very smooth and crisp. Has a nice sour taste and a full body but without the tartness of many sours. This is a beer that will not pucker your mouth with its tartness. it has a surprisingly sweet finish to it and is imminently drinkable. Even more the aroma is not overwhelming like many other sours."
"All in all, if you are looking for a beer that is unique and different--you've come to the right place! ~"
"I haven't had many example of this style but I really am enjoying the trip. It wasn't as tart and sour as I had expected and the sweet finish was unexpected. I am unsure of the bottling date but i think I might pick up another bottle and let it age until closer to the expiration date to see how the tartness develops."
"D: Not too bad given the sourness."
"D: very drinkable, find myself wanting another even though i have yet to finish the one in front of me"
"D - I've had this before and I didn't really like it, but I'm fairly new to this game and my palate has adjusted. I didn't mind it this time around, but 1 is enough for me."
"Drinkability: This is a fantastic beer. A very flavorful and balanced flanders ale. The sourness is there, the acidity is there and the fruit is there. This will end up in my crate again without a doubt."
"Had at Poechenellekelder in Brussels. Dense head that released a cloud of tart fruit with slight tones of honey, but you can tell from the first whiff that this is going to be sour. Dense, dark color and very light carbonation. Taste is lightly vinegary, somewhat sweet and pleasantly tart. Not overly sour, but just enough to make you stop and drink slowly. Gains complexity when it warms up, so sip!"
"Drinkability: Surprisingly I would have this again, the nose really hides the sweet undertone in the taste, I would have this again and recommend this to those who want to try a sour but aren't prepared for a full blown sour ale. Opens with fruit and finishes rather tart and sour but not overwhelming."
"D - This is a fantastic flanders w/ subtle smooth sour blended with the fruit and sweet notes. The Duchesse stands alone as I have not had a beer quite like her, very drinkable sweet/sour blend and I find this an easy ale to drink but prefer to save it for occasions."
"D: Takes me awhile to put a bottle down but I can easily do it. Not an everyday beer for me, but a treat that I like to enjoy every once and awhile."
"Overall this is a good brew to enjoy a meal with, but a 750 will probably need to be shared. This brew is a bit sweet and cloying to enjoy a large amount of."
"D: Delicious beer. Duchesse is something between a Faro Lambic and a Barley Wine. Quite easy drinking. Interesting experience. After the first glass I though: ""too sweet and perhaps too 'winy'""... After the second glass I felt in love :p... Very drinkable, 750ml gone like water..."
"D - exceptional. I easily finished the 750."
"I really liked this one overall. Not only does it do what the style intends, it just down right pleases! Don't get me wrong, this one is all beer, but may also be one that can pull those who usually shun beer over to the dark side! I had some cheesecake cake around, and really enjoyed the Duchesse as it complimented the cheesecake perfectly. Since it weighs in at around 6% ABV, if you want another you can."
"one of the most unique brews ive tried...the wood and tartness really make this one shine...recommended to all"
"This is great beer. Not high in alcohol and the ladies sem to love it. I prefer the bottle version and would prefer the smaller version, I couldent take to much more than that. Big bottles are great for sharing. This would go well with some dark meats. With all this said Out of all the flanders red's I've had it's low in ranking because of the over the top vinegar taste, I've had better."
"Flavors of this beer were mind bending. I will say it was a little sweet, but balanced fairly well with the sour."
"D= This beer achieved the nearly impossible feat of being tartly acidic AND silky sweet. A very complex ale and one I will rush to buy more of...simply incredible!"
"T: Shockingly sweet, puckeringly sour cherry with a rounding our creaminess. Vanilla cherry cheese cake! Perfectly balanced, unique, exciting, and tasty!"
"D: Highly drinkable and would make a great session beer if it was a little lower in ABV. However, a little too sweet in my opinion. Fantastic if one is into fruit lambics."
"Drinkability: Not usually a big fan of Flemish Red beers but this is a huge exception. The flavours are so complex that by the time you finish it you will have changed your mind about the flavours more time than you can count. Even if you hate the style, you need to try this, you will be surprised."
"Mouthfeel: Sour, sour and sour! Yet the beer is still creaming, with just enough carbonation to keep the beer feeling alive on the palate"
"This beer is an absolute classic in my book and it's the first that showed me the unlimited options and characteristics a beer could have when I first started getting into craft brew."
"Low carbonation and smooth is the best way to describe this delicious red ale, I would definitely recommend this, and could do very well as a dessert beer."
"Overall: Too much sourness for me. I couldn't give this beer a fair enough shake. It was wonderfully complex but all I could pick out enough to name were the sour characteristics which a lot of people seem to love lately. Give this beer a shot - it's a masterfully crafted beer that was just too much sourness for me."
"Notes: I think there is going to be a long love between myself and sours."
"D - Very, very drinkable."
"What a stupendous beer! Complex palate and very well executed. Drinkability makes this a sipping beer, however."
"This is a tough style to drink a few of anyway. However, this guy was pretty easy to get down and has a manageable abv. This really challenges the palate and nose, I wouldn't want more than one of these anyway."
"I've got to say, for my first experience with a Flemish, I don't like it one bit. I'm sure this is a very good example of the style, which is why I'm going to rate it high because it's got all the characteristics. It just seems this style isn't my cup of tea."
"I will continue to try different sours since flanders reds are supposedly very acetic compared to the rest. This one is not very appealing to me however. Time will tell whether or not I like brett character any more than acetic acid."
"Overall, very drinkable; couldn't even taste the alcohol and probably would have had a few more if I could have afforded to."
"This drinks light. It's heavily carbonated with light sweet finish."
"Drinkability: Gets better with each sip and as it warms. I feel I could have just kept sipping all night - damn 10oz glass!"
"Great beer and a good gateway into sour beers."
"Overall: Complex w/various aged beers combined. Didn't even know this was a sour before I tried it and was pleasantly surprised."
"Mouthfeel is effervescent and medium bodied. I'm already a bit tired of this thanks to the ""rotten"" taste. I was expecting more sour. I really enjoyed Ommegang Rouge and was hoping this would come close to it but it's definitely missed that mark for me."
"D - Very easy drink, particularly if you like sour taste. Will get you drunk quite easily."
"This beer pours a dark ruby colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head,it has a real sherry,port,winish smell about it with aromas of dark cherry,raisins and brown vinegar aswell,it has nice mouthfeel that feels heavy at first then finishes quite light with a sour,bitter/sweet finish that has tastes of blackberries and some raspberries and definately has alot of similar characteristics as a fine port,i quite enjoyed this beer but dont think i could drink it all night."
"Sorry for any typos I reviewed this on my friends phone"
"It tastes ok, but the smell overshadows the taste. It is a light complex flavor, but nothing special for this red."
"D: I don't see how even a fan of the style could find any sour to posses high drinkablity. The sweetness and sour quickly spoils your palate. That being said, the lightness almost makes quaffing easier than sipping. I do think it would be better with fruit and cheese."
"Overall, a real unique beer. I heard the bartender say something about a sour ale matured in oak casks and double fermented. Instantly I knew I had to try it, I'm glad I did."
"A very tasty beer, it's my second of the style, the first being it's stable-mate, Vichtenaar. It reminds me that I need to drink these more often. Not something that woule be a good choice for sessioning, but it hits the spot after work and would probably do so after dinner as well."
"D - Its been awhile since the last time I had it and forgot how good this beer was its a great gateway to sour beer a must try"
"D- This beer is still good, don't get me wrong...I guess I was anticipating an over-the-top sour that was in your face with the funk and would make your lips pucker...but that isn't this brew...this brew is very nicely balanced for the style, and is a very good introduction for those who haven't tried a beer of this variety...cheers!"
"Oh, yum. Why have I not tried this beer until now? Delicious, delicate notes of toffee and caramel malt join with a drying tartness on the finish that leans toward apple cider and various other dark fruits (e.g., raisin, fig, and plum). I wish the sour flavor matched that of the aroma, as it's a bit subdued in comparison. Still, the well-carbonated body adds some zest to the finish, and the medium consistency is juicy and surprisingly thirst-quenching. Hard to believe, but this made an excellent night cap for a day spent moving furniture in the hot Houston sun. Easily a must-try, and one I'll be sure to have again."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly easy to drink. It drinks fast, but its something you want to savor. A super beer overall. The price is a bit steep. Will drink again but not for a while. Ommegang Rogue was a lot more vinegar At 9.99$"
"I will probably not drink it again"
"Well, I will not try this beer again. Too bad, as I really liked the taste. The smell spoils it all."
"The smell initially turned me off to this beer. Offensive to my nose, but very deliberate. Maybe you'll like it better. The taste was a ride. I'd definitely have it again if offered, but likely will not buy it in bottles again."
"Ridiculously drinkable. Excellent beer. Tremendously enjoyable to drink and goes down all too easy."
"D: Very drinkable, indeed."
"D - A very intereting beer I'd indeed drink again. A great beer for wine nerds who say beer isn't complex..."
"D= pretty good. I was a little let down by this beer. I had high hopes for it but it didn't live up to them. Still a quality brew."
"My first Flanders Red. Not my last. This is inspiring me to brew my own Flanders. Very different, very wine like in both smaell and taste."
"D: I'm still getting used to these sour ales and this is a great one to start on. Nothing overly intense about it, but a nice beer nonetheless."
"drinkability: very easy... I could session this at a nice dinner"
"An interesting experience, but not an overwhelming one. I'd like to try a bigger sour to see what the fuss is about. I can see that this is a well-constructed beer, but if its representative of sours, perhaps it won't be the style for me."
"I honestly don't know what to say. I have never had a beer like this before. To say that this is unique is an understatement. But vinegar flavors in beer? I don't know. This probably isn't one I will return to very often."
"Pours out hazy and amber colored. The head is white colored, fizzy and loose looking, that kind of falls back and leaves only a bit of lacing. Looks about normal for the style. The smell is just very vinegary, almost to the point where it sort of turns you off. Reminds me of Easter egg dying day. There's a nice tart note in the background, a hint of sweetness, but the vinegar smells make it hard to pick anything else out. I'd call this score more of a median score than an average score, because it smells all but average - but it doesn't impress me, yet doesn't disappoint me at the same time. The vinegar carries over to the taste, but it's much more to my liking here. The tartness still came through in the taste, but the beer still had a moderate sweetness, quite enough to make this one enjoyable. This one does a good job with the style, and in terms of flavor, is a beer to shoot for, but something I still think can be passed. Pretty enjoyable if you can get past the vinegar smell. The body is actually a bit thin, but is still quite pleasant thanks to the tartness. Not very malty, but just enough sweetness to get by. The carbonation is nice, bites just a bit without getting in the way. The drinkability is good, this one must be consumed rather slowly, though - just as the whole style ought to be. But overall, a good drink, something like a night cap for this one, and I'd recommend it to others hoping to explore the style."
"It pours a brownish-red. While the smell is good, the taste is like a complex explosion. Every sip brought something different to the tongue. It ends with a clean, wine-like dry finish - just bordering on sharp. If you don't like any sweet/fruit taste, avoid this beer."
"D- Incredible drink. Thirst quenching and a great complement to all sorts of food. Sweet and tart without being overbearingly puckering. Glows as it warms up! Best when served at recommended temperature. Got better to the last sip!"
"Alcohol is almost non existent in the taste and the carbonation is perfect almost playful on the palate. Definately a delightful beer that I will have to pick up more often."
"I am going to finish this 750 pretty easily. Nice beer."
"Definitely a sipper that can stand up to almost any food you'd want to pair it with."
"A wee bit expensive but worth every penny. also a great transition beer for anyone who thinks they arent into flanders red's, very easy to get into."
"i had trouble drinking my 8 oz. pour, and couldn't see myself handling any more."
"Duchesse de Bourgogne pours a nice finger of beige foam over an opaque dark brown brew, though it shows a certain rosiness when held up to the light. The nose is a bit of Belgian yeast funk, caramel, and a note of sharp cidery tartness. The flavor echos the nose- soft, not-quite sweet fruit with caramel notes up front, with a sparkling, vinous, citric tartness off the back. Mouthfeel is round, yet light, cleansing, and dry- there are notes of herbs in the aftertaste. The tartness is nowhere near as puckering as a good Lambic- there's just enough to make this beer very appetizing . Very drinkable and a good introduction to sour beers!"
"This is a drinkable beer but the tartness should be balanced with food."
"D: This isn't a ballgame chugger, but a nightcap sipper, to be enjoyed by the fireside. Does that make it less drinkable than an ESB? I think not."
"This is an extremely sweet beer and a true sipper. The sourness blends well and is not overwhelming. For a non-beer drinker this would stun the socks off of them - this is beer? A really well balanced and yet complex beer. Worth checking out."
"Notes - This had a good mouthfeel and a medium body. This is a really good beer I will have again."
"This also just happens to be one of the few beers I can get my girlfriend to drink and makes for a good way to introduce good beer to those who don't like that ""beer"" taste."
"Overall an okay intro to sours because of it's mellow character and availability but a far shot from what this style has to offer. I skipped this beer on my sour education and I really don't feel I missed out."
"[RR]"
"Conclusion: Interesting and definitely unique....I had this once before with goat cheese and marinara...that was pretty tasty...by itself this is a bit intense, and while I can appreciate the complexity and uniqueness of the style, I'm not sure this one is for me...it was alright with Jarlsberg though."
"d- i could drink this shit up every day of the week. well....i order beer so why not? *marks down one case of duchesse for wednesday's delivery*."
"A rather complex and sexy offering, the sourness alluring enough to draw one in, but not too pungent to outstay its welcome. In the end, one has to describe this as a more sweet than sour, tasty tipple, a testament to the mutability of things."
"D=overall good, not too sweet, not too tart really pretty balanced but with some sourness, not too difficult to finish the 750."
"D - What can I say about the Duchesse? Very unique, not something that I was quite into, but there again maybe something that will grow on me"
"Drink it!"
"Pretty drinkable and overall, a very nice brew. As my first sour, I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleased with the results. Can't wait to explore more sours now!"
"Overall, I love sours but this one was just not my cup of tea. Sour, yet sweet with a vinegar scent was all too much for me. I'll pass."
"Very refreshing overall, but too sweet."
"Talk about a beer growing on you... I find this totally drinkable and have really grown to like this as I work my way through the glass."
"pour is a reddish brown. rather clear. a small head off that color. smell is a sour tang, but not as prodominant as other flemish reds. more earthy tones. cherry tart first off but a bouquet of fruit, wood, balsamic vinegar. palate reveals a worcestershire sauce quality, earthy fruit that have a citrus quality. fig, plum, black berry, grape. cherry tart is not as astringent as most. musky earth mostly. the earth even has a smoked quality to it. the taste is good but i don't believe this beer was ever made to be had alone. i couldn't drink more than one in its particular qualities. its a bit rich and unique. not to be had outside of dietary circumstances. but a fantastic accompaniment and a most for bbq, game, and robust cheeses. will have again but with food."
"The foam when poured was a fluffy dark wheat, lacey, thick and ever-lasting (alot o' foam). Color was reddish/brown, amber, mahogany and deep rose red. Smell was deep, robust, rich, alittle bitter, fruity/orange and carmel undertones. Taste was very deep and rich. Fruity with a hint of high-alchohol content, chery sour apple highlight (like others from their beer line). Mouthfeel - very heavy-bodied, smooth and sour. Drinkability - you can't just 'slam' this beer, it need to be taken in slowly like wine."
"This beer pours ruby red in color with a small off-white head. Smells like wine and dry vinegar certainly unique even for a good sour. The taste is dry and sour but not as sour as the nose with tart cherries, wine flavors and others that i can't even begin to describe. Drinkability is prohibited only by the price tag. I could sip on this all night long. One of the most unique beers I have ever come across."
"D: This is one of the less-sour sours that I've had, but somehow it falls into one of the less drinkable for me as well. Still pretty darn good though."
"Lots of conflicting sensations that end up magically working together. Very complex but approachable. Sort of like going to the aquarium... I get to dip my hand in to touch some friendly critters while looking at all the dangers and extremes of sour-land. Though it's very inviting, it's just doesn't compare to my favorite styles."
"This is nothing at all like the only other Flanders Red I tried, but an excellent beer that could easily be utilized as a gateway to craft or Belgians. Duchesse, I bow to you, & hope we meet again."
"Overall an extraordinarily smooth beer, would pair exceptionally well with a cobbler, apple tart, or a summer fool."
"Taste is a gentle, dry blast of sour. Tastes like a sweet and sour champagne - tons of carbonation, with a sugary aspect to it. I thought it would be much drier from the smell. Sourness is well balanced, leads to a very refreshing experience. More of a vinegaric sourness than a tart sourness, but it's smoothed against the beer. Only quibble is that it seems a little thin, doesn't have a lot of oomph or gravitas to it, just the flavor. Not sure if that's how the style is supposed to be. Drinkability is top notch, great sipper (although could go more if I wanted to). My first Flanders Red, and I'm looking forward to trying some more!"
"Incredibly easy to drink considering how sour it is. Loads of fruit flavor and that great sour bite. Highly recommend."
"This is a good beer and I look forward to trying it again, though I can't see where all the sour hype comes from! This is nothing to a Cantillion Kriek."
"Great beer, sour sweet balance. Enjoyable for a long drink. Best in Vichte where it comes from. Verhaeghe brewery is very lovely little building, family business...just great! I was lucky enough to visit it several times. I liked their other beers too, but this is one is exceptional. i saw more beers from wooden casks lately in the US, but this is a bit different..."
"I could drink a lot of this, but it is definitely one to be savored. I will be disappointed to see the bottom of this glass. If only it would stick around as long as Joe. Get out you damn fool!!!"
"Pours a reddish brown with a large tan head that had good retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma consists of a mild funkiness complimented by red wine and vinegar. The taste is just mildly tart. Some fruity sweetness also comes through. Some mild barnyard notes in the dry finish. Perfect mouthfeel. Soft texture that coats the mouth. Light body with mild carbonation. If someone is looking for an extra tart and funky beer, this is not the beer for you."
"4 M&3.5 D: can't complain at all about the texture--creamy and softly carbonated on the mouthfeel, and the body is quite solid yet pretty refreshingly-light vis-a-vis the flavour. Somehow the sweet edge of this beer is still what fails to convince me, just like my first encounter three years ago: the sweet, sugary edge running in parallel to, rather than hand in hand with, the sour-fruitiness poses the largest difficulty b/w me and this otherwise fantastic beer. Guess I'd only be converted to this ale either when my palate changes, or the brewer budges."
"I've been in a beer funk but this may have pulled me out of it. Pours very dark but upon examination turns out to be a dark ruby color with thick, creamy, off-white head. Amazing retention and good lacing. Very nice looking beer. Smell is tart with some sour green apple, vineager, and some yeast as well. Taste has a complex bunch of flavors but the ones that stuck out most to me was a sweet grape. Some apple and pear as well. A sharp tartness to it that is very well balance by a nice sweetness. Very complex beer. Mouthfeel was medium and its very smooth going down as it leaves you a nice aftertaste. Overall a great beer and the lower ABV makes it very drinkable."
"D: A fantastic beer with great vinous aromas and flavors. Very complex and well balanced."
"Alternating tart and sweet finish, good enough body, leaves me feeling uneasy, but I want more, like Match Point or Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Did I mention Scarlett Johansson's hot?"
"not for the faint hearted!"
"This is the first of this style that I've really tried, I bought it in January in Quebec. Poured an amber red colour, and the head was minimal but very long lasting. The first taste was very sour and almost wine like, further drinking revealed a much more complex flavour profile, sweet and sour, almost like grape juice with hints of green apple and cherry. The carbonation is slightly prickly, very Belgian. Very drinkable and well deserved of its high rating. I have another bottle in my basement. Always buy 2 to avoid disappointment!"
"Drinkability: I think this would be an excellent starter sour. The taste is amazing and I could drink several as the alcohol is hidden."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, cork states expiration date of 12/09. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a reddish/brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is average, lacing is good. It smells like tart cherries, apples and vinegar. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like slightly tart cherries, apples, plums and a bit of funk and vinegar. The taste isn't quite as sour as I expected it to be, but I think it's pretty good. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and slick and well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth, refreshing and very enjoyable and easy to drink. I'd buy this again in the future, I think this is a pretty good brew. Recommended."
"D - Could only have one of these. A very good brew, just not my preference. I can appreciate the quality."
"Pours a brown-reddish colored body, with a tannish head, small, and lastingish. Has a sour dark fruit aroma, alcoholy. Fruity sweet taste. Very fizzy. Not as sour as it smells. Light fruity, appley. A little flat. Light taste. Might be better w/food."
"Overall, this is beer is a great and unique experience, though I haven't even finished this one and I'm looking at my snifter like I don't know if I can take any more. It's tasty, but I don't think it's something you'd want to drink more than one 11.2 oz. bottle of in a night."
"I think I need to try a few others of this style, definitely something I think needs to grow on me."
"If it wasn't for the cost of these little bottles, I would certainly be drinking more."
"Left some nice Belgian lace on the glass."
"If you've never had a flemish red I highly recommend starting here."
"In the mouth: exceptional! Deep and powerfully complex. Sour cherries, apples, a little salt, satisfying sweet-sour balance. Very malty and rich, a little vanilla and butter and white pepper. Not very high in alcohol which is great because I wanted to drink this all night long!"
"Although I prefer Rodenbach Grand Cru in this style, my appreciation for this beer has grown over the years."
"D: This is complex enough that I want to have this again and savor it. It will make a wonderful treat beer. But I would not want to have more than one in a row, since its flavor profile is quite strong."
"Awesome beer! Cheers!"
"Talk about enjoyable, creamy satisfying and complex. Being one of the first Flanders I've had, I have to say I'm impressed. Going to be looking for others."
"Taste is full of vinegar, but also sour apple and cherry. For all its sour flavor, however, Duchesse finishes a bit sweet. Mouthfeel after the puckering effect is a bit salty, but otherwise the finish is pretty clean. Overall, I enjoyed the very different flavors and textures, and I'll buy this again as a treat, though maybe not every week or month."
"For my first Flanders Red, I was very intrigued. I will certainly give the style more consideration in the future."
"D, i find this beer very good ,like a fine wine the more i drink it the more i appreciate the multiple flavors"
"D. This beer is quite drinkable as it is one of the most refreshing drinks I've had in a while. Paired with Chicken Alfredo was excellent!"
"Taste hits the sides of the tongue with sour first, then hints of ripe cherry on the palate. Not heavy and very well balanced. Taste lingers for quite some time. One sip makes me crave another. An amazing mix of sweet & sour, highly drinkable and sadly my 25cl bottle is gone. Will definitely seek this one out again."
"Great mouthfeel. Sweet, flavorful finish but not too much."
"Very unusual, although I am not well-versed in this style, so perhaps they are all like this! Rye or pumpernickel nose. Very fruity and malty tasting. Not much head, but highly carbonated. Slightly tastes like dry cider. Tastes more alcoholic than it supposedly is. Quite an interesting beer, and certainly worth at least trying."
"D: Sour ales just really appeal to me, I found that this beer is incredibly palletable, and just kept me wanting more."
"too sweet, almost cloying, and certainly not enough acidity or complex funkiness. pales in comparison to rodenbach grand cru or even monk's cafe. but i understand the appeal for sour beer novices, so this prevents me from totally trashing it."
"Never in a million years did I think I'd say it, but I love Duchesse!"
"Picked up a corked bottle at Whole Food Cambridge for $9.99. This was a pre-Valentine's Day dinner beer. Paired with a variety of cheeses. Poured into stemmed glassware. Dark red color with a hint of burnt orange. Thin bubbly head. Moderate amount of carbonation. Smelled a bit sour, as expected. Taste, though, was unexpected. I thought that I knew what to expect, but I got so much more. Wow, this was nice. I was thinking it would be just another Flanders ale, with a nice sour profile. Instead, it had a wonderful fruit (cherry, strawberry) flavor up front. There was a bit of sourness at the back end, but it did not detract from the excellent taste. Very light and smooth. This beer jumped very high on my list of favorite Belgian offerings."
"Medium body, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: Excellent beer, easily could drink multiple 750s of this. Great beer all around. Not nearly as intense as other Flanders Red's that I have tried. Excellent beer."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Light carbonation and a great taste make this a must try."
"It was a nice refreshing brew to some of the others I have tried in the past and is very drinkable if you can get past the ever-present vinegar smell."
"Had a bottle last night on the front porch. It poured a small head with just the perfect amount of carbonation. The smell was a bit like raisins, prunes, and a touch of wine. Smelled a bit like alcohol but that was nowhere in the taste. It tasted amazing, with just the perfect amount of sweetness. Cool and extremely smooth, it almost felt like drinking a soda. Dr. Pepper, to be exact. It was my first for this style that I can remember, and it has left me wanting a whole lot more."
"I would definitely recommend this brew to anyone. Much fun!"
"Served in a Chalice. Thin light tan head that dissipates quickly. A quite lovely deep brown with a reddish tint. Strong vinegar aroma. Flavor has the vinegar, but not as noticeably as the aroma. That musky, deep flavor is quite enjoyable. A sharp, wine like taste. I'm having trouble finding descriptors that fit the taste of this beer. The body is solid if a little thin. Very drinkable, if these flavors fit you. I enjoy this beer a lot, even though I have a difficult time describing it."
"On an additional note, my experience sharing Duchess with others is that beer lovers of the Flanders red style, and Belgian beers in general, love this drink. It's also an ideal beer for converting oenophiles and other beer-skeptics to the cause of drinking good, quality beer. Women who say they hate beer have expressed particular enjoyment with this one. Not always, but mostly."
"Taste: Vinegar, sour/tart cherries, raspberry, cider. Very sour, and not sweet like rodenbach. Nice oak wood element. I do wish it were a bit more sour with a little less vinegar. Way too sweet though. Refreshing and enjoyable, but the sweetness detracts from the drinkability. I prefer it on tap."
"I realize that many people like this beer, but even after fighting through the soy sauce/mustard smell, I couldn't drink it. The strange sweet and sour taste along with the smell was a bit too much for me. Perhaps I'll try it again someday with better results. It's a pretty unique flavor for a beer, but one that I did not enjoy in any way."
"Best Before 03-10-09 Pours a reddish brown with a head that dissipates fast. Aroma is sour, lactic, vinigar dominates, with some wood. Flavor is sweet up front, some then vinigar, with a wood finish and some lingering lactic notes. This one kind of grows on me. At first I thought it wood be drain pour (and I love sours) because of the too much vinigar and sweetness, but the flavors start to blend into something that is more enjoyable as you drink this brew. Mouthfeel lacks significant carbonation but has a decently rich body that compensates."
"D: This was easily my favorite beer at the Monk. A good sipping beer that I wish was served in a larger glass. Almost frighteningly good to my pallet. Well worth a revisit."
"D - Edit: i felt compelled to change the rating on this category. I have since tried other Flanders Red ales and because of their lack of flavor, they were hard to drink! Old rating: 2.0. new rating: 3.5"
"No kidding, I thought this was a lambic, but upon inquiry came to find that the sourness actually comes from the aging in oak casks - no lambic at all. Well done!"
"750ml split with my girlfriend. Hope she likes it! Haha... Expiration date of Dec 2008. It's January. Oh well. Poured into a Tripel Karmeliet tulip a dark brown color with ruby highlights and a large light pink colored head with lots of carbonation bubbles keeping good head retention. Very nice lacing. First aroma is sour cherries and then comes the vinegar. There's an underlying sweetness in the nose, maybe some brown sugar, and slight metallic notes. Flavors of ripe cherry, slightly sour, acidic and tart, maple brown sugar, and a chalky sort of sweetness reminiscent of smarties candy. There's also a certain fruitiness, some apples and pears come to mind. This is complex and tasty. Definitely some wine-like characteristics. Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation. It's tasty, but I couldn't see myself drinking an entire 750. I like it but have had better Flemish Reds, namely Rodenbach Grand Cru. Still a good treat."
"One of the most contrasting beers I've ever had. The sourness is heavily mixed with a very sweet, almost syrupy, flavor."
"Dark rust red to brown in color, has a fuzzy sort of opacity, not really blacked out, more unintentionally veiled. Not a lot of obvious fizz, the head is very light and disintegrates into little islands across the surface. Intense, multi-faceted nose of vinegar, tea leafs, plum to candied cherry fruit, rum, soy sauce, green apple, esters, almost could pose as a very traditional (cubed beef) barbecue sauce. Medium-bodied, playful carbonation crests like waves in the mouth. The sour vinegar component met head on by golden raisin, date and then cherry, raspberry fruit. Yeasty in a subtle way, works consciously in concert with the rest. Tea, tar, kindling wood. Nothing screams hops nor malts, category mistake to think of this beer in those terms. It's really an intellectual challenge to your taste buds, a can you keep up with the syllabus sort of situation. You may not love it, you may not hate it, but you must taste it."
"D- This is a great Flanders Red and pretty drinkable. Definitely will have again."
"Reddish brown ale, Very sweet, almost wine like. a little tart after-taste. It was a very good beer and I highly recommend it. I'm going to need to try this one again."
"Drinkability: Sipper, but oh my this is a wonderful sipper. Definitely pairs well with anything resembling a 13th century meal or something more elegant. This is the one beer that all the wine drinkers I know who hate beer will drink."
"A very good example of a Flanders and a style that I truly enjoy I always grab this when I see it on tap. I found a bottle cheap up north I guess they didn't know what they had. So it was a fine treat for a winter's day"
"D: Poured into a goblet, I could enjoy the Duchesse all evening long"
"D: Served in a 10oz goblet; good but wouldn't have too many."
"Served on Tap at the Town Hall Brewery in Minneapolis. Poured a very clear red/brown color with a small white head that faded quickly. Aroma was sour and funky with dried fruit. Taste was similar to the aroma but tart and had an oak flavor as well. Finish was very dry and the tart flavor slowly dissipated over time. Mouthfeel was sticky and carbonation was low. Overall, a great beer for a first review and good representation of the style."
"Pours a beautifully clear red/brown with a bubbly off white head that starts off strong but leaves us much too soon but sticks much lace on my glass. Smells of horsehair, must, oak, some berries, tart acidic. Taste is filled with all the wonderful things I smelled. I pick up the funk sweet and sour dried fruits, some vanilla, even a faint bourbon in there as well. Mouthfeel is syrupy, sticky, smooth. Body is medium, carbonation is low but ample. I wish I had tried this sooner as it is a fantastic sour and seems to be readily available in my area."
"Duchesse on tap is much more uniform, much more sour, and just does not have that complex range of flavors. I found the beer to be a bit vinegary, overly sour, less carbonated than in the bottle, and just a downer. I wouldnt go back to this on tap again, knowing what is in store in the bottle version."
"I have heard that this is very much like wine. I would have to agree with that opinion, and add that I would take this any day over wine. So complex, and very unique. This should be shown off to every wine geek to show the depth and range of this amazing beverage."
"This is pretty drinkable save for the coppery middle palate, which dissipates further into the beer."
"This is a really distinctive brew. Sweet, but unlike your lambics, the sweetness is offset by the malt and pungent peat. Really distinctive flavor, really good atmosphere, really good drinkability. One of the only downsides is the smell is almost overwhelmingly sweet. Overall very good quaff. I highly recommend trying this one if you have the opportunity."
"Tap at the Falling Rock. Poured a dark opaque brown with slight red tints, had no head by the time it got to me. Smelled sugary and fruity, mainly of raisins. Tasted more sweet then sour to me, mainly of cherries and raisins. It's not overly sour making it a great beer for those that need a good balance between sweet and sour in a sour brew. In all, a very likable beer."
"About 13 bucks if you find a four-pack of small bottles, and 9-10 dollars for a the more common 750 mL."
"Well, this is my first real sour, and it is fantastic. I'm leaving some room in my score because I need more experience to give too high of a score. I will be coming back to this review when I've had a few more sours. This beer pours a beautiful red brown that looks incredible in my St. Bernardus glass. The aroma is tart, hinting at the sour cherry flavor. The flavor is big sour cherry with an underlying oakiness. It is fairly close to a sour cider that has been aged in wood barrels. There are flavors of great fruit vinegar. The feel is silky and mildly bracing. It's the best fruit flavor in a beer that I've ever tasted. I'm extremely tempted just to give higher scores now."
"This was my first Flanders Red Ale, but I definitely believe I started with a good one. Some very unique and exceptional characteristics in this beer."
"D - This is not my favorite style of ale, so I can't say it would be a staple. For the style, it's one of the better balanced flavors, which is not overly sour. I would favor this over others."
"On-tap at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Served, post-dinner, in a large wine glass, murky brown with no head. This beer reminds me of Goudenband. The beer menu described this as having chocolate-covered raisin flavors, and I think that's a bit of a stretch. Certainly, there is a pairing of sweet candy and sour flavors, and I can find raisins in here, but no chocolate. This beer is not that much of a dessert beer. For it's creamy mix of flavor (which also includes salad vinaigrette) it's not an incredibly drinkable beer, but it is a semi-approachable sour ale that drinks a bit like a thick hard cider. Not my favorite, but a beer to try if you're into the wild styles."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Flanders red ale."
"D: Pretty drinkable if you're into the style I suppose."
"D: Highly recommended. smooth and is very drinkable."
"Very enjoyable beer. Was my first foray into the Flemish sours. Pours a clear brown with no head. Aroma is sour malt and apples. The taste is very light and smooth. Sour up front that turns sweet, almost like a brewer's take on champagne. It got better as it warmed. Will definitely seek this one out again."
"d: I like sour beer, but this one just isn't for me. Strangely, it was just too sweet."
"Deep brown, with amber and ruby colored prisms reflecting from each angle, the nose is distinctly aromatic of balsamic vinegar, as suggested by the storekeep. Bubbling on the lips and then sweetly settling on the tongue, blossoming out with initial flavors of vinegar down the center, with more robust fruits, cinnamon adn dark break congealing at the back of the throat, yet leaving a dryness in the mouth. Smooth throughout and surprisingly complex, but odd in the fact that sour vinegar is predominant. That makes it difficult completely without a food accompaniment, but well worth the try and oddly enjoyable."
"Easily the best Flanders Red I've tried. It's somewhat expensive, but totally worth it. I would like to get another bottle of Rodenbach Grand Cru to compare with since that was the first Flanders Red I'd ever had."
"Excellent!"
"Delightful carbonation, though."
"The Duchesse pours a transparent burnt copper with a firm head of light brown foam,it leaves some spotty lacing. The nose is sour and reminds me of spoiled tomatoes,not completely rotten,but close. This Flanders starts off sweet and reminds me of apple cider or apple butter,with some sour tartness and subtle spice. Midway I pickup some aged barrel flavorings and vinegar,still reminds me of salad dressing in a way. The end is tomato ketchup like and for me keeps the score down a half point. I enjoy this offering three fourths of the way through but the finish keeps me from wanting much more. Medium bodied with quite a lot of carbonation,and a slick feel. I had the Duchesse a while back and I'm almost sure it was rotten,I couldn't even finish it and scored it an F. The Duchesse De Bourgogne has proven to be a very complex woman that I'm still trying to figure out completely."
"Appears as a cola with a tinge of orange. Lacing around rim and surface with little head around the rim supported by good carbonation. Smells of vinegar, apple, dark fruit, and spice. This is my fourth time having this and the taste is more musty than I remember it. Tastes mostly of apple, oak, and light vinegar. It is deliciously well-balanced between sweet and tart. Goes down easy and very smooth. Finishes with a nice bite. Medium body and good drinkability. Really fantastic!"
"Pours a dark amber brown with burgundy edges. Beautiful aroma of oak, cherry, vanilla and sour tartness. The combination of the two aged brown ales provides this beer with a perfect smooth balance that is not to sweet and not to tart. Hints of oak, vanilla, grape, cherry, sugar and sourness."
"was sent this in a bif, i cant thank coldmeat23 enough for my chance to try this one, poured into my duvel tulip, poured a rich wine like shade of brownish red with dense tanish white head on it that sticks around for awhile, the sourness of this beer was aperant when i uncorked her as a tart cherry sent filled my nose, as far as taste i taste, apple cider, red wine viniger, tart cheries, strong oak notes, some lemon, figs a hint of malt all of witch have taken my tastebuds hostage and thay never want to be let go. this is my favorite beer so far of all time! this is a stile i will have to find more of"
"The aroma was super sour and of a tart cherry. The taste had some good tartness but not as much as I was expecting from the nose. It was dry in the mouth and left you with a tingling at the back of the throat. It was lightly carbonated and offset with some sweetness on the back end of the drink. Overall a enjoyable brew I would have again."
"Stunning."
"D: It's good to try, but not sure if I'd do a ton ton of them. Once a year beer. Too tart for me."
"D: Hard to get a lot of this down because of the vinegar flavor and acidity. I wouldn't want to drink more than 1 of these in a session."
"This is a designer beer, I've had it on tap and bottled before, it wasn't great then. My wife doesn't like it and I don't either."
"4.0/5"
"D- Fairly low IMO. While the taste is very unique and alcohol not that noticeable, this brew is way too complex. I enjoyed the experience but not something I would be able to drink routinely."
"This beer is very drinkable, I could not taste the alcohol in the flavor. It was not overly sweet, and you can have more than one, although I wouldn't go as far as saying its a great session beer. I look forward to having more of these!"
"Overall I enjoyed this one. The mouthfeel makes it very light and refreshing. Give this one a shot if you see it around."
"D- This is a good beer. The vinegar sourness is definitely the highlight with everything else in the background. Nice, complex Belgian all around. Probably will have this again."
"Drinkability: Recommended. An enjoyable, tasty, relatively smooth Flemish Red jam-packed with rich fruity complexities."
"M: The beer was very smooth and creamy, low carbonation and very easy to drink, but would I want to drink another right afterward, probably not, but would I drink again, without a doubt."
"D - Could have had a couple more glasses of the Duchesse! Goes down great and the flavors are outstanding!"
"On tap at Madison WI's Malt House. Ruddy brown color. Vinegar aroma. Wonderfully complex sweet/sour balance in flavor with some mild cherry fruitiness. With a very basic understanding of the fine range of Belgian beers, I asked for something sour out of curiosity. I've seen beer lovers go ga-ga over sour ales, and I had to know what this was about. The aroma threw me off quite a bit, the strong astringency was very off-putting and made me afraid that I might be in over my head. The flavor though was quite a redemption. Duchesse had an interesting tartness that worked nicely with the understated malt notes and cherry. Really easy to drink, and unique enough that I would have a few glasses without getting bored. I'm looking forward to more ales like this one in my future!"
"The first time I tried this beer I think I fell in love with it. Pours a dark copper/ruby color with minimal head. Strong smell of tart fruit on the nose. Complex tastes of sour figs, raisins and plums with low carbonation. Everything about this beer is balanced perfectly. Minimal carbonation makes this a beer you could drink all night. Instead have one every once and a while. You don't want to kill the appeal of The Duchesse."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a good bit of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. I haven't had a lot of sours, but this one makes me want to try more."
"D - You can drink this one for hours."
"Poured a 11.2oz bottle into my Unibroue tulip. This beer pours a turbid burnt sienna with a 2 inch tan head that leaves slight lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is sweet fruits, apples, sour pie cherries, and caramelized brown sugar. The taste is amazing. Granny Smith and Fuji apples fly up front, with sour pie cherries, and Belgian candy sugar. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly dry. This is an exceptional beer that everyone should try."
"Interesting to bring to a tasting of Belgians, and a good example of this style."
"Pours a deep cherry brown with an off-white head. The head dissipates to leave a nice layer of foam and a lot of lacing. Smells of sour fruit up front; lots of cherry. Malt and residual sugars are definitely present as well, lending some sweet notes to the tartness. The taste is apple cider vinegar mixed with simple syrup. Cherry and caramel apple flavors are there, along with some woodiness. The sweetness doesn't really balance the sour character, just makes it seem disjointed. Not a great take on a sour."
"Drinkability- This beer is delicious very unique, a definite must try."
"Pours a reddish deep brown, copper when held to the light. Off white head without much retention. Smells strongly of balsamic vinegar, yeast, cherries, and grapes. Has a sharp up front taste, which proceeds to the feeling you have just ate a slice of bread. Not as sour as the aroma leads on, but could be too much for some people."
"D - While not an everyday kinda drink, this brew provided tastes unseen b4. Nap time is near with this beer. Yummmzzz."
"Duchesse de Bourgogne is a super-fine drink with great medium feel and fine carbonation. Despite copious fruity sweetness, the drink never approaches any level of 'cloying'. A quaffable, sweet Flanders Red."
"D - Amazing stuff. Great balance between sweet and sour, I could drink this all day. Very good."
"Drinkability - Have had this out of the bottle before. The first time was in my beer infancy, and didn't know what to expect. Trying this again was a real rebirth for this one. So much better than I ever remember it being. Great sipper to enjoy and fall into."
"I'm not sure if I got a good bottle of this one, will have to try again, but it's expensive. It was from a 750ml bottle."
"Pours a dark rusty reddish color with a thick foamy head. Smells of tart cherries, apples, and fermented grapes. First sip is mellow with sours notes that are subdued and quiet, not ""In your face."" Cherries, green apples, raisins, maybe a tad of brown sugar, all combining in flavor. Creamy mouthfeel, but slightly under carbonated. Considerably more sweeter than sour, the brew finishes well with a little stronger bitterness. Very Good."
"D- easy to drink and interesting enough to want a few more sips than the 11.2oz bottle had to offer. i dont think id want another whole one, or a 750ml but i can see myself coming back to this one at a later date."
"D - A wonderful, unique, exciting beer, but not one that I could drink all night. Grab a few to taste with friends, but make sure to grab some chocolate or even some creamy blue cheese to complement this remarkable brew! You'll love it!"
"d. Excellent and dynamic. The spectrum of flavor profiles in this one is strong - not as wide as some, but more drinkable than some - and is definitely a good access point to the style. It's great for sipping, although I subconsciously was so enamored with it this time around that i ended up finishing it faster than I realized. I could drink a few glasses at a time, especially given how well it pairs with foods."
"I still could not drink more than one glass of this in a sitting unless I was eating a large meal with it and needed more than one glass to accompany my meal."
"pours a mahogany color with a big, frothy, ivory head. great lacing. the nose is sourness, oak, alcohol spice. Wow! the taste! great sour tartness! oak characteristics, alcohol, sour raspberries. medium bodied, high frizzy carbo, sour candy finish. A great sour ale!"
"D: I enjoyed my bottle and will drink this again and soon"
"Peace."
"Nice mahogony color with a creamy off white head. Nice lacing. Smell of sour cherries domminates. As it warms the smell gets richer and fuller as the oak flavors kick in and it slips almost into wine territory. Taste is just so full and rich, tons of sour fruit backed by oak. You should definately not drink this one too cold. Creamy medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall I rate this one in the excellent category, not quite world class but close. You just don't want this one to end."
"This beer poured a very nice reddish brown with an excellent white head. The smell was of yeast and tart cherries. The taste was sweet and tart. Full of red berries in the flavor. Sour cherries was the dominant flavor of this beer. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkability was also very nice. Overall this was a very nice beer. I enjoyed this beer a great deal because of the flavors."
"The 750ml only set me back about $8.00 in a local store so its a good oud bruin at a fair price."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable, just a notch behind Rodenbach."
"D: This beer is amazing. I want more and I find myself nursing this because I don't want it to end. I could easily drink this in a couple gulps but that would be a waste. The Smell, Taste and Feel are all great. This brew is great. If I ever run across some, I will buy at least half a case. This brew is so dynamic. Loving it."
"I could drink this beer all night. I'd even consider shelling out a lot of cash for a case of this stuff."
"Ovr: Very nice red ale."
"T/M/D - wow, is this something special! The cherry/raspberry/strawberry flavor is there, but it not in a overly sweet or syrupy way at all - more sour, but not aggressively so. The beer also has a texture - it feels and tastes thick and creamy but not heavy. Amazing! I've had this on tap once before buying a bottle, and the bottled version tastes exactly the same! Outstanding stuff."
"i bought a case of Duchesse De Bourgogne bottles in emmaus pa, at shangys. i love Flemish red ale and this is the perfect example of Flemish red. its refreshing and tastes great. its not the strongest of beers but the taste makes up for that. there is nothing to complain about with this beer. its distributed well in America and is not too hard to find. if anyone sees this beer and is curious as to what a good red ale tastes like, try it!"
"Drink ability= When I first really go into beer, it took me awhile to get used to the concept of wanting a bitter beer. It was contrary to my nature, but the sour and funk of this beer has pulled me in almost immediately. A highly drinkable beer, and I'm glad I picked it as my first Flemish."
"Moutfheel is very clean, but quite tart and biting."
"Pours a nice brownish red with decent white head. Good flemish sour fruit nose, with some oaky scent. Slight oak flavor, strong flemish taste with mild sourness and good dark sour fruit taste. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp with ample carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, but there is a sort of chalky acidity that I am not a big fan of. I notice it in all flemish reds, but particularly strong in this one. A very good example of the style, and one I will revisiit when craving some flem."
"HV"
"Pours a gorgeous clear ruby color, big dense sand-colored head fades very slowly, leaves a nice foamy layer on top of the beer, and lots of lacing on the glass. Smell is sour cherries and green apples. Very tart taste, sour like the skin on a green apple, slight vinegar taste. Tight carbonation, but still pretty creamy, especially as it warms. This is my first of the style, and I'm certainly intrigued. Definitely not an everyday drinker, but very tasty, and something I'd have again in a heartbeat."
"M/D - Medium bodied and somewhat over carbonated. A very unique style but rather drinkable."
"Pours a very nice dark copper/garnet color, a little shiny, that turned to more of a brown/garnet color later as the beer diminished in the glass, with great head and lacing. very nice sour and slightly fruity aroma. it has a great tart/sour flavor, a little fruity, that (with each drink) started sweet, turned slightly bitter, and became a nice mix at the end. Very smooth, just a bit of roughness at the end. Excellent beer."
"Overall - I bought this one on sale at Beers of the World for $10/4 pack (regularly $22 I think), still before the freshness date. I was slightly apprehensive to try it, seeing as I've never had a Flanders/Flemish Red Ale before but I was quite surprised by its tastiness and drinkability. It is a most interesting beer. It's like a blend of a Belgian dark ale and a cherry lambic with high levels of tartness. Well balanced and will entice the adventurous palate. Beauty in a very different beer. I could drink this all day."
"This was still one of my first belgian sour ales and so far the only one I liked. It reminded me of lambic. Very drinkable."
"I picked this beer at random and now I am extremely satisfied about my choice. Certainly will drink this beer again."
"Tan brown color with a purple grape juice-like tone when held to the light. Off white sticky head. Smells vinegary, sour, and acidic. It really shines in flavor though. Has an apple cider-like sweetness but not overly sugary as it has a bready malt to match and a sourness that puckers the sides of the tongue. This stuff just tastes delicious."
"wow, a very different brew indeed ... lots of complex and strangely exotic (erotic?) flavours ... crazy good full mouthfeel ... it is uplifting and tangy, with some jump up and dance qualities .. a fitting beer for the 2008 champions league! ... full, delicious, and a damn enjoyable beer... Come On United!!!"
"Overall: My first Flander's Red is quite the experience. Very sweet in the mouth and sour on the nose."
"I've had the Duchesse De Bourgogne on so many occasions now, including the beer at different ages, and I can honestly say that it is always a treat. The Duchesse especially epitomizes the art of Flemish brewing."
"D - I would order this again, but in a bottle to see how its different. I think this would be a good beer to age and see how the flavors meld."
"Cranberries, cherries and balsamic in the smell. Light brown and slowly diminishing head with a dark amber body. Taste is moderatley acidic but the balsamic is still pretty strong. The cherries and balsamic is just too much for me. Decent, but my thing."
"Pours a murky dark amber color, with a frothy two-finger head and not much lacing. Nose is dark fruit and vinegar, with that lactic sour sting. The sourness hits first, but then quickly fades, giving way to sugar. Like pure sugar. This is waaay too sweet for the flemish sour style. The sweetness & sugar overpower any hint that his might be a Flanders Red. Tastes to me like what Dogfish Head would do with this style. Medium mouthfeel, but the sweetness takes away that crisp, palate-cleansing refreshment I so look forward to with Flanders Reds. If you're new to the style, it might be an interesting drink. if you've had any other Flanders Reds, avoid it."
"nice dark copper color. small frosty bubbles, not too much head, good looking. great sour smell - not too surprising knowing it is a flemish sour - a bit heavy on the vinegar smell - a little musty and moldy smell as well - but not all in a bad way. taste is not quite as good as it looks or smells. a bit disappointing. had a bit of an off flavor. it is within style, but just not the best flemish sour that i have had. one glass is enough of this one."
"Medium-full body, a little aftertaste, but very pleasant as well."
"Red-plum body supports a thick, off-white head with solid durability, nicely effervescent. Sour apple/grape aromas blend with lemon and cider vinegar, mixing sweet/tart with downright sour. I also get the faint hint of Worcester Sauce. The taste is sweeter than the nose, though primarily sour. Sour apple and grape find a nice foil in cherry, very delicious. Slightly viscous, tartly syrupy. Very nicely done. If it were somewhat less tart, I'd be inclined to judge the drinkability higher. As it is, though, this is a very distinct and intriguing beer, one I'd certainly buy again. Very good."
"Maybe needed a bit more sour to balance the flavors a bit but this thing is like candy within the style, hard not to enjoy."
"Um. Wow. This is a funky, smelly, sticky sweet, deep as hell combo. It's good, almost undrinkable. Definitely worth a shot though, I'm going to polish this guy off."
"Had this out of a bottle at The Trappist in Oakland. Just want to compare this to other Flanders style red ale's I've had. This thing has only a very mild tartness to it. It is sugary sweet though. VERY sweet. Way too sweet. Excruciatingly sweet. Nice fruit quality but man is it backed by sugary sweetness. Very hard for me to drink."
"D: This tastes a bit too fruity and sweet to be a session beer but otherwise it's a great red ale, and a great all around beer."
"D: I would only want one of these ever so often because they are so delicious, I could easily get addicted."
"This one's a little sharp, but would pair well with cigars and conversation."
"date coded ??-07-09, pours a deep a copper-brown w/ a fluffy off-white head which dissipates a bit quickly leaving a decent lacing behind in my snifter ; an interesting smell, a sourdough bread aroma at first, backed by apple and caramels with a cider vinegar note ; a sweet, tart, vinous flavor, tastes fruity and somewhat metallic , some cereal grain and a bit of toffee and darker fruit midway, but subtle, almost reminds me of wine or champagne, a very faint bit of herbal hop and wood present as well ; a light-med body, a funny feel, tho, i think it's pretty dry in the mouth, yet has a sweet taste, a good amount of co2 makes it almost thick ; an interesting brew, my first flanders, so have no comparison, but def. drinkable..."
"Overall a decent beer but a bit too sweet/tart/fruity for me."
"D - Very drinkable with a nice interplay between the sweet and sour flavors. Not too complex, but very satisfying."
"This comes out of the tap a beautiful opaque chocolate brown, very appetizing. Strong aroma is more like a hard apple cider than a beer. Flavor is mouth-filling and pleasing; apple taste dominates, and there is a hint of hop bitterness. Finish is very smooth and cider-like."
"Reminds me of the one Oud Bruin I've had: too sweet and very peculiar. I had a Flanders Red at a homebrew competition and it was twice as tart and not half as sweet. I liked it a lot. This one is just borderline undrinkable to me. I suppose my palate is too young for the likes of Flanders."
"If you like sour beers that aren't too sour, but that are more sweet, then you'll like this one. For me, it was a joy to try this one on-tap and I can't see why not why this wouldn't be a joy to try if it came from a bottle. I would love to give this beer another go!"
"D: The most drinkable example of this style I have had so far. At 6% why not?"
"D- Flavors are very complex, but not confusing. That along with tehe body makes this pretty darn drinkable... If you plug your nose."
"Poured into a snifter glass and received a two-finger head that died quickly on top of a dark brown with purple tints (think brown grapefruit juice) body. Some caramel and citric notes like grapefruit and pear, along with a light malt presence and oak (sort of reminded me a cab sauv) in the smell. An excellent tart citrus taste, like cherries (and oranges; acidicness), mixed w/ caramel and chocolate malt and oak. A medium to full body that goes down smooth with a wine-like aftertaste (a tad sour) and carbonation. Good fruitiness in there (sort of reminded me of a Belgian triple, and this is a Belgian afterall), but maybe a little too sour/fruity for a complete sessioning, but this is one damn good beer that you must try if you haven't already."
"Pours a deep mahogany red with a shallow foamy light tan head that resists fading. A good amount of lacing observed. The smell is a tart dry berries sensation, cherries maybe. Substantially effervescent with a tangy tartness, the mouth feel is medium bodied. Full flavored cherry explosion finishes somewhat on the dry side. A wonderful cherry aftertaste lingers appropriately. A very easy drinker. The 6.2% ABV is integrated well. I've been eying this one for a while. Highly recommend giving it a try."
"Light bodied and very lively without being sharp, kind of a thick blanket of effervescence. Like a vacation I don't want to leave, I'll come back again and again."
"I like this beer a lot but I wouldn't rate it as highly as the Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"This was a very drinkable beer, yet it doesn't come cheap. It also seem to have a much higher ABV than advertised. Overall I will most certainly revisit this one again, yet save it for special occasions as it's priced a bit too dear for daily consumption."
"Don't drink and review."
"Very interesting beer that is worht a try. I would drink it again"
"Very much enjoyed the Duchesse. Very well balanced; the flavors flow together seemlessly. Definitely the best Flanders Red I've tried, though they've been few."
"Mouthfeel didn't float my boat, I think it may have gone a bit flat. Will have to try another."
"D - one of the more drinkable flanders reds i have had. this one is really good."
"Pours a clear brown with a reddish hue. Flavor is sour. Hoooie! I love it. Kind of an antiseptic edge to it. But it's nice and smooth. Feel has a fairly biting carbonation that hits quickly and leaves. Liquid is kind of sticky yet smooth. This is a pretty good example of this style. If you aren't ready for the sour, don't bother coming at all for this one."
"D - To be sipped and savored glass after glass... WOW!"
"Pours dark reddish brown with a frothy tan head. Aroma a combination of sweet and sour cherries. Very sweet up front, flowing into a mild sour and finishing smooth with a slight vineous tartness. Med-low carbonation. Medium mouthfeel. Good beer, bit would like to see more sweet/sour balance. A little heavy on the sweet side."
"Overall: This is really the 3rd beer of this style that I have tried and the first 2 were both rodenbach. Such an amazing style and i truly like this beer quite a bit. But for the price tag... I'll stick with rodenbach"
"I had this beer both in a bottle and on tap and I truly feel that it is a better beer on tap. It pours a nice ruby red with a one finger tan head. It has a big sour cherry smell with spices and lactic aromas pulling through. The taste was almost the same. Big sour cherry flavor mixed with some lactic acids, but the alcohol flavor was hidden by the sour flavor. The mouthfeel was thick and full and it was very easy to drink."
"This is a delicious beer. Nice sour cherry aroma with a little bit of yeast and horse blanket. A lovely reddish brown color. The taste is wonderfully balanced - a little sweet up front, but it dries nicely. I get lots of fruit and yeast in the flavor, but not the tomato undertones that some people report. Overall, a more approachable sour red than Rodenbach, which I also like. I'm glad that I bought a four pack."
"Pours clear burgundy with a fluffy pale head that leaves lacing down the sides of my tulip glass. Smell is like a mild raspberry vinegar that kicks my salivary glands into action. The taste is something else; if you don't like sour beers, this won't convert you, but it starts with a sharp fruit kick like dried apricots, giving way to a sweet malt flavor that immediately opens up into a mouthwatering sourness that lasts. It's nice and smooth, and I could drink this all night."
"wait what... i had to stop to write about the taste first, holy wierd. its like grape juice and a belgian ale got together and made a beer, i'm completely confused by the taste. its incredibly sweet, like a strong grape juice, is this even beer? maybe a barley wine, i' dont even know whats going on. it looks beautiful, has a deep dark purplish hue to it, smell is fruity, but not nearly as potent as the taste. its a good beer, if it is beer. i dont think i've ever had anything remotely like this, so dont take this review as worth anything."
"This is raw and rustic and very good; can't seem to get ideal serving temperature right. Good to sip for special occassion."
"The second glass paired well with some Dubliner cheese."
"Dark, deep reddish brown pour that lets some light through. Smell is kind of a funky, sour cherry and wine like aroma without a strong offputting vinegar scent. Gooey band-aid-y aroma that I don't care for, though. If that were in a regular beer it would be called infected. If it's in a Sour Ale, its pleasant?? Flavor is sweeter and less sour than expected. Fairly sweet up front, but finishing dry with a bubbly champagne like body and flavors that are reminiscent of cherry, grape and cranberries. A bit hard to describe as its only my 1st or 2nd sour ale. All in all, not a bad experience and a unique beer that is like a funky fruit soda. I would have to get used to that odd smell though, to really enjoy this beer again."
"I would not recommend mixing this beer with lots of random other styles, but I would certainly drink it again."
"Poured a darker scarlet amber/mahogany, with light head. Aroma was of cherry, raspberry, spice, and vinegar. Palate was a mix of cherry, apple, and spice, like an applesauce with a cherry twist and some cinnamon. A little on the sweet side, but decent, and a pleasant drink."
"Mouthfeel- Tasty roasted malty brown flavors. the sour flavor is superb and it is a little more than subtle without being overbearing. First time ever getting a very unique Belgian such as this fresh on tap. This one is just about quaffable, not too heavy. Very nice!"
"Very unique and complex beer. If you like this style, also try the Flemish Red from Rodenbach."
"Not bad by any means you just have to remember what this beer is trying to be not what you expect it to be. Appearance dark brown but the head left a bit two quick for my taste. Smell was vinager and some oak. Taste very winey and sour with hints of vannila and oak. Mouthfeel was mediem body and low carbonation. Drinkability not bad a decent thirst quencher."
"I didn't particularly care for this one. It had much to pungent a taste to go down well Like I said, it almost wasn't like a beer at all."
"The current score is indicative of my opinion at the second tasting (December 2nd 2008)"
"Pours a brownish ale with a thick head and lots of bubbles. Heavy retention and it all clings to the glass. Sour cherries and sugar are present in the nose. A nice sour cherry twang at the start then mellows out at the end. There is also a great berry aftertaste which I think is rare for a flemish ale. Overall very smooth and well worth the price. I recommend this to anyone who hasnt tried this style before!"
"The duchesse pours out a deep brown with a reddish tone showing in the light. Small 1 finger head, short retention. Head leaves lacing around top of glass. Smells like a bubbly Lambrusco wine, some sour cherry,slight alcoholic-red grape tones, again like a tart red wine. Mouthfeel is very lively and carbonated, trat finish yet slight more chewy and creamy than other Ive had. Cherries,sour yeasts,woody flavors. Leaves a tart lasting finish on the tongue. This beer is everything that is good in a Flanders red. Thank you Duchesse, will buy again definatley."
"This is quite an interesting beer. I've heard you either love it or hate it. Well, I am somewhat in the middle of the road. While the taste was pretty good, I think I would start to grow tired of it after a glass. Nevertheless, still a good choice if you want a more obscure style."
"Beer oours a dark reddish brown color with two fingers of light tan head that receed fairly quick. Aroma is vinegary and slightly sour. Taste is fairly sweet for a Flanders. A slight tartness and slight vinegar taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is fair."
"Drinkability: Go get one. Now."
"Poured a dark brown color, with a reddish tone. Smell was of plums, cherries, pine, maple syrup, and something like candied ginger. Taste was most excellent, with all of the flavors mentioned before and a definite sour to sweet finish. The beer was nice and thick too, with a good amount of carbonation. Would definitely recommend this beer, a must-try!"
"This is definitly not your typical brew, especially for here in the states. It's true to the Flander's style in many ways, but also adds a lot of interesting characteristics."
"An excellent beer. Recommended."
"Really one of the most unusual beers I've had. Takes a few minutes to adjust to, but overall I am enjoying it! Quite an enjoyable surprise; well worth checking out! I'll have to get this again."
"The mouthfeel is an incredible lively, smooth and refreshing experience. I want more. I wish it wasn't quite so expensive, I could keep this constantly on hand. I would love one of these every single Friday after work. Very high drinkability, and an extreme enjoyability. I can't imagine much better for the style. Only the Rodenbach beers match it in my opinion."
"I highly recommend to fans of this beer to age some in a cool dark place for three years. I can't imagine that it could get better, so probably wise not to keep much longer."
"It's a good beer. I was in the mood for something tart or sour but this one was too sweet. Even though I was in the mood for a different type of beer I still feel that the sweetness hurts the drinkability of this beer."
"Beer with intense tawny color and not persistent foam. The scent has wine notes and after a persistent acidulous tone. In mouth you have a persistent acidulous tone and then you can feel a yielded tone. A little bit bitter for fight acidulous note. Not to drink alone."
"T/M/D: Crisp, tart fruits. Peeled cherries, lightly spiced, but sour through the end. Maybe a little more on the sweet than sour side, and something of a champagne like taste and mouthfeel in there. The puckering sensation leans more towards being lip-smacking than a cheek-sucked in sourness. An intriguing ale, and a style that I'd like to look into further."
"(Also, I should note, after reviewing this beer, I broke out some Saint Andre cheese with raspberry preserves and Brenton crackers, they all played together nicely.)"
"D - I've died and gone to sour beer heaven. I love this beer. I'm looking forward to trying other examples of this style to see what i'm missing. If this is not one of the better ones then I'm in for a real treat!"
"Finally got around to reviewing this classic of the style. Had a bottle at the Brick Store poured into the appropriate glassware. Poured red without much head or lacing, but still pretty to look at. Sweet and sour aromas of apples and cherries and a lightly acetic quality. The taste has that same sweet/sour combo as its main thread of flavor. Added to that are flavors of spiced cherries, a bit of oaky woodiness, and a developing creamy sweetness with a hint of bitter tannins right at the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and soft and a bit sweet. This is on the low side in the sour spectrum that this style encompasses. Very nice, if not quite as complex as some others. Still, relatively easy to find and a solid brew."
"D: A great beer. Very strong aromas and flavours, well crafted and quite easy to drink despite it's relatively high ABV. I could put a couple of these in a night, but I would rather sip it slowly to discover the many flavours hidden in this very fruit-forward ale. I highly recommend that everyone try this beer and I will definitely be buying this one again."
"Purchased an 11.2 oz bottle from Total Wine and More in Union, the first Flanders Red Ale I ever tried, and to be honest, I was pretty overwhelmed with the cloying, thick, rich, and ultra-sweet taste I encountered... nice ruby-red appearance with decent frothy head... smell is sharp and sweet, full of pine, sugars, and candy... taste is extremely rich and ultra dominating, very, very sweet with a strong apple-cider taste overpowering the beer... the smell is strongly alcoholic even though there is a modest 6.2% ABV... With such a strong and rich combination of flavors, this is definitely not a brew that I would want to down more than one of in a single setting... Copped this single sample for about $4.99... Very over-powering and strong... took it easy with this one... you will either love it or hate it..."
"D - It's very easy to drink, though I feel the sweetness could get in the way. This is well-done, but I prefer the sour, more-difficult Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"The bottle I poured had been aged for at least two years in my cellar. I can't really remember what it tasted like when I drank it when I first got my hands on a few bottles. I do not remember there being as many scents at the time though. Over all a very nice beer. Would lend itself very well to many different foods."
"d: Typical drinkability for style. I would drink a few if the sweetness didn't catch up to me. The sourness is more subdued than the other Flanders Ales I've tried. More sourness would help balance the sweetness."
"I was excited to give this style a shot. This is my first experience with the Flanders Red. Looked very nice on the pour with a deep copper body and a very minimal white head that dissipated quickly. The smell-lets say a tad sour. Reminded me of the fruity flavors and strong scent of balsamic vineagar. The taste was sour cherries! It just blasts you right up front and them dissipates. The Duchesse is well carbonated which accentuates the sour flavor up front then swallows fairly clean. The sour was too much for me. I felt like I was drinking vineagar. I only managed 4-5 sips and was done. There is a lot of flavor in there but the sour/vineagar flavor was so overwhelming it was hard to enjoy everything this beer has to offer. Everyone should give this a shot, but you may learn like me that this flavor does not suit your tastebuds."
"Looking forward to more like this."
"D- A solid embodiment of this style and perhaps one of the most popular that I've heard of, a very interesting ale that marries sour beer with a wine-like profile, this definitely makes me want to seek out more Flanders Reds in the future"
"This beer pours a beautiful deep brown with a reddish tint to it. The smell was pleasant with a sort of spiced cherry aroma coming through, however I was not very impressed with the carbonation which seemed to be low. The taste for me was pretty overwhelmingly sweet, no apparent sourness to better balance the flavors out. You can taste some of the roasted malts but other then that pretty bland with a cherry-banana sweetness coming through that makes it pretty hard to drink, definitely a sipping beer. Overall I didn't care for it much"
"However, if you enjoy very sweet beverages you might appreciate this beer."
"Its no La Folie, but nothing is."
"Very interesting ale, wish I could get more flander reds, oud bruns and lambics up here."
"Drinkability: I don't think I could do more than on of these at a time because of the intense sweetness of the beer. However, it's a great change of pace if you want something really out of the ordinary."
"I've had 2 other bottles of this one, but this one aged for a while... I have no idea if the cellaring helped, but I am appreciating this one more than previous notes signify.. I would buy this again and again if it were available in Boise... but after reviewing it, I would let most sit for a long while before capping another."
"M/D: Thin bodied, dry, effervescent, and smooth. The only fault is that the sharpness is best in small doses, reducing the drinkability to me."
"Definitely a keeper. ItÂ’s also not nearly as high in alcohol (about 6.2% ABV) as other Belgians, so it wonÂ’t knock you out for the rest of the evening."
"A nice drink, good slow after dinner beer. Worth a try."
"Duchesse de Bourgogne is a quality Flanders Red that's a pleasure to sip. As this beer warms the flavors really seem to grow and morph. Interesting complexities."
"I would strongly suggest this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, syrupy, sugary oak, and cherry flavors lingering."
"Got a glass of this at La Cav Du Vin last week. Served to me in a wine glass that said ""Duchesse"" on it in white letters.The beer was a nice dark red with a fairly thin tan head that didn't stick around long before settling to a thin surface layer. Left some decent lace. Has a very sweet tart smell of cherry as well as some citrus and maybe even a bit of grape. taste wise there is both some tart sweetness and sourness going on and perhaps some slight bitterness. Malt and the aforementioned fruit flavors are present. Interesting combination of flavors for a beer. I believe this is the first beer of this style that I have had and I certainly enjoyed it! Has a smooth and crisp, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Fairly easy to drink indeed. Many things about this beer reminded me of a good red wine. A very good beer here overall!"
"I found this Flanders a little to sweet and would like a drier finish. Other than that, a very drinkable brew. Very complex and well balanced."
"The head isn't much to look at, but wow, what a body. Beautiful, crystal clear ruby/mahogany in color. The smell is sweet and cherry-like, with a nice tartness at the end. The taste is a really nice balance of sweetness and tartness; not bitter, though. A really interesting beer. Nice, smooth carbonation and good drinkability. Not a quaffer, but it goes down nice and smooth."
"D = This is a very distinctive beer and I'll gladly drink this again."
"Like most beers of this style, I like to describe them as sparkling pinot noir. However, This one is different. It pours a dark garnet color, with a thick head consisting of rather large bubbles. On the nose is a hint of spice, with a scent of blackcurrant. Beginning with a sour flavor of raspberry and cranberry, it is followed by a sweet finish of plum, currant, and brown sugar. The beer is medium-to-full bodied, and is not something that will fill you up before or after a meal. Because of it's acidity, I would serve this beer with fresh fruit or a salad. It would go great with pork tenderloin as well... For those looking to explore into a realm of something truly different, I highly reccomend this fine product."
"This is quite an interesting beer. It pours a deep reddish brown with a dense white creamy head. The aroma is all sourness: lactobacillus, brettanomyces, and a hint of oak. The immediate flavor is sour, then it finishes sweet leaving a sweet & sour taste in your mouth. The aftertaste lingers for a while as well. This is a beer that you learn to like--after having a gueze, this one tastes wonderful. Great beer, but don't drink it until you've had other sour beers to compare it too, and you develop your palate."
"I was looking forward to this beer, and was very disapointed in it. I had a large bottle of this beer and was not pleased. I thought I would enjoy this beer with turkey stew, but am glad I did not drink this with it. Instead I drank it over a disappointing loss by the Longhorns vs. the Aggies, I shared this with about 4 other people, and we all came to the same conclusion. This beer tastes like someone poured a beer into a bottle of red wine, mind you they are all wine drinkers, except me."
"Au QuÃ©bec il n'y a plus de rodenbach a dÃ©faut on se jette sur la Duchesse de Bourgogne."
"Pours dark reddish brown with thick off-white to tan head that thins quickly and leaves a nice lace. The aroma is lightly sour with definite sweet cherry influence and a hint of fermented grapes, like port. The taste is complex with sweet cherry, port-like initial flavor with a tart aftertaste that is at once pleasant and strong flavored. Medium to full bodied with active carbonation. This is a very interesting dessert beer that goes very well with chocolate and cherries."
"Overall, this is a fine Flanders beer. Looks fantastic. Maybe not as seemless as a Rodenbach, but still very good."
"Outstanding."
"I found it to be eminently drinkable which I set out to prove by finishing 2 of the 750 ml bottles over a 4 hours period. Was saddened once it was gone. I will be stocking up on this for the upcoming holidays!"
"Drinkability: 2.5 I could drink this beer fast because it is so sweet, but it wouldn't make for that enjoyable og an expriece."
"Much darker than I would have expected, kind of mysterious looking with about a finger of creamy tan head that retains well and leaves some lacing. The smell is dark ripe fruits and some bread/biscuits as well. The taste is extremely complex with the aforementioned fruitness upfront followed by a tart sourness behind. Mouthfeel was a bit heavy for the style i think and a lighter body and a bit more carbonation would have made this a bit more drinkable. I finished the lions share of this bottle and my mouth was pretty worn out by the end. An amazing beer to sip and be awed by, highly recommended and unusual."
"Excellent beer; I'm glad it finally made it into the Texas market."
"Served slightly chilled in a goblet, from a growler supplied by magget. Poured a deep brown with bright ruby highlights. About a finger of thin off white head topped the beer. Head actually lasted longer than I had thought it would, and left a thin coating of lace on the glass. Aromas of sour cherries, plum, yeast, with a nice malty note to it. Taste was pretty much the same. Tons of tart cherry, a nice bready yeast flavor, some dark fruits with a nice woody character to it. Tart enough to make you pucker but not overbearing. A nice well balanced Flanders Red Ale. Had a wonderful full bodied mouthfeel. Quite tart but very drinkable."
"i enjoyed this beer, was suprised, and would have it again. extremely good suprise"
"Duchesse De Bourgogne is an amazing beer. If you're looking for something unique and superbly crafted, do yourself the favor and give this a try."
"It also paired very well with some dark chocolates with ginger inside."
"i really love this one. nice reddish brown color with an off white head that shrinks down but never goes away. nice lace as well. smells of some fruit like plum, raspberry, cherry and vinegar as well. also some sweet sugary smell. tastes like a mix of all three fruits with a raw sugary sweetness and has an incredible sour kick. not too sour, just remarkable in my opinion. mouthfeel is soft and silky with a great carbonation that gives the drink some legs as it goes down. a real pleasure of a drink."
"Into a snifter it goes, and it's a lighter brown with red mixed in. This is a very intersting smell, one I haven't encountered yet because of the limited Belgian beers I've sampled. Smells of wine vinigrette and sourness. I'm afraid to go on any farther...no I'm not! This is really interesting, very fruity, and not esters, it's really sweet. A little sourness is mixed in, which seems to be the way the beer balances out the sweet flavor. The aftertaste is quite dry with bready malts. I enjoyed it more the farther I got along with it. Not too cloying and not overpowering. And really different from your everyday beer."
"The fizziness, the nicely balanced sour tanginess and bitterness, all are just barely enough to keep the heavy fruity sweetness in check, but for me there is a cloying aspect that knocks the drinkability down a notch. Still it is an interesting, unusual and delicious beer. Would work really well with frites and mayo, welsh rarebit, or a nice braised pork or lamb shank."
"D: A welcome addition to the roster of Belgians I've tried. While similar in style to other beers that I've had the good fortune to sample, this one stands out and offers up a full plate of sour cherry goodness."
"Duchesse De Bourgogne pours a deep ruby red with a thin but lasting off white head. The aroma is sweet dark fruits, vinous and almost champagne like with some smooth spicy oak. The taste is sharp and tart at first, rounded off by a fruity sweetness with hints of berries and chocolate. It finishes with a light smooth oaky flavor, nicely balanced. Creamy and smooth, this beer is really delicious. It's a little on the sweet side, but that only detracts slightly from its drinkability."
"Quite possibly the best Flanders Red I have ever had. Pours up a nice brick red colour with a gorgeous off-white head that lasts for ages. Smell is sour fruit and wet wood, but nothing is too assertive. So often in this style the whole sourness thing is way over done, both in the aroma and the taste, as well. Taste is right where I feel it needs to be for the style. Again, sour fruit, some sweetness, and a bit of woodiness, but nothing is over done or too assertive. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy to drink. This is simply a very solid representation of the style, and certainly one to seek out if one is interested in trying this style. Fantastic!"
"Drinkability: Very high. This is my favorite of the Belgians I have sampled so far. Very good sweet and spicy flavor, very smooth, and low alcohol content make this a great brew. Highly recommended."
"Could not drink much of this at all, 12 ounces would probably be the limit"
"Root beer appearance; opaque with garnet as transmitted color. White wine aroma. 4 months after 'best by' date, but let's be honest, that shouldn't matter much here. Apple cider vinegar taste. Sweet/sour dry grapes. No head retension; thick rings which slid back into brew. Bubbles spaced very far apart. Tried this warmer than normal. Thin Mouthfeel. No bloating, which is unique to this style for me. Resinous palate. Oaky with tart cherry undertones. Almost cloyingly sweet. Drinkable though."
"This is a pretty good Flanders Red, especially if you like the vinegar aspect tempered with sugar...you're in major luck! The sweetness really sets this one apart in the love-or-hate category."
"Drinkability: The quintessential Flanders Red; I could sip on it for hours"
"Drinkability: Superb. I think I could have easily finished the whole 750 by myself and enjoyed it thoroughly. This certainly isn't as cloying as other Flanders Reds I've had and could possibly be considered the staple."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, itÂ’s not the type a beer that I could drink consistently, but itÂ’s a good to drink casually if you like the sourness."
"This beer is almost like a lambic with its fruity tart flavor. However, the tartness is not nearly as harsh. It's well balanced with all the sweet flavors. The best way to describe it is to eat a sweet tart and wash it down with a glass of Welch's grape juice. Sounds weird, but really it's quite tasty."
"Softer and with brighter citrus and cherry flavors as compared to bottled versions I have had."
"Mouth: Juicy, sour tasting immediately upon entering but sweetens as it moves back, grapes, raisins, plums. Some grain, a resinous aftertaste. Vinous, lingering juiciness. Nice malt body. Caramel, toffee. Mouth feel is sharp tingling carbonation that gets creamier as it moves back, smooth swallow. Is both rich and dry in the finish. Easy drinking. Loooove it!"
"Draught @ Eulogy: This one pours a very dark, ruby red color. There was almost no head or lacing on mine. Nice sour aroma. Hints of cherries to it. The taste is quite good. It has a mainly sour malty taste, with some residual sweetness. Sour cherries and apples are prevalent, but not overpowering. Very Good!"
"drinkability is not very good due to the overly sweet nature of the brew. the bite from the carbonation and alcohol makes drinking it resemble a can of grape soda."
"Sour cherries carried over into the taste, along with yeast and a woody flavour. The finish was slightly dry, with some tannic flavours. Medium-bodied, with average carbonation."
"It has certain unique characters, however, it doesn't stand out as anything above average for the style, IMO. Too much like grape soda for me."
"Cheers."
"D- Pretty rich, but very worthwhile. An interesting beer that I am glad that I tried."
"Much more drinkable than I had anticipated, and from previous samples. Have to be in the right mood for it, and expecting what the style has to offer to truly appreciate it. I'm not the biggest fan of this style, but I know a good thing when I taste it."
"Pours ruby, with a forced 2 inch head which actually sticks around for a bit despite the implied acidity. The aroma initially reminds me of vinegar. There's cherries and other fruits in there too, but I'm mostly getting vinegar. I'm expecting a very sour and funky brew. But the first thing I notice is how sweet it is. I'm disappointed with this discovery until I realize just how clean that sweetness is, and how well balanced it is with the rest of the characteristics of this fine brew. Seems like new flavors expose themselves with every movement of the tongue. This is one of the most complex beers I've tried. I can't pick it apart. I have no idea what it is that's contributing to this dynamic flavor profile. Incredibly balanced, incredibly flavorful, but at the same time, the exceptionally clean finish makes for a highly quaffable brew. This is the sweetest beer that I actually liked. An eye opener."
"Medium bodied, almost syrupy. But that could be because of the sweetness. Highly carbonated. Very drinkable for being a sourish beer. Other flanders reds and can kind of take their toll on you after a half-glass or so while this one remains exciting."
"Pours brownish-red with a small caramel-colored head. Smells slightly fruity - I pick up a cherry scent, similar to a lambic. The cherry flavor comes in strong at first, but it mellows into a nice sweetness and finishes slightly sour. The carbonation is light but refreshing. The sweet and sour taste, along with the carbonation and the noticeable but not overbearing alcohol flavor work together to make this a refreshing, flavorful, very drinkable beer."
"This beer was very exciting to me because it was one of those beers that just tasted different from everything I'd had before. A nice red color (more red than amber) with a curious nose. This beer tastes like candy! Potent sourness, but with more than enough sweetness to round it out. A very interesting beer and an interesting style. Seems like it would make a good dessert beer."
"-Oelergud"
"D: It is very easy to drink as it is packed with flavor and feels nice in the mouth. You will not get tired drinking it, you just might have to spit from time to time."
"This is my first beer of this style. This is a very fruity beer that has a dry aroma of fermented fruit. This beer was a recommended way of getting into Lambics. This is one of the most complex beers I have had in a while. It is definitely better as it warms through around 45 F. I was surprised by the complex mouthfeel. This is about as drinkable as wine in my opinion."
"I'm not very familar with this style since I've ever had one of these on draft. However, I certainly will try as many of this style after having this one. This was really a spectacular beer. I can't say I would've appreciated this several years ago. Very sour aroma - duh! A little bit of vinegar, cherry, raspberry, and oak. Kind of hard to describe as the sour is so predominant. Taste is really huge. Incredible levels of tartness. Nice frothy head and a light ruby color. Great mouthfeel - very lively. I can't wait to pop open one of these at the next neighborhood party and offer this to someone."
"This brew pours a dark clear ruby red color. The head is massive, and recedes very slowly leaving thick foam all over the glass. The aroma is of tart cherries with a nice refreshing acidity. The taste is more intense than the aroma. It is almost wine like. Cherries are the main element, and are accentuated by the combination of a thorough tartness, and a strong acidity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. I cannot imagine how the mouthfeel of this beer could be improved in any way. Overall, this is one of the better Flemish Red Ales I have had. It is not as powerful as Panil, but it has more finesse and that counts for a lot."
"Given to me as a sample...now I have to buy more. Pours a reddish brown with light pale brown head one finger thick then fades to a nice lacing. Smell is sweet and highly expressive ... it begs to be inhaled. Melon, cherry, apple, oak, alcohol, and oh soo much more. Mouthfeel is smooth with little to no carbonation ""pop"" on the tongue and a nice dry finish. Taste is excelently rounded and full of flavor. Cherry, raspberry, red wine, slight raw oak note. No bitterness or spice but wonderful array of sweet tartness that tantalizes the tongue. I think I gave some of my first fives."
"Not bad for a sweeter Flanders red, but I greatly prefer this style more dry and sour."
"I had this beer in my pantry 6 months before trying it after my initial taste and this time around it was much smoother and more pleasant to drink. A refreshing beer perfect for a late summer-night."
"I poured this beautiful lady into a snifter. It was dark brown with ruby red tints at the edges. The head was a decent 2cm and had some staying power. The head also coated the sides of the glass as I swirled it, nice. The aroma was a little sweet and a little funky. The taste was jaw-dropping! I actually thought ""wow"" as I tasted it. Funky, slightly sour, some tartness, some fruit, lots going on.It really seemed to blossom in my mouth. It tasted like a sour jolly Rancher and also a little like wine. I drank some Jolly Pumpkin beers a week or so ago and it looks like this is what they were shooting for. I really liked this beer and am starting to learn to appreciate some Belgian beers."
"D - This is a very good beer. It's the first Flanders Red Ale that I've tried and I really liked it."
"Overall: OK, IÂ’m not a huge fan of Flanders ales or lambics, but this one is understated enough to make me try more of the style. I consumed this sample a full year before the end of the Â“best byÂ” date on the cork: I wonder what a bit of cellaring would yield. Grab one of these if you have a chance, definitely recommended."
"I need more!"
"drinkability is good. not too acidic or vingary. nicely balanced. alcohol is completely hidden. really interesting and enjoyable beer."
"A light mildly carbonated mouthfeel. This may possibly be my favorite beer. Not the most drinkable though. With such an intese flavor it may be hard to drink two of these back to back. But no matter, this is an amzing beer."
"Overall- A beer that went exceptional well with my salty fries."
"On tap at ZenoÂ’s in State College. Ruddy amber with a very small, off-white, foamy head. Vinous, medicinal, sweet smell with alcohol and tawny port-like aromas. Tastes is of sour fruit (most notably cherry) over a light malt backbone. It has a medium body and a slick texture. Flanders arenÂ’t my thing, but going by style this one was pretty damn good! Definitely worth a try."
"Best before 29/4/07.. I think I'll live. Pours reddish with brown edges and little head to speak of. Excellent clarity. Balsamic vinegar stands out backed up by sour cherries, sugar, wood, and roasty malts. Taste is upfront fermented cherries with a nice hit of sugar and tartness. Finishes oaky (guessing French Oak because of the name Bourgogne). Tiny bit of butter in the finish with slightly roasted malts. Light bodied and fantastically carbonated. I was afraid it would get too sweet but it's holding up nicely. Would love to try this fresh. IS THIS A FLANDERS RED???"
"Drinkability - Well, considering I'm on my second one, I think I've answered the question regarding drinability. This is one of my favorate Flanders Red Ales, passed only by a Vichtenaar. I cannot wait to purchase more which thankfully is now allowed in my state. I find this beer a overall complex and well staged representation of what a Flanders Red Ale should be. Now, pairing this with mussels and surrounding myself with the rustic feel of Monk's Cafe' in Phili would be my only change. Please pass another."
"D: It's and easy drinking beer, one that would pair well with food. Definitely one of the more unique beers that I've ever had. A testament to the range and complexity that beers can achieve."
"good drinkability, left you wanting more, the low carbonation really made it feel like you were drinking wine."
"750 ml expiration date June 2008 Dark brown beer, with garnet acents, nice sized tan head Aroma, sour, cherries, apple cider vinegar, soor plooms, Fruity, juicy flavours with a cutting wine like sourness, some vinegar, a little ""funk", very different and very intresting stuff. Nice on the palate, quite carbonated,but works well with the flavours. Very nice drink, easy for me to drink, though i can see were many would totally dissaprove!"
"O'all/drinkability - A beautiful looking, beautiful tasting beverage. Lovely mnelding of fruity sweetness and aged beer sourness, with tremendous balance. Given the price (think my 11.2 oz bottle was about $4) and nature of the brew, not one that will be a pounding session beer, but highly drinkable for a sour (in my view)."
"986"
"Overall, this beer is a little sweet for my tastes so that detracts from the drinkability, but the distinct flavor and intriguing aroma are qualities that are hard to ignore. Not an everyday beer, but definitely one to try from time to time."
"D: Definitely a good beer, robust flavor with a substantial depth to it. I will definitely be drinking this more often."
"Chewy mouthfeel with almost divine carbonation tickling the tongue. It is a well attenuated beer with great balance making it very drinkable, however I could only drink one. Very interesting; I have had nothing like this beer before. Some might be turned off by the sourness but I love it."
"Unbelievable complexity. I had no idea what the ABV was, but I was sure of two things: I could drink this all night, and if I did, I wouldnÂ’t make it to work the next day. Tart & tannic, the Burgundy Duchess took me on a rollercoaster of taste starring sweet and sour red fruit. I donÂ’t know what else exactly, but there was an earthiness and a floral element to boot. Again, I was blown away. A dry finish to what could have been a pucker-inducing glass, as well as an alcohol content masked by the sourness, only add to its high marks. Not something I would drink every night (or would I?), but an amazing treat for when IÂ’ve been good."
"A pleasingly tasty and smooth beer, good for meals/cheese pairings (gruyere in this instance), sessions, etc. Hearty enough to enjoy in cold months, and refreshing enough to be pleasing in summer months. Excellent change-of-pace choice, and good for sharing. Highly recommended."
"A good one to try and have on rare occasions."
"Nice dark brown color with surprisingly light colored head. At first whiff it reminded me of very expensive balsamic vinegar and strong cider without the spice. My first taste was taken slow and a small amount because I figured this sour brown was gonna do a number on my palate. Much to my surprise The sourness did not trash my mouth as New Belgium's La Folie did the first time. A little more acid then most but flavors of apple cider, balsamic vinegar, sweet dried fruits, with tart finish on the backsides of the tongue. Better to be enjoyed out of the 4 pack if drinking alone or shared with a friend if enjoying a 750 ml."
"Poured into a tulip glass at Pizzeria Paradiso in Georgetown, Washington, DC. This brew left very sticky, lasting lacing, despite having only a thin ring of bubbles comprising its head. The bubbles were light tan, and the body was a translucent ruby-brown. The nose was led by grapes, then cherries, a touch of vinegar, and pepper. Very nice! The taste wsa quite similar, and pretty dry, and quality overall, but with a bit too much acidity. The body was medium-light, with also a light but tingly carbonation. A bit harsh, but still enjoyable."
"Medium-bottled, fairly highly carbonated, smooth. A very good beer, very complex and yet well balanced."
"delicious sour red from the Flanders region of Belgium. The sweet and sour creates a delicious feel on the tounge and goes down smoothly. Hop bitterness is minimal if at all with the sour shining through. A classic example of the Flanders style and worth looking out for."
"My first experience in the flemish art of brewing- new and exciting. Brew poured a deep dark mahogany, with a slighlty effervescent head. Aromas were strong on malts- sweet molasses, somewhat yeasty finish with an almost vine-like quality. Taste was big- my mouth puckered as the big sweetness was replaced by dry sourness. A combination of dried raisens, cherries and aged balsamic. Tingling carbonation allowed the earthy woodiness to come through and beat down the sourness somewhat. Heavy bodied in my opinion, it had the qualities of a good port with a sour kick. I had to sip this one, as my palate was overwhelmed. A must-try, but i expect it would take a more refined palate to make this one a go to brew."
"Drinkability - Fairly easy drinking, although a little to sweet for much more than one glass. More carbonaiton would help here."
"Appeared dark amber with a strong, smooth frothy one-finger head that shrank but never totally dissipated during the duration of the taste. Smelled strongly of apples, sour cherry, some sweet dark fruit, and a little yeast. The taste centered on apples, pears and a little sour cherry- very strong on the sour apple flavor. A champagne-like effervescence filled the mouth until the very end. This beer is highly carbonated. Very good drinkability, a nice red sour-style and I would definitely drink a few if I had more."
"Oddly enough, I found the sometimes rotten service at FRTH to be exceptionally cordial and efficient. I was sitting at the bar, and was just finishing a Hercules DIPA (ON CASK!), and asked the guy to recommend something at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Hercules, and he gave me a 3-ounce sample of this, which motivated purchasing a 12 ounce glass. What a great beer!"
"Poured a deep dark brown, with lots of reddish hints to it, making it almost seem a dull burnt orange in bright light. A huge billowing white head faded quickly, but left a nice film of lace about the top for most of the glass. The smell was probably the strongest I have ever smelled in a beer. Almost knocked me over. Huge flavors of sour grapes and apples, lots of fruity hints in there, and very very strong, really like nothing I have ever smelled. The taste was unbelievably sour. Like sour candy sour, huge flavors, too much for me. Actually made my eyes water with every sip. Very light mouth feel, and great carbonation were nice, and helped it go down smoothly, but was not really my cup of tea. Flavors were big, grapes, apples, peaches, raisins, plums, very very complex and fruity. Overall I did not enjoy it, but I am not sure if this was due t o the style or this particular brew. I will have to try a couple more to get a better feel, but this one was rough on me. I could see how someone would like its deep complex character, just not me."
"D - Definitely a good beer, mild pleasant flavor with a substantial depth to it. Worth a try certainly. A good beer to convert those who dislike hops."
"Overall this is a different but very enjoyable brew. The tartness may be a turn off to some and may play into the drinkability of this brew. Some might get the taste buds burnt out but I think it is worth the try and well worth another bottle."
"Why ever drink any thing again after this beer. I love this beer I canÂ’t stop drinking it. I drink it in my Maudite Tulip glass...The color of Duchesse is a wonderfully dark red and it looks awesome behind the maudites winged devil...the head is around 2-3 fingers and a light tan color not real sticky but some nice lace. Smell is a sour smell but so much more...hard to explain I fine this beer very complex. Taste is sour and very drinkable no ALC. taste, being only 6%abv. This was expected. All in all if you are looking for something different to try, try a sour Flemish tonight and this is an awesome example of them."
"This brew has been sitting in the fridge for the last 6 months, as I feared of a potential similarity to Rodenbach Grand Cru. Different world..out-of-this world. First and foremost is the absence of clinical levels of acids which are present in Rodenbach. This brew is extraordinarily well balanced; slightly sour, slightly acidic and moderately sweet. The nose is a soft essence of wet wood with the perfect accompaniment of bret on the nose; wonderfully integrated. An impressive foamy tan head leading to massive lacing throughout the tasting. Sweet malts and candy sugars make for the perfect foil to the sour elements of this brew. This bottle was easily consumed with a meal of sweet & sour shrimp stir-fry, simply a perfect match! With its rich deep cinnamon color, beautiful balance and exceptional flavor profile, this is a surprisingly complex and delectable treat."
"Drinakbility: Well I definitely plan on having another of these and saving the last 2 for company at some point. I could see this going very well with a dessert."
"I have never tasted anything like this. Much more fruity and matured than the fruit Lambics, still it is very sour and chemical."
"330 mL brown bottle, best before 10/18/07. The Duchesse is a blend of 8 and 18 month old ales that have been aged in oak casks. It pours a lightly-sedimented mahogany that thins to amber near the bottom of the flute, and has medium to light carbonation that goes up to an inch of yellowish/brown head that leaves nice sheets of lacing. The aroma is sweet and sour, lactic?, with fruit (berries?), chocolate?, mild oak, iron, and maybe some green hops, all blended very nicely. It is a delicious beer, both sweet and tart, with a lactic or wild sourness, a mild bitterness, raspberry/blackberry, cherry?, chocolate?, and maybe some green/leafy hops, but is overall just a touch too sweet. The body is light to medium body, smooth, with a tannic dryness, and medium carbonation and finish. Overall very refreshing and quite drinkable - not too sour and fairly balanced. I could probably drink two or three in a row without too much trouble."
"Drinks all-right would pair well with many meats & fish & even salads. Just not a session ale, but one to ponder & savor by a fire or in a dimly Belgian pub. I prefer rodnebach's grand cru to this, this is a beer universe expander & well worth a try"
"Fairly thin mouthfeel, even carbonation keeps things lively. Drinkability is big if you can dig the style. A 750 is no problem in one sitting..."
"Drinkability: I find this to be an interesting beer, and not bad at all, just not something I ever want to drink again. It's far too strange for me."
"This beer is a pleasant suprise. Not a style of beer that I'm fond of but I am very fond of this particular beer and will be looking for some more."
"You've heard the term smooth as silk, and that is an accurate description of the mouthfeel here. No carbonation detectable at all, but somehow a thin film of lace clung to the glass with each sip. Alcohol does not assert itself. This beer was a perfect nightcap after a bottle of La Roja."
"Note part 2: I can't help it. It's a ""5" in the old taste category now. The more I drink it the more I love it. Simply amazing..."
"D: A very very nice beer; goes down very well. After I finished it I immediately craved another. I don't think I could ever get sick of this beer, just excellent. I recommend it to any true lover of beer."
"M&D - smooth and easy down, flavorful and mouth coating fruitiness make this a dangerous brew, a moderate ABV saves it from a ""one glass only and recork it"" doom, phew! what a marvelous beer though, masterfully crafted"
"Learning about the aging process was quite interesting. Some of the oak tannins made there appearance as the beer warmed. I found it to be enjoyable and quite drinkable. Some of its qualities reminded me of a homemade wine. This is a very unique and different beer that is not for everyone. But if you are looking to expand your beer tasting pallet make sure you include this one for a taste."
"Pours as a thick, reddish brown with white head and good carbonation. Aromas of sour, acidic cider with cherry and rasberry notes. Taste bursts of fresh grape juice and red wine vinegar with nice oak notes. I found the overall body to be very light and unassuming with less of an acidic kick than I was expecting. Nicely subtle and the dry finish makes for a good starter beer."
"Apples, apples, apples. This beer pours dark with a reddish tinge. For some reason, I thought it'd be lighter. As other people have said, it smells like apple cider vinegar, but not bad. I think it's pleasant. It tastes like fresh apples, like I picked them myself--more sour than sweet. It's not overly sour, though. In fact, I thought it would be more sour. I really like this--it's very refreshing."
"11.2oz brown bottle from Florian's. My first Flemish Red. Dark brownish-red body with ruby-red highlights and a half an inch of light tan head. Smells acidic (like vinegar) with hints of fruit. Tastes acidic and fruity, like a raspberry maybe? After a few sips, a yeasty character starts to show too. Medium-bodied. Not sure what to think of this one... I'm sure it's to style and great for what it is, but I just can't get past that vinegar-like quality, which hurts the taste, smell, and drinkability... Call me unsophisticated and inexperienced, and compared to some I may be, but I am just not a fan of this one, sorry. At least I only ot an 11.2oz."
"This one is not bad. I'd be interested in trying more flemish ales, but I can fully understand others' gripes with the style. I don't like to drink malted vinegar, but there's more to this one beyond the pungent aroma."
"D- could definitely have a few of these without getting sick of them, a very interesting style of ale, wish I could find more representations of this style"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I'm sad to see my glass empty."
"Mahogany red color and a fair sized tan head with good retention. The nose is pungent with notes of acidic tannin, alcoholic esters, sweet and tart plum, and oaky. Flavors are much more mellow than the nose leads to believe...mild dark cherries, oaky vanilla, maple syrup, apple, plum, white grapes, and bigger caramel notes as it warms. Mouthfeel is delicately smooth creaminess with some slight crisp fizz at the end. Now this is a flanders that I could drink more of, perfectly blended and all the flavors meld together so well."
"A very drinkable, incredibly rich and complex ale. Would love to be able to try and session with this. Stay away if sour, oaked brews arent your thing. If you love a tart apple pie with some vanilla ice cream on the side do whatebver it takes to find this gem!"
"A Belgian Flanders Red poured into a tall chalice. Presents itself a deep ruby brown with a thin pale tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving a fine lace in the glassware. Active carbonation bubbles are evident. The nose is, to me, much like a good gueuze albeit a bit more subdued. Tart, over ripe fruits, port, slight cider venegar notes, and a hint of spice. The palate is quite sour up front, causing the mouth to water instantaneously. The sourness quickly yields to a strong sweetness, delivering a taste of confectioner's sugar, cider venegar, cherries, and baker's yeast all at once. The sweetness diminishes again in the mouth after swollowing, reminding you of the sour beginnings. Really a complex play in the mouth. If you've not experienced a Gueuze or a Flanders Red before, this interplay may be a bit much for you. The brewers achieve this by blending both young and old (cask aged) ales to create these complex beers. Once you've aquired the taste for ""sour"" ales, however, you'll be hooked. The mouthfeel is medium, at best, and the finish is sweet mixed with sour, and lingers long. The feel would be a bit cloying were it not for the aggressive carbonation found here. Intentional ... I'd bet on it. A very good Flanders ale, and one I wish I could find again more readily. This one took a trip to Indianapolis recently to find. These ales are a challenge to some, and very well may not be for everyone ... but if you like a good Lambic, Gueuze or Flanders Red, this is one that will not only please you, but may well be the best exemplar of the style. Terrific."
"Not something I would buy again, but worth a try."
"An excellent, tasty beer which I'll keep buying and enjoying. Not for non-beer-geek friends, for sure, but an outstanding beer nevertheless."
"Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a short chalice. I bought this bottle because it was Belgian and I tend to like Belgians. I poured it and it looked like a nice BSDA with a deep brown-red color, tan head that stuck around, and a touch of carbonation. It smells buttery at first with a sweet smell I have never smelled before. Almost like banana and really young pears. I took a taste and it was not what I expected at all. A wild, tart, rich flood of apples, grapes, and walnuts (maybe from the oak). Until I looked at BA.com I didn't know I had stumbled into my first Flanders Red Ale. The mouthfeel was tart and dry, with sharp sticky-sweet notes. Very crisp and clean. I think I would have liked this more if I knew that it was a Flanders. I went into it expecting a deep, round, caramel taste. For now I think FRA's are a bit too tart for my taste as I am currently swinging from belgian darks to american IPA's. Too much for the time being, but maybe I'll return and buy a few in a few months."
"Poured into chalice at 50 degrees. Beer wa dark with a nice foamu head that tried to climb out of the bottle. I was excited. Nice bready smell and I was getting more excited. The I tasted it and the sourness made me gag. I'm not sure if there was something wrong with this brew or I'm just not into Flanders style ales and I infact poured it out. I will NOT purchase this again."
"11.2 oz bottle. Up front sourness followed by a orange, cherry aroma and some vinous qualities. Clear burgundy in color with a small off white head. Aggressive up front sourness, rounded with hint of sour cherries, sherry like, somewhat acidic and a little bitter orange peel. A little astringent for my tastes and the sweetness lingers on the back of the throat. Pretty good job of playing the sweet and sour contrast but seems a little rough around the edges. The aggressive sourness makes it a little one dimensional IMHO."
"EDIT: Come to think of it, reducing this in a pan on the stove could make an awesome sauce. In that context the vinegar-y flavors would be appetizing rather than offensive."
"Very dark red color, nice little red-tinged head. Smell - wow. Like a fine, aged balsamic vinegar. Sweet, darkly fruity at first, but with a vinegar bite after smelling it for a while. Taste - again, wow. Kinda grows on you after a while. It's both sweet and tart. Dried fruit, tannic, maybe a very dry grape juice. Mouthfeel is a little too slick for me, and while interesting, this just isn't very drinkable for me - not sure I'm even going to get through this one. Just too much for me right now, I guess."
"Poured out a dark reddish brown with a minimal head that drops quickly. The nose is sour, even vinegary. There are also some nice notes of fruit and mustiness. I pick up some faint spice and sweetness lingering as well. The taste uncovers the sweet and extremely fruity notes from the nose. The body is amazingly sour grape juice, with a subdued bitterness that really works. Totally different than the nose, a nice surprise. Medium bodied, with good carbonation. The finish is pretty dry, like white wine."
"Mouthfeel is a tad off. It seems a little flat and thin."
"The body is closer to mid then full, but a true Belgium delight. Yeasty undertones with a fruity center that really appeals to all flavors. There really is a powerful taste overall."
"This is one of those beers you take to your wine snob friends if you want to turn them into beer snobs. Lots going on, and I could drink it for days."
"Bottom line: Super smooth yet flavourful Flanders Red Ale. Do try it if you see it in a store near you!"
"OverAll: today was my 1 year day of joining BA, great beer to have as a reward. This is really great beer, and if you are scared of the whole wild beer sour tart pucker thing, no worries here. It is there but mild. I think some of the lady's might even love this one."
"Poured thick and dark redish brown body with a thick head. Tastes of sour grapes/cherries but sweet like that of good champagne with a sour tart finish the mouthfeel was that of thicker champagne decently carbonated flanders reds are an aquired taste not to my liking but i am trying to be as objective as possible an above average interpretation of this style"
"Drinkability: A 750 is too much of this, it will be a chore to finish. Mouthfeel is undercarbonated."
"Pretty drinkable, but I think I could only have one or two."
"It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world, Lola, and I mean that in a good way, in this case. It's like a snarky black cherry soda and all the better for it. Keep in mind that the earthiness and almost cloying aristocracy make it just moderately drinkable. Still, it's interesting, intense, and a nice departure for when you're craving some of Flanders' finest."
"The drinkablilty is average, it was hard for me to get into this beer. I was hoping for the taste to match the complexities first noted by the aroma. I would have liked it to be more sour also..."
"MY God what a ride!! This is a great beer for what it offers...a speeding roller coaster of complexity in its delivery...it may not be everyoneÂ’s cup of tea but until you have tried it consider yourself deprived."
"Holding the first sip in my mouth, all the tiny bubbles work with the sourness and cider vinegar to create something alive and explosive; alcohol warmth lets the feeling linger on. The initial sweetness seems to come from sour cherries, unripe plums, and apples, and the dichotomy is an interesting experience; the two extremes of sweet and sour not only coexist, but thrive. As the temperature rises, the sourness calms a bit and lets you explore it more in-depth. I could sip this all by its self, but it also went great beside a burger topped with a mound of gorgonzola."
"This is an unusual Belgian in that it doesn't have the typical flavors/aromas. Still, it is very good. Think heavy lambic with less tart."
"This is definately food beer. I would have a hard time drinking it without food to go with it. As of now I have an aged white cheddar that is aged with Guinness stout and it tastes pretty good together but since it reminds me so much of Balsamic I bet it would go better with some really good Parmesan. When I first tasted it someone said that it makes a killer salad dressing which I found pretty interesting. And I bet if you reduced it down to a glaze it would be killer with some grilled meat."
"Before even pouring it I could smell that slightly vinegary kombucha smell ( which I'm slowly growing to like). Pours dark coffee with deep red highlights. The head is small but pleasantly leaving lacing. With further inspection smells of Belgian yeast minor hops and mild sweet vinegar. Taste is complex, sweet, slightly fruity esters mixed with a tinge of bitterness. Sour cherries and the bottom of apple cider, nice bit of acidity, might be good for food. This is a really different ale than I'm used to the only other I've had at all similar was a gueze lambic, but I know this is a very different beer. I enjoyed this I might even buy others like this, but its something I will slowly learn to enjoy."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale, and I really like it alot, but I dont' think it's sessionable, not because of the abv, which is not really high, but rather, because of the taste. That is, this would be one to almost always enjoy with food, and not in a drinking session."
"More ""balanced"" than a true lambic, but just as interesting in terms of complexity and depth. Wow, I'm so glad I'm discovering this style of beer."
"D - I like this a lot. The major criticism is that the aroma and the taste seem a bit at odds at each other. Flavour is much mellower and fresher than indicated by the strong vinegary smell and mustiness."
"Yes, another ""add this to your bizarre list"" beer-- a specialty beer, which I can appreciate for its unique creativity, from an objective point of view. From a subjective point of view, this beer is too far afield from being ""beer"" that I can't see myself buying another bottle to sample-- especially at closer to $4US a bottle. Unless, however, I really want to startle someone."
"A definite winner."
"I think this may be as complex as any beer has a right to be...yet somehow everything seems balanced...with each sip I keep thinking...'yeah...nice'...'this works'."
"D: Oh dear Lord. This is wonderful stuff. At 6.2% abv, this isn't like an ordinary sipping beer, but you still do have to sip it. Odd. Very strong flavors, and a very sophisticated-feeling beer. It has vaulted to the top of my list of personal favorites."
"Wonderful sipping beer. I will revisit."
"This was my first Flemish Sour, and it really grew on me. Poured to darlk brown with hints of red, and a thick tan head that lasted for the whole drink and left excellent lacing. The aroma was very funky, reminded me of those old Paz Easter Egg Coloring kits where you drop a colored tablet in pure vinegar. I was afraid of what I would be drinking next. To my great surprise, the taste was excellent. It was sour fruit, and at first caught me off guard, but I quickly adapted. Finish was dry, sour and warming. I bought this in a 4pack, and was concerned that I may have over-bought. Now, I know I will be heading back for more."
"This poured a deep reddish-brown with a thin lacy head that quickly faded. The nose was dominated by a sour smell with hints of berries and maybe some oak. One of the best mouthfeels I have ever had in a beer. At the end it got a little thick and sticky from the sweetness but the tartness cleared it up nicely. Easily my favorite beer."
"D: Smooth introduction to the style!"
"This beer poured a deep brown with a light head. It had a tart smell that is weirdly reminiscent of worcesertshire. The smell is definitely unique. The taste is fruity and a bit sour. The mouthfeel is crisp with noticeable carbonation. This is an interesting beer that I would not necessarily consider highly drinkable for me."
"The head is not too dense and the lacing doesn't stick very well. The color is clear red/purple. The smell is sour with slight earthy tones and a slight plum or other sour fruit in the backround. Taste is metalic with some earthy tones. The taste is a bit bland like cardboard. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and a little harsh. I don't think I would have another one of these, maybe it's the style, however this glass wasn't great."
"A unique and different style, but a classic when you get used to it."
"D - great, great beer. Perfect balance of sweet and sour and bittnerness. One of the best sour Flanders ales I've ever had."
"Oak barrel aged and blended from young and old batches. This is a prince among ales Â– an absolute noble pedigree. And it drinks like fine wine."
"D - Very good. This is an excellent beer. The yeast in this thing do some really funky stuff."
"I enjoy this beer and would always be happy to drink one. Refreshing but too sweet. I wish this style was more widely available, I have only had 3 examples of this style and one was from Colorado."
"""Interesting"" is the word that seems to fit this beer best. It's the first really sour beer I've had, so comparison is tough, but I'll do my best. Pours an interesting garnet brown color, little head, fairly clear. Aroma is interesting: dark fruit and vinegar. Not particularly sweet in the nose, which is promising. Taste upholds that conclusion - not overly sweet. Every sip is puckering, but not to the point where it's not enjoyable. Lots of character: tart, fruit and wood, but nothing is too dominant. Mouthfeel is good, not syrupy at all. Carbonation seemed right. Drinkability is the tough part. I enjoyed it, but I'm glad I was splitting a bottle because I probably wouldn't have wanted to drink the rest of it on my own. Maybe it'll grow on me."
"Overall: An excellent Flanders Red. It's no La Folie, but it's very good nonetheless."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle, best before 24-08-07. Appearance is very nice, a dark brown/red color with a 2 finger head that persisted. Lots of lacing left on the glass as I drank the beer. Off to a good start. Smells sweet and fruity, interesting, sour apple and cherry mostly. Taste amplifies what I smelled, whew. Starts off sweet but quickly turned sour. I like sour fruit beers but this tasted exactly like apple cider vinegar to me. The vinegar taste overpowers and is what's left in the aftertaste. Does not have much of a beer taste. Mouthfeel is ok, perhaps too full bodied, carbonation is fairly high. I didn't find this overly drinkable, would not have more than one. I would not buy again. This is my first experience with this style, so perhaps this is what it's supposed to be like, but I can't get past the apple cider vinegar taste."
"Finish is very cola-syrup extract like in sweetness. Nice and appetizing for the next sip. Reminds me of those coca-cola ink pens from childhood, the ones with the fragrance in the ink."
"This is a beer that just plain works...not sure what it would be like fresh, I will have to find another bottle, but I am glad I took the risk grabbing this one, because it was quite the experience."
"An excellent Flanders Red which is a complex and powerful brew for fans of the style. It is not likely that this would be a good choice for a Flanders virgin."
"Had a chance to try this on tap recently at Ebenezer's Pub in Lovell, ME. Even better, more complex."
"D - Overall, this is a very complex and interesting brew. I would probably drink no more than two of these in a sitting, and likely switch to something lighter in character after the second. An excellent beer that I would definitely purchase again."
"IÂ’m just a sucker for this style, so I loved it. A little heavy feeling, but delicious!"
"Color is maroon with a ruby glow. Head is tall and light brown. Aroma starts with an initial blast of sour funkiness, which gives way to a sweet dark fruit smell. Interesting, but relatively weak. A sip starts with plenty of tartness. Soon, sweet dark fruit flavors take over until a sugary sweet finish. A slight edge of what I believe to be oak flavor is noted as well. A constant theme here is that of sweet and tart flavors volleying for my palate's attention. The overall flavor here is excellent, very complex and layered, making this beer almost too easy to drink. Highly recommended."
"As others have noted, as good as this beer is one is plenty and personally I would like a little less sugary sweetness."
"D: As much as I lked the smell/flavor sensations this beer offers, it's easy to stop at one. In fact, I could have stopped at half of one, though not because I didn't like it. A lovely, magical beer but enjoyable in small quantities, for me at least. I could see this beer as suitable for a digestif or apertif."
"Beautiful looking beer; deep mahogany, caramel highlights, thick taupe head. Aroma hints at much sourness underneath, along with green apples and some unrefined sugar. On the palate, surprisingly sweet, especially at first, with soft carbonation that holds the sourness at bay for a bit. In the mid-palate, the sourness comes out, but it's still attenuated by a significant malt presence. Bubblegum, jolly ranchers, and a hint of nickel in the finish. Considering the substantial sweetness here, the finish is unexpectedly dry. Overall, a good Flemish red, but not the best I've had -- I'm looking for something with a bit more dry sourness."
"As no change came with time, I thought this would be great with pork or with a spiced ham."
"This is definately a beer to pick up and try. Drink it with a few friends or they will never believe you."
"Drinkability: This is just so damn good, I could drink it all night."
"Cork exploded off the 750ml bottle without much effort. Poured a dark brownish red color with a nice creamy head. Smell is sour with vinegar and I can pick up a bit of the oak as well . Taste starts out quite smooth, then the tartness hits you and continues to build making way for a surpisingly clean and dry finish. Wow! Great Flanders Red Ale, however I do believe Rodenbach Grand Cru is far superior. A stellar brew nonetheless."
"This is a very drinkable beer for sour enthusiasts."
"I don't think I will be trying this again soon."
"Taste is fruity and complex with sour cherries, oak and a little citrus. The beer is fresh and has very little bitterness. Mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy, that make it taste like cherrie flavored lemonade or hard candy. The sourness is overruled by the sweetnes and I feel that this beer is somewhat artificial. Body is full which inhibits drinkability."
"Quite the interesting beer, and one that I had to try. I'm not sure I should be reviewing it given my inexperience with the style, but I decided, what the hell. It's actually quite good. It may take some getting used to, but this is potentially a style that I could get into. It's very different from classic American beers, though. Recommended, with reservations for newbies."
"Man I'm starting to like sour beers more and more..."
"The overall effect of this beer mellows as the bottle comes to an end, and one is enough for me during an evening. That one is a great one though, and this is a beer I foresee keeping around. My wife really likes this one too."
"Overall drinkability? Not bad. I've had better in the style, but solid. The metallic flavor has me thrown a bit...maybe a ""bad"" batch. I'd have another just to see."
"Overall - An excellent beer... Highly recommended... Probably not for everyone and i can see why it gets such a love / hate reaction - personally i think it's top notch..."
"The aroma smells of sour cherries with some alcohol and malt sweetness. It has a deep red color with a large tan head that lasts forever. The mouthfeel is slightly slick with some tartness and a little CO2 bite. The flavor is sweet, tart, fruity and delicious. The finish is still sweet but has some dryness to it. Other than this dryness I do not get much oak out of it. This is a good flanders red but I prefer them with more sourness and less sweetness. Everyone seems to be ga-ga over this one so here is a different opinion. It's good but very sweet."
"Flavor was more of the aroma but with a sweeter tinge. Bit cloying and sticky. Nice and mild sour-patch kids flavor. Definitely a very drinkable sour beer. Not puckering sour, but rather very flavorful sour. Full body but sticky. Really nice drinking beer."
"Cheers!"
"Get this beer if you like sour ales. I'd recommend it even if you think you don't like the style."
"Overall an utterly unique ale with many (in a good way) schizophrenic combinations of fresh and boisterous flavors. I'm still a little perplexed, but I do know I like it a lot. The sweetness is a little too much from what I was anticipating. But it's good to get your socks blown-off every once and a while! Fantastic beer."
"The flavor was very sweet and malty with a clear prune/plum flavor. Delicious. This is a heavy feeling beer, very filling, and better sipped. The beer is smooth and balanced as you drink."
"The sour notes in the aroma are strong enough to set up the sweetness of the beer as the dominant flavor for the first few sips then the interplay of the flavors starts up. Complex sweet and sour fruit, old wet oak, earth, leather... It has everything a beer with no definable hop character should have. The sweetness stood out more this time, probably because I drank it fully chilled. I typically drink it at about 60 degrees fahrenheit (or warmer) which balances it more to my taste. Try it at different temperatures, learn all about it. I've been drinking it for years and I'm still learning."
"A very light mouthfeel which I think helps enhance the flavor by not taking away from the sourness. It really leaves a juicy feeling in your mouth."
"This is extremely drinkable, very hard to not give into drinking this quickly. One sidepoint is that the one on tap seemed to be a bit more oaky and sour than the bottled version. Not sure on the dates of either."
"Elegance, as inherited through primogeniture and blue blood, has long passed. In its place is something we prefer to call class, which is related to archaic elegance but only remotely. Anybody can have class; the magnate in his vogue mansion or the cad in on the street. It isnÂ’t easy to learn it, and its impossible to purchase it, but class can be trained. Elegance, as the wealthy were expected to have in years past, is altogether unattainable, even for some of the rich. The first and most obvious requirement is to be ejected from the womb of a bourgeoisie, and preferably to have been fathered by one. After that, it was merely a game of chance against in-breeding and developed tyranny that sculpted the, quite literally, nouveuax rich into adulthood. History is replete with cases of royal albinos, trisomy 21, incompetence or just plain idiocy. Also, there are the benevolently raised children of the upper classes that accrue an unnatural concept of class warfare, who then exercise their power with excessive enthusiasm. Let us take the few remaining cases of the beautiful, the wise and the kind regal individuals. The ones coursing with blue blood and compassion, and the ones imprinted in fairy tales and a few justly optimistic histories are those we speak of with an elegance no longer found today, save for a few obscure descendants living on vestigial fortunes. But IÂ’ve found one, remarkably gentle but rich, formal but enjoyable, sweet but mature. The Duchess de Bourgogne, though fictional, is a blurry depiction of some royal lady whose personality doubtlessly charmed her family and subjects alike. She is the altruist from above, showering the ground with coins and flowers from her ivory tower. All IÂ’ve done is told a story, one that I think is nicely summarized in the Duchess de Bourgogne beer. The crepuscular and mellowed tone of the beer nuzzles against the glass below the margaritaceous crown of foam, baring nothing to the unobservant eye. ItÂ’s a chaste and modest drink, hinting at its alluring flavor by breathing a slow but diligent waft of green apples, confectionerÂ’s sugar, orange zest, shining red cherries and oak. Below this divine vapor sits the chaliced drink, reverently waiting for imbibing. There the eager drinker finds a similarly rich batch of flavors. Faint vinegar coarseness guides the column of tastes, featuring a light and sweet honey, red and white grapes, orange zest (amongst other citrus) and a very heavy and bombastic conclusion of oak. Poignant and garrulous as the Duchesse may be, it still fits Â“elegantÂ” nicely. The blend of friendly and charismatic flavors allows anyone, be they friend or foe to beer, to pick up a glass and enjoy. If the rich and bold, sweet and sour flavors do not suffice the claim to elegance, then at least the extrovert, humble and generous nature of the Duchesse does. These are, after all, higher qualities that we aspire to. That is, if we want to be classy."
"D: Low. This brew doesnÂ’t sit right. Too much vinegar. I donÂ’t think more than one goblet would be healthy."
"Were this less costly (at $6 for half-a-pint) I would have kept trying la Duchesse all day. A wonderful beer."
"D - Very moreish beer. Well worth a try and I'll be having more soon."
"Arrives a deep garnet with cordovan highlights. Topped with a modest head of fine sand colored bubbles that slowly settles to a thick coating leaving big clots of foam floating. A few active carbonation streams are visible. The smell is tart, dry, sharp and of balsamic vinegar. Sweet and with a pleasing, slightly woody tartness. Sweet up front, and almost sugary. The balsamic notes ride through the middle into the finish where the tart bite shows up, but is then completely dominated by a syrupy sweet flavor. Fine, but active carbonation, rich and medium bodied slightly, ever so, dry. This has a bit of a soda feel about it. I kept coming back to the chalice hoping that it had changed somewhat, maybe dried out a bit, or that the tartness a fought its way to the front, or that at least the sweetness had dissipated. Alas, the chalice was empty and the sweet, cloying taste lingered. I had hoped for more. My wife enjoyed it more than I."
"Very cool beer. Very sour and very sweet. Different than most Belgian sours. The carbonation is TERRIBLE though, the overall impresion would have been higher if it was spot on. There is no head and very fizzy. Perhaps I got a bad bottle. Very fun beer regardless."
"Overall: For those not familiar with the style, this beer may hit you a bit like a sweet tart does. The first time I had a red it took me a little while to convince myself I wasn't drinking some kind of sweet-and-sour sauce. This really isn't too unbalanced of a beer. Sure, the sour wins out over the sweet and bitter, but it's not so pronounced that it landslides everything. Certainly haven't come close to defining everything in this beer either. Very complex and worth trying if you can find it."
"Dark red. Extremely vinous nose (Pinot Noir), with hints of ripe red fruit, muffin batter, overloaded with blueberries, a light touch of caramel and of course. lactic and acetic acid funk. Quite vibrant. Rich compatibility between the sweet malts, bright fruits and sweeteners (?) and the funky and sour lactic and acetic, lightly woody tones. Really more of a mild Red, but very characterful and complex."
"This brew feels wonderful on the tongue and is a delight to have. It's not my favorite Flemish but certainly isn't bad beer to have on hand."
"One thing I like about this style of beer (or at least good examples of it, such as this one) is that even though they are very sour, they are also rich and quite drinkable, something to which the unexpectedly light mouthfeel contributes. The other thing I like about these is how unique they are: while I certainly canÂ’t see myself drinking them all the time, they are a refreshing change of pace. And this particular example is one of the better. So, while this might not be the most approachable style for someone who is new to the craft beer scene, it is definitely something a more adventurous and more experienced beer drinker should try. Highly recommended."
"The feel was sour obviously, but if you can stick that out, it has an excellent blend of carbonation and sweetness to compliment the sour feel. It reminded me of a lambic or more specifically yhr three philosophers, but more subdued. Overall an excellent beer."
"Part of the Monk's Cafe Michael Jackson dinner. This was beer # 3. This beer poured a dark burgundy color with a nice tan head and nice lacing. The aroma is at times an overwhelming sourness of cherries but pretty pleasant. The taste is tart cherries, a bit earthy. This one is a bit acidic but overall a crisp beer and with a medium body, pretty drinkable."
"One of these in a sitting is fine for me, a most unusual, yet tasty beer that seems to be what Belgians do best, gotta hand it to them, complexity is second nature in their brewing tecniques...Prost!"
"Beer pours a dark red, nearly opaque. Head forms about half an inch and recedes to a light covering. Aromas are incredible, jump right out of the glass. As this is my first Flemish Red I will just describe what I find, as I'm not sure what I ""should"" find... Smells like red berries, balsamic and red wine vinegar sourness. Never smelled a beer quite like this wow! Flavors are both sweet and sour (to me, akin to some duck sauce from Chinese take-out). This beer is incredible, have had nothing quite like it. Drinkability is only so-so as it's a fairly sweet brew and I'm not sure if I could have many of these."
"Overall this is a decent brew. Flavors are surprisingly smooth and balanced."
"Pours out dark brown with outlines of ruby when put in direct light. The head comes and goes quickly, but will leave a slight ring if agitated. Smells of balsamic vinegar, tart berries and oak. I also detect an eau de elmer's glue, but oddly enough, it's a good thing here. Tastes of tart fruit, specifically cherries, alonside oak tones, a slight alcohol presence, and a grape-juice/wine-like acidity. I got a lot of the same wine-like characteristics as I did with the Vichtenaar, but with this brew, they seemed more married to the other flavors and don't stand out AS much. Mouthfeel is vibrant and biting. Leaves me dry. Excellent. This one seems a lot more mellow than the Vichtenaar I reviewed earlier, both in the flavor profile and mouthfeel. Fantastic beer."
"Yes, this beer is complex. Very complex. I haven't tasted anything like it. However, the complexity isn't pleasant. I want a beer, not a science experiment. I guess that I'm too attached to the Reinheitsgebot... I'd take the robust complexity of an Aventinus to this beer anyday."
"This is my first beer of this style, and I'm pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect to like this nearly as much as I have."
"Pours a striking dark ruby/garnet with a short, fading tan head. Nose is similar to the Sour Brown with the strong balsamic vinegar astringency along with tart lambic fruits. Taste starts with a quick vinegar/lambic sour bite and then gets sickly sweet with overripe granny smith apple peel and rancid citrus then finishes with a hint of dry tart. Mouthfeel is clean and bubbly. Would be a lot more drinkable if the sickly-sweetness was kept in check, but still certainly one of the most unique beer experiences I've had to date."
"Pours a ruby red/brown, medium off white head forms, lots of lace, head goes in not too long. Smell is sour cherries, caramel, yeast, sweet malt, acidity. Taste is a strange mix, sugary at first, cherries, then a super sour/acidic hit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation, nice and creamy. Crazy sour/acidity, but great, would definately try again."
"And, uh, well. I won't be able to finish the (750ml) bottle. It's just too..."
"The taste is light, lighter than the smell leads you to believe. It's not my favorite, but it did finish with a saki clean, like a good Flanders. The body is a little light, though from other's I've had."
"Deep ruby colour with a bit of brown topped by a pale tan head. Good lacing made up of very fine bubbles. Tart aroma with some fruity esters and a bit of tobacco. There's a hint of solventy alcohol here that was slightly distracting, but diminished somewhat with time. Syrupy sweetness balances the fruity tartness quite nicely - almost like candy. Dry finish. Very fine carbonation, full mouthfeel and palate coating. Quite nice overall. The sweet and tart combination in the flavour really works. Thanks Viggo!"
"pours out of the bottle a dark brown, red when held to the light, with only a slight head. smell is a very funky sourness. just a hint of Vichtenaar's richness in the mouth. somewhat daunting sourness. delicate, with a slightly metallic bite at the end."
"Cherry tartness dominates the flavor with some oak barrel woodiness. Delicious and highly drinkable. Pleasing dryness in back. Full body, with sourness coating the mouth. Robust enough to feel like an ale, but only just. Undeniably delicious."
"I would like to try others in this group to have a broaded range of this style."
"Again the first thing I noticed is a sour taste, probably because it was least expected. There is certainly wine like characteristics in this beers taste and smell. Very sweet, with notes of cherry and grape. I think that this would go very nice with cheese cake or a sweet dish of some sort. I'm definatley interested to try more of this style."
"Mouthfeel is a touch awkward with carbonation at first, but mellows during the drink as it warms. Definite sour flavor. Cherries and yeasty overtones. Dry on the finish. Wine-like for sure."
"Recommended, but only for sour beer lovers."
"The beer is actually very drinkable if you don't let it sit long enough that the finish makes you want to die. A great beer for people looking to get their feet wet with sour beers."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and light, which makes this quenching beer a real refresher."
"One other point is that it is only 6.2% abv and which is on the low end of the Belgian scale."
"As a sidenote...my brother was about 95% sure that he got sick from this beer..since he was throwing up most of the next day, and it tasted like cherries on the way out as well.. I apologize for the harsh details, but just thought I'd add that, in case anyone else has had a similar experience."
"330 ml bottle. Duchesse De Bourgogne pours out a Ruby color with a creamy head. The aroma is cherry, oak, and vinegar. The flavor starts out a sweet, but turns very sour. Fruity cherry flavor. I would be surprised if there were no cherries in this beer. A bit chocolatey. The finish is dry and woody. Medium mouthfeel with a high carbonation. This beer is definitely not for everyone. Overall I enjoyed it, but with each sip I alternated between thinking it tasted great and thinking it tasted nasty. I guess each beer lover will have to decide for himself."
"Sherry and port tastes hit the back of the tongue. I also noticed a licorice note. I'm surprised to find this much of a sherry or winey taste in a less-than-7% abv beer. Some esters apparent; finishes with a sparkle of grapefruit."
"Wow, first couple pulls are tart and nothing else but it developes on the palate quite comfortably as it warms. An earthiness breaks through this sour tart up front in your face taste. sweet grapes, crisp finish. This is a nice frickin' brew. certainly not for everyone but highly reccomended if your kinda like lambics but want something with a bit more balance this is for you."
"Full of surprises, flavors and aromas. Nice beer."
"A very dark red-amber flemish (Flanders) red ale w/moderate to loose carbonation. The smell is sharp and sour but has overtones of mellow fermented fruit. The taste is extremely complex dominated by a fermented fruit flavor ranging from berry to banana spice, a wonderful range of sharp to mellow flavors. It has a moderately heavy mouthfeel with a very fizzy and full feeling. This is my favorite beer in the world (period)."
" Tastes sour, sweet, oaky, winey, with the flavors repeating in a random order. This is my first Flanders Red Ale, and I am a fan. Mouthfeel is creamy, but light. The finish is long. I won't struggle to finish the 750ml bottle."
"tastes a lot like a lambic (but not quite as carbonated or overtly fruity). Tart and sweet, certainly a complex ""beer"". Ultimately, this was too sweet and distracting to have with dinner, would be better with dessert. Not quite my style. Lambic fans should grab this up!"
"Pours a dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, lots of lacing throuhout the drink. Scents of grapes, sour/tarty, and caramel. I like the taste, tarty/sour, carbonated, reminds me of a wine, but more to my liken (not a wine drinker at all). Medium body. Very drinkable, this is my first Flanders Red Ale. Totally blew my mind when opened and took my first sip. Would highly recommend to people, will definitely buy again."
"Poured a light, red wine color with a hint of brown. Smelled a bit like red wine, but with a slight hop nuance and cherry lambic tartness. Tasted very sour, this was my first Flanders Red Ale, so I didn't know what to expect. Reminded of a cherry lambic, something I would have after dinner with a tart torte. Could also taste some winey grape notes as well. Mouthfeel was light but with an unexpected tartness, I wouldn't have more than one of these 750ml bottles in a day."
"i have been living in japan for a few years now, so my sugar intake is minimal. this might be the cause of my revolting reaction to anything more than a little sweet. i don't know anything about this style of beer, but compared to everything else i've had, i thought this was gross and not worth $5 for a small bottle."
"A very unique and complex brew. Poured out to a dark brown / almost black color that turned burgandy when held to the light. Medium level of carbonation produced an exceptionally dense foamy head. Some notes of lace. Aromas of fermented apples, mature grain, and some sweet bourbon on the nose. Different, yet not unplesant. Taste is unlike any Flanders Red Ale I have previously had, or any beer for that matter. Very similar to a well rounded sweet red wine; flavors of mature dark fruit, sweet caramel, tart sugar, very sweet malt and a touch of worscheshire toward the finish. Very complex and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is again very wine like, with some carbonation that adds a demention that brings to mind a pink champagne. A good level of drinkability. This is not my favorite style of beer, but I could sure see this in my fridge again soon. I look forward to introducing my wine loving friends to this. Highly Recommended for the style."
"Poured from bottle. Another sampling with my father when he was in town. Appearance: dark amber color, lots of carbination bubbles, little to no head, champainge like. Smell: sweet and fruity. Taste: again sweet and fruity smooth finish, there are so many flavors going on I can't explain it. Mouthfeel good. A winner, this is beeer?! Try it if you want to see where beer can go."
"Pours out to a sparkingly clear deep ruby, forming an expanding plumage of soapy khaki bubbles. No yeast in the bottle or in the glass. Carbonation is initially brisk and forms spiral streamers contributing to the effervescent head. The aroma is just amazing...malt vinegar and vanilla interspersed with wonderfully fruity esters....rotting bing cherries, light amber malts, apples, pineapple, and when swirled, apricot, prunes, chocolate syrup, and pink bubble gum scream out. As it warms, an exceptional amount of vanilla (literally boatloads) makes itself known, becoming the dominant note in the mix. Retention is amazing and lacing is delicate yet solid. The taste is exactly as it smells....sweet, but not sickeningly so...more than enough to overpower the acidity with lingering aftertastes of pineapple and bubble gum. Lightly dry in the finish with just a touch of metals. As it warms, tobacco and leather become the overwhelming aftertaste. Alcohol is apparent just as a peppery flourish. The mouthfeel is wonderful with a medium body. Very easy to drink, although I could see the sweetness wearing thin for some, as it has an almost saccharin character to it. This is a real treat, although more of a dessert drink. I'm glad I bought a 4-pack and not the bomber. This is one of the finest Flemish Red's/Brown I've had (very different next to old-school Goudenband). An exceptional, exceptional beer. I will be drinking much more of this. Highly recommended, particularly with creme brulee."
"things can change."
"Had this on tap the other night while at Marhars. The brew was dark brown with a red like tinge to the color. Had a smallish head of tan bubbles that clung to the sides of the glass leaving some fain lacing down the sides of the brew. Before I really even try to take a whiff of the brew I can notice a sour like smell to it. On a deeper whiff of the brew, I notice fruit like smells that seem to blend or lead to the sour aroma. I believe that the fruit smell is of apple and/ or cherries but am not 100% positive. The taste is somewhat sweet with a clear sour flavor that goes nice with the malt backbone and spicy finish. Over all this is a great brew for people that like this type. For me I can usually handle about one before the sourness starts to get to me but I would and will get this brew again"
"What took me so long to try this? Not at all what I expected, but something that I will keep around for a nice change of pace."
"A tasty detour from my usual..."
"Carbonation. Carbonation. More carbonation. It's a super carbonated cherry cola with a tang. I think this one was too much for me: overly sweet and funky. Couldn't finish it. Awful."
"Wow, after over 2 years, I am surprised at my review. I love this beer now, and I love the style. How could I have given it such a low review. I am going to rereview it once I drink another one."
"Smell was fairly complex; lots of things going on. Taste was less sweet and sour than BdesF and much more complex. This was a very enjoyable experience, so I repeated it!"
"A brownish beer with hints of red. Aromas of cranberry, cherry, and sour raspberry. An interesting interplay of sweet and sour flavors, but it lacked some of the complexity, especially the vinegar notes, that are found in the Rodenbach Grand Cru. It lost itÂ’s way a little on the finish too. Still good, just not fantastic."
"A special occasion beer, to be sure. I don't think I could drink more than one of these a night, but I can see doing just that sitting by a roaring fire in January sometime."
"poured out ruby red color, off white head with lasting and lacing head retention. soured fruit, raison, floral, mulled wine aroma. some cherry, tangy, tart, sour, red wine flavors. moderate bodied with high carbonation. overall a nicely sour, tangy drink for the palate to dissect"
"Drinkability: I'll be the first to admit this is not a style with which I've had much experience. So while this may or may not be a stellar example of the style, it's something I simply do not like. Novel, but not something I'll be back for any time soon."
"overall: this is an amazing red ale. i have to get some more of this. i wonder how it will change over a year. nice sweet and sour flavors remind me of what a fruit beer should taste like. complex now and maybe even more so after laying down. a must try."
"The taste itself is excellent and complex, with both sweet and sour flavours vying for dominance. There's a fruity touch there, and a smooth aftertaste that really rate this one high on the drinkability. It's one to be sipped and savored rather than gulped, and the ample carbonation is also very pleasant. Like I said before, I would definitely recommend this as an alternative to your regularly scheduled brew on one of those nights you need something a little more spicy."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Was my first Flanders Red, and I can say this is undoubtedly one of the most unique styles of beer I've ever tasted. Just completely in its own dimension. That being said, different also meant complex and wonderful in this instance. Pours a very deep, deep red with hints of oaky brown. Aroma is of bourbon-soaked wood, tart apple, apricot, date, grapes, dark cherry. Taste begins with tart apple, transforming into a almost tropical note, and then ending on a distinctive kick of bourbon or finer whiskey. Wow. Mouthfeel is bubbly, slightly astringent but pleasantly so. Suprisingly drinkable as well. Overall one of my favorite finds of the year."
"Well balanced throughout, but the beer's sweeter and fruitier side buffers against any abrupt sourness which gives it a restrained property that not only challenges the palate, but soothes it with ample wine sweetness and toasty malts."
"Opinion: This is a mighty fine beer! It is a bit sweet for my taste, and I am assuming that it was added to make the beer more appealing to the masses. There is definitely a sour component to the beer, and it manages to maintain a woody character. This is a beer that I would have often if it was available in my area, but at the same time, it isn't one that I would have too many of. I'd definitely recommend it!"
"overall- WOW. very suprised by my first flanders red ale. nothing like i ever would have expected. nothing like any other beer ive had. im looking forward to trying other beers of the same style to compare."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Chewy and mouth-coating, smooth carbonation. A bit rough towards the end, with explosive activity towards the back of the throat. Aside from the saccharin-like notes in the taste, this is a decent Flanders sour ale that is readily available here."
"actually drinking it was a bit of a bonerkill. so incredibly sweet, with little of the sour belgian character i was hoping for (my only experience with with style previously was a rodenbach, so my standards are perhaps artificially high). actually tasted like cranberry-apple cider, with only a hint of that sourness i longed for. to top that off carbonation was sparse so the perception of sweetness was enhanced further. dissappointing"
"Drinkability: It is a good beer. However, flemish reds are a different type of beer and so be prepared if you are jumping into the style for the first time."
"Carbonation is good, but this beer seems at times too sweet and wine-like. The richness and higher than typical strength will probably limit me to one of these a session."
"I cannot find a flaw large enough to constitute a complaint as this beer is highly drinkable and warrants many more encounters. A very finely crafted ale."
"I'm conflicted about Duchesse De Bourgogne. I can taste the outlines of what must be an incredible Flanders red, but this particular bottle tastes like it's on the cusp of the point of no return. Even though it's still drinkable, I'm convinced that the Duchesse and I haven't met in the most optimal of circumstances. I'll keep an eye out and will give a younger, more vivacious version a second review."
"Another amazingly complex red ale, I could see myelf taking rodenbach over this mainly due to its amazing drinkability and session qualities but this is perhaps a tad more complex"
"I downed the drinkability and mouthfeel just for the sake of it that is, just that I absolutely was enchanted by this beer but it's not perfect (in my de leckere standards) but this IS A MUST for any beer lover. bless you, madame la duchesse."
"Mouthfeel was perfect for the taste, and I would get this one in a heartbeat were I able to find it around me. Thanks to GClarkage for the trade!!!"
"Interesting beer. One of the prettiest looking beers I have seen. Deep mahogany wood color with lacy white head. Had no idea what to expect when I picked up this 750 ml bottle. Tangy cherries and raspberries hit your tongue first off. Champagne bubblyness tickles your mouth. Smells of sloe gin. Light and refreshing mouthfeel. Extra points for being unique."
"A very good and enjoyable beer, very drinkable."
"This makes for a great summer beer. Take it slow so it goes from cold to cellar temp. This is the only flemish red I can find and i'll pounch on the chance to try another."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a deep reddish almost brown color. Huge foamy, airy tan head rests on tap. Tons of lacing. Aroma is sour and vinous but not too acidic at all or pungent. Taste has a weird contrast of sweet and tart. The sweetness is fruity and kind of sugary but is soon balanced out by a drying tartness. Finish lingers a bit. Not really the vinegar wretching beer like other Flemish Reds I have tried and the sweetness isn't as deep of a maltyness. Take those characteristics as either good things or bad things. I couldn't really get totally into this beer but I didn't mind it really either."
"I'm not sure how drinkable this style of beer is in general...at least for me. I'm not going to blame the Duchess for this..in fact I feel like if I had an appropriate meal I could have 2 of these with dinner. Overall, the Duchess is a brew I would only have once in a while. Too much flavor and sourness for an ""everyday"" beer. Even so, I give this my approval."
"Delicious."
"My only knock on this beer is that it's not easy to drink. I mean, for as strong as it tastes and smells it does go down pretty easily--but it's a very, very strong taste."
"I can see the craft in this beer, and the tangent that it has traveled along. It hasnÂ’t gone so far as to become a malt vinegar flavored alco-pop, but is has flirted close enough to avoid frequent visits. Extra points for being gutsy."
"-UF"
"This was one beer that I could not wait to finish. One of the least drinkable beers I have ever had. I simply did not enjoy this beer."
"This flanders is a real treat especially on tap. For an ale that is only 6.2% abv, the alcohol is noticeable at every turn, making this one a tough choice for a session beer. I don't think I could drink more than one of these per sitting due to the onslaught of flavors this has on my tastebuds."
"Pours a beautiful ruby-red, cranberry juice color, with a small bubbly head, fading fast. Smell is quite intense to say the least. The first thing that comes to mind is a grapey wine character, with an almost gueuze-like tang, finally finished up with a permanent marker smell. Wow. Much more subtle in the taste than in the nose. All that harshness calms down and gives way to a well rounded and complex ale. Ok, wow, again... this is really unlike anything I've had before, so it's tough to describe these tastes. There's a definate fruity quality there; plums, blackberries, grape jelly, etc... really a complex character. I'm having a hard time detecting any hops or malt in this beer, yet while it shares that quality with a lambic, this still seems more like a beer to me. Sweet juicy notes with a bit of a sour kick, though to be honest, from the smell, and from other reviews and the style description I was expecting a little more pucker. I was surprised by the slight funkiness in the finish, like a stinky cheese, a nice unexpected bonus. Interesting mouthfeel too; it seems to change from bubbly and carbonated when it first hits the mouth to a slighty syrupy yet super-smooth finish. Illusion? I have no idea, but it's great. I could drink this beer anytime, and could never get bored of it. So many nooks and crannies to discover in this beer. Go get it. Cheers to the Duchesse!"
"A quaint little 250ml bottle, with a dark label of Renaissance/mediaeval appearance. BB: 11-02-06. Purchased in Brussels September 2004, so it has been aged a little in the bottle. The head was not large in my chalice glass, but seemed to fizz with large bubbles gripping the sides of the glass, whilst the centre of the beer's head was patchy. Later, swirling it steadily in the glass, the head gets better, and thicker. Nevertheless light brown walls of lacing stuck nicely. The beer's colour is a rich garnet, deep red, almost like some red wines, but with much more depth and richness. It is an impenetrable black cherry/rose brown, and quite delicious looking. The aroma surprised me exceedingly--I was expecting some wine notes, but the tannic acidity made me stop a second and remember that this is a beer. Incredible. I detected a little sourness in the aroma, but mostly the red wine and sugary malt. Other hints of oaky muskiness, yeast, raspberries, black cherries and a smell I cannot quite place, whether particular to Belgian Red Ales or not I do not know, as it is my first try of this style. I have to say it is akin to sharp blue cheese, or old cheddar. I also detect some celery salt and seasoning salt, balsamic vinegar, black currant and port. Very complex, I could sniff the aroma all day. The malt smells aged, similar to the smell of a beer glass not washed for a couple of days. The taste is immediate sourness, sharp and bold. Tart does not quite describe it. Sour-soother candies. After that hit come some candied apple, oak, iron, must, tannins, and at the very end the candy malt really balances out with the yeast for a surprisingly drinkable finish. The taste reminded me a little of a lambic faro. The aftertaste is fresh malt, a dash of dryness, and the everpresent sourness starts to fade into a pleasant candied cherry flavour. For all its flavour the taste is not overly complex, the acidity and sharp bite of sourness really dominate, and the oak and yeast only play a background role to that. Still, this is a remarkably different treat; a nice change from the ordinary. The body is medium, and the taste lingers for quite some time on the palate. Some would find this far too sour, but I find the sugary tartness delicious. This has to be tried at least once by all beer-lovers, (and wine lovers)."
"From notes. I enjoyed this brew a few times at the Blind Pig in Champaign, IL. It poured a deep ruby color with a finger of head that fell to a healthy coat over the beer. The nose was beautiful, with a slight sour cherry balanced with a slight sweet cherry over top of a woody, almost tanniny, character. The flavor gave me an initial sourness that moved to a sour cherry that was slightly creamy. I really liked it. The feel was moderate wtih a moderate carb. I felt the sum of the beer was better than its parts. Very smooth and super-easy to drink. I could have enjoyed it all night."
"Overall, this beer (and the style in general) has an amazing flavor that everyone must try at least once. This is just one more example of the breadth of the capability of the beer world."
"The body is quite large, silky smooth and lightly carbonated. The mouthfeel is lush and sweet and really coats your palate with beautiful, funky, sweet and sour flavors. Too bad it's so expensive cuz I could drink this every day. We shared this bottle and paired it with soft Borgogneian cheese of the same region. It was a match made in heaven, thanks Gabe!"
"Overall: an interesting contrast of sweetness versus tart acidity and biting sourness. Nicely done."
"Poured into a flute. Beauty ruby brown with large head. Nose is all tart and cherries. Taste is cherry fruit with some sour notes. Pleasant, but rather tame. I expected more sour bite. Too much sweetness, almost candy like flavors. Perhaps my palate was spent, but I was not altogether thrilled. Not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"Mouthfeel is light crisp springy almost and at the same time it finishes a dry medium. Drinkability is good a very diffrent beer but change is good atleast as far as beer is concerned. Look forward to trying more of this style in the future."
"I have heard this beer described as one of great depth but i'll be damned if I can find it. It's tart, like tart cherries. Then gets quite winelike and hints of oak but is overwhelmed by a cloying sweetness that overwhelms the palate and disappointingly chases all the sourness away. Very sticky mouth with a lingering tartness but no sour driness to speak of, the kind of thing I like in a Flemish Red. Because of the sweetness not too drinkable either. Not bad but not great. I have the rest of a four pack to let this one change my mind."
"Please try this in some form, just to try a pretty different style at the very least. I can't wait to get more."
"I was impressed with that beer, me like!"
"Beer is good. Happy interesting beering."
"WOW, definately the most unique beer i've ever tried (this is the first flanders red i've tried) but its definately a kick in the pants. Pours with a thick white head and a deep amber almost ruby red color with excellent lacing down the glass. The smell is definately unlike any beer i've ever tried, very vinegary and also red wine like with a hint of oak and a fruity belgian yeast smell. The taste is incredible, worlds away from any beer i've ever tried...i never knew beer could taste like the this. The taste begins with a sour cherry tart flavor, followed by a biscuit-like malt taste and finishes with a winey, oaky dryness that lingers on the tongue as well as a warming alcohol sensation. The mouthfeel is smooth with a crisp carbonation that settles as it warms. The drinkablilty is ok but this is very complex and unique so more than a couple wouldnt be so good. Overall a fantastically unique and unbelievably complex brew that my palate cant really grasp fully. A great beer."
"a vinigar aroma, raisons, and a fruity like smell. a 3/4 in. bubly head, like champaign, that disipates guickely. a ruby red hue. very complex, I note chocolate, raspberries, banana. a nice mouthfeel, not coating, very smooth many flavors come at once, the finish is fruity and a bit tart. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but for those people, like myself, who find labic to be to tart, this is a great alternative. A very enjoyable brew."
"body is medium, lightly fruity, long-lived finish. Tasty thing, despite the challenges that must be met in approaching the brew. I'm going to relax with the remainder."
"D- The sourness fades about 3/4 of the way through the beer. It starts to mellow after your taste bud get used to the shock. It has an almost red wine taste and it would be wonderful to develop that more at a port taste with other flavors popping out aswellas the acidity. Definitely an interesting experience."
"Pours a dark dark brown color, and the smell is amazing like wine... many grapes and dark fruits. Taste is not so amazing. The bulk of it has no taste, but when it is swallowed a sour pear and fruit taste lingers. The grapes are also apparent in the finish. If you are looking for a sipping beer with much flavor this is it. Solid, but is has its flaws."
"The color was a really dark reddish brown mix with a real strong smell of fruits and spices which was evident almost immediately after pouring. I am not the biggest fan of lambric style beers so I wont diss this beer because of it. Very complex would be best served as a dessert beer rather than an actual meal beer. A very interesting mix of strong fruit flavors combined with a very earthy tone of wood added to the taste which makes sense because the beer was aged in oak casks. Overall a great choice of beer recommended for those who enjoy red wines or really rich fruity beers."
"Very easy to drink and very refreshing. Fantastic stuff. Not for everybody, but give it a try."
"Drinkability: Very fun and different. It is very good, but the sweetness make be too strong to drink many Duchesses in a row. This is a high quality beer for sure."
" By and large, an interesting beer that should be tried by anyone interested in Belgian styles. This is my third or fourth encounter with the Duchesse, though, and it's always difficult to finish the bottle."
"pours a dark glimmering maroonish brown with a tight white head. Smells of tart cherries, woodsy, mild citrus. Smells sweet and tart soured fruit and sugary sweet mixture. Well balanced flavors run from sweet on the touge to tart and mildly sour in the cheeks. The mouthfeel was awesome with silky smooth liquid and superb carbonation. The aftertaste was slightly tart, fruity and begged for another mouthful. Super beer."
"Having this on-tap at the Hopleaf was a wonderful experience and compelled me to purchase a bottle for review. It poured a very handsome burnt maroon with a small tannish head that quickly retreated to only provide a nice lacing on the glass. Smell is ever so slightly tart with a nice woody/earthy background and a small note of yeast is present as well. Taste is quite refreshing and complex at the same time. Tart cherries eventually yield to a massive oakiness that lingers on the tongue. Finishes sweet. Very good beer in my opinion. On-tap was just a tad better for me, but I'm sure that was due to my surroundings and the gigantic bucket of mussels sitting in front of me."
"Beautiful burgundy brown infused with ruby highlights and multitudes of streaming bubbles that form a thin but lasting head. The smell was a little sweet initially, but rapidly changes to a very winelike aroma. Flavor is great. Sourness up front, grapes and tart cherries, caramel malt backing that does't quite balance the tartness and a lingering vinous mouthpuckering semi-dry finish. Very good. The tartness builds with each beer so if you are planning on making this a session keep some palate cleanser handy."
"This beer poured a clear, dark brown color with creamy, tan foam that settled flat. The smell was a modest but pleasant lightly tart aroma. The taste had a mild tartness with some fruitiness (cherries) and a bit of dried fruit. There was a hint of tangy sweetness and some sour caramel flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel was tart and crisp with medium body and modest carbonation. The flavor lingered only briefly. This was a decent Flanders Red ale, but I expected more from it. The flavor and aroma seemed somewhat muted compared to others of this style. I will have to give this one a try out of a bottle sometime soon."
"I'll have to revisit this brew another time, I seem to be the only one with this experience."
"Pours a brownish red. With a nice fluffy head. The head doesnt last as long as some, but disolves into a thin lace on top. The aroma is extremely complex. Hints of apple, sour cherries, oak, light smoke, leather, fig vinegar. Everytime you take a sniff there seems to be something different there. Taste Is seemingly as complex. Its a great blend of both sweet fruity notes with some sour cherry, vinegar notes. The taste might not be for all. At first it reminded me of the Italian tradition of having a shot of really nice balsamic vinegar after a meal. The sourness however, does not overwhelm and the beer has a nice lightly carbonated mouthfeel that keeps the sourness from becoming too much and lets the sweetness and oakiness shine through. Drinkability is good, however im sure after a number of these the acidity would play wreck havoc with ones GI tract. Overall I recomend this beer and it goes wonderfully with tart foods or foods with cherries in them."
"Overall: This is a beer I wasn't sure I'd like, and I came away pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure I'd want to drink it on a daily basis, but it is truly a remarkable brew. I'd rather break it out once a month or so simply to remind myself how truly complicated and different beer can be. Once you're at this point you're light years away from anything the average person imagines when they think of beer, but that's the whole point, isn't it?"
"I am pretty much a newbie to this style but it is quickly becoming one of my favorites!"
"I could easily drink this every day, but it would be like eating steak and lobster every day. Speaking of which this beer begs to tried with a wide range of food."
"Thanks, babydoc!"
"To be honest, I am sure there are better beers from this style. But, they are not that easily available. This is the best that I have had from this style and I can't wait to try more."
"The beer poured a beautiful rich brown that let just enough light through to provide read highlights. It generated a thin tan head. The aroma is sharp and winey with an alcohol burn. The tastes starts with a wonderful tanin taste, then moves to a sweet dark berry flavor, and finally progresses into a dark tart fruit finish. The feel is smooth and creamy with a nice rounding of flavors on the tounge. An absolutely enjoyable drink and something I will have to consider everytime I go to the shelf to make a purchase."
"Again, it's not my cup of beer but graded by the style, I suppose it's a solid example."
"Very nice deep chestnut brown color. No real head to speak of. Oakey,vinuous aroma. Makes me think of a cabernet. Raiseny like flavor. Malty upfront. Very wine like. Not overly sweet-nice balance between sweetness and a slight sourness. Good smooth body. A nice beer. Good sipping beer-not real high in alcohol but a sipper none the less."
"This beer is very drinkable and in my opinion a session beer. It was sweet but not too sweet. Sour but not too sour. And the finish left my palate clean and wanting more."
"I tried this at the Hopleaf, a pub on the north side of Chicago. Got it on tap, and it poured deep brown with a small head, which dissipated quickly. The aroma was somewhat fruity with a hint of hops. The beer looked hearty, but the mouthfeel was actually a bit on the thin side. The flavor was incredible. It has characteristics similar to something like a Lindeman's Kriek, but the sweetness was not as pronounced and there was more of an oak characteristic to the flavor and it tasted more ""ale-like"" than a sweet lambic. The finish was wonderful -- a bit fruity with a hint of cherry. Overall, an outstanding beer."
"Definitely a change of pace from the everyday beer. Served in a chalice, fairly short-lasting brown-tinged head tops a dark, reddish brown beer. The first whiff has quite a bite to it. Once you get past the initial vinegarish scent, a more fruity odor dominates. The acerbic trend continues with the first sip; an almost overpowering (but not at all unpleasant) sour cherry flavor dominates. The tingling aftertaste is probably my favorite thing about this beer; think eating sour patch kids when you were younger. Not a beer I'd suggest to introduce your macro friends to the BA world, but overall a pleasant drinking experience."
"My one major complaint would be that the sweetness of the beer was overly simplistic. I don't know if that's the result of the tartness deadening my palate, or if it's from the reported artificial sweeteners. Either way, it just seemed that it lost out on some of the subtlety that it could have had."
"Overall- can I have some more, please?"
"Appearance in the glass is not exceptional, no big head and a brown, in sunlight red colour. Smell is fruity and litle sour with some oak. Taste is mild( compared to the Rodenbach grand cru) and a lot sweeter& less sour. Some oak is there but taste is mostly sweet and gets sweeter and sweeter. After drinking half a glas and reviewing it I got more and more a feeling that it was lemonade what I was tasting. Maybe a nice beer for people that start with sour beers but nothing special to me."
"Smell is tart, oaky fruit (cherry?) with olives, earth, and light vinegar. Interesting. Tastes much like it smells. Lively carbonation. Sweet yet dry tart fruits (strawberry, cherry). Musty oak accent throughout. Very interesting. Finish is fruity and tart. Mama likes. Medium-bodied, high carbonation, and quite drinkable. I like this style to begin with (represented by the few samples I've had) and this doesn't disappoint. Recommended."
"anyway, overall, this is a fantastic beer. Alone, a single bottle can occupy you for an extended period of time; however, it would be tough to have more than one (kind of like very how you can only take so much rich chocolate) at a sitting. I can see how it's probably not for everybody; Definitely try it with food, especially something with cream or that has similar body."
"It pours a dark, deep, rich brown and red. The carbonation is extreme, contributing to a huge, soft, tan head. Amazing lace. The aroma is wild and strangeÂ…both acid and sugar, yeast, cherries, smoke, berries, candy, vinegar, and countless other sensations. WoooÂ….the smell alone is dizzying with complexity. The taste is out of this worldÂ….sweet and sourÂ…cloying and mouth-puckering. ItÂ’s a mashed-up dichotomy of unexpected flavors. Again, extraordinary strangeÂ….I can see that this oneÂ’s not going to be for everyone. Thin to medium mouthfeel, with a lot of prickly effervescence. I personally didnÂ’t find it extremely drinkableÂ….itÂ’s an experience, and good (without a doubt), but itÂ’s also tongue-taxing and the acidity got to me."
"Had on tap at Anam Cara, and I enjoyed this one. I am liking this style! Anyway, pour when served was the dark burgundy, no head. It had a rather muted aroma, although I thought there were some kriek like notes. I found it easy to drink, more sweet than sour, with some cinnamon powder like taste and texture in the finish. I am intrigued by the sweet vs sour experiences of the other reviewers when trying this beer. Maybe it has an evil twin? I liked this, and would get again."
"What a great interaction of sweet malt and fruity/berry flavors with the sourness this style calls for. An enjoyable complex beer and a unique style."
"Pours a deep clear mahogany with red highlights. Creamy tan head which subsides to a frothy layer and substantial creamy lacing. Rounded wine-like smell with woody tones (likely to be too sour for some). Initially soft, tart flavors which develop into a rounded fruitiness. The flavor is much more subtle than the smell would initially suggest. Very satisfying creamy smooth medium body."
"Fruity, sour, tangy. Cola sort of flavour running underneath the hole thing. Medium bodied, rustic carbonation."
"I'm going to be blunt on this. Horrible. It came in a bottle with a ""best before"" date of 01/01/06. I liked the color, a nice deep auburn capped by a small beige top. The smell consisted of berries, and a sort of cough medicine overtone. A small amount of citrus hit the nose as I drank. When I forced down the first drink all I tasted was vineager. I tried another few ""pulls"" and after tasting round after round of vineager and berries I had to give up. I even orderd a sprite to get the taste out of my mouth."
"i absolutely love the smell, and would definitely go for this again..."
"The taste is completely different from the smell. It is now sweet and slightly syrupy with a dry lemonny or citrus type finish. The mustiness comes across like some real effort has gone into brewing this stuff. Chalkiness too with maybe a tad of malt on it. Syrupy mouthfeel and not too drinkable due to its extreme taste and smell. I love it though and will definitely buy again."
"I first fell in love with this beer while having it on tap my first time at the local beer bar. I am very happy to say it was not mere infatuation - the Duchesse poured a dark dark red that looked very appetizing indeed. The nose was acidic, yet lightly so, so it beckoned to the eager taste buds to get some of what they were missing. And what a nice flavor - deep rich earthy flavors combined with a nice sour edge to give both ends of the palate a treat. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I expected, but still very enjoyable. Having drunk this for an entire night, I can truthfully say the drinkability is exceptional. A highly recommended treat for your taste buds."
"This beer has a beautiful deep red color, with a very wispy head and moderate lacing. The nose is very aromatic -- woodsy, minty, cherry, a little funky. Upon first sip, a sweet-tartness explodes on the palate like Smarties candies, only refined. Fresh cherries come to mind instantly, but there's something else too: a very vinous characteristic, bordering on vinegary, that appears but doesn't overwhelm at any point. There is also the feel as if this were aged in some sort of wood -- almost like cedar. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but very much like sparkling wine. The finish is dry and refreshing, with a wisp of tartness and bitterness. This beer is very refreshing. It's ironic that this is considered a ""challenging"" or rare style of beer in the US, when in fact, I would recommend something like this first and foremost to a wine lover that wants to get into beers. My first Flanders red, and certainly not my last."
"I don't know where to begin with this beer. This is by far one of the most complex beers I have ever had the opportunity to drink. The color is a gorgeous deep ruby. If the head would have held a little longer, I would have given it a ""5". The smell has its belgian characteristics with a soft sweet aroma. Ripened cherries fill the nose beautifully. The initial taste really blew me away. The tart beginning smoothes out to a well-balanced sweet wine taste. It has many features of a cherry-cider yet it still holds its beer roots. I think this is truly a fine speciman of master brewing and will have my respect forever."
"Tart, tangy, gorgeous to look at, this has got to be one of my all-time favorites. Notes of sour, sour cherry interlude to delicate oakiness. My only [minor] complaint is that its faint smell totally belies the explosive flavor of this beauty. Truly, a sexy beer, by all counts."
"This appeared a deep brown caramel color with a fairly tall light tan head. Scatterings of lace were left as this was consumed and the head retention was minimal. Holy Crap when I first poured this I took a big whiff and was hit with a HUGE funky tart aroma that was a bit overpowering. After letting it air for a bit it became much more pleasant with a bit of fruity tartness, a slight vinegar smell and some woody notes. Flavor wise this was super tart on the first sip that made me think it was going to take a while to get through this glass. After it warmed a bit I found it much more tasty and palatable with a nice mix of tartness and sweetness balancing each other out with the tartness taking a slight lead. There were fruit flavors and woody notes in the taste as well and a fairly nice lingering sour after taste. Mouthfeel was about medium with a soda bubbly feel to it that kind of detracted from it a bit but not much. This was a real sipper for me and I would definitely have to be in the mood for one of these to drink it. I would have it again in the future but I doubt more than one bottle at a time. Very interesting stuff that deserves a shot if you come across it, and I suggest letting it air out and warm a bit for the best experience."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with an offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is very malty. It has a fruity feel as well which enhances the pale and crystal malts. There are hints of chocolate here as well. The taste is perfect. It has a malty base, but is dominated with a tart fruitiness. This goes down very easy and finishes a bit dry and acidic. The mouthfeel is perfect as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good drinking beer. I love the fruitiness along with it's complex malt makeup."
"Had this beer on tap at the Toronado in San Francisco in September, 2004. Served in a authentic Duchesse glass. Watched as it poured with a small head that didn't remain for long. A very opaque, mahoganey color. Almost like blackcurrant juice. A beautiful hue to it. Tons of lace that just stuck to the side and didn't disipate. Smelled both sweet and sour at the same time. A typical Flemish stlye taste but better. Not too sour as I expected. Maybe a cranberry taste or even something nutty in the background. Aftertaste is good as well. A definite great beer that I will have again."
"Mouth-coating richness balances the acidity. It's very easy drinking. I was worried this would be too acidic or vinegary to drink. No way. This is my first Flanders Red, and I'm impressed."
"I had this on tap twice at two different locations, and it is consistently good. It pours a clear dark reddish-brown with a small tan head. The smell is one that is predominantly sour malt. I love that smell but have brother BAs that hate it. The flavor has an initial hit of sweetness but is quickly drowned by the sour malt taste. My wife calls it vinegar but I love it. It has a medium-bodied feel on the palate and is very acidic. I really like the beer but one is my limit. The ascerbic taste is too much for prolonged drinking."
"This brew pours a dark reddish brown with amber hues and a thin white head that barely leaves any bit of a lace. Aromas are a mix of sweet cherries, and what can best be described as a winey vinegar sort of scent. Initially flavors are sweet and tart, with a cherry grape like flavor that almost pushes the bounds of being cough syrup like. Following there is a slight acidic flavor to this brew, and just a hint of spice which makes this brew totally intriguing. The brew finishes are tart and acidic as it started with fruit dominating in the end. Overall this brew was funky but good."
"Hits your tonue with a quick sweet / sour flavor. Very candylike. Citrusy up front like a demented lemonade. Smoothly transitions and leaves your mouth with a fruity syrupy flavor that hangs around for the next sip."
"Dark ambered and ruby with tons of carbination rising up to a thick and creamy khaki head. Wonderful aroma. Warm and oaky, molasses. Almost get a BBQ sauce scent, very spicey like a worcester sauce. Make sure to let this one warm up so you get all the flavors and scents to come out and play with ya! Tart and intense flavors! Wow do they reallly hit you in the back of your mouth... Sweet and sour. The blithering one that I drank this with said he tasted pickled beets.... yep... damn if he isn't right... how weird.... but yep. Very interesting tastes in this one, unusual. Not one that I could drink more than one of these 11.2oz'ers because there is such a huge intensity of flavors and there is such strength, but like I said, quite interesting tastes for sure."
"New to BC this is a nice find. Pours russet brown with minimal head, the kicker is the intense sour smell on the nose. I can't say I like the smell but it defines this beer as out of the norm. The flavours are a mixture of sourness, old cherries and vinous notes. I love how this beer tastes like it has been down in the cellar forever. Not a session beer by any standard but very drinkable in small quantiites."
"Pours a deep ruby color with a nice creamy,sticky head that leaves waves of lace down my brandy snifter,aromas are all Belgian some sour cherry and malt vinegar with a touch of funk hits right on.Now I got alot more sweetness than expected in this brew,a kinda sweet/spicey mix that coats ur mouth with only a touch of sourness in the finish wich was unexpected.I picked up some cherry stone and iron notes a little more as I drank but this seems to stay more on the sweeter side for the style,true to the style not sure, but worth a try its a quality brew."
"I thought at first that I might've gotten a bad bottle, but I asked around and the people that I talked to have had this experience. Some liked it, some didn't. Count me in the latter group. It tastes like a bubbly raspberry vinegarette. Ugh."
"1.5 years later, sourness to it. Interesting yeast flavours. Expires 6/07."
"Good stuff. Made it to my top ten list."
"Pours into a goblet with a bright mahogany color not unlike a merlot, topped by a light brown head with very tight bubbles. The head is very frothy with a few aggressive swirls in the glass. Smell is soured fruit and a light vinegar aroma which took me off gaurd, being new to the style. Taste is very tart and fruity cherries yet sweet and relatively drinkable. I am very impressed with the unusually creamy mouthfeel with very dense carbonation. I may have to explore more of these diverse and fruity Belgian ales that I haven't been interested in exploring before."
"Good, very drinkable and enjoyable, but lacking something that would make it exceptional."
"Really a great experience with this beer. The nose is very intense vinegar and winey notes with just a hint of malt. The taste is far less offensive than the nose. Big round malt flavors are deftly balanced by the sourness. I get very intense raisin flavors in the finish. Quite a drinkable beer if it wasn't 8$ a 330ml bottle."
"The beer as it evacuates the dark brown bottle pours a deep incarnadine color with a majestic crown of tan upon that body, the consistency creamy and the residual lace a thick and clinging sheet that obfuscates the glass. Nose is sweet, fresh and crisp, hints of over ripe fruit, cherries comes to mind, bit of oak also noted, a real treat for the olfactory and ocular senses start, is sweet and malt laden, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is benign in its acidity, the hops spicy and pleasant, with the aftertaste lingering long upon the palate, a true work of the brewerÂ’s art."
"The mouthfeel was crisp with a long sour fruity finish. This brew is medium / heavy in body with decent carbonation. This brew is for slow drinking session late at night, but drinking more than one would be tough."
"Pours a deep, deep reddish brown with a stiff head and lots of lace. Aroma of stinky feet and whiffs of fruit. First taste is so sour that it jolts you. Then it settles down and you sense layers of fruit and malt. No hop presence at all. Puckering sourness balanced by some malty sweetness in the finish. Full mouthfeel and lots of carbonation. Extremely refreshing despite the intensity of the flavor and mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"On tap at the Ginger man NYC, Pours dark ruby reddish, cloudy and murky. Nose of must and old feet. Classic Belgian puffy head and leaves nice sheets of lacing. Not for the faint of heart or those lacking a sense of palate adventure. Intense flavors of sour cherries and sweet malts give this one excellent complexity. some nuts, some stinky cheese and some of this stuff and you're all set up for a flavor extravaganza!"
"Wow! Immediately you notice it's wicked viscosity. I wondered if it was liquid bread. The head was wonderful, though a bit disconcerting as areas of different color and texture appeared as I let the head settle. The smell of it was almost like barley-wine, though not too overpowering. The taste was magnificent, very well balanced. You can taste the woodtones immediately, but the aftertaste is very pleasant, smooth. The only thing that put me off a bit was the mouthfeel...like you almost had to coax the beer ouot of the glass...halfway to yogurt it felt at times, though it mellowed out on the tongue. All around worth fighting through it at least once...MAN UP!"
"Beautiful head, very dense and lasting. Dark brown, purple color body with some orange reflects. The smell is very sour, like vinegar, with maybe a surprizing chocolate aspect and some cheesecake aromas. The taste is not as sour as one would expect; bread like, very citric, oranges. A sangria like aspect that also appears in the smell becomes more and more noticeable: red wine and fruits. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, thanks to the long lasting head, almost melting in the mouth. I had this beer before but it was a bit too cold. Today I served it at a higher temperature and it revealed a more interesting variety of aromas and flavors than just the basic sourness one would expect."
"Dark burgandy with a lively pale khaki head. The aroma is like a fruit basket with peaches and green apples and grapes. ThereÂ’s also a slight vinegariness in there. The flavor is more tart than I expected, giving the fruits life. A bit of wine. ThereÂ’s some spice or herb in there that is slipping my mind. Slick on the tongue, this one takes a bit to get used to, but it improves as you sip it."
"The aftertaste was was sweeter than I prefer in a Flanders Red but I would drink this beer again happily for it's own sake and the enjoyment that I would experience from it."
"There's a very strange effect creating the head on this beer that I've never seen. It looks like tiny bubbles of carbonation gather in clumps in the bottom of my tulip glass. When enough have stuck together, they rise in a big gob through the beer to join the small tan head. It's a little disconcerting at first, seeing these pale gobs rising. The beer itself is dark red-brown and clear. Swoopy, thick, thick lacing. Loads of fresh bread waft out of the glass. Tangy, sweet toffee. Alcohol, prunes, sour fruit. That might be one of the fullest aromas ever. The beer starts spicy, with tangy fruit and toffee. The middle is thick, sweet, fruity, creamy. There's almost a little chocolate. The finish is bready, with sweet cherries and a dry edge to it. This is just one fruity, bready, sweet beer. Rich, flavorful. I can't really think of anything it compares to, but I really like it. Just a little too sweet for me, but the breadiness and cream are great."
"This is one of my Top Ten favorite beers. This is a great beer, not just in this style. Extremely drinkable. An absolute ""must try"" beer."
"This is my first experience with a Flanders Red, and I find this beer to be interesting. That being said, it reminds me too much of fizzy wine, or perhaps a wine cooler mixed with champagne. Just not the sort of thing I normally go for. I'll try a few more examples of the style and revisit this. Some day."
"Dark, reddish brown witha chunky light tan head. Aroma is sharply sour and a touch fruity. Vinegar scent is almost overpowering. Flavor is much less potent than the aroma suggests. Very complex with many flavors hiding under the press of sourness. Not really sure how I feel about it. Definitly woth a try, but it gets to be a real chore to drink."
"An overwhelming fruit presence, so much so that it resembles a lambic. Alcohol is nicely masked, but this is not balanced. Too sweet for my taste, and too off flavor for a belgian."
"This is my first experience with a Flanders Red ale. I like it a lot, but doubt that I could distinguish this from a good fruit Lambic, in a blind tasting. The wood aged character is the most obvious difference. Just a little on the tart side, as for drinkability."
"ng"
"Pours with a two-finger white head leaving that fades quickly but leaves a good lace. Clear, deep reddish amber. Nose is raisin. Tastes of raisins and apricots, smooth with sweetness but has a slightly tart finish. Complex - sweet and sour. A 330ml bottle was $3.50 from Colonial Liquors, Acton, Ma."
"First sip gives an average bodied brew with almost non-existent carbonation. A slighty syrupyness in texture. The flavor is very tart with sour cherries and granny smith apples coming out. The cherries dominate though. The finish is very sour and slightly drying. I really enjoyed this beer and wish there were some other examples of this style floating around CT."
"Damn this is an interesting beer. Granted this was my first time I've tried a flanders red, I didn't know what to expect. Poured out like thick cough syrup. Dark ruby with lots of carbonation. Smell..at first it was like soy sauce. But once you keep whiffing it, it smells like wine somewhat. Cheeries and plums comes to mind when smelling. Taste was unique. Beginning is tart, sweet and sour. Very complexed. Once the sourness goes away, fruits hit the palate with some woody finish to it. Finishes very dry to my surprise. Worth trying out."
"Drinkability: I'd drink a six pack every day if I could afford it. Awesome representation of the style; not as mouth puckeringly sour as others. Quite a treat."
"There's a good deal that I like here, but it fails to coalesce into an enjoyable beverage. It's actually the sweetness here, rather than the sourness, that makes me wince."
"Although this is my first time trying this particular style I will try and judge this one fairly. 11.2oz bottle pours a reddish brown with slight off white head that stays around. Smell is of nuts and sourness interesting mix here. The taste is to put it lightly interesting, but I like it. There is an upfront fruity sourness that lets the fruit linger and then the sweetness comes in and finishes nicely with some nutty tastes. I taste cherries for sure, but there's some other kinds of fruit in there as well I think. Lots of carbonation, but it's done rather nicely. It's definitly a different tasting beer, but it's very enjoyable none the less."
"Flavor is nicely sour and acidic, but certainly not overdone. Begins to sweeten as it warms, and some very fruity flavors come out, particularly cherries. Mouthfeel is perfection, smooth, crisp, with just the right amount of carbonation...and the tartness in the finish leaves you wanting to pour more of that big bottle. As ""the handsome man"" has said in his review below, this beer isn't for everyone; but you'll never know unless you try it."
" The Duchesse has a crisp start with some tingly carbonation. She then smoothes out to a very nice mouthfeel. The body is medium-full. The sour flavor is awesome. It is big, bold, and absolutely beautiful. The fruit flavor and touch of spices balance just enough to keep the beer from being pure vinegar. I think that this balance is perfect. It may be the fact that I have had no other samples of this style, but it really does the trick for me. It is interesting and complex, and that sour bite keeps me wanting more. This will certainly become a regular whenever I feel like having a good brew. I get one every time I go to Eulogy, and now I have 750s to enjoy at home. This beer is definitely not for everyone, so if you don' t like it, send it to me."
"It's hard for me to call this beer very drinkable -- it's certainly not meant to be quaffed in a few gulps, and quite frankly, I have a hard time seeing myself return to it very often. I imagine it would pair rather nicely with food, given its wine-like qualities. Either way, though, it's an experience worth having."
"Mouthfeel - bubbly, crisp and syrupy. I'm salivating like Pavlov's dog's."
"11.2 oz Bottle Best Before 27/05/05 A reddish brown with no head and only a bit of a foam layer. Looks similar to thr Vichtenaar I just had. Slightly acidic aroma with notes of rotten cherries and peppercorns. Quite spicy. Body is lively with carbonation and with a crisp somewhat dry finish. Flavor is sweet and sour with slight vinegar and acidic notes. Some sour fruit also in the mix. Overall much better than the Vichtenaar in my opinion and has some good flavor."
"I have had this beer a couple of times. It does not appear to bee a good representation of the style, but a style of itself. An interesting experience."
"The only drawback, I get a bad case of the burps and they arenÂ’t good burps like hops burps. Burp!"
"Not real drinkable, it's to sour for most."
"Sharp vinegar (balsamic) and a slight sweetness of ripe dark fruit (plum) in the nose. Deep purple opeque look in the goblet. 1/2 inch pale beige head that is persistant. Inital tangy/sweet/puckering fruit taste of bing cherries and ripe plum is then followed by a sweeter woody finish. Medium mouth. Good but due to many factors not very drinkable.. a case of these would last you a very long time."
"Dark ale with a very small head that disappears swiftly. A smell of fruits I can't quite all identify(dark berries, cherries, plums) with apparent vinegar. As it enters the mouth, sour and sweet blackberries, notes of wood refreshing despite above 10 celsius. Oak comes back in the aftertaste that remains sweet."
"Drinkablilty: All in all, This is a very complex beer with a lot going on. I just can't help thinking it tastes a little too much like wine gone south. Not altogether unenjoyable, but, one is plenty."
"An easy pour produced a giant, fine bubbled, brownish tan head sits atop the deep, dark burgandy colored beer. Good, solid lacing when the head finally subsides. Sour, vinegar aroma along with some spicy mustard in the background. Tart, sour apple and cherry flavor, along with a very metalic taste. I hate vinegar and the aroma is killing me, but the flavor is pretty damn good, as long as I hold my nose. It kind of reminds me of a kriek version of Quelque Chose. Medium to light body, soft mouthfeel, and an impressingly clean aftertaste. I don't like the smell, but after a while you get used to it. I probably wouldn't drink this beer all that often, but I will drink again."
"Very nice deep red/light brown with some blackness. Small off-white head stays a bit as lace but mostly as a small ring around the beer. Great up-front sourness in the aroma with vinegar. Bright and alive, an earthiness with acidity. Flavor is very well-balanced. The malt flavors come out as it warms. Light and crisp, wonderful bubbles. Very drinkable - I could have a few."
"With Rodenbach off the market, I was told that this is the best substitute. I personally couldn't compare the two of them (though I do have an Alexander waiting for another day), but on its own this is a nicely sour taste that's well-balanced and doesn't pucker my mouth. Quite good, and one I'd have on another day."
"My wife found this at AJ's in Ahwatukee, Arizona. She's been getting into Belgian beers, which is cool, but she didn't like this one and gave it to me to finish. I'd just finished a Stone IPA when she handed this to me, what a contrast. I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to enjoy a glassful of balsamic vinegar. That's what Duchesse de Bourgogne smells like, tastes like and looks like. Apparently this is suited to the style, but certainly not suited to my taste."
"Appearance: Ruby red brown with a nice caramel tan head leaves appitent amount of head leaves lacing that's beyond my belief. Aroma: Clear caramel malt with massive amounts of amber tones that left me in a frenzy solid looking flemish ale. Taste: Sharp cherry taste with an incredible amount of sourness that is somehow still enjoyable sets your spirit free excellent taste that can'e be let go. Tart fruit flavor that brings any oud bruin competition. Mouthfeel: Heavy carbonation medium bodied ale nice. Drinkability: Excellent solid array of flavors that proves this is a classic staple of the oud bruin or flemish style ale tradition good stuff."
"Purchased on 1/17/04. Best before date is 07/04/05."
"Update - My original review was written off a 2003 vintage so I thought I'd delve into this delicacy again in 2009. The head didn't come up the way it did before but otherwise it was pretty much spot on. I am always taken aback when drinking this ale as to the sophisticated manner in which they bring in the cloves. They are not small, but the flavor and aroma both manage to sneak in unnoticed at first then halfway through the bottle you pick it up."
"11.2 ounce bottle, best before date of 04/05/04."
"Source: Liquid Solutions"
"Pours with a good sized light tan head that is fizzy for a moment, then slowly recedes to a thick lace. The color is a clear dark-reddish brown. Aroma has lots of sour vinous notes along side notes of dark fruits. Hints of oak are also apparent. The start is quite sweet and fruity. Prunes, raisins, and cherry notes are all present. Not much hop bitterness, but there is a nice sourness that comes in towards the end to balance things out. ThereÂ’s a dry oaky finish. Carbonation is fairly light, and more noticeable towards the end. Very drinkable brew that I enjoyed quite a bit. Reminded me somewhat of a fruit lambic, and would make for a good desert beer."
"Chinotto! Fermented, of course, with a raw fruit kind of sour pear gig going on. Nose of sweat and licorice and pungent weeds amongst sill laden four berry pies and cotton under garments hung in the soft Autumn air. Tart and sweet like the most quality of Chinese dipping sauce. Flow is frothy and bold. Me like, Todd like. More."
"Translucent ruby color with thick beige head that leaves intricate lace in the glass. 33 cl bottle dated best before 10/13/03. Slightly vinegary and sweet aromas blended with the complexity of a Flanders red. Oaky and rich on the tongue. Epitomizes the standard of a Flanders red. Again slightly red wine vinegary taste complemented with a thorough malt sweetness and a sour cherry finish not unlike something like Liefmans Kriek. Absolutely drinkable; a fine example of a substitute for a red wine from a culinary perspective in dishes that complement red wines."
"Dark red brew with a medium head. Sour taste with a distinct cherry flavor which is coming from the oak. Very impressive control of the flemish style. Alcohol taste is not evident at all. I could drink this at any point in time. One of the best flemish sour ales that I've had the chance to taste."
"Drinkability: Never would have thought I would enjoy something of this style this much... please be open to trying this one."
"Drinkability: The beer was decent but i would only question the how often would i actually sit down to drink this beer? I aprreciate it but i don't love it."
"This is beer?? It tasted and smelled more like a wine than it did a beer and therefore it was very much not to my liking. It poured a large sized tan frothy head that consisted of fine-small bubbles. The body was opaque and carbonated with a red hue. The nose reminded me of pure wine as did the flavor. The mouthfeel was tingly, tangy, bitey and medium bodied. There was a fair amount of lacing with this beer."
"I knew I should have purchased the 4-pack when I saw it."
"Reddish brown color with a khaki head that becomes frothy after agitation. Some nice trails of lace remain on the glass. Nose is oaky and buttery with some subdued fruity esters. The nose, to me, screams California Chardonnay with that big buttery, oaky profile (and this is just on aroma). Taste-wise, this doesn't deviate too far from that California Chardonnay once again. Buttery, oaky, and vanilla notes give way to a tart green apple finish with notes of vinegar and funkiness. A wonderful interplay of sweet and sour. One of the most vinous beers I've consumed. The mouthfeel is pleasantly carbonated, yet quite smooth. This is an extraordinarily crafted Oud Bruin. Not quite as quenching as the Goudenband, but it seemed to be more flavorful with a fuller finish. Wonderful stuff."
"Deep ruby color. Medium head. Aroma is slightly vinegar and malts. This is DEFINITELY a Flemish Sour Ale. A big bold sour tartness up front, gives way to a nice vinous fruitiness somewhere in the middle. Fruity and sour and vinegar and sweet all at the same time. Very reminiscent of a Rodenbach Grand Cru. Very complex flavors. Nice beer. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this style. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is vinous and slightly bitter . WARNING::QUALITY CAN VARY FROM BOTTLE TO BOTTLE"
"Thanks marc77. Once again you've picked a winner for me."
"A nice burgundy color, quite clear and pours with almost no head. Tastes lightly sour, with a hint of sweetness. Smells lightly woody and a bit sour as well. This beer tastes tart with a hint of cherry. A much more everyday, easy drinking version of Rodenbach Grand Cru. Maybe some hints of vanilla in the taste, followed by a bit of tannic background. No bitterness just a wonderful marriage of tart and sweet flavors. A hint of alcohol in the finish."
"This is one strange beer that doesn't really fit into what I normally call beer. Came in a bottle like a beer, looked like a beer, but nothing else. Anyway, to the review! Pours a dark red/brown color with very little head that dies off quickly and leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very sweet and was full of apples (or possibly grapes?). Smelled just like a very fruity red wine. I saw where someone else who rated this one said it smelled of apples - I'm not sure - I thought it was grapes at the time, but I can't go back and re-smell it to find out for sure. :-) The taste was very much like the aroma - sweet and full of apple (or grape) flavors. Tasted like a wine with a carbonation bite and a little beer-malt. Gotta say that I enjoyed drinking this beer as the drinkabily was very good and the mouthfeel was the same. Very wierd, but enjoyable at the same time."
"I am impressed by the depth and quality of this beer; surely it is no easy task to put all of those tastes together. I wish I liked this beer. If I bought twelve bottles in January, and opened one per month for a year, by December I might be able to finish one. Still, I am not sure that I would be able to say that I enjoyed it."
" What a unique little brew! Much too sweet for everyday use, but with completely unmatched complexities to the taste. I'd sell my soul for an exact ingredients list. I've never tasted anything like it."
"Charging out of the bottle with champagne-like carbonation, it's a very eye-pleasing brown with garnet highlights. A fine tan head full of little bubbles lays on top of the beer to the end. The smell is somewhat musty, with hints of ripe fruit and an overriding sourness. One sip immediately causes the mouth to pucker, but that's not the end of the story. Raisiny sweetness balances the sour aspect of the beer, making for a very nice drinking experience. For a fairly sour beer, this one is surprisingly drinkable, and I found myself having to resist the urge to throw down big gulps of it. Nice."
"Brownish color reveals the deep center of a ruby when held to the light. The generous head is cola-like and quickly fades back to a mess of foamy islands. The aroma is sickly pungent: Strong, sweet redolence; vinegar and cherries. The flavors are engaging and complex, though awfully sweet. A light sourness, more acetic than tart, is buried beneath an avalanche of cherries, light vanilla, and honey roasted cashews. Almost like a beer sundae with layers of sweet and varying flavors. It could use another kick of sourness to balance just a tiny bit. Nonetheless, it's quite an enjoyable offering and not to be missed."
"At first the aromas are just steely and clean but as it warms up there is a pronounced apple brandy scent with notes of ginger snap on the side. The texture is fizzy and cleanly sweet with more fresh fruit essences on the way down. medium-bodied and complex, with shifting layers of damp earth, barrel fermented pickles, caramel apples and burned slate in the background. Very drinkable hooch."
"Nice reddish brown color with a small head. Smell was tart and vinegary. Sour overtones on the taste, with vinegar hints and red wine hints and just a nice tartness throughout with a woody overtone on the end. Maybe not something I'd drink on a regular basis, but very interesting for a change of pace.."
"Thin head that subsided quickly, for a flemish ale i must have not poured it right as i was carefull to omit the yeast. Color as deep and crimson as red wine. Aroma is sweet and fruity with no malt or hops to be found. Flavor is crazy with the high, soft carbonation causing the sour beer to attack my taste buds. Just enough sweetness to balance the sour flavors. This is a blend of an eight month and eighteen month old ale. The body is light but the carbonation gives an added boost to the strength of the flavors. Very drinkable, and a good beer to expand the horizons of beer flavors."
"($2.99 / 11.2 oz.)"
"Originally sampled on draught 20 March 2002. This is one of the most unique beers I've ever tasted. It is dark reddish brown in color, but light in body. The balance between sweet & tart is excellent. I would have it again. It has a wonderful, fruity aroma. I wouldn't recommend it for any novice beer drinkers, but it's a must try for any serious beer drinker."
"I am still a little new to Flemish Sour Ales, Rodenbach Alexander being the only other one I have tried so far. From what I understand both are good examples of the style. That being the case I am fairly certain this is not a style I am a big fan of. Pours a dark amber/brown with a thick multi-colored head (beige with light brown splotches), with thin lacing. Aroma is alternatingly fruity and sour. The flavor actually reminded me of some Ohio Buckeye Brown that I tried not too long ago that had gone way past the ""best by"" date. Tart and vinegary flavor is tangy throughout. The finish is like an oaky Merlot. I was able to drink most of this in small doses, but I just can't appreciate the style."
"With a slight tingle on the tongue, a thin and watery body, and a moderate length finish, the mouthfeel was lightly dry turning to a bud salivating end. Quite interesting as it lingered in my mouth for awhile Â– like the taste its calmly complex. Very interesting, must be great with food. If you enjoy quality red wines (like myself), check this out. Hop heads and fans of big tasting beers might find it boring or too ""sweet."""
"Duchesse de Bourgogne: a reddish beer sitting under an initially thick off-white head. Great, thick lacing all the way down the side of the glass. Aroma is very sweet with hints of cherries. The taste is very remarkable: mixed sweet and sour that is almost candy like, unfortunately there is an unmistakable vinegar taste/aroma that is present throughout. The taste is very intense, and complex. Before I forget, the aftertaste is dry, and leaves almost a cabernet impression. Some sharp alcohol sensations as well. Overall, the sweetness kills this brew for me, but Iâ€™d give it too a wine drinker to show them what they are missing."
"Purplish brown in color with a initally huge head that fades quickly. Aroma of vinegar was not appropriate. Much sweeter than should be the case for the style. Very remniscent of a Liefman's lambic in that respect. Quite enjoyable, but nothing outstanding. May be a good introduction to the style for a lot of people as it doesn't have the harsh acidity that most new sour ale drinkers get shocked by."
"-F"
"This is my first experience with a Flemish sour ale and I was blown away. It pours with a deep ruby color and a thin white head. The aroma is of red wine vinegar. Some may be turned off by the tart acidic tast, but I love it. Tastes of ripe cherries and red wine with that vinegar-like sourness. This is a style of beer I wish I could see more of."
"Deep and murky, garnet-hued, brown body. Thick (1.5"") foamy head. Retention leaves a bit to be desired, but plenty of lace left floating on top along with a bit on the side of the glass. Smell is very vinous (a little too much, in fact) and fruity (raspberry), with a hint of sourness. A bit of caramel malt present, but hidden deeply under the fruitiness. Rich moderately sour raspberry flavor. Solid backing of caramel malt becomes more noticeable as the brew warms towards room temperature. Sourness also seems to pleasantly increase after warming a bit. Smooth, creamy mouthful. Leaves an oily coating in the mouth. Excellent brew. A style that I find goes extremely well with game birds (pheasant, especially)."
"Beautiful slightly oily feel on the tongue. Carbonation, though seemingly energetic at the pour, is actually quite soft. I could (and would, if it were a little less expensive) drink this all night. It's fantastic, amazing, ethereal even. I've run out of adjectives, I'm flat out in love with this beer."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, if you can stand the sourness. I like it, and would have no problem pairing this with a good meal that would complement it's dry nature."
"Dark brown and hazy beer with stick white lace on top. Aroma consists of malt vinegar, cherries, and some toasted malt. During the first sip, itÂ’s hard not to jolted by the pervasive sourness. After that first sip tough, the whole beer comes into focus. The sour is nicely balanced by medium-bodied roasty malt. Very active carbonation, but the bubbles were small enough so that the effervescence didnÂ’t get in the way. Overall, a very enjoyable beer, especially as it warmed a bit."
"Very rich flavor with storng sourness balancing it out. Complex malt flavor with raisnes, caramel and toffee. Excellent oak character, adds nice complexity and gives a port like character when combined with oxidized malt richness.. Sourness is a bit simplistic but balances out the flavor very well. A well balanced, and very drinkable sour ale. Very rodenbach like, a little less complex, but very nice."
"This beer poured a very dark red color and formed an amazing, huge pillow like head that left some very amazing laticed like lace. Heavy and beautiful style carbonation present. An aroma of malt and wine(but not sure of style). A flavor of malt, wine, and cherries. The finish was rather tart, brought on by the heavy carb and the wine aspect no doubt. It was the finish that hurt this beer in the end from getting a higher rating from me. I felt it hurt the overall flavor of the beer. But it is not a bad beer and worth trying."
"While I looked the looks of this beer, unfortunately that is where the good parts end. Smell was an initial sour smell. While many who review this smell vinegar, I agree but also think it smelled spoiled and rancid. Very musty smell. The taste was like a very sour Chimay Red. Definite vinegar/wine notes. Not my cup of tea. The other 2 people who sampled it with me had the same opinion. I could never drink a full glass of this."
"Relatively clear ruby/brown. Thin layer of tan foam. Aroma consists of sour, unripe fruit and balsamic vinegar notes. Vinous and champagne-like. Some sour cherries poke through...very dry. A unique style indeed. This brew redeemed itself somewhat as it neared room temperature. Do not attempt to drink this right from the fridge."
"Another beautiful example of a Flemish Red Ale. When you first open the bottle you are hit with that sour cherry/lactic acid aroma. It has always amazed me that there are no cherries in these red ales. The color is a beautiful dried cherry red with lots of sparkle and a rich creamy vanilla-white head. The floral/sour aroma is just pure heaven (I have never found the right words for this aroma). The taste starts out tart and ends sour with hints of sweetness. I only wish this ale was a wee bit more tart with the sourness lasting a bit longer. It's not quite a Rodenbach but it's a very nice example of a Red Ale and very drinkable."
"The publican, when I ordered a pint, said ""You remember the first time you had sex? This is better."" It's not, but it's still one outstanding brew."
"Carefully poured from a long-standing bottle it's a surprisingly clear, reddish-brown with orange-ish highlights. The light tan head rises up full at first, but thins shortly. The thin cap, however, holds to the end of the serving - no doubt buoyed by effervescent carbonation - and leaves some noteable lace. The aroma is soft with sugary sweet dark fruit (cherry, raspberry, plum) and an array of gentle lactic notes including vinegar, leather, and barnyard. It's also a touch of vegetal character, and the combination of sugar sweet and vinegar leaves it with a note that's oddly similar to ketchup. It's not bad, but it's sweeter, more chalky, and much less sour than many of the examples from the historic town of Oudenaarde. The body is light but with some dextrins, and offers a crisp and zesty mouthfeel from a very fine, effervescent carbonation. The flavor starts with a combination of tart, sharp fruit (raisin, raspberry, prune, currant, sour cherry) and sweetish caramelized sugar at the front of the mouth, leading into a more winey character with a big woody note and sweet maltiness at mid swallow. It finishes a bit chalky and dry, with a light stickiness throughout the mouth and a sweet & tart note on the tip of the tongue - sometimes followed by an earthy, musty and acidic burp. A very good beer in the Oud Bruin style, posessing a solid oak character and good fruitiness, but possibly a touch sweet. Overall, quite enjoyable."
"Deep crimson hued with a light haze topped by a moderate off white head that leaves respectable lace. Very tart, unripe fruit dominates the aroma, but a constant undertone of wet horse Brettanomyces and old, cheesy hops counter the initial tartness nicely. The flavor consists of a pleasant blend of tart lactic notes and unripe raspberry offset by high residual sweetness due to the paltry hop bitterness. Sour acidity is present as a constant from start to finish. Light in body, and spritzy in mouthfeel. Finishes w/ tartness abruptly ending and sugary sweetness on the tip of the tongue slowly fading. This brew exhibits a good balance of lactobacillus tartness, fruity esters and residual sweetness. The taste grew on me the more I sipped. More ""wild yeast"" character would have added additional complexity."
"Nice Red hue to this brew. But either I had a bad batch or what, I don't know. My first taste of this beer was a taste of a sweet and sour wine flavor. Through out the whole glass of beer, I got a sweet rasin flavor, followed with a sour after taste. No thanks to his brew!"
"What an exceptional Fanders Red. Good head, malty-winey aroma and sweet / tart flavor makes this beer a real winner for the style. With the sporatic supply of Rodenbach these days, it is nice to know there is another Flanders Red one can turn to."
"Excellent and very fun little brew. Deep brwon with atinge of red, nice pillowy head with good lace. Aroma is of cherry, balsamic vinegar and perhaps a bit winey, palate is slightly sweet most mostly tart sweet and then sourness aswell, fruity, quite comlex and very enjoyable."
"Deep brownish red colour with some haze from both the chill and yeast, tight off white lace with a half decent lace. Soft and slightly sour aroma, dry woody almost nutty back ground. Biting crispness within the light yet effervescent and smooth carbonation. Puckering twang of sourness hits the palate, fruity flavours ride along with this and give suggestions of ripe currant and apple peel. A woody dryness sneaks up and dries the mouth is a split second and clear all residual sweetness. Quite the enjoyable Flemish Red â€¦"
"Beautiful ruby-red color with a wispy lace head. The oaken cask conditioning of this beer give the drinker hints of balsamic and red wine vinegar, with some sweetness and floral notes of wine. While you are trying to put a finger on all the flavors, you start tasting the sweet and ""chewier"" texture of the malt. This beer is slightly sour and very highly carbonated, pleasantly so, similar to a lambic... this is bottled happiness."
"This particular sample was brought over from Belgium in 03/2000. Like other Flanders reds, this beer was also aged in oaken casks."
