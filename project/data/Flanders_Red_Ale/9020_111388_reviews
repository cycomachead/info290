"Additionally, I’ve considered that my review here might be a bit biased, due to my new love for Brandon Jones and his contribution to the craft world. However, those thought’s vanished when the nice fellows around me shared the same appreciation for this beer."

"Overall this beer was just fantastic. I can't get over how complex the taste was. Yazoo really outdid themselves with this beer. Glad I have more bottles, and Im already looking forward to next year's release."
