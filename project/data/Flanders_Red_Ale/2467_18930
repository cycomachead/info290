4.18,0.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Final Grade: 4.18, an A-. Panil Barriquee is a thoroughly enjoyable sour - and, speaking from experience, seems to be a good introduction to the style for newbies like me. The balance between the tartness of the various fruit flavours/acetic, and the sweetness of the malts is nothing short of excellent - to say nothing of the masterfully-cloaked ABV, or the pleasant woodiness of the profile, or the fact that it is tasty both when chilled and after warming up to room temperature. I'm still not convinced that sours are up my alley, but I found myself with nothing but compliments for this highly quaffable example. Highly recommended, and something I may get again some time.","thehyperduck","Jun 10, 2012"

Spicing does well to come in midmouth, and even the the alcohol content, none is felt. Some tartness, lightly puckering - some acetic. Nice refreshing feel, and it was a good idea to split this one.

4.62,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"This was bottle 0229 from batch #8. Brewed in 2007. The beer poured a hazy, reddish brown. Topped by a wispy beige head that faded to a thin ring. The aroma is very sour, with acidic, earthy and lightly medicinal notes. From the moment it hits the tongue, this beer is sour throughout. There are hints of cherry fruitiness, a slight medicinal character and an earthiness in the finish. This beer is light bodied, with low carbonation and a refreshing dry finish. I found this beer to be very drinkable, incredibly smooth, despite the sourness. It beats Rodenbach easily.","EPICAC","Nov 20, 2007"
4.4,5.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"An excellent example of the flemish sour style. An extreme example, in fact. This one has a very strong acidic backbone, a sort of geuze/vinegar sourness. Sporadic herbal/farmhouse notes. Some oak and bourbon in the background, but not so much as to distract from the sublime acidity. Poured a light coppery color. This is one to take your time with.

4.09,-1.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"2005 bottling. Murky cherrywood with burnt orange highlights and a fairly poor light tan head. Montmornecy cherry aromas mingle with slight woody funk and yeasty spice notes. Sour cherry flavors predominate with a lactic tartness and an oaky pucker. Feels somewhat thin but a tingling pepperiness keeps things interesting. Tasty enough, but somewhat tame in the end.","orfeu","Sep 14, 2007"
4.35,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to biegaman for sharing this special order of his. Poured a cognac hue with opaque darkness in the glass, very much like a prune juice. Light brown head settled to a wispy film that covered most of the glass surface. Not a lot of carbonation but good lacing. The smell was of sour fruit yet had a rich, tort-like richness in aroma as well. The tart and sour taste was well rounded with a pleasant mouthfeel and finish. After being allowed to warm, there was a boysen-berry taste, still tart / sour, sharp finish but not overly astringent. The eight per cent alcohol was not apparent. Slightly spritzy mouthfeel continued despite air and the apparent lack of visible carbonation; a really interesting beer all around and perfect for the Thanksgiving after-dinner occasion.","ThatWineGuy","Aug 10, 2007"

It was deep reddish amber with some yeast bits floating around. It had no head even after a hard pour at the end - not even a single particle of foam. It was at proper temp so not sure what happened. The smell was pretty good with sour cherries and oaky vanilla but was a little weak. The taste followed the aroma but was weaker than I expected. The taste and the mouthfeel both tasted watered down. Gonna have to try another one to ensure that my sample was good. Overall, not bad but definitely not worthy of the high ratings and #2 Flanders Red Ale rank.

Pours out a beautiful red color, not too much carbonation, a nice off-white head that melts to just a smattering of lacing and thin halo. Aroma is fruit and Brett, very tart and mouthwatering. Tastes as it smells, but sweeter, fruitier, smoother. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, the fruit abounds though not nearly as sweet as Duchesse, great tart and barnyard notes. I love this beer, and even at $25/bottle I'm tempted to get a case for the cellar. Expect this one to age very well.","clickpush","Beers"

The smell is sour fruitiness with dark tones with a woody earthy backround. There's a small amount of horse blanket in the backround as well. Very light bodied with a slight fruitiness, not very sour, still has the woody backround. The mouthfeel is alright, a bit uncharacteristic like water. Overall this was ok, not a bad beer, but $15 worth? I don't think so. It was nice to try this time, but next time I won't purchase it for $15, but maybe $4 or $5.","Erdinger2003","Feb 17, 2007"

4.2,0.7,4,4,4,4,5,"Taste; as with the aroma lots of sour apples and tart cherries. The oak barrel flavor is very good, and there's a definite acidic quality. There's a touch of vinegar that kind of sits in the background, and this finishes with some mild spices and just a touch nutty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very little carbonation. As far as drinkability goes, I don't think that I've ever come cross a beer as drinkable as this one. I love tart flavors, and this style is quickly becoming a favorite of mine, and so far this is the best I've yet had.","RedHaze","Aug 28, 2006"

4.9,17.5,5,5,5,5,4.5,"Taste is the bomb. Sour tart apples blended with cherries and bret yeast. Brief sweetness that keeps it from being too tart. Dry finish that finished fast, very refreshing. For being such a complex flavored and well balanced beer, it has a very clean palate and doesn't linger. Leaves you really for more. Light bodied. I was worried about the carbonation initially, but it is welcome; not overpowering or stinging. I would have rated drinkability slightly higher, but I think one or two of these at a time is the limit. This is truly a beer to enjoy all the flavors and smells.","laintringulis","Aug 17, 2006"
1.24,-70.3,3,1.5,1,1,1,"This beer had a heavily clouded rusted copper colour. The aroma was musty and sour. The mouth-feel was astringent and quite unpleasant. Tastewas the worst part, being very sour, with hints of rotten apple. It was certainly yeast-saturated well beyond any other bottle fermented beer I have tried. With the other strong reviews for this beer, I have to wonder if the one I tried was spoiled?","beerdeity","Aug 06, 2006"
4.18,0.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"2005 Vintage. Pours out a dark brownish red with a lively tan bubbly head. Some speckles and clumps of lace clung to the glass as I drank it. Aroma is full of tart cherries and woody notes. There was some sweetness as well adding a touch of balance. The taste is similar with tart cherries and woody oak notes dominating. There is a light sweetness in the middle before the dry sour woody finish. Soft carbonation. Easy drinking for the style and quite refreshing. A good all around sour beer.","meathookjones","Jul 26, 2006"
4.97,19.2,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied but very firm. The beer is a tour de force of sweet, sour and funky yeastyness. The beer is acidic at times and smooth at others. The beer is very enjoyable. From the very first smell until long after the glass was empty I enjoyed this beer. The beer is a bit pricey but well worth the treat. I will be purchasing this beer at a later point.","nlmartin","Jul 14, 2006"

Smell is sweet, sour cherries/fruits, oak, spice, some caramel, really nice and tart. Taste is amazing, caramel and cherries, sour/tart blast through the middle, really intense, wood/oak, little alcohol in the finish and maybe some light chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with really low and smooth carbonation. Absolutely fantastic, one of the better sour ales I've come across, and from a completely unexpected source. Thanks for splitting it DrJay!","Viggo","Jun 05, 2006"

4.41,5.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ruby color with a filmy head. Vibrant Flemish Sour aroma, cheese laden, with hints of coconut and wood, loads of fruits (cherries especially) and light malt. Distinctions and characteristics aromatically in Flemish Sours are always hard to pinpoint, but this particular one, from Italy, is very vibrant. Unbelievable balance of lactic and acedic acid, fruit, wood, sourness, along with a light coconut character, which I just love in beers.","Crosling","Mar 12, 2006"

The smell was nicely sour and tart with notes of wood and a touch of lactic acid and a hint of malt. The smell was very persistent. The taste was sour and tart with flavors from wood and notes of tart fruit and a hint of spiciness. The mouthfeel was very dry and tart with medium body and strong carbonation. A light tartness lingered on the tongue. This was a very nice and easy to drink Flanders style ale.","UncleJimbo","Feb 25, 2006"
4.09,-1.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Taste: Strange, even though the acidity seemed less present in the nose, it was there big time in the taste. The smoothness of the cask aging showed up nicely in the finish.

3.95,-5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Aroma is vinegar, sour cherries and tart fruits. Reddish brown in color with thumb thick tan head. Fore is quite sour and musty and is followed quickly by tart cherries and unripe apple, strong notes of those baby corns, used in Oriental cooking, stewed in cooking wine. Wood notes pop out in the middle along with musty barnyard notes. Finish is sour and dry and leaves the tongue feeling cleansed. I personally feel this would have benefited by a little more sweetness beneath the sour notes as it hints at it and that promise is enticing, but undelivered.","Jredner","Jan 27, 2006"
4.39,5.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit slick with a really mellow carbonation that allows it to slide across the palate and into my beer lovin stomach. Quite the tasty flanders red here. It's easy to sit and adore a 750ml bottle of this fine Italian brew. Well worth the bigger price tag, Panil deserves praise for creating a truly tasty beer. Thanks to Shelton for bringing this over to the sour beer lovers like me in the US. Now that the bottle is almost gone....it's time to seek out more!","orbitalr0x","Jan 23, 2006"
4.37,4.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Cloudy toffee colour with a thin tan head. Good maltiness in the aroma, but this was overpowered by sour fruit, white grapes, and wood. Strong acidity and sour cherries in the flavour - still, a lot of fruit and malt character carry this one a long way. Very tasty with just a bit of caramel. Dry, puckering finish with a smooth texture for the style. Even though it's very tart, it still feels quite balanced due to the sweetness from the malt and fruit qualities.

4.47,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear burgandy. Thin but frothy tan head. This dissipates to a nice looking collar that sticks around for the long haul. Beautiful nose for the style. A blend of sweet and sour that tantalizes. Bright sour cherry tones and an underlying brown sugar sweetness meld together nicely on the nose. Also notice some acidity in the aroma. A barrel derived tannic bite is present and adds a sharpness to the profile. To me, and I'm no expert on this style, the good Flanders Red Ales demonstrate a nice dynamic of sweet and sour. And this one has got just that. There's a little bit of a sticky molasses sweetness. Brown Sugar. Nice qualities. On the flip side, you've got tart cherry notes. Some light vinegar like sourness. And a barrel derived tannic bite that really adds a nice sharpness to it all. Great depth of flavor in this beer. Body is around medium and the carbonation lightly spritzy. LIGHTLY being the key word there. This traditional Flanders Red is quite enjoyable.","Bighuge","Dec 26, 2005"
3.82,-8.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Flavor is a lip puckering sourness of cherries and blackberries. Oddly though, the sourness kind of gathers toward the back of the mouth and not so much the lips. More of a pleasing sour than a painful negative one--kind of like Sourpatch Kids candies. Yeast comes out as mildyl pungent in the finish. Medium body that leans a bit thin--but appropriate for the style. Might just be me but I find it a bit granular as well. Nice dessert beer that is nice and drinkable.","MuddyFeet","Beers"
4.44,6.5,4,5,4.5,4,4,"The flavor is tart cherries, and earthy. It is a bit yeasty and medicinal. It is medium-full in body, acidic and tart. It is not overpoweringly sour, but just about right.

4.45,6.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"mouthfeel is perfect, as is the sourness.. clean without a woody, leathery must. young, but insanely drinkable (for a FSR) in said youth. citric sourness like a yuzu fruit coats my throat on the way down and causes a serious twitch. hops seem to mildly accentuate the whole fresh vibe and creates an overall terrific sour red. gotta seek out more new reds like this and drink them asap.","goodbyeohio","Nov 22, 2005"
4.39,5.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer is so much better as it warms, it's incredible. When I do another of these, I'll start drinking it at 60F. This was @ 50F when I started this time. As a Flanders Red ale, it's very approachable. I've certainly had much more sour beers. This is nicely complex, without being a jumble of Belgian funk. (Which I indeed love). So, to sum it up, it's very good, I wouldn't mind seeing a bit more funkiness and complexity, but I'd recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing it.","jakester","Nov 19, 2005"
3.97,-4.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is one I'll have to revisit to fully form an opinion. As of now, I didn't really think it lived up to the hype, which may be impossible, but anyway... A beautifully dark, almost purplish red color, no real head. Smell is of dark fruits - cherries, figs, other ripeness. A bit of tartness is detected but not your typical (for the style) nose-singeing abrasion. Taste is very mellow, yet complex. You can tell they were patient with this beer and let it age to where they wanted it. Very well rounded. Fruity notes, as discussed before. A nice tartness, and an excellent earthyness. Funky, and musty. Nice complexity added from the oak aging. Some wood and vanilla character in there. I'd recommend splitting the bottle though. I just went for it, and I usually have no problem with drinking a big bottle like this, but it just seemed to get sweeter and sweeter as I was drinking it. A real merlot-ish grapeyness to it that didn't really seem to help the beer in my opinion. Dry mouthfeel, but odd combined with that sweet fruityness. Interesting, for sure, but definately a stretch for the style and a challenge to any pallate. I just thought this one was full of flavor at first, but after a glass or so, your tongue gets used to it and it became a little one dimentional. I'll try it again sometime and see what I think then.","twelvsies","Oct 25, 2005"

5,19.9,5,5,5,5,5,"750ml bottle, 2005 edition. This brew pours a murky brown with ruby tints. The head is large, fluffy and tan. There are vast rivers of carbonation rising to the top with such force they make the head shake and vibrate, causing it to pop and grown like an old house. I have never seen and heard a beer to this before. The aroma literally fills the room from the second the bottle cap is popped off. It is sweet and sour at the same time with oak penetrating everything. The taste is a battle between sour and sweet, in which the momentum is constantly shifting. The climax of this battle takes place during the swallow, where sour is the clear victor. Sweet doesn't give up though, skirmishing still takes place long after the swallow, and proves to be the most masterful part of the taste. The mouthfeel is one of the best I have ever felt (it is up there with Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout and Black H2O by Minneapolis Town Hall). It is rich creamy and smooth, lending itself well to the fullness and rich flavors of the beer. Overall, this is a must have for every BA.","KarlHungus","Oct 14, 2005"
4.75,13.9,4.5,4.5,5,4,5,"Pours a deep brown color with ruby hues and a finger of tan head that falls to a quarter inch over top of the brew. Nose is awasome. Very nice balance of sour cherry, sour, deep woodyness. Very nice. Nothing is strong or overwhelming, just really enticing. Flavor is slightly puckering initially and right after the swallow. I get a darker, deeper flavor than other flanders reds. Highly enjoyable. Definate sour cherry is there. Wood notes come through more on the finish, rounding this one out very well. The feel is moderate with a moderate to active carbonation. It leaves a bit of sticky spit in my mouth. Incredibly drinkable beer. No hint of 8% alcohol. I really like the deepness of the flavor. It helps hold the cherry and sour in check a little. I like it and will get it again if I see it.","kmpitz2","Oct 07, 2005"
4.23,1.4,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This one pours a brown color with a perfect medium head with great retention and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma has a definate sourness with a lot of cherry and hints of wood. Smells nice. The flavor is very sour. Very sour. The cherries are definately there but the sourness takes the forefront. There is also a strong woody character that comes in with the cherries. The wood really comes throughthe more I drink - it gives it a strange flavor and mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is moderate to thick and the drinkability is good if you like sour beers. Sour beers aren't really my thing, but this is a good one.","clvand0","Sep 27, 2005"
4.65,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" of tan head over the deep burgundy brew. Head lasts nicely, with plentiful small bubbles helping in the preservation, with sticky lacing. Aroma has a grape bubble gum thing going on which, upon further examination, sorts itself into some serious sour notes coupled with some grape essences. The taste is tart upfront, but held in some semblence of a balance by the strong oak flavors and fruitiness as well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb for the style. I think this is one of the most approachable Flanders Reds that I have had. Very nice.","ppoitras","Sep 13, 2005"

Charming oak nose, chocolate soaked cherries gets in the path of the assertive leafy, branches woodiness. Clean fermentation, no apparent spiciness. Very vinous with a broad arrange of fruit touched, going from the berries to the grapes and pineapple. Incredible sweet and tart interplays transform your mouth into a carry-on euphoria state. Candyish at first, but quickly turning into a huge tart bite, were talking La Folie tart and maybe more. Huge lactic and acetic character, sharp balanced wood flavors, delicate cherry find their way, fleshy, still fresh. Hidden alcohol, stupendous and flawless balance, evoluting flavor development with bricks over bricks building a wall to perfection. Moderate carbonation level, lasting glorious aftertaste, medium bodied, sharp tart finish. Delicious and up there with the greatest oud bruins.","Rastacouere","Aug 28, 2005"

4.25,1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability and Notes  It is drinkable to a point, after awhile the sourness builds up and the beer becomes less drinkable. The flavors are wonderful and complex, but avoid it if you are one of those people who are completely adverse to sour beers. I myself cant handle the sourness of Cantillon beers, but this is nowhere near as intense.

5,19.9,5,5,5,5,5,"I don't really know this beer yet, but the operatic clash of plump, pulpy fruit and relentless iron and acidity seems legitimate: no seams, no ego.

I was half expecting this to not live up to the hype, but I am thoroughly enjoying this beer and absolutely wishing that I had a lot more of it. All of the flavors in this beer are in such an harmonious balance, each flavor melds with and into the others making a complex satisfying whole. This beer combines a great sourness with a bit of earthy funkiness and lots of chewy malt notes all together to form a splendid tipple.

4.88,17,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Exceptional in every possible way. Light reddish soda-coloured with a small head of off-white that held well with good retention and lacing.

Vinegar, milk, lemon, barngrass, horse blanket, cobwebs, whole spiders, who knows? Taste is a wonderful blend of funky brett flavors, sour acidic cherry notes, and vanilla oakiness with some boozy hints in the mix as well. totally artisinal and you can just feel the love that went into this beer with each and every sip. Lush carbonation is spirtzy and dry and just glides across your 'buds with ease. I did not want this beer to end, and wanted much much more of it, so indeed the drinkability is phenomenal as well.

Ah, but the smell and taste more than made up for that. Drinkability I would say is very good, I could drink that all night if we had more and it weren't so expensive.

Woody and sour in the nose, those traits follow on the palate. An oaky sourness is very prominent up front and then finishes with a dry, fruity flavor....plum, I think. It stated that it was fermented in cognac & bordeaux barrels, but I got little of these flavors other than in the overall profile.
