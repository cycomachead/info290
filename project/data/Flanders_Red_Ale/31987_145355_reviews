"This was a very good Flanders red.  Nice balance between sour and tart.  Very drinkable. I would definitely seek out more of this."

"Overall: An amazing beer, just happened to find it on the bottle menu and thought it sounded wonderful.  And it really is wonderful.  Sour without being hard to drink, something I would love to drink a ton of.  I know this will be the only time I get to drink this, and that is disappointing, because I would gladly buy bottles for home.  Within reason of price, of course."
