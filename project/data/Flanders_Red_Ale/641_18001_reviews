"Pours a darker reddish tinted brown, moderate cap of off white head, decent retention. Scent brings berries, tart cherry, red wine and apple cider vinegar, lightly herbal and medicinal. First sip brings blended vinegar and berry notes, can pick out each individually but quite even in the taste... tangy and tart, lightly sweet. Medium bodied, a splash bubbly. Not as bold on the cherry front as i had hoped, mild vinegar and bright berry notes."

"A giant taste of fruit cherry and strawberries with a good sour/acid balance. This isn't that sour at all actually and is extremely palatable and just the right amount of minimal carbonation, with perfect ABV drinkability. Just flat out great to drink and I would have another instantly."
"Pleasant prickly mouthfeel."
"Pretty dry and refreshing. Damn good and drinkable."
"D - Nice stuff."
"This beer is tart. I'll go ahead and call it sour but really its tart. Its the kind of sour that makes you pucker your lips or when you feel it in the corners of your mouth. Its serious sour / tart. I can detect some sweetness in there through the sour still. The cherries are subtle in the flavor but you can tell they are there. Beer is medium bodied, finishes COMPLETELY. This is another palate cleansing beer. I really enjoyed this beer, phenomenal. I did not think I would like it, but I'm glad I had one."
"Soft and creamy mouthfeel is nice. There's woody astringency. Sour milk, light horseblanket, sweet. This is pretty thin, not so dry--very fruit juicy."
"Served in a wine glass, this is a nice deep purplish amber color with a thin head and a moderate amount of lacing. Smell is a strong cherry smell, kind of like a cough drop, with a slight oak scent as well. Taste is more of the very strong cherry, more tart that sweet, doesn't leave a lingering syrpupy aftertaste. Hard to taste much other than the cherry, although there is a decent malt underlying. Mouthfeel is medium with a fairly high carbonation and a light effervescent feel in the motuh. The only other Kriek I've had was Lindeman's, and this is definitely a better beer. Goes well with desert, especially chocolate."
"Drinkable? I'll pass."
"A very drinkable beer, a bit better than Vichtenaar and on par with the Duchesse in my estimation. All three definitely worth a try."
