"Overall: A very good brew, more sour than most I have had of this style."
""
""
"On tap at The Bruery poured into taster. Appearance is hazy brown-red with a tall white head that settles to a ring. Some lacing. Aroma is a little funky, but mostly sour, led by tart cherries, red wine vinegar, wood, and leather. Taste is strongly sour with acidic and vinegar notes. Some woody bitterness and malty sweetness offer some balance. Medium bodied, slightly slick, lively prickly carbonation, long puckering finish."

"O - This is a very assertive sour beer.  In the original Belgian versions, I prefer examples that have more malt complexity and less over-the-top sourness, but this is a well-made, clean tasting beer that has its own good qualities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was pretty good."
""
""
"Beautiful red pour. One of my favorite sours to date as the smell and taste seem ideally tuned to my palate.  Mouthfeel was slightly astringent but was the only fault I could find with this beautifully crafted beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This a nice well balanced sour.  Complex blend of sour fruit with good barrel notes.  Sourness is prominent but not extreme."
"Sampled by accident. Fantastic for the style. Not for me though honestly"
""
""
""
""
"Overall fantastic and very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a strong Flanders Red from the Bruery. Lots of bracing bitterness with just enough sweetness for balance."

"2013. Tasting as tart as I remember, pucker is really asserting itself over the fresh version."
"It's a good beer ... it's a great beer, really, but I cant help but say that if you've had one Bruery sour, you've had most of them. Excuse my ignorant-to-sours palate, but honestly, there are just a lot of the similar flavors. I do love their yeast or whatever the hell they use, though... this is (of course) puckering, with a nice bit of oak barrel character and some dark fruit and malt sweetness. I'm glad to have tried this beer, but I just would have liked it a lot more had it been my first Bruery beer. At this point, they're starting to taste too similar and just not worth their $20 a 750ml price tag. Regardless, if you like sours, you'll like this one -- Bruery still has some of the best out there."

"I am new to sour beers...I have had better...good level of funk with mild to moderate tartness...I would say this beer has a mild sour feel to it...very drinkable"
""
""
""
"Overall: Very solid sour"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The first time I tried Oude Tart my mind was blown. I've since discovered a new world of sour beer, but this one still stands out. It's sour, but balanced, and hits that sour note in the back of your mouth just right."

"Pours an almost burgundy color with a very thin cream colored head. Smells very sour with hints of tart cherries, figs, and red wine. A slight hint of wood. The flavor is sensationally balanced.  Very sour, but also very sweet. The fruit character comes shining through. I know this will make my tummy hurt."
""
""
""
""
""
"A definite winner from The Bruery."

"amazing flanders, really sour right from the get go.  Lot of cherry and vinegar as you would expect, but the oak aging tweaks it down leaving you ready for more."
""
""
""
"Pours a ruby red hue with a two finger off white head, the smell is leather, oak, funk and cherries, the feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and coats the mouth with morello cherries, funk, oak and finished quite dry and tart and overall what a top drop and take on this style would buy again glad I drank fresh cheers."

"I expected to like this beer, and was not disappointed.  Of course its expense makes it a questionable buy, but it's availability might dictate a purchase when available, but would probably want to hold for a good reason to drink."

"O - This is a really well put together beer. It doesn't get much better than this for the style to be honest. It's a toss up between this, Rodenbach Grand Cru, and La Folie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyable sipping sour that isn't too sour and keeps you coming back for more."
""
"great sour here"
""
""
"Overall: what was I waiting for? This beer is every bit as good as the originals from Flanders, and without a doubt the best US version of the style I've encountered. Intensely sour, this isn't a training wheels sour"
""
"O -  Very good Flanders Red Ale, maybe the best I've had of this style (sorry New Glarus).  Sour notes are well balanced with sweet malt, fruit, and oak.  I will search out another Oude Tart for the cellar.  Prost!"

"Overall- I am not really a fan of most sours. I love the Duchesse de Bourgogne, but that beer has a fair amount of sweetness to it as well and more of a balsamic taste. This Oude Tart tastes extremely sour and I'm sure it would be great if that's all you're into, but it doesn't taste...GOOD. Not something I'd like to drink again."

"Aroma is leathery, cherry and acetic acid. taste is oaky, fruity and tart. Body is medium with just the right amount of carbonation. Really a very good Flanders Red. I hadn't had this style for a while, but should get it more often. Maybe not this in Amsterdam very obscure variety but rather a more easily available  Rodenbach or Duchesse De Bourgogne."

"Overall, just a really well-done Flanders Red. Personally, I prefer my sour beers to pack a pretty good wallop, and this one certainly delivers. Over a full bottle, you get more than enough puckering to really get that electric sour fix. I'd love to try the version with cherries some day, since the base beer seemed to impart notes of cherry to begin with."

"The Bruery is best when they stick to basic. but unique styles IMO. This is a perfect example. This and the regular saisons have always been my personal favorites from their lineup. Really well made that does not try to be over the top, just because they can be. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Opaque brown-red, pours with a decent relatively long lived head. Sour cherry and oak aroma. One of the more sour sours. Toasted oak and sour fruit. Dry and full bodied. Preceded this with La Folie, which I found to be less complex, less sour and less full bodied."

"Overall I'll seek this one out again. Expensive beer, but well worth the money. Benchmark sour."
""
""

"Second Tasting notes: I had a lot of cranberry as it warmed."

"An outstanding Flemish red especially from an American brewery. Very sour with a light sweetness for balance. Worth seeking out."

"O- Outstanding Flemish sour, not too sweet, oak did seem to dominate my palate as I got to the end of the bottle, but you can definitely pick out the complexity of each layer of flavors. If there weren't so many more beers out there to try and I had a lot more money I would buy 2 or 3 more. You can't go wrong with a sour from The Bruery."
"Tip of the tongue tartness with the swollow being more mellow and open, oak and a small sourness lasting into the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Some of the class Flanders Red flavors of red currents with a sweet-tart balance and low carmel in a supporting malt body. I like that this one is fairly strongly tilted towards the tart and lightly sweet making it an immensely food friendly."
""
"Perhaps one of the best of only a few American Flanders Red Ales I have had. Authentic tartness with that slight vinegar and diacetyl that I find in beers like Rodenbach and Duchesse."

"O: Incredible. Unabashed sour character, with clear, natural cherry notes that last on the palate, the barrel aging surely contributing to the sourness and the smoothness. Quality throughout. I wouldn't think twice about spending my money on this beer again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I: It's delicious a lot of funk and complexity."
""

"Overall, a nicely done sour, but I don't think this is very similar to alot of other flanders reds out there. Its much more sour."
""
""
""

"Overall, terrific. Supremely drinkable, refreshing and tons of tartness. Along with La Folie, this is one of my favorite all time Sours."

"Pours an opaque, slightly reddish chocolate brown with a fairly thick, though effervescent, light tan head. Sour apple dominates the strong aroma. Flavor is very tart - you may exercise facial muscles you never knew you had! Underlying hints of caramel and oak support the bold tartness. Texture is smooth and firm, if not too fizzy. Pucker up, sweetie!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To me, this is just too damn sour. It's hard to focus on any other component of this beer - definitely the most sour beer I've ever had (a lot). Berry, red fruit, but really just acidic and incredibly sour. A little more palatable as it approaches room temperature but still a bit extreme. Not my thing at all."

"Reddish amber hued with a minuscule head of white foam partially covering the top of the beer. Sour aroma of tart cherries is very pungent. The mouth is highly carbonated and the intense bitterness pricks the tongue and yet there's a nice dry finish. There's definitely tart cherries and a horse blanket element in the taste."

"Overall, this is a very solid beer. At the $17 price range it is a little hard to justify purchasing this beer regularly, but I will every now and again. A good example of the style but I still feel like there are better examples out there to be had."

""
""

"O-really nice representation of the style, nice flavor"
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750mL bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
""
"A genuinely balanced, but still big and saucy sour red ale, the well-rounded fruity tartness let out to play, but not at the cost of an overwrought palate pillaging. The wood treatment is complex, understated, and just about right. Quite an apt representation for the style, but all other things are not equal with this offering - the serving size and sticker price cannot compete with those venerable in-class imports, I'm afraid."

"O: For a sour this is world class. Everything you'd expect from this style is there...and more."
"The feel gets all the complexity and (saying it again) depth of this style. Acidic and dry, the medium body is yet creamy. It's moderate carbonation carries through to add a bite on the tongue even while it flows so smoothly, and it carries a certain brightness as well."
"tough sell with cheap bottles of Rodenbach on the same shelf but solid beer from start to finish and I can easily recommend it"
""
"This beer is the first sour that I've tried. The only description that I can utter is: WOW! The depth of flavors and the complexity on the palate is extraordinary. Having had no experience with sours, much less Flanders Reds, made this one amazing beer to taste. A must have."
""
"A very good representation of the Flanders Red Ale Style. As complex as this style can be I think it is hard to find one that can be well balanced and easy drinking. Look no further because this is it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Good Flanders red. Enjoyed this better than most others I've had. Duchesse is tastier with this being less complex but just as enjoyable. Price point is always an issue but I won't beat the dead horse."
""

"Glad to finally try this slightly aged; it's drinking well."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a small fairly dense light khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big ripe sour cherry, cranberry, raisin, prune, red grape, oak, vinegar, leather, clove, toast, brown sugar, light vanilla, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast and oak notes with a great malt/acidic balance; and great strength. Taste of big ripe sour cherry, cranberry, raisin, prune, red grape, vanilla, oak, vinegar, toast, clove, brown sugar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice amount of acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, red grape, raisin, prune, vanilla, oak, clove, brown sugar, vinegar, leather, musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of sour fruity/funky yeast and oak flavors; with a great balance of malt/acidity and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and nicely acidic/crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Flanders red ale style! All around fantastic complexity and balance of sour fruity/funky yeast and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the great malt/acidity balance. An extremely amazing offering."

"O/D - A well made Flemmish Red. A step below Rodenbach vintages, but definitely showing similar qualities. Tasty and easy to drink. Worthy of the hype and price tag."
""
""
"one of the better examples of the style from the united states, I have no idea how ive not had it do date. well, yes I do, its over 20 bucks a bottle, and therefore prohibitively expensive, but its the holidays so what the heck. the color is a murky dark red, darker than raspberry jam, lighter than traditional brick red, with one nice inch of white bubbly head on it. it smells of fresh and dried red fruit, from cranberries with their tartness to cherries with their sweetness, even prunes or raisins with their wrinkly gumminess. its lovely all the way through, with a ton of acid making my mouth water for a taste. the flavor is great too, all the fruit into one really sour brew. its got that classic flanders front of tongue acidity, almost too much, and this is a bottle to share for that reason. it puckers me right up, demanding perseverance from my taste buds. long dry finish, didn't think that was possible until this beer. the fruit is nice, the red malt is bigger, and the ph has to be real low. well carbonated body makes it fizzle and snap in my mouth, and the acidity prevents major drinkability. I am intrigued enough by this beer to drink a lot of it, and its quite enjoyable, but at this price their are other serviceable options to get my flanders fix. top quality as always from the bruery."

"This is a more than a decent sour red, but it lacks the sweet, bready malt backbone that really differentiates the ""Flemish Red"" style from the rest of the sour styles. Judging on taste alone, this is a very solid and aggressive, albeit not the most complex sour that I've had. I'd definitely recommend this beer to only the most devout sour fans. Despite what the name says, this is definitely more than just merely ""tart""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall can easily understand why this is such a highly revered beer. Really shines in the cherry and sour departments. Paired with some vanilla bean ice cream is delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Really good beer and a solid representation of the style. Definitely worth at try but if you're worried about your wallet, grab one of the aforementioned Flemish Reds. You won't miss much other than a tick."

"Poured at the tasting room. Brownish red pour, mostly clear, with a small white head that recedes quickly. Big time sour vinegar aroma, stronger than any other sour I have had. Maybe some light sweet apples and cherries as well. Flavor follows with a massive hit of sour, some light funky vinegar, and a bit of sour fruits. There is a big dry oak influence here that differentiates this from others I have had in the style. Light sweet malts remain on the palate. This was heavier than the Berazzled, and definitely hit the taste buds hard. Enjoyable."

"O/D-Another expensive Bruery beer I initially regret buying and am subsequently satisfied after imbibing."
""
""
""

""
""

"Overall: still learning my way around the sours. This delivers for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Once again, another Bruery offering that I just don’t understand. 20 bucks for a bottle that doesn’t provide complexity as it warms, staying the same few flavors the entire way. I think its more of a 10 dollar bottle, not a 20. A decent beer for a sour fix, but not when its costing you 20 bucks. Grab a Rodenbach Grand Cru for half the price instead."
""
""
"This is really an exceptional sour. I really love how complex and sour it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow, this one was a lot more sour than I was expecting. Definitely the most sour of its style for me. Nice cherry and sour flavors in there, but just a tad sour for me - would prefer it if it were a bit more balanced. Still a quality brew of the style and quite tasty. I am wondering if this might be a bit older than my 2012 estimate from the carbonation and flavor profile."

"I hate reviewing these beers as it's hard to explain why one is better than another. This is an great example of the style that falls into the intense and strong side. It isn't going to top the kind and it's priced at nearly twice the price, but I'm digging it, BIG time."

"Overall a very nice Flanders ale. Very, very similar (I don't think I could tell the difference to be honest) to some of the better known American Wild Ales like Russian River's supplication and consecration."
"Overall, it was tough to decide what we enjoyed most about this brew, as it was a tossup between its nose, its flavoring, and its soft, fluffy feel. From the first whiff you get an idea of just how high quality and well thought out this beer is. The aroma is subtle and nuanced, but yet still knocks you to the ground with its bright sourness of fruit, wood, dangerously deep grain, and yeasty funk. The flavoring follows as best as anything could, with the same interplay of wild depth, generous fruit and tartness, and inlaid woody warmth. The flavors are sweet, but effectively tart, with the final blend striking an amazingly easy sipping balance that defies warmth and environment. This is helped along by the mouthfeel that affords high carbonation and nice prickle, appropriate to the level of pucker, but also gives big frothy creaminess on the swirl around the mouth, helping to add buoyancy and body to the diving deepness of the flavor profile. This is an incredible beer for the style, and for the brewery’s sour/tart lineup, and if you are a fan of either, then this is a must-have."

"Glad to be finally trying this stuff, especially considering my man Ryan has been lauding it forever. It pours a clear garnet (roby tones...?) topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises tart cherry, red wine vinegar, mild oak, light graham cracker, and a bit of sour blue raspberry. The taste brings in more of the same, the tartness in full form for most of the show, though a vein of very mild molasses seems to enter stage left near the finish and stays through the encore, mellowing things slightly and dancing provocatively with the graham cracker and oak. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine sour, not quite what I would think of when ""Flanders Red"" is spoken, but a thoroughly enjoyable American take on the classic style. Good times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: One of the best examples of an American made Flanders Red. Very nice mix of flavors with very nice balance. While not quite on the level of Rodenbach, I always relish the chance to have this, a very enjoyable brew."

"Not the sourest beer I've had (Tart of Darkness destroyed my palate more than this one did), but probably one of the 3 or 4 sourest. The flavor lacks some of the complexity I have experienced in other sours and it could really use just a bit more sweetness for balance. Nevertheless, I know those BAs for whom sours can never get sour enough probably love this beer. I'll have to drink this bomber over two days, otherwise it will destroy the lining of my stomach."

"This has the distinction of being the first sour beer that I've thouroughly enjoyed. Very complex. I'm looking forward to trying the cherry variation."
""
""

"Appearance is dark red - brown with a short head. Its` nose hits right away with vinegar, dried fruits and funk. For the taste, there are cherries, certainly a tartness as the name implies, a little flavor of red wine too. Mouthfeel is medium, rich, it makes you pucker and some of the sourness lingers. But, it is a in pleasant manner. Had this a few times, but wanted to finally take some notes. It is nice that it is now easy to get in the New York area."

"""Pleasantly sour with hints of leather, dark fruit, and toasty oak from extended aging in oak barrels."""

"D/O: A fine approximation of the sour ales of Flanders, Belgium; this beer takes a more careful approach than some in the way it is short on overt sweetness. The malt, yeast, and bacteria all cooperate nicely leading to a final product that seeks not to challenge but to showcase some traditional qualities. None shine brighter in the final tally than the wood influence."
""

""

"O: I found this beer to be fairly approachable for the Flanders Red Ale style and a great example of it - though if you have no interest in sour beers this is one to avoid. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and it had just the right amount of tartness/sourness and acidity."
"O: This beer is pleasantly sour and tart but in no way over the top overpowering so it's rather drinkable compared to other beer in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - The aroma is excellent and the flavor profile isn't far behind."
""
"Single finger off white head on a clear red brown and amber body with excellent lacing. Aroma of cola, oak, brown sugar, candied orange, dark fruit including fig raisins and cherry. Flavor is less complex but still very good with mostly sour cherries, some brown sugar and oak notes throughout. Fairly thick and oily body and light carbonation. Simple but good. Seemed a little watery but its hard to critize this one too much."

"Bottle shop manager near me, upon hearing that I was going to share this beer, told me ""Don't. Drink it with your wife. You'll thank me later."" Well, he was dead right. It pours even deeper than ruby, with a mahogany tint to it. Not as much of a tart smell as I've gotten in others, but the oaken notes come right out of the bottle and hit you from a few feet away. You also get the barrel in the taste, and it's not so sour that it curls your eye shut. It has a perfect balance of everything, and even has a bit of alcohol burn that I have never tasted in a sour. It has a clean finish, and doesn't linger past its welcome."
""

""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light without a ton of carbonation. Decent. Overall, not a bad sour. A little sweeter than I was expecting and kind of one dimensional. Worth a try, though."
"Overall: Excellent beer and on of the best American versions of the style. It's heavier on the lactic sourness and lighter on the sweetness and stone fruit flavors than some of it's Belgian counterparts, but that's not necessarily a complaint. This is a great beer that's worth seeking out"

"This is my first The Bruery offering at a wild ale. I am use to RR or Crooked Stave sours, so I am that dick teacher who gives C's for a B work. This beer is a little dry for me. Perhaps the first year of vintage is working against this one; it will be interesting to compare against the newer vintages I have in the cellar. Overall, I am happy, but not thrilled for this. I am looking forward to the next few wilds that The Bruery has for my palate."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It overall is not bad and the enjoyable aspects are very enjoyable. By Flanders standards it hits the mark but isnt a standout. Worth trying and despite my gripes and displeasure at some of it's character I am glad I have another bottle or 2 to enjoy with some more age."

"Ouded Tart really does all it says in its name. It is tart with the taste of dried acidic and succulent fruits; but also gives aged ""savory"" notes that shows the beer's patience and maturity. I love the beer for all it is, although its depth is just off of Rodenbach examples."

"It was sour and tart, but they did a nice job controlling that. The sour and tartness never really got full strength. Same story with the oak. This beer is on the pricey side. Is it worth it? Only if you like sours and you want something different to drink."

"Served a deep, auburn colored body with only a slim, bubbly covering on top. Tart, acidic fruity aroma...cherry, vinegar, brown sugar, dry floral notes, and a warm spiciness. Juicy, tart flavor: sour apple, berry, light wood, some wine, and not too much sweetness from the malt. Dry and lightly effervescent making for a super refreshing beverage. Very, very satisfying and delicious."
"O: Excellent."
""
""
""

"Awesome brew! I can't believe this is the first time I've had it... Highly recommended and can't wait for next years release. Exactly the beer I wanted."
"Overall: this beer is delicious. The taste and mouthfeel really stood out. The appearance was lacking, and the smell was somewhere in the middle. This is one of my favorite Bruery beers. If you like mouth puckering sour like I do then you'll really enjoy this."

"O: A nice beer. Tasty, and since I have two more bottles, I'll drink again. Not my favorite of the style. Not even close to Cuvee de Jacobins Rouge as far as flavor. On par with Rodenbach Grand Cru, but at double the cost, it's a tough sell."

"Hazy reddish-brown pour into a goblet, capped off with a good inch of foamy eggshell head that retained and laced well. Cherry and apple in the nose, notes of caramel and vanilla, lesser hints of leather and citric and acetic acid. Decent balance of sweet and tart in the taste, cherry, apple, lemon, plum, a good malty base keeping everything in check, some leathery tannins, and some woody dryness. A little bit of souring vinegar, but nothing too puckering. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Overall pretty nice, and from the Bruery, one of the few that hasn't let me down."
"As it warms, its simplicity emerges."
"D - It's alright as far as sours go, though I wouldn't seek it out again (nor pay the high price). There are much better examples of the style. Entirely too simple."
"If this had been a $5 bottle I wouldn't have minded so much, but this is a $20 bottle of beer! Do not waste your money! It is definitely not worth it."
""
""
"Very nice example of the style- beautifully tart with just enough sweetness to give it balance, and a lush fruitiness framed beautifully by the sourness. A very pretty pour, dark brown with a slight plum cast and just a little head, though the carbonation is fine. Tart nose of delicate cherry, red currant, damp earth, and leather. The taste is quite tart, with a bit of slightly spicy sweetness, particularly on the finish. More notes of bright fruit, with tastes of blackberries, raspberries, cherries, and currants. A touch of brown sugar and leather rounds it out. Very smooth and quite a great sipper. Well done!"
""
""
""
"Deep opaque mahogany, with a light brown head. Acetic nose, some oak barrel, a whole load of cherry and other berries and a gentle sweetness. Taste is lightly acetic, tart berries and cherries again, some oak and more barrel sweetness. Medium high carbonation, lighter feel. A very nice Flemish red, epitomizes simplicity and subtlety. Quite enjoyed this."
""
""
""
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Some more carbonation would make it better. One of the better sours I have had lately."
""
""
"Overall: A really tasty and full-flavored beer, but definitely not a complex one. Maybe if the tartness was dialed down a bit more interesting characteristics would come through."
""
""
""
""
"O-A great sour, the balance was spot on, a great beer that was worth the price tag."
""
""
""
"O: Overall mouth puckering, eye squinting sourness. Hard to rate a flanders ale due to its lack of range. Ive only managed to have a few thus far but this is very clean and polished in execution. I may not be the biggest fan, but am respectful of its intentions and this is very good at that."
"How can I be constructive if a product makes me this sad?"
"O-This may beat out La Folie as my favorite New World oud bruin/Flanders red. The flavors were intense (this thing was SOUR) but so cleanly meshed with one another. This is not a funky, earthy, barnyard lambic, but a nice drinking sour brew with great balance between sweet and sour, and a drinkable feel that would work well with dinner or (as I had it) with a soft cheese and crackers."

"O: This beer smells amazing - so complex. The flavor does not quite live up to the aroma, though. I remember this tasting better in past years, too."
""
"O - The Bruery Oude Tart is like a Flanders on steroids but they manage to ramp the beer up while hitting the nail right on the head. Completely reminiscent of Monk's Cafe, Rodenbock, etc., this powerhouse of a tart beer is quite an experience to behold."
"This is a very tough style to nail -- even moreso than fruit lambics IMO. Oude Tart is a great example of a brewery with a well-regarded sour program struggling with the Oude Bruin style."
"A very enjoyable flanders that delivers a wealth of complexity and loads of tartness. This guy works on all levels. Enjoyable."
"Overall: A nice flanders, but this is a bit too 'in your face' for me."

"Picked up the last three bottles at a store in downtown f-burg. Poured into my DFH tulip. Wonderful dark ruby/brown in color with very little head, but decent lacing remains around the edge. Nose is nice and fruity with some dark notes and funk at the end. Taste is wonderful, hints of cherry sweetness that give way to delicious sour/funk with the oak gently permeating the whole process. Very well done, glad I have two more bottles for the cellar. I love the bruery, but maybe time for a few 375ml releases? 750 is a lot to drink (and purchase) for one man! But all in all, excellent beer for the style."
"The beer pours like syrupy black cherries with thin tan head that fades before your eyes and has absolutely no retention. The nose is tart and sweet, reminiscent of cherries, with additional notes of oak and a slight acetone. The taste is reserved with subtle hints of wood, cherries, and an almost negligible vinegar. The mouthfeel is sweet and then tart, finishing exceedingly dry. It's very drinkable and refreshing with my duck, venison, and veggie medley...yeah that's how I roll the day after thanksgiving. Definitely worth trying, but considering the price and availability (none), it's probably not a repeat.."
"O- when you buy a bottle of beer for $22, you expect it to be out of this world, especially when it's one you've heard about for so long. This was a disappointment, but still good. Just not worth that price tag"
"Bottle: Poured a reddish/brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with average retention and some minimal lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some light cherries and some wood with light vinous feels. Taste is a good mix between some tart cherries notes with clear oak notes and some wood with limited acidity level. Funky notes are clearly distinguishable. Body is about average with medium carbonation. Not bad but still quite a way behind other Flanders Red such as Rodenbach."
""
"Overall a very well done beer, went great with thanksgiving. If I can save up another extra $20 before they sell out I'll be sure to add one to my cellar"
""
"O - A stellar American take on a Flanders Red; aggressively acidic and bracingly sour with an amazingly smooth body."
"Pours a dark brown, one finger white head into a tulip glass. Sweet at first but leaves a nice, slightly sour flavor. Excellent taste leaves you wanting more. Not overpowering to the nose, nor weak to taste. A well balanced flemish red that you can certainly drink own your own. Having just broken into the sour beer style, this is one that I would get frequently."
""
""
"I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a tulip, dark brown pour, slight white head. Lots of oak, and cherries on the nose. Very tart, notes of cherries, oak, vinegar, linering tartness. The beer is refreshingly tart, acidic, medium in body. A very enjoyable flanders red, no problem finishing the entire bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours deep brown with a ruby tint and a light brown head that dissipates quickly to nothing but a ring. Nose is sour grapes, tart cherries, grape juice, oak, slight burnt oak notes, dark fruits, plums, apple skins and maybe just a bit of leather. Taste is very tart with grape juice flavors up front that mingle with cherries, plums, a bit of oak, leather, green apples, apple skins and maybe just a hint of pear. The body is very light, the carbonation is sharp but not overpowering, its perfect for this style. This is an awesome sour. The Bruery is 2 for 2 in sours for me (the other being Tart of Darkness)."
""
"O - This was the first sour beer that I truly enjoyed. Maybe it was the unique style, which I don't think have had before. Either way, very enjoyable."
""
"Overall, a really nice take on a darker sour/flemish red. The sour cherry character mixes well with the toasted malt character and the vanilla from the barrels. Really balanced and tasty throughout. Not sure if it is worth the price tag, but certainly tasty."

"O- A great sour worth the price tag. Definitely will pick this up again!"

"Oude Tart pours a burnt leathery brown, with very scant ruby highlights. The color is murky, and the beer's topped with just a finger or so of khaki colored foam. Head retention is alright, and lacing is pretty sparse. The nose has lots of very tart cherries, along with a little bit of oak. The flavor profile has a bit of leather and tobacco to it, some kind of combination of oxidation and a little bit of brettanomyces. There's also the requisite vinous acidity and cherry notes, with that same subtle hint of wood from the nose providing the finish. There's a tannic, mouth-puckering quality to the beer, which I suppose is to be expected, The body is suitaby dry, but th carbonation just feels a little lackluster. Still, Oude Tart is a great, very well layered Flanders Red Ale, one that can hang with the heavy hitters from Belgium."
""
"O- my second sour ever, very pleased with this offering. Load 'em up, I want more!"
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic scent, and something about the mouthfeel was almost enigmatic and drew me into the beverage. The appearance is dark, and with its initial pour almost reminds one of coke. The scent is solid and intriguing while the taste lacks a few of the qualities noted in the smell that would've made this a more interesting Flanders."
""
""
"Smells and tastes of tart cherries, oak wood, apples, apple cider vinegar, light blueberries and blackberries, and just a slight ghost of leather that I hope cellaring will amplify. The funk levels are at a solid medium and balanced well against the tart sourness at this point. I wouldn't mind it much if the funkiness increased with cellaring as well... I'm glad I've got another bottle in the basement to try later."
"O: a solid sour overall, though lacking in complexity."
""
"Medium body, well carbonated, bubbly and dry on the tongue. Excellent American take on the style - nice balance, fruit and milder sourness."
""
"O - Fantastic sour beer. One that will most likely stand up well to a year or two of aging. It's tart, it's woody, it's fruity, it's delicious."

"O - I have been wanting to try this one for a long time. and it does not disappoint. I enjoy this style because it bridges the gap between wine and beer. I only wish I could have whipped up some wild board on parpedelle pasta to really enhance both the beer and the food. wine is made for food, and wine often shows better when paired against it. This beer is just begging for food and could pair with more dishes than almost any other style of beer or wine."
""
"Dark oak in color beneath a creamy, somewhat carbonated white head that leaves some thin and ringed lacing down the tulip. Aromatics range from sour, vinous fruit to a slight peat moss quality. Very fresh tasting: a bright and clean tartness; apple, orange, and plum. The slight toasted malt sweetness provides a nice balance to the sour qualities, even adding a tough of richness at times. Medium bodied; mellow on the palate for the style, very smooth and drinkable. A really great offering that leaves me wanting more."
""
"O: Very good and more mild than initially thought."
""
"Pours a murky dark reddish brown with about a 1/2 finger head. When held to the light it has a wonderful ruby color. Smells of tart dark fruit. Lip smacking tartness with a touch of bubbly zip. Overall a nice refreshing beer. This was my first offering from the Bruery, if the other beers are as nice as this one I'm excited to try the rest."
"O-this is a pretty complex beer that seems to gets more flavor as it goes down. It's like a delicious dessert. It has a sweetness to it and less acidity than other red Flanders ales, yet still has that taste of vinegar."
""
""
""
"750 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with a half inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice but seems a little weak to me. The brew smells like tart cherries, red wine, grapes, vinegar and oak. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma. It tastes like tart cherries, red grapes, vinegar, oak, lemon, vanilla and also an earthy/leathery flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has low/moderate carbonation. I think it's a good beer, I enjoyed drinking it. It's a bit pricey at $18.99 a bottle, but I'd probably buy it again at that price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy deepp amber color with a small off white to no head. In the aroma, a small sour cherry, but somewhat faint. In the taste, raisin, red grape, and cherry fruity sourness. This one is a bit acidic. A small sour bite and medium too lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sour fruit in the aftertaste. Big acidic sourness, fruit a mix of cherry and lots of raisins. It almost was on the cusp of being a sour quad."
"O - One of the better American made Flanders I have tried. At a slightly lower price, I think I prefer the Rodenbach vintage series over this though."
""
""
""
""
"O: This sour is about as good as it gets. Breweries who are wanting to learn the technique of making this type of beer, please study this one."
"another great beer from the bruery"
""
""
"O- An interesting beer and another great sour from the Bruery, the oak and wine flavors from the barrels are really nice."
"O: I taste a lot of elements in this beer that clamor for my attention (the bitterness, the acidity, etc), and the result is a bitter mess that's really difficult to enjoy. Fans of the brewing style might taste something that I just don't understand, but Oude Tart and I don't have a common ground."
"A fantastic Flanders Red! I enjoyed every second of drinking this and had a frowny face when I ran out. :("
"Overall (5/5): The Bruery has a straight-up ""wow"" beer in Oude Tart. That this beer's flavor quality and complexity, aroma, and mouthfeel surpass those of all the Belgian Flanders Reds is a testament to just how excellent a creation Oude Tart really is. Extraordinary."
"Overall: Definitely one of the top Flemish-style red ales that I’ve had so far! Oude Tart is a very exceptional representation of its style and my favorite characteristics of this beer is the toasted oak, the tart dark fruits and the vanilla from the oak barrels. Another outstanding brew that I’ve had from The Bruery!"
""
""
"Figures. I just complained about a beer being too over-the-top sour (Cascade Sang Noir), and now I'm drinking a beer that I think lacks sourness. This is tasty, but there are better, more readily accessible Flanders Reds out there."
"I've been fortunate enough to try this at beer fests at least twice. Each time it was more tart than this particular bottle. Heavy on the oak to the point of being a bit too much."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown red with a creamy white ring of head on the edges. It’s too dark to really see through it and is hazy to boot, but there do seem to be bubbles traveling up the sides to suggest carbonation. The lacing stays on as a clinging ring of sticky dry bubbles. The beer smells like leathery dark cherry with a slight alcoholic bite in the back of the nose; it’s as if a dried cherry strip were created and then liquefied. Malt backbone is faint, but seems to be sweet and caramely. The tart cherry smell is the entirety of the bitters in this beer. There is also a faint note of creamy chocolate in the nose’s base which may also be the malt. The beer tastes puckeringly tart and cherry fruity with a faint chocolaty feel in the middle and a slight aftertaste. The tart cherry is the main taste in this beer though, and it shines through. Alcohol is completely hidden in the taste, blending in with the tartness to completely mask itself. There is also a great funk that hits the back of the tongue and suggests some fantastic spiciness. Vanilla notes are also present in the middle and aftertaste that provide a sweet and creamy taste. Mouthfeel is puckering and tart with the sour (obviously). The carbonation, however, is completely velvety and smooth, with a slight chewiness. Overall this is a fantastic beer. I already love the complexity of the beer’s flavor. This is admittedly my first Flemish red, and I am very happy with what it has proven to be. This beer is obviously worth a taste for anyone that’s a beer lover, especially sour beer lovers, and is also worth a try for anyone that loves sour tastes, especially Warheads! Try this beer."

"Love, love, love it. Need one for the cellar now!"

"O: Very good, but there are better American Flanders-style sours out there."

"Pours a dark rusty copper tinted brown, little to no head. Scent brings moderate amounts of vinegar, with cherry, leather and dark bread. Taste has initial rush of vinegar tartness, develops with cherry, slightly vinous, apple, leather and dark yeasty bread. Medium bodied, lower carbonation than many in the style - a good thing. Solid, not quite spectacular."

"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some slight fruit, vinegar, and woody aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic quality on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice balance between sweet and sour aromas and flavors."

"D/O- Very refreshing Flemish Red. We all found it to be similar to New Glarus Enigma. Thanks Beerandraiderfan."
"O: Lots of flavor with a good sour tartness. Still not my favorite as far as sours go. Just a small step away from a solid 4 in my book."

"D - Like it even more than my first sampling back in March. This is a superflavorful, somewhat-accessible, sour base from the Bruery that makes me yearn a bit for the sour-cherry variant."
"O: This is a refreshing and delicate beer; the fruit tartness is prevalent but just a touch subtle too, which works well with the delicate nature of the beer; and the beer finishes with just enough leather and funk to make me want more; nice work once again"
""
""
"There's a reason why this has won multiple golds at the World Beer Cup. Despite not being from the Flanders region, it is the prototype for the style these days. Takes the traditional style, makes it more lively, puckering, all good things."

""
"I’ve sat on this bottle of Oude Tart for a couple years. Since that time, it’s held up well. Oude Tart is a very tasty beer that impresses in just about every way. The nose might be a tad weak, but it delivers otherwise. I like that it’s not overly sour. It features a subtle sour/tart flavor that’s very satisfying. This is very impressive stuff! Definitely worth seeking out."
""
"Medium-light bodied with lively carbonation and a semi-dry finish that’s very slightly puckering. Nicely tart but not over the top, an excellent take on the style."
""
""
"This is good and spot on for the style, but I am not sure it’s as special as noted in the score."
""
"O: Another very nice beer. Mild sourness makes this one easier to drink for the non-sour drinker. Can't say I would want an entire bottle, but a glass was nice. 4.0"
"M: Light to medium."
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite nice. This is aging well. Should really blossom in a year or so. Time will do wonderful things with this, I hope."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinks easier than Duchesse though, but I would take Rodenbach Grand Cru over it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this is a well done beer. They didn't go over the top with anything. I would have liked a dry finish."
"O: A good beer to celebrate with, one that my fiance was a fan of. Very tasty and easy drinking. Carbonation was slightly low, but I feel like it didn't really detract too much overall. In the end of the day, its how it tastes."
""
""
""
"A nice enough beer, I just wished it tasted as great as it smells."
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent intro to sour beer."
""
"One of the better beers of the tasting. I'd say 09 is superior, but I have hopes for 11 to evolve."
"Overall Impression- I enjoyed this brew a ton but like to see how it ages... Some of the characteristics were a bit dull in this Flanders. I could see more complexity and funk coming out of this one a year or two later. Grab a bottle if you can!"
""
"D - Very drinkable even at this ABV."
""
""
"Targeted to sourheads? No idea. But this is one fine, approachable sour, that doesn't cross the line into folding my face into right angles. Excellent beer & a standard for Flanders ales."
"O: I really enjoyed this one, I’m glad I got to try it."
""
"750 ml bottle shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a dark brown with a small off white head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is cherry, oak, lactic acid, and a bit of funkiness. The initial taste is sweet with cherry and has a lactic tartness to it. The oak also comes through as well is some acetic acid. The finish has a bit of astringency and leaves some lingering oak on the palate. Medium body. Low carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"There's a great flow from the aroma to the finish. The progression of flavors just works really well. I dig it."
"Brilliant sour."
""
""
""

"O- Really enjoyable beer from The Bruery. Not disappointed at all, really easy drinkability, and decent amount of complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: at the end of the bottle now...sadness has taken over...what at first i compared to others in the style and wanted it to be more like them, in the end made Oude Tart stand alone as its own version of a delightful style of beer! a wonderful treat!"
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, one of the best of the styles I've ever had. The Bruery can sometimes be hit or miss, but when they get it right, it's damn close to perfect."

"[93/100]"
""
""
""

""
""
"An approachable sour with somewhat subdued (though I wouldn't go so far as to say undeveloped) flavors for the style."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. I was surprised the vinegar tones were subdued and complimenting rather than overpowering. Lots of good flavors are packed into this one that go together well along with the nice creamy mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I quite like this but it is a very different take on the style from either of Rodenbach Grand Cru or Duchesse de Bourgogne. The fruitiness is unique and it opens up really nicely in the glass as it warms. A very good take on the style."
"Overall – A decent beer but nothing that blows me out of the water. I hope this gets a bit more tart in time…as with other “sour” beers from the Bruery, it has a bit too much of a malty backbone for my liking."
""
""
"Overall a tasty brew but not one to be compared to a cantillon or the like. Very worth trying and aging though."
""
""
""
"O: A pretty fantastic sour. I don't get a ton of the oak aging, but it's in there. Pretty dominantly tart...with some mild dark fruits. Still...a very nice American sour ale."
""
""
""
"Pours a bright mahogany with red edges, nice tan head, nice even lacing left behind. Smell is toffee, lemon, slight chocolate, yogurt, Brett fruit. Taste is blue cheese, lemon zest, oak vanilla, cheese popcorn, stale diluted coffee. Mouthfeel is medium light, carries the flavors well, I'm glad this is dry otherwise I would swear this was Rodenbach. Carbonation is low-medium. A lil too cheesy for me, but a decent offering from Cali."
""
"O: Really solid all around. Not overly tart but very clean and fruity. Thanks again, Mark."
"O- It is safe to say that all 4 of us that tasted this were greatly underwhelmed. It was a decent beer, but we felt this was not close to deserving of the hype. Maybe some age would help this develop, as that may be the only circumstance in which I would look forward to trying this again..."

"All in all an excellent beer. One I'm very glad I was able to try and will seek out more of. Good stuff!"
"A good representation of the style. While the other Bruery offerings are superior (Wanderer especially) this is still one of the best West Coast sours. Glad I bought a few to cellar."

"Had this on tap at the Bruery. It poured a dark brown with a little ruby coloring on the edges when held to the light. It had about an inch of a yellowish cream colored head but was completely void by the time it got to me. It smelled very tart with hints of cherry and warhead candy. A little sweeter than I expected. Definitely tart but not in the extreme mouth puckering way. Slightly acidic and dry. It certainly brings you back quickly for another sip. Well carbonated. I'm not a huge sour fan, but I'm trying to appreciate this style for what it is. Tasty all in all."

"O - Overall wow, what a beer. I can understand why this is so heavily sought after. Excellent lingering sourness here. Shame I couldnt get my hands on a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Drinkability is moderate. This is pretty much a sipper, and I can't help but feel a little more tartness or carbonation could've helped. As it warms, the vinegar comes through even more which adds a different facet. Honestly, I was expecting a lot more out of this, and having it in company of Goose Island's Three Sisters, this comes in near the bottom."
"O: Pretty disappointed here. Was expecting a far above average sour, but got nothing but average to below average. Just not a strong enough flavor profile, and enough of a balanced taste for it to be rated with an A average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall great, delicious, great tart fruit, sour malt, light bready dry malts and funk, bit sticky and syrupy."
"This is not a bad beer, and I think it would be better in time, which is why my overall score is a bit higher. I'd rather drink this than others I rated 3.5 in the overall field."

"This is the 2011 batch thanks to Janderson91, appreciate it. I was hopeful about this beer and was completely disappointed. Dark red-brown color, no head, almost completely flat. Smells like it might be a good sour flanders red, not bad but nothign that makes me say yum either. The taste was so disappointing, I almost want to say bland, Muted flavors, just the hint of what a flanders red tastes like. Wow, I really expected more since I know the Bruery can make a good beer, I hope it was just an off bottle because this was pathetic."
"Thank to kbutler1 for whipping this out at a weekend tasting. Moly, this is a great drink. Pours a little murky and medicinal, but all is forgiven aromatically when the raspberries and cherries come out. Fantastically pucker-worthy and tart, with a great sipping consistency. Killer stuff, worth the high price."
"Overall: Great beer, definitely the best Bruery beer I've had to date."
"Overall-- excellent beer right here. Go get one!"
"Overall this is a good beer, but nothing to salivate about. This vintage needs a lot more time in the bottle. The prior release is much better, but this bottle might just need more time. Will have to review again."
"Pours a solid and clear dark brown with deep ruby highlights when held to light. I can smell the tart fruit as soon as I pop the cap on this baby. Sour cherries, lemons, sweet brown sugar, hints of vinegar, light sherry notes. Taste is a bit more sour than the nose lead me to believe. Huge lemony tartness with hints of barnyard funk hit right up front. Sour cherries and a hint of sweetness sweep across the gullet before finishing with a lingering sweet sour and funky aftertaste. Medium body and level of carbonation, tart acidic mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this one, I'm glad I got to try it."
"Overall: Flanders red's in general are a bit overwhelming for my palate but I am glad I got the chance to try this one. Recommended if you like your palate wrecked"
"Overall: I'm confused as to why this is SO highly rated and why it trades so highly as well. It's good, simple, and tasty but nothing mind blowing. I think I like Marron Acidife better though I could drink this often."
"O: This beer has really great flavor, but definitely doesn't fit too well into the style. Dark jam, lactic funk, and cherry skins in red wine are all pronounced in flavor. This feels like a deconstruction of the style by a master chef. I am definitely a big fan of this beer, but I wish the volume would be turned up a bit. I would love to try the cherry version. Something is missing, but I finished a bottle without even trying to. If you like lactic yeast then you're in for a treat."
"what a solid beer, better than most traditional belgian examples. i really love that big sourness and that subtle hint of maple sweetness. id love one of these for the cellar, age would do this wonders."
"O - Good beer. There's a limit to how much you can really drink of it, but it's still enjoyable and something I'd drink again."
"Look, I understand this is bottle conditioned and that with time it will carbonate more and get more tart. However, it's a complete shock to me that The Bruery would ship these bottles out to consumers like this to enjoy fresh. There is no way this is how the beer is supposed to be. I'll be sitting on my other bottles, and hopefully they'll take a complete 180 in a year or so."
"O: Very good but more mild overall than I might have expected. Sour flavor is most definitely there but it is a very elegant one."
"This one caught me by surprise, even my non-sour drinking friend was enthusiastic. One of my new favorite sours for sure, a future classic."
"Quite an amazing beer. My first inclination is to compare this to Supplication. Definitely a bit more round, woody, and less sour than Supplication though."
"O: A truly wonderful flanders style brew."
"An absolutely fantastic sour. Great beer!"
"Overall: Good flavor. Good balance sweet, tart, & oak flavors. Lack of carbonation kills it though. Overall, I was pretty disappointed."
"O - Very good beer especially as it warms when the sour notes taper down a bit and the more complex dark fruit notes begin to show up."
"Overall: This is the crazy thing. The first bottle of Oude Tart I opened from my allocation I thought it was low on carbonation and the flavors muted compared to the previous batches. Not so with the bottle I reviewed. It was flavorful, had good carbonation for the style (I found the 2nd bottle had more carbonation than any of the Marron Acidifie bottles I've had) and compared favorably to the Oude Tart's I've had on draft and bottle in the past. Was my mind playing tricks on me when I opened the first bottle? I can't call it, but the bottle I reviewed rocked!"
"Oude Tart is pretty famous and it's no wonder why. It's an outstanding beer. Cheers"
"On tap at The Bruery. Pours a very murky, dirty water-looking, reddish brown with a small, off white head that disappears quickly. A ton of fizzy bubbles. Scent is acidic vinegar tart notes with a lot of wood and brett. Cherry really comes through as it warms. Taste is initially tart cherries with red wine vinegar. Followed by dark malt flavors and a HEAVY wood backbone. This is the woodiest flanders style ive ever had. Delicious. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and nicely carbed. Drinkability is high. Overall, this beer is very complex and tasty. Glad i came!"
"O: Just another Flanders. Nothing real memorable and certainly not sour by my standards."
"(D)- A superb Flanders. Easily one of the best examples from the states I have had thus far. Wonderfully oaky and sour; just the way I like it. Very well done."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall this was a nice treat and I am glad that I was able to sample. A great American interpretation of a European classic. Well well balanced drinkable. Would definitely drink again but I don't NEED to have it and don't plan to seek it out for a repeat visit. Very tasty and highly recommend; especially if this is style is your wheelhouse."
"There is not much to fault in this beer. The Belgians sometimes complain that the Bruery is merely imitating their beers, but this sort of imitation is the highest form of flattery. Light in body, high in flavor, and with a nice ABV level, this is a superbly drinkable beer."
"O- i really enjoyed this. one of the better brews ive had from the bruery. this is something id gladly seek out again. the alcohol is masterfully hidden."
"Had this one during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting that was graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! I was lucky enough to get to try the Oude Tart with Sour Cherries awhile back, so let's see how this one compares... Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a reddish brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, slight funk, cherry, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, funk, sour, and slight tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The key difference between this brew and the other was that the cherries aren't nearly as pronounced in this one. This cuts back on the sour/tart aspect of this one a little bit. However this one is still quite enjoyable. The aroma and flavor here are quite well balanced and keep you guessing on what the overwhelming note will be the next time you go in for a sip. Definitely worth trying or getting your hands on."
"Overall I quite like it. A well-rounded beer."
"Tasty enough, though I wouldn’t mind a touch more funkiness from something like Brettanomyces, but that would certainly put this outside the modern interpretation of a Flemish sour. I definitely like the body of this brew, it has some texture to it, but it is still fairly quaffable and the zippy carbonation helps to lighten things up enough. I feel like I shouldn’t like this as much as I am as it seems to be lacking in complexity, but damn, I am enjoying this quite a bit. The flavors are so well integrated and the oak / wine notes are at such a soft, integrated level that just makes this beer work quite well. Really it is the oak / wine notes that make this beer in the end, without them this beer would really need something or it wouldn’t be nearly as tasty as it is."
"O - This is a pretty good beer; it strikes me as somewhat akin to a very acidic Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"Pours a Dark golden red which a redish mocha head. It smells tart, with hints of leather and brettanomyces. It tastes fantastically of cherries, very tart and funky. Excellent after taste as well. In terms of mouthfeel, this brew is extremely efferverscent, and very drinkable. Overall and excellent beer."
"O: A phenomenal Oud Bruin from a great American brewery. Superb stuff."
"D- Unlike many sours, this stuff I can just go right through. The flavor is so balanced, it is amazingly easy to drink. Can't wait to get another bottle of this year from the RS. Probably the best Flanders I've had."
"One of the best beers I've ever had, I'd kill to have regular access to this. Glad I celebrated 300 with this!"
"A Drinkable beer again from a company that keeps impressing me."
"d - I thought this was an awesome flanders; probably the best I've ever had. This is the second best Bruery beer I've had too, only behind Black Tuesday. Would love to get another bottle of this one."
"Drink- Was very good. Now I know why I was trying to trade for this for so long. I quess I don't have to now. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Poured a dark brown in color with brown highlights that had a thin head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. Upfront on the nose it had a big vinegar aroma alongside oaky funky barrel, vinous, and mild acidic notes. The vinegar and vinous flavor are more apparent on the palate with cherries, oaky, funky, and dark fruit accents but with mild acidic tart character. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, acidic, oaky, and tart finish. I really really liked the oude tart with cherries but the regular OT is a damn solid flanders oud bruin. it drank good and was tasty."
"Tart and mouth puckering sweet without being overly acidic. Very vinous with a prominent earthy oak tannis character. Nicely balanced with the perfect combo of earthy oak tannis, vinous dark fruit and tart sourness. Hints of grape, tart dark cherries and other berries. Again, as in the aroma, the oak presence is prominent and adds to the complexity. Sweet and vinous with subtle vanilla from the oak. Tart, puckering finish with subtle vinegar sourness that leaves me craving another sip. A very complex, quaffable and interesting interpretation of the style."
"D: I could drink quite a bit of this. Like above, not too sweet, not too sour which makes for a nice drinkable beer. Killed a bottle with no problem."
"Bottle, pors a really deep maroon with a creamy, lasting beige head. Nose is tight, woody, with dark cherries and a subtle brett twist. Nose is nice and reminds of of Veritas 003 more so than any other Flanders Red. Sweet and sour in the mouth, dark cherries, some wild yeast, some oak, really light balsamic vinegar. A weird finish that is kind of herbal and just doesn't fit in quite right. I like this but the flavors are kind of at odds with each other at times. Good."
"Reviewed on 4/19/2010. Bottle. Pours a murky light brown with a reddish tint and a thick tan head. Aroma of sour malt, sour milk, sweet candy. Flavor is quite tart initially with sweetness following and a malty, bready finish. Nice palate, very easy to drink for a sour. Tasty!"
"Drinkability is decent. The tartness never becomes overpowering, and the flavor profile is nice, but fairly basic."
"D: A really boring and great beer. It had so much going on but it was drinking like a champ. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking to get into the style."
"Overall, a different take on a tradition flanders, but still very well done. Most flanders have an intense vinegar acidity, where as the lactic sourness in this beer was more on line with a lot of the american wild ales I have had. Even though it was different, I still loved this beer, just don't expect a huge vinegar presence....highly recommended."
"D - big fan of this one. refreshing yet slightly abrasive (with deliciousness) at times. would have no problem sipping on a whole bottle of this myself."
"4.5 D: Definitely a solid beer. Easily the best Bruery beer I've had thus far though that isn't saying a lot given the garbage I've had. In any case, I definitely would like to drink this again. Solid all around and goes down easy."
"D: I could drink this all day long!"
"Finally got to try this, and it did not dissappoint. The best thing about Bruery beers is their great body and mouthfeel, and this one is no exception. The pour is cola brown with a creamy, slowly dissipating beige head. The smell, while reminesect of Rodenbach, is earthier. Taste is along the lines of an aged Rodenbach - NOT the Grand Cru. Body is smooth, carbonation great. Drinkability is super. All in all, this really reminds me more of a Flanders Red, but there is nothing wrong with that."
"So it's obvious that when this beer is in my mouth, my taste buds are happy. But how exactly does it feel? Well, the medium body is lush and never compromising and the lively carbonation makes it feel lighter and much more enjoyable. All around, this beer is so close to perfect in just about every way and the taste makes it the best Flanders style beer I've ever had. Just wonderful stuff, can't wait to drink it again!"
"I wish this was more available than it is... It was served in a pilsner glass which isn't the best glass for getting a good nose on it, but I do remember the very evident sour funk to it (not in a bad way)."
"This one has everything the style demands, but in a bolder, more intense, in-your-face, West Coast USA fashion. I dig it."
"D- I could have easily done this one solo. An easy drinking sour. Not nearly as sour as some of the other brews we cracked, but overall a solid brew that I would seek out again."
"overall - amazing. I really enjoyed this beer. this review is from notes, and coincidently today I received a bottle from a trade."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability was very high. the sourness is not overbearing, meaning I could have a couple. Overall, I thought this was an outstanding brew, and it rankied right up there with the best of our night. Skal."
"drinkability - complex and sour, very flavorful, tasty treat"
"I've been wanting to try this beer for a while. I was pretty excited that it showed up at this tasting. Oude Tart appears a brown shade with an average sized head and adequate lacing. The beer has a very pleasant aroma with scents of brettanomyces and a hint of sweetness. This is a very tasty beer, no doubt. There is a slight vinegar edge to the finish that I find to be a tad harsh, though not totally distracting by any means. This is a solid beer and I really look forward to having it again."
"The beer pours a hazy red-amber color with a tan head. The aroma is tart cherries with some oak, vanilla and brown sugar. The flavor is tart cherries with some oak. Very drinkable and very dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Low end of medium bodied, perfectly carbonated to a medium level, ABV well hidden. Great beer and perhaps my favorite of the style to date. Incredible that the Bruery is doing such great things this early in their existence."
"Drinkability: A marvelously refreshing beer, and a very good one. At only 7.5%, this one's not too much of a sipper, and I re-filled my glass from the communal bottle thrice to get the entirety of this review - a great beer to start this tasting on, with lots of interesting notes, a nice cleansing acidity, but nothing too powerful, too intense, or too overpowering. Recommended."
"M + D: Smooooth... even with a notable carbonation, it drinks very clean and easily. A bit of a higher alcohol content than I might have expected, but certainly well hidden."
"D - This is another fine effort from the Bruery. Alcohol is a bit high at 7.5% to be an easy drinking session beer, but it is a bit scary with its smoothness. Don't notice the alcohol and the flavors here just entice you to take sip after sip. A very nice Oud Bruin...really enjoying this beer on a nice crisp early summer evening. Really glad to be able to try this one. Thanks again Barry!"
"D - This is a extremely drinkable beer. Even though it doesn't have the highest ABV it still hit me pretty good because of how drinkable it was. I think The Bruery did a great job with this style and I wish I could have got some bottles of this. I'm very impressed with this beer and want more of it."
"Light in body and pretty carbonated on the mouth. Good palate cleansing beer overall. Forward mild sweetness and back a nice tartness. Moderate acetic character with a brightness to it. Some citric and lactic character as well. One of the best bruins out there."
"Overall: Goes down easy enough, this is decent but I would reach for a la folie or others first. I am bumping my score a bit as the new batch is improved. Good balanced flavors."
"D- This is a very good, well balanced, oud bruin overall."
"D-this is a well balanced sour. lots of oak up front, the sweetness balances out the sour quite well."
"J"
"The mouthfeel borders on perfect, though it is just little lighter than I would like it to be. Very well carbonated though. Drinkability is huge because I could easily get through 2 750s of this (one was simply not enough)."
"Classic red, but better. I often find rodenbach to have a bit to much sweetness, this red does not have that problem. Dark brownish red, light tan thin head. Aroma of dark berries, sweet oak, lightly acitic hit you right off the bat. The aroma is nice but not overwhelming or too strong. The flavor is balanced between sweet malts and tartness and acidity from the yeast and barrel aging. Flavors of vanilla, light caramel are very clear. Also dark berries plentry of oak and a little leather. Easy to drink thanks to the pleasant carbonation level. Body and tartness match up well. I am so happy to have had this and so sad that it is not a year rounder."
"Pours a rusty redwood with a silky tan head. Nose has sour cherries, ripe plums, barnyard funk, oak and dry red wine. Taste has tart cherries up front through the finish followed by sweet pitted fruits, wood and musty farmyard funk. Crisp clean body has a tart and acidic finish. Another style well doen by the Bruery."
"Drinkability: Masterfully handled fruit character that is well balanced between the sweet and tart elements"
"This is a very nice beer. I certainly wish I'd purchased more when I had the chance. A really nice beer. I'd be very interested to see how it ages."
"Glad I got to try it but I wouldnt get it again."
"It's quite an interesting take on the style, very old world in nature. While it doesn't have the breadth of flavors that something like Goudenband has, for the first vintage, this is an exceptionally executed beer. Very well done, Patrick and co!"
"D: Highly drinkable. Nice acidity without being overly dry. The creaminess is a nice touch. Well-balanced flavors all around."
"Enjoying this very much, but still have to give top honors to my faves Haandbakk and Oerbier Reserva. Makes a nice pairing with a washed rind cheese."
"Very nice beer, good drinkability, terrific example of the style."
"Stellar...period."
"It's a Flander's Oud Bruin Style and 7.5%. It is also aged 18 months in Cabernet barrels. It's a beautiful clear copper brick red color. It had a light cherry aroma, a hint of funk and lots of wood. It was a strong sour at first that fades into a delightful sweetness, very complex! This is the type of sour I truly enjoy. It is a bit reminiscent of Rodenbach Grand Cru, which we just had."
"Overall, this beer is much better out of the bottle and I think it will continue to get more sour. It is drinkable and I can't wait to see what time does to this beer. Well done."
"Drinkable? absolutely. This tasted cleaner than I had expected."
"D - This was good, but I think I prefer Red Poppy."
"D - Very enjoyable. It gets a touch acetic and vinegary by the end of a glass, but I could probably have the bottle on my own. Looking forward to more sour brews from the Bruery."
"D: Pretty solid beer."
"This was a very solid take on an Oude Bruin, being well balanced with the wood character and achieving just the right amount of pucker in the mouth. I really enjoyed this bottle."
"D: Pretty good. Not world class, but solid and drinkable."
"D: This is where this beer shines. I'd like to think I've had my fair share of Flanders Reds and this one take the cake with balance. Everything works so well together in this beer. Where La Folie is tongue twisting sour, or The Duchesse is a bit too sweet, this beer is just silly balanced. If you get a chance try this beer."
"D: Like I said, I had this thrice and enjoyed it. Too bad it took me so long to get around to uploading a review. This is genuinely good, and it's making me catch on to what everyone else seems to know already: The Bruery is worth watching. I'd buy a bottle of this, and then weep silently because I can't eat for a week."
"D: A surprise for me to be sure. I really wanted to try this from the start but wasn't quite expecting the exceptional brew that I got. Excellently balanced with a nice complexity that is easy to appreciate due to its not being overwhelming. Very tasty and I hope I'll get the chance to revisit this one again."
"I think this is an excellent Flanders as it's plenty sweet with the cherries with enough brett to balance it, but not so much as to dominate. Excellent."
"D: Very drinkable for a sour, tart enough to be applicable to the style, yet sweet and complex enough to remain interesting for the duration."
"I might have been prejudiced by my foam observations, but the feel was pretty bacterial and lactic. It's a sour, I know, but I was reminded of where these acids were coming from when I saw the foam clumps. The carbonation was also very high, which I didn't see as a bad thing. It made it a bit difficult to take a good hearty sip, though."
"Overall I was a big fan of this beer as it does a very good job of straddling the tart/sweet line. Well worth a shot."
"this is a VERY approachable flanders oud bruin. not too funky or sour and VERY balanced all around. probably the closest i have had to the Belgian counterparts."
"Hazy reddish-amber body with a finger of slightly off-white head atop. The head settles to a crown, leaving only a small film on top. The nose is sharp and cherry-like, light acetic acid backed by a subtle dark malt foundation. The ripe cherry aroma is pretty awesome. It tastes toasty and sour, balsamic vinegar-like acetic acid at a perfect level. Cherry-like esters are prominent on the palate, though there's not much sweetness; it's a dry, woody and tannic beer, especially in the finish. This exceeded my expectations, one of the better American interpretations of this style."
"Overall this beer was really nice and a great American interpretation on a Flanders Oud Bruin. The Bruery has crafted a fine beverage here. Recommended."
"A really delicious beer."
"Pretty amazing beer - pours hazy dark reddish/brown with a lot of tan head. Smells of tart cherries, green apple, a dash of vinager, and has an earthy, mineral quality that I can't really articulate any better than that. Not quite leather, but sort of like it. Tastes like a blend of sweet and tart cherries and apples, and a perfect balance of dry yet slightly sweet. Not overly astringent or sour. In fact, the sourness is very mild. Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation. Overall, one of the best beers I've had from Bruery."
"This is not among my favorite styles, but this is a great representation of the style. I split the bottle with another person and it went down very easy. Recommended."
"Thanks to Skuter for the bottle."
"This was a treat. Pours with a lightly dense finger thick foam cap. Body is like a reddish-brown. My notes say it smelled of cherry and wood. The taste was tart (shocker!), with an overall sour cherry flavor and wood tannins. That's all I wrote down as I was losing my focus by this time."
"D: An almost perfect sour beer. It has a little something for everyone. Tart, sweet, spicy, winey, citrus, and oak. Whew! Incredible!"
"Drinkability- Pretty damned tasty stuff and EXACTLY what I was hoping it would be. The beer has a nice solid base and the perfect level of sour. Really tasty brew that I'm glad to have the opportunity to try. Thanks much Jeff!"

"Overall, a pretty nice a oud bruin."
"Overall: Nice, refreshing and tart. Not too sour. Seems balanced and a good example of the style."
"Bottle courtesy Sam. Pours a cloudy murky mahogany with a frothy tan head. Aroma is green apples with brown sugar and caramel, similar to La Folie. Flavor is very oaky and tart with apple pie, crabapple skins, a bit of cherry juice, jammy red wine. 7.5% alcohol gives it a warming sensation. Mouthfeel is kind of sticky, despite the sufficient carbonation."
"Overall this was just what it was supposed to be. It is truly a breath of fresh air what the Bruery is doing. So far so good. everything has lived up to and exceed my expectations."
"Draugh at the bruery. Red-brown with a big beige head. Oaky, tart, fruity aroma with some vinegar and burnt fig. The wine barrel influence really sets this appart from gypsey tart, and the sourness is about perfect, making it very drinkable but clean and dry in the finish while having a nIce malt character up front. A little mellow for a top-tier American sour ale, but the flavor complexity is there. Killer with food."
"Drinkability: This is by far the easiest drinking sour I've ever had. I could drink this all day...well, until I pass out, anyway."
"If not for the relatively high price tag and abv, I'll drink this like I'm drinking water."
"EDIT: Patrick BMed me with some helpful information that has resolved my question re: Flanders Red vs. Oud Bruin. Methinks there are a few reds that are currently misclassified."
"This was the first release for 2010 for the Bruery and I was greatly impressed. This was one of the first beers made by Tyler and the Bruery gang and it has been aging in the red wine barrels for 18 months, so far a great start to 2010 with the release of this delicious beer."
"High drinkability. Overall a great Flemish red. Not quite Top 100 level as the current rAvg puts it, but very good."
"The dark cherry was the standout nose, followed closely by oak. The taste was a very similar story and the dry cabernet-esque taste almost vaporized on the back end of the palate (nice). In a blind taste test I dont know if I could tell this beer from LaFolie, which is by no means an insult... I love the hell out of that beer. I just really hoped for a characteristic to grab me by the booboo"
"D: Outstanding, The Bruery's made another great sour. More classic and traditional in flavour than the Sour in the Rye which was great in itself, a beer to give Rodenbach Grand Cru a run for its money."
"D: A very nice example of a Flanders red/brown ale. Some people compared it to Rodenbach Grand Cru, but I found it to be a little less oaky and vinous, and a bit more drinkable. I plan to drink these bottles fairly soon as they taste wonderful now."
"Yum. That is all."
"By far the best thing to come out of this place."
"Flavor is VERY well balanced, excellent, light lactic tartness with dark fruit/malt balance, this is the best american flanders red i have had. very well put together beer, cant wait to get a few bottles!"
"D - I could probably drink one more...and then another. It's pretty delicious, and with the oak notes present, it probably would setup well for aging."
"Quite spot-on for a classic Flemish style, fairly handily the most authentic American take on it that I have tasted. Undoubtedly the long eighteen month maturation in oak had great results. Eighteen months ago The Bruery had only just begun brewing, and to have this kind of dedication so early on speaks volumes. This is a very tasty beer as it is, lots of cherry and tartness that appeals to my American sensibilities, but also an impressive version of a classic style."
"A pleasure to drink this."
"I predict big things for it. Eminently drinkable, nice lively mouthfeel."
