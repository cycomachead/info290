"Such an enjoyable sour beer.  You can really taste the flavors of the beer along with a touch of sour."

"Halting just before complete dryness, the sweetness of malt provides a balancing malt character to prevent the sheer acidity from domination of the palate. Its moderate and medium tone will be the crutch for the die-hard Flanders fans, but for those just stepping into sour ales, Soulless will provide the much needed comfort."
"Is this the end all and very best example of the style ? Absolutely not. But hey, I like this sour beer and it is pretty good. I'll probably get this again for sure. A decent sour at a really great price. Thank you Rivertown !"

"A Flanders style Scarlet sour ale. A rich, malty, raisiny character with sharp tartness defines this beer. This beer uses two strains of yeasts â€” lactic acid and a Trappist Ale strain are used on the finish fermentation."
""
"Starts off really nice and then fades to a lingering bitter pretzel/ adjunct taste."
"Blah blah blah words I'm an outlier"
"Eric"
"just not my style. nor my taste"
"Bring on the Flemish! Looks like sherry in my glass after the head quickly dies down. Decent Flemish character on this. Typical cherries, mild wood, that somewhat sweet fruit funk. Not bad. Feel is slightly thin, but that seems to be a standard amongst American interpretations of this style. I am biased towards this style, but I think it is a good example."

"I appreciate what Rivertown is attempting to do here, in making an affordable, easily attainable sour ale. That being said, I have brewed more style-appropriate Flanders at home by kettle-souring the wort and fermenting with all Brett. I'm disappointed in this, and I was really hoping for more."
"O- It's a malty sour. Not bad. I'm not sure I'd get this one again, but at least I know what it tastes like if someone asks..."
"Still, it's a nice addition to the Cincy Beer Scene.  It's different than most of the overly hoppy craft beers out now, and adds some variety at a great price."
"O - This is not a stellar beer, and is extremely tame for a sour Flanders style, but it is an easy beer to drink and does offer Flanders elements in a restrained and pleasant manner."
""
"O: good but not great version of the style."
""
"Pours a filtered clear orange red, instant fade fizz, no retention, no lace. Smell: nothing here...vague caramel ish, floral ish, steely. Taste: metal, lactic and butyric blech, unripe nectarine skin, light steely caramel in the finish. Thin, watery. This is just bad, avoid it. Predictable joke:  The name fits!"
"not the best, most tart flanders out there, but hey, for value, it can NOT be beat.  $8.99 for a six pack."
"Crisp, delicious, refreshing.... I can't wait to get an other one tonight."
"I don't understand the hate for this beer. I was told that this is a light example of the style. Yeah, it's not the most complex at its core, and it's a bit thin, but there's still some nice sourness and barrel character. Certainly not the worst beer rivertown has brewed."
"This one shouldn't have been kegged Rivertown. Its just---not even close."
"It tastes like the color brown"
""
"O - My first Flanders, and I can say it's not bad at all, actually really refreshing.  I give it a recommendation.   Cheers!"
""
"This is astonishingly bad. Rivertown should be ashamed."
