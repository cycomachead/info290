"It may miss the original style's mark a bit, but nowadays,with so many style representations, from so many different brewers, what doesn't?"

"o - Overall a nice flanders, much better than their blonde I had a few weeks ago. Some brett to it and nice caramel and fruit, and super easy to drink. Would have it again."
"O - The main problem here is the lack of body. It has all the hallmarks of a classic bock but without the texture it struggles somewhat and the pleasant array of flavours is not quite enough to save this drop."
"Despite such a major flaw, it's impossible to discount the charisma in the aroma and flavour. Don't really know what this is trying to be (it tastes nothing like a Flanders Red Ale to me) but as an 8% Dubbel it would be absolutely stellar."
"Pours a clouded brown with ruby hues and a thick pinkish head. Nose is cherries, leaf tones, and apples. Flavor is fairly earthy, but not powerfully so. Mild cherry tones, like a mild Flanders. Feel is smooth on liquid. Carbonation is standard, I'd say. An easy drinker with a mild Flanders edge. Nice enough."
"D-Crisp, light, refreshing. This brew would be perfect for a hot summer day. Lively, dry fruity notes are very tasty."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp with a definite pucker of the lips present. This is an interesting beer and I'm glad I tried it, but it's probably an average belgian ale, all in all."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light reddish color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of lightly sour notes with some oak notes. Taste is also a light mix between some oak and some sourness with some light vinous notes. Body is average for the style with some good carbonation. This beer really reminded me of the Classic Rodenbach and would be perfect for a hot summer day."
"All in all, a really pleasent drink and, if I get the chance to taste it again I hope it'll be in front of a great piece of steak :-)"
"Drinkability : Despite the name, it has nothing to do with style ""red flandres", developed in Belgium, because it knows no lightning in the maturation of wood."
"It had a pleasant aroma: dark cherry with strong malt and caramel flavors. It's flavor was less sour than expected, which is traditional for a Flanders Red Ale. The malts were the most prevalent taste with hints of fruits and raisins. It paired well with my meat dish, so no surprise to see a cow's head on the bottle."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable beer with no flaws, just didn't show me anything spectacular."
"Draft at Bruxellensis (9/9/06)."
"Dark amber, semi unclear, khaki creamy layer of head. Pungent, malty, and yeasty aroma. Smooth and silky, just flows so nicely that you do not even feel the carbonation. Medium body. Dark malts, very balanced, hints of sugary sweetness towards the end of the sip. Tastes almost like a good brown ale. Very good flavor and feel!"
"Between a red ale and a Flanders red ale, with a wooden profile but very light hints of sourness, unlike many Flanders ales."
