4.15,3.2,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,4,"I'll admit I'm still working on understanding and appreciating the differences between  the various sour styles.  I'm not sure how much blending has gone on in this beer as there are qualities that make it seem more fresh than not.  OTOH not all of it seems that way.  The lingering flavor seems unique to this beer.  I think I like it.","garymuchow","Dec 10, 2014"

4.55,13.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Muddy chestnut brown. Decent hiss when opened but pours very still with no head and no lacing. Apple and somewhat cidery aroma. Brett. Wonderful tart and somewhat sour flavors. Nice balance with the oak. Faint dried cherry flavors. The mouthfeel is really great-very smooth and almsot creamy. I was really expecting something a lot thinner. Very enjoyable and drinkable. Once again my local brewery kicks butt!","lackenhauser","Apr 04, 2013"
