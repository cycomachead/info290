4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby coloring with no head. Nose of tart red grape, grape must, sour funk, woody and earthy tones, and a blend of dark cherry and berry sweetness. Flavors are very tart cherry and grape forward, with raspberry notes, solid sour funk, tannins, woody highlights, and some dry red wine notes. Light, dry, crisp body, with a tart, berry, and old-world fruit sweet aftertaste. The finish is dry and crisp. Solid beer!","GarthDanielson","0"
