It is intense, quite complex and a brewer's masterpiece of balance.  It begins with a burst of tart fruit, raspberries and cherries, over a slightly sweet background.  In the middle, tartness gives a slight pucker with only the slightest hint of sour vinegar.  The raspberry and cherry fruit flavors slowly subside and cranberry comes to the forefront over a caramel like sweetness.  As the finish approaches, dryness comes to the forefront coupled still with a nice tart pucker and flavor.  In the finish, oak notes come to the forefront coupled with a slow fade of tartness and slight sourness.  A dry pucker lingers.","tillmac62","Jan 20, 2015"

4.45,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"750 ml caged and corked bottle, no date on the bottle that I could find so I have no idea how old or what batch number this is.  I'm pretty sure I've had this bottle for about a year if not longer, so it does have some age on it.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a slightly hazy ruby red/brown color with about a half inch light tan head.  The head fizzled away quickly, and there isn't much lacing.  Aroma is nice and fruity (sweet and tart), the brew smells like raspberries, cherries, oak, vinegar, lemon and a bit of cranberry.  The taste overall is a bit sweeter than I expected it to be.  It tastes like raspberries, cherries (both sweet and tart ones), cranberries, oak, grape skins, caramel, vinegar and a bit of apple and lemon peel.  The tart flavors were subtle at first, but then got stronger as I finished the bottle.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with a good amount of soft carbonation.  I think this is a pretty good overall brew.  Definitely worth buying if you see it anywhere!  $21.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jan 18, 2015"

4.71,5.1,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"just amazing, unique, incredibly special beer as good as any i can recall. i dont usually get too into the flanders red type, it always seems more vinegar and acidity than yeast character, and i find it off putting that its usually so sweet as well as sour, a textural and flavor contrast that doesnt often jive with me. this one though, is entirely different. the sour cherries, cranberries, and raspberries are huge contributors right from first splash into my glass. its almost neon red pink, clearish and heady, delicate looking, but really intensely colored. the nose presents the tartness of the fruit, cranberries leading the way, but all three are easy to pick out. there is less body and sweetness than i remember in the grand cru, and i like that a lot. there is a swedish fish aroma, mouthwatering and candy-like, but not all that sweet. the fruit is super authentic, and the beer seems very mature. there is a bit of oak on it too, but not heavy and sweet, and really now showing the usual vanilla much because of the intensity of the fruit. the fruit is right there up front in the taste, but i think i get more cherry first, more raspberry later, the best of both kriek and framboise here, but the finish is what makes this special i think. it has that malt vinegar flavor of the typical flemish red, but its more refined, its really sour, but it carries on forever without being shocking. the finish is the longest ever, super puckery, and not the least bit sweet, with the fruit tartness continuing to come in waves for ages after the swallow. this is one of the best fruit beers ever made in my opinion, extremely memorable and different, and a model for others to strive for in terms of quality. maybe one of my favorite beers ive ever had, which is crazy to me because as good as grand cru is, it wasnt a personal favorite at all. as good as it gets! huge thanks to my brother for sharing this!","StonedTrippin","Oct 19, 2014"

Pours dark red with some brownish hues and a bit of light showing through, along with a nice two finger off white head with some pink tones to it. Awesome aroma of cherries and raspberries, lots if sweet fruit here, light tartness, a bit of oak. Flavor is plenty of sourness but not overbearing acidity on the tongue, some oak here but dominated by fruit, sweet raspberries, lots of cherries, and I assume the cranberries add a bit of the tart tones here. Medium bodied with nearly spritzy carbonation that mingles perfectly with the sourness to balance out all the sweet berries here. World class brew.","BMMillsy","Aug 22, 2014"

This one has the same sharp bite, slightly softened and made more complex by pronounced, but elegant wood, and a winter spice note, probably from the oak and the older beer that plays up a slight sweet note that contrasts beautifully with the red fruit in the sourness and the vinous notes.

Cherries, wood, grass, lemons, and something almost cinnamon. The taste is woody, with a cherry aftertaste. Somewhere along the way sugared oranges show up, but it's not sweet, if that makes any sense at all. It's not sour at all, but just delightfully dry. It has some vanilla in the mix and just is really interesting. Every time I try to get a hand on it, something else wells up. Mouthfeel is terrific, slick and slightly tingly. Overall, this is one hell of a beer! I'm not sure what to make of it, but it doesn't care, it has far too much going on to care about my opinion.","roblowther","Feb 26, 2014"

Ripe blueberry, cherry skin tannins and some silky smooth malt notes in the back. Finish is a touch dry with some oak and lingering dried cranberry and black cherry skin notes. There's a lot of sweetness here, but it's held in check perfectly by some on point carbonation and the nice drying finish.

4.24,-5.4,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. This beer is able to destroy the stylistic guidelines with pinpoint accuracy while sending unique yet appropriate flavoring dancing over top of it. The fruit is wonderfully refreshing and authentic, matching the oak in all of its weird glory whole heartedly. The aroma is just as nice, but doesn’t quite set you up for the seriousness of the sip. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is out of this world, with just the right amount of dryness to match the juiciness and puckering punch of the fruit, grain, and wood. We’ve been quite excited for this one for a while, and oddly enough this is our first taste of any Rodenbach product, despite the fact that we’ve been accruing a vintage vertical in our cellar for the past several years. This beer might be a bit esoteric for some, but for those that can appreciate it, it is downright delicious.","TheBrewo","Jan 24, 2014"

4.34,-3.1,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"I love fruit-forward beers, but the fruit additions in this offering completely overwhelmed the base beer and resulted in something that was overtly sweet and rather one-dimensional. If this were merely a fruited ale, I probably would have given it much better scores. However, knowing how terrific the base beer is, and paying $28 for this ""enhanced"" version, gives me reason to knock it in some aspects. Although most fruit beers are best consumed fresh, this one might actually benefit from some age.","Damian","Jan 23, 2014"

4.5,0.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and I don't have any experience with this style, but I'm pretty sure this is a very good example of a Flanders Red Ale and it reminded me of some of the better funky fruit beers I have had. This beer had nice drinkability, it wasn't overly sour, a little acidic, pretty smooth, clean, refreshing and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I think a full bottle would be a little too acidic for me so I think splitting the bottle with someone is the perfect amount and I could see how this would be a great beer to enjoy in the summer. What I liked the most about this beer was everything, this beer didn't have any weak points in my opinion and there's nothing I can think that would improve this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how expensive it is, I know it's not cheap to import these Belgian beers, but if the price was lower it wouldn't be just a special occasion beer. I would get this beer again if it saw it, it's very expensive, but I think it's worth it and it makes for a great special occasion beer and I would love to see how it changes over time. I would recommend this to anyone who loves those Funky fruit beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I was hoping this was going to be good for how much I paid for it, but it ended up exceeding my expectations and it made for a very enjoyable beer. Good job guys, this was a great and special beer, thanks for sending some to the USA, keep up the awesome work.","StoutHunter","Jan 12, 2014"

4.45,-0.7,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.75,4.5,"The beer pours a dark, slightly dull rusty brown that shines crimson in the light and provides a fizzling pink head. Although the head fades quickly with minimal lacing, it leaves a thin blanketing/halo throughout drinking. The nose is potently fruity with prominent notes of strawberry and cherry (and celery?) followed by a very refined oak acetone. The taste is Flanders red to the max with huge amounts of description-promised strawb/cherry fruitiness, a touch of caramel and wood. Its medium bodied, effervescent, modestly dry and acidic, fruity, bold, and downright drinkable as hell. I highly recommend this brew for those that enjoy a good Flanders and have had the Rodenbach predecessors. It's an excellent beer, one of the best I've had in a long time actually.","ThePorterSorter","Apr 13, 2013"

Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some raspberry, cherry, cranberry, and raspberry vinaigrette. Taste is much the same with a nice fruity finish and a slight acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

Heavy cherry with mild raspberry and cherry. More cranberry in flavor. Super fruity. Moderately tart. High carbonation and super dry. Too fruity at this point, though hopefully that calms down and brings out the base a bit more. Also didn’t have that nice yeast-driven acidity of most Rodenbach yet. Could also use a bit more body.","Thorpe429","Dec 16, 2012"

Poured a deep ruby red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, sour, tart, wood, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, tart cherry, wood, subtle funk, and sugar. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. In typical Rodenbach fashion, they knocked this one out of the park. Really complex, tart, and sour all while be refreshing at the same time. While there wasn’t a huge amount of complexity going on here, it was just the right about in my opinion for the style. This made it quite easy to drink and extremely enjoyable. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance, you won’t regret it!","thagr81us","Nov 21, 2012"

4.12,-8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall I was slighlty underwhelmed by the offering to be honest. I was super pumped for it but the sour profile and high effervescence made this seem like a carbonated fruit juice than a Flanders Red Ale. Base beer is really mitigated by the sweet fruity berry flavors with lower tartness than I was expecting/hoping for. Maybe with time this could develop into something but right now it is merely good and not elite as I was expecting.","claspada","Oct 15, 2012"

Smells of tart cherries, funk, yeast, a bit of vinegar, some sweet fruits, some tart fruit. The flavor is pretty tart up front with some fruity tartness and a bit of acid. The fruit comes in midway to provide some sweet balance before a bit of funk, vinegar, and tannic oak step in. Medium body with a sharp level of carbonation that provides for a prickly mouthfeel. I rather enjoyed this one, its good now, but almost feels like a few years would do wonders to help meld the flavors a bit.","johnnnniee","Aug 25, 2012"
4.05,-9.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a medium bodied and modestly carbonated offering. The alcohol is well hidden but the hints of medicinal aspect keeps it from being stellar. I am really taken back by how fruity this is and how much it has altered the base beer. Straight from the pour, it looks fruited and it captures a fruity aromatic quality that filled the room we were sitting in while enjoying this. It was nice to try it and say I had it, but i think i give the nod to the gramd cru as being what I would rather spend my money on. Maybe with some age, as the fruit mellows out my opinion might change but as-is this is a fruity medicinal bugger.","stakem","Aug 21, 2012"

Taste consistent with nose - bold and fruity with a slight tart quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation, a slight acidity and easy easy astringency. This is a top notch beer, although not sure I would classify it as a Belgian Strong Dark. Not overly sour, very approachable to various taste and there's some definite cellaring potential here.

The aroma is wild and funky, like a fruit lambic. Smells very sweet. Huge raspberry presence, similar to a framboise. Sweet and teeming with berry flavor, balanced by a bit of tartness and wild yeast character. A great candidate for sharing, as the sweetness is a bit much after a small serving. Overall, very tasty, albeit a bit too sweet for me personally. While not my absolute favorite offering from Rodenbach, I enjoyed this. Recommended.","Huhzubendah","Aug 05, 2012"
