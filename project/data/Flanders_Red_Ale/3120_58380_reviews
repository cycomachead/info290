"O: Refreshing, pretty tasty, and well made. Not the most mouthpuckering or flavorful sour out there, but that may be a feature rather than a bug."
""
"O - Nice beer with some good flavors, but nothing that sets it head and shoulders above other nice beers of this style. Wouldn't mind drinking again though."
""
"A very nice and incredibly drinkable version of the style. Jordan mentioned the folks at Alpine had given this bottle to him before its eventual release, and that it was still very, very young. Perhaps we should have sat on it for longer? I would love to revisit this one again."

"o - Overall I liked this one quite a bit. I believe it's the first sour-ish beer I've had from Alpine, and I think they did a good job making a Flanders. I found it very vinegary and full of sour cherries, and liked the wood coming through in the nose and mouth. Would love to have it again sometime."
"D - Even with some minor flaws I found this quite enjoyable, and had no problem finishing a few pours. I dig the lower ABV, particularly after all the high-alcohol Avery sours I've had recently. I think Alpine could have a winner here with a few tweaks to the next batch."
"Overall; An excellent brew. Would recommend again. My buddy didn't like sour beers, after 8hrs at Alpine, Ned was his new fav and converted him to the land of sours. Bravo."
"O- Overall this is a good, but somewhat dry red. The overall character is tart mildly agressive, and mildly tannic."
"Overall:This is an easy drinking beer with hints of sourness and complexity."
"From notes at the pub on 2/8"
"D - Soooo drinkable. I wish I could bring a growler of this home with me. I could drink this all day. The cherry flavor is fantastic.Could be a little more tart but otherwise phenomenal. I need more of this!"
"Overall, a very solid beer that I am enjoying. Good work Alpine."
"D: I sipped on this one for a good hour and a half. I still need to explore this style but this one definitely excited me to try more. That is how I would say its very drinkable."
"Overall: An enjoyable Flanders red ale at a great price, but Alpine reigns supreme in the hoppy category and I'd rather be drinking one of their hoppy beers, though I'd rather be drinking one of those than most other beers, so that's irrelevant and not very informative. I wasn't crazy about this when it was first released, but a short amount of time has done it great credit and it's now more enjoyable."
"D - Not bad but I'll go elsewhere for a sour...Alpine owns the IPA category."
"Surprised to see an Alpine beer that wasn't an ipa, like the effort but not executed as well. Huge flanders fan and this just doesn't even come close."
"Pours ruby win some brownish coloring. Off white head with a decent amount of lacing. Nose brings forward oak, acetic vinegar notes, and some cherries. Taste wraps it all together pretty well with he acetic acid and the cherries mixing with the oak, leading to a nice creamy mouthfeel. Toward then end, the vinegar flavors get to be a bit much, affecting its drinkability."
"Overall, a was disappointed in this one. I have loved all the other Alpines that I've had so was really looking forward to this one especially since I love the style. A little more secondary aroma and flavors would really jump this one up as it already has a good sour vinegar base. Not avail here in TX so got from Milt. Rotation - not avail here and was hard to get so I'd say one is enough unless the stars aligned just right. Would love to try at the brewery on the next SD trip if available. [O;Y]"
"D - This is a tasty and enjoyable beer. A nice American effort on a style we've still got a long way to go on."
"I'm hoping Alpine can make this consistently. Reading some of the reviews led me think that this was going to be a tame American attempt at a Flanders, but not here. Hopefully this wasn't just a good batch. Apline is a tiny road-trip away, so I'll be giving this another taste."
"Poured a dark maroon with ruby highlights that had a thin head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The nose was a good interpretation of a flanders red which consisted of vinegar, sour cherries, some oak, and slight acidic notes. Upfront the sour cherries really blend nice with the vinegar flavors with oaky notes coming through to accent the overall taste. I was also glad that the beer was not overly acidic too. The brew was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet, fruity, sour, and slight acidic finish. It drank pretty damn good and I'm always happy to try new sour beers. Decent flanders, good job alpine."
"D- This has not been a style that I have frequently had, yet each time I have had one I really enjoy it. This Ned is delicious and I see myself sipping on this throughout my evening happily. I would seek this out again, but not sure if Alpine is doing this one on a regular/irregular basis."
"Overall, a pretty decent flanders with a lot of solid flavors. Good drinkability. I could have more of this one."
"Bottle shared courtesy of Mothman. Pours a dark, reddish brown color. Slightly murky. Tan head with a nice collar. Tart fruit aroma. Sweet and tart flavors with a slight vinegar taste. Bretty notes as well. Curious as to the barrel they use to age this. Cherries also in the nose. Light mouthfeel. A really good beer in my opinion. Wish this was more available. The only knock is that it could be a tad bit more sour."
"D-pretty solid beer here, a little sweet but a nice oak presence and interesting balance of brett. the acidity is more powerful in the nose than the taste."
"D: Not the best Flanders Red, but a pretty decent interpretation. I wanted to try this beer for over a year, when it was first mentioned, and am glad to have done so."
"Overall more sweet than sour on the continuum, with notable wood influences and a light tartness and with a finish that s a bit short. Sweetness is more apparent in feel than in flavor however."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for opening this brew. Poured a semi-hazy, burnished mahogany with a mere skim of a head that quickly dissipated into a thin band that coalesced around the edges. Nose expresses sour notes, cranberries and Sucrets. Taste reveals vanilla, cinnamon and lightly soured fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a little astringency that comes out towards the back. An interesting spice character not typically associated with the style, but lacking some of the qualities I've come to expect and appreciate."
"This beer almost tastes like a lot of things, which I guess means complexity. Sessionable."
"The beer pours a red amber color with a white head. The aroma is caramel with some light tartness. The flavor is fruit, iced tea, light tartness and caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A pretty nice Flanders Red Ale, but not among the best I have tried."
"A highly drinkable flanders red. I definitely recommend trying it if you get the chance."
"The palate opens with berry-like tartness, mild vinegar and tannic oak. it's thin, almost watery, and rather vinous and oaky. There's a mineral/metallic note in the finish that detracts a bit, but the biggest flaw is that the body and flavors of the beer don't hold up to the oak. Still, a decent interpretation of the style, and quite enjoyable."
"Good effort from the guys at Alpine."
"I've revisited this and there is now a funk to it that wasn't there before. It's a subtle and pleasant funk that adds to the complexity of the beer."
"Not to sweet nor to tart, a great flanders for sure!"
"D - Nice little beer. Thanks, Alpine!"
"NIce, pleasant enough. If moderately priced, would buy all the time."
"Good beer overall though. Does Alpine make a bad one? If so, I haven't had it. Highly drinkable, this one is."
"I am a sour/belgian noob but I have had a couple to date and I think that Ned from Alpine is the best one that I have had so far. I will definitely be picking up some more of this beer if I can make it back over to Alpine before they run out!"
