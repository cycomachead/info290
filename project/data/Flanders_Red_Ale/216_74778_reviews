"Good beer, but not worth the price."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice Flanders Red Ale from Rodenbach, perhaps a bit too sweet for my palette, but the fruit flavors are very enjoyable, delicate and balanced. Another example of why Rodenbach is easily the best producer of Flander's beers in the world."
""
""
""
"Unreal balance between the sweet and sour, neither is dominate, outstanding taste.  Really clean and crisp, this is one outstanding brew."
""

"O:  Dark, brooding and sexy. Tartness of the cranberry and raspberry lend a vivid bite to the primary note of wild cherry, making this a drink to savor slowly. Enjoying it as such maintains an extremely pleasant aroma of red consistently in the mouth."
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic vlaams rood. Unfortunately, mine was more than a year old therefore the fruitiness of the aroma as described by other was strongly reduced. Drink it as you get it!"
""
"Much lighter beer than the grand cru, which is still my favorite they make. Great fruit flavors but I wasn't a fan of the cranberry. I think it gave the beer a dry cranberry bitterness in the finish. Still a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't think I like this as much as standard Grand Cru, but it's tasty!"
"While this beer comes with a significant tag, it is a great beer to have for that special occasion."
"I was afraid I had held onto this too long for the fruit to really come through. Luckily, that is not the case. Amazing fruit aroma, with raspberries leading the way and cherries not far behind. Taste is an absolute delight. Fruity, but still with the complexity of a good Flanders red. Maybe a bit more earthiness and funk would be beneficial, but this is a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall i thought this was awesome. It was quite expensive but if you love fruity sours definitely try this out at least once. If I saw it again I'd pick up the occasional bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Heavy cranberry, lighter sour punch than expected.  Not as balanced as I would have liked."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is glorious! This beer is very sweet and fruity in the smell. The cherries and cranberries are the most dominant in the flavor with a bit of raspberries in the taste. There is a nice bit of tartness with a dry mouthfeel."
""
"Super variation on the style, this was pricey but worth it, as good or better than the flagship beer"
"The flavor profile is World Class and serves as the standard against which others should be judged.  It is intense, quite complex and a brewer's masterpiece of balance.  It begins with a burst of tart fruit, raspberries and cherries, over a slightly sweet background.  In the middle, tartness gives a slight pucker with only the slightest hint of sour vinegar.  The raspberry and cherry fruit flavors slowly subside and cranberry comes to the forefront over a caramel like sweetness.  As the finish approaches, dryness comes to the forefront coupled still with a nice tart pucker and flavor.  In the finish, oak notes come to the forefront coupled with a slow fade of tartness and slight sourness.  A dry pucker lingers."
""
"Thanks to Chuk at Central Market for the last bottle in Austin. Pours up a beautiful ruby, smells of insane amounts of the red fruits as labeled, flavors of the same fruits, very intense, nice and tart, very smooth carbo, medium bodied, slight sweet finish, I think I'm about to mate with Amanda after this beaute."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, no date on the bottle that I could find so I have no idea how old or what batch number this is.  I'm pretty sure I've had this bottle for about a year if not longer, so it does have some age on it.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a slightly hazy ruby red/brown color with about a half inch light tan head.  The head fizzled away quickly, and there isn't much lacing.  Aroma is nice and fruity (sweet and tart), the brew smells like raspberries, cherries, oak, vinegar, lemon and a bit of cranberry.  The taste overall is a bit sweeter than I expected it to be.  It tastes like raspberries, cherries (both sweet and tart ones), cranberries, oak, grape skins, caramel, vinegar and a bit of apple and lemon peel.  The tart flavors were subtle at first, but then got stronger as I finished the bottle.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with a good amount of soft carbonation.  I think this is a pretty good overall brew.  Definitely worth buying if you see it anywhere!  $21.99 a bottle."

"45/50"
""

""
""
"Beautiful hazy auburn pour. Smells like sour cherry syrup. Big juicy fruit flavors, tart cherry, slight acetic presence, bright cranberry and freshly picked raspberries. A bit expensive, but a must try for any fans of Flanders reds, or anybody who likes mouth-wateringly delicious beer."

"This is basically New Glarus-quality fruit beer with an easygoing Belgian Flanders base, which is very nice. The fruit is allowed to shine through excellently, especially enjoyed the cranberry aspect. Easy-going, complex and excellent."

"just amazing, unique, incredibly special beer as good as any i can recall. i dont usually get too into the flanders red type, it always seems more vinegar and acidity than yeast character, and i find it off putting that its usually so sweet as well as sour, a textural and flavor contrast that doesnt often jive with me. this one though, is entirely different. the sour cherries, cranberries, and raspberries are huge contributors right from first splash into my glass. its almost neon red pink, clearish and heady, delicate looking, but really intensely colored. the nose presents the tartness of the fruit, cranberries leading the way, but all three are easy to pick out. there is less body and sweetness than i remember in the grand cru, and i like that a lot. there is a swedish fish aroma, mouthwatering and candy-like, but not all that sweet. the fruit is super authentic, and the beer seems very mature. there is a bit of oak on it too, but not heavy and sweet, and really now showing the usual vanilla much because of the intensity of the fruit. the fruit is right there up front in the taste, but i think i get more cherry first, more raspberry later, the best of both kriek and framboise here, but the finish is what makes this special i think. it has that malt vinegar flavor of the typical flemish red, but its more refined, its really sour, but it carries on forever without being shocking. the finish is the longest ever, super puckery, and not the least bit sweet, with the fruit tartness continuing to come in waves for ages after the swallow. this is one of the best fruit beers ever made in my opinion, extremely memorable and different, and a model for others to strive for in terms of quality. maybe one of my favorite beers ive ever had, which is crazy to me because as good as grand cru is, it wasnt a personal favorite at all. as good as it gets! huge thanks to my brother for sharing this!"

"Another fantastic, fantastic Flanders by Rodenbach, and finally a fruit-forward version. This easily can step up and compete with the best fruit lambics of the rest of Belgium, and of New Glarus."

"Bottle from the Dogz place near Pittsburgh. Pricey. Pours dark red with some brownish hues and a bit of light showing through, along with a nice two finger off white head with some pink tones to it. Awesome aroma of cherries and raspberries, lots if sweet fruit here, light tartness, a bit of oak. Flavor is plenty of sourness but not overbearing acidity on the tongue, some oak here but dominated by fruit, sweet raspberries, lots of cherries, and I assume the cranberries add a bit of the tart tones here. Medium bodied with nearly spritzy carbonation that mingles perfectly with the sourness to balance out all the sweet berries here. World class brew."
""
"To my mind, one of the most remarkable beers in the world and probably the best example of a Flemish Red that I have tried. While I have enjoyed numerous varieties (the classic red, the grand cru, the barrel aged vintage varieties) from this brewery, this has been the most consistently satisfying. If I had to choose one beer to drink the rest of my life, this would be it (as of now). That is why this is the only beer I give a perfect 5."

"Drink- So I had just finished a PNC for my bday and colored me pink when I saw this in the case. Thank god for a caring and understanding GF. Who said its on me. Happy Birthday. Was well worth the review. Great fruits, small oak and just a very good beer."
""

"Mouthfeel: Light to Medium in body. Light to medium in carbonation. The beer itself is very dry and leaves your mouth watering."
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is light. This is a light bodied beer. Great beer."
"Damn near perfect, and I think an improvement over the other Rodenbachs (which I love). This one has the same sharp bite, slightly softened and made more complex by pronounced, but elegant wood, and a winter spice note, probably from the oak and the older beer that plays up a slight sweet note that contrasts beautifully with the red fruit in the sourness and the vinous notes. I absolutely loved this version of a classic. Great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderfully complex and a real pleaser in every way. If i had any criticism at all it'd be that i wanted a tad more of a tart cranberry character. /93"

"Ordered it not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. Excellent fragrance, current and raisin with a balsamic notes near the end . Sour and oak sweetness, great balance! The appearance is unbelievable, would love to enjoy it again on a patio."

"O- So much better than I anticipated. Well worth the 22 bucks. I would buy again, for sure!"

"Drinkability is excellent. Extremely delicious, and impressively elegant. Lots of flavor, but neither the sour, the sugar, or the fruit are exaggerated or out of balance. Outstanding beer, one of the best."

"750ml, corked and caged. And my night is looking up. It pours reddish brown with a light pink dense, almost creamy if it weren't so active, head. Smell. Wow! Cherries, wood, grass, lemons, and something almost cinnamon. The taste is woody, with a cherry aftertaste. Somewhere along the way sugared oranges show up, but it's not sweet, if that makes any sense at all. It's not sour at all, but just delightfully dry. It has some vanilla in the mix and just is really interesting. Every time I try to get a hand on it, something else wells up. Mouthfeel is terrific, slick and slightly tingly. Overall, this is one hell of a beer! I'm not sure what to make of it, but it doesn't care, it has far too much going on to care about my opinion."

"Very nice. Sort of a cross breed between a Flanders Red and a Lambic. Just a great beer!"
""
""
"o - just stupendous. so complex and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Opens on a sweet cranberry note with just a tug of tartness, slowly fading into pure raspberry jam. Ripe blueberry, cherry skin tannins and some silky smooth malt notes in the back. Finish is a touch dry with some oak and lingering dried cranberry and black cherry skin notes. There's a lot of sweetness here, but it's held in check perfectly by some on point carbonation and the nice drying finish. Could easily be the best Flanders red I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a truly outstanding, world-class barrel-aged beer. Thirst-quenching, delicious."
""
"Overall- Very interesting and delicious Belgian sour. After finishing the bottle, I saw that this is a Flanders Red on BA and that really threw me off. This tastes more like a fruit lambic in a lot of ways, although the brown malts do come across more than say, Rosé de Gambrinus. My wife and I certainly enjoyed trying this one! Thank you Eduardo, for the lovely wedding gift."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. This beer is able to destroy the stylistic guidelines with pinpoint accuracy while sending unique yet appropriate flavoring dancing over top of it. The fruit is wonderfully refreshing and authentic, matching the oak in all of its weird glory whole heartedly. The aroma is just as nice, but doesn’t quite set you up for the seriousness of the sip. The mouthfeel, on the other hand, is out of this world, with just the right amount of dryness to match the juiciness and puckering punch of the fruit, grain, and wood. We’ve been quite excited for this one for a while, and oddly enough this is our first taste of any Rodenbach product, despite the fact that we’ve been accruing a vintage vertical in our cellar for the past several years. This beer might be a bit esoteric for some, but for those that can appreciate it, it is downright delicious."
"Lighter side of medium with some nice refreshing carbonation that lightly pricks at your tongue before scrubbing it dry. Very easy to drink and tasty."
""
"I love fruit-forward beers, but the fruit additions in this offering completely overwhelmed the base beer and resulted in something that was overtly sweet and rather one-dimensional. If this were merely a fruited ale, I probably would have given it much better scores. However, knowing how terrific the base beer is, and paying $28 for this ""enhanced"" version, gives me reason to knock it in some aspects. Although most fruit beers are best consumed fresh, this one might actually benefit from some age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was fantastic! The best example of the style that I have had. Very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and I don't have any experience with this style, but I'm pretty sure this is a very good example of a Flanders Red Ale and it reminded me of some of the better funky fruit beers I have had. This beer had nice drinkability, it wasn't overly sour, a little acidic, pretty smooth, clean, refreshing and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I think a full bottle would be a little too acidic for me so I think splitting the bottle with someone is the perfect amount and I could see how this would be a great beer to enjoy in the summer. What I liked the most about this beer was everything, this beer didn't have any weak points in my opinion and there's nothing I can think that would improve this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was how expensive it is, I know it's not cheap to import these Belgian beers, but if the price was lower it wouldn't be just a special occasion beer. I would get this beer again if it saw it, it's very expensive, but I think it's worth it and it makes for a great special occasion beer and I would love to see how it changes over time. I would recommend this to anyone who loves those Funky fruit beers. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I was hoping this was going to be good for how much I paid for it, but it ended up exceeding my expectations and it made for a very enjoyable beer. Good job guys, this was a great and special beer, thanks for sending some to the USA, keep up the awesome work."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Had high hopes for this one, and I wasn't disappointed. I don't like to bring up other beers in my reviews too much, but this reminds me of a certain ""intense"" beer, but improves upon it everywhere that I'd have liked to see it. I guess that when a company does something for 200 years, they do it better than most."

"Such a good idea by these guys to throw some fruit in this beer."

""

""
""

"Fantastic beer. I would rank it among the world class fruited lambics I have had. This is a top-tier sour and perhaps the greatest achievement of the Flemish Red style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pricey but well worth it. This is one of the best sours I've had."
"This is an excellent Flanders Red. It's absurdly fruity, and inexplicably clean. I'm honestly surprised at how good this is. Buy it if you see it."
"Has the base of Rodenbach and then enhances it with delicious fruit infusions. A nice balance of tart and sweet."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Very tasty. It just stampedes with tasty berry flavor with a genuine mix of sweet and sour. A pricey 750 but in my opinion, well worth a try at least once."

"O - A well-done step up from the already-great Grand Cru. Too bad it is so expensive."
"Great even tone to this one. Raspberries are definitely there. Cherries are also there bringing some sour fruit character also. After that, it's kind of hard to tell if I pick up cranberries here with all the typical stuff that comes with the style. Anyways. This beer is awesome. Find me a keg of it, or a river, if you please."
""
""
""
""
""
"Caractere Rouge is a less vinegary example of Flanders Red Ales but is slightly more fruit forward. I love it that the fruits are sweet enough to discern them from another and not so dry that they all begin to taste alike. That sweet-sour-savory medley shows a balance that's rarely found in Sour Ales."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really good. Surprising, as the focus is more fruit and less tart, but it works tremendously."
"O- A very well done sour worth try and the $25 price tag. Definitely will pick this up again!"
""
""
""
""
"Not as exciting as some new age sours, but wonderfully fruity and balanced."
""
""
""
"Final thoughts...another home run for Rodenbach. A perfect marriage of sour cherries, cranberries, raspberries and bacteria. The Lacto is present, but there is most certainly a malt presence on the back of the tongu. Nose is perfumy and enjoyable. I will definitely buy a few more bottles. One of my favorite beers to date!"
""
""
"Overall – It was OK, but I wasn't too fond of this one actually (at least in comparison the original Rodenbach). This was just a little too on the sour red fruit side for me. An interesting try, and if you are looking for a rather sour cranberry flavored beer then this is definitely one to go too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I tried to be moderate in my review, as this is not a style I have frequented often, but there is no doubt that this is a superior ale, and something worth getting your hands on should the opportunity present itself."
""
""
""
"Overall. Elegant simplicity (perfect description from Kathleen). So much fruit flavour for the style which was a bit surprising considering the other rodenbach offerings that are heavier on the sweetness and caramel flavours. Awesome stuff. Thanks again Jeff!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really a gorgeous beer - bright pinkish read with a nice beige-pink lace. Unlike anything else I've had from Rodenbach which tends to be heavy on the balsamic/oak, this is much more similar to something New Glarus would brew. Extremely fruit forward - cranberry, raspberry, cherry dominate the nose and palate. A little tart, a little sweet, but a full on ambush of flavor. This was great."
""
""
"O: The strong red berries really made the difference. I love this one!"
""
""
"Thanks to Simon for sharing the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O: Perfect drinkability. Very fruity, even for a Flanders Red. Extremely balanced and pleasant. Another masterpiece from Rodenbach"
""

"The reveal: Rodenbach Caractère Rouge"
"Very surprised by the reveal."
""

""
""
""
"O: One of the best Flander Red that I have had; the rating by is correct and does this beer justice..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark, slightly dull rusty brown that shines crimson in the light and provides a fizzling pink head. Although the head fades quickly with minimal lacing, it leaves a thin blanketing/halo throughout drinking. The nose is potently fruity with prominent notes of strawberry and cherry (and celery?) followed by a very refined oak acetone. The taste is Flanders red to the max with huge amounts of description-promised strawb/cherry fruitiness, a touch of caramel and wood. Its medium bodied, effervescent, modestly dry and acidic, fruity, bold, and downright drinkable as hell. I highly recommend this brew for those that enjoy a good Flanders and have had the Rodenbach predecessors. It's an excellent beer, one of the best I've had in a long time actually."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just a pure joy to drink. The irony was I was going to buy a bottle of this overseas and pay for the nose, but thought after I had it I wouldn't have to. Now that I've already done it, I want the dam thing even more, and just may buy it just so I can have it again. Can't stop thinking about it, it's truly a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had high expectations going into this beer and wasn't disappointed. The elements of the fruit and base beer work perfectly together without one overshadowing the other. I had to force myself to sip this, as I easily could have killed the whole bottle in no time. I will definitely be seeking out more."
""
"O: Definitely drinkable and complex, but at this point the cherry sweetness is a bit out of proportion. Maybe with some age the fruit will fade and the bugs will do a little more work."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with some raspberry, cherry, cranberry, and raspberry vinaigrette. Taste is much the same with a nice fruity finish and a slight acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is really tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""

"Bottle from Etre Gourmet. Served in a Rodenbach goblet. Pours a fairly-bright cherry-red color. Short pink-hued head that dissipats quickly. Heavy cherry with mild raspberry and cherry. More cranberry in flavor. Super fruity. Moderately tart. High carbonation and super dry. Too fruity at this point, though hopefully that calms down and brings out the base a bit more. Also didn’t have that nice yeast-driven acidity of most Rodenbach yet. Could also use a bit more body."
""
""
"Big thanks goes out to cmrillo for sharing this one during the One Year Anniversary of My Wreck Tasting! Served from bottle into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured a deep ruby red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, sour, tart, wood, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, tart cherry, wood, subtle funk, and sugar. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. In typical Rodenbach fashion, they knocked this one out of the park. Really complex, tart, and sour all while be refreshing at the same time. While there wasn’t a huge amount of complexity going on here, it was just the right about in my opinion for the style. This made it quite easy to drink and extremely enjoyable. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance, you won’t regret it!"
""
"O: it was just a decent flanders. I honestly would prefer alexander better and have real fruit flavor than juice type taste."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet, lots of cherries, lots of fruit, lots of fruit, seriously this is a cherry bomb. Other flavors fight to get through but ultimately fail. I liked this beer but it would have been better if it wasn't just a one note beer. Not as sweet as the redbach thankfully."

"Overall I was slighlty underwhelmed by the offering to be honest. I was super pumped for it but the sour profile and high effervescence made this seem like a carbonated fruit juice than a Flanders Red Ale. Base beer is really mitigated by the sweet fruity berry flavors with lower tartness than I was expecting/hoping for. Maybe with time this could develop into something but right now it is merely good and not elite as I was expecting."
"OVERALL: A good beer that we thoroughly enjoyed, especially in a hotel room after a 12 hr. beer festival. Lots of good fruit aroma and flavor on this one, though the look and feel could use some re-thinking. An enjoyable brew I'd love to have again. Trade me more so I can open it with you Dennoman. Cheers!"
"Overall: A nice fruited Flanders-style beer. Too sweet for me to drink a lot of but there isn't a lot to drink so I guess that's not a problem. Reminds me a lot of Ocean Spray or Cran-apple Cider."

"A fantastic beer really. I wish it could get some head retention but it is nonetheless a very tasty beer and exceptionally balanced."

"A really nice beer from Rodenbach that I will have again, no doubt. I'm going to stock up on bottles, as I think this even has additional room for improvement. Good stuff!"
"The palate opens clean and sour with a big, bright cherry character, super bright and refreshing. A little bit of a raspberry-like character is present too. There is a little bit of acetone, but it works on the palate too. Medium light in body, medium high in carbonation, this beer is just fantastic."

"Pour a dark reddish brown color with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of tart cherries, funk, yeast, a bit of vinegar, some sweet fruits, some tart fruit. The flavor is pretty tart up front with some fruity tartness and a bit of acid. The fruit comes in midway to provide some sweet balance before a bit of funk, vinegar, and tannic oak step in. Medium body with a sharp level of carbonation that provides for a prickly mouthfeel. I rather enjoyed this one, its good now, but almost feels like a few years would do wonders to help meld the flavors a bit."
"This is a medium bodied and modestly carbonated offering. The alcohol is well hidden but the hints of medicinal aspect keeps it from being stellar. I am really taken back by how fruity this is and how much it has altered the base beer. Straight from the pour, it looks fruited and it captures a fruity aromatic quality that filled the room we were sitting in while enjoying this. It was nice to try it and say I had it, but i think i give the nod to the gramd cru as being what I would rather spend my money on. Maybe with some age, as the fruit mellows out my opinion might change but as-is this is a fruity medicinal bugger."
"I could drink an entire case of this stuff. Time to trade for my own bottle."
"D - Awesome stuff - I probably should have ordered more. I crushed my glass and filled it up again before sharing the rest with the SF/Chicago hags. Nice to see Rodenbach stepping up and not merely resting on their laurels."

"The pour is a lightly hazed ruby color with a pink head. Very nice nose of berries. Cranberry and raspberry are strong, but the cherries are not quite as pronounced. A mild sweetness, not all that vinegary. The flavor has a very strong raspberry note and a more subdued cherry and cranberry profile. Hint of red wine vinegar, a definite sweetness, light oak and must. Really nice."
"Big thanks to jedwards for breaking this one out. Pours a beautiful raspberry hue with no head. Nose expresses raspberries and tart cherries. Taste consistent with nose - bold and fruity with a slight tart quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation, a slight acidity and easy easy astringency. This is a top notch beer, although not sure I would classify it as a Belgian Strong Dark. Not overly sour, very approachable to various taste and there's some definite cellaring potential here. I'd like to score a bottle to sit on for a couple years."

"The beer is a gorgeous, radiant, dark ruby color, like a gem. A thin pink head rests atop the beer, leaving sparse lacing on the tulip. The aroma is wild and funky, like a fruit lambic. Smells very sweet. Huge raspberry presence, similar to a framboise. Sweet and teeming with berry flavor, balanced by a bit of tartness and wild yeast character. A great candidate for sharing, as the sweetness is a bit much after a small serving. Overall, very tasty, albeit a bit too sweet for me personally. While not my absolute favorite offering from Rodenbach, I enjoyed this. Recommended."
"O: Overall a very good beer, but it needs some time to age/mellow a bit (so the tart acidity can work itself out). I think the long-term potential for this beer to be wonderful is very high. I'll be curious to see how Batch 2 (approx. 10k bottle production) drinks compared to this (Batch 1, 900 bottles)."
"Overall - Impressive all around, but especially the fruit character. Beautifully crafted beer. Don't expect a beat-you-over-the-head sourness."

"I gotta say, the Rodenbachs killed it on this particular day. #2 beer of the afternoon (after Alexander Rodenbach)."
"O - an exceptional beer!"

"Great stuff. I love the fact that they are experimenting at Rodenbach. Honestly I think that they should do more. Some of the wierd stuff that they have done over years the has been great (Vin De Cereale, Alexander) and I would include this one in that group."
"Worth the try and the extremely higher price tag, by far one of the most interesting beers I have tasted this year. From the use of different fruits and the wood aging ... epic."
