"Acidic aroma of tart cherry preserves and red wine with a touch of caramel in the background.  The flavor is milder, with a rounder acidity than the aroma would imply with the same dark sugar and fruit notes as in the nose.  Like that acidity, the sweetness is a bit less pronounced than in some examples of the style and it balances nicely.  Complex, balanced, and subtle this is perhaps the first HF beer that I have had that fully lives up to their substantial reputation, and it is one of the best beers I have had in quite a while."

"O: this is one of the best Flemish Reds I have ever had.  After wandering in the wilderness for many years hating sours, it has become one of my favorite categories and Flemish Reds/Browns my favorite style of the sour family.  That hint of Robitussin on the finish makes me shudder but the rest is excellent.  Well done."

"O: Great representation of the style. Would recommend and would most certainly drink again"

"Overall: A surprisingly mellow sourness to this flander red. This is one of the best Flanders Red that I have had. Not much Port wine influence, but just enough so that you know that its there. Another great brew by Hill Farmstead. An excellant mouthfeel with this beer."

"Overall: A very good representation of a Flanders Red. Nice leathery, fruity notes along with just a bit of sour and funk. A tasty brew."

"M - Medium body. Dry. Moderate carbonation."
"Pour is dark copper brown with a thin tight tan head. Nose has a hint of dark malt base with some sawdust and sour cherry. Taste is similar, a little watery and less bright than the nose. There is a stronger dark malt component than a normal Flanders red, fairly sour with notes of tart sour cherry but a bit thin in flavor through the finish. Very strong carbonation on a lighter body. No glaring flaws, not acetic at all but not bright and a bit watery."

"O-An amazing sour. What a good beer. Sean Hill can do no wrong!"
""
"O- This was a very nice unique take on a Flander's. There aren't many breweries that make use of port barrels and I like how the port brought out a little bit more of the vinous dark fruit qualities of the beer while adding a nice barrel presence. I wish I had another bottle to experiment with cellaring for another year or two."

"Decent Flanders Red. There was something odd about this one that is different from the others I've had. It might be the strong dryness on the backend that threw me off. Still, this is a well-put together beer that may interest you if you enjoy the Flanders Red style."

"O: A very solid flanders red. Quite possibly the best American attempt at the style I've had. Much more depth and complexity than something like Oude Tart, but lacking in that refreshing cherry acidity that beers like Cuvee Des Jacobins Rouge possess. A nice beer. Glad to have another to sample in time."

"The first iteration of a Flanders Red Ale I've had from Hill Farmstead and its predictably awesome. Great flavor, excellent feel, and a nose and appearance that ties everything together. Very good."

"p.s. After dumping the yeast from the bottom of the bottle in the flavor improved noticeably."

"Overall quite nice to start, nice nose, nice initial flavor, but the finish gets a little icky."
""
"O - Overall not a bad beer, fairly straight forward. Not a fan of the finish."
"O- honestly I have not had many Flanders red's so I don't have much to compare to, but it was surprisingly drinkable and tart. No harshness at all with a subtle oak dryness."
""
""
"The beer is mahogany to crimson colored with a thin collar. Aromas of oak, cherries, vinegar, plums, wine. Very nice. The flavor follows suit, with sour cherries and an overall acetic character. Vinous and lightly sweet. Grapes and cherries. Some musty oak. An outstanding representation of the style. Delicious."

"What can I say, the taste of tart cherries sat on my palette for a half hour after I finished the beer. i couldn't stop thinking about it. The only thing I could possibly follow it up with was an Elaborative #1. there was nothing else in my cellar that would do it justice after this."
"Overall, this is an excellent example of the style. I'm very impressed by how well the nose and flavor is balanced. I assume there was some blending involved, if so, it was done masterfully. The appearance is gorgeous due to the dark color and head that won't recede. How the alcohol has mellowed and integrated with the flavors is especially impressive. In my opinion, I would not age this brew. It's already spent two years in barrels and is ready to enjoy now."

"O- Full disclosure, I've only had a handful of Flanders Red Ales in my time. This one is by far the most balanced and easiest to drink of the style, despite being the strongest. The oak really shines. Prolegomena is another fantastic beer from Hill Farmstead."
""
""
""
"O-the flavors in this beer were unique and complex, really like this style"
"O- I am trying to be critical of this, but it is difficult to do so. Prolegomena is a well-made beer that is ready to drink right this second. There is a perfect balance between the acid and funk that makes this beer dangerously drinkable. I've found with some beers from this style, a 4 ounce pour is more than enough. I could easily drink a bomber of this by myself, and would only be detoured from continuing by the alcohol content. Another home run from Shaun and crew!"

"Overall - Decent flanders. A little too dry for me."

"O~ all around perfect 4. not the best Flanders Red i've ever had but i love the spices that come out even if they may not really be there. not overly tart which is nice as well in this type of brew and a lot of barrel characteristics that HF seems to be really good at with their wild ales. now that its getting warmer i'm boosting the ""taste"" up a bit, so yeah... let it warm up quite a bit."
""
""
"O. A little lacking in the appearance, but the rest really shines: a beauty, otherwise. Great oak character."

"Overall: A very impressive Flanders Red from Shaun and company. I'm not typically a fan of this style, but this was executed very, very well. Age not needed on this one... it's amazing now."

"Very enjoyable brew. I expected nothing less from Hill Farmstead with this one. I love sours, but this beer opened my eyes up to the fact that a well-rounded sour and not a ""pucker-your-lips-with-alum"" sour is the bar to measure this style against. Very glad I got to share the first released bottle of this beer with some good friends."
