"The cherry juice creates a well balanced 'sweet-n-sour' with Brettanomyces yeast. The smell definitely has some funky earth to it."
""
""

"Lots of brettanomyces funkiness. Not a lot of sweet,  sour,  or cherry. Would have liked more of all three."

"Overall though it's like a kriek and standard Flanders red ale mixed into one, absolutely great beer love it."
"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass)."

"A solid Flanders Red from De Proef Brouwerij."

"O - - A nicely balanced and minor twist on a classic style, but not altogether mind blowing. Worth a try, I'd pick it up again for a refresher."
"Overall: Not extremely memorable, but still a good beer. Not sure that I would get this again, but would recommend as a good beginner beer for someone new to sours."

"Sour cherry note predominates. The sourness is a bit on the mild side but it makes for a very friendly beer. Hints of clove and black pepper linger toward the finish. Given the sweet and sour nature, this finishes quite dry. Medium-light in body. Carbonation could be a touch more heightened to liven up the mouthfeel a bit more. But as it stands, it is a nice food beer. We enjoyed vegetarian stir-fry noodles and it complimented but cut through the soy flavor nicely."

"O-This beer gets props for tasting like real cherry juice, but I'm not sure that real cherry juice flavor makes for a good beer in this instance. As noted above, it tastes more like a out-of-date kid's juice box than a Flanders Red Ale. A little more useful acidity might have helped here."
"Sampled from a 750ml bottle. Nice appearance with a reddish brown color and a moderate beige head. Lively. Aroma has fruit and a hint of the sour/tart/funk to come. The sour/tart/funky flavor is balanced and well behaved yet complex and inspiring. I really enjoyed it from start to finish."
""
"O: This beer isn't very sour so it would make for a good beer for someone to try that is trying the style for the first time. There's just enough cherries and sweetness to prevent this from being very sour."
""
"Lighter side of medium body with some creamy mouthfeel due to the good amount of tiny carbonation. A strange beer that I doubt I would try again as there are many better Flanders red available compared to this."
"The beer isn't as sweet as the more popular cherry sour ales but isn't as dry as the more authentic Kriek Ales. Its medium intensity and medium weight makes it ideally suited for like-minded cuisine- like Mu Shu Pork?"
"Pours out a hazy rusty red. Cherry smell is pretty big up front. Faint tart smell in the background, but cherry pushes it out. Taste is interesting. Not your typical Flemish red. Has a pretty big hit of brett along with the usual tartness. The cherry is a little much. Kind of sweet too. Fairly heavy body with some stinging carbonation (although low carbonation; weird). I think I'd like this a whole lot more if it weren't for the cherry."
""
""
"This is going down the drain. It has some nice flavors mixed in with just not good ones. It honestly is impossible to get past 10 oz of this which means a full 16 oz pour is going down the drain. I'd worry about an old bottle but this style shouldn't be hurt by some age. Sorry but apples and cherry a great ideas in a sour, but it has to be sour. This isn't sour. It isn't good."
""
""
"Overall, it's almost good. Too sweet with odd off-notes."
""
"This pours a hazy, slighty yeast dregs tea brown with a small short lived tan head which doesn't leave a lacing. The smells are slighly funky, a nice mixture of sweet cherries and barnyard funk from brett, a slight vinegar smell. The feel is medium, okay carbonination. The taste is slightly sweet up front followed by a very strong earthy funky brett taste, with a little bit of sourness, more of a sweet and funk than a sweet and sour, nice though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I just didn't enjoy this very much. The flat medicinal grainy taste ruined it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, solid version f the style. A welcoming volume with the bomber providing plenty to appreciate. Try this."
""
""
""
""
"Not as funky as I'd like in a red. The malt possesses great depth and character but needs more funky foil."
""
"O- I really like this one. I'm new to the style so maybe that's part of it, but I'm pleased."
"totally different than any other flemish red ive had. pours a little redder than copper, with a touch of haze and a one inch tan head that has nice patchy retention. smells smokey, familiar but i dont know how. also lots of tart cherries in the nose. yeasty too. flavor is so weird, earthy, but its got a beef jerkey sort of flavor that comes from the aroma. hard to describe really, any cherry or brett flavors take a back seat to that beefy meaty smoke flavor. i dont dislike it, but its really different. feel is good, well carbonated with a medium body at the most. a 750ml is a lot of this beer, but it works for me i guess. worth a try for its distinct aromatic and flavor profile, but dont come in expecting a traditional flemish sour."

"Not as sour as I hoped... Recommended, but don't go in expecting too much."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing on the glass as well. Aromas of big tart cherry, cherry skin, apple, cranberry, earthiness, funk, grass, oak, light acidity, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, apple, cranberry, pepper, earth, grass, light vinegar, oak, and yeast spices. Light tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, apple, cranberry, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice tart and sweet flavor balance and complexity; with cherry sweetness being more prominent. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and syrupy mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Very smooth to drink but is a bit of a sipper. Overall this is a fantastic, very pleasant, and enjoyable Flanders red ale. Nice complexity and balance; and very smooth to drink. I had no trouble finishing the 750."
"High B-"
"Pours a murky brown with a 3 inch foamy beige head that settles to a craggy cap on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain, earthy yeast, funk, and some sour cherry aromas. Taste is of sour cherry and mild Brett funk up front with some earthy grain flavors on the finish. This beer lives up to its name and is indeed sweet and sour at the same time. There is a lower level of carbonation with only a slight crispness. Overall, this is a good beer that is quite tasty and easy to drink."

"I was a little disappointed at first because I like outrageously sour beers. This is way drinkable, just very tame for my palate. Might be a good beer for folks gettin' their toes wet with sour beers."
"O- its a decent beer but I like a bit more sour."
"O: overall, I have had better but not terrible."
""
"3.5 D: Decent beer. Nothing to write home about though. It costs about as much as Rodenbach, though, so I don't see a reason to buy this one again."
""
""
"Decent but definitely had better. May drink again if given a bottle."
""
""

"O - Superb, a yeast lovers beer. Balanced, sweet and sour as the name says."
""
""
""
""
"A rather underwhelming beer. The sweetness is a bit too much, very artificial flavor. Small servings are suggested with this beer. A little goes a long way."
""
""
""
""
""
"I would have no hesitation with buying another bottle."
""
""
""
"O- This is one of my favorite beers of all time. Perfection in a glass. This is a 5 for me. I was suprised though at the lack of sourness this beer had. Note: This cork is very difficult to get off!"
""

"Pours a nice ruby color, off white head and nice lacing. Aroma of berries, so quite fruity and slight hint of funk. In the taste, a nice tart sourness, mild acidity, sugary malt, and a hint of cherry juice. Very well balanced with a perfect mix of sweet, sour, malt, and fruit. Ever so slight touch of red wine vinegar. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and drying. Overall, one of the best examples of the Flanders style, and the fruit is downplayed and left in the background where it belongs. Well done."
"Overall: A slightly fuller bodied, less spritzy-assertive version of Flanders Red than Duchesse De Bourgogne, which I consider the cranberry soda of the beer world. Very drinkable, but not quite as sour as I anticipated, which is not a knock; this is well within style. I do live very close to the Jolly Pumpkin, however, and anticipate more than a complimentary sourness in sour ales as a result. This might be a good launching point for anyone wanting to be introduced to the sour ale category."
"Flavor is drier than I expected. Not extreamly sour either but a nice refreshing combination of the two base flavors - Quite refreshing very drinkable with a supple mouthfeel that invites another retained swishing mouthful."
"mouthfeel - want a bit more sour in there. great to perfect carbonation. medium to thick body. no cloying. extremely drinkable."
"Overall, this one was a bit too sweet for my liking, but is a decent representation of the style."
"D: This was a nice Flanders red. The sourness was very balanced with sweetness. The body was a bit weak, but there was no alcohol noticeable, so it was very easy to drink. Probably best fresh, because the cherry character will likely fade with age. Recommended."
"O: Overall this was a really great beer. I expected that it would be really sour and it wasn't. This is the perfect beer for people to try who want to enjoy a slightly sour beer without it being overwhelming."
"D- very drinkable introductory sour. Yum!"
"Overall, a good example of a style for the Flemish sour. Not as sour as Dutchess or Monk's Cafe, nor as vegetal as Bourgogne de Flandres: a very effective compromise"
"If I hadn't drank this against Duchesse, I probably would have liked it more. Overall it's nice, but not great."
"Verdict: Good and unique beer that's worth the price."
"The taste is a little tougher to measure. The beer falls somewhere between the sweetness of a Duchesse and the tartness of a Rodenbach, but not quite as good as either. The beer is tilted towards the sweetish side, but has a tartness, some cherry mouthpuckering, and lots of Belgian yeastiness to complement the sweetness. The beer definitely gets more balanced as it warms. Too chilled, and the tartness is just not felt. The beer is complex, has plenty of unique yeast qualities that bring out the sourishness in the otherwise fairly sweet malts. The cherry flavors are also quite complex and run the gamut from mouthpuckering tartness, to slightly sour, to marachino like in their sweetness. There's lots going on in this beer, lots to like, but I prefer a Duchesse or a Rodenbach just a bit more. The Flemish Red style is a real treat. L'Chaim."
"Pretty good Flemish here... I didn't find this amazing but I can see myself grabbing this one again..."
"I split this with GalenGeueze. We decided this was worth a repurchase but as it was a 750 ml bottle, it not something we would want to drink alone as it was more of a dessert style and not a session beer."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Pours a very hazy, amber/cherry cola color with some nice sudsy off white head, about a finger. Very nice lacing and some good retention. Smells very barrely/funky. Some cherry and dried fruit coming through. A little of that sweet Belgian sugar scent and a light spicy yeast smell. Flavor is very soft for a sour. Sweet upfront, middling tartness. Cherries throughout. Definitely on the sweeter side of things. Nice consistent creamy little bubbles. Gonna be a stretch to finish this whole bottle, but all in all, a good brew."
"D: Having a hard time enjoying this one. It's tolerable, but I wish the bottle wasn't 750ml's. ended up pouring half out."
"drinkability: decent by also one of the worst Ive had in the style"
"This wonderful Flemish Ale could become a regular in my beer cellar."
"I could see this being a very drinkable Flanders red, it doesn't insist upon itself the way some do, but it's the real deal, lots of sourness and interesting undertones, could see this becoming a regular drinker."
"Split a large bottle at The Farmhouse. Wow, I think this is the best Flemish Red I've had. It lacks the sickly-sweet hit, like in Duchess, and instead has an almost dry fruit punch taste with apples and berries. Of course, the beer is dominated by by sour brett character with an Orval-like catty flavor over sweaty funk and lemon peel."
"Very drinkable flanders red despite the sweetness detracting a bit for myself. Cherry juice really rounds this beer out well. Could have many more glasses."
"This isn't a flanders red to me, but a really nice brett wild ale. I recommend this."
"Drink is pretty good, sour/tart flavors hit hard but not overwhelming, some vinegar and acidic flavors, but overall pretty drinkable."
"DB- Sweet but it doesn't bother me at all here. The smell is absolutely fantastic. Complex with nice cherry."
"Very smooth, light, drinkable. Carbonation is spot on. I'm pretty unfamiliar with this style but this felt pretty solid."
"Very drinkable sour. Great balance"
"MF/D- Moderater body with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good, but would be better if it wasn't for that damn grape soda flavor. Nice dryness in the finish."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The color is a red amber with a good light tan head and some lacing. The nose is red wine, tart cherries, mild vinegar, and a bit of funk. The taste adds in a bit of oak and is a bit heavy on the acetic acid. Good puckering feel with some light funk and oak. Drinks quite well; another enjoyable brew from De Proef."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I like it. I would definitely like to have it again. Very nice"
"The strongest taste is the sour cherries and some hops. There is a good balance between the maltiness and the hops though. Fruity alcohol and sourness was evident in the aftertaste. There is very little carbonation so it was a little flat in the mouth. As I drank more of this, the sourness became too strong."
"Pours out a dark amber color withblittle to no head. The smell is very interesting. It has a slight lactic and acetic sourness along with a meat-like quality. Partially good partially bad. On the palate it is much better. There is a slight residual sweetness to acompany the sourness that is very nice. A downside is the same aroma comes back up through the back of my nose, bringing with it the meat quality. The beer grows on me though as I drink more of it."
"D: Not something that can be downed quickly but definately a very enjoyable beverage."
"Pours a red/brown color with a small off white head. I get alot of strawberry and a port-like sweetness on the nose, a slight acidity and a light sour twang. Round, sweet with a sour/bitter finish, rich cherry candy sweetness. A dessert sipper possibly, a bit too rich for my tastes although the beer is pretty medium in body. I probably wont finish this bottle or the other 5 i somehow came into along the road, another strange brew from De Proef.."
"D- my tasting partner silently decided to abstain from the rest of this bottle, and I ended up pouring out my last glass. It was just not good."
"Drinkability: I didn't finish the bottle, this was just a little one dimensional."
"D - after pouring I knew I was going to really enjoy this beer, had a moment a few years ago when i got big into sours/oud bruins/etc and this beer might have restarted it - will seek out the Cantillons and Drie Fonteinens of the world"
"D: I haven't been all that crazy about a lot of the De Proef beers, but this one was very nice. I'll have to see how the bottles in my cellar hold up."
"The beer pours a hazy brown-red color with a white head. The aroma is tart with some sour wheat, lemons, brett funk and vegetables. The flavor is sour wheat, citrus, lemons, sour dark fruit, corn, green vegetables and cherries. A very odd mix of flavors but I think it works pretty well. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Real easy to drink. I wish I had bought two of these."
"Awesome, easy drinking beer. Love the sweet/sour quality of the brew. Real nice."
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation up front which quickly gives way to a sweet yet tart fruit flavor that lingers into a dry finish. Prominent earthy oak with hints of vanilla adds nice complexity and balances out the lactic sourness and sweet tart dark berry flavor. Well balanced and extremely drinkable."
"D: My friends tried half the bottle and quit. I'm struggling to finish up here, and thought, ""I have some time to go back and write the review."" -- Something I don't normally do with the great ones."
"Ridiculously easy to drink, especially at 7%. DeProef continues to be my favorite Belgian brewery at the moment. Their list of amazing beers is something else, and I'm not even considering the people they contract-brew for."
"3.5/3.5/3/3.5/3.5"
"Taste is a litlle disappointing. Doesn't have the tang of a Rodenbach or quite the pucker of La Folie. Has some cherry and sour fruit notes, but overall the taste profile is just a little flat. Low carbonation, so this is pretty easy to put away, but I probably would look at other choices."
"I ended up pouring some into my 5gl batch of Kriek fermenting away in the bathroom. It is going to end up quite the potpourri."
"D: Oh, sweet nectar of the gods. The definition of drinkability. Complex enough to keep your interest through the entire bottle and yet light enough (ABV 7%) to make it sessionable. Another simply wonderful brew from The Prof."
"D: I couldn't even finish my glass. The sweetness becomes very cloying, and quickly."
"overall a nice red ale, maybe more of a sour ale."
"This beer just doesn't disappoint by any measure. Damn, it tastes delicious and perfect. Makes you wonder why people rave over legitimately good American wild ales while never mentioning Belgian greats beyond Cantillon. Cherry/plum alcohol, nice sweet counterplay, the sour doesn't reach bracing levels but is rather well balanced by the sweet malt and sugar. Tart, refreshing, addictive. Soft body, silky-like with just enough carbonation, very good."
"D – Overall, this beer is a weak example of one of the greatest styles of beer in the world."
"I really enjoyed this bottle and will for sure be picking up a couple more to share with others. Very good example of the style and already having a few other sour ales this would be a great one to begin your introduction."
"Why are you still reading this? Give this a pass."
"O: A well balenced Fanders Red. Easy drinker for the style, there are other sour ales that will blow it away on the pucker rating. As the beer warms more complexities come through. I would recommend this to someone who has not tried a sour ale, before introducing them to more ""in-your-face"" sour beers."
"Not too bad. I expect it reflects the style and that I will be trying more of the same as the chance arises."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Very drinkable as a sour ale. I like it."
"D: My first sip was awesome, the next weren't so awe-inspiring, but this is a great beer. I am having no problem finishing this 750, not sure I would reach for another right now, but I would happily drink this again. Well worth seeking out, highly recommended."
"All in all, a good beer, but not a repeat purchase for me, and not a substitute for my poor missing Rodenbach."
"Can't say enough about how much I admire this brew from a fine brewery. De Proef has been a great find for me so far and this brew is at the top of the list."
"Good flavor all around and a nice presentation. A nice flemish ale that I would have again if the opportunity presented itself."
"Large bottle, typical Belgian broad shouldered bottle. Pours tequilla sunrise red, the head is soft, fluffy head a dull shade of medium khaki, that leaves thick sheeting and reveals an earthy nose, with some funky components. This a spiced up and warming brew. Spices seem to be in the neighborhood of mild holiday. Tasty and complex, with notes of ripe cherries and other fruits as it warms and opens up. Delicious brew. Interesting and different. Eclectic Belgian lovers will surely enjoy this one"
"a nice balanced flemish red with a mild sour and a unique mild bitter earthy finish of tobacco and fruit. not as dark as most but still not to off the wall. really nice head. nose of floral cherry and a some alcohol. not too yeasty. earthiness is almost a mildly burnt clove that blend wonderfully with the oak and cherry and soft sweet. not metallic in mineral nature. very nice. very good example of the style."
"I wish this were a tad sweeter. The tartness is wonderful but needs to be balanced by more sweetness. I'd still have to go with Rodenbach, Duchesse, or Goudenband over this, but it's still a very enjoyable brew."
"This poured the classic mahogany color with almost no head and a little fizz rising up. The smell was nice, mildly fruity with a dry hint in there. The taste was lacking in my opinion. Not much depth, the up front kriek was there from them adding ""cherry juice", but no dryness to back it up. It was drinkable but I probably wouldn't go after it again. Monk's Cafe is a decent amount better as an entry in to the style for some."
"D- Very drinkable considering the style."
"this one seemed to be on the mild side of flanders red, but balance seemed to be the name of the game. gorgeous dark red with a pink tan tint to the head. very good retention and lace. don't normally see that in flemish reds. nose and taste exhibit wood plank, earthy worm casting, dark fruit and a touch of cider. not extreme, but extremely pleasant. silky smooth and yummy. unique and traditional at the same time to me for this style."
"Mouth puckering sour tartness takes the lead by a slim margin over the brettomyces funk and cedar plank flavors. Some lighter berry notes come through with some strawberries and sour cherries. Earthy in it's own way with some of the caramely malt sweetness making an appearance as it warms a bit. Wonderful sour beer, one of my favorites."
"D: In terms of De Proef beers, the funk element here is hardly detectable, which makes the beer very drinkable. Good balance of sourness and the malts."
"Drinkability? No problems with the abv, plenty of flavour, I'll have no problem finishing the last pour from the bottle which, btw, is decidely cloudy now. A very enjoyable brew and I again thank Joe for his generosity and spirit of adventure as I don't think that I'd have ever sought this beer out on my own. When I visit a beer store with a lot of Belgians, I get overwhelmed! ;^)"
"I would buy it again, to share. I polished the 750 myself and was not sorry."
"D- I don't think I will be purchasing this again. It's drinkable in the sense that you can't taste any booze at all but it's not drinkable in the sense that it's fizzy and too acidic."
"D - Very nice overall with a great sweet and sour interplay, especially in the nose. The tannins are a bit excessive for my palate, and the funk might be overdone as well, but all in all, one of the best Flemmish Reds I have come across."
"750ml rubber corked & caged. Poured into a chalice glass, its an opaque tan brown with no real head. Smells sugary, like black cherries. Sweet only while you hold it in the front of your mouth, then instant sour tartness. The cherry taste predominates. Not much complexity, it just has the same flavor characteristics throughout, with which it beats you. Mouthfeel has a nice slight carbonation & nice slickness, but is a bit thin in the end. Drinkability is not bad, the sourness leaves you with a shadow of its sweet counterpart. Good to try but I'd stick with the Duchess de Bourgone if I was to stick."
"D - definitely not worth the $10.99 per bottle considered that Duchesse de Bourgogne was the same price. I feel constantly let down by this style because Duchesse was the first one that I tried and I'm always expecting that level of acetic acid character. This isn't your typical Flanders Red because it's sweet, while also being sour. If you're interested in the style, try this, but otherwise, don't waste your money. Buy some Duchesse de Bourgogne instead."
"Notes: A nice, very drinkable ""sour"" beer. The texture is smooth and round, not overly funky, not really sour, just tart. Nicely made, not great. Might drink again if the chance arises."
"the smoothness in the mouthfeel creates a pretty palatable brew with good drinkability for the style... but like any Flanders, this one's a sipper. A bit heavy on the funk, but the strength of the cherry notes really wins me over and the perfectly drying body with just a slight warming quality works beautifully. Definitely a must try."
"This is interesting, but just does not do it for me. Fairly simple for the style, and not very subtle. This is not my favorite De Proef offering."
"very smooth and mellow for the style."
"D- The 750ml bottle of this beer may be a bit too much for me due to the sweetness. However, this is a pretty unique and interesting beer that is definitely worth a try."
"Mouth: If the aroma translated exactly over to the flavor this beer would be world class, but it doesn't quite. Seems a little thin and fizzy on the palate, leading to unsupported flavors. What I can taste is lightly tart with black cherries and a trademark bretty earthiness in the finish. What's missing is the malt/ester sweetness dueling with the vinegary sharpness that I get from Duchesse or La Folie when I consider the stylistic pinnacle. Not bad but definitely a tier below the best."
"First pour resulted in a 2 finger white head on a dark purple body. Great lacing on the glass through out the drink. Some light grapes on the nose, but nothing in your face aroma wise. Tasty mild sour though. I'd say this is a good starter sour in the vain of Duchess de borgone. Very similar, with maybe less vinegar on the tongue. Easy to drink, light in alcohol, but pricey next to duchess at almost 14 bucks for a 750."
"D; A real nice Flemish Red here. Its got the solid acidity this style needs with a lot of complexity. Very enjoyable."
" Overall a good job by De Proef but not mindblowing, a good choice to introduce a newbie to the style."
"Pours a hazy dark mahogany with red tinges. A large off-white head gives way to a half-finger of foam and a lot of lacing after a while. That signature Brett smell hits immediately, with all of its usual sour, musty character; the sour cherries only come through afterward, though they are quite strong. The funk dominates the taste as well, with citric sourness and leather both prominent. A hint of chocolaty roasted malt comes next, with the real cherry taste only evident after a few sips. A definite woodiness in the background. Another great beer from the Proefbrouwerij."
"Very exciting. Very tasty. I love it. I will buy this one again, for sure."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Poured into a Duvel glass, this has a rusty brown color, with a persistent and thick inch-tall head. Fruity, very tart aroma, with a nice musty-cellar earthiness. Wow, a lot more brett-like character comes through in the flavor than I expected, or is usual for the style, and less sourness. There's a nice cheesy leather flavor up front, with a sour cherry fruitiness winding things up. There's even some drying bitterness in the middle that makes things rather interesting. Very curious, unique, and quite tasty!"
"Bottle. Pours reddish amber with a thick cream-colored head. Aroma of apples and cherries, with some stinky cheese. Taste vastly improves as the beer warms. Cherry, caramel, and malt up front that turns sour quickly when cold, but smoothly when warmer. A tart, sweet finish. Definitely a sipper."
"Drinkablility: Good for being such a bret. driven brew."
"D - With food - absolutely. I'm thinking venison or some sort of meat that has a fruit-laden reduction sauce. Drinking it solo isn't really inspiring for me, but to each his own!"
"this brew pours a murky amber color with a decent off white head. great lacing all down my glass. the nose is sour, cherries, subtle malt. the taste is sour! fruits, complete tartness, cherries. full bodied, low carbo, sweet finish"
"Very drinkable for the stlye."
"A fun beer to drink -- interesting and different. Perhaps not as radically funky and sour as some are used to, but a good introduction to sour beers for the relatively uninitiated, and a pleasant sipper for an evening."
"Pretty good overall but not nearly as good as Rodenbach Grand Cru. Quite enjoyable and not too sour. A good intro to funky beers."
"d: I've said it before, I'll say it again: I love sour beers."
"Notes: This is a good beer in its own right but in the past two weeks, I've had decidedly better beers, the Ommengang Rouge and Rodenbach Grand Cru. This doesn't stack up too well against them, though."
"Grainy flavor, iron and blood, sort of ugly smell. Not sure if this changed in recipe since I had it several years back but this bottle sucked bad."
"Nice reddish brown color with a creamy tan head. The nose has tart fruits, ripe berries and musky barnyard wood. The taste is similar. Perhaps not as potent as other red's, but has a nice balance between sweet malts, tart citrus and oaky funk. Crisp body suits ale well. A superb brew and my new favorite from DeProef."
"Incredibly drinkable woody and earthy tartness. THe vinegar is subsided in the taste. Good brett presence gives it a rather saison bandaidy flavor. Good smooth creamy soft body. A fine flanders!"
"At 7% this is very drinkable, at least until you can't take the sour flavors anymore. Great example of the style, and one I'd recommend giving a try."
"Mouthfeel was smooth, tart yet balanced. drinkablity is limited only by the amount of liquid in the bottle, when its gone, you just want more."
""
"Kind of a murky rust color with a thin cream colored head that clings to the glass on its way down. Aromas of sour cherry and horse blanket with a little sweetness. The flavor is quite similar with an underlying sweetness that is balanced against the sour, acidic quality. Medium bodied with a fine, slightly sharp carbonation that quickly mellows before becoming prickly. An acidic and metallic finish that is somewhat refreshing. Well done."
"D - This is just out of this world drinkable for a 7% ale. The representation of the style is great I would drink this any chance I can get it is refreshing and has depth not something you can find often like the best of both worlds"
"On tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a beautiful slightly hazy burnt orange leaning toward a chestnut color. Very nice head that is cream colored with tight beading. The smell is slightly sweet up front followed by a gentle lactic quality. Funk at the end with horseblanket and ripe cheese aromas. The taste is very nicely balanced with sweet/tart flavors as well as some nice spice/pepper, and some restrained fruit- pear mostly. Some slight funk grows as the beer warms as well. The mouthfeel is very smooth and quite creamy. Great beer. Not quite as tart as some in the style, but this is more than made up for by a nice restrained herbal funkiness on the finish. Best beer of theirs that I've tried in awhile."
"D: A really good sour offering, though I don't have much to compare it too. The only other in this style I've had is NB's La Folie, and this beer was much less sour and more drinkable. Light and smooth, I could easily have had another glass or two. Great stuff."
"Overall: I think that I am drinking this beer past its prime, carbonation is almost nonexistant and there is almost no finish. A shame i was really looking forward to this."
"Sweet, sour, oaky, delicious. Highly recommended."
"An immensely characterful beer, certainly worth a try."
"I like it fine, but I don't think I'll be making a return trip."
"D - It is a refreshing beverage. Strong for a Flanders red. I like the flavor and I love the smell. DEfinitely worth seeking out. This brewery has impressed me. I will definitely look for more beers from them. Although I do love Flanders red ales."
"Rich amber colored pour with a small beige head. Smell is lightly sour with cherry, mildish funky feet like aroma, and hints of cheese. Mild tartness and a subtle cheese like flavor in the finish, I thought. Very dry overall and with light sweetness. Went very well with the bleu cheese. Nice beer, and I'm starting to get more interested in the style. Thanks for sharing this one Alan!"
"Impressive drinkability: I would never have guessed this is 7% from the taste. I could easily drink a bottle of this a week."
"One of the most complete Flanders Red Ales I have had the pleasure of trying. In my experience arfter a bottle of some red ales my mouth is left a sour puckering mess. Not with this guy. It has a full rich body( for a flanders) to go with the dry sour taste. I truely loved this beer."
"D - The Brett starts heavy but then mellows somewhat. As much as I like brett it overpowers the tart chrry at times."
"Notes - This is a solid Flanders red, and it's very reasonably priced. Recommended."
"Drinkability - just keep sipping away on that 750, man. No problems here. Good stuff - my only complaint is that the only way for me to get this is to have Liquid Solutions put it on a truck bound for me. This would be a hit with wine snobs, and very versatile with meals."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, semi-sweet, with a light amount of booziness in the finish."
"Drinkability: I found this beer to be nice and spicy. It left me with a good impression of flavor, sourness and overall drinkability. It hit a lot of bases to become a versatile beer for me. I would seek this out and purchase it."
"Cheers!"
"Zoetzuur Flemish Ale is yet another outstanding creation from one of my favorite Belgian brewers. It's a near perfect melding of the Flanders red and wild ale styles that fans of each should love for its sheer inventiveness. Not to mention its lip smacking deliciousness. Extract the cork and let the sweet-sour mouth party begin!"
"Comment: I enjoyed the experience but doubt I will purchase this brew again. I enjoy the Flemish Ales but this one strained my opinion."
" A perfect paring with pears, dark blue cheese, and madjool dates, not all that particular order . . . if only brouwers would cater to my own selfish appetizing needs on the next run."
"This Flemish Ale is a pleasant surprise."
"D: Amazingly easy to drink while still maintaining style-approriate characteristics. The best flemish ale I've had yet."
"This was super drinkable for me, as I love the style, and the funk was light enough here to keep this one from being to much if I had the fortunate opportunity to session them."
"Pours a reddish hue with a nice pillow of a head. Smells funky with brettanomyces and sour fruit notes. Man, I can tell I'm in for a treat. The taste doesn't disappoint. Mildly sour, with an incredibly complex overall flavor profile. I can pick out cherries and granny smith apples. And the brett. The rest remains a mystery. It finishes clean and dry, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. This is a well crafted brew that I could drink anytime or anywhere. I could session this, or have it as a dessert, or a nightcap, or even pair it with a whole host of foodstuffs. I just hope there are a few more of these on the shelf."
"Poured into a snifter a cherry wood light brown with a plenty of white head and decent lacing. Aroma is sharp. There is some funk foretold by the nose, hints of lemon, and plenty of tart cherry. The taste is funky but not unbalanced. Apple and kriek like cherry come through. Mild sourness and tartness meld nicely with the carbonation to play upon the tongue. Somewhat dusty. Straightforward and not terribly complicated but very well done none the less. Guzzelable."
"I've tried a 750 of this before, and wasn't too impressed. The tap version has redeemed it enough for me to give it another shot. The bottle had an off-putting plastic band-aid quality in the taste, that was really off and out of place."
"Light to medium body, with a good amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink, but still a bit complex. Nice."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a cloudy light brown/red color ale with a super huge foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of oak with some tart note is pretty interesting with some great notes of Brett/funky yeast. Taste is dominated by great oak and tart notes with some sourness which is offset by the funky and barnyard like taste of the yeast. Lots of complexities can be found in this beer. Body was full with some limited filtration and some great carbonation. An interesting experience and something I would definitely like to try again."
"Great summer brew for someone that just loves flanders reds."
"Drinkability suffers a bit, due to the dryness & sourness, but a good example of a genre I'm not in love with. But the beerworld is a better place for such oddities"
"The mouthfeel is briskly carbonated, crisp, and dry; super-drinkable (unless you hate sour beer.)"
"Drinkability: I found this very hard to drink, but it wasn't a drain pour. Compared to any other flanders red, it's a little harder to suck down and doesn't quite match up. However, I would be willing to give this another go sometime in the future."
"Notes: I liked this quite a bit. Far from the in your face versions. Maybe even a nice introductory offering. Kept my interest all the way through. Good."
"To make matters worse, the mouthfeel is strangely cloying, so I can't really even say this beer is an easy drinker."
"This beer is really aromatic with some pronounced wood. This beer is definitely a Red with a pronounced sourness to it. There is a really defined Brett character to this one like a lot of homebrews have. The flavor is exquisite with its sweet and sour, cherry and berry medley with a little dryness in the flavor to linger for some time in the finish. There is a little bit of alcohol noticeable late in the finish, but it is quite deceptive at 7%. As the beer warms a little, you get a good bit of citrus coming out. This is a nice beer, and one that I would definitely like to drink again."
"750 ml bottle."
"D - Not really my cup of tea, but Im sure would go well some certain dishes."
"Very easy to drink and refreshing. A welcome discovery."
"Body is below medium, with big bubbles and a slick, juicey mouthfeel. Not as complex as some other Flander sours, but tastey and highly drinkable."
"Drinkability- A nice effort here. Would buy again, just to see if that metallic taste was a one time thing. If so, this could be a very good Flanders..still good as is though."
"This is a fine beer - a good bridge for anyone willing to cross the lambic line into more beery Belgians, but not ready for the lose the sweetness."
"Dark copper, old currency color with a large white head aloft. Moderate Flemish Sour aroma, with mild apple aromatics and sugary fruit. Not really any oak or sour yeast chartacter, although it does smell slightly musty. Really mild overall, lacking character and depth and possessingly a mildly tart apple flavor. On the finish, however, is a very sugary, sweetened fruitiness, that begins after the swallow and is very sweet and cinnamon like. Its very sweet overall, presumably sweetened. This is a very poor example of a Flemish Sour in my opinion. Almost laughably bad and the sweetness lingers."
"I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. It is very easy to drink. I think I will have to go back and buy many more."
"This is a must-try beer if you enjoy lambics (traditional) or flemish sour ales, and worth trying in general for the amazing dance of flavor the brewer has crafted here."
"Alcohol is really inperceptible. This is an easy drinker yet so complex and flavorful that I can't drink it too fast and it continually intrigues me. Definitely get this and try it if you can."
"Highly Recommended!"
"if you like Rodenbach or Krieks or Lambics (say like mild Cantillon stuff) etc you should like this variation on the themes in all those brews as all things are present here to be savored. I would have my doubts as to how this one would age with the mix of ingredients and the fact that it is made from a tasting house specifically for tasting now... I would drink it now if you can find it (just my opinion)."
"Highly drinkable. Creaminess in the mouthfeel keeps it from being overpowering. Recommended."
"Drinkability  This was fun to drink, but a one on one with a bomber of Zoetzuur is asking a lot of the palate."
"P.S. I suggest taking care not to disturb the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle, as I have swirled in the last 2 oz. at the end. Much better without the sludge."
"Taste: Lots of caramel again in the taste, some red fruits as well, with an interesting balance of sweet and sour mnemonic of New Glarus Belgian red. The low carbonation brings out the sweetened malt that bursted with cherries. Very low alcohol. May be a little too cloying for some, I enjoyed it."
"(750 ml / 25.4 oz. tall straight brown champagne style bottle, corked, and caged)"
"Dirty red-brown. Long lasting off-white to light tan cover. Intense brettanomyces nose, explosive cherries, atomic woodiness. Very big and directly to the point aroma. Sweaty, horsey, leafy. This has all the school elements of a good funky flemish sour. On the palate, the brett is as dominating, but the integration is not as efficient. Initially, tart cherries, strawberries and the likes have claims over the earthiness and genuinely evolve into a drying stone-like dryness full of green grapes, but then it hits a wall and every flavor escapes reality. At the same time than the short-flavored nature kicks in, those prickly big bubbles do a last effort to taunt you and expands into a big foam that has nothing worth keeping in your mouth any longer. Solid beer just because its a flemish sour, but just above average compared to other contenders in terms of palate. Spectacular beefy aroma on the other hand."
"This beer is totally enjoyable, and it actually is much more intense on the Brett end than the classic Rodenbach Grand Cru, if it had the tartness, and more of the balsamic notes, it would perhaps rival it even, but alas it does not so it falls a little short. I am a sucker for funky, sour beers, and No doubt, I would love to have a case of this in my cellar, unfortunately I only picked 1 bottle of this up, and I don't think that I will be able to replenish it any time soon."
"A well-rounded, all-encompassing Flemish ale. While in a natural sort of spirit, it's a far cry from the lactic nature of even Rodenbach Grand Cru and an even further stretch to compare this to its sweetened cousins from other brewers. The more restrained acidity is a bit disappointing to me personally, but this is an intriguing beer that's well worth wading through -- it really grew on me through the end of the bottle. I've got a few more bottles, so we'll see what I think of it over time. But for now, chalk this up as a fun, somewhat unconventional success."
