"An aroma reminiscent of children's cough syrup and a flavor dominated by strawberries."
""
"A nice fruity beer with a hint of sour, but not enough to call it a sour.  Red fruits lead the taste profile.  I got raspberry and strawberry with slightly sour cherry on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"As others have said not very sour.  A nice drinking red with lots of cherry and some complexity.  A fairly sweet taste with slightly sour finish.  I liked it but did not love it."
""
"Very easy drinking sour. Good tasting but not exactly representative of the style, but good none the less."
""

""
"medium brown in color, not really any head.   mild sour aroma, a bit earthy and dark fruits.  taste is fairly malty, with just a slightly sour vinegary finish.  Not very sour, drinks easy and refreshing.   Thin bodied."

"Tried this as part of a Belgian beer sample shipment(great gift from the inlaws) and have had some great sours and like that style. The appearance of this beer is interesting with a faintly cloudy reddish brown color. The aroma is less intense than expected with some cherry and fig present. The taste has similar notes with tart cherry and cola, tea and golden raisin present and typical sour fruits aftertaste. Mouthfeel is average/thin. Overall a decent offering and I enjoyed it....not Rodenbach but every style has its sublime examples."

"Taste is fruity cola, tangy fruit and red grape skins. Similar to the aroma, the sour level is disappointing. Its not bad, it has some decent malty/fruit interplay, but really falls in line as just an average flanders."
""
"This one is refreshing and similar to fruit juice. I enjoyed it late on a warm, sunny day and could see this easily being a digestive. It is off style, but certainly would make a fine introduction for those uninitiated to sour beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More caramel in the taste but it comes as a sweeter note. Something in the way of soda-like in character. Easy to drink throughout but not something I could drink more than one of. The tartness is there but fails to surpass the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Refreshing beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Little aroma and little flavor, and the flavor available is mostly sweet. This beer is not worth a try."
""
"O-I could not get the flavor cherry cola out of my head when drinking this brew. It is sweet, somewhat simple, and the malted, dark cherry flavor pretty much dominates to the exclusion of everything else. All that being said, I have had worse."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- What can I say, this is a strange somewhat artificial seeming beer. It's drinkable enough but not very complex and the sweetness is way too high for my tastes."
""
""
"Second beer in the Sour Tower Takeover tasting. Too much attenuation and not enough tartness for the style leaves this one sweet and a bit juicy."
""
""
""
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium light. Okay, do not know what to think of this beer, it does not seem like a flanders beer that is acidic or strong in flavor. To me, is lacks a lot to make this beer excellent. It is just an average beer, nothing special."
"O: Clearly I'm not a huge fan, it isn't bad overall but I wouldn't buy it again. The after taste is where it really lost me, almost reminds me of a root beer."
""
""
"Overall, this is a good-tasting beer with some nice complexity, but there are other beers in this style with a bit more intensity and far more lasting flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall certainly worth a shot by anyone who enjoys sours. I'm more favorable toward sours leading to a higher than average score. Nice that it is year round as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As mentioned several times, this was a little too sweet for me to be loving it, but I'd have another one any day."
""
"Not a very good representation of the style."
""
"Overall this is a little too sweet for my tastes, and it's also a bit too soda like strangely. I would have it over many other beers, but I certainly don't feel the need to want to have this again."
"The aroma is reminiscent of sour cherries, or gourmet/fancy maraschino cherries, with a flavor to match. I think of sweet vermouth and black cherries, like 2/3rds of an expertly made Manhattan, with a sweetness matched by a mild tartness. I get some of that vermouth/bitters aroma, a layered, aged sense of different herbs and spices coming together and mellowing out, and the taste of cherries running throughout. Terribly enjoyable and readily accessible."
"Pours a clear brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, sugar, and some very slight sour aromas. Taste is of malt and sugar with no tartness whatsoever. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer and a horrible example of the style."
""
""
"Enjoyable sour. Won't light the world on fire, but easy dinker. The duchess light."
"Not bad, though I find it a little too sweet and in need of improved body. The low carbonation is also a weak point, though this may have been caused by poor handling (my fault). Otherwise, it has the classic fruity sourness of a flanders red - distinct but restrained. A decent representative of these unique Belgian beers. Worth trying."
""
""
""
"O: Picked this one up on a whim. Saw this bottle right next to Duchesse De Bourgogne at my local bottle shop and figured worth a try. About to open the Duchesse de Bourgogne and will post on that one soon."
""
""
""
""
"Easy going, perhaps unremarkable. I enjoyed drinking Bourgogne des Flandres Brown Ale, but it'd be hard to justify dropping the dollars to have it again."
""
""
"Medium bodied and medium effervescence. ABV is not at all noticeable. Aftertaste is less tart, more malt. Not as good, to me at least, as Duchess du Borgogne, but in the neighborhood."
"I'd drink it again, but for the price I can find much better examples of the style. just a bit too muted on every aspect."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red amber with a one finger medium pinkish white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and sour fruit, cherries. Mellow flavor of cherries, sour and sweet, finishes with a well blended flavor of dark fruit, malt and cherries somewhat tangy. Moderate bodied. Somewhat subdued in flavor, but pleasant and satisfying to drink. This is a one year old bottle with unknown storage details (may be a bottle from distributor storage)."
"I've got 2 bottles left, who wants'em?"
"O- This beer is bright with some nice fruity depth to it and a soft tartness but it becomes a bit too sweet as it warms and the tartness is a bit too mellow to combat that."
"M-medium body, maybe a bit syrupy and plenty of bubbles."
""
"This was a nice, unique taste treat, but I don't need to drink this again."
""
""
""
"Taste: berry-licious. sour-tastic. nice and medium, for the sour-heads among us. Is this the Duchesse Junior, the light sour? Sweetness, then some sour, …very tasty, but never over the top."
"O: It's an alright beer. Little light in everything from nose, to taste, to body. Nothing wrong with it but it won't blow you away."
"O-A nice flavorful easy to drink beer, not overly anything."
""
""
"Overall a bit too sweet for me, and I also wish it were more sour."
""
"O - A nice beer, something different, not to sweet, just try it once."
"Drinkability: Not as tart as some Red Ales I have had, but enjoyable. Not sure why this says retired, just had one last night."
"On tap at burger. in Santa Cruz. Pours a dark clear ruby black with a sudsy tan head. Aroma is faint with light notes of overripe red fruit and dark bread. Flavor is full of sugary cherries, like cherry yogurt, with a sweet malty finish. Lacks the tartness of a good flanders ale. Pretty much just alcoholic soda."
"O - A great flanders ale, on the sweet side but thirst quenching and highly drinkable."
"O - Not sour enough and too malty. I guess I see why it was retired."
"Overall the beer is decent, good but not great. Fairly easy to drink one of; I think it would be tough to get past the sweetness for a second or third pour."
"O: Drinkable, but overly sweet. Could only drink one, had better Flanders style before. Might be an affordable segue into sours for those who have never tried them."
"This is a very good looking beer nice dark brown color with red edges and a nice foamy light brownish head. The smell is pretty light, there are some of the flanders sour smell, a little kriek cherry smell, a little sweet. Mouth feel is light, highly carbonated. The taste is okay, its a little sweet, some fruits almost tart but everything is too mellow, then a weird after flavor, this is definitely missing the ultra sour / tart kick that I was expecting from this style. Overall, I was looking for a cheaper Flanders Red besides La Folie and Duchesse De Bourgogne, but sadly this is just too toned down for me to get again, I'll stick with the Duchesse."
"O: This was dreadful stuff. No thanks."
"Dark cherry cola look with little or no smell. What I do smell is malt vinegar. Head is fluffy, tan and plenty bubbly. Tastes like cooked dark cherries and sweet malt. Tart fruit from start to finish with a cola-like finish. A bit sweet, but a nice sipper after dinner. I like this beer."
"I'm hoping I just got a bad bottle, because if this is how the brewers release this, they should just pack it in."
"D-Very easy drinking but steers a little too close to cloying for the style."
"Overall a pretty good beer. Worth a try for sure and definitely A pick above many others."
" Aroma of light, bready malt, sweet fruit (cherry and fig), and a hint of vinegary sourness. Palate is fruit-forward with lots of cherry sweetness and a bready malt base. A mild sourness lingers on the finish. Body is light, creamy, and just a bit sticky. While not nearly as sour as some other Flemish reds, this is still a very tasty little number."
"Has a deep amber colored pour with a cream colored head. Just a little bit of lacing. The smell is a little bit of sweet and sour mixed. The flavor is a little sour at first but fades away quickly into a sweet more drinkable liquid. The mouthfeel is pretty light and doesn't have a ton of carbonation. Overall it's not bad bit it's nothing great like a true Flanders Red. I could drink this again if I came across it one day."
"O: There are better examples of this style of beer out there. This is just not a great one. I could see new people to beer liking this, but it just doesn't do much for me. Not offensive just a pretty average beer."
"(D)- Not a whole lot going on with this, but it sure goes down easy. My bottle didnt last long since its so mellow. A decent cheap flanders that fits the style easy enough, but like i said: Its very mellow on flavor."
"Offered to my lovely wife as an alternative to Kasteel Rouge, and I must say, it was no Kasteel Rouge. Reddish-brown pour with a light, receding head. Light fruity aroma. Taste was bitter and...mmm...sickeningly sour, I'm sorry to say. Sour in a thin way. Thin mouthfeel with a bit of a metallic aftertaste. Ok, but I probably would not get this beer again."
"Overall - I enjoyed each sip but dreaded the swallow. For that reason, I would not buy this again."
"A pretty good example of a Flanders Brown, one bottle is more than enough though."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer. Quite light for the style, which I don't really like, but it has a good flavor. It is even light when you put it beside a Vichtenaar. Take that for what you will. I would recommend that someone new to this style give this a shot before you go to Rodenbach."
"Feel is a nice medium build with a nice carb that's not too bitey. vinegar stays a bit and keeps this from gaining props. maybe a bit of age will do something. I drank it and it was not all that bad, give it a go."
"Not bad, but not nearly of the standard that Duchesse is. Which is the only beer this can be judged against. Enjoyable, but not the ""Real McCoy."""
"Bourgogne des Flandres, a Flanders Oud Bruin blended with Lambic and aged for 6 months in oak barrels. It isn't bad, exactly, but it is fairly one-dimensional for the style. It's better once it warms up, but still pretty boring. Very sweet, with a vaguely cherry cola-like flavor and just a semblance of sourness. Reminds me of a really shitty attempt at copying Duchesse De Bourgogne (one of my favorites). It doesn't suck, but I can think of no reason to buy this one when there are significantly better examples of the style."
"O: A very tame bruin. I personally would like it more if was substantially tarter and dryer. The sweetness wasn't overpowering, but definitely accentuated in this beer. Go elsewhere (I like Bellegems) for a more balanced bruin."
"Drinkability:This one is a fairly tame Oud Brune as these things go. It's more of a session version of a flanders, or maybe even a fruit beer."
"D - Not my favourite flanders red, as it's a bit watery."
"The sweetness does appear to get sweeter as the beer warmed, which isn't good, but I enjoyed the beer from start to finish. Not your regular Flanders Red, but one of the best in my eyes."
"It's a nice darkish color, but not all that carbonated (small and quickly disappearing head), and because of the timid taste, seemed less refreshing than other beers of the same style I've had."
"Muled back from Belgium by Kevin (props for that!) It is almost black in color with a dense, rocky light tan head. It smells like old leather and sort of like bandaids. Taste is sweet up front, with a nice maltiness and a slight sharpenng at the end. Tastes of carob powder with a buttery note and traces of strawberry. Very mellow, it seems like I'm going to like it more than I do, somehow. I like it, just not as much as I think I will when I hit the first sip. Mouthfeel is creamy, soft, and sharply carbonated at the same time. Drinkability isn't bad but the aftertaste is a touch metallic and doesn't make me yearn for the next sip. It has a lot of interesting things that it almost pulls off, it just seems the beer doesn't quite walk the talk. All in all a decent brew, one I'd have again. Its one I'd like to try aged or on tap (if such exists) to see how variances would affect it. To sum it up? Its got potential."
"D- If you're not put-off by the mildness of the beer too much, then it's quite drinkable."
"Deep ruby red with reddish brown highlights, a thin tan head with decent retention, this is OK. The nose is disappointing with some sugar, some cola, a little vanilla and no real sourness. A little musty, this is disappointing. The palate opens with a mild tartness, a mild rotting fruit-like character, some sugar and mild vanilla. Drying on the finish with a mild tannic character, this isn't very good. Light in body with a moderate level of carbonation, I really didn't enjoy (or finish) my pour"
"Small bottle offered up at Avec Les Bon Veoux in Brussels. Brown-red body with ruby hues and a thin tan head that dissipates rapidly this whispy lace. Aroma of candied cherries and oak with a touch of funk and some coriander like spice. Taste is cherries and prunes with some candied sugar and a little woodiness. Sour but not insanely so. Light bodied and quite drinkable."
"A reasonably tasty beer but it doesn't quite do it for me. The flavours are muddled on the palate and lack structure. I can't see me drinking much of this."
"d) Outstanding. A dark Belgian you can drink all night, and with bits of everything."
"Vanilla notes, soft creamy sweet. Slight grape-like fruit, almost cocoanut. Soft herbalness. Lasting sourness. Tastes pretty good. Feels pretty good. Good drinkability."
"So perhaps, it is what it is."
"D: Not bad for a 14 year old beer."
"M&D: the carbonation is not as smooth and natural as my other three bottles, but still light enough to render an approachable palate to go with the very light flavour profile. All in all, there's very little in the glass that I'd say has done this style any justice; for, it's quite mediocre overall and just fails to keep my interest."
"Pours a clear, but quite dark brown with ruby tones. Very small almost tan head. Flavor is nice. Smooth, yet candy sweet a bit. There is that definite Flanders ale taste. Slight wood with an almost cherry sweetness. It's not exactly the most complex or mature profile, but it works nicely and I dig it. Feel is a noticeable carbonation, but not abrasively full. Liquid is thick enough. This one is easy to drink and decent."
"I don't know if this is categorized wrong, or if the bottle led me to believe something different but this beer barely resembles a Flanders red. With that being said it is enjoyable to drink but the low score shows off the difference from the style. The ingredient list reads ""flavourings"" which I'm assuming is a cherry syrup of some sort. I don't usually go for that kind of thing but this is a decent brew that would appeal to a lot of different folks. Thanks for the chance Derek!"
"Deep mahogany in colour, crystal clear when held up to the light. The head poured thick & white then retreated to a light surface covering, still maintaining the lace on the glass. Sweet, syrupy malt is the dominant aroma with background hints of sour aceto, cherries and plums. Overwhelming sweetness on the palate, obliterating the fruit flavours that lurk behind. Some harsh sourness comes in the finish in a lame attempt to balance the beer out. The mouthfeel is sweet and sickly, almost undrinkable in any quantity. This beer has neither the sourness, complexity or thirst quenching drinkability of Rodenbach, the benchmark for the style. A disappointing, overly sweet attempt."
"it's a nice beer."
"It didn't have the tart, acidic fruity sourness nor the rustic, oak overtones that makes Flanders' Ales so charming and complex. It did have an odd seafood/vegetable taste with wet cardboard finish. It actually managed to leave me a little less excited for Brugge and Ghent."
"Body is medium and lacks the subtle effervescence that i am used to. Flander Reds should be spritzy and light feeling, this is a little heartier. Still tastey in it's own way but wouldn't seek out again."
"Review added 11-11-2007, translated from french 1-27-2008."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, but a bit bland."
"No bitterness."
"Reddish orange in color with little head, but beautiful lacing. Smells of brown sugar, candy sugars, chocolate. Smells rich and delicious; can't wait to get it in my mouth, but the taste really takes a step backwards. It has very mellow and pleasant mouthfeel, but the taste is too understated after such a thrilling nose. Some butter to it. Very drinkable but I wish it were more flavorful."
"Attractive and promising Dark mollasses colour. mollasses aroma with a sweetness other than mollasses, candy? Then sourness and tongue numbing that lasts 6 hours later. An experience that is not necessarily satisfying. Not complex, but drinkable brew."
"A bit of an odd one, too sweet to be a true flanders and too sweet for me anyways. Not bad, just not world changing"
"Tasted this bottle in 'T Speelmanshuys pub, Bruges in May 2005. I had tasted this beer before in Brussels some years previously (on tap in A l'Imaige de Nostre Dame) and had been very impressed. This bottle was left for me to pour, but even ""giving it some air"" found it hard to get a decent head. Smelled good, nice mouthwatering tang with some hops. Tasted a little sharp, mixture of sweetness and bitter tang, with the bitterness winning the battle. I was a bit dissappointed with the experience, my memory of the draft version is what made me order this beer. The draft Bourgogne is much better, being a nice middle-of-the-day beer."
"A surprisingly crisp beer. Pours a deep red color with absolutely no head. Smell is very hard to pick out, but smells of faint plums and raisins. Smell is surprisingly crisp and light for a beer this dark. The main taste is apricots and other fruits, but water is quick to take away any lingering taste on the tongue. The effervescing also prohibits anything form staying around your mouth, but overall it is a solid beer."
"Hard to get any foam on this beer. Very darkbrown colored and clear. Best before 23-02-06 so well in time to enjoy... Smell is mostly sweetmalty, some oak and spicy. Taste is sweet, malty( caramel and dark), sweet and some oak before getting into a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good except for the sweetness that seems to mak a comback after bitterness has left. Drinkabitly is also negativly influenced by the sweetness that's just to much."
"250 ml bottle, bought at Borough Market, London. Beautiful dark ruby colour, very good thick head. Moderate barnyard aroma on a background of red wine vinegar, honey and raisins. Flavour is not nearly as sour as the other two Flemish Sour Ales Ive had - more sweet than sour, actually. Too sweet for me - elements of syrup, caramel, honey, balsamico vinegar, blackcurrants and blackberries. A craft beer, no doubt - but definitely not a favourite of mine this one."
"The beer after its emancipation from the 330ml brown bottle sets in the glass a deep incarnadine color with the head pythonic in size and the texture spumous, the color a beauteous light tan as it dwindles to nothingness the lace forms a tight skirt upon the glass. Nose is tart, almost astringent with a backing of malt sweetness, hints of black cherries or blackberries, complex maybe its just this old worn out schnozzle of mine. Start is quite sweet and light in malt; the top is light with the acidity mild and the hops benign in their spiciness. Aftertaste is dry and sweet, a different beer I must say, drinkable nonetheless."
"Bottle: Poured a dark red beer with a huge head with pretty good retention. Oak really hits you when you small this beer. Taste is very refreshing with a hint of sweet cheery which is attributable to the oak. Finish is a bit dry and watery which stop this beer from being as good as the Rodenbach. Still a nice example of the style."
"Had twice at the Avec Les Bon Veoux in Brussels. This is a dark red brew with a small whispy head of off-white. Aromas are of cherries, oak, various spices, yeast, candy sugar, and more. The taste is sour, oaky, and very cherry-ish with some nice spicing as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the drinkability is nice."
"I was stunned to find this on tap at a German restaurant in Moscow. Of course, I had to try it. It came in a logo glass shaped like a martini glass. The beer was a deep clear ruby red under a 1.5 finger tan head with contour and decent lacing, but not much retention. The nose is strong, sweet and fruity. The mouth is light and only mildly carbonated. The opening is strawberry sweet, but quite mild. There is a slight hoppy finish, leaving a good mix of sweet and bitter in the aftertaste. Not at all bad, but I was a bit disappointed."
"Body was thin an the beer was a bit under carbonated. Nice complexity to this brew. Ill probably pick a few more of the dusty bottles up next time I stop by."
"Rather sweet and thin bodied, not one of the better examples of the style, but still OK, slightly tart cherry quality, but nothing exceptional. Light and slightly enjoyable, very downable."
