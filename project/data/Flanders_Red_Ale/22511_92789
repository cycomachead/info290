4.52,5.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Acidic aroma of tart cherry preserves and red wine with a touch of caramel in the background.  The flavor is milder, with a rounder acidity than the aroma would imply with the same dark sugar and fruit notes as in the nose.  Like that acidity, the sweetness is a bit less pronounced than in some examples of the style and it balances nicely.  Complex, balanced, and subtle this is perhaps the first HF beer that I have had that fully lives up to their substantial reputation, and it is one of the best beers I have had in quite a while.","nickfl","Jan 29, 2015"

There is a perfect balance between the acid and funk that makes this beer dangerously drinkable. I've found with some beers from this style, a 4 ounce pour is more than enough.
