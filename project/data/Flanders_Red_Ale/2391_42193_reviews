"Overall: Cascade are artists with barrels. The shear complexity of a beer like this really holds my attention all the way through as I try to discern everything that I am experiencing. All of the Kriek's qualities coalesce into a truly fine beer. The bottle comes with a little sticker shock, but I'll drink this on draught any day of the week!"

"long awaited for me, the cascade kriek, what a true delight! i love the use of multiple cherry types, i think it makes a more layered and interesting beer. i also like its alcoholic strength. its uncommonly strong, which i think forces me to slow it down just a bit and appreciate every sip. its dark red, foggy ruby in color, with an off white head with excellent staying power. it smells only a touch medicinal before the sweeter nature of the cherries crashes into the lactic acidity and sourness. its intense as they get both in aroma and flavor, and the cherries never lose their authenticity in the taste. that medicinal thing is now obviously a product of the higher abv, and i like what it does here, subtle but not absent. rich beer, flush body and warming in the belly. the fruit stays after the sourness subsides on the finish, which is both unique and welcomed, my tongue is in heaven. i like the density of the fruit, the body of the beer that is never for a second syrupy or thick like these can get on the cheap end. definitely brilliantly crafted. worth the wait and the hype, i love it. takes the style somewhere new, and thats always a pleasure to ride along with."

"O-Avoided the cherry flavor being too sweet which was a huge plus for me."
""
"Mouthfeel is extremely dry. Overall, this is quite good."
""
"Overall: Another outstanding Cascade Brewing beer, though not as good as the Apricot or Blueberry in my opinion. High price though at over $30."

"A very decent kriek this year. Well-balanced, with good sourness, medium body, and interesting fruit and ""rustic"" notes."
""
"Corked and caged bottle of 2013 Project from Gator Beverage. Poured deep dark red into my tulip with a tall, fizzy pink head that quickly recedes. The head ends up lingering as a very small creamy bubble film on top that is really interesting. Lots of sour cherries on the aroma with some vinegar there, and dry oakiness. Flavor is super sour cherries, with a light vinegar note that is balanced out by the super dry oak flavors. Really nice Kriek that highlights the cherries without being medicinal. Miles better than the Blueberry mess I had last night. Good beer!"

"O - Pretty much the only Cascade sour I was tempted to by a bottle of when I visited their brewpub. Came together really nicely. I find this to be slightly underrated."

"Vintage unknown, but most likely 2010. Pours a reddish-brown hue with a loose, half-inch head and a hazy clarity. Nose reveals cherries and a suggestion of cough syrup. Taste consistent with nose. This beer is tart, but not overly so. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with some astringency and a residual burn at the back of the throat. Overall, a solid kriek with some brune-like qualities."
""
"Fantastic brew. Another winner from cascade. Great kreik, really enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O: Incredible. Highly recommended. Tart-sweet cherries. Phenomenal kriek. Use this to convert those who ""don't like sours."""

"I was baffled on how much I enjoyed this - in a sense, really, I enjoyed this in the same manner that I'm madly in love with Rioja wines, where the light-skinned Tempranillo grapes absorb a good deal of the barrel character and transform the wine into something that feels larger than it really is. This is the same situation here, only it's carbonated, it's far lower in alcohol, and it's beer. Truly an excellent achievement in the realm of cherry infused beers - I cannot recommend it enough."

"A more sour and drier Flanders Red with a lot of pie cherry tartness and a seriously acidic spine. Has that lambic cheesiness with the malt strength and acetic quality of a Flanders ale. Oaky, but not astringent. Unripe raspberry, pomegranate seed, and almost a spicy basil greenness. Lots of tart fruit and gritty funk. Puckering mouthfeel with a spicy sour finish/burn. Swishy and a carbonated appropriately. Awesome experience, overall."

"Overall: A solid brew for sure. Digging the sour style, very pleasing on the palate and looking forward to trying some more of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an incredible beer, another solid offering from Cascade. Not for the faint of heart"
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer, and certainly the best Flanders Red I've ever had. It's too bad these are so darn expensive, but I do like the fact that they are relatively easy to get, since Cascade is able to sell beer direct-to-consumer somehow."
""
""
""
""
""
"There's a good amount of carbonation. The beer drinks very well with complexity of fruit, funk, and tartness. This stands well against to Cantillon Kriek."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Super sour lacto bomb puckers my face, some cherry and nice barrel funk."
""
""
""
"Taste brings on the sourness and cherries big time, sour cherries much more than 'fresh'. More teeth enamel-removing sour than anything else though, quite impressive. General lemon, vinegar, bread, funk and some oak. Has a bigger feel that shows the ABV a little bit, kinda reminds me of Petrus Aged Pale in its ABV-ness. But pulled off nicely, high carbonation and bracing sourness makes this a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer - there is a pleasant amount of sourness that is not overpowering but it is still noticeable. The cherries are tart but strong enough to keep this one easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Amazing sour. I shared this with my cousins and unfortunately they didn't like it or couldn't drink it all, but it was a win - more for me! Mmm."

"Overall a good flemish red, especially from an american brewery, but nothing amazing. not worth the price when you have imported reds like rodenbach for half the price and more readily available, but this one is good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O - great beer. Bold flavors but each of them layer on top of each other so evenly they are incredibly balanced. Very fresh and natural tasting as well."

"O: Very nice beer. You know it's a Cascade sour, and you know it was brewed with cherries. Can you really ask for anything more? I'd love to get me hands on a few more bottles and drink this a few times a year."
""
""
""
"A decent fruit sour, but among the weaker ones I've had from Cascade. The fruit presence is light, and the sour is muddy and has some slightly off elements. Worth drinking again, but probably not at ~$20 per bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really a phenomenally blended beer that lived up to the hype. I didn't give it as high a rating because I wanted it to be more sour, but the cherries stepped up in a big way. You won't go wrong here. 4"

"This is an outstanding beer with a great combination of sour bite and fruit flavors. I liked it more and more with each sip. But with a significantly higher price than Rodenbach Grand Cru, I wouldn't make it a regular thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Great flanders red. Good sourness and overall balance."
""
"O: a very good kriek/flanders red. qualities remind me of rodenbach with the oakyness and the sourness is excellent. It's quite good any way you slice it and it drinks pretty easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good sour. The cherries overpower some of the subtleties but it does deliver as promised."
"Overall a solid Flanders red, right up there with any of the others that I've tried. Only problem? At almost twice the price of something like Rodenbach Grand Cru, it isn't twice as good."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice sour here. Doesn't stand up to the big classic Flemish reds, but it's definitely a nice cherry-packed twist."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: honestly I was kinda disappointed I don't know if I just expected too much but this is a fairly mild juicy kriek, maybe with some years on it could develop more but overall impression this is good but not great it's worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
"O - this is a really good Kriek. I liked it because it wasn't sweet like so many of the Belgian Krieks are. The cherry flavor and sourness are perfect for me. It isn't a funky sour. I'd like to see a funkier version of this with a heavier lacto taste and some barnyard. Not to replace this beer, but to compliment it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - With the label full of cherries, you know what you're getting into. Very well done & a challenge to Supplication."
""
"A barrel aged sour cherry beer isn't cheap to produce and it shows it on the price. Is it worth it? I'd say it is. If sours are your type of thing, then you should enjoy this Cascade. Would I buy another bottle? I already did. I want to see what age will do to this beer."

"M: Light to medium bodied."
"Overall: Another excellent beer from Cascade. As far as American sours go, they're the only ones I've had that can give Russian River a run for their money."
"A very nice beer from Cascade, one of the best cherry sours I've had."
""
"Overall, quite good. The oak is at just the right level- clearly present but not too strong."
"Overall - Definitely one for the sourheads out there. Not a complex flavor, but it's clean and has a nice cherry flavor."
""
""
"O: A nice sour beer, Cascade does a nice job with their sour offerings, just always tough to pick up due to the pricetag. Glad I was able to get this one on tap."
""
""
"O: This is one delicious kriek."
""
""
""
"O- Quite a well developed sour. Might be the best one I had from Cascade."

"O: A great Flanders Red. If I saw this on the shelf again, I would definitely pick it up."
""
"Medium sourness. Loads of red wine. Cherries, cherries, cherries. Awesome!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the surprise is the salt component on this, which is large, but tolerable. It's a nice contrast, and unlike any other Kriek or fruit sour ales I've had before. Unique beer. Fun. Would have again."
""
""
"Murky chestnut beneath a small, persistent creamy covering. Drippy strings of lace are left on the walls of the glass. Sour cherries, vinegar, lactic acidity, cinnamon and nutmeg spiciness. Flavor is tart and very refreshing...woody, juicy cherries, light tannins, and a touch of vanilla. Medium-light bodied and dry with a long, drawn out fruity finish. Mmmm...excellent."
"O: a very nice kriek, nice cherry flavors and sourness... Enjoyed it very much."
"Feel is bursting with tartness all around the mouth, swish this around your mouth and feel the full effect, totally worth it. Missing some of the sweetness and vinegar from standard Belgian flanders, but that does not bother me, this is a nice change of pace for the style for me. Body is medium and has some life with bubbles. I drank the whole bottle, it was nice. I don't see this one as a long term aging beer, perhaps a year or so, but don't stretch it. At the level of sourness this has now, what's the point."
""
"Overall: this is a yummy beer. Nice cherry character, and the tartness adds to a wonderful drinkability. I look forward to trying this in subsequent years!"
""
"I enjoyed it cold, but it did get a bit better as it warmed."
""
"D - A bit singular in flavor but hits it on the head. Would revisit."
"O: Definitely a good kriek. The pie cherries are a little too sweet for me, but there's plenty of acidity to balance."
"Pours a brilliantly clear deep garnet/ruby color with a nice off white head that slowly recedes to a cap. I can smell cherries as soon as I wrangle the cork off the top pf the bottle. Upon closer inspection my nostrils are filled with fruity tart sweet and sour cherries, raspberries, and lemons. There's a hint of funk and a bit of residual brown sugar but this one is all about the tart. Tart cherries and lemons rule the palette with every sip. The flavor is quite tart with bits of sugar and funk barely getting through to provide faint hints of balance. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel. I enjoyed this one, but found it incredibly tart. I wonder how this beer is fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a truly amazing beer. Everything it should be. If someone let you taste this blind, you would think it was straight from Belgium. An absolute treat that I cannot believe comes ""locally"" from Oregon. These guys know how to make a sour. It says Kriek on the bottle but it's only because it's brewed with cherries...otherwise, this is all Flanders Red. Funky, sour, earthy, sweet, tart, robust. The thing about sours is that they are so complex but the description I come up with is simple. I'll attribute this to the centuries of brewing tradition and the simple enjoyment that comes with a great sour. There's no thinking...just drinking."
""
"Muddy blood red (poured with the yeast), with several fingers of browned white head. Strong lacing, moderate retention. Nose has some lactic sourness, oak barrel, ripe cherries, cherry pits. Taste has more sour cherries off the bat, more lactic sourness slight oak and more straight cherry flavour into the finish. gentle malt sweetness, but sour cherry and lactic notes shine. Slight cherry pie flavours as this warms. Medium full feel for a sour, and a bit of bite to the carbonation. An excellent sour - great fruit flavours and just plain tasty."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a very tart, puckering mouthfeel and a strong earthy, lactic funk presence that overpowers the sweet fruit flavor. Very funky with lots of lactic sourness. Strong oak barrel character with a ton of funky bugs, lactic cheesiness and acetic acid. Slightly harsh and acidic with a strong acetic vingear and solvent character lingering in the finish. Some tart cherry sweetness but the fruit has faded considerably at thus point and takes a back seat to the sour funk. I usually love Cascade sours but this was one dimensional and too heavy on the acetic solvent flavor. Pretty harsh and tough to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Very nice beer. Super sour, holy cow!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- wonderfully drinkable with massive complex flavor."
"Active body, yet still viscous enough to carry all the flavors. An excellent American-style kriek that's sure to convert your non-beer friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is way above most krieks that I have drank. I think that this beer does not get the accolades that it deserves, its really a enjoyable sour! This was my second favorite out of the cascade sour tasting of the four we drank(Sang Nior, Sang Royal, The Vine & Kriek)! This is the best flanders red I have drank to date!"
"I don't want to say one dimensional. Ecause that would be doing it a disservice but Kriek says ""here I am, drink me!"" just puts it right I the forefront. Thanks for the share 4DAloveofSTOUT."
""
"O- good sour, but actually thought this would have a little more cherry flavor then it did. Would purchase and drink again though."
""
"I would like the cherry flavor to come out some more. Sours are exactly my favorite style so I need to get more of the fruity flavor. Its well made and I am sure it is good for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not a bad beer. Would have again."
"It might be a good beer for the stle, but in general, it's almost not drinkable."
"I can say wholeheartedly and without reservation that, yes indeedy, this is a Flanders Red Ale. Gets better as it warms up with the nose and tart flavor profile gradually stepping up a notch. The lacto is present and noticeable, but thankfully it does not hijack the whole ride and merely accents on the back side. This is quite nice, quite nice. A really well done production that pulls off a difficult style. Long live the American brewer. I look forward to trying more of the wild ales, sours, and the like from Cascade."
""
"One bottle is a task for the mouth to handle. Really makes your palate work overtime. Great sour that any sour fan should try at least once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great sour that starts off a little more reserved than the coveted Sang Noir. Very light cherry flavor with a relaxed sour tartness. I've been finding my sour tongue, and this is a good one if you're new to the type. A little spendy, but worth it every-so-often. Would go well with dessert."
""
""
"this beer is worth seeking out if you're into sours, it's a real treat and worth spending the 12-$20 (or whatever it costs in your area) even if you are to have it only once."
"Pours a nice mahogany cherry ale with a mirrored surface. Smells of oak, cherry, and hints of ink. Really flanders like in the nose. Flavor is fucking sour, with cherry and more sour. It's kinda difficult to really taste anything through the fleeting barrage of acidity. Medium bodied with low carb and a mouth watering finish. This beer is sour, i enjoy it, but it's on the far reach of sour for me."
""
""
""
""
"In the end, I'm very satisfied with this beer. I still would not buy it again at $20/bottle, but I'm very much enjoying this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour cherries, vinegar aromas, and a nice level of funk. Taste is very much the same with an acidic quality in the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is really tasty and sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a good beer, but not quite as good as their other sour offerings. It's crazy how different the '09 and '10 can be; I've tried them side by side at multiple BA festivals. Definitely worth checking out and something I'd certainly have again."
""
"Beer is thin and the tartness of the cherries in accented by a strong acetic presence. It is difficult to drink due to the sourness of the beer. It is just too much for me and not a likely repeat, well I'd have it on draft at the barrel house."
""
"O: a pretty good representation, not very well rounded in my opinion though"
""
""
""
"A says should be called salivation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Whoa this is an expensive beer, and frankly one that is overpriced. However, I understand the amount of work that went in to preparing it and believe it was quite well executed. It was worth a try and definitely a hard beer to find on shelves in CNY."
"O- Fantastic example for the style. As far as the USA goes, Cascade makes outstanding sours and this is no exception. A must try if you can get your hands on a bottle."
""
""
"O - This was a want all year and I was ecstatic to find a lone bottle while on vacation in a state largely weak on beer selection."
""
""
""
"I bought this in Boston during my Belgian beer festival/the national trip! 2009 bottle. Poured a bright red cherry wood color with lots of carbonation. It sounds fizzy too. Beige head is small and short lived. Aroma is of fresh and sour cherries. On first sip I experience dryness and tartiness. It hits ya with fresh cherries that you almost think will be sweet then it cranks up the tart pucker and blows you away and dries ya out! There's some funk and there's wood. The feel is light-moderate with some nice scrubbing carbonation. This is tasty!"
""
""
"Definitely a nice kriek. Can't comment as to whether it has earned the hype since I don't drink enough kriek to judge."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great sour that did not disappoint. Will be taking the time to seek this out again."
""
""
"Overall this a great example of the style. Lots of big complex flavor here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- this is a good beer, but nothing special. It's been tough to find good sour beers on the shelves recently, and this one is easy to find. So if I'm in the mood, I might pick one up. But I'd rather seek out a better example of the style to my mind. Still, it's nice, and I will gladly polish it off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a unique kriek worthy of seeking out. Sweeter and less sour than lambic based counterparts. Well balanced and quite quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is a light ruby hue and moderately hazy. Small off white head with copious lacing. The aroma is musty and funky, with notes of oak, sour cherries, and wild yeast. Wow, intensely sour. Huge presence of sour cherries soaking in oak barrels. Palate attacking, cheek assaulting sourness. Oh yeah. Loving it. It seems aged has served this brew quite well. Definitely recommend this one. Huzzah!"

"Overall: I would have to say that to date this might be my favorite flanders red because of the fact that it was well balanced and not overly tart or sour. Highly recommended"
"O - I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I am really a fan of what Cascade is doing in their barrel room. This was a great example of a solid American made sour. Really look forward to trying more from them."
"O: Very well done!"
"O - A really solid Flanders that was exactly what I was expecting. The tart cherries and acidity are perfect and make this beer easy to drink and enjoy. Need to stock up on this one."
"O: I wish I would've asked for more. Solid sour."
"A great beer. Solid cherry flavour and the tartness doesn’t kill it."
"Great beer, gkad to try it"
"I’ve had this beer several times now and it never fails to impress me. It’s definitely aggressive with the sourness at times but never bracingly so and the fresh cherry flavors and sharp smoothness of the body really help keep this much more approachable than you would think. It’s always a pleasure, with a glass of this and I knew that getting it here fresh on draft was a must."
"Another delicious offering from Cascade. I can't wait until I get to try this again."
"Its red violet color are nice to look at, but it doesn't form much of a head or lace around the glass. The nose says cherry powder and some tartness. What makes this beer great in its taste is the balance of its characteristics; it's got cherry but not too much. It's got pucker but not too much. It's got some vinegar, but not too much. It's got tart, but not too much. Round it up and you've got one more outstanding beer to come from the doors of Cascade Brewing."
"D/O - Drinkability is pretty high. Although this is bold beer in terms of the amount of cherries and sour, it goes down quite easily and doesn't find itself battling against strong vinegar or onion notes like other Red Flanders."
"overall: enjoyed this a lot"
"As usual, but not necessarily always, an excellent beer from these guys. Missing the Barrel House greatly.."
"O - Not a bad stab at the flanders style by an American brewery. I was shocked to find this on the shelves as I didn't know they had some distribution in Massachusetts. I'm intrigued to try the other Cascade wilds now."
"Overall it seems like a reasonable example of the style. It's not my favorite style, but it's something interesting and different, with flavors you don't get in many other kinds of beer."
"O - As usual, a great sour from Cascade. Love their stuff."
"O: continuing my liking of sour ales I like this one alot. The last few sips seem more like a gueuze to me."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a fizzy level of carbonation. Very tangy and pleasantly sour. It seemingly strips the moisture from your tongue which urges you to drink more. There is hardly any alcohol inclusion and this certainly ranks up there with one of the more sour things I have had recently."
" This red ale has a nice balance of sour w/ gentle cherry tart taste that mixes with some slight bitter elements and vanilla character from the wood. I like the slight acicity the yeast provides with a subtle toasted flavor in the finish. Overall this is a good quality kriek with very good drinkability. I can't fault it for being too gentle in the sour department really since it fits the style well and has tasty fruit flavors."
"O - Sessionable sour, do those exist?"
"One of the most sour beers out there, not overly complex or drinkable but the taste is killer and the levels of sour are delightful. I'd buy this in large quantities if possible."
"The appearance is dark pink with one finger of off-white head. Its` smell has cherry, wood, pear, a bit of funk. A sip of this flanders red and I feel this is more sour than some others of the style. That aspect is fine by me and more of those cherries are still present. Lactic tannins hit the palate through the taste and it ends with some dryness. An enjoyable beer and one that is great to quaff on a hot summer day."
"O: a great beer that i could drink all the time."
"D - I had high hopes for this bottle and it came through for me nicely. There is an immense character of cherry and acid throughout with enough rich malt to balance and even push back against the tartness at times. In the end, the beer favors the acid over the sugary notes, as it should, and this makes for a refreshing beer despite its relatively high ABV. Very nice, reminds me of a blend of Rodenbach Red and Duchesse."
"Overall not bad, my least favorite Cascade but still decent beer, nice tart cherry flavors, not a whole lot going on though."
"bottle from 2009 and I haven't a clue regarding age, not sure how this ages but I'd like to find out"
"O-A good bottle, but I can already feel the heartburn creeping in. Should be shared with a few people."
"Cascade Kriek is rather intense. If you’re not a fan of Flanders Reds or sour beers in general, this one might be a little much for you. I’m enjoying it, but I do think the sour aspect is just a little too intense. I’d prefer a little less. On the other hand, I’m not much of a cherry fan, but am definitely enjoying that aspect of it. The cherry flavor is simply delicious. Overall, it’s good stuff. Well worth checking out. Thanks a ton, Chris!"
"Overall-- this is good. Not great, but certainly not bad. I enjoy the sourness."
"2008 Vintage. 8.1% ABV. Pours a dark red with hints of dark brown. Nice and hazy with a medium sized, cream colored head that goes down slowly. Scent is profound oak with hints of vanilla. Tart cherries mix well with the oaky aroma and vinegar. Taste is initially lactic vinegar with AMAZING vanilla oak flavors. The flavors are SO complimentary of each other and blend so well it's ridiculous. Tart cherries linger on the palate as the oak and vanilla slowly fade. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and surprisingly creamy. Very delightful. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. The alcohol is undetectable and I feel 3 years has done great things for this beer."
"O - Very good beer, was pleasantly impressed with this one and enjoyed the taste very much. We tore through this bottle quite quickly."
"O: A nicely balanced not over-powering sour; fruit is dry and subtle--really nice beer"
"O: I think this was an interesting take on the Flanders Red in an over the top American way."
"D - A potent Flanders Red Ale with a little bit of an exceedingly sour kick to it... A sipper for sure... Challenges the palette... A very fine brew none the less... Cascade makes some of the best fruit based sours around..."
"O - Delicious offering. All the sour ales from these guys/gals are awesome takes on the styles. Very refreshing and delicious but definitely not for sour rooks."
"A cool alternative to higher priced sour krieks from across the pond. This one is almost as good as Cantillon or Russian River."
"D-Very easy drinking and rides the fine line between sweet and sour that makes it very palatable."
"This is such a nice beer, I just wish the price wasn't so high. However, it is nice that this beer is readily available here in Philly"
"(D)- A fantastic flanders ale. Has stood the test of time and still comes out on tap as one of the best I have had in the style. A joy to drink and enjoy. This bottle did not last long tonite."
"The pour was wonderful, deep and dark red in color with a light tan head that came up to a height of around two inches before settling back down and leaving tons of lace all over the sides and bottom of the glass while never really falling much below the one inch level. The aroma was lightly tart, sour cherries, hints of earthy and spicy notes and even a touch of what seemed like brown sugar or something along those lines. Really very well done and quite complex. The flavor was a little less tart then what I would have liked but I have to admit was still done very well. Rich and full, it was never flat or boring and I have to admit I found myself returning back to it time and again for another go round."
"SkÅL!"
"This is a great Flanders sour. Lots of flavor, that is spot on. Something I highly recommend."
"Overall – I have a 2009 that I saved and was told I should try this fresh so here I am. A fantastic Flanders and am glad I choose to open this up tonight and have another to sit on. Very enjoyable."
"O- this beer is an experience. The pop I heard when I pulled out the cork was one of the loudest I've ever heard. The weird smoky discharge from the bottle was a dark white, and seemed really mystical. The carbonation on the pour was out of this world. Taste-wise, the beer is about par for the course for a sour...nothing extravagant, but damn good and worth another buy."
"O: Fantastic sour cherry flavor. I could drink this everyday. One of the best American Flanders I've tried."
"Overall: Good sour that pleasantly surprised me."
"Overall it was pretty great in my book. A little high on the price tag, but good enough that I am going to try to get more of their beers!"
"Mouth watering pucker finish. Sour but not too much. To me, this beer is strikingly similar to 3F our kriek. Delicious and an excellent offering!"
"O: A real homerun. Very drinkable, very delicious."
"Overall: My first taste of a Raccoon Lodge/Cascade beer. Very well done, I look forward to trying anything they do in the future."
"Pleasant enough and quite quaffable, Cascade's Kriek is a fine offering, though it lacks some of the complexity of other Cascade offerings (as well as other AWAs). I just wish there were a little more balance here - a little more body, a little more oak, a little more brett - but it is what it is."
"The CPJ"
"O- The alc is not present. Very drinkable and enjoyable. A memorable Flanders Red. Been craving more. Def check this out. ~$12"
"623"
"The beer pours a brilliant red color with a nice fluffy off white head. the smell is funky sour and with cherries upfront. the taste follows suit with a huge blast of sour cherry and wonderful funkiness. the mouthfeel is medium to light and well carbonated, with definitely drink this one again."
"2009 bottling from the Barrel House. Deep, murky reddish-brownish-orangish with a machiatto colored head that has pink hues to it. Pops, fizzes and crackles, but fades and doesn't leave much lace. Still very pretty. Nose is fruit up front for sure. Very nice dark and sour cherry profile here. Oak, vanilla, slight hint of funk, acid, and maybe a touch of chocolate and malt. Very strong nose. Reminds me of rock 'n roll, while lambic and flanders reds/browns usually make me think art with more mellow music in the background. Taste leads off fruity (dark cherry) gets sour in the middle and slinks away fairly cleanly with some malty accents sweetening and rounding it out. medium-full body with perfect carbonation that lightens things up just enough. At times, I was actually schwilling this beer, taking multiple gulps at once. Very good sign for me. overall, awesome. cascade is really taking things to the next level if you ask me. simply delicious and enough attitude and personality to really give it a good feel with a sense of place/terroir. winner. i will be putting several of these away."
"Overally its damn good, not yet great. To me, it seems like Cantillon Kriek mixed with Rodenbach Grand Cru."
"3.5/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"O - I have to say I'm a bit surprised about this one...pleasantly. For whatever reason (ok...its probably the typical $20/bottle price tag on the Cascade beers around here) this is the first Cascade bottle I've opened. I was somewhat expecting to be disappointed by this, but it is just the opposite. This isn't hardcore sour, but this really has some great flavors. Reminds me a little of Supplication. Guess I'll be buying this one again."
"O: Sour, with subtle funk...fruit...and caramel with generous carbonation . Very drinkable for the style. I suspect that the time spent aging this one added quite a bit to the experience. I will go searching for a few more bottles of this 2008 before they are all gone. Cheers!"
"A good effort from Cascade here... A solidly sour Kriek... A pleasant but not overwhelming tartness..."
"This is excellent and I will be back to Cascade tomorrow to buy some more. My suggestion is to not split this bottle between more than two people. It is only 6.6% and I really think you need a full glass to allow the tartness to build on your palate."
"i was quite impressed with this. this has been my 2nd cascade ale and it was every bit delicious. very intense cherry flavor. the price on these isn't the best but the quality is."
"The texture is phenomenal for any wild, but really hits the mark for a flanders red. It starts sweet and moves to earthy with a drying finish. There is no hint of the 7.3% ABV. Enjoyable throughout. I would like to pick up another to age."
"The beer is tart and acidic, but not too much so. the acid really comes out as it warms. Reminds me of a light champagne, with fruit overtones. Very drinkable, and for the right palate, a great session beer."
"A very good representation of the style. Not as good as the Sang Rouge, but enjoyable."
"7.3% isn't too much to handle ABV wise and, with all this fruit flavor and sour sting, those interested in the tartest of the tart are in for a real treat."
"My first Cascade. Runs head to head with RR's Consecration. I will have to age a bottle of both and see how they do. Cheers!"
"D - Thanks to drfabulous for another great cellar share! This is a very good one."
"D: As it goes with this style, it depends on your tolerance for sourness. In my opinion, this is a drinkable beer."
"I suspect this Kreik ale would be great for blending with another ale. It's definitely worth thinking about in the future."
"D-I am downing this 8% beer like what, but I would like to try a younger version to get more cherry"
"Poured a chocolate brown in color with pale brown yellow highlights that had a finger of bubbly head and good retention leaving some good lacing sticking to the glass. The cherries definitely pop out on the aroma with some oaky character, slight vinegar, and faint brown sugar vinous notes. The taste was also big on the cherries with vinegar, oaky and acidic accents but had some really good tart flavors as well. The brew was medium in body with a good amount carbonation which had a sweet, fruity, oaky, tart, and mild dry finish. It drank really good and was glad to have another bottle of this beer. Cascade is doin the damn thing when it comes to sours."
"D-this is a little rough, overly acidic and some offf putting vinegar flavors. the cherries are very strong and gives it a nice bit of sweetness. not bad but rough to drink."
"Very nice balanced beer. Not overly sour, the malt still keeps things in pace with the rest of the beer. Some lacto sour on the middle and finish with a tinfoil wrapped bing cherry. Hints of chocolate in the way back. Great oaky flavors with just enough tart funk in the middle to keep it quite interesting. Way to easy to drink."
"My calendar is too full to suffer muddled and acidic krieks."
"Only my third beer from this brewery, and like the previous, this does not dissappoint. Pours a light brown, starting fairly clear, but cloudy by the last glass. Short liveed beige head with sparse lacing. The cherries do present themselves in the aroma, and it is very much in line with Flanders Reds. This is somewhat lost in the taste however. Much like the New Belgium La Folie, this is a lacto-sour bomb, and that is about the extent of things. If you like that, and I do, you will dig the hell out of this beer. It is a bit thin in the mouth, but drinkability does not suffer for it. The 7.3 abv stays well hidden. Where this not so cost prohibitive, I would have no problem knocking back a couple of these excellent beers. Although, if Rodenbach Grand Cru were available in my location, I would likely not buy this again."
"Of note: consumed directly after leaving Belmont station and drinking three Russian River sours (Consecration, Supplication, Temptation). Though the RR were better, these weren't far off!"
"Drinkability: I prefer Rodenbach Grand Cru in the category - especially with Cascade's higher price tag. I'd pick it up again to highlight the style. It's good, but it's not earth shattering."
"Tasty and chock full of cherries. My only gripe is that there's very little Brett character here if any. A bit two dimensional with the cherries and lacto. Bring on the funk and we'll have a real beaut here."
"Bottle. 2009 bottle. Pours into a tall tulip glass. Pours a slightly opaque reddish color with a big fluffy very fizzy head that settle rather well into a nice coaster. Nice cherry aroma with tart sou notes. The taste is rather more subdued than j thought given the nose. Slightly sweet up front with a subtle tart note mixed in with the cherry and a slight vanilla Oaky flavor. Light mouthfeel. Rather dry. Ends cleanly. Hmmm, not the best example but not terrible either."
"as far as drinkability goes, one bottle shouldnt be a problem, but i would recommend sharing with friends. lots of lambic qualities in this beer. heavy on the tart sour cherries, light on the oaky wood. highly recommended!"
"D: As with most sours, a large bottle of this kriek is best when shared as its powerful and challenging sensory qualities can fatigue the palate. It is perhaps best appreciated when compared to a few other similar beers--Russian River supplication and Rodenbach grand cru, for example. This beer by Cascade is less sour than supplication, and has a greater fruit presence. It features less of the barrel qualities than the Rodenbach, but more harsh acidity. The bright, sour flavor and lingering acid burn makes this beer more similar to supplication."
"D - I really like this brew. It has a nice big sour kick but provides a nice subtle sweet fruity flavor as well. The fruit flavor really is top notch in this. Compared to Cantillon Kriek I think this has more fruit flavor but less funk and sour notes. Fantastic brew. I am so glad I got to try this and will have to pick up more of this fantastic beer."
"Pours a moderate amber-ruby color with a bit of an off white head and some lacing. Nose brings cherry, cherry, and cherry. Also some green apples and light oak notes. The taste is dark and bright cherries with a really nice sourness level and a bit of funk. The feel is quite good, with some puckering lactic sourness and a tiny bit of acetic character. Drinks quite well and is another solid hit from them."
"D - Very bright, refreshing and easy drinking. Very bright and it flavorful. This is a very nice beer to drink and I can't wait to get another glass..."
"Cascade Kriek Ale is not as good as the only other Raccoon Lodge and Brewpub/Cascade Brewing beer that I've had to date (Cascade Sang Royal). It's well worth the purchase price, though, for those of you who can't get enough of sour cherry beer. Pucker up!"
"Drink- Very good sour. Many fruit sours are difficult to drink, but this one is just smooth and balanced enough that I could easily finish a 750 ml bottle on my own."
"Drinkability: A fun beer to try, but I think I get the gist after one glass. Just a bit too much too handle more than one of."
"D: A must try due to just how sour it is, but not a beer that I will consume all that much of. Very interesting, but maybe just a tad over the line, Smokey."
"Overall, I would drink this bad boy again and again. Nearly rivals the deliciousness of Hanssens Oude Kriek, but just requires a little more complexity. Just a teeny bit."
"Overall great sour ale."
"On a side note, this seems like beer that could definitely hold up to additional cellaring with ease."
"This is almost too sour and not very cherry...but it is good. Definitely fun in the mouth and worth the wow factor."
"Drinkability- Really nice beer. The cherry is nice and evident and a bit fruitier than I'm used to in Wild Ales. Usually in these American Lambics the vanilla and oak are more evident than the brews across the pond. This one is a bit different as the wood is subdued and the beer is slightly more sour. Great stuff here, thanks much!!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy reddish brown amber with a light tan and sticky head that leaves very nice lace. The aroma is slightly funky and tart, but with decent dose of sweetness as well. Alcohol is also present in the nose. I personally don't pick up a huge cherry aroma. It is fruity for sure, but reminds me more of apple or pear. The taste is puckeringly sour. It's a sour patch kid like acidic tartness, and is not really all that funky or musty. Much like the nose, there does not seem to be any real cherry like flavors, and it is just generically fruity and quite sugary from the malt bill. It tastes good, but on the other hand I wish that there was more going on than just an enjoyable sourfest in my mouth. As the beer warms I am able to pick out some nice woody tannins, but they are buried pretty far in the background. The mouthfeel is medium and very dry, but does not get too sticky and it is quite refreshing. It is a fairly drinkable beer, and the ABV is well hidden, except for in the nose. I just can't help thinking that overall this beer is lacking something that could take it to the next level."
"A very fine beer, especially for sour beer lovers. Quite impressive..."
"D - liked it. great balance, tasty, and pretty refreshing. alcohol is dangerously hidden for +7%. no problem curing the sour-craving."
"Drinkable and tasty, at least if you like your beers sour. Lately this style has been the hot thing in craft beer and it now seems that I've gotta keep an eye out for other beers from Raccoon Lodge."
"Drinkability is nice, but a filling beer overall."
"D - very good at only 7.3% could def enjoy a few of these"
"Not bad, but definitely not blown away. Shared with a friend and am glad, would not have enjoyed another 12oz of this beer..."
"I'd definitely try other years of this beer as well as other beers from this brewery - definitely got me curious."
"D: Not overly sour with good balancing elements and no sign of the alcohol. Very easy drinking."
" I finished the bomber, It will be awhile till my tongue heals enough, but I will do this again!"
"d-I should have shared this bottle. The sourness is getting to be a bit much. That said I did enjoy the beer. nice cherry flavor."
"D - Rated high as I liked this a lot and would have again I felt this did the still quite well."
"The body should either be thinner, or the beer should be more carbonated. This may be a tough one to get through the whole 750ml, but I think I'll make it."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, you don't even realize there is alcohol in your glass. I had an almost 3 year old NB La Folie a few days ago that had similar qualities but the NB was a bit more enjoyable. I plan to get another of these to age and see how it goes. I do like this beer."
"Drinkability: not bad, but Ive had better in the category. aging might help this beer alot."
"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay glass. Pours a hazy red with a nice amount of head, some lacing, and a little bit of sediment. Smells pretty much of straight up cherries, very nice. The taste is of sour cherries, with some apple in there too. Nicely carbonated, very good mouthfeel, and was able to drink all 750 mls by myself. Highly recommended!!"
"D- well this is one hell of a flanders. The cherries while clearly present never over take the red ale. Super refreshing and ill be seeking out more."
"D - Very crisp and refreshing, but not something I can drink a lot of (pass the antacid please). Split with 5 people after dinner at a tapas bar, perfect as a digestif nightcap."
"D: A decent brew, but there are better Flanders Reds out there and if I want cherries I'll take a real Kriek."
"J"
"Pours a dark red, almost brown color, with a big fluffy tan head. Doesn't leave a lot of lacing. Overall, a nice looking beer. In the smell, I can definitely pick up cherries, mostly dark overripe, sweet cherries. Nice and fleshy. But there is a little tarness in there. I also get a nice big whiff of gym sock. Pretty funky. The smell is pretty good. The taste, of course, starts out with cherries, and it has a bit of tartness. A nice subdued tartness, but there's enough to balance the sweetness of the fruit. The beer is not too acidic, either. The acidity is quite subdued. I can taste a little malt, and there's a slight toastiness, which is different and nice. The funkiness of the smell doesn't translate directly to the taste, but I do get some lingering funkiness, musty fruit, a little straw, and a finish that has a nice blend of sweetness and tartness. The body is medium thin, with decent carbonation. It's smooth and mellow, and the alcohol is not incredibly noticable. It's pretty good, actually a little refreshing, I'm surprised to say, and the bit of toastiness keeps it interesting, still a litle too strong and rich for another beer afterwards."
"Do not drink this at fridge temp! I started to, and then stopped...because the fridgid temps really mask the great fruit flavors, and the tartness and carbonation dominates. Once its at perfect temp for drinking, the sour cherries are light, but just enough to please. The tartness is still very strong, and dominates throughout. A slight funkiness and pretty potent acidic notes provides and awesome comparison in complexity. Light and crisp, carbonated...and very yummy!"
"Poured into a tulip and really glad to have gotten my hands on this beer. Ruby red color with slightly reddish head. Tight bubbles and a small amount of lacing around the glass. Aroma's initially of lactic sourness, big time, basement, and some faint cherry. As the beer warms more cherry aroma becomes apparent and the sour aroma calms a little. The flavor is bracingly tart, a good thing. Other flavors from the oak and malty body. Again as the beer breaths cherry beomces more pronounced. Grassy hoppiness is very faint but there. Way more kriek then sour red thats for sure. Not much risidual sweetness at all. Feels effervecent in the mouth, nicely bubbly. This beer sits on your tongue for some time. Long lasting aftertaste. Would get a higher drinkability score but its just so tart!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is through the roof, I would have no problem finishing this brew myself. Overall, my 5 or so ounce pour wasn't nearly enough. For me, this and the barrel aged blackbeerd were the stars of the night. Skal."
"Drinkability: High; this is a good beer, but I can't help but think it could have been better after having the apricot offering first. This brewery is / should be the next big thing."
"Overall, a very drinkable and tasty beer. However, it's a bit lacking in complexity, and could use a hair more body. However, if this was readily available to me, and a hair cheaper, I would drink it often."
"2008 vintage. The beer pours a hazy brownish-red color with a white head. The aroma is cherries, oak and vanilla. The flavor is more of the same with a large amount of cherries complimented by the characteristics of barrel aging. Low to medium tartness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"750ml bottle thanks to SincereNC. I split this with a couple friends and it was pretty good. Dark and cloudy red with a sour cherry aroma to it. The flavor was acidic and sour and also had interesting cherry flavors which balanced out the beer nicely. The alcohol was well restrained and I would definitely buy this again if it were not so expensive."
"D: This another outstanding sour from Cascade, just really well made."
"The body was on the thin side of average for the these types of beers. Drinkability is very good, if you're into the sours. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that's worth your time, if you like palate wreckingly sour brews. You've had fair notice."
"D: Probably one of, if not the best beer I've had in its style, this one is truly different from its peers for the amout of fruit present in both the nose and taste. Cherries are unmistakable here and creates a beer that isn't just tart and sour. Simply fantastic and I'm grateful to have had a chance to try it!"
"D: This is a delicious and easy drinking Kriek, and I wish this wasn't my only bottle..."
"D - This is a very delicious beer. Perhaps the best of the Cascade sours, despite its wide availability."
"Pours a solid hazy amber with fluffy cream head. Beautiful aroma of lemon, raisin and cherry. Touch of honey on the tongue and then an amazing cherry tartness. Incredible balance of sweet fruit flavor with a good sourness. Good carb on this one, unlike a couple other Cascades which are a bit lively."
"Edited after my second offering! Secured a bottle via trade."
"Murky blood red color with a pinkish off white head that fades to a thick ring of bubbles and little lacing. Aroma is mildly tart and acidic, faint fresh cherries, a little funk. Medium body with soft carbonation, not overly acidic or vinegary, finish is pleasant earthy funk with real, ripe cherries. Not a traditional Kriek; has a more restrained cherry sweetness with an effervescent body with mild funk and tart finish."
"I'd been waiting to try something from this brewery for ages, and am very happy to have cracked this open - my expectations were easily met if not exceeded. This is a superior domestic version of the style and I find myself on the edge of rating it higher, but it strikes me as just a tiny bit too simplistic compared to the very best examples."
"Excellent beer."
"The alcoholic in me has figured out that for the price of one Red Poppy, I get thrice as much alcohol in this beer, and while it's not a fair comparison, it's a beer I'd gladly consume much more frequently. In some ways, the explosive fruit character brings to mind a fresher Drie Fonteinen Oude Kriek."
"D: I'd heard mixed reviews of this beer, but found it to be very enjoyable. I'd be happy to have this one again."
"A notb highlight."
"Certainly not worth the price that I paid. A good beer, but not quite great."
"D-Good--not a crazy sour brew--but solid. Nice tartness and a very real Bing Cherry flavour. Quite nice but it didn't blow me away."
"Drinkability: A wonderful flavor and an even better nose. This is a great beer. I think the beer could have used just a little more malt on the backbone to raise the body, although I personally wouldn't want any more malt flavor in it. The alcohol didn't show itself during a single sip of this."
"Overall, this beer wasn't as sour/good as I was expecting it to be. Not to the style as I wanted it to be. Good, but just not great because it lacks flavors."
"Lightly sour and pleasant. Very drinkable and elegant, although could be more sour and flavors could be a bit brighter for my personal taste."
"The taste, too, is focused on cherries. They're slightly sweet and lightly tart with a dash of unripe cherry skins. Wood notes are faint in the background, and acetic character is at an upper low level. With no Brettanomyces, and with Lactobacillus as the only bacteria, the sourness is clean and there's no funk to speak of. The resulting flavor is pretty straight forward, but the quality of the fruit makes this immensely enjoyable."
"Tart and crisp with and airy freshness. Cherries, of course, and some nutmeg/clove spice. Definitely a sipper."
"Yet another American brewer that gets it when it comes to Belgian beer. You have to wonder what a few years of cellaring will do to this beer. Either way, its good while it lasts. Seek this one out."
"Quite acidic cherry with a light refreshing mouthfeel. A real treat, I could drink alot of this despite the 8%. Wish I had some, this truely is one of the best kriek's out there."
"Medium body has a delicate carbonation. Nice acidic finish. Great Flanders Red from Cascade."
"- Another fantastic sour from Cascade... this one is a big drinkable among the others... much like the Apricot, but even better in drinkablility. Doesn't touch the Sang Royal though..."
"All kinds of funk and nice and tart. It's not as sour as RGC, but still great! Highly carbonated. The cherry is there, but not overwhelming - perfect, IMO. The aroma is unbelievably complex. I love the cheesy/cherry taste! If you want tear-bringing sourness, look elsewhere. This is not a ""fruit beer"" this is a beer with some fruit."
"Bottle from Boston town. A well done Flanders Red, sourish with good cherry taste, always well malted. Good to share, as even a third of the bottle is a bunch of sourness. Dark reddish colour and spider lacey Above average mouthfeel. Good nose. A tad funky sweaty taste in there."
"This is the first Cascade sour I've tried, but I have a few in my basement still, and after trying this one I'm looking forward to trying the others also. Pretty drinkable; a good beer overall."
"Bottle: Poured a murky red color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sour cherries with some lightly sweet notes and some tannin and oak notes are also discernible. Taste is a very well balance mix between some tart notes, sour cherries with underlying sweetness and some light tannin and oak notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and no alcohol was apparent. Very well done and wouldn't pale in comparison of some good Belgian fruit lambic."
"Frothy pour, with some nested larger bubbles on the surface. Murky, rusty orange scarlet color. Some spotty lace inside the glass. Mild berry nose, cherry candy, too clean with very little funk present. Clean and dry tartness, lactobacillius, seedy cherry pit, stonefruit essence. Very effervescent. Dry with a clean finish that disappears quickly. Tartness is maybe a 4/10 scale. Refreshing fruit beer that is nice in warm weather. Not a lambic in the traditional sense, but it was enjoyable regardless. Thanks again Chris!"
"Nice bubbling carbonation, quite drinkable considering the sourness."
"D-4.0"
"D: Very drinkable for 8.1% I was really impressed by their beers at our sour tasting. No hint of the ABV at all."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased over the phone from the brewery about a year ago, had this along with the Apricot, Cuvee, and Blackberry with four friends a few nights ago, reviewed from notes, poured into my Dogfish Head snifter, color is a deep amber with some pink edges, 1/2 inch bubbly white head, decent retention, some light lacing, aroma consists of cherries, funkiness, dark malts, lacto, bit of whiskey-like booze, oak, and tobacco, flavor begins with various cherry flavors, both black and fresh cherries you would find on the top of a sundae, more sweet than anything in the middle with more fruit flavors, finish has lots of oak and bit of vinegar to go with the cherry flavors, oaky, tart,and sweet mouthfeel, full bodied, lightly carbonated compared to their other bottles, could drink a lot of this, alcohol is hidden well, fairly easy drinking for its style, this beer cellars pretty well and I wish I had more to try it out for longer periods of time, worth checking out"
"Strawberry guava color, totally opaque with a pinkish ecru head that sticks around well. Aroma is part black cherries and part maraschino cherries. Slightly tart with some strawberry notes. Flavor is not really that robust or characterful. Sort of boring cherry taste with a little tartness. Kinda like eating a cherry that's not very ripe yet. Semidry mouthfeel, cherry pit finish, easy to drink but I doubt I could drink an entire 750."
"This may be Portland's answer to Alpine Chez Monieux. Pours a murky orange-red with a mahogany center. Short-lived white head with no lacing. Impressive sour cherry aroma with a graham cracker crust. Basically a cherry cobbler without the brown sugar. Sharp, bitter taste with an acidic mouthfeel. Carbonated with a dry mouthfeel. Warm cherry and sherry taste. Delicious cherry preserves follow with a bitter bite. No medicine, Nyquil, or cherry candy flavors, which is a HUGE plus. Just a simple, great lambic."
"Glad Kersta sent me a bottle of this. I won't be sharing mine!"
"D - Pretty good kriek overall, although not a lot of sourness compared to other krieks I've had. Still, this one offers a pleasant cherry flavor."
"I was actually disappointed with this one. Worth trying but I don't think I would grab this one again at $20 a 750 ML."
"Notes from and tasted on: 5/21/09"
"This does get a little hefty to knock down - the complexity is a weight unto itself. But it's so damn good nonetheless. Am diggin' this sumpm wicked fierce."
"My bottle says 8.1%, above it says 6.6% so mine is different. 8.1% is very unusual for a lambic, I guess since it's an American interpretation it makes sense. This is the tastiest Kriek I have had."
"'08 vintage. Clearish ruby-amber appearance with a short-lived off-white head. Massive sweet-tart cherry aroma, like a slice of freshly baked cherry pie. Very faint funk and oak beneath that, this one is more about the fruit. Similar on the palate; intensely fruity with mild sourness and tannins. Dry, tart mouthfeel with crisp carbonation. Like Cascade's apricot ale, the kriek has an expressive fruit character but very restrained acidity and sourness. People expecting a palate-lacerating wild ale will be disappointed, but Cascade done a good job with making fruit-forward beers that aren't cloying."
"northwestern sour red ale aged over bing and sour pie cherries for 12 months. 8ish%. brownish red hue with a lively carbonation and fluffy head. base beer is a blend of flanders red styles, bringing out some lactic notes, a sharp tartness, and a hint of wet oak. the cherries add a pie-filling real fruit kick, but subtle and present mostly in the end of the sip. like i imagined, this beer has flavor from NG belgian red, just enough to make a flanders red with fruit notes. despite big, complex flavors, this beer lacks any overbearing qualities which make it extremely drinkable. super beer."
"D - Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Not the normal kriek you have that is like candy. This is very solid and highly recommended."
"4/4/4.5/4/4"
"The beer tastes of tart, dry cherries up front, but this is only one component of the flavor. There is also a lactic-acid driven lemon-like not up front that moves to a fleshy, full cherry skin flavor that couples with a tannic finish. The tannic note provides a light astringency in the finish, but I can't quite help coming back to the fresh, complex even, cherry flavor that is not overly dominant, but is so aromatic tasting (if that makes any sense). This is a nice beer, it could be a touch more funky (it showed some promise of this in the aroma) as it is mostly sour, but it is certainly an enjoyable beer."
"Cascade Kriek is a worthy tribute to the lambic cherry style. My first glass was clear sunset amber, but subsequent servings poured out with greater turbidity. It is not sweet and candy-like, but bracing, acidic, and complementary to a host of foods. A curious wash of cinnamon emerges after some warming, making the beer none-too-challenging to appreciate. At $17.50 a bottle, it ain't cheap. But the process of producing ales of this sort lends an obvious justification to the expense and its overall quality is worth the infrequent indulgence."
"Drinkability: Quite nice! Pleasantly fruity and all kinds of refreshing. I certainly enjoyed this one more than I thought I would."
"Drinkability: Better than the blackberry, I just love the way this brewer combines the American fruit with the Belgian funk; kudos"
"Drinkability was high for me, I really have been enjoying Racoon's sour beers, and can't applaud them enough for continuing to produce them, something very few PDX brewers are doing. Of the three in this series, this is my second favorite, behind the apricot trippel and in front of the blackberry, though all of them are good! Can't wait until there next few come out, the cuvee in particular will really be a treat! I didn't factor in availability or cost, but this is expensive and limited, which of course means I'm not drinking it by the case, although I wish I was."
