The tart smell, reminiscent of a natural, crisp, hard apple cider, is a delight to the olfactory buds.   The flavor is also crisp, modestly sour and has a very clean finish. If you enjoy sour beers, you should give Strubbe's a try. I believe it will be your gold-standard on which to compare other beers of this style.","NWFLyer","Dec 08, 2014"

Scents of Balsamic vinegar, sour cherries, overripe fruit, sour funk and faint caramel malt. A good sour aroma, quite appealing. Flavor begins with sour and funky notes alongside sweet, moscato-like white grape, moving into some indeterminate fruity flavors, sour apple, caramel and earthy mustiness. The finish is tart, with some sweetness. An excellent flavor profile that blends sour and sweet into a lovely whole. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a slightly sticky, semi-drying feel. Quite nice. Overall this was a great Flanders Red that has an excellent aroma, flavor and mouthfeel.

The taste is much less vinegary (thankfully). Cherry, sour apples, grapes, berries, slight vinegar in the background and a little lemon. The body is light and the carbonation is a little lower than I thought it'd be. The sour level on this is way lower than expected. Just a slight tartness.

Very vinous as far as the taste is concerned. You definitely get cherry, but not especially sweet. A hint of black pepper can also be detected here.

Super rare steak and this beer need to come together soon.","jamie2dope","Jul 17, 2011"
3.93,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Nice prickly carbonation up front, a balanced sweet malt and tart berry middle. Finish is dry and lightly puckering - I'd say overall it's a very refreshing balance and this is one of the more easy drinking Flemish reds I've had. It does well after some warmth allowing the bugs to bite a little more - would be interesting to try one with some cellar time. Not the best, but a very good intro.","OldIronLungs","Jun 05, 2011"
4.15,10.4,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"O: A very nice example of this style. I would easily put this into the ranks of Rodenbach. Very drinkable and quite delicious!","Pehlman","May 15, 2011"
3.2,-14.9,4,4,3,2,3,"O: Not a bad beer, kind of on the lower end of the style for me, nothing really here to come back to. As a stand alone beer it's a B, just not very good to style, compared with Rodenbach or La Folie, there's no contest.","Halcyondays","May 08, 2011"
3.28,-12.8,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Worth a try for sure and perhaps a good cross into reds. It does blend better as the temperature increases. Perhaps I began at too low a temp. Worth trying not my favorite.","Rassputtin","Apr 30, 2011"
3.38,-10.1,3,2.5,4,3,3.5,"Overall. Decent refreshing sour beer, nothing to right home about, I would drink it over any other common main stream beer but only as a last result.","alexhahn82","Apr 14, 2011"
2.63,-30.1,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Notes: Well balanced, but lacks depth especially for the style. A sour beer that since it isn't so sour would be good with food.","4000qtrap","Mar 21, 2011"
3.59,-4.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall this is a a little rough around the edges although certainly above average.","TheSupremeAJ","Jan 14, 2011"
3.8,1.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. 33cl bottle served in my ST tulip. Pours a hazy mahogany with a half inch bright white head that dissipates into a frothy skim. Some spots and thin slashes of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose is tart, acidic, oaky and sour cherries. Taste is consistent with nose; however, not as sweet as anticipated. There's also a bit of yeasty character in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation (perhaps a little creamy towards the middle) that culminates in a semi-dry finish. An easy drinking Flanders Red that would make a great gateway beer for someone just getting into sours.","Jwale73","Jan 05, 2011"
3.9,3.7,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A very drinkable ""Flemish"" ale, and one which other non-sour drinkers found very interesting and inviting. I hope to get more to see if the Brett and Lacto improve or get funkier with a little more time...","amcmaho1","Oct 25, 2010"
4.47,18.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very drinkable and very nice. This is a beer that the inexperienced and experienced will both like. Good with lots of food profiles.","GRG1313","Aug 28, 2010"
3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste matches the smell (sweet) but soon gives way to a very tangy flavor, with an oaky, bourbony (if that's a word) presence.","CaptainPiret","Apr 10, 2010"
3.97,5.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"D - An interesting, complex & tasty beer. Well worth trying & something I'd buy again.","brendan13","Aug 24, 2008"
3.59,-4.5,4.5,3,4,4,3,"I could not taste the yeast in this beer, but this seems to fit the Flemish Red Ale category definition perfectly, and while it was too sour from my perspective and definitely not a session beer, I still found it somewhat enjoyable. This is a good beer and worth trying.","CHickman","Feb 26, 2006"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"33 cl bottle pours a mostly clear, rusty brown body with a small and fleeting beige head. Specks of lacing left on the snifter. Aroma of earthy wood, cranberries, cherry skins, and caramel. Light medium body has a subtle, but effective, carbonation. Taste is mostly sour, with cranberries and cherry skins. Some apple cider vinegar notes, as well. Earthy and woody notes pervade from start to finish. A hint of caramel keeps the sourness in check. Very well executed and pleasantly drinkable.","merlin48","Feb 18, 2006"
4.27,13.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured a nice orange toned brown color from the tap into a very nice looking goblet style glass. The head was non-existant, but I can't say if it was the beer or whatever the bar happened to wash the glass with. After a few sipps the head on the side of the glass remained. The flavor was sweet and sour with a tart aftertaste. Very light in the body making this a highly drinkable beer. My first beer of this event, so I was hirsty, but still a good start regaurless.","gdogalishus","Beers"
4.2,11.7,4,4,4,4,5,"served a clear dark orange with minimal head. Smell is of balsamic vinigar with a hint of sweetness. Taste mimics the smell. Crisp. dry aftertaste. Infinately drinkable. Light body and not too much of anything but more than enough to be interesting. Excellent.","sacfly","0"
