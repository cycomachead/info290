"Drinkability is good, a restrained Flanders Red with all the key characteristics, and value price to boot."

"Drink- Â Its okay. Just seemed like a miss after having some of the best in the class with Gilgamesh just dominating this beer."

"On tap at the downtown San Diego location. Not bad at first but doesn't offer much pleasure after a few sips."

"An average and uninspired Flanders red, but there will usually be better options available."
"O: The vinegar flavor was a bit too abrasive and the amount of sweetness was a bit odd."
"Ruby mahogony with thin egg shell head. Nose is sweet, candied dark fruits and sour notes, a bit of wood, vanilla. Taste is soft sour cherries, vanilla, light molasses. Supplication-esque? Very very slightly acidic. Mouthfeel is great, not overcarbonated, keeps smooth to match the vanilla character. Overall, I am very impressed, I haven't a clue how this has such a low score."
"Overall: A better than expected Flanders Red from Karl Strauss. Recommended."
"Poured on-tap in downtown San Diego at the Columbia Street brewpub. The beer was poured into a pint glass, and it poured a dark copper-brown, cloudy coloring. There was a ring of filmy head on the beer. The beer smelled like spilled, dried beer, with overtones of sour malts. The beer tastes are middle of the tongue sour malts all the way. Brutal sour. The sour notes are similar to those of a cider. The sourness actually hits right in the TMJ (joint of the jaw). Not easy to drink. The flavors do not justify the wrecking ball effect the beer has on your mouth and tastebuds."
"Again, I'm happy Karl is making this. Definitely try it. Keep it up, Karl!"
