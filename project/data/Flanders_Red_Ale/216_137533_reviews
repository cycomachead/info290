"Enjoyable beer, even though it is neither very sour not very sweet (and definitely not bitter)."

"Drain pour. I really didn't enjoy this. Maybe a bad batch or something, but I hated it."
"Very good overall"
"o: a ridiculously good sour ale.  complex, sour, delicious, drinkable.  a real winner"
"Clear brownish-red colour, 1.5 fingers of beige head, some lace. Smell comes across more acidic than most in the style and more so than most other Rodenbach's, vinous, sharp fruity notes and cherry with a bit of wet wood. Taste is a nice mix of both sweet and sour, cherry and red grape, vinous aspects throughout, lighty acidic with a mild puckering sourness followed by a dry fruity-malty finish with more cherry and plum. Medium carbonation, medium body drying feel in finish. Quite good, not as good as the 2010 Vintage but better than the Grand Cru."

"(O) This is just a stellar beer.  It is understandable why Rodenbach is the champion of the style."
"Amazing stuff from rodenbach, rich fruit character with a generous acidiy and sourness but this balanced out really well, and had some support from the oak to play really well together, very drinkable and satisfying."
"I bought 7 bottles, and I think its at its peak now. If this beer is anything like the 2011 the vinegar will quickly dominate the cherry/sherry. Perhaps this beer isn't pasteurized (the Grand Cru is: see Palm's website) and continues to dry out."

"A delicious and memorable Rodenbach.  Probably gets even better with age, but not too much though.  Tricky thing is to find the sweet spot!"

"Sour cherry mixed with mild oak. Just fantastic."
"High B"
"Along with usual Rodenbach's aromas and flavours, there was something that reminded me of a nail polishing liquid and similar. Maybe it was my glass?"
"Incredible sweet and sour balance with a unique character and great complexity. Not too sour, not too sweet and not too funky. They sure produce my favorite Flanders Red Ales."
