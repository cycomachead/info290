"Short Review.  This was a very nice Flanders Red, it's just what I expect from the style and I thought it had the right amount of sour without being overly acidic.  I enjoyed it and I was happy to have the chance to try it.  It would be great to see them distribute it, I wouldn't mind if they canned it, but I'm sure they would go the wax dipped bottle route."

"This is a really great tasting and very smooth Flanders style Red. It has a mild sour flavor, but in a really good way. The appearance is just beautiful. It is a rich red with a white light bubbly head. It is very clear also, a sign of what is to come. I had a nice smell, fruity and mild with lightly sour smell. The taste is very mild and smooth, but with great flavor. The sourness is very noticeable, but not overpowering. The mouth feel is excellent and the beer disappeared very quickly. Did I say it was smooth? This is one of my new favorites, as I am fast becoming a major fan of sours."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its aroma. This showed boldness, with excellent sour yeastiness and bite, especially as it warmed. The flavoring showed more of the same, but was a bit light for the style and our taste buds alike. The malts, too, were on the darker and more bittered side, taking away from the styleâ€™s usual sweeter fruity inclusions, and making a more malt forward and dominant beverage. With this beer it seemed like they were trying to ease up on the overt sourness and fruitiness of the style, and instead make it more approachable for people who may not be familiar with such bold beers. While this certainly aids drinkability, it makes it slightly less exciting for those of us who want to be knocked off our seats with those unique flavors. That said, this was a tasty treat, and again, something highly approachable and drinkable for many."
