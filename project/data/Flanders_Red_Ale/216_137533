4.27,2.9,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"Clear brownish-red colour, 1.5 fingers of beige head, some lace. Smell comes across more acidic than most in the style and more so than most other Rodenbach's, vinous, sharp fruity notes and cherry with a bit of wet wood. Taste is a nice mix of both sweet and sour, cherry and red grape, vinous aspects throughout, lighty acidic with a mild puckering sourness followed by a dry fruity-malty finish with more cherry and plum. Medium carbonation, medium body drying feel in finish. Quite good, not as good as the 2010 Vintage but better than the Grand Cru.","peensteen","Feb 16, 2015"

4.29,3.4,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,"Amazing stuff from rodenbach, rich fruit character with a generous acidiy and sourness but this balanced out really well, and had some support from the oak to play really well together, very drinkable and satisfying.","mick303","Feb 13, 2015"
4.15,0,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"I bought 7 bottles, and I think its at its peak now. If this beer is anything like the 2011 the vinegar will quickly dominate the cherry/sherry. Perhaps this beer isn't pasteurized (the Grand Cru is: see Palm's website) and continues to dry out.","AugustusRex","Feb 13, 2015"
