"Taste is pretty tart with a pleasant cheese rind funk. Somewhat one dimensional but tasty and drinkable. Significant oaky presence.  If this was 12.99 a 750 I'd drink it often, but the ultra premium of $12/9oz is a little much. This does doesn't really approach traditional lambic, though it seems that's what it was shooting for, I did enjoy it. Not at all a Flanders Red."

"The beer was served in a snifter.  The beer appeared a nice deep, clear red with a small, thin white head and some lacing.  The beer gave off a very nice sour aroma, acidic and citrus.  The taste of the beer was a nice, sharp sourness to it, with a light body, which was very easy to drink.  Overall, a nice representation of the style.  I would have had a few more, if I could have."

"Overall - The style says Flanders Red as I review this, but it reminds me much more of a oak soured pale."
