4.42,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/30/2014. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red/brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big sour cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, light cocoa, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big sour cherry, raspberry, cranberry, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, light cocoa, oak, leather, musty funk, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Large amount of acidic sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour cherry, cranberry, raspberry, green apple, red wine vinegar, hay, straw, caramel, toast, leather, musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; with a nice sweetness/sourness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Flanders red ale! All around fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, dark malt, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink even with the high level of acidity. An insanely delicious offering.","superspak","Mar 19, 2015"

I can't help but smile as I enjoy one of these... is it just the tart punch to the face that makes me look like I am smiling? So many questions... this reminded me a lot of the Duchesse, save the interesting mahogany hue when held to the light, increased 'punch' of the tart cherry flavor, hint of vanilla, and slightly drier finish. I rated Duchesse very high, and this one would be just a bit higher. What it loses a bit in balance, it makes up for with the intensity of flavor. Eye-opening. Again, I scored the components high, but the overall package is so much more complex and gratifying. Perfection in my eyes. Seek this out. ASAP.","Mikus","Jan 10, 2015"

When I tasted it, I got a strong, almost vinegar-like hit on my tongue, followed by some flowery accents.  It's sour and good.  The mouthfeel was also very smooth, with a medium body and a little carbonation.  Overall, I really like this, and I think I really like these brews in general.  I'm going to keep going back to these Belgian ales.  Most definitely.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Nov 30, 2014"

It has a gentle fruity note of overripe grapes, which goes well with the sharp vinegar bite, resulting in a very pleasant taste, which reminds me of a good, medium-bodied wine. This brew has a fantastic complexity compared to its relatively low abv, with an intense, dry sourness, which gets especially recognizable during the finish, which is like the rest of the beer just very enjoyable.","aleigator","0"

Typical of the style in most respects, although a bite more tart and slightly more bitter (and less sweet) than others.

The other two are more than respectable brews but don't quite offer the sour kick seasoned sour beer fans are looking for; they're the 'training wheel' sours.

A good mix of sweet and sour, but the sourness wins. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated.

Hats off to the LCBO though, for taking a chance on selling this unusual style of beer. CJR is quite reasonably priced at $3.30 per 330 ml bottle, and I'd recommend giving it a try if you're looking for a style that's out of the ordinary.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 12, 2014"

Some light thin retention and scattered lacing. The smell of the beer give off some big oaky sour cherry aromas. The taste is tart up front with plenty of sweet & sour cherry flavors there is a bit of oak and vanilla. This beer finishes with a slight malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, smooth and dry in the finish. Overall it's a very good Flanders Red. Really glad to have tried this again. Worth checking out.","Knapp85","Jun 21, 2013"

This pours a slightly hazy dark brown with hints of read and a smaller fizzy short lived head. The smells are very tart and vinegary, sour cherries, brett, some barnyard funk and a hint of vanilla. The feel is medium, high carbonination. The taste is amazing, extremely tart / sour, almost overwhelming, but then you get a hint of sweet balance, some vanilla, plenty of sour cherries. I wish I bought more of these, this is excellent, one of the finest sours I've had.","DavidST","Dec 18, 2012"

Vinous aroma of cherries with light vinegar and wood. Flavor is intense cherry, acidic but also sweet, little malt presence. Finishes dry and sharp with a hint of wild yeast; I'm not detecting the oak from the aroma in the taste.. Light to medium bodied and the mouthfeel is good from the combination of carbonation and the acidic nature of the beer. I'm not a big sour beer fan, but this flanders red, with its clearly defined and strong flavors, is quite nice. The intense cherry element is very fresh tasting.

A hint of cocoa and oak barrels flash in the middle before the finish of dry, crisp sourness. Although Rouge is a sipper, it never once tires the tongue. Very drinkable, and the tart medium body is perfectly carbonated. I'm exuberant to have this sour beer distributed in Texas, and the price point makes it all the sweeter.","wagenvolks","Beers"

The nose is about what one might anticipate from the style. There's a definite acidic presence in the nose that's counterbalanced by a cherry pit aroma that nicely displays both some fruity notes and woody ones as well. I just wish that those aromas would have stood out more against the sour aspect of the nose. Cherry fruitiness definitely gains prominence to balance the vinegary nature of the beer, but at the expense of that nice subtle oak presence that is in the aroma. The body is nice and light, but the carbonation is a bit overdone and is distracting at times.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, funk. and a nice floral followthrough. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a damn good brew. For the ABV on this one it wasn't overly easy to drink large quantities of this one surprisingly. I did manage to knock out half a growler in around an hour though.

The flavor comes on with bright tartness, sharp sour cherry with maple and oak malt suggestions. I get pineapple over some sweet fruit nougat, but the theme is, of course, tart berry in a medium light bodied brew with very tasteful but lively, fine carbonation.

Not funky, just oaky. woody allen. Flavorful. Feel is smooth from some malt and a chocolate vibe but it's also tart and bold. Id say medium bodied with light carb. I like how the vinegar is low, if it was more I would not like this. Is this the same beer as Ommegang Rouge, if it is, this has a bit more of a body on er. Very similiar.

I tried this beer against Rodenbach Grand Cru, and, though it wasn't quite up to that world class beer, it still had a quite good showing. Cuvee des Jacobins Rouge looks about the same as any Flanders Red, perhaps leaning toward red rather than mahogany. Small white head. This beer smells and tastes of raspberries, cherries, oak and sour. It's actually not too far from the Rodenbach beers - perhaps three quarters of the step between normal Rodenbach and the Grand Cru, though without that beer's lovely feel. The beer was a bit more acidic than the Grand Cru, and it was fruitier and sourer to the GC's woodier, more refined nature; still quite good.

Letting it linger in the mouth reveals some nice underlying malty brown ale-like flavors underneath the sourness.","bobjonesSD","0"

3.75,-13.4,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"A really dark red beer with some visible carbonation. It smells a little fruity, mostly cherries. The beer also tastes very cherry, with a serious sour after taste. The beer was very light and carbonated - almost tasting fizzy. Enjoyable and really pushes the idea of what to expect when you sit down to drink a beer.","lownote","Aug 13, 2009"
4.2,-3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D- Not too sour and very well balanced. Overall, a really good example of the Flanders Style ale without being too vinegar-y.","JoeMayo","Aug 09, 2009"
3.72,-14.1,4,4.5,4,2,3,"D- I enjoyed trying this beer, but could not consider ordering another 12 oz. glass... the sourness and dryness of the beer becomes overpowering with time (perhaps as the beer warms?), and I prefer to have the accompaniment of ""sweet"" with this style.","jgasparine","Aug 08, 2009"
4.23,-2.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Bring on the Funk, Bring on the Sour! A great pour of dark cherry red. Smells of dried cherries, a little lemon and Belgian Funk! The taste is even better. Gives that great sour cherry pucker at first, then you get the great funk you get from good Belgian beers. Nice dry smooth mouthfeel. Not a bitter sour but a good sour.","Liverpool08","Aug 06, 2009"

4.57,5.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very well done example of the style. Tawny red in color with a tightly compacted, meringue-like head which dissipates quickly. Sharp lactic notes upfront with a measured amount of acetic acid and a refreshingly dry finish. Dried dark cherries, lactic acid, balsamic vinegar and wet leather predominate on the nose with a slight chocolatey/toasted malt undertone. Medium-thin mouthfeel. I know it's a bold statement but this rivals both Rodenbach Grand Cru and Panil. If you can find it, try it.","justJohn","Jul 13, 2009"
4.17,-3.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Notes: I was hesitant to order this at $9 a pour, but I found it to be a very nice and unique red, somewhere between Rodenbach Grand Cru and St bernardus ABT 12 with some gueuze to lighten it up.","Maction","Jul 09, 2009"
3.3,-23.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Draught at Dirty Truth. Pours opaque dark red without much of a head. Smells surprisingly sweet, with lots of typical sour cherry. Pretty acetic. A bit of barnyard 'funkiness', though that's really in the back seat here. Tastes of sour cherry, with artificial sweetening pretty evident, unfortunately. Quite fruity. Not what one would expect of a sour/lambic mix.","philipquarles","Jul 08, 2009"

4.52,4.4,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Taste is quite the kick, strong sour/tart presence but after the first few sips you get used to it, good fruity presence with good carbonation, not thick or sugary or cloyingly sweet either, a good balance overall and a good sourish selection for a new Maine beer bar to have.","deltatauhobbit","Beers"
