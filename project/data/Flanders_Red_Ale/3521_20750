Aromas of big tart cherry, cherry skin, apple, cranberry, earthiness, funk, grass, oak, light acidity, and yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, apple, cranberry, pepper, earth, grass, light vinegar, oak, and yeast spices. Light tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, apple, cranberry, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice tart and sweet flavor balance and complexity; with cherry sweetness being more prominent. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly slick and syrupy mouthfeel as expected. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Very smooth to drink but is a bit of a sipper. Overall this is a fantastic, very pleasant, and enjoyable Flanders red ale. Nice complexity and balance; and very smooth to drink. I had no trouble finishing the 750.","superspak","Apr 03, 2012"

This beer lives up to its name and is indeed sweet and sour at the same time. There is a lower level of carbonation with only a slight crispness.

Ever so slight touch of red wine vinegar. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and drying.

Very drinkable, but not quite as sour as I anticipated, which is not a knock; this is well within style. I do live very close to the Jolly Pumpkin, however, and anticipate more than a complimentary sourness in sour ales as a result.

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste is a little tougher to measure. The beer falls somewhere between the sweetness of a Duchesse and the tartness of a Rodenbach, but not quite as good as either. The beer is tilted towards the sweetish side, but has a tartness, some cherry mouthpuckering, and lots of Belgian yeastiness to complement the sweetness. The beer definitely gets more balanced as it warms. Too chilled, and the tartness is just not felt. The beer is complex, has plenty of unique yeast qualities that bring out the sourishness in the otherwise fairly sweet malts. The cherry flavors are also quite complex and run the gamut from mouthpuckering tartness, to slightly sour, to marachino like in their sweetness. There's lots going on in this beer, lots to like, but I prefer a Duchesse or a Rodenbach just a bit more. The Flemish Red style is a real treat. L'Chaim.","albern","Mar 19, 2011"

Very nice lacing and some good retention. Smells very barrely/funky. Some cherry and dried fruit coming through. A little of that sweet Belgian sugar scent and a light spicy yeast smell.

Not much complexity, it just has the same flavor characteristics throughout, with which it beats you. Mouthfeel has a nice slight carbonation & nice slickness, but is a bit thin in the end.

The smell is slightly sweet up front followed by a gentle lactic quality. Funk at the end with horseblanket and ripe cheese aromas. The taste is very nicely balanced with sweet/tart flavors as well as some nice spice/pepper, and some restrained fruit- pear mostly. Some slight funk grows as the beer warms as well. The mouthfeel is very smooth and quite creamy. Great beer. Not quite as tart as some in the style, but this is more than made up for by a nice restrained herbal funkiness on the finish. Best beer of theirs that I've tried in awhile.","Georgiabeer","Jun 06, 2008"

Mildly sour, with an incredibly complex overall flavor profile. I can pick out cherries and granny smith apples. And the brett. The rest remains a mystery. It finishes clean and dry, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. This is a well crafted brew that I could drink anytime or anywhere.

There is some funk foretold by the nose, hints of lemon, and plenty of tart cherry. The taste is funky but not unbalanced. Apple and kriek like cherry come through. Mild sourness and tartness meld nicely with the carbonation to play upon the tongue. Somewhat dusty. Straightforward and not terribly complicated but very well done none the less.

Aroma of oak with some tart note is pretty interesting with some great notes of Brett/funky yeast. Taste is dominated by great oak and tart notes with some sourness which is offset by the funky and barnyard like taste of the yeast. Lots of complexities can be found in this beer.

The flavor is exquisite with its sweet and sour, cherry and berry medley with a little dryness in the flavor to linger for some time in the finish.

On the finish, however, is a very sugary, sweetened fruitiness, that begins after the swallow and is very sweet and cinnamon like. Its very sweet overall, presumably sweetened.

Sweaty, horsey, leafy. This has all the school elements of a good funky flemish sour. On the palate, the brett is as dominating, but the integration is not as efficient. Initially, tart cherries, strawberries and the likes have claims over the earthiness and genuinely evolve into a drying stone-like dryness full of green grapes, but then it hits a wall and every flavor escapes reality. At the same time than the short-flavored nature kicks in, those prickly big bubbles do a last effort to taunt you and expands into a big foam that has nothing worth keeping in your mouth any longer. Solid beer just because its a flemish sour, but just above average compared to other contenders in terms of palate. Spectacular beefy aroma on the other hand.","Rastacouere","Nov 18, 2004"

I've got a few more bottles, so we'll see what I think of it over time. But for now, chalk this up as a fun, somewhat unconventional success.","marburg","0"
