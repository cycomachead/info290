"Had a glass of this at the brewery. Originally started off as my dad’s beer, but after a sip, he couldn't handle the sourness. I didn't mind it. I enjoyed the the very tart cherry flavors and the mild aroma of bourbon and alcohol. Maybe not something I could drink a lot of, but the 8oz I had in my glass was just right."

"Mouth is med bod flemmy mild acidic bite, decent carb."
"O. A good Flanders though a bit one dimensional and over carbonated for the style."

"Cost: $14.99 for a 750 ml bottle."

"O. Pretty good effort - I would like to try a more recent release of this beer."

"Good representation of the style. Not too overwhelming, not too complex and rather refreshing. This is a solid sour that doesn't go overboard in any department and I'm glad to have finally gotten around to trying this one. I heard comparisons to Russian River's Supplication here, but I just don't see it here."

"O) My goodness... This kept my mouth watering for minutes after each sip. Like it was tickling the inside of my mouth... I'd be interested to try this fresh, but I have to say I'm glad I had the restraint to age this, because it was pretty damn good."

"Solid if not one-noted. Tame apricot mouthwatering juice. That's what this should have called it. Thanks TATURBO."

"Overall - Better than I expected. Out of proportion on many flavors, like the wine barrel."

"Really a nice, flavorful cherry-forward Wild Ale. Flanders Red? Eh, not too sure about that."

"O- 6/10 sourness. Good sour, but not very complex. Some sour cherries with a little vinegar and that's about it."
""
"(O)- Excellent drinkability and fits the style very well particularly for an american made one. I had this a few times on tap as well a year or so before this was bottled and the sourness has definitely been kicked up a notch or two since but very happy to see the oak and fruit is still present too. Very much looking forward to seeing what else Central Waters does with their sour program considering this was their first entry essentially."

"Compared to fresh, I've already lost -so- much woody character without gaining funk that I don't want to age the only other bottle of the inaugural batch of Exodus I have for more than a few additional months (just to double-check my single data point of aging results). Also, it is worth repeating that I've aged this one at refrigerator temperature, higher temperatures will have changed faster than this."
"overall: good first effort of the style, not at new glarus level by any means yet"
"On the thinner end of medium bodied with tart, puckering mouthfeel that's slightly acetic but not overly harsh.  Decent barrel character with toasted oak and vanilla followed by tart, vinous dark fruit and acetic vinegary funk.  Slightly lactic with a nice amount of puckering sourness but it's a bit more acetic/solvent like than I prefer.  The dark fruit notes adds some needed sweetness but it could use some more balance."
""
"O: pretty solid beer all around and was glad to finally try a brew from central waters."
""
""
"This is a real good flemish red. Nice and tart with good flavors and aromas."
"The pour is orange with a tall white head. Strong cherry aroma, but also a weird salty note. Some oak, a bit of pineapple, straw, and lemon. The flavor is highly acidic. The cherry character is not quite as pronounced. Mild red wine vinegar, leather, and some citric acidity. Very simnple, but good."
""
""
"Fuller medium body, medium-lighter carb, sticky and lingering on the tongue. A really nice sour beer overall, although the cherry did become a little sweet after a while."
"Feel is at about medium with a great amount of carb that kinda pricks the mouth. Nice lactic sourness with a pucker. I could drink this all night happily. Very drinkable with a low ABV. My hats off to you Central Waters, thanks for sending it over. Send more."

"O: The sourness overpowers the other elements that should be going on (cherries, oak), and the lack of carbonation is detrimental to the mouthfeel and appearance. Other than that, it's not bad at all. Nice first try at sours for CW."
"Poured into a tulip glass, the beer was a murky reddish color. The color was obviously the side-effect of being soaked in the cherries. A sour cherry aroma permeates the air, giving anticipation for the cherry notes to come. The initial taste is a sour cherry flavor that certainly awakens the sour taste buds on the tongue. A mild oak flavor is present with the biscuit notes obvious in observing the texture. The cherries add something to the sour flavor of this beer which continues to the sour finish. Though released in winter, this could easily be an easy drinking, refreshing summer beer."

"Overall: It was a wonderful sour beer by CW. i am always a fan the thier bers and this is no exception! Make some more Exodus Central Waters!"
"O: Just okay, overall. Certainly a noble attempt, but kind of monotonous. Still, I encourage the effort and still adore CW. Keep on plugging, guys. I'll keep on drinking."
""
"Overall this brew is pretty solid. Not anything amazing and a bit underwhelming for me but still not a bad offering."

"O: Absolutely fantastic. One of my favorite sours and its also impressive that this was their first attempt. If you can, GET SOME."
"Got this beer at the occupy the local option event earlier today. Pours a burnt orange color with a bit of white head. It dissipates after a little while leaving little (if any) lacing, and a bit of film and a ring around the glass. Aroma has lots of oak with some nice funk. A bit of fruity berryish aroma as well, and a bit of vinegary acid. Flavor has more oak than in the aroma with lots of fruit, some nice funk and a bit of a vinous, balsamic quality. The oak is almost overwhelming. I would love to put a bottle down for a while to see where that big oak character goes. Mouthfeel is lower carbonation than I would have wanted, but it is dry and light regardless. If it had a touch more carbonation it would have been better."
"In this case, it may have turned out better to not have read the label clearly. Being a fan of Flanders Red, my expectations would have been even higher. However, the beer disappoints the style, but is fine for a try tonight. In the nose, the familiar Door County cherries used famously by New Glarus are clearly there. Clear sour from the trifecta of sour bugs and the oak is there if you look for it. Take a taste and the oak is now out front with a pleasant fruity sourness. Body is thin and seems to fall off the back with little to stop it. Adequate, and my perception of Central Waters has change very little: solid, but rarely stellar."

"O: Well the barrel wasn't really there and the cherries sort of got muted in the flavor. It was a nice take on the flanders, but overall it didn't click."
"Pours a pinkish-red color with minimal amounts of bubbles. The nose is funky and oaky, mildy sour and vinegar cherries. The beer has a punch of vinegar tartness, while managing to be pretty mild and drinkable. The cherries are more tart than they come off as a big cherry flavor. The funk is toned down for sure, and the beer doesn't have a ton of complexity. That said, what it does, it does nicely. Very drinkable, but a bit under-carbonated. This is definitely a solid attempt. Would love to try an aged one down the road. Nice work CW!"
"Nice flanders red from Central Waters. Has a good sour cherry aroma. The taste is a good balance of sour tartness and cherry. A well balanced brew that is like the little brother of the Dissident from Deschutes. I think the recipe could be beefed up a bit with more malt and cherries. The bourbon isn't really there at all, which could also be improved."
"This beer is not dissimilar to my recollections of Rodenbach, which is to say it is overly dominated by sourness for my tastes. On the whole, I think I am biased towards Flanders browns."
"I think this one could be aged, and I wish I had more than 1 bottle."

"D: Very drinkable and very tasty.  A really nice treat to try."

"Light carb, sticky flavors, woody nature. Simple."

"I was lucky enough to get a hold of 2 bottles. This one is obviously not going to make to see tomorrow. The other I have cellared and will let it age gracefully for a year or two before letting it loose."
""
"Overall, a very good sour ale. It could use some aging to bring out more of the brett funk and decrease the sweetness just a little bit and to increase the carbonation but I really do think the flavor is quite good."
""
"EDIT: Bottle 7-3-12. Developing nicely. Much more sour and carbonated."
"O - A few tweaks and this could be an absolutely amazing brew. The sour finish does a great job of tying all the oak and cherries together with the bacteria-filled brew but I'd love to see a little rise in the flavor profile. The bugs are there and offer low underlying complexity, but almost no real malt profile comes though in this one. Regardless, this is damn close to Supplication. Great job guys! I can't wait to age some bottles and experience it's development."

"D: a few points low based on the minimal intake received."
"This beer poured a dark amber/reddish color. It had a very thick off white head that was about 3 fingers tall and lingered for a long time. The smell was very much bourbon, cherries, and a little bit of funk. Taste was surprisingly smooth. Up front was a lot like the smell. A lot of cherries, dark fruit, oak and bourbon. The finish was much lighter and crisp with a lighter fruit (apple, pear) flavor. Mouthfeel was really not what I expected. It was highly carbonated, which was probably why the head was so high, but very light and easily drinkable. I would love to try this again and I would love to see them bottle this one. If you ever get the chance to try it I would highly recommend it."
"The body is medium and carbonation is low. Overall this beer is fantastic and will really surprise people as a superior first sour offering from Central Waters. If you are a fan of oud bruins, this one should be on your radar."
"Draft at the Great Taste. Pours a rust mahagony color with a nicely formed white tan head. The nose is way more sour and tart fruit notes than I expected. CW really have outdone themselves on this one and was a bit surprising to say the least. Some malty type flavors up front followed by the full force hit of the cherries that impart both a sweet and sour/tart taste to the beer. Light mouthfeel. Overall, a fairly good sour that ranks pretty well but still needs a little time to fully develop."
"Overall, a decent sour, but it needs work. Rumors are they might bottle this, which would be pretty cool. Fairly drinkable."
