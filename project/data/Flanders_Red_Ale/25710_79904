4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 8/2018. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, cherry skin, vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, musty funk, light leather, caramel, toast, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of tart cherry, earthy/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of tart cherry, cherry skin, caramel, toast, vinegar, oak, clove, hay, straw, light leather, musty funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, cherry skin, caramel, toast, oak, clove, vinegar, hay, straw, light leather, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of tart/sweet cherry, earthy/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt sweetness; with a good sweetness/tartness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and lightly slick/acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Flanders red ale. All around good balance and complexity of tart cherry, earthy/funky yeast, oak, and dark malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 17, 2014"

Tart, sharp, cherry, oak, water, bits of soil and musk come into the flavor. It's a little watery and carries some one dimensional tartness that seems simple without the complexity I'd expect from a soured beer. Thin with light carb and a dry finish. This is interesting, hopefully there is a solera style coming out of the barrels allowing for further growth and complexity in subsequent batches.","harrymel","Mar 23, 2013"

3.92,0,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O- This was a nice kriek that I definitely enjoyed drinking however I probably would say it's a little bit of a disappointment next to Peche n' Brett and Seizoen Bretta. I thought it was nicely balanced with a nice subtle funk to it. It was a little bit too spritzy and the flavors could have been brought out a little bit more. I'd definitely recommend at least checking out this beer.","jaasen64","Jan 30, 2013"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Served in a tulip. Thanks, Aaron! a bit of cherry. Flavor is mild cherry and light acidity, but not quite up to the level of the rest of Logsdon’s beers. It seems like this was on the right track, just not quite all the way there. Hopefully this gets made again, as I'd love to see the progression in batches of this one.","Thorpe429","Dec 12, 2012"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Beer is grainy / bready with a decent finish but nothing too fruity happening. There is a mild cherry / fruitiness to the finish but overall this is just a saison. Mild peppery notes on the palate as well, hard to detect too much else. I don't think I'd have this again unless it were on draft.","drabmuh","Nov 05, 2012"
4.29,9.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Another excellent beer from Logsdon. Pours very hazy and a somewhat reddish brown in it. Small, dissipating head. The aroma has lots of cherry flavor and funk. Some lemons and a a bit of caramel. Oak. The taste is sourer than expected. Good tartness. There's some caramel malt and cherry sweetness, but it's far from cloying. Some oak tannin in the finish. Very nice beer. Feel is full with some pucker in the finish. I've heard a few people compare it to the NG fruit beers. I think it's sourer and lacks the Belgian fruitiness. At any rate, I'm getting to be a huge fan of Logsdon.","popery","Oct 26, 2012"

4.09,4.3,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a murky reddish-brown with a foamy brown head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some sour cherry and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild sourness and a slightly acidic finish on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and some nice flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Sep 24, 2012"
3.87,-1.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Very interesting beer as the brett and cherry fight for control. I would have preferred a touch less brett since it got a bit overpowering as it warmed, but a unique experience nonetheless.","jmarsh123","Sep 21, 2012"

3.85,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Other comments: This is highly carbonated. When I uncapped it, it immediately erupted and I lost a few ounces to the kitchen counter. This has happened with a bottle of Seizoen Bretta, too. I know they prime their beers with pear juice, so maybe that's giving some erratic results?","GreenCard","0"
