"Cherry brown with etched light tan foam. Smells like stilton cheese, oak, some pie cherry, really not taking much on the nose here personally. As it warms, it kinda reminds me of cherry jolly rancher smell. Flavor is lightly tart with rich acetic character, lightly sweet and a good bit of oak. Thin with light, ticklish carb and a dry finish. Overall the beer is really drinkable, as it warms, it is really inviting as a beverage, makes me wish I were sitting in a lush leather chair at fireside."

"Overall – One of the better Flanders I’ve had. Sadly, the more I have this style the more I realize I don’t particularly like it. With the beer having heavier funk and oak, and it being less sweet than other Flanders, it makes this an enjoyable beer overall. Glad I was able to try this!"

"mouthfeel - sticky, decent carbonation after all. interesting body. sugary"
"Bottle. Batch 10, bottle 652. Pours a clear copper color with a collared white head. Not too much different than the regular version but just a little ""cleaner"". Cherry, light sour, and some mild oak. Littler sour fruit notes. Some alcohol notes come through on this one. Overall, more mellow than the regular version. Not too bad."
"D - Enjoyable in slow sips before a meal or with a nice cheese; develops some unique flavor characteristics as it warms up; a must try for those sour beer lovers"
"O - Quality sour brew, nice take on the FRA, with this one one the smokey, dry, sour side."
"O - I like this beer as an easy drinker with some unique flavors. Would do it again, other than it is quite pricey."
"Poured a dark reddish-brown with a good amount of carbonation, and a small whitish head that receded to a wispy layer. Aroma of sour cherries, red wine and brandy, with some grassy notes. Tart taste of cherries and grapes up front, with a sense of spices present. Malty base, with caramel noticeable, and a very woody quality, almost earthy, with a touch of barnyard funk. Medium mouthfeel, pretty strong, and a nice drink."
"Nice oak presence... with just the right amount of sour. This is the most balanced sour I have ever had. the finish leaves no sour behind, while the front assaults the sour taste buds. very impressive."
"D- this is a pretty easy drinking 8% sour. the glass went down with ease, but i think that like $23 is a little much for this."
"Overall, I am very impressed with this beer. The abv is hidden, the sour flavors are very refined and pleasant with nothing coming close to overwhelming or even dominant. This is easily the best Flanders Red that I have ever had. The Price tag is close to $20 but this is one of the few beers that are worth it. I mentioned fruit numerous times in the review and I do not believe that fruit was actually added."
"Flat out amazing beer. Even though it's a little expensive, it's well worth it. I will pick this beer up every time I see it from now on. Great sour!"
"'RISERVA' version - aged 15 months in Bordeaux casks instead of 3, or something. Pours a fairly clear deep brownish read with a nice soapy beige head. Nose is lovely - cherries, brett, wet wood, just a rich, lovely nose. Much softer and more delicate in the mouth than its younger counterpart. Very well integrated mouth of brett, wood, and wine, with a dose of mildly sour cherries and a tiny bit of aged balsamic. Soft carbonation, lush mouthfeel. Way better than the regular Panil primarily through the lack of acetone."
"D - Great sour fruity flavor throughout with a full oak finish. Aroma is very inviting but a little more vinegar than wanted. Nice smooth and clean mouthfeel. Easy drinker."
"I wasn't a huge Panil fan the first time, this dind't really improved anything to me, if anything brings out more cognac than I'd care for."
"Density and fullness of flavor make it slightly less refreshing than many other sours, but for the flanders style, this one is a stand out as excellent. Easy to drink, but mildly filling. Excellent in funk and depth of character."
"D - This was pretty terrific stuff. If you like Rodenbach at all, then you'll dig this one. Very drinkable, as my wife and I killed a 750ml bottle with no troubles. Wish it weren't so dang expensive."
