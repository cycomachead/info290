3.81,4.4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"i liked this one quite a lot, a different take on the style. almost none of the vinegar side sour in it, much more funk than anything else, but its also thick and sort of sweet, with a curious finish. murky brick red in color with a nice off white head, it looks the part for sure. the nose on it has a little pucker, but more woody weirdness than acidity. the flavor is complex, showing the best of the red malts, the wood barrels, and dried fruit notes ranging from cherry to cranberry. the finish is what makes this different i think, instead of thinning body and climaxing acidity, it sort of mellows on the sour front, moves into a sweet nutty profile, and the weight of the body sets in, its thick beer. its cool and different in the style, i get almond and even coconut in there late, and the decent carbonation barley cuts the density. a pleasing beverage, nice and low in abv, and really unique in the way it concludes.","StonedTrippin","Jul 27, 2014"

4.03,10.4,4,4,4,4.25,4,"On the fuller end of medium body with tart acidity and slight acetic vinegar followed by sweet vinous fruit and slightly roasted dark malt.  Some dryness, possibly from the oak, meshes with acetic acid, earthy funk and dry, bretty bugs.  The acidity and funk are countered by dark fruit sweetness and subtle malt flavors.  Hints of raspberry, sour cherry, grape and plum compliment the acetic quality while providing some needed balance to the dry oak and musty funk.  Nicely balanced with good sourness and subtle funk.  Easy to drink with little to no harshness.  I haven't had this beer fresh but it has held up nicely and is better than some of the other reviews indicate.","corby112","Jan 27, 2013"

3.3,-9.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"O: this Flanders red sits in a limbo between puckering tartness and fruity sweetness, the result is rather mild and falls short of many other in the style","homebrew311","0"
3.9,6.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a dark, murky amber red with a thin quickly dissipating foamy off white head. Strong, potent aroma of cherries, vinegar, oak, mild brett, dark fruit and slight funk. Tart cherry throughout the flavor, with an oak presence in the front of the palate and dry, vinegar sourness through the finish with some vanilla. Slightly thicker than expected, with light carbonation. Not a great Flanders, but a pleasant treat that shows up on tap at Iron Hill more often than their other sours or BA experiments.","yourefragile","Jan 01, 2012"

3,-17.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"O: While I will admit I'm not an expert on the style, I have had a few Flemish Reds and, IMO, this one does not make the mark. The sourness is simultaneously subdued and not substantial enough while being mildly offensive and dirty tasting.","Florida9","Nov 28, 2011"

3.75,2.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"According to the silver-marker scrawl on the label, this is bottle #37 (of question mark), and it's dated 9/25/10. There's more, but I can't make it out. Anyway, the stuff inside pours a mostly clear russet-garnet topped by a short-lived finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises tart cherry, light vinegar, light pomegranate, brown sugar, and a backbone of sweet caramel. The taste holds notes of light caramel, light cranberry, tart malt vinegar, light tomato, and a touch of Swiss cheese. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall, a pretty solid Flemish red and a nice drinker as well.","TMoney2591","Nov 15, 2011"

3.65,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"While this was certainly an easy drinking and approachable take on a Flemish Red, it seemed like the depth of flavor that they were shooting for with this just seemed to struggle to come out at times. This was maybe a bit too rich with the fruity tartness, which helped cover up some of the little nuances that I think would have taken this to the next level. Still, this is a good one to introduce the style to somebody with.","Kegatron","May 15, 2011"
3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O - I really enjoyed this one but it left me wanting a bit more. I think a bit of time in the bottle would do this one wonders. I hope to try this one again in the future.","orangesol","May 04, 2011"
3.77,3.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D - It's a pretty enjoyable and easy-to-drink Flanders Red. There are some minor issues, particularly the aftertaste, but all-in-all it's an above-average take on the style. I'd rather have a La Folie, but that didn't prevent me from going for multiple refills of this one.","MasterSki","May 01, 2011"

4.49,23,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5," The wonderful red fruit notes are up front in the taste with a bit of tangy cherry and just enough tart cranberry with slight acidic and gently spicy taste with moderately high vanilla from the oak able to blend with the belgian yeast and hops which are spot on. I really enjoyed this -so tasty and was one of the best of this style I have had next to Ommegang Rouge -Kudos Paul!","Slatetank","Apr 05, 2011"

3,-17.8,2,2,3.5,3,3.5,"Taste is a bit vinegery, but definitely has that flanders red taste to it. Some nice tart cherry... but not much else. Disappointing. I think more carbonation would help the flavor profile... but as it is, there just isn't much to it. Easy to drink despite the complaints though.","crusian","May 17, 2010"
3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"On tap at the North Wales location. Not sure where it was brewed. Not sure if this entry refers to the ""Flanders Red," as indicated on the Iron Hill menu. Pleasant, subdued aroma of oak, dark fruits, and cherries. Beautiful lacing. Nice balanced feel, alot of red wine, plums, and all that, a little balsamic vinegar, but not too much. Better than Rodenbach Grand Cru IMO in that regard. Soft and gentle, nice feel, good sour cherry tones, nice.","JAXSON","Jan 28, 2007"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a reddish-brown color with a khaki head. The aroma is oak, dark fruit and caramel malt. The flavor is semi-tart, cherries, oak and vanilla. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice American-made sour beer and another good one from Iron Hill.","Mora2000","Apr 11, 2006"
3.97,8.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Sampled at the Iron Hill, Belgium Comes to West Chester event. The beer poured a deep red color with a slight pink head. The nose had a sour funkiness to it, tart, good. The taste had a malty caramel character to it with a nice sour cherry tartness to round it out. The mouthfeel is nice and tart but not to the extent of the Belgian representations of this style. Overall a nice rendition of the style.","ggaughan","Beers"
3.53,-3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is funky with some tartness and that weird rubber beach ball stuff coming through. Not bad but not totally true to the style...albeit a difficult style to replicate in the states.","weeare138","0"
