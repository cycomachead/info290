"I'll admit I'm still working on understanding and appreciating the differences between  the various sour styles.  I'm not sure how much blending has gone on in this beer as there are qualities that make it seem more fresh than not.  OTOH not all of it seems that way.  The lingering flavor seems unique to this beer.  I think I like it."

"Creamy smooth feel, tart crabapple acidity, tannic cherry skins. Even level of carb, drying finish. Very well integrated, not overly sour, perfect for a Flanders lover."

"Overall, this style is something entirely new to me, but after my first one, I'm hungry for more. It's rauchbiers all over again..."

"It's does really well for the style in the aroma and flavor category. With a little more carbonation it could have been much better. The price tag is still a little outrageous, though."

"M: Medium bodied because of low carbonation."

"O- A great sour from Evolution and very well balanced. I really hope I am able to find another bottle. The best beer I have had from Evolution."
"Muddy chestnut brown. Decent hiss when opened but pours very still with no head and no lacing. Apple and somewhat cidery aroma. Brett. Wonderful tart and somewhat sour flavors. Nice balance with the oak. Faint dried cherry flavors. The mouthfeel is really great-very smooth and almsot creamy. I was really expecting something a lot thinner. Very enjoyable and drinkable. Once again my local brewery kicks butt!"
"I admitedly love this brewery, but was not prepared for this. You will not find a more enjoyable and rewarding Flanders red-style beer."
