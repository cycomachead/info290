"This is a very good ale, particularly for the price - I see a case of it in my future.  The sourness is superb, just tart enough to be enjoyable but not vinegary.   The fruitiness of the blended ales comes through, as does some oakiness from the aging vats, but the vanillin is low."

"Received this in a beer of the month club - I will freely admit I am completely new to drinking beer of this style. The beer is a mixed ale - 75% ""young"" with 25% aged in oak barrels. The smell was very fruity and floral, almost smelling more like wine than beer. I've tried a ton of stuff from american craft breweries and liked many of them, but I can honestly say I've never had anything like this one from Belgium. The flavor of the beer is a bit tart at first but that quickly fades to more complex flavors of the malt and hops. The finish is clean and refreshing. Really blown away and ready for more true Belgian style beers."
