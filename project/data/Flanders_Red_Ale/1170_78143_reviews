"This had the perfect balance of tart and sweet."
""
"O - This is a sour from Upland I can unequivocally get behind.  Takes the classic Flanders red and turns it to 11, but without destroying the fundamental qualities of the original.  Big, fat sour notes, fruits and oak, this is as epic as its name suggests.  Excellent."

"Dark ruby color with tan head that lingered.  Lots of lingering lacing as well.  Aromas of oak, sour fruit (guessing cherries?) with more sour notes.  Tastes much the same.  Sour cherry with overtones of oak and acidic flavors.  Little touch of vanilla maybe.  Bourbon.  Very complex and balanced.  Drinkable.  Moderate carbonation.  ABV hidden extremely well.  Kind of beer that can sneak up and knock you out.  This was aged about 6 months and it was very smooth."

"Overall, this is a very good beer. The whiskey barrel aging adds a dimension to this beer that most Flanders do not have. The barrel warmth and whiskey flavors mellow what would otherwise be a very sour beer to make a more drinkable end product."

"Wow what a tasty Flanders red. Pours reddish brown with a light head...this is a sour though. Good carb and a great tart sour upfront but has that clear belgian aftertaste. Lovely full body as well and the bourbon aroma and nose is excellent. Solid solid beer. Aftertaste is probably the only place I'd be a critic"

"This was a bottle from 2010. It tasted as if the sour had gone away and started to come back around. Very well-balanced beer that is worth the patience. Thoroughly enjoyed!"

"O: Extremely smooth and mellow. Very impressed, age has done this well. Very delicious. Thanks again, Mark!"

"O: 4.25 my favorite sour to date. A great blend of flavors brings this one together very nicely."
""
""
"O: Overall this is a very solid Flanders Red Ale. The list is short in this category which is one of my favorites that I like is much. Rodenbach, Red Poppy , Oude Tart. I have no idea where the 10.5% is hiding and I seriously doubt that it is actually up there that high... This went above and beyond my expectations. Another winner from Upland"

"O- A really nice Flemish-red-ish beer, the subtle fruit and barrel flavors are great. This was my first sour from Upland and was very impressed."

"4.25 D: It's not packing a whole lot in the sourness category, but it tastes great and if it wasn't so expensive or hard to get, you could drink it all night and be quite happy."

""
"Thanks, duels, for the opportunity"
"O-The best Upland sour I've had so far. Perfectly balanced, a tad more carbonation would make this a lot better. Although they might have to change the name due to some lawyer-y stuff."

"The ale was poured into a sampler glass and was a darkish ruby red in appearance. It produced a head that was off-white in appearance. The initial taste was sour but not overly vinegary. Some Flanders ales make me feel like I am drinking a bottle of Worchester sauce. The acidity did not take away from the taste. Tart berry notes balance the acidity nicely. As the ale moved toward the aftertaste, one detects a hint of woodiness from barrel aging. Tart to the finish, the mouthfeel gave it a little staying power and even allowed for a mild warming sensation."
""
"Overall: This was a treat to try. It was sweeter than I usually like my sours, but it seemed to work well here."
""
""
"D - This is much better than the bottle I tried at FoBAB a year back. I also liked this a bit better than the Green Flash effort, which was also a Flanders-type beer aged in bourbon barrels. Really sneaky with the booze, which is dangerous as this goes down quite easily."
""
""
"Medium body, upper level carbonation, somehow juicy and dry on the tongue with a lasting finish. I'm a fan of aging sour ales in bourbon barrels, and Upland really nailed this one. I'd definitely be interested in finding another bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Very nice flanders but not my favorite."
""
""
""
""

"Nice beer. The sourness level is stronger than the fruit lambics from Upland and the bourbon barrels add some nice depth."
"I've opened three bottles of this (one roughly 6 months ago, another 3 months ago, and another last night). Each bottle has gotten progressively better (and more sour). This one still might not even be at its peak yet. Exciting stuff!"
""
""
"o - overall very tart sour cherries. nice flanders, but very much on the sour end of the spectrum."
"M: Slippery and slick, subdued acidity. Very nicely balanced for 10.5% abv"
""
"A top-of-the-line beer... be sure of it. Not the best, but pretty damn impressive. It ranks high amongst the style. A bourbon-barrel aged Flanders Red. How can I not recommend it?"
"I can’t think of anything to compare this one to but I’m loving it, very interesting brew that’s worth seeking out"
""

"This was a bitch to open - required the lobster claw cracker to pull the cork - but it cam with a loud pop. Pours a brown ale with cherry hues and a good broken sheet of light cream foam. Smells of sweet balsamics, some brown sugar and some oak. There is the vinegar tone, indicating the tart quality, but the nose lacks depth for me. Flavor has a nice tartness, cherries, oak, hint of bourbon, slightly bitter, and a hint of sweetness. I like the balance in this one. Medium bodied with lower carb and a dry finish. Nice beer, the nose does not match the flavor, but it is a nice beer."
"O - This Flanders resides on the sweeter side but has enough tartness to allow it to be called a sour. The cherry is definitely the prominent flavor with the oak and lemon adding a level of complexity. Very approachable and would be a nice introduction into sours."
""

"Bottle split amongst a few friends. Excited to try a sour style beer from Upland. It pours a red-orange color with haziness. The nose of it contains red wine, vinegar, cherry and sugar. A very interesting beer so far. It tastes nice, a mix of sour, bourbon, cherry, good mix of flavors. Mouthfeel is medium, acidic to be sure, leaves you with a bit of sour face. A very good beer that is worth your time."
"O: really good flanders brew and was glad to have been able to try a bourbon barreled flanders."
"Light to medium body with a soft carbonation that tickles the tongue. An interesting take on the style, with the alcohol very well hidden. Flavors aren't too bold though."
""
""
""
"A great sour. Wasn't sure what to expect from the barrel aging, but it adds a nice, subtle component. Very well done."
""
""
"Pours a rather dark red/amber color without much in the way of head formation (or carbonation). A bit more bourbon and vanilla than expected. Some definite acetic qualities with some red wine vinegar and dark fruits. A little caramel sweetness, too. Like the nose, sweet toffee/caramel and barrel notes (bourbon and vanilla). The sourness picks up as it warms and the vinegar is able to come through."
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, batch date of 9-11 stamped on the back label. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a murky reddish/amber color with an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice, it smells like vinegar, tart and sweet cherries, wood, green sour apples, funk and a bit of vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma. It tastes like tart and sweet cherries, vinegar, lemon peel, funk, wood, vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon flavor isn't strong in this brew at all, but I think the subtle bourbon taste works well with the tartness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and slick with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a pretty nice overall brew. Yeah, it was $24.99 a bottle, but after drinking it I don't feel like I paid too much for it. Good thing I bought 2 bottles!"
"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by myself! A massive thanks goes out to my boy aasher for sending me this one as a part of a get well back after I first returned to work and was fighting my literally through physical therapy! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a ruby red orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cherry, tart, and subtle funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, cherry, tart, sour, wood, cherry, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I really enjoyed this one as a nice followup to the 50/50 Eclipses we had previously. It did a nice job of cleansing the palate and still shining through with all its glory. The flavor was my favorite part as it was quite complex and very well balance. A definite must try regardless if you have done so or not."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some woody and slight vinegar aromas. Taste is much the same with a woody and acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I am not getting any hints of bourbon in the aroma or taste."

"4, 4, 4, 4, 4"
""
"D - Good stuff, the complexity seemed to improve as I moved through this one and the backend/aftertaste here is quite good."
""
"Top notch craftsmanship, though I'd expect nothing less from an Upland Reserve beer. Wish I had another bottle :("
""
"O: Overall a pretty good beer. Definitely fills the sour void in my life. Tart, complex, and totally delicious."
""
""
"Overall: Another really good sour by Upland. Only had a few flanders red, but I do enjoy the beer style."
""
""
"Very tasty flemish red, although I'm not picking up a lot if barrel notes. Worth a try. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT!"
""
"The beer pours a light brown color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of toffee and caramel malt, as well as some tart cherries and oak notes. The flavor is similar, with some lightly tart cherries, oak, leather and vanilla. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall, this is a great Flanders-style ale and tremendous sour. The fact that the bourbon barrels used to treat this beer were previously used for another brew shows, as I had a hard time finding any bourbon notes. The faint vanilla and overall ""woodiness"" seem to be the dominant contributions from the barrel treatment. Ultimately, I would love to have this again, and would say it’s worth the effort to seek out."
""
""
"O: Ah, that bourbon barrel aging does a world of good for this beer; it mellows out an already super-sour beer. And because of that, this is one of the best Flanders ales I’ve ever had. What every brewer should aspire to when it comes to sour beer. Definitely worth the money – in fact, I think I’ll go buy another."
""
""
"O - A nice take on the Flanders style. I was surprised to learn that this was aged in bourbon barrels for a year. The bourbon notes are very tame, but they do mesh well with the softness of the bugs and the tartness of the cherries. Very good wild ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I liked this one a lot. The nose has a very nice mix of bourbon and sour dark fruits, whilt eh taste is funkier and sourer, which I love. One of the better Upland sours so far and pretty interesting, glad I have another bottle of it."
"Overall, a decent flanders, but nothing too crazy. Enjoyable, however."

"Drink- I enjoyed this beer a lot. The grand scale of the flavors and the combination of layers was well integrated and the final product shows that. A very large ABV but as mentioned well hidden. A good beer to share with a good drinking buddy. A well done style that isn't normally done in the States. Good to see a craft brewer in America taking a shot. I would love another bottle to sit on but the experience was good for me."

"This beer is perfect by itself, but it would compliment a cherry sauce braised pork chop like nobody's business. My next bottle is on the menu! Can't wait. Again, Upland - incredibly impressive. You nailed this beer, and you nailed the style. Legit Flanders Reds in Indiana! Who'dathunkit?!"
"The beer is brown to ruby hued with an off white head that leaves sparse lacing in its wake. The aroma offers fruit, particularly cherries, oak, and a healthy dose of booze. Powerful flavor, with a strong showing from both the booze and fruit. Plenty of tartness and a bold acetic finish. Impressive. This exceeded my expectations. Would be very happy to try this one again. Recommended."
"Overall:  This is a fine representation of the style but a little expensive.  The bourbon isn't very noticeable so perhaps the base beer was stronger than I anticipated.  This is a nice beer to try but for $25 it's a little expensive for what it is.  If you're a big fan of the style, this is a must try.  4.5/5"
"Overall this was a very well rounded beer and a nice take on the style but didn't wow me like others of the style. I don't feel the bourbon added enough flavor here to be called a Bourbon Barrel aged Flanders red. Maybe not enough contact time or the base beer was too big or the bugs are still slowly eating away at the sweet bourbony flavors, who knows. Good but not exactly what I was hoping for."
"O - I'm a fan of this beer. I think some age will do this one some good and smooth the booze out further, which would be nice. Looking forward to trying this again in 6 months or so. If you like Red Poppy and want some more alcohol in there, this beer is for you."

"Beer is medium to light in body, mildly sweet and liquor on the front portion of the palate nad the finish is lactic, succinic, and acetic with a little brightness there. Nice beer overall, hard for me to put this in the ""Flanders Red"" box with the forward palate but a good beer none-the-less."
""
"Overall: good upland offering, they keep getting better and better."
"Medium body with a slight bit of booze, but not nearly that 10.5% that is listed. Good acidity coming through after a medium body that created a nice malt base. Perhaps my favorite Upland sour to date."
""
""
"O: An excellent example of the style. Blows away Marron Acidifie for sure and I'd venture to say I like it better than Oerbier Riserva!"
""
"I love flanders reds and the bourbon adds a unique twist to this classic. I was afraid the bourbon would be overpowering, but it really is delicate and subtle making it work."
""
""
"O - For me, this is the best beer Upland has pushed out. I personally love this style and I really think they nailed it. The flavors expected for the style are on point. The finish is great. I actually think the back end of the flavor is what sets this apart from other Flanders Red. This instantly stormed into the top 3 for the style in my book."
