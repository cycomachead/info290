"More complex and almost creamy, not as sharply sour as most. But not as fruity as the Kriek. Loved it."
""

"Slightly mad at the lose of one of my nice tasting glasses in the process of this beer. However, that happen, and once the carbonation calms a bit this is an enjoyable flemish ale, quite a bit of acidy but also high on the sweetness so it balances well. Lots of character, very refreshing with the tartness. Smooth bodied and a nice balance between the yeast and the malt, really pleasant and easy to drink."
"Overall really gross. Rough and vinegary, dark fruits, more vinegar. Bad off-flavors."
""
""
"Usual vinnegar taste, along with red vine, cherry, plums etc., but it's sweeter than Rodenbach Grand Cru and Duchesse. I'd say it's Flanders Red for those which are not accustomed to sour beers."
""

"Sweet and sour. And savory. Like a sauce. Weirdly void of depth – mostly tastes of sherry vinegar and grape jelly. Nicely carbonated sherry vinegar and grape jelly. As far as Flemish reds go, this is pretty far down my list, but it's still drinkable and has some good flavors. It just lacks the depth of something like Rodenbach GC or Duchesse. Possible drinks pairings: carbonnade (cook with it!), tapas, sheep's cheese, spiced lamb, kidneys."

"O: Tasty but too much sweet. Still good and enjoyable, but not the best of its style."

"Funkier and not as sweet as Duchesse.  Pours a brown edged ruby with one finger thick tan colored head. Dense half inch cap remains.  Smell: green apple, date bread, barnyard funk, sour peach, with herbal and vanilla-ish oaky notes.  Taste: dried cherries and stone fruit with brown sugar note, then growing acid with grape and peach skin, finishing with green apple candy and oak contributions.  Light-medium bodied, relaxed carbonation well suited to the experience. Best by 2/2015. Excellent!"

"This was tasty, not one of the extremely sour Flanders reds, but a bit sweeter."
""
""
""
""
"Very nice Flemish sour. Auburn in color with a little bit of an effervescent tan head. Smells of cherries, oak, and rubber cement. The taste follows the nose but is a bit sweeter than I expected. There is plenty of dark cherry, acetic acid, a bit of oak, a little bit of maraschino cherries. A bit of a medicinal quality because of the sweetness? Rubber cement(which is good). A bit too sweet for my tastes, but still quite enjoyable."

"O: mellow sour ale that is solid. Smooth. I will purchase again. Yum."

"Mild Flanders Red Ale, refreshing and pleasant to drink. Not at par of Duchesse and Rodenbach, a bit sweet a less funky acid, but still pretty decent and easy to drink. Good bridge to these territories."

"Every once in a while you try a beer and you know you may have to try it again sometime to see if your first experience was a fluke. This beer was like that because I can't possibly imagine that it was intended to taste like this. It HAD to have been a beer that went bad during the bottling process, during shipping to the U.S., or some infernal combination of the aforementioned scenarios compounded by a disgruntled employee of the brewery taking a piss in the batch. First of all, I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to smell like sour vinegar and taste pretty much the same. Out of stubbornness, I continued to force it down and finally gave up at the half-way point before I poured it down the sink. It only got worse from there, because the next 24 hours can only be described as something akin to galloping dysentery. I'm not kidding or trying to be clever-- this beer truly made me sick. I don't know, maybe explosive diarrhea is some trendy new experience with imports and I'm just too much of an uncultured barbarian to appreciate the finer nuances of such a gift. Some day I may try another, but for the moment, this brewery and the vendor I bought it from owe me a serious apology."

"Beautiful burgundy red colour with alost no foam at all. Nice balance between the sourness of a flemish red and a sweet fruitiness (cherry, strawberry ??). Almost tastes like a lambic beer, it is much fruitier than other flemish red I have drank so far. First time I drank this one, but I love it !!"

"O - This wont wow you, but its a session able FOB"
""
"Pours super dark red with a small head. Hints of tart black cherry and vinegar on the nose. Beautiful flavor of black cherries, nice tartness and clean finish. Very easy drinking and quite yummy. Carbonation makes it feel light on the palate. My second from Verhaeghe and have been impressed by both, but this one is better than the Kriek for me."

"O - this is my least favorite Flanders so far. Very dull and unimpressive for the style."
""
""
""
""

""

"Less fruity than the nose might indicate. Some sweet cherry flavor at the beginning, which transforms into a sour finish. Light cinammon flavor and again wine taste, Body is light to medium. Overall an nice refreshing beer."
"Mouthfeel- Nice tartness and bubbles on the mouth to add complexity."
""
""
""
""
"3/c = average"
""
"Overall, a nice example of the style. I prefer these beers with a little more acidity, especially on the finish. This one exits down your throat on more of a sweet note. Still, it is very pleasant to drink."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of tartness, slight sweet malt, hint of fruit, and slight sour notes. Fits the style of a Flanders Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight sour notes, slight fruit, hint of yeast, and hint of hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"a very interesting beer. it pours a clear medium shade of brown, with a one inch off white head comprised of pretty large bubbles. it smells a lot darker than it looks, plenty of roast on the malts, a lot of sweetness, and some definite sour vibes. the flavor is exactly that, sweet at first, sour in the finish. the sweet is complex, brown sugar or molasses, with something a little floral, maybe honey. the sour is more vinegar than brett, but isnt offputting at all. the mouthfeel is good, lighter than it looks this time, with only about a medium body and effervescent carbonation. overall a nice flanders style brew, but probably wont pay 6 bucks for a bottle again."
""

"Overall: pretty solid Flanders red. A bit on the sweet side, but still good."
"Vichtenaarpours a deep, dark mahogany, with plentiful ruby highlights. About two fingers or so of off white foam crown the beer. Head retention is fairly solid, and a decent amount of lacing is left clinging to the side of the glass. The nose has a healthy proportion of sweet cherry/dark fruits, offset only by a little bit of a tart aroma. The flavor profile is again dominated by sweet cherries. There's a little bit of a sour presence as well, and a slight oaky note that's barely perceptible. All in all the taste somewhat reminds me of a cherry cola, which isn't necessarily what I'm looking for for this style. It's all fruit and artificial sweetness, with very little acidity or wood notes to balance things out. The body was a little bit full, and the carbonation a little bit dull, but neither were too far off the mark. I guess I was spoiled, with my first Flanders Red being from Rodenbach. In comparison, Vichtenaar tastes like it's been backsweetened, and it has none of the depth or complexity of the best versions of the style."
""
""
""
"O: Definitely on the sweet side of sour, dark fruit and pears dominate the flavour profile, which makes it quite drinkable."
""
"Carbonation is lively and nippy while not biting, but does make it both crisp and smooth."
""
""
"O - I liked this one quite a bit. There are better ones out there in my opinion, but I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Will drink again"
""
""
"Overall this is a total ambush beer, and I am really enjoying it."

"Wanted to have tasted this Flanders Red for awhile. I'll know to decant next time. A tasty and almost fulfilling example. Certainly worth a revisit. 4.0"
""
""
"Enjoyed by wine friends."
""
""
"Okay, I'll come right out and say it: if you're a big, ""sour"" fan, this will not be for you. If you are looking for a stepping stone, step right on this one. It's a gateway Flemish red/brown, but if you've already got the bug, you can skip this one."

"pours a ruby color. Smell is a little like vinegar but with some sweetness. Taste is like a red vinegar but with sweetness and malt, really wonder how they get it that close to vinegar but does not go over the top. The mouthfeel is exceptional. It has become a new favorite when I am eating spicy foods. I am a fan and I really do not like sour beers."
"Overall Impression- A very nice Flanders Red! There was never too much sourness or cherry flavor and so this one was easy drinking and I could definitely present this one to anyone of my friends. I could have had another one to see if there was any difference in complexity or flavors. Go for it if in stores! I would like to see how much this one really costs at the retail price."
"O-plug your nose and drink. its okay but not good enough to justify the price tag. the funny thing is, i chose this beer because it was the cheapest ""sour"" i could find at the bar i was at. taught me a lesson to not save money. it becomes more and more simple as i drink it. not enough sourness to it. not a pain to finish though."
"Delicious as a treat by itself. Not sure I'd serve it with any food other than a sweet dessert. A little steep at $8 a bottle, but then again I ordered it at a bar and did not get it off a store shelf."
"This is really about as drinkable as one of these beers gets. It has all the right qualities and, while it could use more of a sour bite, the way it is makes it tasty and really easy to drink for the style."
"Vichtenaar may not be the best interpretation going around, but it's certainly the most enjoyable FRA i've had the pleasure of drinking."
"O- A mediocre beer, although I can't fairly say if this is because of the brew itself or because it's past expiration. A bit too sweet for my liking, I would have liked to see the sour notes picked up in the nose more developed in the taste. Next time I'm craving a Flemish Red I'll probably go with Rodenbach Grand Cru or Duchesse de Bourgogne instead."
"O: I was disappointed to discover just how old this beer was. Hopefully a fresher example will show better than this did."
"The beer is ruby and brown hued, with a thin, wispy head that leaves virtually no lacing. The aroma sends off alarm signals upon the initial whiff. Sweet cherries, alcohol, and an acetone-like off scent. The flavor is equally disappointing. No lactic, sour, barrel, funk notes, or anything pleasant for that matter. The beer was too sweet, and basically a mess. Not a good example of a Flanders red ale, a style of which I am particularly fond."
"O: One of the better Flanders brews I've come across yet. Unlike the Duchess, this brew exhibits a harmonious interaction between sweet and sour, with each complementing the other's characteristics. Great brew!"
"o - Overall not that great of a flanders red ale. The nose and taste are way too sweet, and neither have much sourness or tartness to it. Wouldn't seek out again."
"Overall - I'm not the best judge of this style, but it's certainly better than other versions I have had. The sweetness is just barely enough without becoming overpowering. Not overly sour, just tart."
"Overall: This is a very tasty Flander's Red that held up to the age beautifully. It's a bit on the sweet side for the style, but still very tart and a bit sour. Tasty stuff!"
"Pours a murky reddish-brown color with a thin head that has a light bit of red tint to it. The nose is really strange. There's some acetic acid and oak, along with a really creamy character. While appropriate, it's too heavy and goes off in the wrong direction, reminding me a bit of a tequila creaminess. Flavor has the same issues. Oak and a bit of cherry, but then there's an off creamy character to it. No real malt or oak influence, and the sourness is kept very small. Medium body. Really a strange beer and not one that I particularly enjoyed."
"One of the first Flemish Red's I had ever tried. This beer was a very nice ruby red color which was very inviting. The flavor is on the sweeter side and not as sour as expected. The Oak aging really dominates the finish of the beer to me. I'd like to try this one again in the future."
"Overall, it's pretty average. A nice tartness, but a lack of any real sour elements that you should be looking for in a FRA IMO. Worth a try, anyways."
"Pretty easy to drink, very inricate."
"Drinkability -- Pretty good. Definitely worth choosing over Duchesse De Bourgogne, the brewery's better known Flanders Red."
"D: The good balance of sweet and sour flavors in the taste makes this beer very easy to consume."
"Not the most complex example of the style I've had, but very enjoyable. A good ""every-day"" Flanders red, easy drinker."
"D - The highly sweet aftertaste is keeping me from wanting more. The vinegar has an unusual tinge to it, which will also keep me from reaching for more."
"D: I found this a hair mellow for a flemish, but enjoyed nonetheless. Need to pick up a couple more bottles and age 'em to see if the tart grows on me. Worth a go ahead."
"Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured reddish-brown (similar to tea) with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and sour funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, and subtle fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. Really glad that Ed at The Community Tap suggested that I give this one a little while back. Very nicely balanced flavor and good aroma without doubt. Actually mine and my buddies second favorite brew out of all the sours we had this past weekend. A must try for any sour fan out there without a doubt."
"Decent carbonation and body. Overall this is OK but not worth the $5+ for an 11.2oz bottle."
"This brew reminds me of Russian River Consecration, but in a much, much milder form."
"Mouthfeel on the lighter side of medium, carbonation is medium-to-high. Gentle on the palate and refreshing but still full-flavored. I could drink this any time of the day. Probably a great breakfast beer with omelette and sausage or something. Need more."
"D- Great clean depth, fresh and fruity, crisp with a tart drying finish, fantastic beer."
"Mouthfeel seems perfect for this beer, and seems to change in the mouth, thin initially, than begins to feel like it coats the mouth, only to be cleansed by the sour finish, that creates a lingering burn on the tongue."
"This is an excellently flavored dessert beer."
"Bottle. $3.99 for a 11.2oz bottle. Best before: 19-09-10. Pours a nice looking dark reddish brown color with a fluffy tan head. The aroma is of sweet, sour fruit, cherries and raisins. Very sweet me thinks upon the first sip. Mildly sour and tart and ends rather sugary. Minimal aftertaste of alcohol, like cough syrup. Medium mouthfeel, thought it would be a little lighter. Not a bad beer but not very sour nor did it have a very strong oak taste for being lagered for 8 months."
"D - If vinegar is your thing then this bottle was for you. Pretty sure I just got a bad bottle as I have had this style before and none were nearly as vinegary."
"One has to have the taste buds for the style of beer. NOT a beer for the non belgain yeast and oak aged, red wine lover."
"There will always be a sweet spot in my heart for this beer as it's one that I cracked my tooth on in the world of better beer. With that said there is better out there style wise. It's low abv but the taste does not make me want top grab a bottle any time soon."
"Cannot believe I am just getting around to reviewing this...Beautiful tawny pour with a nice beige head. Beutiful presentation in my chouffe tulip. Malty sweet sour smell, with a subdued balsamic. Taste is of butterscotch, with just enough of that tart balsamic to prevent it getting too sweet. Light carbonation, very smooth, very drinkable. Possibly my favorite from this brewery."
"pours a very nice dark red/brown chestnut color with a great 2 finger beige head with solid clinging lacing... smell is of a kriek tart cherries and some musty oak with some sour patch vinegar its funky and musty..taste is the same tart sweet cherries hit the side of the tongue then some sour patch and musty oak in the back of the mouth.. its very good..mouth feel is full and hits the palette all over the taste buds from sweet to sour to murky and musty then to an oak finish..i find this to be a delicious flanders with just the right amount of sour to enjoy... its a sipper that gets better as it warms"
"Overall a really solid ale here, really nicely done with a tremendous bouquet and also depth of flavor. I would love to have this one again any day."
"This is a decent and drinkable flemish red ale, and seems a reasonable example of the type, but I think it's a little too sweet and lacks complexity and intensity compared to something like Rodenbach."
"Similar to Duchesse De Bourgogne, as I would expect being the same style and brewery. Though this is obviously much dryer. Excellent throughout. I am going to have to get a bottle of Duchesse to try side by side with this. Highly recommend."
"D - Sweet, good, yummy, but too simple. A chick beer."
"D: Drinkable very easy going down. Surprisingly refreshing."
"Smooth medium bodied and very easy to drink. A style that I have been big on recently so I would like more but could see how one would be enough. A very good beer."
"Notes: Nice sour to keep around, and it´s high within the style but makes one long for an extended complexity and a shorter sweet range."
"D - A solid Flanders Red all the way around... Not the best I've had, but enjoyable none the less and one I would welcome in the future..."
"Opinion: This is an outstanding beer! I really like the Duchesse from this brewery and this beer is no slouch by comparison. This one is a bit sweeter than the Duchesse, but the Duchesse is really about the only other beer that I could compare this to. If you like Flanders and sour ales like I do, you will respect the raw intensity of like a Rodenbach, but this beer is significantly more subtle. It is a very well blended beer and I would drink this beer all the time if it was available in my area. We have the Duchesse in Texas now, so I can't complain. Give this one a shot if you like sours or not...you won't be disappointed."
"It was light in the mouth with a refreshing drinkability."
"I've been sneaking a few of these into the movies lately. Awesome. Two of my greatest passions, in one place."
"Pours a very deep crimson, with dark brown highlights making the proceedings even darker. The rich-looking head plumes to about a finger or so thick, but dissipates rather quickly, settling to a simmer on the surface. The nose is comprised of green apples, pears, cranberries, and cardamom: sour, yes, but with substance behind it, rather than sour for the sake of sour. The taste takes those sour fruit notes and adds a bit of complexity with the subtle body and sweetness of the malts. Unfortunately, though, there is an expectation of some bite, some climactic punch from the back and sides of the tongue, but this never comes. Luckily, though, the body remains in the medium range and the carbonation is just right, keeping this nice brew from sinking in terms of drinkability."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't pick it up again. The malt profile was a little too high, and the sour and fruit notes didn't come out as much as I wanted. There are a lot of better sours out there to try. I like their Duchesse offering more."
"This was a sweet style Flemish Brown. To me it lacked the sour that I would like to have in this style. But the taste beyond that and the molasses like sweetness were very nice. This is a good version of the sweet end of the spectrum of this style. I would try it again."
"Drinkability is high if you like this style. Very flavorful, but digestible and lower alcohol. In fact, it's a great digestif, which is why I'm having it right now. Obviously some people will not, but I think you should have at least half a bottle before your decide. The Burgundy (wine) of Belgium for sure!"
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and adequately carbonated."
"D: Pretty average, too much flavor to drink too quickly but not hiding too high of an abv."
"Drinkability- Sweet and sour sauce that is beer. I'm sure older versions of this are much better as the beer sours a bit more and loses a bit of that sweet edge. Not bad, but either more time is needed or less malt. Probably more time to let the sour develop."
"A little flat overall. Not in terms of carbonation, but ""wow factor"". Normal European brown ale notes, with enough puckering sourness to lift it above the crowd. Fruity and sensational, lemon-lime zestiness up front, but the mouthfeel is a little thick. Doesn't quite hold up to the best of the Flanders red style."
"Vichtenaar is pretty spot on for the style (and I've graded it as such), but its never going to be a style I love. The gradual build up of vinegar flavours is enjoyable at first, but by the end of the bottle I've had enough and struggle to finish. If only this stuff was available in half bottles!"
"Mouthfeel is very light and not very drinkable becuase of the strongness of the beverage. This is a little disappointing."
"drinkabliilty is great. subtle and easy drinking with a wonderfully complex character and a very tasty profile. an excellent flemish brew. cheers!"
"A great example of Flanders Red, but perhaps not the best."
"Seems like fairly high carbonation during the pour... lots of fluffy tan bubbles with a faint pink tint. The beer is a ruddy chestnut colour and a bit translucent. Great head retention. Fruity aroma, tart berries and sour cherries, a bit of wood. A little musty too, with notes of wet hay and leather. Tart, fruity flavour with lots of berry sweetness. Strawberries, sweet cherries, oak, cotton candy, earthy, slight spice in the finish. The flavour was great initially, but seemed to mellow somewhat after a few sips. Not sure if it's the beer's fault or my palate's, but it still tastes fine, just not as crisp on the tongue. Medium to light bodied with generous carbonation and an airy texture. Overall, pretty good."
"Sip, sip, sip --whoa -- I've got a quarter pint left! I was certainly ready for another (but alas, as this was the first try, only bought the single). This went down exceptionally easy for me. Overall, a terrific beer."
"Poured a brownish red with a two finger fluffy offwhite head that died with the beer and left lace patches. A grape and oaky smell, like a mild red wine, with sour fruits like grape and cherry along with a hint of sweet malt. The fruit taste is mostly grape and cherry, with there being a light sour fruit taste but also some sweetness in this medium-bodied ale. Goes down easy and smooth while retaining a crispness and dryness from the sour fruit flavors and intense carbonation. Balanced with the sweetness, possible caramel malt and honey in there, and smoothed out thanks to oak casks. Not necessarily session this as one after my lunch has me feeling alright, but this is a must-try for anyone."
"ooo this is good. Like exotic. Sweet, tart, earthy and supremely delicious. Poured with a nice light tan head and a little lace. Color is a clear mahoganey. Aroma is sour with floral, spicey, and caramel highlights. Flavor is even better: tart at first, immediately thereafter sweet with a shroud of earthiness. Body is very good with carbonation likewise. Finsih is a bit sweet tart and not too heavy. Not exactly a session beer, but very easy to reorder after the first."
"D: Easy to drink, while not the best sour beer I've ever had, I can definitely trace the roots of beers like La Folie to this. Excellent beer, I will definitely seek this out again, as well as try the Kriek version."
"Gorgeous burgundy colored beer forms a 2 cm head in my Chimay chalice. Nice lacing blankets the glass. Nose is fruity, ripe with cherries and notes of vinegar and malt. Taste is a bit tart with mild sourness. Very smooth and light bodied, perfect carbonation. Mellow maltiness balances the beer throughout. Easy to drink and refreshing beer that vanishes quickly and leaves you wanting more."
"D: This is a very drinkable flanders red, if you're into these styles of beer. I like the fact that there isn't a whle lot of vinegar flavors, just a hint in the nose."
"A good beer. I would really enjoy this beer if it did not have the vinegar aftertaste."
"This was probably hands down, the most interesting tasting beer I have had in a long time. It is different. I could imagine this would taste great blended with a triple. Your average beer drinking would probably spit this out and cry foul. Those that don't spit it out and like it would probably seek this out the rest of their life. I am probably one of the few that enjoys and appreciates, but I honestly do not not love this beer."
"M&D: the restrained, delicate even, level of dry-ish hops and woody, lactic sourness makes this ale a very drinkable and approachable one. The carbonation is mild, the body retains its integrity without going thin at all throughout the drink... this is a very balanced and delicious example of Flemish Oud Bruin to me."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern for a little something different. Appeared a hazy red-brown. Everyone is right, this beer is a lot like the Duchesse. In fact I'm not even sure how it varies. It's sweet and smooth at first, followed by a sharp, vinegar/sour tang. The malts have subtle berry fruit flavors and the beer finishes on a tangy note. Worth a try if you're into the style."
"Drinkability:coming off of Duchesse and Echte Kriek this one does not touch the same sour tones--although I do like it..A fine example of the style, I will look for it again"
"D - I couldn't finish this beer--the vinegar got to me after a while. That's not to say that this beer isn't worth drinking, it was just too much for me."
"D: This is a great Flanders red. It could use some more sour/tart/vinegar in the flavor but it still tastes great."
"I just can't get enough of the Flanders Red style. This was another excellent example, though not quite up to part with Duchesse or Rodenbach."
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy reddish color ale with a medium foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet cherries and light sour and oaky notes. Taste is also dominated by tasty oak notes with a light lingering sour note with some sweet cherries. I thought the bit was slightly overly sweet but oak notes were just about perfect, carbonation might have been a bit low. Well done."
"11.2 ounce bottle purchased from Liquid Solutions in Oregon for four dollars, consumed 1/10/09, reviewed from notes, poured into my New Belgium snifter, color is a ruby red and medium brown mix, one inch foamy off white head that lasts a good amount of time, leaves some lacing at first, aroma is made up of vinegar, vanilla, oak, sour apples, cherries, and , flavor is rather wine-like but with more vanilla, starts off with sweet berries, sweet malt in the middle, finish is slightly acidic with apples and dry with some lingering oak, sweet, slightly tart, and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate level of carbonation, could drink a few bottles of this, on the sweeter side for a Flanders and took away from its drinkability a bit, did not really know what this was before ordering it, just saw that it was an intepretation of this style I had not tried and that was enough, might drink again in the future, worth trying"
"Overall, an OK sour, that's a bit pricey. There's some sourness but I don't think it blends really well with the other flavors."
"D - Drinkability is very good for this beer. The aroma could use some work and that is the only real flaw that I can find. The flavor is where this brew lets you know what it's all about. Not enough can be said for this category. Very pleasant and surprising. This is an easily recommended brew for the style."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"D. Very high for the style. This is the beer I'd hand to someone who had never had a Flanders Red.. If only we could acquire this brew in my home state..."
"smooth, sour, malty, oaky, its a very crisp and refreshing ale that reminds me why I love this style. better with every sip and just unlike any other, I look forward to every new sip"
"Pours a dark brown with burgundy edges and a thin head. Aroma is a bit funky/ sour with lots of oak, wood and vanilla. This is an extremely well balanced beer that is very smooth. The againg in oak gives the roasted malts a perfect balance of sour and sweet. Flavor also consists of oak, vanilla, cherry and berries. Slightly dry refreshing finish."
"This is an interesting ale. It pours a rich brown with a lacy tan head. The nose has sweet malts, sour fruit and a unique barnyard funkyness. Taste has a big rotting wood presence with the sweet malts. Not too much tartness. Crisp body drinks well. A nice beer."
"I like it. I have no clue whether this is right for the style, but I enjoyed it. Not really sure what I would pare this with, but it's working well as an apertif. I'm not even sure there's another beer of this style available around here, but if I come across one, I'll check it out to compare it to this."
"I would not recommend this beer. I had this bottle at Beer Mania in Brussels."
"Drinkability is fairly high. This is tasty, and certainly easy to drink."
"The dryness keeps it from being too sour, and makes it very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is sour but soft. Not too overpowering. Carbonation is tickling and soft. Easy to drink"
"Had this at Delirium Cafe in Brussel. Best before 4/7/2009. Served in a branded cylindrical glass. Really, really red body, foamy white head. Really funky nose, rotten fruit. Palate is less sour than expected, sweet malt, candy sugar, very grainy, mildly acetic, sugary finish."
"Nice red color and great nose that pops out during the pour. Nice mild sour with a nice smoothness. It's not tear your face off sour. It is a nice mellow sour that I'd love to be enjoying some BBQ while drinking."
"Pours a deep brown/ deep red color with a tannish head. In the aroma, sour dark cherries. In the taste, huge cherries and a big tartness. A sour bite and a medium mouthfeel, with a dry sour cherry aftertaste. Big sour, big cherry, and a good mouthfeel, very nice flemmish red."
"Red/Brown color with an tan head that won't go away. This has less balsamic notes than the Duchesse but I can still smell it. Tart cherries and other dark fruits. Taste is vinegar with some sweetness. It starts to get flat and lose some of the tartness towards the end."
"Let me start out by saying I'm a big fan of Flemish Sour Ales and make an effort to try every one I come across. Poured this sample into a Chimay Goblet which contributed to the quicker evaporation of the lightly tan one finger head. The beer is an attractive brown w/ a red hue to it. The smell is classic cider vinegar but not as strong as Monks Cafe Flemish Sour and nowhere near as strong as Rodenbach Grand Cru. As previously stated by other reviewers, this beer is an impressive juxtaposition btw a classic Flemish Red and an Oud Bruin. Its not as lactic as most serious Flemish Reds but its much more tart than Oud Bruins. I get more of an apple tartness than a cherry tartness with this one. Simply Delicious."
"Overall, I believe this is a style that needs to grow on you. More like wine than beer. Not easy-drinking or for sessions, but probably a good example of the style, just not a personal favorite for me."
"Enjoyed at Monks, in a side by side comparison to Monks Flemish Red Ale. Extremely tall head after the pour, which quickly dissipated leaving only the sweet/sour very slightly vinegary smell of a good Flemish Red. Taste is fairly similar to the Monks beer, but not quite as sweet and with less of a presence of fruit. In my opinion probably the best sweet/tart ratio of any of the sour beers. Doesn't have as strong of a vinegar taste as say a Rodenbach gives off, but does have some cider vinegar present. As previous reviewers have mentioned it could stand to be more sour, and is definitely lacking in intensity compared to a Rodenbach or some of the lambics. Still, a very tasty beer and definitely recommended to anyone who cares for Flemish Reds."
"Bit of cidery vinegar in there, not really turning me off, but its there. No alcohol to speak of. Really a good beer, but with all the sweet and dark sugar notes, it's not what I was expecting when my previous brew was a Rodenbach."
"Vichtenaar is a good, but not great, flanders red . . . or brown. I'm not really sure."
"Good interesting beer. The iron flavor is oddly enjoyable."
"Pours a dark ruby red color, borderline mahogany with a nice quarter inch of tan head. Aromas start out richly acetic, lots of vinegar, candy sweetness, vanilla, chocolate, oak, cherries, it's gorgeous. On the palate, things continue to develop. The sourness starts out rich and oaky, fruity, spicy phenols, finishing dry and mellow without being overly tart. Enough sweetness there that the tannic astringency in the end is buffered. Overall its an excellent beer, but I think it still falls short of my other favorites in this style."
"A clean dark brown ale with deep ruby highlights. Has a small off white head with alittle bit of lace. The aroma has a strong sour malt character with almost a apple cider ( not hard apple cider, but that unfiltered kind you get from orchards) backbone and hints of spices. The taste starts with a sweet and tarts snap on the tongue pushed ahead quickly nice prickly carbonation. The sourness, with hints of apple, grabs at the back of the tongue. Just before the clean and refreshing finish. This one goes down nice and easy."
"Poured from a bottle at the Brick Store Pub. Pours redddish brown with a ggood initial head that fades to a ring that sticks around. Sour acetic aromas, red wine vinegar like with sweet and somewhat spicy overtones of cinnamon and brown sugar. The taste is sweet and sour with a bitter finish. Quite soft and not all that complex. Soft, gentle mouthfeel. This is a Flanders red with training wheels from the makers of Duchesse de Bourgogne."
"The cap pops with a high-pitched hiss and the carbonation seems lively from the pour. A clear, nice red-chestnut with a bubbly tan head drops to an attractive, light and lacey cover. The nose is pretty clean and mild, but offers a hint of sour and fruitiness. Malts and hops take back seat. It seems to fall somewhere between a Flanders red and brun (as the bottle describes), with more restrained sour than the former and lacking the maltiness of the latter. The flavors are balanced between sweet and sour from start to finish. The complexity falls within a range of sweet and sour fruits - cherry, apricots, peach - as well as some winey flavors. The finish is refreshing with a pleasant impression of the sour flavors. The carbonation that was evident at first is a bit less lively in the mouth and would have added a bit to the medium mouthfeel. A very enjoyable drink, not too complex, but never unbalanced."
"A good beer, recommended."
"Pours a clear but very dark ruby with a light tan head off an aggressive pour. The head falls fast. Nose is a beautiful combination of wood and cherries. Flavor is a great sweetness combined with firm cherry tones. The wood character really meshes with everything else so well that it provides the perfect punctuation. Feel is great. The bubble still kicks me in the back of my mouth after its lingered in my mouth for a while. Overall a great drinking experience. Elegant and smooth and well made. Very well worth trying out and having more beyond."
"High carbonation with just a little warmth and a nice juicy vinous quality on the tongue. Surprisingly the booze is detectable despite the low abv. Interesting and appealing."
"Drinkability : très bonne bière dans le style ale rouge flamande"
"All and all, a good beer, with many of the same qualities of the Duchesse Flemish Sour, just a little muted in eacah category."
"Drinkability - Such a delicious and complex beer and @ only 5.1% abv, I could enjoy a few of these very easily. This beer surprised me because I thought the Duchesse was the cream of the crop when it came to Sour Red Flemish Ales, but I actually enjoy this one more. SUPERB."
"Goes incredibly easy, pleasant and quiet along with the sun coming down; picture perfect!"
"M&D - quite easy to down for a sour ale, effervescent on the palate and rather flavorful, one of the more drinkable Flanders Ale, above La Folie, but below the Duchesse (on drinkability that is, not overall quality)"
"Pours a nice dark amber/mahgoney color, nice carbonation, nice little foamy off-white head, some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, tangy/sour, some dark fruits (plums,cheeries), and a touch of caramel. The taste is mostly malty, and tangy/sour. The finish is bitter/tangy/dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome little brew, recommended for sure."
"Overall - Another top notch Flanders red from Verhaeghe... Almost up there with the Duchesse De Bourogne... Highly recommended..."
"Great drinkability for the low ABV and qualities the better brews of this style have as noted."
"Overall: As far as Flemish or Flanders ales go, this is a good one. The best Ive had to date is Duchesse De Bourgogne, to which this compares favorably. Not terribly sour, but you definitely know youre having something different. Good representation of style. Not something Id pursue, but I admire the art that goes into this type of beer nonetheless. Definitely worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - This was only the second time I've had this beer. The first was at the Return of the Belgian Beer Fest in Boston last year. At that time I swore I would find this beer again and purchase enough to last me into retirement. Sadly, I had to settle for splitting a bottle over the above-mentioned food pairing. I will say the paring was exceptional and really brought out the warm tartness present in the marinade. This is a fine representation of a Flanders Red Ale and a totally different profile when compared with a Rodenbach, Rodenbach Grande Cru or Monk's Sour Ale. I've heard that the Duchesse de Bourgogne has a simlar profile. That will be my next stop. Just goes to show the variety present and the ability to experience the joys in the variety!"
"Poured out a dark cherry brown with a thin off white head. Has a nice sour Flemish nose, leathery sweaty horse saddle, dehydrated cherries, wet socks, and prune. The taste was tart and refreshing. It offered sourness, cherry, sloe gin, and woody resin. Nice. The mouthfeel was thin, with medium carbonation. This style is not for everyone, but if you like the style, this is an excellent example and a great beer. Very drinkable within the confines of the style."
"What a delightful beer. A very fine Flemish Red ale of the sour variety. Vichtenaar holds a third candle to Duchesse and Rodenbach in the running, but this truly is an enjoyable beer. The smell is a little much, even for someone like me who really enjoys the style. It may be a little too vinegary, a little too tart in the nose, but it is fine nevertheless. The pour is the right combination of dark chestnut, carbonation and head for this style. Basically, there isn't much head at all, and very little lacing. The taste is a nice, complex blend of aged and newer ales, giving this ale a very nice balance of sweet, sour, chartreuse, citrus, and vinegar to stir the palate. The Flemish reds are truly a chewy digestive that complement meats and cheeses. Not quite as good as Duchesse and Rodenbach, but I really enjoyed this one nevertheless, and if I want a slight change of pace for a Flemish Red, I would go back to it again and again. There is an iron-like feel and taste on the back end, a bit more than should be, but this should not deter the adventurous. L'Chaim!"
"Very thin for my taste although there's a redeeming creaminess to the finish. An OK sour but I'd take a Rodenbach or Duchesse any day of the week over this."
"D: Very nice example of the Flanders Red Ale...I look forward to having this again and give it a solid recommendation."
"980"
"This would be the first step on the road of Flemish Sours, next Duchesse, leading up to Rodenbach Grand Cru. Cheers..."
"Pours very dark brownish-red color. There is a very thin layer of head that mostly clings to the side. Hard to see the carbonation as it is so dark. The aroma is very strong and is that of whiskey, but with a little fruit. The flavor is extremely complex and is hard to distinguish all the flavors, but has a little whiskey that is a little fruity and tart too. Mouthfeel is smooth and it is lightly carbonated. Drinkability is very high, because you'll have to drink several of these before you can figure out all the aromas and tastes."
"Pours an opaque, dark brown in the glass, but is almost a caramel brownish-reddish when held up to the light--with about a half-pinky sized head on it that has not dissipated. It smells half sour/half sweet and the taste matches perfectly--it starts out sour with a sweet and somewhat fruity (cherries? apples?) aftertaste (without being too sweet). I would say that the sweet and sour flavors are very well balanced--which also increases the drinkability."
"From the same people who brought you Duchesse de Bougogne, this flanders shares some of the same traits that you either loved or loathed over its more popular sibling. I personally love both, tart yet very drinkable and overall very tasty indeed. I would still push for something a bit less sweet like Rodenbach Grand Cru in the long run but this makes a welcome change and is definatly something worth trying."
"This brew pours a dark ruby red, almost brown color. The head is two inches in height, and red in color. The aroma is sour with hints of cherry and a touch of sweetness. The taste is quite sweet for a flemish red; there really isn't much sourness at all. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer isn't nearly as sour as I expect a flemish red to be. However, it is still a drinkable beer if you aren't looking for something extremely sour."
"Only the 3rd beer I have given a 5 in taste to. This one is near perfect once if hits your mouth and I can't imagine finding one i liked better. Sometimes, taste is everything."
"Rusty amber with caramel brown highlights. Spritzy, rocky, light dirty sand head. Nose explodes with malt vinegar, dates, leather, rotten fruit, and molasses. Is it weird that I like the vinegar and the rotten fruit? Light caramelly sweetness on the periphery; fruity sweet, sorbet-like palate soon turns sour and acidic. Finish is fruity again, with accents of oak and vanilla. The vinegary, sour tang stays a long time though. Light-bodied, highly carbonated/spritzy feel. Very good beer. Thanks to my Boston pals for recommending this one to me!"
"Medium body is accented by the slippery acidity on the tongue. Very lightly tart and very refreshing, worth seeking out."
"Pours into the Duchesse ee Bourgogne glass transparent dark red & brown with small film of head, thin lace. Fragrant nose full of oak, sweet and sour balsamic vinegar. Flavor follows the smell. Sour-edged tannic balsamic vinegar coats the mouth. Thick and chewy body with decent balancing carbonation.. Quenching dry toasted malts at the finish. Enjoyable but somewhat overly sweet and straightforward."
"Drinkability/Overall- A very happy surprise. I could drink a couple of these easy. Overall a very well crafted and balanced beer. The way everything comes together in this beer to give your taste buds a roller coaster of an experience is a work of art. I am hoping I find another Flemish ale in my treasure chest. To keep with the treasure analogy: this was a gem."
"A perfect blend of sweet and tart, this beer is nicely smooth with flavorful bursts of cherry. This beer finds itself somewhere between Rodenbach and Redbach. This is fantastic, easy to drink with low enough alcohol to make this a session beer, though the price puts it out of that range. Seek this one out, it is worth it!"
"Lately I have been loving flander's reds, so its no surprise I picked this one up. It poured a beautiful deep ruby color with a medium sized dense head that never really went away. Smell is malty with hints of tart cherries and a faint hint of oak, kinda lacking overall, but not a bad smell by any means. Taste is oaky, peppery, with hints of cherries. Nice tart/sweet balance. Really well made example of the style I think. The pepperyness really plays well off the tartness. Mouthfeel is a bit bitter, and sticky sweet. Drinkability on this is pretty darn good, this is my 2nd time having the beer, the first time I must admit I couldnt finish it, but that was before my tastes had adapted to like belgian style ales. If you like belgians, and particularly flanders red ales dont miss this one, its pretty tasty."
"Drinkability is good for a Flanders Red. This would be a great candidate for someone new to the style. However, the flavors are little bland for a fan of Flemish beers."
"The head isn't thick, but it doesn't go away completely. The lacing is beautiful and sticks really well. The color is dark to reddish brown. Smell is fruity and sour, very enjoyable. Taste is slightly sweet and less sour. It's almost like sour fruit juice. Mouthfeel is soft and well carbonated. Overall this was very drinkable and nice to have. I will enjoy more of these."
"refreshing, clean feel with a fruity sweetness. sweet malts, cherries, and grapes with a faint hint of grapefruity sour. fairly sweet but not excessive or cloying. very flavorful and exceedingly drinkable."
"Drinkabitly is alright , a little sweet for my taste. I suspect its style isn't my type but I'll try a few more."
"Very vinegar and oak dominated aroma that both play off each other to effect a sharp spiciness. Body is a mild brown and holds a diminishing pinky thin tan head. Fore is suprinsgly malty sweet with just a hint of sourness. Has a hearty maltiness to it I did not expect. Sorta like a standard English brown Ale with some funk added. even has a very mild nuttiness to it...though sweeter than a normal brown. The finish is almost bread puddingesque being sweet yet hearty and midly toasty. Big suprise and I rather enjoy this one. Faint hints of vanilla in the far aftertaste."
"Drinkability: I love this style for probably too many reasons I can't explain. This is a more than solid version of it I'd say, even though I certainly need to have more in the future without a doubt."
"I'd like some more SOUR in this beer, because without it Vichtenaar takes a hit on dimensionality. Still, this is certainly solid and well-made."
"Very pretty ruby/violet colored with a small, wispy and quickly diminishing head of white foam. Vibrant aroma, strange smelling, with hints of barbeque sauce, ranch, balsamic vinegar and grapes. Body is very thin and one dimensional and it cant decide if it wants to be sweet or sour. A totally dull red, lacking complexity."
"amber/garnet/brown body, great color. rich aromas, smells of BBQ sauce, tart acidity. creamy and soft palate in the mouth. BBQ'ed meat comes through, lite acidity, nice balanced malt profile. tame wild yeast flavors/aromas. very approachable, very drinkable for a flanders red. great food beer."
"Not as sour as others in the style, this one drinks like a table wine-"
"Another ""volunteer's booty"" bottle from ASN's big Belgian fest, 11.2 ouncer, with best before dating. Pours w/ next to no head and minimal lacing. Noisy pour, pretty clear, slightly reddish amber liquid, nose of light cola, cherries and other tart fruits. Tasty, tart Flemish ale. Crisp and tasty, fine example of the style. Woody sour cherry notes. Fruity and quite drinkable. Sophisticated, civilized and complex achievement in brewing. Well worth seeking out and enjoying with some stinky cheese, nuts and fruits."
"This beer was part of the Michael Jackson Flemish Sour beer dinner at Monk's Cafe this past Sunday. I believe this one was served on tap. This beer came in a wine glass with nice deep ruby body and good lacing down the glass. The nose of this beer is a very vital cherry smell with some other fruit notes. The taste is sour cheeries and good carbonation, crisp. I really enjoy this beer and with a medium body is a very drinkable red ale. I went back for seconds."
"this beer promises a lot in the nose and delivers some of it. A pleasant and far too drinkable flemish red ale. worth finding to try."
"Lovely aroma, dark colour, lots of lace. Great tartness well-balanced, with lots of fruit, yummy cherry and dark fruit. For this level of alcohol, so much complex flavour. Sampled with the Atlanta B.A. crew at Brick Store Pub. Possibly my most enjoyed beer in the Atlanta two-day pubcrawl."
"Pours with a one-finger light tan head that fades slowly and leaves a ton of lace. Clear deep red color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is fruity. Starts sweet with a citrusy sour flavor in the background, finish is clean. $3.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Pours out dark brown with a slight rust tinge. The head is not huge, but maintains a rather creamy looking centimeter or two. Smells sweet, vinegar-like, fruity, oaky. This smells exactly like this half-muscat/half-blueberry wine I've had some time ago. Tastes like ripe, juicy cherries and oak. Starts off sweet then finishes up tart. No bitterness to speak of. The mouthfeel is very light and lively on the tongue. It perfectly accentuates the sweet and tart characteristics."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a smooth, oakey scent that blends well with the sour aroma. It seems to have some maltiness to it. The taste is great also. It has a wonderful malt complexity that is complimented with a refreshing sourness as well as a slight woody finish. It goes down easy and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer is a real treat. I love the flavor as well as the aroma. It has a subtle sourness that is very enjoyable, unlike some that are too sour to drink."
"Ive had this beer many times in bottle at the Brick Store in Decatur, GA. This is my second favorite beer in the world, followed only by Duchesse de Bourgogne. It pours from the bottle into a tulip glass a dark medium brown with a quickly fading head that leaves a fairy ring and a bit of pattering on the top. It has moderate lacing for the first half of the session. The smell is a very sharp vinegar and musk. The smell, however, is much more sour than the flavor. The flavor is a very complex cascade of sweet, sour, carbonation, with brown sugar and dried fruit overtones. The mouthfeel is light to moderate with serious carbonation pricking. It isnt as drinkable as Duchesse de Bourgogne but its a very close second. If Greens package store would carry this beer I would stock it at my place."
"pours a dark brown, with some red, with a thicky, creamy head. really rich and so smooth in the mouth. smells of sour funk and chocolate. on the palate there is rich milk chocolate, dark chocolate, with sour red vinegar funk -- wow. a really unique beer."
" Taste is well balanced for the style, I think. Fruity, winey, slightly sour, oak, and some sweetness for balance. A little buttery, not as acidic or sour as others of its ilk. The bubbles are very fine, and they are many. Drinkability is great, probably due to the mild nature of the beer. Complexity suffers as a result."
"Drinkability is OK but wouldn't grab this one first if I was in a Flanders Red mood."
"D: Drinkability is quite good."
"Murky looking burgandy tone. Thin light brown head. Lace is stringy and sparse. Strong aroma of vinegar, brown sugar and blackberries. The acetic acid is dominating though. Smell reminds me of Easter Egg Coloring time. Now on the buds, I don't get the expected blast of acidity. Rather a nice blance of sweet and sour. Though the scale tips in favor of the sweet nuances. Sweet cherry juice. Brown sugar. Molasses. Tart black berries. A slight bit of rice vinegar. Quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is more carbonated than most other Flanders styles I've enjoyed, but it's compatible with the beer. It's not overly so carbonated. Alcohol is absent in the flavor. There's really a nice little tug of war between sweet and sour in this beer that I like. Good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is light and airey in spite of the medium body. Very slick tecture and huge drinkability. The most sessionable and approachable beer I've had of this style."
"Vichtenaar is a decent Flanders red, although I have to believe that there are much better ones out there. Perhaps the cherriness of its brewery mate (Echte Kriekenbier) will be more to my liking and will provide what I found to be lacking in this bottle."
"Burgundy red. Sweet/tart, apple cider vinegar, a touch of musty funkyness, both sweet and sour cherries, fuzzy carbonation and a little cane sugar all swirling together in a riot. For all the flavors going on, this still seemed to have a bit less depth than others of the style I've had."
"350 mL bottle best by November 27, 2005. Dark maroon body, shows off a lot of red shades in the darkness, creamy off white head, leaves good lace. Smell is very sour, funky and tart. This being my first Flanders Red, I have nothing to go against except what I have seen from the Oud Bruins. It does have a lot of the same characteristics of that style. Tase is funky and intense, but does have a fruitier aspect than the Oud Bruins. A very tart and interesting beer, I would like to have tried this up against another Red, but there aren't that many available here."
"Taste: Less acidic than most flemish sours I've had before, but with a stronger bite in the end. Sounds a little contradictory, but that how it tasted to me...The oak comes through nicely in the aftertaste. Like a good quality aged balsamic vinegar. I almost like it as much as Rodenbach grand cru."
"I am really growing to love this style. However, this isn't the best example of Flanders Reds, albeit good. Aromas quickly surface that reminds me of red vinegar, merlot, apple cider, and accompanied by a mellow astringency. Amberish rust in color, quite high CO2, a dainty head that doen't impress. The high demands on barley, and other grains sweeten and up the body to balance out the sourness and tartness that is experienced in the nose. Finishes musty and with a dry tartness. A likable beer; one that I will enjoy on occasions, despite a few quirks."
"Pillowy smooth head, lasting on a pretty brown mahogany color body. The smell immediately shows the typical Flemish character, sour and wooden. The taste shows more roundness, with the tart citric aspect being balanced by sweet fruity notes and a wooden and very slightly chocolaty character. The mouthfeel is clean, very round and creamy, quite enjoyable, with the carbonation that nicely brings fresh lemony notes. Quite drinkable."
"From Notes: Dark/light ruby red depending on the light of the day. Small fizzy head is not too impressive and does not provide nice lacing. Aromas are all balsamic vinegar, dark raspberries, cherries, and some lactic sour funk as well. Taste follows suit with some very sour acidic notes and some lactic chalkiness as well. Totally suitable to a Flemish red or bruin, and I happen to love it. Not the most complex in this style but certainly nice enough and totally comparable to the other 3 or so flemish reds from this Belgian brewery. Mouthfeel is slick and acrid, but somehow likeable and drinkability remains good."
"I don't normally like beers that are tangy or have any fruit nuances. This is my first Flanders Red, and I'm going back to the store this week to pick up other examples from this style."
"Drinkability and Overall: Out of the 3 beers I've had from this brewery, this one is in the middle. Better than the Echte Kriekenbier, but definitly not close to the Duchesse. This an enjoyable beer I'd reccomend trying once, but not buying a whole case of."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with little to no head. No lacing. Smell of cherries, but not too much and not much else going on in the nose. Taste is an unexpected sweet. Shouldn't this style be sour? Sure there is a hint of the sourness, but taste is dominated by a carbonated cherry juice flavor. Not unpleasant, but this is more like a fruit lambic. The sweetness tends to make this feel fuller than some Flanders reds. However, the complexity isn't there. Easy to drink. The spouse thought it was sour, but she had just had strawberries. I'll stick with the Goundenband on-tap at CAH."
"This is a mixed bag...I love Flemish Ales and Oud Bruins but this is like a mishmash of vinegar and sugar...it's too diametric and the flavors aren't cohesive. I'd pass on this one again."
"On Tap differences: Not nearly as sweet, more tart, but not like vinegar, more cherry flavor, Very drinkable, remeniscent of a wine. The tap version would get a rating of at least a half point higher"
"Puckering and sweet. Lightly oaky with hints of vanilla. More sweet than sour. Could use a bit more sour to balance the sweet but lots of flavor. Full bodied with a lightly sour aftertaste. A pretty good Flanders red."
"Verhaeghe's Vichtenaar nestles nicely between some of the more sour and overly-sweet examples of the Flander's red style. It pours a clear, dark chestnut robe with orange-ruby highlights and a thin head of creamy tan foam. The head drops readily yet somehow manages to maintain a wide collar and whispy surface covering. A few splashes of sticky lace about the goblet add to its appearance. In the nose, a combination of delicate but somewhat sharp, vinous fruit and sweetish malt greets you. It's delicately effervescent on the tongue with a very fine bubbled, slightly elevated carbonation, and it becomes somewhat airy as it crosses the palate. Muted caramel and soft, subtly tart dark skinned fruit (figs, plums, raisins/dark grapes) combine in the flavor, leaving it quite sherry-like. It's fairly intense upfront before fading slowly and seamlessly away into a long-lasting aftertaste that is again, not unlike that of a glass of sherry or port. And that's the beauty of the Flander's red style, the push and pull between the tart and the sweet.. the way the sourness lingers on your lips but the sticky, dull malt lays on your teeth and at the back of the throat. It's quite nicely done and certainly worth trying, although it doesn't have quite the breadth of character that some other examples do."
"Sampled at Monk's in Philly - only my second visit and it just keeps getting better! 11.2 oz. bottle. 5.1% abv. Appearance - dark brown w/ little head. Aroma - balsamic vinegar w/ a distinctly malt background. I must say this one took me by total surprise. I was expecting a tart, sour aroma, but vinegar? Taste - malty sweetness up front balanced out by the aforementioned balsmic vinegar quality. Mouthfeel - very thin, but drinkable. I know my review sounds somewhat negative to this point, but it's more from my incredulity than from my lack of enjoyment of this beer. I have to say this was the most unusual, yet enjoyable, beer I have ever tasted. A drinking quality balsamic vinegar is produced and used as an digestif. I have never tried this, but I have to assume that it would be similar to Vichtenaar. Try this unique taste experience if you get the chance."
"I liked this beer, I liked this style, I'm definitely going to try to get more into it once I can find more examples. Unfortunately west mich is lacking in options. I bet this one would go really well with some flavorful Italian food."
"Either way, a very tasty brew."
"Drinkability  This can be a harsh style to drink, but the Vichtenaar was mellow and easy going. Im partial to black cherries so really enjoyed this offering from Verhaeghe."
"This Flanders Red Ale poured a clear, almost opaque, red-brown color with creamy, tall, slightly pink foam that persisted and clung to the glass. The smell was lightly sweet and fruity. The taste was very sweet and sugary with a flavor of sour cherries. The mouthfeel was tangy and smooth with medium body and strong carbonation. The sourness and sugar lingered. This was an OK ale, though a bit too sweet for my likes."
"Drinkability: Belgian sour ales are clearly an acquired taste and while the longer I savored this brew, the more I enjoyed it"
"All in all I think its a bit sweet to drink too many of. I'd like to see it dried out a bit."
"A very nice Flemish ale. Not overly sweet, and a most enjoyable sipper. Reminiscent of a fine sherry in texture, at times, but more like a Lambic fruit ale in taste."
"I must admit; I was surprised I liked this as much as I did, even though this is my favorite style of beer. Oak and vinegar dominate the aroma with hints of cherry and the lobby of a florist. Sweeter, much like Dutchess versus young Rodenbach or something else in that style. More cherry and oak; damn, thats good. Finishes with a mild sour zip and a mild rind-like bitterness when warm. Drinking more reveals hints of brown sugar laced throughout. I could sip on this all evening; I could make a marinade and reduction out of this for a steak; I could put an IV straight in to my arm. I dig it."
"11.2 ounce bottle, best before 22-09-05. Purchased in Kroger, Blacksburg, VA."
"Taste follows on with what the smell promises. Nicely sweet & sour (never works in Chinese food but does here), malty, a light cherry taste in the middle contrinuing thru to the end. Well balanced and very drinkable, a medium body, with a medium effervescence all over the tongue, a little like champagne. Pleasant aftertaste that fades evenly, no surprise flavors or bitterness. A very good, drinkable beer in my favorite style."
"Labeled as a Flemish Red-Brown, never seen anyone claim both of these. Pours a deep amber color with a fluffy tan head. It has a nice sour nose but does not quite deliver in the taste. Sour up front, with hints of balsamic, but this fades to a malty caramelized sweetness that is a bit out of balance. This beer definitely needs more sour character. Definitely not bad, just unbalanced."
"11.2oz Bottle Best Before 16/06/05 Poured a clear reddish brown with lots of active carbonation yet leaving no head. Aroma starts off with vinegar followed by a sweet malt and a bit of fruit. Mouthfeel is a high carbonation and very lively. The flavor is a vingary sweet malt blend that I can't decide whether I like or not. The style is relatively new to me so I could be off on my judgement. Overall an interesting ale with maybe a tad too much vinegar for my liking."
"Where to start? everything about this beer is thick. The taste is oud bruin, with an extra bucket of thick and heavy malts added. Sour, cherries, blackberries. Drinkable? Yes, very much so, but just as you wouldn't spend a night drinking Rochefort 10, you won't spend a night drinking this. Fantastic, though. This is right up my alley, to coin a phrase."
"Balsamic, red meat. blood, butter menthol. Intersting, sour cherries, chocolate malt, vineagr. the only thing i don't like about it, is the unpleasant butter menthol undertones, which is found in their Noel, some minerally notes aswell. All round, a pretty nice beer."
"The body is medium-light, perfect for a very drinkable and refreshing beer like this. Aftertaste strong, fruity an wood."
