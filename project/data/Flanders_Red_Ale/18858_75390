4.75,10.5,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a reddish color ale with a nice thick foamy head with excellent retention and some good lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some oak and cherry is very pleasant. Taste is a super well balanced mix of tart notes with some oak and cherry with light residual sugar notes with almost no acidity. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. That is a world-class Flanders Fed with good level of complexity and perfect level of drinkability.","Phyl21ca","Jul 09, 2014"

3.89,-9.5,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a nice copperish body with a frothy and effervescent head. Aroma is the best part; oak, red wine, mild cherries, cork and a bit of sweetness hidden in the tartness. Flavor is acidic and a bit tart but not prolonged. Fiinshes with a mild cherry sweetness but found the oak flavor and general body to be a bit ordinary, especially considering the pedigree of the brewery.","papat444","May 31, 2014"
4.21,-2.1,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall, very nice. A very well done Flanders Red. It's not Rodenbach Grand Cru but it is not leagues below either. Good stuff.","jrenihan","May 30, 2014"
3.71,-13.7,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,"O/D - This definitely didn't wow, but is a decent example of the style. Easy to drink and nice to explore for sure. A good effort.","tbeckett","May 28, 2014"
4.46,3.7,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours a clear copper color with almost two fingers of bubbly, white head that falls to a thin collar and no lacing. The nose is soft, dominated by tart cherries, some sourness, hints of sweetness and a bit of barnt funk. On the palate, the tart cherries and a touch of sweet malt roll through first, but the beer transitions into crisp tart, sourness. There is a nice oaky character and an overall crispness. The body is medium with nice carbonation making it smooth, light and refreshing. Overall, this is a very tasty brew! Very smooth and a nice balance of residual sweetness and tart, dry sourness. A very strong example of the style!","mtomlins","May 25, 2014"

4.29,-0.2,3.75,3.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,"Overall - It really doesn't get much better than this. To be honest, I am quite surprised given I am a real Belgian enthusiast and many of these North American breweries never seem to usually nail sours. In fact, it reminds me of the Duchesse de Bourgogne, but more fruity and slightly less sour, yet is certainly not far removed. No joke, this is a perfectly balanced Flanders: sour, sweet tart cherries and a beautiful yeast strain.","Agent1","Feb 08, 2014"

3.51,-18.4,4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,"D - Not bad, other than the mildly off-putting aroma. Probably suffered being consumed next to Rodenbach's sublime Caract√®re Rouge, although it's not a very fair comparison as this doesn't have fruit in it. I'd be willing to try this again down the road to see if the sulfur clears up or the acidity intensifies.","MasterSki","Mar 25, 2012"

Thanks chickenm for this gem and Eskimodave need some props for allowing me to taste what I assume will be a great cellar addition.","wordemupg","Jan 22, 2012"
