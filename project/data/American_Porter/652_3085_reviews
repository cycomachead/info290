"Overall: A solid porter - even if it's not all that distinctive I think it's a great example of the style. The flavors are robust without being over-sweet or too hoppy."
""
""
""
"Appearance: Pours bright opaque dark brown under a 1” light tan cap that rises slightly over the rim of the glasss. Smell: Roast and dark sugar aromas. Taste: Starts with balance of dark sugars and mild roast drying on the finish with a slight roast bitterness. Mouthfeel: Mediumn full body, medium low carbonation. Overall: Rich in flavor and very easy to drink."

"On nitro tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Great looking head & lacing that may be smoothering the aroma but not the luscious taste & texture. Nowadays I distinguish porters from stouts by the lack of coffee/chocolate. This is a classic example, IMO, of just that. Don`t get me wrong, I really enjoy it & appreciate the vaca from the tropical aspects. Needless to say the ubiquitous vanilla & sweet are not missed. Malt is ruling this roost."
"12 oz bottle poured into shaker pint. Dark opaque brown body with a tan half-finger of head that settled to a ring. A good amount of lacing is deposited. Aroma is malty - toasted bread, coffee, chocolate - with a touch of hops in the background adding a spicy herbal note. Taste is toasted malt sweetness early then hop spice in the end. Medium body, slick texture, low-average carbonation, long semi-dry roasted finish."
"I'm new to beer and porters but this was a great one. Smooth, flovorful, and smells like heaven."
"Solid porter. Light body, clean mouth feel, malty taste, and no complaints."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Foamy head that stays awhile with nice lacing. Dark brown body in color. The aroma was of bitter coffee, and blueberries (surprisingly!).  Sweet tasting maltiness on the first sip, followed by some bitterness, with that dark roast coffee taste lingering on the tongue.  Overall very tasty, a fine porter I would try again."

"Overall: A very good take on an American Porter. Good roasty malt flavors with a smooth creamy body."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pleasing brown to black with a medium body and mouthfeel. Not as full and roasted as others in this arena, but something of a change of pace during a session. The chocolate malts are up front here, with a taste of fresh baked cookies. Not overly chewy, but with enough body to keep this as a solid option during Spring or Fall, before you need to go to the real warmers."

"Mudpuppy is enjoyable, but doesn't particularly stand out to me in any way. An above average but not really memorable offering."
"O - Very smooth.  Not overly complex but very good."

"O: A very old school take on a porter. Definitely more of a brown porter, and maybe not something the average American craft drinker will understand. It's a nice change of pace beer, but my criticisms would be that the hops are a bit sharp. Get a nice grassy English strain in there and I think I'd like it quite a bit more. Still an easy quaff."
""
"Overall (4.59) : Obviously there's much to say about this beer. I haven't been this psyched about a beer in awhile. I may have picked up an exception to the rule (I sure hope not), as this beer was wild and foamy with yeast fermentation straight out of the bottle, but it is for sure a winner. Good for a sipper on a cold autumn or winter night. I crown thee the best PORTER I have ever had!"

"almost too sweet but the alcohol and semi  dry after taste helps cut it enough, i would consider this a fairly light porter body wise. not a ton of flavors, but somtimes  craft porters are too busy, this guy just has enough weight and plum/roasty  flavor to be somewhat interesting to drink . its still sessionable, and pretty refeshing for a porter, you dont have to save this beer for last. It would be good with a steak or a burger even and some other beer."

"Pretty good. Maybe a bit thin."
"First craft beer I started drinking. Will always have fond memories of this beer. Pours black, with a one inch head. Burnt chocolaty aroma. Similar to roasting marshmallows. Great roasted malty taste with hints of chocolate. Still love this beer."

"The beer has a dark cola brown body and sports a small tan head. Aromas include chocolate roast, subtle coffee. Perhaps a touch of vanilla in the flavor with a hint of smoke. Chocolates, mild sweetness. A touch of roast and coffee beans. Pretty easy drinking with moderate carbonation and a delicate bitterness in the finish. Pretty good."
""
"Overall a pretty nice beer. I consider it to be a dessert beer, as it reminds me a bit of chocolate cake or a brownie. It's maybe a touch heavy on the hops, but still goes down fairly easily. Glad I took a chance on this one."

"Had a cold bottle earlier this evening with some roast chicken and garlic potatoes. Nice dark brown/black pour with a tan head. Very smooth smoky/caramel/mocha flavor that balanced well with the meal. Slightly bitter finish but not overpowering. I'm not a huge fan of porters but my local shop had a 6er of this for $6.99, well worth the risk for that price."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink but has a nice amount of malty aromas and flavors, particularly those of chocolate malts. I found it to be a good representation of the style."

"Overall: Good amount of complexity with plenty of traditional porter malt tones. I would not put it with the Edmund Fitzgerald's or Founder's Porter but is definitely a good one."

"O - I think it's a safe assumption that Central Waters is most widely known for their barrel program which, for the most part features stouts. It should come as no surprise then that their Mudpuppy Porter, a stout's younger brother, should be just as crafted in regards to dark malts and, sure enough, it is! Mudpuppy Porter is a full-flavored beer that keeps it sessionable; low ABV, and a smooth, easy drinking body. A win-win all around!"
""
""
""
"A well-made, robust, porter. Delicious and well-balanced! Very enjoyable!"
""

"Mouthfeel is good. Moderate to mild carbonation and a medium body make this and alround medium feeling beer. Good for cold rainy nights."
""
""
"Below average porter. It smells undrinkable, though it ends up being drinkable with a decent flavour profile. I enjoy Central Waters brews, especially their Brewer's Reserve series, but man, that smell is just borderline drain-pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall seems to have a noticeable chalky/dry creamer presence while the chocolate malt takes a back seat. Chalkiness takes something away, appearing more off flavor, drinkability is low, not reaching for seconds here. Id take a pass."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is really nice. A bit thin, but quite nice. If you like coffee, then this is for you!"

"If they dialed down the hops a few notches, I could see this being a quite a tasty porter. As is, I'm afraid the balance is too skewed toward the bitter end, which might work with a lighter style, but not with a porter (at least not for me)."

"O: This being y first beer from Central Waters, I would say good job, it was very enjoyable and allowed me to relax a bit while I did some work. A very good porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-	A fantastic American Porter. A delicious Winter Beer with excellent flavor and balance."
"O - The char gets to be a bit too dominating on the aftertaste, but this is otherwise a nice porter. Its held up very well considering its almost a year old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fine beer! I enjoyed this, but overall I found it to be a fine example of the style. This is an excellent winter beer. Please try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Paired this with a fish fry, which was also good going down. This was not the case later that night, thanks to the stomach virus that's been going around."
"A good wintery desert porter. Quite drinkable. Hints at sugary ""dessert beer"" flavors while maintaining a nice level of sessionability."

"O - The bottle advertises ""thick, rocky head," but this bottle failed to deliver that, even after a fairly violent pour. Maybe it was a bum batch. But once I was past that initial disappointment I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It's hopped more than most porters, but it works... no complaints here. This beer is delicious with a good sandwich, so I'll be buying again!"

"I reckon this may be too hoppy a porter for some folks, but it works just fine for me. I'd enjoy this from time to time if I were geographically able. Recommended if you like hoppy porters. Wish I had more of this."
""
""
"Pours out the expected dark brown color, with a single finger of tan head for about a minute, no real lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, a little splash of coffee, and that's about it. I can't really find the expected scent of toasted or roasted malt. Tastes of the roasted malt I was expecting to find in the nose. Further investigation reveals a bit of sweet malt and earthen hopping in the flavor once the beer has warmed up for a bit, and a medium body and carbonation level. Honestly, this is a fairly average porter, it doesn't do much to stand out from the crown IMHO."

"Taste, good easy drinking porter, again, good roasting, run of the mill for a good porter, no alcohol noticeable, above average bitterness. Packs a lot of caramel and toffee into the beer. The chocolate mouthfeel is the kind with no sweetness. Dry. Pretty enjoyable around a campfire when you're just drinking the sessionable stuff. Would drink again, a good example of regular 6 pack porter stuff when you're not looking for barrel aged geekery or whatnot."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate, some coffee notes. Taste is coffee up front, then the chocolate kicking in at the finish. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall a good beer, one that I probably would have enjoyed more in the winter."
""

"A decent porter. Pretty easy drinking, definitely sessionable, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""

""

"Central Waters is my favorite brewery but I had never had their porter before. I found it to be pretty good; nothing great but nothing bad. It was very easy drinking with a nice roasted coffee malty taste. For me to rank a beer really high it has to knock my socks off with the taste or alcohol. This beer didn't do either but it is a very drinkable dark beer if you were looking to knock back a few of them in a row."

"Nice porter!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium-thin bodied with lively but not overly assertive carbonation. Just a touch of creaminess. Finishes clean and dry and is easy drinking and refreshing. A quality porter to be sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a quality porter."
""

"Overall: A really good session porter. I could easily have had a couple more. Hoppier than most porters, and I liked that. A good interpretation of the American Porter style."
"Poured into my brewery snifter, brownish/ black color, light brown head, hint of light peaks through. smells of grain, coffee, burnt sugar.. this beer yearns for a barrel addition.. Taste is about the same as the smell only with a mild sarsaparilla characteristic. mouth feel is a little on the thin side but has a nice creaminess to it as it finishes. Overall, this beer is sessionable but not the best offering ive had from CW."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not too thrilled with the label art or the colors for the labels but at least they managed the important things well."
"O - This is a really nice American Porter. I continue to be impressed with Central Waters beers."
""
"I was able to try the Mudpuppy Porter at Moonshine in the Wicker Park area of Chicago. The beer poured a very nice opaque with finger thick slightly off white head that laced nicely. The smell included sweet malt and sligth roast. The taste was a nice creamy porter with good tones of peat, roast, chocolate and hints of coffee. The mouthfeel was medium body with subtle carbonation. Overall it was a pretty good porter and I would definitely try again."
""
""
""
"Nicely balanced, easy to drink. Hops are in check so flavors remain on the palate for complete enjoyment. There is a mild sweetness topped off with a light smokey flavor. This would be delicious barrel-aged ... I need to put that on my want list. Every porter/stout needs to have a barrel-aged cousin!"
""
"Pours medium brown, but essentially black in the glass, with a finger of tan head; some retention and not much lacing. Smell is sizable roasted malt, touch of dark molasses sweetness and smoke/char which both add nice character. Taste is similar, with some blackened espresso (which is just OK) on the dry finish. Medium body and medium-high carbonation, which a tad high for the style and could use a little more smoothness. Overall, a pretty good porter."
""
""
"Overall a great take on the Robust Porter. Excellent flavors and balance, this is one of my new favorites for the style."
"Overall: Quite simply a very good everyday Porter. Flavorful but remains light and easy drinking."
""
""
"O - Liking the front of the tongue and back of throat the most. Certainly very enjoyable, definitely very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: It's an average porter. There is nothing particularly exotic about it, but that is in no way detrimental. If the upper Midwest didn't already offer such awesome American Porters (Great Lakes, Founders, Tyranena, etc.), I would probably buy this more regularly."
""
"O: It's better than average but not quite a solid good. Definitely an easy drinker and maybe a light introduction to the style or dark beers overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good porter overall. Flavors are very traditional, and it is well-brewed. Does not stand out, but does not disappoint either. Certainly worth trying, though there are many more tantalizing porters worth buying out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A perfectly fine porter. A bit more emphasis on sweet aspects and not as much on roasted flavors as I usually care for. Worth trying, but it's not one worth extensive search."
""
"This beer could possibly put edmund into the back seat as far as porters, although I've not had Edmund from a tap yet."
"Mudpuppy porter pours a black color, with very little head. The smell is thick, lots of malts, a nice coffee undertone, just want you want anything sto smell like really. The taste is full, good heavy malty undetone, with coffee and choclate flavors. Very full porter, no watery taste here. Overall a Fantasic porter."
"O: this is one well put together porter, and one I can highly recommend. Let it warm in the glass a bit, and it will reward you for your patience."
"O: I think its a great example of an American porter. This would definitely be a go-to-beer for me if I'm in the mood for the style."
"O - This is a wonderfully creamy porter that is highly drinkable and hits the right notes."
"Lighter side of mid bodied, good carbonation level. Very nice drinking porter."
"Overall - It's a nice beer when you're looking for something dark and flavorful but not overpowering, overbearing, and chewy. I certainly would pick up more of this if I had access to it. There are porters I feel are better overall than Mudpuppy, but like I said, this one is a good example of the style."
"I was a bit surprised by the nose on this one: This beer is billed as having a luscious chocolate quality in the bouquet, but the main thing I'm registering is soy sauce. It really isn't an unpleasant aroma at all, just a bit unique. Overall, this porter has good balance, very nice flavor, and a drinkability that's often hard to find in this style. Well worth checking out for yourself."
"Overall, this was an enjoyable porter, not quite to the level of Fitz or Founders, but approaching that pretty handily. Between this and Satin Solstice, I like what Central Waters does with dark beers so far."
"Overall- A nice light porter, could easily pass as a brown. Gets better as it warms, and the linger is actually quite strong and very flavorful. The thin-ish body is really the only thing holding this back from being in the top tier of the style."
"This might be my favorite American Porter. I'd take it over Ed Fitz, Anchor, or Sierra any day. After being underwhelmed by my first Central Waters brew, I'm impressed by this one. Will probably buy this again."
"Are we sure this beer's name isn't a euphemism for a toilet log? Anyway, it pours a partially clear dark garnet-sienna topped by a finger of light-ish dusty-tan foam. The nose comprises maple syrup, light molasses, light chocolate powder, cinnamon, brown sugar, and toffee. The taste holds notes of light roasted malt, coffee, toffee, dark chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, and a fairly strong contingent of wood (I'd say oak, but I'm not entirely sure here). The wood and dark-chocolate bitterness combine to take away from the other elements, to the slight detriment of the overall flavor. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice porter, but a bit on the thin side, and the aforementioned flavor issue keeps greatness at bay."
"O- A solid porter, I'm a big fan of the dry, roasted finish, I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting."
"O - Really enjoying this one. CW does it again in my opinion. I love this brew!"
"O- A very solid porter and easy to drink."
"This is a very nice representation of the style, but could use a stronger mouthfeel. It definitely stands out as a quality porter."
"O: All in all this is a nice take at the style, good characteristics of the roasted malt and low hop character. Good brew."
"overall - good, not great."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a decent off brown head on it that leaves a little lacing. Scent has some robust and sweet carmel malts. A bit of a coffee/cocoa scent as well. The robust malts hit the taste buds hard with a good cocoa flavor that is smooth and delicious. Very well made and quite tasty with so much flavor, this is definetly a sipping beer!"
"Drinkability is okay, it's a solid porter, perhaps a bit sweet for my taste."
"D- This beer is very drinkable and has a smooth full roasted malt flavor and it is on the lighter scale of porters. It goes down really fast and I would love to try it on cask."
"This is a weird beer. To me, it drinks like a hybrid between a doppelbock and a porter. The flavors are thin and subdued. Not a big fan."
"D: Nice, rich porter with lots of roasted maltiness flavors. Complex enough to keep you interested, light enough to have more than one."
"Poured a dark dark brown almost black color with a bit of beige head on it. Smell is faint coffee. Taste is alright , not great in my opinion. Pretty bitter, not a ton of flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Decent beer but not great. Worth a try though for sure."
"Next to no head with an admittedly weak pour. Looks like porter. The smell has a slight porter smell to it. Initial taste has a hint of porter mixed with water and vegetation. Succesive sips prove less rewarding. Mouthfeel is similar to Budweiser, not what one would expect from a porter. I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle, as generally I'm not too far of the mark in my opinion. I don't dump beer down the drain, but I was glad when I was finished with this one and moving on to something else."
"Definitely worth trying, a sturdy solid porter."
"Well done. I'd offer that the flavors and aromas would come out better with this force-carbonated, so I'll have to keep an eye open for it."
"3.5 D: This is okay, but it could use some complexity or at least some sweetness. It's not mindblowingly roasty, but the roastiness is amplified due to the lack of everything else."
"D -- Very good. A well balanced offering and well worth the purchase."
"Medium bodied and very roasty up front with lots of toasty burnt malt notes along with hints of smoke, rosted coffee bean and chocolate. There is an earthy bitterness from the hops that compliments the slightly acrid roasted/burnt malt flavor. This is slowly countered mid-palate by a lactic cream profile as well as some silky chocolate, hazelnut and toast. Very dry throughout with a bitter acrid finish. A bit too one dimensional and overly acrid/roasted for my liking making it tough to drink down."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer, as I have with almost all Central Waters beers. A really nice one to enjoy last night."
"Decided to pour this one into a 16 oz mug. Pours a dark brown color, with some maroon edges when held up to the light. I got a finger of tan head that lasted a minute and left a few lace spots a the top of my glass. Some chocolate in the nose, as well as roasted malts and even some coffee hints. Lots of roastiness in the taste, especially upfront. I get some sweetness in the middle, chocolate and even some vanilla, and a fairly hoppy / bitter finish. This is on the upper end of medium bodied, and seems like alot of carbonation for the style."
"Drinkability: Still not getting the CW love. There are many better porters than this one. It's just boring."
"Overall, this is a very tasty brew. I don't drink many porters (as I am more of a big ale or barleywine fan) but this one holds it's own. Well done. I could easily drink a 6-pack of it."
"GOOD STUFF, WORTH TRYING!"
"D-Good beer from Wisy. Mudpuppy"
"D. This is a classic styled Porter through and through that I could drink a 6-pack of in one session without a problem. CW's best year round beer IMHO."
"Overall, my favorite of the Wisconsin Porters, but still would like it to be thicker with more flavor."
"This is one of the best American porters out there."
"D - A very drinkable Porter with enough flavor and complexity to keep you interested. The biggest letdown to me was the thin mouthfeel. I can see myself purchasing this again as a single 12oz, but doubt I will ever grab a 6 pack."
"D- This is a decent to good porter overall. The balance leans toward roasted bitterness but there is enough sweetness to keep it in check. Not super complex- but this is a satisfying porter to keep the coffee beer fans begging for more."
"Another winner from Central Water. Pours a nice dark brown color, small head leaving good lacing. Smells exceptional, roasty and awesome. Taste is great, a bit of burnt roast with a good coffee undertone. Good mouthfeel, a tiny bit watery, but not bad, still has a thick and awesome feel. Super drinkable, I will be picking up a full 6 pack of this next time at the beer store."
"Recomended a nice treat and worth it !!"
"D- Really great drinkable porter, great texture, fantastic smells and flavors, good body, and comes in a nice medium ABV, nice session porter for a nice cool evening."
"D-A really nice porter that's has a pretty high drinkability. I enjoyed this one thoroughly."
"Cheers!"
"(D)- A solid porter with most everything in the right place. A good feel to it for the fall season by a bonfire."
"M/D: Medium to fuller body. A little on the heavier side of medium for carbonation. A little creamy. A little dry, but not too dry. Great drinkability for a porter. Very smooth. After you take a sip you want another one right away, its that good. I could session this."
"D - Solid porter all around with a nice hop character. Not as memorable as their coffee stout, but still quite enjoyable."
"Pours a nice dark brown, almost cola like in color, with a good finger of beige head. Toasty malt, coca and mocha strikes the nose. Creamy cocoa notes at first lead into splendid toffee and coffee finish that lingers well after this one goes down the hatch. A very exceptional porter!"
"Mouthfeel isn't quite full bodied, but slightly above medium bodied. The carbonation is on the lighter side, but i wouldn't call it low. Drinkability is very good, it was a very enjoyable and easy drinking porter with some very nice flavors."
"Roasted grains are the main show in taste as well as rich dark coffee, bitter bakers chocolate. A little bit grassy into the finish with plenty of coffee flavors and lingering bitter chocolate alongside. The coffee seems a bit misplaced and overly strong in flavor. Not that I do not enjoy it, but it is overwhelming the other flavors I was hoping would come out more and are now subdued."
"D - A good session beer as it seems fairly light. Good flavors that should hold up well over the course of more than a few bottles."
"D: Not the most exciting porter on the planet, but there's no doubt I could drink it all night. A good start to my Wisconsin beer odyssey."
"The beer pours medium-dark brown with a small white head. The aroma is caramel and chocolate malts. Very sweet smelling. The flavor is coffee, chocolate and caramel malt with a coffee aftertaste. Light to medium mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation."
"D/O- The first night I ever heard of this was in Wisconsin Dells last summer right on one of the lakes. It was the the only beer I'd never had. It took me 3 of them to decide I really enjoyed that beer :)"
"D: This is a very good example of an american porter, very smooth and easy to drink, not a perfect beer, but certainly worth looking for if you are in Wisconsin. Recommended."
" ~ This beer was my favorite beer throughout college. After I graduated, other beers have come and gone but the Central Waters - Mudpuppy Porter still tops the list. Even as the brewery itself moved from its original home in Junction City to it new home less than 30 miles away in Amherst the beer has maintained its exceptional quality. You'll never hear me decline the offer of this fine porter."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but it has a bit too much carbonation."
"D: As sessionable as a Porter gets. Awesome!"
"D - Very drinkable, delicious, rich, are just some of the adjectives that I would use to describe this beer, but again, I always have to go back to this was not as good as the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, but still an excellent beer"
"This was a nice porter. Central Waters makes a lot of solid brews."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Really smooth and drinkable porter. This was good stuff. Thanks Dan!"
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced. really liked the aroma, but the taste was a bit of a letdown in comparison."
"D: very drinkable and well-made"
"D: Highly drinkable. This beer is very balanced for the style. Not overly coffee or chocolaty and with a lightness that makes it go down easy. Quite enjoyable."
"D-A full-flavoured and eminently quaffable American Porter. This is the kind of beer that becomes an easy go to brew in my book. I will make sure to pick up more next time I am in Wisconsin."
"Nice, easy drinking beer. Looking forward to trying more Central Waters."
"drinkablility is good. a standard porter that is well composed and brings the roasted malts in droves. very easy going and drinkable with a semi-dry character and a nice mix of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate."
"A very sessionable porter, nothing fancy. It really hit the spot..."
"Deep brown color with fluffy tan head. Nice smell of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. A bit of nuttiness. Tastes like an iced coffee. This really reminds me of Surly Coffee Bender. I'm not a big coffee person, but this is nice and refreshing. Just a little thin in the feel. Probably to be expected at this ABV. Pretty smooth though. Absolute session beer. Another solid beer from a hidden gem of a brewery."
"Wow, just a really nice take on an American Porter here from Central Waters. Full flavored, balanced, and quite quaffable, this would be a go-to for the style if it was more local to me."
"D - This is a really good robust porter - very exceptional. It's quite a treat - try it if you can get your hands on some."
"A very solid robust porter - although could be a brown in some attributes. Love what the CW folks are up to - need to take a vaca at their brewery."
"Pours very dark brown with some reddish-orange hues buried deep at the bottle with a two finger, very carbonated head that dissipates quickly leaving lace that refuses to fall. Coffee is quickly picked up by the nose, however, nothing too powerful and a faint chocolate shows up after a couple inspections. The taste is confusing me as the smell of the beer doesn't add up to what I imagined the beer to be; this, however, is not a far from a bad thing as I find that the introduction of hops and low ABV balances out this beer to be easily drinkable. A light mouthfeel doesn't coat the mouth or throat. Solid beer that I could find myself sitting down and having multiples of in one setting."
"This is my first Central Waters brew and I'm looking forward to the other ones now."
"D- A little heavy on the coffe for me, several are fine at a time"
"D: As usual, this is subjective, if you like coffee/dark choco, then yay."
"This is a great beer. I've only had few offerings from CW but so far this is my favorite. It's definately in my top 10 Wisconsin beers."
"This is a solid American Porter, certainly sessionable."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving sticky lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, and a hint of hops. It is very faint though...too faint really. The taste is a little stronger, but still weak for a porter. If I concentrate really hard I can pick up the roasted malt and some cream, and although it is nice it is almost not worth the work. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a less than smooth texture. Overall, this beer is a mild disappointment. I enjoy spending time breaking down a beer, and finding all kinds of nuances in it. But this beer seems like all I'm doing is breaking the beer down without finding anything. I guess this beer isn't bad, and I wouldn't complain to much if I had to drink it again, but I won't be buying it again."
"D - Decent drinkability. This was an okay, middle of the road porter...that being said I am very excited to try the Peruvian Morning I picked up from this brewery."
"D= This was a decent porter but I was ultimately underwhelmed by it. The drinkability was good though, and I could easily session this one if I was in the mood and I liked the flavor/aroma character more."
"Mahogany color with a rim of foam and some lacing in the center of the surface. Flecks of light give some brownish character to the head/beer. The nose is malty with some gentle hops and smoke. Very light body and mouthfeel. Delicate malt structure to the flavor and there is a little bit of a bite at the finish. Very clean and light. Extremely drinkable, but the flavor is somewhat muted due to the lightness of the beer."
"This has lots of potential as a session beer that I could have all fall, winter, and spring."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy light tan head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, with some dark stuff. Medium body. Drinkable, another tasty brew from CW, thanks Randall."
"D--Nice sessionable porter here. There are others I would go to first but I could drink these all night if it was available."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with a large tan head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap with heavy lacing left on the glass surface. The aroma consists of roasted malt. The malt has hints of milk chocolate. Some grass is also detected. Mildly disappointed in the flavor. The malt is rather mild. A little bitterness with an aftertaste of hay or grass. The body is a little thin for the style. Nice carbonation. I was expecting big things from this beer but I was a little let down. Still a solid porter but there are other ones that are much more dynamic and exciting."
"Deep dark color-not quite jet black but pretty dark with a nice tan head on top. Mellow roasted and somewhat metallic aroma. Moderate graininess to it. Solid and mellow roast flavor. Mild chocolate and cocoa flavors. Lingering hop bite in the finish. A tad sweet. Solid mouthfeel, though again a somewhat sweetish feel to it. Overall a decent US porter. Enjoyed this more the 2nd time around."
"Good example of the style. Porters are not that interesting to me but still good."
"Pretty solid Porter indeed. Not the best one out there but it seems like it would be a good option every now and then if it was available here."
"Dark brown, red highlights, very large tan head that left some chunky lacing. Chocolaty aroma with a surprisingly large amount of hoppiness in the nose. Flavor is bitter, roasted maltiness, light chocolate, and plenty of green, herbal hops. Some dark fruits are also in the background, but it's hard to pick up much of these flavors as it's a bit watery. Light bodied and slightly thin for the way I like my porters. Not bad, but not great either."
"The body is moderate and has a nice feel to it. Nice drinkability and carbonation is a bit low but does support. Overall some good, some bad and some alright notes throughout the beer."
"Very nice drinker, a ""session"" porter, well done, great to have a few."
"The taste mimicked the aroma (or vice versa). Burnt coffee and a hint of chocolate. Light mouthfeel helps make this a highly drinkable brew. This is a solid porter and one I will be drinking for as long as they choose to brew it!"
"poured well, little head but laced fairly well. Aroma was nice, like burnt coffee or dark chocolate. tasted of the same, with a caramel or toffee on the back. Not too bitter, enjoyed it the all the way through. A good porter, and a great surprise to find in a coffee/antique shop."
"Notes from: 09/15/05."
"The light body helps with the drinkability, but I'd still like a little more body (as long as it wasn't too rich - and maybe that's the issue on creating a good balance). Good porter all together though and certainly worth seeking and finding."
"D - Because of the bitterness towards the end of this beer it is not as drinkable as others. Overall this is a good beer to enjoy in moderation."
"I have tried many porters and this beer has ruined me for all others. Many are to sweet on the back of my tongue, this beer is a perfect mixture of hearty coffee nutty flavors. Poured pitch black with a oaky head. At the brewery they serve it nitro, which is an entirely new mouthfeel. This is the perfect porter for my pallet."
"I think it is pretty good. I wish the astringent bite was not there. I could drink a couple of these in a sitting. Central Waters is onto something with this brew."
"Body pours pretty much black with only hints of dark brown when held to light. Head easily reaches four fingers and quickly turns rocky like a root beer float. Nose is mouth watering with big tones of carmel syrup, toffee and fudge brownies. Enters the mouth toasty with dry chocolate notes. The nose almost carries the carmalized malts onto the back of the tongue. As it warms a ever so slight sweetness does break through the overall dryness. Mouthfeel follows through with the dry feel but in a comfortable way. This isnt a huge alchol % brew but it demands to sipped and enjoyed slowly."
"I drink this all the time so I was puzzled when I noticed I had yet to review this beer. Poured on tap into a pint glass this has a chocolate brown color with a brown 1 inch head. The aroma is chocolaty with some hints of honey and malt. The taste is sweet with strong notes of chocolate and hints of spice and nuts. The body is medium with mild carbonation. This is just a great session brew."
"D - This is what one expects in an American Porter, sweet and dry, balanced, with all the usual flavors. Aside from the weakish entry, everything is what you would expect, a solid example of the style."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a big thick foamy head on a very dark amber body. Some good cascading here. Smells of buttered bread, caramel, coffee, and a general sweetness. The taste was primarily sweet and coffee. Not very complex. Bit of hop in there as well, and a somewhat odd ""chalky"" finish. Not a bad brew, but having had a Sand Creek Badger Porter just the day before, this one pales in comparison."
"This is a very drinkable porter, i have to restrain myself while typing this review. Almost sessionable with its 5.5% abv, but this would make a great all nighter, especially during the cooler but not quite cold days of spring and fall. Hopefully i can find more of this as this is one of the best porters i have had the pleasure of trying. Highly recommended for fans of the style, there are more robust porters out there, but porters with the balance yet roasted edge and creamy feel of this one are not so easy to come by."
"Overall this was a very solid porter and another knockout from Central Waters. These guys are something to really watch as most everything I have had from them has been excellent. I would love to try some more of their wares as they are becoming more and more solid every day."
"Pours a deep brown with a small tannish head and some lacing. Aroma is sweet chocolatety balck malt, vanilla and dark fruit. The Flavor is initially acidic then a bit sweet choclate. Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Finishes long and bitingly bitter."
"As you bring the glass to your lips the roasty, bready notes leap out of the glass at you. Afairly rich tasting porter, with flavors of roastiness, some coffee, tobacco. Bitter up front, sweet in the middle, with a dryness at the end. For an everyday (non-Imperial) porter, this is pretty good. Recommended."
"If you like a robust porter, this is one heck of a brew!"
"Good Porter, I would drink it again."
"I've been pounding this puppy for years and it remains my favorite American Porter to date."
"A pleasure to drink and savor. I don't normally gravitate towards Porter too much anymore but this is one of the best I've encountered in a long time. Sessionable!"
"D: This is a tasty and respectable porter. Very nice."
"oooh not so happy with this so very unfortunately. Diaceytl (sic?) characeristics brusquley intrude. Me no likey. I'm certain that there are other good qualities to this brew, but for me the butterscotch stuff supecedes. Does pour with a nice fine head and a bit o lace. Opaque brownish black. and dat be all I say. good bye."
"I'll have an edited review up by Friday with the second bottle. Hopefully for the better."
"Pours a deep and dark brown that reveals itself as more of a medium black leather. Quickly shows a mild three-quarter ring around the beer with medium island in the middle and very, very light lacing. The aroma is strong coffee with hint of cocoa and a dabble of cream. The taste is an upfront bitter coffee flavor. Like thedark roasted malts mixed with the hops to make a realistic coffee bitterness. With a rocky roastd malt finish with notes of light milk chocolate and vanilla Silk. The palate has great carbonation interlaced with a strong, dark malt profile with well integrated hops."
"I could and will drink quite a little bit of this bad boy."
"Thanks to EliteDigger for this as an extra."
"Well carbonated for a porter but just a slight sting on the tongue."
"A touch overcarbonated in my estimation but the body sits just right. As the taste grows on me so does the drinkability."
"Thanks Dan, this is the first Central Waters beer I've ever reviewed... I am pretty impressed.. Can't wait to try the Charlies."
"The taste has coffee and a roasted/burnt malt flavour up front with some milky flavour in the background. The roasted malt is quite bitter but works well with the semi sweetness of that milky flavour. It finishes very dry, from the roasted malt, and leaves a nice lingering aftertaste. Nice Porter with a medium mouthfeel and fairly low carbonation. I'm certainly glad I got to try it."
"Central Waters has really made an impression in my book with their Mudpuppy, Satin Solstice, BB Stout, Kosmyk Charlie, etc. lineup. Excellent and solid throughout."
"D: One bottle is enough for now but I do want to try it again."
"D: HUGE fan of this porter. Best Ive had in a while. Highly recommend."
"12 oz bottle. It pours a ruby-hued deep brown color with a finger of light tan head. There is a moderate carbonation in there and the clarity appears to be fairly good, but the darkness makes it hard to tell. I find a light chocolate and roast with a ton of lacto sweetness and some butterscotch notes as well. The flavor is again very butterscotch sweet with noticeable lacto sweetness, with a more subdued chocolate, a slight sharpness from roast that melds well with a solid hop bitterness on the finish. My initial thought on this one was the it was rife with diacetyl, but I really think it is an overpowering lacto character that I am getting. Either way, it is not me favorite. Mouthfeel is on the light end of moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, I just can't get past the overriding lactose sugar quality I am finding. It overpowers the brew and really gets in the way of the chocolate and roast notes I want to find. I would not get this one again."
"Enjoyed on my summer joy ride through the state of Wisconsin, thanks to the ""Mayor of Hammertown (in Wisc.)"" for the hospitality and fine Central water beers. This one was sampled on tap and bottles, this is a review of the bottled version. 12 ouncer, poured dark dark, brown/amber, with a initially puffy dark tan head, leaves plenty of sheeting, then fine lacing. Nose is pure chocolate, yum. Lots of chocolate, some vanilla, cocoa, dark toasty/crusty malts. Nice, malty, flavorful, chocolate milk shake style porter. Smooth and filling, with a late hop bite and dry out. Nice."
"This pour beers a somewhat inky black, with a head that just never seems to quit. Aroma is somewhat roasty, but an inadequate prelude to the flavor, which is light and drinkable but also somewhat roasty. This beer is very drinkable (more than I expected for a porter) yet also decently flavorful. A bit odd for the style, but fairly pleasantly surprising."
"D- It is a nice porter. Easy to drink and a nice blend of flavors."
"Very good. Seems filling, but isn't. Fantatic flavor, very true to style."
"Medium mouth with some bitterness on the short finish. Would like to try again too see if I may have had a bad bottle."
"The on-tap version is superior."
"Drinkability - a tasty beer, thanks to thefatkid13 for the trade!"
"This beer is all about dark roasted, chocolate grains. I comes close to the fine line between porter and stout with some of the grains, but still won't be mistaken for anything but a porter. The grains aren't particularly innovative and there isn't any crazy dry-hopping. But there's a dark, rich flavor, backed by an intense bitter cocoa and coffee aftertaste. Consider that the body is quite drinkable and that the ale is pleasing to the eye, and you've got a winner."
"Mouthfeel is creamy milk smooth & medium-light in feel. Carbonation is light/medium & feels just right to me. Very easy to drink."
"Thanks to nflmvp for sending this my way. Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Sierra Nevada shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a translucent dark brown color with about half an inch of tan foam that disappears within a minute. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and molasses are most evident. Tastes primarily of rich roasted malt followed by bitter coffee and cocoa with maybe a touch of vanilla. Creamy mouthfeel, bordering on full bodied with medium to moderate carbonation. One of the best in it's style. Highly recommended if you can score some. I'm going to enjoy the last half or so of my glass with a chocolate almond biscotti."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" brown head over the almost opaque brownish burgundy brew. Head fades slowly, with lots of lacing. Aroma is powdered chocolate, with darkly vinous notes. Taste finds the same parts as the nose, but the dark fruits overpower the malts, providing a tartness that I can't really appreciate in a porter. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both quashed somewhat by the tartness which just invades most all for me after I get it in my mouth."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a fluffy tan head, and great lacing. Dark chocolate, toffee and molasses in the nose. Solid flavour. Strong, coffee, roasty and bitter, with a dry finish. Great mouthfeel and body. Also has a nice initial sweetness in each sip. Quite well hopped for a porter, and I like it. Very nice porter. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is thin, somewhat creamy, bolstered by that roasty aftertaste. It's not as thick as a stout, though the flavor makes up for the less robust mouthfeel. Highly drinkable, this 6-pk. disappeared quickly from the hoard after a recent WI road trip."
"A very solid porter and quite easy to drink. I'd like to have a few more, but am pleased to have had the opportunity to try the one."
"Great stuff."
"overall, i am impressed and proud that this comes from my home state, definitely give this a try!"
"single 12 oz. bottle smuggled back from my last trip to Madison"
"D - A very tasty porter. Possibly a bit too dry and hoppy to be my everyday porter but good none the less."
"I was hoping Central Waters's Mud Puppy Porter would give Lake Louie's Tommy's Porter a serious run for its money. It doesn't, but it's still a delicious version that has no trouble at all holding down second place in the great beer state of Wisconsin."
"Recommended to me by an extremely helpful clerk at Riley's Wines of the World in Madison, WI, who said it was one of his favorite go-to beers. Pours dark with a nice big creamy head. Smells nutty, chocolately and roasty. Taste is very nice. Bitter roasted coffee flavor with some bitter chocolate nut taste too. Not too thin, not too thick, good carbonation. A nice example of the style from a tiny little brewery in WI. Definitely would drink this again."
"Aroma is sweet cream and milk chocolate with little in the way of roasty notes. A dark brown body holds a pinky thin creamy, tan head. Fore flavor is very brown ale like..nutty, malty, peanut skin, biscuity with just a tinge of tartness. Not bad, but not very porter-like."
"Unfortunately I only have a few bottles with no other way of obtaining them, otherwise this would be a staple in my fridge."
"12 ounce bottle. Mud Puppy Porter pours out a very dark brown color with a big, creamy head. Very strong citrus in the aroma, along with chocolate and cherries. Good roasted flavor, but a little too tangy and fruity. I would have liked more emphasis on the roasted chocolate flavor. Finishes with flavorful hops, but not overwhelmingly hoppy. Mouthfeel is a tad thin. This is a very good porter with many interesting flavors."
"pretty good, and definately interesting porter...central waters has some good stuff if you can track it down"
"Mouthfeel is velvetty and silky smooth with a mild sweetness and bitterness, along with a semi-dry finish. Full bodied and nice with a slight fizz on the swallow."
"Looks very pretty, just like I'd want a porter to--extremely dark brown that glows a beautiful red where the light comes through. Nice tan head. Smells roasted and burnt, very refreshing after my unfortunate dalliance with Baltic porters yesterday. Tastes very nice, burnt coffee and bitterness. The only drawback is occasional flashes of alcohol. Mouthfeel is full and lively. Ah yes, my old friend the porter, reconstructed faithfully by Central Waters. Very smooth, a lovely beer."
"Pours a deep brown with a decent tan head which fadesrather quickly but leaves some good lacing. Nose is robust, strong roasted coffee and bitter chocolate with a hint of hops. Taste follows suit with a yummy mix of burnt coffee and dark chocolate. Not overwhelming, but strong - good for a porter. Mouthfeel is medium, a little creamy and a little thin. Drinkability is very good, could have finished a sixer with ease. Overall a solid porter from Central Waters, a little Wisconsin brewery which I've been impressed with to date. Not the best porter I've had, but not bad by any means...give it a try if you can find it."
"This puppy ain't muddy at all. Thanks jeffboo! Great stuff!"
"Pours a nice black color, with a small bubbling head. Smells hoppy and of burnt malts. Taste is mainly burnt malts, strongly balanced with hops. Dont get me wrong this is a hoppy porter, but not overpowering, works very well here. Would like to try this on tap after just having the oktoberfest at the bar"
"I could drink this every day !"
"12 ounce bottle, thanks to Skidz and BIF10."
"Silky smooth, crisp and clean in the mouth. Carbonation is exactly where it should be; nothing getting in the way of the taste. It's very hard to set this down, as it goes down so easy. A 6 pack for the evening is definately a good idea. A classic porter, very comparable to St. Peter's Old Style Porter, which also stands out in front of the pack."
"This brew is a dark dark brown with a good tan head and lacing up and down the glass. Aromas of hops and chocolate appear when smelled. Starts out with a bitter hops followed smoothly by a dry chocolate finish ending on the sweeter side. Sits in the mouth well extremely creamy porter that was very enjoyable. Could drink multiple ones of these, not as filling as most porters for me."
"A hoppier porter than most, especially in its aroma.  This beer pours a dark leather brown with a nice frothy tan head that reduces but lingers.  The somewhat floral hop aroma dominates at first but then roasted malt comes through.  The taste is well-balanced, but I prefer more roasted malt flavor.  The body is a bit thin as well.  Still this is one of the better porters being brewed in Wisconsin right now and it is very drinkable."
"In the end, not the ultimate porter but still tasty and very drinkable."
"The color is dark ruby.  The beer throws a great tan head with good retention.  Aroma is chocolatey and a bit hoppy (guessing cascade because this smells similar to Sierra's porter).  This beer has a very creamy mouthfeel.  Beautiful.  Taste is robust.  Chocolate notes are evident.  Nice bitterness.  I tend to like hopped up porters and this one seems to be on high range for hopping in a porter.  Really smooth and drinkable.  Very good porter."
"I'm working my way through some Wisconsin Micros..this at first try appears to be a solid one.."
