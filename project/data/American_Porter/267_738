Look no further because this is the Porter for you. As the description says, it's definitely not a stout and is a straight shooting Porter that will satisfy any beer snobs palette. Smooth mouthfeel, dark and robust flavor, I want one now that I'm writing this review. Go out and get yourself one.","Grant_Satterthwaite","Mar 24, 2015"

It is a nice drinking porter that provides a solid, if somewhat simple, flavor and nice drinkability.","spoony","Mar 22, 2015"

Aroma is rich and roasty; dark chocolate, light roast coffee, a little bready. Flavor is pretty similar with a dominating roast throughout that is continually evolving; starts of with the dark chocolates with some coffee hiding out underneath, but things progress the flavor tend to trade spots and a nice light roasted coffee grinds takes the forefront with the dark chocolate hiding out underneath. A touch bready I suppose, a touch of brown sugar too. The roast can provide a touch of mild bitterness to it as well. A medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a fantastic porter here.

Served a little cold with a smallish tan head that slowly settled and lots of lace. Color is a very hazy dark garnet brown. Aroma is classic cocoa, malt, roast, coffee. Flavor is likewise standard high end porter, like nose, hint sweet, good carbonic tang, some astringency and spot on bitter. Body is almost faultless - there's a suggestion of bandaid that just barely throws it off kilter. Carbonation is perfect. Finish is like flavor, of average length, and super drinkable.

4.12,0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Odell Cutthroat Porter: It’s hard to review a style of beer that you do not drink regularly, as there is no benchmark to compare to. I really enjoyed this Porter, so other brands will be tested. The Cutthroat Porter is black in color with a tan lumpy head that fades but laces the glass well. The aroma is banquet of stuff: roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, coffee, cigarette butts all coming and going. How do they pack so much into one beer? The flavor is very similar, lots of roasted malt, yeast, spices, coffee, and chocolate, all evenly distributed. I was having pizza with the Cutthroat, which did not go well together, and when I hit a hot red pepper, my beer review had to end. I could taste nothing else but fire. Anyway, I had enough time with the Odell Porter to learn that Porters are a wild ride, greatly enjoyable, and the Cutthroat will be tested again and again.","iSip","Dec 06, 2011"

Flavor packs three strong components: roast malts (more like burnt bread than coffee), powerful sweet flavors, all offset by some strong hoppy bitterness.

Mouthfeel was medium and the roastiness was immediately notable on the tongue. Now, it really tasted like coffee! Man, this was a great pick-me-up on a slow afternoon.

The smell, again, is what is expected of a porter. It has chocolate, coffee, and a hint of licorice. Nothing is overwhelming about this beer, though. It isn't too much of anything, and I like that. The taste is black, chocolate, and possibly coffee malt. Again, it is just right. This beer might become one of my staples, if I can find it nearby in SoCal.

This beer pours a Cuban Coffee brown with a rich dark toffee head that leaves a substantial amount of lacing for a Porter. The aroma can only be described as decadent. Dark chocolate, mildly astringent espresso, heavy cream, hot chocolate and whipped cream. In most beers, when I say that the flavor is exactly the same as the aroma, it's almost a negative thing. Like they show all their cards before the hand is played, but with Odell Cutthroat Porter it exactly the opposite. This beer is beautiful. Its like a DDR party in my mouth. Milk chocolate, espresso, sweet cream, a hint of baker's chocolate and heaven. The mouthfeel is just a wee bit light for me. I wish there would be just a bit more body to it but honestly this is really just nit picking the beer.

On the first sip, taste is quite similar to the nose, with the oak being the most prevalent flavor. Suitably bitter, a good taste for a typical American porter. Mouthfeel is full and bright, which makes this a surprisingly refreshing beer. I'd say the overall drinkability is pretty good, and this is one that I'll continue to buy.","Rchap1","Jan 12, 2009"

Dark malts of roasty goodness in the taste, chocolate and coffee notes, lots of bitterness here, and dry, a bit astringent to a degree, fairly smooth and full bodied but could be more so for both.

After sampling many Porters on this particular night, this one takes a back seat compared to other American Porters we had. The malts take a chocolate-heavy malt character, with undertones of Columbian coffee, buttery pecans, and milk sugars. The hops certainly balance the sweetness, but do little to bring flavors and nearly no aromatics. The beer is lighter in body and color; reminescent of Engish-type Porters. The roastiness is very smooth, allowing the beer's body to become more apparent. The beer is thin, but malty; making it very easily drinkable. Nice beer, just on the lighter scale of most Porters; especially American varieties.","BEERchitect","Sep 12, 2007"

Opaque black color with brown highlights and a cream colored, rocky, velvety head with good lacing. The smell is nutty, yeasty and full of coffee and chocolate. The taste is wonderful, with milk chocolate, dark chocolate, coffee, and nutty flavors with some dark fruits and a juicy hop bite. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, with velvety carbonation.

Mouthfeel was very creamy due to the nitro and it was appreciated but I wonder what the beer was like naturally and why the need for nitro? I liked this beer mostly except for the smokiness. I am also not sure if I like nitro, what is the point, cant they just cask it? The cask IPA I had at Odells was so creamy I cant imagine a better mouthfeel.","ArrogantB","Jul 02, 2007"

It was well balanced and had a good bite without a too bitter finish. This is a style that has moved to my top 3-4 and this is a great example of that style.

Dark tan head, only about a finger width, and recededs quickly. Light lacing around the edge of the glass. Smell is a robust chocolate malt with a little bit of mocha coffee around the edges. Taste is very full, much like the smell. Finishes clean, very little after taste. Not too complex of a flavor, pretty strait forward. Mouthfeel was a little too light.

Haven't had a porter in a couple months and this one reminds me why I love the style so. Carbonation is straight on, just enough to give a slight crispness to the brew, but nothing overly filling.

A beautifully set up, organized and well-run first class operation! Bins full of imported English malts, a huge variety of hops and all the bells and whistles. They make wonderful beers, ales, stouts and this Porter: In appearance it is an almost black brown, with a mass of coffee au lait foam that is sticky and long lived. It has the aroma of roasted Arabica coffee with rich cream, and dark malts. Body is medium, carbonation perfect for the style. Initial taste is of black coffee, slightly bitter, but balanced with enough malt to keep it in line. There are enough hops, and hints of toffee, basil/mint and burnt sugar. Finish is pleasant enough to cause one to want more. Would go well with a strong, spicy cuisine. Excellent!","palliko","Jul 23, 2005"

It was topped by an attractive fine light tan head that left very nice lacing. The nose consisted of luxurious creamy milk chocolate and creamed coffee notes. On the palate, this beer presented an excellent dry roasted coffee and cola malt base, accented with root beer sasparilla and nutty almond, and finished with a well-done bitter finish. Deftly crafted, this beer didn't rely on massive flavors to impress. I really enjoyed the dryness, flow, and balance of the flavors. As such, it drank quite well.

Earthy and floral British hop nose is accompanied by a dark chocolate - like aroma from the roasted grains.  Along with the chocolate malt, there's a hint of black patent sharpness in there that works quite well.  Medium bodied with an excellent balance of roasted grain and hop bitterness.  Dark chocolate flavors persist throughout the sip.  Finishes with a tingle of hop bitterness and subtle sweetness.  Not overdone like many microbrewed porters I've had.
