4.24,-0.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Exceptional porter. I've heard people compare it to North Coast's Old Rasputin but I have to say this is better. Smoother, more complex hop character and a wonderful mouthfeel characterize this brew. Inky black with a tinge of ruby red at the edges, it's a beauty to behold. Very bittersweet, malts and hops have good balance. Haven't been disappointed in any of Great Lakes beers thus far.","kgammell1","Apr 01, 2015"

Taste is sweet malts forward, chocolatey, roasted  nice balance with hops mid taste, a hint of salty soy sauce, with a hint of citrus/pine without being jarringly bitter and a clean, dry finish. Medium bodied with mild effervescence, very smooth and. Increases in complexity as it warms. Overall, great representative of this beer variety, price point is good for such an incredible beer.

The coffee and bakers chocolate notes are apparent from the nose on this, and come right through from the first sip. There is a reassuringly medium body here - with appropriate carbonation.

The aroma is that of bittersweet chocolate and dates, and a touch of something like black cherry. The flavor is phenomenal, especially for a low ABV porter! An initial burst of dark cocoa and dash of chocolate gives way to a grainy base. There is a mouth feel that is soft, much like chocolate mousse. The entire effect actually is a creamy, dairly like one. The mouth feel is rather light, it's not very strong or syrupy at all, but as I mentioned it has a great taste, leaving nothing to be desired. A great anytime beer for dark brew lovers.","Neorebel","Oct 19, 2014"

Pours black with a khaki head. Aroma is roasty with dark chocolate, fruits, and some coffee. Also there is a good dose of sweet sugars. Flavor followed suit and was completely derailed by the presence of a high concentration of sugars. Seemed to me like the recipe is a good one but there was an issue with the brewing process. A heavy mouthfeel. Overall, thought this had glimpses of being the great porter everyone makes it out to be but derailed by some intense sugars. Maybe I will give this another shot in the future but for now I will stick with the amazing Founders Porter for my porter fix.","denver10","Jul 25, 2014"

Drinks somewhere between Rogue's Mocha Porter and Mad River's Steelhead Scotch Porter.","TheSixthRing","Jun 06, 2014"
4.57,7.5,4.75,4,4.75,4.75,4.75,"One word...awesome! Another great beer from Great Lakes. This porter was poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Nice roasty, sweet smell you would expect from a good porter. Poured a great dark brown/ black color with a good, lasting tan head. Taste was complex, malty, and dark chocolate flavored with the roasted barley really coming through at the end. Nice mouthful of beer, but after two you would be full. Overall, this is an awesome porter that I definitely recommend.","the_appalachian","Jun 06, 2014"

4.16,-2.1,4.5,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"To say that this is one of the most beautiful pours I have ever seen is an understatement. This ale pours a very dark rich mahogany with a thin off white head that leaves a gorgeous silky lacing. The aroma is that of lightly brewed coffee, European dark chocolate, and toasted malts. The nose is lighter than expected but quite delicious none the less. The flavor follows the nose perfectly but with a greater intensity. It begins with coffee then gives way to sweeter chocolate and malty notes and finishes with a just slightly bitter coffee bite. My only complaint is that the body is so light. II'd love to have these flavors coat the palate and last far longer than they do. Great porter! Worth every accolade it has received.","lochef81","Mar 20, 2014"
4.07,-4.2,4,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"Just had this brew. Pours deep, deep brown bordering on black. Light does make its way through the sides of the glass creating the glow of brown. Light tan head, this beer creates a beautiful sticky spotty sheating down the glass. Not really dark enough for my eye but the lacing makes up for this. The aroma brings scents of chocolate, bitter bakers cacao, roasty notes, and clean yeast. Does not really jump out of the glass. The flavor is fairly basic, but that is a strong point. Cocao, chalky notes, clean un-bitter roast, and coffee. Nice porter. The mouthfeel is basic, medium to full bodied, moderat carbonation. Overall the strength of this beer is that it is perfectly unremarkable. That sounds bad, but it isn't.","pmlondrigan","Mar 20, 2014"

3.99,-6.1,3.75,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark, coffee brown with a small head of medium sized, tan bubbles and a middling retention. In body, the beer appears clear but nearly opaque from its darkness, slight hints of ruby and garnet can be seen when held to the light, but no particles seem to be present. On the nose, the beer smells of toasted oatmeal bread, rich caramel sauce, soft burnt popcorn, and fresh coffee beans moving into instant coffee mix. Light dark chocolate can be sensed from time to time in the nose, but the overall impression is of instant coffee, toast, and caramel sauce. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet with a nice roasted bitter finish. Just a touch of acidity and a little hop bitters can be sensed in the beer towards the finish. In flavor, the beer begins as burning caramel sauce, working into light roast coffee, caramel malt, and a touch of herbal bitter hops. Light burnt popcorn flavors can also be sensed. The finish is of a middling length and is herbal bitters mingling with burnt black malt, touches of coffee, and just a hint of dark chocolate. The aftertaste is nearly non-existent. In the mouth, the beer feel on the light side of full-bodied, with a very smooth, silky mouthfeel that is just gently chewy. Carbonation is middling with a soft prickly scrub on the palate. The mouth is left a little wet with saliva but only a soft astringency on the tongue, and little else. Overall, this is a nice porter. I could put a couple of these back on a cold winter’s day and be happy, and this would pair very nicely with a thick stew or shepherd’s pie. It’s not my favorite in the style, honestly, but I think that is because it is so classically “a porter” that it doesn’t stand out much to me. I would have this again for sure, but I don’t know if I would buy it again.","Maxwell","Jan 09, 2014"

Pours a rich, dark brown verging on black with fluffy tan head that's quick to dissipate. Sweeter on the nose than one might expect, with milk chocolate and caramel malts giving way quickly to lightly roasted coffee. Not a terribly strong aroma. The taste follows the nose more or less: chocolate, caramel, roast malts with a slightly bitter coffee aftertaste that does quite linger as long as I want it to. It's nuanced and complex, but I'll agree with a previous review who called the flavors ""muted"" somewhat. It just doesn't have that big punch that I want in a porter. Still, a well-balanced and very enjoyable beer.","xabyss","Dec 04, 2013"

4.19,-1.4,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"one of the classic American porters here, a longtime staple of great lakes brewing. best on tap, it pours nearly black, not as thick as some, but impenetrable to light and sporting a cool inch of khaki head on it that leaves prominent lacing as it sips. massive dark roasted barley flavors, dry and bitter, with generous hops for the style. the ale yeast marries the grain perfectly, and its a really smooth a robustly flavored result, almost smoky, almost cocoay, almost charred. I really like the combination of depth of flavor and drinkability in this beer, which is only medium bodied, quick finishing for a porter, and ultra smooth texturally. well enough carbonated, this coal colored porter is a standby in colder weather for me, creamy and satisfying. definitely the beer by which all other American porters should be judged, it is spot on in every aspect. also great on a hangover!","StonedTrippin","Nov 03, 2013"

But I can say now...I agree with most others on this brew. It is a water mark for porters....if someone were to ask me for a standard porter; I would give them this. Its just thick enough....just deep enough...just enough malts and hop bite. It wont change your life...but it may change the porter you drink :) and the drinkability is awesome....six pack worhty for sure...","chuck-chillout","Aug 20, 2013"

Anticipated a nice dark beer and found this to be a nice choice, not far from a typical Guinness - however it's porter style instead of a dry stout which makes this slightly 2nd choice for me. The taste is very dark and robust with a slight bittersweet twang at the end. A fan of dark beer and this one is average in it's class and far from disappointing - would buy again.","json83","Jul 10, 2013"

This is exactly like a hearty stout without being nearly as heavy on body or senses, yet still tenfold in flavor. Not sure how they did it, but I think the well rounded carbonation, as well as the excellent ingredients they're using here, helped it out.

The creamy flood of coffee and chocolate are well-balanced, but in some way individually bold. From start to finish, it is an overly enjoyable experience. This is how a porter should taste.

Aromas are smoky, with roasted malts, and baker's chocolate. Robust flavors of roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, caramel, and smoke, meld together with perfect balance. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, definitely a world-class American porter. I always love going back to this one time and time again.","barnzy78","Mar 24, 2013"

I can get it for $7.49/6pk here in Madison, WI and there's no question that's one the best values I've come across. As for beer aesthetics, the only thing that it could possibly improve on is small potatoes- if it were a bit more creamy and fuller bodied, it would be perfect.","Stevedore","Mar 03, 2013"

It was one of the few beers they stocked in the Porter or Stout category. I'm glad I did purchase it. It pours very nicely with just the right amount of head. The smell is superb and gives hints of chocolate and malt. I found that the taste was slightly behind the smell but not far. It still has a great taste and a nice chocolaty finish. I found this beer to be a great go-to even when other Porters or Stouts are available. I think I will add this to the ""grab it if they've got it"" list for my wife when she makes her trips to the store for me.","centurian62","Feb 28, 2013"

Not much of a nose to this offering, maybe a touch of roast. The flavor was roasty, but not quite what I would term robust. There was a very interesting combination of dry bitterness and sweet milk on the finish. A solid porter, but not the best around.","57md","Jan 21, 2013"

Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toffee, toast, coffee, cocoa, and light herbal. Light amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, toast, roasted malt, toffee, coffee, and light herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of robust flavors with nice roasted malt complexity; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish.

A thin, light, filmy, off-white head quickly settles into a surface coating. Aromas of rich cocoa and baker's chocolate, with an undertone of roast coffee. A very rich and balanced nose. Flavors ride a sharp, crisp body, with roast coffee in the forefront, supported by bittersweet chocolate deep in the backbone. Very light, crisp body propelling the flavors across the palate. The dominating bitter from the coffee and chocolate holds strong through the aftertaste, with a touch of milk chocolate dipped at the end.

Thicker consistency, but too much carbonation too quickly. Big coffee flavor. Some lactose, but not enough, in my opinion. The coffee flavor is nice, but the coffee acidity is barely tempered by the creaminess. The carbonation tends to overpower the lactose feel and flavor. It's ok. I was excited to get the chance to try it again. I'd had it several years ago. But, more recently, there's been quite a bit of hype about it.

4.37,2.8,3.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Edmund Fitzgerald pours out a deep brown color capped with a small head. The aroma is nice and roasty, with chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. The taste is excellent, it's got such a strong and well-balanced coffee and chocolate aspect that calls back to my first introduction to porters and stouts. To bring that kind of flavor intensity after how far my beer journey has progressed is impressive to say the least. It doesn't go beyond the base porter flavors of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate, but it does it so well. The mouthfeel is spot on, it's medium bodied and the carbonation level perfectly compliments the flavor. The drinkability is very good. Edmund Fitzgerald is just a world-class porter. It doesn't venture outside the box of what a porter should offer, but is so refined that I can't help but wonder how any other porters sell in areas that Edmund Fitzgerald is available.","shand","Oct 20, 2012"

4.09,-3.8,4,3.75,4.25,4,4.25,"Update: 11/16/13... I had three of these tonight after picking up a six pack, and I have to say that this doesn't taste like I remembered, but more like I figured it should, given the fact that it's a porter. First of all, the flavor is lighter than I remember. There's also more carbonation, and there's a smokey character to it that I don't recall getting. It's still a really tasty beer, but really not nearly as awesome as I initially thought. Maybe it's because I got it on tap the first time, but yeah. For a porter, it's on-point. With a name like Edmund Fitzgerald though, I'd expect it to be a stout... really heavy, thick, and high ABV. Definitely one of the best porters I've had, but it's not what I remember. I will repeat again saying that this is a great sessionable porter with a nice smokey twist. P.S., I've found out why this beer is called Edmund Fitzgerald. I'm an idiot.","Alextricity","Sep 07, 2012"

Pours the darkest brown I have ever seen from a beer, with a quarter finger worth of tan head. The head seemingly only half forms at first, but comes through in the end. Leaves a decent amount of lacing, mostly in the bottom of the glass. Smells of dark fruits, slight vanilla, toasted malt, toasted caramel, and slight coffee. The taste hits you with a strong coffee flavor upfront, followed by a hit of burnt malt and dark fruit. Finishes with a medium bitterness. The mouthfeel bring a ton of dark cherry into the equasion, and adds an even heavier bitterness. Reminded me of a Dunkel. Overall, this was a good porter, but I wouldn't choose it over Gonzo.","SometimesIfart","Aug 21, 2012"

Flavor was spot on also. Dark chocolate, licorice, and just a hint of root beer were flavors that all melded well together. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than other porters I have had recently, but conversely it made this beer even smoother to drink. Lastly, this beer had one of the smoothest finishes I have had with a porter. There was no roasted aspect left on your palate at all in the end. A very clean finish.

3.67,-13.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark molasses color with a light tan head that is achievable with a moderate pour. Aroma is a blend of black coffee and bittersweet chocolate in similar measure. It tastes similar to its smell, though not quite as pleasing. The roasted coffee flavor overshadows the chocolate notes that I prefer, and both of those have a healthy dose of hops to compete with, which I find to be fairly high for a porter (though it does segway fairly seamlessly into the bitter coffee flavor). The last time I had this I thought the hop presence was way too unbalanced, though this serving has a lesser disparity than I remember. Carbonation is pretty lively for a porter, and a slightly sticky residue persists on the lips. This brew is flavorful to be sure, but it fails to take advantage of the aspects of porter that I most enjoy, leaving me ultimately a little disappointed. No disrespect intended, but I can't really justify the very high esteem in which this beer is held by many.","MaximalC","Mar 07, 2012"

4.35,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at Owen and Engine in Chicago. Pours a dark cola color with tightly bubbled head and good lacing. Aromas are rather subdued with notes of chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malt, and a hint of bacon. Taste is cocoa, espresso, mild hop bitterness, with some smokeyness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with dry finish. A very nice subtle but complex American Porter.","coldriver","Feb 15, 2012"

Yeah, this is goood.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"
4.62,8.7,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a nice deep cola brown with hints of red when held up to light. The head was thick, creamy looking with lots of retention and lingered for quite a while. The smell is toasted and roasted grain with a hint of coffee and chocolate. The beer tastes chocolatey and grainy up front with hints of a milky creaminess. The middle rounds out a bit with some cola like flavors and the end finishes burnt, smoky, and crisp. There is just enough hop presence in the flavor to balance everything out and provide enough bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy yet light. The carbonation is at a good lower to medium level. Okay, this is a fantastic American porter and I have never had it before. This is actually my first try and wow is it ever delicious. I have only had two beers from this brewery but both seem wonderful. I love it.","jifigz","Feb 15, 2012"

Taste comes in clean and fresh at first, then I get roasted flavors, some nice sweetness, a touch of smoke, hop bitterness. This is a really well made porter, especially if you prefer smokey/roasty over thick/sweet. I rather enjoy it.","gkunkle","Feb 07, 2012"

It’s a very drinkable dark beer that you can enjoy a number of and not fill up on.

4.25,0,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A superb porter. Edges out Founder's, which I also tried tonight in a head to head competition with E.F. The color is not fully opaque and shows hints of root beer redness at the bottom of the glass or when held to a light. Rich pour with a frothy head that subsides pretty quickly but leaves an intricate lace. Smells of dry spice, chocolate, and herbal/mint undertones. Taste is just great: coffee, spice, a hint of vanilla, and slight, hoppy mint. No unwanted fruitiness or sweetness. Finishes slightly dry after a spiky carbonation really opens the beer up in the mouth. Can't say enough, really. The mouthfeel is great with an effervescence not expected in this style of beer. This is on the top of my porter list so far. If you like a fine porter, look no further.","MNJR","Nov 09, 2011"

4.11,-3.3,4,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Edmund Fitzgerald pours not quite stout black, with just a sliver of cherry highlights peeking through from the bottom of the glass. The foam that caps the beer is light tan in color, and falls just short of two fingers in height. Head retenetion is well above average, and the beer leaves a fairly good sized ring of suds stuck to the inside of the glass. The nose is a bit weak, and almost reminds me of a milk stout. It's very heavy on milk chocolate, with only a cursory appearance from a coffee aroma. Fortunately, the smell didn't begin to do Edmund Fitz justice. The flavor palate, is all chocolate and coffee, but it's... just about perfect. A not overly sweet chocolate flavor takes the lead on each sip, before a slightly bitter, perfectly roasty note of coffee comes in to close things out. The two couldn't be any better balanced. The body is pleasantly full and chewy for a beer that falls short of 6%ABV, with a low-moderate level of carbonation that fits the beer like a glove. I'd heard a lot of people call Edmund Fitzgerald the best/one of the best American Porters out there, and after having my first I totally get that. This is the rare beer I'd find myself buying on a very regular occasion if it was distributed in these parts.","axeman9182","Sep 28, 2011"

The aroma explodes with dark roast coffee and chocolate notes, with a hint of resinous hops lurking in the background. The flavor is even more roasty, brimming with bitter espresso beans paired with a slightly sweet chocolate aspect. Earthy and complex but with lighter, citric brightness coming through as well. Full body and big, chewy mouthfeel for a relatively small beer. That's what makes this beer so great I think, they've packed all the flavor and complexity of a ""big"" beer into one that only packs a moderate ABV punch.","goldbot","Sep 26, 2011"

Medium thick yet creamy in texture, no complaints about the body. Smells of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. To further elaborate, it smells of really *well* roasted coffee that hasn't been pushed all the way to burnt black, and really *good* dark baking chocolate. Taste follows the nose, but also includes a hopping note that comes across as almost a sort of light psuedo-woody and bark tone accent. Which actually fits quite well in line with everything else.

I think it really deserves its rating as it has a nice creamy medium mouth feel to it where other porters I have tried are much more watery. The aromas and tastes are spot on for a porter, the latter being very well balanced.

Smokey, malty, and roasty with some hops sneaking out from underneath. Notes of caramel, cocoa and yes, cream. Taste is yummy. Smokey hickory, malty goodness, sweet caramel, and lightly bitter with some chocolate. Mouthfeel is solid. Medium body, good drinkability, nice level of carbonation.

Actually one of my favorite of those I've tried so far, especially in that it's very drinkable and not overbearing, with just enough flavor and porter-ness to woo you. I could actually see myself drinking multiples of these in a session if I was just in the mood for something dark/roasty/complex, without the heavy chewy oomph of a stout or double/imperial stout.

4.02,-5.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a medium tan head that recedes pretty quickly and leaves some residual lacing around the glass as i sip. Held to the light, it shows some ruby red hues but for the most part is opaque dark brown. Smell is off coffee with some roasted nuts on the back end. Taste is similar to the smell with a bit of chocolate malt showing through as well. The roasted malts in this make a good appearance and some hop bitterness comes through to balance out each sip. Mouthfeel seems a little on the watery side and carbonation is in the medium range which makes it pretty enjoyable. Not the best i have had but it's up there.","Brewbro000","Apr 12, 2011"

The aroma is vanilla and mocha with strong chocolate notes. The aroma is simple but pungent and very effective. The flavor is at first roasty coffee with plenty of vanilla with some chocolate and some berries. This beer besides all of its vanilla and chocolate remains dry and the hop bitterness shines through very well. The texture is creamy and silky. Just a showboat of a session beer.","BieresDesMoines","Mar 23, 2011"

4.37,2.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,"As a retired sailor, the song brings tears to my eyes, but I loooovvvve drinking this beer. My aggro pour produced two thick foamy fingers' worth of deep-tan head with fantastic retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown with ruby highlights. Nose smelled like a milk chocolate bar or better yet, putting your nose into a tin of cocoa powder. Suddenly, I was transported into my late maternal grandmother's kitchen where she let me make my own chocolate milk as a kid. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. Bittersweet, not so much, but chocolate and coffee were definitely in evidence on the tongue. Jesus, I could drink this all day, especially when it's cold and damp out or the chill rain beats against the windows. If only they would begin CANning ... Finish had a smoky quality that reminded me of the burned out home in Montreal that we passed each day on our way to the Metro to go to Mondial de la Biere in 2002. Really smoky.

Aside from that it was a quite enjoyable beer. Looks opaque and black. Little brown head. Both the mouthfeel and smell would be greatly enhanced with more carbonation. Aroma is chocolaty and sweet Tastes super malty, with a deep chocolate flavor. Remarkably smooth.

The flavors are much drier than the aroma suggests, and the body may be a touch thinned by age. Dark, dry chocolate flavors with a bit of smoked ash coming through on the back end.

It has a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is just what I needed after a night filled with mediocre beer. This one is truly excellent. I really wasn't expecting much going into this one, but it definitely has surprised me. Nicely balanced flavor and aroma going on in this one.

Two finger frothy khaki-colored head that has very good retention and leaves good lacing on the glass. Smells of coffee, chocolate, molasses and some spice. Taste is a great balance of cream, coffee, chocolate, and brown sugar. Not overly sweet, bitter, or roasted, just right in every flavor. Light body due to medium to high carbonation but still something I can chew on. Great beer in every aspect, and it could go well with any meal or situation.

This is the coffee variety, as opposed to being more chocolaty. For a porter, this is very crisp and carbonated. When I toured The Great Lakes Brewery in 2008, the tour guide told me this was his favorite all-year-round beer.

That's fine if that's what you're looking for, but I like to see less roasting and sweeter/maltier tastes throughout with only enough hops for balance in my porters.

4.05,-4.7,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The beer pours a partially transparent dark brown with twinges of red shining through. A super light tan half finger of foam. Smell is of good coffee grounds most heavily. Other aromas include oak and faint burnt cocoa notes. Caramel and Butterscotch notes also entertain the nostrils. The taste is of weak coffee, char and caramel. In spite of the burnt notes that are apparent throughout there is a subtle sweetness that comes from the caramel notes and turns out to be quite pleasant. The feel of this beer is a bit watery for my liking. It's not really all that bad, but it feels with the flavors that it should be a little more viscous. The carbonation is pretty good. None of those factors hurt the drinkability which is pretty nice. It's a very solid porter.","Vdubb86","Oct 09, 2010"

Sweet malty start morphs quickly to bittersweet chocolate. Finish is coffee-like in bitterness with a hint of tart/fruity sweetness in the aftertaste... apples, I do believe. Thick, chewy mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied with a crisp carbonation that cuts through to keep it from being overly thick, but it is maybe a bit too fizzy. Taste follows directly from the smell and adds a good dose of starchy raw grain, kinda like chewing on uncooked oatmeal (I mean that in a good way).

4,-5.9,4,4,4,4,4,"My choice: try the Gordon Lightfoot story song-inspired brew (trust me, it was inspired more by that Canadian siren's sonorous elegy (yes, men can be sirens too...equal rights and all...) than the namesake ship and its misfortune) from a bottle or from the tap. Well, I'm enjoying the CK today, so draught it is. It pours a clear dark garnet-brown with about a finger-and-a-half of foamy ecru head, which takes a while to completely die out, leaving decent alcing behind as it does so. The nose is coffee, molasses, bitter dark chocolate, dark malts, and a light breeze of hops. The taste sees a return of the coffee, bitter chocolate (this time in powder form), and the hops, heavy on the floral notes. What's new is a small appearance from a light maple syrup. The body is medium, tending toward the lighter end but not committing, with a lightly moderate carbonation and an ever-so-slight mouth coating. Not a bad porter in any respect, but nothing really that special, either.","TMoney2591","Jun 13, 2010"

This porter pours a dark ruby color, which turns to almost black when fully emptied into the glass. Carbonation is minimal, but apparent (more so than I would have expected). Aroma is fantastic, smelling of dark chocolate and malts. Smooth at first, a bitterness becomes apparent after swallowing. Not overwhelming in the least; pleasant and enjoyable.

The liquid is a mostly blackish brown with a patina of metallic orange around the outside. The nose has an excellent balance between roast and sweetness, coffee bean, milk chocolate, licorice, butterscotch, cooked oats, cherry and blackberry fruit, the hops do not reveal distinct scents, however, do condition the texture in your nostrils, lending dry bite. Medium-bodied, firm and displays good thrust in getting from start to finish. More roast in the coffee and mocha flavors here, more granola, oats and bread grains as well. Orange zest makes an appearance now and then. Smokehouse wood notes obscure some of the cherry, plum fruit. The carbonation is moderate, no fluffiness added just a slow mixing of the flavors.

Taste is a well blended combination of grain, bitter chocolate, hits of coffee, citrus hops and alcohol through the body and lingers in the finish as well.

Taste is a nice, chocolate sweetness; roasted tones are there; the sweetness is balanced by a dry (smoky?) finish with a bit of an unexpected hop/citrusy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with some fairly high carbonation. A very enjoyable porter.","jpro","Mar 18, 2010"

Nice dark chocolate bitter finish. It is very creamy , smooth, with a slight velvety feel. Amazing","tippebrewcrew2","Mar 11, 2010"

The taste buds say yum to more of this burst of malt & coffee bean bite, dry charcoal wood, some herbal hop, and even some banana mango hints. Just a fine mouthful of flavor with a decent medium body that offers a bit of a silky resinous feel with effective but subtle carbonation for a perfectly drinkable and delicious porter.

The taste is very complex, bitter sweet chocolate, roasty malts a little biterness from the hops, dry coffee like finish. More flavors come through as it gets warmer.

So while Edmund Fitzgerald is less complex, it is a very, very fine example of the style on its own right. This review may be tinged with disappointment, but the truth of the matter is that this porter is one of the best.

Nice cap of mocha colored head rest gently on top of my glass. After sinking (oh bad choice of words) there is a fair amount of beige lace sticking to all sides of the glass. The aroma is coffee and caramel. roast malt and a hint of hops. The flavor is fantastic. Coffee, malt, vanilla, and a nice sharp hop bite to round things off. Pefect medium body that makes it oh so drinkable. Just the right amount of carbonation to livin things up. This is a great porter.

Mmm, the taste of the coffee in this beer resembles that from high quality beans, so I might describe this as a lighter alternative to bigger breakfast stouts. At less than 6% (not noticeable) with slightly more than a medium body, this one packs a ton of flavor.

The smell comes up with coffee, chocolate, with a moderate sweetness. There's a bit of dry fruitiness in there, too. Again, kind of normal as I would've expected for the style. The taste comes on strong immediately with coffee - roasted barley flavors. There's a note of bitter chocolate - heavy on the roasty bitterness. The sweetness is kind of minimal, but present, barely able to cut into the coffee flavors. The taste all seems to be contained in the first sip, and very little seems to change as I get further into this beer. Mind you, what's here is good, nice and interesting, nothing is really off about it. Towards the end I started to notice a kind of bready, yeasty flavor - maybe some light esters, which don't do too much for me, but again, this one seems right on track, but not quite outstanding. This one is full, but the carbonation provides quite a sting - which actually leads to it feeling a bit thinner. But kind of nice I'd say. This one is good, but not great. It's nice and enjoyable, a beer you could probably enjoy quite a bit. I could really see myself drinking it again, if the price were right, but I wouldn't expect to be wowed by it.","taylorhamrick","Jul 05, 2009"

Also a strong coffee, caramel, and smoke. Left a sightly bitter aftertaste in your mouth. That aftertaste also left a strong smoke flavor. Felt good in the mouth.

Finish has an earthy bitterness and long lasting roasted coffee flavors. Carbonation is fluffy and smooth in the mouth, and the beer is medium-full in body.

Also happens to be a nostalgic little song from my youth as the 8-track tape containing this song was the first ""album"" I ever purchased, but I digress. The beer pours a nice deep, not quite opaque brown color with a nice light tan head that sticks around the sides of my glass quite nicely. There is no visible carbonation. The smell is of bittersweet chocolate covered cherries and toasty burnt toffee with hints of dark toast thrown in. There's almost no hops aroma evident. The taste mimics the scent with a very slight balance of lightly citrusy hops in the dry finish along with a touch of fading burnt chocolate with a slight alcohol presence. The feel is somewhat thinner than expected perhaps solidly in the medium range?

Slight hop kick at the end, but not much to that department. This is all about the chocolate. Overall pretty simple, a little thin without anything amazing happens.

Sticky, creeping lace all over the glass and good retention of the chunky cap. Sweet nose unlike most American Porters, milk chocolate, caramel and hints of vanilla. Complex flavors, milk chocolate again, 'dark' fruit, hints of coffee and vanilla with a hoppy bitterness at the end. Good mouthfeel, creamy and smooth. Slightly lighter body than most of this ilk and low carbonation combine to make it very drinkable. After doing some homework on this beer after the fact I am of the opinion there's good reason to believe this is the best American Porter in the US and certainly in the top five.","thekevlarkid","Sep 09, 2008"

Pour was the color of cola with a 1.5 inch rocky, effervescent, tan head that eventually settled into a soapy skim. Some lacing, but weak legs. Lots of tiny bubbles adhered to the bowl of the glass. Nose was chocolate malt and dark fruit. More chocolate malt in the mouth as well as a slight hops bittering, but no fruit detected on the palate.

The aroma is filled with dark malts and just a touch of floral hops, it is rather mild especially compared to the flavor. Once you dig into this robust porter the flavor immediately grabs you. Malts o' plenty round out the dominant flavor consisting of coffee, chocolate, and plenty of roasted malts. The floral hops become slightly more hidden beneath the intense flavor. Mouthfeel is filling and creamy. One of my favorite local brews that satisfies on tap as well as poured into a glass straight from the bottle. In my opinion this is one of Great Lakes Brewing Co's masterpieces.","kinger","Aug 01, 2008"

Taste starts off with a nice round roasted malt flavor, building with dark toasted whole grain bread and bitter chocolate. Finishes with burnt wood and some roasty bitterness.

Smoky, chocolatey, and roasty in brilliant balance, with a light caramel presence, a little bit of a green hop character, a little licorice and fruitiness. Exceptional nose IMO. The palate is roasty up front, with some dark chocolate, a little coffee and a faint hint of smoke. A little caramel comes through on the mid-palate. Drying, roasty and with a little licorice on the finish, this beer is a little bit like The Abyss. Medium-light in body with an acidity that's a blend of grain, roast and carbonic acid, this beer is marvelous on the palate. My original scores were way too low, this is, IMO, the best porter out there.","DefenCorps","Apr 02, 2008"

I am very happy to see this beer in the Top 100, despite the fact that it's not a barnburning 11% stout. This is a pure porter; what comes to mind when one thinks a standard, rich afternoon beer.

Very little, if any coffee or caramel, or any of the other nuances that typically accompany one another in a beer of this sort. This one seemed to me to be nearly exclusively unsweetened cocoa powder with a bit of roasted grain hiding in there some place. I didn't find the smell of this particularly complex, but it was pleasant nevertheless. Taste was mildly sweet with the cocoa from the smell asserting itself in the taste, as well. The sweetness quickly waned and turned pleasantly bitter, then a lovely dry, roasted cereal grain flavour. This is a nice porter. Mouthfeel is neither too heavy nor too thin. Quite drinkable.

Initial half finger tan head wafted away leaving a ring around the glass and a few errant bubbles. There did not appear to be a lot of carbonation but there was decent lacing. The smell was very chocolately, mocha, toasted almonds, chocolate biscuit. Rich chocolate taste, malt, well balanced bitterness with a lingering, dry, dark chocolate latte finish. Not a hint of astringency. Swirling and even putting the glass down enriched the tan ring around the glass with a fresh supply of bubbles although, again, very little by way of visible carbonation. Overall, a rich taste, full flavours, a full body without being overbearing, very drinkable.

It had a nice black color with ruby and brown highlights, a nice sized dark tan head that had nice retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was nice, a little bitter probably from heavy roasted malts? While also giving off scents of coffee, chocolate and dark malts. This is a very inviting brew, possibly the nicest aromatic porter I have had. The taste is simply fantastic, nice slight bitterness mixed with flavors that match the nose. The malt flavors here are simply incredible, they flavors that they give off play perfectly together. Slight carbonation also plays nice and the feel is medium. This is probably one of the finest beers I have ever had so incredibly easy drinking, take that with a grain of salt because Porters are my favorite brews. I have been waiting for a long time to give this a try since I have not been able to find it in NY. I was not disappointed to say the least, what a delight.

It is dark: more black than brown and very cola-like in appearance. It has a wonderful smoky flavor that is intense with chocolate undertones. This actually went very well with the Caribbean jerk chicken wings I ordered. I have had this in a bottle b4 but it is much better on draft.

It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine porter, but I was expecting more.

Taste is a light coffee like malt with a bit of a milk chocolate flavor to it. Has a bit of a hop bite to it which is balanced out well with the caramel malt flavor. Aftertaste is coffee with a bit of cream and sugar with some smokey woody notes. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a dull carbonation.

As this is my first experience reveiwing please take heed. I could definitely smell a sweet aroma as well as a rosted scent. Very complex and inviting. The first taste, a cocoa flavor jumped through immediately followed by a hint of frutiness. A breadth of flavor on the first try. The mouth feel was very filling.

The smell was very strong of roasted dark chocolate, which caught me a bit by suprise. As it warmed some more sugary, caramel like tones started to come through. The mouthfeel was a little thin, watery which is my only complaint, I expected a bit more of a robust feel to it. The taste itself was very nice. Suprisingly hoppy on the back and very well balanced with the roasted malts. Main flavors here were more of a roasted coffee and sugar, with a ever so slight hint of chocolate, nothing like the smell which was dominated by it. Overall this was a nice sessionable beer.

3.8,-10.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Leaves the bottle a somewhat translucent brown/black color. Shows some ruby red highlights when held to the light. Pour creates a faily tight, 1/2"" tan head which disappointingly fades quickly to a thin web-like wisp. Pleasant, but quite restrained aromas of bakers chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, dried dark fruit and coffee beans. Found the palate to be leaning toward the thin side; just a tad watery. Flavor shows off a bit more intensity than the aroma did with semi-sweet rich notes of dark chocolate, French roast coffee, roasted malts and burnt caramel candy. Some faint hop flavors sneak in to invoke some slight bitterness to tame the sweetness. Overall a bit tame but very well balanced. For an everyday porter Anchor would still be my call.","macster","Feb 16, 2007"

A decent head dissipated till a fat ring remained around the edges of the glass, this ring left some light lacing in clingy patches down the sides. The aroma was sweet roasted malt with chocolate covered cherries. The taste was similar to regular Edmund Fitzgerald, but with a more pronounced chocolate flavor that intertwines with cherries followed by a slight tartness from the cranberries. There are many different flavors going on this glass, but the overall experience isn't lost on just one pronounced flavor. All the flavors blend together well.

Good mouthfeel, the heavy smoke flavor doesn't mask the other tones that fill this beer. This is a great beer, my favorite from great lakes. Enjoy!","wingman14","Jul 03, 2006"

Aroma of light coffee and roasted malt is less dominating then expected. Taste is also dominated by light coffee with some medium bitterness form the roasted malt.

The aroma is mostly chocolatey, with some roasted malt and hops in there too. It tastes like semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and hops. It has a nice bitter aftertaste too. It has a good medium mouthfeel to it, with just the right amount of carbonation. It finishes great, and it's very easy to drink.

Strong roasted coffee domintates, and the flavor doesn't change much from start to finish. Very dry, slightly bitter overall. The mouthfeel is semi-thick, has a nice smoothness, and is quite sharp on the carbonation for a porter.

When I first popped the cap, a nice aroma of hops came gushing out. When I poured it, the hops still remained, but in the background of dark roasted malt and coffee beans. I noticed in the front of the pack where those coffee beans and roasted malt flavors and then those bitter hops came out at the end. Not too bitter though. Bascially it tasted like smelled, but better. Gets better when it starts to warm up. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy and those bitter hops don't seem to want to go just yet. An excellent porter that is brewed only 30 mins from here, talk about drinking local. This is a beer that Porter lovers would enjoy over and over again.

Nice complex flavor, with roasted and chocolate-ish malts, a nice profile of slightly herbal and bitter hops, and a long aftertaste of burnt caramel flavors and some nutty/earthy tones.

Chocolate and a slight hop presence are also there. Very bold and sweet. In the mouth it is full, sweet and pleasant. There is a bit of post-swallow bitterness. Holds well.

The smell immediately lends itself notes of molasses and cocoa powder, mixed with some assertive hop bitterness. Flavorwise, the astringency of the roasted malt is balanced by a sweet toffee flavor and the beer stays firmly within the porter style, although it has whispers of Baltic porter strength and substance. The hops are outstanding and give it just enough life to keep it irresistibly drinkable. Reminds me of Storm King, with a little more finesse and a little more class. Even better as it warms to room temp. A great sipper.","99bottles","Sep 04, 2005"

The aroma smells strongly of roasted barley, but some other sweet malt notes sneak through as well. The flavor backs-up the strong roasted smell with an immediate assault on your tongue. At the same instant, tons of coffee and caramel flavors arrive. However, the roasted malt is the dominant factor by far. The mouthfeel is outstanding. Substantial, but not quite so thick as to confuse it with a stout. Overall, I'd say it is perfect for the style. This is a very drinkable beer, but only for those who are fans of the roasted malts. Otherwise, it will likely be over-powering.","niknar","Aug 11, 2005"

Smell is a bit hoppier than most porters I'd say, but there's also a strong roasted malt smell and a hint of sweet chocolaty scent. Taste is again a bit hoppier than most porters, kind of hits you up front and then comes the malt. There is a nice sweetness to this beer but it's really subtle and you have to pay attention to notice. Mouthfeel is smooth but maybe a little watery? I don't know what to think of this beer. On St. Patty's day I drank one of these for the first time, out of a bottle too, and thought it was fantastic. Maybe that was just because I had a Guinness right before that. So I went out and bought a couple bottles and brought them back to Mass with me and these ones don't seem to have the complexities that I initially noticed. I wish I could get some out here but it doesn't come here unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, it's a good porter.

Chocolate flavor rests below the heavy roasted taste, which dominates the drink. Very light on the plate overall. Almost 1 dimensional where the roasted flavor is all you get for the most part.

Additional hints of chocolate covered cherry, roasted coffee, & a touch of both floral hops & campfire ash. Once in the mouth, this is absolutely delicious. A brief initial wave of bitterness is devastated by a huge, complex dark malt portfolio. Roasted coffee & bittersweet chocolate balanced beautifully by flavors of dark fruit & English hops.

It has a nice woody malty flavor with some small hints of chocolate and the alcohol gets brought out as the beer reaches room tempature. At room temp. this beer is simply sublime.

The light sweetness is here in the taste as well, though the dark malt character tends to mute it out. Roast malt notes with hints of coffee and a good chocolate presence round out the middle of this beer. Definitely a great example of a porter, the burnt malt character is fairly muted. Does not have as much of an acrid burnt malt finish as some, it is fairly smooth and drinkable like a good porter should be. The medium body helps the drinkability, though it has so much flavor packed in it I would not recommend pounding this one, nor would I want too as this beer is just too enjoyable.

4.45,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Basically blackish-brown in hue with ruby highlights where the light penetrated the sides of the glass, a finger of beige head tops off the beer in a lovely fashion. The head does fade to about half a finger quickly but the remainder holds excellently. Consequent lacing was webby but very prevalent. As a whole this is a great looking Porter. The potency of the nose is fantastic for a Porter, toasted malts, caramelized sugar, and a hint of roasted almonds, chocolate, and coffee. The individual aromas rarely stand-alone, it is an orgy of smells all focused on a common mission, create an inviting aroma indicative of a Porter. Mission accomplished. The palate is marvelously well rounded; upfront is a bite of citrusy hops that briefly charges ahead of the other flavors, the rest catches-up quickly. Roasted malts impart flavors of coffee and chocolate, toasted wood at the finish. I love the charred taste; it would be a great match with tangy BBQ or hickory-smoked steak, maybe even a gamey seared hen. Medium-full in body, it is rich and filling, a touch creamy, the carbonation is moderate and very soothing. The mouthfeel is good but just above ordinary. Obviously this is one drinkable beer. The aftertaste is big and charred. Awesome! Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is great; I cant say it is that better that Fuller's London Porter! They are both dandies but this bad boy is nearly flawless!

Hops, malt, roasted barley make their way into your senses and do not let go!

Much like the ship, this beer sets sail but sadly never ports again. A bit disappointed in this porter being a fan of the great lake and the story of the Fitz.

You realize that the aroma and appearance isn't all this beer is made of, the taste is built up to so nicely that this beer has already been a journey of the senses. Initially the this beer dances around the sweet tooth in my mouth, to balance out in the swallow to a nice smooth dryness that soothes and nurtures my senses.

It sports a tan colored head that reduces to just a cap but leaves a fair bit of lace. The aroma is of dark roasted malt, molasses, and a whisp of sourness (the kind which is much more pronounced in Sierra Nevada Porter, I believe due to a healthy hop presence wafting through the dark roasted malt). This brew is chock full of dark roasted malt flavor (reminds me of a dry irish stout, but with a lighter mouthfeel)...some dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, plus a hint of citric hops. There's just enough sweetness to take the edge off the bitterness without competing for your attention. A very tasty brew.","johnrobe","Dec 01, 2002"

The head eventually drops to just a collar but leaves some nice lace. The aroma is nicely fruity, chocolatey and coffee-ish - almost candyish (chocolate covered cherry?). Very welcoming! The body is firm with a very fine and gentle carbonation that's creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with sweet and fruity notes amongst a deep roastiness, becomes more chocolatey as it crosses the palate and into the swallow, and then unleashes an intense coffee character that includes flavor as well as roastiness and bitterness. Amazingly, some citrusy hop flavor appears out of nowhere and lingers along with a mocha character and some bitterness in a long finish. Really well balanced, very drinkable, and complex.
