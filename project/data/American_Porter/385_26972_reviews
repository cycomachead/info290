"Very interesting mix of spices and nuances."

"O - This is a delicious pumpkin porter. I had high expectations, so I probably caused myself to bew less impressed than I should have been. I really enjoyed this beer though."

"Delicious beer. If you're looking for a big dark pumpkin pie, there are better options. If you're looking for a really good chocolatey tasty porter, this is a very solid choice. Will drink it again without hesitation."

"Not a big pumpkin fan."
"Appearance is a small brownish fizzy head no lace an an opaque black brown color. Aroma is spice Malt Cocoa molasses. Flavor is like a roll mom plus is fairly dry and bitter with some carbonic tang. Body is good and has some alcoholic warmth. Pumpkin beers aren't my favorite style, but this one isn't too bad."

""
""
"Quite a surprise as I was expecting more pumpkin but was happy to do with the subtlety. All the other added flavors formed a spectacular beer."
""
"Definitely a dessert beer, this seasonal holiday concoction does not disappoint.  Pours out dark and viscous.  Great flavors of pumpkin mixed with chocolate and hints of spice."

"O- a nice roasty porter base is greatly complimented by the pumpkin spicing.  A nice slow sipper for a Halloween evening"
""
""
""
"O: This is a different take on a spiced pumpkin beer, with the spices more restrained, letting the malt and pumpkin shine through. Very tasty."

"overall: amazing brew, want to quaff again soon!"

"Another pumpkin flavor beer i bought the other day to try out. This one i did enjoy. Had great flavor all the way throughout!"

"An imperial chocolate pumpkin porter... and that's exactly what it tastes like. To borrow an adjective from the label, this really is one of those demented (but delectable) ales that have to be experienced first hand. There aren't a lot of other ICPPs around to compare it with."

"Yum! I loved this beer. Just as advertisd- pumpkin, spice, and cocoa nibs. You get a nuttiness from the cocoa nibs as well as a bit of chocolate, some nice creaminess and almost a meatiness from the pumpkin, and it's all complemented by some nice pie spices. This a seamlessly integrated beer. Each component playing beautifully off of the next. Great beer."

"The beer appears a deep dark brown, approaching blackness, with an oily beige head. The aroma brings chocolate, pumpkin, pie, roasted malt, perhaps some peanut butter? Maybe even chocolate peanut butter cups? Really well done here, with pumpkin character asserting itself late. Lingering notes of sweet potatoes. Smooth on the pallets with alcohol well hidden. A very nice fall seasonal."
"O - My wife and I both enjoyed this beer. Kudos to the brewer for coming up with a unique twist on a porter with the seemingly-roasted spices."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2013 bottling. Pours pitch black color with a a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, herbal, toast, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with very well balanced pumpkin, spice, cocoa, and roasted malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big pumpkin, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, light coffee, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Light roast/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, balance, and robustness of pumpkin, spice, cocoa, and roasted malt flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent pumpkin porter. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of pumpkin, spice, cocoa, and roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"One of the better pumpkin beers I've had with a great brownie cocoa feel and reserved but less is more spice. Fresh pumpkin shines and makes it all like a good dessert."
""
""
"This pretty much lived up to expectations I'd say, nice pumpkin porter with a remarkable spice profile."
""
""
""
"Nice to see several Imperial Porters on the market these days. Only wish the price point was more attractive as a $14 bottle makes for limited sampling."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Even though it didn't live up to the label in terms of the pumpkin, I would try it again. A great porter for sipping on a fall night."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"This is a well made dark porter/stout style of a pumpkin beer. One of the best I've had."
""
""
""
"I was not sure what to expect of this beer as other hybrids like this have disappointed but this did not. As my notes indicate, I felt the flavor was really the highlight of this beer, and if you can live/taste in the gray area, you may enjoy this."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Very nice mouthfeel. Medium-full bodied with an ample amount of fine carbonation. Again, drying throughout the duration of each sip, as well as the finish. Drinks right at its ~8% ABV mark. Overall, a very enjoyable pumpkin porter. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. For me the pumpkin could have been more prevalent, but as is, it remains a nice complementary facet of the beer."
"Pours a deep dark black. Not much head, one thin brown halo of foam around the glass. Smell is of deep chocolate and cinnamon. Taste is not far behind - I do pick up pumpkin, chocolate, and spices, and the right level of sweetness, though not necessarily the clove as claimed. Mouth feel is thick and syrupy. Carbonation level is perfect - a nice not too subtle balance for the thick body. Very interesting to compare this to a beer like Dark 'O the Moon. Would definitely drink again."

"Where's the pumpkin at? The spices are faint, which makes me wonder if Doug got an old bottle. At the same time, the base porter is delicious. This is one brew I'd like to revisit fresh, yet I would still recommend trying this beer in its current state."

"D) This is an interesting little critter with some enjoyable aspects to it."

"O: Solid beer. The flavors are good, the mouthfeel is solid... I'd drink this beer again, but I'd probably wait until colder months."
""
""

""

"A true delight. A bit heavy on the clove and nutmeg for my taste, Loaded with pumpkin and I appreciate it. Now to find a fresh bottle."
"I had hopes that I would find this beer disappointing, so I wouldn't have to go out of my way to trade for a fresh bottle next year. But this is not the case. With about 8 months of age this is drinking great. I'm curious what it is like fresh."
"The beer pours a dark watery black, very dark for a porter, with a razor thin blanketing of tan foam that leaves a tight bubbled lacing. The nose certainly spiced and aromatic after a good swirl promoting chocolate pumpkins/gourds and hint of boozy nutmeg. The taste is certainly more cocoa forward and sweet with little distinct pumpkin and mingling spices. Although the spice profile is...less than embalmed...there is still an interesting collage of spice, pumpkin, and chocolate that's really not present in any other beers. Wow, what is the potent raisin taste after it warms up?? I think it's a far cry from pumpkinator in its correct state, but is still supremely drinkable and tasty, even in the warm summer heat. It's a relatively full-bodied porter with a velvety mouthfeel reminiscent of Founder's porter. I'd love to try this beer when it's in season and hopefully witness the spices pop out against the rich chocolatey base, but think its still worth a try regardless."

"Very good, probably my favorite Midnight Sun"
""
""
""

"I'd drink this again but perhaps better suited for a chilly Fall evening and a turkey dinner, mmm turkey, now I'm craving, wish me luck convincing my wife to make a practice turkey."
""
""
""
"D - Great pumpkin porter. Good balance."
""
""
""
"O - Nice complexity. Shade sweet."
""
""
""
"D/O: This pumpkin beer does a fair job of cutting the pure vegetal quality of the fruit with supple roasted malt. The porter approach is repeatedly shown to favor the addition of pumpkin, which is further reinforced here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From notes, 8/3/10. Pretty good beer, almost great. This beer has some excellent spicing. There’s a ton of pumpkin pie flavor with extra spice, just right for a pumpkin beer. However, the aroma also has a big cola note that is almost sickly sweet, kinda surprising for Midnight Sun since their beers seem to run drier than nearly any other brewery. There’s some chocolate and caramel lurking in the mix, as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Appearance could also be improved - the head dissipates quite quickly, leaving just a very dark brown to black body. This is a very well done pumpkin beer, but it has a few problems."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite a big fruity twist to a big, dark beer. I won't pretend I can instantly taste the difference between a porter and a stout but as an imperial porter it tastes sweeter and more stouty to me. I wouldn't mind a bit more dry roastiness coming in to balance and ground it."
""
"O/D-About as good as a Pumpkin Porter can get. This variation on the style has a rather low ceiling for me but TREAT nearly bumps its noggin on said ceiling. Very nice; much better than my first experience with Midnight Sun."
""
""
""
""
""
"B-"
""
"This beer poured out as a real nice black color with a decent tan colored hea on top. The retention is thin and not much lacing. The smell of the beer has a nice sweet chocolate aroma and plenty of spice. The taste of the beer is sweet upfront with a very nice balanced spiciness in the finish. The mouthfeel is silky with a decent carbonation. Overall quite a nice beer."
"O: Honestly I don't know if I should call it a pumpkin ale or an imperial vegetable porter. If it's a pumpkin ale, it's the best by a long shot, but the admixture of the chocolate makes it something different. I so love this beer and hope to have it again soon. This was my introduction to midnight sun and I don't think I could have had a better one. If you see it for less than $20 it's worth it, but know that, if you can find, you can find it for probably $15 or less. This beer rounds out my top 20 and is damn near an A+. Now my reviews says 4.88, which, when multiplied by 20 makes it a 97. I gave it a 96, but with inflation on BA, 4.88 is probably equivalent to giving a beer a 140. I would not give it that. Ever. But it's SOOO good. Pick up a bottle and thank me later."

"O: The nose was nice, but the taste was overpowered by this earthy-like quality and some vegetal like flavors. Lacked the porter backing I needed. A miss for me, but glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was my first beer from Midnight Sun and I was a little bit disappointed. It was a little bit on the flat side and the cloves and spices were a little bit too overpowering with only a faint pumpkin/chocolate presence. This definitely wasn't bad, but there are much better pumpkin beers out there."
"o: for a porter this is not a favorite, for a pumpkin beer this would be alright if that is your thang. not my thang."
"Along with Pumking, my favorite pumpkin ale. Nice medium, creamy body, deep dark brown with russet highlights, spicy, chocolate nose with vanilla, Mil;k Duds™, sandalwood, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and pumpkin. Finish is long on the palate, and there is some drying in the finish from the modest, earthy hopping. Very nice stuff."
"Nice to have tried and would drink again but probably won’t be seeking this one out for the $15 per bottle price tag."
"O: Decent porter/pumpkin ale. Would like a little more chocolate and/or roasted malt character to be honest. The spices are really strong here, especially the nutmeg and ESPECIALLY the cloves. Almost overpowering. It's tasty and I enjoyed it a lot, just lacking some balance that could have made this beer really special. Definitely seek it out if you're a big fan of pumpkin spices, however."
"O: A very solid beer. Probably the most interesting pumpkin beer I've had and it's nice to see one with a different spin on it"
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, but not as good as I had hoped. In this style I thought that Saint Arnold did a better job with Pumpkinator."
""
""
""
"O This is not my first pumpkin beer and I had high hopes, but it fell short. Didnt even finish the bottle. In its defense, it probably needs aging to balance out."
""
""
"The name is a perfect fit - this is definitely a treat. A dessert beer, perfect for a fall evening. Sweet, smooth, and deliciously pumpkiny. Dang, I like this. Yum."
""
"O - Nice offering from Midnight Sun and one I'd like to have again. My only disclaimer would be to not expect the notes in a traditional pumpkin beer as this is clearly a porter first and foremost."
""
"2012. Pours a pitch black color with a small tan-dark brown head that goes down quickly. Scent is quite lovely...possibly the best aroma on a pumpkin beer that I've had. Lovely spices with some nutmeg and cinnamon. Chocolate and cocoa powder compliment the spices well, with a hint of squash/vegetable aroma. The pumpkin is not ""in your face", but as this beer breathes a bit, I definitely get some nice canned pumpkin aromas. Very nice-smelling beer. Taste is just as good as it smells. All the aspects of the nose are in the flavor. Heavy spice with delicious pumpkin and chocolatey flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is one of the best pumpkin beers I have ever had. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall very interesting and unique, nice malts, weird pumpkin chai and nutmeg, interesting but not great."
""
""
""
"O - Overall I didn't think this was as good as I had hoped. A bit light on the pumpkin with lots of nutmeg notes. Chocolate was nice and light. Still, I've had better pumpkin with stouts/porters."
"A sound beer, I'm dissapointed the pumpkin is not quite evident, the mouthfeel could be a bit better too. My first pumpkin beer. Not sure if it warrants the reviews it receives but still a good beer. Unsure if this would be better fresh or aged."
""
""
"One of, if not the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. I wish they all tasted like this. Decent complexity and body and putting the cinnamon, spice, and pumpkin in an imperial porter background works wonders. Definitely recommended."
""
"A thick rich head billows forth as pour and the retention is good. A black brown brew is sitting in the glass with a decent amount of lace. Smell is lovely. Lots of chocolate and spice, pumpkin is a heavy hitter with just a touch of sweet alcohol. Taste is much the same with a heavy dose of cocoa in the front. Pumpkin flows next with a light coffee roastiness. Dark malt and dark breads collide on my tongue. Molasses tinged sweetness. Pumpkin is well done here with the full flavor of the meat developing alongside the spice component. A nice amount of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Alcohol shows a little in the finish but is otherwise well hidden. Finish itself is quite dry and clean with a wash of burnt sugary sweetness and then earth and pumpkin. Lingering mocha. Feel is lightly syruped and a touch slick. Gentle carbonation gives a mild velvetiness. Drinkability is quite good but this is not a session ale by any definition. This is a brew to savor and enjoy with pies and cake at the holiday table, or in the weeks leading up as a taste of things to come. Great brew!"
"Overall - I can't imagine this is what it's supposed to taste like. Very unpleasant finish. I can't stress that enough. I need another beer."
""
""
""
"O: This isn't a terrible beer, but I also don't feel like there's much to say about it either. Not very pumpkiny, but not a bad tasting beer."
""
"D - really solid stout on display here. Not a ton of pumpkin (or at least as much as I was hoping for), but still delicious in its own right. Recommended!"
""
"O - rich, roasty porter with pumpkin pie thrown in, I enjoyed it."
"Overall I should say that I have been wanting to try this for over a year and finally got the chance thanks to injuredreserve. I thought this was okay and as it warmed it got a bit better but I was really underwhelmed. I may not be a ""pumpkin beer"" guy. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try it if you get the chance."
""
"Overall. A nicely flavoured big porter with great ballance. Perfect for this spooky evening and a tired dad."
""
""
""
"Overall the pumpkin flavor in this beer is more of a vegetable flavor than sweet pumpkin spice flavor. The porter part of the beer is very well roasted with a good amount of chocolate. I am not sure I would go out of my way to buy this again, but it is a very interesting take on a pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
"Great porter but just wish it had more pumpkin presence. Very flavorful but I feel the pumpkin spice is far too light. As a traditional american style porter this is excellent."
""
"o - overall probably one of the better pumpkin beers of all time. it is so good that i probably would consider it a chocolate porter with a hint of pumpkin instead of a pumpkin beer. midnight sun continues to impress with this TREAT!"
""
"O: I've been waiting for this to come around here, and I was delighted to find it. For fans of vegetal pumpkin ales, the sweeter imperial pumpkin ales, and pumpkin stouts."
""
"O: It's my first pumpkin beer that I enjoyed. Quite pricey though at $10.99."
""
""
""
"Overall: Found this to be underwhelming. It's well blended and there is a satisfying porter underneath but none of the various flavors take center stage and it ends up being kind of meek."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good, but I can tell it's faded. I'm a victim of my own beer hoarding. I traded for this one back in February, and I forgot about it. I should have had it when I first got it six months ago."
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, spice, and some slight pumpkin aromas. Taste is much the same but is slightly tart. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."
""
""
"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark, dark red brown, appearing black. Moderate light brown head and nice lacing. Aroma of dark malts and distinct pumpkin. Moderate bodied, dark fruit, dark malts, pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices. Complex. Slightly bitter finish with mixed spices on the back of the tongue detracts from an excellent ale. A very nice pumpkin porter. A year old properly aged bottle drunk the same evening had basically the same score, but rated higher on mouth feel, which had become even more creamy and pleasant. The flavors had integrated and mellowed nicely."
""
"Overall, I was pretty happy with this. A fun, pretty unique porter. I don't have a lot of experience with pumpkin beers, but I did like this. That said, I wouldn't break the bank trying to get more."
""
""
"Opaque engine oil dark brown body, no visible carbonation, 1/2 finger medium brown head, not much lacing. Very complex nose, cocoa nibs ala milk chocolate, cinnamon, nutmeg, hops, chocolate malt, hops subsumed by spices and malts. Taste mirrors nose, quite a bit of light chocolate, the spices become prevalent on the back end once the beer fully warms. Silky medium mouthfeel, very good effervescence, dry finish exacerbated by the oatmeal. IMO more of a dessert beer though not overly sweet, certainly a real treat."
""
"An excellent beer and a way to introduce a novice to imperial dark beers. I find it less intense and more drinkable than some of the best stouts but at the same time it holds up with a richness that makes me wish I was drinking this on a cold night in the Midwest instead of a mild night on the West Coast."
"O: I really enjoyed this pumpkin beer, one of the best I've tried. It isn't often that you see a dark colored pumpkin beer, but this one knocks it out of the park. I'll be looking forward to this one when fall comes around again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The cloves I taste in this beer hurt it the most. Its a good dark pumpkin beer, but the best dark beer brewed with pumpkin is Cape Ann Fishermans Friend."
"Very good pumpkin porter here. If you want something similar but a bit more under the radar, try Cape Ann Fishermans Imperial Pumpkin Stout. Worth a try but not giving up your cellar for. Thanks TATURBO."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a dark black color porter with a nice medium brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of cinnamon and light roasted malt with some light pumpkin undertones. Taste is a complex mix between some cinnamons, some light dry roasted malt with some light pumpkin notes, some nutmeg and a nice rich black chocolate finish. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. This is quite a unique recipe with loads of complexity while retaining a good drinkability level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the better spiced ales I’ve tried...quite a treat! The cocoa nibs add a nice layer to differentiate this from other spiced beers. Mediocre appearance and mouthfeel hold the score back a bit. Big thanks to my sister from Seattle for sending this my way!"
""
""
""
""
"This is a really lovely beer, and one I'm very, very pleased to have sampled. The dark pumpkin beer works so well here, because the balance is right. There is no sense of the pumpkin and spice being overwhelmed, but at the same time, it's clearly a deep, chocolatey porter. It's win-win whatever way you look at it."
""
""
"Appearance is dark brown with one finger of off-white head. Its` nose has nutmeg, pumpkin, ginger and cocoa. Taking a sip, from this beer and I taste cinnamon, pumpkin, chocolate...damn this is nice. Mouthfeel is medium-full, decent amount of carbonation. This is a great porter/pumpkin beer. I had been waiting for some time to try it and even longer for anything from Midnight Sun to hit the northeast, very happy they just got distribution in NY."
""
"o - a beer I'll revist, as it was damn tasty!"
""
"O - A complex beer with a lot going on with a ton of flavors. I'm not a fan of pumpkin beers and it kept my attention. I can see it as a beer you either love or hate."
"With the beer turning so many flavors in rapid succession, the claim can be made that the beer's flavors are in conlict with one another and never really culminate as great complex beers do. but the procession that each flavor takes across the palate seems to evoke a sense of curriosity and wonderment with me that easily wins me over! Great job Midnight Sun, great job!"
""
""
""
"O - A very different beer with variety. A little sickly in places."
"I enjoyed this beer, particularly in the amazing smell, but expecting a more complex taste. Overall, not bad, but just didn't live up to what I expected."
""
"O- I love pumpkin beers and this just took the crown for best in class."
"O- Very nicely done beer. Flavors went great together, pumpkin was a bit more subdued than other pumpkin beers. However that let some of the other flavors come out more. Very much enjoyed this beer. Again, HUGE thanks to Jay for this beer!"
""
"O: One of the better pumpkin brews I've had. Just wish the flavor lasted longer after each sip, seemed to drop off rather quick."
""
"overall: wow. great beer, very balanced flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Upon first sip - a sense of overwhelming perfection rushes over me. Quite a complex beer; such an array of flavors showing from sip to swallow. Pumpkin, chocolate...a bakery spice rack. It's all there. Like imbibing a chocolate pumpkin pie hybrid without being OVERLY sweet. The clove is ever-so slightly off-putting for a second, but the smooth sweet cocoa saves the day. Such a shame that it's brewed so far away. Was more of this big-body, low carbonated brew. Sticky seduction."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"a good pumpkin beer, definatly unique, but i had higher hopes for this. IMO it couldve use some more dark roasted flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Complex, with loads of character and flavors. Bold, rich, and lightly spiced. Chocolate/pumpkin/spiced combo makes for a solid pumpkin porter. With so much to offer… you could probably find something about this brew you like and something you don't."
"M - Medium body with a slight chew. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favorite pumpkin ale. Even a non pumpkin person would like this beer. Midnight sun crushes it."
""
""
"Overall: I had a hard time drinking this nonsense. The flavors were fighting each other and did not blend together as well as you think they would. For $14.99 this is a totally avoidable beer"
""
"D/O: Certainly a unique brew. Plenty of flavours, but I'm not sure they really meld."
""
"O: I really like this one. It's probably my favorite pumpkin beer this season or ever. A- Thanks again for eclipse54 sending it over! A brewery that I would never have gotten in DE."
"On the high end of medium bodied with a lightish amount of carbonation, the mouthfeel is fine as is the drinkability. This is a great beer; my only regret is that I didn't have a chance to taste it back in October or even November."
""
""
"Overall a nice beer for sure, I just felt the chocolate dominated the pumpkin spices. Wouldn't mind having more of this one though, it sure is good."
""
"O: Maybe pumpkin beers aren't for me, and even though there wasn't a lot of pumpkin here, I'd still like to see less pumpkin. I think this needs more roasted malt and porter-ish brightness to support the pumpkin, or else it's kind of flabby. Well done for a pumpkin beer, though."
""
""
""
"O - Really enjoyed this one. It was the marriage of flavors that I had hoped for. While it didn't blow me away, as I had hoped, it still became my new favorite in the world of pumpkin inspired beers."
"O: I think I was expecting more pumpkin for this one but I was not let down by any means as this the best porter/imperial porter I've had next to HF Everett. Definitely must try for Porter lovers out there."

"Poured into my Double Bastard Tall Glass, black with a Tan head that lasted through three-quarters of the glass and left nice lacing all the way to the last sip. Very pleasant aroma of pumpkin, chocolate, light roast, and a hint of coffee. The flavor is complex with the pumpkin and chocolate as the main tastes, but with coffee, light roasted malt, also present. I did not taste much of the spices listed in the description. But this still was an amazing beer. Medium to heavy bodied. But it did get a little sweet towards the end, Especially after drinking the whole 22 oz. bottle. I planned on sharing with 2 of my friends, but after drinking a Weyerbacher Pumpkin Ale, Lagunitas 'Sucks"" and a Goose Island Christmas ale on thanksgiving, I couldn't stop myself. Fairly smooth at the finish. Having something that you have wanted for a while can be a let-down after all the hype. Thankfully in this case, the experience lived up to my expectations."
"D:  Despite the alcohol level on this, it is big enough to make you think there might be more.  That, along with the complexity of this beer, make it an easy sipper.  It goes down very easily and captivates your attention with each sip.  Really a treat to have, and perfect for the Thanksgiving holiday. "
""
""
"Enjoyable beer. This beer, more than any I can remember at the moment, changes greatly with the temperature. Warmth is really the key for enjoyment. With warmth the flavor smooths out and blends well and is very pleasant. I am not sure this is one I will seek out often, it will be one I seek out a bottle every year however."
""
""
""
"This beer gives true closure to fall and welcomes winter. Wide breadth of flavor and nuance and just the way that it drinks, it is spot on for a seasonal at this exact time and place. Also extremely well built, and well, it's name is aptly put."
""
""
"O: It will never rival a straight pumpkin ale, but MS TREAT is the best example of the Imperial Pumpkin Porter I have had. The pumpkin flavors here are undeniable, with loads of both spice and raw pumpkin mash taking center stage here. The porter flavors are more refined, but that works to this beer's credit. The delicate chocolate roast and mild coffee notes really tie together what is an excellent beer. Great work, Midnight Sun!!!"

"O- The 2011 version was good, but didn't quite live up to my expectations (probably because I put this beer on a pedestal). Interesting transitions between aspects of the beer, but not sure it blended it well- until a few days later when I popped the 2010! Damn this beer fucking rocks with some age on it IMO; more chocolatey, pumpkiny, and smooth."
""
"O: This is truly a treat...glad I picked this one up, would love to have this again."

"I picked this up in secret halloween '11, dark brown pour with a medium white head. Nice aroma, notes of pumpkin, chocolate, pumpkin pie spice. The flavors meld nicely, light pumpkin, cinamon, chocolate. The body is medium, good carbonation. A great take on a pumpkin beer, great dessert beer."
"Wonderfully complex Pumpkin Ale but unfortunatly no distribution around here."
"O: A very awesome beer. Everything blends very well. The spices aren't overbearing. Definitely one of my top pumpkin beers."
"Very interesting brew. I'm not always the biggest pumpkin fan, but this one is subtle enough to work. The chocolate porter really shines through the pumpkin is just a supporting player that does a good job at complexity to the brew. I've got another I'm going to age for a few months and see what it's like."
"Rating: 93 out of 100"
"Overall, the best pumpkin ale I’ve had to date, and I feel it is certainly worth the “hype” and attention it receives. A ""Franken-beer"" worth seeking out and acquiring should the opportunity ever arise."
"O: Enjoyable but I didn't need a bomber...not boozy, but lots of distinct, rich flavors effect the drinkability...the herbal and spicy characters get a little overwhelming by the end."
"Pours a jet black with a good light tan head that leaves a little bit of light lacing on the glass. The nose hits with chocolate, cocoa nibs, pumpkin spice, cinnamon, and a robust roasted maltiness. On the taste I'm picking up almost a bacon quality, pumpkin, chocolate, nutmeg, cinnamon, cocoa, pretty complex and beautiful combonation here. It's got a medium body, well carbonated and has a nice lasting flavor. This is truely a great and unique beer."
"O- This is just shy of drinking dessert. The balance is great. It is not quite as sweet, nor is it as heavy, as ST Creme Brûlée, which makes it hit the spot for me that much more."
"O: really unique and interesting brew. I love the way the cocoa nibs and the pumpkin match up. Tis the season, so I'm glad I have another bottle. Skal."
"Overall this is a nice beer but not one I'd seek out regularly. Once a year is probably about right."
"O - I'm not much of a pumpkin beer guy, especially imperial pumpkin beers. Extreme pumpkin taste can turn me off quickly, however, this beer was good. The combinations of flavors allowed the pumpkin to be forefront but work with the other flavors to make a more well rounded experience. Definitely a treat (ba dum tsssh)."
"O: Simply amazing for a ""pumpkin beer"" easily my favorite of the style even though it is more of an American Porter. Extremely smooth and fresh tasting with pronounced pumpkin flavors. Well done Midnight Sun."
"O-pretty decent. Let it warm up because you wont like it when it is too cold"
"overall: classic fall porter"
"Much improved--chocolate and pumpkin flavors are more pronounced and smooth. Cloves are more in the background. A smoother, more enjoyable pumpkin-nutmeg-cinnamon brew. More viscous mouthfeel. Drank this one colder. That may have something to do with it? Ratings adjusted accordingly."
"Overall a medium-full body with medium carbonation. A rich drinking experience."
"Overall, few beers that are so rare and sought out fail to live up to expectations but I have to say this one does. As a pumpkin beer fan I really really really enjoy this and as a regular craft beer fan I also really enjoy this a great deal because it's ""out-of-the-box"" compared to other examples of the style. A perfect harmony of porter and pumpkin beer; spices are mild, which can often be a problem for pumpkin beers. It's like a brownie and a piece of pumpkin pie procreated and somehow made a beer. Highly recommended as a pumpkin beer and as a regular great craft beer, glad I can finally check it off my bucket/want list."
"Overall: I enjoy the fact that the brewer resisted the temptation to go much higher in abv. I think the flavors worked really well and more alcohol and sweetness wouldn't have helped all that much. I would definitely have another."
"O: Excellent. One of my favorite dark pumpkin ales and one of the best examples of brewing with pumpkin as an ingredient."
"A nice take on the style; I enjoyed the roasty notes that the darker malts provided. One of the better pumpkin ales I've tried."
"Pours black with a thick, large head of beige. Nose is dark malt, pumpkin pie meat, dry nutmeg, some leafy hops. Flavor is lightly sweet dark malt, young hops, dark chocolate, a good long finish with pumpkin pie meat and spices. Gains richness as it opens. Good though I actually want this to be bigger, stronger than it is."
"Drinkability – This is a decent pumpkin beer. Recommended."
"I'm very glad I got to try this one, and on my birthday no less--it certainly was a treat! Thanks, NoSignsOfPain!"
"Overall this is an amazing fall seasonal that combines some of the best aspects of pumpkin beers with an excellent porter. Well worth the money."
"It pours a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a light beige lacing around my snifter. I'm surprised it's this dark. It looks like a porter while I was expecting something in the realm of auburn. In the nose you get plenty of pumpkin, cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie with whipped topping, with a light coffee like bitterness. The flavors are very nice and authentic. You get a lot of chocolate, nutmeg, and cinnamon but the pumpkin is very authentic. It really does taste like pumpkin pulp. The longer it sits in my glass it smells like chocolate ginger snap cookies. Because this one has a base of what seems to be a porter it does drink a little thinner than expected yet leaves behind plenty of real pumpkin behind in the aftertaste. It's a very, very nice and interesting beer. I'm glad I could try it. Midnight Sun is just something else."
"Would definitley have this again but at $12.99 I'm just not THAT big of a fan of Porters in general. To conclude and quite honestly...not sure why this would get any score less than a B+ unless you don't like pumpkin pie, whereas why would you buy it if you didn't?"
"O: A very solid porter on its own, the pumpkin adds a nice touch. Definitely worth checking out."
"Pours a pitch black with no color escaping even when held to light. The finger of foam is a creamy espresso crema color, with decent lacing. The nose has a musty belgian yeast quality with all the spices muddled together, roasted pumpkin with really not much else - i cant make out the cocoa at all. The taste is a bit watered down odd at this abv and also oddly very vegetal, almost a raw grassy taste. It carries light cocoa and coffee as well picked up by yeast and a hint of cloves. Not a favorite."
"Overall: Definitely one of the better pumpkin beers out there and an interesting take on the pumpkin style. If I could find it I would buy again."
"O - Really enjoyed this one...much more stout-esque then any other pumpkin beers I've had. Would def drink again and I think the 2009 was better then the 2010, FYI."
"Finish is fresh with all of the integrated flavor characteristics lingering and sets you up for the next taste."
"O - Very spicey and nice. If you get a chance to try it, do it. Perfect for a nice fall, or in this case, late summer night."
"T: The mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected, but the taste is full of rich pumpkin and chocolate flavors with some nutmeg and cinnamon. Really great beer. I would love some more of this one."
"O: I will credit much of what I disliked with this beer to the age. I'd love to try this again fresh-- would enjoy a bigger chocolate flavor and much more spice balance. As it was, though, it was only okay-- and maybe a little better than that."
"A pretty fun Pumpkin beer, very strange, but in a good way."
"A very rich, tasty and interesting flavor. Certainly the best pumpkin ale I've ever had. A must try."
"O - Good beer, misclassified as a pumpkin ale, as it's definitely a porter with pumpkin pie flavoring. Becomes a bit fatiguing as you drink it, but it's really nice for an ocassional treat (pun intended)."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy light tan head, very minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin notes. The taste is pretty nice, mostly cinnamon/nutmeg. Medium Body. A pretty tasty brew, glad to have gotten a chance to try it."
"(134th)"
"This beer will release it’s true flavor and potential slightly below room temperature. Pours a deep black with a dark tan head. Wonderful aroma of chocolate, cloves, spices. Extremely smooth taste, that concludes with pumpkin as an aftertaste. One of my favorite beers from Midnight Sun, I look forward to it's release each year!"
"This is a medium bodied brew that is modestly carbonated. There are lots of flavors going on in this brew that all work to bring out the enjoyable qualities of pumpkin pie. The abv is well hidden for nearly 8%. My only gripe about this brew is that the pumpkin and spices completely dwarf the porter and chocolate qualities of this brew. The porter aspect is seemingly only evident in this brew's looks. However, the thought of increasing the porter characteristics of this brew would probably mask all of the enjoyable pumpkin qualities that makes this one of the better pumpkin brew's I have had."
"MF/O: Viscous, creamy, velvety feel. Lingering molasses finish. Absolutely awesome and unique- more drinkable than Pumking but less flavorful. Thanks again Todd"
"Pours a nice dark brown with a decent amount of tan head. Well carbonated and looks Great. Smells very interesting. Lots of cloves and nutmeg. Lot of spices and a nice pumpkin on the nose. Tastes pumpkin heavy ith so many spices. A bit hot on the tongue but melds well with the spices. The pumpkin is great. The cocoa is subtle but compliments well"
"O: This is not only one of the strangest concoctions to ever hit my palate, it is also one of the most dessert-like. I plan on getting a few bombers of this stuff once pumpkin ale season hits. Awesome!"
"Big thanks go out to madvermin for this bottle. Definitely one I've wanted to try for quite some time! Pours a dark brown color but is a solid black in the glass. Inch or so of tan head pops up and then quickly fades to a cap that stuck around, no lacing. Aroma is of light pumpkin, lots of clove and cinnamon, butnot much in the way of roastiness or chocolate. Spice dominating the aroma, but it's nice and sweet smelling. Whereas the chocolate and roast are lost in the nose it's made up for in the flavor. Lots of chocolate, roasted pumpkin, spices, and a creamy mouthfeel. Good stuff here. Even with several months of age on it, this beer is still tasting great!"
"Overall, I haven't had a better vehicle for making a traditionally-spiced pumpkin beer. The rich chocolate and light nuttiness are spectacular in conjunction with the spicing. Another massive thank you to Jeff, from both of us."
"R Moe Nay busted this one out for our BA Sexy Chocolate, FW 14th, TREAT, Zhukov tasting with the infamous Zapps. Big ups to him for getting this Alaskan Gem. He told me it's an imperial chocolate pumpkin porter... I told him that I was 98 percent. The look of this beer reminds me of 3AM on Halloween Day.Small tan head without much lacing. Big chocolate aroma, cinnamon, nutmeg, and some actual raw pumpkin. I've never tasted the guts of a pumpkin while I was carving it but smell wise it matches perfectly. Very impressive. The chocolate and raw pumpkin come together nicely. Taste improves dramatically as it warms. I'm tasting some very nice spice as well. Best pumpkin beer I've had to date. Loved it."
"The mouthfeel is is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. Overall, it's a very good beer and an excellent pumpkin beer. I really liked the pumpkin pie and chocolate flavors coming together in it. It had a lot of different flavors, but managed to keep them pretty well in balance. Very nice beer overall, and one of my favorite pumpkin beers I've tried."
"Overall it's a nice and drinkable beer, with a fair amount of complexity. It could stand to be a touch less sweet, though depending on your tastes you might find it to be just right."
"D - one is fine, but too odd for more."
"Medium-heavy body and pretty sticky. Could use a tad more carbonation."
"D: About where I expected this one to be. Chocolate and pumpkin are two things that go together fairly well in my opinion. MS got this this one just right."
"Drinkability is good. This is one of the best pumpkin/fall beers I have had. Right up there with Pumpking and Bourbon Barrel Autumn Maple. The beer benefits a lot from having a great base and not overdoing the spices. Yet the pumpkin/spice isn't hidden either. Definitely worth seeking out if you like the style."
"Overall this is one of my favorite pumpkin beers. I wish it were closer so I could get more for the fall!"
"Drinkability: Drinking this immediately changes whatever environment you are in into post-Thanksgiving. The relaxed flavors work well together, making for an excellent sipper."
"D - Really good stuff. I really enjoyed this one. The muted pumpkin mixed very well with the dark roast and sweet chocolate to form a well rounded porter. One of the best I have had."
"Very dark beer that pours like motor oil with a creamy brown head that dissipates moderately fast. Strong cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose with roast, chocolate and slight booziness coming through. Tastes rich of chocolate and pumpkin with a heavy residual sweetness, almost sickeningly sweet. Little to no hop bitterness. Palate is extremely full, but too sticky sweet."
"D- This one is a few months past its fresh date but considering the style and such it should have not lost too much. I guess I can't really say but all the flavors seems to be a little bland and I was left wanting something more."
"I am not a big fan of spiced beers, but this is a good one. I could and will buy this again."
"This thing had better live up to its name. It pours a slightly garnet-tinged (I blame the mug here) onyx topped by a half-finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises nutmeg, cinnamon, black pepper, graham crackers, very light roasted malts, chocolate, and toasted pumpkin seeds. The taste follows the same lines, though the chocolate is richer and smoother, the pumpkin seeds are diminished, and the spices blend nicely into their surroundings. Good times. The body is a straight medium, with a light carbonation and a silky smooth feel. Overall, I was not at all disappointed with this elixir. Definitely lives up to its name, baby!"
"This beer pours a super dark brown with a brown foam. The aroma is really really pumpkin like and spiced with clove, nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon. There are hints of chocolate and perhaps some wheat in the back of the aroma. The taste is nice and pumpkiny. There is a milk chocolate flavor to the pumpkin spice as well. The beer is a nice good taste, I really enjoy it. The drinkability of this beer is really really smooth and tasty. I really enjoy this beer and am so glad that I had the chance to try it."
"This specific brew is a bit up there in price... but the taste follows suit. I'm certainly looking forward to this fall's release"
"Mouthfeel is awesome, as the thickness and lesser carbonation yield a chocolate pumpkin milkshake of a beer. Drinkability is pretty damn good too, as the finish is actually kind of neutral when you take a step back. This is kind of a letdown compared to the rest of the beer, as I would have liked a strong aftertaste to let the beer linger after every sip, but everything else is too good to let that bother me too much. The fact that it finishes so clean, and hides the 7.8% abv so well, speaks volumes about the drinkability as well. Pumpkin beers perhaps should not be measured by this one due to its mesh of styles, but this definitely has set the bar for spiced beers in my mind. This probably faded a bit since the initial release, but I can see the flavors melding a bit better now than if it was fresh. Nonetheless, it's going to be a long wait to try this fresh this year. Props Midnight Sun...mad props."
"Cheers...."
"4s across the board here; definitely a beer worth checking out. I love pumpkin brews, but the actual pumpkin flavor did disappoint here a bit. I know that it fades fast... so definitely something to check out next year. For all non-pumpkin ale lovers, this is probably a good start- the chocolate and malts overwhelm the pumpkin flavors, and I could see almost anyone enjoying this beer."
"One of the most interesting beers i have yet to try."
"D: This a good beer. As I mentioned, there are quite a few things I would tweak to help balance it out just a bit. A little too much nutmeg and clove for me. I would suggest to anybody who already loves pumpkin ales, but not to the newcomer."
"TREAT is interesting, and certainly not bad, but it is a little bit overwhelming. The spices become less and less pleasant the more I drink."
"D - I have to admit I am disappointed in this one, it doesn't live up to expectations I set for it. Maybe I am a few months out of season and have to try it again. Drinkability not too good considering I am having a tough time finishing this on my own."
"D: Wow, such an enjoyable porter - big and thick, great roast and just enough 'pumpkin' spice. I'm a proponent of all things 'pumpkin' and I'm fully in favor of more such as this. Really delicious and drinkable frequently; can't wait for next year!!!"
"A good beer, but I was slightly disappointed, having high hopes. Where this beer fell short was its lack of spices. Despite listing cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove, I got very little of these throughout my bottle. This was enjoyable, but I preferred St. Arnold's version."
"Medium-full body, very filling. Recommended if you like pumpkin beers, the integration into a porter works well."
"D- This is a very good, interesting brew overall- as the chocolate and pumpkin make an interesting combination of flavors."
"D-this is insanely drinkable, the nose was huge and the flavors are more subtle but it just works. great pumpkin ale that is so well integrated and smooth."
"Bottle poured into my Narke glass, thanks to Mike...Black pour with some decent retention at first, but fades quickly. Light lacing...Interesting aroma that really captures the essence of pumpkin, has some spice and chocolate notes as well. Too much pumpkin for me, but its good...Taste is pumpkin pie on steroids, just terrible. If you like pumpkin then you will like this, if you don't you wont and skip it."
"D: I'm irritated as hell with these $10+ bombers. This one was $12 pre-tax. It's an excellent beer, but at this price....! It's too bad there isn't a good, cheap alternative available around here. If/when Kern River bottles their latest recipe and distributes it locally, Midnight Sun will have to worry. Until then, this is [unfortunately] king of the hill, and it can command its price. Too bad. If it were $6 I'd buy a case of this, and at $8 I'd certainly get 2-3, but at $12 it's pushing the limits of ""don't even buy it at all."""
"Poured a dark brown with ruby brown highlights that had a half finger of brown head and good retention leaving good bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. I could definitely smell the pumpkin alongside cinnamon, allspice, brown sugar, and faint chocolate notes. The taste had more chocolate character which meshed really good with the pumpkin flavor but had cinnamon, alls pice, and slight roasty accents. Thre brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, chocolatey, and creamy finish. It drank great and its probably one of my favorite pumpkin beers so far next to pumking. Really excellent tasty brew."
"(D)- A bit heavy on the spices; would like to see more of the pumpkin and chocolate come through, but it is still rather good as it is."
"This is a well balanced, nicely spiced, well brewed beer. Quite tasty, spicy, and flavorful."
"On the whole, I found the entire thing to be a bit palate wearying. Could use more sweetness. Bit dry."
"An odd ale for sure (chocolate covered pumpkin?), but the disparate elements work very well. Very happy to see this turn up in my market. The best example of the style I've tried so far..."
"D- If I could I would drink the shit out of this beer. This has to be the best pumpkin ale I have had to date. The ABV is well hidden until the ending but this even is blended well into the other flavors. This is the first beer I have had from Midnight Sun. Looking forward to trying some other standout beers from them."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, really. Wonderful flavors and a cool twist by putting together the pumpkin ale aspect with the porter, and I have to wonder how this would be if it was a solid RIS with the same spices (perhaps an upcoming home brew idea?); not too heavy, so I do feel that I wouldn't be weighed down by this; nice and warming on a cool winter night as well; the ABV may kick in after a bit though being close to 8%."
"Had over dinner and poured into a duvel tulip. Pretty black with ruby red highlights around the edges where light hits it, one finger light tan head which fades pretty quick. WOW! PIE! And the best type, nice mellow spices that all mesh nicely with the pumpkin aroma. There is a nice bit of cocoa aroma too. All plays very well together. Really great spice flavors, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, typical pie spices. Great pumpkin quality and again a litte chocolate in there too. Great balance, nothing is too over powering. M&D, don't think I could do a 22oz. of this alone or have it to frequently. Nice rich full bodied mouthfeel. Amazing beer. Gonna hunt this one down again next year."
"I like this autumnal offering. I would not think that Alaska would be the place for one of the better autumn/holiday spiced beers, so this is a nice surprise. This beer is flavorful and drinking nicely at 7.8% ABV."
"Pours dark brown/black with a little tan head. I can smell pumpkin pie spices, chocolate, roasted malts and some ginger. There's a lot going on with the nose on this beer. I can taste pumpkin, spices, chocolate, see where this is going, just like the nose. Then there's an almost minty aftertaste, wow this is great. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is really high, a really good brew. This is one of the more unique pumpkin beers I've had, and I mean unique in a good way, the flavors somehow work together very well. Trade for this if you have to, but get it."
"TREAT is just that. Though not as powerful and overwhelming as I thought it would be, it's nicely balanced and highly enjoyable."
"D - This is a pretty drinkable beer, but it really is limited by its sweetness. I would drink it again for sure, but would never be able to finish an entire bomber on my own."
"D: I would definitely have this beer again. It wasn't quite as robust in flavor as I had hoped for, in particular the chocolate and pumpkin, but still, it was pretty good, and was interesting. No alcohol heat and nothing out of balance."
"This really reminds me of Saint Arnold DR#9. Good stuff if you like pumpkin/spiced beers."
"Overall this was a totally different take on a pumpkin beer or a porter, which ever you want to compare it to. The sweetness started to wear on me and I'll admit this was not a favorite of mine. Still, glad I tried it and it is a totally different take on 2 different styles of beer."
"NOTES: Buy this shit and indulge."
"D: To date, this is probably my favorite pumpkin beer. It doesn't feel the need to knock the pumpkin flavors on your head, but instead allows you to get them on your own. The chocolate is a great addition as well."
"The mouthfeel of TREAT is just a touch thin compared to the best porters in the world, but it holds its own with decent carbonation and good overall feel. There's a touch of bitterness and lingering spice in the finish. This is a drinkable and enjoyable beer. I can't wait to enjoy it again."
"D: Not an amazing beer but a good one. Expensive, but certainly worth a try if you like this style."
"I drainpoured the second half."
"D-Too expensive, but really interesting. Good to have once a year."
"Drinkability - Extremely quaffable. I will say, however, that at $15 dollars a pop (in Southern California) this is a pretty freaking expensive beer. However, that said...it is an extremely enjoyable beer. Very glad I was able to try it. I taste no alcohol in the flavor nor is there alcohol warmth. The overall object of this beer...to be pumpkin pie with chocolate...is immaculately accomplished. An extremely enjoyable beer during this time of year and in the future I would probably get another if I saw it despite the price, though it would have to be for a special occasion."
"Pours thick black with ample tan head that falls to thick lacing. Smells like bananas, nutmeg, pecans, slight booze. Taste is subtile at first, chocolate, more bananas (or maybe that is pumpkin?), tart roast balances out the residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, alcohol isn't really noticable, carbonation is almost too high. As it warms I detect the cinnamon more, and more bitter chocolate. Drinkability isn't that high, as one will do me plenty. Definately a holiday novelty beer for me."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Black in color. Just straight up black. A finger of tan head recedes quickly, leaves some interesting lacing. A LOT goin on on the nose. Smells like a Saison almost with pumpkin pie. I don't get much chocolate, but that nice spicy corn tortilla thing, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, yumness. Tastes like above. Mild sweetness. A little chocolate coming through. Kind of disappointed in the lack of chocolate, but the beer is freakin delicious. Mouthfeel is very creamy. Goes down nicely, but one is enough. GREAT>"
"D: There's not a ton of actual pumpkin flavor here (probably not helped due to this being a porter which masks the fairly subtle pumpkin flavor), but it's still a nice beer."
"Overall - Glad I got to try this. Personally, I think the pumpkin ale - stout/porter hybrid works much better than a regular pumpkin ale after trying this. It's a bit spendy, but if you're looking for a decadent fall-time treat, it will not dissapoint."
"Pour is a midnight black with a low tan head and not too much lacing. The nose is really fantastic with some strong notes of chocolate as well as some clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A bit of actual pumpkin and mild sweetness in there as well. The taste mixes chocolate and pumpkin elements quite well. Really nice feel with the proper amount of spice interwoven with the chocolate. Nice and tasty; I'd give about anything to try out the oak-aged version of this."
"All in all, I really enjoyed this. I have backed off most pumpkin beers, notably Pumpking. This one allowed me to enjoy the experience again. This is really good and I understand why so many people desire this beer. Thanks again Luke for passing my way. More, more, more!"
"God I would love to try this with pumpkin pie. Seriously great beer."
"sticky, not too sweet, roasty, spicy, f'in great."
"D: Overall, this beer is not as bad as my review makes it sound. Still not great, and still not something I'd seek out again, but not as bad as the rest of this review would suggest."
"This lived up to my expectations as a pumpkin pie / porter fan. It didn't blow my mind, but I'll be more than happy to drink this whenever the opportunity arises."
"D: this is a great beer to end an evening with in the fall and I look forward to having it fresh to compare with this slightly cellared version. I would say this is probably the ultimate Halloween beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer, as I found all of the ingredients listed were capable of being picked out. It was a very interesting take on a pumpkin beer and I think the darker malts and cocoa really helped to balance out the pumpkin and spice notes."
"There are a lot of flavors going on here so that adds to the taste. Really unique, and interesting. Very enjoyable."
"Big thanks to Oregonskibum for sending me this sweet bottle. Poured into a tulip. The body is black with about two fingers of mocha colored head that dissipates into minimal lacing. The nose is simply entrancing. Big aromas of chocolate, pumpkin, cloves, nutmeg with a slight sweetness. Wow. This is a killer aroma. The taste is a bit toned down from the aroma. Chocolate malts, a nice hearty pumpkin flavor and a spicy cinnamon/clove finish. The flavors are very well balanced with nothing really overpowering anything else. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and the carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is great, but I can only imagine having this in October."
"Thanks Toby!"
"This is the best pumpkin beer i have ever had! Glad to know that it is coming to socal in a week or two!"
"I found the mouthfeel to be only slightly viscous, medium bodied with a pleasant carbonation thats makes this one very drinkable. The alcohol in this one is only evident as I get towards the bottom of the bottle."
"- Overall very balanced, drinkable, and not overly sweet. I am not a fan of brews like this that get too sweet. High marks on this number."
"Thanks to Jdiddy for cracking this one open. Served in a tulip. Pours the color of cola with a thin swirl of tan-colored foam and a thin, tight band around the edges of the bowl. Huge nose - cinnamon, all-spice and cocoa towards the back. Taste follows nose - it is amazing how the distinctive qualities in the nose coalesce nicely in the flavor profile without being jagged. There's also a bit of an earthy quality, with the cocoa really asserting itself. The flavors start out well-rounded up front with the spices coalescing nicely. A hint of char comes out towards the back. Mouthfeel is is medium-light, with an easy carbonation. This is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, pumpkin beers I've had to date. Incredible complexity and flavor; however, it can be a little cloying in large quantities. Best shared with a few friends."
"m/d - medium body. good carbonation. very drinkable."
"Everything listed on the label showed up at some point, some in stronger doses than others, which made it an exciting ride from start to finish. I have to admit though that I didn't overly enjoy what was going on; however, the brew itself was done very well. I wouldn't jump at the chance to have it again, but I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to try this one. Thanks a lot for making this happen akbeerfiend."
"the dark appearance and the prominent chocolate do well to differentiate this beer from the other pumpkin ales ive had. at the same time, they lead me to expect a heavier, thicker beer. this beer leaves me desiring an imperial stout with pumpkin influence. mmm!"
"Drinkability--8% and I could drink it almost effortlessly. A bomber goes down nicely."
"3.5/4/4/4/3"
"A very decent and enjoyable beer - neither my favourite pumpkin or porter, but perhaps my favourite pumpkin porter!"
"4.5 D: This is definitely among the better pumpkin brews I've had. I'd love to have this again. If it holds up well, I might as well trade for a lot of them. The dark flavors and chocolate are awesome with pumpkin and pie spices."
"D - Sorry i didn't get to have more but i appreciate that i even got to try this. i know i will never see it in a store but if i did this is an obvious one to grab!!!"
"Beer is medium bodied and quite spicy with nice levels of chocolate. Moderate roast / ashiness in the back. I got a little more of a pour and it was quite good. Again, I don't get any oxidation but its a pretty good beer. Not a beer I would normally want to drink on a hot summer day in D.C. but it was a nice treat."
"A very good beer, but in the end I feel a bit let down. There's so much going on that I feel like the final product ends up being less than the sum of its parts. It just didn't totally come together for me in the end."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is pretty strong with notes of pumpkin and ginger. For the flavor I get chocolate, pumpkin pie spices (ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves) and some pumpkin. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very good beer."
"Drinkability doesn't blow me away on either of these brews but is still quite good."
"Drinkability: For the record, a side-by-side review is hard to do when mildly intoxicated, at least when you're reviewing straight in to BA. Still, gonna go out on a limb here and say, for the record, this beer is better than the oak-aged version of TREAT. It's brighter, more authentic, more flavorful, more balanced ... it's just a better beer. Near perfect in many categories, the intermingling of spices, malts, and pumpkin are really an enormous explosion of sensory delight ... thrilled to try it, and at 7.8%, you can't afford to not try it."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with a one-finger tan head that leaves just a little lacing. The smell is nutmeg, cinnamon, something rich and meaty, cocoa, dark fruit, stone. The taste is sweet and rich, heavy on the spices but not cloying, with a meaty, malty undertone and a slightly bitter finish. It's moderately carbonated, thick in body. One to savor."
"Smooth and well balanced, this is porter first, pumpkin ale second. Easily one of my favorite pumpkined beers. Phenomenally drinkable, this is one that I could finish myself."
"D-Nice stuff! Full of flavour and complexity this is certainly a TREAT and not a TRICK!"
"The taste has a lot more porter character than the aroma would have led you to believe... definitely more toward the sweet side of things than a roasty, robust porter. Sweet side of the spectrum with chocolate and spices. Not too much pumpkin here or in the aroma come to think of it. Just a hint. Really nice and creamy mouthfeel. Clearly a well crafted beer, it just didn't blow me away. Note that I'm not a huge pumpkin beer fan though."
"This was great and all, but disappointed me in a couple areas. I would have liked some more chocolate! The spiciness of this brew would have been nicely complimented with a little more sweetness. Secondly, it could have been a little thicker. Minor gripes aside, a wonderful beer."
"J"
"d - I really enjoyed this pumpkin porter. I liked how the pumpkin came out in the taste and that the spices weren't overwhelming. Very nice and would like to have again sometime."
"Bottle courtesy ditmier. Pours a dark clear brown with a small beige head, unassuming but full of absurd spice orgy nonsense. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove are everywhere, flanked by pumpkin flesh. Pumpkin pie liqueur, perhaps? Flavor is similar to the smell, but with some more backing malts and a touch of smokiness. Easily the best pumpkin beer I've had yet."
"The taste is mostly spices up front. It kind of resembles a pumpkin but it's far from a home run. The rest of the beer is your standard sweet porter with some chocolate coming through in the back. The mouthfeel is full with low carbonation and a drying, slightly tannic finish. The drinkability was nice...I wasn't super impressed with this beer, but even though we had some better stuff to open after this beer, drinking half a bomber was no chore."
"A treat indeed, Pumpkin Ale and Porters are two of my favorite Autumn styles and Midnight Sun has managed to meld both into a well crafted and tasty little package of goodness. I'd love to have something like this released around here every Fall."
"Poured a deep, deep brown, rather thick our with a small tannish head. Nose is cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon and light pumpkin. Taste is more cocoa, cinnamon and nutmeg forward to me, subtle pumpkin. Mouthfeel is nice, coating and warm, tinge of booze, cinnamon and cocoa all blend well. Very good."
"Overall I've wanted to try this for a while and it didn't disappoint. The easiest-drinking pumpkin beer I can remember having, worth seeking out."
"Overall: mouthfeel is medium bodied with weak carbonation, which I prefer in porters. Drinakbility is pretty good, a bomber for one person is just right."
"Great drinkability for an imperial porter. This and the oak aged version are about as good as pumpkin beers get."
"taste is of strong pumpkin, spice, chocolate, and a little bit of hops in the back, ends with a strong pumpkin aftertaste, and some bitterness."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle courtesy of mymrnngjckt. 2008 vintage uncapped and poured into my Duvel tulip. Appears a dark opaque brown color with a good two fingers of creamy, dense ecru foam. The head will not die! A good looking pour from start to finish. Nose and flavors consist of spices - nutmeg, clove, brown sugar, bittersweet chocolate, dry cocoa, pumpkin pie with a chocolate cookie crust, roasted pumpkin meat, spicy, peppery cinnamon. Carbonation is a bit high and the body could be a tad fuller, but otherwise, pretty decent. Thanks for the chance to try this one Kevin!"
"Drinkability: A pleasure, disappears quickly. Liquid desert."
"This beer's official name is Imperial Chocolate Pumpkin Porter. Its nickname is T(he) R(oyal) E(ccentric) A(le) T(reatment), which doesn't make much sense. In any case, Midnight Sun has themselves a winner with this Imperial porter-pumpkin ale hybrid. Thanks to sprucetip for digging into his cellar just for me."
"The beer is medium bodied and well carbonated. The alcohol adds the flavors of the beer, which are well blended. This is a beer I would like to revisit in the future for sure."
"Thanks, mreusch (from the other site), for the opportunity"
"Cucurbitas unite under this banner, for you are the chosen fruit!"
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable. Mildly heavy yet easy to drink in a very pleasant way! Really good!!"
"D: Less porter character than I was expecting from an ""imperial porter."" Seems like they blended a Southern Tier Pumking with a nice porter, resulting in these two different characters (pumpkin spice and darker malts) that alternate in dominance. A lighter mouthfeel and perfect job on the spice make this a very drinkable beer. Quite the T.R.E.A.T.!"
"Overall - Not impressed. At all. I was psyched to get my hands on this and it failed to deliver on all aspects. Very one dimensional on the pumpkin front and very little (to no) chocolate or porter. The pumpkin and spices more than dominate the brew and take away any enjoyment from this beer. Not recommended as a porter, however, if you absolutely LOVE pumpkin beers then this is worth seeking out."
"D: Very drinkable as it has a nice balance between bitter and sweet. Very interesting beer and enjoyable to sip on. Wish this one was more readily available!"
"D - Wow! This is kind of like chocolate-dipped Pumking. TREAT is simply a delicious, full-bodied and complex porter. This one was hyped up quite a bit, but it definitely lived up to my expectations. Many thanks to akbeerfiend for the trade!"
"D - Definitely not one to drink quickly. Extremely complex and meant to be sipped and savored. Excellent tasting beer without much of a hint of alcohol despite being at 7.8%. Not one to drink fast, but does go down pretty easily if you are so inclined. Another great beer from MS. Glad to have a chance to try this one."
"I like how the pumpkin taste isn't fake tasting but realistic and hearty like pumpkin should be. Not this pumpkin pie type aspect which can taste phony."
"This poured a nearly opaque black ruby with a little bit of dark tan head. It smelled like roasted barley and sweet pumpkin and earthy dark chocolate, with a little bit of oak and bitter coffee and salty cashews. It tasted like rich dark chocolate and pumpkin and roasted barley, with some coffee and cinnamon and cashews. It was somewhat thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very interesting and complex beer that was still clean and delicate. It hid the alcohol well and had good body too, so it was easy to drink. This is another unique brew from Midnight Sun that was fun to try and enjoyable to have once, but it didn't end up being super delicious to me."
"D: Tasty perfect beer to enjoy right before my Thanksgiving dinner."
"Taste was pretty unique. The pumpkin and chocalate are there and noticable but not over-powering, very well balanced and complex at the same time. The mouthfeel is an array of flavors ending in a sweet candy finish. This isn't the most drinkable beer, as far as pounding a few in the Raiders parking lot with the boys, but it is a tasty beer that goes well with a cold night and talking shit around the fire."
"The mouth is creamy, yet wet. Not the smoothest, but not lacking in subtle bite either. Just right. These flavors mix ever so wonderfully. The pumpkin is there, but it is mild and tame. The chocolate is also there, but not in your face. This is balanced perfectly. Nice little bite from the hops right smack in the middle as well. Finishes roasted and bready. Dang. This beer sat me down and taught me a thing or two. I want more. Also, I think I may make a chocolate pumpkin pie this year. This was stellar."
"Tasty, but perhaps too complicated for its own good."
"Overall, I don't think I could use the word 'spice' enough for this beer. That is pretty much all it is. Not for me. Not drinkable at all. I couldn't get through but maybe 5 oz and that was tough."
"This is an excellent beer, but one suggestion I would make is not to drink this beer too cold. Fresh out of the fridge I thought the mouthfeel just a bit thin, but the beer seemed to gain some additional richness and flavor as it warmed up. In any event, yet another very fine beer from MS. Thanks Frank!"
"Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a dark brown with a small head. Aroma is dominated by spices--allspice, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg. Flavor of roasted malt, some sweet notes, and lots of the spices mentioned above. No real pumpkin flavor, just spices, but this is a solid beer."
"Overall a very solid approach here to a very interesting blend of flavors. I have to say the streak continues and I have never had a bad one from Midnight Sun. I will be enjoying this one again, very, very soon."
"ICPP is a beer that I've been wanting to try for ages now. The whole mix of porter, pumpkin and chocolate seem right to me. I thoroughly enjoy this beer and although that odd spiciness does get in the way a bit it in no way ruins my experience with this beer. Thanks for the great trade Beast I'm looking forward to the next!"
"Pours dark brown with huge frothy tan head that stays a while. Active carbonation, and lacing that mostly slides away but some that sticks. SMELL is sweet, spicy, boozy. Pumpkin, nutmeg, chocolate, cinnamon, and even some malty notes. TASTE follows the nose. Sweet, spicy, chocolate and just a bit of booze. Pumpkin, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and barely noticeable backing hop bitterness blend delicately into a very smooth, balanced, and complex sensation. Sooo close to perfect. FEEL is soft carbonation, rich, creamy texture and a medium body. Clean finish. OVERALL this is a special treat and way way too easy to drink."
"Medium carbonation, a bit thin in the finish. Very smooth though."
"D: Easily approachable, creamy beyond measure despite its thickness and redolent spice."
"Overall, this one is out of the park. My first Midnight Sun and I am in love."
"2008. Pours dark brown to black with a one finger medium tan head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is some nice pumpkin pie spices mixing well with the sweet malty porter. Chocolate is harder to come by, perhaps some cocoa powder, more of the spices and porter. Taste follows with the pumpkin pie and porter sweetness up front, some tangy acidity comes in mid taste, a cinnamon finish lingers into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, nice soft carbonation works well and gives the full feel, though the body is not too heavy. Overall a good beer, not as stellar as the oak aged version I had a while back, perhaps the spices in this sample are just a little over the top for me. Mouthfeel is beautiful though as is the porter that resides within. Thanks George for the opportunity."
"Lighter but not unusual for this style. Incredibly milky, all flavors mentioned above and crafted smoothly to put together an amazingly smooth and one of a kind porter. The pumpkin flavors are pleasing and dance nicely amongst the great and not overdone use of spices. The burnt malts stand nicely in the back, and don't take over the show but make their presence known in the best way possible. The chocolate malts here seem a little reserved, but play nicely with the other flavors. BRAVO Midnight Sun, I wasn't sure if this was going to be an overhyped offering, I couldn't have been more wrong."
"I am very surprised that I don't have much to add. The chocolate is more a mildly sweetened milk chocolate, with the base porter being mildly roasty (not as roasty as my earlier review notes). The coffee character is minimal, but the balance of flavors on the palate is incredible. Meaty caramelized pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, chocolate, this is beautifully complex and incredibly enjoyable. The moutfeel is outstanding. Medium-bodied, the soft creamy carbonation lifts the gently sweet palate, and emphasizes the blend of chocolate and pumpkin on the finish. I'm updating my scores to reflect my more curmudgeonly self now."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Very similar to the aroma. The balance between roasted pumpkin, spices and chocolate is incredible. The pumpkin flavor is very pronounced here, unlike most pumpkin ales, which tend to rely more on spices to create a pumpkin-like character. The malt foundation is subtle but big enough to support the unusual adjuncts, lending an undercurrent of toasty sweetness and mild bitterness. Semi-sweet, spicy finish with a lingering hint of pumpkin. Fantastic stuff, by far the best pumpkin ale out there and one of the best beers I've had all year."
"Thanks to AlaskaJoe for hooking this one up! With a name like Imperial Chocolate Pumpkin Porter, this beer could be either really good or really bad. Luckily I was pretty damn good. Poured a nice dark dark brown that let little light through with a tan head that dissipated slowly. The smell was awesome! Almost better than the taste. A nice blend of chocolate and pumpkin that made me drool a little each time I took a whiff. The taste was just as solid. You could make out the chocolate and the pumpkin individually but they played well together. I was surprised by this beer, I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It was a very smooth porter, much more complex then I had anticipated and the best of the pumpkin beers I've had if you throw it in that category. Would love to try this again and it's oak aged brother."
"Dark brown. Small, quickly diminishing light tan head that lasts decently. Nice nose. Flavor has some richness and depth to it uncommon in a pumpkin porter. Very smooth, with an elegant mouth feel. Still doesn't quite have the loads of extracted flavors I prefer, but still has some nice chocolate and pumpkin notes. Nice pumpkin ale overall."
"It's probably not a fair comparison but this is, without a doubt, the best pumpkin-infused beer I've ever had. Very drinkable with a completely non-existent alcohol presence. Big thanks again to Joe for this rarity."
"D: Good. Very balanced."
"D: Very drinkable despite the spices.Totally different than anything else I have ever had. I wish I could try this on cask. My first midnight sun brew and hopefully not my last."
"Notes from 11/28/07"
"This beer is definitely not retired and is released in October of every year in Alaska, arrived the day after Halloween or it would have been drank that night, this beer was one of the more complex things I have ever drank, I have to try the oak aged version now to see if this could get any more interesting but I struggle to see how that is possible, cannot wait to drink this again in the future, recommended"
"D- For such a rich beer, it's not too heavy and also not obsenely alcoholic"
"I can drink this all day, too bad ill probably never see it again."
"D: Can I have some more please?"
"If you like sweet spicy, holiday beers, you'll like this one."
"I will start begging Frank now to hook me up with the 2008 version this fall. I also have the oaked version here to try and compare... but at 7.8% drinking alone I think that is for another day. Bravo to Midnight Sun for another fantastic beer."
"Nice mouthfeel. Creamy. There is a little dancing on the tongue."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly thin, mildly tart, tasty, chewy, with a touch of cinnamon hitting the tongue during the swallow."
"first of all. THIS BEER IS NOT RETIRED!!! It is a seasonal release and is one of midnight suns best sellers. They have no intention of retiring it. And the alcohol should be listed at 7.8% However youd be lucky to find a bottle in the stores and wont at the brewery until next season. This beer pours a dark black with the teeny tiniest red hue. The head is a dark tannish brown, but fades rather quickly. The nose is very porter with obvious pumpkin spice and faint chocolate and coffee. the taste flips flops harder than Al Gore. The taste is of chocolate and coffee mix and the pumpkin takes a back seat, or maybe just sits bitch in the front. The middle of the taste is where the pumpkin starts to show up and fades with the malt and hops in the finish. Taste lingers and chocolate flavor hangs on the lips. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth and creamy, but not as soupy as an imperial stout. The carbonation is suprisingly good, but not abrasive at all. Perfect carbonation in my opinion. I would kill somebody, maybe even a member of my family to get some of the oak aged version of this from an older vintage. Incredibly drinkable, and lingering flavor. Another fine offering from m sun. Those boys sure know how to brew em."
"Liquid Pumpkin pie, no bull. this brew pours black with a dark, dark tan head that retains well and leaves a nice lace. the smell is pumpkin pie, the taste is also pumpkin pie with some cream taste to it at least i taste it. the mouth-feel is perfect not too thick, but thick, not flat, but not overcarbonated either, a good porter mouth-feel. and given the viscosity, take your time with it, savor it."
"Overall: I'm very torn by this beer. I like it, it's quite drinkable, and I'd drink it again. However, I absolutely wouldn't pay $8 for a bomber again (maybe $5.) It's a solid robust porter, a semi-decent imperial porter, but almost zero as a pumpkin porter, or a chocolate porter. I don't know: I guess I feel like if you're going to turn out a unique, out in left field beer like this, it should be a little more, well, unique."
"All in all, no regrets having split a bomber of this. Also no regrets having only bought one."
"Mouthfeel is medium-thick but amazingly silky. Helps the chocolate flavor hang around and sweetens it up a bit. Wonderful and adds a great deal to the beer. Carbonation is moderate."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat thin and I feel there is a tad too much carbonation. But on the other hand it fits this beer well. I could drink this one all day."
"Big ups to Timmcd64 for hooking me up.. Proper!"
"Note: I give the drinkability a 4 mainly because I can't see drinking more than one or two of these at a time. Very much a good dessert beer though!"
