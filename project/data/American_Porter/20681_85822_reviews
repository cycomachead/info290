"Pours a near jet black with thick, frothy tan head. Aroma is cocoa and coffee. Mouthfeel is rich and very palatable and smooth similar to a stout. Tastes is dark chocolate and coffee with a toned down roasted nut character and slight smokiness on the back end. Overall, everything I want in a porter...which is also the same stuff I expect in a good stout."

"Very impressed with this big Porter. As promised, this is a robust, hop forward, complex offering with plenty of body and an outstanding tan-dark appearance with a head to boot."

"Overall - This is a quality crafted porter."
"Easily one of my favorite porters. Has a bolder body than most porters and its silky smooth and almost no bitterness."
"King Titus is a great American Porter. It is dark and thick and has a great mouth feel and is a great sipping beer."
""

"Good but just nothing to memorable..."
"4.1/5: Gorillas were always the most badass of primates, y'know"

"O-A complex, well balanced Porter. One of the best I've ever had because it is everything a porter should be and more. A bit boozier than normal porters and hoppier as well. The nuance and balance are phenomenal."
""

""

"Bold, roasty flavor to begin with. And an incredibly smooth finish as expected"

"Overall:  Wow, what a spectacular porter!!  I love the strong flavors of roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate and coffee.  Such deliciously strong flavors all wrapped up into an extremely smooth quaff!  Highly recommended."
"Smooth, subtle notes of chocolate coat the palate. Easy drinking porter"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown, almost black with a khaki colored head that trails the glass as you drink. The smell was full of toasted elements with some nutty flavors coming through on the end. The taste was much more balanced than I was expecting with those toasted and nutty flavors but also a good amount of hops and bright flavors to make this an enjoyable beer year round. Loved it."

"It has the body I want, rich and full but not heavy and leaning back from heavier stout territory.  It's creamy and rich, crispness at a higher level for a porter but not distracting too much."
""
""
""
""
"Good brew."
""
""
""
"What a porter should be. Not a stout, but with a big enough and rich enough body to be something beyond amber or brown. Jet black with a light head it is less viscous as the color would lead you to believe. The aroma is dried fruit and chocolate but, again, not as deep as what would be expected from a darker roast. The flavors are similar. Where you'd might expect something that was boozy and bittersweet, this beer is a scaled back version. Rich, creamy, the roasted malt comes out middle to finish with a bit of acidity in the end. Medium heavy body and lively carbonation."

"O:Lots of smokeyness on mine, I drank it a couple months after buying it, but it didnt taste bad at all, very good brew, but would have liked to try it fresh."

"500ml bottle purchased at the Drinkery in Derry, New Hampshire. Dark black, good head. Aroma was dark malts, only the slightest hint of chocolate. Flavor was much the same and I must say I was a little let down after being so impressed by Lunch. Oh well, glad to have tried this one."

"Overall: This is another solid effort from MBC that I would recommend to anyone. Easy enough to drink even at 7.5% (maybe too easy). I am intrigued by the ""special effects"" nature of the hops. This is a very good beer whether it is a porter or stout."

"This beer is a fairly complex and hoppy porter, with a touch of hops bitterness in both the scent and flavor. Dark malts also provide some bitterness and depth of flavor. A beautiful pour with a good head and lacing, yet is smooth and not as carbonated as the head would make it seem. Slight bits of chocolate flavor ans sweetness appear here and there. Overall, a very enjoyable and unique porter."
""
""
"I enjoyed this more the more it warmed up.  The chocolate and roast notes seemed to open up more.  This is a fairly viscous porter, with a ton of flavor.  Nicely done."

"Finishing things off here at the VDubb household with another new porter (though the portery-ness of the I&G is still very much in question).  This one pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of burnt sienna foam.  The nose comprises dark cocoa powder, roasted malts, mild treacle, light coffee, something that seems like brown sugar, and a bit of chocolate-covered orange peel.  The taste brings in more of the same, though everything has an extra layer of toast, and there's a firm undercurrent of dank greens, tobacco, and candied orange peel.  It's these additions that really ruin things for me, undermining and subverting the positivity of everything that came before it.  I'm claiming over-hopping on this one.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.  Overall, a good porter that appears to suffer from a misguided zeal to overhop things.  Shame, really, even if it doesn't completely destroy things."

"Bottle poured into an English pub glass. An absolutely pitch black brew, maybe just a touch of muddy brown, with a decidedly impressive four fingers of mocha colored creamy head. Aroma is dark and roasted, black coffee, bittersweet chocolate, burnt almonds, and a little campfire ash with a subtle sweet top note. Palate largely mirrors this. This is a deep, dark, roasted porter with a sneaky citrus hop flavor lurking in the background and a whole heap of dark chocolate almond, coffee, and singed grain flavors out front. Quite smooth and creamy, although the resinous spicy notes will pop a little. Getting some ash, toasted nut, and strong tea in the dry finish. Overall impression is dry, roasted, minimal sweetness ... Perhaps just enough brown sugar to provide some balance and complexity. The roastiest of the Maine Beers I've sampled to date (which is most of them) and certainly a top tier porter, although my own preference swings toward the slightly sweeter ""brown porter"" style as opposed to the ""robust"" take."
""
" Overall: I don’t know why I haven’t tried this before. This isn’t the ""Buckets full of Hops"" that M.B.C. are used to contributing to their beers. This is tasty and also walks the thin line of being an Imperial Porter. Don’t get me wrong about the hops. It doesn’t lack them either. Like a fine Belgian beer, the hops aren’t in for flavoring. They are used for the dryness of the flavor and bitterness to cut the sweetness ( which does a fine job at that). This beer is rock solid. I wish I had another bottle that is how much I enjoyed this beer. This is Recommended."

"Overall: Sneaky 7.5%. Balanced roast and chocolate. I would love to see how this would taste on nitro. My favorite Maine Beer Co. beer thus far."
"Overall: Truth be told. Maine Brewing Company made a killer Porter when they brew King Titus! This is almost an exact replicate of HF Everett. The biggest difference between King Titus and Everett is when the beer warms up; Everett remains malty and roasty. While King Titus showcases a mild hoppy bitterness that balances nicely with the chocolate and roast malts. Everett edges out King Titus overall, but King titus is alot easier to aquire. So its a draw and you can go wrong with either Porter in my opinion. I have had many hoppy offerings from MBC and really enjoyed alot of them, but this is definately my favorite beer from MBC! Seek it out folks King Titus will not dissapoint you."

"Overall - A tasty American Porter with an excellent roasted malt and bitter cocoa profile with the hint of the earthy hops adding as a nice support unit in this brew. I admire the support that Maine Beer Company provides to a number of great causes."

"Overall: while the beer is a solid beer, this is my least favorite of the beers in the MBC lineup."
""
""
""
" I didn't want to like this beer as much as I did, its just not fair that everything I've had from these guys so far has been awesome. I find it odd they put a BB date of 90 days on a strong porter but I guess the hops do play a major role."
""
""
""
"Overall - It tastes pretty good up front, but the finish detracts. A lot of brown ale aspects with an intense burnt malt flavor in the back."
""
"O - I'm a huge fan of Maine Beer Comapany, not necessarily the prices. This is a porter I would highly recommend to anyone. Cheers to King Titus, the silverback gorilla of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund... may he rest knowing he inspired this truly outrageous porter."
""
"A pretty well-rounded, heady, and enjoyable American porter, the sweetness sublimated just enough to keep things on an even keel. I'm not quite sure where the freshness in such an offering comes into play - perhaps the hops that do their good work here behind the scenes, when too old, become overtly unpleasant and unworkable? Maybe, whatever, this is very drinkable right now, as urged, even with the 15-proof booze."
""
""
"O: Like Maine's other beers, King Titus is a well made and tasty beer. Very much drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A full bodied and well hopped porter, with a great balance and depth of flavour. Assertive hop flavour blends well with the dark malt. Not much else to say than this is another really well put together beer, very drinkable with a satisfying and intriguing complexity. Nothing disappointing about this, outstanding hoppy porter."

"Bold, dark look and smelled of chocolate, hops, and burnt smoke. Taste of chocolate upfront and some nice bitterness from the hops. Slick, smooth mouthfeel makes for one tasty porter. Again, Maine Beer Co. has outdone themselves. Really liked this porter."
""
""
""
"O- Second only to Founders from what I've tried thus far for Porters. Well done."
"The beer is near black with a thick, soapy, beige collar. The aroma brings beautiful roast character and milk chocolates. Chocolate forward with moderate bitterness in the back. Smooth on the palate with a zesty kick from the hops. A solid example of the style. My primary complaint with Maine Beer Co. is the price. $7 per 500 mL is too much to pay for porters, IPAs, pale ales and the like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Back to Maine Beer for a moment. I've never had a beer from them that has absolutely blown my mind with its flavor profile. But their beers are so well-balanced, it's almost criminal. If they brew it, it's gold. King Titus is no different."
"M: The acidity of the hops leads towards a dry finish, spicy aftertaste. It is not a sryupy beer; almost refreshing sharp with a light and lingering sweetness, that would be a good choice of style to drink on warm Maine nights as cold winter days."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a huge head, almost half the glass, very slow to sizzle off, fairly dense even with a good mix of differing bubble sizes, the lacing forms a broad intricate spider webbing across the glass sides. The liquid is a fully opaque dark brown to black, barest hint of orange at the glass bottom, looks as much a stout as anything. The nose is dry and very roasty, malty with powerful presence in the dark chocolate, coffee bean, coconut flakes department all the while staying nicely balanced, adds complexity via white grapefruit zest, roasted nuts, tar, charcoal and campfire smoke, as pleasing for not pushing the envelope too far as for what it does offer. Light to medium-bodied, smooth but has grip and traction and in no way evanescent nor wimpy. More milk to lactose, vanilla bean here to pair with the chocolate and coffee, restrained sweetness. That curious grapefruit bursts through here too, retronasally floral, makes you think there’s some sneaky hops lurking about. Not as earthy here, some of that coal tar stuff but that’s it. Carbonation level is active, yet lets the primary flavors soak in and lengthen. Clean finish. The paucity of fruit flavors is odd, minor cherry to dark berry at best. Extremely well done."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is a gorgeous beer, not far from Hill Farmstead Everett. The beer transitions from a chewy sweet milk chocolate with caramel onto a smooth long transition into a dark bitter coffee."
""
""
"Overall, this beer was disappointing. Looked and smelled nice, taste was lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly burned chocolate and roasted malt smell. Tastes the same, with a nice roasted and ashy flavor plowing through. A little bit of bitterness but not hoppy. Maybe not King, but Prince indeed. This porter can hang with the big boys. It is the most similar beer to Edmund Fitzgerald (the King) I have had. Wasnt expecting it to topple Founders and Black Butte. Well done Maine Beer folks."
""
""
"O: This is an outstanding porter. One of my favorites of the group. Compares very well to Stone's Smoked Porter or Yazoo's Sue."
""
""
"Overall a superior porter. Nice and dry."
""
""
""
"Enjoyed on tap at Plan b in Simsbury, CT.  Absolutely delicious porter.  Pours very dark and with a tan-colored rocky head.  Mouthfeel is full - bodied and rich, it is full from start to finish.  Chocolate and toasted malt flavors dominate without tipping into stout territory.  I haven't had anything from Maine Beer that disappointed, and this is no exception."

"Quite dark brown appearence, might be confused as a stout at first glance. Aroma has lots of chocolate and roast with some coffee and oak, maybe even some chestnut. Taste has chocolate, roast, coffee and nuts. Very well balanced. Nicely done Porter by Maine Beer Company!"
""
""
"500ml bottle: This one pours an opaque, dark brown color. There was a dense, crea,y tan head on it that lingers a bit and leaves some lacing. The aroma is nice. Roasted malts and some coffee. Hints of some caramel and chocolate. The taste is good. Some roasted malts and coffee notes on top. Subdued chocolate in the background. Slightly biter: no sweetness at all. A very nice beer."
""
""
"This is a great beer to accompany reading or to enjoy with friends during a long, cool afternoon. The roasted nature brings out some funk from a Chimay soft cheese."

"O: One of the better porters I've had. Nicely balanced, a great combination of roasted malts hops and alcohol. Just an all-around great brew."

"O: A great drink. Was gone before I knew it and I was ready for a second. ABV crept up on me. I will look for this in stores."
""
"Pours a deep brown almost black color with appreciable tan head, thin tan collar, some tan swirls when agitated. Aroma is of coffee, roasted malt, some burnt earth. Taste is lighter malt that the nose lends to. Some coffee in the mid palate and a touch of char towards the end. Nice thick body and medium carbonation."
"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/22/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, coffee, oats, light citrus, light pine, floral, grass, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, coffee, oats, light citrus, light pine, floral, grass, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roast/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, dark bread, coffee, light pine, floral, grass, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malts and moderate hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, moderately slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent porter. All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall: I probably waited to long to try this as it’s kind of all over the map at this point. The remaining bitterness is almost herbal and too bitter. There is an unpleasant smokiness coming through and the carbonation does not help. Not sure what it’s like fresh, but it’s probably better to drink it sooner rather than later."
""
"This is not one of my favorite porters by a long shot, way too many char flavors for my liking. That said, it is a decent beer. Probably will never buy it again though."
""
"Let me preface this review by stating I am typically black/white on my porters/stouts - stouts should be heavy, dry, slow sippers high in alcohol and porters should be lighter and sweeter. That being said, this is one of the few porters I have found that straddle the line and do it so well. It is a dark brown to black color, really depending on the light and your eyes, with one finger head that dies slow with lace patches on glass. The aroma is basically a dry, roasted malt aroma but there is a nice chunk of dark chocolate kicking around. The beer is medium bodied, no easy sipper but not necessarily chewey or bready, per se, and I find that dark chocolate is really pronounced with the roasted malts for this balance of sweet and dry, and at a couple of points I believe I pinpointed some dark fruits like raisins and a touch of alcohol in the finish, which to be honest I don't really get any hoppy bitterness in this beer except on the backend as my beer warmed up (I am a slow sipper)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a really good, just short of great. The bottle has a ""drink no later than 90 days from 092413"" mark, so it may be a little past its prime."

"Overall- This is a really good porter. I would certainly have this one again. The only criticism I might level is the lack of any sense of sweetness."
"Pours jet black, full dark, with thick fluffy off white foam. Slow settling. Light chocolately nose. Modest coffee too. Hint of vanilla. Smooth light roasted flavor with dark chocolate expertly filtered through. Subtle bitter ticks in. Really flavorful. Great porter. Fantastic."
"D - I have tried 2 Maine beers now and both need to really warm up to get the full flavors. Both were very smooth and went down way to easy."

"Pours a very dark dirty motor oil brown, bordering on black, capped by a one and a half finger tan head. Above average tend, splotchy lacing here and there. Very inviting nose, cocoa powder and big roasted malt accents with some espresso undertones dominate. Opens with semisweet chocolate, toffee, and roasted malt, joined by whipped cream and espresso accents. Finishes with the perfect level of roastiness as the bittering hops join in. Smooth, creamy medium body. Consider me impressed, one of the better porters I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"Mouthfeel is good. Moderate carbonation and medium to light body gives this a nice soft feel and keep it refreshing through the charred bitterness."

"Smells like Ten-tidy and taste resembles Founders Porter, IMO. Nice company to be in, yet there are still enough subtle nuances to distinguish itself. My favorite from MBC. A spectacular job and one to seek out and try for yourself. I fully enjoyed this!"
""
"Mouthfeel is again very appropriate- medium body, moderately carbonated and slightly syrupy. This is a very good porter, and should I feel the need for a porter, I will come back to this one."

"And I want another one. Right now."

"O - solid American porter. No complaints here."
"A towering light brown head in my stemmed glass that stays into next week. Chunks of lace on the glass. Super dark brown beer is opaque and allows no light through. Syrupy coating on the sides. Smell is roasty and delicious Healthy amounts of grain and dark chocolate. Huge portion of coffee. A dark fruitiness yields currants and dates. Taste us superb. When cold it is quite good but as it warms the balance really starts to shine. Dark roasted grains in the front with a steaming java cup cradling it. Mild dark bread with a molasses sweetness. Bitter chocolate in the hoppy finish. Nice chewy feel with a surprisingly crisp carbonation and slightly sticky presence on the lips. A touch of creaminess at time. While chewy it is lighter in the mouth than you would surmise from what I am saying. Goes down easily for something this heavy. A superb beer that I look forward to drinking again."

"Poured into a pint glass and a nice, dense, tan head developed with great retention and lacing. Appearance was dark brown to black. Aroma was of bread, dried fruits (raisins) with some subtle coffee and chocolate notes. Great tastes of malt, chocolate and coffee with hints of grain and wood. All aspects of the taste were subtle and well balanced. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a dry, sweet and bitter, aftertaste."
"Superb look and smell up front. Great scent of chocolate, roasted peanuts, and hints of milk and coffee. The taste is about as good as it gets in this style. Rich, smooth, flavorful, and satisfying from the first taste. Rich and creamy mouth. Probably my favorite Maine beer, which says a lot. And if I'm not mistaken, this is a bit cheaper than most others, which makes it even better. Definitely a superb beer."
"King Titus is one of the best porters I've ever had. It even gives Founders version a run for its money. Rich, complex,bold, but never overdone. An expertly crafted beer and one I will buy often in the future."
""

""

"Pours a very deep brown with a nice 1 inch mocha head. Smell is chocolate, cocoa, with a little coffee and roasted malts. Taste is cocoa and chocolate with a hint of hop bitterness and oatmeal. Medium body with medium tolow carbonation. Overall a very good porter."
""
"Extremely creamy and roasty, mellow hoppy bitterness, long lingering aftertaste of bitter dark chocolate and mild ashy char. Light green hops in the background. Everything is balanced and all elements are in sync. Very polished and enjoyable all around, nothing out of place. Great stuff, very happy MBC has finally arrived in Chicago."
""

"Overall this will stand up to some of the best porters I've had and I'll be buying this one again for sure"

"This isn't a stout? This is an incredibly thick, luscious, velvety porter. An excellent choice for dessert, although I imagine it would make a great breakfast all by itself on a weekend."

"Overall I was expecting a top shelf traditional porter, instead I found that this is a beer I may have to try again to appreciate."

"22 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with long lasting, foamy beige head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready, toasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate and hint of dried fruit. Body is medium, creamy and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and coffee, followed by earthy hops. Finish is long and bittersweet. Excellent, delicious Porter."
"O: Overall this beer is fantastic. I am certain that porter, stout, and even barley wine lovers will find this beer to their satisfaction. I will be buying more of this in the future if it is available. I highly recommend that others seek it out."

"a great american robust porter on tap at the brewery. it pours a dark Hershey syrup color, plenty thick, with a half inch or so of creamy tan head. the nose is pretty hoppy for a porter, complimenting the very dark chocolate malts and burnt toast grain aroma. cocoa powder and toffee hints as well. the taste is all of this, but more bitter than even the nose could give a clue to. its hoppy and all, but most of the bitterness appears to be from the burnt barley here, and there is a touch of smoke too. creamy texture, fuller bodied, but still a little thin somehow, despite being so decadent, and a mellow but adequate carbonation level. visiting maine beer was a real treat, all the beers were exceptional, and king titus is one of the better porters ive had in a while, just expertly made."
"Annoys me that you guys rate this so highly. It tastes like crap. It's almost as bad as Firestone Walker Reserve's Porter. Not sure what it is about porters that if they are not good I want to pour them out. But I'm hugely disappointed by this one. It's just the taste - the color, smell, mouthfeel is all fine. But unfortunately the taste it most important to me. Up front it's OK, like any decent porter, not great. But the aftertaste is just totally lackluster like dirty cardboard dipped in soda water."

"Pours with a small head that provides good lacing effect while drinking. Aroma is a bit light but an enjoyable roasted malt. Mouthfeel is a pleasant creaminess that makes this porter highly drinkable. The alcohol is well masked with the roasty toasty, followed by a well-balanced hop character that lingers nicely on the palate. Overall this is a top notch porter from a beautiful state."
"O- Very drinkable. Will have to get more of this beer."
""
""
"This is medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a decent porter with plenty of character. However, I am not a fan of the strong mineral presence that is unrelenting and quite distracting."
"O - Roasty and chocolate. A slight burnt toast, but still damn good."

"O: An extremely good American porter, dark and roasty like it should be. This is one of the few American porters that can stand up to GLBC Edmund Fitzgerald, and that is high praise."

"tasty, a really good porter with well developed flavors. I will only nit pick that I prefer more coffee flavor but that is a personal thing, this is a damn fine beer"
""
""
"Hope this beer is as highly valuable as the $8 price tag. Pours near black with a broken sheet of light mocha foam. Smells of toasted malts, coffee, some bitter cocoa, some raisin, some leather and soil and a bit of resiny hops. Flavor is dry with coffee, dark toasted malts, some more leather, some dirt, some bitterness, some bits of maduro tobacco. Fairly thin for the style with low carb and a dry finish - not sure this leaves me disappointed, but it's certainly different for the style. Overall a beer that is drinkable, but not something I'd tell others to buy and drink over some of the better options out there (although I haven't seen better options bottled here in Boston)"

"O: I'm not the biggest fan of hoppy porters. The hops lingered a little too long for me and provided some unwanted fruity and leafy notes while not adding any bitter flavors. There is enough chocolate malts with a nice roasting to remind it's still a porter, but it needs a little more balance."
""
"Tastes of some chocolate malt and bread. This may be my favorite Maine Beer Co to date."
"Overall: With a little less carbonation, this would be a top flight robust porter; as it is, it is darn close"

"This is a delicious beer with more chocolate than char typical. When it warms all of the character really becomes more pronounced."

"Bottle, 6 months old. Black pour with brown highlights, massive tan head and super lacing. Aroma is chocolate, burn toast with a subdued grassy background. Taste is roasted grain, chocolate and earthy hops. Silky and puffy mouthfeel which makes it highly drinkable. Great porter, tasty and easily drinkable. I’d be curious to try fresher for a more intense hop presence."

"Overall, this is a flavorful dark brew that is on the austere side. An interesting big beer that is double the flavor, if not quite double the alcohol. The bitterness finally takes its toll for me. From the 500 ml bottle bought at Whole Foods in Washington, DC."

"Poured very dark brown with chestnut hues in the light. The head is a creamy, billowing beige cloud that adorns the top of my Gulden Draak tulip. Long lasting, it leaves ample lacing as it descends with the beer. The aroma is quite nice: multigrain toast, touch of marshmallow, and cocoa with mineral and a hop-forward waft that is a blend of earth, grass, and spring rain. The flavors are abundant and well balanced. Lots of silky smooth chocolate, less coffee, and sweet malt comes first, followed by burnt toast, caramel, and a pleasing mild bitterness that rounds out the finish. The aftertaste reminds me a little bit of Amontillado: a sherry-like, nutty flavor. The texture is extremely smooth and rich bodied, definitely bold enough to hold up to the flavors. Well carbonated and quite drinkable. Hardly any alcohol presence. Overall, a very well made porter that I highly recommend."
"O - Overall a fine tasting beer that I would pay Sam Adams prices for, but that's about it. Not up to the level of MBC's other beers. From reading other reviews this seems extremely inconsistent."
""
"Overall, quite a nice porter. Tasty stuff."
""
""
""
""

"O: Definitely one of the best porters I've had. A fan of the hops melding with the typical porter tastes in a way that works very well. May be better than Edmund Fitzgerald, but comes in under Everett. Very very nice, worth seeking out."

""
""
""
""
"Good stuff."
"O: After many recommendations I was really looking forward to this beer. It started so well but that finish is just too much over the top."
""
""
""
""
"The taste and aroma counter one another because I get a kind of dark cherry or plum flavor up front with the coffee and chocolate played down. Low bitterness that lingers briefly allowing me to savor it for a few seconds more. This is an excellent Porter and one worth seeking out and trying."

"Really nice Porter, one of the better ones I’ve had."
"Overall: Great beer and a treat. I am really glad I was able to try it and I think everything in this beer is very well done and the end product is very enjoyable. Must mention that the lacing on this is just beyond huge and I find myself smiling as I look at the empty glass."
"The mouth feel is medium, and the finish dries out with pleasant smoky tobacco notes . Overall, It's very easy to drink and has just enough complexity to stay interesting."
""
"Looks good on the pour. Flavor profile is pretty smooth with a nice malty sweetness. Smooth is the keyword here. A nice pleasant drinker with light roasted and hearty tones as accents. Pretty smooth on the feel. Carbonation is a but higher than I think it should be for the beer as a whole. But overall, another nice beer from MBC."
""
"Overall, I would have to say that this beer nails it for the style. It's perhaps a little too dry for my taste with a bit too much on the hop side. All in all, it's roasty, smooth, creamy and bitter which is pretty much what an american porter tends to be. This beer is getting at the very least 4 out of 5."
"The beer smells of dark roasted malt, brown sugar, and faintly fruity. The taste is more robust than the scent with a very heavy mouthfeel. It begins sweet with a taste of raisin and finishes with a bittersweet pleasingly burnt caramel. The finish lingers nicely begging for the next sip. A very robust and straightforward take on the porter style, but extremely well done in doing so. I wouldn't call it unique, but it is an wonderful example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not a huge fan of Porter's that kick you in the mouth with citrus zest and pine. It's a shame because I can really smell some nice cocoa and coffee underneath. It's certainly not bad by any means, but just doesn't suite my liking of an American Porter. It's too bad every style has to be pushed over-the-top by hops. JMHO."
"16.9oz bottle with 112512 on the side. Pours a black color with over an inch of thick, frothy tan head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is dark chocolate, roasted malts, Hershey's syrup and some citrus hops. The taste is bitter dark chocolate with some hints of orange peel. Notes of light and sweet coffee. Bittersweet chocolate syrup at the finish. Thick, heavy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a hearty porter that packs alot of flavor. I'll be buying this again."
""
"O: Very impressed. On the fence about bumping up the taste score to a 4.75. . . it's that good."
""
""
""
""
"Lighter side of medium with mild but ample carbonation to contribute to a fairly creamy mouth feel. Pretty easy to drink despite being a higher abv porter."
""
""
"Deep brown/black, couple fingers of brown head. Dense retention and great lacing. Nose of dark roasty malts, a good dose of coffee and a great balancing sweetness. Taste has more roast character, creamy chocolate notes, and a nice bit of coffee. Roast and sweet malts in the finish. Medium-full body, brilliant texture. A real winner, fantastic porter."
"D - An absolutely exceptional American Porter... I would unequivocally by this one a regular basis if I had the opportunity (which I unfortunately do not)... World class in terms of appearance, flavor, and mouthfeel... The aroma lags slightly and can only be considered slightly above average... However, the net result is a world class American Porter that I will long for in by beer fridge again... Probably my favorite Maine Beer Company offering... If it isn't clear by this point, I like this beer very much... Outstanding..."

"Bottom Line: Good porter!"

"Roasted coffee and chocolate pop in the mouth upfront in a strong, rich, bitter bite. Full buttery, chewy malt middle with some sweet caramel notes backed by dark fruit - fig. The strong flavors. Very creamy mouthfeel. Slightly dry oak finish. A very nice porter - lots of big flavor without being too sweet or strong."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with a cocoa powder flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid roasty aromas and flavors."

"On the fuller end of medium bodied and thankfully more flavorful and complex than the nose suggests. There is still a very dry roast flavor that dominates things but it isn't harsh or completely overbearing. Slightly smokey with some charcoal, burnt malt, oatmeal and espresso bean but this is countered mid-palate by a subtle lactic cream presence as well as some dessert like chocolate sweetness. Hints of sweet and dark chocolate as well as some toffee, caramel and hazelnut. There's also a slight gourmet coffee character without tasting like an overwhelming coffee beer. Really well balanced yet retains enough roast to make it bold and the ABV is very well masked. A complex, intense take on the style that remains an enjoyable drink."
"Pours a five+ finger brown head that fades very slowly leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Bakers chocolate nose and flavor is baked chocolate and coffee. Decent porter. $7.75 for a 500ml bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH"
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, opaque, brown-to-black coloring with a thin, frothy, filmy, light brown colored head that starts around an inch and recedes into a clingy, filmy surface coating. Aromas of dark roasted coffee and bittersweet baker's chocolate blend well on the nose. Flavors are rich and robust, with a blast of baker's chocolate across the middle of the tongue. The richness is all cocoa, and the coffee characteristics provide enough bitter and dryness to cut the cloying. Very strong/big, and very well balanced. The body is robust, but the dryness keeps it palatable, refraining from overpowering. Chocolatey aftertaste, like letting a chocolate truffle melt in your mouth. Slight filmy, lingering finish, but unbelievably pleasant. This is a rich, heavy hitter, and worth looking around for."
"Overall, a solid winter porter. The taste doesn't match the aroma- there is bitter cocoa, and the some alcoholic in the finish, which does not morph into a mellow beer. I was looking for a smoother, pronounced chocolate finish, but the cocoa overwhelms the taste."
"O - One of the best porters I've had. Maine Beer Company is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries and they nailed this one. Great balance of roast, chocolate and hops."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled on1/18/13. Pours a almost pitch black, with a beautiful light brown head, that leaves thick lace on the sides of the glass. Smell is roasty, bready, chocolate, coffee, and some carmel excellent! Taste is all of those things, more roasted expresso than the nose led on. Body medium large silky smooth, nice carbonation, a touch dry like you would expect, and easy drinking. This is a awesome Porter, wow I am impressed with this company."
""
"I found this to be underwhelming. The nose and flavors were muted and there was that metallic note that hung a little prominent for my liking."

"A solid porter with a bit of welcomed extra hops. One of the better porters I've had, with a more fuller body than most. Well made."
"O: I really liked this beer from Maine Beer. Mean Old Tom was a bit of a let-down, but this one reinforces the excellence that is MBC. Their prices are pretty stiff though so look out and buy one before going any further -- they are widening their net and will be back in your town before you know it. King Titus is the real deal for dark beer and porter fans - this beer represents the robust porter about as well as any I have had."

"Bottle from Capone's Restaurant. Pours thickish black, with malty roasty aroma. Above average and smooth mouthfeel. The taste is great,chocolate and citrus hops, very drinkable malty just right not too roasty. Hits the bullseye, wishing it was available regularly and locally."

"O: Really like the roastiness of both the malts and the coffee, flavors and smells, in this beer. It is pretty easy to drink with very well hidden ABV and is perfect for sipping on a cool winter evening, while watching football but would also go greatly in front of the fireplace on a snowy evening. This is well worth picking up, one of the nice new porters that I have found this winter."

"O: Appreciation grew with each taste, which Is a good sign for me because I almost always enjoy my first tastes."
"[O] I think that the level of dark roast and thick mouthfeel would safely place this beer into stout territory...but what does it even matter?

"Another wonderful beer. Nothing really stood out as I was drinking it, but it went down incredibly smooth and I was disappointed when the glass was empty so I guess that's an endorsement on its own. Great choice when you want something more full, but don't want to deal with sweetness."

"O: Opened this bottle with some cheese and charcuterie and I regretted it. The pairing was horrible so I saved it for after. In doing so, I was able to appreciate this beer for the wonderful beer it is - a full on chocolate bomb porter."

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice solid porter worth drinking for a long time."
"Pours a solid dark brown/black with a huge fluffy khaki colored head that persists forever. Smells of roast and chocolate with hints of caramel and earthy spicy hops and a bit of mineral and ash to round it all out. The flavor is rich with lots of bitter dark chocolate and hints of roast and caramel. There's enough earthy hops to provide some balance and some nice flavors with little harsh bitterness. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a creamy roasty chalky mouthfeel. This is a very nice porter, I really enjoyed it! If only it were easier to find and at a lower price point these would fill my fridge!"
"O - Overall I would call this an average porter with low complexity of flavor and aroma. Too burnt for my liking and lacking in the deep roasty flavors I was looking for. A bit of a disappointment to me from a brewery that has otherwise produced very satisfying brews."
""
"So much better than Mean Old Tom, it kind of reminds me of a more thick Zoe. Not a complete branch out from previous beers (since they do hop the heck out of things), it is a very solid beer to their lineup."
"Will have again and will recommend to anyone interested in an American porter."
"Taste is dark sweetness upfront, some fruitiness in the middle, and cocoa and coffee bitterness to the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. Good brew from Maine Brewing. Duh."

"O: Very flavorful for an American Porter. Highly enjoyable, and one of the better porters that I have had recently. While some imperial porters are boozy, this seems to be just about right. Very pricey at 7.99 a bottle, but overall I think it is worth it. A nice treat"
"O: Very impressed by this beer. Though not cheap, I am willing to try most anything I see from MBC. I would still likely go with a few other cheaper porters over this one, but would not hesitate to revisit it when in the mood to treat myself to something nice."
"Overall: I think the hop level could have been just a bit less, but I still enjoyed this one quite a bit. The roast was strong but smooth. I'd have more in the future."
"My first Maine Beer Co. beer.Pours like a stout, nearly black with a one finger deep beige head that leaves a full ring of lace behind as it settles.Chocolate and nuts at first whiff,some roast and and a little drunken fruit,well rounded.Creamy and full feel with light carbonation.flavors of what a porter should be,roasty with some nuttiness,a little raw and earthy,and just enough caramel and brown sugar-like sweetness to round out everything nicely.I had high hops for this beer and it delivered and then some,kick ass."

"O: This is a really solid porter its balence with the roasted flavor without being a malt bomb (which I hate) is impressive I wish there was more coffee flavors or robustness if you will but one of the better standard porters I have had would definitely try again."

"King Titus has a dark approach, extremely brown bordering on black really with a firm tan colored inch of foam up top leaving notches on the way down. A nice looking thickness, with some gunk on the bottom of the bottle, this one is bottle conditioned. Smell is very clean, no bells or whistles, str8 up american porter. With the alcohol content I thought I would be getting into baltic territory, but this leans american with robust scent, and a backing aroma hop going in the nose. Faint cocco and roasted malt. Taste wise for the alcohol involved this comes off like a 5% regular porter with a mix of roasted malt and a generous hopping. The body is damn near perfect, smooth, silky, warming, not distracting. Carbonation is light, as this goes down like a liquid light milkshake. I drank this pretty quickly, it was smooth, i liked it."

"A solid porter that pushes the envelope toward American stout. Massively roasted and solid all around. Another MBC win."
"Decanted into a Firestone Walker Proprietor's Series snifter, nice thick pour, dark brown-black color with a firm half inch of creamy tan head that receded to a thick ringlet and coated the glass with lacing. Simple aroma, dark malts, fairly roasty, touches of chocolate and coffee. Porter-ish. Similar taste, dark roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate and light coffee, mild earthy hops. Seemed like a tiny oxidized off-flavor in there, but well within tolerance. Just about full-bodied, nice and smooth, not a particularly distinctive porter, but still very nice overall."
"An even mix of sweet dark fruits and dark roasts. Starts sweet and finishes bitter. A rather complex American Porter."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Another Maine gem. Not in the same realm as Lunch, Zoe, Peeper and MO. But I do see it fitting in the same stratosphere as Collaboration Time 1 and Mean Old Tom. I would say it falls somewhere in between the last two. A bitter, individual Porter. Definitely down my alley."
"King Titus started very strong but finished a bit weak in the flavor department. Although this beer is listed as an American porter, it reminded me more of an Irish dry stout (and it would be a fantastic one at that). Perhaps the elevated alcohol presence bumped it out of the aforementioned category."
""
"This particular bottle of beer is nicely 1-2 weeks fresh and I have high hopes going into it. The beer pours a lovely brown black with a thick coffee-ice-cream-colored head on top with big rocky bubbles that slowly shore up into a finely compacted unit, leaving behind thick sticky rings and slabs of lacing. This beer smells roasty with a smooth, creamy smell that reminds me of a milk stout’s lactic sugars. There is also a nice strong nutty smell in there reminiscent of a hazelnuts and pecans, and as it warms up slight alcohol spice can be smelt. The beer tastes like a pleasant blend of a nutty brown ale and a roasty stout, which is just fine by me. It begins with creamy notes that still remind me of the lactic sugars in a milk stout, before opening up into medium roasted malt notes, which are quite quickly melded with big nutty flavors with a slight grapefruit and pine sitting in the back of the flavor and resonating more in the aftertaste alongside the pleasant roasty coffee lingering. The aftertaste also occasionally steps into nougat bar flavoring for me, especially right after the beer has left the mouth, which is really quite pleasant and tasty. This beer feels smooth, velvety, and creamy on the tongue, with little to no hint of carbonation. It sits a little thin in the mouth, but this makes it all the easier to drink, and it more than makes up for being thin with flavor and pleasant texture. The beer leaves the mouth slightly sticky-dry with some saliva on the fringes, and thin ichor of stickiness coating the mouth. Overall, this is a superb porter, and another great offering from the Maine Beer Company. Is this my favorite from them, though? Probably not, as that place is still reserved for Zoe, but it holds its own beside Mean Old Tom and even Lunch. This beer is more than worthy of a try."
"This is a solid porter. It's gloriously roasty, balanced, and clean. It's not mind blowing, but it is great. A bit expensive, but I guess it's for the gorillas or something. Good for them."

"O - Overall this isnt bad, but not stellar. Much better offerings from Maine Beer."

"O: Excellent offering from MBC, and everything I've had from them has been awesome so this is no surprise. Definitely recommended along with everything else they make. Great work."

"O: A pretty standard porter, heavy-ish on the smoke and char for sure. Chocolate is a distant touch and no noticeable coffee aspect either. I expected this one to be really hoppy coming from MBC but it's surprisingly not. I would almost categorize this as an english porter with the level of smoke involved here."
"O: What can I say? While MBC sure knows how to make the lighter side of ales, they also know how to make the dark ones. Mean Old Tom is damn good, too. This beer is phenomenal. If you see this, you must try it out."
""
"Overall: A nice change from the everyday porter as the hoppy flavor brings an interesting variant. One to seek out for those who love hop forward porters."
""
"This is a strong porter, in both intensity of flavor and alcohol. I think one at a sitting is plenty, and I'm positive that if this were available on tap for me, I'd have difficulty returning for a second. This is rich and flavorful but fairly intense. Like all of MBC's beers, this is a good one. However, it will be one that conflicts individual tastes and perceptions of what a style should be. Very worthy of trying, and very tasty. Go into this one with an open mind and you will be rewarded."
"A pretty good brew, but a lot of booze flavor. Would've liked to age it longer I guess. Dissipointing finish that is oddly watery however. The nose on this beer is outstanding."
"A porter lover may appreciate this and even though it is a solid offering, it's not one I would drink more than once due to the carbonation."
""
"The body is medium with soft carbonation. Overall this one is swell. Real enjoyable beer for them to add to their portfolio."
""
"O: This porter will put hair on your chest. It's rough around the edges, and not for the faint of palate. The dominant acrid malt tastes and lack of carbonation do hinder drinkability a bit, but not to the point that it makes the experience unenjoyable. A minor tweak here and there and I can really see this beer coming into its own."
""

"O: A very good porter, and I'll be interested to see how one holds up after about six months."

""

"I highly anticipate any new offering from MBC, so I was excited to hear about King Titus - an ale for an ape. Just from the pour you can tell this is going to be a big porter - deep and near black, hearty looking with a thick beige head. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy up front, juicy, but giving way to a nice woodsy char and roasty chocolate notes. Flavor follows suit - this is really hoppy for a porter, almost borderline black IPA you could say, piney fruity and resinous, but eventually folding to that deep maltyness. The word ""robust"" is often associated with porters and I think it fits well here - chocolate, nutty, bitter finish yet supple, and a nice rich leathery smoothness. Really a nice beer - kind of an oddball for the style, which is kind of an in-betweener itself, but I think that's part of the charm of this unique beer. Another great effort from the guys at Maine Beer Company - cheers!"
"O: This porter is exceptional. Probably this and Founders Porter are the best I have had. I would 100% recommend for those who like dark beers. Another amazing beer from Main Beer Company."

"Overall- I could definitely drink a few of these in a session. It's a little sweet, but not enough to be a detriment. Definitely the best non-hoppy beer I've had from MBC yet."

"O: this is a damn good porter, that is packed with flavor and drinkability, beautiful use of hops to compliment the malts, really enjoyed this and would recommend it to any porter fan."
"O: All in all, this is a good beer, not great. I tell you, it seems MBC does hoppy beer amazingly well, but malty beer, so far, does not seem to be their specialty. Do not get me wrong, this is a good porter, just not a great porter. Much better than their stout offering, Mean Old Tom. If you have a thing for Porter, than definitely try this one. If you've never tried anything from MBC before, do not go for this first! Go for Lunch, Peeper, or Zoe."
"O: MBC does it again. This time with a dark beer. Their mean old tom doesn't hold a candle to this beer (even though that is an Irish dry stout, but still). Layers of flavor and a near-full body make this a great example of the style and one that isn't topped by many pure, standard porters. The price point is right around the MBC average, which is a bit high compared to some others, but the quality is right there too. What a beer!"

"I am enjoying this beer. MBC has another winner on their hands."
