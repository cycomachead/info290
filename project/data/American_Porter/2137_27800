It is everything you love about a porter with the sweetness and creamy flavor of pure vanilla.  I wasn't sure whether I was drinking a beer or having a vanilla float... Which I may try with this beer!  I bet if you added some vanilla ice cream to this beer it would be damn good!  Anyway unless your tongue is dead, you get really strong vanilla flavor and a smooth creamy mouthfeel.  I thought it to be too sweet at first taste, more like a supper or after dinner beer, but three down, and they were still tasting great.  I suggest trying this brew.","JPowell712","Feb 28, 2015"

Scents of coffee with cream, bittersweet milk chocolate, moderate levels of roast malt, medium-high notes of vanilla and light caramel and bready malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderful porter base with a very pleasant addition of vanilla. True to style, pleasant and enticing, very well done. Flavor begins lightly sweet with notes of sweetened coffee with cream, milk chocolate, vanilla, light caramel and a light roast malt and black coffee bitterness keeping it balanced. Middle is lightly sweet still with notes of vanilla, coffee with cream, light caramel and bready malt. Finish is medium-dry with notes of dark coffee with cream, vanilla, roast malt, dark chocolate and a very light touch of caramel very far in the background. Aftertaste is roast malt, black coffee and vanilla. Overall impression of flavor is of a very good porter base enhanced by the addition of vanilla. Roasty, rich and full of flavor. Very nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation and a smooth feel with a light prickle. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very good porter, true to form and pleasing to drink. Overall this is an excellent porter. The vanilla aids the aroma and flavor of a solid base beer and makes this one a good one. Very highly recommended.","Auraan","Dec 08, 2014"

Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toasted bread, light coffee, cream, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and vanilla notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toasted bread, light coffee, cream, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, vanilla, toasted bread, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice balance and robustness of dark/bready malts and vanilla flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a very good vanilla porter. All around good robustness and balance of dark/bready malt and vanilla flavors; and very smooth to drink.

Deep Brown in color this porter ale offers slight notes of chocolate and roasted nut all that you would expect from a porter. I personally love anything vanilla, I would choose plain vanilla ice cream over any ice cream flavor. That being said I wasn't able to pick up a ton of vanilla until about a minute after taking my first sip, which was a little disappointing. I would like to see more forward notes of vanilla, but that might just be the vanilla lover in me. Over all it's a good beer, just left me wanting more vanilla notes.","Eric_Edwardson","Nov 27, 2014"

The vanilla dominates the palate but it never comes close to approaching cloying...  Medium bodied...  Goes down smoothly...

4.25,16.8,,,,,,"Purchased in bottle. Pours a 1/4"" light tan head. Dark amber brown body, extremely smooth. Despite being a porter tastes light, but still hoppy. On first sip, I didn't taste anything reminiscent of vanilla, then it got stronger about 1/5 down the glass which stays consistent from there. Definitely tastes of vanilla bean- pure, somewhat sweet, with a sense of woody spice. Great beer for pairing with desserts.","Vivelepositif","Aug 16, 2014"

The taste is about the same but is on the weak side. Not bad tasting at all but needs more flavor. Perfect carbonation for the style and goes down easy. Just wish there was more of a stronger flavor.","BeerWithMike","May 28, 2014"

It's quite smooth and has a hint of vanilla, nothing overpowering. I'm used to heartier beers, but this was pleasant to drink. It has a nice flavor. I would buy again if I needed something light and smooth to drink with a bit if flavor.  I finished it quickly without noticing and wishing I had another as it went by so fast. It's not at the top of my list, but I did enjoy it enough to buy again.","arichter96","Mar 17, 2014"

It has al its eggs in the vanilla basket and that should not be a problem. If you picked up this beer, you do want vanilla, and it delivers it in spades. I would had preferred a deeper roast, a darker color, and a more porter-stout flavor, but for what I got I found it to be very nice. 3.75","jucifer1818","Feb 07, 2014"

Whether it is food or beer, I am more inclined to say, ""eh it wasn't that bad i guess"" even if it should be more critically rated. I preface with that, because that is really saying something when I rate this beer so poorly. I poured rather aggressively and I was absolutely shocked that it produced NO head. Not very little, not less than I'd prefer...NO HEAD. After a few seconds all that was left was a rootbeer-ish foam rim around the glass and that haze that sits in the middle of the glass. To put it in perspective, I literally had to look at the bottle and box to make sure I had not accidentally bought a fancy soda. The mouthfeel is very thin and extremely undercarbonated. The flavor hammers with vanilla and reminds me of a very tasty soda, but not a tasty beer.","Jakeszetela","Jan 31, 2014"

It is an easy drinking beer and goes down really well. Definitely a session beer, I could easily drink a few of these in one session. I could not get a lot of flavors out of the smell but could definitely smell a hint of vanilla. It's an average beer but I would drink it again for sure. I liked it more because It is a colder November night and it definitely feels like a fall/winter kind of beer.","smptenor","Nov 07, 2013"

There is not much to the aroma, sort of an earthy horse blanket. Thankfully the flavor is not too overpowering vanilla sweet, in fact it's a rustic porter flavor with just a hint of vanilla as well as currant and brandy, despite the 4.7 abv. The mouthfeel is pretty standard for a dark ale, lingering but not too thick/cloying. Overall it's a decent porter but def not in the top tier of the style.","Iceman77","Jun 14, 2013"

There is only a minor bitterness in the aftertaste which makes it easy and smooth going down. It definitely smells of toasted malts, chocolate and vanilla. A very pleasant smell indeed! This porter makes a real nice adult float with vanilla bean ice cream. One of the best porters and adult floats that I have ever experienced. Will make this my signature go-to adult float beer.","shanny1981","May 14, 2013"

Mild vanilla-caramel nose and a sweetish malt taste with undertones of caramel, vanilla and bitter chocolate. The mouthfeel is very smooth. It has a gentle finish and hints of coffee in the nose on the swallow. Overall a nice, balanced brew","RunningFox","Mar 05, 2013"

The beer has a lot of roasted character, there is also a good deal of coffee in this beer. The vanilla however, is its strongest taste attribute. It is a very vanilla forward brew. There is a little chocolate character to this beer as well. The mouthfeel is lacking, it is a very sessionable beer but I would like to have seen something a bit thicker.

4.02,10.4,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Poured almost black into a frosty pint glass, the pour yielded a thin tan head of about a finger or so that disappeared quickly with just a bit of lacing. The vanilla notes are interesting...they come on late and aren't overpowering, but seem to be very well balanced with the rest of the brew. This is a decent porter...very easy to drink with just the right amount of creamy vanilla flavor. Just a little too much carbonation, but otherwise not too much to complain about. The price for 6 was over 10 bucks here in Maryland. Seemed a little steep for this brew, but again this is a pretty decent brew so I'm not gonna complain much. Cheers!","HarryPotHead","Nov 25, 2012"

The flavoring was almost as good, but the malts were a little rough around the edges at times, making for an ultimately incomplete, less refined taste.

A good attempt, but I feel like the base beer wasn't up to par to accept the beans. It comes off as more of a vanilla """brown ale""" than a vanilla porter. I'll enjoy this bottle, but probably won't spring for more any time soon.""","eclipse54","Aug 03, 2012"

The head dissipates quickly, leaving only a cap of head atop the beer. I definitely detect the vanilla in the aroma, though this is not strong. I detect chocolate and some coffee and roasted malt aromas. The taste of chocolate and vanilla are very forward here. There is a nice malty backbone that is roasty and mildly sweet. The body is light to medium with some carbonation. The beer is smooth and is highly drinkable. This is a very good porter.","acevenom","Jul 14, 2012"

3.44,-5.5,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a nice and dark amber caramel, almost black at its middle with a cream browned head that starts tall and wheedles down to a half a fingers length, which retains for quite some time. The smell is actually quite weak… I really had to dig to find it. In the end I detected a sweet with caramel malts. The slightest tinge of vanilla can be found, but nothing near what I was hoping for. There is also a slight tingle in the back which seems bready with a slight ouch of fruit. The taste is also underwhelming with vanilla, if it is there, it is in the faint lingering sweetness of the beer. This is definitely a solid porter, though, with a good chocolatey malt taste and slight breadiness in the back of the mouth. The more you sip it the more you think you taste the vanilla on the edges of the tongue, and it definitely builds into an actual vanilla taste by the end of the beer, but it still is not the leading flavor in the beer. The beer is very clean on the mouth, leaving little to no tingle or taste, but the initial sip has a little harsh kick of carbonation but then washes away entirely. The tongue is left with sap-like strings of vanilla streaking over it after the beer has washed down. This is a terrific porter with great subtle tastes, just not the kick of vanilla I was hoping for from something called a “vanilla porter.” Maybe I am just unfamiliar with the vanilla porter style but I feel like you should be able to get more of a vanilla flavor than this beer delivers. I’d call it a vanilla-kissed/touched porter rather than a straight up vanilla porter. This is a great beer but is just labeled incorrectly.","Maxwell","Jul 05, 2012"

3.14,-13.7,3.5,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D/O: This porter is accessible, assembled to appeal as almost any beer with 'vanilla' in the name must be. It retains some interesting features; the best of which is the employment of the advertised vanilla. Instead of attacking the palate, it is well-integrated throughout the flavor profile. It demonstrates the ability to blend into the background and still contribute in a positive and synergistic way. Only the smell falls flat, being borderline unappealing but mostly just poorly-defined.","beagle75","Apr 05, 2012"
3.88,6.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"dark brown pour into a pint glass with lots of fluffy tan head. decent amount of lacing. chocolate and vanilla aromas rise instantly, roasted grains, and a bit of a yeast smell. amazing tasted of roasted vanilla beans... almost like a creme brulee! roasted grains and coffee flavors are a staple for this one. smooth and creamy medium bodied ale with light carbonation. a GREAT sweet, yet refreshing porter.","facundoCNB","Apr 04, 2012"

Aromas are rich in vanilla extract and brown sugary scents. Very smooth and enticing. The beer's flavors are very rich, as well, with a sugary/candied sweetness overlaying the rich, smooth vanilla and buttery backbone. Only the slightest hint of mocha coffee, but it was just enough to bring some balance to everything. Despite all the overly sweet characteristics, the beer remains crisp and clean on a light body. Not cloying, the aftertaste is rich and darkly sweet, with the vanilla making a slight cookie-batter flavor. Slick, quick finish, making this beer insanely easy to drink.

It does leave a very small coffee bitterness in the linger, but the sourness lingers heavier. Not my favorite, it definitely smells better than it tastes.

While I enjoyed it, there was a time or two while I was drinking where I thought I'd like it more if it was toned down a bit.

Head retention and lacing are both present, but neither really impress. The nose is initially downright unimpressive, a weak vanilla presence and some nutty notes that, while not bad, have no place being the centerpiece for a porter over coffee, chocolate, or even caramel. As the beer gets close to room temperature though, a milk chocolate aroma does join the proceedings and redeem the beer a little bit. Unfortunately, even warming can't save the flavor this one. The vanilla that is present tastes like it was added via cut rate flavoring rather than beans, and it's supported only by the taste of toasted nuts, something that should, best case scenario, appear sparingly is a secondary note in a porter. The body is solidly full for being an under 5% brew. The carbonation is right near where it needs to be, but to me comes across as just a touch low at times.

The smell of the beer was lacking something to me... The vanilla. Maybe it's in the taste... Nope, not there either. Where is the vanilla in this? I was so bummed that I wasn't able to get any of that flavor that I probably can't give that much of a legit review. The smell did have a roasted aroma to it though, and the taste had a burnt bitterness to it. The mouthfeel wasn't too thick or anything.

Head was a light brown, less than 1 finger, that only lasted a few minutes. Very thin layer remained that clung a bit. From a distance the aroma was a bit bitter with a bit of alcohol. From up close the vanilla was very prevalent, and was slightly sweet. Taste was a bit of roasted grain, with a small bit of lactose sweetness. Finished up a bit sweeter, with a tad of vanilla.

Head is a quarter inch, cream-colored and frothy and quickly disperses into a sudsy film and a bubbly band around the edges. A continuous band of lacing encircled the bowl. Nose expresses malt, vanilla notes and artificial sweetener. Taste follows nose with the addition of some cocoa notes which are somewhat masked by the artificial sweetener quality evident in the nose. There is also a creamy flavor intermingled with the vanilla. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation (perhaps a little too assertive) and a slightly creamy texture.

I miss ice cream not out of intolerance but simply that I never seem to be able to catch Mister Softee as he tools through my neighborhood in the summer. I am going to practice running before the season begins so that I might actually catch him this year. Color was a deep brown with cola highlights. Mouthfeel was medium and it was in the mouth that I really caught the vanilla. Holy Milli Vanilli, Batman! I remember in HomeEc when we were told to use the extract flavorings VERY judiciously and this was what a batch of my kitchen's vanilla cookies tasted like. Back then, vanilla extract was purported to be alcoholic and so we were swigging it as well as shaking it into the dough. BIG vanilla flavors, both in the cookies and this beer. One of the things that I really dig about the porter style is its ability to take on adjunct flavors. This was like a vanilla milkshake more than a Porter. Dang, but it was really pleasant. Finish was mild, smooth, fairly sweet, but it was vanilla, not sugary sweet, which is what does me in every time.

The beer poured a dark brown with a reasonable head. Initial aroma was of slight vanilla. After the first taste I was reeled in by the accessibility of this beer. I had expected a wallop of over the top vanilla taste, but what I got was so much more. The roasted flavor of the darkened malt came first followed by an ever so subtle wave of vanilla. I find that brewers sometimes miss the mark with flavored beers because they either don't include enough of the signature flavor, or they overpower you with it. This beer found a nice balance for both. My only regret is that they weren't able to capture a slightly higher abv. I think that would have added an additional characteristic to a very good beer.","Bslied","Jan 31, 2011"

The taste is a nice well balanced taste of chocolate, followed by some coffee, caramel and than get some hops and finally some vanilla at the end. This porter is well balanced and not too much bitterness, seems to be more on the sweet side. The mouthfeel is a light bodied creamy feel, but do feel it could have a better mouthfeel by being more creamy and have a fuller body, and it is easily drinkable for what it is.

It is noticeable but subtle at first, but the potency of the vanilla builds, especially as the beer warms. There are also notes of milk chocolate, toffee, and mildly roasted malts. The roasted malts can't combat the dominance of the vanilla, though, so the sweetness of this one makes it drink more like a brown than a porter. It's not very full-bodied, which would generally make me say that this one goes down pretty easy, but the compounding sweetness of the vanilla eventually gets to be too much for me, and I wouldn't want to have too much in a session.

A subtle vanilla flavor that isn't really all that pleasant and some mild roasted malt. Also, it kind of sticks to the mouth and given it's less than stellar flavor, it's not a welcome stickiness. All things considered a very disappointing brew, I expected more from these guys and this beer in particular but found it very lackluster. Very unmemorable and lacking any kind of direction.

This means that if I had to choose between this porter and another, I'd probably pick the other one. Not because I didn't like it, but because I want just the coffee and chocolates in the porter, not the vanilla so much.

Bitterness lacking and no hop presence or astringency whatsoever. Mouthfeel was a bit silky yet syrupy. As I sipped on, this beer reminded me very much of a flat cola - featureless and uninspired. Finish was equally one dimensional and I couldn't be sure if it conjured up dark chocolate or vanilla extract. If one argues that the chocolate predominates, it certainly wasn't akin to a bakers chocolate as it lacked the bitter edge. Body quite thin for the style. Unfortunately, this beer did not live up to its promising label (which includes the advisement that it was brewed with ""real vanilla beans' - as opposed to ""imaginary vanilla beans"" I suppose?).

Fits the style of an American Porter, though an extreme vanilla enriched fringe member. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with an average carbonation level.

The bubbles that are left around the side of the glass feel very thin, kind of like bubbles you blow in milk with your straw as a kid. Makes me wish the head was a little more substantial.

Only the slightest hint of vanilla and maybe a whiff of coffeee bean (moreso than vanilla bean). It tastes bland. This thing has no balls whatsoever. I even let it warm up and still nothing.

Drinkability is fair given the style, it's not bad but yet not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is typical of a porter but with extra flavoring.

And it lingers nicely in the finish, without becoming too ""artificial"". The beer is well made and has a good appearance and head retention. As for drinkability, I still think that the vanilla has to hinder it on a volume scale (ie. it's kind of a one and done beer), and I don't think that it adds enough character and flavor to REALLY make you want to have one (ie. along the lines of a Sam Adam's Triple Bock). However, it's still pleasant enough throughout a single glass, and I'd enjoy having one during a night out with the lads or with dinner.

A light coffee/chocolate flavor is present, but most of it is swept up by the vanilla. Medium bodied mouthfeel, and smooth finish. Good abv. and decent flavor can make this a sessionable ale, if you like your beer sweet. Overall, I thought that the porter qualities and the vanilla just were not a good combination. It makes for an interesting flavor combination, but not enough of the porter flavor was apparent. Maybe if a little less vanilla was used? Dont get me wrong, some beer styles benefit from vanilla being added (I love the Vanilla Creme Ale from Blackhorse), but IMO it doesnt work as well here. Just my two cents.

The flavor of the beer is slightly sweet, the vanilla is a nice accompaniment, but not overwhelming and there appears to be a bit of alcohol warmth at the swallow, which is surprising since the ABV is listed at 4.7%...maybe the roasted grains coming in? There is also a little bit of roasted flavor shining through. The hop bitterness is moderate-low, it provides a nice balance, with little or no hop flavor. The mouthfeel is rather full-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a nice smoothness to the swallow. Overall this is an enjoyable beer. I think taste is very good, the sweetness is enough, but not overwhelming, and the same can be said of the vanilla.

The vanilla, which would do wonders to balance the dark, sharp porter flavor, is not pronounced enough to do the job. A good flavor, and a decent porter, although perhaps in not succeeding as a flavored porter it is left not trying enough to be a good porter. Mouthfeel is thin and a bit...gritty?

Smells wonderful initially, but follows up with a sweet-stout character without the stout. A fellow BA described this as soured milk...I can't disagree. The Porter part of the beer falls quite weak and a bit grainy. This allows for the lactose creaminess to become too pronounced and sweet. I would like more chocolate and coffee flavors to come from the malt. This would increase the body and keep the lactose from feeling slick and overly milky-sweet.

2.26,-37.9,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Overall impression: This might be good for someone who isn't a fan of beer, but to me it was just overly sweet, with nothing to balance it out. I won't be getting this one again.","rowew","Apr 18, 2006"
3.53,-3,4,3.5,4,2.5,3,"The aftertaste has an edge I'm not keen about. An off after-taste of vanilla? Light bodies and modestly carbonated. Overall, the vanilla is moderate and in line with the other flavors. Everything mixes quite well and goes down comfortable until the aftertaste.","mentor","Apr 14, 2006"
3.28,-9.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Bottom line: An interesting variation on the Porter style that I find ""not bad"" but...it isn't something I'd buy very often. It's just worth a try.","Bitterbill","Apr 11, 2006"
3.18,-12.6,4,3.5,3,4,2.5,"Vanilla is one of those things, where a little goes a long way. It seems like they could've used a litte less, brought the roasted malt flavor more to the foreground and this would have been a winner. As it stands now, the vanilla is way too sweet and dominating. I don't think I could tolerate more than one of these in a sitting.","Winter","Apr 06, 2006"
3.56,-2.2,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Medium bodied at best, low carbonation....pretty smooth. Probably a beer I could have one or two of in a sitting. Any more than that might be bit too much sweetness for one session.","briman","Mar 21, 2006"
2.28,-37.4,3.5,3,2,2.5,1.5,"DK: This is a tough one. 12 ozs will be a feat in and of itself.","Bighuge","Mar 20, 2006"
4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Feel is milky smooth and soft on the palate as it quenches favorably well in a medium statured body. Clean, fresh, and well rounded feel and flavors throughout its stay with just the right amount of bearable sweetness and vanilla. Although this did seem a bit overbearing at first few sips but it tended to mellow off some and was no longer bothersome as it grews on me. The little chocolate push in the finish really helped. Although, as well to mention here, this might not be for everone who thinks of a porter and try this stuff. My take is that its a solid, drinkable little porter thats worth trying out.","tavernjef","Mar 16, 2006"
3.73,2.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"pours out of the bottle a dark brown with ruby and crimson highlights. ample tannish head reduces down to a thin coating which ends up leaving sparse lace. lots of choco and vanilla notes in the nose...really smells like a beer one should have on valentines day with your chocolate treats. really tasty...like a liquid milky way candy bar. the vanilla is proportioned right to meld nicely with the chocolate covered nougat maltiness. this is nicely balanced, well crafted beer. the mouthfeel is velvety smooth on top of a seemingly light body. finishes lightly creamy smooth with vanilla hints. really sessionable and not too sticky sweet or cloying. i like it and it's worth seeking out for the style.","budgood1","Mar 15, 2006"
3.43,-5.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"this beer has a little to much vanilla flavor for me.","plaztikjezuz","Mar 10, 2006"
3.22,-11.5,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Dark brown color and clearish, lets highlights through at the bottom. Skim of a flat head, just dots for lace. Aroma is straightforward, a dash of vanilla but not too exaggerated, especially at first. Mouthfeel seems a bit thinnish to me, not like some others seem to detect, it could use more of a creaminess in my opinion. The flavor is slightly bland, water searching for a flavor, vanilla notes are apparent and not too bad, not as oxidized as some Stoney Creek examples I've had, not as heavy-handed as something like Michelob Celebrate. Finishes a little fuller but with some extra heavy but still hummingbird feeder watery sugariness. Not too bad, if the texture worked out better for me, it would make it more quaffable.","ADR","Mar 08, 2006"
3.62,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,2.5,"Drinkability is the main weakness here. Much like other brews of this variety, I doubt I'd ever have more than one or maybe 2. At the same time, I don't think this was ever intended to be a session brew by iteself. It is what it is and it does a good job.","Domingo","Mar 06, 2006"
3.68,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A worthy flavored porter. Pours out to a pitch black color with a large tan head. Some notes of lacing, and a medium low level of carbonation. Aromas are light, some vanilla bean, mild spice and malt, a touch of granola. Taste was pretty good; flavors of full roasted malts, sweet cream, grains, and some vanilla bean made their way to the palate and matched well. Mouthfeel was medium-full bodied, and had a decent amount of consitancy. Lower ABV and good flavor make this a possible session brew for watching sports. This beer kind of borders on ""Stout-ville", but it's a good porter however you look at it. Give it a shot, this is among the better flavored beers i've had.","Frozensoul327","Feb 28, 2006"

3.92,7.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Da nice change to the standard porter. Mild vanilla makes it very drinkabledoubt I could have more than 3, but this is a nice dessert brew.","hanco005","Feb 12, 2006"
3.5,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkable for 1 or 2 but too sweet past that. Would be great with a brownie. I'd think this would work for me with about 2% more abv. Worth a try when you you sweet tooth is calling","russpowell","Feb 08, 2006"
3.95,8.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a very black color with dark brown highlights. The foam is a nice khaki-tan color. Aroma is toasted malts, molasses, raisins, and cappuccino. The taste is remarkably strong of vanilla, especially in the finish. The aftertaste really reminds me of vanilla bean cappuccino. Quite a unique flavor. Mouthfeel is nice and the drinkability is great as well. I only have one of these so I dont know if the vanilla taste would get annoying after quite a few. I definitly like this one though. Great job.","jasonpeckins32","Feb 07, 2006"
3.89,6.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,3,"This was a good beer but the vanilla wore my palate down after a bottle. I couldn't see drinking too many of these at all. I bet it would be great poured on some real vanilla bean ice cream.","granger10","Feb 04, 2006"

4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"I call this the rootbeers of beers. Every angle of this beer is pretty good. Great pour, thick and heavy with a small cream like head much like a cream soda. It has almost like a dry coal taste from the beginning. This beer is all about the finish though. The heavy cream taste comes through and a heavy vanilla finish. The thing about the vinnila part is its natural mouth feel to it. It has a real vanilla bean taste. Whether it was a extract or some sort of additive used, it still taste how it should","RoBotGod","Jan 30, 2006"
4.05,11.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"OVERALL COMMENTS: Someones got their thinking cap screwed on tight over at Breckenridge Brewing  the beers are improving by leaps and bounds. I might have dry hopped it to add a bit of balance to the vanilla, but why add something and then go to lengths to hide it? This is a showcase for the vanilla bean, and it does wonderfully. Next time Ill see how it is over a scoop of Breyers Vanilla Bean Ice Cream!","fretlessman71","Jan 27, 2006"
4.4,20.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"--update. OK, I've had a six pack. A nice smooth beer. Doesn't linger too long in the back of your mouth. don't drink other beers after this one unless they are big tasting.","Mebuzzard","Jan 12, 2006"
