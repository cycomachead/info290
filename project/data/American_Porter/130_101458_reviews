"This is real tasty. If you wanna get someone into craft beer, this is a good one to start with. My dad loves some miller, but he actually enjoyed a few sips of this one. As an experienced beer drinker, I enjoy it myself too. Great beer for when you're looking for something sweet."
"Not to imply sweetness.. It's not, but it has replaced dessert more than once. I like it!"
""
""
""
""
"Nice massive chocolate notes! Heavy mouth feel. I loved it."
""
"tates like they poured cocoa powder in a mild beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a chocolate milk shake. Gotta love a beer that is true to its name."
""
""
"Great initial chocolate taste with a hint of coffee. Pretty creamy and good"
""
""
"Intensely chocolate in taste and smell. Only lightly bitter. Malty but not sweet. Excellent mouth feel, easy to drink. There's little roasted malt flavor and smell which seems to help the chocolate come through. Honestly, it's not just a one time bit. Often beers like this are something I would try once. However, this is a true Porter – tasty and not a gimmick."
""
"My first 5/5 rating. It only took 189 beers prior to find it. When I think of a milkshake version of a beer, this exemplifies that thought. A chocolate fudge punch to the palate and wonderful aromas to boot. Not high in alcohol so you can certainly session out on this. Light body doesn't fill you up. I took a girl out to World of Beer and she got this and I opted for the Brooklyn Blast!. Granted, I really enjoyed the Blast! but I had some beer envy when I tried hers. I had to seek it out and luckily I remembered seeing it at a local store. I'll probably buy their last two six packs."

"phenomenal stouty porter. Actually tastes like a chocolatey shake."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Explosive chocolate sweet flavor. My girlfriend adores this brew & I end up stealing a couple whenever she gets it."
""
""
"Awesome lacing. Super dark. Great chocolate flavor."
""
"Awesome beer. It tastes just like chocolate shake. It's awesome."
""

"O-  I had hope for this one when I saw the 89 score. To me, it doesn't measure up."
"Amazing. Favorite porter out there."
"Very average.  Good smell average taste good feel."
""
""
"Thick, dark tan head. One dimensional aroma of cocoa, but a big, thick chocolate milk flavor and body. Lives up to the name. I'm not normally a fan of nitro stouts, but this may be one where it makes sense."
"Way too much chocolate. Hard to drink very much of this one."
""
"Bitter but not fully. Mouthfeel and chocolate of a shake, but no sugar."
""
""
""
"Very flat and no body."
"Delicious brew, rich chocolate in the nose, taste follows. Rather quick finish leaving the same chocolate flavors. Overall good beer and was what I thought I was buying but I will say the mouth feel kind left me wanting more. I wish it was a little thicker like a chocolate shake, instead I feel as though I got chocolaty skim milk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very good overall, but I just don't think I'd get it again. It's definitely something recommendable for someone who likes their beer to taste like chocolate."
""
""
""
""
"Creamy, deliciousness, with a semi-sweet chocolate finish."
"On tap at beachwood seal beach, half size poured into snifter. Dark brown body with ruby highlights and a tan fluffy head that shows good retention and consistent lacing. Aroma is immediately reminiscent of a chocolate malt. Taste is slightly sweet chocolate syrup and roasty malts followed by coffee-like bitterness. Medium body, creamy texture, medium-low carbonation, and a semi-sweet, slightly leafy bitter finish."
""
""
"Good mouthfeel with light hints of coffee over chocolate.  Would recommend and drink again..."

"Nitro draft at Tavern in the Square."

""
""
"O-Awesome sweet stout."
""
"Do not take the word ""chocolate"" lightly. It is what it says it is. And it is phenomenal."
""
"Had this on Nitro, If I had to describe this I would call it alcoholic chocolate milk. I could drink this while eating waffles every morning."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"1/13...pours very dark brown with smidges of brown foam sitting a top. Strong chocolate nose, sweet. Smooth milk chocolate taste, sweet and bitter (semisweet). A touch milky. Taste evolves to darker chocolate. Very flavorful!"
"O - Excellent chocolate porter offering.  Probably my favorite chocolate beer to date.  Will definitely seek this one out again.  Even my wife, who does not like dark beers, thought that this beer was excellent.  4.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: the label says chocolate porter and that's exactly what this is; for me, it's pigeon holes as a dessert beer, which isn't bad, but it's limiting;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Was a little too chocolaty for me!"
""
""
""
"Tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Great aroma, great taste and finish, and absolutely perfect whether beginning your evening or finishing with a night cap."
"Pours a very dark brown with khaki colored head. Chocolate shake, it smells like a chocolate shake; same for the palate. Finishes with just a touch of roasted malt. Interestingly good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"very smooth and it does taste like chocolate"
""
""
"Nitro version on draft excellent appearance and mouthfeel.  Semisweet dark chocolate aroma and taste.  Extremely smooth drinking."
""

"This is fantastic on Nitro"

""

"O- Good, but not great"
""
""

"Shake Chocolate Porter is a beer impossible not to recommend (unless of course the person doesn't like chocolate, in which case they're insane anyhow). While it is admittedly a superficial offering (that can also taste a bit artificial at times), it's still the stuff of a choco-holic's dream. Were they around then, Boulder Beer would certainly have been in the service of Mayan royalty."
""
"tastes and smells like cocoa puffs, love it, great desert beer. overwhelmingly chocolatey and i love it!"
"One of my favorite in recent memory.  Smells of fresh cut wheat fields, Tastes like coco crispies-a must try for port lovers!"
""
""
"Dark brown and opaque, with ruby highlights where the light gets through.  An oatmeal colored head settles quickly leaving a fine head of dimpled bubbles.  Low aroma of chalk and dusty cocoa.  Rich and sweet chocolate flavor right up front, some dark malt, a bit toasty, notes of coffee come through.  Low hop profile, but some floral notes offset the richness. Some roasty bitterness also emerges.  Even and full mouthfeel, creamy and rich.  Good beer, but leans more towards chocolate than porter."
""
"On Nitro tap delicious at wob"
""
""
""
"Beer advocates New system is ridiculously stupid"
""
""
""
""
"Nose to the glass reminds of opening a can of ovaltine or yes a box of coco puffs. Fantastic chocolate finish with amazing mouthfeel. I can only imagine on tap. 12 oz bottle was great."
"Had in on nitro, smooth and delicious chocolate taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the best ""dessert"" beer I've ever had. I'm afraid that might mean that I don't really like stouts or porters, but man, I don't care. The chocolate milk of beers. So good."
""
""
"Tastes like Cocoa Puffs cereal"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Love this beer.  Wish I had more to share."
""
""
""
""
"Liking it more than I would've expected. Nice dark chocolate notes on the nose and palate, with a pleasantly dry finish."
""
""
"Had this on Nitro. Very good, what a chocolate porter should taste like."
""
"Dark, Creamy, large Chocolate presence. One of the better beers I have gotten in a variety 12 pack."
""
""
"The nitro elevated this beer to a different level, IMO. I've had both the regular and nitro now and thought that the nitro was better than the regular, though both are very good. The nitro increased the beer's creaminess, and the roastiness and chocolate flavor really stood out. Very good stuff."

"If you like chocolate flavor in beer, then you will absolutely love this beer. I'm not a huge fan, but it's a perfect execution of what it was going for."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can't find a single of this anywhere, so why not get one here while it's on special?  It pours a straight black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam.  The nose comprises cocoa powder, mild roasted malts, and a hint of coffee.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a nice twinge of graham cracker.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this beer delivers exactly what it promises: a chocolate-laced porter.  It's nothing mind-blowing, but I would definitely have another."

"On-tap. Pours very dark. Dark tan head as well. This beer does not require long, detailed descriptions. It smelled of pure chocolate. It tasted the same. This beer has got to be using a bunch of artificial flavor because the chocolate is that stressed. I don't really frown upon the use of artificial flavoring all the time. I just think that this one is ""too chocolatey to be true"". If your looking for a chocolate beer, go after this one because it will not disappoint. Very creamy on the mouth, too."
""

"Smooth, thanks to the nitro, but a bit bland for my tastes."

"This beer is like a fudge shake--but not sweet. It smells like fudge, and it tastes like fudge. Yet it is recognizably a beer. This is absurdly good. I would highly, highly recommend it. It tends to be moderately expensive, running at about $12 a 6-pack here in South Carolina--however, it is completely worth the price."

"Had this originally on Nitro line at Gingerman in South Norwalk. It had a fantastic nose of chocolate, toasted malt and the sweetness smell that ice cream has. It drank incredibly smooth and had a well balance to it. Now pouring it out of a 12 oz bottle, it has a more bitter smell to it and doesn't smell nearly as sweet or malty. Upon drinking it, it is way more bitter, less smooth and creamy, the malt presence gets lost a bit as well. I recommend having this if you ever see it on nitro line, but I would not buy it again in a bottle."

"Had this on Nitro at O'toole's  in Chicago. Nitro emparts a creamier and maltier flavor. Very nice beer"
""

"Shake pours a black color wiht a small but big lacing head.  There is a very creamy chocolate shake like aroma.  The taste is also very creamy, big chocolate flavors, and resembles a chocolate shake.  Nice feel and nice body, not overly sweet.   Overall its a perfect chocolate beer."
""
""
""
"Mmm...dessert in a glass.  Much better than most other chocolate beers, and worth another round if I find it on tap again.  Good balance, not too sweet, but enough to let you know that you're done with your meal."
""
""
""
"Picked up a sixer after work today and was pretty impressed. The beer looks very inviting with a thick, lasting foam and the aroma is pleasantly ripe with milk chocolate and some light roasty notes. This beer is more chocolate milk than shake, because of the thin body, but it's got a great milk chocolate flavor that makes you forget about the weakish mouthfeel. Great for the price and availability."
"12 oz bottle.Poured into a 20oz firestone glass.Dark brown with a 1 inch head.Very heavy chocolate smell.Not bad.This has got a good flavor .If your looking for a good Porter this is not that bad.Not near as good as the Alaskan Baltic porter but still a very tasty Porter.Give it a try.Motley out."

"On tap at Brews Brothers. Smells just like a chocolate malt. We are drinking the nitro version. Doesn't look like your typical nitro beer. Taste is all sweet. Some beer flavor. Mostly chocolate shake/malt. This would have been awesome to drink when I was like 13. Still, a great after dinner beer."

"Upon my first sip, I definitely got some very nice chocolate, nutty, and coffee notes.  The mouthfeel was especially pleasant.  But what surprised me the most, was that on the back end, you got a bit of sharp hops.  It was unexpected but very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance was dark brown, almost black, with a thin tan head. The smell was full of milk chocolate and toasted malt. The taste was similar but with a crisper finish than I imagined. Very sweet beginning and middle with a mellow finish with chocolate and coffee through out. Very tasty. Mouthfeel was also nice with the consistency of a shake."

"Pleasantly suprised, mild coffee nice chocolate the best of my boulder flight at DIA"
"Ok, I feel I'm rating this lower than how much I really liked it. I really did like this one. Lets start with appearance. This beer was a standard looking porter, though more frothy (like a nitro). Head was very silky and creamy, only a couple millimeters thick. The amount of chocolate, both in the nose and the middle of this beer was staggering. Very dark chocolately. The bitterness was mild, and mostly from the toasted burnt caramelized barley flavor and the bitter chocolate that came through. Alcohol was hardly noticeable at all, and the mouthfeel was very creamy. Not a whole lot of carbonation. Thick layer of lacing on the glass all the way at the very end."

"Overall - This is an excellent brew that I would recommend to all fans of dark beers. Kind of a cross between a chocolate laced porter and a milk stout, I would absolutely buy this again."
""
"Tastes like a chocolate milk. Quite sweet with lots of cocoa. The aftertaste is more of the same. Full bodied and lowly carbonated, this beer comes across as very rich."
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
""
""
"Pours a two-finger brown head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Good chocolate nose and flavor is sweet/roasted chocolate. Smooth. $2.35 for a 12oz bottle Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH. Best by Aug 21, 2014."
"O: Shake is a good chocolate porter with big chocolate aromas and a good chocolate flavor punch, only done in somewhat by the artificial, chemical character in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Chocolaty brown beer capped with a khaki foam that recedes into a thin cap with curtains of lace. It smells like a chocolate milkshake with a bit of cold pressed coffee. Excellent. Taste is lightly bitter, milk chocolate, some espresso. Light sweetness is washed away for a clean mild chocolaty finish. Medium body is creamy. This is a tasty beer."
"Overall: a dessert beer, to be sure, but I really like it. I will definitely be looking for it in bottles."

"01/12/14  On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Wun'erful brew. Just the right amount of adult chocolate without reverting to the Willy Wonka level. A bracing hit of bittersweet at the outset that manifests into a very, very enjoyable drink. If you see it, buy it & drink it. You're welcome."
""
""
""
"Overall- One the better chocolate beers that I've tried, and probably the best porter that I've tried."
"On first sip I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this beer. I like a nice rich porter, and Shake does not deliver that experience. I got more of a watery chocolate taste, although it was very smooth, and most notably, far more crisp than your average porter. I do not know if this is due in part to the nitrogen, as I am admittedly new to that genre of dark beer. All said and done, per my own taste, I would not order this beer again."

"smells like a YOOHOO, taste s like a chocolate shake. I said, I don't like novelty brews, but this is within the parameters of genuine brewmanship, I believe, yet tastes literally like a chocolate shake. maybe I wasn't expecting much when I purchased it, but this one is awesome. not getting the ""thin"" others are talking about... this is thick and creamy and well-constructed. perhaps there are variations in the brewing process and some aren't as good as others, but I absolutely LOVE this..."

"Taste is definitely, first and foremost, heavy in the chocolate. There's a roast, even nutty character that comes forward near the finish. Very nice, and perfect for serious chocolate fans."
""
""
""
"A bit thin but great taste. Better on the nitro tap than the bottle but a great chocolate beer either way if that's what you you like. Not to sweet and not too bitter. Just a great chocolate porter that can stand on its own. My only gripe would to to get it a bit thicker coming out of the bottle as a there is a noticeable difference between the tap and bottle"

"The taste (did I say milk shake?) has an obvious chocolate malt character and reminds me of chocolate ice cream with the mildest of bitter finales. A dessert beer? Most likely."

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, brown-to-black coloring with a dense, creamy, half inch, cream colored head. Beautiful. Aromas of rich milk chocolate, smooth and sweet, with subtle cream highlights. Smells amazing! Flavors are smooth, with a chocolate milk forward characteristic, mostly sweet, with only hints of bitter and roast. This is like a great glass of chocolate milk. Wow! Smooth and light in mouth, with a light cream and chocolate aftertaste. Lactose linger, with a bittersweet chocolate underlay, in an otherwise smooth finish. Bravo!"

"This is a beer I would definitely have again. Might be more a last beer of the night, but an excellent one to end with after a long day. Very drinkable. Probably could have had two."
""
"Pretty much a black colored brew, more so than most porters. The tan head is thick and sturdy and leaves a firm coating of lace. The aroma is pretty darn nice with deep milk chocolate that almost turns to an evergreen malt burst it's so enticing. The flavor is similar but becomes a little more bitter and less of the creamy sweet chocolate that the aroma suggests. The feel is also a little thinner, somewhat aqueous, as compared to the expectations that the aroma conjured. But once you get past expectations the flavor does satisfy the chocolate lover's desire for cocoa flavor and it has a curious grassy, nearly charcoal edge that smooths out after a few tastes. It's solidly medium bodied and seems to gain a creamier feel as you get to the end. Overall, very pleasing."

"3.69/5.00"

"Sure, I'd go for that. Chocolate fiends, get this one, it's good."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- very cool chocolate milkshake drinking experience that isn't too sweet or bitter or dense or thin. Done just about what I'd like a chocolate milkshake beer to be."
""
""
"Overall - Looking for an alternative to a Mudslide in beer form, or a chocolate shake with booze? This is it. Not a whole lot of complex chocolate flavors, just straight malted chocolate. Truly, a one note wonder. Good. Not great. You'd really have to be in the mood for a chocolate shake to love this beer in the moment."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy white head. The smell is of chocolate ice cream, cacao nibs, vanilla, and roasted nuts. It tastes like milk chocolate with a good helping of vanilla and finishes with a slight bitterness like you would get from dark chocolate. I'm typically weary of nitro tapping and think that it often detracts from the quality of a beer, but in this case nitro carbonation is the perfect complement: it gives the beer a velvety mouthfeel that works with the rich flavors to produce a chocolate milkshake experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent chocolate porter. It's a little one-dimensional, but they nail everything chocolate well here."
"I couldn't get over how easy this was to drink. The nitro plays a huge part. While considering the low alcohol content, this still is a dangerous brew to get your hands on since it's easy to go through. I'm not sure how this tastes in a bottle but i'm going have to find out for myself."
""
"But I'm not a big chocaholic, so I want the malt/coffee/hop complexity found in other porters. That's why Boulder's Shake has no future place in my beer fridge: personal taste (or lack there of <g>)."
""
""
"Price Point - $2.30/12 oz single"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice brew, I would recommend this to lovers of chocolate beer and porter alike."
""
"It definitely lives up to the name. This isn't just a porter with a greater emphasis on chocolate malt. This is an actual chocolate beer!"
""
""
""
""
"This is not a good example of an American Porter. It should be much more robust than it is. It just does not work for me."
""
""
"O: This beer is very solid. it's a little one noteish but they set out to do it like that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very well rounded chocolate brew. While the smell is dominated by the chocolate, the flavor is surprisingly well balanced by hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Man, chocolate is right. Massive chocolate and quite a lot of coffee flavors in this beer. The malts melding with it all give off a caramel chocolate vibe... almost like a caramel mocha latte or something along those lines. Pretty nice sweet/bitter balance. The aroma is the stand out with this beer though, as it really smells like, like I said, a caramel mocha latte -- almost exactly. Would make a great candle. There's a good flavor here, but I wouldn't want more than a couple just because the caramel chocolate flavor I pull out of it would get old fairly quickly. Regardless of that, still an outstanding brew."
""
""
"Taste was a bit of a let down. Misses that huge chocolate nose by a large margin. A bit bitter, and a thin mouthfeel. Overall taste was disappointing after such a large nose."
""
""
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted malt, cocoa powder, and chocolate covered banana aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and chocolate syrup flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with tasty flavors, but the mix of various aromas is the highlight of this beer in my opinion."
""

"Pours a dark brown with some amber hues at the edges. Generous 2 fingers of head form upon pour with plenty of lacing left behind. Nose is straight liquid candy bar. Tons of milk chocolate and a bit of roast. Taste is a bit of a let down camp pared to the nose. The chocolate is very dry and adds a considerable amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. Overall, this beer smells great but the taste just doesn't live up to it."
""
""
""
"Guilty pleasure of a beer, but the slight bitterness at the finish prevents it from being overly dessert-like. Great malt character. The only slight issue I have is a hint of acrid taste at the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer. Boulder did a pretty good job with this one, I must say."
"The mouthfeel has an initial coating of the mouth in chocolate but finishes very clean in just a few moments."
"O: This is just an okay brew. I would pass over this in favor of trying some"
""

"A chocolate-y milk shake beer that is not one-dimensional. A great dessert brew!"

"Overall I would pick this up again it seems to have more body than my local breweries ""Chocolate Meltdown"""

"Shake chocolate porter pours a cloudy, very very dark brown, nearly perfectly black with deep crimson glow to light. Head is decent, a loose foam with spotty bubbles. Foam is tiny, not quite thick enough looking. Smell is surprisingly strong; chocoate covered hazelnuts, Hershey's syrup. Smell nearly identical to Samuel Smith's Chocolate Stout, almost to a worrying degree. Real cocoa aromas, perhaps some vague fruitiness. Taste follows aroma, lots of chocolate and grainy cocoa. Sweetness, a touch of herbaly hop bitterness and a lingering earthy finish, coffe and cocoa powder. Quite good, not what I expected. Equal parts cocoa, complimentary hops and dirty earthy, toasted malts. A very nice beer from Boulder, a brewery who's beer I have not so far enjoyed that much. Very nice beer."

"Overall this beer was great. This porter hit the spot and delivered on what it claimed, which was tons of chocolate. Went through a bomber easily, glad its brewed 40 miles from me, will become a staple in my fridge."

"The taste is nicely balanced and the texture is outstanding."

"O: Delicious. If it were full bodied, had less tart, citric flavor, and were bourbon barrel aged, it'd be incredible. I definitely recommend this beer to anyone who likes a good porter. It's perhaps a bit more like a stout than a porter, as it isn't extremely bitter, but the slight sweetness is cut by the tart, lemony flavors, so I can see this being a very accessible beer to those who don't like sweet beers."
""

""
""
""
"Not really my cup of tea. The minerals are way overboard and combined with the chocolate extract tootsie roll twang, just doesn't sit well with me."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 3/11/2014. Pours crystal clear very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger light tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, toffee, caramel, fudge, toast, light roast, light vanilla, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and cocoa nib notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, caramel, toffee, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and cocoa nib flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good chocolate porter. Good robustness and balance of malt and cocoa nib flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Very sweet, great balance between sweet/bitter dark chocolate flavors. My favorite chocolate stout/porter 100% recommend to anyone!"

"O: Many of the beers I have tried with added chocolate have been lopsided with nothing balancing out the chocolate. The brewers here did a good job balancing a bier so chocolaty that I could add some ice cream and make a float! Yummy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer very much tastes like a chocolate malted milkshake and would probably be a good base if you wanted to make a float out of this and drop in a scoop of ice cream, similar to what is done with some stouts. Nonetheless, it is a good dessert beer."
""
""
""
"Like many beers of this kind, I'd venture to say that nitro is the way to go. Served in a shaker, a dark brown-black pour, thick creamy tan head that evolved from a luscious cascade; full retention right to the end and blankets of lacing on the glass. Aroma of cocoa, dark malts, cream. Flavors of bittersweet chocolate and cream, mildly roasty, with some light herbal tea in the finish. Nothing overly complex going on, but just a solid and damn tasty porter overall. Thanks to the nitro, the body was full, the mouthfeel silky and smooth. Quite enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend a bottle based on other reviews, but if you see it on nitro, give it a try!"

"O - This stuff is yummy, but it honestly tastes more like a milk stout instead of a porter. If you like the big chocolate bomb, you'd like this. If you like them bitter, then skip it, it is very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, um, well it's not too bad, not the type of chocolate I like in a beer, this almost tasted like a gimic or fake beer with so much chocolate and fudgesicle there is nothing left to make this beer like."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a chocolate milkshake. If that's what you're looking for, then look no further! If you're not into sweet beers, then steer clear. The beer doesn't have much bitterness, which I prefer in a beer - so this is more of an alternative than a standard."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked this beer. I liked the sweetness and the chocolate works well with all the normal porter flavors. I haven't had a chocolate porter before but could definitely find myself in the mood for another one of these over a heavy holiday meal. Good stuff, worth a try."
""

"Extremely smooth, just over medium body, light effervescence. Creamy. Delicious. More."

"I really enjoyed the shake chocolate porter. The beer poured a dark opaque with ecru head that left some lacy. The scent was chocolate....almost semi sweet nestle morsel chocolate. The taste follows the scent and is incredibly delicious. This comes close to the best porter I've ever had. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a great porter...nice job!"
""
""
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium body with very strong roasted dark malt flavor that overpowers the sweeter chocolate malt flavors. Not as well balanced as the nose suggests with a much stronger, slightly acrid burnt malt presence that lingers over the sweeter notes into a very dry finish. Smokey with hints of ash, burnt toast and charred wood along with bittersweet dark chocolate, oatmeal and spent coffee grinds. There's some lighter malt sweetness toward the end of the palate with hints of milk chocolate, hazelnut and caramel but everything us overwhelmed by the heavy roast. The light mouthfeel and subtle sweetness help drinkability but thus beer is too one dimensional and overly roasted for my preference."
""
""
"Dark chocolate hue with a hint of cola ruby highlights, tan fluffy textured head, with speckled lacing left behind. Aroma creamy cocoa powder, herbal anise like character, with toffee and other nearly burnt sugars, a really soft nice smelling cocoa porter. Flavors just work, creamy toffee, bitterness from the cocoa nibs, again very soft creamy texture I would have guessed oatmeal, the label doesn't mention that but they do use chocolate wheat. It's a more drinkable version of something like Southern Tier Choklat, I can only do 4 ounces of that one, this one however, I could throwback at least two or three bottles. The powdered cocoa, and cocoa nib additions really help balance the sweetness, finishes semi dry in the end, well brewed masterfully done , medium bodied I'm guessing they're comparing it to a malty shoppe chocolate shape it's that creamy and dessert like. Overall killer brew, I will be picking up more for the wife to try."
"If you are hooked to chocolate, you must taste this."
"Pours a creamy dark color and smells of cocoa... hot chocolate even ... tastes the same way.. Makes this very very easy to drink and well just plain delicious I can't help but order this or buy this every time I see it... fav beer almost sooo close. Pours amazing from the growler and the bottle"

"Pours a deep dark brown with a decent sized mocha head that leaves a bit of spotty lace. Aromas of milk chocolate with hints of caramel and a light non descript fruit. The chocolate overpowers most of the aroma and has a hint of artificial to it. The flavor is heavy with milk chocolate and caramel with bits of earthiness just to shake it up. Hershey's chocolate syrup is mostly what I taste. Medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation and a sweet silky almost chalky mouthfeel. Sweet sticky chocolate beer. I like it, its pretty simple, but I like chocolate and it kind of worked for me."

"O: this is a great, easy drinking porter. I would like to compare nitro to regular tap. But, I would certainly order this again, or buy it in store."

""
"Overall this is a satisfying beer that gets the chocolate flavor right. Something you could easily knock back a six pack of."

"Alcohol? It's here somewhere but it was tough to find - not that I particularly cared. Porters are great when done right and with the chocolate and coffee notes here, they have a range that was previously unknown to me. No matter - this was a great beer that pushes the edge out a bit more without being too radical by seeming so old and familiar. Perfect for dessert, cool nights this season, or those looking for something different that feels like it's been around forever. Nice job on Boulder's part!"
""
"O - A new beer from Boulder, and very good. One of the better chocolate porter's that I have had."
""
""
""
""

"I am not a fan of chocolate or porters, but this stuff was great...just like a chocolate shake. The aroma didn't make me too excited, but everything after that was great. My favorite part is that it's not too heavy...drinkability is great. Could put down a few of these."
"Boulder’s latest offerings have been a pleasant departure from their regular lineup. I hope they keep up the good work."
"It really stinks when a beer starts out so promising and then loses steam when you actually start drinking it. The dry, roasted quality on the palate would be fine if more of those sweet flavors came through as well. Especially since Boulder Beer toys with your emotions and gives you such a scrumptious bouquet of sweet chocolate."
""
""
"Overall- Above average to good beer. Comes close to living up to its promise. Definitely worth a try as it is a solid porter. Would definitely buy this again."

"Pours deep brown with a mocha head. They nailed the name for this beer as it totally smells like a chocolate shake. Don't need to explain the aroma at all here....think of a nice, creamy chocolate milkshake and that is what you get. Flavor is super chocolately but not as tightly wound as the aroma. Milk chocolates, dark chocolates, a touch of roastiness, and a little creamy shake in the finish. Good flavor, but I enjoyed the aroma a touch more. A medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, pretty a nice beer from Boulder here. Didn't know they had it in them."

"This beer is fantastic. It poured a nice dark almost blackish brown with a nice 1 inch head. spotty very little lacing left behind. It smells like amazing hot chocolate. its the most chocolaty beer ive ever encountered. The taste of this is just the same as the nose. great for a winter night. super drinkable. if you love chocolate...and if you love beer. get this. Drink it at room temp as well. If its too cold I feel it could take away from the chocolate character. Finally a beer that tastes as good as its name."

"Shake is a delightful Porter that really pushes the chocolate flavors to an absurd level. Much like Samuel Smith's Chocolate Stout and Southern Tier's Choklat, this dark ale is the latest in that chain of chocolate beers. Its relatively lighter body is somewhat its savior and its curse."
""
""
""
"Overall - Big and sweet with lots of chocolate and nice roasted flavors. A nice brew when looking for something sweet, chocolaty and coffee like."
""
"The feel is silky smooth, like velvet on the tongue, with a low carbonative fullness."
"This offering delivers on the chocolate, but it leaves a bit to be desired as a porter."
""
""

"This beer is a dark, almost blackish, brown color. It is capped with a tan head and the liquid has reddish hues when held to the light. The smell is malty, with lots of chocolate overtones. Nutty, with subdued roastiness. There is a sweet and toasted smell to the beer. Think of Nutella on very toasted homemade bread. The taste is moderately sweet, with some mid-taste bitterness to even things out. Somewhat abrupt finish, but lots of chocolate flavor. Full in body, and a thick, smoothness to the mouthfeel. Very good."
"best thing ive had from boulder beer maybe ever. looks thin and translucent from the bottle, but amounts to a pretty dense chocolate brown liquid in my globe with just less than an inch of soapy off white head. I wish it stayed heady longer, more cream, more sex appeal, but it is what it is. smells really chocolaty, which I adore. cocoa powder and melted milk chocolate are both present. nice medium roast malt base, slightly sweet, but bitter enough to balance the chocolate. very pleasant, not over the top at all. the flavor is a mix of so many chocolates. dark and white chocolate both flash in here, buttery and soft, distinctly flavored, long wintery finish. its warming in a comforting way, not an alcoholic one. I bought a single because I thought six would bee to much, but I am regretting that choice now. this is highly drinkable, and it is the perfect season for beer like this. I am most impressed by the way the various chocolate layers are woven into a porter that would be excellent as a standalone. I will be drinking plenty of this in the coming months."

"12oz bottle $1.79. Dark black-brown, good head. Smells like chocolate, tootsie rolls. The flavor was strong chocolate tootsie rolls and Count Chocula cereal. The chocolate is very heavy on this and one bottle was enough for me but this was a pretty solid beer."
""
""
"Overall: I hear this beer was good, I'm setting more on the above average spectrum. Better then most of the stuff out of bolder brewing company, but nothing special."
"O: A very well put together chocolate porter. A medley of different grains provide depth and complexity. The chocolate, while very much the focal point of the beer, lets up just enough to allow the rest of the beer to shine through. This is one of those rare beers that provides a simple hedonistic drinking pleasure, but is also multi-faceted and complex enough to allow the drinker to dissect and think about it more if he or she so chooses. I've never really been wowed by anything Boulder Beer has done, but I can respect the hell out of this effort. Damn good stuff."
""
"O - This was the surprise beer in a variety 12 pack. I enjoy all the other beers I've had from Boulder, so I was happy with this. I would definitely seek this one out again."
"Overall: Solid, enjoyable. Even the 5.9% ABV is a likable feature. An almost personable chocolate brew. Almost."

"Overall: This is one of those beers you don't have to sip but you can if you want to savor. I almost wanted to chug it down like a shake I was that ready for it, but I restrained myself. It's not too heavy and not too light, so it's a nice change from the more robust porters I've had in the past. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in its taste and smell."
"Overall: interesting and tasty. Chocolate shake indeed."
