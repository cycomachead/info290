"Pours opaque but clear. Very dark brown.Thin head of tan foam that fell quickly but left lace.  Nose is shy but malty and rich.  Caramel and bread crust. Good roast taste, nothing burnt.  Robust, smooth but with a slight edge to it.  Medium mouthfeel, slightly chewy.  Perfect carbonation, light hop bitter for balance and a touch of herbal at the swallow."

"A good light bodied porter, has enough of a roasty taste to overcome the lack of mouthfeel"

"Overall. I prefer a heavier body and more malt character, but OK as a dry porter."
""
"Very pleasing. With coffee and chocolate nuances. Smooth with little alcohol presence. Slight hop finish."
""
"O= despite not being a very memorable porter - it isnt bad and would certainly get it again."
""
""
""
"O: for OkAy not bad but wont buy again"
""
""
""

"Overall, this is another winner from Southern Tier. It is not as bitter, full of coffee or chocolate other porters but it is very smooth."
"O: A solid porter with a good balance between the roast and dark fruits. Very easy to drink, and an under-looked beer for being under $9 a 6-pack"
"overall 3. average. wouldn't really drink again."

"Dissppointing coming from these guys."

"O: More acrid than the nose suggests. A very no-frills porter. Drinkable and serviceable enough, but it doesn't stand out too much."

"A solid porter but just not quite as bold and rich as I would like.  Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side and there was not a whole lot in terms of finish in the flavor.  Notes of coffee and chocolate throughout with a light smokiness.  Just wish all those flavors had been more robust and bold."

"The bottle claims it's a ""Dark Robust Porter"" but it was anything but. Thin, clear, and tasted like a light beer version of a porter. No thanks."
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear but dark brown with very little head that dissipates quickly.  The aroma of the malts comes through but is  quickly overshadowed by the flavor of the hops, which are fairly prominent in this porter. A clean finish and not too heavy. This is a great beer, I enjoyed every drop!"

"Overall / Drinkability: Hmmm....I wonder if this one is just past due with a bottling date of January. Still, there was an emphasis on robust and compared to many Southern Tier dark beers that I've had which are malt bombs, this is at the other end of the spectrum. Definitely a bitter brew, and perhaps a bit lopsided towards bitterness rather than ""robust"" as described on the label. It got better as it warmed up, but only so much. I may try again with a newer bottle and see if it gets more balanced or any better."
"Overall – The look and taste of the brew are really fantastic. If it wasn’t for the lackluster smell and feel this could easily be a top class year round porter. Overall it is well worth a try though if you get a chance."

"O-A very nice example of the American take on the porter. While porters are not terribly bitter, they can be a bit intimidating to the newcomer. This would probably be a great choice for someone just getting their feet wet, and it is definitely complex enough to satisfy someone craving something with some complexity. Very nice."
""
""
""
"This porter is best paired with food, probably something sweeter, such as Kansas City BBQ ribs."
""
""
"O- Ok at best. Probably the worst porter I've tried. Not my typical response to a southern tier brew and that's unfortunate. No flavor, no body. Oh well they still get my business for their IPA selections."

"O - a little less roasted than Smuttynose robust porter but probably better balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent Porter, very enjoyable with very present coffee notes. It is a flavorful brew with medium complexity, but not really robust as the label says and not with a unique taste."
""
""
""
""
"O - A good porter but is lacking some bold characteristics."

"O- There are definitely some good parts of this beer and worth trying to add to a collection. But not the absolute best porter I've ever had."

"O- Overall, this beer was ok. I think I was expecting more as I like this brewery a lot. For a porter the smell and the mouthfeel were great, but it just seemed pretty ordinary and not very memorable. In this day and age with so many different breweries sprouting up everywhere, an ok beer from a great brewery doesnt quite cut it-for me anyway. I will never buy this again. However, if I am at a restaurant and it's the only craft, I would get it. But that's not saying much."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 1/21/2013. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, coffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, light coffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, toffee, light coffee, biscuit, and light nuttiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt notes; with a good sweet/roast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice porter style. All around good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"The Rest: Body is just on the thin side of medium. This is a balanced, no-frills, straight-up Porter that checks all the boxes of the style and is pretty delicious. It doesn't overpower or overwhelm and is very sessionable."

"Overall: Southern Tier’s porter tastes very pleasant, but it is very forgettable. Actually for a porter, it’s pretty weak. I really miss the roasted coffee chocolate, vanilla, burnt sugar, nutty notes that I’m used to tasting in porters. In my opinion, the beer actually makes a better schwarzbier than a porter."
"Overall, so much for the robust on the label. This is tasty, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't grab me like I had hoped."

"O: a relatively gentle, subtle and refined American porter with admirable balance and complexity. Not as rich or strong as a typical Robust Porter."
""
""
"Overall not a bad porter - the shining point is how easy it goes down. Could be a little more robust, considering the label says ""robust porter"". Worth a try."
""
""
"Had to pour a little vigorously to get any head, which was light and thin. Perhaps it's my mood (long day at work) but the smell was perfect - smooth, soft, creamy-chocolatey. At first, seemed to go down more smoothly than expected, but by the end, noticed the carbonation (not bad; just seemed to change over time). It was a little colder than was necessary; still regulating the beer fridge, so that may have dampened the flavor a bit, but still felt that it had a distinct light-chocolate/coffee taste."

"Southern Tier Porter pours deep brown with a finger of head - about standard for the style. The aroma is sweet and roasty, with a bit of chocolate. The taste is where things get a little weird. I'm not sure if it's an over-roast flavor or some sort of coffee addition that adds a touch of acidity that is rather distracting during the sip. After that passes, it's pretty solid porter territory, with a nice strong roast through the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and a bit too highly carbonated, and the drinkability is solid. Overall, an average porter that has a few flaws that really hold it back."
""
""
""
"An overlooked but great beer from Southern Tier."
"O - Just an 'ok' porter. The mouthfeel is a little odd and a bit too thin. Not much here in terms of complexity or robust flavor. But what remains is still a rather pleasant, drinkable beer that I would have again if the opportunity presented itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all a decent Porter that I have found is best served slightly chilled."
""
""
"At first, I wasn't sure what I thought of this one, but after finishing a couple I decided I definitely do like this porter, and will buy it again."
""
"Overall: As others have pointed out, it is good but not great. It represents the style well but lacks the personality found in other brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"notes; good but not great, I would not turn it down but not so sure I would buy a sixer with so many other great porters out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite nice, in a rather sedate fashion. Roasted malt and other associated aromas/flavours are present but tread lightly. Perhaps the flavours are muted due to age - I'll have to try a fresher bottle some time. At any rate, it goes down without complaint. Drinkable and perfect for when you want something undemanding. Worth sampling."
""
"Cheers!"
"Overall a real enjoyable porter. Can always rely on it to be tasty. One I would drink again and recommend to others."
""
""
""

"It has an excellent aftertaste that mostly tastes of the roasted malts. I do not intent to try this again."

"i wanted to hate this beer but i cant if you like domain oak barrell stout this taste much lighter but this beer you can drink and enjoy the beer the hop in it proves most enjoyable a great taste to a beer great color the more i drink the more i like so grab a six pack and taste the greatness a good beer to enjoy"
"O - A tad low on carbonation. Good hop thru the smoothness. A tad too sweet for a porter. However, a good beer to sit back and enjoy on any Fall day... Summer Spring Winter are all good season too..."
""
""
""
"I'm not so sure I'd categorize this as a Robust Porter. It is a very flavorful porter however, and worth a try especially if you like the darker beers. It treads closely to the stout category but seems clearly identifiable as a porter. I'll have to savor more of the six-pack before I see where is falls in the line of the porters I like."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a definitely a really good porter. I definitely recommend this one."
""
""
""

"O-Although a fine beer, there are much better porters out there, and much better southern tier products."
""
""
""
"Dark brown, almost black and mostly opaque. Cream colored head with some lacing. Roasted, dark aroma. Flavor is toasty and sweet. Hints of cooked corn meal and mild coffee. Descent balance with average complexity. Smooth feel and dry in the finish with an herbal hop snap. Good carbonation. Standard porter overall yet tasty and easy to drink."

"Overall Impression- A very hopped up Porter reminding me of a FFF Alpha Klaus! Enjoyed greatly and look forward to having again."

"O - On the sweeter side of style, but with a great roast character to balance it. Fantastic mouthfeel."
"Overall, a bit too much hop profile for the style. The malt character was overwhelmed, and what was detectable was too roasty. Could use more malt complexity."
""
"Thanks to EgadBananas for providing this bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with a quickly dissipating tan head. The beer appears clear ruby red near the edge of the glass. A little bit of lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. Chocolate, coffee, and malt dominate the aroma. It's mildly sweet smelling. There are flavors of bitter chocolate, coffee, and sweet malt. There are some hops, but this is not a strong flavor. The body is light to medium with some carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. While not the best porter I ever had, this is certainly recommended."
""
""
""
""

"O= overall I guess I was expecting slightly more excitement after being a longtime fan of their Baltic Porter. Still, a decent offering."
""
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Pours a dark brown with copper highlights. A one finger, light tan head that dissipated into lacing The most prominent aromas earthy, piney hops, chocolate and malt. This beer starts bitter and ends with a hint of smoke. There is a nice malt backbone. Overall this is a very pleasant porter, a style that I am still becoming familiar."
""
"Pours a dark black-brown with a very thin layer of tan head. Smells of coffee, chocolate and spice that's typical of a dark porter. Taste and smell go hand-in-hand with a good robust coffee flavor followed by a bitter dark chocolate taste and smooth malty finish. if it lacked anything, it's that extra punch of perhaps alcohol and some mild sweetness. Overall a good beer that i would certainly have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Weak head, maybe half a finger tops of light brown foam, no real lacing to speak of. Immaculate and unblemished black liquid, the rims form a broad orange circle with yellow at the furthermost parts, transparent thereabouts. The nose presents an attractive spine of hops, herbal matter and pressed flowers before yielding the floor to café au lait, milk chocolate, scones, orange peel and cola notes, so much roast and toast, maybe an undercurrent of dark fruits, steady presence and without rough patches. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is soft and downy which adds to the smooth, creamy texture, effortlessly fills in every crevice of your palate. Sweet yet not sugary, hard to imagine more malty roast, all chocolate, cocoa, mocha, coffee, nuts and breakfast baked goods. The orange citrus, pine and pinch of pepper add moderate contrast. Plum and black cherry fruit make a swift appearance. There’s not a lot of nuance nor subtlety here but there’s consistency and richness in spades. Waves of it, in fact."

"Porters make great winter drinking, but I couldn't decide if I liked this one cold or room temperature. I decided I didn't like it that much either way. The flavor was hollow - it starts with a nice mouth filling roasted coffee blast, but ends empty and stale. Not the worst beer, but a very average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really a malt forward porter that comes of very well. Approachable and easy to drink."
"Overall pretty nice, good malts, not too sweet like I've come to expect from ST. Drinkable but doesn't blow my socks off."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle and served in a mug, the beer pours a thin, very dark brown coloring that is black in the depths and has a pencil thin, light brown head that disappears rapidly on the surface of the brew. Aromas of coffee bitterness and roast are highlighted with nutty sweetness and a touch of smoke. On the palate, the beer is crisp, with light, bitter, roasted coffee and earthy undertones blended together on a thin, crisp body. The aftertaste is rich and slick, with a coffee grounds flavor to it. Slick and quick finish, with a slightly bitter feel left behind. Solid brew."
""
"O - This is a big difference from the other ""dark"" Southern Tier beers...I understand this a porter and it's brewed year round, but I found myself wanting more after having their big beers"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark amber color with ruby on the edges, foamy 1/2"" tan head with good retnetion, educes to a small cap. Nose is kind of bland, light roast and chocolate. This is a well balanced porter, roastiness is the main influence mixed with faint chocolate, flower, slight toast. Medium body, tends to feel a bit flat and thick on the toungue. Finishes dry, I wish it had a tad more carbonation to help."
""
"D and O: Kind of dull and not exciting. Lack of overall character really gives me a bad impression."
"I had this porter at the brewery pulled from the tap. It poured nice and dark like you would expect it too. There was little to no lacing after about 45 seconds. The taste on the front gives you that dark chocolate and subtle fruit feel, on the back of your mouth it gives you just a little bit of hops to enjoy. As usual most of the beers that I drink I drink while eating something. I believe that pairing beers, especially craft beers is something that is very fun to do. Southern Tier Brewery only has a soup du jour and a pulled pork sandwich on its menu. I had the pulled pork sandwich with the Porter and found it to balance the sweetness of the bbq sauce as well as the acidity of the coleslaw. I enjoyed it and brought home a 1/6 keg of it for my home."

"This one pours a ruby charcoal with a bit of a foamy top. There’s a distinctive roast aroma on this, with just a hint of dark roast espresso underneath. It’s not bad at all. Tastes roasty up front with a sharp peak and a hint of bitterness on the finish. It’s an easy drinker and one that I’d enjoy again."
""
"D - A nice porter - nothing too great, but it is enjoyable. I probably won't buy it again, but I'd drink it if offered."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a very easy drinking porter that is also quite flavorful. It’s session so I would have no problem drinking several of these in one sitting."
"O: Not a bad porter. The head was disappointing, but the nose and flavor weren't bad. I did prefer the Breckenridge Vanilla porter though."
""
""
""
""
"A good example of a porter. Love to have this on cask."
"O: Not a bad porter. Not big or complex, just a nice drinkable take on the style."
"O - As I've said several times, this porter isn't very robust in several categories. It is pretty average in all of them besides the smell of the malts I can pick out and its pretty clean."
""
""
"Poured semi opaque dark brown with a slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Slight smell of roasted coffee and chocolate. Semi burnt kind of smell. Bland taste. As with smell, burnt chocolate coffee taste, slight malt flavor. Moderate carbonation. Overall had expected more from Southern Tier, their stouts are excellent."
""

""
""

""
""
"D: Drinks nicely, I would imagine this would pair well with some sort of tiramisu or some other coffee desert."
"dark and roasty this is a great porter. looks a little red in the glass behind a black chocolate cloak and a moderate thin head. smells like the grill when its going hot, but with some tangy fruiy undertone too. taste is really rich but not sweet, more malty than a lot of porters, and with a definitey dried cranberry type of fruit essence. not sure i fully understand this one, but i absolutely enjoy it. will go for the sixpack not the single next go around"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Deep brown with ruby highlights, one finger of tan head, minimal lacing left behind. Smell is of bittersweet chocolate, subtle coffee and roasted malts present, mild hop presence leaving a piney scent under the malt. Taste is chocolatey, nice hop bill that is most present in the finish, roast malts, almost berry like aftertaste, moderate bitterness throughout. Medium carbonation, creamy and medium bodied. Not a bad porter despite it being a little one dimensional, serves its purpose and is quite drinkable, would be a nice fall beer as the weather starts to get cooler."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad beer. The flavor could be a little more robust, but overall it's worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
"O-Flavors are can be subtle at times, but overall well crafted. Would have liked to see a little more roasted character in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an easy drinking beer with a nice malty flavor. It has a flat appearance and faint aroma, but otherwise well done."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Just a pretty general porter. Pretty standard, nothing new, nothing done perfectly. Just, porter. I like simple and perfectly done, this is kind below that point. It's good, but theres better. Nice body and a bit more flavor in this one would have made this simple and perfect."
""
""
""
"if you're looking for a good porter, look elsewhere."

"pours a dark and bubbly amber/brown with a thin lace of head that fades quickly. Smells heavily of roasted malts with hints of smoke and chocolate. Medium to full in body in body but with high carbonation. Flavors of chocolate, caramel, coffee and wood but with a burnt characteristic. Mild piney hop presence on the back end. Very well balanced with nicely blended flavors. More than drinkable. Finishes smooth with a mild coffee bitterness."
""
"O- A super solid porter. Score one more for the Tier."
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent, better and worse porters out there. Its a little weak in the flavor department, but its smooth and easy to enjoy. Worth a drink to porter fans but dont expect a world class beer."
"Overall a pleasant porter that is quite drinkable. Not an extraordinary beer, but nicely made."
"-JH-"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle sampled on October 23, 2011. The pour is dark brown with flickers of ruby in the light. The head is minimal but long lasting. Nice dark malts in the aroma with a bit of coffee but more to the malts. The body falls into the medium range but there is a creamy, milky texture too. The taste tends to highlight the malts with a low bitterness in the hops toward the end. A pleasing and mellow Porter."
"O-A decent porter, the hop presence was nice but mainly dominated by the roasted malt."
"O: Easy drinker, nice middle of the road Porter. Worth a try. Another solid beer from Southern Tier."
"O: good decent porter. say 5.8% ABV, not sure if beer is changed or OP got it wrong. good porter."
"O - Maybe I am just spoiled with big, complex porters, but this one just didn't do it for me. Seemed kinda boring."
"I like this beer. It's bitter but wholly drinkable. This is a very sessionable beer."
"Low head of frothy white foam that settles out quickly gives way to a reddish brown with ruddy edges. Aroma of rich dark malt and faint cocoa. Rich flavors of roasted malt, cocoa and leather, hints of root beer, a mild cherry twang, subtle oak and smoke, some licorice. Lots of interesting flavors. Moderate mouthfeel, even carbonation, finishes a bit tannic and powdery. Tasty beer, but I agree with others who say it leans more toward English than American/robust."
"Southern Tier played it safe with this beer, but that is not always a bad thing. There is room in the beer world for a nice, straight-forward porter. Up front mild but adequate roasted malt flavor with medium mouthfeel - nothing over-roasted. Acidity was well-balanced, as it seems many porters stray into an astringency. Hopping plays second fiddle to the malt, which seems to place this beer more in the English porter realm than the more aggressive American Porter (remember when we called it ""robust porter?"")."
"Southern Tier is doing their jobs as usual."
"0 - decent beer worth a drink and depending on my mood may try again"
"overall this beer was ok .... i won't get it again. way too hoppy for the style which did give it a very different and GOOD taste .... just not a porter in my mind. nothing against hops either i love hoppy beers but not in my stout or porters when i'm in the mood for sweet malt flavors."
"O - Decent porter, but nothing I would seek out. Just too thin to be that enjoyable."
"something I would purchase again"
"Mouthfeel is light but smooth. At 5.2% ABC, this porter is certainly makes a nice ""light"" desert when something stronger would be too much for your swollen belly."
"A nice solid Porter, very dark but not quite black. Good head retention that eventually laces the glass nicely. A well balanced tasting brew with a slightly herbal sort of aroma, that I can't quite place or give a name to, nevertheless very pleasing."
"o - a little disappointed with this offering from southern tier, the other few of their brews i have tried were all pretty damn good. still an decent beer, but there are better examples of the style."
"The smell is a mix of hazlenut, roasted malts, some spice. It has a taste of coffee, smoke and a small amount of chocolate. MF is medium with bitterness in the finish. It sits for some time on your palate. This is a good porter, but not something that I expect to revisit in the future."
"Notes: A well rounded American porter. Cheers."
"It's certainly not much of what I look for in a porter, but I suppose it hits its mark alright. It's not a heavy beer, and it's on the sweet side rather than the sharp malt bite of comparable stouts. It'd go better paired with a dessert than any entree. As the beer warms up much more, the body fills out a bit, which is good. The berry notes get juicier and the roast profile broadens. But despite it all, this is a porter that missed the mark for me. It feels like an incomplete beer, or even an attempt at another style that fell short and was saved into a porter."
"This beer poured out a like a typical porter should, It was black in color and semi-thick looking with a nice brown head on top. The head faded and didn't do a whole lot in way of lacing. The smell of the beer had an earthy roasted aroma to it. The taste of the beer was slightly chocolately and had some burnt flavors going on in there too. The mouthfeel was a little heavier than I expected and it leaves a dry roasted feeling in the aftertaste. Overall not a bad porter, just not my favorite either."
"i remember absolutly loving this beer when i was first getting in to craft and havent really had it since, now that ive finally come back to it, its just a little disappointing, id pass this up for an edmund fitz anyday, but im not saying i wouldnt drink it again."
"Overall, it left a good impression on me. The appearance and mouth-feel are quite impressive. The flavor was not quite as intense as I had hoped for, but it made up for it with complexity. A well crafted and purposeful porter that I would like to try on-tap. Probably not my first choice in a porter, but one that one could grow to like a lot. A must try for anyone who likes porters, like me."
"Overall - A supremely well balanced porter... definitely recommended..."
"Morey’s Bottom Line: This is good enough that it makes you wish that Southern Tier would lower the alcohol content a bit on some of their other dark beers. Pairs extremely well with Beemster X-O cheese, which is aged for 26 months."
"Pours a very dark brown/black color. Has a strong scent of cocoa but that's about it. Very good robust taste that really hit the tounge well. Good taste in the rosted malts with a little cocoa and carmel in the mix. Rather smooth and drinks well with almost no after taste. A good dark beer that isn't quite as heavy as a Stout. Was very nicely made only wish the taste stuck around for a bit after the swallow."
"overall, a nice drinkable porter. Slightly above average. Priced right in my comfort zone at about $9 a six-pack and readily available, so im sure I will reach for it again."
"D - Very drinkable. The chocolate and coffee are nicely balanced throughout. The creamy mouthfeel is also really great."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty average porter. Most of all those nice roasty porter flavors were there, but they weren't as roasty and robust as I would like in a porter. I also didn't like the sweetness in this beer which really hurt it's drinkability. There was no hop presence in this beer and I think that really hurt it. This beer needs to be more robust, less sweet, and have some hop presence to it to balance everything out. I don't think I would buy this again since there are many better local porters that are readily available to me and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone either, there was just too much shit that needs to be fixed with this beer. This was my first review for a Southern Tier beer and I wasn't impressed, I have tried some of their other beers and liked them, so I know they make some good beers, but this wasn't one of them."
"Light and deft on the palate, with the dry roastiness begging for another quaff, this is one easy-drinker and a fairly good, entry-worthy representation of the style that is not too complex but just interesting enough. Pair with braised beef, dark chocolate or drop in a scoop of ice cream for a grown-up float."
"Overall a good porter, could use a little sweetness for some. balance."
"Overall it is a very good porter. Something I would be most happy to have again. Would be excellent after a meal paired with some chocolate cake or ice cream."
"ST's porter is a decent beer, but not at all up to par with a lot of other examples. It definitely does not strike me as being ""robust"" as the label advertises. It is a great deal though and a nice change up from my go to porters from Founders and Bell's"
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pours a very dark with a tan head, smells of dark molasses and spice, but not too prevalent. Tastes like a robust porter but just not the likes of smutty or founders. Feels great and overall it is a great beer but if given the choice within this style I would definitely take founders or smutty"
"O: A run-of-the-mill porter. Doesn't compare with better offerings like Edmund Fitzgerald. Maybe it's the way the hops are used, but the flavors seem a bit jumbled to me."
"O - A very solid porter, although I'm not sure on the 'robust' part. Nonetheless, there is not a thing wrong with this beer from a porter standpoint. Would have again."
"Nothing really too out there, but incredibly smooth. If you're looking to have a smooth, smooth porter, this would do it."
"Overall a very solid and very drinkable porter I will look for again."
"Back in Johnstown, Pennsylvania AGAIN...for business. Had dinner at the Boulevard restaurant...AGAIN. This night they had the Southern Tier Dark Porter....ON TAP! The color was very dark amber, almost black with white head that laced ok. The nose was weak...didnt smell anything. The taste was ok...not very rich...like I prefer my poters. There were hints of coffee and earth. The mouthfeel was good thank to the light ABV. This beer is worth a taste and I would only session if it was this vs. miller lite."
"Taste is really easy going for a porter, it is a nice break from some other Southern Tier offerings. Creamy smooth, chocolaty and rich malts. Very good indeed."
"Robust in the sense of the intensity of the dark malts, but not robust in body. Still, this is a good porter when you're in the mood for something dark and burnt."
"D-well to be honest, the more i drink, the better it becomes. its pretty filling, but i liked it til the end."
"I love drinking porters...especially in the summer. I fatigue quickly of light summer beers with the lemons and the lightness...I find I start craving toasty flavors, coffee notes, malty sweetness backed by hop bitterness, chewy enough to be a meal. Especially with the grill a lager is not going to compliment those char flavors like a hardy porter will. I don't even want to get into the details with this one: it tastes good, its what a porter should taste like, its what a beer should taste like."
"Southern Tier's Porter pours a dark brown, small off white head. Smells of roasted malts and some smoke. In the flavor, roasted malt, dark fruit, and very light coffee flavors. Simple and to the point, the Southern Tier porter is pretty tasty and at a moderate strength. Good sessionability, but overall was just an average porter."
"Pretty much a middle of the road porter... Not bad but not memorable..."
"Pours black with touches of brown in the light. Light layer of off white foam. Good lacing. Light chocolate smell, but not strong. Rich roasted taste, light coffee bittering at the finish. Smooth. Modest carbonation pokes through. Drinkable porter, bittering finish picks up as beer warms."
"12oz bottle. Pours a black color with some red hues and a thin head that leaves quickly. Some lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malts, and some coffee. Flavors of mostly coffee and malts, but the taste is rather weak. A bit thin and watery. Overall I'm disappointed with this offering. I like Southern Tier a lot but this is a very pedestrian brew."
"D - Great for the style. I guess it's really just a downright good porter, you get roast, then bitter and finishes semi-sweet. Solid brew."
"M: Light to moderate body with lots of carbonation."
"Drinks ok. Not super anxious to have it again, but it's still a pleasant beer to drink."
"D - One of the more drinkable porters I can recall ever having. Simple but bold flavor profile, well crafted with a very reasonable ABV. If you're looking for a drinking man's porter, this may fit the bill."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, mildly grainy, gummy, and spritzy."
"Mouthfeel is good, a little thinner than I expected, especially with the word ""robust"" on the label. Full bodied, good carbonation and has a nice clean bitter finish. Very drinkable, another very good beer from Southern Tier."
"Pretty good drinkability. This isn't a ""wow"" porter, but it's a solid one."
"D - Very drinkable and well balanced, this could really pass as a chocolate porter with all of its intense, chocolate roast character. The chocolate dominates the flavor, but there are also notes of caramel, molasses, and a hint of licorice to keep things interesting. Quite nice, I passed by this beer on the store shelves quite a few times before I finally decided to give it a try, and I am pleasantly surprised to find that it deserves more attention than I gave it."
"Drinkability: One of my oldest favorites from Southern Tier. A very nice porter."
"D: Not blowing me out of the water, to be honest."
"I'm thinking this is a porter, possibly one with coffee? Let's reveal... It's a porter, (and a good one I might add) Southern Tier Porter."
"Not what I was looking for. Went down ok, but would not repeat."
"A solid offering from a solid brewery. Nothing groundbreaking here, just a good, solid beer."
"D: A very well balanced robust porter that has a good malt profile and nice balance that allows for ease of drinkability. It goes down smooth and easy. If you like porters it is one to seek out."
"A subtle but robust nose of dark roasted malts and some sweet caramel and coffee. Very smooth and full of chocolate and dark roasted malt. A great fresh dark malty aftertaste that leaves a mild astringency. For a porter this is very drinkable."
"Pairs well with grilled burgers with cheddar, or vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce."
"Nice roasted malt flavor without any bitter astringency. Finishes moderately dry, but the mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. No lingering flavors or hop flavors detected. Nicely drinkable. Overall a pretty solid offering."
"D-Extraordinarily high, if one were to session porters, this would be a great candidate."
"Somehow I never found this guy before last week or so. Odd. It pours a clear garnet-brown topped by a bit less than a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, molasses, brown sugar, and maple syrup. A nice amount of roast, if I do say so myself. The taste runs very similarly, though the roast is slightly muted, but this is made up for a bit with a touch of walnut. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a nice porter, not amazing, but more than drinkable and rather enjoyable."
"D- st makes some amazing brews. Porter does not quite follow that path but it still tastes pretty good"
"Southern Tier Porter is a dark beer, it's pretty much black barring some redness to the sides. As the ounces go down, so does the darkness, leaving the liquid easier to scope through. Barely even a cap, no lace. Where dat be at? Smell is of burnt roast, old licorice, smelly toffee, rotting fruit, I don't like it, I don't know why, I just don't like it. This needs to warm up significantly before any true characteristics come out, and when they did, it did not jive with me. That fruit comes up, it's light like but there, roast mixed with burnt/char, stale vanilla, nuts, chocolate, no coffee. It's a mixed bag, a muffled bag at that. Feel is less than medium, goes down slimy, with a faint bitterness towards the end, needs a kick of carb. Next."
"Very good."
"Overall-ok porter, not great but likeable."
"drinks pretty well. rather refreshing for a porter, which belies its description as robust. A decent beer, but I have had better for the style."
"DB- I certainly like the cocoa flavors here but the cardboard/paper (corn+floral combo?) flavor takes away from the experience. I have also tasted this in the 2xIPA and the IPA."
"Drink - A pretty decent porter, not the best I've ever had but still very drinkable."
"D - Decent but I would prefer something else to be honest. Maybe it's the sweetness or the richness of the coffee and chocolate but I can't see myself enjoying many of these in a row."
"Overall this is very drinkable. The 5.2% is well hidden and I could see having a few of these. This was a stray bottle on a discount rack so I may not have gotten a fresh impression."
"Drinks so easy, a very nice porter. Not great, on the edge IMO. I would happily buy some more"
"A decent porter, nothing to write home about, but good non-the-less."
"D - were the flavor a little deeper I could drink this all night, as it is there are a lot more that I would rather have."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of tan head. It is a dark brown beer with garnet highlights. The aroma is sweet with dark chocolate. The taste is similar with the addition of some coffee on the finish. The mouthfeel is a little weak, but it is a very drinkable beer. I have yet to meet a porter that I haven't found tolerable."
"Singled purchased at the liquor store. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark brown color with an average sized head. Smell really had a nice roasted coffee scent to it. Taste was quite good, as I really enjoyed the dark bittersweet chocolate aspect of this beer's flavor. Also had a smooth dark maltiness to it. Mouthfeel was on the thin side but by no means was it watery. This porter was smooth enough to be an easy drinker. This is a straight up, nothing fancy porter than shows ST can make just as good a beer for a six pack as they can for their 22 oz bottled specialties."
"Pours a dark brown with a light brown head. Not much retention, decent lacing. Aroma is of chocolate, hops and a bit of alcohol. Flavor starts with a bit of a bite of bitter, earthy hops. Unsweetened chocolate and roasted coffee malt finish off the brew. A pretty standard porter flavor profile, nothing really stands out as good or bad. Medium bodied and goes down pretty easy."
"All in all, nope, avoid this brew. Not worth your time or money no matter what. Hunt Chocolate or Unearthy instead. Avoid."
"Decent beer, and certainly drinkable. Southern Tier is such an awesome brewery, though, its almost unfair to compare this ""merely"" decent beer against their other truly tasty offerings."
"Flavor is quite good, full, sweet, balanced by a substantial bitterness - both from hops and a little from charred malt - which builds on the palate. A mild astringency is keeping it from an elite score. The char shows up much more in the flavor than aroma. Body is barely medium but creamy, carbonation soft - more would be too much with the bitterness/astringency of the hop/malt bill. All in all it is a solid porter that I'd have again. Seems to be somewhere between the brown and robust styles. recommended."
"London porter meets US Micro process and dry hopping....satisfying, drinkable not too filling."
"D: This is a solid lower ABV porter. If you can find it, give it a shot."
"Drinkability: Delightfully drinkable! Not a bad choice for a regular go-to porter."
"Pours very dark bown with reddish tinge. The 1-inch off-white head dissapted quickly but left nice lacing throughout. Nose is nutty and sweet. Good and appropriate carbonation. Even though this has a fairly thin mouthfeel, the taste is substantive. There is brown sugar, roasted nuts, coffee and cocoa supported well by the malt backbone. The finish shows some mild hoppy bitterness which was a nice surprise. I would have this again for sure."
"Drinkability is pretty good. No alcohol, just nothing really outstanding to make you want to drink more. It's slightly above average, but just kind of meh, their bigger beers are definetely much better."
"D-Nice porter, though on the lower end of the American style. nice caramel and roast balance. Aroma was a bit lacking. I'd drink this again."
"Thinner body than I expected. A little watery. It's an easy drinker, but it's not much of a fun one."
"D - It's an easy drinker I suppose, but the experience is bad enough to keep you from wanting to drink it."
"Overall, another ST to run from. The aroma just crushes this."
"Overall, I find this one to be a little mild for my taste. It's missing out on the big roasted/charred flavors you'd expect from a porter."
"Overall: Very good porter, with hints of chocolate, roasted malts, and slight coffee after taste. If you like dark porters, then you will definitly like this one."
"Overall Impression: A little too much roasted flavor that is not balanced out by the malt. Also too thin for my liking. It's a decent Porter, and decent value. Give it a shot."
"At 5.20% ABV, a few of these can be downed in a setting. That doesn't mean that this is worth buying a 6-pack of. One attempt to try this would suffice but if I had it again, I'd pair a thick cheese or some tough meat with this in order to fill me up. This doesn't cut it and I'd hope that Southern Tier can give this a more rye-like consistency in a future brewing of this."
"This is great beer. Plus, I like the fact that it's semi-local. I can tell that it's fairly fresh."
"The taste is a little watery. It has a distinctive smokiness flavor to it with coffee, more nut, roasted malt. The mouthfeel, like I said, is a bit watery. Maybe I was expecting the body of a stout? Regardless, still really good."
"thin and a good amount of carbination for a porter, drinks easily because of how thin it is."
"D: For a porter, I've got to say it's probably one of my favourites. As a beer it's not that highly ranked. It's also priced quite high. For what it's worth though, It's a sessional beer and if I were into porters I would love it."
"A nice porter, hoppier than expected, and a good cap to the evening."
"This is not a terrible beer, but I wouldn't go as far as to call it good. I didn't see a born on or best by date on the bottle so it's possible I got an old batch but I don't believe this is that old since it even has the new label on it and I bought it pretty recently."
"This was the first porter I've ever tried. I have since had ones that were way better. I would say that this was a pretty average one."
"again I'm thanking adil for sending this one my way, yet another brewery not available in my part of the world. for a session beer this ones decent for this cold winter night"
"Overall a good porter. Tasty stuff however the winner for me in this beer was the smell. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Good sessionable porter. Lightweight and not filling at all so you can put a 6er of this back no problem. Worth a try, but dont go out of your way for this."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer has a nice level of carbonation and the bubbles dance across your tongue. A guy could be temped to drink a few of these while watching sports."
"Quite subdued as porters go, but real easy to drink."
"I can't say I'm really a fan of this porter, too thin in taste and body. I could see others being really into it though, if you're not into thick, flavourful stouts and porters. It does go down pretty easy for a porter but if I'm looking for a beer that goes down easy, I'm not usually going to be drinking a porter. It looks like a porter but if I were blindfolded I would probably say it's a dark ale of some sort by taste alone. I don't think I'll be buying this again."
"Poured a dark brown with a small tan head that disappeared quickly. Moderate lacing on the glass. Aroma has flavors of roasted grains with some chocolate and coffee notes. Taste is sweet at first but the bitter flavors of coffee and chocolate come through at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodies and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, this is a nice easy drinking porter. Nothing outstanding or over the top with this one but it's a good easy drinking flavorful porter."
"Overall- A good sessionable porter. Worthy of a few pints."
"D - This is a good porter. It is very easy drinking and makes a great session brew."
"A very drinkable porter, not my favourite, but certainly one I'll happily purchase again. Great stuff!"
"D - Drinks very easily. This is a good full-bodied, yet sessionable porter."
"The beer color is black, pretty dark too. No head, bummer. The aroma is light intensity, which, for me, is unusual for Southern Tier. I'm having a hard time distinguishing everything in the smell. I get light notes of chocolate, but beside this... dah dah. Taste is roasted malts. The beer feels thin in the mouth, and the carbonation is very present. A little bit too simplistic for me... or am I becoming more snobby. Good to drink for no special occasion, however it is definitely not a special occasion beer. I think I wished I would have had more from this one... oh well... life is cruel! Decent beer, but nothing else."
"This is a nice session porter, well balanced with the slight acidic sourness one looks for in the style."
"Starts watery and smooth with a mild courseness with the bitter finish. Low carbonation as a porter usually goes (and is not my personal favourite character)"
"Southern Tier Porter pours a clear red black with almost no head, despite the vigorous pour. The aroma is inviting, caramel, toffee, and some roasted malt with some delicious herbal hops. The flavor is well balanced, just enough slightly astringent roasted malt to balance the caramel sweetness. The finish is dry and slightly hoppy. Glad to see this one up in Northern Ontario, I have a feeling I will be drinking more of it."
"Mouthfeel is thin but smooth. Carbonation just right and the whole thing goes down ridiculously well. Nice to see the LCBO bringing in something enjoyable."
"Overall, this is a damn good session beer. Rogue, Sierra Nevada, and Great Divide make better renditions of the style, but this has most of the features that I like in a porter. It's certainly more flavourful than many Canadian beers and I'm glad that the LCBO is offering it. Recommended."
"A ruby dark beer. It smells of a fresh brewed pot of coffee in a pine forest. You can feel that lake breeze at the break of day. A winner. Tastes of chocolate, coffee and toast. Strangely or not the hops are distinct in this porter and float near the surface (taste wise not literally!). I'm a fan."
"Clear, but dark ruby red, with a 3/4 inch tan head of moderate heft. Nose is dark caramel and fruit with hints of black cherry. Some coffee and dark berries on the first sip. Decent bitterness and some herbal hops in the finish. Burnt, dark sugars and a bit of a sweet edge also come through. Fairly smooth mouthfeel with a moderate carbonated zip. Quite easy drinking."
"Taste-Roasted coffee, subtle smokiness, dark chocolate-Easy drinking, this would be a fine everyday porter to keep in your fridge"
"12oz bottle. Pours pure black, but light in body. Pretty bland flavour to be honest, but I am new to Porters and the Stouts. Definately easy to drink, but this isn't anything special. This had no personality to me. Won't be on my shopping list again."
"Overall, seems like a decent offering from Southern Tier. Being my first American porter, the difference in the taste and mouthfeel was very noticeable in comparison to other English porters I've had. I think I prefer Fuller's over this, but still a nice fall beer."
"Not quite what I'd expect from an American porter , but very easy to drink."
"D: Its drinkable, but not a goto porter by any means. Getting closer boys and girls...."
"Out of a 12 ounce bottle and into my shaker glass. The porter appears a translucent deep brown color with about a finger of fizzy tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate, mild coffee and mocha, caramel, grassy hops. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation levels and a bitter earthy finish. Worth a try."
"Pretty smooth mouthfeel, but not very thick. All in all this is a very drinkable porter and a very good representation of the style, if you like coffee."
"Pours a dark brown color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, and alcohol. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, alcohol, and sweet malt. Overall, the alcohol flavor is surprisingly strong for the low ABV level and hinders the other flavors."
"Tasty. Very drinkable. The only knock I can give this beer is that I wish it was a bit more roasty but that's just a personal preference."
"Drinkability: Looks great, smells great, tastes horrible. The worst offering I've tried from Southern Tier...will never purchase again."
"Light bodied and thin, with a very smooth carbonation. This beer might be a very good take at an English porter, I'm not sure its necessarily 'American'"
"AS it warms you get more of that medicinal/vegetal/metallic offness - not so yummy."
"It's not really stunner of a porter and why, after a strong start with the IPA, does the LCBO seem to keep bringing in Southern Tier's weakest offerings?"
"Pours a clear dark ruby red, almost mahogany, definitely not black, thick tan head forms, slowly settles down to a medium ring and layer around the glass, some lace spirals stick to the glass. Smell is weird, very earthy, some caramel and light roastiness, chocolate wafers, kind of dry and toast, a bit of light fruitiness and bready malts, not much of a porter. Taste is a little better, nice chocolate and caramel maltiness, light roast, good bit of dark fruit, berries and raisins, very strange medicinal/iron flavour thats doesn't quite sit right, kind of sharp and bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Not a very good beer and a crappy porter."
"T Well this is a ""straight up"" porter and by that I mean that it delivers on everything a porter should be with dark roasted malts, some smoothness and even some dark chocolate tastes. It is carefully brewed and satisfying for a basic porter. I do enjoy the tinge of chocolate that I was not expecting at the outset. It makes it an enjoyable porter."
"A very nice drinker, surprisingly so given the strong flavour profile."
"Decent porter."
"It's very drinkable, in general. As a representation of the style though, it falls a little flat and I'd rather have something else."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a bubbly off white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells of milk chocolate, some citrus hops, slight roasty aroma as well as a slight alcohol nose. The aroma reminds a little of chokolat only on a smaller scale. There's a slight phenolic in the nose I pick up once or twice. Taste is a straightforward porter with a fairly dry finish. Lots of chocolate and roast flavor. Slight citrus hop bitterness tries to find a voice, but never manages to get through the roasty malts. A touch of alcohol in there as well. Creamy/oily mouthfeel, medium carbonation, medium to thin body. I really enjoyed this one. Great sessionable Porter."
"D: If you like coffee, very drinkable. If not, not so much."
"D: It goes down very easy due to its smooth feel and low ABV."
"Pours a brown reddish color with a one finger head. The smell is of roasted malt and a little earthy hop hidden in there. The taste is of roasted malt and maybe some caramel in there as well. Not as malty as other porters. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. Overall it is an average porter it is drinkable but nothing great."
"D: Drinkable, yes. Good taste, yeah. Boring, maybe."
"OVERALL: A solid brew to be sure. Nothing overly special going on here, but a good example of what an American porter has to offer. Definitely a drinkable brew I'll re-visit sometime in the near future."
"D: A nice sessionable porter to have on hand for a late night evening of cards around the campfire. Would pair well with Devil's Food Cake or a tray of smoked cheese and crackers."
"This beer poured a nice deep dark brown with ruby high lights when held to the light. Roughly a one finger of foamy tan head capped this beer, relatively decent retention and left wispy lacing on the glass the whole way down. The coffee notes in the nose are outstanding, mixed with some chocolate and nice deep roasted malts. Taste is inline with the nose - coffee flavoring first, nice bitterness blending in with chocolate - dark bitter chocolate, roasted malts come through to give a nice toasty flavoring and in the finish - the most surprising, but I detected a bit of fruitiness raspberry or blackberry hit the tongue just in the finish. Mouthfeel is very thin, medium to higher carbonation, touch of creaminess but the thinness in the body is very apparent. This is a highly drinkable beer, and by far a sessionable beer."
"D: A very good porter that will find its way into my fridge this fall and winter. It has a good balance of dark malt and hops without either being to overwhelming. I have had some better porters lately (Founders, Berkshire Drayman's) but this one is very good."
"The beer poured our of the bottle to yeild a very poor head and a mildly sweet chocolate aroma. It was very dark brown in color. The mouthfeel was fairly thin. The taste very mild and moderately sweet. I found this beer to be OK, but didn't really see any reason to drink it over the many porters available. It could use a little more body."
"Easy to drink and could see having it if its around but nothing I would reach for over alot of other options for a porter"
"From a sampler 12-pack, poured a short glass from 12 oz bottle into tumbler. Pours nearly opaque with almost no head, any white foam disappears immediately. The smell of this beer is the strongest recommendation for it, with a burnt-coffee, almost chocolatey aroma. Considering how heavy this beer looks and smells, it has a light mouthfeel with a tongue-clearing carbonation bite which I really liked. Probably best porter I've tried in months (on first taste)."
"d- very good for a porter"
"Mouth is a bit too overcarbonated and is a bit thinner than most but by a hair. Drinks easy and is a really typical american porter Overall good but nothing special or spectacular."
"Drinkability: This is my favorite from the brewery so far. This was the mystery beer in the sampler pack I picked up. This is a tasty brew and I will look for it."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - I recommend this porter for the beginning porter drinker. Definitely not the best in already stellar lineup from Southern Tier but a solid example of the style."
"D Fair to good. This is one of the more drinkable porters, not a style that lends itself tremendously to high drinkability."
"I poured this beer straight into a pint glass and a very, very thin head formed, which dissipated rather quickly. I caught a subtle coffee and malt smell right off the bat. The body is an extremely dark brown because of the roasted malts. The taste of the porter has a combination of chocolate, coffee, and malt. Very well-balanced. It is not as thick as other porters that I have tried, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It means I can probably have more than one of these and not feel completely full."
"D - This would be alright to have a few beers as it doesn't have any overwhelming flavor, but if I wanted a Porter I'd go elsewhere."
"Taste kicks back with more roastiness and a semi-sweet finish. Very thin though and lacks body. Slightly bitter/salty and I don't think the hops fit the porter very well. I think a porter should be creamy and dark, but the hops add a sort of awkward bitterness to it."
"Not a bad porter, kind of had that northeast feel to it. It almost tasted more like a stout than a porter. very drinkable!"
"Very dark cola appearance; in bright sunlight, I can just barely make out the outline of my fingers on the other side of the glass. Tan head rose and fell leaving minor lacing and a ring. Smell of brownies, dark rye bread, roast malt. Taste is also of roast malt, mild coffee flavour, with a smooth texture in the mouth and medium bitterness. I found this beer nicely balanced with dryness and astringency held in check. With Southern Tier, I've come to expect good quality to excellent beer and this is certainly a very good porter, although not in the same league as some of their other offerings. Having said that, anything from this brewery is well worth having in your fridge, too bad it's not widely available in Ontario, I picked this up from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo."
"D: very drinkable porter, just kinda boring."
"I'd say try it and see if it might be a good beer to have on hand to cleanse your taste buds for the next great beer."
"much more like a stout than a porter to me pours very dark with a quarter inch head and a fair amount of lace that sticks around. slightly smoky burnt malt nose. slight coffee dark burnt malt not as sweet as a regular porter and slightly dry finish. light to medium body and carbonation is good. one of southern tier,s better beers."
"Drinkability. I would give it fair marks here - a nice beverage overall that won't knock you out and has a great taste. Southern Tier has yet to fail me."
"Drinkability with it being so water-like it was so very easy to drink and would be easy to session"
"Drinkability: it's a decently tasty porter and is slightly filling. I could only drink one."
"I doubt I'd drink more than one of these... Unless I was desperate."
"Eh, not the best beer I've had from them for sure, but it's still a decent choice. That said, there's so many others I like better, and I'll be sticking with those."
"Great looking pour, big head, nice lacing. Some chocolatey malts with a nice nutty goodness. A bit metallic, however. A nice porter though, nonetheless with some boldness and maybe some figs. A bit sweet on the nose, some nice bitterness on the back end. A dry finish, maybe a bit unrefined. Worth a shot."
"(first tasting, Apr 19, 2008) Southern Tier Porter is a dim, dark red ale adorned with an eggy beige head with oily bubbles that stays put and crusts up on the glass. Very handsome. The aroma is muted, grainy, roasty, fresh and dry. It if full bodied and fluffy in the mouth. The finish starts with a sharp bitter snap and then turns silty and dry. The flavor is quite well balanced. It doesn't lean toward coffee or chocolate; it's just dark roasted malt here. The end of the taste gets alkaline. The hops kick in to bring me grassiness and set the malt on a spin toward salmiakki. This is an ideal porter."
"Medium brown hue with ruby highlights. Very speedy film of foam after the pour that diminishes to nothing quickly. Good roasted malt araom has notes of faint crushed mint hops and medium brownie. Great roasted flavors i thi beer. Sessionale brownies, a little coffee and dark chocolate. Good session beer. Southern Tier needs to put this porter in six-packs for IL."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in an English pint glass. This beer poured a sleek, near-black with some mahogany highlights around the edges of the glass. A thin head of tan foam quickly faded away, leaving little lace. The aroma included freshly gound coffee, milk chocolate, and some caramel. Mildly roasty. The flavor contained some moderately bitter coffee and roasted malt, along with a balancing hop bite. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied and had light to moderate carbonation. Not bad. A pretty standard porter."
"The mouthfeel is just right for the style. Any fuller body and I'd feel like I were drinking a stout. But this is medium bodied with crisp carbonation. Very drinkable and right up my alley. A nice example of an American Porter."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer poureda really dark black rich looking brew with a tan creamy head. The head decayed really fast though and was gone by the second chug. The smell of the beer was slighly sour which worried me there for a minute. But upon tasting the beer had a nice dark roasted coffee taste that was quite good. I will uy again."
"D: This is a drinkable beer. It goes down easy and has a nice quality about it."
"Tasted on 11/30/08."
"D- Decent beer, no bells and whistles, just middle of the road."
"Overall good, but not great. Complexity is decent, but the flavor is a bit on the weak side. I could drink a few with no problem, but there are better choices for the $$$."
"A pretty nice porter from the folks at Southern Tier. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"This is an American porter with a rich, pretty complex, maltiness with an American bitter touch and roastiness. Nicely balanced. A delcious porter!"
"Drink ability- Not the best porter I have had but good flavor and goes down very easy."
"The taste is where it's at on this one. Great roasty flavors with just a slight acidic quality that pops up close to the finish occassionally. light coffee notes. Not very chocolatey, but it's there. The mouthfeel is pretty solid and the drinkability high. This is a really good example of a porter."
"D: I think one or two in one sitting is the most I'd do. Its good, but not really sessionable."
"Drinkability: An average to slightly above-average porter. Nothing wrong with it but nothing outstanding either. Alcohol is, of course, just fine, and though I'd try it again if offered, it's not particularly outstanding enough to make me seek it out again."
"M + D: A lighter body, with a touch of creaminess in there for good measure. Not the most extraordinary feeling, but not too bad and accessible. It could potentially be a nice session choice, though I think that, personally, it would be one of those ""Oh, I haven't had that in a while"" kind of choices."
"Drinkability is pretty good. The light mouthfeel that I see as a weak point might translate as making this more of a light session beer."
"Drinkability - one of the better porters I've had in a while. More a colder weather kind of beer, I bet it's be good with some ribs or anything off the grill."
"Dark brown body with a substantial tan coloured head. More or less a textbook appearance. Coffee and chocolate in the aroma, as well as some hops. Roasted malt flavours dominate the front of the sip, transcending through some bitter chocolate to a hoppy finish. Smooth on the palate, but perhaps a little too thin for my tastes. Solid drinkability."
"Out of a mixed twelve pack (also a road trip acquisition) I discovered this NY state gem. Poured out of the bottle a dark, near black brown like Coca Cola complete with reddish hues on the meniscus. Thin tan head unfortunately did not lace much nor retain well. Understated aromas of milk chocolate, sweetened coffee and liquid smoke. Flavors were dominated by coffee, milk chocolate chips (y'know, the Nestle kind!), biscuity malt and some weak hops. Slightly woody like oak and a little nutty as well. Long chocolate finish. Medium/light carbonation and a good but not great mouthfeel. Very sessionable for a porter but not great for New England standards."
"Southern Tier's Porter Dark (as oppose to ""porter light""?) is a less than spectacular beer from an otherwise spectacular brewery. It is an average porter and if you are someone getting into craft beer or beginning to explore dark beers than this is a great place to start. Do it, come on over, join the dark side!"
"The carbonation is a bit high for my expectation of a porter. There's an average, mildly watery mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable as it's totally inoffensive."
"I've had better porters but this isn't bad. Drinkability is good but I don't think I'll find my way back to this one."
"Overall, this is a decent American Porter that is worth trying."
"While clearly heading south (better check those bottling lines) the sourness and touch of funk seems to work for the most part in this beer. I am actually enjoying the beer, this is something a bit like I would imagine a blended Porter would be like; young fresh beer blended with old, funky brew to create a more complex, yet still quaffable product. Should I even be encouraging the brewery to clean up their QC regimen cause this isn't half bad."
"Notes: Drinkable and full of flavor, nice!"
"Their special big beers have bold tastes, I wished these ones did too. Still, strong like bull."
"Overall... great example of porter, sweet, not too dry... would definitely buy again."
"D- A good offering but not one that sparks my interest terribly much."
"Drinkability- The bottle is much smoother than the tap which tastes much different. This beer was somewhat cool, but not worth more visits on this handle."
"Some so-so qualities and some very good qualities. But it's the flavor that counts, and I'm not surprised Southern Tier pulls through again on that front. They need to do a Baltic Porter."
"Drinkability: Very good porter. The good aspects of the style are at the forefront and there is a good hop flavor as well. Recommended."
"picked up their sampler pack, this was actually the 3rd. in my line-up ; pours a deep orangish-brown w/ a thin creamy tan cap which left a fair amount of lacing in my nonic ; a moderate smell, a sweet darker grain smell, a bit like coffee & toast, a faint piney hop note in there as well ; a rich dry, nutty flavor from the onset, a slightly sour note to it as well, some darker fruits and touch of alcohol in the finish ; light-med bodied w/ a creaminess that was surprising, a decent co2 level prob. helps ; a very drinkable brew, prob. in the top 5 Am. porters i've had..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is very good. Nice and smooth. I find it to be very drinkable. Taking down a number of these would not be difficult. Overall, it's a very good porter. Definitely worth checking out."
"Pours a dark brown color, too much carbonation, huge foamy tan head, lots of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty with some caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose. Medium body. Drinkable, way too much head on this one, tells me that something is wrong in the bottling, so not really impressed with this one."
"Overall: Not my favorite ST, brew or my favorite porter. It could use a little more malty goodness and body. Too flat and watery for me."
"Pours a really dark brown/black with a tall and medium light tan colored head. It has a really nice aroma of dark roasted malts and hints of sweet chocolate in the aroma. The taste is excellent for a porter. Deep roasted malts layered with some really nice chocolate aftertaste. It is a really smooth and fresh tasting porter. The drinkability is very good as I would have a few of these before the night is over. It is a really good porter and I recommend trying this one."
"The really am displeased with the taste of this. I've had other Southern Tier products and liked all of them (especially their barley wine) so this was a let down. The hopes are extremely up front and is the first and last thing you taste. Very little roasted malt flavor and the aftertaste has a bit of a soapy taste to it."
"A very avergae porter. This particular bottle has a different label than what's pictured. Mine is black and purple with white and silver writing. Anyway, poured a very dark reddish brown with a khaki coloured head that vanished in about 20 seconds or so. Smell was dark malts with a touch of hops hiding in the back. Taste was neither too sweet, nor too bitter; very pleasant. Some roasted flavours present, although rather subtle. Mouthfeel was very average, as was most everything else about this porter. Certainly not a bad beer, just very average. Thanks to Ding for the chance to try this."
"Pours pitch black. Tan head that falls fairly quickly. Sickly sweet nose that has some borderline molasses characters to it. Gets dusty after a bit. Flavor is thick with malts, but not complex I would say. It is just robust, deep, and very thick. Nice malty characters just abound on this one. Feel is pretty thick on the liquid and low on the carbonation it seems. Very drinkable porter indeed. No wild flavor profiles here, just a nice smooth deep one."
"Bottle courtesy of Jerc: Poured a clear black color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter roasted malt is somewhat average. Taste is also dominated by medium bitter notes from roasted malt with some light sweetness and some notes of black chocolate. Body is about average with some medium carbonation. Easily drinkable porter with some limited complexity."
"Nice and smooth in the mouth, good body yet not filling. I could drink a few of these. This would pair up nicely with a nice smokey chipotle."
"Overall: Thanks HimerMan for this beer. It is good. Sometimes I drink a porter, and it is just so boring. This one is good and flavorfull."
"On draught at Kennedys On The Quays. This beer is a dark brown color with a medium light brown head that has decent retention. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of cocoa and milk chocolate along with bits of coffee and malt. Medium, glassy smooth body with sweet chocolate and roasted malt flavor. Very little bitterness. The finish is sweet at first with a mildly bitter hops aftertaste. Lacks robustness that would put it in the ""very good"" category. This is a actually kind of a letdown considering their other beers are solid."
"Very good. Recommended."
"A good porter for sure"
"D - very easy to put back a few of these, not too filling and abv is middle of the road."
"M: Smooth, medium body for a porter, very still, no spice at all, easy to drink. Overall not bad, but it has very little character. Good if you just want a nice and simple porter."
"This makes a very good session beer which is uncharacteristic of porters. I'd give this one a go again."
"A dark brown color, nearly opaque, with hints of red at the bottom of the glass. A beige colored head forms about a quater inch high, but it soon dissolves away. A classic porter fragrance of chocolate and sweet malt, with hints of coffee rounding it out. The taste is reflective of the aroma, the sweet malt and chocolate comes out at the start. Then the flavor of coffee comes through, it finishes with slight bit of bitterness at the end. A bit watery at the start, but, it gradually gains weight as it rolls to the back of the palate. This is a very good porter, it brings back memories of being in a pub in London."
"Overall, a pretty standard porter. Well worth a try."
"D- A decent porter. Doesn't blow me away by any means, but good nonetheless."
"Overall, a quaint light bodied porter that should satisfy the heavy beer drinker on a hot summer day."
"This a solid porter with plenty of roasted flavor."
"An aroma that will get your taste buds turning. Thick maltiness with each whiff. The first mouthful struck me as surprisingly mild, but with an immediate charcoal quality that spreads right to the back of your mouth and down the gullet with ease. This struck me as a very drinkable, year round sort of brew. It has that chewiness of a good porter but not the strength of most, which suits my tastes very well. Smooth, easy drinking, flavorful."
"Overally pretty drinkable as a session type beer. Nothing overly noteworthy but a good offering nonetheless."
"Decent body, but a bit overcarbonated. Pretty easy to drink, but not overly exciting."
"Bone dry, roasty, burnt malts with hints of coffee and bitter chocolate. Not much in the way of fruit a bit of anise. Mouth is medium too full with a what I think is too much carbonation. Lacking complexity. An average beer at best."
"drikability is decently balanced flavors and the semi-thin body make this a fairly easy drinker."
"Pouring from a chilled bottle into a pint glass, it pours a very dark brown (pretty) color with a hefty 2 fingers of tan dense head. Head retention is quite impressive and it leaves a bit of lacing on the glass as it DOES dissipate a bit. Solid aroma. Dark roasted almond aroma along with some coffee and chocolate as well. Very nice. Some floral hops also on the nose, which help balance it out nicely. Sipping reveals a rather light body with a mild carbonation and light roasty malt flavor. A bit of baker's chocolate tasted up front as well and some roasted almonds. This one packs a punch with flavor on the finish really, which is rather odd to me. It finishes with a rush of toasted chocolate bitterness and a bit of hops on the tongue. Very interesting. Easily a session brew. If available on tap, I'd drink this over many other brews. I truly enjoyed it."
"This stuff is solid and tasty but the watery mouthful brings it down in points.Ide buy it again and try it when my palate has evolved."
"It's thick and bitter. Remains on the tongue for a while. Becomes a bit more milky as it warms up. Because of it's strong malt/coffee bitterness, might be tough to repeat. But it's a solid porter and nice after something very hoppy."
"The color and consistency of a porter were there but the smell was a bit odd. The smell reminded me of soy sauce or perhaps raisins. There was harshness to the taste as well, something like burnt coffee as opposed to the nice roasted coffee flavor common to porters . Just didn't care for this porter."
"I'm a big fan of porters and I can't say I'm too impressed. The flavor reminded me of cushed grains and wort. It wasn't a grainy flavor so much as dusty grains. There was still a nice chocolate aroma and creamy mouthfeel, but the flavor fell flat."
"Again, Southern Tier hits home with a clean, crisp brew. Even with Porters, they make brewing easy. Good malty character, mixed with light yeasty esters, toasty, coffee, and a touch of cocoa. Very well balanced so that no character dominates the others. A sturdy hop addition of American 'C' hops add a bitter balance, piney flavors, and aromas of fresh-cut grass. The feel is as silky smooth as any porter anywhere. Malty textures without any residual sugars lingering on the palate. Finishes very clean and crisply malty; dangerously drinkable. This beer could easily become the epidome for the American Porter. Thanks Steve!"
"A quality porter that i could probably session on occassion if need be."
"Notes: all in all a solid if non-spectacular offering from Southern Tier. I expected a heavier body, some more flavor (the menu at the bar said there were hints of vanilla, but I couldn't find any) and a stronger nose. But this is a decent porter."
"Overall a very drinkable porter. A good example of the style and very sessionable."
"12 oz bottle. The beer fills the glass a deep brown color with dark amber highlites at the bottom and edges of the brew. There is very little head, barely a film over top. Only a few bubbles are seen hitting the surface. The aroma is a little light. I get some moderate roasted grainey notes, with a solid nuttyness, along with a solid caramel sweetness. I just wish this was a little more forceful in the aroma. The flavor is right on with the flavor. Lots of roasted maltyness, followed by a mild caramel and nuttyness. It finishes with a nice sweet coffee on the finish that really takes this one higher than it would be without it. There is just a mild hint at bitterness on the finish that works really well with the coffee flavors. This is a nice tasting brew. Mouthfeel shows as thick with a light carbonation. This one is not quite chewy, but definately thick. As far as things go, I think this is a nice porter. I think the nuttyness is a little misplaced in it, but it is well rounded and tasty. I'm glad to have it in my glass."
"D: Very tasty, not as filling as you would expect a porter to be, goes down very easily, one of the better porters that I’ve had."
"Thanks to the McHugh family for this, the last of my Southern Tier beers!"
"This is the fist Southern Tier offering that has left me wanting. I guess I was due to find a beer from them that doesn't appeal to me."
"D- Nice on a cold night before bed with some walnuts or something."
"Pours black but has a burgundy hue when held to the light. Tan head that slowly to pools of various sized bubbles. Sweet smoked malts, molasses, prunes, and vanilla in the nose. The first taste smokey and sweet with roasted barley, crisp, slightly tart, balance well with a good hop addition. Roasted coffee, and a dry charcoal expression in the back palate. Some buttery caramel characters also. Light carbonation and thick body. The finish is of dry crackers, smokey, chary, and has a nice cloying in the mouth."
"D - I was very disappointed in this one. With so many good porters available I doubt I will find myself trying this one again."
"That peppery flavor is somewhat of a nice/interesting touch, but not enough to keep me coming back."
"Not too heavy or alcoholic to drink, but lacks the complex flavor that makes one want to drink another. I often buy the Southern Tier sampler pack, and these are always the last three to be grabbed, paling in comparison to the Phin and Matt's and the Pale Ale."
"Taste is good upfront dark rich malts. Some elements of brown sugar. Nice but a little thin. Mouthfeel does have some stickiness--nothing to detract much though. Pretty drinkable for the style."
"D: Eh. It's OK, but it's not something I'd ever crave, as it's not bold enough or strong enough to satisfy the dark beer cravings. It's got a good roasty character, maybe a bit too burned at the end, but OK. As part of a mixed twelve pack, I'm glad it's there, but it's not something I'd ever seek out on its own."
"D-The decently balanced flavors and the semi-thin body make this a fairly easy drinker."
"Pours a very dark mahogany-brown, nearly black- with deep ruby highlights and decent clarity. One finger biege head, lacking retention and spotty lacing. Nice burnt malt and cocoa bouquet with a hint of hops. Roasted barley and charred crystal sweetness upfront, followed by baker's chocolate and a touch of coffee grounds. Robust herbal hop flavor drys the aftertaste and balances very well. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated with a silky mouthfeel that has texture without being heavy, yet very drinkable without being thin. Finishes dry and slightly hoppy - but with a rich residual coffee/roasted flavor. A great Porter for hopheads."
"This was a fairly dull porter. The head pours a creamy tan and there is a nice lacing. After that, I smell a subdued maltiness and nearly no hops. The taste is good, but the flavors are very dry and hard to pin point. Mouthfeel is quite thin. Drinkability is okay. There is just nothing outstanding about this porter."
"Cheers!"
"Body is barely above light and could use some beefing up. Texture and mouthfeel are chewy and smooth, almost creamy. Light body makes it drink like a lighter style, but with the dark roasty flavors of a porter. Porter light?"
"Very good, somewhat strong beer. It is black/ruby in color with virtually no head. No lacing to speak of either on the glass. The smell is strong with hints of chocolate, coffee, wood, and alcohol. The taste is very good -- strong alcohol taste, even though it only has a 5.2ABV. The mouthfeel is OK, and for a porter, the drinkability is good. Could have a few of these in one sitting, but then it would be on to something a bit lighter."
"Overall, a decent beer, although it lacks the punch and depth of other porters."
"Undated bottle. Poured a dark brown, nearly black in the glass, with a small creamy tan head, and left a little lacing. The smell was predominantly a dark, roasted coffee aroma. Tastewise it was a bit thin. The dark malty flavors came through, like any decent porter, with the bitter finish, but overall there wasn't anything too substantial there. In the mouth it felt a little watery. Overall, it was easy to drink but only because of what it seemed to be lacking. This porter went to head-to-head with Bell's Porter and the Edmund Fitzgerald, and was a clear third-place finisher. I'll stick with the others."
"Black in color with a slight carmel brown head. Smells of hops and malt. A bit sweet in smell. Hops come first. The taste is sweet and malty. A bit of a bitter finish. A good beer. Very drinkable. Good lacing on glass. Taste a bit of the alcohol as an aftertaste."
"I wouldn't drink this beer again, but if you are a porter fan, I am sure you will find more to like about it then I did."
"This is a better than average Porter. A little more body would make this one superior."
"Good balance, chocolate malts, very drinkable. Some chocolate and coffee aroma. Taste: Neither overly sweet nor bitter. Black colour, not much head. Some hop bitterness, assertive carbonation.. Middle mouthfeel. Decent porter.ppreciate the lower ABV."
"Bottom Line: Bland boring and watery,"
"Drinkability: Porters aren't usually high on my session beer list, as they don't hold my interest for too long, but I could knock a couple of these back without longing for something else."
"The color is as dark brown as you get without being black. There's moderate lacing and there was only a little bit of head, which disappeared quickly."
"Pours basically a black color with minimum head. Aroma of toasted chocolate malt. Taste is smooth, creamy with overtones of cocoa and charred malt. A rather enjoyable Porter and easy to drink. I got these in a mix pack of Southern Tier and I've found all of their beers to be quite drinkable."
"A dark brown beer with mahogony highlights. Has a big foamy light brown head and a little bit of lace. The aroma starts out with a strong coffee character. Followed by a nice chocolate note. A roasted malt bitterness smoothly covers your tongue with bittersweet chocolate notes and a hint of charcoal."
"No visible date on the bottle, but it does inform you that the contents are dark. Indeed, it pours a very dark brown, almost black. There are ruby highlights at the bottom of the glass. There is a very thin tan head that fades quickly to a film. The nose is full of smooth and soft dark malts, which combine to impart a chocolatey aroma with a nice malt backbone. There are no hops discernible. The taste is very smooth. Chocolate undertones with an almost nutty aspect. Not much of a hop presence. It has a fairly nice malty base going on. The first real misstep is in the finish where there is a noticeable metallic element. Other than that, this is a fairly nice, if a bit simple, porter. The mouthfeel is appropriate. The drinkability is good, but would be better without the metallic bit in the finish. I enjoyed this offering."
"Aroma is full of chocolate malt, cream and miniscule hints of vanilla. Deep black with a thumb thick tan head. Fore is roasty chocolate malts, cocoa, sweet cream, light coffee notes and a hint of nougat. Very nice mouthfeel that is perfectly to syle. A well done porter."
"Dark brown with slightly garnet see-thru highlights. Cola-like carbonation and a thin beige foam cap, somewhat sticky lacing. Roasted malt aromas with a sweet, burnt chocolate predominating. A few hops show up as well. These hops are much more present in the taste, and it's a less than pleasant experience at first: mostly grassy earthy flavors over a thin-to-medium-bodied chocolate and roasted coffee malt base. Mouthfeel is much waterier than I care for. The aftertaste is the most characteristically ""porter-like"" aspect, revealing the balance of malt and hops that the actual taste doesn't achieve. Not my favorite from Southern Tier."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: This is a good, solid porter  dont see enough of these anymore. Could use a little more body. Gonna have to keep an eye out for Southern Tier brews from now on  if this is any indication, the rest of their lineup ought to be pretty darn good as well."
"D: Price/Taste was pretty good, but I'd rather get the Ale from Southern Tier, a lot better in the style."
"Fours, straight up. What can I say? I don't think it typical for a porter to have quite this profile - but it's still good. But, hey, like, what am I talking about? Well. Uh. Beer. What are you talking about? Anyway, yeah. Southern Tier Porter. Nice. Looks like a good porter. Smells like a good porter. Tastes close to a porter with perhaps a little more emphasis on the caramel flavors and a touch less of the chocolate and coffee. Nicely sweet and with a slightly heavier body than typical, as well. Good stuff!"
"Drinkability is fine. I'd easily suck down a few more if I had them on hand... but there's other porters I'll pick up over this one next time."
"Black brew, tinges of red when held up to the light. Thin head, off white color. Smell is smoky, malty, light hops. Taste is good, slightly smokey, sweet, mild hops after inital taste. Mouthfeel of this beer is thick and malty. Very nice. I think this brew is definitely drinkable and wish I had another."
"Drinkability: great. This bottle was nice and fresh, and I wish I picked up more than a sixpack of this stuff."
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable beer. The lightness of the beer helps the smokey charred flavors go down."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable. Perfect with the snowy weather. I picked up the STBC sampler pack. This is a fine brewery and I look forward to trying/reviewing their other beers."
"Pours a dark brown with a large creamy head.The smell is a little weak.I could detect some coffee and chocolate,but it's pretty slight.This tastes almost like a chocolate stout.The flavor of chocolate is very pronounced and with a little bit of coffee,make this a very tasty beer indeed.The m/f is a little less than I like in a porter,but not bad.All in all,you really can't go wrong with this beer,if you see it,pick it up."
"This beer poured into the glass leaving a half inch of dirty white foam but left a nice bit of lacing as the beer was consumed. Aroma seemed like sweet black coffee. Color is a very dark brown. Tasted some burnt toast and toffee flavors but didn't leave a lingering after taste like some porters. Felt good and rich going down. A very drinkable, but not quite memorable porter."
"Drinkability: Immensely drinkable, session brew material. Not too heavy, but packed with flavor. Try it."
"Pours a deep brown with some dark orange highlights witha thinner tan head that is gone pretty quickly,aromas are of bittersweet chocolate and roasted nuts and dark roast coffee but doesnt pack a real punch.A very well rounded,flavorful porter here bitter chocolate and coffee hit up front but finishes very earthy and dry in the finish with a big dose of hops.A tad thin but very flavorful and extremely quaffable from a western NY brewery that i really like and plan to visit next spring on a trip to the inlaws."
"This is a constant in my fridge so I had it on tap this evening. The appearance is a deep brown this time with a minimal head. The smell is still of burnt chocolate and carmel. The taste had coffee flavor and hints of chocolate but seemed bitterer than out of the bottle. The mouthfeel is still nice and smooth with light carbonation and even though with the extra bitterness its still a highly drinkable beer. Perhaps it was a fluke thing. Who knows. Either way this is still a top porter on my list."
"Overall, a very drinkable and good beer. A good session beer and one that I would return to from time to time were I able to find it."
"A nice, easy going beer. Not bad, won't rock your world."
"Pours a rich brown. Roasted, creamy smell that is plesant. Good head,and lots of lace. Light to medium mouth feel. Tastes great.Full flavor, with a little bite. Not bitter, and no bad after taste. For a dark beer it's refreshing. You could easily have more than one or two! I liked this beer a lot. Give it a try!"
"dark but clear beer with a brownish ruby hue. thick 1-finger foam with random sized bubbles on the surface. attractive. leaves a spiderweb of lacing in its wake. smell contains mild coffee and lactose notes. bitter flavors are primarily chalky and unfortunately dominant. creamed coffee follows through to the aftertaste, but can only be enjoyed once the beer is long gone down the chute. light body and very noticeably in possession of the same 'southern tier hop/malt profile' that taints the tripel. a mess of a beer, drinkable for its lightness.. as long as you enjoy eating dirt."
"poured a very deep brown color with off-white puffy head. smell is of roasted malt and coffee. Taste is of coffee and roasted malt with dry textures. Aftertaste leaves a nice dryness that beckons for more. A first class brew."
"This one is a highly drinkable porter. If you dig the porters, I highly suggest this one."
"Purchased 3/04 and sampled 8/04 (notes). Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights, very nice. Creamy head is full and carbonation is medium, nice for style. Nose is excellent with roastiness and hints of chocolate. Dry coffee flavor and a chalky mouthfeel. Finish is even more stout like, but is a great brown porter."
"Appears a little lighter and a litter more clear than your typical porter, but still dark brown. Not that all porters have to adhere strictly to the usual style characteristics (dark, malty, robust, to name a few) but this just seemed to come up short in my opinion. Taste had a nice singed malt taste, but there was also an odd rootbeer flavoring that I wasn't interested in. Also, this was way more carbonated than I think a porter should be. Didn't really want to drink more after one. Plenty of better porters out there, but don't forget about the other good brews that Southern Tier puts out."
"Flavor is roasted malt and even a bit of smokiness up front, this gives way to some sweet chocolate and finishes with some coffee mixing with a bit of grassy hops. Slight drying on the finish as well. Overall it is a very easy drinking beer that goes down nicely and is flavorful. A nice porter that I will try again."
"I really like all of the ST brews I have tried to date...keep 'em coming."
"A pretty middle of the road porter. More milky than I'd like or expect from the style."
"As you can tell I liked this beer, which is why I immediately had a second. I'm sure I will sample more in the future, gotta support the local boys!"
"I have had this six pack of southern tier porter laying around for a while now and I finally got a chance to taste. I'm glad i finally did. This is a very nice beer, clean dark classic porter look in the pint.Appearance score took a hit because of packaging, some advocates might disagree with this but I feel that packaging of a product certainley sends a message to the drinker, you drink with your eyes first ,after all.That being said Southern Tier does a poor job with it's labeling, very generic and uninspired. This might be by design ,but I dont think it works .Fortunatley whats inside the bottle more than makes up for uninspired branding.The head could have been a little thicker, but ill take the blame for that, with a crumby pour. I like the balance in the mouth, nice toasty hints, some sweetness, yet clean and not overpowering. southern tier does a good job with their beers, and this one is no exception. I would love to try this on tap, as i am always partial to a pint in a pub on tap, it always seems to improve the overall experience.I would suggest this beer to all, it is a pleasant experience, and i'll be finishing thew six pack soon."
"Barely transparent, black topped with a thick froth of tan head. Great head retention, keeping a thick layer thourhgout, as wel as leaving a speckling of lace clinging to the glass. The aroma gives forth tons of roasted, charred malt, citric hops, and coffee. Pretty celan, only mild amounts of esters, with heaps of chocolate and blackened malt. The flavor opens with a charred coffee maltiness, quickly overtaken by an assertive citrus, piney hop flavor. Hints of plum and cashew, mostly an underline beneath the roasted malt bittersweetness. Lingering roasty and bitter hop flavor on the thingue. Excellent. I could drink this by the liter."
"Almost black in appearance. A one finger light brown head caps the top. Retention leaves something to be desired and the lace is negligible. Nose is roasty and chocolatey and a little minty even. The taste is quite agreeable. I like the dry chalky mouthfeel in conjunction with the bitter roasted notes in the flavor. Chocoalate comes into play. And there's a great lingering bitterness after the swallow. This is a beer I'd dip into every so often were it available here."
"Pours a nice foamy tan head with a fairly black/brown body. I first noticed the coffe aroma. This is a very rich beer(not as rich as brooklyns black chocoalte) but the sweet chocolate taste really stands out to me. This isn't as distinct as the other southern tier beers as you are not knocked out and amazed by the potent hops and pine flavor but it is still a solid brew. I could very easily see myself picking up a 6 pack of this every 3 months or so."
"A full, big-bubbled head of dark tan foam rises above an almost opaque black-brown body; yet the head retention is somewhat limited. Only glints of ruby-mahogany can be seen around the edges and base of the glass. The nose is rich and inviting with wafts of distinct bittersweet chocolate and toffee over more subtle notes of coffee. It's smooth across the palate with a medium-light body and restrained carbonation. The flavor is not as rich as the nose suggests it might be, but the same bittersweet chocolate, toffee, and mocha character remains. A delicate undercurrent of yeasty fruit and a splash of grassy hop flavor add some character; and a solid bitterness backs it leading to a very dry, powdery finish."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a nice one inch semi tan head. Smell is of roasted malts, chocolate, and some floral type hops. Taste is of chocolate, roasted espresso, maybe some nuttyness in there underneath. Hops are there and provide a nice counterbalance to the sweet, roasted malts. Well balanced and smooth. Body is a bit on the light side. Kind of a simple beer with the coffee/chocolate dominance and balance all around, just a well made, easy drinking, sessionable porter. I'm really enjoying this Southern Tier sampler pack."
"Southern Tier Porter isn't a big porter and it certainly isn't a 'robust' one. It is, however, delicious and is just light enough that several could disappear without a second thought. Too bad I only have this one. If I lived in their distribution area, I would never be without a few sixers of Southern Tier beer. Thanks to HappyHourHero for the bottle."
"Overall, it's a pretty good session ale. I could definitely see myself having a few pints of this. Recommended."
"Pours with a two-finger tan head that fades slowly leaving an even lace. Black - nearly opaque. Good carbonation, heavy bodied. Nose is a smokey roast. Starts with a roasted coffee flavor, finish has a slight bitterness. $1.85 for a 12 oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"i quite enjoyed this one, moreso than i would have expected from the reviews of it thusfar (though not scathing, it seems most find this one to be fairly average). it pours a lovely dark, dark brown/ruby colour with a decent sized (yet only moderately sticky) off white head. the smell is of roasted, burnt malt, earth, and a touch of semi sweet chocolate with a hint of coffee somewhere. good but a bit thin, though it should be so (i think) for a porter. the flavour is a mixture of roasted malt, smoked bitterness, toasted bread, etc. and, again, remains thin, but thick enough to hold it's own. i liked that this one doesn't try to go big and pose as a stout. it's flavourful and definitely easy to drink. recommended."
"This porter is a dark brown bordering on black, with a nice tan head that settles down to just a whisper, but lasts the whole beer. I smell anise and chocolate in the nose. This is a very fresh tasting beer, with good roasted chocolate malt, and I would say fairly aggressive hopping for a porter. It does not have a particularly creamy mouthfeel; in fact, it's a little bit thin, but that does serve to make the beer drinkable. The aftertaste is coffee and the finish is dry and rather refreshing for a dark beer. This would make a great session porter, and I'm looking forward to seeing what else this brewery has to offer."
"Thanks to the Evil-Davo from the Dark-Side for this Porter Dark cum Brown Ale sample! Cheers Mate."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1/2"" tan head, which laces quite well. A barely translucent reddish dark brown brew, with a slightly smoky coffee dark malt aroma. Reminds me of a lighter bodied Guinness, but tasting with more coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good. Nothing much detracting here, but not much to honk the horn about either. An acceptable porter."
"Drinkability & Notes: A very interestingly layered porter, quite flavorful yet not robust at all. I paired this with some smoked cheddar and rye crackers."
"Got this one on tap. Poured dark brown/black with a thin head. Pretty much opaque. Smell and taste were both roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was a little thin for what I was expecting. Overall very drinkable. I like this style and could drink these all night. Certainly worth a try."
"Smoky in character, with a definitely sweet malt presence on the tongue. Not as complex and chewy as I like my porters, but thoroughly drinkable."
"Pours an inky brown; no light comes through. Modest tan head that leaves a patterned lace. The aroma is of peaty malts. There are some hops behind it all. First taste is very smoky, like ashes in the fireplace. Second taste too. Dark roasted coffee, but no sign of those hops. A little too much carbonation for a porter that's on the heavy side."
"Poured out a black color with a big amount of carbonation. A little surpised by the carbonation because porter's shouldn't have this much carbonation to them. Smell consisted of roasted coffee and grains. A little bit of hops can be detected as well. Taste was a little lackluster I thought. Coffee flavors come through with some hop bitterness and a touch of grainy flavors as well. Aftertaste had some coffee and roasted flavors in it. I've had their mild ale and pilsner and this porter is a little weak. Nothing seems to mesh together in here. I'll pass this beer next time."
"Had this brew last night at Mahars, served in a 12 oz. Bottle. The beer poured to a opaque brownish/black color with a nice bubbly, 2 finger, dark tan head that has great retention and breaks down to great lacing for the entire brew. The aromas of this brew roasted malt with coffee, chocolate and other earthy smells dominating, a very nice smelling brew! The taste of this brew has a lot to do with the roasted qualities experienced in the aroma with some highlights of chocolate and caramel in the middle. The backend was a mixture of the caramel and a nice hop. Over all I liked this brew, little on the thin side but enjoyed it as the temps where up a bit! During the colder months I think I would reach for something a little more robust. Looking forward to trying some of there other offerings."
"Pours out dark brown almost black with a reddish glow when held to the light, medium tan head that fades to a lace. Aroma is a roasted coffee sweet malt with a bit of chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma roasted coffee and chocolate malt. I was expecting a little more flavors more robustness to this porter but regardless it was still quite tasty. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and very easy to drink more than one. Not a bad porter but it's lacking something."
"Though not their best beer, Southern Tier still continues to amaze me. This brewery is a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover, since the contents within far exceed the label outside. A good if not great dry porter, and I'd probably still have one again."
"A dark dark almost black color with an average head of a tan color. The smell was aromatic with strong hints of coffee and roasted malts. The taste was of roasted malts and coffee. I thoroghly enjoyed this porter. It was very smooth and easy to drink. It also has a nice warm feeling. I like that."
"Deep coppery brown with a thick beige to tan colored head. Rather hoppy smelling for a porter, roasty and malty smelling, too. I just noticed the hops first. Tastes rather malty and roasted malt notes, coffee, chocolate, and other typical porter notes, only a bit subdued. Slight watery aftertaste, but doesn't interfere with the overall experience. Good porter in the context of knowing it's ABV is low. Could drink this one all day, but I'm not going to."
"Dark brown body topped by a rather thin tan head that quickly fades to nothing, even with an agressive pour. A bit of a sweet chocolate aroma, but overall fairly faint. The taste is also rather uneventful. Theres a decent amount of bitterness, but also a touch of wet cardboard. Carbonation is a bit light, bordering on flat. Slight roasted notes on the aftertaste, but it starts tasting a bit like watered down cola with a cigarette butt floating in it. Still better than most macro offerings, but perhaps a ""tier"" below the other offerings I've tried from this brewery. Not bad, but definitely not a stellar example."
"The taste is a little underwhelming. The coffee is rather weak and quickly fades away leaving a lot of carbonation and just a hint of hops. Not a lot of depth of flavor here. It is somewhat creamy but that really can't save it for me. It had some potential but couldn't follow through."
"Southern Tier's Porter pours a very dark-brown, nearly black color. The head is a respectable blanket of cream-colored, stable foam. Aroma is mostly roasted grains, with a slightly burnt smell. Hop flavors are subdued. Nice maltiness up front, with a sharp graininess throughout the beer. There is a surprisingly acidic quality, that I could do without. Finish is quite bitter, and not bad. Overall, it's a respectable, very enjoyable porter."
"I'm having a 2nd bottle, almost 2 years later (10/02/05) and it's still sweet, slightly bitter, roasty, a top-notch, definitely drinkable porter. My review stands. Good stuff."
"Good solid porter on tap at MacGregor's. Poured a deep brown with cranberry red spalshed along the bottom of the mug. Small ring of tan head. Smelled earthy and coffee like and that is pretty much what the taste was. Tons of roasted whole bean smell and just a slight hint of caramel. Also a sharp grainy effect that I have found in more American porters than English ones(my buddy had a Fuller's and it was much creamier and less harsh). None the less this is another fine selection from the Southern Tier line and I am excited about the availability of the beers."
"Appearance: Pours a deep ruby brown nice full tan head large bubbles looks highly carbonated, collar of lace forms nicely nice rings of webbed lacing. Aroma: I like the mild nut tone along with the deep roasted malts and chocolate and coffe hints thrown in there a solid all around porter not over the top but very solid aromatically speaking. Taste: Light chocolate maltiness a refreshing rush of espresso like tone, not bad fairly smooth and creamy in flavor not bad at all. Mouthfeel: A bit on the light side for a porter not great but still very good. Drinkability: Fairly easy porter not too many complexities here if your looking for an excellent porter pass on this one much better ones but this is good microbrewed porter that I will partake in when the price is right."
"Poured a nice foamy tan head that settled down to coat the top of the beer and and bit of lace on the glass. I love the smell of this beer, typical roasty porter smell up front and then you get hit with the hops. The hops carry over to the taste as well. The first taste is of porter, then you can really taste the hops, which carry over to the aftertaste. The biggest downfall is that its a little on the thin side. I don't think porters are typically this hoppy, but being a hophead I love it."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights, small tan head that quickly recedes to a small ring. Aroma is a bit thin, but consists of roasted coffee, chocolate (bitter), and a tiny bit of hops. Flavor is also a bit on the thin side, dominated mostly by some coffe flavors, but also some bitter chocolate and a bit of toffee. Has a fairly thin and watery feel in the mouth."
"An easy drinker with some substance, not bad at all."
" A good brown Porter."
"The beer pours a traditional dark brown/black color with a light tan head. The head is gone within seconds of the pour, but the appearance is still strong. The aroma is of roasted barley and chocolate malts. The taste also has the same malt character. It is well balanced and low/med bodied. This is a fine porter. It doesn't stray much from the old standard, but if it isn't broken, don't fix it."
