"Pours black from the bottle with a finger of foamy light brown head. It dissipates quickly, leaving very little lacing. Smells of chocolate, breadymalt malts and roasted coffee. The taste is all that, but so much bigger. Dark chocolate, roasted, smokey coffee and a nice hoppy bitterness on the end. Several have compared it to a black IPA, but it's definitely a porter first-and-foremost. Medium thick mouth that's fairly oily. I really, really like this one."

"An impressive beer to say the least. It has aggression, but it's throttled back. It harkens back to an older time but still makes progress in the new age. Without a deft hand in both formulation and production a beer of this magnitude could easily jump the tracks. If you're a fan of roast and chocolatey beers this one's worth seeking out!"

"you know, coffee is coffee, a roasted beverage that on its own uses bitterness and roast taste to fine advantage.  Jose Marti does the same.  but my only complaint is the roast malt taste is too pronounced.  its like a char rather than a toast.  kudos to Cigar City for a fine brew, but not a favorite for me.  I enjoy the hops but, honestly it just make me crave a guiness instead.    More hops! Less Roast! please"

"O – Has the build of a traditional porter, but with the bitterness of a hard American Imperial stout.  Interesting and memorable, and a tough one to break down, as well as a tough one to drink easily."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hops themselvies aren't very pronounced. I thought they would be a bit more bolder."

"This outstanding porter pours a near black with an almost tan head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is very dark and roasty with notes of coffee and chocolate offset by a pleasing hop presence. The mouth is rich and creamy with a very full body given the style. The flavor is a delicious blend of hops, coffee, and chocolate. Very well balanced and pleasantly warming with its alcohol presence. This is an awesome porter, obe of the best that I've had. I just wish I could get it more often and easily."
""
"Pour is black with tons of tight tan head and a thick lacing. Nose has a robust malt up front of milk chocolate and roasted malt. Aggressively hopped citrus behind and hop resin behind. Taste is heavier roast, still fairly rich and malty, some citrus hop and a hint of an herbal note. Silky smooth body with an assertive carbonation and a fairly dry chalky finish."
""
"O - Nice beer though not memorable. I could easily drink more of this without complaint. It just doesn't stand out as something special. Somewhere between a porter and a black IPA - probably more black IPA. Very drinkable - scary to think this is an 8% beer - really doesn't make the alcohol presence known at all."
""
""
""
"O- I love CCB. Great job again guys!"

"Overall: Coming into this, I was really into it, but couldn't help but lose interest towards the end. Uninspiring like I said. Not a bad porter. Almost perfect introduction if your new to the category, but something I most likely wouldn't try again. Cheers!"
"My initial, heavy handed pour resulted in a pseudo-cascade which created three fingers od dense, deep-brown head with great retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44) with garnet highlights. Nose smelled more of dark things - tar, charcoal, tobacco, dark chocolate, dried dark fruits, leather than of hops, but the proof of the pudding is in the tasting. My first sip filled my mouth with a big, thick dollop of dark chocolate pudding. No, I mean, beer, but it was like a Jell-O pudding cup and I thought about inviting Bill Cosby over to share this with him. It had a bitterness, to be sure, but it went more towards enhancing the coffee-like inherent bitterness than making it ""American"" in terms of its hops. I was reminded of the fact that I am not a fan of Black IPAs for almost the same reason. The dark malts get in the way of the hops, almost wasting the hops, as opposed to showcasing them. This was not quite as much of a turn-off for me, but I have also had Porters that I enjoyed much more. The finish was dry and bitter, but whether due to the malts, to the hops or a combination thereof, I could not discern. If they decide to CAN this beer, I will revisit it, but otherwise, this was a one-and-done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The beer isn't as fresh as it could have been, but still the balance wasn't were it should have been."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This has a ton of personality and originality and I found this to be yet again a triumph for CC."
"Overall: I'm actually not a fan of overly hoppy beers but really enjoyed this one. There are so many different flavors here yet its very enjoyable and quite drinkable. I really like how well the porter and hops played well together. Another solid outing from Cigar City."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is my first offering from CCB and it did not disappoint. I feel like this would be the quintessential Porter for IPA fans."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very impressed with this offering. I like most of the CCB stuff, and figured this would be top notch as well, but it really surprised me, and could very well be my favorite porter. It kills me there stuff isn't more available. C'mon CCB, step it up. I want to roll into a store and buy a six of this any time I want. Otherwise, I just go with someone else."
"O:Very nice spin on a porter.I've never had a porter that was so hop forward.I really like the toffe and hop flavor I'm getting.I would deff drink again and would recommend if you like porters and IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Different take on the traditional porter I am accustomed to--GLBC's Eddy Fitz, but wonderful in its own right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is bitter, resin, dark chocolate, burnt coffee. Long bitter finish. Lots of carbonation here. A unique porter for sure. I'd never had a porter that was so hop forward; wasn't bad but wasn't something I had expected."
""
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A distinctive beer to say the least, Jose Marti balances a big hop presence with big chocolate and roasty characteristics and against all odds makes it work seamlessly. It's a highly drinkable porter that hides its alcohol content well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very interesting porter. I'd argue this is more of a hoppy stout. Reminds me a bit of Storm King in how hoppy it is, but lighter in mouthfeel, just as creamy and hoppy in a different way. But the roasty character is great. Definitely more interesting than Edmund Fitzgerald or Black Butte Porter, but a bit less enjoyable than these two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown to black with subtle creamy head. Aroma is roasted chocolate, coffee, and a definite piney hop presence. Flavor is huge chocolate and coffee. Sweet and chewey mouthfeel with a surprising hop bitterness. Very good stuff and lots of complexity all the way through. This is one of my favorite porters up there with Black Butte and CCB's Puppy's Breath."

"Overall - A really enjoyable beer. The carbonation level kind of threw me off, but it works. The beer has a fantastic balance of flavours and the alcohol is very well hidden. A great beer from a great brewery."

"O: 3.75 While the porter style is not my go to brew, I enjoy a good porter every now and then. This one certainly fits the bill, and is a good representation of the style. The roast aroma and flavor certainly take lead, and I have a feeling the 'over hopped' description has faded with time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really tasty beer. Worth the try for sure. Would definitely drink again."

"O: Nice beer, worth tasting. Not my all time favorite CCB brew. but definitely one of my favorite Porters."
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like this beer. I'd like it a whole lot more if it were about 1/4 less bitter than it is. The rich chocolate aromas are amazing, and the feel is fantastic."
""
"Nice porter overall."
""
"Jose Marti American Porter pours a dark brown with a thick tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma has some dark malt, but citrus like hops also come into the mix. The flavor is quite nice, notes of cocoa up front then a wallop of citrus hop flavor. Nice mouthfeel, definitely a little on the thicker side. Stronger than a typical porter. Excellent beer!"
"I had this last week as a night cap and didn't enjoy it nearly as much as having this one alone. Really a great beer. Complex, different, delicious."

"Overall: while this beer's strength and somewhat raspy hoppiness could theoretically detract from its drinkability, I think its skilful balance and successful execution of the elusive dark-yet-hoppy paradigm make it a simply delightful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Other hoppy porters have not really impressed me that much, but this is top notch. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
"O: This beer was a real treat for me, being a gift from my TB area sis whiIe on vacation at the beach. In my estimation it's a fairly special beer that demands some quiet contemplation, for when you want something better than good. Jose Marti American Porter gets high marks for depth, subtlety, complexity and balance."

"It's a very nice hoppy porter. The hops didn't overtake the roast characteristics and it is still recognizable as a porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really complex porter that stands out among those I've tried. I think its better as it warms to 65-70 degrees. The smoke is heavy on this one and the aftertaste is really strong"
"$7.49 for a 4 pk"
""
"O - This is a good beer easy drinking, will enjoy the rest of it!"
""
""
""
""
"Very nice, heavily hopped porter. Would certainly grab another if given a chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a nice deep brown color with a moderate tan head on top. The retention and lacing are very good on this beer. The smell of the beer is robust and hoppy. The taste is bitter, plenty of piney hops in there with a chocolatey roast flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and dry, nice bitterness also. Overall this beer is basically a Black IPA but very good regardless."
""
""
"O/D - Complex and very drinkable. A tasty, hoppy porter. Pleaseure to sip and the 8% is well masked."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great porter with big flavors. The hops and roasty malts compliment each other very nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a thin, quickly receding head. Typical porter look but I wouldn't describe it as robust. Smells more of dried fruit than your typical porter. Some hints of chocolate, cherries, malt, and a little smokiness. Taste is interesting, bittersweet chocolate and heavy on the dried fruits. Finishes with smoke, charcoal, and raisin. Nice flavor but definitely not a classic porter in the sense. Mouthfeel is thin and light bodied, very little carbonation. Soft on the palate. Overall another excellent CCB offering. I love everything this brewery produces and this one is no exception."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, not a bad porter, just wish the flavors were a bit more well rounded with each other."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is more-than-solid hoppy strong porter. Too bad the burnt notes take away from the hops and the core complexity of the roasted malts."

"Overall: a very rich porter appropriately described as a ""robustly hopped American porter"" and properly classified as an Imperial porter. Higher ABV is fairly well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Average porter at best"
""
""
"O: Don't hate it, don't love it. I'm finding it hard to drink, if not quite completely unpalatable. These robust porters never fully work for me. Still, I'd like to try this fresh - we can't look a gift horse in the mouth, can we?"
""
"This is a very tasty beer that's easy to drink for 8% abv. The flavors definitely come through as the beer warms."
""
"This is a really flavorful roasty porter with notes of dark chocolate and citrus in a light body. The many layers of flavor remind me of a Belgian praline. 8% ABV comes at you toward the end, but is otherwise well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an excellent American/English-style porter that had everything I like and I enjoyed this thoroughly. Overall, this was pretty straight forward porter that was very well-balanced and truly easy to enjoy. If you’re a fan of porters, definitely give this a shot!"
""
"This is an amazing beer, with the power to be a closer"
"I didn't have high hopes for this beer, but Cigar City smashed that! This is a fine roasted Porter from Cigar City. I would definitely buy this again. Another winner from Cigar City. "
""
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially at an astounding 8% abv. This beer drinks more like a session beer, which could bode not so well for some. Overall, a very well executed example of a porter from a brewery known for its consistency, quality, and ingenuity. Well done, Cigar City!"
""
"O - In my opinion, right in line with GL Edmund Fitzgerald, which is one of my favorites. A well-crafted porter that I wish I could drink with regularity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with slight off white head. Big hop aroma, mixed with bitter dark coffe malts. Taste is bitter coffee malts mixed with crisp hop flavor. Its a bit over bitter, over carbonated, and thin, but still has a nice flavor. Nice brew, not the best porter out there, but good and nice to drink."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pairs well with food"

"Overall (4.0): This is a damn good American porter. I like that it maintains all the trappings of a dark beer that drinks and feels like an IPA, but without coming off as an ABA/CDA/IBA, etc. As for the relatively low appearance score, it may be that I poured this on the cold side and, for what it’s worth, I seem to weigh appearance much more heavily than most people, but it’s still not a bad looking beer. I just can’t get enough head, in most cases (har har, I know . . . ). Definitely worth trying, if you like porters and / or hoppy dark beers."
"Detectable yeast with complex and balanced esters, earthy and assertive hops, spot-on chocolate, coffee and roasted barley notes that are far and away from the blunt and deragotory shouting of flavours (sadly) in most American-brewed porters. Hazed opaque, deep, deeeep brown colour with reddish tints towards the glass's edges, rather than a flat black all the way through. Instant classic in my book, tastes REAL in a way that's hard to pin, just nothing is off, or excessive or blunt. The beer is a whole being, ingredients playing together really well. I loved this last year, but never reviewed it, and I think I may have fallen for it even harder this release. A must-try for Porter fans, and one of CCB's best brews, in my opinion (FL native here, too)!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O- It's hoppiness sets it apart from 98% of porters out there, just short of over the top. I found the cocoa and bitterness to play well off each other. Yum!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-overall another great beer from cigar city...highly recommended porter."
""
""
"O: This wasn't as good as I remember it. Not sure if something was wrong with the bottle that caused the precipitates, but the hop presence wasn't what I remembered. When I have a chance to pick up another bottle, I'll update the review."
""
"Overall, this is a highly drinkable, tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my favorite porters. It has a great blend of typical dark roasty flavors with a great bitter hop bite. Certainly worth a try if you get a chance. "
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Feel is moderate and offers a bit of viscous fruit, again reminiscent of an English yeast, but is overall rather thin for the style, particularly at 8%. Interesting yet a bit of a miss for me."
""
""
""
"Overall I could not drink this beer. Too much bitterness, too much hops, just too much. I do not enjoy hoppy dark ales so this just totally didn't work for me. This is not a porter in my opinion, but a black IPA/Cascadian dark ale. Not my cup of tea for sure."
"Overall, this is another wonderful offering from Cigar City, a clear example that they, most assuredly, have their shit together in Tampa. A dark/dense, straightforward Porter that also happens to be elegantly hopped and possessive of a unique enough constitution to keep one guessing and intrigued."
""
"D ~ One of the best American porters I have had to date. Very focused flavors, a substantial ABV, no heat, no boozyness, & a great finish. Delectable! Big ups to my Papa in FL for this one!"
""
""
"Pours a pretty brown/black with a slow falling finger of latte foam. Nice lace. Smells of grass, mint, resin, cold coffee and dry malts. Bitter up front with a kick of dry, porter malts and a woody toasted malt finish. The flavor is progressive and fun. Medium bodied with a little higher carb than preferred for the style and a hint of dryness on the finish (which is nice). A good beer from my standpoint. The nose is a little meh, but the hops are not overdone, and that was a fear. They have done a decent job walking the line between ABA and Porter."
""
""
"O - Overall a fine porter. Over-hopped, just as they describe. Great flavors working together to make a delicious beer."
""
""
"M: Medium leading to full."
"$2 a single"
""
"O- This is my favorite beer I've had so far from CCB- I've had the Jai Lai, Maduro, and Humidor Series IPA (still have Bolita to try). I liked the balance between the coffee, chocolate sweetness of it paired with the hops which creates an interesting taste to the beer. The only downside is that the hops takes a little bit away from the sweetness from the beer, which is why I like regular porters a little bit better."
"Overall: Glad I got to get this while I was in Florida. It's a great porter. Highly recommended."
""
"O: I'm not the biggest fan of hop forward porters and stouts, but this one was very solid overall. The hops didn't linger around too long and the malt bill was solid from start to finish."
""
""
""
"This is a very good, surprisingly hoppy porter. Great roast aroma and flavor dominate but allow some other nice characteristics to come through. It gives the feeling of something bigger without being a really huge beer."
"Overall: Honestly I wasn't the biggest fan of this beer I didn't really care to much for it being hops forward."
"The body is nearly that of a stout in the fullness of the body and the ashy feel in the mouth. Really nice and if you didn't know better you'd think that you had a hopped imp stout in your glass."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was expecting more hop presnce in the taste following the aroma, but it seemed to be quite subdued. It still however was a nice porter with plenty of roast presence."
""
"This is fantastic. This could make an argument about when does a porter/stout become a black IPA. I could drink several of these."
""
""
"o - overall, this is a unique porter. less char, more tang. interesting indeed."
""
""
"O: I like this a lot, a very good robust porter. A very good beer, glad I tried it. I would buy again depending on the price."
""
""
"Call it what you want...this is a beer that I am stocking up on next time I am in Florida."
"T: Excellent beer, but may need some time to mellow the hops a bit. $10 per 4 pack or so. I'd do it again. Excellent beer."
"O: Wow, I didn't know what to expect with this beer at all, and I have been more than impressed. The amount of hops and coffee make for an interesting flavor, that really works nicely. Very well done beer. Glad I could try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Still a solid beer, but fresh from the source on tap has got to be the way to go here. Also, who knows what type of batch variation a brewery like CCB sees? (3)"
""
""
""
"Salud!"
"overall a good hoppy porter."
""
""
"Pours a reddish brown color with a massive three finger creamy tan head. Aroma is grassy hops, licorice, dark chocolate, some smoke, and bitter espresso. Extremely complex. Taste is similar, but the hops are most dominant from beginning to end. Extremely dry finish. Overall, this is a delicious porter. My biggest complaint is that the hops are a little too present, which as a result mutes the other flavors that I was getting in the aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was surprised by how much I ejoyed this one. The hops took this one in a different direction than just being a regular porter. Nicely done!"
""
"CCB has proven to me to hit much more often than miss, and has been a most welcome revelation here in Tampa. Jose Marti has quickly planted itself in my top ten porters, taking its place by GL Edmund Fitzgerald, Zwyiec, and FD Gonzo Imperial. Very well done by CCB, and heartily recommended."

"O- Cigar City has not let me down yet. This is a very interesting porter. It does not depart from the style, yet manages to make its own mark."
"Poured a 12oz bottle, dated 8/2011, into my DFH sniffer. Appearance is very pretty, dark with a big head. Smell is similar to a chocolate cake. After a few big sips, I declare this is one of the best porters I have had to date. Very complex, tons of chocolate, smokey malts, and a hint of coffee. Glass is coated with tons of sticky lacing. This tastes like a stout, but drinkablity is amazing with ABV at 8%. I wish I had better access to Cigar City beers, as this would be a staple in my fridge."
"Thanks miamichael2 for the trade!"
"Taste is also kinda tart, a bit sweet and a multitude Ness with some really good odd off flavors I can't name. Mouthfeel is light and slightly sharp."
"O - is a really good drink"
"Really enjoyed the balance of flavors with this one--an excellent and complex porter."
"Thought this was really very good, the 2nd I've had from Cigar City and I'd say the best. Better than the Imperial Milk Porter, which was good."
"Overall - a really solid brew. I wish all the variations I've tried also as intended (had a number of infected bottles)."
"Cheers to Jose Marti!"
"O: overall I never pay for one these again. and I had a few years ago version that did not seem so bad. This 1 is a drain pour sadly."
"Mouthfeel: This is another beer that has a nice lingering effect on the tongue without being too heavy."
"O: another unique brew from CCB, this one doesn't work for me though. The flavors seem to be competing with each other which takes away from the drinkability."
"D - right up my alley; nice combo of taste and mouthfeel that really works for this style; i could probably drink one of these every night!"
"Mouth is smooth but did have a bit of a grainy like texture.A thicker feeling porter than most I have tasted. More like a baltic porter."
"O= Overall great beer from a great brewery they are really doing great things in Tampa can't get enough of CCB one of my favorite breweries just wish I could get them in my area."
"Overall: Drinkable and the right amount of hop flavor with a solid stout background."
"O- Fantastic beer for the style. I highly recommend this beer to everyone. Check it out!"
"O: another quality product from CCB. I can easily see myself going back to this one, highly recommended."
"O - I really enjoyed this. If I were strictly rating to style I might dock it a bit for being more like a stout. But this is a very nice beer."
"O- One of the most interesting and complex porters I've had. The depth of flavor here is insane. Definitely recommend seeking this one out."
"But that's just, like, my opinion, man."
"Overall this is a huge miss for me. I just can't get past the hop forward profiles in this. Nice to try but I will pass next time."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a nice thick off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium dry coffee notes with some black chocolate and some roasted malt. Taste is very smooth with a nice balance between some roasted malt with black chocolate notes and light dry coffee at the end. Body is quite full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation. I quite like this one and wouldn’t mind having it more often."
"O - This is a very good porter thats very easy to drink with its very good taste worth picking up if you ever see it around"
"Thanks again sendsilk!"
"Overall -- Well-done, but somehow it didn't come together for me. The hoppy/leathery interplay seemed to dominate and it wore on my palate. Additionally, the hops seemed to mute a lot of the complexity. I prefer Avery's New World Porter for this particular style sub-catetory. Jose Marti is still enjoyable, though. If you have it available to you, I'd suggest that you at least try it."
"12oz bottle for $1.99. Would I do it again? Hell yes."
"On draft during CCB takeover at Coffee District. Watered down coffee in color with with 2 fingers worth of white foam. I was simply amazed by this brew, as I have never had or heard of the style. Tastes of hops at first, then the usual suspects of a porter emerge afterward. Smell is similar to taste, hoppiness and roasted malts. The name is so fitting. Thin bodied, carbonation throughout and very drinkable. Could be had all day like a session beer, but be aware of the creeping 8% ABV. Wonderful balance of both styles."
"Fuller medium body, overcarbonated, chewy and full on the tongue, but prickly as well. A pretty interesting take on the porter, although the off scents/flavor were interfering with what might otherwise be a delicious beer. I love CC, but this is the 2nd time I've gotten an off bottle."
"Overall impression: I can dig it. A very solid hoppy porter. Certainly worth a shot."
"O- This is a very, very unique beer, and I wasn't sure to think of it before trying it, but it really comes together nicely."
"A really good beer. This is probably the best India, or hoppy porters I've had."
"O: Excellent and unique, but this one is not formall tastes. My wife hated it but I liked it. Divisive to the 10th power."
"Pours a very dark, dark brown, almost black, but light is able to pierce through the beer a tad showing off its brown color. A small tan head forms and spreads out to the sides of the glass leaving a nice lace around the brim of the glass. This beer smells of coffee and sweet chocolate. I gather small notes of char, like this is a smoked porter. Taste is hoppy, grassy, with an after taste of chocolate and coffee. The taste doesn't seem to be quite in line with the smell. Mouthful is on the thin side and beer seems to be well carbonated. Overall another good beer from CCB. This porter ranks in between the 1st and 2nd tier of its class."
"Overall: I really liked this porter. I enjoyed the fact that the bitterness overpowered the sweetness, but still allowed some other flavors to come out. Smokey and smooth."
"Robust is the word here. Layers of complexity and tons of flavor. Reminds me a bit more of an Imperial Brown such as Ode To Mercy more than an Imperial Porter, but either way this is a mighty tasty brew."
"Bitter, overly acrid roasted malt notes slam the palate with each sip, and the finish is both ashy and hop-laden. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with a medium body and drying, sticky finish. Can't decide if this is an overly hoppy Porter, or an overly roasted Black Ale. Either way, it doesn't quite work for me."
"Overall: Solid porter from Cigar City Brewery. This is my first beer from the brewery and I can't wait to try the other beers i have from them! I normally enjoy my porters on the malter side with just a dash of hops, but this was a well done beer."
"Normally I wouldn't review a beer I suspected to be compromised. However, I owe a debt of gratitude to the ultra-generous Ultraman9000 for the bottle and, besides, this is still a plenty salvageable beer, the slight sourness notwithstanding. For a brewery quickly becoming renown for over-the-top releases, this moderate offering made a good first impression."
"Cheers"
"O: Very tasty coffee porter but if you don't like coffee this wouldn't be for you. I would have a this around a lot if I could get it. Good stuff."
"Overall this is a pretty enjoyable and uniquely flavored porter. I enjoyed it."
"Overall this is one of the most unique distinct beers I've ever had. I give it props for being tasty, unique, and a killer look. But not for everyone."
"Pours a completely opaque deep brown, with a fluffy cocoa brown head. Webbed lace, some big chunks retain. Nose is a luscious milk chocolate, some roasted notes, lighter vanilla bean, a touch of alcohol and molasses/caramel. A substantial dose of hops as well. Taste has some chocolate, lighter roasty notes, cocoa, some light alcohol again. A similar vanilla sweetness to the nose and a some goof hop bitterness which works well with everything else going on here. Mouthfeel is full, super creamy and velvety, just spot on. Great drinkability and an awesome American porter."
"My first (of many) Cigar City beers did not disappoint and I can’t wait to crack into some more!"
"Overall I was very pleased and found it a great drink even out of dark beer season. Can a porter be refreshing? This one seems to be. Thanks TKEbeerman!"
"D - This one really grew on me. At first, I was thrown off, because I thought the ""India"" referred to ""hoppy"" (akin to an IPA) and not the actual country itself. This was indeed a pleasant surprise. Leave it to Cigar City to come up with something like this. I'd love to try a cedar-aged version of this puppy!"
"O - Very good flavors. Well crafted beers with some nice roast and some slight chocolate sweetness. Its a bit crisp"
"D - Little carbonation, coats the mouth fully."
"B – Another very nice offering from the gang at CCB. If you are a fan of porters this one will do you well. The smokiness if also a great feature and makes for a pretty complex taste."
"O: Really fascinating brew. It is hard to wrap my head around all of the flavors that just assaulted my mouth. I look forward to the next Cigar City molesting..."
"This is stellar! I had never heard of this one and just stumbled across it in the cooler section at Knightly. Really impressed. Should get more buzz."
"Pours a very respectable dark reddish brown with a bit of off-white head. Not a whole lot to the appearance but the hue is phenomenal. Smells sweet and malty. Tons of caramel coupled with a nice light roast. Some hops present on the nose as well. Tastes sweet and bitter at the same time. A perfect balance of roast and caramel on the tongue. The hops balance the sweetness and roastiness out not a great beer."
"O- If you are in the mood for something dark and different but don't want a stout... open up one of these, take a toke... and let it blow your mind!!!"
"Overall a decent beer, I don't think I would trade for it again though. I wish the dark chocolate came through more in the taste."
"Overall, every time I am giving the opportunity to try a Cigar City beer I am knocked on my ass with awesome flavors. This beer is no exception. Tons of great melded flavors come together in a balanced fashion and they win me over."
"Overall - another quality effort from Cigar City. I've tried 3 of their beers now and they have all been good. I would definitely drink again. They are slowly starting to be one of my favorite breweries. Wish they distributed here in 'The Lou'."
"O - Really enjoyed this offering. Drinks and taste like a stout to me, but half the time I can't even tell the difference so I'm reviewing it as I see it - a fantastic CCB beer. Would like a 6 of this."
"O: All in all, this is a fantastic beer! Very well balanced. Has a lot of great flavors and scents bouncing around. Definitely try this if you like CCB and porters. Well done!"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Just under medium bodied with great fine carbonation. Very creamy. I've been very impressed by the amount of body Cigar City has in their brews. Overall, a pretty solid porter, especially if you like a big roasted/smoke characteristic. I was impressed with this."
"D - Drinkability is fairly low. It is a little too boozy. But a very good porter."
"-bye"
"Dark black with dark mahogany edges, a thin white head with descent lacing. The smell is very roasted and malty. Chocolates laced with hints of coffee and earthy grass tones. A mixture of woody oak and dark chocolate. Very hoppy for a porter. Nice chocolate tones upfront with hints of coffee in the back. Lots of roasted goodness. Hint of smoke and a background of oak and wood tanins. A good earthy hop flavor throughout. Thick, and full bodied. Very drinkable and interestingly balanced between a strong earthy hop feel, a good roasted malt, and some woody tones. Very complex and interesting, but very drinkable and simple."
"O - This would make a fantastic dessert beer with chocolate cake or freshly baked, damp, chocolate chip cookies. I can't imagine drinking this in Florida though unless it got pretty cold at night. A delicious porter with a decent level of drinkability."
"Pours a very dark brown bording on pitch black, with a fluffy two fingers of foam leaving thick lacing. The nose is a dose of ethel alcohol, roasted malts, coconut vodka, and barrel aged rum. Taste has has bitter roasted malts, toasted coconut, myers dark rum and a somewhat hoppy finish. Full bodied with a somewhat astrigent finish in the mouth. Really not that excited about this beer and it wraps up a somewhat disappointing night of beer drinking."
"O - A strong porter. Not overly difficult to drink although you can tell the 8% ABV is not a lie."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, not much of a head on this one, and some minimal sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, lots of chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is malty, chocolate/toffee, and caramel. Medium Body, very nice dry/bitter finish. A pretty tasty brew."
"Overall, a very good beer. When I first tasted it, I was quite surprised by the amount of hops. (The bottle just says ""American Porter."" I didn't realize it is an ""India"" porter.) The Black-IPA style has taken off recently. I think many of these beers just go over-the-top, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I like how this is still a very well balanced and easy to drink beer."
"Poured a deep roasted chesnut brown with 1/2 tan colored head that lasted pretty well,maybe the biggest hop profile I have ever come across in a porter,not ony in the nose but on the palate as well.Resiny hop mixed with roast and a hint of unsweetened chocolate,dry and appetizing.Again the huge hop profile on the palate with hefty roast,its quite dry and the alcohol is extremely well hidden.My only small complaint would be maybe I would like a little more complexity and or sweetness to mix with the hops,but in saying that I think its a great porter.I love the big hops going on here."
"Pours with about a quarter inch of medium colored head which recedes very quickly to a film. The aroma hits you in the face with chocolate and roasted malts with a little bit of citrus hop character just underneath. The taste is the same. Sharp roastiness and chocolate come through with a bit of citrus hops and bitterness just to balance. Medium light mouthfeel. Really impressive beer, and even at 8% goes down like a champ."
"O: Overall its a decent brew and one I'd probably buy again."
"O: quite frankly this is my favorite porter. It's really too bad it's not available around these here parts."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and moderately silky smooth. Carbonation is a little below average, but fits a porter pretty nicely. Overall, this was an interesting beer but not one of my favorites. It wasn't bad at all, but things needed to mesh better for me for it to be something outstanding."
"D- I had to look at the label a few times to make sure it wasn't a ""black IPA"" or whatever name that style is going by today. This is an excellent hoppy porter and one of my favorite porters overall-actually it was better than both EITHER and OR. Job very well done by cigar city."
"D - alcohol is there so can't have too many, but the ones you can are super-enjoyable; great porter"
"D: Very nice. The dryness at the end keeps you coming back."
"M/D - Medium-heavy body that is very creamy on the palate with low volumes of carbonation. No detection of heat/feel from the alcohol either. Finishes semi-sweet. Super easy to drink, wonderful flavors and use of malt. Wish it were easier to get!"
"return trip after the Cigar City event night, enjoyed on tap at Rattle N Hum. Big head and a good porter, above average mouthfeel. A little towards the baltic porter or imperial porter. Average drinkability.Chocolate and roasted malts.Nice that ""coffee"" taste is in secondary."
"D: Would drink another."
"This is a fine porter. It sides on robust and just has a nice depth to it. I like that you can taste a hop presence without it taking away from the malt. A very good base porter for CCB to work their magic with."
"Not bad, just that CCb has much better offerings."
"D: A great example of an American Porter and another good one from Cigar City. Very easy to drink and the high ABV isn't noticable making this one high drinkability."
"Anyway this is a pretty good beer. I liked it more the more I drank it. I don't think I would specifically trade for more but if I had access to it I would drink it often. But get one to try at least."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is on the lower side for me. Overall, I don't think this is one of CCB's best. Not a bad beer, I just thought the flavor profile was lacking. Was hoping for more. Skal."
"No idea why this says india porter. No where is that indicated on label. Very confusing"
"O: This is the second Cigar City brew I've had, and yet again I've been wowed. Jose Marti India Porter is of the highest quality, every aspect of it shines. There's a reason we're all talking about CCB: because they make outstanding suds like this. A wonderful beer."
"Overall, I would love to have this beer again. The boozy nature of the beer complements the aggressive malt profile. Great job Cigar City."
"Try one. I did and I'm not a huge porter guy but it was well worth it."
"Thanks again to Thirtsybird for sharing this find brought back from his trip down South. Pours an opaque dark brown with a creamy, tan-colored head that dissipates into a skim and a cluster of bubbles. Nose reveals dark roasted malts and a slightly muted herbal/medicinal quality. Aromas of brown sugar and/or molasses also present in the nose. Taste follows nose - perhaps a little ashy. A roasted character also comes out as it warms, as well as coffee grounds. A light hops bittering lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a slightly creamy texture and a pleasant carbonation. A decent porter, but doesn't really rate high on my list."
"Might drink two at a time but three or more is out of the question."
"A rather delicious porter with lots hop flavor. This is an interesting beer. The aroma is limes and grapefruit with chocolate and roast. There's also some nice dark stone fruit, raisins and caramel. Taste is fairly sweet for a porter, but it works well. There's vanilla, grapefruit juice, coffee and maple syrup, as well. The mouthfeel is smooth and full. The beer is dark brown with a small tan cap. It's a fairly sweet, hoppy beer. Very tasty."
"D: A delicious superb porter with the right mix of hops aggression and malt-forward presence. A really exceptional beer from a brewery known better for other styles."
"D - Don't get me wrong it's a delicious beer but I definitely couldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting. It is very filling and full bodied."
" Cheers Matt"
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced, showing some interesting cigar city flare adding another layer to it."
"D: A fantastic brew from the South's greatest asset, Cigar City. This is definitely worth a try if you can get your hands on it, as it is one of the better American Porters out there."
"D: While 8.0% ABV is tame by some standards, you can get into trouble with this beer. It goes down so easy and calls you back. If I had the money and time to blow, I can see myself putting away a few pints of these."
"I am definitely digging the dark beer focus of this brewery, somehow there does seem to be dearth of these around, especially one that executes this well. I really like a well made Brown Ale and this is the second I have had from this brewery and I am looking forward to others. Despite the harsh at times hop flavors this is a beer I am definitely going to enjoy finishing my cute half growler of it."
"D: i never rate a porter hugely high because i usually just enjoy one and done, but if i had more id drink em. quite delicious."
"This beer is smooth, and quite drinkable. If I could get Cigar City locally, I'd happily pick this up again."
"A very nice porter from the folks at cigar city. So far they haven't really disappointed me. Good job fellas."
"Overall, a pretty solid porter. My gut reaction to many of the Cigar City beers I've had the opportunity to drink is that they are a rough and tumble bunch, with a diverse flavor profile that mostly hit their mark. This is no exception."
"black with ruby highlights. modest little head that never completely disappears and leaves some splotches of lace. nose is cocoa on top of a nice roast, vanilla and some fruity undertones. taste reveals a fairly roasty profile that is also generously hoppy, with flavors of citrus, earth and pine really shining through all the way to the pleasantly bitter finish. on the heavy side of medium body, or the light side of full... it's a rich and creamy beer that starts silky and ends fairly dry. goes down way too easy for an 8%abv beer. another winner from cigar city. really glad i decided to try a few of their more accessible offerings."
"There are extra burnt toast elements that are closer to a dry stout flavor wise. Dry cocoa without sugar as the brew sits in the mouth, but this gives way to a pleasant hop bitterness. The body is very good with a below average level of carbonation. Regardless, this is a very easy-to-drink porter."
"Cigar City Brewing brews some really interesting beer. This is easily the hoppiest American Porter I've ever encountered. Does it work? You betcha. The hops certainly add an interesting, lively flavor to the mix. The novel aspect of it is really nice. Maybe a little more body would be a good thing. This is really impressive beer though. Easily recommended."
"Yes, this feels like 8%. No, I have no problem with that. More please, as this is very easy drinking."
"D-definitely not a porter you can slam, but i don't necessarily think any porter should be consumed quickly. the tastes stay, this is quite an enjoyable beer to the finish. its one of my favorite porters yet. i wouldn't mind having another one and i plan on recommending this to others."
"Overall: Very good porter overall. I'm usually impressed by Cigar City and this instance does not change that in any way. I would recommend checking this one out."
"Overall a solid beer from CCB; I expect no less!"
"Light brown, almost dark red stout has a rich, barely tan head. Aroma has dark chocolate, light caramel and cocoa with a hint of whiskey. Taste is light and smooth for the strength. Alcohol hides well, but the malty body is still very thick. Lots of chocolate and burnt coffee notes. Overall the best brew I have had from Cigar City. A perfect brew in cool weather. Highly recommend."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light, enjoyable level of carbonation. Very good and quite drinkable. An awesome take on the style with the ""cigar city twist"" included. The alcohol is masterfully hidden, I'd surely drink this one again."
"Despite some of the unusual attributes and flavors skillfully combined in this beer it is quite drinkable and enjoyable. It has a Dogfish Head Palo Santo meets Terrapin India Brown meets Weyerbacher Fireside feel to it though that doesn't quite describe it."
"Medium bodied with a light effervescence. Pretty good beer but way too hoppy for this malthead and the style. More of a DIPA vibe from it."
"D - The base porter is amazing, and the hops only make this more unique. I was a little caught off guard, but ended up really enjoying this. If you're looking for a traditional porter, you may want to pass on this, but if you're looking for a hoppy porter, this is a great choice."
"Good beer. Not sure the 'india' part quite works with the roast, it takes a while to tease it out & rationalize it, but ultimately, this is a smooth-drinking porter that smells not-quite-right."
"D- Overall, Cigar City knocked this one out of the ballpark. This beer is immediately right up there among my favorite Porters. Must try beer, highly recommended!"
"HV"
"I just had this one on tap at Cigar City Brewery. A nice 1/2 inch light tan head that slowly dissipates to leace a nice ring. Smells of robust coffee and molasses. Taste is of toasty coffee and molasses with a fruity hop background. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and drinkability is through the roof. Excellent porter in my opinion."
"This is a solid porter but the bitterness is a bit overpowering."
"Drink is decent, just a hint of booze, a slight dry finish to the slight sweetness to start, the bitterness gets a little much as it builds more and more, and combines with a hint of minerality to give it a slight slower drink."
"Very nice brew."
"Dl: An exceptional porter. Roasty, chocolaty, hoppy."
"At the time of this review, this is the #29 on the top American Porter list."
"Overall impression: Incredible beer, well worth seeking out."
"Pretty easy to drink for the abv. Sneaky."
"I really enjoyed this! A solid hop presence, dark sticky sweetness, and that aforementioned tobacco flavor all combined to make this quite the complex and tasty take on a Porter. The body on this was just spot for all of that heavy feeling sweetness and I still can't believe that this was 8%. It drank like a champ! This is definitely of the better Cigar City offerings that I've had recently."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured basically black with a slight hint of brown in the light with a one and a half finger tan head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, bitter hops, and chocolate. The flavor was of roasted malt, bitter hops, dark chocolate, and coffee. It had a heavy feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was quite excellent for an American Porter. Had a very nice mouthfeel and nice aroma to match. The flavor was very well balanced with a nice hop bite and coffee taste at the end of the sip. Not a whole lot missing on this one. Nice job CCB!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, a bit of warmth going down but pretty pleasant. Thanks Russ!"
"d - A pretty good porter I would drink again. Wish there was a little bit less alcohol in the taste and wish it had sonme of the vanill from the smell, but still pretty good."
"D: An interesting beer. Even though it's a 12 oz. bottle, I found it optimal for sharing a few ways."
"Overall this beer has the tobacco character that I love in so many of CCB's beers. My only qualm is that the thickness isn't quite there, but it really is a very good beer that's well worth a shot."
"Yet another fine job from CCB."
"Pours a very dark brown, a shade or two short of black. The tan head is a half-inch thick with only mild retention and lacing. Toasty malt and dark chocolate dominate the nose with only light traces of piney hops, mocha, toast and alcohol. The taste is led by bitter chocolate up front with some semi-sweet and toasted malt and caramel on the midpalate. For being labeled an India Porter, the hops are pretty light. The dry finish is even more bitter chocolate and mild coffee notes with very little alcohol presence. Medium-to-light bodied with slightly high carbonation for the style. The dry finish also has a very slight alcohol warming effect. Pretty drinkable for an 8% porter though the dryness and bitterness wear a bit on the palette. The moderate complexity keeps it interesting through the bottle. This one is worth a try and is a solid beer, but not one of CCB's standouts."
"Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I would expect with moderate carbonation levels. Slightly dry in the finish. Overall, a really nice darker beer coming from CCB and I enjoyed it a bit more than their brown ales. However, their stouts are still king."
"D- only real letdown was the body. Fantastic beer. I wish I was closer to Philly and could get Cigar City easier, because this is fantastic"
"D: I found this one to be really quite enjoyable. Great roast character that's not overpowering and overly bitter, and the hops really kept things interesting."
"D - This is another solid brew to add to the CCB canon."
"This was my first Cigar City experience, and I'm looking forward to many more!"
"Overall, it was a unique concept, and the more I drank the more I like it. However, it was too roasted for me which took a lot away from the beer. Somewhat drinkable for me."
"Bottle courtesy of beerlando. Pours a nice rich dark brown with a fluffy 1 finger tan head with a mix of tiny and big bubbles. Head settles rather slowly and clings to the side of the glass. Good lace. Nice rich aroma of roast, dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. Some sweetness in the nose as well. Rich mouthfeel, medium. The taste has several nice transitions starting with a sweet chocolate taste that moves to bitter leather and dark chocolate. Lingering bitterness. I like the taste but would rather not have the lingering bitterness. I guess it is suppose to be aggressively hopped though. Much hoppier than most porters I have had. I'm glad the hop taste was on purpose because I definitely would have knocked it for that had I not known. Pretty good but I do rather enjoy my porters a tad less hoppy."
"This stuff goes down easy with minimal burn and high drinkability. Just about every dark beer that I have ever had from Cigar City was a knockout and I hope they keep pumping them out like this. I really enjoyed this different style of beer and would say that if you can get some go for it, because I know that I will be trying to trade for more soon. This is what I would call a perfect fall beer and easy enough to drink more than one unlike some of those belly busters out there now. Thumbs up in my book,"
"overall i am unsure of what to make of this one, but for some damn reason i am in love with it. a wonderful beer."
"Cigar City has my vote for one of the most interesting breweries in the country right now. Jose Marti isn't really a go-to porter, but it IS unique, tasty and another feather in the cap of the the white-hot guys from Tampa."
"You definitely want to give this beer a try if you are into the dark, strong beers. You won't be let down!"
"D - This is a really excellent porter. The malt character is both complex and smooth while the significant hop presence balances things out and also provides an unusual character for a beer of this style. I am especially enjoying the lingering spicy coffee flavor that comes in the aftertaste as it shows the best of the beer's smooth, but robust character. More nice work from Cigar City, this is the best of several porters that they have put out recently."
"Overall, I'm excited to see CCB bottling more brews in 6 packs. Seems like Jose Marti might need a little work to achieve greatness, but this really is a solid porter with an interesting twist. Wait and watch for my review of the Maduro Brown they put out. That brew blew me away."
"NOTE - More orange citrus hop flavor comes out as it warms up - weird."
"D: Another amazing beer from Cigar City. This beer in many ways is similar to Stone's Sublimely Self-Righteous Ale but with more of a malty body and thicker mouthfeel."
"D - Pretty solid beer, I liked it, and the alcohol is well hidden. Not a world beater, but a pretty good one."
"D- Very interesting take on the American Porter, the hoppy finish really entices me back. Wish it were not a limited release!"
"drinkability: Probably the best porter Ive had and one of the best CC's too."
"D - I like this offering. A nice straight forward hoppy porter. Recommend."
"Interesting because its not at all what you expect, give it a shot."
"I'd definitely drink more of this, but probably only one at a time due to the intense flavors present."
"Streaming a DVD quality version of Iron Man 2 online while drinking this little surprise I found 2 the store tonight. Dark, rich and the lightest bitter on the back of the tongue Well crafted American Porter from Cigar City. Even my girlfriend liked it. Coffee in the nose and makes up much of the taste, but is very well balanced between the 8% ABV and the rich malts. Yum. And a reasonable price for CCB. Just over $10 with tax."
"D: Great, I love this beer. Will miss it when it's gone."
"D - Pretty drinkable. A nice porter but nothing that blows me away. Provides a lot more chocolate flavor than most with a mix of milk and dark chocolate notes. I enjoyed this and would drink it again but doubt I'd seek it out."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. Well brewed with no major defects. I would have liked some more smoothness / carbonation. I would pair this beer with my morning eggs and bacon."
"Brewed late August 2010, drank 9/3/2010."
"Easily one of the best Porters I've ever had, but given Cigar City's track record this comes as no surprise. They're doing some great thing down there in Tampa!"
