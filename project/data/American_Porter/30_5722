I also got three fingers of dense, light-tan head with good retention. I could smell the minty hops filling the room like a pleasant air freshener. Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = 27 – 34) with NE-quality clarity and cola highlights. Between the minty hops and the chocolaty malts, I thought that I was sniffing a Peppermint Patty. Here comes Trick or Treat! Mouthfeel was medium, much less carbonated than its predecessor. Taste was spot-on: minty and chocolaty, one big Yum! This was much more in alignment with what I enjoy from this style. Finish was slightly bitter, but eminently drinkable. The glass was lined with beautiful, sticky lacing and I found myself licking my chocolaty lips while gazing at it. Why must this be only a Limited Release?  Make it year-‘round!","woodychandler","Nov 12, 2014"

This just isn't what I expect from a porter, but then I tend to judge porters by Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter and this is a far cry from that.

I did not like this beer then. Now, several years later, knowing what to expect and with a further experienced palate, I can appreciate the well built brew that sits in front of me. Go in knowing what it is and you will probably enjoy it. Go in expecting mellow soft and roasty and you will be disappointed.","kemoarps","Jan 29, 2014"

Not sure I'd even go with black ipa but it definitely had characteristics of both the porter and black ipa. For me it's quite the interesting and unique beer. Not sure what the release on this is whether it's year round or seasonal, but this was fresh and pretty enjoyable. Not something I'll crave all year long, but something that is worth picking up again. It's complexity and depth character are present and paired with some Avery class it's worth a go for anyone.

Aromas are predominantly roasty and sweet, big on notes of toffee and dark chocolate, lighter on notes of old coffee and charred skillet scrapings. All of these notes carry through taste-wise to the front and mid palate, which are very mocha-like, but the finish is decidedly darker and more charred, and conveys just a hint of vanilla that enchantingly lingers. Mouthfilling, smooth, if somewhat too silken for the boldness of its flavor profile (wow, that sounds snobbish). Very enjoyable . Really, this is an excellent beer.","droomyster","Mar 23, 2013"

Without this label--i.e. if I were drinking this blind--the beer would actually be quite good, and I would simply assume I was partaking in a good IPA with some light touches of ash. But the contrast confuses my tongue, as does the slightly watery mouthfeel. So while there is much to appreciate in this brew, I think its labeling doesn’t work. Drink it as a straight IPA, then, and enjoy.","jondeelee","May 16, 2012"

Aroma is bold, very hoppy, I get the black ipa tag. Smells like orange coffee kind of. As much as I would hate orange coffee, I like this smell. An earthy coffee taste at first, followed by some sugar coated orange and bitter hops, closes out with some roasted malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel really works for this porter, thinnish with some decent carbonation. This is a very good porter but, I must admit, the citric component to the flavor kinda is a deal breaker for me, much in the way it is in black ipa's. Everything else about this is really good though.","denver10","Feb 08, 2012"

It pours with a black body, tan fluffy head and mellow aroma of malts. The flavor is very smooth throughout with a bit of bitter toward the finish. I think the New World is nicely balanced, with good Porter roast malt flavor that does not overpower, and I like the subtle hops that come through at the end. A few of these could go down on an evening when you are in the mood for a porter or a mellow stout.","iSip","Jan 20, 2012"

Some nice lacing clinging to the glass as well. Aromas of caramel, roasted malt, light chocolate, bread, citrus, and spicy hops. Some decent aromas with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, bitter coffee, molasses, light citrus, and spicy hops. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, citrus, and spicy hops. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice and fairly creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Great balance of roasted flavors and hop character. Overall this is a very nice robust porter. I am pretty impressed on how well this has held a nice hop character after an entire year.","superspak","Nov 14, 2011"

For a beer with so much going on, and so much hoppiness, this stuff goes down real smooth.

When you take a sip you first taste the bitter piney hops, then the roasted malt and dark choclate take over and there is a hoppy, resinous finish. It feels kind of thick with low carbonation and a lingering, dry aftertaste.

3.08,-19.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"I wanna say this was brewed to commemorate the achievements of Columbus, Vespucci, and their ilk, but I somehow doubt that was the case. Oh well. It pours a dark garnet-sienna topped by a half-finger of light sandstone foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, dark chocolate, light onion, pine, and cedar. The taste does not deviate far from the smell, though thankfully the onion has dropped out, only to be replaced by a stronger pine character and some light orange peel. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, I don't feel the hoppy-ness really jives with the porter qualities at all. It's just kind of a sad excuse for a black IPA with a smidge more roast. Not a fan, myself.","TMoney2591","Mar 14, 2011"

Tastes of cocco, roast(slight), a nice earthy hop with some pine and semi citrus. This is a great twist black IPA porter, I can disern between the two, a great mix.

There are defiantly some hops and coffee notes that stick to the tongue. There is some sweet brown that show up on the second sip. The finish is long!

3.64,-5.2,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The initial hit is the big roasty malts, with coffee and burnt toast taking the lead. This flavor is followed quickly by a big hop burst that all but erases the malt flavor. The end leaves the good flavors of both the malt and the hops, but from some reason these two flavors don't blend very well IMO.

Taste dominated by the hop profile - roasty malts seem to take the backseat, which is kind of a shame (for the style at least). Mouthfeel is a just a touch thin and not too exciting.

Some chocolate is picked up later to compliment the other scents nicely. I like how the nose is strong here too. Taste is very much like the nose, with more chocolate and less vanilla. Lots of roasted, almost burnt, malts here. Probably the first time I have ever thought of a beer as tasting burnt. It is not a bad aspect, but it is just different for me. This is pretty much just a straight up porter/stout like taste. Starts tasting a lot more chocolatey and a bit like alcohol as it warms. The mouthfeel is light-moderate bodied with no real creaminess. The carbonation is right on here for the flavors. A bit of alcohol warming is present. Drinkability is good. The taste is good, the price is not bad, I don't think any of the flavors will kill this session wise and I wouldn't mind having it again.","cbutova","Nov 19, 2009"

There are the definite caramel, toffee, roasted chocolate notes, some charred like ash flavors, but this is overwhelmed in part by the leafy hop. There might be an oily or citrus hop quality trying to peak through but it is hard in a porter with a melange of malty qualities. This is a porter trying to be too much like an IPA, and I'm not so sure it completely works. There is a citrusy tanginess on the back end and into the aftertaste that does give it away.

All that keeps this from a ""5.0 taste"" is a hint of aspertine on the finish. The mouthfeel is at the right thickness and carbonation levels, with a lasting bitter chocolate finish that balances well with the hops. Overall, this was quite an enjoyable beer.

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"As Air below me put it. I too had it on tap @ Jose Pistolas in Philadelphia. This beer has all the classic porter traits to it. Pours dark brown with a tan head that disappears quite fast. The brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, and smoked flavors all pull through to make this beer an easy one to drink a few times in a row. There is a nice balance with the slight hops that ring through and the roasted flavor present right from the start. Very creamy and smooth. The flavors burst on your palate making it very easy to drink. As said below, it feels like it could be a good session beer but one too many can rock you.

Definitely worth a few pints.","ajr24","Feb 12, 2008"

I love the hoppiness of the nose thanks to the dry hopping. Behind that there is some roasted coffee trying to escape. The taste is hop forward that is really well balanced by the roastedness and coffee notes. Nice mouthfeel to it that finishes dry.

This beer goes down well, but I don't think that I'll frequent this beer again anytime soon, its just not all that great. Nothing to write home about. There are many better porters out there, however, I guess if I was in a jam and this were it, then I'd go for it.

This beer is all about taste and mouthfeel. The soft pillowy head and smooth mix of toasted malt and bitter chocolate and the balance (I didn't taste hops, but the mildness of the malt flavor is probably the result of balance) make this a very drinkable beer. Had no idea about abv until I read it here, but this is a sessionable beer. Smooth enough to gulp, interesting enough to sip. Knowing its 6.7, just means slow down and enjoy it.

It later changed to smell like a sweet very dark chocolate. The very end of the beer smelled of dark grains and oatmeal. Taste was slighty bitter, but was mostly of grains and oatmeal.

There is some roasted and burnt malt flavors present, but they are dominated by a bitterness that lingers though into the finish and long afterward.

The taste was smoky and bitter up front, the hops are more notable than in most porters. Notes of peat and chocolate came through with a clean coffeeish finish. A very nicely crafted porter and the extra hop presence was a nice addition to the style. Recommended.","jletts","Jun 16, 2007"

The smell was great - roasted malts, coffee and some sweetness (the original sample had a weird piney smell that thankfully wasn't in this one). The taste was amazing. This is exactly what I want in an Am Porter. Great roasted taste from start to finish with some bitter but not too much at the end. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy.

Flavors that hit noticeably are nutty cocoa and chocolate with dark fruit. Finishes strong with a bitter coffee sensation. Gotta love the hop content here; it really takes hold and is quite pleasant if you like hoppy beers. Mouthfeel is competent. Overall, this is a very good beer.

The flavor starts out with a nice roasty flavor, along with some dark chocolate and expresso, citrusy and resiny hops, some dark fruits and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected but in line with the style (this is a porter not a stout after all), with moderate carbonation and drinkability is quite good.

It didn't work for Alpha Klaus although the choice of hops here better compliments the porter. I do like the smell of the C-hops but that is not what I want in my porter.

The mouthfeel was full and dextrinous and the carbonation was just right. The robust flavor of chocolate and roasted malts was accompanied by a slight alcohol warmth. The hops were well suited for the style and struck a good balance with the maltiness of the brew. I'd had New World Porter in past years that seemed a little too hoppy to let the roastiness of the dark malts shine through, but this year's batch seems right on the money.

I did not enjoy the mouthfeel or the aftertaste; seemed too heavy in my mouth with an astringent aftertaste. Over time the aftertaste evolves into more of a bread-like aftertaste that takes away from the beer.

Unique grassyness, pineyness, and esters in a porter. Tastes more like a Baltic Porter, only without the Lager flavors or Noble hops.

It's crisp in the mouth with a fine-bubbled standard carbonation and medium-light body. The flavor is rich with notes of dark, bittersweet chocolate; dull caramel; coffee grounds; and fruity (berry-like, softly citrusy, and with some mild vinous undercurrents).

The taste was correspondingly very resinously hoppy and malty (chocolate and cocoa flavors) with a rather hoppy finish.

Brew is rich in complex malty flavors, with coffee and sweet/nutty flavors domminating. The hops provide a nice balance to the brew without distracting from the distinct porter taste.
